        "text": "*NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED*\n\n*NO POLITICAL/SOCIAL CRITICISM INTENDED*\n\n*THESE ARE PURELY MY OPINIONS/TAKES ON WORKS OF VIDEO GAME DEVELOPERS*\n\nHello! I’m back! Yup, I have to say it has been a while since my last post so I would like to make up for the lost time and create my own version of “FIGHTING VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS AROUND THE WORLD.” May sound impossible at first but since I’m an avid fan of fighting-genre video games, I really don’t mind creating a World Atlas-like reference. First things first, this post will only include characters from FIGHTING VIDEO GAMES. Second, the characters covered will be from Video Games that showcase different forms of martial arts and that don’t focus on only one fighting style. This post will be divided into different regions around the world. So let’s begin our WORLD TOUR!!\n\nI. ASIA\n\nJAPAN\n\nStarting our journey in the East Asian region, our first stop is Japan. Japan, for obvious reasons, is our first destination because most developers and concept artists of the fighting video games that we enjoy today are from Japan. As a matter of fact, my observation is that in almost every fighting video game that existed, there is at least one character hailing from Japan. Most video game protagonists and important secondary characters are Japanese as well. When it comes to the characters and fighting styles developed, Japan boasts a vast variety of them. You name it, they have it! Themes include: Samurai Warriors, Elusive Ninjas, Karate Experts, Sumo Wrestlers, Judo Masters, Aikido Practitioners, Kabuki Fighters, Shrine Maidens, Religious Monks, Superhuman Athletes, Magical Girls and Japanese Mythical Creatures.\n\nNearly all characters introduced are of full Japanese ancestry. Guilty Gear’s May is absolutely oblivious that she is of Japanese ancestry. However, there are region specific characters like Nakoruru and Rimururu, who are of Ainu descent, an ethnic group indigenous to the Hokkaido region and Maxi, a pirate from the Ryukyu Islands. There is also a group of Japanese Eurasians (Ryo Sakazaki, Yuri Sakazaki, Benimaru Nikaido and Kokoro are half Japanese/half White American; Kenshi Takahashi was stated to be a Japanese Eurasian; Hinako Shijou is part Russian; Roberto Miura is mixed Japanese-White Brazilian; Setsuka, who was initially presented as Caucasian, was revealed to be of Japanese and Portuguese descent). The only non-Japanese character residing in Japan is the Chinese martial artist, Lee Chaolan, who have been adopted into a Japanese family.\n\nArt of Fighting: Eiji Kisaragi, Jin Fu-Ha, Kasumi Todoh, Ryo Sakazaki, Ryuhaku Todoh, Takuma Sakazaki, Yuri Sakazaki\n\nBuriki One: Akatsuki-Maru, Gai Tendo, Takato Saionji\n\nFatal Fury: Gato, Hokutomaru, Hotaru Futaba, Joe Higashi, Jubei Yamada, Mai Shiranui, Ryuji Yamazaki, Sokaku Mochizuki, Toji Sakata, Tsugumi Sendoh\n\nKing of Fighters: Athena Asamiya, Benimaru Nikaido, Chizuru Kagura (Yata), Goro Daimon, Hinako Shijou, Iori Yagami, Kyo Kusanagi, Kyo-1, Kyo-2, Malin, Momoko, Nagase, Orochi, Saisyu Kusanagi, Shingo Yabuki, Yashiro Nanakase\n\nRage of the Dragons: Annie Murakami, Cassandra Murata, Oni Inomura\n\nWorld Heroes: Fuuma Kotaro, Hanzo Hattori, Ryoko Izumo\n\nSamurai Shodown: Shiro Tokisada Amakusa, Basara, Gaira Caffeine, Gen-An Shiranui, Genjuro Kibagami, Hanma Yagyu, Hanzo Hattori, Haohmaru, Jinbei Sugamata, Jubei Yagyu, Kazuki Kazama, Kuroko, Kyoshiro Senryo, Mizuki Rashoujin, Nakoruru, Nicotine Caffeine, Rimururu, Shiki, Shizumaru Hisame, Sogetsu Kazama, Taizan Morozumi, Takechiyo, Ukyo Tachibana, Zankuro Minazuki\n\nAggressors of Dark Kombat: Goh Kidokoro, Joe Kusanagi\n\nBreakers: Sho Kamui, Tobikage No Saizo\n\nFighter’s History: Makoto Mizoguchi, Ryoko Kanou\n\nFight Fever: Karate Kenji, Miyuki\n\nBattle of the Beast God: Sho Hayate\n\nBattle Arena Toshinden: Eiji Shinjo, Gaia, Miyabi, Mondo, Nagisa Iwashiro, Shizuku Fuji, Sho Shinjo, Subaru Shinjo, Toujin\n\nStreet Fighter: Akuma, Edmond Honda, Geki, Gouken, Hayate, Hokuto Mizukami, Ibuki, Kairi Mizukami, Karin Kanzuki, Maki Genryusai, Makoto, Nanase Mizukami, Rainbow Mika Nanakawa, Retsu, Ryu, Sakura Kasugano, Skullomania, Zeku\n\nRival Schools: Akira Kazama, Batsu Ichimonji, Chairperson, Daigo Kazama, Eiji “Edge” Yamada, Gan Isurugi, Hayato Nekketsu, Hideo Shimazu, Hinata Wakaba, Hyo Imawano, Kurow Kirishima, Kyoko Minazuki, Kyosuke Kagami, Momo Karuizawa, Nagare Namikawa, Natsu Ayuhara, Raizo Imawano, Ran Hibiki, Roberto Miura, Shoma Sawamura, Yurika Kirishima, Aoi “Zaki” Himezaki\n\nDarkstalkers: Bishamon\n\nPower Moves: Buoh\n\nTekken: Asuka Kazama, Ganryu, Heihachi Mishima, Jin Kazama, Jinpachi Mishima, Jun Kazama, Kazumi Mishima, Kazuya Mishima, Kuma, Kuma Jr., Kunimitsu, Lee Chaolan, Miharu Hirano, Mokujin, NANCY-MI847J, Yoshimitsu\n\nSoul Calibur: Maxi, Heishiro Mitsurugi, Natsu, Setsuka, Taki, Yoshimitsu, Yoshimitsu II\n\nKnuckle Heads: Takeshi Fujioka\n\nMortal Kombat: Kenshi Takahashi, Scorpion (Hanzo Hasashi)\n\nDead or Alive: Ayane, Hayate, Honoka, Kasumi, Kokoro, Momiji, Nyotengu, Omega (Genra), Raidou, Ryu Hayabusa, Tengu\n\nGuilty Gear: Anji Mito, Baiken, May\n\nMartial Champion: Jin, Zen\n\nVirtua Fighter: Akira Yuki, Aoi Umenokouji, Dural (Tsukikage), Goh Hinogami, Kage-Maru, Taka-Arashi\n\nPower Instinct: Buntaro Kuno, Hikaru Jomon, Hizumi Yukinoue, Kanji Kokuin, Kintaro “Kinta” Kokuin, Kurara Hananokoji, Oshima Goketsuji, Otane Goketsuji, Oume Goketsuji, Popura Hananokoji, Reiji Oyama, Remi Otogiri, Rin Oyama, Saizo Hattori, Shintaro Kuno, Sujiroku Tenjinbashi, Takumi Hattori\n\nKaiser Knuckle: Gekkou, Kazuya\n\nSOUTH KOREA\n\nLet’s now visit Japan’s neighboring country, South Korea. When examining South Korea’s contribution to video game characters, most themes are related to Taekwondo, the most prominent Korean martial art. Since the introduction of Kim Kaphwan from Fatal Fury, various Korean Taekwondo practitioners have been present in succeeding SNK-developed fighting video games. Meanwhile, several video game developers introduced their own Taekwondo prodigies: Tekken’s Baek Doo San and Hwoarang, and Street Fighter’s very own Juri Han. Other notable styles utilize Chinese martial arts, sword fighting and pole weapons.\n\nKing of Fighters: Chae Lim, Chang Koehan, Choi Bounge, Gang-Il, Jhun Hoon, Jinju “May” Lee\n\nFatal Fury: Kim Dong Hwan, Kim Jae Hoon, Kim Kaphwan\n\nFight Fever: Han Baedal, Master Taekuk\n\nAggressors of Dark Kombat: Lee Hae Gwon\n\nBattle of the Beast God: Kim Sue Il\n\nBreakers: Lee Dao-Long\n\nBuriki One: Seo Yong Song\n\nFighter’s History: Liu Yungmie\n\nRage of the Dragons: Kang Jae-Mo\n\nSamurai Shodown: Kim Hae-Ryeong\n\nWorld Heroes: Kim Dragon\n\nStreet Fighter: Juri Han\n\nSoul Calibur: Seong Han Myeong, Hwang Sung Kyung, Seong Mi-Na, Hong Yun-Seong\n\nTekken: Baek Doo San, Hwoarang\n\nGuilty Gear: Kum Haehyun\n\nMONGOLIA\n\nWe now move on the Asian mainland starting with Mongolia. So far, there have been only 3 fighting video game characters hailing from Mongolia and all of them are experts of Mongolian Wrestling. Two of the characters introduced, Julius Carn and Temjin, are homage to the iconic emperor of the Mongol Empire, Genghis Kahn.\n\nWorld Heroes: Julius Carn\n\nArt of Fighting: Temjin\n\nMortal Kombat: Hsu Hao\n\nCHINA (P.R.C.)\n\nWe now come to People’s Republic of China, a country which is home to several martial arts and rich culture. Almost every character is a practitioner of a specific Chinese Martial Arts styles such as Tai Chi, Drunken Fist and Jeet Kune Do to name a few. To reflect the rich and colorful culture of the country, characters are dressed in exquisite Chinese costumes and ornate garments. The characters’ themes are diverse as well. There are Shaolin monks, acrobatic women warriors, aged Kung Fu masters, powerful sorcerers, veteran swordsmen and mythical characters inspired from classic Chinese novels. The Chinese video game characters also boasts a lot of exotic weapons like staffs, spears, iron claws and daggers. Due to a variety of authentic fighting styles from China, I observed that there is always at least one character in most video game series that comes from China.\n\nNearly all characters are ethnic Chinese. However, there are at least 3 Chinese Eurasians who reside in China: The Sub-Zero brothers and Lynn Barker are all half Chinese/half White American. Additionally, even though Kilik was raised in China, it is implied that he is NOT an ethnic Chinese.\n\nKing of Fighters: Bao, Chin Gentsai, Duo Lon, Lin, Meitenkun, Mian, Shen Woo, Shion, Shun’ei, Sie Kensou, Xiao Lon\n\nBuriki One: Song Xuandao\n\nFatal Fury: Jin Chonrei, Jin Chonshu, Tung Fu Rue\n\nArt of Fighting: Lee Pai Long, Wang Koh-San\n\nBattle of the Beast God: Chung Paifu\n\nFighter’s History: Lee Ten Dok, Liu Feilin\n\nFight Fever: Chintao\n\nBreakers: Huang Bai Hu\n\nWorld Heroes: Ryofu, Son Gokuu\n\nRage of the Dragons: Lynn Baker\n\nSamurai Shodown: Wan-Fu\n\nStreet Fighter: Chun-Li, Gen, Lee\n\nDarkstalkers: Hsien-Ko\n\nSoul Calibur: Hualin, Kilik, Yan Leixia, Li Long, Chai Xianghua, Xiba\n\nTekken: Feng Wei, Ling Xiaoyu, Panda, Wang Jinrei\n\nKnuckle Heads: Christine Myao\n\nPower Instinct: Thin Nen\n\nMortal Kombat: Kung Jin, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Noob Saibot (Bi Han), Sektor, Sub-Zero (Kuai Liang)\n\nVirtua Fighter: Eileen, Lau Chan, Lei Fei, Shun Di\n\nGuilty Gear: Faust, Jam Kuradoberi\n\nBattle Arena Toshinden: Bayhou, Fo Fai, Genma, Ronron\n\nPower Moves: Gaoluon\n\nKaiser Knuckle: Wulong\n\nDead or Alive: Brad Wong, Gen Fu, Jann Lee, Lei Fang\n\nMartial Champion: Hoi\n\nHONG KONG\n\nLet’s now visit Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China. Just like the characters from Mainland China, characters from Hong Kong are also practitioners of specific Chinese martial arts and are garbed in distinct Chinese costumes. My main observation is that most character designs are inspired from existing elements of pop culture: Lei Wulong and Hon Fu pay tribute to Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan, Fei Long was inspired from the iconic Bruce Lee, Yun and Yang’s designs (and personalities) are similar to Gundam Wing characters Duo Maxwell and Trowa Barton, while Dan Hibiki comes from the humorous amalgamation of SNK characters Ryo Sakazaki, Robert Garcia and Yuri Sakazaki.\n\nAll characters are ethnic Chinese with the exception of Dan Hibiki (Japanese) and M.A.D. (unknown ethnicity).\n\nStreet Fighter: Dan Hibiki, Fei Long, Yun Lee, Yang Lee\n\nPower Instinct: M.A.D. (Max Ax Dax)\n\nMartial Champion: Chaos\n\nTekken: Lei Wulong\n\nVirtua Fighter: Pai Chan\n\nFatal Fury: Hon Fu\n\nBattle Arena Toshinden: Cuiling\n\nTAIWAN (R.O.C.)\n\nOur next stop is Taiwan (Republic of China). We have two representative characters from Taiwan who are ethnic Chinese: Tai Chi expert and businessman, Cheng Sinzan, and beautiful swordswoman, Lihua.\n\nFatal Fury: Cheng Sinzan\n\nKaiser Knuckle: Lihua\n\nPHILIPPINES\n\nWe now head towards the Southeast Asian region starting with the Philippines. Our Filipino representatives are Talim, a pacifist priestess adorned in tribal designs and accessories and Josie Rizal, a kick boxer/model whose costume pays homage to the colors and symbols of the Philippine flag.\n\nSoul Calibur: Talim\n\nTekken: Josie Rizal\n\nMALAYSIA\n\nLet’s move further in the maritime Southeast Asian region with Malaysia. A sole representative, Miss Til is a Malaysian fortune teller who uses a long flute as her weapon.\n\nBattle Arena Toshinden: Miss Til\n\nINDONESIA\n\nMoving on, let’s visit the archipelago of Indonesia. Indonesia’s sole representative is Jivatma, the boss character and tournament organizer in The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact 2.\n\nKing of Fighters: Jivatma\n\nVIETNAM\n\nLet’s move further in mainland Southeast Asia with Vietnam. While unofficial, many gamers and fans speculate Luong, a new character in King of Fighters, to be of Vietnamese origin judging by her name, appearance and costumes.\n\nKing of Fighters: Luong\n\nTHAILAND\n\nNext stop is Thailand. Thailand’s main contribution to the fighting video games genre is Muay Thai. Most Thai characters utilize Muay Thai as their fighting style and are wearing traditional Muay Thai trunks and related accessories (head band, arm bands, bandages, etc). Exempted from the Muay Thai arts are Power Moves’ Reayon, who practices Chinese martial arts, and Takeda Takahashi, a nijutsu practitioner.\n\nAll characters are ethnic Thais with the exception of Reayon, who is probably mixed Thai-Chinese and Takeda Takahashi who is of Japanese Eurasian and Thai descent. Despite not being Thai, M. Bison, the leader of Shadaloo, has his base of operations located and concentrated in Thailand.\n\nStreet Fighter: Adon, M. Bison, Sagat\n\nPower Moves: Reayon\n\nBreakers: Tia Langray\n\nBuriki One: Payak Sitpitak\n\nFatal Fury: Hwa Jai\n\nFighter’s History: Samchay Tomyamkun\n\nWorld Heroes: Shura Nai Khanomtom\n\nMortal Kombat: Takeda Takahashi\n\nINDIA\n\nLet’s now visit the South Asian region starting with India. So far, there have been only 3 fighting video game characters from India. The most iconic and probably most popular Indian character would have to be Dhalsim, the pacifist expert of Yoga and teleportation. He is joined by 2 Indian musclemen, Darun Mister (inspired by the renowned Indian wrestler, the Great Gama) and Abubo Rao.\n\nStreet Fighter: Darun Mister, Dhalsim\n\nRage of the Dragons: Abubo Rao\n\nSRI LANKA\n\nWe now reach the final destination of our Asian tour in Sri Lanka. The lone Sri Lankan to grace the fighting genre video game is Battle Arena Toshinden’s Chaos, a scythe-wielding warrior and an antagonist of the series.\n\nBattle Arena Toshinden: Chaos"
