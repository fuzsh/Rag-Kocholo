More than 250 civilians have completed primary military training at the Kharkiv regional institution of national resistance.\n\nAbout 400 people are currently doing the course.\n\n\"I need to complete this training not only as a teacher of the 'defence of Ukraine' subject, I also need this as a classroom teacher who lives in such a dangerous time,\" Nadiia Mokliak, a school teacher, said.\n\n\"If I need to write an essay on 'How did you spend your summer?', I would write a very interesting essay.\"\n\nThe head of the institution, Oleksandr Zalivan, says that in four months, more 250 civilians completed their training at the institution.\n\n\"All these preparations are essential because sudden explosions can occur in our infrastructure and populated areas. At any moment, anyone might find themselves in a situation where they need to provide assistance to themselves or to someone nearby,\" Sulivan said.\n\nThe course is available for all adult men and women under the age of 60, regardless of their profession."
