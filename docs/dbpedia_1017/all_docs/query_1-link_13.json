        "text": "Star Soldier is a shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Family Computer and the MSX. The player pilots the starship 'Caesar', travelling through space stations occupied by powerful supercomputers known as 'Starbrains' who threaten the galactic empire. Star Soldier greatly resembles the earlier arcade game Star Force.\n\nStar Soldier has spawned numerous sequels, starting with Super Star Soldier on the PC Engine. It was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2004 in Japan as part of the Famicom Mini series, and to the Wii's Virtual Console in the Japanese and North American regions in July 2007. An enhanced remake of the game was released on PlayStation Portable only in Japan in 2005.\n\nMore details about this game can be found on Wikipedia.org.\n\nThis verÂ­sion of Star Soldier was deÂ­sigÂ­ned for the NinÂ­tenÂ­do EnÂ­terÂ­taiÂ­nment SysÂ­tem (NES), which was an eight-bit viÂ­deo gaÂ­me conÂ­soÂ­le maÂ­nuÂ­facÂ­tuÂ­red by NinÂ­tenÂ­do in the years 1983 - 2003. In that time, it was the best-selÂ­ling viÂ­deo gaÂ­me conÂ­soÂ­le for which moÂ­re than 700 liÂ­cenÂ­sed gaÂ­mes and a numÂ­ber of non-liÂ­cenÂ­sed gaÂ­mes weÂ­re creÂ­aÂ­ted. WorldÂ­wiÂ­de, apÂ­proÂ­xiÂ­maÂ­teÂ­ly 62 milÂ­lion units of this conÂ­soÂ­le weÂ­re sold at apÂ­proÂ­xiÂ­maÂ­teÂ­ly priÂ­ce $ 100 per unit. MoÂ­re inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tiÂ­on about the NES conÂ­soÂ­le can be found here.\n\nYou can control this game easily by using the keyboard of your PC (see the table next to the game). However, for maximum gaming enjoyment, we strongly recommend using a USB gamepad that you simply plug into the USB port of your computer. If you do not have a gamepad, buy a suitable USB controller on Amazon or AliExpress or in some of your favorite online stores.\n\n6 different online emulators are available for Star Soldier. These emulators differ not only in the technology they use to emulate old games, but also in support of various game controllers, multiplayer mode, mobile phone touchscreen, emulation speed, absence or presence of embedded ads and in many other parameters. For maximum gaming enjoyment, it's important to choose the right emulator, because on each PC and in different Internet browsers, the individual emulators behave differently. The basic features of each emulator available for this game Star Soldier are summarized in the following table:"
