        "meta_description": "Wii's Virtual Console is home to some of the best shooters of all time, so its only fitting that when WiiWare launched, we had a new wave of current-day shooters to compliment it.  Hudson is first out the gate here in the US, delivering Star Soldier R, which is a new take on the classic Super Star Soldier/Soldier Blade series.  Much like the games you'd get on VC for 600 points, Star Soldier R follows the same core design, mixing top-view shooter roots with three ship speeds, a few power-ups, and a lot of twitch shooting.  This 800 point (145 block) package may be a great addition to any shooter fan's console, but after putting both the Japanese and US builds through their respective paces, we'd still recommend a few VC shooters over this slightly overpriced experience.",
