        "text": "Super Star Soldier is a vertically scrolling shooter developed by Kaneko and published by Hudson Soft in 1990 for the PC-Engine (Turbografx-16).

It is the second entry in the series not to be developed directly by Hudson Soft.\n\nFor replay videos, visit the Video Index.\n\nStory\n\nIn the beginning of this new era of time and space, the small fighter aircraft, Caesar, was just beginning its fight against the evil Brains in an attempt to restore peace to the world. The mission was a success, and peace was restored. Now, four years later, the evil Brains are planning their next attack. Lead by their evil leader, Mother Brain, the peaceful existence of the world is once again in jeopardy.\n\nHowever, do not despair all hope is not lost! In anticipation of the Brains's expected counterattack, an improved version of the original Caesar was designed and built and now sits quietly, ready for battle. It is you, Starbuck, that must pilot this new fighting aircraft Neo Caesar into combat! Go now! Hurry to your ship, you are the world's only hope of peace! - NA Manual\n\nGameplay Overview\n\nSuper Star Soldier, like its predecessors, is a vertical scrolling shooter with an emphasis on high score chasing and competitive play. Super Star Soldier features establishes the format and style of gameplay that would become standard for the rest of the series, building upon the mechanics of the original Star Soldier, as well as it's direct predecessor Gunhed.\n\nIt features a total of eight main stages, and is the first game in the series to feature a dedicated stage for the Caravan modes.\n\nControls\n\nI: Rotate Defense System\n\nII (Press): Fire primary weapon\n\nII (Hold): Auto-Fire\n\nSelect: Navigate menu and change movement speed\n\nStart: Start game and pause/un-pause\n\nWeapons\n\nThere are five different weapons in Super Star Soldier which can are obtained and upgraded through collecting power-up crystals.\n\nWeapon Description Multishot\n\nBase weapon. Auto-firing straight shot.\n\nCan be upgraded to a total of six lines of fire in five directions. Homing Missiles\n\nSecondary weapon that auto-fires alongside the player's main weapon. Ring Laser\n\nAuto-firing wide shots that expand as they move forward. Spread Laser\n\nForward beam that lengthens and eventually splits into three. Swing Fire\n\nSort range columns of swinging flames. Highest damage weapon.\n\nItems\n\nThere are four items to be found in Super Star Soldier: Power-Up Crystals, Homing Missiles, the Starbuck Defense System, and Bonus Points.

Five are required to fully upgrade a weapon.\n\nCollecting more than five of one kind or a flashing crystal triggers a screen-clearing Super Bomb. Homing Missiles\n\nSecondary weapon that auto-fires alongside the player's main weapon.

Collecting two causes them to automatically circle around the player. Bonus Points\n\nIncreases score.\n\nStrategy\n\nManagement of items and weapons is crucial, as the effectiveness of a particular weapon on a particular boss varies.\n\nNearly all enemy shots are aimed, but the increase in hardware power over the NES means there are far more shots and enemies overall. While there are multiple movement speeds, higher speeds are generally not advisable in the main game since it will more than likely lead to collision with enemies."
