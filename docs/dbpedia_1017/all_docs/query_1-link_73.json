        "text": "America’s Army, army training simulator and electronic game used for army recruitment and training. It was created in 2002 by Lieut. Col. Casey Wardynski of the U.S. Army. The game is maintained and managed by the U.S. Army and received positive reviews for its realistic depiction of a soldier’s experiences. Millions of registered users contributed to the game’s success since its release.\n\nThe U.S. Army developed America’s Army as a way to generate interest in the army and to recruit tech-savvy video game enthusiasts. The game is free via download over the Internet, or it can be obtained at army recruitment centres. The game is played online, where it enjoys a large community of loyal followers. America’s Army has evolved to the point where it is utilized as a training tool by the U.S. Army to prepare recruits for particular combat scenarios. Game play centres on passing a series of training courses before moving on to simulated combat scenarios. Players can choose what type of soldier they would like to be and are then given a series of tasks to complete in order to achieve that goal. To be a medic, for instance, players must pass a combat medic training simulator. The game is so realistic that it helped America’s Army enthusiast Paxton Galvanek rescue and treat two car accident victims in 2007 despite having no medical training besides what he had learned from the game."
