        "text": "Legislation\n\nThe British Board of Film Censors is created by a burgeoning film industry as a means of ensuring uniformity for film classification decisions.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nBBFC's list of exceptions is revised to include 'girls' clothes pulled off, leaving them in scanty undergarments', 'drugging and ruining of young girls' and 'criminal assault on girls'.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe H certificate is introduced by the BBFC. H is an advisory certificate which tells the public that a film has a horror theme and is not suitable for children.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nNo Orchids for Miss Blandish is cut by 11 minutes despite earlier enforced script changes by the BBFC to limit its sexual violence. It was later banned by local authorities and the BBFC's Secretary is forced to publicly apologise for passing it at all.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nBrighton Rock is attacked by critics as 'nasty and sensationalist' but is a success at the box office.\n\nLegislation\n\nAs a result of changes to the Cinematograph Act, the X certificate is introduced. No children under the age of 16 are allowed to see an X film. This is the first mandatory age-restricted category.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nThe BBFC rejects The Wild One on the grounds that it presents an 'unbridled spectacle of hooliganism'. It is not rated until 1967.\n\nDrugs\n\nThe Man with the Golden Arm Frank Sinatra startles audiences by playing a heroin addict in a film based on a gritty cult novel by Nelson Algren. The BBFC awards the film an X certificate.\n\nSex\n\nCarry On Sergeant is rated U without cuts. It's the first of the popular British sex comedy franchise.\n\nLegislation\n\nIn the first famous trial using the new Obscene Publications Act, D H Lawrence's novel Lady Chatterley's Lover becomes freely available for the first time in 32 years. The book is deemed art rather than pornography.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nBBFC rates Hitchcock's Psycho X after cuts to the notorious shower scene. The film in later years is rated 15 uncut on video.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nThe BBFC rejects Lady In A Cage on the grounds that is an exercise in sadistic brutality and might 'have the effect of encouraging juvenile violence'. The film is later rated 18 uncut on video in 2002 and 15 uncut on DVD in 2005.\n\nSex\n\nStanley Kubrick's Lolita rated X without cuts but only after changes required by the BBFC at the script stage are made. The BBFC rates Victim X after minor cuts. It is the first British film to deal openly with the subject of homosexuality.\n\nSex\n\nHelga, the first sex education film to be rated by the BBFC, is awarded an A rating after cuts are made.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe age limit on the X category is raised from 16 to 18. The advisory U and A categories are introduced along with the AA category that allows admission to those aged 14 and over.\n\nDrugs\n\nAndy Warhol's Trash is rejected by the BBFC. It is subsequently passed X with cuts in 1972. Rising star Al Pacino appears in Panic in Needle Park, about heroin addicts in New York. The film is rejected by the BBFC and not rated until 1975.\n\nSex\n\nThe first male erection shown on British screens is seen in Andy Warhol's Flesh. It is given an X certificate. The Yugoslav film WR - Mysteries of the Organism, which contains sight of erections and real sex, is rated X without cuts.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nStraw Dogs is cut to reduce a rape scene. BBFC is attacked by critics for passing the film and a number of councils opt to ban it. BBFC rates A Clockwork Orange X uncut. Although the film implies sexual violence, no rape is actually shown.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nBBFC requires cuts to a sequence in John Boorman's Deliverance in which a man is seen being raped.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nEnter the Dragon is rated X for cinema release with cuts to violence, but with nunchaku (chainsticks) scenes intact. A Clockwork Orange is removed from sale by Stanley Kubrick after controversy about its violence and death threats against his family.\n\nSex\n\nThe Obscene Publications Act is extended to film. This allows films to be judged as a whole rather than single scenes being judged as indecent. As a result the BBFC waives its original cut to Last Tango in Paris.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nBBFC recalls Emmanuelle (1974) from distribution to remove a rape scene in which sexual assault is presented as good for the victim.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nJames Ferman recalls Enter the Dragon to cut nunchaku scenes. The Warriors is rated X uncut. Local authorities, concerned by reports of the film's effects in the US, ask the BBFC to reconsider. The BBFC declines.\n\nDrugs\n\nCult German film Christiane F portraying heroin addiction is passed with an X certificate. The initial 18 rated video version is cut to reduce scenes of drug taking for home viewing in 1986. A later version in 2000 is passed 18 without cuts.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe BBFC rating system is overhauled with the introduction of the PG, 15, 18 and R18 categories. The first film rated PG is Return Of The Soldier.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nDirector of Public Prosecutions instructs police to seize 'video nasties', many of which include sexually violent scenes and have never been rated by the BBFC. Seized titles include I Spit On Your Grave, Last House On The left and Cannibal Holocaust.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe Video Recordings Act (VRA) is passed and the BBFC becomes the designated authority for rating videos 'for suitability within the home'. The BBFC becomes the British Board of Film Classification.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nStreets of Fire is one of the last films to feature butterfly knives before they are added to the list of banned weaponry. The Video Recordings Act is introduced to prevent underage access to unsuitable videos and crack down on so-called 'video nasties'.\n\nDrugs\n\nComic references to cocaine are cut from Crocodile Dundee for PG on video. Ecstasy is established as the drug of choice in the rave dance scene.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nOutright ban on nunchaku, shuriken and balisong is waived in non-action/martial arts works where the sight is incidental, comic, brief and/or used to establish character. After the Hungerford Massacre, Rambo III is cut to reduce violence and knifes.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nBBFC rates The Accused 18 uncut on the grounds that it does not exploit or eroticise sexual violence but is intended to make a serious point.\n\nLegislation\n\nTim Burton's Batman becomes the first 12 rated film in the cinema. Children under 12 cannot view this in the cinema. This category is only available for theatrical releases.\n\nSex\n\nExplicit fellatio is passed for the first time on film in Ai No Corrida (In the Realm of the Senses).

Later in 1993, more extensive cuts are made for the film's video release.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nNatural Born Killers is rated 18 uncut after the BBFC investigates possible links between the film and killings in France and the USA. No link is found but after the Dunblane School Massacre, the distributor decides not to release the film on video.\n\nSex\n\nCrash banned by Westminster Council and other local authorities after receiving an 18 certificate from the BBFC. The feature Kissed is also rated 18 in the same year. Both films cause controversy for their accounts of fetishistic sexual activity.\n\nSex\n\nThe Idiot and Romance rated 18 on film - both contain brief explicit images of penetration.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nBBFC refuses a video certificate to the American version of Straw Dogs, for a scene in which a female character appears to enjoy being raped.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nThe ban on martial arts weaponry is lifted. For the first time the BBFC publishes a set of written Guidelines which disallow emphasis and glamorisation of realistic contemporary and easily obtainable weapons but do not automatically ban any weapon.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nEnter the Dragon is rated 18 uncut on video. A Clockwork Orange is re-released in UK cinemas after Stanley Kubrick's death.\n\nSex\n\nBritish actor participates in explicit fellatio in the feature Intimacy, rated 18 without cuts.\n\nSexual Violence\n\nBBFC refuses a video certificate to the American version of Straw Dogs, for a scene in which a female character appears to enjoy being raped.\n\nViolence and Weapons\n\nLara Croft: Tomb Raider is cut for glamorisation of knives in a film aimed at young teenagers.
