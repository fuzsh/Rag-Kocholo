Heinlein and the satirical 1997 film adaptation by screenwriter Edward Neumeier and director Paul Verhoeven.\n\nSetting\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series is set hundreds of years in the future, after a collapse of Western democracy and many resulting wars. In this future, human society is now ruled by the Terran Federation, a government run by military veterans. Military service is voluntary, but required to earn the full rights of citizenship, such as holding office and voting.\n\nMuch of the series focuses on the experiences of Juan \"Johnny\" Rico and the lessons he learns enlisting in military service along with his hometown friends, Carmen Ibanez (a love interest who becomes a pilot) and Carl (who, in the films, is shown as being a psychic who joins military intelligence). Johnny joins the 'Mobile Infantry', the primary foot soldiers of the Federation (depicted in the book as having advanced armored suits equipped with jetpacks and nuclear weapons). While Johnny is in training, an alien species known as the \"Arachnids\" attacks Buenos Aires, resulting in the death of Johnny's family (only his mother in the books, his entire family in the film). After this, the Federation goes to war and the series follows their attempts to defeat the \"bugs\", especially by capturing part of the Arachnid ruling class.\n\nNovel\n\n[edit]\n\nStarship Troopers (1959)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Starship Troopers\n\nAt some point between 1958 and 1959, Robert Heinlein put aside the novel that would become Stranger in a Strange Land and wrote Starship Troopers. His motivation arose partially from his anger at US President Dwight Eisenhower's decision to suspend US nuclear tests, and the Soviet tests that occurred soon afterward.[1] Writing in his 1980 volume Expanded Universe, Heinlein would say that the publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy on April 5, 1958, calling for a unilateral suspension of nuclear weapons testing by the United States sparked his desire to write Starship Troopers. Heinlein and his wife Virginia created the \"Patrick Henry League\" in an attempt to create support for the US nuclear testing program. Heinlein stated that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views.\n\nLike many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was completed in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes.[1][4][5] Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections to the content of the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.[4][6]\n\nThe Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction first published Starship Troopers in October and November 1959 as a two-part serial titled Starship Soldier.[5]\n\nCommentators have written that Starship Troopers is not driven by its plot, though it contains scenes of military combat. Instead, much of the novel is given over to a discussion of ideas. In particular, the discussion of political views is a recurring feature of what scholar Jeffrey Cass described as an \"ideologically intense\" book. A 1997 review in Salon categorized it as a \"philosophical novel\".[9] Critics have debated to what extent the novel promotes Heinlein's own political views. Some contend that the novel maintains a sense of irony that allows readers to draw their own conclusions; others argue that Heinlein is sermonizing throughout the book, and that its purpose is to expound Heinlein's militaristic philosophy.\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nLive-action\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director(s) Screenwriter(s) Producer(s) Starship Troopers November 7, 1997 Paul Verhoeven Edward Neumeier Jon Davison\n\nAlan Marshall Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation April 24, 2004 Phil Tippett Jon Davison Starship Troopers 3: Marauder August 5, 2008 Edward Neumeier David Lancaster\n\nFuture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2011, film producer Neal H. Moritz announced plans to produce a reboot of the Starship Troopers film franchise.[10] In November 2016, Columbia and Moritz announced the writing team of Mark Swift and Damian Shannon had been signed to pen the screenplay.[11] Verhoeven expressed skepticism at the proposed remake, citing reports that it draws heavily from the original militaristic 1959 novel.[12]\n\nAnimated\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director(s) Screenwriter(s) Story by Producer(s) Starship Troopers: Invasion August 28, 2012 Shinji Aramaki Flint Dille Shinji Aramaki\n\nJoseph Chou\n\nShigehito Kawada Joseph Chou Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars August 21, 2017 Shinji Aramaki\n\nMasaru Matsumoto Edward Neumeier Joseph Chou\n\nMax Nishi\n\nTomi Hashimoto\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries Episodes First released Last released Showrunner(s) Network(s) Starship Troopers 6 October 25, 1988 December 17, 1988 Tetsurō Amino — Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles 36 + 4 clip shows August 30, 1999 April 3, 2000 Richard Raynis BKN\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nVideo game U.S. release date Developer Publisher Platform(s) Starship Troopers[13] 1979 Dendron Amusements Dendron Amusements CP/M Starship Troopers 1997 MGA Entertainment MGA Entertainment Handheld LCD game Starship Troopers: Terran Ascendancy October 23, 2000 Blue Tongue Entertainment Hasbro Interactive Windows Starship Troopers October 27, 2005 Strangelite Empire Interactive and Destineer Windows Starship Troopers: Terran Command June 16, 2022 The Artistocrats Slitherine Software Windows Starship Troopers: Extermination May 17, 2023 (early access) Offworld Industries Offworld Industries Windows\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nList indicator(s)\n\nThis table shows the principal characters and the actors who have portrayed them throughout the franchise.\n\nA dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film or video game, or that the character's presence in the film or video game has not yet been announced.\n\nA V indicates a voice only role.\n\nCharacter Anime series Original series Animated films Animated series Starship Troopers Starship Troopers Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation Starship Troopers 3: Marauder Starship Troopers: Invasion Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles 1988 1997 2004 2008 2012 2017 1999–2000 Fed Net Announcer John Cunningham Stephen Stanton Corey Burton Andrew Love Juan D.
