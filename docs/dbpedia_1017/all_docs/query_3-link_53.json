        "text": "Just days ago, Netflix released the R-rated extended cuts of Zack Snyder’s two Rebel Moon films. Nobody seems to be talking about them at all, which isn’t a good sign considering the original cuts were widely panned by audiences and critics. It’s safe to say that, for the most part, Netflix’s partnership with Snyder has been a dud, and we’re seeing the ramifications on Snyder’s other franchise, Army of the Dead.\n\nIn a new piece by The Wrap, it’s confirmed that plans to expand the Army of the Dead franchise with sequels and an animated series have been quietly canceled.\n\nSnyder’s response when asked about it was, “We are very ambitious with everything.”\n\nHe’s not joking. Rebel Moon also had a similar plan that may or may not come to fruition. We’ve been saying all along that it feels like Netflix is quietly dumping the films by releasing both Snyder Cuts on the same day. If they were really popular as previous reports suggested, Netflix would want to capitalize as much as possible. They are clearly doing the opposite."
