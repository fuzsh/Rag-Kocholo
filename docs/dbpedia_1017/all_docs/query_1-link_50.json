        "text": "Star Parodier PC Engine CD Reproduction\n\nStar Parodier is to the Star Soldier series as Parodius is to the Gradius series. Essentially these are fun, lighthearted parodies of their respective Shoot Em Up game series. Don’t let the cute aesthetic fool you though as this still some real Shooter action coming at you! Easily one of my personal favorite games for the console and a Must Buy for every PC Engine fan. I mean c’mon, you can choose to pilot an actual original PC Engine console, Bomberman, or a Star Soldier ship – each with it’s own matching unique Power Ups, how cool is that?! So much fun – fast, frantic game-play, wonderfully cartoony graphics, huge sprites and bosses, parallax, CD audio, awesome intro, just a flat out excellent game through and through. Not to be missed.\n\nSide note: this was actually in the works to be released in the US under the name Fantasy Star Soldier but sadly, like most of the best games, it was not to be.\n\nBonus “Picture disc” style Original Soundtrack CD feat. cover artwork\n\n$24.95 ea. reproduction (art, case & backup)\n\n$14.95 ea. replacement case (art & case)"
