        "text": "Governor Greg Abbott last night championed the Texas economic miracle and the unique business opportunities that continue to attract companies to the state during a fireside chat for the Portland Chamber of Commerce.\n\n“Texas is the headquarters of headquarters, with 52 Fortune 500 companies calling our great state home,” said Governor Abbott. “People come to Texas because of the freedom and opportunity we offer here. Last year, I signed into law House Bill 5, which gives local jurisdictions the economic tools they need to attract businesses to come to Texas or grow their operations within our state. Everyone in Texas has the chance to succeed and thrive. Together, we will build a bigger, better Texas for the next generation of Texans.”\n\nDuring the fireside chat moderated by Portland Chamber of Commerce Chairwoman Elizabeth Ackman, Governor Abbott highlighted Texas’ successful economic policies that allow businesses large and small to thrive in Texas, including our highly skilled workforce, the newly created Texas Business Courts, and the state’s robust infrastructure with more road miles and airports than any other state. The Governor also touted signing the largest property tax cut in Texas history, putting $18 billion back into the pockets of hardworking Texans."
