        "text": "Enigma is one of the playable ships from the PSP version of Hudson Selection Vol. 2: Star Soldier.\n\nDescription[]\n\nOne of the prototypes of the next-generation flagship fighter. While the Assault Caesar is a well-balanced aircraft for offense and defense, this aircraft is designed with an emphasis on offensive power by concentrating the firepower forward. It boasts overwhelming firepower combined with the performance of the blaster, but since the defense power is sacrificed by that amount, it is vulnerable to surprise attacks from the side.\n\nDetails[]\n\nThe Enigma is a new model spaceship belonging to Earth's Galactic Fleet. This ship was designed with firepower in mind, having a concentrated frontal shot which causes heavy damage to enemies and bosses but lacking in speed and spread, only firing an additional stream to the back when fully powered up. Its Burst activates a dual flamethrower which covers its sides in short range."
