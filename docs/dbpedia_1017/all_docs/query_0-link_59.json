Check out what these winners brought in their armies with our commentary on their selections.\n\nTop Warhammer 40k Army Lists: Necrons Stomp The Salt Lake Open 2024\n\nThanks to Best Coast Pairings, we can look back at the event as if we were all there ourselves. Click this special promo link to save $20 on a year’s subscription to BCP.\n\n3rd Place: Daniel Reddehase – Death Guard\n\n2nd Place: Kennith Onyeabor – Tyranids\n\n1st Place: Rob Gonzales – Necrons\n\nRob’s Necrons took a huge new approach to army building! By placing almost all of the points in huge point-efficient models, it’s harder to lose out on stragglers in losing battles. A total of four C’tan shards bring a mix of supportive power, but they are all large, somewhat durable models with great combat power! Three Hexmark Destroyers bring a few more solo models, this time for some cheaper ranged options to help pick off easy targets.\n\nFor normal units, there’s only a single Deathmark squad for some extra ranged power! The list then ends on three Doomsday Arks for larger ranged threats, again sporting pretty good durability for a low model count list that’s hard to take down!\n\nThe Salt Lake Open showcased some impressive displays of tactical Warhammer 40k gameplay with these army lists. Necrons, Tyranids, and Death Guard claimed the top spots, showcasing a potential shift in what players should consider.\n\nOverall, studying these army lists can provide valuable insights and inspiration for your own army-building for both newer Warhammer 40k players and pros alike.\n\nClick Here For More Top Warhammer Army Lists\n\nWhat do you think of these top Warhammer 40k army lists from The Salt Lake Open?\n\nIf you buy something from a link on our site, we may earn a commision.
