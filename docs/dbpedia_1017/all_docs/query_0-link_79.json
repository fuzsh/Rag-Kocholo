        "text": "In our main Japanese counters article, you learned what counters are and how to use them. You also learned that around 500 counters exist, though not all of them are in common (or even uncommon) use. We took this list and reduced the number to 350, then categorized them by how useful they are.\n\nAlthough this Japanese counters list is extremely thorough, you don't have to learn everything here. You can get away with memorizing anywhere between two, nineteen, or sixty-six counters, depending on what your goals are. Here's how we broke things down:\n\nAbsolutely Must-Know Counters: 2\n\nMust-Know Counters: 17\n\nCommon Counters: 47\n\nSomewhat Common Counters: 205\n\nRare But Interesting Counters: 22\n\nGairaigo Counters: 57\n\nOne more note is that some of the \"counters\" in here are actually \"units\" having to do with time, weight, speed, etc. But, since those units work grammatically the same as counters and mostly follow the same reading rules, we included them on our counters list. Plus, they're all counting something, technically, be it days, hours, minutes, etc.\n\nPrerequisite: You'll want to make sure you know how to read hiragana. If you get to the gairaigo counters, you'll need to know how to read katakana as well. There will also be times we mention the \"kango/wago/gairaigo counting method.\" You can learn all three Japanese numbering systems in our Counting in Japanese article. Knowing the kanji for the numbers will help too. In our example sentences and explanations, we equally use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) and Japanese kanji (一, 二, 三), since both are quite common in Japanese.\n\naround 500 counters exist, though not all of them are in common (or even uncommon) use.\n\nAs this is a reference guide, we highly recommend you CTRL/CMD+F to find the counter you're looking for. If we have an individual (and more thorough) separate article for the counter, there will be a link to take you there. We recommend reading those individual counters articles when you can, as they go into much greater detail than we're able to here. In this article, we just give you an overview of each counter without going too deep.\n\nTo assist you in your studies more, we've also created a complimentary spreadsheet that contains all of the counters in this article plus how to count with them. To download it, just sign up for our email list. We'll use it to notify you about new Japanese language articles, Japanese resources, article giveaways (such as this one), as well as any sales and new product releases.\n\n2 Absolutely Must-Know Japanese Counters\n\nThere are only two absolutely must-know Japanese counters. They are 〜つ and 個 (こ). Why only these two? In a way, they're magical. They can be used to count just about anything. If you are lazy, or if you don't know the correct counter for something, you can just use these and it will (probably) make sense.\n\nThe 〜つ Counter\n\nI've listed 〜つ as a counter, but actually it's just the original wago (Japanese) form of counting. If you don't know what wago counting is (it's not ichi, ni, san), check out our How To Count In Japanese guide.\n\nProbably thanks to the fact that this \"counter\" is just numbers, it can be used to count just about anything in Japanese. Things with shape, things without shape, abstract things, number order, little kids' ages, thoughts, ideas, and pretty much everything else. It's extremely versatile and helpful for when you don't know the specific counter for something.\n\nCounts: just about everything.\n\nAlthough the explanation \"it can count anything\" is pretty right on the money (and self-explanatory), you can read more about the counter 〜つ here.\n\nThe 個 (こ) Counter\n\nIt's important to compare the counter 個 with 〜つ to understand its limitations.\n\n個 is just the kango, a.k.a. Chinese version of 〜つ. Like 〜つ, you can count almost anything with this counter, though it's slightly less versatile. Think of it this way: if the thing you're counting has a boundary to it, you can use 個. If it doesn't have a distinct boundary, or it's too abstract, it's an age, or it's related to number order, it's more common to use 〜つ.\n\nCounts: pretty much anything with a distinct shape or boundary.\n\nIt's important to compare the counter 個 with 〜つ to understand its limitations (it's only almost as flexible as 〜つ), so I'd recommend you read our article on the counter 個.\n\n17 Must-Know Japanese Counters\n\nCongratulations! You've walked through the \"Absolutely Must-Know Counters\" group only to find yourself in the very similar \"Must-Know Counters\" group. We'll be covering seventeen Japanese counters in this section. The first eight follow regular pronunciation rules (本, 枚, 匹, 頭, 羽, 冊, 台, 分, 年 and 回), the other seven (日, 人, 月, 時, 時間, 階, and 歳) don't. For more information on pronunciation rules when counting with counters, look for our table in the big Japanese counters guide.\n\n本 (ほん)\n\nUsually, the 本 counter is taught as the counter for \"stick-shaped or long\" things. That covers most of its use, but 本 can actually count seven different categories of things, which we broke down in great detail in our 本 counter guide.\n\nCounts: pens, pencils, asparagus, soba, darts, firewood, trees, bamboo, cords, threads, dumplings, water wells, injections, folding fans, eels, tails, nail clippers, icicles, fishing rods, film, chimneys, tenugui, trains, sashes, telephone poles, cylindrical batteries, bottles, tires, ribbons, cacti, soda cans, and much, much more.\n\n枚 (まい)\n\nThe main thing that 〜枚 does is count flat things. With that, you'll be fine most of the time. This counter counts a really wide variety of things. Like 本, it is quite versatile considering it's a pretty specific counter. We wrote about the four categories of the counter 枚 in our 枚 counter article.\n\nCounts: paper, photos, rafts, bath mats, shells, playing cards, credit cards, t-shirts, pants, other clothes, dust cloths, walls, a single serving of soba, a single serving of gyoza, and much, much more.\n\n匹 (ひき)\n\nThe counter 〜匹 is used to count small or medium-sized animals. If you can pick the animal, fish, bird, or insect up, you can probably count it with 匹. For larger animals, 頭 (とう) is the more common counter, though for some reason Godzilla is still counted with 匹. Curious why? Read our article on the Japanese counter 匹 for a much more thorough explanation.\n\nCounts: dogs, cats, monkeys, fish, prawns, shrimps, lobsters, wolves, rabbits (unless they're counted with 羽), mosquitoes, shellfish, deer, worms, caterpillars, silkworms, earthworms, frogs, snails, crabs, tortoises, turtles, octopuses, animals, insects, dragonflies, sea otters, ogres, monsters, naughty children, animal-like people, etc.\n\n頭 (とう)\n\nAs we mentioned in the 匹 section, 頭 is generally used for large-sized animals. If you can't pick the animal up, chances are you could count it with 頭. That being said, there are some exceptions where 頭 is used for smaller animals, and 匹 gets used for bigger ones (like Godzilla). For more details and information on exceptions, read our article on the 頭 counter.\n\nCounts: cows, horses, livestock, elephants, gorillas, whales, camels, tigers, \"professional\" animals, insects on display, animals for sale, etc.\n\n羽 (わ)\n\nThe counter 羽 is used to count birds. 羽 by itself means wings, though you shouldn't use it to count insects. The only weird thing: you can count rabbits with 羽 as well! Learn all about this counter in the in-depth article we wrote about the counter 羽.\n\nCounts: chickens, ostriches, peacocks, penguins, other birds, also rabbits, origami cranes, etc.\n\n冊 (さつ)\n\nThe counter 冊 is used to count books. From the kanji, you can see it looks just like a book from the side. Don't confuse this with the counter 本 which, ironically, is not used to count books (even though the word 本 means \"book\"). This is a pretty straightforward counter, but you can still learn more by reading the in-depth article we wrote about it.\n\nCounts: books, book collections, albums, notebooks, memo pads, musical scores, catalogs, magazines, dictionaries, publications, documents, booklets, etc.\n\n台 (だい)\n\n台 is used to count a variety of fairly unrelated things, making it somewhat less straightforward than your average counter. It is used to count platforms you can stand or put things on, machines, cars, large instruments, and more. Check out our 台 counter article to learn more.\n\nCounts: playground slides, beds, tables, couches, harps, pianos, cellos, cars, trucks, motors, washing machines, dryers, ovens, air conditioners, microwaves, cellular phones, keyboards, and more.\n\n分 (ふん)\n\n分 is technically a unit for minutes, but it looks and smells like a counter (it follows all the same grammatical and reading rules). For each 分 you count, another minute has been counted. To read more about this counter/unit, check out our in-depth article all about 分.\n\nCounts: minutes (time/degree)\n\n日 (か/にち)\n\nThis is the counter for days. There's nothing particularly complicated about it, but the readings can be tricky because they are a mixture of wago and kango. You can learn all about it in our deep-dive article about the counter 日.\n\nCounts: days, specific days of the month\n\n年 (ねん)\n\n１年には３６５日ある。\n\nThere are 365 days in a year.\n\nThe 年 counter is used to count years (one year, two years, three years, etc.), but it can also be an ordinal number (first, second, third) for someone's grade in school. For example, １年 is grade one, ２年 is grade two, etc. That means the first year of high school/college/university would be １年, and a person who is in their first year is an 一年生 (いちねんせい), or \"first-year student.\" Unlike some of the other time-related Japanese counters, 年 just uses kango for its counting method. We cover all this in-depth in our giant article about the Japanese counter 年.\n\nCounts: years, grades\n\n回 (かい)\n\n回 is used to count the number of times something happens, or frequency. It's often translated to \"times\" because １回 is \"one time,\" １００回 is \"one hundred times.\" This isn't a multiplier, though. If you ate dinner ２回, you just ate dinner twice, you didn't eat twice as much dinner, necessarily. You can read much more about the Japanese counter 回 in our in-depth article.\n\nCounts: the number of times something happens, chances, opportunities, revolutions, etc.\n\n人 (り/にん)\n\nThe kanji 人 means \"person.\" The counter 人 follows suit by counting numbers of people. Beyond people, it can also count things we treat like people, such as fairies, elves, and even your pets, if you treat them like family. It goes much deeper than that, and you can learn more in the article we wrote about the 人 counter.\n\nIt's also important to note that the first two people (一人、二人) get counted using the wago counting method. Three people and up (三人) are just counted in kango.\n\nCounts: humans, people, angels, mermaids, Doraemon, humanoids, pets that are like family, etc.\n\n月 (つき/がつ)\n\n月 is a counter used to count the number of months (\"10 months\" is １０ヶ月) as well as identify the calendar month (\"October\" is １０月). Depending on what you're counting or how it's used, the way it gets read (つき vs げつ vs がつ) changes, so be aware of that. To read up on this counter, check out our full deep-dive into 月.\n\nCounts: months, calendar months\n\n時 (じ)\n\nLike 分 (minutes), this is not technically a counter, but instead a unit for hours. Usually, 時 is translated to \"o'clock\" as in \"twelve o'clock.\" There are some pronunciation exceptions you will need to consider too. This \"counter\" is extremely common and useful, so ideally you'll need to memorize the numbers 1–24 (you know, the number of hours that are in a day). Read all about the Japanese counter 時 in our deep-dive article.\n\nCounts: o'clock\n\n時間 (じかん)\n\nBy itself the word 時間 means \"time.\" As a counter, 時間 will count number of hours, as in \"three hours\" or \"twenty-four hours.\" You can learn way more about this counter in our in-depth 時間 article.\n\nCounts: hours\n\n階 (かい)\n\nThe 階 counter counts building floors. Which floor would you like to go up to? The 100th floor (１００階) or the 3rd floor (３階)? Or why don't you just forget all that and come on up to ４２階 instead?\n\nTake your knowledge of 階 to the next level (or floor) by reading our in-depth write-up about it.\n\nCounts: a building's floors\n\n歳 (さい)\n\nThe 歳 counter is used to count age. This works for people, animals, and more. Note that there is another (simpler) kanji for the same thing, which is 才. Technically they both make sense, but 歳 is more correct, if you're able to use it.\n\nCounts: age in years\n\n47 Common Japanese Counters\n\nThis section covers the counters we deemed as quite \"common\" or \"useful.\" Although they aren't part of the absolutely must-know list, they will enhance the quality of your day-to-day Japanese language life. They are still \"common,\" after all. Some are going to be everyday use, while others are less common but important to know for formal or specific situations. At some point, you'll need to learn all of these if you're serious about becoming fluent in Japanese.\n\n円 (えん)\n\nThis is the unit for the Japanese currency, the yen. You'd use this to count an amount of yen.\n\nCounts: yen\n\n箇月(かげつ)\n\n箇月 is the counter for the number of months. As in, \"for three months\" or \"in three months.\" More often, you'll see the hiragana か or a small ヵ or ヶ instead of the kanji 箇, which is actually just an archaic version of the counter 個!.\n\nCounts: number of months\n\n箇国 (かこく)\n\n箇国 is used to count the number of individual countries. If you're just generally counting countries, just the counter 国 will be fine. 箇国 emphasizes that they are individual and different. The kanji 箇 is often written with the hiragana か or a small ヵ or ヶ.\n\nCounts: individual countries\n\n箇所 (かしょ)\n\nThis counter is used to count places, spots, points, passages, etc. Basically any kind of place. The kanji 箇 is often written with the hiragana か or a small ヵ or ヶ.\n\nCounts: places, spots, points, passages, parts, typos, water supply points, movie theaters, shopping malls, toilets, mosquito bites, scars, broken parts of something, parts that need to be fixed, changed parts, dangerous areas, etc.\n\n缶 (かん)\n\nThis word means can (as in an aluminum can). Its reading is (coincidentally) \"kan,\" and it can be used to count cans. The first two cans can be counted with either wago or kango numbers. \"One can\" is １缶, read as either いっかん or ひとかん. \"Two cans\" is ２缶, read as either にかん or ふたかん. From three cans and up you use the kango counting method. When a can is empty—or when it's a garbage can—you'll generally want to use the counter 個 instead of 缶.\n\nCounts: soda cans, beer cans, tuna cans, bean cans, milk cans, spray cans, paint cans, tea leaves in tins, etc.\n\n巻 (かん)\n\nワンピースを３２巻買い揃えた。\n\nI bought thirty-two volumes of One Piece.\n\nThis is used to count volumes of a series of books, videotapes, cassette tapes, etc. It can also be used as an ordinal number suffix to show which item in a series it is. For example, ハリーポッターの１３巻目 is \"the thirteenth Harry Potter book in the series.\"\n\nCounts: volumes of books, cassette tapes, videotapes, DVDs, etc. that are in a series, and scrolls.\n\n曲 (きょく)\n\nThe word 曲 just means song. When used as a counter, it can count the number of songs.\n\nCounts: songs, music\n\n切れ (きれ)\n\n切る means \"to cut.\" The counter 切れ is used to count cut/sliced things (especially foods). You'll see this used to count slices of sashimi or filets of meat, for example.\n\nCounts: sliced pieces of fish (including sashimi), slices of meat, mochi (rice cakes), slices of bread, slices of cake, slices of pizza, slices of okonomiyaki, cuts of cheese, etc.\n\n口 (くち)\n\n口 by itself means \"mouth.\" When used as a counter, it counts \"bites.\" This is the main use case for this counter, but there are other meanings as well. Things like a set price of a contribution, submissions to a contest, bank accounts, and a \"share\" of insurance.\n\nCounts: bites (e.g., \"one bite of chicken\"), sips (e.g., \"one sip of strawberry milk\"), swords, suspended temple bells, submissions to win a prize, the set price of a contribution, a set donation amount, shares of insurance\n\n組 (くみ)\n\nThe 組 counter is used to count a set, a group, or a pair of something. For one and two groups, use the wago reading (ひとくみ, ふたくみ). From three on up, just use kango (さんくみ, よんくみ and so on).\n\nCounts: a couple of lovers, a couple of groups, a pair of earrings, a pair of gloves or mittens, a set of playing cards, a set of futon bedding, a set of stacked food boxes, a jacket and pants suit set, etc.\n\nQuite commonly, you'll see 組 used to categorize classrooms too. When it’s used this way, you just use kango. One class will be named ２組（にくみ） (second class group), another ８組（はちくみ） (eighth class group). If you're watching Japanese TV or reading Japanese manga, and someone's going to school, this will surely show up!\n\nNote that alphabets and words can also be paired up with 〜組 when used for a class group name. When paired with something else but numeral, the reading of 組 gets rendaku-ed, and becomes ぐみ as in A 組（ぐみ） (Class A) or キリン 組（ぐみ） (Class Giraffe).\n\nCounts: as an ordinal number suffix for a classroom number.\n\n件 (けん)\n\nThe word 件 means \"a matter\" or \"a case.\" As a counter, it counts those \"matters\" and \"cases.\" The definition is a bit vague, but that's because it covers a lot of categories. Check out the \"counts\" list for more details.\n\nCounts: proposals, suggestions, legislative bills, agenda items, projects, plans, crimes, incidents, scandals, complaints, objections, contracts, agreements, emails, financing, loans, troubles, bankruptcies, page views, Internet access numbers, voice mail messages, etc.\n\n軒 (けん)\n\nThe kanji itself means \"eaves\" (i.e., \"eaves of a house\"). As a counter it's used to count houses, buildings, shops, restaurants, farms, factories, and so on. It can also be used to count mailing addresses. If, for example, we sent WaniKani stickers to 100 people/addresses, we would say we sent stickers to １００軒.\n\nCounts: houses, shops, restaurants, warehouses, factories, farms, households, recipients, apartment buildings, apartments, hermitages, tenements, etc.\n\n語 (ご)\n\nThis counter is used to count words. For example, if this article has 30,000 words, you could say 30,000語. Alternatively, you can use the gairaigo counter ワード, though I think 語 is more common.\n\nCounts: words\n\n校 (こう)\n\n校 is used to count the number of schools. It can also be used to count the number of proofreading (校正) corrections.\n\nCounts: schools, elementary schools, pre-schools, junior high schools, secondary schools, private schools, public schools, high schools, colleges, universities, cram schools, proofreading corrections, etc.\n\n皿 (さら)\n\n皿 means \"dish\" or \"plate,\" referring to dishes or plates of food. For empty plates, you can still use 皿, but the counter 枚 will be more common for this. If you want to count individual pieces of food on the plate, you'll want to use 品 (しな). You can use 皿 to count laboratory dishes as well (like the ones that grow bacteria). For one and two plates, use the wago reading (ひとさら、ふたさら). Three can be either (みさら or さんさら). From four on up, just use kango.\n\nCounts: plates, dishes, lab dishes, food on a plate/dish, one serving of soba (usually cold), etc.\n\n試合 (しあい)\n\nThe word 試合 means \"game\" (generally referring to a sports game). This counter counts these games. You'll especially see this counter used for Japanese sports—foreign sports may use the gairaigo counter ゲーム instead.\n\nCounts: games, matches\n\n品 (しな/ひん)\n\n品 is used to count items, products, or dishes of food. In situations where it's pronounced しな, you'll want to use the wago counting method for one (一品/ひとしな) and two (二品/ふたしな). After that it's all kango. When pronounced as ひん, this counter just uses the kango counting method right from the start.\n\nCounts: dishes of food, a meal's course dish, items, products\n\n社 (しゃ)\n\nThe 社 counter is used to count companies (会社) or temples (神社).\n\nCounts: companies, publishers, newspaper companies, shrines etc.\n\n種類(しゅるい)\n\n種類 means \"variety,\" \"kind,\" \"type,\" etc., and the counter version is used to count those \"kinds\" of things.\n\nCounts: kinds, varieties, types\n\n週 (しゅう)\n\n１週間ずっと風邪で寝込んでいた。\n\nI had a cold and was in bed all week.\n\n週 is used to count weeks. Most of the time, you'll want to add the suffix 間 (かん) which changes \"week\" to \"for __ weeks.\" For example, ２週間 would mean \"for two weeks,\" and ５週間 would mean \"for five weeks.\"\n\nIf you add the ordinal number suffix 目 to 週 it identifies which week you're talking about. ３週目 means \"the third week,\" and １週目 means \"the first week.\" Alternatively, you could add the ordinal number prefix 第 (だい). 第１週 would mean \"the first week\" as well.\n\nCounts: weeks\n\n周 (しゅう)\n\n周 is used to count rounds. By that I mean circuits around a track, laps, revolutions, etc. Check out 回り/廻り/周り (all まわり) for something similar.\n\nCounts: the number of times you go around something, circuits, rounds, laps, rounds of golf, instances of traveling around something/somewhere, courses, revolutions etc.\n\n色 (しょく/いろ)\n\nThe kanji/vocabulary of 色 means \"color.\" The counter version just counts number of colors. A rainbow, for example, consists of seven colors. That would be 七色 (なないろ or ななしょく). Although the number of colors in a rainbow can be read two ways, generally when you count colors you'll just use the kango readings: いっしょく, にしょく, さんしょく, etc.\n\nCounts: colors\n\n席 (せき)\n\n席 means \"seat,\" and the counter version just counts seats. In addition to this, it can be used to count meetings or entertainment performances and rankings in a competition or contest. I've heard people pronounce the first two 席s as ひとせき and ふたせき, but it's more correct to use the kango counting method for all of them.\n\nCounts: seats, parties, banquets, performances, Rakugo performances, drinking parties, meetings, as an ordinal number suffix for ranking in a competition/contest, etc.\n\n戦 (せん)\n\nThis kanji refers to a war, a battle, or a match. The counter version counts matches, fights, battles, or even sports game matches.\n\nCounts: skirmishes in a war, sports fights, martial arts fights, real fights, matches, video game matches, sports games, games, board game matches, Chess matches, Shōgi matches, etc.\n\n足 (そく)\n\nThis kanji means foot/leg. As a counter it counts pairs of shoes, slippers, sandals, boots, socks, and so on. Basically things you put on your feet and legs.\n\nCounts: shoes, socks, stockings, slippers, zōri (Japanese sandals), tabi (Japanese socks), geta (wooden Japanese shoes), clogs, roller skates, rollerblades, ice skates, flip flops, boots, rain boots, sheets of dried squid, etc.\n\n束 (たば)\n\n束 means \"a bunch,\" or \"a bundle.\" Use wago for one and two bunches, either kango or wago for three bunches, and kango for four bunches and up. There's also another Japanese counter for bundles, 把 (わ), but that's for smaller bundles that can be held with one hand. The 把 counter is becoming uncommon and archaic, though.\n\nCounts: bundles of asparagus, soba noodles, firewood, scallions, green onions, ropes, konbu, noodles, incense sticks, papers, bills, bouquets, sets of newspapers or origami cranes, etc.\n\n玉 (たま)\n\n玉 means ball, bead, and even testicles. As a counter it's used to count round things, such as tomatoes, peaches, heads of lettuce, cabbage, and of course, testicles. It can also be used to count tangled balls of string, and other \"ball-shaped\" things, even if they're not ball-shaped when taken apart. For example, a ball of yarn could be counted with 玉. Or even a portion of noodles. Instead of 玉, though, it's probably more common to use the general counter 個. One exception to this is pachinko balls, which are pretty much always counted with 玉, no matter what.\n\nFor one or two balls, use the wago counting method (ひとたま, ふたたま). After that, it's all kango all the way.\n\nCounts: ball-shaped things; round fruit such as peaches, melons, watermelons, tomatoes, and persimmons; round vegetables such as onions, cabbage, lettuce, and even Chinese cabbage (despite it not being super round); balls of noodles such as yakisoba, udon, soba, ramen, and konnyaku noodles; balls of yarn, balls of wire, pachinko balls, etc.\n\n段 (だん)\n\nThis counter can count a variety of things, including stairs, steps, shelves, the number of drawers, layers, floors of a bunk bed, stages of a rocket, ranks in martial arts, paragraphs, and even columns. What do these things have in common? Despite being totally different, they also all have pretty distinct layers/levels to them, and they're organized vertically (for the most part).\n\nCounts: steps of stairs, shelves (when multiple shelves are installed vertically), cake tiers, bunk bed levels, drawers (when multiple drawers are installed vertically), stages such as rocket stages, martial arts ranks, Japanese calligraphy ranks, paragraphs, columns, etc.\n\n着 (ちゃく)\n\nThis counter is used to count clothes—one coat, ten skirts, etc. But, it is also the ordinal number suffix for first place, second place, etc., in a race. This is because the word 着く means \"to arrive.\" First place is the first to arrive, right? Anyways, as a regular counter, it's just about clothes.\n\nCounts: clothes or garments such as overcoats, coats, cloaks, kimono, yukata, suits, raincoats, dresses, skirts, jackets, swimsuits, costumes, robes, suits of armor, etc. It's also the ordinal number suffix for first, second, third, etc., place in a race.\n\n通 (つう)\n\n通 can count quite a few things, but they generally fall into the categories \"messages\" and \"official documents.\" Under messages, you get things like emails, letters, comments, telegrams, faxes, answering machine messages, job applications, and survey responses. Under official documents, you have things like bills, reports, licenses, passports, or bankbooks.\n\nCounts: written postcards, greeting cards, letters, mail, memos, notes, wills, telegrams, fax messages, written contracts, emails, job applications, sealed documents, official papers, bills, witness reports, work invoices, survey answer responses, driver's licenses, passports, bankbooks, school report cards, etc.\n\n粒 (つぶ)\n\nThe 粒 counter is used to count small, round things—usually quite small. Think in terms of little things you can pile up and collect in a jar or other container.\n\nCounts: manila clams, beans, peas, candy drops, umeboshi, teardrops, raindrops, water drops, caviar, fish roe balls, pills, tablets, grains of rice, other grains, raisins, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, grains of sand, rubies, small stones, pebbles, sea salt grains, seeds, almonds, other nuts, etc.\n\n点 (てん)\n\n高級時計５点が盗まれた。\n\nWe had 5 high-end watches stolen.\n\nThis word means \"dot\" or \"point.\" As a counter it's used to count items, scores, dots, points, fulcrums, and any kind of artwork including paintings, sculptures, literature, and even films. When counting scores, 点 can be applicable to the score of a sports game as well as your score on a test.\n\nCounts: dots, points, fulcrums; items and products such as accessories, curtains, furniture, vases, pottery, cloth, stuffed animals, and rings; artwork such as carvings, pictures, paintings, drawings, portraits, novels and other literature; test scores, sports game scores, eye drops, etc.\n\n度 (ど/たび)\n\nThe 度 counter has eight different use categories, but the most common one is \"number of times.\" It can also be used to count a degree angle, as well as degrees of temperature. Depending on what you use it for, 度 can be read as either ど or たび. The numbering system can either be wago or kango, depending on the number and what you're counting: it's kango for ど and wago for たび, but たび is only used to count up to the number three in modern Japanese.\n\nCounts: the number of times something happens, chances, opportunities, experiences, series of actions, divided actions, degrees, temperature, etc.\n\n杯 (はい)\n\n杯 is used to count liquids in cups or bowls. That means you can count things like bowls of soup, mugs of coffee, glasses of juice, measuring spoons of vanilla, measuring cups of chicken broth, and so on. In addition, you can use 杯 to count squid, cuttlefish, crabs, and sometimes octopuses. 杯 can also count ships, battleships, racing yachts, and other boats, but this usage isn't so common.\n\nCounts: bowls of rice, donburi, soba, ramen, udon, stew, curry, ochazuke, and so on; cups/glasses/mugs of milk, water, beer, whiskey, cocktails, juice, tea, coffee, and other drinks; octopuses, squid, crabs, various ships, etc.\n\n泊 (はく)\n\n泊 is used to count overnight stays or rentals. If you ever stay at a hotel, this will be a useful counter for you to know!\n\nCounts: number of overnight stays, number of overnights, number of overnight rentals\n\n箱 (はこ)\n\nThis word means \"box,\" and the counter version is used to count boxes. Pretty much any kind is fine. Boxes of diapers, sponge cake, snacks, tea leaves, etc. The only exception to this is small disposable wooden/cardboard boxes filled with sweets, a meal, or bento. These are counted with 折 (おり). When counting with 箱, use wago or kango for one and two. Sometimes use wago for three boxes, but mostly stick with kango. From four and above, use the kango counting method.\n\nCounts: cardboard boxes, wooden boxes, lunchboxes, boxes, boxes, boxes\n\n発 (はつ)\n\n発 counts bullets, bullet marks, explosives, fireworks, shots fired (including farts), and a lot more. There are even more details to learn in our full article on this counter.\n\nCounts: bullets, bullet marks, explosives, fireworks, shots fired, farts, punches, kicks, bombs, cannons, missiles, rockets, tennis shots, kendo attacks, baseball hits, home runs, sex, jokes, etc.\n\n番 (ばん)\n\n番 is an ordinal number suffix to show one's order, turn, or rank. If you're number one, you're 一番. It is common for 番 to be combined with another ordinal number suffix, 目 (め): 一番目, 二番目, etc. This shows the \"first\" and \"second\" (and so on) of something. The number fourteen bus, for example, would be １４番目.\n\nCounts: turns, orders, rank, numbers, Go/Shōgi/Chess matches, sumo matches, Noh theaters, verses of a song, etc.\n\n秒 (びょう)\n\n秒 is a unit of time used for seconds. It also can be used for angles, latitude, and longitude. The reading is all kango.\n\nCounts: seconds as a unit of time, angles, latitude, longitude\n\n便 (びん)\n\n便 is used to count the number of flights, boats shipping out, long-distance buses, etc. over a period of time. It can also be used as an ordinal number suffix for delivery or transportation. If you're referring to a flight number, for example, you could use this ordinal number suffix.\n\nCounts: flights, ships shipping out, long-distance bus trips, deliveries, instances of transportation, flight numbers, bus numbers, etc.\n\n袋 (ふくろ)\n\n袋 means bag, sack, or pouch. As a counter it counts those things. For one or two bags, use the wago counting scheme (ひとふくろ, ふたふくろ). After that use kango.\n\nCounts: bags, sacks, pouches, plastic bags, paper bags, shopping bags, garbage bags, etc. These bags can be filled with anything too: candy, snacks, rice, spinach, flowers, whatever.\n\n部屋 (へや)\n\nこの家には寝室が３部屋あります。\n\nThere are three bedrooms in this house.\n\n部屋 means \"room,\" and as a counter it counts rooms. For example, if you wanted to count the number of bathrooms in your house, you could use this. For one, two, and sometimes three rooms, use the wago counting method. Beyond that use kango.\n\nCounts: all rooms, like back rooms, closets, storage rooms, hotel rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, etc.\n\n歩 (ほ)\n\nThe kanji 歩 means \"walk.\" As a counter, 歩 counts steps. This can refer to both physical steps while you're walking as well as less physical steps of progress in a project, etc.\n\nCounts: steps taken while walking, steps of progress in your work, steps of progress in your education/learning, etc.\n\n名 (めい)\n\n名 is a counter for counting people that's more polite than the other person counter, 人. Another difference is that 名 can't be used as an ordinal number suffix like 人 can, so don't try to count the first, second, third (etc.) person. With this one, all you can do is count the number of people.\n\nCounts: number of people\n\n文字 (もじ)\n\n文字 means \"letters\" or \"characters,\" and it's used to count such things. You might use it to count morae (like syllables) in a haiku, but you wouldn't use it to count words in an article. For that, use the counter 字 instead, which also counts blank spaces. That being said, it's common to just use 文字 for this. Twitter's character count is written as１４０文字 instead of 字, so it's common enough where nobody would notice it's technically incorrect.\n\nCounts: letters, characters, morae in poetry\n\n問 (もん)\n\n問 is used to count questions or problems in a test, exam, quiz, textbook, etc. It can also be used with the ordinal number prefix 第 to indicate question number. For example, the third question on a quiz would be 第３問. You can do the same thing with the ordinal number suffix 目. The hundredth question would be １００問目.\n\nCounts: questions and problems in a quiz, test, exam, textbook, worksheet, etc.\n\n話 (わ)\n\nThis kanji means \"story\" or \"talk,\" and as a counter it's used to count stories. This can apply even to drama episodes on TV, as in \"three episodes (stories) of Seinfeld.\" Add the ordinal number suffix 目 or the ordinal number prefix 第 to indicate which story/episode you're talking about. The third story/episode is 第三話 or 三話目, for example.\n\nCounts: stories, episodes, drama episodes, manga chapters, anime episodes, narratives, myths, folk stories, folk tales, legends, etc.\n\n40 Somewhat-Common Japanese Counters\n\nWhat follows is a list (and a few examples) of forty somewhat-common Japanese counters. Although you won't come across these counters quite as often as the ones we've written about in detail, most Japanese speakers will know them and know how to use them. Since you'll come across them eventually, it's not a bad idea to learn them ASAP.\n\n案 (あん)\n\nThe 案 counter counts plans, ideas, projects, and strategies. While you can also use the 〜つ counter to count these things, you'll probably hear 案 used more often in business situations. Count all 案 numbers with kango.\n\nCounts: plans, ideas, projects, schemes, design ideas, strategies, plots, proposals, suggestions, concepts, bills, program ideas, trap ideas, etc.\n\n位 (い)\n\n位 is an ordinal number suffix that's used for classes, grades, ranks, decimal places, and orders (as in the result of a competition or race—this is actually its most common use case). You can also append the ordinal number prefix 第 onto it, as long as you note that it won't take the ordinal number suffix 目. Technically, it can also count the souls and ghosts of the deceased, though that's not common at all.\n\nCounts: ranks, classes, grades, orders, decimal places, souls, ghosts, etc.\n\n院 (いん)\n\nThe counter 院 counts organizations or institutions whose names end with 院, including hospitals (病院/びょういん), temples or mosques (寺院/じいん), government houses like 上院/じょういん (Upper House) or 下院/かいん (Lower House), etc. One exception is 美容院 (びよういん), beauty salons. Because they're shops, they're counted with 軒 (けん).\n\nCounts: hospitals, doctor's offices, clinics, temples, mosques, government houses, etc.\n\n駅 (えき)\n\nThe word 駅 means \"station,\" as in a train station. As a counter, it counts train and bus stations. For the first two of either of those, use the wago counting method: 一駅 is ひとえき, 二駅 is ふたえき. After that, use the kango. You can also use the general counter 〜つ to count stations, especially when you're speaking.\n\nCounts: train stations, bus stations\n\n枝 (えだ)\n\nThe word 枝 means \"branches,\" and as a counter, it's used to count branches too. It's most often used for branches with flowers, fruit, or elegant leaves on them. For bare branches, you can use the long stick Japanese counter 本 (ほん), and for one and two, count with the wago counting method. For the rest, use kango.\n\nCounts: branches with flowers, fruit, leaves\n\n園 (えん)\n\n昨年は、３園の動物園が閉園した。\n\nLast year, three zoos were closed.\n\nInstitutions that end with 園 or 園地 (えんち), such as zoos (動物園/どうぶつえん), botanical gardens (植物園/しょくぶつえん), theme parks (遊園地/ゆうえんち), gardens (庭園/ていえん), farms (農園/のうえん), orchards (果樹園/かじゅえん), kindergartens (幼稚園/ようちえん), or nursery schools/preschools (保育園/ほいくえん) all use the same counter. You'll see 園 mostly used in writing. When counting schools that use 学園 (がくえん), use either 学園 (がくえん) or 校 (こう) instead of just 園.\n\nCounts: zoos, botanical gardens, theme parks, farms, orchards, kindergartens, nursery schools, preschools, etc.\n\n折/折り (おり)\n\nYou can count folded items with 折 or 折り; the two versions are interchangeable. It begins with wago: one fold is 一折 (ひとおり), two folds is 二折 (ふたおり), and three folds is 三折 (either みおり or さんおり). After that, it's all kango. 折/折り is also used to count folded boxes that (usually) contain foods or sweets.\n\nCounts: folds, ekiben, bento in folded boxes, folded paper cranes, boxes of cakes, boxes of sweets, etc.\n\n音 (おん)\n\nThis counter is used to count sounds, such as syllables and/or musical notes.\n\nCounts: syllables, musical notes, musical scales, etc.\n\n課 (か)\n\nThis counter has two use cases. The first is counting sections of a company or organization, and the second is counting lessons. In Japan, it's not that common—you'll mainly see it in textbooks for Japanese learners.\n\nCounts: company/organization sections, departments, divisions, police divisions, office teams, lessons, etc.\n\n海 (かい)\n\nThe 海 kanji means \"sea\" or \"ocean.\" As a counter, it counts seas, as in \"seven seas\" (and we don't mean the movie theater in SpongeBob SquarePants).\n\nCounts: seas, oceans\n\n階級 (かいきゅう)\n\nThe word 階級 means class, rank, or grade. As a counter, 階級 counts those things, and can also be used as an ordinal number suffix.\n\nCounts: ranks, grades, classes\n\n回線 (かいせん)\n\nThe word 回線 means an electrical circuit or phone/Internet lines, as well as their connections. It's also used for counting such things.\n\nCounts: electrical circuits, phone lines, Internet lines, optical communication lines, TV circuits, cable TV circuits, Internet connections, etc.\n\n画 (かく)\n\nThe counter 画 is used to count kanji strokes. It can also be used to count divisions of land, lots, blocks, etc.\n\nCounts: kanji strokes, plots of land, divisions of land, blocks of land, etc.\n\n片 (かけ)\n\nニンニク２片と生姜２片を入れてください。\n\nPut in two cloves of garlic and two pieces of ginger.\n\nThe 片 counter is used to count broken-up, random pieces of something. In cooking, for example, it's common to use 片 to count cloves of garlic or \"fingers\" of ginger. And, while small pieces of bread would be counted with 片, slices of bread would not. (Keep reading, though…) As with many Japanese counters, use the wago reading for one and two, wago/kango for three, and kango for the rest.\n\nCounts: garlic cloves, \"fingers\" of ginger, pieces of bread, apple pieces, etc.\n\n欠片 (かけら)\n\nLike 片, this counter is used to count pieces of something. In this case, however, it's more for random, broken-off pieces. Using the example above, you would use 欠片 to count bread slices. Like 片, count one and two with the wago counting method, three with either wago or kango, and higher with kango only.\n\nCounts: shards of glass, slices of bread, garlic cloves, pieces of ginger, pieces of anything, etc.\n\n籠 (かご)\n\nThe word 籠 means basket, and its counter counts baskets and/or piles of whatever is inside a basket (like a basketful of oranges). Use the wago counting method for one, two, and sometimes three; kango for three and higher.\n\nCounts: baskets, baskets of something, bird cages, etc.\n\n塊 (かたまり)\n\nHave you ever wondered, \"What does 'katamari' from Katamari Damacy mean?\" You've come to the right place! \"Katamari\" means \"ball,\" \"lump,\" or \"mass,\" which is exactly what the Prince is rolling up. The kanji 塊 means a lump, ball, or mass of something, and the counter version is used to count those things. Use the wago counting method for one and two lumps, then kango for any above that. (And, since you're curious, \"damacy\" means \"soul\" or \"spirit.\")\n\nCounts: balls, masses, lumps or chunks of meat, clouds, people, dirt, cheese, fish, etc.\n\n河川 (かせん)\n\nAlthough the word 河川 means \"river,\" and the counter version counts rivers as well, it's a bit formal. For regular or casual situations, it's okay to use 本 to count rivers.\n\nCounts: rivers\n\n画素 (がそ)\n\n画素 is a unit for pixels and a counter for them too. You can use the gairaigo counter ピクセル as well, but 画素 is more common in Japanese.\n\nCounts: pixels\n\n方 (かた)\n\nYou already know that 人 is used to count people. 方 does too, but in a more polite way: in an office setting, for example. For one, two, and three people, you'll want to attach the prefix 御 (お). For four or more people, you don't need to attach 御. Use wago for one person and two people, kango for three and above. Keep in mind that if you use 方 for four or more people, it will sound strange—for that, it's okay to revert to 人. You can also refer to a group of people of an unknown number using 方—a group of sensei (teachers), for example, could be せんせい方.\n\nCounts: people (formal)\n\n株 (かぶ)\n\nThe 株 counter counts plants with roots, tree stumps, clusters of mushrooms, and shares of stock in a company. Use the wago counting method for one and two, then kango from three on up.\n\nCounts: plants with roots, tree stumps, clusters of mushrooms, seedlings, stocks, stock certificates, etc.\n\n冠 (かん)\n\nThis kanji means \"crown,\" and you use it to count wins or titles. For example, a Triple Crown winner would be a 三冠王 (さんかんおう)—a \"three-crown king.\"\n\nCounts: wins, victories, championships, crowns, etc.\n\n貫 (かん)\n\n１貫は３.７５ｋｇです。\n\nOne kan is 3.75 kg.\n\n貫 is the Japanese counter for pieces of nigiri sushi. 貫 was originally an old Japanese unit for weight—3.75 kg, about the average weight of a newborn baby—as well as a unit for money: １０００文 was equal to １貫 in the Edo period, and １０銭 equalled １貫 in the Meiji period. Historical dramas and old texts aside, in modern times, you'll see 貫 used for 🍣 .\n\nCounts: sushi, nigiri, archaic units of weight and money\n\n館 (かん)\n\nThis counts institutions ending with 館, such as art galleries or art museums (美術館), libraries (図書館), museums (博物館), or aquariums (水族館). You'll especially see it used in writing.\n\nCounts: art galleries, art museums, libraries, museums, aquariums, photo studios, etc.\n\n基 (き)\n\nThe counter 基 has six usage categories, all of which have to do with counting installed things that are big or hard to move. From torii gates to airplane engines, wind power generators, gondolas, sprinklers, ancient tombs, and a whole lot more. Learn more about this counter in our in-depth article.\n\nCounts: pyramids, ancient tombs, tombstones, gravestones, coffins, moai statues, torii gates, gates, mikoshi, butsudan, pagodas, stupas, buildings of a Buddhist temple, towers, stone lanterns, street lights, traffic lights, lighthouses, benches, sprinklers, playground equipment, public toilets, the remains of a house, oil tanks, gas tanks, turrets, launch pads, pillars, bridge piers, dams, nuclear reactors, wind power generators, airships, airplanes, helicopters, satellites, blimps, jets, hot air balloons, airplane engines, gondolas, chimneys, fireplaces, air conditioners, bridges, kotatsu, fish fins, elevators, escalators, sculptures, etc.\n\n機 (き)\n\n機 is generally associated with air transportation and is used to count things like airplanes, helicopters, and even guided missiles. Another similar counter, 台, is more associated with ground transportation.\n\nCounts: airplanes, airships, jets, blimps, hot air balloons, helicopters, guided missiles, airplane crew, etc.\n\n期 (き)\n\n期 is a fairly formal counter used to enumerate terms and periods. For example, the term length of a US President is four years and up to two terms (２期).\n\nCounts: school terms, terms of office, terms of service, stages, phases, sessions (as in a parliamentary cycle), etc.\n\n客 (きゃく)\n\nThe counter 客 is used to count things you use only on special occasions—when you have guests (お客様/おきゃくさま) visiting, for example. Think of it like \"bringing out the good china for your mother-in-law.\" Be aware that 客 isn't just used for plates and cups; it can count fancy cushions and any other special items brought out for visitors.\n\nCounts: special bowls, cups, wine glasses, soup bowls, zabuton, any other special items brought out for guests\n\n脚 (きゃく)\n\nThe kanji 脚 means \"leg\" or \"foot.\" As a counter, one of the things 脚 can be used to count are pieces of furniture with long-ish legs, including chairs, tables, and so on. (Short-legged furniture, like beds or couches, are generally counted using 台.) But, 脚 can count long-legged non-furniture items as well: wine glasses, horseshoes, and… legs. In Japanese, a three-legged race is 二人三脚—literally, \"two people three legs.\"\n\nCounts: chairs, tables, desks, wine glasses, horseshoes, legs, etc.\n\n級 (きゅう)\n\n級 can be a counter or an ordinal number suffix. It's used for grades, classes (referring to levels/ranks), or ranks. Ever done any Japanese martial arts with a series of \"kyū\" ranks? Those are 級s. Similarly, levels of the JLPT test (1–5) are 級s as well. The counter can also be used to count a couple of other (very) random things listed below…\n\nCounts: ranks, grades, classes, stone steps, decapitated heads\n\n球 (きゅう)\n\nピッチャー第１球投げました。\n\nThe pitcher threw the first ball.\n\nBesides light bulbs and flower bulbs, 球 is used to count baseball pitches and certain other actions and equipment in ball-oriented games. And while it's used a lot in sports, 球 becomes a little more formal in other contexts. Combining it with the ordinal number prefix 第 or the ordinal number suffix 目 allows you to count the numbers of baseball pitches, as in: \"This is the thirtieth pitch he's thrown.\"\n\nCounts: baseball pitches, light bulbs, flower bulbs, golf balls, soccer balls, tennis balls, tennis shots, ping pong shots, volleyballs, volleyball shots, etc.\n\n行 (ぎょう)\n\nThe word 行 refers to a line of writing or a verse in a poem. As a counter, it counts them as well. Easy!\n\nCounts: lines of writing, lines in a notebook, lines of a manuscript, verses of a poem, etc.\n\n局 (きょく)\n\nThe Japanese counter 局 is used to count matches of certain games: shōgi (Japanese chess), go, or sugoroku, which is similar to backgammon. Additionally, 局 can count broadcast stations and post offices.\n\nCounts: shōgi, go, and sugoroku matches, broadcasting stations, post offices, etc.\n\n斤 (きん)\n\nLong ago, 斤 was a unit of measurement that equaled 600 grams. Later, in the Meiji period, that unit became 454 grams, which happens to be one pound. Loaves of bread at the time weighed about 454 grams, although Japanese bread now tends to weigh about 300 grams. Even though the Japanese version has been losing weight, 斤 can be used for counting it and other loaves of bread.\n\nCounts: loaves of (regular) bread\n\n金 (きん)\n\n結婚指輪は２４金です。\n\nThe wedding ring is 24k gold.\n\nThe 金 counter means karat, i.e., the measure of the purity of gold. Eighteen karats—or 18K, as written in English—would be １８金 in Japanese. Don't confuse this counter with the similar word, 金 (also きん), which means \"gold,\" or お金 (おかね), which means \"money.\"\n\nCounts: karats of gold\n\n句 (く)\n\nThis counter is used for counting haiku, phrases, expressions, or passages of writing.\n\nCounts: haiku, expressions, passages of writing, words, phrases, etc.\n\n区 (く)\n\nIf you've ever seen a Japanese address written out, there's a good chance it had a 区 somewhere in it. That's because as a word, 区 means ward, zone, or constituency. 区 can also refer to a segment of a race, which, if you think about it, is actually a \"zone\" of a race. When used as a counter, 区 counts all those things.\n\nCounts: plots of land, wards, zones, constituencies, segments of a race\n\n区画 (くかく)\n\nSimilar to 区, the word 区画 refers to a division, plot or lot of land, or a block. As a counter, it also counts those things.\n\nCounts: plots of land, divisions of land, a block, etc.\n\n串 (くし)\n\nAs a word, 串 means \"skewer,\" and as a counter it counts food that comes on skewers. Use the wago readings for one and two skewers, kango or wago for three, and straight kango for all the rest.

You'll see a few in the examples below.\n\nCounts: habits, peculiarities, one's ways\n\n軍 (ぐん)\n\n<! Inline 1: two little plastic green army men>\n\nThe kanji 軍 refers to army troops. As a counter, 軍 used to count them too, though in recent years it has expanded to include other similar kinds of groups. For example, 軍 is used as an ordinal number suffix to refer to levels in organized sports: a varsity team would be 一軍, while a junior varsity or a \"farm\" team would be 二軍. It makes sense if you think about it, since sports teams have a lot of similarities to military troops.\n\nCounts: army groups, groups of troops, sports team levels, baseball team levels, etc.\n\n敵国の３軍がこちらへ向かっているそうだ。\n\nI hear three enemy army troops are headed our way.\n\n２軍から１軍に昇進した。\n\nI was promoted from the farm team to the main team.\n\n景 (けい)\n\n景 is used to count scenic views described in writing, as well as scenes in a play. For example, \"Act II, Scene III\" would be 第二幕第三景. These days, however, using 景 to count scenes is really only used in traditional Japanese performances such as kabuki and noh—for modern plays, use 場.\n\nCounts: views, scenic views, scenery, scenes in a kabuki/noh/opera\n\n日本３景といえばどことどことどこですか？\n\nWhere are the three best views in Japan?\n\n世界のロマンチックな景色１００景を集めた写真集を出版した。\n\nI published a photo book of a hundred romantic scenic views of the world.\n\n桁 (けた)\n\nThe word 桁 refers to a digit or decimal place in a number, as in \"the third decimal place of pi.\"\n\nCounts: digits, decimal places\n\n円周率、３６桁まで言えるんだ。\n\nI can list pi up to thirty-six decimal places!\n\nジャマールの貯金は６桁あるらしいぜ。\n\nApparently, Jamal's savings is in the six digits.\n\n鍵 (けん)\n\n<!

(For middle and high school, you can also use the counter 時限/じげん alone or with 目 here to make 1時限目, 2時限目, …)\n\nCounts: college class periods, university class periods\n\n月曜日は１限しか授業がありません。\n\nI only have first period on Mondays.\n\n３限目が休講になった。\n\nMy third period class was canceled.\n\n戸 (こ)\n\nThe word 戸 means \"door.\" What has doors?

If you're counting buildings in general, regardless of whether or not they're home to the people inside, use the counter 軒 (けん) instead.\n\nCounts: houses, homes, houses for sale, houses for rent, houses to be constructed, apartment units, etc.\n\n新築マンションが１２戸売りに出されている。\n\nTwelve new apartment units are for sale.\n\n強風に煽られ、１０戸が延焼した。\n\nFanned by strong winds, the fire spread to ten other houses.\n\n行 (こう)\n\n<! Inline 3: a sign that says \"The Tofugu Group\">\n\n行 is used to count banks (銀行/ぎんこう) as institutions. To count branches of a single bank, use 店 (てん) or 店舗 (てんぽ) instead.\n\n行 also counts other things. For example, 一行 used to refer to a group of twenty soldiers, and while this usage isn't as common as it used to be, you'll still hear it used when counting groups or parties of people. 観光客一行 (かんこうきゃくいっこう), for example, is used to count parties of tourists.\n\nSimilarly, you may see hotels and ryokan with welcome signs that make use of 行 to indicate groups of people—something like トーフグ御一行様 (とーふぐごいっこうさま): \"The Tofugu Group.\"\n\nCounts: banks, groups of people, parties of people\n\nその年は、５行の銀行が倒産した。\n\nThat year five banks went bankrupt.\n\nトーフグ御１行様がご到着です。\n\nThe Tofugu party has arrived.\n\n項 (こう)\n\nThe counter 項 is used to count the clauses in an article or legal document.

Inline 4: a rice cooker>\n\nAs a unit of measurement, 合 is equal to about 0.18 liters, or about 1/10th of a 升 (しょう), and you can use it to count cups of rice. When a rice cooker or recipe calls for \"a cup of rice,\" it might be asking for one of these instead of a standard \"cup.\" 合 is also used for counting the stages of a mountain trail: the first stage, or first 1/10th of the path, would be １合. You can count other things using 合, but these are the most common.\n\nCounts: 0.18 liter \"cups\" of rice, 1/10th stages of a hiking trail\n\n毎朝ご飯を３合炊きます。\n\nWe cook three cups of rice every morning.\n\n富士山の５合目までは車で登れます。\n\nYou can climb to the halfway point of Mt.

This counter uses the wago counting scheme for one and two, but three and above are rare, so focus on ひとこえ and ふたこえ. 声 is part of an idiom worth learning too: もう一声, which means \"a little more of a discount.\" It's handy when you want to barter!\n\n声 (せい) is also used to count the number of sounds, noises, or words that come out of something—usually a mouth. The せい version is counted with kango.\n\nCounts: utterances, having a word with someone, crying out, calling out, sounds, noises, words, etc.\n\n１声かけてくれれば良かったのに。\n\nYou should have said something to me.\n\nお兄ちゃん、もう１声か２声安くしてよ。\n\nCan you give me a little more of a discount, mister?\n\n久しぶりにあったのに第一声がそれかよ。\n\nWe haven't seen each other in so long and the first thing you say is that?!\n\n遠くの方から、汽車の汽笛が一声聞こえてきた。\n\nI could hear the lone whistle of a locomotive from far away.\n\n国 (こく)\n\n<!

You may also see 箇国 or ヶ国, which are used when the speaker or writer is emphasizing a single country.\n\nCounts: countries\n\n三国協定が結ばれたのはいつですか？\n\nWhen was the Triple Entente concluded?\n\n人に使われる人間ではなく、一国一城の主になりたいんです。\n\nRather than being used by someone, I'd like to be the king of my own castle.\n\n言 (こと)\n\n私はいつも１言多い。\n\nI'm always saying one word too many.\n\nThe kanji 言 means \"say,\" and as a counter it's used to count words you say or write.

Inline 6: a book>\n\nThis Japanese counter is used to count works of art (作品/さくひん), which extends to film and literature. To specify if it's the first, second, etc. work, just add the ordinal number prefix 第 or the ordinal number suffix 目.

The same goes for the strips of fish, on display at restaurants, that haven't yet been sliced into bite-sized pieces.\n\nYoung people have started using 柵 to count blocks of seats in stadiums and concert halls. In this context, 柵 usually indicates the seats closest to the stage or field where, back in the day, there was once a fence or divider. (柵 means \"fence.\")\n\nWhile both the kanji 柵 or 冊 can be used, 柵 is technically more correct. Writing さく in hiragana is common too—just make sure to use the wago counting method for one and two and kango for three or more.\n\nCounts: strips or blocks of fish, rows of a stadium, rows of a concert hall, rows of an auditorium, etc.\n\n今日は鯛が１柵も無いんですよ。\n\nWe don't have any blocks of sea bream today.\n\n2柵目の席をゲットした。\n\nI got a seat in the second row from the front!\n\n刺し (さし)\n\n刺す means \"to stab\" or \"to thrust.\" The counter version counts stabs—whether whatever is getting stabbed is being stung by bees, pierced with spears, or happens to be bites of food spiked onto skewers. 🍢\n\nCounts: stabs, stings, thrusts, pierces, pricks, bites, something(s) on a skewer\n\nその海賊は、悪魔を１刺しで死に追いやった。\n\nThat pirate put the demon down with a single thrust.\n\n目刺しを３刺し食べました。\n\nI ate three sardine skewers.\n\n匙 (さじ)\n\n<! Inline 7: a spoon>\n\n匙 means \"spoon,\" and the counter version is used to count the amount a spoon will hold. 大匙 (おおさじ)—literally \"big spoon\"—is a tablespoon. 小匙 (こさじ)—\"little spoon\"—is a teaspoon. Be careful, though: like \"cups\" (合), the amount a spoon can hold may vary from county to country. Use wago for counting one and two, either wago or kango for three, and kango for four and above.\n\n(Also, be aware that although 匙 is still in use, the counter 杯 (はい) is more commonly used for spoonfuls these days.)\n\nCounts: spoonfuls\n\n砂糖は１匙でいいですか？\n\nIs just one spoonful of sugar okay?\n\n今日の離乳食のメニューは、お粥３匙、にんじん２匙、かぼちゃ１匙としらす１匙です。\n\nToday's baby food menu is three spoons of rice porridge, two spoons of carrot puree, one spoon of squash puree, and one spoon of sardine paste.\n\n莢 (さや)\n\nThe word 莢 means \"pod,\" \"hull,\" or \"the shell of a pea.\" The counter version counts them all. While it's more common to use the general counter 〜つ or 個, you'll still see 莢 used.

Inline 8: a tooth>\n\nThe kanji 歯 means \"tooth,\" and this counter is used to count teeth.

For example, 第一次世界大戦 (だいいちじせかいたいせん) is the First World War, and 第二次世界大戦 (だいにじせかいたいせん) is the Second World War. For anything that has a specific sequence, 次 indicates where in that sequence it happened. This includes events, affairs, occurrences, and incidents.\n\nCounts: order of events, order of affairs, order of occurrences, order of incidents, etc.\n\nこれは第２次世界大戦の時の写真です。\n\nThese are photos from World War II.\n\n１次試験に合格した。\n\nI passed the first of the exams.\n\n児 (じ)\n\n<!

If you cooked 1升 of rice, that would be a lot of rice—twenty servings, more or less! Thus 升 is what is now called \"party size.\" The same goes for sake: those little tokkuri bottles usually hold one or two 合, while a 1升 bottle is huge—1.8L!

Simple. It's how the police count when they do a background check on you for (say) that job you really wanted. They verify up to the third degree (3親等), so hopefully your great-grandpappy wasn't a shoplifter!\n\nCounts: degrees of relation between relatives\n\n1親等の親族って、通常は誰のことを指すんですか？\n\nWhich relatives are generally considered to be in the first degree of kinship?\n\n兄弟姉妹は2親等です。\n\nSiblings are in the second degree of kinship.\n\n図 (ず)\n\nThis word means a diagram, illustration (figure), chart, or graph, and counts them when they appear in writing.
