        "text": "With all the pageantry on display for the release of the two “Rebel Moon” films (and their respective director’s cuts), there’s been a distinct lack of discussion around filmmaker Zack Snyder’s other Netflix franchise, “Army of the Dead.” Well, apparently, that’s for a good reason.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Wrap, it has been confirmed that the planned expansion of the “Army of the Dead” franchise, which would include new films and an animated series, have been quietly canceled over at Netflix.\n\nREAD MORE: Zack Snyder Is “A Little Tapped Out” With VFX & Wants To Do “Something Small” For His Next Film\n\nWhen asked about that, Zack Snyder replied, “We are very ambitious with everything.”\n\nHe’s definitely not wrong. When “Army of the Dead” was released, they quickly moved forward with the franchise, releasing a spinoff film, “Army of Thieves.” From there, more films and an animated series were all teased by Snyder and the folks involved. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the plug is pulled on the franchise. The only thing “Army of the Dead”-related in the works is a themed experience coming to Six Flags this Halloween.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Twilight Of The Gods’ Teaser: Zack Snyder’s Epic Fantasy Animated Series Arrives In September\n\nAgain, it’s unclear why the “Army of the Dead” franchise has been canceled. When the first film was released, Netflix raved about how many people watched it. The same thing happened when the first “Rebel Moon” film was released late last year. So, if people are watching these things, why does Netflix not want to expand it? And if “Rebel Moon” was watched by millions of people, why does it feel like Netflix is quietly canceling that too? Obviously, there are more things to take into consideration when greenlighting a sequel than just viewership of the original.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t paint a very confident picture about what might happen to “Rebel Moon” in the future. The new Snyder sci-fi epic films both received pretty terrible reviews, both from critics and regular viewers on Rotten Tomatoes. So, if “Army of the Dead” can’t survive, it doesn’t leave much hope for “Rebel Moon.” But that’s just pure speculation.\n\nYou can watch the “Rebel Moon” director’s cuts now on Netflix."
