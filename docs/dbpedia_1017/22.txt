Star Soldier is a shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Family Computer and the MSX. The player pilots the starship 'Caesar', travelling through space stations occupied by powerful supercomputers known as 'Starbrains' who threaten the galactic empire. Star Soldier greatly resembles the earlier arcade game Star Force.

Star Soldier has spawned numerous sequels, starting with Super Star Soldier on the PC Engine. It was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2004 in Japan as part of the Famicom Mini series, and to the Wii's Virtual Console in the Japanese and North American regions in July 2007. An enhanced remake of the game was released on PlayStation Portable only in Japan in 2005.
