Braille alphabets used in Nigeria

Several braille alphabets are used in Nigeria. For English, Unified English Braille has been adopted. Three other languages have been written in braille: Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba. All three alphabets are based on English readings, with the addition of letter's particular to these languages. Punctuation is as in English Braille.

Hausa is presumably written in braille in Niger as well, since Ethnologue 17 reports that Zarma is written in braille in that country. However, this need not mean it uses the same alphabet as Nigerian Hausa.
