However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nZodiac sign or Sun sign\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

When choosing a name for your baby, knowing its phonemic pronunciation gives an idea about the name’s sound pattern and auditory appeal. You can assess the name’s ease of pronunciation, memorability, and softness. Here is the phonemic transcription of Bharati in American and British accents.\n\nIn American English: /bʰɑːrʌti/\n\nIn British English: /bɑːrɑːti/\n\nPronunciation of names, in fact, any spoken word, involves the participation of various parts of the mouth, vocal cord, nose, and lungs. Underneath all the sounds we make is the airstream flowing from the lungs and moving up to the mouth. It’s incredible how lips, tongue, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, glottis, and larynx work harmoniously to bring out the words. Studies have proved that positive sounds like OM (AUM) help maintain hormonal balance and mental health and reduce stress and anxiety. So, what parts does Bharati trigger?
