Zines are handmade self-publications featuring text, imagery, or a combination of the two. This year, the Braille Institute Library launched a brand-new zine making class, where students learned to assemble their very own zines. Giselle H., who has been a Los Angeles Center student for the past nine years, created a zine titled “Jumbo: The Pros and Cons of a Seeing Eye Elephant\" inspired by her friend Wendy. Giselle uses colored paper and yarn to add lively illustrations to her zine. Watch and follow along with Giselle's zine and enjoy the humorous story of Jumbo’s new job as a seeing eye elephant! This Sunday, August 25th, from 11am to 4pm, Giselle's zine will be on display along with other Braille Institute students' work at the Armory Zine Fest in Pasadena. Check out our students’ work, support other local zinesters, and enjoy free arts and crafts activities at this inaugural event hosted by the Armory Center for the Arts. Thank you to the Radical Librarianship Institute at UCLA and the Mellon Foundation for making this program possible!

Stephen Nedoroscik, the U.S. men's gymnastics pommel horse specialist, helped end a 16-year medal drought with an incredible bronze medal performance. Last Monday, Nedoroscik nailed his routine without his glasses, relying on the feel and flow of his movements. “The thing about pommel horse is like you’re using your hands the whole time,” Nedeoroscik tells CNN. “You’re feeling how your center of mass sort of swivels around. I don’t see. I don’t need to see to see what I’m doing… I’m just doing it by how it feels.” Nedoroscik has strabismus, or misalignment of the eyes, and coloboma, a loss of tissue in a part of the eye.

In this virtual eight week program, students will join a community of passionate braille readers to level up their writing skills. We offer two tracks: Academic and Creative Writing. Participants will learn directly from experts in the fields, collaborate with their peers, and renew their excitement for the famous six-dot system! In the Academic track, students will learn from researchers like Professor Simon Fischer-Baum. We’ll tackle personal statements, undergraduate admissions, accommodation requests, research, and more. In the Creative Writing track, led by an Antioch University Masters of Fine Arts candidate with experience writing different genres, students will be delving into everything from screenwriting to poetry. Students will develop their own unique writing voice, practice workshopping their pieces, and learn to bring their characters to life. To register, just complete this form: https://lnkd.in/g6Z-uz35 While the Writing Workshop is only open to Braille Challenge participants in grades 10-12, the survey is open to students in grades 7-12. By the way, participants who complete the survey by August 16th will be entered for a chance to win a $25 Amazon gift card!
