And blood, a slick, still wet pool on the crisp white sheets. Afraid to call the police -- she's a single woman alone in a hotel room far from home -- Cassie begins to lie.

Having spent years undoing the damage and salvaging her lost girlhood, she is haunted by the violence of men, seldom dressing the way she wants in public.

Is this my fault for striving to be the perfect man and excelling at it? \"I'm Afraid of Men\" is a culmination of the years Vivek spent observing men and creating her own version of manhood.

Lindsay Wong grew up with a paranoid schizophrenic grandmother and a mother who was deeply afraid of the woo-woo - Chinese ghosts who come to visit in times of personal turmoil. From a young age, she witnessed the woo-woo's sinister effects. At the age of six, she found herself living in the food court of her suburban mall, which her mother saw as a safe haven because they could hide there from dead people, and on a camping trip, her mother tried to light Lindsay's foot on fire to rid her of the woo-woo. The eccentricities take a dark turn, however, when her aunt, suffering from a psychotic breakdown, holds the city of Vancouver hostage for eight hours when she threatens to jump off a bridge. And when Lindsay starts to experience symptoms of the woo-woo herself, she wonders whether she will suffer the same fate as her family.

In the stunning poems of \"Settler education,\" Graham explores the Plains Cree uprising at Frog Lake - the death of nine settlers, the hanging of six Cree warriors, the imprisonment of Big Bear, and the opening of the Prairies to unfettered settlement. In ways possible only with such an honest act of imagination, and with language at once terse and capacious, she reckons with how these pasts repeat and reconstitute themselves in the present. Poems from this book won the 2013 Thomas Morton Poetry Prize. 2016.\n\n2435316 Violet energy ingots by Hoa Nguyen. 1 volume of Braille (84 pages). What our lives permit us to perceive as givens, Nguyen reveals as mere conditions, inextricably tied to and guided by greater forces - from the economy to the environment, from the Mayan predictions to the menstrual cycle, from the weight of history to the burden of the future. The poems contain a sense of dis-ease, rupture, things frayed, and grief as love shimmers the edges.

In a sequence of five feverish elegies, Ridley combines narrative lyric and experimental verse styles to manifest dark themes related to love and loss: the traumas of psychological suffering (isolation and confinement), physical abuse (by parent and partner), terminal illness (brain tumour and heart attack), revelation, resolution, and healing. With a blend of fervour and sangfroid, these serial poems accrue into a book-length testament to a grief both personal and human, leaving readers with the redemptive grace that comes from poetry's ability to wrestle chaos into meaning. Because of its overarching themes and serial form, \"Silvija\" is best read cover-to-cover, analogous to a work of fiction, rather than a book of individual or occasional poems. 2016.\n\n2414510 Rag cosmology by Erin Robinsong. 1 volume of Braille (88 pages). In this time of ecological precarity, \"Rag cosmology\" is an urgent invitation to reinvent our modes of engagement with the environment we not only inhabit, but are. Refusing the lamentation that leaves us as resigned witnesses to devastation, \"Rag cosmology\" counters fatalist narratives with the pleasures of ecological entanglement and engagement. Tracing relationships between seemingly irreconcilable things - economy and ecology, weather and lust, bills and inner voices, wages of avoidance and wages of listening - these poems offer the intimate and lush language of thought that yearn for an imaginative reinvention of how we understand what we are part of and what we are losing. Winner of the 2017 A.M. Klein Prize for Poetry (QWF). 2017.\n\nNative peoples\n\n2866970 A mind spread out on the ground by Alicia Elliott. 1 volume of Braille (351 pages). In an urgent and visceral work that asks essential questions about Native people in North America while drawing on intimate details of her own life and experience with intergenerational trauma, Alicia Elliott offers indispensable insight and understanding to the ongoing legacy of colonialism. What are the links between depression, colonialism and loss of language - both figurative and literal? How does white privilege operate in different contexts? How do we navigate the painful contours of mental illness in loved ones without turning them into their sickness? How does colonialism operate on the level of literary criticism? \"A mind spread out on the ground\" is Alicia Elliott's attempt to answer these questions and more. In the process, she engages with such wide-ranging topics as race, parenthood, sexuality, love, mental illness, poverty, sexual assault, gentrification, writing and representation. Elliott makes connections both large and small between the past and present, the personal and political - from overcoming a years-long history with head lice to the way Native writers are treated within the Canadian literary industry; her unplanned teenage pregnancy to the history of dark matter and how it relates to racism in the court system; her childhood diet of Kraft dinner to how systematic oppression is linked to depression in Native communities. With deep consideration and searing prose, Elliott extends far beyond her own experiences to provide a candid look at our past, an illuminating portrait of our present and a powerful tool for a better future. Bestseller. 2019.\n\nPolitics and government\n\n2865443 Power, prime ministers, and the press: the battle for truth on Parliament Hill by Robert Lewis. 1 volume of Braille (721 pages). The history of the Press Gallery is rich in anecdotes and insights about the people on Parliament Hill who have covered our leaders for more than 150 years. Mining the archives and his own interviews, former Maclean's editor-in-chief Robert Lewis turns the spotlight on the watchers, including reporters who got too close to Sir John A. Macdonald and Wilfrid Laurier, and others who kept their distance from Pierre Trudeau and Stephen Harper. The Riel Rebellion, the Pacific scandal, two world wars, the Depression, Quebec separatism, and terrorism are all part of the sweeping background to this lively account of how the news gets made, manipulated, and, sometimes, mangled. Since Watergate, Press Gallery coverage has become more confrontational - a fact, Lewis argues, that fails Canadian democracy. 2018.\n\n2446946 The world as it is: a memoir of the Obama White House by Ben Rhodes. 1 volume of Braille (899 pages). For nearly ten years, Ben Rhodes saw almost everything that happened at the center of the Obama administration, first as a speechwriter, then as deputy national security advisor, and finally as a multipurpose aide and close collaborator. He started every morning in the Oval Office with the President's Daily Brief, traveled the world with Obama, and was at the center of some of the most consequential and controversial moments of the presidency. Now he tells the full story of his partnership, and, ultimately, friendship, with a man who also happened to be a historic president of the United States. Rhodes shows what it was like to be there from the early days of the Obama campaign to the final hours of the presidency. It is a story populated by such characters as Susan Rice, Samantha Power, Hillary Clinton, Bob Gates, and above all Barack Obama, who comes to life on the page in moments of great urgency and disarming intimacy. This is the most vivid portrayal yet of Obama's worldview and presidency, a chronicle of a political education and a record of the forces that shaped the last decade. Bestseller. 2018.\n\nTravel and geography\n\n2451419 Islander: a journey around our archipelago by Patrick Barkham. 12 volumes of Braille. The British Isles are an archipelago made up of two large islands and 6,289 smaller ones. Some, like the Isle of Man, resemble miniature nations, with their own language and tax laws; others, like Ray Island in Essex, are abandoned and mysterious places haunted by myths, ghosts and foxes. Patrick Barkham explores some of the most beautiful landscapes in Britain as he travels to ever-smaller islands in search of their special magic. 2017."
