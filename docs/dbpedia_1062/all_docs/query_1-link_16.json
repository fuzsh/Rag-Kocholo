        "text": "Abstract\n\nMachine translation (MT) systems have been built using numerous different techniques for bridging the language barriers. These techniques are broadly categorized into approaches like Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT). End-to-end NMT systems significantly outperform SMT in translation quality on many language pairs, especially those with the adequate parallel corpus. We report comparative experiments on baseline MT systems for Assamese to other Indo-Aryan languages (in both translation directions) using the traditional Phrase-Based SMT as well as some more successful NMT architectures, namely basic sequence-to-sequence model with attention, Transformer, and finetuned Transformer. The results are evaluated using the most prominent and popular standard automatic metric BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy), as well as other well-known metrics for exploring the performance of different baseline MT systems, since this is the first such work involving Assamese. The evaluation scores are compared for SMT and NMT models for the effectiveness of bi-directional language pairs involving Assamese and other Indo-Aryan languages (Bangla, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Odia, Sinhalese, and Urdu). The highest BLEU scores obtained are for Assamese to Sinhalese for SMT (35.63) and the Assamese to Bangla for NMT systems (seq2seq is 50.92, Transformer is 50.01, and finetuned Transformer is 50.19). We also try to relate the results with the language characteristics, distances, family trees, domains, data sizes, and sentence lengths. We find that the effect of the domain is the most important factor affecting the results for the given data domains and sizes. We compare our results with the only existing MT system for Assamese (Bing Translator) and also with pairs involving Hindi.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nP. J. Antony. 2013.
