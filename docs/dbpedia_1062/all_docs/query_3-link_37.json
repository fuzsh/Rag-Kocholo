        "text": "How do I know which bus I need?\n\nSee the system map, and the find potential routes near your starting point and destination.\n\nBus routes are identified by number and name. Each bus route has a published schedule showing a detailed map and times of service.\n\nIf the route numbers for your starting point and destination are the same, you have a direct route on one bus. If the numbers are not the same, you will have to transfer to another bus to complete your trip.\n\nGet the bus schedules you need to find specific route information.\n\nHow do I read the bus schedule?\n\n1) Map your route:\n\nLook at the bus schedule map first. Find where you will begin and end your trip.\n\nThe heavy black line on the bus schedule is the bus route. Bus stops are typically found where you see side streets. Block letters are time-point markers: They match the letters in the time table and show you when and where the bus departs these locations along the route.\n\nTrace your route. If you see the letters are going in alphabetical order (A, B, C) your direction is outbound. If the letters are going in reverse alphabetical order (C, B, A), your direction is inbound.\n\n2) Look at the timetable:\n\nChoose Monday-Friday, Saturday or Sunday service.\n\nMost timetables are divided between outbound and inbound. Remember your direction. (A,B,C for outbound, C,B,A for inbound).\n\nTime-point markers (A, B, C) are found in the column heading and show you times the bus leaves at certain points along the route. Time-point markers are shown on the map.\n\nIf you need to arrive at your destination at a certain time, start with your destination arrival time, and work your way back in reverse order to your starting point.\n\nAm I going inbound or outbound?\n\nTrace your route. If you see the letters are going in alphabetical order (A, B, C), you are going outbound. If you see the letters going in reverse alphabetical order (C, B, A), you are going inbound.\n\nIf you have to be at a certain place at a certain time, we suggest you find your destination arrival time first, and work your way back to find when you need to get on the bus.\n\nWhat happens at the bus stop?\n\nArrive at your bus stop at least 5 minutes before the bus is due to pick you up.\n\nWhen the bus comes, be sure the sign on the bus matches the route you want.\n\nAs the bus approaches, signal your intent to ride. Wave a lighted device or mirror during early morning and night travel.\n\nWait for others to exit, then board via the front door.\n\nSome routes will have flag stops as noted on each bus schedule map. Flag stops allow riders to board or exit the bus at safe locations along a route without a designated sign posted. Typically these are at the Broome Corporate Park area, Broome Industrial Park area, the western section of the Vestal Parkway.\n\nHow do I pay my fare?\n\nWhen you board, insert money in the farebox or use your bus pass.\n\nWe accept US currency only - both bills and coins.\n\nRead more about how to use the fare box here.\n\nHow do I exit the bus?\n\nWatch for your bus stop.\n\nListen for any driver instructions.\n\nPull the yellow cord or push the yellow touch strip to alert the driver you want to get off.\n\nExit via the rear doors unless instructed differently by the driver.\n\nFor your safety: Let the bus drive off then cross the street. Vehicles may attempt to pass the bus and not see you crossing the roadway. Please cross behind the bus.\n\nHow do I use a transfer ticket?\n\nTransfer tickets may be issued to complete your trip if you pay cash or swipe a 1, 2 or 12 ride pass.\n\n1 Day, 7 Day and 31 Day and other unlimited use pass holders do not need a transfer ticket.\n\nYou may not use a transfer ticket at non-designated transfer points. Transfer locations are identified on each schedule and on the system map.\n\nYou may not transfer to another bus on the same route, whether it’s the same or opposite direction.\n\nAre buses accessible for persons with disabilities?\n\nOur buses are 100% accessible.\n\nAny passenger, with or without a mobility aide, has the right to request that the Coach Operator lower the kneeler or ramp.\n\nDrivers are required to announce arrival at major bus stops along the route.\n\nService animals are welcome.\n\nBraille Schedules\n\nAll bus schedules and this “How to Ride Guide” are available in Braille for persons with vision impairments. Call us at 607.763.4464, option 3 or email us.\n\nDo you have an example of using the bus?\n\nHere is an example of someone living on Nanticoke Ave in Endicott and wanting to arrive at the Broome County Health Department by 10:00 AM on a weekday morning. The Health Department is near the corner of Clinton St and Front St in\n\nBinghamton. Using the system map , we see that route 8 goes by the Health Department, and route 35 serves Nanticoke Ave, on Main St in Endicott. The common transfer point is the BC Junction.\n\nBegin with with the 8 Front St schedule. A bus leaves the BC Junction at 9:50 AM, and arrives at SUNY Broome at 10:05 AM. We see it's a short ride to the Health Department from the BC Junction. We know we have to be at the BC Junction by 9:50 AM.\n\nOn the route 35 map, trace your route to the BC Junction. The block letters are going in reverse alphabetical order. You are going inbound. A bus arrives here from Endicott at 9:25AM. Reading in reverse order, we see a bus leaves the Glendale Technology Park at 8:30 AM. We estimate the bus will arrive at Nanticoke Ave at about 8:33AM.\n\nOur plan will go as follows:\n\nBoard route 35 at 8:33AM\n\nArrive at BC Junction at 9:25AM\n\nBoard route 8 at 9:50AM\n\nArrive at the Health Department at approximately 9:55AM.\n\nBC Transit recommends:\n\nWearing stable, secure footwear. Appropriate footwear will help you to maintain good balance and traction as you board, ride, and disembark the bus. Walking may be required as part of your trip.\n\nBeing ready as the bus approaches. Have your fare ready. Wheeled carts or strollers must be folded.\n\nMake your intentions to ride visible to the driver.\n\nFinding a seat. We encourage you to be seated while the bus is in motion; however, on busy routes, you may need to stand. As a courtesy, seating preference is given to the elderly, pregnant woman, and persons with disabilities.\n\nKnowing your route and bus stops before you ride. Contact our information line if you need additional help.\n\nBeing observant, watch for your destination and listen to driver instructions.\n\nTaking the route with fewest transfers if you are new to the system.\n\nPlease review our Guidelines and Rules to learn more about taking our buses.\n\nIf you have small children, consider using a small easy to collapse stroller. All wheeled carts and strollers must be folded and small enough to fit between your legs or under the seat while the bus is moving.\n\nWhat are some rules I should know?\n\nReserve seats for the elderly, pregnant women and those with physical disabilities.\n\nSharing of 31 day passes with others is strictly prohibited. One pass is allowed per person.\n\nNo eating, drinking or smoking on the bus.\n\nStrollers and other wheeled objects must be folded.\n\nService animals and pets in cages are allowed.\n\nItems you bring on the bus cannot occupy a seat or obstruct the aisle.\n\nYou may not put hands, body parts, or objects out the window of the bus at any time.\n\nNo hazardous material, including fuel, automobile type batteries, explosives, nor weapons.\n\nNo loud, harassing, or disruptive behavior.\n\nNever approach a bus while it is moving, wait until it stops before attempting to get on or off.\n\nBC Transit reserves the right to remove and/ or deny service to any passenger who poses a threat to the safety of themselves or others.\n\nOur complete policy manual can be found at any of our offices, or www.ridebctransit.com.\n\nNon-English Written Material\n\nBC Transit can print bus schedules, information, and policies including your Title VI rights, in the language of your choice. ::Contact Us::\n\nDo you provide travel training?\n\nYes we do.
