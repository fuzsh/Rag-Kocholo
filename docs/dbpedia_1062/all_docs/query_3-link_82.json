        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning and History of Darian\n\nThe name Darian is of Persian origin and is derived from the Persian king, Darius the Great. Darian is usually given to boys, although it is given to both boys and girls in some cultures. The most common meaning associated with the name is ‘king.’ The name is also believed to be derived from the Persian words ‘dāraya,’ which means ‘to hold’ or ‘to possess,’ and ‘vahu,’ which means ‘good.’ Hence, together the name could mean ‘possessing goodness’ or ‘he who holds firm to good.’\n\nAlthough the exact meaning of the name is unsure, the name seems to hold different meanings in different countries. The meaning of Darius in Indigenous Australia, Germany, and England is ‘wealthy,’ or ‘upholder of the good.’ In Croatia, Latvia, Poland, and Slovenia, the name means ‘to maintain.’ In Persian, Darius can be interpreted as ‘a gift sent from heaven on Earth.’ Darian can also be interpreted as ‘of Arielle’ from the name Darren and ‘oak tree’ from Darrell.\n\nDarius I, commonly known as Darius the Great, was a Persian king. He was the third ruler of the Achaemenid Empire and was known for his military and administrative tactics. His building projects that remain in Persepolis are also widely appreciated. The king was known for his benevolence and kindness to the different groups of people who lived under his sovereignty.\n\nThere is a possibility that the name is derived from a rare Irish surname or it could be a different form of the name Darell.
