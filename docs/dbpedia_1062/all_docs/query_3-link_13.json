        "text": "Happy #WorldBrailleDay! Today we celebrate the gift of Braille for blind and partially sighted people. How amazing is this RNIB name in Braille auto-generator? Image description: Sue in text with a visual representation of the braille above, separated by a pink line. The text \"Remember - braille is read by touch, this is just a visual representation\" and the RNIB See Differently logo are below.\n\nIt's World Braille Day - and RNIB Braille Name Generator is back by popular demand! This year the team can spread the word much wider about braille, thanks to a brilliant developer, Matt Eason, who offered to build us an automated name generator tool after watching us do it manually for the last few years! If you want to share your name in braille just reply to the RNIB World Braille Day posts on Twitter, Threads or Linkedin by 2pm today. [Image description - My name - Charlotte - in text with a visual representation of the braille above, separated by a pink line. The text \"Remember - braille is read by touch, this is just a visual representation\" and the RNIB See Differently logo are below.]\n\nIn honor and celebration of #WorldBrailleDay, I wanted to share with you 10 simple ways in which #Braille can be useful. (Credit for this list goes to the National Federation of the Blind.) 1.) Reading 2.) Monopoly and other board games 3.) Memorizing choral works 4.) Provides equity 5.) Locating the right rooms in buildings 6.) On rulers or meter sticks to measure anything 7.) Locating the right restroom 8.) Reading restaurant menus 9.) Identifying medication 10.) Using computerized Braille devices This is just a small portion of their full list, which includes 215 ways in which Braille is useful. I encourage you to take a moment to explore the full 215 ways, whether you're new to Braille or a seasoned enthusiast. It's not just a list, but rather a testament to the incredible power of braille in transforming lives and empowering our visually impaired friends to access information and pursue their passions.
