        "text": "Writing systems are used to record human language, and may be classified according to certain common features.\n\nThe usual name of the script is given first; the name of the languages in which the script is written follows (in brackets), particularly in the case where the language name differs from the script name. Other informative or qualifying annotations for the script may also be provided.\n\nIdeographic scripts (in which graphemes are ideograms representing concepts or ideas rather than a specific word in a language) and pictographic scripts (in which the graphemes are iconic pictures) are not thought to be able to express all that can be communicated by language, as argued by the linguists John DeFrancis and J. Marshall Unger. Essentially, they postulate that no true writing system can be completely pictographic or ideographic; it must be able to refer directly to a language in order to have the full expressive capacity of a language. Unger disputes claims made on behalf of Blissymbols in his 2004 book Ideogram.\n\nAlthough a few pictographic or ideographic scripts exist today, there is no single way to read them because there is no one-to-one correspondence between symbol and language. Hieroglyphs were commonly thought to be ideographic before they were translated, and to this day, Chinese is often erroneously said to be ideographic.[1] In some cases of ideographic scripts, only the author of a text can read it with any certainty, and it may be said that they are interpreted rather than read. Such scripts often work best as mnemonic aids for oral texts or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech.\n\nAdinkra\n\nAztec script – Nahuatl (includes syllabic and logographic elements)\n\nBirch-bark glyphs – Anishinaabemowin\n\nDongba – Naxi – Although this is often supplemented with syllabic Geba script.\n\nEmoji – used in electronic messages and web pages.\n\nErsu Shaba script – Ersu\n\nKaidā glyphs\n\nLusona\n\nNsibidi – Ekoi, Efik, Igbo\n\nSiglas poveiras\n\nMíkmaq hieroglyphic writing – Mi'kmawi'sit\n\nTesterian – used for missionary work in Mexico.\n\nThere are also symbol systems used to represent things other than language, or to represent constructed languages:\n\nBlissymbols – A constructed ideographic script used primarily in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).\n\niConji – A constructed ideographic script used primarily in social networking\n\nIsotype (picture language)\n\nA wide variety of notations\n\nLinear B also incorporates ideograms.\n\nIn logographic writing systems, glyphs represent words or morphemes (meaningful components of words, as in mean-ing-ful) rather than phonetic elements.\n\nNo logographic script is composed solely of logograms. All contain graphemes that represent phonetic (sound-based) elements as well. These phonetic elements may be used on their own (to represent, for example, grammatical inflections or foreign words), or may serve as phonetic complements to a logogram (used to specify the sound of a logogram that might otherwise represent more than one word). In the case of Chinese, the phonetic element is built into the logogram itself; in Egyptian and Mayan, many glyphs are purely phonetic, whereas others function as either logograms or phonetic elements, depending on context. For this reason, many such scripts may be more properly referred to as logosyllabic or complex scripts; the terminology used is largely a product of custom in the field, and is to an extent arbitrary.\n\nHieroglyphic, Hieratic, and Demotic – the writing systems of Ancient Egypt\n\nEgyptian hieroglyphs\n\nAnatolian hieroglyphs – Luwian\n\nCuneiform – Sumerian, Akkadian, other Semitic languages, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hurrian, and Urartian\n\nChinese characters – Chinese, Japanese (called Kanji), Korean (called Hanja), Vietnamese (called Chu Han, obsolete)\n\nSawndip – Zhuang\n\nChu Nom - Vietnamese\n\nKhitan large script – Khitan\n\nKhitan small script – Khitan\n\nJurchen script – Jurchen\n\nTangut script – Tangut\n\nEghap (or Bagam) script\n\nMaya script – Chorti, Yucatec, and other Classic Maya languages\n\nPau Cin Hau logographic script – Tedim\n\nSui script – Sui language\n\nYi (classical) – various Yi/Lolo languages\n\nIn a syllabary, graphemes represent syllables or moras. (The 19th-century term syllabics usually referred to abugidas rather than true syllabaries.)\n\nAfaka – Ndyuka\n\nAlaska or Yugtun script – Central Yup'ik\n\nBété\n\nCherokee – Cherokee\n\nCypriot – Arcadocypriot Greek\n\nGeba – Naxi\n\nIban or Dunging script – Iban\n\nKana – Japanese (although primarily based on moras rather than syllables)\n\nHiragana\n\nKatakana\n\nMan'yōgana\n\nKikakui – Mende\n\nKpelle – Kpelle\n\nLinear B – Mycenean Greek\n\nLisu Bamboo script\n\nLoma – Loma\n\nMasaba – Bambara\n\nNüshu – Chinese\n\nNwagu Aneke script – Igbo\n\nVai – Vai\n\nWoleaian – Woleaian (a likely syllabary)\n\nYi (modern) – various Yi/Lolo languages\n\nIn most of these systems, some consonant-vowel combinations are written as syllables, but others are written as consonant plus vowel. In the case of Old Persian, all vowels were written regardless, so it was effectively a true alphabet despite its syllabic component. In Japanese a similar system plays a minor role in foreign borrowings; for example, [tu] is written [to]+[u], and [ti] as [te]+[i]. Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries behaved as a syllabary for the stop consonants and as an alphabet for the rest of consonants and vowels.\n\nThe Tartessian or Southwestern script is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic full semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a stop consonant was determined by the following vowel, as in a full semi-syllabary, the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, others treat it as a redundant alphabet. Other scripts, such as Bopomofo, are semi-syllabic in a different sense: they transcribe half syllables. That is, they have letters for syllable onsets and rimes (kan = \"k-an\") rather than for consonants and vowels (kan = \"k-a-n\").\n\nBamum script – Bamum (a defective syllabary, with alphabetic principles used to fill the gaps)\n\nEskayan – Bohol, Philippines (a syllabary apparently based on an alphabet; some alphabetic characteristics remain)\n\nLinear Elamite – Elamite language\n\nPaleohispanic semi-syllabaries – Paleo-Hispanic languages\n\nCeltiberian script – Celtiberian language\n\nNortheastern Iberian script – Iberian language\n\nSoutheastern Iberian script – Iberian language\n\nSouthwest Paleohispanic script – Tartessian\n\nOld Persian cuneiform – Old Persian\n\nBopomofo – phonetic script for different varieties of Chinese.\n\nKhom script – Bahnaric languages, including Alak and Jru'.\n\nQuốc Âm Tân Tự – Vietnamese\n\nA segmental script has graphemes which represent the phonemes (basic unit of sound) of a language.\n\nNote that there need not be (and rarely is) a one-to-one correspondence between the graphemes of the script and the phonemes of a language. A phoneme may be represented only by some combination or string of graphemes, the same phoneme may be represented by more than one distinct grapheme, the same grapheme may stand for more than one phoneme, or some combination of all of the above.\n\nSegmental scripts may be further divided according to the types of phonemes they typically record:\n\nAn abjad is a segmental script containing symbols for consonants only, or where vowels are optionally written with diacritics (\"pointing\") or only written word-initially.\n\nAncient North Arabian – Dadanitic, Dumaitic, Hasaitic, Hismaic, Safaitic, Taymanitic, and Thamudic\n\nAncient South Arabian – Old South Arabian languages including Himyaritic, Hadhramautic, Minaean, Sabaean and Qatabanic; also the Ethiopic language Geʽez.\n\nAramaic, including Khwarezmian (AKA Chorasmian), Elymaic, Palmyrene, and Hatran\n\nArabic – Arabic, Azeri, Chittagonian (historically), Punjabi, Baluchi, Kashmiri, Pashto, Persian, Kurdish (vowels obligatory), Sindhi, Uighur (vowels obligatory), Urdu, Malay (as Jawi) and many other languages spoken in Africa and Western, Central, and Southeast Asia,\n\nHebrew – Hebrew and other Jewish languages\n\nManichaean script\n\nNabataean – the Nabataeans of Petra\n\nPahlavi script – Middle Persian\n\nParthian\n\nPsalter\n\nPhoenician – Phoenician and other Canaanite languages\n\nProto-Canaanite\n\nSogdian\n\nSamaritan (Old Hebrew) – Aramaic, Arabic, and Hebrew\n\nSyriac – Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Syriac, Turoyo and other Neo-Aramaic languages\n\nTifinagh – Tuareg\n\nUgaritic – Ugaritic, Hurrian\n\nA true alphabet contains separate letters (not diacritic marks) for both consonants and vowels.\n\nLinear alphabets are composed of lines on a surface, such as ink on paper.\n\nAdlam – Fula\n\nArmenian – Armenian\n\nAriyaka script – Pali, Isan, Lao\n\nAvestan – Avestan\n\nAvoiuli – Raga\n\nBorama – Somali\n\nBosančica – Bosnian\n\nCarian – Carian\n\nCaucasian Albanian – Caucasian Albanian\n\nCoorgi–Cox alphabet – Kodava\n\nCoptic – Egyptian\n\nCyrillic – Eastern South Slavic languages (Bulgarian and Macedonian), the Western South Slavic Serbian, Eastern Slavic languages (Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian), the other languages of Russia, Kazakh language, Kyrgyz language, Tajik language, Mongolian language.

Generally, however, if a single letter is understood to have an inherent unwritten vowel, and only vowels other than this are written, then the system is classified as an abugida regardless of whether the vowels look like diacritics or full letters. The vast majority of abugidas are found from India to Southeast Asia and belong historically to the Brāhmī family, however the term is derived from the first characters of the abugida in Ge'ez: አ (A) ቡ (bu) ጊ (gi) ዳ (da) — (compare with alphabet). Unlike abjads, the diacritical marks and systemic modifications of the consonants are not optional.\n\nAhom\n\nBalinese\n\nBatak – Toba and other Batak languages\n\nBaybayin – Formerly used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Tagalog, Bikol languages, Visayan languages, and possibly other Philippine languages\n\nBengali and Assamese — Bengali, Assamese, Meithei, Bishnupriya Manipuri\n\nBhaiksuki\n\nBrahmi – Sanskrit, Prakrit\n\nBuda – Old Sundanese and Old Javanese\n\nBuhid\n\nBurmese – Burmese, Karen languages, Mon, and Shan\n\nCham\n\nChakma\n\nDevanagari – Hindi, Sanskrit, Marathi, Nepali, and many other languages of northern India\n\nDhives Akuru\n\nGrantha – Sanskrit\n\nGujarati – Gujarati, Kutchi, Vasavi, Sanskrit, Avestan\n\nGurmukhi script – Punjabi\n\nHanuno’o\n\nJavanese\n\nKaithi\n\nKannada – Kannada, Tulu, Konkani, Kodava\n\nKawi\n\nKhema script – Gurung\n\nKhojki\n\nKhudabadi\n\nKhmer\n\nKirat Rai AKA Khambu Rai – Bantawa\n\nKulitan alphabet\n\nLai Tay – Tai Yo\n\nLampung\n\nLao\n\nLeke – Eastern Pwo, Western Pwo, and Karen\n\nLepcha\n\nLimbu\n\nLontara’ – Buginese, Makassar, and Mandar\n\nMahajani\n\nMakasar – Formerly used for Makassar\n\nMalayalam\n\nMarchen – Zhang-Zhung\n\nMeitei Mayek – Meitei\n\nModi – Marathi\n\nMultani – Saraiki\n\nNandinagari – Sanskrit\n\nNaoriya Phulo script – Meitei\n\nNew Tai Lue\n\nOdia\n\nPracalit script AKA Newa – Nepal Bhasa, Sanskrit, Pali\n\nPyu – Pyu\n\nRanjana – Nepal Bhasa, Sanskrit\n\nRejang\n\nRencong\n\nSaurashtra\n\nSharada – Sanskrit, Kashmiri\n\nSiddham – Sanskrit\n\nSinhala\n\nSirmauri\n\nSoyombo\n\nSundanese\n\nSylheti Nagri – Sylheti\n\nTagbanwa – Languages of Palawan\n\nTai Le AKA Dehong Dai – Tai Nuea\n\nTai Tham – Khün, and Northern Thai\n\nTai Viet\n\nTakri\n\nTamil\n\nTelugu\n\nThai\n\nTibetan\n\nTigalari – Sanskrit, Tulu\n\nTirhuta – used to write Maithili\n\nTocharian\n\nVatteluttu\n\nZanabazar Square\n\nZhang zhung scripts\n\nCanadian Aboriginal syllabics – Cree syllabics (for Cree), Inuktitut syllabics (for Inuktitut), Ojibwe syllabics (for Ojibwe), and various systems for other languages of Canada.

If no consonant is written in Pahawh Hmong, it is understood to be /k/; consonants are written after the vowel they precede in speech.

In many cases it is doubtful that they are actually writing. The Vinča symbols appear to be proto-writing, and quipu may have recorded only numerical information. There are doubts that the Indus script is writing, and the Phaistos Disc has so little content or context that its nature is undetermined.\n\nByblos syllabary – the city of Byblos\n\nCretan hieroglyphs\n\nIndus – Indus Valley civilization\n\nIsthmian (apparently logosyllabic)\n\nLinear A (a syllabary) – Minoan\n\nLukasa – Kingdom of Luba (a memory device)\n\nMixtec – Mixtec (perhaps pictographic)\n\nNeolithic signs in China, including:\n\nBanpo symbols – Yangshao culture (perhaps proto-writing)\n\nJiahu symbols – Peiligang culture (perhaps proto-writing)\n\nSawveh – Western Guangxi (disputed; perhaps proto-writing)\n\nOlmec – Olmec civilization (possibly the oldest Mesoamerican script)\n\nPara-Lydian script – Unknown language of Asia Minor; script appears related to the Lydian alphabet.\n\nPhaistos Disc (a unique text, very possibly not writing)\n\nProto-Elamite – Elam (nearly as old as Sumerian)\n\nProto-Sinaitic (likely an abjad)\n\nQuipu – Inca Empire (possibly numerical only)\n\nRongorongo – Rapa Nui (perhaps a syllabary)\n\nSidetic – Sidetic\n\nTrojan script – (possibly related to Linear B)\n\nZapotec – Zapotec (another old Mesoamerican script)\n\nComparatively recent manuscripts and other texts written in undeciphered (and often unidentified) writing systems; some of these may represent ciphers of known languages or hoaxes.\n\nVoynich manuscript\n\nRohonc Codex\n\nCodex Seraphinianus\n\nHamptonese\n\nDorabella cipher\n\nThis section lists alphabets used to transcribe phonetic or phonemic sound; not to be confused with spelling alphabets like the ICAO spelling alphabet.
