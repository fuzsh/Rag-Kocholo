        "text": "This is a list of writing systems (or scripts), classified according to some common distinguishing features.\n\nThe usual name of the script is given first (and bolded); the name of the language(s) in which the script is written follows (in brackets), particularly in the case where the language name differs from the script name. Other informative or qualifying annotations for the script may also be provided.\n\nContents\n\n1 Pictographic/ideographic writing systems\n\n2 Logographic writing systems\n\n2.1 Consonant-based logographies\n\n2.2 Syllable-based logographies\n\n2.2.1 Logographies based on Chinese\n\n3 Syllabaries\n\n3.1 Semi-syllabaries: Part syllabic, part alphabetic scripts\n\n4 Segmental scripts\n\n4.1 Abjads\n\n4.2 True alphabets\n\n4.2.1 Linear nonfeatural alphabets\n\n4.2.2 Featural linear alphabets\n\n4.2.3 Manual alphabets\n\n4.2.4 Other non-linear alphabets\n\n4.3 Abugidas\n\n4.3.1 Abugidas of the Brāhmī family\n\n4.3.2 Other Abugidas\n\n4.3.3 Final consonant-diacritic abugidas\n\n4.3.4 Vowel-based abugidas\n\n5 Undeciphered systems thought to be writing\n\n6 Undeciphered manuscripts\n\n7 Other\n\n7.1 Phonetic alphabets\n\n7.2 Special alphabets\n\n7.2.1 Tactile alphabets\n\n7.2.2 Manual alphabets\n\n7.2.3 Long-Distance Signaling\n\n7.3 Alternative alphabets\n\n7.4 Fictional writing systems\n\n8 See also\n\n9 References\n\nPictographic/ideographic writing systems\n\nIdeographic scripts (in which graphemes are ideograms representing concepts or ideas, rather than a specific word in a language), and pictographic scripts (in which the graphemes are iconic pictures) are not thought to be able to express all that can be communicated by language, as argued by the linguists John DeFrancis and J. Marshall Unger. Essentially, they postulate that no full writing system can be completely pictographic or ideographic; it must be able to refer directly to a language in order to have the full expressive capacity of a language. Unger disputes claims made on behalf of Blissymbols in his 2004 book Ideogram.\n\nAlthough a few pictographic or ideographic scripts exist today, there is no single way to read them, because there is no one-to-one correspondence between symbol and language. Hieroglyphs were commonly thought to be ideographic before they were translated, and to this day Chinese is often erroneously said to be ideographic. In some cases of ideographic scripts, only the author of a text can read it with any certainty, and it may be said that they are interpreted rather than read. Such scripts often work best as mnemonic aids for oral texts, or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech.\n\nAztec – Nahuatl\n\nDongba – Naxi\n\nMíkmaq hieroglyphic writing – Míkmaq - Does have phonetic components, however.\n\nThere are also symbol systems used to represent things other than language. Some of these are\n\nBlissymbols - A constructed ideographic script used primarily in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).\n\nDanceWriting\n\nNew Epoch Notation Painting\n\nShui script - Shui language\n\nLogographic writing systems\n\nIn logographic writing systems, glyphs represent words or morphemes (meaningful components of words, as in mean-ing-ful), rather than phonetic elements.\n\nNote that no logographic script is comprised solely of logograms. All contain graphemes which represent phonetic (sound-based) elements as well. These phonetic elements may be used on their own (to represent, for example, grammatical inflections or foreign words), or may serve as phonetic complements to a logogram (used to specify the sound of a logogram which might otherwise represent more than one word). In the case of Chinese, the phonetic element is built into the logogram itself; in Egyptian and Mayan, many glyphs are purely phonetic, while others function as either logograms or phonetic elements, depending on context. For this reason, many such scripts may be more properly referred to as logosyllabic or complex scripts; the terminology used is largely a product of custom in the field, and is to an extent arbitrary.\n\nConsonant-based logographies\n\nHieroglyphic, Hieratic, and Demotic – writing systems of Ancient Egypt\n\nSyllable-based logographies\n\nAnatolian hieroglyphs – Luwian\n\nCuneiform – Sumerian, Akkadian, other Semitic languages, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hurrian, and Urartian\n\nChinese characters (Hanzi) – Chinese, Japanese (called Kanji), Korean (called Hanja), Vietnamese (called Han tu, obsolete)\n\nMayan – Chorti, Yucatec, and other Classic Maya languages\n\nYi (classical) – various Yi/Lolo languages\n\nLogographies based on Chinese\n\nJurchen script – Jurchen\n\nKhitan large script – Khitan\n\nTangut – Tangut\n\nZhuang – Zhuang\n\nChữ Nôm – Vietnamese (for vernacular Vietnamese, now obsolete)\n\nSyllabaries\n\nIn a syllabary, graphemes represent syllables or moras. (Note that the 19th century term syllabics usually referred to abugidas rather than true syllabaries.)\n\nAfaka – Ndyuka\n\nAlaska script – Central Yup'ik\n\nCherokee – Cherokee\n\nCypriot – Mycenean Greek\n\nGeba – Naxi\n\nHiragana – Japanese\n\nJapanese manual syllabary – Japanese Sign Language\n\nKatakana – Japanese\n\nKikakui - Mende\n\nKpelle – Kpelle\n\nLinear B – Mycenean Greek\n\nMan'yōgana - Japanese\n\nNü Shu – Yao\n\nVai – Vai\n\nWoleaian – Woleaian (a likely syllabary)\n\nYi (modern) – various Yi/Lolo languages\n\nSemi-syllabaries: Part syllabic, part alphabetic scripts\n\nIn most of these systems, some consonant-vowel combinations are written as syllables, but others are written as consonant plus vowel. In the case of Old Persian, all vowels were written regardless, so it was effectively a true alphabet despite its syllabic component. In Japanese a similar system plays a minor role in foreign borrowings; for example, [tu] is written [to]+[u], and [ti] as [te]+[i]. Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries behaved as a syllabary for the stop consonants and as an alphabet for the rest of consonants and vowels. The Tartessian or Southwestern script is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic full semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a stop consonant was determined by the following vowel, as in a full semi-syllabary, the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, others treat it as a redundant alphabet. Zhuyin is semi-syllabic in a different sense: it transcribes half syllables. That is, it has letters for syllable onsets and rimes (kan = \"k-an\") rather than for consonants and vowels (kan = \"k-a-n\").\n\nPaleohispanic semi-sillabaries – Paleohispanic languages\n\nTartessian or Southwestern script – Tartessian or Southwestern language\n\nSoutheastern Iberian script – Iberian language\n\nNortheastern Iberian script – Iberian language\n\nCeltiberian script – Celtiberian language\n\nOld Persian Cuneiform – Old Persian\n\nZhuyin fuhao – phonetic script for Chinese languages, and principal script for several Formosan languages.\n\nEskayan – Bohol, Philippines (a syllabary apparently based on an alphabet; some alphabetic characteristics remain)\n\nSegmental scripts\n\nA segmental script has graphemes which represent the phonemes (basic unit of sound) of a language.\n\nNote that there need not be (and rarely is) a one-to-one correspondence between the graphemes of the script and the phonemes of a language. A phoneme may be represented only by some combination or string of graphemes, the same phoneme may be represented by more than one distinct grapheme, the same grapheme may stand for more than one phoneme, or some combination of all of the above.\n\nSegmental scripts may be further divided according to the types of phonemes they typically record:\n\nAbjads\n\nAn abjad is a segmental script containing symbols for consonants only, or where vowels are optionally written with diacritics (\"pointing\") or only written word-initially.\n\nAramaic\n\nArabic – Arabic, Azeri, Baluchi, Kashmiri, Pashtun, Persian, Kurdish, Sindhi, Uighur, Urdu, and the languages of many other Muslim peoples\n\nEstrangelo – Syriac\n\nHebrew Square Script – Hebrew, Yiddish, and other Jewish languages\n\nJawi - Arabic, Malay\n\nManichaean script\n\nNabataean – the Nabataeans of Petra\n\nPahlavi script – Middle Persian\n\nParthian\n\nPsalter\n\nPhoenician – Phoenician and other Canaanite languages\n\nProto-Canaanite\n\nSabaean\n\nSouth Arabian – Sabaic, Qatabanic, Himyaritic, and Hadhramautic\n\nSogdian\n\nSamaritan (Old Hebrew) – Aramaic, Arabic, and Hebrew\n\nTifinagh – Tuareg\n\nUgaritic – Ugaritic, Hurrian\n\nTrue alphabets\n\nA true alphabet contains separate letters (not diacritic marks) for both consonants and vowels.\n\nLinear nonfeatural alphabets\n\nLinear alphabets are composed of lines on a surface, such as ink on paper.\n\nArabic (for Uyghur)\n\nArmenian – Armenian\n\nAvestan alphabet – Avestan language\n\nBeitha Kukju – Albanian\n\nCoptic – Egyptian\n\nCyrillic – Eastern Slavic languages (Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian), eastern South Slavic languages (Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian), the other languages of Russia, Kazakh language, Kyrgyz language, Tajik language, Mongolian language.

Variants include Mkhedruli, Khutsuri, Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri\n\nGlagolitic – Old Church Slavonic\n\nGothic – Gothic\n\nGreek – Greek\n\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet\n\nLatin alphabet or Roman alphabet – originally Latin language; most current western and central European languages, Turkic languages, sub-Saharan African languages, indigenous languages of the Americas, languages of maritime Southeast Asia and languages of Oceania use developments of it. Languages using a non-Latin writing system are generally also equipped with Romanization for transliteration or secondary use.\n\nManchu – Manchu\n\nMandaic – Mandaic dialect of Aramaic\n\nMongolian – Mongolian\n\nNeo-Tifinagh – Tamazight\n\nN'Ko – Maninka language, Bambara, Dyula language\n\nOgham (pronounced [oːm]) – Gaelic, Britannic, Pictish\n\nOld Hungarian (in Hungarian magyar rovásírás or szekely-magyar rovásírás) – Hungarian\n\nOld Italic – Etruscan, Oscan, Umbrian\n\nOld Permic (also called Abur) – Komi\n\nOld Turkic – Turkic\n\nOsmanya – Somali\n\nRunic alphabet – Germanic languages\n\nOl Cemet' – Santali\n\nTai Lue – Lue\n\nVah – Bassa\n\nFeatural linear alphabets\n\nA featural script has elements that indicate the components of articulation, such as bilabial consonants, fricatives, or back vowels. Scripts differ in how many features they indicate.\n\nGregg Shorthand\n\nHangul – Korean\n\nShavian alphabet\n\nTengwar (a fictional script)\n\nVisible Speech (a phonetic script)\n\nStokoe notation for American Sign Language\n\nManual alphabets\n\nManual alphabets are frequently found as parts of sign languages. They are not used for writing per se, but for spelling out words while signing.\n\nAmerican manual alphabet (used with slight modification in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Paraguay, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand)\n\nBritish manual alphabet (used in some of the Commonwealth of Nations, such as Australia and New Zealand)\n\nCatalonian manual alphabet\n\nChilean manual alphabet\n\nChinese manual alphabet\n\nDutch manual alphabet\n\nEthiopian manual alphabet (an abugida)\n\nFrench manual alphabet\n\nGreek manual alphabet\n\nIcelandic manual alphabet (also used in Denmark)\n\nIndian manual alphabet (a true alphabet?; used in Devanagari and Gujarati areas)\n\nInternational manual alphabet (used in Germany, Austria, Norway, Finland)\n\nIranian manual alphabet (an abjad; also used in Egypt)\n\nIsrali manual alphabet (an abjad)\n\nItalian manual alphabet\n\nKorean manual alphabet\n\nLatin American manual alphabets\n\nPolish manual alphabet\n\nPortuguese manual alphabet\n\nRomanian manual alphabet\n\nRussian manual alphabet (also used in Bulgaria and ex-Soviet states)\n\nSpanish manual alphabet (Madrid)\n\nSwedish manual alphabet\n\nYugoslav manual alphabet\n\nOther non-linear alphabets\n\nThese are other alphabets composed of something other than lines on a surface.\n\nBraille (Unified) – an embossed alphabet for the visually-impaired, used with some extra letters to transcribe the Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets, as well as Chinese\n\nBraille (Korean)\n\nBraille (American) (defunct)\n\nNew York Point – a defunct alternative to Braille\n\nInternational maritime signal flags (both alphabetic and ideographic)\n\nMorse code (International) – a trinary code of dashes, dots, and silence, whether transmitted by electricity, light, or sound)\n\nAmerican Morse code (defunct)\n\nOptical telegraphy (defunct)\n\nFlag semaphore – (made by moving hand-held flags)\n\nAbugidas\n\nAn abugida, or alphasyllabary, is a segmental script in which vowel sounds are denoted by diacritical marks or other systematic modification of the consonants. Generally, however, if a single letter is understood to have an inherent unwritten vowel, and only vowels other than this are written, then the system is classified as an abugida regardless of whether the vowels look like diacritics or full letters. The vast majority of abugidas are found from India to Southeast Asia and belong historically to the Brāhmī family.\n\nAbugidas of the Brāhmī family\n\nAhom\n\nBrāhmī – Prakrit, Sanskrit\n\nBalinese\n\nBatak – Toba and other Batak languages\n\nBaybayin – Ilokano, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, Tagalog, Bikol languages, Visayan languages, and possibly other Philippine languages\n\nBengali – Bengali, Assamese\n\nBuhid\n\nBurmese – Burmese, Karen languages, Mon, and Shan\n\nCham\n\nDehong – Dehong Dai\n\nDevanāgarī – Hindi, Sanskrit, Marathi, Nepali, and many other languages of northern India\n\nGujarāti – Gujarāti, Kachchi\n\nGurmukhi script – Punjabi\n\nHanuno’o\n\nJavanese\n\nKaganga – Rejang\n\nKannada – Kannada, Tulu\n\nKhmer\n\nLao\n\nLimbu\n\nLontara’ – Buginese, Makassar, and Mandar\n\nMalayalam\n\nModi – Marathi\n\nOriya\n\nPhags-pa – Mongolian, Chinese, and other languages of the Yuan Dynasty Mongol Empire\n\nRanjana – Newari\n\nSinhala\n\nSourashtra\n\nSoyombo\n\nSyloti Nagri - Sylheti\n\nTagbanwa – Languages of Palawan\n\nTai Dam\n\nTai Tham – Khün, and Northern Thai\n\nTamil\n\nTelugu\n\nThai\n\nTibetan\n\nTocharian\n\nVarang Kshiti – Ho\n\nOther Abugidas\n\nCanadian Aboriginal syllabics – Cree syllabics (for Cree), Inuktitut syllabics (for Inuktitut), and other variants for Ojibwe, Carrier, Blackfoot, and other languages of Canada\n\nEthiopic – Amharic, Ge’ez, Oromo, Tigrigna\n\nKharoṣṭhī – Gandhari, Sanskrit\n\nMeroitic – Meroë\n\nPitman Shorthand\n\nPollard script – Miao\n\nSorang Sompeng – Sora\n\nThaana – Dhivehi\n\nThomas Natural Shorthand\n\nFinal consonant-diacritic abugidas\n\nIn at least one abugida, not only the vowel but any syllable-final consonant is written with a diacritic. That is, representing [o] with an under-ring, and final [k] with an over-cross, [sok] would written as s̥̽.\n\nRóng – Lepcha\n\nVowel-based abugidas\n\nIn a couple abugidas, the vowels are basic, and the consonants secondary. If no consonant is written in Pahawh Hmong, it is understood to be /k/; consonants are written after the vowel they precede in speech. In Japanese Braille, the vowels but not the consonants have independent status, and it is the vowels which are modified when the consonant is y or w.\n\nBoyd's Syllabic Shorthand\n\nJapanese Braille – Japanese\n\nPahawh Hmong abugida – Hmong\n\nUndeciphered systems thought to be writing\n\nThese writing systems have not been deciphered. In some cases, such as Meroitic, the sound values of the glyphs are known, but the texts still cannot be read because the language is not understood. In others, such as the Phaistos Disc, there is little hope of progress unless further texts are found. Several of these systems, such as Epi-Olmec and Indus, are claimed to have been deciphered, but these claims have not been confirmed by independent researchers. In Vinca and other cases the system, although symbolic, may turn out to not be writing.\n\nByblos syllabary – the city of Byblos\n\nIsthmian (apparently logosyllabic)\n\nIndus – Indus Valley Civilization\n\nKhipu – Inca Empire (very possibly not writing)\n\nKhitan small script – Khitan\n\nLinear A (a syllabary) – Minoan\n\nMixtec – Mixtec (perhaps pictographic)\n\nVinča symbols (perhaps proto-writing)\n\nOlmec – Olmec civilization (possibly the oldest Mesoamerican script)\n\nPhaistos Disc (a unique text, very possibly not writing)\n\nProto-Elamite – Elam (nearly as old as Sumerian)\n\nRongorongo – Rapa Nui (perhaps a syllabary)\n\nWadi el-Ħôl & Proto-Sinaitic (likely an abjad)\n\nZapotec – Zapotec (another old Mesoamerican script)\n\nBanpo symbols – Yangshao culture (perhaps proto-writing)\n\nJiahu symbols – Peiligang culture (perhaps proto-writing)\n\nUndeciphered manuscripts\n\nA number of manuscripts from comparable recent past may be written in an invented writing system, a cipher of an existing writing system or may only be a hoax.\n\nVoynich manuscript\n\nRohonc Codex\n\nCodex Seraphinianus\n\nHamptonese\n\nAsemic writing\n\nOther\n\nPhonetic alphabets\n\nThis section lists alphabets used to transcribe phonetic or phonemic sound; not to be confused with spelling alphabets like the NATO phonetic alphabet.\n\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet\n\nDeseret alphabet\n\nUnifon\n\nAmericanist phonetic notation\n\nUralic Phonetic Alphabet\n\nShavian alphabet\n\nSpecial alphabets\n\nAlphabets may exist in forms other than visible symbols on a surface.
