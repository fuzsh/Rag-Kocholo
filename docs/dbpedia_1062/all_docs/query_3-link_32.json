        "text": "Braille is the main way to teach blind people. Blind readers can read using this Braille system with the help of their fingers. Much work has been done to modernize the blind education system, but it is still very expensive and complex. This paper proposed a cost-effective and user-friendly braille device based on simple technology. This paper presents the design, implementation, and working principle of a new concept of a Braille translating device which can convert text and voice to braille signs for blind students. It can convert letters from different languages to Braille symbols according to the \"Voice\" and \"Text\" commands given by the user. It can give an output like a traditional Braille sign with a voice, for confirmation of the sign displayed in the cell. This device consists of only one refreshable braille cell which can show those braille signs. Along with blind students, educators can take advantage of this device to teach blind students. Educators can operate this device with the help of smart phones and computers using Bluetooth and a USB cable. Educators can connect more than 30 braille translating devices with their computers and teach 30 students at a time. After user test and result analysis of this proposed device, observed that this system's portability, simplicity, cost efficiency, and user-friendly interface put this ahead of other devices. The results suggest that the given approach is a superior option for implementing refresh-able braille devices more simply and cost-effectively.\n\nThe majority of blind or visually impaired students in the third world countries are still using the mechanical brailler for their education. With technology advancements and electronic communication, relying on paper-based brailler would not be efficient nor productive. The &quot;LCE Brailler&quot; is a low-cost electronic brailler whose main features are to vocalize, braille, save and convert Braille characters typed by a blind student to alphabetical ones, which are then displayed on a computer’s monitor. In order to promote an interactive educational experience among students, teachers and parents, the proposed brailler has an affordable low price with advanced capabilities. The device’s design is simplistic and its keyboard is familiar to the blind user. It is based on the raspberry pi technology. The LCE device was tested by visually impaired students and proved to provide accurate mechanical functionality, accuracy, braille-to-text and text-to-audio blind assistant with a use...\n\nVisually impaired people find it challenging to use devices such as computers, and other digital/educational software like every normal person does in this technology driven world. Due to their inability to gainaccess to basic and vital information they sometimes feel excluded from the society and also limit their knowledge. Several attempts have beenmade in the recent years toimprove their communication methods such as tactile sign language, Braille glove, and Audioacces devices so on. This paper suggests an innovative assistive device, a Braille keypad, for the viually impaired that would help them use computers just like a normal person. The Braille keypad implements the Braille cells as 6 switches that can be pressed simultaneously based on the actual Braille combination in order to type a particular letter and words. The corresponding letters/words are displayed as well as can be heard by the user. A text to speech algorithm is implemented using puTTY software which would help ...\n\nVisually impaired peoples use braille system for reading and writing. This people are not able to operate computers and other educational software due to this they unable to improve their knowledge. They are comparatively weak than people with clear vision which causes adverse effect on the economic society. One way to improve their knowledge is by introducing a system which can convert braille to word and audio which will improve them to communicate freely with outside world. This system presents the implementation of braille to word and audio converter which is output and word of that particular input. Braille Keypad with different combination of six cells are used an input to system. In this system FPGA kit is used to convert this input to English text and also display it on LCD after decoding English text it converted to audio Keywords: Braille language, blind people, Braille to English word converter.\n\nIn this fast developing world which is tending more towards the use of digital communication the visually, audibly and vocally impaired people find it really difficult to cope up with the pace of it. Considering these people, we have developed a communicative band which will help them to interact with other people. This band includes push buttons and vibration motors for communication. It allows the person to type characters representing the Braille combination using push buttons which is placed on the ventral side of the band which also allows the person to read the incoming message using the vibration motors which we have placed on the dorsal side of the band. This band also has voice recognition using API.\n\nBraille is an image of 6 celled dots\". This paper presents a novel method of converting Braille of English and Kannada Language to a speech output and also having a text to speech and a communication to model having speech to text output in English language to have a more economical and a handheld device for a visually impaired people. The Project deals with Image Processing algorithm to be followed along with some hardware implementation which basically deals with a final handheld device that can read or capture the image from the Braille text or image or a print and can obtain the output through speech using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and TTS (Text to Speech) Technique. This application has been developed to support the young visually impaired and also to support them to be more independent and knowledgeable to the new technology in an early age. Optical Braille Recognition and Optical Character recognition are useful for visually impaired people who are unable to read text documents or Braille script but require access to the documents' content."
