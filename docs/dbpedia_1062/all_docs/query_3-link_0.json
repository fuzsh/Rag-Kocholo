Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of Unicode characters. For an introductory guide on IPA symbols, see Help:IPA.\n\nPunjabi,[g] sometimes spelled Panjabi,[h] is an Indo-Aryan language native to the Punjab region of Pakistan and India. It is one of the most widely spoken native languages in the world with approximately 113 million native speakers.[16]\n\nPunjabi is the most widely-spoken first language in Pakistan, with 80.5 million native speakers according to the 2017 census, and the 11th most widely-spoken in India, with 31.1 million native speakers, according to the 2011 census. It is spoken among a significant overseas diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and the Gulf states.\n\nIn Pakistan, Punjabi is written using the Shahmukhi alphabet, based on the Perso-Arabic script; in India, it is written using the Gurmukhi alphabet, based on the Indic scripts. Punjabi is unusual among the Indo-Aryan languages and the broader Indo-European language family in its usage of lexical tone.\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word Punjabi (sometimes spelled Panjabi) has been derived from the word Panj-āb, Persian for 'Five Waters', referring to the five major eastern tributaries of the Indus River. The name of the region was introduced by the Turko-Persian conquerors[17] of South Asia and was a translation of the Sanskrit name, Panchanada, which means 'Land of the Five Rivers'.[18][19]\n\nPanj is cognate with Sanskrit pañca (पञ्च), Greek pénte (πέντε), and Lithuanian Penki, all of which meaning 'five'; āb is cognate with Sanskrit áp (अप्) and with the Av- of Avon. The historical Punjab region, now divided between India and Pakistan, is defined physiographically by the Indus River and these five tributaries. One of the five, the Beas River, is a tributary of another, the Sutlej.\n\nOrigin\n\nPunjabi developed from Prakrit languages and later Apabhraṃśa (Sanskrit: अपभ्रंश, 'deviated' or 'non-grammatical speech')[20] From 600 BC, Sanskrit developed as the standard literary and administrative language and Prakrit languages evolved into many regional languages in different parts of India. All these languages are called Prakrit languages (Sanskrit: प्राकृत, prākṛta) collectively. Paishachi Prakrit was one of these Prakrit languages, which was spoken in north and north-western India and Punjabi developed from this Prakrit. Later in northern India Paishachi Prakrit gave rise to Paishachi Apabhraṃśa, a descendant of Prakrit.[1][21] Punjabi emerged as an Apabhramsha, a degenerated form of Prakrit, in the 7th century AD and became stable by the 10th century. The earliest writings in Punjabi belong to the Nath Yogi-era from 9th to 14th century.[22] The language of these compositions is morphologically closer to Shauraseni Apbhramsa, though vocabulary and rhythm is surcharged with extreme colloquialism and folklore.[22] The precursor stage of Punjabi between the 10th and 16th centuries is termed 'Old Punjabi', whilst the stage between the 16th and 19th centuries is termed as 'Medieval Punjabi'.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\n\nArabic and Persian influences\n\nThe Arabic and modern Persian influence in the historical Punjab region began with the late first millennium Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent.[23] Many Persian and Arabic words have been incorporated into Punjabi.[24][25] So Punjabi relies heavily on Persian and Arabic words which are used with a liberal approach to language. Many important words like ਅਰਦਾਸ, ਰਹਿਰਾਸ, ਨਹਿਰ, ਜ਼ਮੀਨ, ਗਜ਼ਲ, etc. are derived from Persian and Arabic. After the fall of the Sikh empire, Urdu was made the official language of Punjab (in Pakistani Punjab, it is still the primary official language), and influenced the language as well.[26]\n\nIn fact, the sounds of ਜ਼, ਖ਼, ਸ਼, and ਫ਼ have been borrowed from Persian. Later, it was lexically influenced by Portuguese (words like ਅਲਮਾਰੀ/الماری), Greek (words like ਦਾਮ/دام), Chagatai (words like ਕ਼ੈੰਚੀ, ਸੁਗ਼ਾਤ/قینچی،سوغات), Japanese (words like ਰਿਕਸ਼ਾ/رکشا), Chinese (words like ਚਾਹ, ਲੀਚੀ, ਲੁਕਾਠ/چاہ، لیچی، لکاٹھ) and English (words like ਜੱਜ, ਅਪੀਲ, ਮਾਸਟਰ/جج، اپیل، ماسٹر), though these influences have been minor in comparison to Persian and Arabic.[27]\n\nEnglish Gurmukhi-based (Punjab, India) Shahmukhi-based (Punjab, Pakistan) President ਰਾਸ਼ਟਰਪਤੀ (rāshtarpatī) صدرمملکت (sadar-e mumlikat) Article ਲੇਖ (lēkh) مضمون (mazmūn) Prime Minister ਪਰਧਾਨ ਮੰਤਰੀ (pardhān mantarī)* وزیراعظم (vazīr-e aʿzam) Family ਪਰਿਵਾਰ (parivār)*\n\nਟੱਬਰ (ṭabbar)\n\nਲਾਣਾ (lāṇā) خاندان (kḥāndān)\n\nٹبّر (ṭabbar) Philosophy ਫ਼ਲਸਫ਼ਾ (falsafā)\n\nਦਰਸ਼ਨ (darshan) فلسفہ (falsafah) Capital city ਰਾਜਧਾਨੀ (rājdhānī) دارالحکومت (dār-al ḥakūmat) Viewer ਦਰਸ਼ਕ (darshak) ناظرین (nāzarīn) Listener ਸਰੋਤਾ (sarotā) سامع (sāmaʿ)\n\nNote: In more formal contexts, hypercorrect Sanskritized versions of these words (ਪ੍ਰਧਾਨ pradhān for ਪਰਧਾਨ pardhān and ਪਰਿਵਾਰ parivār for ਪਰਵਾਰ parvār) may be used.\n\nModern times\n\nModern Punjabi emerged in the 19th century from the Medieval Punjabi stage.[3] Modern Punjabi has two main varieties, Western (Lahnda Punjab) and Eastern Punjabi (Charda Punjab), which have many dialects and forms, altogether spoken by over 150 million people. The Majhi dialect, which is transitional between the two main varieties, has been adopted as standard Punjabi in India and Pakistan for education and mass media. The Majhi dialect originated in the Majha region of the Punjab.\n\nIn India, Punjabi is written in the Gurmukhī script in offices, schools, and media. Gurmukhi is the official standard script for Punjabi, though it is often unofficially written in the Latin scripts due to influence from English, one of India's two primary official languages at the Union-level.\n\nIn Pakistan, Punjabi is generally written using the Shahmukhī script, which in literary standards, is identical to the Urdu alphabet, however various attempts have been made to create certain, distinct characters from a modification of the Persian Nastaʿlīq characters to represent Punjabi phonology, not already found in the Urdu alphabet. In Pakistan, Punjabi loans technical words from Persian and Arabic, just like Urdu does.\n\nGeographic distribution\n\nPunjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan, the eleventh-most widely spoken in India, and also present in the Punjabi diaspora in various countries.\n\nPakistan\n\nPunjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan, being the native language of 80.5 million people, or approximately 39% of the country's population.\n\nCensus history of Punjabi speakers in Pakistan[28][29] Year Population of Pakistan Percentage Punjabi speakers 1951 33,740,167 57.08% 22,632,905 1961 42,880,378 56.39% 28,468,282 1972 65,309,340 56.11% 43,176,004 1981 84,253,644 48.17% 40,584,980 1998 132,352,279 44.15% 58,433,431 2017 207,685,000 38.78% 80,540,000\n\nBeginning with the 1981 and 2017 censuses respectively, speakers of the Western Punjabi's Saraiki and Hindko varieties were no longer included in the total numbers for Punjabi, which explains the apparent decrease.\n\nPothwari speakers however are included in the total numbers for Punjabi.[30]\n\nIndia\n\nPunjabi is the official language of the Indian state of Punjab, and has the status of an additional official language in Haryana and Delhi. Some of its major urban centres in northern India are Amritsar, Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Ambala, Patiala, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Firozpur and Delhi.\n\nIn the 2011 census of India, 31.14 million reported their language as Punjabi. The census publications group this with speakers of related \"mother tongues\" like Bagri and Bhateali to arrive at the figure of 33.12 million.[31]\n\nCensus history of Punjabi speakers in India[32] Year Population of India Punjabi speakers in India Percentage 1971 548,159,652 14,108,443 2.57% 1981 665,287,849 19,611,199 2.95% 1991 838,583,988 23,378,744 2.79% 2001 1,028,610,328 29,102,477 2.83% 2011 1,210,193,422 33,124,726 2.74%\n\nPunjabi diaspora\n\nSee also: Punjabi diaspora\n\nPunjabi is also spoken as a minority language in several other countries where Punjabi people have emigrated in large numbers, such as the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada.[30]\n\nThere were 670,000 native Punjabi speakers in Canada in 2021,[33] 300,000 in the United Kingdom in 2011,[34] 280,000 in the United States[35] and smaller numbers in other countries.\n\nPunjabi speakers by country\n\nApproximate number of Punjabi speakers by country [citation needed] Country Native number of speakers Source Pakistan 80,540,000 Census India 33,124,726 Census Saudi Arabia 800,000 Ethnologue Canada 670,000 Census UK 291,000 Census USA 280,867 Census Australia 239,033 Census UAE 201,000 Ethnologue\n\nMajor dialects\n\nMain article: Punjabi dialects and languages\n\nStandard Punjabi\n\nStandard Punjabi sometimes referred to as Majhi in India or simply Central/Eastern Punjabi, is the most widespread and largest dialect of Punjabi. It is transitional between both Western Punjabi (Lahnda Punjab) and Eastern Punjabi (Charda Punjab) and it first developed in the 12th century and gained prominence when Sufi poets such as Shah Hussain, Bulleh Shah among others began to use the Lahore/Amritsar-spoken dialect with infused Persian vocabulary in their works in the Shahmukhi script.[36] Later the Gurmukhi script was developed based on Standard Punjabi by the Sikh Gurus.[37]\n\nIn Pakistan, the Standard Punjabi dialect is not referred to as the 'Majhi dialect', which may be considered as 'Indian terminology', rather simply as 'Standard Punjabi'. This dialect is widely used in the TV and entertainment industry, which is mainly produced in Lahore.\n\nEastern Punjabi\n\nThe Punjabi variety predominantly spoken in the Indian Punjab, and also by partition migrants and their descendants in Pakistan, is known as \"Eastern Punjabi\". It includes dialects like Malwai, Doabi, Puadhi and extinct Lubanki.[38]\n\nWestern Punjabi\n\nThe diverse group of Punjabi varieties spoken in the western areas of Pakistani Punjab, as well as in neighbouring Hazara region and parts of Azad Kashmir is known as \"Western Punjabi\" or \"Lahnda\" (لہندا, lit. 'western').[39] These include groups of dialects like Saraiki, Pahari-Pothwari, Hindko and extinct Inku; common dialects like Jhangvi, Dhanni and Thali which are usually grouped under the term Jatki Punjabi; and the mixed variety of Punjabi and Sindhi called Khetrani.[41]\n\nPhonology\n\nWhile a vowel length distinction between short and long vowels exists, reflected in modern Gurmukhi orthographical conventions, it is secondary to the vowel quality contrast between centralised vowels /ɪ ə ʊ/ and peripheral vowels /iː eː ɛː aː ɔː oː uː/ in terms of phonetic significance.\n\nVowels Front Near-front Central Near-back Back Close iː ਈ اِی uː ਊ اُو Near-close ɪ ਇ اِ ʊ ਉ اُ Close-mid eː ਏ اے oː ਓ او Mid ə ਅ اَ Open-mid ɛː ਐ اَے ɔː ਔ اَو Open aː ਆ آ\n\nThe peripheral vowels have nasal analogues. There is a tendency with speakers to insert /ɪ̆/ between adjacent a vowels as a separator. When the latter vowel is low-tone, this usually changes to /ʊ̆/.\n\nConsonants Labial Dental/\n\nAlveolar Retroflex Post-alv./\n\nPalatal Velar Uvular Glottal Nasal m ਮ م n ਨ ن[44] ɳ ਣ ݨ (ɲ) ਞ ن (ŋ) ਙ ن٘ Stop/\n\nAffricate tenuis p ਪ پ t̪ ਤ ت ʈ ਟ ٹ t͡ʃ ਚ چ k ਕ ک (q ਕ਼ ق) aspirated pʰ ਫ پھ tʰ ਥ تھ ʈʰ ਠ ٹھ t͡ʃʰ ਛ چھ kʰ ਖ کھ voiced b ਬ ب d̪ ਦ د ɖ ਡ ڈ d͡ʒ ਜ ج ɡ ਗ گ tonal ਭ بھ ਧ دھ ਢ ڈھ ਝ جھ ਘ گھ Fricative voiceless (f ਫ਼ ف) s ਸ س ʃ ਸ਼ ش (x ਖ਼ خ) voiced (z ਜ਼ ز) (ɣ ਗ਼ غ) ɦ ਹ ہ Rhotic ɾ~r ਰ ر ɽ ੜ ڑ Approximant ʋ ਵ و l ਲ ل ɭ ਲ਼ ࣇ[45] j ਯ ی\n\nNote: for the tonal stops, refer to the next section about Tone.\n\nThe three retroflex consonants /ɳ, ɽ, ɭ/ do not occur initially, and the nasals [ŋ, ɲ] occur only as allophones of /n/ in clusters with velars and palatals (there are limited exceptions, but these are archaic). The well-established phoneme /ʃ/ may be realised allophonically as the voiceless retroflex fricative [ʂ] in learned clusters with retroflexes. The phonemic status of the consonants /f, z, x, ɣ, q/ varies with familiarity with Hindustani norms, more so with the Gurmukhi script, with the pairs /f, pʰ/, /z, d͡ʒ/, /x, kʰ/, /ɣ, g/, and /q, k/ systematically distinguished in educated speech. The retroflex lateral is most commonly analysed as an approximant as opposed to a flap.[48][49] The voiceless aspirates /t͡ʃʰ, pʰ/ often soften to fricatives /ɕ, f/. This hardly happens with /kʰ, t̪ʰ/ into /x, θ/, and never with /ʈʰ/.[citation needed]\n\nIn very rare cases, the archaic isolated /ɲ/ and /ŋ/ phonemes in Shahmukhi may be represented with letters from Sindhi.[citation needed]\n\nDiphthongs\n\nLike Hindustani, the diphthongs /əɪ/ and /əʊ/ have mostly disappeared, but are still retained in some dialects.\n\nLong vowels /aː, iː, uː/ are treated as doubles of their short vowel counterparts /ə, ɪ, ʊ/ rather than separate phonemes, and instances of ai and au get monophthongised into /ɛː/ and /ɔː/. Hence, diphthongs like aī and āu phonotactically are stretched to aii and aau, whence the realised ai and au cause the sequences to be pronounced more as /ɛːi/ and /aɔː/ rather than /əiː/ and /aːʊ/.[citation needed]\n\nThe phoneme /j/ is very fluid in Punjabi. /j/ is only truly pronounced word-initially (even then it often becomes /d͡ʒ/), where it is otherwise /ɪ/ or /i/.\n\nTone\n\nUnusually for an Indo-Aryan language, Punjabi distinguishes lexical tones.[50] Three tones are distinguished in Punjabi (some sources have described these as tone contours, given in parentheses): low (high-falling), high (low-rising), and level (neutral or middle).[51][52][53] The transcriptions and tone annotations in the examples below are based on those provided in Punjabi University, Patiala's Punjabi-English Dictionary.[54]\n\nExamples Pronunciation Meaning Gurmukhi Shahmukhi Transliteration IPA Tone ਘਰ گھر ghar /kə̀.rᵊ/[55][i] low house ਕਰ੍ਹਾ کرھا karhā /kə́.ra/[56] high powdered remains of cow-dung cakes ਕਰ کر kar /kər/[57] level do, doing ਝੜ جھڑ jhaṛ /t͡ʃə̀.ɽᵊ/[58] low shade caused by clouds ਚੜ੍ਹ چڑھ chaṛh /t͡ʃə́.ɽᵊ/[59] high rise to fame, ascendancy ਚੜ چڑ caṛ /t͡ʃəɽ/[59] level hangnail\n\nLevel tone is found in about 75% of words and is described by some as absence of tone.[51] There are also some words which are said to have rising tone in the first syllable and falling in the second. (Some writers describe this as a fourth tone.)[51] However, a recent acoustic study of six Punjabi speakers in the United States found no evidence of a separate falling tone following a medial consonant.[60]\n\nਮੋਢਾ / موڈھا, móḍà (rising-falling), \"shoulder\"\n\nIt is considered that these tones arose when voiced aspirated consonants (gh, jh, ḍh, dh, bh) lost their aspiration. At the beginning of a word, they became voiceless unaspirated consonants (k, c, ṭ, t, p) followed by a high-falling tone; medially or finally they became voiced unaspirated consonants (g, j, ḍ, d, b), preceded by a low-rising tone. (The development of a high-falling tone apparently did not take place in every word, but only in those which historically had a long vowel.)[53]\n\nTonal H letter\n\nThe presence of an [h] (although the [h] is now silent or very weakly pronounced except word-initially) word-finally (and sometimes medially) often causes a rising tone before it, for example cá(h) \"tea\".[61]\n\nSyllable-initially, [h] causes a falling-tone after it, e.g. he > ʰè \"is\"[j]\n\nIn dialects with exemplified tone, ahā becomes ā̀, e.g. pahāṛ > pā̀ṛ[citation needed]\n\nSyllable-finally, [h] causes a rising-tone before it, e.g. cā(h) > cā́ \"tea\"\n\nThe series ih and uh are pronounced as rising-tone /éː/ and /óː/, e.g. ki(h)-ṛā > kḗṛā \"which\"[k]\n\nThere are few exceptions, e.g. tu-(h)ā-ḍē > twā̀ḍḍē[l] \"yours\" in the Majhi dialect and tu-(h)ā-ṛē > twā̀ṛē[m] \"yours\"\n\nThe series ahi and ahu are pronounced as rising-tone /ɛ́ː/ and /ɔ́ː/[n]\n\nSome dialects avoid using these for /éː óː ɛ́ː ɔ́ː/ and opt to either write them as ēh, ōh, eh, oh regardless of position or aspirate the following consonant, e.g. kihṛā > kēhṛā / kēṛhā\n\nThe Gurmukhi script which was developed in the 16th century has separate letters for voiced aspirated sounds, so it is thought that the change in pronunciation of the consonants and development of tones may have taken place since that time.[53]\n\nSome other languages in Pakistan have also been found to have tonal distinctions, including Burushaski, Gujari, Hindko, Kalami, Shina, and Torwali,[62] though these seem to be independent of Punjabi.\n\nGemination\n\nGemination of a consonant (doubling the letter) is indicated with adhak in Gurmukhi and tashdīd in Shahmukhi. Its inscription with a unique diacritic is a distinct feature of Gurmukhi compared to Brahmic scripts.\n\nAll consonants except six (ṇ, ṛ, h, r, v, y) are regularly geminated. The latter four are only geminated in loan words from other languages.[o]\n\nThere is a tendency to irregularly geminate consonants which follow long vowels, except in the final syllable of a word, e.g.menū̃ > mennū̃.[p] It also causes the long vowels to shorten but remain peripheral, distinguishing them from the central vowels /ə, ɪ, ʊ/. This gemination is less prominent than the literarily regular gemination represented by the diacritics mentioned above.\n\nBefore a non-final prenasalised consonant,[q] long vowels undergo the same change but no gemination occurs.\n\nThe true gemination of a consonant after a long vowel is unheard of but is written in some English loanwords to indicate short /ɛ/ and /ɔ/, e.g. ਡੈੱਡ ڈَیڈّ /ɖɛɖː/ \"dead\".\n\nGrammar\n\nMain article: Punjabi grammar\n\nPunjabi has a canonical word order of SOV (subject–object–verb).[64] Function words are largely postpositions marking grammatical case on a preceding nominal.[65]\n\nPunjabi distinguishes two genders, two numbers, and six cases, direct, oblique, vocative, ablative, locative, and instrumental. The ablative occurs only in the singular, in free variation with oblique case plus ablative postposition, and the locative and instrumental are usually confined to set adverbial expressions.[66]\n\nAdjectives, when declinable, are marked for the gender, number, and case of the nouns they qualify.[67] There is also a T-V distinction. Upon the inflectional case is built a system of particles known as postpositions, which parallel English's prepositions. It is their use with a noun or verb that is what necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case, and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or \"case-marking\" then lies. The Punjabi verbal system is largely structured around a combination of aspect and tense/mood. Like the nominal system, the Punjabi verb takes a single inflectional suffix, and is often followed by successive layers of elements like auxiliary verbs and postpositions to the right of the lexical base.[68]\n\nVocabulary\n\nBeing an Indo-Aryan language, the core vocabulary of Punjabi consists of tadbhav words inherited from Sanskrit.[69][70] It contains many loanwords from Persian and Arabic.[69]\n\nWriting systems\n\nThe Punjabi language is written in multiple scripts (a phenomenon known as synchronic digraphia). Each of the major scripts currently in use is typically associated with a particular religious group, although the association is not absolute or exclusive. In India, Punjabi Sikhs use Gurmukhi, a script of the Brahmic family, which has official status in the state of Punjab. In Pakistan, Punjabi Muslims use Shahmukhi, a variant of the Perso-Arabic script and closely related to the Urdu alphabet. Sometimes Punjabi is recorded in the Devanagari script in India, albeit rarely.[74] The Punjabi Hindus in India had a preference for Devanagari, another Brahmic script also used for Hindi, and in the first decades since independence raised objections to the uniform adoption of Gurmukhi in the state of Punjab, but most have now switched to Gurmukhi and so the use of Devanagari is rare. Often in literature, Pakistani Punjabi (written in Shahmukhi) is referred as Western-Punjabi (or West-Punjabi) and Indian Punjabi (written in Gurmukhi) is referred as Eastern-Punjabi (or East-Punjabi), although the underlying language is the same with a very slight shift in vocabulary towards Islamic and Sikh words respectively.[78]\n\nThe written standard for Shahmukhi also slightly differs from that of Gurmukhi, as it is used for western dialects, whereas Gurumukhi is used to write eastern dialects.\n\nHistorically, various local Brahmic scripts including Laṇḍā and its descendants were also in use.\n\nThe Punjabi Braille is used by the visually impaired. There is an altered version of IAST often used for Punjabi in which the diphthongs ai and au are written as e and o, and the long vowels e and o are written as ē and ō.\n\nSample text\n\nThis sample text was adapted from the Punjabi Wikipedia article on Lahore.\n\nGurmukhi\n\nਲਹੌਰ ਪਾਕਿਸਤਾਨੀ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਰਾਜਧਾਨੀ ਹੈ। ਲੋਕ ਗਿਣਤੀ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ਼ ਕਰਾਚੀ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਲਹੌਰ ਦੂਜਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡਾ ਸ਼ਹਿਰ ਹੈ। ਲਹੌਰ ਪਾਕਿਸਤਾਨ ਦਾ ਸਿਆਸੀ, ਕਾਰੋਬਾਰੀ ਅਤੇ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਦਾ ਗੜ੍ਹ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਇਸੇ ਲਈ ਇਹਨੂੰ ਪਾਕਿਸਤਾਨ ਦਾ ਦਿਲ ਵੀ ਕਿਹਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਲਹੌਰ ਰਾਵੀ ਦਰਿਆ ਦੇ ਕੰਢੇ ’ਤੇ ਵੱਸਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਸਦੀ ਲੋਕ ਗਿਣਤੀ ਇੱਕ ਕਰੋੜ ਦੇ ਨੇੜੇ ਹੈ।\n\nShahmukhi\n\nلہور پاکستانی پنجاب دی راجدھانی اے۔ لوک گݨتی دے نالؕ کراچی توں بعد لہور دوجا سبھ توں وڈا شہر اے۔ لہور پاکستان دا سیاسی، رہتلی کاروباری اتے پڑھائی دا گڑھ اے اتے، ایسے لئی ایہہ نوں پاکستان دا دل وی کہا جاندا اے۔ لہور راوی دریا دے کنڈھے تے وسدا اے۔ ایسدی لوک گݨتی اک کروڑ دے نیڑے اے۔\n\nTransliteration\n\nLahaur Pākistānī Panjāb dī rājtā̀ni ài.

After Karachi, Lahore is the second largest city. Lahore is Pakistan's political, cultural, and educational hub, and so it is also said to be the heart of Pakistan. Lahore lies on the bank of the Ravi River. Its population is close to ten million people.\n\nLiterature development\n\nMain article: Punjabi literature\n\nMedieval period\n\nFariduddin Ganjshakar (1179–1266) is generally recognised as the first major poet of the Punjabi language.[80] Roughly from the 12th century to the 19th century, many great Sufi saints and poets preached in the Punjabi language, the most prominent being Bulleh Shah. Punjabi Sufi poetry also developed under Shah Hussain (1538–1599), Sultan Bahu (1630–1691), Shah Sharaf (1640–1724), Ali Haider (1690–1785), Waris Shah (1722–1798), Saleh Muhammad Safoori (1747–1826), Mian Muhammad Baksh (1830–1907) and Khwaja Ghulam Farid (1845–1901).\n\nThe Sikh religion originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region and Punjabi is the predominant language spoken by Sikhs.[81] Most portions of the Guru Granth Sahib use the Punjabi language written in Gurmukhi, though Punjabi is not the only language used in Sikh scriptures.\n\nThe Janamsakhis, stories on the life and legend of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), are early examples of Punjabi prose literature.\n\nThe Punjabi language is famous for its rich literature of qisse, most of which are about love, passion, betrayal, sacrifice, social values and a common man's revolt against a larger system. The qissa of Heer Ranjha by Waris Shah (1706–1798) is among the most popular of Punjabi qissas. Other popular stories include Sohni Mahiwal by Fazal Shah, Mirza Sahiban by Hafiz Barkhudar (1658–1707), Sassui Punnhun by Hashim Shah (c. 1735–c. 1843), and Qissa Puran Bhagat by Qadaryar (1802–1892).[82]\n\nHeroic ballads known as Vaar enjoy a rich oral tradition in Punjabi. Famous Vaars are Chandi di Var (1666–1708), Nadir Shah Di Vaar by Najabat and the Jangnama of Shah Mohammad (1780–1862).[83]\n\nModern period\n\nThe Victorian novel, Elizabethan drama, free verse and Modernism entered Punjabi literature through the introduction of British education during the Raj. Nanak Singh (1897–1971), Vir Singh, Ishwar Nanda, Amrita Pritam (1919–2005), Puran Singh (1881–1931), Dhani Ram Chatrik (1876–1957), Diwan Singh (1897–1944) and Ustad Daman (1911–1984), Mohan Singh (1905–78) and Shareef Kunjahi are some legendary Punjabi writers of this period. After independence of Pakistan and India Najm Hossein Syed, Fakhar Zaman and Afzal Ahsan Randhawa, Shafqat Tanvir Mirza, Ahmad Salim, and Najm Hosain Syed, Munir Niazi, Ali Arshad Mir, Pir Hadi Abdul Mannan enriched Punjabi literature in Pakistan, whereas Jaswant Singh Kanwal (1919–2020), Amrita Pritam (1919–2005), Jaswant Singh Rahi (1930–1996), Shiv Kumar Batalvi (1936–1973), Surjit Patar (1944–) and Pash (1950–1988) are some of the more prominent poets and writers from India.\n\nStatus\n\nDespite Punjabi's rich literary history, it was not until 1947 that it would be recognised as an official language. Previous governments in the area of the Punjab had favoured Persian, Hindustani, or even earlier standardised versions of local registers as the language of the court or government. After the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British East India Company following the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, the British policy of establishing a uniform language for administration was expanded into the Punjab. The British Empire employed Urdu in its administration of North-Central and Northwestern India, while in the North-East of India, Bengali language was used as the language of administration. Despite its lack of official sanction, the Punjabi language continued to flourish as an instrument of cultural production, with rich literary traditions continuing until modern times. The Sikh religion, with its Gurmukhi script, played a special role in standardising and providing education in the language via Gurdwaras, while writers of all religions continued to produce poetry, prose, and literature in the language.\n\nIn India, Punjabi is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. It is the first official language of the Indian State of Punjab. Punjabi also has second language official status in Delhi along with Urdu, and in Haryana.\n\nIn Pakistan, no regional ethnic language has been granted official status at the national level, and as such Punjabi is not an official language at the national level, even though it is the most spoken language in Pakistan. It is widely spoken in Punjab, Pakistan,[84] the second largest and the most populous province of Pakistan, as well as in Islamabad Capital Territory. The only two official languages in Pakistan are Urdu and English.[85]\n\nIn Pakistan\n\nWhen Pakistan was created in 1947, despite Punjabi being the majority language in West Pakistan and Bengali the majority in East Pakistan and Pakistan as whole, English and Urdu were chosen as the official languages. The selection of Urdu was due to its association with South Asian Muslim nationalism and because the leaders of the new nation wanted a unifying national language instead of promoting one ethnic group's language over another, due to this the Punjabi elites started identifying with Urdu more than Punjabi because they saw it as a unifying force on an ethnoreligious perspective.[86] Broadcasting in Punjabi language by Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation decreased on TV and radio after 1947. Article 251 of the Constitution of Pakistan declares that these two languages would be the only official languages at the national level, while provincial governments would be allowed to make provisions for the use of other languages.[87] However, in the 1950s the constitution was amended to include the Bengali language.\n\nPunjabi is not a language of instruction for primary or secondary school students in Punjab Province (unlike Sindhi and Pashto in other provinces).[88] Pupils in secondary schools can choose the language as an elective, while Punjabi instruction or study remains rare in higher education. One notable example is the teaching of Punjabi language and literature by the University of the Punjab in Lahore which began in 1970 with the establishment of its Punjabi Department.[89][90]\n\nIn the cultural sphere, there are many books, plays, and songs being written or produced in the Punjabi-language in Pakistan. Until the 1970s, there were a large number of Punjabi-language films being produced by the Lollywood film industry, however since then Urdu has become a much more dominant language in film production. Additionally, television channels in Punjab Province (centred on the Lahore area) are broadcast in Urdu. The preeminence of Urdu in both broadcasting and the Lollywood film industry is seen by critics as being detrimental to the health of the language.[91][92]\n\nThe use of Urdu and English as the near-exclusive languages of broadcasting, the public sector, and formal education have led some to fear that Punjabi in Pakistan is being relegated to a low-status language and that it is being denied an environment where it can flourish. Several prominent educational leaders, researchers, and social commentators have echoed the opinion that the intentional promotion of Urdu and the continued denial of any official sanction or recognition of the Punjabi language amounts to a process of \"Urdu-isation\" that is detrimental to the health of the Punjabi language[93][94][95] In August 2015, the Pakistan Academy of Letters, International Writer's Council (IWC) and World Punjabi Congress (WPC) organised the Khawaja Farid Conference and demanded that a Punjabi-language university should be established in Lahore and that Punjabi language should be declared as the medium of instruction at the primary level.[96][97] In September 2015, a case was filed in Supreme Court of Pakistan against Government of Punjab, Pakistan as it did not take any step to implement the Punjabi language in the province.[98][99] Additionally, several thousand Punjabis gather in Lahore every year on International Mother Language Day. Thinktanks, political organisations, cultural projects, and individuals also demand authorities at the national and provincial level to promote the use of the language in the public and official spheres.[100][101][102]\n\nIn India\n\nAt the federal level, Punjabi has official status via the Eighth Schedule to the Indian Constitution,[103] earned after the Punjabi Suba movement of the 1950s.[104] At the state level, Punjabi is the sole official language of the state of Punjab, while it has secondary official status in the states of Haryana and Delhi.[105] In 2012, it was also made additional official language of West Bengal in areas where the population exceeds 10% of a particular block, sub-division or district.[12]\n\nBoth union and state laws specify the use of Punjabi in the field of education. The state of Punjab uses the Three Language Formula, and Punjabi is required to be either the medium of instruction, or one of the three languages learnt in all schools in Punjab.[106] Punjabi is also a compulsory language in Haryana,[107] and other states with a significant Punjabi speaking minority are required to offer Punjabi medium education.[dubious – discuss]\n\nThere are vibrant Punjabi language movie and news industries in India, however Punjabi serials have had a much smaller presence within the last few decades in television due to market forces.[108] Despite Punjabi having far greater official recognition in India, where the Punjabi language is officially admitted in all necessary social functions, while in Pakistan it is used only in a few radio and TV programs, attitudes of the English-educated elite towards the language are ambivalent as they are in neighbouring Pakistan.[103]: 37 There are also claims of state apathy towards the language in non-Punjabi majority areas like Haryana and Delhi.[109][110][111]\n\nAdvocacy\n\nPunjabi University was established on 30 April 1962, and is only the second university in the world to be named after a language, after Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The Research Centre for Punjabi Language Technology, Punjabi University, Patiala[112] is working for development of core technologies for Punjabi, Digitisation of basic materials, online Punjabi teaching, developing software for office use in Punjabi, providing common platform to Punjabi cyber community.[113] Punjabipedia, an online encyclopaedia was also launched by Patiala university in 2014.[114][115]\n\nThe Dhahan Prize was created to award literary works produced in Punjabi around the world. The Prize encourages new writing by awarding $25,000 CDN annually to one \"best book of fiction\" published in either of the two Punjabi scripts, Gurmukhi or Shahmukhi. Two second prizes of $5,000 CDN are also awarded, with the provision that both scripts are represented among the three winners. The Dhahan Prize is awarded by Canada India Education Society (CIES).[116]\n\nGovernmental academies and institutes\n\nThe Punjabi Sahit academy, Ludhiana, established in 1954[117][118] is supported by the Punjab state government and works exclusively for promotion of the Punjabi language, as does the Punjabi academy in Delhi.[119] The Jammu and Kashmir academy of art, culture and literature[120] in Jammu and Kashmir UT, India works for Punjabi and other regional languages like Urdu, Dogri, Gojri etc. Institutions in neighbouring states[121] as well as in Lahore, Pakistan[122] also advocate for the language.\n\nPunjabi Sahit Academy, Ludhiana, 1954\n\nPunjabi Academy, Delhi, 1981–1982\n\nJammu and Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Literature\n\nPunjab Institute of Language, Art and Culture, Lahore, 2004\n\nSoftware\n\nSoftware is available for the Punjabi language on almost all platforms. This software is mainly in the Gurmukhi script. Nowadays, nearly all Punjabi newspapers, magazines, journals, and periodicals are composed on computers via various Punjabi software programmes, the most widespread of which is InPage Desktop Publishing package. Microsoft has included Punjabi language support in all the new versions of Windows and both Windows Vista, Microsoft Office 2007, 2010 and 2013, are available in Punjabi through the Language Interface Pack[123] support. Most Linux Desktop distributions allow the easy installation of Punjabi support and translations as well.[124] Apple implemented the Punjabi language keyboard across Mobile devices.[125] Google also provides many applications in Punjabi, like Google Search,[126] Google Translate[127] and Google Punjabi Input Tools.[128]\n\nGallery\n\nGuru Granth Sahib in Gurmukhi\n\nPunjabi Gurmukhi script\n\nPunjabi Shahmukhi script\n\nBulleh Shah poetry in Punjabi (Shahmukhi script)\n\nMunir Niazi poetry in Punjabi (Shahmukhi script)\n\nGurmukhi alphabet\n\nA sign board in Punjabi language along with Hindi at Hanumangarh, Rajasthan, India\n\nSee also\n\nPunjab portal\n\nLanguages portal\n\nBhangra (music) – Upbeat type of popular music associated with British Punjabi culture\n\nKhalsa bole – coded language of Nihang Sikhs largely based on Punjabi\n\nList of Punjabi-language newspapers\n\nPunjabi cinema\n\nPunjabi Language Movement\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\nBhatia, Tej. 1993 and 2010.
