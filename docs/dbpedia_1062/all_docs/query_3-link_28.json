        "text": "The Census Bureau determined the non-English languages by using the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates to identify language groups with a high number of limited-English speaking households. The definition of a “limited-English-speaking household,” as used in the current ACS estimates, is as follows: no member 14 years old and over speaks only English at home or speaks a language other than English at home and speaks English “very well.”\n\nIn determining the languages, the Census Bureau followed the process outlined below:\n\nCreated tabulations of languages spoken by limited-English-speaking households, at the national, regional, and state levels.\n\nTranscribed to a list the languages spoken by at least 2,000 limited-English-speaking households, sorted by the number of limited-English-speaking households, in descending order.\n\nAssessed these languages for translation feasibility, to ensure that the Census Bureau is able to provide effectively translated materials.\n\nAdded American Sign Language (ASL) to the list, to provide a video guide for ASL users.\n\nThis process yielded the languages below (in order—top to bottom, left to right). The Census Bureau will provide language guides, language glossaries, and a language identification card in these languages.\n\nIn determining the languages for Internet Self-Response and Census Questionnaire Assistance, the Census Bureau transcribed to a list the languages spoken by at least 60,000 limited-English-speaking households, sorted by the number of limited-English-speaking households, in descending order. This yielded the following 12 non-English languages: Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, Tagalog, Polish, French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Japanese.\n\nThe Census Bureau further determined that the field enumerator instrument and materials, bilingual paper questionnaire, and bilingual mailing will be supported in Spanish."
