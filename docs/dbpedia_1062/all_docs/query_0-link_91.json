In other words, half of data (upper half of the digit shapes) was exploited for the recognition of Farsi numerical digits. This method can be used for both offline and online recognition. Half of data is more effective in speed process, data transfer and in this application accuracy. Hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to classify online Farsi digits. Evaluation was performed by TMU dataset. This dataset contains more than 1200 samples of online handwritten Farsi digits. The proposed method yielded more accuracy in recognition rate.\n\nThe Salman Mosque: Achmad Noeâmanâs Critique of Indonesian Conventional Mosque Architecture\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolik, A. A. R.; Aryanti, T.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe Salman Mosque, designed by Achmad Noeâman, was a striking Islamic architectural design in the 1960s when it was built. Unlike the conventional mosques, particularly in Indonesia, it has no dome. Instead, the roof was made of prestressed concrete and resembles a canoe. Using data drawn from field observations, this paper explores the architectural characteristics of the Salman Mosque as a product of Modern architecture. It argues that the domeless mosque, the simple minaret, the wooden wall panels and floor, the womenâs balcony, and the roof demonstrate architectural modernism, as opposed to the conventional mosque typology that flourished in Indonesia at the time. This paper further argues that the Salman Mosque is Noeâmanâs critique of the Indonesian conventional mosque architecture. It concludes that the architectural features of the Salman Mosque reflects Noeâmanâs modern vision of Islam and Islamic architecture.\n\nThe Value of Post-Colonial Literature for Education Processes: Salman Rushdie's \"Midnight's Children\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSchrottner, Barbara Theresia\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe author Salman Rushdie's post-colonial essay, \"Midnight's Children,\" highlights a different perspective on the problems created by the colonial power where place and displacement are central themes and migration is a painful but emancipating process; both are expressed through the life of the writer, Salman Rushdie.

The aim of this study was to adapt and examine the reliability and validity of the Farsi version of the YSEQ. This version was completed by 455 athletes aged 13â17 years. Results of confirmatory factor analysis indicated that two-factor solution showed a good fit to the data. The results also revealed that the Farsi YSEQ showed high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and good concurrent validity. This study indicated that the Farsi version of the YSEQ is a valid and reliable measure to assess team cohesion in sport setting.

Thirty-six healthy primarily Farsi-speaking Iranian adults completed Farsi-translated and adapted versions of three frequently used measures of executive/subcortical functioning: Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Trail Making Test (TMT), and Color Trails Test (CTT). Participants' performance on each measure was compared to published normative data resulting in 0-85% of cognitively and medically healthy individuals being classified as impaired depending on the executive/subcortical test score examined, with the highest impairment rates for specific WCST outcome scores. These findings raise questions for the use of published norms with Farsi-speaking Iranians residing in the US. The present study provided normative data from this group of Farsi-speaking Iranians on the Farsi-translated and adapted versions of the WCST, TMT, and CTT.\n\nHealth Information in Farsi (ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Û)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... and Driving Laws - ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Û (Farsi) MP3 Karen Chemical Dependency Taskforce of Minnesota How Beer and Alcohol Affect ...

The original scale was first translated into Farsi by language experts using the back translation procedure and then administered to a total of 252 Iranian college students and 52 psychiatric outpatients from psychiatric and psychological clinics. The one-week test-retest reliability of the Farsi version in a sample of college students was 0.78, indicating good temporal stability and corroborating the trait-like nature of scores. Cronbach's Î± was 0.90 for the college students and 0.92 for the psychiatric outpatients, indicating high internal consistency. Scale scores correlated 0.46 with Death Obsession Scale scores, 0.56 with Death Depression Scale scores, 0.41 with Death Anxiety Scale scores, and 0.40 with Wish to be Dead Scale scores, indicating good construct and criterion-related validity. A principal component analysis with a Varimax rotation yielded four factors in the sample of Iranian college students, indicating a lack of homogeneity in the content of the scale. Male students obtained a significant higher mean score than did females. It was concluded that the Farsi ASDA had good internal consistency, temporal stability, criterion-related validity, and a factor structure reflecting important features of death anxiety. In general, the Farsi ASDA could be recommended for use in research on death anxiety among Iranian college students and psychiatric outpatients.

Salmans, founder of The Good Samaritan sanitarium in Guanajuato].\n\nPubMed\n\nOlivier-Toledo, Carlos; Viesca-TreviÃ±o, Carlos\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this research we focus on the medical evangelist Levi B. Salmans, and The Good Samaritan sanitarium. Doctor Salmans lived in Mexico for about 50 years (1885-1935). During the first part of his stay, he was devoted to found churches and Methodist schools. However, from 1891 he took a turn in his career by founding dispensaries in different towns of Guanajuato to create, in 1899, the private charity association for the sick and infirm The Good Samaritan. His intense, intellectual, and practical work led him to create health journals, to train nurses, and to promote physiotherapies in accordance with the science advances of that time. By itself, this research shows that the history of medicine in Mexico still has long way to go and that Protestant communities, in favor of modernity and scientific knowledge, took a big part in shaping the history of this discipline in Mexico.\n\nToward an Instructional Philosophy: \"A Theoretical Framework for Teaching and Training at Salman Bin Abdulaziz University (SAU)\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nQandile, Yasine A.; Al-Qasim, Wajeeh Q.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to construct a clear instructional philosophy for Salman bin Abdulaziz University as a fundamental basis for teaching and training as well as a theoretical framework for curriculum design and development.

A valid and reliable instrument is needed for evaluation. This study was conducted to psychometrically evaluate a Spiritual Needs Questionnaire (SpNQ) for cancer patients in Iran. Methods: In this study, the methodology and psychometric properties of the Farsi version of the SpNQ (BÃ¼ssing et al., (2010)) were evaluated, based on the model proposed by Wilde et al., (2005). The study population included cancer patients referred to the largest referral center in Iran. Some 400 subjects were selected. Then, the content, face and construct validity, as well as the internal consistency and reliability of the Farsi version were assessed. Findings: In the confirmatory factor analysis, the original four-factor version with 19 phrases was not confirmed. Subsequently, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out in which phrases were included in three dimensions (peace and active giving, religion, and existence) that explained 48.1% of the variance. Later, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted, which showed a good fit of the model (CFI=0.94, GFI=0.94, RMSEA=0.071, and AGFI=0.96). Cronbachâs alpha was Î±=0.91 for the whole SpNQ. Cronbachâs alpha values ranged from 0.76 to 0.86 for the three factors. The intra-class correlation coefficient was ICC=0.82 between two tests performed with a two-week interval. Conclusion: The modified Farsi version of the SpNQ shows good psychometric properties for patients and can be used to investigate the spiritual needs of Iranian cancer patients.

There is a lack of easily accessible, low-threshold treatments taking the cultural background into account. Culturally Adapted CBT (CA CBT) is a well evaluated, transdiagnostic group intervention for refugees, using psychoeducation, meditation, and Yoga-like exercises. Objective: An uncontrolled pilot study with male Farsi-speaking refugees from Afghanistan and Iran was conducted to investigate feasibility with this ethnic group; a group for which no previous CBT trials have been reported. Method : The participants were nine Farsi-speaking, male refugees with M.I.N.I./DSM-IV diagnoses comprising PTSD, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Treatment components were adapted to the specific cultural framework of perception of symptoms, causes, ideas of healing, and local therapeutic processes. Before and after 12Â weeks of treatment, the primary outcome was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Secondary outcome measures were the Posttraumatic Checklist, Patient Health Questionnaire, Somatic Symptom Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ), and Emotion Regulation Scale (ERS). Results : Seven participants completed treatment. In the completer analysis, improvements were found on almost all questionnaires. Large effect sizes were seen for the GHQ-28 ( d Â =Â 2.0), WHOQOL-BREF scales ( d Â =Â 1.0-2.3), ASQ tolerating subscale ( d Â =Â 2.2), and ERS ( d Â =Â 1.7). With respect to feasibility, cultural adaptation seemed to be a crucial means to promote effectiveness. Conclusion : CA CBT may reduce general psychopathological distress and improve quality of life. Improvement in emotion regulation strategies may mediate treatment effects.

Communication Function Classification System is designed to classify the communication functions of individuals with cerebral palsy. Up until now, there has been no instrument for assessment of this communication function in Iran. The English Communication Function Classification System was translated into Farsi and cross-culturally modified by a panel of experts. Professionals and parents then assessed the content validity of the modified version. A backtranslation of the Farsi version was confirmed by the developer of the English Communication Function Classification System. Face validity was assessed by therapists and parents of 10 patients. The Farsi Communication Function Classification System was administered to 152 individuals with cerebral palsy (age, 2 to 18 years; median age, 10 years; mean age, 9.9 years; standard deviation, 4.3 years). Inter-rater reliability was analyzed between parents, occupational therapists, and speech and language pathologists. The test-retest reliability was assessed for 75 patients with a 14 day interval between tests. The inter-rater reliability of the Communication Function Classification System was 0.81 between speech and language pathologists and occupational therapists, 0.74 between parents and occupational therapists, and 0.88 between parents and speech and language pathologists. The test-retest reliability was 0.96 for occupational therapists, 0.98 for speech and language pathologists, and 0.94 for parents. The findings suggest that the Farsi version of Communication Function Classification System is a reliable and valid measure that can be used in clinical settings to assess communication function in patients with cerebral palsy.

The breastfeeding attrition prediction tools (BAPT) have been validated and used in predicting premature weaning. Objectives: We aimed to translate the BAPT into Farsi, assess its content validity, and examine its reliability and validity to identify exclusive breastfeeding discontinuation in Iran. Materials and Methods: The BAPT was translated into Farsi and the content validity of the Farsi version of the BAPT was assessed. It was administered to 356 pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy, who were residents of a city in northeast of Iran. The structural integrity of the four-factor model was assessed in confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Reliability was assessed using Cronbachâs alpha coefficient and item-subscale correlations. Validity was assessed using the known-group comparison (128 with vs. 228 without breastfeeding experience) and predictive validity (80 successes vs. 265 failures in exclusive breastfeeding). Results: The internal consistency of the whole instrument (49 items) was 0.775. CFA provided an acceptable fit to the a priori four-factor model (Chi-square/df = 1.8, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.049, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.064, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.911). The difference in means of breastfeeding control (BFC) between the participants with and without breastfeeding experience was significant (P < 0.001). In addition, the total score of BAPT and the score of Breast Feeding Control (BFC) subscale were higher in women who were on exclusive breastfeeding than women who were not, at four months postpartum (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study validated the Farsi version of BAPT. It is useful for researchers who want to use it in Iran to identify women at higher risks of Exclusive Breast Feeding (EBF) discontinuation.

This paper reports the cultural adaptation and psychometric properties of the Farsi version of the social skills rating system-secondary students form (SSRS-SS) questionnaire (Gresham and Elliot, 1990), in a normative sample of secondary school students. A two-phase design was used that phase 1 consisted of the linguistic adaptation and in phase 2, using cross-sectional sample survey data, the construct validity and reliability of the Farsi version of the SSRS-SS were examined in a sample of 724 adolescents aged from 13 to 19 years. Content validity index was excellent, and the floor/ceiling effects were low. After deleting five of the original SSRS-SS items, the findings gave support for the item convergent and divergent validity. Factor analysis revealed four subscales. RESULTS showed good internal consistency (0.89) and temporal stability (0.91) for the total scale score. Findings demonstrated support for the use of the 27-item Farsi version in the school setting. Directions for future research regarding the applicability of the scale in other settings and populations of adolescents are discussed.\n\nTranslation, Cross-cultural Adaptation and Validation of the Farsi Version of NIH Task Force's Recommended Multidimensional Minimal Dataset for Research on Chronic Low Back Pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nNoormohammadpour, Pardis; Tavana, Bahareh; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Zeinalizadeh, Mehdi; Mirzashahi, Babak; Rostami, Mohsen; Kordi, Ramin\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTranslation and cultural adaptation of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Task Force's minimal dataset. The purpose of this study was to evaluate validity and reliability of the Farsi version of NIH Task Force's recommended multidimensional minimal dataset for research on chronic low back pain (CLBP). Considering the high treatment cost of CLBP and its increasing prevalence, NIH Pain Consortium developed research standards (including recommendations for definitions, a minimum dataset, and outcomes' report) for studies regarding CLBP. Application of these recommendations could standardize research and improve comparability of different studies in CLBP. This study has three phases: translation of dataset into Farsi and its cultural adaptation, assessment of pre-final version of dataset's comprehensibility via a pilot study, and investigation of the reliability and validity of final version of translated dataset. Subjects were 250 patients with CLBP. Test-retest reliability, content validity, and convergent validity (correlations among different dimensions of dataset and Farsi versions of Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, Fear-Avoidance Belief Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory-II) were assessed. The Farsi version demonstrated good/excellent convergent validity (the correlation coefficient between impact dimension and ODI was râ=â0.75 [Pâ<â0.001], between impact dimension and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire was râ=â0.80 [Pâ<â0.001], and between psychological dimension and BDI was râ=â0.62 [Pâ<â0.001]). The test-retest reliability was also strong (intraclass correlation coefficient value ranged between 0.70 and 0.95) and the internal consistency was good/excellent (Chronbach's alpha coefficients' value for two main dimensions including impact dimension and psychological dimension were 0.91 and 0.82 [Pâ<â0.001], respectively). In addition, its face validity and content validity were\n\nPsychometric Properties of Physical Activity and Leisure Motivation Scale in Farsi: an International Collaborative Project on Motivation for Physical Activity and Leisure.\n\nPubMed\n\nZarei, Sahar; Memari, Amir-Hossein; Moshayedi, Pouria; Mosayebi, Fatolla; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Khoo, Selina; Morris, Tony\n\n2016-10-01\n\nGiven the importance of regular physical activity, it is crucial to evaluate the factors favoring participation in physical activity. We aimed to report the psychometric analysis of the Farsi version of the Physical Activity and Leisure Motivation Scale (PALMS). The Farsi version of PALMS was completed by 406 healthy adult individuals to test its factor structure and concurrent validity and reliability. Conducting the exploratory factor analysis revealed nine factors that accounted for 64.6% of the variances. The PALMS reliability was supported with a high internal consistency of 0.91 and a high test-retest reliability of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.97-0.98). The association between the PALMS and its previous version Recreational Exercise Motivation Measure scores was strongly significant (r= 0.86, P < 0.001). We have shown that the Farsi version of the PALMS appears to be a valuable instrument to measure motivation for physical activity and leisure.\n\nPsychometric properties of the Farsi version of modified Multidimensional Sexual Self-concept Questionnaire\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZiaei, Teyebe; Khoei, Effat Merghati; Salehi, Mehrdad; Farajzadegan, Ziba\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground: The awareness regarding the contribution of sexual self-concept to healthy sexual well-being is on a rise. The Multidimensional Sexual Self-concept Questionnaire (MSSCQ) was developed to assess the 20 aspects related to sexual self-concept and has been widely applied in Western societies. The adequacy of its application in Iran has not been determined in order to guaranty its reliability and validity. An attempt was made here to interpret this questionnaire in Farsi and adopt it in Iran with respect to psychometric properties of the native youth. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed and 352 couples were recruited from a premarital consulting center in Isfahan, Iran on a random basis. The MSSCQ was translated into Farsi and back-translated by four bilingual scholars. Face and content validity of the questionnaire was determined. Internal consistency was evaluated by applying Cronbach's alpha. Pearson correlation coefficient was employed. The adopted model was tested through confirmatory factor analysis using SPSS-AMOS software (version 16). Results: The mean age of couples was 25.68 years (women 23.92 Â± 2.92 years and men 27.44 Â± 3.14 years). The obtained Cronbach's alpha was 0.88. Twenty-two items with an impact score below 1.5 and content validity index <0.70 were omitted. Pearson correlation showed positive and negative correlations among the dimensions. Sexual anxiety, fear of sex, and sexual depression had negative correlation with the other dimensions (r = â0.36, r = â0.43, r = â0.32, respectively). The model exhibited adequate fitness: Ï2/df = 4.95, goodness-of-fit index = 0.95, adjusted goodness-of-fit index = 0.91, normed fit index = 0.94, comparative fit index = 0.95, and root mean square error of approximation = 0.07. Conclusion: The Farsi version of MSSCQ with 78 items is valuable and reliable to be applied on the youth in Isfahan. This questionnaire was verified under two main categories through confirmatory\n\nValidating the Farsi version of the Pregnancy Worries and Stress Questionnaire (PWSQ): An exploratory factor analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nNavidpour, Fariba; Dolatian, Mahrokh; Shishehgar, Sara; Yaghmaei, Farideh; Majd, Hamid Alavi; Hashemi, Seyed Saeed\n\n2016-10-01\n\nBiological, environmental, inter- and intrapersonal changes during the antenatal period can result in anxiety and stress in pregnant women. It is pivotal to identify potential stressors and prevent their foetal and maternal consequences. The present study was conducted to validate and examine the factor structure of the Farsi version of the Pregnancy Worries and Stress Questionnaire (PWSQ). In 2015, 502 Iranian healthy pregnant women, referred to selected hospitals in Tehran for prenatal care at 8-39 weeks of pregnancy, were recruited through a randomized cluster sampling. The PWSQ was translated into Farsi, and its validity and reliability were examined using exploratory factor analysis by SPSS version 21. The content validity of items on the PWSQ was between 0.63-1. The content validity index for relevance, clarity and simplicity were 0.92, 0.98, and 0.98, respectively, with a mean of 0.94. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0.863. Test-retest reliability showed high internal consistency (Î±=0.89; p<0.0001). The psychometric evaluation and exploratory factor analysis showed that the translated questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool to identify stress in Iranian pregnant women. Application of the questionnaire can facilitate the diagnosis of stress in pregnant women and assist health care providers in providing timely support and minimizing negative outcomes of stress and anxiety in pregnant women and their infants.\n\nFormant transitions in the fluent speech of Farsi-speaking people who stutter.\n\nPubMed\n\nDehqan, Ali; Yadegari, Fariba; Blomgren, Michael; Scherer, Ronald C\n\n2016-06-01\n\nSecond formant (F2) transitions can be used to infer attributes of articulatory transitions. This study compared formant transitions during fluent speech segments of Farsi (Persian) speaking people who stutter and normally fluent Farsi speakers. Ten Iranian males who stutter and 10 normally fluent Iranian males participated. Sixteen different \"CVt\" tokens were embedded within the phrase \"Begu CVt an\". Measures included overall F2 transition frequency extents, durations, and derived overall slopes, initial F2 transition slopes at 30ms and 60ms, and speaking rate. (1) Mean overall formant frequency extent was significantly greater in 14 of the 16 CVt tokens for the group of stuttering speakers. (2) Stuttering speakers exhibited significantly longer overall F2 transitions for all 16 tokens compared to the nonstuttering speakers. (3) The overall F2 slopes were similar between the two groups. (4) The stuttering speakers exhibited significantly greater initial F2 transition slopes (positive or negative) for five of the 16 tokens at 30ms and six of the 16 tokens at 60ms. (5) The stuttering group produced a slower syllable rate than the non-stuttering group. During perceptually fluent utterances, the stuttering speakers had greater F2 frequency extents during transitions, took longer to reach vowel steady state, exhibited some evidence of steeper slopes at the beginning of transitions, had overall similar F2 formant slopes, and had slower speaking rates compared to nonstuttering speakers. Findings support the notion of different speech motor timing strategies in stuttering speakers. Findings are likely to be independent of the language spoken. Educational objectives This study compares aspects of F2 formant transitions between 10 stuttering and 10 nonstuttering speakers. Readers will be able to describe: (a) characteristics of formant frequency as a specific acoustic feature used to infer speech movements in stuttering and nonstuttering speakers, (b) two methods of\n\nPsychometric properties of the Farsi version of effort-reward imbalance questionnaire: a longitudinal study in employees of a synthetic fibre factory in Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nYadegarfar, Ghasem; Alinia, Tahereh; Hosseini, Reihane; Hassannejad, Razieh; Fayaz, Mahsa; Sanati, Javad; Sanati, Kave; Harandi, Jalal; Hajnoorozali, Vahid; Baghi, Mahmood-Reza; Mirzavand, Enayat; Majeed, Azeem\n\n2013-02-01\n\nTo assess the reliability and validity of the Farsi version of the effort-reward imbalance questionnaire (F-ERIQ) and to examine the responsiveness of the tool to changes over time. A longitudinal study was carried out among 227 male employees of Iran Polyacryl Corporation. The F-ERIQ was developed through a forward-backward translation process that includes three scales of effort, reward and over-commitment (OC). Reliability and internal consistency of the F-ERIQ were assessed by split-half and Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Confirmatory factor analysis, convergent and discriminant validity were conducted to evaluate construct validity. Depressive mood was used as an indicator for exploring criterion validity. The variations in mean scores over time for scales were regarded as measures of the responsiveness to changes. Baseline split-half correlations for effort, reward and OC were 0.53, 0.85 and 0.65, respectively; Cronbach's alpha coefficients improved from 0.61 to 0.70 for effort, 0.85 to 0.88 for reward and 0.67 to 0.72 for OC. All of item-total correlations were higher than 0.23 and item-scales correlations were higher than 0.4. Although Values of Goodness of Fit Index and Adjusted GFI were higher than 0.9 and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, Root Mean Square Residual and Standardized RMR were lower than 0.05, confirmatory factor analysis only confirmed the construct of the effort and OC. People with higher job stress were at higher risk of depressive mood (at least 3 times more). Overall, the mean score of effort, OC and ERI increase, and the figures decrease for reward among people who experience changes. These findings provide evidence that the F-ERIQ is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing psychosocial stress at work among Farsi-speaking male employees. We propose that F-ERIQ be further evaluated across a variety of jobs and industries.\n\nPsychometric Properties of Farsi Version of the Wish to be Dead Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nDadfar, Mahboubeh; Lester, David; Atef Vahid, Mohammad Kazem; Abdel-Khalek, Ahmed M\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe Wish to be Dead Scale (WDS) is a new scale to measure precursors to suicidal ideation, and the aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric characteristics of a Farsi version of the WDS. The sample was a convenience sample of 145 Iranian female undergraduates and postgraduates selected from different faculties at Iran University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Using a principal component analysis and a varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization, three factors were identified and labeled: (a) lack of purpose and usefulness in life, (b) lack of interest in living, and (c) fantasizing about being dead. The WDS had good inter-item and test-retest reliability and significant positive correlations with scores on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10 and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and negative correlations with scores on the Adult Hope Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Love of Life Scale, the Life Orientation Test, and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. We conclude that the WDS may prove to be useful in clinical practice and research into suicide.\n\nSub-word image clustering in Farsi printed books\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSoheili, Mohammad Reza; Kabir, Ehsanollah; Stricker, Didier\n\n2015-02-01\n\nMost OCR systems are designed for the recognition of a single page. In case of unfamiliar font faces, low quality papers and degraded prints, the performance of these products drops sharply. However, an OCR system can use redundancy of word occurrences in large documents to improve recognition results. In this paper, we propose a sub-word image clustering method for the applications dealing with large printed documents. We assume that the whole document is printed by a unique unknown font with low quality print. Our proposed method finds clusters of equivalent sub-word images with an incremental algorithm. Due to the low print quality, we propose an image matching algorithm for measuring the distance between two sub-word images, based on Hamming distance and the ratio of the area to the perimeter of the connected components. We built a ground-truth dataset of more than 111000 sub-word images to evaluate our method. All of these images were extracted from an old Farsi book. We cluster all of these sub-words, including isolated letters and even punctuation marks. Then all centers of created clusters are labeled manually. We show that all sub-words of the book can be recognized with more than 99.7% accuracy by assigning the label of each cluster center to all of its members.\n\nPsychometric Properties of Farsi Version of the Revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdekhodaie, Ehsan; Arghabaei, Mohammad; Bahrami Ehsan, Hadi\n\n2016-02-18\n\nThis study examined the psychometric properties of the Farsi version of the Revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (Ollendick, 1983), namely the FSSC-FA, in a sample of Iranian children and adolescents (N = 394, 206 girls) aged 9-11:11 years. The internal consistency coefficient was found to range from .79 to .96 for total and subscale scores. The authors used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to determine the factor structure of the FSSC-FA. The results showed that a 71-item, six-factor model provided a satisfactory fit for the structure of the FSSC-FA (RMSEA = .07, 90% CIs [.068, .072], CFI = .94, NNFI = .94, Ï2/df = 2.94). With regard to gender and age differences in fears of the present sample, girls typically reported more fears than boys (Cohen's d = .28, 95% CIs [.08, .48], p < .001), but differences between older and younger participants were modest. The study also reported most common fears in the sample which were very similar to those reported by other studies except one item being specific to the Iranian population. Bearing in mind the limitations discussed, the results generally show that the FSSC-FA scores are valid and reliable to assess fears in Iranian youth.\n\nAIDS education in an Islamic nation: content analysis of Farsi-language AIDS-education materials in Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nKalkhoran, Sara; Hale, Lauren\n\n2008-09-01\n\nInconsistent statistics about the number of HIV/AIDS cases in Iran and misinformation about HIV/AIDS among Iranian adolescents necessitate proper understanding and knowledge of HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention. This is particularly important since many issues related to HIV/AIDS, such as sex, homosexuality, and drug use, are taboo topics in the Islamic world. We analyzed Farsi-language educational and informational small media items to ascertain the nature of HIV/AIDS-related material available in society. While all of the documents mentioned sexual contact as a means of transmitting the virus, and the majority (87%) mentioned condom use as a preventive means, mention of homosexuality (43%) and prostitution (17%) was lacking in most. Thus, mention of \"safe sex\" strategies was not avoided due to fear of promoting sex outside of marriage, as has been noted in other Islamic nations. Mention of intravenous drug use in 90% of the documents shows an acknowledgment of the drug problem in the nation, and an effort to curb its harmful sequelae. Therefore, while certain issues such as sex, condoms, and drug use were well represented in the documents analyzed, additional inclusion of topics such as homosexuality and prostitution, issues already discussed infrequently in society, can help to better educate the population and curb the spread of this life-threatening disease.\n\nThe case of Iranian immigrants in the greater Toronto area: a qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDastjerdi, Mahdieh\n\n2012-02-27\n\nIranians comprise an immigrant group that has a very different cultural background from that of the mainstream Canadian population and speaks a language other than English or French; in this case mainly Farsi (Persian). Although Iranian immigrants in Toronto receive a high proportion of care from Farsi-speaking family physicians and health care providers than physicians who cannot speak Farsi, they are still not satisfied with the provided services. The purpose of this study was to identify the obstacles and issues Iranian immigrants faced in accessing health care services as seen through the eyes of Iranian health care professionals/providers and social workers working in Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Narrative inquiry was used to capture and understand the obstacles this immigrant population faces when accessing health care services, through the lens of fifty Iranian health care professionals/providers and social workers. Thirty three health care professionals and five social workers were interviewed. To capture the essence of issues, individual interviews were followed by three focus groups consisting of three health care professionals and one social worker in each group. Three major themes emerged from the study: language barrier and the lack of knowledge of Canadian health care services/systems; lack of trust in Canadian health care services due to financial limitations and fear of disclosure; and somatization and needs for psychological supports. Iranians may not be satisfied with the Canadian health care services due to a lack of knowledge of the system, as well as cultural differences when seeking care, such as fear of disclosure, discrimination, and mistrust of primary care. To attain equitable, adequate, and effective access to health care services, immigrants need to be educated and informed about the Canadian health care system and services it provides. It would be of great benefit to this population to hold workshops on health topics, and mental health\n\nFacies analysis, diagenesis and sequence stratigraphy of the carbonate-evaporite succession of the Upper Jurassic Surmeh Formation: Impacts on reservoir quality (Salman Oil Field, Persian Gulf, Iran)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeigi, Maryam; Jafarian, Arman; Javanbakht, Mohammad; Wanas, H. A.; Mattern, Frank; Tabatabaei, Amin\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis study aims to determine the depositional facies, diagenetic processes and sequence stratigraphic elements of the subsurface carbonate-evaporite succession of the Upper Jurassic (Kimmeridgian-Tithonian) Surmeh Formation of the Salman Oil Field (the Persian Gulf, Iran), in an attempt to explore their impacts on reservoir quality. The Surmeh Formation consists mainly of carbonate rocks, intercalated with evaporite layers. Petrographically, the Surmeh Formation consists of nine microfacies (MF1-MF9). These microfacies are grouped into three facies associations related to three depositional environments (peritidal flat, lagoon and high-energy shoal) sited on the inner part of a homoclinal carbonate ramp. The recorded diagenetic processes include dolomitization, anhydritization, compaction, micritization, neomorphism, dissolution and cementation. Vertical stacking patterns of the studied facies reveal the presence of three third-order depositional sequences, each of which consists of transgressive systems tract (TST) and highstand systems tract (HST). The TSTs comprise intertidal and lagoon facies whereas the HSTs include supratidal and shoal facies. In terms of their impacts on reservoir quality, the shoal facies represent the best reservoir quality, whereas the peritidal and lagoonal facies exhibit moderate to lowest reservoir quality. Also, poikilotopic anhydrite cement played the most significant role in declining the reservoir quality, whereas the widespread dissolution of labile grains and formation of moldic and vuggy pores contributed in enhancing the reservoir quality. In addition, the HSTs have a better reservoir quality than the TSTs. This study represents an approach to use the depositional facies, diagenetic alterations and sequence stratigraphic framework of carbonate -evaporite succession for a more successful reservoir characterization.\n\nSpatial Metaphor in Language Can Promote the Development of Cross-Modal Mappings in Children\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nShayan, Shakila; Ozturk, Ozge; Bowerman, Melissa; Majid, Asifa\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPitch is often described metaphorically: for example, Farsi and Turkish speakers use a \"thickness\" metaphor (low sounds are \"thick\" and high sounds are \"thin\"), while German and English speakers use a height metaphor (\"low\", \"high\").

The woman is perceived as suffering from dementia symptoms, but has not received any formal diagnosis of the disease. More specifically, the study focuses on how the woman's contributions in her mother tongue, Farsi, are responded to by a carer, who is also multilingual and speaks Swedish as a second language (L2), but has a very limited knowledge of Farsi. The data consists of recorded material from a mundane morning activity in the residential home, as the woman is undressed and prepared to go to the shower. The method employed is conversation analysis, and the study addresses the interactional outcome of this type of multilingual encounters, highlighting the way the establishment of mutual understanding is negatively affected by the fact that the participants do not or only to a limited extent share a common language. Analysis of the data shows that most of the woman's contributions in Farsi are responded to in L2-Swedish by the carer, primarily by means of seven different response practices: soothing talk, instrumental talk, minimal responses, explicit expressions of understanding, mitigating talk, questions, and appraisal. The findings are discussed in light of new demands on Swedish (and Western) care- and health care systems to adapt to the increasing number of multilingual, older people, who will become residents in care facilities and attend day centers within the coming years.\n\nReliability, validity and factor structure of the CES-D in Iranian elderly.\n\nPubMed\n\nMalakouti, Seyed Kazem; Pachana, Nancy A; Naji, Borzooyeh; Kahani, Shamsoddin; Saeedkhani, Mozhdeh\n\n2015-12-01\n\nIn developing countries such as Iran, elder populations are growing. Due to the high prevalence of depressive disorders among elders, reliable screening instruments for this population are required. The main purpose of this study was to determine the reliability and validity of the Farsi version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale-10 (CES-D) among Iranian elderly persons. The investigators created the Farsi version of the CES-D-10 by translation and back translation. Two hundred and four cases aged 59 and above completed the questionnaire. The reliability and validity of the translated CES-D-10 was established through comparison with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a recognized gold standard method for diagnosing major depressive disorder. We used a receiver operating curve (ROC) to determine the optimum cutoff score. The Farsi version of the CED-D-10 displayed acceptable psychometric characteristics, as reflected in internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha, split-half coefficients and test-retest reliability of 0.85, 0.65 and 0.49, respectively. Factor analysis and the varimax rotation resulted in two factors including 'depression' and 'interpersonal relationships'. The Depression factor (introduced as CES-D-8 of the scale) had significant correlation with the 10 items form (r=0.99) with 0.87 alpha coefficient. The ROC showed that the optimum cutoff point is 5 with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 70%, and positive and negative predictive values of 26% and 98%, respectively, for both of the forms. Both the 10 and 8 items form of the Farsi version have desirable characteristics to be useful as a screening instrument for depressive disorders in Iranian elders, especially in urban areas.

Using citation evaluation, the librarians of the Acquisition Department can use quantitative methods to indentify core and popular resources among numerous information resources and make serious savings in the library's budget, by acquiring these core resources and eliminating useless ones. The aim of this study is assessing literature obsolescence and core journals' cost-benefit in citations of the 'Scientific Medical Journal of Ahwaz'. This study is a descriptive and cross-sectional survey that uses citation analysis. Sampling is objective sampling from all documents from years 1364 (1985) to 1385 (2006), and the population comprises of 6342 citations of the articles published in 'Scientific Medical Journal of Ahwaz'. Data collection is done through referring to the original documents and the data is analyzed using the Excel software, and for descriptive and analytical statistics the cost-benefit formula and Bradford law formula are used. Findings showed that the average citation for each document in the 'Scientific Medical Journal of Ahwaz' was 15.81. The average citation to international sources was 14.37, and the average citation to national sources was 1.44. The literature obsolescence of Farsi documents in this study was 15 years, while it was equal to 20 years for English documents. The highly cited Farsi journals were (sorted based on citation in descending order): 'Scientific Medical Journal of Ahwaz', 'Daroudarman', 'Nabz,' and 'Journal of Medical School, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences'. The highly cited English journals were (sorted based on citation in descending order): 'Pediatrics', 'The New England Journal of Medicine', 'Gastroenterology' and 'Medicine'. All of these four journals are part of the ISI database and have good impact factors in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR).

The procrastination assessment scale-student (PASS) evaluates academic procrastination apropos its frequency and reasons. Objectives: The aims of the present study were to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Farsi version of the PASS in a sample of Iranian medical students. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the PASS was translated into Farsi through the forward-backward method, and its content validity was thereafter assessed by a panel of 10 experts. The Farsi version of the PASS was subsequently distributed among 423 medical students. The internal reliability of the PASS was assessed using Cronbachâs alpha. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on 18 items and then 28 items of the scale to find new models. The construct validity of the scale was assessed using both EFA and confirmatory factor analysis. The predictive validity of the scale was evaluated by calculating the correlation between the academic procrastination scores and the studentsâ average scores in the previous semester. Results: The corresponding reliability of the first and second parts of the scale was 0.781 and 0.861. An EFA on 18 items of the scale found 4 factors which jointly explained 53.2% of variances: The model was marginally acceptable (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] =0.098, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] =0.076, Ï2 /df =4.8, comparative fit index [CFI] =0.83).

According to the guidelines of European Association of Urology (EAU), use of complementary treatments is recommended for PPS. In this preliminary study, analyzing the signs and symptoms of PPS from the viewpoint of Iranian traditional medicine (ITM) was helpful in selecting the appropriate alternative treatment. Case Presentation: Two male patients diagnosed with PPS were evaluated and treated according to the ITM. Each patient took 15 mL oxymel 45 minutes after lunch and dinner. For each patient, four clinical visits were made with one week intervals and the validated Farsi version of international prostate symptom score (IPSS) and numeric pain rating score (NPRS) were completed for them. Conclusions: Considering the fact that other major pathological causes are ruled out, many of the symptoms and signs observed in these patients were similar to those associated with flatulency-related diseases in ITM. Selecting treatment with oxymel was based on this view and led to improvements in the digestive and urinary symptoms according to Farsi version of the IPSS and NPRS.

However, there are practical and ethical challenges for engaging refugees as participants. Despite this, there have been no studies to date specifically investigating refugee perspectives on factors affecting engagement in health research. Language-concordant focus groups in British Columbia, Canada, with four government-assisted refugee language groups (Farsi/Dari, Somali, Karen, Arabic) inquired about willingness to participate in health research. Twenty-three variables associated with the willingness of refugees to participate in health research were elicited. Variables related to research design included recruitment strategies, characteristics of the research team members and the nature of the research. Variables related to individual participants included demographic features such as gender and education, attitudes towards research and previous experience with research. This research can be used to increase opportunities for refugees' engagement in research and includes recommendations for subgroups of refugees that may have more difficulties engaging in research.\n\nCommentary: The Khan Academy and the Day-Night Flipped Classroom\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nParslow, Graham R.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTeaching by night and reflecting on a subject by day is the way that Salman Khan sees education evolving in the age of online lectures.

We studied this question by comparing a visual capacity in the left and right visual hemifields in people habitually reading scripts written right-to-left or left-to-right. Selective visual attention is necessary for efficient visual search and also for the sequential recognition of letters in words. Because such attentional allocation during reading depends on the direction in which one is reading, asymmetries in search efficiency may reflect biases arising from the habitual direction of reading. We studied this by examining search performance in three cohorts: (a) left-to-right readers who read English fluently; (b) right-to-left readers fluent in reading Farsi but not any left-to-right script; and (c) bilingual readers fluent in English and in Farsi, Arabic, or Hebrew. Left-to-right readers showed better search performance in the right hemifield and right-to-left readers in the left hemifield, but bilingual readers showed no such asymmetries. Thus, reading experience biases search performance in the direction of reading, which has implications for the cause and effect relationships between reading and cognitive functions.

Being contrast to Arabic handwritten, Jawi, as a second method of Malay handwritten, has not been studied yet, but if any, there were a few references on it. The recent transformation in Malaysian education, the Special Education is one of the priorities in the Malaysia Blueprint. One of the special needs quoted in Malaysia education is dyslexia. A dyslexic student is considered as student with learning disability. Concluding a student is truly dyslexia might be incorrect for they were only assessed through Roman alphabet, without considering assessment via Jawi handwriting. A study was conducted on dyslexic students attending a special class for dyslexia in Malay Language to determine whether they are also dyslexia in Jawi handwriting. The focus of the study is to test the copying skills in relation to word reading and writing in Malay Language with and without dyslexia through both characters. A total of 10 dyslexic children and 10 normal children were recruited. In conclusion for future study, dyslexic students have less difficulty in performing Jawi handwriting in Malay Language through statistical analysis.\n\nEfficacy of a Newly Designed Cephalometric Analysis Software for McNamara Analysis in Comparison with Dolphin Software.\n\nPubMed\n\nNouri, Mahtab; Hamidiaval, Shadi; Akbarzadeh Baghban, Alireza; Basafa, Mohammad; Fahim, Mohammad\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCephalometric norms of McNamara analysis have been studied in various populations due to their optimal efficiency. Dolphin cephalometric software greatly enhances the conduction of this analysis for orthodontic measurements. However, Dolphin is very expensive and cannot be afforded by many clinicians in developing countries. A suitable alternative software program in Farsi/English will greatly help Farsi speaking clinicians. The present study aimed to develop an affordable Iranian cephalometric analysis software program and compare it with Dolphin, the standard software available on the market for cephalometric analysis. In this diagnostic, descriptive study, 150 lateral cephalograms of normal occlusion individuals were selected in Mashhad and Qazvin, two major cities of Iran mainly populated with Fars ethnicity, the main Iranian ethnic group. After tracing the cephalograms, the McNamara analysis standards were measured both with Dolphin and the new software. The cephalometric software was designed using Microsoft Visual C++ program in Windows XP. Measurements made with the new software were compared with those of Dolphin software on both series of cephalograms. The validity and reliability were tested using intra-class correlation coefficient. Calculations showed a very high correlation between the results of the Iranian cephalometric analysis software and Dolphin. This confirms the validity and optimal efficacy of the newly designed software (ICC 0.570-1.0). According to our results, the newly designed software has acceptable validity and reliability and can be used for orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning and assessment of treatment outcome.\n\nUsing Professional Presentations to Improve Cross-Cultural Communication\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nVozza, Victoria Moran\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this article, I explain how I used my interdisciplinary expertise in a TESOL classroom.

The aim of this study was to translate and investigate the reliability and validity of the Persian version of the FACIT-Sp. The 12 item spiritual well-being subscale of the FACIT-Sp Version 4 was translated into the Persian language, Farsi, using the FACIT translation methodology. The questionnaire was administered to a diverse sample of 153 patients in treatment for cancer. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's Î± coefficient, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to assess construct validity, and regression analysis was used to assess the predictor role of the FACIT-Sp in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Cronbach's Î± reliability coefficient for the FACIT-Sp subscales ranged from 0.72 to 0.90. The CFA generally replicated the original conceptualization of the three subscales of the FACIT-Sp12 (Peace, Meaning, and Faith). All three subscales significant predicted HRQOL. The Persian version of the FACIT-Sp scale is a reliable and valid tool for the clinical assessment of, and research into, the spiritual well-being of Muslim Iranian and Farsi-speaking patients in other regions of the world who are in treatment for cancer.\n\nMeasuring Stuttering in Preschool-Aged Children across Different Languages: An International Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBosshardt, Hans-Georg; Packman, Ann; Blomgren, Michael; Kretschmann, Jens\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMany speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are working in linguistically diverse communities and have to identify and measure stuttering in a language other than their own. The aim of the present study was to extend our understanding of how well SLPs can measure stuttering in other languages and to encourage collaboration between SLPs across cultures. Speech samples consisted of seven preschool-aged children each speaking one of the following languages: Danish, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Persian (Farsi). The judges were classified in seven groups of SLPs (n = 170) each speaking one of the seven languages of the children and two more English-speaking groups. Each judge rated the severity of stuttering in each child using a 10-point scale. The study was conducted over the Internet. Overall, the judges' proficiency in a child's language was not systematically related to the variability and agreement of the severity ratings, accounting for maximally 4.6% of the variance. SLPs should not be overly concerned about the appropriateness of their severity ratings if they feel less proficient in the native language of the stuttering children. It may also be encouraging for beginning clinicians that the severity ratings were not systematically related to professional experience. Â© 2016 S.
