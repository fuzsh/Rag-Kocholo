        "text": "Detailed Description\n\nThe following detailed description is made with reference to fig. 1 to 7.\n\nFirst, the background knowledge and technical terms are explained.\n\nThe most basic Braille symbol of Braille (Braille) is Braille as shown in fig. 5. Braille is composed of 6 dots. 64 kinds of variations, i.e., 64 dot symbols (blind symbols) can be formed according to whether the dots are filled or not. Braille ASCII codes can also be used in computers to represent braille, i.e., 64 dots correspond to 64 braille ASCII codes (ASCII character composition), as shown in fig. 6. The Braille ASCII code greatly facilitates Braille processing and is the standard input of equipment such as blind point display devices, Braille imprinter and the like.\n\nChina currently uses three braille: current braille, double-spelling braille, national universal braille. The current braille scheme (abbreviated as 'current braille') is the braille scheme promulgated by the ministry of education and promoted nationwide in 1953. The scheme is a set of Braille scheme which takes Beijing speech as a standard, takes Mandarin as a basis, takes words as a unit, expresses a complete syllable by three parts of sound, rhyme and tone, and records Chinese by adopting a Braille word segmentation and continuous writing rule. The existing braille has the advantages of easy learning and use, and has the obvious defects of nonstandard standard tone and redundant information. The Chinese double-spelling Braille scheme (called double-spelling Braille for short) is a Braille reform scheme which is successfully popularized by the national language and character work committee in 1988. The scheme can represent three elements of Chinese pronunciation, rhyme and tone in the blind symbols of two parties, and the whole system comprises: alphabet, punctuation, homophonic differentiation method, shorthand method, dumb sound word-fixing method, etc., and at the same time, the braille word-separating continuous writing rule is also adopted. The Chinese double-spelling Braille scheme aims at overcoming the defects of the existing Braille, but is difficult to learn and is only accepted by partial blind persons due to multiple symbol types and complicated rules compared with the existing Braille. In 2018, the Ministry of education, the national Federal of language and Chinese Union published the 'national Universal Braille Specification'. The national universal braille scheme (abbreviated as 'national universal braille') follows the consonants, vowels, tones, punctuation marks and the like of the existing braille. In order to accurately read and standardize the writing of national universal language by braille and fully realize the characteristic of tone of syllables of national universal language, the scheme establishes the general principle of all syllable tones and abolishes a tone-tagging system when needed. The scheme provides the specification of writing tone symbols according to the consonants, determines the shorthand forms of some Chinese characters and reduces the braille space. The scheme solves the problem of guessing and measuring the pronunciation when the braille is read, improves the ideographic function of the braille, greatly promotes the development of blind education and cultural career, and provides guarantee for braille informatization and blind barrier-free information exchange.\n\nThe three braille representations of the phrase \"blind translation of chinese\" are shown in table 1, and the current braille is the current braille in full tone, i.e., the character and tone.\n\nTABLE 1 Braille representation in blind translation of Han\n\nThe blank spaces belong to the braille ASCII codes,the braille character can carry braille word segmentation continuous writing information, wherein one of 64 changes of braille characters, namely 6 points are not filled, and the braille character is called as 'empty square'. The braille ASCII code of the national universal braille of the blind translation of Chinese is HV2M8 FVI2, and the word segmentation information is the blind/translation of Chinese. The \"Hanhao\" Braille ASCII code is \"HV 2M 8\". Braille of \"translate\" the braille ASCII code to \"FVI 2\". Braille of\n\nThe braille ASCII code of double-spelling braille is \"BF [? 6P 3B' with word segmentation information of \"Hanblindness/translation\". The braille ASCII code of Chinese blind is BF [? \". Where ang is 145 dots. Yangping plus 6 th point. And finally 1456. Is the corresponding braille ASCII code? .\n\nEnd-to-End Deep Learning (End-to-End Deep Learning): in the prior art, part of a data processing system or a learning system needs processing of multiple stages, and end-to-end deep learning omits the processing of the different stages and replaces the processing with a single neural network algorithm. Compared with the multi-stage processing of word segmentation, tone marking and braille synthesis of the existing Chinese blind translation system, the end-to-end deep learning is realized by training a single and larger neural network, the input of the neural network is Chinese text, and the output of the neural network is directly braille ASCII codes. Specifically, the end-to-end deep learning of the invention only needs to train data samples, so that the function mapping from Chinese text to Braille ASCII code can be learned, the steps of word segmentation, word spelling, synthesis processing and the like are directly bypassed, the system architecture can be simplified, and a plurality of independent components do not need to be built.\n\nNeural machine translation model: the method is a translation model for acquiring the mapping relation between Chinese text and Braille ASCII codes by using the deep learning neural network.\n\nKey-value pair (key value): each key corresponds to a corresponding numerical value and is used for generating a third dictionary corresponding to the second dictionary, namely an inverse Braille ASCII code dictionary corresponding to the Braille ASCII code dictionary. The third dictionary can convert the predicted results of the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 into braille ASCII code.\n\nControl corpus 100: the Chinese blind comparison corpus is characterized in that the storage contents of a first corpus representing Chinese corpus and a second corpus representing Braille corpus are the same. Each braille sentence in the braille linguistic data has a definite corresponding Chinese sentence in the Chinese linguistic data. Every blind character in the braille sentence has a definite corresponding Chinese character or phrase in the Chinese sentence.\n\nThe optimal hyper-parameter is as follows: the hyper-parameters are parameters that are set before the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 starts the learning process, and are not parameter data obtained by training. In general, in the learning process, the hyper-parameters need to be optimized, and a set of optimal hyper-parameters is selected for the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200, so as to improve the learning performance and effect.\n\nThe special content is as follows: in text conversion, special situations are encountered, for example, arabic numerals, english letters and special symbols are sometimes mixed in chinese text, and braille needs special treatment in the case of \"numerals + quantifier\" and the year, month and day in digital form, for example, a connector is added after the numerals.\n\nExample 1\n\nAs shown in fig. 1 and fig. 2, this embodiment discloses a hanceblindness translation method based on end-to-end neural machine translation, and under the condition of not causing conflict or contradiction, the whole and/or part of the contents of the preferred embodiments of other embodiments can be used as a supplement to this embodiment.\n\nAs shown in fig. 1, the hanceanopia translation method disclosed in this embodiment includes the following steps:\n\ns100: a comparison corpus 100 for converting at least three Chinese texts into Braille ASCII codes is constructed based on the existing Braille, the double-spelling Braille and the national universal Braille. The control corpus 100 is converted from a one-to-one mapping of chinese to braille ASCII codes. The control corpus 100 is constructed directly from existing braille numeric resources. The control corpus 100 is a single chinese to braille ASCII code conversion. The control corpus 100 is constructed based on existing unprocessed braille numeric resources. Preferably, the present invention can directly construct the chinese-to-braille ASCII code reference corpus using the existing braille digital resources, or convert the chinese-to-braille character reference corpus into the chinese-to-braille ASCII code reference corpus. The comparison corpus 100 used in the prior art needs to be processed by experts to obtain a braille segmentation continuous writing corpus and a standard tone corpus.\n\nS200: an end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 is constructed based on end-to-end deep learning. The end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 is capable of learning mapping functions for direct conversion of chinese text to braille ASCII code. The prior art typically looks for matches based on rules or extracts features through multiple neural network models. Generally, at least two steps of word segmentation and tone marking are adopted for translation respectively based on the Chinese Braille word segmentation and continuous writing rule and the characteristics of Chinese stress, one sound, multiple meanings and strong subjective property, so that at least two corresponding models are required to be constructed for translation, and the algorithm is complex. Therefore, with the increasing of training data samples, the difficulty of model construction, training time, cost, and the like increase exponentially, and translation efficiency is seriously affected. The invention is based on the end-to-end deep learning idea, directly bypasses a plurality of translation processing stages such as word segmentation, tone marking, synthesis and the like, translates through training a larger end-to-end neural machine translation model 200, can directly obtain the Braille translation result of the Chinese text in one step, and obviously improves the translation efficiency. In fact, compared with other languages, such as foreign languages like english, german, korean, and japanese, chinese in our country has the particularity of meaning, and accent, so that the existing braille, double-spelling braille, and national universal braille in our country all have three elements of sound, rhyme, and tone. Therefore, since birth, the Chinese blind translation technology in China follows a word segmentation and continuous writing mechanism, and carries out translation from two steps of word segmentation and tone marking respectively, and further, in the prior art, multi-step conversion processing is carried out by two steps of word segmentation and tone marking respectively. Even if the latest blind Chinese translation method based on deep learning is adopted, in order to improve the accuracy of translation, two models are respectively constructed according to word segmentation and standard tone for translation. The invention breaks through the technical prejudice of a multi-stage processing translation mode which needs to at least respectively construct a word segmentation model and a tone marking model, constructs an end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 for directly learning a mapping function from Chinese text to Braille conversion for translation from the viewpoint of improving the translation accuracy and the translation efficiency and quality. Compared with the existing Han blind translation system, the end-to-end neural machine translation model of the invention needs a large amount of training data or training samples and training time to improve the accuracy of translation, namely the accuracy of translation is inferior to that of the existing Han blind translation mode of multi-stage processing under the condition of limited training data or training samples and training time. However, with the increasing of training data, the translation method of the relative multi-stage processing can remarkably improve the text quality of braille translation in a short time, at a low cost and with reduced system complexity.\n\nPreferably, the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 builds a mapping function. The input of the mapping function is a chinese sentence and the output is continuously generated braille ASCII codes. The end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 builds the mapping function in a way that equal length labels sentences. The end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 builds a mapping function based on at least the input, output, input-output information. Preferably, in the case of constructing the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200, the method further comprises step S210. Step S210 is as follows:\n\nfirst corpus about chinese corpus and second corpus for representing braille against the first corpus are obtained based on the control corpus 100. Preferably, the first corpus and the second corpus are preprocessed. The preprocessed first and second corpora are converted into computer information needed by the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200. Preferably, the computer information comprises at least a first dictionary and a second dictionary. The first dictionary corresponds to a first corpus. The second dictionary corresponds to the second corpus. Preferably, the third dictionary is generated based on key-value pair swapping of the second dictionary. The third dictionary can convert the prediction results generated when the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 translates into braille ASCII codes. Preferably, the third dictionary is an inverse braille ASCII code dictionary corresponding to braille ASCII code dictionary capable of converting the prediction result of the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 into braille ASCII code.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the step of preprocessing the first corpus and the second corpus to convert into computer information required by the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 comprises at least:\n\nA. and traversing the first corpus and the second corpus to generate a dictionary. The dictionary includes at least a first dictionary and a second dictionary. The first dictionary corresponds to a first corpus. The second dictionary corresponds to the second corpus. Preferably, the special content is added to the dictionary based on whether the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 requires the addition of special content. Preferably, the 0 key of the first dictionary corresponds to a zero-filled token of a chinese sentence. The 1 key of the first dictionary corresponds to the beginning tag of a chinese sentence. The 2-key of the first dictionary corresponds to an end marker of a chinese sentence. The 0 key of the second dictionary corresponds to the zero-filled flag of the braille sentence. The 1 key of the second dictionary corresponds to the start mark of the braille sentence. The 2-key of the second dictionary corresponds to an end marker of the braille sentence.\n\nB. And segmenting the first corpus and the second corpus at least based on the Chinese punctuation marks and the truncation length so as to respectively obtain Chinese sentences and Braille sentences. The Chinese sentence corresponds to the segmentation result of the first corpus. The blind sentences correspond to the segmentation results of the second corpus. Preferably, the chinese punctuation marks may be commas, periods, exclamation marks, question marks, etc. Preferably, the truncation length may be 48. Preferably, the second corpus is segmented into braille sentences against chinese sentences based on the segmentation position information of the first corpus. The maximum length of the chinese sentence and the blind sentence is recorded. The maximum length of a chinese sentence is the first maximum length. The maximum length of the braille sentence is the second maximum length. The maximum lengths of the chinese sentences and the braille sentences may be different, i.e., the first maximum length is different from the second maximum length.\n\nC. And respectively marking the Chinese sentences and the Braille sentences obtained by segmentation. Preferably, the step of marking based on the chinese sentences and braille sentences obtained after the segmentation respectively is as follows:\n\nadding a start mark at the head of the Chinese sentence and the braille sentence, and adding an end mark at the tail of the Chinese sentence and the braille sentence. Preferably, in the case where the length of the chinese sentence is less than the first maximum length, the zero padding flag is added after the end flag of the chinese sentence. In case that the length of the braille sentence is less than the second maximum length, a zero padding flag is added after the technical flag of the braille sentence. Preferably, a chinese sentence is used as a first input to the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 and a braille sentence is used as a second input to the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200.\n\nD. Chinese sentences and braille sentences are converted to a digital representation by a dictionary. Preferably, the data represented by the transformed numbers may be randomly extracted as part of the test set and the remainder as the training set. Preferably, 10% of the data can be randomly extracted as a test set.\n\nPreferably, the accuracy of the existing automatic Chinese blind conversion method and system based on the deep neural network is obviously superior to that of the method based on the pure Braille corpus and the traditional machine learning model. The existing blind Chinese character conversion method based on deep learning comprises the steps of firstly establishing a Braille word segmentation continuous writing corpus, and labeling each Chinese character as four word positions of BMES (B represents the beginning of a word, M represents the middle of the word, E represents the end of the word, and S represents a single word) by using a BilSTM model. And then, establishing a tone marking corpus, dividing the Chinese characters from punctuation marks, and then performing tone marking on the Chinese characters by using a bi-gram language model. After completing the word segmentation and the tone marking, the Chinese character text completing the continuous writing and the tone marking of the braille is converted into the braille by utilizing the pronunciation dictionary and the pronunciation-braille mapping table. This approach does not fully utilize the contextual information in the Chinese to Braille conversion, as bi-gram language models can only utilize very limited information in the indexing step. The end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 of the present invention builds a mapping function for inputting a chinese sentence and outputting a continuously generated braille ASCII code in a manner of marking sentences with equal length, instead of translating in a manner of marking lexemes. The method of marking word positions limits the translation from Chinese to Braille to the sentence environment to be translated, and can not effectively utilize context information. For example, the invention equates blind translation of Chinese into input Chinese sentences and output as continuously generated braille ASCII codes. Let model inputs of the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200:\n\nXï¼(xstart,x1,x2,â¦,xi,â¦,xn,xend,xpad,â¦)\n\nxstartthe marker sentence starts. x is the number ofendThe marker sentence ends. Input sentence x for too shortpadAnd (5) filling. x is the number of1,x2,â¦,xi,â¦,xnFor inputting Chinese sentences, e.g. (x)1,x2,x3,x4) Canoured (han, blind, translated).\n\nLet the model output sequence of the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200:\n\nYï¼(y1,y2,â¦,yi,â¦,yn,yend)\n\nyendthe marking model should stop generating braille ASCII codes. y is1,y2,â¦,yi,â¦,ynASCII codes sequentially generated for models, e.g. (y)1,y2,â¦,yi,â¦,y10)ï¼(H,V,2,M,8,,F,V,I,2)ã\n\nS300: an end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 is trained based on the existing unprocessed control corpus 100. An end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 is trained based on the control corpus 100 of chinese text to braille ASCII code conversions. An end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 is trained against the corpus of speech 100 based on a single chinese text to braille ASCII code conversion. The control corpus 100 includes at least resources for braille ASCII code conversion of the chinese text. The control corpus 100 may be a single source of braille ASCII code conversion for chinese text. The control corpus 100 is not divided into a participle corpus and a tone corpus. The control corpus 100 is sentence-level chinese text and braille correspondence. The existing Chinese blind translation method or system based on deep learning does not directly apply the Braille rule to divide the words of the Braille strings, but applies the Chinese blind sentence level and word level contrast corpus training word division model, and applies the trained model to directly divide the words of the Chinese strings according to the Braille rule. On the other hand, the Chinese blind participles are used for training the benchmarking model by comparing the corpora, compared with a method only adopting the Braille corpora, the utilized information is richer, and higher accuracy can be obtained. Namely, the existing Chinese blind translation method or system based on deep learning needs not only sentence level correspondence between Chinese texts and Braille texts, but also word level correspondence. Moreover, text content confusion may be caused by directories, page numbers and non-standard format marks, and a matching algorithm is required to realize accurate alignment of characters, so that a bilingual comparison corpus is constructed. In fact, the comparison corpus used in the prior art adopts the conversion of two steps of word segmentation and tone labeling, so that not only the braille word segmentation continuous writing corpus and the tone labeling corpus need to be constructed simultaneously, but also the problem of word-level accurate comparison needs to be solved. The invention breaks through the technical prejudice that the existing comparison corpus needs to establish the Braille word segmentation continuous writing corpus and the standard tone corpus at the same time and needs to accurately compare word levels, and can well train the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 by establishing the single Chinese to Braille ASCII comparison corpus 100 only by utilizing the existing Braille digital data. In addition, the comparison corpus 100 does not need expert processing and precise word-level comparison, is low in construction difficulty and short in time consumption, and remarkably reduces the cost.\n\nPreferably, after the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 obtains the computer information of the preprocessed first corpus and the preprocessed second corpus, the method performs the following steps:\n\nthe end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 learns the mapping function for direct conversion of Chinese text to Braille ASCII codes;\n\ncontinuously training based on the preprocessed first corpus and the preprocessed second corpus to obtain the optimal hyper-parameter of the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200;\n\nand adjusting the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 based on the optimal hyper-parameters to obtain a trained end-to-end neural machine translation model 200. Preferably, the trained end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 at least comprises end-to-end neural machine translation models 200 corresponding to current braille, double-spelling braille, national universal braille.\n\nPreferably, the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 employed in the present embodiment may be based on a Transformer model. The end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 may also be selected from other end-to-end neural machine translation models such as a Seq2Seq model based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To facilitate understanding of the construction method of the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 of the present embodiment, a Seq2Seq model based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is taken as an example for explanation.\n\nAs shown in FIG. 7, the model is a Seq2Seq model based on LSTM (RNN variant) and Attention. The chinese text input to the model as a braille result is a \"chinese blind translation\". And outputting the Braille ASCII code of the model as the national universal Braille. Wherein,\n\nembedding layer: the word vector dimension is 100 (each Chinese character is represented by a 100-dimensional vector);\n\nBilsTM layer: bidirectional LSTM (LSTM: RNN variant, long short term memory network), dimension 256;\n\nto the right: encoding the output of the Embedding layer into semantic vectors (hidden layer state vectors of the BilSTM layer) and transmitting the semantic vectors into an LSTM in a decoder;\n\nupwards: the BilSTM layer outputs an attention layer to generate an attention vector;\n\nLSTM layer: decoding semantic vectors, dimension 512;\n\nsoftmax layer: namely a Dense full connection layer with the activation function of softmax, combining the attention vector and the output of LSTM in a decoder, mapping the information into a 67-dimensional vector (64 Braille ASCII codes and marks of beginning, ending and zero padding), selecting the category with the highest probability, and sequentially generating the categories until the mark of ending is generated.\n\nS400: in the case of translation using the trained end-to-end neural machine translation model 200, the method performs the following steps:\n\npreprocessing the input Chinese text to convert to computer information needed by the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200;\n\nthe preprocessed chinese text is converted to braille ASCII code using the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200.\n\nThrough the arrangement mode, the invention has the beneficial effects that:\n\nin the prior art, generally, matching is searched based on rules or features are extracted through a plurality of neural network models, that is, translation is performed by at least two steps of word segmentation and standard tone, so that at least two corresponding neural network models also need to be constructed for translation. Therefore, the difficulty, training time, cost, and the like of model construction increase exponentially with the increase of training data samples in the way of the pipelined translation of multiple processing stages. The invention is based on the end-to-end deep learning idea, directly bypasses a plurality of translation processing stages such as word segmentation, tone marking, synthesis and the like, translates through training a huge end-to-end neural machine translation model 200, can directly obtain the Braille translation result of the Chinese text in one step, and can obviously improve the accuracy of Braille translation in short time, low cost and reduced system complexity compared with a multi-stage processing translation mode along with the continuous increase of training data.\n\nExample 2\n\nAs shown in fig. 3 and fig. 4, the present embodiment discloses a hanceblindness translation system based on end-to-end neural machine translation. The preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in whole and/or in part in the context of other embodiments, which can supplement the present embodiment, without resulting in conflict or inconsistency.\n\nA blind Chinese translation system based on end-to-end neural machine translation at least comprises a conversion logic layer 300 which provides a conversion strategy for a user and uses the conversion strategy to convert Chinese texts input by the user into Braille. Translation logic layer 300 is configured to: constructing a contrast corpus 100 for converting at least three Chinese texts into Braille ASCII codes based on the current Braille, the double-spelling Braille and the national universal Braille; constructing an end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 capable of learning a mapping function for directly converting Chinese texts into Braille ASCII codes based on end-to-end deep learning; the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200 is trained based on an existing unprocessed single chinese text to braille ASCII code converted control corpus 100.

The preprocessing unit 312 is configured to segment and label the chinese text transmitted by the chinese text obtaining unit 311 to convert the chinese text into computer information required for obtaining the end-to-end neural machine translation model 200.
