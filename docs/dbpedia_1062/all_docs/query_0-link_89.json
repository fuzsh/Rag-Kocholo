        "text": "The Internet has fundamentally changed the realities of the distribution of scientific knowledge and the dealing with cultural heritage. In the age of the analogue perceiving and the digital processing, the Processual Arts have become a significant part of our networked ‘information society’: The videographic, auditive, installative, and performative arts as well as virtual and hypertextual cultural practices (all kinds of Internet-generated ‘material’ including live- and interactive-events) have become omnipresent while increasingly interpenetrating each other. At the same time, the notions such as the ‘performativity of archives’1 or the ‘archive as an event’ derive not least from the often forgotten truism, that things can never be entirely perceived, and that the expiration of data can only be avoided by a proactive, vital archival practice. The reasons for developing new approaches to the archives lie in my view not least in the sometimes hidden, but deep dispositions and alliances between Art History and Visual Culture: among today's rampant picture models are conceived, dreamed or gestural ‘images’.\n\nArchival theory and archival metaphor remain at the center of new interpretations of computational culture. Very little can be done in contemporary society without leaving a data trace. Extraction and manipulation of data have come to define contemporary capitalism. These accumulations of data constitute vast archives whose functions and impact are increasingly investigated through an archival lens. This paper reflects on the work of a range of scholars exploring new archival paradigms. It focuses on our growing understanding of the implications of digital materiality for the production and transmission of knowledge.\n\nThe concept of the archive has expanded into areas beyond the classical archive to art, philosophy, and new textual and media practices. Simultaneously, these new practices both resist and transform the archival impulse, perhaps creating what one could call a new “anarchival” condition.

The record has grown over several decades with an established approach to the long term care and dissemination of documentary archives. We have been collecting digital archives since the early 1990s, but current approaches to describing and sharing digital archives are essentially a skeuomorph of traditional analogue methods — simply an activity at the end of the project or something ‘the archive does’. For preservation of digital data to succeed, it requires collaboration between data creators and curators at an early stage. Digital formats offer new opportunities and insights beyond analogue archives and yet traditional approaches hinder the potential for maximising this knowledge. Digital archiving cannot simply mean the continuation of existing archival practices but requires collaboration at an early stage to ensure consistency of approach, to deliver efficiencies and benefits beyond individual projects and make connections across digital collections.\n\nThe e-depot for Dutch archaeology started as a project at Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) in 2004 and developed into a successful service, which has ever since been part of the national archaeological data workflow of the Netherlands.While continuously processing archaeological datasets and publications and developing expertise regarding data preservation, various developments are taking place in the data landscape and direct involvement is necessary to ensure that the needs of the designated community are best met. Standard protocols must be defined for the processing of data with the best guarantees for long-term preservation and accessibility. Monitoring the actual use of file formats and the use of their significant characteristics within specific scientific disciplines is needed to keep strategies up-to-date.National developments includes the definition of a national metadata exchange protocol, its accommodation in the DANS EASY self-deposit archive and its role in...\n\nThe full proceedings can be found here: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2810/ TOC: Preface Paper 1: Emergent Archives and Crowdsourced Narratives: Two Development Stories from the Queensland State Library - Seth Ellis | Paper 2: Linked Data and Holocaust Era Art Markets: Gaps and Dysfunctions in the Knowledge Supply Chain - Laurel Zuckerman | Paper 3: Recognizing and Linking Entities in Old Dutch Text: A Case Study on VOC Notary Records - Barry Hendriks, Paul Groth, Marieke van Erp | Paper 4: Modelling Resolutions of the Dutch States General for Digital Historical Research - Marijn Koolen, Rik Hoekstra, Ida Nijenhuis, Ronald Sluijter, Esther van Gelder, Rutger van Koert, Gijsjan Brouwer, Hennie Brugman | Paper 5: From Digitized Sources to Digital Data: Behind the Scences of (Critically) Enriching a Digital Heritage Collection - Lorella Viola, Antonio Maria Fiscarelli | Paper 6: Visualizing and Contexualizing Outliers in Aegean Seal Collections - Bartosz Bogacz, Sarah Finlayson, Diamantis Panagiotopolous, Hubert Mara | Paper 7: Supporting Natural History Collections by Connecting Collections - Constance Rinaldo, Danielle Castronovo, Joseph DeVeer, Diane Rielinger | Paper 8: A High-Performance Word Recognition System for the Biological Fieldnotes of the Natuurkundige Commissie - Mahya Ameryan, Lambert Schomaker | Paper 9: Supporting Complexity and Conjectures in Cultural Heritage Descriptions - Gioele Barabucci, Francesca Tomasi, Fabio Vitali"
