        "text": "2019-Impressions of Books/Reading\n\nJanuary\n\nBatbyal, Rakesh, JNU: The Making of a University, Delhi, HarperCollins, 2014, Kindle edition\n\nThe year started with reading books on Kindle. And the very first book on kindle was JNU-The Making of a University. On Kindle many books don’t have page marks, so this book also does not have page marks, but it is a big book of perhaps 588 pages. Kindle has locations with 11625 locations. Author Rakesh Batbyal is JNU student and now in faculty. Apart from 14 chapters, the book has Notes, Select Bibliography, Acknowledgements at the end of the book. The book is dedicated to Prof. Bipan Chandra.\n\nIn the first chapter-A University is Conceived-Rakesh goes back to year 1965, during Shastri regime, when M C Chagla was Education minister, perhaps continuation from Nehru’s time and he was the one, who initiated the proposal of JNU. Nehru himself in his lifetime did not create or wished a University to be named after him. But Chagla, being a highly intellectualized person and an ardent admirer of Nehru saw to it that JNU is set up. In his autobiography-Roses in December, he has narrated few episodes of setting up JNU. But author has consulted massive material, such as Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha debates, JNU Admission policy papers of 1972-1983, JNU Annual report, Private papers of HN Kunjru, CR Reddy, Chagla, Haksar, VKRV Rao and Bhakat Darshan, apart from journals. The debates of Parliament were very lively.\n\nIn 2nd chapter he narrates the legislative history of JNU Act as passed in Parliament after long debates, which has gone through many expert committees as well. It was thought first to make it affiliating University, he idea was dropped and focus was on making it a advanced research University.\n\nThird chapter moves to show its uniqueness in The Nationalist Roots of a Modern University. The University got its first VC in G.Parthasarthy, who came from foreign service but with all the credentials of a fine academician. Initial recruitment of faculty was made by invitation and many who cam by invitation, turned out to be intellectual giants later. Fourth chapter is focused on=Radical Decade: The sixties-French student revolt of 1968 shook the world and had impact all over. Fifth chapter is-Born amidst the rocks-the choice of its location, which contributed to its uniqueness. Next few chapters focus upon coming up of different schools of study, the first one was School of International Studies, which actually already existed for training foreign service officers. Sapru house was its library and Gomti guest house was its guest house, which got merged in JNU at inception. Russian institute was another pre-existing institute which was merged in School of Foreign languages and then turned into School of Languages. JNU on its own set up School of Social Sciences with CHS and CESP-Economics and History as major centers. Krishna Bhardwaj and Amit Bhaduri started Centre for Economic studies and planning and Romila Thapar and S.Gopal were invited to set up History center. School of Environment studies and School of Computer sciences were set up science stream, further strengthened with School of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences.\n\nCampus life was built around Faculty houses and hostels built in close proximity. All sections of University had their associations-student, staff and faculty. In the beginning faculty and staff had one association, later teachers association became separate. Author is critical of Naxalites, even of SFI, but soft on AISF. Irritating aspect of the book is that it is too lengthy, it remains neither research work nor popular reading. He has put all the raw material in the book without trying to make it interesting text to read.\n\nBut it was good to start the year with kindle reading and that too with first book on JNU, which despite its uninteresting style is quite informative, though some information is given selectively. Eminent journalist Mohan Ram’s name is not mentioned, who was first selected student to be chucked out in emergency, who never returned to JNU again.\n\nJain, Chandra Ghosh Sri Ram comes to JNU (Novelette) Kindle edition\n\n2014, Bunya Grove Press\n\nThe book is dedicated to Divik and Dinaer and is of about 80 pages\n\nWriter says that she loves for the love of writing and writing makes her feel free. Shubhdarshinin Singh has written brief comment on it. Author has another book to her credit In Search of Sita. It is a novel from ex JNUite. Sri Ram is almost a real character entering JNU, who is married but finds JNU setting him free. He is close to SFI, but exposes all the chinks of political groups. It is narration of JNU students life in hostels and outside.\n\nPritam Amrita, Pinjar (Punjabi novel), Delhi, Sri Prakashan, 2013, pages 87\n\nPinjar (Punjabi: ਪਿੰਜਰ,پنجر , Urdu: پنجر‎, Hindi: पिंजर, English/Translation: The Skeleton) is a 1950 Punjabi novel written by noted poet and novelist Amrita Pritam.[1] It is the story of a Hindu girl, Puro, abducted by a Muslim man, Rashid[2] whose parents refuse to recover the defiled girl when she manages a run to her parents from Rashid’s home. Pinjar is believed to be one of the best literatures written with backdrop of Partition of India.\n\nAmrita Pritam wrote a short novel or novelette-Pinjar, which was translated in English by Khushwant Singh as The Skelton and few years ago, a French teacher Denis Matringe translated it in French. It was translated in many other languages as well. Chander Prakash Dwivdey scripted it for a Hindi film of same title Pinjar in 2003, which earned him a national award. Pinjar is story of women sufferings during partition. Amrita Pritam herself a sufferer of partition has heard stories of partition women being retrieved in both countries by team of Mridula Sarabhai from India and Begum Liaqat Ali Khan from Pakistan. These were the women abducted, raped, many killed on both sides. The lead character is Puro, daughter of a rich man Mohan Lal of Chhatowani village whose marriage is fixed with Ramchand son of another rich man Shyam Lal of nearby village Ratowal. Since there used to be exchange marriages in some families, Ramchand’s sister Lajo was to be married to Trilok, Puro’s brother. Puro has once seen Ramchand and she has developed deep emotions for the man, with whom she was to be married. In a tragic twist, Puro is kidnapped by Rashid of the same village, Rashid had seen Puro and is enamored of her, but the reason for kidnapping is family revenge of feudal society. Puro’s grandfather had once kidnapped grandaunt of Rashid in long continuous enmity and defiled her for three day, before returning her to the family. Rashid’s uncle had coaxed Rashid to take revenge in same manner. When village Shah did this, they were dominating the village and now Sheikhs are dominating and they call Shah to convey that they had taken revenge. Rashid is not bad man at heart and he cares for Puro, he does not defile her and performs Nikah with her, though not with Puro’s willingness. Puro tries her luck before Nikah to reach her parents and beg mercy, parents of Puro refuse to accept her by saying that now that was her fate and they had to save the whole family by not offending Sheikhs. Shell shocked Puro accepts her fate with Rashid, becoming Hamida. Ramchand was married to Puro’s younger sister Rajjo and Trilok to Ramchand sister Lajo. Puro’s parents leave the village.\n\nTale takes another tragic twist as partition occurs and Hindus are being escorted out of village by Punjab boundary force, yet some girls are kidnapped including Lajo. Puro with her deep suffering and anguish becomes more sensitive to others sufferings, she treats Kammo, Tara and Pagli with compassion, offending the society around. Someone has impregnated Pagli and she dies after giving birth to a child. Puro and Rashid take that child and nurture him, after Puro had her own born child Javed, who got attached to new born of Pagli. Hindus of the village declare that Pagli was a ‘Hindu’, though no one knows who she was. They take away child from Puro only to return after 2-3 days as the child was at the verge of dyeing without Puro. Puro has chance to visit the village of her would be husband Ramchand to help, Rashid’s aunty for some treatment, where she sees Ramchand again. And as the Hindus in caravan are being escorted out to border, the caravan of Hindus stays in Puro’s village during night. A victim Hindu girl comes to Puro from the caravan, as Puro goes to leave her in the caravan under the excuse of selling some things to caravan, she finds Ramchand in the caravan, who tells her that his sister and Puro’s Bhabhi has been kidnapped and begs for her help to find her. Puro takes on herself to locate and send her back to India. She has suspicion that Lajo is in her own house which has been now occupied by some Muslim, who also had kidnapped Lajo. With help of Rashid, she gets Lajo escape and then hands her over to her brother and husband, who was her brother. Despite the fact that her brother Trilok had burnt Rashid’s crops in anger. Rashid vindicates his humanity by helping Puro in all her compassionate actions. In fact, he had won her over as when he fell seriously ill, Puro served him so much day and night that they became really close to each other. Puro’s brother tells Puro also to come along to India, but she declines as her husband Rashid and child Javed are in Pakistan and she accepts her fate now willingly! Puro tell her brother to treat Lajo well and never harass her, she tells-\n\nAny girl whether Hindu or Muslim is welcomed back in\n\nher home, take it that Pooro’s soul too has reached back to\n\nits home.”\n\nDayal Gulshan, Vishav Parikrama (Memoirs), Barnala, Tarak Bharti, 2019, page 232\n\nThis is first prose book of Gulshan Dayal, teaching in a school in USA, she has published two books of poetry earlier. Prose is in form of memoirs of travelling in world. She has dedicated the book to her sister and Dr. Mohan Tyagi of Punjabi University Patiala has penned introduction for the work. There are 53 sketches in the book. She has written on wide variety of subjects, but with a realist and rational outlook. From her own teaching experiences, she has emphasized the role of mother tongue in learning and she has underlined that mother tongue is the best medium of education, at least at primary level. She has some personal memoirs of being given good education and freedom by her parents. She has also spoken about pettiness in human conduct. She appreciates Punjabi poet Pash, known through her father late Sohan Singh Sandhu, who was her neighbor in Freemont and she spent lot of time with him in last stage of his life. She admires his zeal despite his physical debilities and age. She has traveled to Pakistan and has underlined the cultural affinity between two Punjab’s divided politically. Gulshan writes effortlessly and has developed a spontaneous style of writing, which is refreshing in cliché ridden writing of the day.\n\nCould read above four books in first month, may be 4th spilled in February.\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nCould read only one book in this month, as remained busy in my manuscripts final editing.\n\nSaraogi, Alka, Eik Sachhi Jhuthi Gatha(Hindi novel), 2018, Delhi, Rajkamal paperbacks, pages 155\n\nAlka Saraogi has come out with her new novel Eik Sachhi Jhuthi Gatha after a gap of few years. This novel brings the new world of social media into centre focus and how social life has undergone change with its impact. She has created a character, whom she never meets, yet he creates impact on her life through social media-emails, facebook that she goes to meet him all the way to a different city and returns empty handed, as the man whose name is told as Pramit does not turn up at airport, but keeps on communicating through emails at even airport. Pramit is son of a German mother and Indian father and has been left with much property, yet he is part of such political activities, which establishment may term as subversive or terrorist. The writer tries to understand the character, who is extremely intelligent, emotional in his own way, announces his marriage, which again turns out to be non-event.\n\nAlka Saraogi has an attractive style of writing. There is touch of history, philosophy and intellectualism, yet it does not become a heavy reading and it remains in the realm of narration, which is understood by her readers easily, yet her readers must have some social awareness, it is not pure entertainment as an interesting story. Her invisible character Pramit is visible in imagination of the narrator and is successfully imprinted on reader’s mind also. That is the success of her story telling of the unusual!\n\n6. Manan, Surendera, Ahmad Al Halo, Kahan Ho?, Travelogue(Hindi), 2019, Hapur ,Sambhavna Prakashan, pages 280\n\nSurender Manan remained out of sight for many years and has now come out with his interesting travelogue. He was known for his literary journal Behas at one time and wrote a novel Sidhi as well. From his travelogue it appears that he discovered himself in documentary film making and most of his travelogue presented here for this purpose only. The narration begins from Philistine refuges anguished living, about which whole world seems to be unaware and even insensitive. Ahmad Al Halo is Philistine refugee, whom Manan meets in Delhi and through him sees the untold sufferings of these people and he gets the news of Ahmad’s death after a gap of three months, who was desperate to go back to Iraq, his place of birth. Writer in his new Avtar of film maker has traveled to South Africa, Cambodia, Vienna, Budapest, UK, Malaysia and Mauritius. Some of these countries I have also visited and could identify with some persons. His travelogue to Mauritius was more impressive, though this is the last chapter of this book. In South Africa, he finds in post-colonial times Africans hating Indians, who in their perception are squeezing their blood after British left, though British and other whites are still holding control over their economy. In Cambodia, he has accepted cliché created by US that Pol Pot killed two to three million people, whereas at one point, he refers to killings between 70 to 75, which was worst US attack on all three Indo-Chinese nations of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\nSince myself being fond of traveling, I liked the book. In Vienna, UK and Budapest he was looking for Indians, who were illegally travelling to these places to look for better fortunes and in the process, many dyeing and working in inhuman conditions.\n\nOn the whole, it is good realist study of unchartered paths of many Indians, who are going to west by any means, without bothering that where they will be reaching.\n\nKhaira, Darshan, Punjab Students Union da itihas, Ludhiana, Chintan Prakashan, 2018 ed., pages 224, Price 150/ rupees\n\nDarshan Baghi was a well known name in Punjab student politics in early seventies. Pirthipal Singh Randhawa, who became most popular student leader after Baghi took over leadership of Punjab Students Union(PSU), after it was given sound foundations by Darshan Baghi. Ironically same Darshan Baghi frustrated after once downfall of PSU, migrated to Canada and went out of public view for very long. And he has now revealed himself through this book-History of PSU after almost four decades. Now he has named himself as writer of the books as-Darshan Singh Khehra, though while describing the history of PSU, he has kept the name Darshan Baghi intact. Baghi went to Canada and joined service there and retired many years ago. I had a chance to meet him in 2011, he spent time with me. This history of PSU has many unknown facts to be known through this book. PSU was set up with both CPI and CPM, patronization, but it grew out its own path and turned to be a radical ML oriented mass organization. Baghi was not there to see this transition, but he has supported this transisition.\n\nHow Pirthipal Randhawa rebuild this organization and how it caught the imagination of Punjab youth, has not been described in detail, as Baghi was no more at the helm of its affairs. Many activists of old PSU have found many faults in the book, yet they had to acknowledge that this is first attempt to write the history of glorious struggles PSU launched and made impact on Punjabi youth. The advent of Khalistani movement did a great damage to PSU, yet it still continues to exist in many groups though now it is pale shadow of its form in 70’s. The murder of its most popular leader Pirthipal Randhawa did a massive blow to the organization. How Ram Manohar Lohia and Hindi scholar Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwiedey supported the organization in its formative phase is fascinating part of this narration. This is a valuable document of contemporary history of radical student movements fought in Punjab.\n\nMarch-2019\n\nMehta, Nand Singh, Rohli Garj(Punjabi Novel), 2015, Chandigarh, Lokgeet Prakashan, pages472, price 595? Rupees\n\nIn one way these two books-Khaira and Nand Singh’s novel depicts the history of Punjab Students Union, Nand Singh Sidhu writing his novel earlier in 2015, picks up history of PSU, from where Baghi has concluded, but he narrates much more-he also narrates the history or story of Sohi group of Naxals in Punjab, of which he himself was once part and still carries empathy with that. Darshan Singh Baghi founded PSU, to which narrator Sidhu also refers in the background, but he picks up further and narrates the golden period of PSU under the leadership of Pirthipal Singh Randhawa, by far the most popular student leader of Punjab in seventies. Problem with Sidhu is that he tries to depict history through story, but he narrates the story in so much detail that it loses its fictional character and becomes just the unnecessary detailed account of the movement. In his earlier novel and in this also, the lengthy details of political programmes, strategies and tactics make the reader of fiction bored and the writer loses his control over words. He should have written proper account of the movement he belonged, it was much desirable, but by trying to fictionalize, though informed readers identify the real characters behind fictional mask. So if proper account of movement of seventies had been penned, it would have served better as the earlier revolutionary movements loose the heroic and brave tales of activists of the movement. Character of Pirthipal Randhawa in its fictional form Gurbux has been well depicted, but real account would had been more touching.\n\nIn any case, Nand Singh Sidhu, though through week fictional form, has tried to preserve the account of popular student movement. Moga cinema movement has also been depicted well. Darshan Singh Khaira urf Baghi has used better form of memoirs to narrate student movement in its early part. Both these books recreate the romantic and brave mass student movement of seventies.\n\nApril-May\n\nChandan, Amarjit(ed.), San Santali-Panjab de ujade di shayri, 2018, Delhi, Navyug Prakashan, pages 200, Price 350/rupees\n\nAmarjit Chandan now living for decades in London, has edited a much-desired anthology of Punjabi poetry related to partition of India and much tragic of Punjab. He has dedicated the anthology to those victims of genocide, who were trying to save humanity from falling into such abyss of dehumanization. Book is dedicated to Gahil Singh of Chhajalwandi, Megh Singh and Suba Singh of Kot Dharam Chand, Lyallpur’s Sai Umardin-they were all communists. Book if also in memory of Suleman Aayish and Laddu Shah of Zira and Jagdeo Kalan, who got killed at the hands of Sikh rioters. Poet wishes that both Punjabs should be united again and that is the spirit behind this anthology. In his twenty page introduction, he has put this poetry in perspective of partition tragedy. He has included 53 poets of Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu and English in this collection. Beginning from Babu Rajab Ali, who was born in 1894 and is the oldest poet in terms of time, he has included Shaanvir Singh Rehal born in 1988, who incidentally is and English poet from London. Poets include from iconic poets like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Amrita Pritam to completely unknown poets, large no. of poets are quite well known as Ferozedin Sharaf, Ahmad Rahi, Harinder Singh Rup, the editor himself, Kumar Vikal Ageyeya, , Munir Niazi, Ahmad Salim, Sahir Ludhianvi, Harbhajan Singh etc.\n\nMany poems like Amrita’s Ajj Akhan Waris Shah nun are part of anthology. Poets like Ahmad Rahi have written many touching poems, not much known to Punjabi readers. Poet-editor has acknowledged the help rendered by scores of people in collecting the poems.\n\nThis is worthwhile collection, which should have come much earlier.\n\nJune 2019\n\nAbdul Ghaffar Khan, Mera Jivan Mera Sanghrash(Autobiography), translated in Hindi by Akhlaq Ahan, 2013, Nayi Kitab, Delhi, pages 551, price 895/350 rupees\n\nThis autobiography of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan covers period up to 1947 partition of India. He lived for many decades more and perhaps sequel to this autobiography exists. Translator and JNU Persian Professor Akhlaq Ahan, who wrote 21-page introduction, has mentioned that it has been translated from Pashto with title of Jamazband aur jaddojehad. Romila Thapar has written a para on flap of the book, though Hindi translation of the autobiography is not very smooth. She has mentioned that Khan Abdul Ghaffar was friend of his father and she has met Khan in Peshawar. Incidentally it seems that for almost two months in between, I have not been able to read any book and remained busy mostly in paying attention to my collection The Bhagat Singh Reader, though in between I got many new books of my interest and may find time to read those books and write on few.\n\nThis book is dedicated to Akhlaq friend and patron Akhilesh Mittal, a great Urdu lover.\n\nAutobiography begins with details of birth and family. Badshah Khan was born in Uttamjai village in 1890, there is no mention of date. His elder brother Dr. Khan was born 11 year earlier. Khans belonged to Muhammadjai tribe of Pathans. Mother side was from Yusafjai tribe. This area Ashtangar was once a Buddhist centre also. Father Behram Khan was head of the village. Khan Saheb refers to the glory of Sher Shah Suri and the Loya Jirga (sort of Panchayat) held in Kandhar in those days. There was no system of education prior to the arrival of British, they opened first schools in the area. Khan Abdul was the youngest of all siblings, so was most loved boy in the family. Ghaffar Khan moves to school times in next chapter. His father despite being of religious orientation, was open minded and sent the children to schools. He refers to Peshawar school, where teachers were from Punjab, but taught through Pashto medium. As his elder brother Dr. Khan was in 11th class, Ghaffar Khan was following him in sixth class, both joined mission school. He refers to the local games’ children played, also refers to local festivals. After Dr. Khan left for his medical education to Bombay, younger Khan remained in boarding school with Mohabbat Khan. In between Khan got a job and left studies before completing Matriculation, later he joined for studies at Aligarh.\n\nNext, he moves t the new fields in life-meeting religious intellectuals, having related to Deoband seminary. Khan’s first marriage was arranged by his father in 1912 at the age of 22 years. Khan modernized family life and had his food with wife, which was strange for her in those days. First exposure of Ghaffar Khan to politics was to attend Muslim League conference in Agra in 1913. He also started spreading education in his area, he saw the first world war and British conspiracies in his area, as he was becoming popular.\n\nGhaffar Khan describes the impact of Rowlett act in Pashtun area and their participation in anti-bill agitation in peaceful manner. It was his process of getting politicized. DUE To WORLD WAR, there was epidemic in many countries, in which Khan lost his first wife. She left three children with Khan, who himself and his son Wali Khan remained ill for many years due to the impact of this epidemic. Due to Martial law during Rowlett act agitation, Khan was arrested and so many others too. He describes the jail conditions which were very harsh in those days, despite being political prisoner status to them. On release from prison, Khan returned to village and family fixed his second marriage in the family of his first wife. During the period, he was again arrested and was married only after release.\n\nThese were days of anti Khilafat agitation and Khan attended Delhi conference in this regard and presided over a conference in his area. Khan travelled to Kabul also in this period. In 1921, they set up Azad school in Utmanzu. In December 1921, he was arrested under act 40. He was kept in Peshawar and Dera Ismail khan and Dera Ghazi Khan and Lahore jails. In Jail, Khan Sahib was given labour of making envelops or spinning. How differences and irritations develop in Jail life among one’s own comrades is also aptly described by Ghaffar Khan. In jail, Khan suffered dental problems and was not properly attended to. Ghaffar Khan mother died during his imprisonment and he was not allowed to attend her funeral. He was released after three years.\n\nAfter release, Khan Sahib became politically active again, he was decorated with Fakhre-Afghan title, brought out Pashtun newspaper in Pashto language. In 1926, he went for Haj. He has referred to internal conflicts in Afghanistan ruling forces. Few were British supporters; many were against it.\n\nIn 1929, Congress party had its conference in Lahore, and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan had built an organization called Khudai Khidmatgar, whose peaceful volunteers wore Red shirts, they were called Lal Kurti wale as well. In 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested again and taken to Gujrat jail. They entered in agreement with Congress party. There was heavy repression on Pathans in Pashtun area and Vithalbhai Patel went for fact finding, which was proscribed by British Govt.\n\nKhan Abdul Ghaffar Khan was going by train with his Khudai Khidmatgars to attend 1931 Karachi Congress, the compartment in which they were travelling, Bhagat Singh’s father Kishan Singh and Kumari Lajjawati, Principal of KMV Jalandhar. Since Khudai Volunteers were celebrating with dhol-bajas, they thought due to Bhagat Singh execution just two days ago, they should stop it, but Kishan Singh said that ‘his son has been martyred for the nation and country, he is alive and it should be celebrated. Lajjawati(Names not mentioned) was also a brave nationalist and sung national songs and made Khudai volunteers to write many nationalist songs and sung with them. Khan further mentions that Naujwan Bharat Sabha at Karachi had shown black flags to Gandhi and spoke very harsh things to him. After Karachi Congress, Khan Sahib took the round of Indian cities and returned to Pashtun area after few months. He refers to Pathans in Punjab area. There is description of mass movement of Khudai Khidmatgars. Ghaffar Khan made trip to Bardoli in Gujarat at Gandhi ji’s invitation. Devdas Gandhi, (mentioned as Devi Das) son of Mahatma Gandhi accompanied Khan Sahib in this trip.\n\nFrontier province govt. was committing extreme atrocities on Pathans and indulging in state violence on them. A child was sent to Gandhi by Dr. Khan Sahib, his narration made Gandhi say that he wishes to visit Frontier province, British viceroy refused permission, then Gandhi ji sent his son Devdas Gandhi to visit frontier.\n\nGandhi ji invited Khan Sahib to Shimla for round table conference. Khan had travelled many Deras and other frontier areas, his red kurti movement has spread wide and far. There was Loya Jirga of the frontier. Gandhi had invited him, but in the meantime, Khan was arrested again, this time, thousands of Khudai Khidmat gars were arrested. He was kept in Hazaribagh jail in Bihar, where a woman’s bravery has been narrated, whose lawyer husband was left with five children to take care of. They were released after three years in 1934 from jail, then Congress session was in Bombay, where it was decided to elect Khan sahib as President, Dr. Rajinder Prasad resigning to make way for him, but Khan Sahib declined. He was arrested in Bombay and kept in jail and transferred to Sabarmati jail in Ahmedabad after few days. Then shifted to small jail in Braille, where he was kept in isolation, then in Almora jail. In Khan absence, in frontier elections, Khudai Khidmatgars got elected in 19 seats out of 40. Reference is made of Faizpur Congress. Khan made trip to Baluchistan, where number of Pathans lived. There was Khudai Khidmatgar ministry in frontier with Dr. Khan Sahib as head. Pandit Nehru was invited to visit Frontier, British officers tried to sabotage the visit and during his visit, lot many attacks were made on hi entourage. Gandhi ji also visited in 1938. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad also visited, but frontier ministry could not repeal the most oppressive law which was always opposed by Khudai’s. And corruption also entered in govt. structure.\n\nGhaffar Khan has narrated Quit India movement, he was arrested again. Due to his health problems, he was taken to Abbottabad hospital from Haripur jail. Last part of this autobiography is focused on 1946, Cripps mission, Shimla conference, Direct action and Congress betrayal of Pathans. 1942 was the last election of unified India. In the election to Constituent assembly, frontier chose Khan Saheb, Abul Kalam Azad and one more. Muslim League did not participate in Constituent assembly, Muslim League did not consider anyone Muslim, if he was not in the League. In elections to 11 provinces, Congress had majority in 8, Muslim League had none, other Muslim majority provinces elected regional parties like in Sindh and Punjab, where Ali Bux Sumrro made govt and in Punjab, Unionist party had majority, which was a party of all three communities-Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs. In Bengal, Fazalul Haq ministry was there. There was just one Muslim League member in 155 members of all three assemblies.\n\nShimla conference was held on 4th May 1946. Congress party was represented by Nehru, Patel, Azad and Khan Sahib. Muslim League was represented by Jinnah, Liaqat, Raja Mehmudabad and Abdul Rab. British representatives were-Viceroy Wavell, Cripps, Lord Patrice and Mr. Alexander. Conference failed, in Britain Churchill lost elections and Labour party won. Cabinet mission with Cripps proposed that only three departments will remain with cetre and India will have three units-A, B and C. A will be Hindu majority; B will have Muslim majority provinces with provision of change in provinces inclusion in these three zones. Congress and Muslim League both agreed to this proposal. Maulana Azad was changed in this period as Congress President, making way for Nehru, though there was pressure to make Patel the President.\n\nNehru in a statement on 10th January 1946 at Bombay made the whole atmosphere unpleasant, to the reaction of which Jinnah withdrew his consent from Muslim League for the proposal. There was interim govt formed in December 1946 under Nehru, which after wrangling and out of Muslim League ministers-Liaqat Ali Khan was made finance minister, who became later first Prime Minister of Pakistan, but assassinated. When Nehru visited frontier, governor Karroo tried to sabotage his visit by arranging tribal attacks, but failed. ,\n\nAs per Ghaffar Khan, Mountbatten joined as last Viceroy of India had forced partition by conspiring to make Congress and Muslim League fight each other. Patel acted as their partner, but Nehru was opposed, but he was also won over by Mountbatten and lastly Gandhi agreed to Nehru-Patel arguments.\n\nDirect action by Muslim League in Bengal aggravated situation. Calcutta faced massacres of Hindus at Muslim hands, but Hindus took revenge in Bihar. Hindus were organized and they killed more people in Bihar than Muslims had killed in Bengal according to Ghaffar Khan. Khan went to Bihar, Mridula Ben also cooperated with Gandhi, who was trying to control mobs from committing communal crimes. When Mountbatten declared partition and plebiscite to decide in provinces or assemblies, it affected frontier province and Muslim League started riots as Ghaffar Khan avers. Mountbatten made deal with Congress to partition Bengal and Punjab, but told them to leave Frontier province and in this deal, Congress betrayed frontier people, which had Congress-Khudai ministry and had not allowed Muslim League to grow there. Ghaffar Khan tried his best, holding meeting with Gandhi, Jinnah and Mountbatten to avoid partition. Jinnah told that Pakistan will give provincial autonomy to frontier, which was never given.\n\nKhan Abdul Ghaffar Khan blames Mountbatten-Congress unholy deal and betrayal of its secular friends and partners. He quotes from Maulana Azad book India wins freedom also to prove his point that they were betrayed. Khan does not object to Patel-Rajagopalachari, but objects to Gandhi-Nehru, who agreed with them.\n\nGhaffar Khan concludes that Khudai Khidmatgars had created such love and harmony among Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs of frontier, that those Hindu-Sikhs, who returned to India after partition, they still called them as Khudai Khidmatgars. Khan Sahib concludes that Mountbatten and Patel conspiracy destroyed every harmony and destroyed Khudai Khidmatgars.\n\nKhan Abdul Ghaffar Khan autobiography is very important document of Indian freedom struggle and falls in category of plain speak like Maulana Azad that how the secular Muslims, who trusted Congress party and Gandhi-Nehru were betrayed by them. Hindi translation of the autobiography is rather flawed, though praised by Romila Thapar.\n\nXxxxxxxxx\n\nShiv Kumar Gupta(edited), Jallianwala Bagh and The Raj, 2019, Chandigarh, Mohindra Publishing house Chandigarh, Pages 252, price 450/ rupees\n\nDuring centenary of Jallianwala Bagh massacres lot many new publications have been brought out, one of these is Punjabi University Patiala retired Professor Shiv Gupta edited-Jallianwala Bagh and The Raj. Published from local publisher at Chandigarh, the book has two parts- Part one has 13 essays, mostly from non-Indian writers, but two of editor’s own. And in second part there are seven statements of evidence by eminent people involved in this whole tragic saga. A brief Foreword to the book is by Tarlochan Singh, former MP and now trustee of Jallianwala Bagh trust, Preface and introduction is of editor himself. There are two-page endnotes in 252 pages book, dedicated to editor’s mentor Late Dr. Pardamman Singh, a historian.\n\nIntroduction and two essays by editor himself are almost repetition, but contribution of 11 non-Indian writers is valuable historic record. Out o these elevan contributions, British journalist Valentine Chirol’s The Deliberate Bloodshed, B G Horniman’s Dyerarchy is Amritsar and New Revelations about Amritsar massacres by Russian writers-Mitrokhin and Raikov are important. BG Horniman, a British was editor of Bombay Chronicle, who was forcibly sent back to England, because of his writings.\n\nIn the Part-II, statements of Dr. Kitchlew, Dr. Satya Pal, Lala Harkishan Lal, Duni Chand and Pandit Rambhaj Dutt like eminent freedom fighters shed eye witness account of the massacres. All these historic documents put together make the book valuable addition to the already published books on Jalliawala Bagh.\n\nH\n\nJuly 2019\n\nHamit Bozarslan/Gilles Batallion/Christophe Jeffrelot, Revolutionary Passions: Latin America, Middle East and India, translated from French Soma Datta Gupta, 2017, New Delhi, Social Science Press, pages 202, price 625/ Rupees\n\nThis is an interesting study by French scholars focusing on Indian revolutionary hero Bhagat Singh, along with Cuban and Iranian revolutions. Introduction and Post script reflections are by Hami Bozarslan. He begins by reference to Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali speaking on 13th January 2014 of not contesting next election and then fleeing very next day from the country.\n\nIn chapter one Hamit refers to theory of French revolution historiographer Francois Furet (1927-97) expressed in his classic book The Past of an Illusion. Furet, like Hobsbawm is the greatest historian of contemporary times. Furet refers to three model revolutions-French (1789), Russian (1917) and Iranian(1979). Egalitarianism and creation of new man have been the ideals of revolution, but past revolution leads to totalitarian system. This is analysis of most of academicians. These revolutions were based on hatred of the bourgeoise.\n\nChapter 2 if focused on two revolutions of Cuba-1959 and Nicaragua-1979, written by Gilles Batallion, who qualifies in the title itself-From the war against tyranny to totalitarian dictatorship. He describes the revolutionary leaders as Castroism and Sandinism as egocrats. Bureaucratization is the end of these revolutions as per the writer.\n\nChapter 3 is written again by Hamit Bozarslan and is titled as The Ups and Downs of Revolutionary Passions of the Middle East. He focusses on Islamic Iranian revolution led by Shia cleric Ayatollah Khomeini. Reference is made to once socialist and communist movements in Egypt, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, also Yemen. Tudeh was Iranian Communist party, once strong. Bath party was socialist orientation in Iraq and Syria.\n\nChapter 4 is written by Christophe Jeffrelot on The Making of Indian Revolutionaries-1885-1931. He describes 1885-1914 period as Terro-Hinduism, as Indian version of Anarchism, which had Maharashtra and Bengal in centre. Tilak and Savarkar shaped anarchism into form of Hinduization. Savarkar and Lajpat Rai wrote own biographies of Mazzini. Thomas Frot’s The Secret societies of European Revolution-1776-1876, were known to these Hindu anarchists. Sister Nivedita had met Prince Kropotkin.\n\n1914-31 period is described as Republicans and Socialists coming to age in Indian revolution. Ghadar party to HRA of Bhagat Singh is part of this period. Bhagat Singh reshaped his world view with readings of rare variety. Bhagat Singh, with great candour presents himself as an example, his sacrifice serving above all, a model to emulate. Good analysis of Bhagat Singh phenomenon, I was quoted through Ashok Dhawle by the critic.\n\nChapter 5 is What is Revolution All About: Post script: Reflections by Hamit, who is the main contributor with three essays out of five. Hamit thinks all revolutions degenerate into totalitarian regimes.\n\nIt I an interesting study, though done from anti revolutionary perception.\n\nChris Moffat has been a British researcher doing research on Bhagat Singh since years and spent quite a lot of time in Delhi and Punjab on both sides of the Indo-Pak border. This book is result of his rigorously academic, scholarly and yet social change-oriented research.\n\n‘Afterlives’ of the dead heroes or icons is the serious research project in western academics and Bhagat Singh is one of the favorite icons for studying afterlife of the martyrs. Earlier Dr. Kama Maclean, an Australian scholar did her research, though from a bit different angle and now Chris Moffat has come up with his research on afterlife of Bhagat Singh. For Chris the anti-colonial struggles in South Asia is the focus and how its continuation in postcolonial polity is the main question. In this context he traces the revenant presence of Bhagat Singh in Indian society today facing current problems. He demonstrates through empirical study and analysis the living Indian communities are still animated by a sense of obligation, duty and debt to the dead. Bhagat Singh himself in his simple political vocabulary has told in his last days to his comrades and friends that ‘a dead Bhagat Singh will be more dangerous to colonial regime than living Bhagat Singh!’ To large extent Bhagat Singh is proving to be truer in post-colonial desi rulers ruled Indian society than he proved for British regime before 1947.\n\n11\n\nChris Moffat research is organized into book form in two parts. In first part of his work, he focuses upon the life time of Bhagat Singh and his active participation in national freedom struggle, chalking out his own path different than dominant Congress party path. While in second part, Chris moves on to the impact of Bhagat Singh’s iconic presence in post-colonial society up to the contemporary times. He has supplemented his scholarly research with substantial support from figures/photographs, which are 26 in total. The political spectrum is as wide as one can imagine-from pre colonial times Congress party/Gandhi/Nehru/Subhas stream to RSS and in post-colonial time from Aam Aadmi Party(AAP to maximum no. of leftist organizations-parties to their mass organizations and rightwing organizations from ABVP to Khalistanis. Chris Moffat analyses Bhagat Singh phenomenon objectively and rationally.\n\nPrior to writing his introduction to the book, Chris has reproduced a photograph of Ram Rehman, titled as Abbas Studio, clicked by great photographer in 2002, the picture shows two painters painting Bhagat Singh portrait on a screen with brush on eyebrows, the eyes of portrait are so evocative that one wonders about the fascination for Bhagat Singh hat wearing face for painters and photographers, which has been painted and clicked hundreds of times. Christopher Pinney has reproduced many such photographs of Bhagat Singh in his study of the icon through photographs. Chris starts with a popular joke about Bhagat Singh, which is as much quoted in context of another female literary icon Heer, that ‘Every Indian wants Bhagat Singh to be reborn, but in neighbor’s house’! Chris refers to failure of Mahatma Gandhi’s first non-cooperation movement in 1922, which led to the militant nationalism of revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad as both were ardent followers of Gandhi and Azad even suffered 30 lashes on his back with shouting at every lash-Mahatma Gandhi ki Jai. While discussing the theme of afterlives of militant anti-colonial icons like James Connolly, Stephan Biko, the young historian finds that ‘official’ historians and state authorities labor to absorb these radical pasts into a consensus national pantheon’(Page 2). In this context he refers to ‘The fact that Bhagat Singh is frequently invoked across contradictory ideological projects in contemporary South Asia-from the Hindu Right to the Maoist left, Sikh separatists in Punjab to secular rationalists in Tamilnadu, the army in India to pacifists in Pakistan-lends this call to reconstruct the ‘real’ figure an additional sense of urgency, especially those eager to position themselves as ‘true’ inheritors of the revolutionary’s legacy(Page3).’ Here researcher quotes Mahatma Gandhi -‘there has never been within the living memory so much romance round any life as had surrounded that of Bhagat Singh.’ (same page)\n\nChris Moffat describes Bhagat Singh as ‘a problem in the history of Indian Nationalism’ and in last decade there has been surge in new academic studies on Bhagat Singh. (Page 8) He quotes the anthropologist and art historian Christopher Pinney, who says that Bhagat Singh’s huge popularity’ remains ‘one of the puzzles of twentieth century Indian history that academics don’t seem to have engaged with’. Perhaps due to lack of interest of Indian academics in Bhagat Singh led to the interest of academics in other countries to focus on the ‘fascination’ and ‘puzzle’ of Indian icon of Indian freedom struggle, which led Chris Moffat like young historian to research on Bhagat Singh. It is interesting to underline that western and Indian academics almost simultaneously took to study Bhagat Singh. Historians and political scientists like S Irfan Habib, Simona Sawhney and US based Neeti Nair took interest in studying Bhagat Singh phenomenon as Kama Maclean, Chris Moffat, Christopher Pineey and Chritophe Jeffrelot took interest abroad. But much earlier Soviet historians like Mitrokhin had focused on Bhagat Singh.\n\nChris Moffat in his effort to analyze Bhagat Singh phenomenon in life and afterlife has drawn perceptions of Ranciere , Alan Badiou and more theoreticians in in integrated form, while developing his own methodology for research.\n\nTo describe the life time of Bhagat Singh, Chris begins with first chapter-Lahore and the possibility of Politics, referring to popular anecdotes like happenings in Bhagat Singh’s life, such as ‘sowing the guns’ to reap the fulsome crop of guns to drive British away. Bhagat Singh’s visit to Jallianwala Bagh massacre site very next day at the age of 12 years is also quoted from Hansraj Rehbar from his English version of his Hindi biography of Bhagat Singh. Chris perhaps due to his lesser knowledge of Hindi has not referred to Bhagat Singh’s most authentic biography by her niece Veerender Sindu. In this chapter the socio-cultural-politico culture of Lahore is described in detail from various sources. Old Mochi Gate of Lahore has been described as Hyde Park of London by Pran Nevile in his book-Lahore: A sentimental journey quoted by Chris. Charles Bradlaugh, a British atheist MP’s impact on Lahore was reflected in 1900 founding stone laid by Surendernath Bannerjee of Punjab Congress headquarter named as Bradlaugh hall. The founding stone still survives in Lahore, after 72 years of formation of Pakistan. Bhagat Singh’s childhood, student days and early political orientation through National college, part of Bradlaugh hall has been described in this chapter and reference is also made to ‘Tilak school of Politics’ prevalent in National college set up by Lala Lajpat Rai. A rare photograph has been reproduced by Chris, of a book from Dwarka das library again set up by Lala Lajpat Rai from his own collection of books has been reproduced, showing the stamp of Tilak School of Politics. The story goes up to setting up of Naujwan Bharat Sabha in 1924/26 and banned from city college campus by 1927 in first chapter and moves further in ‘What is to be done’- a Lenin book title, but also pre-Lenin Chernysvsky novel title, in second chapter. It narrates the story of HSRA formation along with continuation of Naujwan Bharat Sabha, leading to the insertion of concept of ‘Socialism’ in revolutionary programme by developing HRA to HSRA-Hindustan Socialist Republican Association on 8th and 9th September at Ferozeshah Kotla grounds of Delhi. This chapter also refers to Jawaharlal Nehru’s address to 3rd conference of Naujwan Bharat Sabha on 10th August 1929 at Amritsar. The story goes up to assassination of Saunders and bomb throwing in Central assemble and moves to ‘Infinite Inquilab’ in third chapter.\n\nInquilab Zindabad describes the details of trial of revolutionaries and their use of it for propaganda purposes, leading to massive mass upsurge in favor of revolutionaries, signature campaigns, demonstrations and solidarity meetings, while revolutionaries observed hunger strikes and faced brutal police attacks on them even inside the courts. The final act of refusal to cow down and kissing hangman’s noose with slogans of Inqulab Zindabad, turned these revolutionaries from ‘persons’ to ‘symbols’, who could not die with physical death and thus leading to their afterlives, delineated in part-ii if the book.\n\nIn next three chapters and prior to that in Prologue Chris quotes Madan Gopal Singh, whose celebrated Panjabi author father Harbhajan Singh lived close to Lahore jail, where three revolutionaries were executed, describes how whole village was up listening to shouts of Inquilab Zindabad from inside the jail and shouted back the slogan. In next chapter-Bhagat Singh’s corpse, the burning of bodies of revolutionaries away from Lahore jail in Hussainiwala is described and how the few pieces of bones were collected and brought back to Lahore to perform last rites at Ravi river bank. Fragments of revolutionaries were later brought in silver casket to Karachi congress and later exhibited at Esplanade Maidan in Bombay. Then the narration shifts to formation of various organizations and publications of Bhagat Singh’s writings in collections, beginning with Amarjit Chandan in Punjabi, Veerender Sindhu, a niece of Bhagat Singh in Hindi and Shiv Verma in English. Historian Bipan Chandra’s introduction to Why I am an Atheist, is underlined as first academia effort to focus on Bhagat Singh’s thinking personality. In further chapter-Living with the Dead focus shifts to artistic and cultural creation of Bhagat Singh image through picture, paintings, films, plays and writings. Then issue of political appropriation by rightwing groups such as Tajinder Bagga’s Bhagat Singh Kranti sena, patronized by RSS, who could physically attack eminent civil rights activist Prashant Bhushan, is brought into discussion. The fact that distorted pictorial images of Bhagat Singh holding gun with twitching moustaches, yellow turban, all emphasize on rightwing distortion of Bhagat Singh’s personality. But counter efforts to focus on Bhagat Singh’s progressive ideas by left and Dalit groups are also brought to notice of readers. A very interesting image of Bhagat Singh-Ambedkar merged into each other by Bhagat Singh Ambedkar Student Organization (BASO) is produced from their facebook page. Khalistanis added Bhagat Singh portrait to Bhindrawale image posters.\n\nIn another chapter Life and Life and Death in Monuments-the last chapter before conclusion studies different statues and museum representations of Bhagat Singh and this chapter include Bhagat Singh being celebrated in Pakistan as well through plays and songs.\n\nAuthor Chris Moffat concludes his study of Bhagat Singh as an open-ended task. In Chris’s words-‘This martyr’s extraordinary and multifarious afterlives provide an important opportunity to think about how the spectral might be written profitably into the study of politics in South Asia and across the postcolonial world more generally.’(Page 248)\n\nWhile Chris Moffat’s rigorous study of Bhagat Singh should find favour with academia, the common reader will not be much comfortable with the highly academic phraseology used by the researcher, whose interest is visible in progressive and objective presentation of Bhagat Singh’s enigmatic personality. Hope author will bring out a popular edition of his study, which will not be as expensive as this edition is, though Indian edition of the book is almost ten times cheaper than UK edition! The quality of production of book is excellent.\n\nAugust 2019\n\nThis is an interesting book on legendary revolutionary Bhagat Ram Talwar, brother of martyr Harikishan, who had shot at Punjab Governor during Panjab University Lahore convocation in 1931 and who was in same jail, where Bhagat Singh and his comrades were held. Bhagat Singh wrote two letters discussing Harikishan case and expressed serious reservations as it was presented in the courts. The story like narration style of the author makes book readable, but author is not very charitable to Bhagat Ram Talwar, who has been presented a Silver in original title of the book, while in Indian edition, title has been changed to-The Indian Spy, though there has been no change in the contents and Talwar story has been narrated as his spy name-Silver!\n\nBhagat Ram Talwar, a Hindu Pathan from the Northwest Frontier Province of British India, was the only quintuple spy of World War II, spying for Britain, Italy, Germany, Japan and the USSR. His exploits and the people he worked with were truly remarkable. His spying missions saw him walk back and forth 24 times from Peshawar to Kabul eluding capture and certain death. He fooled the Germans so successfully that they gave him £ 2.5 million, in today’s money, and awarded him the Iron Cross. His British spymaster was Peter Fleming, the brother of Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond. Fleming, operating from the gardens of the Viceroy’s House in wartime Delhi, gave him the code name Silver. Talwar became a spy after he helped Subhas Chandra Bose escape India via Kabul. Bose was seeking help from Germany and Japan to free India and never discovered that Talwar was betraying him to the British. Talwar settled in UP after India won independence; he died of natural causes in 1983.\n\nBased on research in previously classified files of the Indian, British, Russian and other governments, The Indian Spy tells for the first time the full story of the most extraordinary agent of World War II.\n\nWhen Mihir Bose was researching for the book on Subhash Bose-the Lost Hero, he came across Talwar’s story and he started researching about the man. Talwar has written his own autography-The Talwars of Pathan Land and Subhas Chandra’s Great Escape. Uttam Chand Malhotra’s book-When Subhas Bose was Ziauddin are also referred. Researcher had lot of interviews and consulted archives of many countries to find out that how Talwar was working spy for multiple countries at one time and he received much amount for that and took great risks. But he is less charitable to him as he remained committed to Communist party and whatever he did, was with approval of the party. The book is otherwise a fascinating read, but for author’s anti communist slant.\n\nThe book is written on the presumption that only the reporter Jupinderjit was able to discover the story of Bhagat Singh’s pistol, which was deposited in Police Academy Phillaur in 1944 and remained there till 1969 and then transferred to BSF academy Indore and it was reporter who ultimately found it there. Though he has quoted many authorities in his favour, but it was a common knowledge that this pistol was kept in display in criminal acquired gallery in Police academy and there was a public hue and cry about it in early seventies in many Punjabi newspapers. Surprising part is that neither Punjabi newspapers nor people who demanded in earlier times to remove the criminal tag from Bhagat Singh’s pistol spoke about it.\n\nBut the better part of the book is that Jupinderjit has somehow focused on Bhagat Singh’s ideas and intellectual aspects, though in a immature manner.\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nਤਰਸੇਮ ਬਾਹੀਆ , ਸੀਨੇ ਖਿਚ ਜਿੰਨਾਂ ਨੇ ਖਾਧੀ, 2013, ਲੁਧਿਆਣਾ , ਚੇਤਨਾ ਪ੍ਰਕਾਸ਼ਨ, ਸਫੇ 200+8 ਸਫੇ ਫੋਟੋਗ੍ਰਾਫ , ਮੁੱਲ 250/ ਰੁਪਏ\n\nਕਿਤਾਬ ਬਾਰੇ ਬਾਹੀਆ ਦੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਕਥਨ ਤੋਂ ਇਲਾਵਾ ਹਰਭਜਨ ਦਿਓਲ ਅਤੇ ਬਾਹੀਆ ਦੇ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਰਹੇ ਡਾ ਸੁਰਜੀਤ ਨੇ ਭੁਮਿਕਾ ਲਿਖੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਲਹਿਰ ਬਾਰੇ ਚੰਗੀ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਹੈ। 1969 ਦੀ ਰਾਮਪੁਰਾ ਫੂਲ ਦੀ ਘਟਨਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੇਰਾ ਜ਼ਿਕਰ ਘਟਾ ਕੇ ਕੀਤਾ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ, ਪਰ ਠੀਕ ਹੈ, ਬਾਹੀਆ ਦੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਹੰਸ ਰਾਜ ਕਾਂਗਰਸੀ ਸਨ। ਸਾਡਾ ਦੋਵਾਂ ਦਾ ਪਿੰਡ ਮਹਿਰਾਜ ਹੈ।\n\nOctober/November 2019\n\nKhooni Vaisakhi-the long poem by eminent Panjabi novelist Nanak Singh was first published in May 1920, when he was not known as a novelist and wrote poetry in his young age. Very interesting title in Panjabi language first publication, given above, has been reproduced by his grandson Navdeep Suri in his Jallianwala Bagh centenary English translation of the book this year by HarperCollins. The book was released in Delhi on perhaps 13th April 2019, exactly hundred years after the most gruesome massacre at Amritsar. Nanak Singh who himself was present in Jallianwala Bagh at this ghastly massacre ordered by Brigadier Dyer, escaped miraculously as few dead bodies covered him and his other friends, who accompanied him to the bagh, died in that massacre. Shaken by the event, Nanak Singh wrote a long poem by the title of Khooni Visakhi-Bloody Vaisakhi and giving sub title as General Dyer’s fire in Jallianwala Bagh on 13th April 1919 in Amritsar.\n\nNanak Singh was just 22 years old at the time of this most tragic and defining moment of Indian freedom struggle and was known as Bhai Nanak Singh, as he was deeply religious person and was already known for his earlier poetry book-Satguru Mahima, which is mentioned even in the title of Khooni Visakhi!\n\nIncidentally this book was published by his own publication-Bhai Nanak Singh Kirpal Singh Book owners Bazar Mai Sevan, Amritsar, at that time and book publication date was also given as 30th May 1919. The small book was proscribed immediately after and later on even the copies of book became difficult to find. The interesting story of finding out this historic text has been narrated by Nanak Singh’s grandson Navdeep Suri, who just recently retired as Ambassador from UAE-Abu Dhabi. Navdeep Suri an accomplished translator has translated few of Nanak Singh’s novels earlier like Adh Khidia ful-The Life Incomplete and Pavitar Paapi-The Watch Maker. Pavitar Paapi was also made into a film by Balraj Sahni in seventies, which introduced Balraj Sahni’s son Prikshit Sahni to film world. Nanak Singh’s other popular novel Chitta Lahu-The White Bloodwas translated in English by his other grandson Dilraj Suri and in Russian by granddaughter of Tolstoy, Natasha Tolstoy, who herself presented the copy of her translation to the writer.\n\nIn a biographical note to the translation of Khooni Vaisakhi, Navdeep Suri has given a beautiful narration of his grandfather’s life and his own childhood-The Bagh, The Book and our Bauji-\n\nNanak Singh or Bauji of translator was born on 4th July 1897 in Chak Hamid in Jhelum district of Punjab, now in Pakistan. He was born as Hans Raj; his father Bahadur Chand Suri had a modest trading shop at Peshawar and Hans Raj joined to help him at the age of 8 years. Interestingly his first poetry was published at the age of 12 years as Seeharfi Hans Raj. However, under the influence of Giani Bagh Singh, Hans Raj became Nanak Singh in 1915 at the age of 18 years and his poetic talent gave another collection mentioned earlier-Satguru Mahima in 1918 at the age of 21 years. It got him two titles-Kavishar as Nanak Singh Kavisher(The Poet) and Bhai Nanak Singh-Bhai a respectable term in Sikh faith. After Jallianwala Bagh Nanak Singh participated in Guru Ka Bagh morcha and freedom struggle and tasted the life of jail, which caused him getting deaf in one ear, as he was kept in cold damp cells of jail without proper warm covers, which caused him loose complete hear loss in one of his already damaged ears. The jail life made him read lot of books, including Prem Chand-the great Hindi novelist, which has a defining impact on his personality and he discovered his true talent in fiction writing and by the time he died in 1971 at the age of 74 years, he has more than three dozen novels to his credit. In fact, his first novel written in jail, was found out by jail staff and it was confiscated and destroyed. After coming out of jail he began with writing Matrayee Maa(The Step Mother-1924), going up to Koi Haria Boot Rahio Ri(Hardly a green… leaf survived) . Nanak Singh won Sahitya Akademi award for his novel based on Ghadar Party-Ik Mian Do Talwaran(Two Swords on One Sheath). Inder Kumar Gujral, who was a great fan of Nanak Singh got a postage stamp bearing Nanak Singh image issued in his term as Prime Minister during Nanak Singh birth centenary in 1997.\n\nThe story of Khooni Visakhi revival is interesting leading to publication on this long-lost book. Since family had no copy of the proscribed book, neither Nanak Singh took any interest in tracing the book in his own life time, Kulwant Singh Suri, son of Nanak Singh and father of Navdeep Suri and a publisher, started making efforts to trace a copy of the book He was helped in his pursuit by Giani Zail Singh, who became Home Minister in Indira Gandhi Government in 1980, who himself was fan of Nanak Singh.\n\nMeanwhile Dr. Kishan Singh Gupta, a lecturer of Panjabi in DAV College Amritsar came across original copy of the book around the time and wrote a paper based on this book. Kulwant Singh Suri contacted him and also got a copy from Home Ministry acquired likely from British Library London, keeping a record of proscribed books. Both the copies had similar text, so Suri published it in 1980 in ten volume collected works of Nanak Singh in its tenth volume. However, the original title of the publication was not found in 1980 and it was provided with the help of Kanwaljit Suri, another uncle of Navdeep Suri, by Chetan Singh, ex Director Languages dept. of Punjab Government at Patiala only in 2018 at the time of publication of English translation of the book and Navdeep Suri wrote this story and introduction in December 2018, still serving as Ambassador, he also got book released at Delhi and Dubai during his active service before recently getting retired from active service.\n\nThe poem Khuni Visakhi, which was republished in Punjabi in 1980 has been translated here in this collection in both Hindi and English. It has taken only 63 pages, while on one side of the page is Hindi version on other side is English version, few pages are just half-filled pages, so in total, full pages poem is around 10 pages only. In 10th volume of Nanak Singh collected works; the poem has just taken nine full pages from page 619 to 627. But the size of the poem is not important, its significance lies in its historicity of recreating the terror of 13th April 1919, as the poet begins with describing Rowlett bill controversy, its passing, people’s resistance and Dyer’s atrocities including Jallianwala Bagh firing and imposition of Martial Law in Punjab. All the major happenings relating to the fateful day are recreated, like celebration of Ram Naumi as a day of Hindu-Muslim unity and fraternity, arrest of Drs Satya Pal and Kitchlew, Bhandari bridge firing and killings, , finally Jallianwala Bagh cruelties, deaths and cries of people, how the bodies were jointly disposed off and appeals to government with deaf ears.\n\nThis collection includes a small write up by Justin Rowlatt, great grandson of Sir Sidney Rowlatt, who wrote the infamous and notorious Rowaltt committee or Sedition committee report, as it was called and published, in 1918. Justin Rowlatt remained South Asian correspondent of BBC in New Delhi till 2017 and had visited Jallianwalla Bagh. He wrote a critical note about his ancestor-The Sins of the Great Grandfather-\n\nJustin Rowlatt felt a great sense of shame, as he was not mistreated at the Bagh, but was treated well by Bagh secretary S K Mukherjee and shown the whole Bagh, now a memorial and he feels more ashamed that his great grandfather was rewarded for this report with Knighthood! Sense of shame is always a liberating feeling for a sensitive and humane person.\n\nThis small book also includes critical evaluation of Nanak Singh and his poem by Prof. H S Bhatia, former Dean of GNDU Amritsar, who remained once a colleague and now a friend.\n\nBook has an attractive get up, though price for small book is bit prohibitive at 399/ rupees, hope its paperback edition with affordable price comes soon.\n\nAmolak Singh, Jallianwala Bag, 2017, Tarakbharti, Barnala, pages 88\n\nThis book is published by Comrade Gandharv Sen Kochhad and Surinder Kumari Kochhad, editor name is given Amolak Singh, who has mentioned content details in his editorial. The writers of articles include Gandharv Sen Kochhad, Rajaram (Shastri-wrongly added), Parminder Singh, Gurbux rai Sethi, Mandeep Kaur Sodhi, Arjan Singh Gadgaj etc. Gadgaj article focusses on a brave woman Attar Kaur, who refused to accept any compensation for the death of her husband Bhatia in bagh massacre, even from Indian Government later and Mandeep Sodhi refers to Ratan Devi another tragic woman, who had to keep her husband’s dead body in her lap for whole night. Amolak write ups are sentimental. Gandharv Sen Kochhad gives the details of British bills and focuses on Hindu-Muslim unity during the tragedy. Parminder Singh brings his structural/semiotic theory in describing historic event. Desh Bhagat Yadgar hall demand charter to Govt. of India is reproduced and book ends with poem of Amrita Pritam’s Khuni Saveran-Bloody Mornings. It is just ordinary book.\n\nComrade Ram Chandra, History of HSRA and Naujwan Bharat Sabha, self-published from Delhi 1986/2003, pages 288\n\nThis is one of very important book relating to Bhagat Singh and his movement. Published by Comrade Ramchandra, close comrade of Bhagat Singh in Naujwan Bharat Sabha, he published three books with his own finances. I have read this book earlier also, but not taken notes from it. Now I understand that why this book gets less attention. This book is full of information, but information is not well organized and put in chronological order and other reason is Ramchandra is critical of Ghadarite/Kirti party comrades, whom we all revere. But for rich information, one can not skip this book.\n\nThe book is divided into 11 chapters and further divided in 70 sub chapters and Index is given at the end.\n\nIn brief preface author informs he readers that it was in 1975 when Ramchandra was chairman of reception committee for holding freedom fighters conference, Kulbir Singh younger brother of Bhagat Singh prodded him to write a book on Naujwan Bharat Sabha and Bhagat Singh. Later some research students of Punjab and other Universities asked for some information on NBS, while meeting in National archives. Later Shyam Lal Manchanda, who conducted many interviews with freedom fighters for Nehru Memorial Museum and Library interviewed him and advised to write more in detail, so Comrade Ramchandra took up this task and after collecting material from records for five years and holding interviews with old comrades, came out with this book in 1986.\n\nUndoubtedly this is the best source book for studying Naujwan Bharat Sabha and HSRA.\n\nIn a ten-page Introduction to the book, gives a brief outline of revolutionary youth movement in Punjab. He begins with 1906 when Bharat Mata Society and Anjuman-e-Mohabbane Watan organisations were formed with Ajit Singh, Kishan Singh, Sufi Amba Prasad, Mehta Anand Kishore, Lal Chand Falak, Kedar Nath and Banke Dayal became active. The second phase he refersto Ghadar movement, followedby BabbarAkali movement. And in twenties Naujwan Bharat Sabha and HSRA was the core movement. Comrade Ramchandra, who remained President and General Secretary of NBS, gives it launching year as 1924, where as Sohan Singh Josh and many others refer it as 1926. But Ramchandra is perhaps correct as he was founder of it from its inception. May be more active functioning of Sabha started from 1926. He refers to that after non cooperation movement of congress party in 1921-22 led to starting independent educational institutions. National Schools and College were opened and one such National College and High School was set up by Lala Lajpat Rai. One medical college was also opened. Ramchandra thinks that Bhai Parmanand was most important teachers, who taught revolutionary European history. By 1925, NBS framed its constitution and by 1926, Sabha got a status. Bhagat Singh was General Secretary f Sabha and I was President, both arrested in 1927. On 13th April 1928, NBS held first provincial conference in Amritsar and proclaimed its goal to establish Independent Socialist Republic f the Workers&peaanta by all possible means. British officials took serious note of the Sabha and noted Bhagat Singh to be the main person in its foundation. Lahore Students Union was formed as appendage to Sabha as a recruiting ground for revolutionary work. British top CID officer D. Petrie is quoted by Ramchandra for this. Ramchandra considers NBS the façade of the magnificent bulding, behind which stood Students Union, Bal Students Union, Bal Bharat Sabha and HSRA. Ideologically Sabha believed in pure communism and had great sympathy for Soviet Union. Lenin appointed M N Roy to look work in India and he created links, leading to Kanpur Communist (Bolshevik) Conspiracy case. He describes Ghadarites as political mahants. He refers to Ahmad Din and Mubark Sagar leaving me and joining Ghadarites for money. He also refers to Bhagat Singh reading last book and communion with Lenin.\n\nRamchandra believed that Marx, Lenin, Stalin or Mao had no special brief to dictate to the world. He uses Muslim term-there is Khatam-ul-Nabi in Communism or socialism of my understanding! He thanks National Archives, NMML and JNU libraries for material and comrades for information. Ramchandra wrote the book at the age of 84, not I good health and published by own expense, as no publisher was ready to publish without money.\n\nAfter this introduction author moves to first chapter, introducing himself as born on 23rd May 1903 at village Rehan in Kangra district of now HP. His father Kirpa Ram was goldsmith, grocer, money lender and land owner. Ajit Singh, uncle of Bhagat Singh came to him once in sadhu garb. After passing primary in village school, he moved to Kathua for middle school and Sambha for high school..here Ram Dutt, father of Prem Dutt was second master and Arya Samajist. He completed his matriculation in April 1919, when there was Martial law in Punjab. He joined DAV College Lahore in September that year as admissions were held late due to Martial law. Ramchandra refers to appreciate Jagat Narain, who as member of Hunter Commission on Jallianwala Bagh, made British officers admit their accesses. He refers to congress enquiry committee as well, consisting of Madan Mohan Malviya, Pt. Motil Lal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi. He opined that nothing came out of Hunter committee report. He also refers to Feroze Chand, later life member and President of Servants of People society, who at the advice of Lala Lajpat Rai, held student conference in Gujranwala, where Lalaji made a stirring speech.\n\nRamchandra participated in Non-cooperation movement of Congress party and refers to loot in Khilafat movement. He charged one Dr. Syed Mohamood as having done corruption in the funds. Punjab Congress started National University known as Punjab Qaumi Vidyapeeth. Lala Lajpat Rai was Chancellor, Bhai Parmanand was VC, and Jugal Kishore, later a UP Minster was Principal. After him Chhabil Das appointed Principal. Non Cooperation in Lahore started from 16th May 1921 from Bradlaugh hall.\n\nFor lack of funds, National College collapsed in 1926, but its alumni included Bhagat Singh, Ramchandra, Banarsi Das, Raghbir Singh, Yashpal, Chhabil Dass, Jaichander Vidyalankar, Gopal Singh Qaumi, Babu Singh, Mohan Lal, and Mohan Lal Gautam, Shanti Sarup etc. It curriculum was entirely different from Govt. Colege One has to take and Indian language-Hindi, Urdu or Punjabi in Gurmukhi or Persian script. Its BA course was equivalent to BA Hons. Course of Govt. college. Jugal Kishore taught Politics, Bhai Parmanand History, Jai Chander Vidyalankar ancient history. Ghulam Hussain taught Socialism, he was arrested in Cawnpore conspiracy case, received pardon. H D Craik Chief Secretary Punjab.\n\nRamchandra passed his BA in 1923 and joined Daily Bandematram in Urdu. Bhagwati Charan and Ramchandra learnt French together. Chhabil Das initiated meeting of college students, called by Bhagat Singh-Chhabil Das, Paras Ram, Master Gurudutt, Bhagwati Charan, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Jai dev, Babu Singh, Som dev, Ganpat Rai, Jaswant Singh(Jhanda Singh?), Banarsi das present. Impact of Young Ireland, Young Turkey and Young Italy movement, also of Russian revolution. More meetings at Parimahal Lahore. Discussion on name of organization-Young India(Bhagat Singh?), differences, Ajit Singh Vidyarthi common friend. Tarun Bharat Sangh, Anjuman Naujwane Hind discussed, finally agreed to Naujwan Bharat Sabha and Young India Association. Motto-three SSS-Service, Sacrifice and Suffering. Kishan Singh and Dr. Satya Pal tried to implant Kedar Nath Saigal, resisted. Age 16 to 25 years. Kedarnath was 34! Activites with magic lantern in different cities at Jalandhar and Amritsar. Formed towards the end of 1924. Constitution framed in 1925, Master Guru Dutt, Bhagat Singh and Vohra elected President Sec and Treasurer. Guru Dutt left us openly, so Ramchandra requested by Bhagat Singh to lead. Bhagat Singh went to Kanpur in 1925 and started working with Sanyal and Jogesh Chatterjee.\n\nIn 1925, new revolutionary party formed merging Anushilan and Sanyal party called HRA. Bhagat Singh joined HRA and assumed name of Balwant,wrote in this assumed name. Kakori case…Ashfaqualla stayed in Lahore for 4- 5 weeks. Lived in Amarnath Vidyaklankar house with Hindu name given to Ashfaq. Maulana Zafar Ali gave five rupees cheerfully. Bhagwati charn doubted as CID man. Kakori case defence committee included Moti Lal Nehru, Govind Balabh Pant and Mohan Lal Saxena. Jagat Narain and his son Anand Narain Mulla became Govt. pleaders at 500/rupees fees per day, though Mothi Lal persuaded to defend Kakori accused.\n\nBolshevik case-Dange, Muzzafar Ahmad, MN Roy, Shaukat Usmani, Nalini Gupta, Singravelu Chettiar, Ghulam Hussain. Dange requested clemency in his hand written letters(Ramchandra did the copies) in Govt. records.\n\nBhagat Singh worked in staff of Pratap, then appointed Headmaster to avoid CID gaze. In 1926, Lajpat Rai fell out with Swaraj party and with Madan Mohan Malviya formed independent congress party sided with Hindu communalists, raised cry of Muslim. NBS opposed Lala and supported Swaraj party-Duni Chand and Satya Pal. Guru Dutt took employment wi th Lajpat Rai candidate Amethi Raajkumar, he was expelled from NBS. Lala party won election. Lala candidate Bakshi Tek Chand defeated Duni Chand, but was appointed High Court judge next day. Lala Achint Ram of Lala’s Servants society openly protested and supported Duni Chand. The Robert Browning poem Lost Leader was got printed by Bhagat Singh and Bhagwati Charan and widely distributed it, gave the copy to Malviya also, who mildly protested, but Lala came out heavily against NBS. Shortly after Lala and Moti Lal made up and Lala was made Deputy leader of Swaraj party.\n\nLeftists/communists Abdul Majid, Ferozedin Mansur, Fazal Ilahi, Qurban Gohar . Majid joined NBS. Second Communist conference was held in Lahore in March 1927, Ramchanda chairman, but conference abandoned as Shapurji Saklatwala wired that there was no recognized CPI. But Saklatwala agreed to join in joint labor conferences on 13th March in Delhi instead. It was attended by Muzzafar Ahmad and Bhupinder Nath Dutt also. Ramchandra appointed conveners for AITUC in 1927, later removed. NBS Meeting in Lahore was addressed by Dange, where Bhagat Singh and Bhagwati were present. Abdul Majid brought out Mehnatkash labout reforms from Lahore, edited by Ramchandra in 1927, later sentenced for publishing an article on Kakori. Bhagat Singh also arrested in 1927 and released on bail for sixty thousand rupees. Two errors here, Bhagat Singh was arrested on 5h May and released on 29th July and he was there for five weeks and not six months as mentioned by Ramchandra.\n\n13-14th April 1928 conference of NBS in Jallianwalla Bagh Amritsar, Dev Das Gandhi approached, accepted, later dropped, presided over by Kedar Nath Saigal. Three resolutions-1. Complete independence, 2. Change Tricolour to Red Flag 3. Religion as personal matter, separate from politics.

Goal to a(ttain Completely Independent Soverign, Socialist Republic of Peasant and Workers of India by all possible means(Kirti-28th May 1928)(Present-Bhagat Singh, Sohan Singh Josh, Ramchandra, Abdul Majid, Mohamad Tuffail, Ahsan Elahi, Hissam Din, Chhabil Das, Hari Singh Chakwalia, gopal Singh Qaumi, Kapal Dev Sharma)\n\nIndian Independence League in 1927 in Europe. Nehru scummbed to Gandhi, Bose stood firm on complete independence, that is how 26th January 1930 resolution of Puran Swaraj came as Dominion status was not given by 31st December 1929.\n\nNovember 1928 Delhi meeting of League- President S. Srinivas Iyengar, Secretaries-Nehru and Bose. Council-Ganesh Vidyarthi from UP, Kedar Nath Saigal from Punjab and more.\n\nBhagwati Charn wrote beautiful essay on 10th May 1857, Ramchandra mentions no idea what happended to that essay, but it was published in Kirti and now in Hindi as well.\n\nHRA to HSRA-Feroze Shah Kotla meeting-8&9th September 1928- attended by Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Bejoy Kumar Sinha, Surender Pandey, Jai Dev Kapur, Kundan Lal and Shiv Verma. Azad did not attend but agreed to resolutions-abandon families and renounce all religious symbols. BS got shaved in Ferozepur.Shaukat Usmani brought message from Russia for revolutionaries to visit Russia, in Shaukat memoirs, perhaps Stalin invited BS. Dhanwantri took the place of BS in NBS as Gen Sec.\n\nKirti used Bhai as prefix, I wrote to use Saathi as equivalent of Comrade, slowly changed. NBS actively supported 1928 Bardoli kisan movement, collected funds and remitted\n\nDecember 2019 f sixty thousand rupees. Two errors by Ramch\n\nAnita Anand, The Patient Assassin, The True Tale of Massacre, revenge and the Raj, London, Simon and Schuster, 2019, pages 384, Kindle ed\n\nThe Patient Assassin by London based Anita Anand is based on the life of Udham Singh, who assassinated Michael O’Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab during 1919, Jallianwala Bagh massacre at Amritsar.\n\nAnita Anand’s ancestors on both sides, her own and her husbands were involved in some way or the other in going through sufferings of the biggest massacre during British Raj after 1857 revolt. Her grandfather Ishwar Das Anand was in Jallianwala Bagh Amritsar on that fateful day of 13th April 1919 and survived as he left a bit early before the firing ordered by Reginald Dyer. Her husband’s ancestors came to settle in London in 1930’s and one of them lived with Udham Singh in London. So, as a writer she has the privilege of having heard the story from his close family, as well as she is professional broadcaster journalist with BBC, she used her skills again as a privileged journalist and researcher to build the story of Udham Singh in a narrative style. She already had another popular book on Sophia, the daughter of last Maharaja of Punjab Duleep Singh and also coauthor with celebrated historian William Darlymple on Kohinoor, she has given the shape of long narrative to the historical event. Albeit to make the historical event more interesting, she has taken the liberty to take narrative almost as fictional form with the creative use of a thriller as well.\n\nBefore She begins the narration, she has a quote from one of greatest novelists of the world Charles Dickens-‘Vengeance and retribution require long time; it is the rule’. The quote is from one of his famous novels-A Tale of Two Cities. The quote itself shows that the author through the historic event wishes to create a story of revenge as well.\n\nApart from 25 chapters of this spread out narration, nine chapters are in part one and 16 are in part two. In Preface the author has referred to her family connections to the event and the historic background and few known facts like the number of killings as per British and as per Indian perceptions. Apart from main contents of the book, the author has included-List of Illustrations(which are very important and rare), Acknowledgements, Endnotes, Bibliography and Index.\n\nPreface has underlined that on 13th April 1919, British officer of Irish origin Dyer had ordered his men to fire upon around 20000 innocent and unarmed men, women and children and the victims included a youngest baby of six months and oldest man in his eighties. Dyer was supported by then lieutenant governor of Punjab Michael O’Dwyer, which became the target of Udham Singh for revenge, as Dyer had died early in 1927. Dyer had boasted that he could have killed many more had his men not exhausted the firearms and if he could drive his armored car inside the Bagh through narrow lane with machine guns as he was seeking to teach a lesson to the restive province. Anita Anand refers to British Prime Minister David Cameron expressing remorse but not apologizing at the site itself 94 years later. Author’s grandfather Ishwar Das Anand suffered survivor’s guilt in his short life of forty years afterwards, with losing his sight as well.\n\nAmazon advertisement of the book says-\n\n“The dramatic true story of a celebrated young survivor of a 1919 British massacre in India, Udham Singh and his ferocious twenty-year campaign of revenge that made him a hero to hundreds of millions—and spawned a classic legend. ( Presence of Udham Singh in Jallianwala Bagh has not been conclusively proven, evidence is there that he was away in Africa at the time of happening)\n\nWhen Sir Michael O’Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, ordered Brigadier General Reginald Dyer to Amritsar, he wanted Dyer to bring the troublesome city to heel. Sir Michael had become increasingly alarmed at the effect Gandhi was having on his province, as well as recent demonstrations, strikes, and shows of Hindu-Muslim unity. All these things, to Sir Michael, were a precursor to a second Indian revolt. What happened next shocked the world. An unauthorized gathering in the Jallianwallah Bagh in Amritsar in April 1919 became the focal point for Sir Michael’s law enforcers. Dyer marched his soldiers into the walled garden, blocking the only exit. Then, without issuing any order to disperse, he instructed his men to open fire, turning their guns on the thickest parts of the crowd, filled with over a thousand unarmed men, women, and children. For ten minutes, the soldiers continued firing, stopping only when they ran out of ammunition.\n\nAccording to legend(yes, it legend only, not proven fact), eighteen-year-old Sikh orphan Udham Singh was injured in the attack, and remained surrounded by the dead and dying until he was able to move the next morning. Then, he supposedly picked up a handful of blood-soaked earth, smeared it across his forehead, and vowed to kill the men responsible. (All legend, folk tale only)\n\nThe truth, as the author has discovered, is more complex—but no less dramatic. Award-winning journalist Anita Anand traced Singh’s journey through Africa, the United States, and across Europe until, in March 1940, he finally arrived in front of O’Dwyer himself in a London hall ready to shoot him down.
