Do you have any suggestions?\n\nI want to study Sanskrit, but do not know where to start. Can you help?\n\nI do not know any language from India but feel an affinity with philosophy and spiritual teachings originated in India.\n\nWe have attempted to compile documents in Sanskrit at https://sanskritdocuments.org/ and its mirror sites, along with links to various organizations affiliated with the Indian \"thought.\" Due to different individual interests, it is difficult to point out where one should start. There are links to dictionaries, tutorials, processing tools, translations, and audio files which will aid in the learning process.\n\nFrom the links in audio files you may want to choose one document to study as a beginning project rather than browsing through all documents at this site. Browsing the documents at this site gives a broad overview, but does not lead to a greater understanding of Indian languages. Keep working on it!\n\nMr. Bhagwan Singh expressed his opinion on influencing for the love of the language and literature : \"People do not learn languages out of reverence. There are many attendant factors:\n\nThe storage of information, which compels you to learn in order to be better informed.\n\nMonetary benefits and status up gradation, that is why people were eager to learn official languages even if they be foreign- Persian, English.\n\nCultural identity, and religious conformity, Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, Prakrit in case of the Jains, Hebrew, reassertion of Gurumukhi script despite its shortcomings, etc.\n\nSecrecy, that leads to invention and retention of scripts and languages not understood by outsiders.\n\nLinguistic environment and accessibility to larger number of people, that is why, despite many reservation be some states [people are bound to learn Hindi in India and English when they move outside,\n\nRichness of literature, Brajbhasha was learnt throughout Hindi belt and beyond prior to acceptance of Hindi, and Awadhi was emulated by poets sitting in Brajabhasha area prior to that because of Tulsi and Jayasi.\n\nCultural domination, that prompted Europeans, especially Germans, Britons, French and now Americans to learn as many languages as possible and to be able to penetrate the guarded circles of societies, to be able to dominate and reorient those societies at will besides cultural, political and economic domination.\n\nIf fact in the above order, the 5th (Linguistic environment and accessibility) out-stands other considerations and 3rd comes much lower.\"\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: Do you have any free fonts to generate Sanskrit text?\n\nThere are quite a few places one can get fonts. Some of them are:\n\nhttp://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/devafonts.htm\n\nDr. Berlin's Foreign Font Archive and Typefaces for the Languages of India.\n\nPart of Itranslator available at http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html, http://www.bharatbhasha.org.in/,\n\nhttp://www.indianlanguages.com/\n\nUnicode fonts available at http://www.wazu.jp\n\nhttp://www.cybershoppee.com/downloads/fonts.htm\n\nhttp://www.baraha.com/\n\nAnthony Stone's site for ISO 15919: Unicode/Indic Transliteration standardization and other links.\n\nUlrich Stiehl's Unicode transliteration and other Indic fonts based on URW Palladio fonts developed under German-Polish Friendship project for Indologists. Access Ulrich's 36-page manual which explains the future of Indic transliteration fonts.\n\nhttps://sanskritdocuments.org/processing_tools_fonts/processing_tools_fonts.html\n\nThe ISCII to Devanagari font plug-ins may be downloaded from: http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/onlineServices/Dictionaries/iscii/index.htm.\n\nhttp://neel1.virtualave.net/,\n\nMail to (sanskrit at cheerful dot c om) to let us know if you find additional sites with fonts for Indian scripts.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: Where may I find a history of the Sanskrit language?\n\nWhere is Sanskrit located in the world?\n\nSanskrit is certainly used mainly in India. It is considered the originator (mother) of most of the languages in India. As a high level Indo-European language, one time, it had widespread influence on the people in Asia and Northern regions (including part of Russia.) Unfortunately, over long time period, due to conquests and expansionist attitudes of certain beliefs and societies, it stayed concentrated mainly in India/Nepal region. For example, there is an original word \"sthaana\" in Sanskrit meaning place, which is now changed to stan (Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Turkministan, Afganistan, et cetera) indicating that the language was circulated in these regions. (India is called Hindusthan, as beliefs in the region are termed as Hindu, of people living beyond Sindhu river, which is now called Indus.) There are quite a few examples found by modern linguists confirming such understanding.\n\nSanskrit is not used in daily conversation (except in certain families) although sizable number of words in vernacular languages have originated from Sanskrit. Sanskrit has a very finely structured set of vowels and consonants based on pronunciation (see links below for alphabets). Many ancient texts, concerned with our personal life, surpassing the concept of organized religion, are written in Sanskrit and are still applicable to our lives.\n\nPlease see a set of articles on History of Sanskrit language. A brief presentation is available at wikipedia, The origin and evolution of Sanskrit on hinduwebsite.com, a collection of quotes and historical perspective at A Tribute to Hinduism site, Why study Sanskrit? on acharya site.\n\nAn article on Sanskrit by NASA scientist Rick Briggs in Artificial Intelligence magazine (Spring 1985) may interest you. The article is mirrored at http://www.gosai.com/science/ under Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence. Additional research is underway at Carnegie Mellon University, for example, on the topic of Deciphering the Vedas by Prabhu Ram Raghunathan.\n\nYou may want to search the archives of discussion groups of Indology: http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/archives/indology.html and http://indology.info/, and the Sanskrit digest (subscription information is in https://sanskritdocuments.org/projects_digest.html. Additional information is available in the usergroups file. Yahoo groups that promote Sanskrit learning is given in sanskritlinks.blogspot.com, see the entry for Sunday, July 16, 2006 entry.\n\nAlso see the following URLs.\n\nhttp://www.armenianhighland.com/homeland/chronicle120.html\n\nhttp://www.cofah.utsa.edu/drinka/pie/lang_sanskrit.htm\n\nSanskrit literature, article from Encarta Encyclopaedia.\n\nSanskrit literature, The Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nhttp://www.fwkc.com/encyclopedia/low/articles/s/s023000436f.html\n\nhttp://www.historyofindia.com/sanskrit.html\n\nhttp://www.vedamsbooks.com/no12299.htm\n\nhttp://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/11436.html\n\nhttp://encarta.msn.com/index/conciseindex/08/008C1000.htm\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: Where can I find the Sanskrit alphabets and their sounds?\n\nI would like to teach the sounds to my five year old son. I heard that Sanskrit alphabets are scientifically grouped by the great sage Panini. Is there any software available for learning Sanskrit?\n\nHere is a simple beginning: See the alphabet, and hear the associated sounds at\n\nhttps://sanskritdocuments.org/marathi/alphabet.html or\n\nhttp://members.tripod.com/sarasvati/alphabet.html.\n\nPenn language center of University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, has alphabets in real video format.\n\nThere are quite a few sites providing alphabets and sounds of Devanagari characters using Flash. Please see them at\n\nwikipedia,\n\nhttp://www.avashy.com/hindiscripttutor.htm,\n\nhttp://chl.anu.edu.au/languages/devanagari,\n\nhttp://members.tripod.com/sarasvati/devanagari/alphabets.html by Hemanth Kumar,\n\nhttp://www.bharatdarshan.co.nz/hinditeacher/,\n\nand well studied http://acharya.iitm.ac.in site.\n\nSome of these even show how the letters are written with a pen and a slate for you to practice.\n\nVyas Houston, director of the American Sanskrit Institute has published books and manuals depicting Sanskrit sound generation and physical locations of different sounds. For example, please see for alphabets and their position in the mouth. There are others intresting articles that will help grasp the importance of Studying Sanskrit, e.g. Language of Enlightenment, Sanskrit and teh Technological Age.\n\nSyracuse University's Hindi division has developed scripts to show strokes on how Devanagari alphabets are written along with their audio sounds.\n\nSome of the translated documents, tutorials, correspondence courses, and books linked from the FAQ will help you learn Sanskrit; however, there is no substitute to learning from knowledgeable individuals.\n\nAlthough it is a little diversion to the answer, one should browse around Languages and Scripts of India site developed by Yashwant Malaiya. Another site built by Professor Kalyana Krishnan at IIT, Madras with same title Languages and Scripts of India as a part of the multilingual software. This is a unique software which delas with major languages of India. A rare collection of alphabets for Devanagari, languages from India, Tibetan, Brahmi, Persian, and other South east languages is built by Eden Golshani. A modi script site is developed by Rajiv Mhasawade.\n\nProf. Himanshu Pota has complied various links for learning Hindi which may be useful for learning Sanskrit as well. See http://www.ee.adfa.edu.au/staff/hrp/personal/Hindi/index.html . He also writes a blog for Learning Sanskrit at http://www.ee.adfa.edu.au/staff/hrp/personal/sanskrit/index.html.\n\nLinks to Sanskrit ebooks are compiled at sanskritebooks.org. Please make use of these books.\n\nA few have asked us to show the \"original\" script instead of commonly used Devanagari. As we know, Devanagari is supposed to have originated from Brahmi script. Please see http://www.ancientscripts.com/sitemap.html and compare Brahmi and Devanagari. Also see the reference in http://www.vidyavrikshah.org/sanskrit.html\n\nIf you are involved in teaching, read an article Good teaching qualities: inducing interest and positive expectations by Premchand Palety with an example of a Sanskrit teacher.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: I wish to have all the Vedas, Upanishads, Mahabharata and Ramayana in print in Sanskrit and translated in English. Do you know where can I get them? Are they all available in audio format?\n\nYes, all are available in print. Please refer to publications by Motilal Banarasidas, Ramakrishna Mission, Chinmaya Mission, Gita Press, and other publishers in India. Please see links for books at https://sanskritdocuments.org/. A list of bookstores is available here.\n\nLinks to Sanskrit and Hindu scriptural ebooks are compiled at sanskritebooks.org. Please make use of these books.\n\nSee a Repository of paintings by HareKrishan\n\nAudio cassettes of chanting of all the Vedas are available from http://www.ahista.com/dvt/vedchant.html. The cassettes come with printed books with English translations. See all other Veda related links in doc_veda.\n\nPlease refer to Ramayana, Mahabharat, Rigveda files for texts and some translations. The English meaning of Valmiki Ramayana in audio cassettes form is available at http://www.RamayanAudio.com/\n\nThere are some audio clips and excellent presentation of Sanskrit documents on Dale Steinhauser's Sanskrit document's site.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: I need to translate some Sanskrit verses into English. Is there any software available which will translate them for me?\n\nCan you translate English text into Sanskrit?\n\nThere is some attempt of a software for direct translation of Hindi/Sanskrit at pocket translator. There is professional help available at web-translator 1 or 2, and freelang.net. There is no easy software as avilable for Oriental and European languages.\n\nReferring to the online Sanskrit dictionaries or installing Louis Bontes' dictionary utility for Monier William's digitized dictionary at Cologne available at http://members.ams.chello.nl/l.bontes/ will help. Klaus Glashoff's http://spokensanskrit.de is a new online hypertext dictionary.\n\nA scholarly translational service is available as a part of http://www.samskrita-bharati.org/translation.html.\n\nIt is also a good idea to subscribe to the following mailing lists with genuine interest. Subscribing just to get translations may not invoke a reply from those who visit frequently.sanskrit-digest, indology (see groups.yahoo.com for rejuvenated group), advaita-L, ambaa-L, dvaita, alt.hindu (newsgroup not active any more), where many scholars and devotees interact.\n\nVisit Kiran Paranjape's http://freetranslationblog.blogspot.com/ for free translation of words and sentences.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: I want to encode Natyashastra of Bharatamuni and put it on the Sanskrit Documents site so that many can read it in the original. How can I do that?\n\nI would like to volunteer for the minor list of the wish list. How do I go about volunteering?\n\nI downloaded Itranslator99 and got familiar with encoding scheme. Can I encode Lalita Sahasranama?\n\nYou are welcome to enter any text which has not been already encoded. we normally maintain a wishlist or a list of pending items to guide volunteers decide the text. (We like to avoid duplication of efforts so please check with us when you decide about a text. For example, Lalita Sahasranama is already encoded so there is no need to re-encode it unless one is doing it to develop devotion.)\n\nIf you have a PC, please download and install Itranslator99/2003 available at http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html. There is an Itrans encoding scheme table in the help menu. Please print it and use it to get familiar with the software. If the auto-convert option is on, you will be able to see the Devanagari display immediately as you type. Alternately, the scheme is given in a separate file.\n\nFor Mac and Unix/Linux users, there is web-interface available as mentioned elsewhere in this document.\n\nRefer to the web-interface common errors and tips, which points to additional links.\n\nIt is best to develop a methodology for typing up the text so that it is not physically and mentally taxing. We also emphasize encoding the text for your own studies and enjoyment, providing it to other users as a side activity, after you become more comfortable with the encoding scheme.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: I have a Macintosh. Most of the fonts available are for PCs or Windows. Where can I get fonts for the Macintosh?\n\nThere is a list of Devanagari fonts available for all the platforms from Yashwant Malaiya's site. There are also various web interfaces mentioned in this document that are platform-independent.\n\nAlso see Sparshabhumi site for Devanagari & other language scripts from India, compiled by Christian Coseru.\n\nSince the introduction of Mac System 8.5, there has been built-in support for Mac's worldscript and languages such as Sanskrit, Hindi, Gujarati, Nepali, Punjabi, Marathi, etc. One has to install the appropriate support from the installation CD. It continues through to OS X as well. It is supposed to be very easy to use. The keyboard can be configured for Inscript or QWERTY for native English speakers. Since it works at the system level all programs that are worldscript aware support it. It can be used in Microsoft Word. Contact Rothrock for additional information.\n\nThe Macintosh became a Unix-based system as of version 10.1 of Mac OS X. (Apple claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of Unix-based computers, a distinction previously enjoyed by Sun Microsystems, HP, DEC, etc.) This means that a large amount of open-source Unix software that runs on Linux, FreeBSD, etc., is also available for Mac OS X. The best-known open-source distro is Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net), and can be used to install teTeX (the most common distribution of LaTeX and associated tools). It needs XCode Tools 1.1/1.5 (which comes with Mac OS X 10.3 \"Panther\") to be installed. (Mac OS X 10.2 \"Jaguar\" users need to install the December 2002 version of the Apple Developer Tools.)\n\nInstalling ITRANS can be done after installing teTeX (through Fink or otherwise) is completed. It should not be too difficult for someone familiar with Unix to accomplish this, but as the Itrans deeveloper Avinash Chopde cautions, it can be a daunting task for one new to it. Please visit http://www.dvaita.info/shrao/itrans/ for additional information.\n\nRichmond Mathewson (richmondmathewson at gmail.com) has developed Macintosh and Windows based Sanskrit Typewriter, which is a clickable keyboard based (letter by letter) entry system for Devanagari and Roman output. A short program needs to be downloaded and installed.\n\nLalitalaalitah has developed Medha keyboard and font structure for Macintosh as well as Windows (XP to Windows 10) Files and instructions are available at http://eng.lalitaalaalitah.com/medha/.\n\nWith the availability of Unicode fonts, one can also generate Devanagari textonline, suitable for all computer platforms, using Itrans On-line Web Interface and HiTrans with Itrans transliteration scheme.\n\nAjit Krishnan has experimented with Devanagari IME for Mac users. Visit video instructions on \"How to type devanagari script on OSX.\" The associated installation instructions and details are given at http://www.aupasana.com/software (scroll down to \"lipika ime\").\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: What does \"raso vai saH, rasaM hy evAyaM labdhvAnandI bhavati\" mean in Sanskrit?\n\nHow can I generate \"symbols\" for words such as Namaste, OM?\n\nI want to know the meaning of Gayatri mantra.\n\nWhere can I find meaning of names in Surya Namaskar?\n\nHow does one write OM maNi padme huM in Sanskrit?\n\nCan you translate \"God Bless You\" in Sanskrit?\n\nCan you translate following words in Sanskrit?\n\nCan you translate some blessings \"live life to the full\" and \"follow your heart?\"\n\n\"raso vai saH, rasaM hy evAyaM labdhvAnandI bhavati\" translates as \"He is the essence, by obtaining That all this also\n\nPerhaps, the pronouns need to be explained. The \"saH\" refers to the \"brahma\". He (or it) is indeed (vai) the essence. Only (eva) having obtained (labdhvaa) it (rasaM) he (ayaM - probably a jiiva in this context) becomes (bhavati) happy (aanandii).\n\nFor meanings of Namaste, OM, Gayatri mantra please see general documents list. You can find suitable mantra for yourself based on the birth particulars.\n\nFor Surya Namaskar, Sun salutations, suryanamaskar, please refer to the sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 as a few examples.\n\nKiran Paranjape has newly started a service to translate names/texts at http://freetranslationblog.blogspot.com/.\n\nHere are simple meanings of common English words.\n\nAir vaayuH (more as a wind as this word indicates motion) Awakening jaagaraNa, prabodhana(spiritual level) Balance sa.ntulana Calm shaanta, prashaanta Cleansing shodhana, paavanam (purification), marjanam Death mR^ityu Elements bhUtAni, dhaatavaH Enthusiasm utsaaha Fate bhAgya, daivagati, karma Freedom svaatantrya, svatantrataa Global saarva-bhauma Happiness aana.nda Harmony sa.nj~naati, sa.nj~naana Health aarogya Heart hR^idaya Innovation nuutana Life jiivanaM, jIvitaM, praaNadhaaraNaM Love prema, anuraaga Ocean saagaraH, samudraH Pain duHkha Peace shaamya, shaanti Power shakti Pure shuddha Quality uttamatvam Solutions kShipti Respect aadara Sea saagaraH, samudraH Serenity prasannataa Smart medhaa, paTu Spirit aatmaa Star nakShatraM, taara Strength bala Tranquility shaantataa Trust vishvaasa Truth satya Vitality viirya\n\nThere are of course different shades to each word so we request you to see Sanskrit dictionaries and links available on this site.\n\nLouis Bontes' dictionary utility for Monier William's digitized dictionary at Cologne is available at http://members.ams.chello.nl/l.bontes/.\n\nInstead of directly translating the phrase \"God Bless You\" word by word, this is how it is conveyed.\n\nshubhaM bhuuyaat.h | ma~NgalaM bhuuyaat.h | svasti |\n\nbhuuyaat is let there be, shubhaM or ma.ngalaM is for auspiciousness or wellbeing. Basically the message projected is that \"let good things come to you.\" About the good things, here is a prayer from Yajurveda\n\n[tachchakShurdevahitaM purastaachChukramuchcharat]\n\npashyema sharadashshataM\n\njiivema sharadashshataM\n\nnandAma sharadashshataM\n\nmodAma sharadashshataM\n\nbhavAma sharadashshataM\n\nshR^iNavAma sharadashshataM\n\nprabravAma sharadashshatamajiitaassyAma sharadashshataM\n\njyokcha sUryaM dR^ishe\n\n[That celestial eye of the gods, the sun, is rising up brightly before us.]\n\nMay we behold him (the sun) for a hundred autumns.\n\nMay we live for a hundred autumns.\n\nMay we make merry for a hundred autumns.\n\nMay we rejoice for a hundred autumns.\n\nMay we become (better and better) for a hundred autumns.\n\nMay we listen (to godly discourse) for a hundred autumns.\n\nMay we speak well for a hundred autumns.\n\nMay we never feel wretched and helpless during hundred autumns.\n\nMay we be able to behold the sun for a long, long time.\n\nFrom Krishna Yajurveda : Taittiriya Aranyaka IV-42:5:93\n\n\"Live Strong\" phrase indicating mental strength can be paraphrased as \"dhairyeNa jijiiviShet.h |\" To translate, \"have a desire to live with courage.\" jijIviSha is transalted (MW) as desire to live. dhairya as firmness, constancy, calmness, patience, gravity , fortitude, courage.\n\n\"Mother, you are forever missed and never to be forgotten!\"\n\nutkaNThitaH anantakaalam he maataH\n\nna kadaapi vismaraNiiyaa tvam cha || for \"you are forever missed (actually, I miss you forever), Mother, and never to be forgotten!\" As an alternative:\n\nvirahavyaakulo maatar vismR^itirna kadaapi te ||\n\nvirahavyaakulaa maatar vismR^itirna kadaapi te ||\n\nThe first is for a man, second for a woman.\n\nHere are translations of two blessings:\n\nparipuurNatayaa jiivet.h . ##live life to the full##\n\nor\n\nhR^idyam anugachchhet.h .\n\nhR^idaya~Ngama anugachchhet.h . ##follow your heart##\n\nHere is another phrase:\n\nnaahaM nidhanabhayavyaakulaH |\n\nnaahaM vyathaaghaatavichchhedyaH |\n\njiivitametanmama prekShaNiiyam ||\n\n\"Death cannot shake me, pain will not break me,\n\nthis life is mine to behold.\"\n\nWith sandhi-vigraha it is\n\nna aham nidhana\\-bhaya\\-vyaakulaH |\n\nna aham vyathaa\\-aaghaata\\-vichchhedyaH |\n\njiivitam etad mama prekShaNiiyam ||\n\nAnother translation for the same phrase is\n\nmR^ityurna shaknoti kShobhayituM maaM\n\nna cha vyathaa maaM vibhagnaM karoti .\n\nsamiikShituM jiivamidaM cha lokaM\n\narhamyahaM na tu vR^ithaa matirme ..\n\nUse webinterface to see the Sanskrit portion (of phrases above or below) in Devanagari script. Itranslator99 or newer Itranslator2003 will be even better. Also consult Sanskrit dictionary at Cologne linked from https://sanskritdocuments.org/dict/ for word meaning details.\n\nLook at another one:\n\nmama dehaH khalu ma.ndiraM | mama ##= mine;## dehaH ##= body## khalu ##= truly, certainly, surely## ma.ndiraM ##= temple## deho me ma.ndiraM saaxaat.h hR^inme devashcha tatsthitaH | ##Body is verily a temple.

A simple search on internet will return many sites with meaning, sound clip, and interpretation. For example, see Dharma Heaven site.\n\nWe are also faced with difficulty with some requests where a reverse translation is sought. The request for translation is easy to make but one has to understand the context and the origin of thoughts. For example, a translation of words related to Buddha's eightfold path was requested to which a quick response based on just the words alone would be,\n\nVision ## dR^iShTii\n\n## Emotion ## bhaavanaa\n\n## Speech ## vaachaa\n\n## Action ## karman\n\n## Awareness ## avadhaana\n\n## Effort ## prayatna\n\n## Livelihood ## upajiivana\n\n## Concentration ## ekaagrataa\n\nThe reverse translation is not unique, given the richness of the language. It will turn out to be inadequate when Buddha's teaching is studied. In comparison, refer to the article in Wikipedia on Buddhism. See also reference in a dictionary.\n\nSomeone wanted the etymological root of the name of the mountain \"Kailas\" (kailAsha in Hindi).\n\nFrom Amarakosha commentary\n\n1. kelaasa=sphaTika (crystal) - derivation: ke = jale laasaH = lasanaM asya -> kelaasaH (one that shines in water = crystal) made of/formed with kelaasa is kailaasa\n\n2. keliinaaM samuuhaH = kailaM tena aasyate atra aasa upaveshane - a place where you play around (could be a great name for an amusement park !!!)\n\nThe place is reported as belonging to kubera, even though Shiva lives there.\n\nOne questioner asked to translate \"Software Engineer\" in Sanskrit. The words praNaalii\\-praj~na may be suitable. This is in view of the fact that praNaalii is sometimes used as a synonym for a program - sequence of instructions. One possible objection is that the word might refer more to a software expert rather than an engineer, but an engineer better be an expert, shouldn't (s)he? If preferred, you may replace the praj~na by abhiyantaa - the official word for engineer, making a praNaalyabhiyantaa, but it does not sound so good (:-))\n\nAlso, for a \"simulation,\" pratibhaasana as an equivalent to simulation. It is proposed that the root prati+bhaas be used for simulate. The word pratibhaasana does have a meaning of look, appearance, illusion. It might be appropriate to attach this additional meaning to it. Along the same lines, anu+bhaas can be used for modeling, if needed. Alternatively, chhadma = simulation. In some contexts vyapadesha may apply.\n\nThere are large books published by Government of India on the glossary of terms in Sanskrit translated from the newer English words. The Government of India has set-up a \"Commission of Scientific and Technical Terminology\" that publishes IT terminologies and technical and scientific terminologies in Hindi.

Janaki, Spoken Sanskrit, Madras 1990, ISBN 81-85170-04-5\n\nThe book by Janaki is of higher quality than the one by Krishnamurthy. In the book of Janaki, you will find a lot of Sanskrit dialogues on modern topics such as movies, newpapers, office, politics etc. and you will even find a dialog about the tennis matches of J.Connors, B.Borg, J.McEnroe etc. etc. The interesting (and scholary) aspect of this book by Janaki is the fact that new vocabulary is divided into \"derived\" (from ancient texts) and \"coined\" (as Neo-Sanskrit), so that you can see what is attestable and what is an invention.\n\nThe most modern Neo-Sanskrit words are found in the comparatively new German-Sanskrit dictionary by Mylius, first published in 1988. Here you will find Sanskrit words for many things never used by the ancient people in India, e.g. Sanskrit words for \"telephone\" etc.\"\"\" Ulrich\n\nOne person asked for a message translation for his girlfriend who is supposed to be well versed in Sanskrit\n\nTo my dearest friend, You have touched my life in a way that I cannot express.

It is not enough just to wish to promote such activities, or talk about India's glorious past, but must be followed by involvement at many levels.\n\nFor lack of time, some prefer to promote activities by contributing money.

There is no \"per hit benefit\" invoked. What we have on the site is miniscule compared with the available Sanskrit texts elsewhere and mentioned/linked in the scannedbooks page. We have only tried to place popular texts/stotras for everyone's user, searchable and printable. We try to avoid gathering texts only because they are available somewhere else or entering only because they have not been placed by someone online. There is unending treasure out there, and beneficial too, only if you maintain yourself to take reasonably that \"Alibaba\" in all of us allows!\n\nLet us first know what you want and what you are using it for.\n\nIt is the contribution of volunteers that we value and would like to maintain that voluntary spirit. They have spent their time and energy mainly for the satisfaction of sharing. In our encoded document text files and unicode files, we try to give sources of the texts, whenver possible, (mainly old books, out of copyrights and/or sites with permission) and those who help in entering and proofreading with their permission. Your large-scale copying for your own promotion will be a disrespect to such volunteers.\n\nThere are some articles we came across that may help for proper understanding of the issue. 1) Web content plagiarism, 2) an appeal from Kamakotimandali, 3) copying illegal or unethical.\n\nWe have set up a page on the topic of Copying Problems faced by Sanskrit Documents announcing the misuse by certain sites.\n\nWe rely on the conscience of individuals who are using the contents of the site.

Here ar some of the sites that are busy developing the required tools.\n\nThe Sanskrit Research Institute (SRI) at https://sri.auroville.org/about/ has a good interface for Online OCR. One just needs to upload or copy-paste an image in the slate provided. It handles only one image at a time.\n\nGoggle spearheaded the OCR project as Tesseract to provide OCR features in 200 languages! Get the details from Convert PDF and photo files to text and http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/05/paper-to-digital-in-200-languages.html. See additional information, Google form posting mentions about a new OCR using tesseract-ocr-setup and gimagereader that is applicable for Hindi OCR. It will need modification to handle conjunts in Sanskrit. See also details of the tesseract-ocr project. Make use of the procedure given in ocr-using-tesseract-hindi-image-to-text-example on technovechno.com site. Specifically, login to your google drive, upload the pdf upto 20 pages and open it using Google docs. The recognized text will appear in the .doc file generated.

What is more: The Unicode Standard 4.0 expressly excludes Vedic characters as stated in above quotation.\n\nQuestion: If there are more than one Unicode fonts in your fonts system, is there any way to select one of your choice?\n\nWeb browsers have a setting that says which font to use for which encoding. Firefox has ability to have different font for each language, in each encoding. Go to Tools -> Options -> Content, click on Advanced, and in there, for example, you can choose the encoding (Unicode in this case), and then the language (\"Devanagari\"), and select the correct Unicode font you want.\n\nIn Internet Explorer, you can use Tools -> Internet Options, General tab, click on Font, and then select Language Script and font as needed.\n\nThese techniques apply only when no font is defined in the web page - if the web page specifies \"Arial Unicode MS\", then that setting will always (most of the time!) be used...\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: I would like to get a list of links of everything related to India?\n\nEmotions apart, this is a too general request and the best way is to use the many search-engines available on the Internet. http://education.vsnl.com/ has a fascinating index of links to organizations from India.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: I would like to attend camps to learn Sanskrit--where may I find information on these camps?\n\nSanskrit Bharati organizes such camps, correspondence courses, intensive conversational courses and publishes related documents.

It is easy to get carried away in the talk of \"glorious vedic past\" than implement the ideas in present conditions. There is a danger in \"promoting\" superficial understanding of our ancestors, how they lived, and the thoughts they carried out through verbal and written exchanges. Words convey ideas so if the ideas, which are written in Sanskrit, are conveyed, the words would come automatically, or need not be followed. If it promotes healthy transformation then it is acceptable and nurturing to individuals, but most of the time the zeal degenerates into mere outwardly \"conversion\" process.\n\nThe vocabulary has its own dynamism and has to follow its own course of assimilation into languages. So if the 2001 words are followed or portrayed with 2001 ideas with extended meanings, it will be a revolutionary undertaking. It will then be easier to circulate for others to judge.\n\nAs a reference, let us begin with a list with existing English words which can be identified to originate from Sanskrit. We will polish the list later with your input:\n\nkarma; guruu; pundita; yoga; raajaa; aarya; svastika; raaj (from raajya but raaj in hindi); dharma; jungle (from ja.ngala); buddha (although many mistakenly pronounce it as buDDhaa which in Hindi is a very old person!); nirvaaNa; juggernaut (jagganath).\n\nRefer to two 1, 2) articles titled \"Guru in English\" by Saurin Desai on the influence of Sanskrit on English. He elaborates on the Sanskrit words which are commonly used in English: Mandala, Svastika, Guru, Yoga, Dharma, Arya, Ashram, Pundit, Kamasutra, Nirvana, Avatar, Mantra, Chakras, Singapore, Mandarin, Musk, Juggernaut, Cheetah, Bandana, Chintz, Loot et cetera.\n\nThe words mentioned above are what are called \"loaned\" words. Some others are \"obliquely\" related and we will need help from etymologists: mind to mana, man to manu, father to pitR^i, mother to maatR^i, brother to bhraatR^i, riti to ritual, ambrosia to amR^ita, three to tri, sept in september to sapta, oct to octa or ashhTa, dec in december deca to dasha (some scholars relate the months starting from March as original first month related to Vernal Equinox or Jyotish calendar with first month chaitra being in March. With this start, the 7th month is September, eighth is October, tenth is December et cetera. The current popular calendar, termed as Christian, changed the sequence, however), sugar to sharkaraa, medium ro madhyam, and so on.\n\nRead articles on Sanskrit Puns by Richard Stoney (or here) of Orleans, CA. Some of the articles include \"Sambacus, Etymology and Ethnobotany,\" \"Gulliver's Travels and its Sanskrit Puns,\" \"Sources of the Word Yahoo,\" \"English Words derived from Sanskrit,\" \"Hindu Linguistical Influence in Northern Europe: 1200-1600\" and more. Also available is A theory that some English words are actually Sanskrit-like and English Words You Speak from Sanskrit.\n\nAs Latin is closely related to Sanskrit, English words originated from Latin may find a \"cousin\" in Sanskrit.\n\nThe following sites are useful:\n\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/ma/vivekananda/sanscrit.html or its mirror http://sanskrit.onweb.cx/\n\nhttp://www.consultsos.com/pandora/intro.htm\n\nhttp://www.takeourword.com/.

See www.gnu.org for the details. Otherwise the Itrans processor with LaTeX is portable to Unix/Linux and one can generate displays in postscript/PDF formats.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: Why don't you provide English translations of the Sanskrit Documents?\n\nSome of the documents carry translations in English. Most of these are provided by volunteers. We have also provided links to different sites where such translations are available, keeping us away from copyright issues. We do not encourage encoding \"copyrighted\" translations from printed books published by various religious organizations and publishing houses. They have done commendable work and our intention is only to provide the texts in Devanagari format with provision to do word searches from the encoded material.\n\nFor your information, there is an excellent discussion available on the Indology site about \"myths of copyright\".\n\nPlease see the following sites for translations of some of the documents. Investindia.com appears to be discontinued.\n\nAnanta Yoga site.\n\nSanskrit classical literature translated by Desiraju Hanumanta Rao.

If you viewed or copied/pasted the XDVNG display output in Word, you need the XDVNG font, which is available in https://sanskritdocuments.org/processing_tools/. Download the xdvng.ttf font file and save it in your c:\\windows\\fonts\\ or such folder and restart the browser. The instructions are elaborated below.\n\nDifferent formats of the files and their viewers are listed in https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_9_formats.html, ,for example, the .pdf file needs Acrobat reader, .ps file needs Ghostview/Ghostscript combination.\n\nYou may like Itranslator which has nicecr fonts and better control for your Word output. You will need to use the encoded portion of ITX/TXT file and treat it as in input in Itranslator. Try it out. The software is available at http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html.\n\nThere are installation instructions for the XDVNG fonts in the procecssing_tools folder.\n\nIn general, to install a true type font on Windows95/98\n\nStart by downloading the .ttf font file to a convenient folder (e.g. download)\n\nNext, select [Start]--[Settings]--[Control Panels] and open the [Fonts] folder by double-clicking it. When the [C:\\Windows \\Fonts] window comes up, click on [File], and click on [Install New Font...]\n\nIn the [Add Fonts] dialog box that will appear, select the drive letter and folder where you placed the truetype font file (.ttf). After a moment the font will appear in the [List of Fonts] window.\n\nClick on it to select it, then Click the [OK] button to install the font. After a moment, the font will be installed in Windows and will be available to any Windows program under the font name.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: Where can I find complete Mahabharata text/verse?\n\nThere are two versions of Mahabharata online. There is one Kumbhagonam edition and another a critical edition of Mahabharatar. The critical edition was originally published by Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) and was encoded by Professor Tokunaga of Japan. It was further edited and processed by Prof. John Smith of UK and Shree Devi Kumar. BORI holds copyright on the text.

I need large size Sanskrit letters.\n\nYou can use following interfaces to generate Devanagari script of your name: web-interface, Vinay Jain's HiTrans on giitaayan.com, Sanscript, aksharamukha online tools or install an excellent PC-Windows freeware available at Omkarananda Ashram sites at http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html or Baraha is another non-Itrans based software tool. See others listed on this page. These software allow to write Devanagari letters with control over the letter size and have well devloped publishing quality fonts. It is also very easy to install them. Many fine artists and tattoo artists have used these, although for a Sanskrit student this practice appears odd.\n\nFor offline use to generate Devanagari text (Marathi Hindi Sanskrit), try https://nityin.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/google-offline-typing-tool-for-indian-languages/ http://www.vishalon.net/Download.aspx http://innolea.com/transliteration-typing-tools-for-hindi-regional-indian-languages/6766\n\nUbuntu-Linux has IBUS suitable to edit texts offline in various Indic fonts. Here are instructions to install and use it\n\nInstall ibus-m17n from the Software Center.\n\nAdd language(s) from the Settings - eg Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi (and 50+) - + choice of devanagari, itrans, IAST, HK, phonetic\n\nLog out, and Re-log in.\n\nOpen any editor - eg gedit, Libre Office Writer.\n\nChoose Input from the drop-down language icon in Menu bar\n\nPress Control+Space, and type after choosing font, etc.\n\nGoogle Input Tools for Windows is currently available for 22 different languages: Amharic, Arabic, Bengali, Persian, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Russian, Sanskrit, Serbian, Sinhala, Tamil, Telugu, Tigrinya and Urdu. (June 2015) More than one language of input tools can be installed on the same client machine.\n\nThere are commercial sites performing tattoo design with Sanskrit Devanagari script for a fee, such as Scott Jones' Tattoo by design in UK or Jaydeep's onlinetattootranslations in Chennai, India, or Vince Hemingson's vanishingtattoo, Vivek Kumar's 2indya.com et cetera. Kiran's freetranslationblog is also available for free translation of words/sentences and follows a voluntary spirit. All consider different languages and art forms. http://www.sanskrittattoo.info/ is very informative site and has many examples listed. There are other sites to mention : authenticsanskrittattoos.com, Sanskrit Tattoos at at pinterest, 1, 2, 3, 4, Saad's gallery, Spiritual and Sanskrit Tattoos, spiritual-tattoos, et cetera.\n\nThere are various opinions about tattooing. The discussion about tattooing with Devanagari script came in sharp focus due to the tattoo of David Beckham's wife's name Victoria. Phonetically, the tattoo is correct, unless Britishers pronounce Vi as in \"we\". The distinction in the sound \"we\" (wicket, wicked, wish) should be made with \"v\" (vindicate, vital, viscous, similar to wheat, white). (In contrast, \"ve\" in Veda is pronounced and written as \"way\" and not \"ve\" as in vendetta.) Listen to an audio of the name Victoria and see the pronunciation guide. The discussion about its incorrectness at different sites such as beckham-magazine or audarya is out of ignorance and mainly because many Hindi speakers refuse to accept the conjunct w+h as v in their pronunciation. It is true that there is no word in Hindi staring with the conjunct, but Devanagari script, with its phonetic base, is much more powerful and allows pronunciations more than that of a Hindi speaker.\n\nThe discussion apart, we would like you to be more aware of the art form, and to express yourself and your image through a tattoo. See the sites for example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, et cetera. The question as why Devanagari tattoo (which is mostly meant as tattooed text in Devanagari script not Sanskrit, as Sanskrit or Hindi is a language and not a script)\n\nPlease consider the pros and cons of your choice for a tattoo as it is hard to erase. See a site. Read 5 things to check. There is a Sanskrit tattoo artist reference with name, site, and contact information. Here is a list of Common Errors.\n\nOne infamous example of how a less knowledgeable person can cause problem can be seen at Wrong Sanskrit Tattoos. Marcos Carvalho, who knows little Sanskrit, in fact almost does not know it but sells Sanskrit translations. A friend, also from Brazil, commented, \"He is not exactly a good guy... Thanks to him there are lots of people here showing mispelled sanskrit phrases or names on their bodies.\"\n\nThe Sanskrit word meanings are not unique and it depends on the context, e.g. love, peace may mean different to different people. The translator may have his flaws in providing the translation. World peace is also a fiction or a belief.\n\nUnderstanding the real purpose of what you want to do will help.\n\nWe hope that the tattoo in Devanagari will lead you to learn Sanskrit and study its literature as well.\n\nPlease let us know links, information, and details of additional tools you have come across by writing to (sanskrit at cheerful dot c om).\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: Are there Android and Apple iSO applications (Apps) for learning Sanskrit?\n\nThere are plenty of well prepared applications for learning Sanskrit.

If it is not, select it. You may have to check it each time that the characters get displayed wrongly!\n\nSome of the .html files are coded with .pfr portion which does not require such menu selection, but we have found that on some computers it does not work. The menu selection is hence reliable method.\n\nMany ask us about the keyboard map of the XDVNG font. We do not have keyboard layout for XDVNG since the text is not directly entered using the fonts. Search the elemental typefaces which resembles the character map of the font. Character map is Windows feature and is often executed with [Start]/[Run] and type charmap. If this does not activate it, you will need to install it from Windows installation CD.\n\nFor those keen on using Internet explorer, may find that the html/XDVNG text displays improperly. The displayed texts show blank spaces arbitrarily and gets harder to read. Ulrich Stiehl has modified the original Xdvng.ttf font to take care of font display bugs of Microsoft's faulty Internet Explorer 5.5, 6.0 inserting \"random spaces\" into html files. The modified fonts are available in ht processing_tools_fonts section. The changes are not uniformly applied to all the files and reader is requested to download and edit the html file with XDVNG letters changed to XDVNGmod and redisplay. The new Xdvng font versions are not needed for other browsers, as the \"random spaces\" bug is specific to Internet Explorer, but it does not harm to use the new Xdvng fonts with other browsers.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: Why don't you include Kannada Tamil, Telugu documents on your site in the other languages category?

Could you provide a list?\n\nPlease see a comprehensive list of projects. We also have made a list of pending items to help volunteers choose from our immediate needs. Please email us at sanskrit@cheerful.com to ask for the status of these projects if you are willing to pursue one. We have been successful in finding only handful of volunteers who have committed to a project on long term basis. We hope that you will have time and interest to look into this list carefully and will consider participating. If you are serious about volunteering, we recommend that you copy the form and send us the information over email. Additional help is available here.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: Why are there so many types of display formats?\n\nWhat do the ITX, PS, PDF acronyms mean?\n\nHow should I view the Sanskrit documents?\n\nThe purpose of various formats is to allow viewers from different computer platforms and browsers to see Devanagari text. A list of formats, their explanation, and links to viewers is give here. To have complete capability to view documents in any format, we suggest that you install\n\nItranslator99 or newer Itranslator2003. This is to view encoded text files, marked ITX or TXT. ITX files are used as input to Itrans processor to generate Devanagari documents.\n\nGhostscript and Ghostview postscript viewer from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html. Download and install gs601w32.exe and gsv31w32.exe from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/get601.html Depending on the version, please modify the numbers 601 and 31 in these links. These will allow you to get a good display as well as a sharp printout. Get XDVNG fonts to view HTML display documents.\n\nAcrobat Reader to view documents in PDF format.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ: What is the Itrans scheme and how is it different than Itrans or Itranslator software?\n\nHow do you get files in different formats once the text is encoded in Itrans scheme?\n\nItrans or ITRANS is a freeware program developed by Avinash Chopde, initially to fulfill wishes of Hindi songs enthusiasts to exchange Hindi songs over email (ASCII) and have them processed to display in Devanagari script on any browser. It subsequently encompassed other language scripts as suitable fonts were freely available. It is mainly a processor which takes help of TeX/LaTeX capabilities to generate postscript files as display.\n\nThe scheme used to enter the Devanagari or other scripts is known as Itrans scheme. A sample table is given here. Please see a concise table showing ITRANS encoding for all supported languages and fonts or documents with detailed transliteration map for each language separately from Avinash Chopde's ITRANS site.\n\nAvinash has also built a PC based commercial software in collaboration with Shreekrishna Patil. Mr. Patil, a wirey-firey 80+ aged youth, has prepared fonts for almost all language scripts from India.\n\nRecently, two devoted Swami-s (monks) of Omkarananda Ashram of Rishikesh, India, developed a PC based freeware to generate WYSIWYG text in Devanagari using the same input scheme. The software is known as Itranslator99 or newer Itranslator2003 and is available at Omkarananda Ashram sites http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html, http://www.geocities.com/omkarananda/ or http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html and is an excellent addition if you have a PC with Windows.\n\nComing to the question of preparing documents from ASCII text, A file with extension .txt, having the encoded text, is prepared with first two lines for English and Devanagari titles, and ## to complete Devanagari mode. The text is subsequently passed through the following process.\n\n.txt -----> .itx -----> .tex -----> .dvi -----> .ps -----> .gif | ^ ^ ^ |----> .pdf .inf -+ | | | PSTOGIF .hdr -+ | | | PSTOPDF | | | ITRANS LATEX DVIPS\n\nVolunteers who enter the text in .txt file either using any editor or Itranslator editor are requested to proofread the document using postscript file.\n\nAlthough the above process generates displayable documents for on-line purpose, the output is not useful for Windows/MS Word based programs. The output from Itranslator however can be cut and pasted in MSWord or so to reformat the display.\n\nCouple of popular online conversion tools for many Indian language scripts are http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript/ Sanscript and https://aksharamukha.appspot.com/ Aksharamukha.\n\nFor offline use to generate Devanagari text (Marathi Hindi Sanskrit), try https://nityin.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/google-offline-typing-tool-for-indian-languages/ http://www.vishalon.net/Download.aspx http://innolea.com/transliteration-typing-tools-for-hindi-regional-indian-languages/6766\n\nThere are other options available at Sparshabhumi site under the category Devanagari & other languages scripts.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nQ.
