Lane College is a private, Christian Methodist Episcopal, historically black college in Jackson, Tennessee.

Background

In 1882, the Colored Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church—now known as the Christian Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church—founded what would be called the CME High School. After the appointment of Bishop Isaac Lane who presided over the Tennessee Conference in 1879, Bishop Lane met with the CME denomination’s Tennessee Annual Conference committee to help formulate the school. Bishop Lane also purchased the first four acres of land to be used for the new school, located in the eastern part of Jackson, Tennessee.

The CME High School began its first school session on November 12, 1882, before the school’s name changed to the Lane Institute in 1884 to acknowledge Bishop Lane’s work in establishing the school. Twelve years later, the college department of Lane would be established in 1896, with the Board of Trustees voting to change the name from Lane Institute to Lane College. Lane was approved by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools (SACS), as well as full membership admittance to SACS by December of 1961.

Since then, Lane College has undergone a series of construction projects, significant growth in enrollment, an increase in faculty strength, expanded curricula, and greater financial stability that lends to Lane’s ability to promote student success.
