Lane College celebrated its Founder's Day and scholarship dinner on Sunday at the J.F. Lane Health Building on campus. The college was celebrating 140 years of existence, dedication and sacrifice.

Bishop Isaac Lane, the son of a plantation owner and slave, started the college in 1882 for freedmen to receive an education that would allow them to change the world and their circumstances.

Lane was also the founder of the Methodist church. The church was started by 41 freedmen who were instrumental in developing Methodist churches throughout Madison County and West Tennessee.

Lane College, a private historically Black college, is associated with the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in Jackson. It serves over 2,200 students and offers associate and bachelor's degrees in the arts and sciences.

Sponsors and attendees filled the gym on Sunday to show respect to the school and its founder\. A special musical performance was rendered by Donnie McClurkin, a Grammy-award winning artist and the Lane College Concert Choir.

Lane College has had many successful students who attended the college and flourished even the more since attending.

"Thank you Lane College," said senior Demetris Johnson, vice-president of the Student Government Association. "Thank you for investing in my future."

Johnson is also a city councilman for Ward 2 in Earle Arkansas and was very appreciative for the knowledge instilled in him.

Jackson Mayor Scott Conger is a 2008 graduate of the Lane College and the first Dragon alum to be elected as Jackson's mayor.

"Lane helped me get to where I needed to be," said Conger. "I played football and worked on campus for four years. Now, I am the mayor of the city."

Success stories from students resonate through the Hub City and all around the world. Lane College is committed to transforming lives, liberating minds and celebrating excellence in Christ.
