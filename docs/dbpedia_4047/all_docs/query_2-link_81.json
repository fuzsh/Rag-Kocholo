        "text": "Free College – Top 3 Pros and Cons\n\nPro/Con Arguments | Discussion Questions | Take Action | Sources | More Debates\n\nFree college programs come in different forms but generally refer to the government picking up the tab for tuition costs, while students pay for other expenses such as room and board.\n\n32 states and DC have some variation of free college programs. 9 states have statewide programs with “few eligibility limits,” while 23 have “[s]tate sponsored free college tuition programs with income, merit, geographical or programmatic limitations.” 18 states have no free college programs.\n\nTuition at public four-year institutions rose more than 31% between 2010 and 2020. When adjusted for inflation, college tuition has risen 747.8% since 1963. The average student loan debt more than doubled from the 1990s to the 2010s, according to the US Department of Education. About 16.8 million undergraduate students were projected to be enrolled in college in 2022, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nCollege tuition is set by state policy or by each individual institution. Some colleges, especially federal land grant schools, had free tuition beginning in the 1860s. And some states had tuition-free policies at state colleges and universities for in-state students well into the twentieth century. According to Ronald Gordon Ehrenberg, Professor at Cornell University, “Public colleges and universities were often free at their founding in the United States, but over time, as public support was reduced or not increased sufficiently to compensate for their growth in students and costs (faculty and staff salaries, utilities etc.), they moved first to a low tuition and eventually higher tuition policy. About 2.9% of American 18- to 24-year olds went to college for the 1909-1910 school year, compared to 40% in 2020.\n\nAt the national level, free college programs have been in effect for military personnel since the 1944 GI Bill. At least 26 other countries have free or nearly free college tuition: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Kenya, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Panama, Poland, Scotland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and Uruguay.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Education Next Survey of Public Opinion, 63% of Americans supported free 4-year college and 66% supported free 2-year college.\n\nShould Public College Be Tuition-Free?\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\n1. Should college tuition be free? For which colleges/universities? Explain your answers.\n\n2. Brainstorm potential pros and cons of free college for individual students.\n\n3. How would free college benefit (or disadvantage) college communities? Explain your answer(s).\n\nTake Action\n\n1. Analyze the goals of the Campaign for Free College Tuition.\n\n2. Explore US News’ list of 16 colleges that do not charge tuition.\n\n3. Consider Michael Poliakoff’s position that free college could raise tuition costs.\n\n4. Consider how you felt about the issue before reading this article. After reading the pros and cons on this topic, has your thinking changed? If so, how? List two to three ways. If your thoughts have not changed, list two to three ways your better understanding of the “other side of the issue” now helps you better argue your position.\n\n5. Push for the position and policies you support by writing US national senators and representatives.\n\nSources\n\n1.Michelle Singletary, “U.S. Student Loan Debt Reaches a Staggering $1.53 Trillion,” washingtonpost.com, Oct. 3, 2018 2.Zack Friedman, “Student Loan Debt Statistics in 2018: A $1.5 Trillion Crisis,” forbes.com, June 13, 2018 3.Institute of Education Science, “Fast Facts: Back to School Statistics,” nces.gov (accessed Mar. 8, 2019) 4.Emmie Martin, “Here’s How Much More Expensive It Is for You to Go to College Than It Was for Your Parents,” cnbc.com, Nov. 29, 2017 5.Dan Caplinger, “Rising Cost of College Creating a Financial Hole for Parents, Students: Foolish Take,” usatoday.com, June 9, 2018 6.Harlan Green, “What Happened to Tuition-Free College?,” huffingtonpost.com, June 1, 2016 7.History Channel, “G.I.
