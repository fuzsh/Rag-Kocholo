        "text": "Rayford Albright (Lane College)\n\nBorn: July 3, 1995\n\nFirst Year in College: 2015–16\n\nNumber of Schools: 5 (Dyersburg State Community College, Southeastern Community College, Talladega College, Martin Methodist College, Lane College)\n\nStats: N/A\n\n“Years in college” was the benchmark used in the DI version of this article, but it quickly became apparent that kind of linear definition would not work for long-time college athletes outside the DI ranks.\n\nNo player embodies what this list is about more than Lane College guard Rayford Albright. Albright has played basketball at five different colleges. He has online profiles for three of them, and none of these profiles contain any more information than his height (5–10), weight (165 pounds circa 2017), and hometown (Memphis, TN).\n\nThis is what we know: Rayford Albright is a 28-year-old senior for the Lane College Dragons in Jackson, TN. He graduated high school in 2014(!) and was recruited by the likes of Memphis Tigers head coach Josh Pastner. From there, he took a year off before spending a season at Dyersburg State Community College, where he earned First Team All-Tennessee Community College Atheltic Association honors for the 2015–16 campaign.\n\nHe spent the next year at Southeastern Community College in Burlington, IA, averaging 15.2 PPG. He then played the following season at NAIA school Talladega College before transferring to NAIA Martin Methodist (now known as University of Tennesse Southern) for 2018–19.\n\nOrdinarily, that would be the end of it. Albright returned to Manassas HS in Memphis as a basketball coach and teacher. But then, in May 2023, Albright found another year of eligibility and announced he was joining Lane College — a DII school in Jackson, TN — for the 2023–24 season.\n\nAnd that is how we have a 28-year-old senior playing for his fifth college basketball team nine years after he graduated high school.\n\nTerrence Ward (Park University Gilbert)\n\nBorn: August 7, 1996\n\nFirst Year in College: 2016–17\n\nNumber of Schools: 4 (Iowa Western Community College, Northern Virginia Community College, Garrett College, Park University Gilbert)\n\n2021–22 Stats (Garrett): 6.1 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 2.2 APG, 2.7 steals+blocks per game\n\nOnce a solid JUCO product, Virginia native Terrence Ward has been defined by injuries rather than his play on the court, as the 27-year-old is looking to play his first complete season of college basketball since 2016–17.\n\nWard, A 2015 high school graduate from Dumfries, VA, spent a post-grad year at Hargrave Military Academy. Next year, the guard played 30 games for Iowa Western CC. That would be his last significant contribution at the collegiate level until 2021–22.\n\nWard’s status for the next two years is unclear. He was at Cape Fear CC (NC) and appears in scrimmage film but is not listed on any rosters or statsheets (possibly redshirting due to injuries).\n\nHe transferred to Northeast Virginia CC in 19–20 and played just two games for the Nighthawks. After sitting out the following year, Ward was finally able to play significant minutes for Garrett (MD), averaging 6.1 PPG across 19 games played while winning a conference title.\n\nWith his community college eligibility over, Ward sat out another season as a transfer before finally seeing the floor for Park University Gilbert (AZ). Still just a redshirt junior, Terrence Ward has a serious chance to be the oldest player in college basketball in 2024–25.\n\nO’Bray Rufus (Harris Stowe State)\n\nBorn: January 31, 1997\n\nFirst Year in College: 2017–18\n\nNumber of Schools: 4 (Vance-Granville Community College, Allegany College, Brescia University, Harris Stowe State)\n\n2022–23 Stats: 4.3 PPG, 1.5 RPG, 1.4 APG, 0.9 SPG\n\nBarry “O’Bray” Rufus is another 2015 high school graduate still lacing up at the NAIA level. He spent a post-high school prep year at the Combine Basketball Academy in Charlotte, NC, and then began his collegiate career at Vance-Granville Community College (NC) in 2017–18.\n\nFrom there, he spent two years each at Allegany College (MD) and Brescia (KY), sitting out his first season at both but becoming a key contributor in the second. Since 2022, Rufus has suited up for Harris Stowe State in St. Louis, MO, averaging 19 minutes per game across his two seasons.\n\nTre Morinia (Northern New Mexico)\n\nBorn: March 1, 1997\n\nFirst Year in College: 2017–18\n\nNumber of Schools: (Northern New Mexico, University of the Southwest)\n\nStats: N/A\n\nA distinct pattern is beginning to emerge on this list: spend a few years at community college, filter into society, and then return to college basketball a couple of seasons later for one last shot at glory.\n\nLarry Morinia III, more commonly known as Trey Morinia, graduated from West Mesa High School (NM) in 2015 but did not begin his college basketball journey for another two years (possible military commitment, but nothing concrete). He is listed on the Northern New Mexico roster from 2017–20 but only appeared in a handful of games in the 18–19 campaign.\n\nMorinia transferred to College of the Southwest for the 20–21 season and did not play in a game as the Mustangs went 0–14. The New Mexico native spent two years away from the hardwood before returning to Northern New Mexico for 2023–24, where he shows up as a junior with another season of eligibility.\n\nMathew Wingett (Peru State)\n\nBorn: March 6, 1997\n\nFirst Year in College: 2015–16\n\nNumber of Schools: 2 (Northeast Community College, Peru State)\n\n2022–23 Stats: 1.7 PPG, 0.6 RPG, 0.3 APG, 11 games played\n\nYet another 2015 high school graduate, Mathew Wingett, spent two years at Northeast CC (NE) and signed with Peru State (NAIA) in southeastern Nebraska. But Wingett never played for the Bobcats. He redshirted for the 2017–18 season and was not on the roster the following year.\n\nMeanwhile, his younger brother David Jr. was making his mark in college basketball. David, a 2017 HS grad, spent his freshman season at Memphis in 2018–19, then toiled at South Dakota State for the next three years — playing as many as 25 minutes per game in 2019–20. But after just 112 minutes played in 2021–22, David entered his name in the transfer portal.\n\nA move to another DI program seemed likely. Instead, David returned to Nebraska to sign with the Peru State team his older brother Mathew once suited up for.\n\nTwo months later, Mathew announced his comeback; the two brothers would be teaming up for Peru State. The duo won a Nebraska state title for Winnebago High School in 2015 and was back on the hardwood together as teammates for the first time in seven years. Each had two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nWhen Mathew took the floor against MidAmerica Nazarene on November 26, 2022, it was his first collegiate basketball action in four-and-a-half years. David was the star for the Bobcats, but Mathew was more than content to play a supporting role, totaling 50 minutes played as Peru State reached the Second Round of the NAIA National Championship. They are back for one final season in 2023–24.\n\nChristian Haffner (Upper Iowa)\n\nBorn: March 6, 1997\n\nFirst Year in College: 2015–16\n\nNumber of Schools: 5 (Marquette, Utah State Eastern, Des Moines Area Community College, Saint Martin’s, Upper Iowa)\n\n2022–23 Stats (Saint Martin’s): 5.9 PPG, 1.4 RPG, 0.9 APG, 41.2 3P%\n\nA freshman out of Gresham, WI, Christian Haffner’s basketball career began at Marquette University in 2015–16. The following fall, he received his call from the Church of the Latter-day Saints. Between training and a two-year mission in Barcelona, Spain, Haffner spent the next three years out of college hoops.\n\nHe returned to the court with Utah State Eastern in the JUCO ranks for 2019–20 with full eligibility remaining. After a season in a season in Utah, Haffner experienced his most successful year on the court back in the Midwest. The guard started all 26 games for a Des Moines Area CC team that won the 2021 NJCAA National Championship, shooting 45.4% from three.\n\nHaffner moved up to DII Saint Martin’s in Washington, again making his mark as a sharpshooter. He spent two seasons there and is in his final collegiate season with DII Upper Iowa.\n\n***Special March Update***\n\nJamal Gibson (Southern University at New Orleans)\n\nAge: 26 (Birthday unknown)\n\nFirst Years in College: 2023–24\n\nNumber of Schools: 1 (Southern University at New Orleans)\n\nPrevious Stats: None\n\nEven in the age of COVID years, 26-year-old college basketball players are uncommon. But a 26-year-old freshman winning conference player of the year in his first season of organized hoops?\n\nJust a year ago Jamal Gibson a tattoo artist who never graduated high school. An assistant coach for Southern Univeristy at New Orleans (SUNO) discovered Gibson in a men’s league, and, using NAIA’s looser eligibility rules was able to sign him on at SUNO.\n\nDespite no previous basketball coaching, Gibson set the Knights’ single-season program record for points and rebounds, averaging 21 PPG and 15.8 RPG — the latter being second in NAIA. He was also the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference Player of the Year.\n\nAfter his meteoric rise, Gibson is in the transfer portal. In three games against DI opposition (Northwestern State, New Orleans, and Troy), the 26-year-old averaged 21.3 PPG and 13.7 RPG. Despite his age, Gibson has earned DI interest from Howard, Youngstown State, and even Ole Miss.\n\nWith three years of eligibility remaining, Jamal Gibson’s story is just beginning.\n\nVejas Grazulis (Ferris State)\n\nBorn: July 22, 1997\n\nFirst Years in College: 2015–16\n\nNumber of Schools: 3 (Northern Michigan, Muskegon Community College, Ferris State)\n\n2022–23 Stats: 7.1 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.5 BPG\n\nEight years ago, Vejas Grazulis was a freshman big man who redshirted for the Northern Michigan Wildcats basketball team. The Marquette, MI native never played for his hometown team. In fact, he quit college basketball altogether. For three years, the Lithuanian-born center stocked shelves at a local grocery store while playing hoops on the side — often with his former NMU teammates.\n\nHis former college coach, Bill Sall (who moved on to Calvin College), called Muskegon Community College head coach Jimmy Booth to let Booth know that Grazulis was a talented kid who deserved another shot on the hardwood.\n\nThe big man enrolled at MCC in 2019–20 and proved to be a revelation. Grazulis earned NJCAA Division II Second Team All-American honors in his lone season with MCC, finishing second in NJCAA II in rebounds per game and first in blocks as he led the Jayhawks to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nGrazulis transferred to DII Ferris State for the 20–21 campaign and has been a vital cog in his fourth year with the Bulldogs.\n\nBut perhaps the highlight of his collegiate career has been competing against his brother Marius Grazulis — who is four years his junior and plays center for conference rival Grand Valley State. “It just takes it to a whole new level,” Vejas said. “We’ve been playing against each other our whole lives. And playing on a stage like this is unreal.”\n\nRory Pantophlet (University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma)\n\nBorn: October 24, 1997\n\nFirst Year in College: 2018–19\n\nNumber of Schools: 3 (Tyler Junior College, Troy, University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma)\n\n2021–22 Stats: 9.6 PPG, 8.7 RPG, 0.5 APG, 0.5 BPG\n\nA native of Sint-Maarten, a Dutch principality in the Caribbean, Rory Pantophlet came stateside in high school and then spent a year in prep school. At Tyler Junior College (TX), Pantophlet made his name as a rebounder, averaging nearly a double-double as a sophomore. He transferred to DI Troy, averaging 12.6 rebounds per 36 minutes in limited time on the floor.\n\nPantophlet spent the last three years at Science and Arts (OK), bouncing back from a season-ending injury in 22–23 to lead the team in rebounding this year.\n\nWyatt Lowell (Chaminade)\n\nBorn: December 4, 1997\n\nFirst Year in College: 2018–19\n\nNumber of Schools: 5 (Utah Valley, BYU, Snow College, Portland, Chaminade)\n\n2022–23 Stats (Portland): 3.9 PPG, 1.4 RPG, 0.6 APG, 39.4 3P%\n\nWyatt Lowell — the number one power forward in Arizona in the class of 2016, has been on the move ever since his high school graduation. Lowell served his two-year LDS mission in Minnesota, then returned to earn the 2018–19 WAC Freshman of the Year award at Utah Valley.\n\nFrom there, he transferred to BYU. After sitting out a year, the sharpshooter played seven games for the Cougars before suffering a season-ending injury. Since then, Lowell spent a season each at Snow College (Utah) and Portland before deciding to conclude his career on the sunny beaches of Honolulu with Chaminade.\n\nChannick Nkoma (West Florida)\n\nBorn: December 27, 1997\n\nFirst Year in College: 2019–20\n\nNumber of Schools: 3 (Harcum College, Kutztown, West Florida)\n\n2022–23 Stats: 4.0 PPG, 2.4 RPG, 0.4 APG, 46.7 FG%\n\nWherever Channick Nkoma has played, academic honors have followed him. The native of Gabon was part of the NJCAA All-Academic Team in 2019–20 and also on the National Association of Basketball Coaches Honors Court (an award that gives recognition to collegiate basketball student-athletes who excelled in academics).\n\nOn the court, Nkoma has long been known for his rebounding ability. The 6–8 big man brought down 6.3 rebounds per game as a junior at DII Kutztown (Pennsylvania) in 21–22 and averaged nearly 10 rebounds per 36 minutes with West Florida (also DII) last season.\n\nOther Notable Stories\n\nEskari Carter (Southern Oregon)\n\nBorn: May 20, 1998\n\nFirst Year in College: 2016–17\n\nNumber of Schools: 3 (Tacoma Community College, Warner Pacific, Southern Oregon)\n\n2019–20 Stats (Warner Pacific): 14.0 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.0 APG, 3 games played\n\nLike many players on this list, Eskari Carter has taken the roundabout way to get where he is. But unlike anyone else mentioned already, Carter is the only player with another year of eligibility remaining.\n\nCarter began at Tacoma CC in 2016–17, though his first statistical footprint begins with nine games played for the Titans the following year. He transferred to Warner Pacific (OR), redshirting in the 18–19 campaign and then only playing three games in 19–20 in what we can assume was a medical redshirt year.\n\nThe next time he appeared on a college basketball roster was 22–23 at Southern Oregon (NAIA), but did not play. He finally appeared in a game for the Raiders in November 2023 — four years removed from his last time on the court with Warner Pacific. The Southern Oregon roster lists Carter as a junior, giving him one more season of eligibility.\n\nAkil Vaughn (Baruch College)\n\nBorn: May 4, 1999\n\nFirst Year in College: 2017–18\n\nNumber of Schools: 2 (York College, Baruch College)\n\n2022–23 Stats: 4.6 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 0.9 BPG, 56.8 FG%\n\nA substantial vertical leap is key for any basketball player; few know that more than Akil Vaughn. Vaughn began his collegiate career as a volleyball player at York College in Queens, NY, and the 6–5 native of Guyana led the York team in kills as a freshman. The following fall, Vaughn tried basketball for the first time at age 19 and joined the York team.\n\nHe spent two years in NYC playing both sports. Then, with the 2020–21 seasons canceled, he transferred to nearby Baruch College. Vaughn continued to be a menace in both sports, leading Baruch to conference championships in volleyball in 2022 and 2023 and a league title for basketball in 22–23."
