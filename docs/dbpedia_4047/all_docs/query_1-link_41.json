In fact, we strongly encourage parents to attend and show support for their students. We're covering a LOT of information at orientation, and it really helps to have that extra set of ears and someone to help guide the students through next steps.\n\nThe first year of college can be as big of a transition for parents as it is for students. We have a special program designed specifically for parents where you can have your questions answered, learn more about financial aid, scholarships and student services, and familiarize yourself with campus. The parent and family programs are held on the same dates as the student programs but are mainly facilitated in separate sessions.\n\nThis casual but informative program will give you the opportunity to:\n\nMeet with representatives from academic programs.\n\nDiscover the support services available to students.\n\nTour the campus.\n\nLearn about educational costs.\n\nRegistration\n\nParent and guardian registration is included in the student registration form. There is a fee for parents to attend, but that fee may vary depending on the type of session.\n\nHotel Information\n\nParents and students who are coming from out of town and may need lodging, listed below are a few of our hotels in the area.\n\nHilton Garden Inn Jackson\n\n1324 Vann Dr.\n\nJackson, TN 38305\n\n(731)868-3500\n\n3.9 miles away from Lane College\n\nCourtyard by Marriott\n\n200 Campbell Oaks Dr.\n\nJackson, TN 38305\n\n(731)422-1818\n\n3.1 miles away from Lane College\n\nFairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott\n\n1335 Vann Dr.\n\nJackson, TN 38305\n\n(731)736-4550\n\n4 miles away from Lane College\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nIs New Student Orientation mandatory?\n\nYes, all incoming first-time, transfer, and international students are required to complete orientation.
