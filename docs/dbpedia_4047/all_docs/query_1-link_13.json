        "text": "EUGENE, Ore. — Lane Community College (LCC) has reported a notable surge in enrollment for Fall Term, marking the institution’s fifth consecutive term of growth. Data presented at the LCC Board of Education meeting Wednesday evening highlighted a 10.1% increase in enrollment figures in the fourth week of the term, in comparison to the same period in Fall 2022. The college has observed a consistent rise in student numbers, with a substantial 18% increase in continuing students and a 7% increase of new students year-over-year.\n\nPresident Stephanie Bulger expressed her delight at these figures, attributing the growth to the college's commitment to providing quality education and robust support services. \"The surge in enrollment is a clear indicator of the hard work and dedication of our staff and faculty in supporting our students' educational aspirations,\" Bulger stated.\n\nThe Full-time Equivalent Student (FTE) metric, crucial for state funding, has also seen an 11.3% increase from the previous year. President Bulger remains optimistic about this trend, acknowledging the challenges posed by the pandemic and the college's adaptive strategies to enhance educational delivery.\n\nThe surge in enrollment not only reflects LCC's educational excellence but also brings a positive impact on the institution's financial health. Previously, the college was bracing for multi-million dollar deficits over the next two years. However, the unexpected increase in enrollment has led to a boost in tuition revenue and state funding, surpassing the projections established during the budget's formulation in June. This welcome development signifies a more favorable financial direction for the institution. College leaders are preparing to present a revised budget scenario at the December board meeting, offering a more detailed view of the institution's improved financial standing."
