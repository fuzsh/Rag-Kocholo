Many of these large schools have the capacity to offer more student organizations, which means a wide variety of extracurriculars to choose from. Students are usually offered more AP courses and even dual enrollment opportunities to start earning college credit early. Even online high schools can offer rigorous and competitive academics.\n\nAdditionally, there will be a larger selection of classes, likely because there are more faculty and staff available to teach them. So, in some cases, students may be able to take classes in a more niche subject or interest.\n\nOverall, whether a high school has a few hundred students or a few thousand, their goals are all the same. Teachers and staff want to ensure that students are prepared and well-equipped to make the best decisions about their future post-graduation. Whether they attend a four-year college, enter the workforce, or take a gap year, their high school education will set them up for success in all they do.\n\nYou may also wish to check out the following blogs:"
