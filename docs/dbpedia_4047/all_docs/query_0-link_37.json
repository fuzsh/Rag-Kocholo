        "text": "Thanks to the generous support of the Heckscher Foundation for Children, we have partnered with EdTrust–NY to bring you this important data about advanced course access at each high school.\n\nAll New York City students should have equitable access to key gatekeeper and advanced courses that lead to college and career preparedness. Yet across the city, students who are Black, Latinx, and American Indian, and students from low-income backgrounds, are less likely than their peers to attend schools where advanced courses are offered. And even when they do attend schools that offer these courses, they are less likely to be given access.\n\nExploring this data will help you understand which key advanced courses are offered at each high school, and whether students across different racial groups and income levels have equitable access to those advanced courses. Please see the “learn more” link above the data for important notes about how the data are calculated and displayed.\n\nData notes: The data shows what percent of all students in Grades 9-12 were enrolled in each type of course during one school year. If every student took each course once over the course of 4 years, we would expect to see annual enrollment rates around 25%. If you see annual enrollment rates above 25%, that may mean students are taking more than one course in a given subject over the course of 4 years, for example, Regents-level Physics and AP-level Physics.\n\nIf 0 students were enrolled in a course at this school, that course will display as “not offered” for that year. Students can take more than one course in each category, but enrollment rates are capped at 100%.\n\nComparisons under “By Income” are calculated by subtracting low-income rates from not-low-income rates; any difference larger than 3% is noted as less or more access. Comparisons under “By Race/Ethnicity'' are calculated by subtracting each group’s rate from the All students rate, then adding the absolute differences for a “racial balance” score not shown here. Schools are designated as “far more equal” or “more equal” if they fall in the more balanced quarter or half of schools, respectively, and “less equal” or “far less equal” if they fall in the least balanced half or quarter of schools, respectively.\n\nHow to read the radar graphs under By Race/Ethnicity: look at both the shape and size of the shaded area. If the shaded area is very small, then very few students from any racial/ethnic group have access to that type of course at this school. If the shaded area looks like a circle, then students from all racial/ethnic groups are taking that advanced course at about the same rate. If it has spikes or dips, then students from certain racial groups are taking the course at higher rates than students from other racial/ethnic groups."
