        "text": "High-volume playmaker from a talent-laden private school who put up big numbers as a prep standout. Adequate receiver frame with average height and enough space to add bulk in college. Can line up outside or in the slot. Could provide special teams value in the return game. Shows good run-after-catch ability. Light-footed and agile in the short area. Owns above average long speed. Instinctive receiver who runs to open space. Willing to work the middle. Flashes encouraging high-pointing ability and body control in the red zone. Outstanding production. More than 2,000 receiving yards and 20 TD's in final two high school seasons. Must add bulk and strength to combat Power Five defensive backs. May be more quick than fast. Rounds off routes at times. Will be asked to run a full route tree after getting a ton of touches in the screen game in high school. Faces notable jump in competition going from Texas private school level to P5. Intriguing receiver prospect with the athleticism and instincts to become a Power 5 starter."
