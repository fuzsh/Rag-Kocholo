        "text": "A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who wishes to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. Admission to the second bachelor's program is limited to fall enrollment, and each UC campus has its own policies regarding second baccalaureate applicants.\n\nSecond-baccalaureate-degree applicants currently are considered only by the College of Chemistry for the majors of chemistry and chemical biology only (subject to change for each application filing period). See the check majors page for details.\n\nOffice of Undergraduate Admissions\n\n110 Sproul Hall #5800\n\nBerkeley, CA 94270-5800\n\n(510) 642-3175\n\nadmissions.berkeley.edu\n\nThe College of Engineering considers second-baccalaureate degree applicants only in the majors of Biological Systems Engineering and Materials Science & Engineering. The first degree must be not in engineering, and the applicant must transfer directly from a California community college (CCC); all lower-division selective major criteria must be completed at a CCC prior to transfer. Admission requires the approval of the dean of the College of Engineering and the executive director of Undergraduate Admissions. See the check majors page for more details.\n\nUndergraduate Admissions\n\nWelcome Center\n\n550 Alumni Lane\n\nDavis, CA 95616-8507\n\n(530) 752-2971\n\nadmissions.ucdavis.edu\n\nSecond-baccalaureate degree admission is possible in some academic units. Applications are accepted for fall quarter only. In general, students are selected on a case-by-case basis. Interested candidates should see the check majors page for more details.\n\nOffice of Undergraduate Admissions\n\n260 Aldrich Hall\n\nIrvine, CA 92697-1075\n\n(949) 824-6703\n\nadmissions.uci.edu\n\nLimited status\n\nA limited status applicant — frequently known as a non-degree-seeking student — is held to the same restrictions as applicants pursuing a second B.A. or B.S. degree. Admission will be on an individual basis. There is no guarantee of admission. Currently, only UC Berkeley's College of Chemistry will consider admitting students in limited status."
