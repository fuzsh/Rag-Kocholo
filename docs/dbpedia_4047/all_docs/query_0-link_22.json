        "text": "Rhodes is a national, four-year, private, coeducational, residential college committed to the liberal arts and sciences. Our highest priorities are intellectual engagement, service to others, and honor among ourselves. We enjoy one of the country’s most beautiful campuses in the heart of Memphis, an economic, political, and cultural center, making Rhodes one of a handful of prominent liberal arts colleges located in a major metropolitan area.\n\nThe Rhodes experience combines the best of the classroom and the real world—through internships, service, research, and other opportunities in Memphis and far beyond. Students learn, play, and serve others with a determination to grow personally and to improve the quality of life within their communities.\n\nRhodes has garnered accolades from The Princeton Review for value, internships, community service, and campus beauty; is on U.S. News & World Report's list of 2024 Best Colleges; is on Money magazine's list of Best Colleges; has been named a Top Music Business School by Billboard magazine; cited by Niche for its liberal arts curriculum; is featured in the Fiske Guide to Colleges for strong programs in economics, English, international studies, history, chemistry, business, biology, and psychology; is identified by Stacker as a best college in a big city and Forbes magazine as a top college in the country; and designated by the Fulbright Program as a top producer of U.S. scholars and students studying and working abroad.\n\nRhodes is also one of 50 colleges included in both editions of The Princeton Review’s list of “Colleges That Create Futures” and continues to be included in each new edition of Colleges That Pay You Back: The 200 Schools That Give You the Best Bang for Your Buck."
