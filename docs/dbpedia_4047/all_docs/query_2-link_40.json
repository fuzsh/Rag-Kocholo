Academic transfer courses are classes such as English, history, psychology, mathematics, or sciences for students who plan to obtain a degree. Career-Technical courses offer students an opportunity to get ahead in their education by taking courses to obtain a skill, such as welding, drafting, automotive repair, criminal justice, medical assisting, air conditioning & refrigeration, industrial systems technology, or masonry.\n\nTuition at WCC is also significantly less than tuition at a four-year institution, and scholarships for Dual Enrollment may be available!\n\nFor additional information, please see the Dual Enrollment page.\n\nStudents returning to Wallace Community College after three or more terms of non-attendance, are required to submit an updated Application for Re-admission and submit official transcripts from all postsecondary institutions attended since the last date of attendance at Wallace Community College.\n\nReturning students are eligible for re-admission only if they are in good standing for their last term of attendance. Students who are not in good standing or who have not served designated suspension periods may request re-admission by appeal to the Admissions and Academic Standards Committee.\n\nAn application may be obtained online at https://wallace.my.site.com/apply.\n\nWallace Community College has partnered with Parchment to accept online transcript orders.
