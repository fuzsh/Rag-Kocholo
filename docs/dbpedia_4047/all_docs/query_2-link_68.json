We'll continue to monitor status. At this time, the Helpdesk System will continue to remain available on for on-campus and VPN access. Staff are available to create tickets via phone calls at (973) 720-4357. Thank you for your patience.\n\nInitial:\n\nThe Information Technology Help Desk system (www.wpunj.edu/helpdesk) will be temporarily unavailable for off-campus access while an emergency update is addressed. The system will still be accessible from the campus network through https://help.wpunj.edu\n\nWhile the system will be unavailable from off campus, calls to the Helpdesk line (973-720-4357) will continue to create automated tickets when a voicemail is left. IT staff will follow up on any priority tickets with return phone calls or responses by email.\n\nWe do request that if you are off-campus and your technology issue/request is not urgent, you revisit creating a ticket on Tuesday or later to see if system access is restored so that your ticket can be escalated to the proper IT team.\n\nThank you for your patience while this issue is addressed."
