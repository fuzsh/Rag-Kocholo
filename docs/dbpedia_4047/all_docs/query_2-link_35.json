The goal of this review is to provide an on-campus housing accommodation that best meets your need. SDSS will then make a recommendation to the Morgan State University Office of Residence Life & Housing regarding your request for special accommodation.\n\nYou are not guaranteed housing once registered with SDSS and must complete all necessary requirements of the Office of Residence Life & Housing. For priority consideration for the fall semester, applications must be completed by June 1st. Spring semester assignments are based on space availability."
