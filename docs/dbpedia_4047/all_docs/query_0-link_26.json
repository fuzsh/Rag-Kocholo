JOHN S. TANNER of tennessee in the house of representatives Friday, September 22, 2000 Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to acknowledge the tremendous contributions and individual success stories that have helped our communities grow out of the presence of Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, the heart of the Eighth Congressional District. Lane College is one of six Historically Black Universities and Colleges located in Tennessee that have helped set a standard for academic excellence. Lane was founded in 1882 as the C.M.E. High School by the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church of America. But the seeds for this great institution were first planted four years earlier in 1878. William Miles, the first Bishop of the C.M.E. Church of America presided over the Tennessee Annual Conference in 1878 accepted a resolution by the Rev. J.A. Daniels to establish a school. Two years later, after the great yellow fever epidemic and the ascension of Bishop Isaac Lane to the head of the Tennessee Annual Conference, four acres of land were purchased for $240 and in 1882 the school's doors were opened. Bishop Lane's daughter, Miss Jennie Lane, was its first teacher. In 1884 its name was changed to Lane Institute. Then, 12 years later a college department was organized and the Board of Trustees changed the school's name to Lane College. Lane College is a small, private, co-educational, church-related institution with a liberal arts curriculum offering degrees in the Arts and Sciences. Led by Dr. Wesley McClure, the College's ninth president, the school continues to play a critical role in Jackson and surrounding communities as an institution committed to academic excellence. Lane College is one of 120 historically black universities and colleges located in 23 states across the nation. Lane is one of six located in Tennessee and the other five are Fisk University, Knoxville College, Meharry Medical College, Lemoyne-Owen College, and Tennessee State University. In 1997, 28 percent of African Americans who received a bachelors degree earned them from historically black universities and colleges. Moreover, about 40 percent of African American undergraduates enrolled at historically black universities and colleges in 1996 were first-generation college students. Over its first 118 years, Lane College has ensured its place in the community of academic institutions devoted to the growth and achievement of our young people. So Mr. Speaker, we are quite certain it will build on that vision of community leadership and academic excellence well into the 21st Century. Thank you for setting aside this time tonight so that we may recognize the important role historically black universities and colleges play in our country. ____________________"
