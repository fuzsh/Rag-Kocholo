Brigham was slated to become the President of the College in 1889, but was killed in a train accident shortly before she was to take office.

RFs are typically in their junior or senior year, have previously served as a Resident Advisor, and have the community of the entire residence hall as their focus. As members of the Residential Life staff, RFs coordinate hall meetings, advise and mentor Resident Advisors, and assist in the organizing of programs and activities in the residence halls. RFs also work closely with the Resident Advisors to address hall and individual student concerns such as hallmate conflicts, personal crisis or academic issues. Each RF participates in significant training each year and can provide resource and referral information to all students in the hall.\n\nResident Advisors (RAs) are student staff who serve as peer mentors and coaches to the community. RAs partner with the residents they oversee to develop a sense of community responsibility for the general welfare of the floor and develop the floor into a welcoming, inclusive and friendly community. RAs both get to know the residents situated around them and work to help them get to know each other. RAs can be sophomores, juniors or seniors and are trained as peer mentors in community development, conflict management and resolution, programming, academic support, personal wellbeing issues and interpersonal skills. Along with these skills, RAs are knowledgeable about campus resources and can provide referrals and information. Most importantly, the RA is available to each member of the community for peer support. RAs are selected for their desire to work with other students to create a positive and caring living experience for all."
