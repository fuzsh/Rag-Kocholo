        "text": "Editors Note: This is part of a series started on our website where our members who attend HBCU’s discuss their expereinces.\n\nBeing an openly gay black male at a Historical Black College and University has its ups and its downs. I attend Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee. Lane College is a private, small, four year institution nestled in east Jackson, a predominately black community. It is also a Christian college or rather C.M.E church based college. I originally did not want to attend Lane College, I wanted to go Jackson State University where I could march in the “Sonic Boom of the South” but I did not have enough money to pay the out of state tuition, so I settled and went to school who accepted me next, which was Lane College.\n\nI began my studies at Lane College in 2011, where I was met with warm greetings of being called a “faggot” by my straight male classmates at this freshman class meeting in my school’s auditorium. It was nothing new to me, I was used to hearing that erroneous word ever since high school, so it really didn’t faze me, so I just let it roll of my back, like a duck in water. The straight dudes on campus want to show how “straight” they really are by either saying snide comments about me as I walk by them or either going out of their to walk on the other side of the walkway so that they won’t be seen walking beside a gay dude, well the feeble-minded straight dudes do that. Staying in an all-male dormitory does not make my situation any better. Every time I walk pass the lobby to get to my destination the straight boys will start laughing or interrupt their conversation to speak on that gay dude who just walked past, but all the while, a few of them tend to knock on my door late at night for a “night cap.”\n\nYes, amongst all the negativity from the straight males on campus, there are the ones who put on this act of being straight but secretly having sexual relations with the homosexuals that they put down constantly with their friends, like. It’s something I’m not proud of but I have had several encounters with straight dudes who so happen like to have sex with another male. I battle with myself on the acts that I have done with them but I cannot change it, I wanted him at the time so I went for it risks and all. I made sure every time I had sexual relations with a “straight dude,” I made sure to get tested, because dealing with straight dudes on my campus you would never know if they had something or not.\n\nBesides on getting a couple of trades every now and then, there are other upsides. The faculty and staff at Lane College are “gay friendly,” some more than others. The Residential Assistants of my dorm loves when my friends and I come around because we always give them a show and have them laughing. The straight and lesbian girls on campus love me as well, but all girls love to be around gay dudes. Every night in the student union, my friends and I make our way to the student union, called “the New Shack,” and we turn on the sound system and dance. The straight dudes who are in the New Shack do not seem to pay us any mind when we are dancing because they see us dancing every day. Now occasionally you will get the one who try to prove there heterosexuality by walking out of the union when we start to dance, but while we are dancing we tend to have a mixed audience of boys and girls watching us.\n\nOverall like I previously stated, being an openly gay male at an HBCU, has its ups and downs. There is a lot of negativity when it comes to being gay at a black school, located in a black, low income neighborhood but there are positive environments at HBCU. I have experienced the gay bashing and separation from the heterosexual males here at Lane College but the positive I have encountered has outweighed the negative. If someone were to ask me if I would trade being openly gay at an HBCU or openly gay at a traditional white college or university, I would choose being openly gay at an HBCU, because I feel saying that yes I attended an HBCU, and yes I was “out” on campus, will give a person more of confidence boost because they endured the hardships of being openly gay, like myself, at an HBCU. It built character, confidence, and self-esteem in myself because I did not and will not allow the malicious side of attending an HBCU and being openly gay at an HBCU hinder me from receiving an education that I paid for and working towards my goals."
