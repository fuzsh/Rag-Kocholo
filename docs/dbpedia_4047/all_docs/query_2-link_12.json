Who should I contact, if I have a bus concern or question?\n\nA. It is best to always call your student’s school first. Personnel at the school will be able to answer most bus questions. There is very limited staff at the Transportation Department, which can make it very hard for someone to answer a large number of phone calls during pick-up and drop-off hours.\n\nQ. Who should I contact, if I have a bus emergency?\n\nA. It is best to always call your student’s school first. Your school is best equipped to help in an emergency and can contact the appropriate transportation staff to help.\n\nQ. My bus is late. Why?\n\nA. There are many factors that contribute to buses being off schedule. Traffic, weather, road conditions, a driver being absent, maintenance difficulties and unforeseen incidents can often contribute to deviations in arrival times.\n\nQ. Who is responsible for discipline on the school bus?\n\nA. A driver’s primary responsibility is operating the school bus. Due to their focus on driving, they may not see everything that happens behind them. However, each driver monitors and refers discipline issues to the schools. Personnel at the school is responsible for disciplinary action taken for actions on the bus.\n\nQ. Why does JMCSS not provide the options for a student to be picked up or dropped off at various locations?\n\nA. According to state law, each student eligible for transportation is permitted one seat on a bus. Providing transportation to and from different locations on different days would require the assignment of multiple seats for those students.\n\nQ. Why is my child not allowed to get off the bus wherever they want in the afternoon?\n\nA. JMCSS policy requires students to ride their assigned bus to and from their assigned stop. Switching stops for any reason is prohibited.\n\nQ. How are bus stops determined?\n\nA. State regulations require that the district provide safe and efficient bus routes to all eligible students. As a result, many variables are examined to determine if a stop is safe. We work very hard to keep the average student ride time to an hour. In order to accomplish this, the Transportation Department has to maintain routes that reduce time and mileage whenever possible.\n\nQ. The bus drives right by my home. Why does the bus not stop directly at my house?\n\nA. Bus stops are established at easily identified locations accessible to students throughout a geographic area. This assures student safety, bus safety and service reliability. Every time a school bus stops to pick up and/or drop off students, ride time is increased. Each stop requires deceleration by the bus, stop sequence, loading, seating, safety checks and acceleration back into the flow of traffic. Therefore, stopping at every residence along a road could be unsafe as well as an inefficient use of resources and time. On average, our buses make thousands of stops a day. Additional stops could result in students’ ride times increasing by several hours.\n\nQ. Why does the school bus not come into my subdivision?\n\nA. School buses come in various sizes ranging from 25 to 36 feet long and 20,000 – 26,000 pounds, 12-13 feet high and 6-9 feet in width. Often the length of a school bus limits maneuverability in cul-de-sacs and tight places. Whenever possible, backing up is avoided. Street parking by residents also limits the space for buses to travel in some neighborhoods. Please know all routes and stops are designed with safety and efficiency as top priorities.\n\nQ. How often are bus stops locations reviewed?\n\nA. With approximately 3,800 stops located throughout Jackson-Madison County, Transportation Department personnel travel throughout the district on a regular basis to assess environmental and traffic changes. In addition, bus drivers report any concerns they may have relating to safe operations at bus stops. During a typical year, the Transportation Department will review approximately one-third of these stops. The department typically reviews 50 stops and routes per year due to safety concerns expressed by the community.\n\nQ. My street doesn’t have sidewalks and my student has to walk to the bus stop and wait?\n\nA. Many public streets are designed and built without sidewalks to maintain a rustic or non-urban image. When such streets were reviewed, they were accepted as low traffic volume pedestrian-safe. However, we definitely understand the concerns of parents. We encourage you to work with your children and review a safe and legal way to walk along the streets in your neighborhood and where to stand while waiting for the bus.\n\nQ.
