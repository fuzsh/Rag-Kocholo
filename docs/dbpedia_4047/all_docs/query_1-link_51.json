        "text": "Summary:\n\nLane Technical High School is a highly-regarded public high school in Chicago, Illinois that serves grades 7-12 with a student population of 4,496. The school has consistently ranked among the top high schools in Illinois, earning a 5-star rating from SchoolDigger.\n\nLane Technical High School demonstrates exceptional academic performance, with significantly higher proficiency rates compared to the City of Chicago School District and the state of Illinois. For example, in the 2022-2023 school year, 88.4% of 11th-grade students were proficient or better in SAT Mathematics, compared to just 19.1% for the district and 26.7% for the state. The school also maintains a high 96.1% four-year graduation rate, much higher than the district and state averages. Additionally, Lane Technical High School serves a diverse student population, with strong performance across different racial subgroups, as well as excelling in supporting students with special needs and those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nWhen compared to nearby schools in the same district, such as Aspira Charter - Bus and Fin and Disney II Magnet High School, Lane Technical High School significantly outperforms them in academic achievement and other key metrics. However, the school has seen a rise in chronic absenteeism, an area that may need to be addressed to maintain its exceptional outcomes.\n\nDetail:"
