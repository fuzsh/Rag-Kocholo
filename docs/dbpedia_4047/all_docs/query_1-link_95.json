        "text": "As the hour of graduation approaches at Lane College, it doesn’t seem as if it were too long ago when I was at this point. I had completed the requirements for graduation at this treasured place, where we were shaped very carefully by our teachers, parents, community and peers.\n\nIt did not occur to any of us that 60 years later many of us would return to the campus we loved to celebrate the Diamond anniversary of our graduation, and that many of our classmates would no longer be with us. This weekend we celebrate our common history, knowing that in the last 60 years all that we have become has been molded, colored and impacted by our experiences and interactions at Lane College. These experiences remain a part of what we are today, and we acknowledge and honor the importance those years have had in our lives.\n\nI remember Mrs. LaVera Seets Avant telling us, “Alumni are the lengthening shadows of the institution.” I didn’t understand it then, but today I do. When preparing to begin student teaching, Mrs. Essie Mae Perry said, “Don’t try to make them like you, teach in a way that will make them respect you.” Dean P.R. Shy said, “Walk in with your head up.” Mrs. Adams let me register with the little money that I had for which I am still grateful. President (the Rev. Chester Arthur) Kirkendoll ensured that all was well and encouraged us to live out the revered motto, “Esse non videri,” translated to mean, “To be, not to seem.”\n\nWe received a great comprehensive education in the basics, the sciences, the humanities, the arts, and the Christian faith. Our academic, spiritual, artistic and emotional needs were met with the different subject matter and activities, and the time we spent at Lane prepared us well for the next step that we would take into the real world. It meant different things to each of us, but graduation was the culmination of this stage in our lives and represented an important move into bona fide adulthood.\n\nIn our college years we were at Lane in unparalleled times. In 1958 we walked the hallowed halls, classrooms, and grounds for the last time as students, and gave our goodbyes to each other and the sheltered life we had come to love. We graduated and went to work in different fields, trades and professions. Indeed, the class of 1958 has left its mark on the world — just as Lane College left an indelible mark on each of us.\n\nOur prayer is that Lane College will continue to make its mark on students who come looking for a better life and leave knowing they can and will make a positive difference. We extend our very best wishes to Dr. Logan Hampton and all members of the Lane College family, and ‘Long may our loved College live.’\n\nHelen Johnson Owens is a retired educator, and 2017 Sterling Award winner, in Jackson."
