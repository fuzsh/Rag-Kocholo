        "text": "When Bates opened in 1855, it was New England’s first co-ed college. Since then, we have admitted students no matter their nationality, race, religion, sex, or socio-economic status. While this openness was at the core of our founding identity and principles, it has been tested throughout time and requires us to constantly reflect upon and recommit to our mission.\n\nOur holistic admission and need-based financial aid practices and policies are mission-driven. They’re grounded in a recognition of and respect for your background, what opportunities you’ve had, and what you’ve done with all that’s been available to you."
