        "text": "MaiTai arrived in Tennessee in 2014, after graduating from Simeon High School in Chicago, IL. She always wanted to attend a diverse school, but things didn’t work out as planned and she made changes. She was broken-hearted at that moment and thought she would be sitting at home until January. She had put her all into one school and didn’t get admitted, but that summer she got a break—and a letter from Lane College (a UNCF-member institution).\n\nIn her senior year, her high school had a college fair and she had been selected on the spot to attend Lane College, but rejected Lane. She decided to give Lane a call and was told her it wasn’t too late. Since that decision, her time at Lane has been great. Maitai is majoring in English and pursing her dreams of becoming a high school English teacher. She’s a proud member of the Lane College Pre-Alumni Council and attended her first UNCF National Alumni Council/Pre-Alumni Council Leadership Conference in New Orleans in 2016. She holds a 3.7 GPA. She expects to graduate in 2018.\n\n“Lane has taught me many things, but most importantly, it has honed my leadership skills and taught me to be an extremely hard worker and take pride in everything I do,” said Carr."
