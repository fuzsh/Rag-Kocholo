        "text": "Admissions Requirements and Application Processes\n\nStudents not enrolled in either a community college or Oregon State must meet the enrollment requirements for admission to OSU. The list of partner schools will direct you to your community college website for more information.\n\nNew first-year applicants to Oregon State (on-campus and Ecampus) are admitted to the DPP program based on first-year freshman student requirements and start their college careers being admitted at both OSU and the partner school of their choice. After being admitted, DPP students have the option of taking classes at their partner school only (while still having an active OSU student status), at OSU only, or they can truly dual-enroll and take classes at both locations.\n\nTo add the Degree Partnership Program to your admission status, you will need to update your application in Beaver Basecamp. Please do the following:\n\nLogin to Beaver Basecamp\n\nDouble Click on Application Details (it takes about 20 seconds for the page to load)\n\nClick on Add DPP\n\nClick on the Yes button - I am interested in being in the Degree Partnership Program\n\nChoose the Community College you would like to attend through the DPP\n\nChoose the START term (usually the term you are starting at OSU)\n\nClick on the Submit Button\n\nIt will take approximately two weeks for the application to process through the OSU and Community College systems.\n\nThere are many advantages for current Oregon State students that wish to have dual enrollment at an Oregon or Hawai’i community college.\n\nStudents who are enrolled in Oregon State must also apply through OSU Admissions to add their community college so they can enroll in classes.\n\nIf you are already admitted into OSU - please do the following:\n\nVerify that you are applying before the DPP Application deadline for the term you would like to be in the DPP program\n\nLogin to your OSU Beaver Hub Account\n\nCheck to make sure you do not have any holds on your university accounts\n\nClick on the Academics Tab\n\nLook in the Academic Overview section for holds - or check the top data block in your MyDegrees account\n\nIf you have a hold on your account - you must have it cleared before proceeding to add DPP to your account.\n\nTo Add DPP:\n\nLog into Beaver Hub\n\nSearch in Resources for “Account Summary By Term”\n\nClick on the 4 square icon in upper left corner next to the logo\n\nImage\n\nClick on Banner\n\nClick on Admissions\n\nClick on Adding Degree Partnership Program (DPP)\n\nChoose your Partner Community College\n\nSubmit Request\n\nLogin to your ONID Email account and Complete the DocuSign Form. Problems finding your DocuSign Form? You can also login to OSU's DocuSign directly by using this link.\n\nThis process could take 2-3 weeks. If it has been longer than 2-3 weeks, please contact us!\n\nPost-Baccalaureate or \"Post-Bacc.\" students must first apply to OSU as Postbaccalaureate Student. Once you have applied, been admitted, and indicated you will be attending OSU you can add DPP to your admission status for free by following the directions above for current OSU students.\n\nIf you are already admitted into OSU as a degree-seeking post-baccalaureate student and are in good academic standing, then you can easily add the Degree Partnership Program (DPP) to your admission status.\n\nPost-Baccalaureate Admissions Requirements\n\nPost-Baccalaureate Application Deadlines"
