        "text": "How do I enter my grades on the SSAR?\n\nPlease list your grades exactly as they appear on your transcript.\n\nDo I need to include high school courses that I took while I was in middle school/junior high school?\n\nEvery academic course attempted for high school credit while in middle school must be listed on the SSAR. If you took high school level courses (e.g., Algebra 1, Spanish 1) in middle school (grades 6, 7, or 8), please list them under your high school and select \"Middle School\" for the \"Academic Level\". Unless courses were taken for high school credit, you do not need to include middle school courses on the SSAR.\n\nHow do I list my college (dual enrollment) courses and grades?\n\nList your college grades exactly as they appear on your transcript. If your course is one credit in high school, list your credit/units as 1.0. If your course is 1/2 credit, list your credit/units as 0.5.\n\nHow do I report my senior coursework?\n\nPlease record all current and scheduled senior year coursework on the SSAR. Since we encourage applicants to apply early in their senior year, you should enter the grades for your senior coursework as \"In Progress\" if you have not yet earned a final grade.\n\nDo I report all the classes taken and grades earned that are on my transcript?\n\nAll attempted coursework must be listed on the SSAR. If you repeated a course, you must record both attempts. If you withdrew from a class before earning a grade, you must list the course and record the grade as withdrawn. The same is true for courses that you earned a grade of Pass or Fail.\n\nWhat if I repeated or withdrew from one or more of my courses, or I took a course for Pass/Fail?\n\nYou must list all attempts on your SSAR including repeats and withdrawals. The same is true for courses in which you earned a grade of Pass or Fail. Your SSAR must match exactly what is on your high school transcript.\n\nI am currently attending an international school. Do I complete the SSAR?\n\nPlease complete the International School Form located on your Application Status Check to determine if you will need to complete the SSAR.\n\nHow do I select the Grade Scale for my school?\n\nWhen entering your high school information, you will be able to select the school grading scale.\n\nLetter Grades\n\nLetter grades are typically presented as 'A+', 'A', 'A-', 'B+', 'B', 'B-', and so forth.\n\nNumber Grades\n\nNumber grades are typically based on a whole-number scale from 0 to 100. If your school uses numbers with decimals (i.e. 89.5), select 'Decimal Grades'.\n\nLetters and Numbers\n\nChoose this option if your school uses a combination of letters and numbers in its grading system.\n\nDecimal Grades\n\nIf your school provides numeric grades with decimals (i.e. 89.5), select this option.\n\nOther\n\nSelect this option if this school uses a non-standard or international grading system (i.e. Pass/Fail).\n\nHow do I update my SSAR?\n\nTo update your SSAR navigate to your Application Status Check and select Update Your SSAR. While on the SSAR website, first select Continue to SSAR and then select Continue to navigate to the Record Complete page. Under Action Items, select Make changes to your SSAR. Select OK to begin making changes to your SSAR.\n\nOnce you have updated your SSAR, select the Review/Submit button located at the top right of your screen. Verify that all your information is correct and press the \"Submit\" button at the bottom of the \"Review/Submit\" section of the SSAR website. Once you click the \"Submit\" button, your SSAR will lock. If you do not re-lock your SSAR, your information will not be sent to Florida State.\n\nMy application was deferred. How do I update my SSAR to reflect first semester grades if my courses are entered as full year courses?\n\nIf your first semester grades are available and the in-progress coursework on your SSAR is set to \"Full Year\" Course Length, you should change it to \"Semester\" Course Length.\n\nTo make the update, navigate to your senior year courses on the SSAR and select \"Add Course.\" Add courses with the same values as the original courses but set the new Course Length to \"Semester.\" Add your grade to the first semester and leave the second semester set to \"In Progress.\" Select \"Add Course\" to complete.\n\nOnce the new course is added, delete the original Full Year course by checking the box on the course that was replaced and clicking the \"Remove Selected\" button. Repeat this for all senior year courses with first semester grades updated.\n\nWhich Course Level should I select?\n\nOptions for course levels (e.g. Regular, Honors, AP) are provided to assist in selecting a level that closely matches designations made on your high school transcript.\n\nWhich Course Length should I select?\n\nSelect the Course Length that best represents how long you took the course and how the school issues final grades (one final grade, semester grades, trimester grades, etc.).\n\nIf your school provides one final grade at the end of the school year, then select Full Year when reporting grades. If your school lists two final grades, then pick Semester and so forth.\n\nFor more information on selecting a course length, we recommend reviewing the following SSAR Help Article: How To Select A Course Length.\n\nSemester grades:\n\nA semester system divides the academic year into two sessions: fall and spring.\n\nFinal grades:\n\nIf your school provides one final grade at the end of the school year, then select Full Year when reporting grades.\n\nBoth semester grades and final grades:\n\nUse the final grade, then select Full Year when reporting grades.\n\nBoth trimester grades and final grades:\n\nUse the final grade, then select Full Year when reporting grades.\n\nTrimester grades:\n\nA trimester system divides the academic year into three sessions: fall, winter, and spring.\n\nBlock scheduling:\n\nYou are completing a yearlong course (one credit) in one semester and a semester-long course (half credit) in nine weeks.\n\nQuarter grades:\n\nA quarter system divides the academic year into four quarters; meaning four grades are awarded for a full year class.\n\nWhat is the Self-reported Student Academic Record (SSAR)?\n\nSSAR is a self-reported student academic record that lists all courses and associated grades that have been attempted, or will be attempted, for high school and/or college credit. Since accuracy is critical, you must have a copy of your high school transcript available to use as a reference when you create your SSAR. Be sure to indicate any courses taken through an online school.\n\nWho is required to complete the SSAR?\n\nAll first-year applicants must complete a SSAR, with the following exceptions:\n\nApplicants who have not followed an academic curriculum patterned after the U.S. system - must submit official or certified copies of all secondary school records and/or examination results. This includes students who have attended an institution not patterned after the U.S. system for any length of time. All academic records not in English must be accompanied by a certified English translation. In addition, these credentials must be evaluated by a credential evaluation agency. We recommend a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services or International Education Credential Services provided by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.\n\nGED graduates - students must submit their official GED transcript, along with official partial high school transcript(s).\n\nWhere do I create my SSAR?\n\nYou may create an account on the SSAR website. After submitting your application, you must link your Self-Reported Student Academic Record through your Application Status Check. Please allow one to two business days after linking for the checklist item to be satisfied.\n\nWhen do I complete the SSAR?\n\nWe recommend that you complete the SSAR before submitting your application for admission. Your application for admission will not be reviewed until your application fee, SSAR, and self-reported test scores have been received.\n\nHow do I link my SSAR to Florida State?\n\nAfter submitting your application, you must link your Self-Reported Student Academic Record through your Application Status Check. Please allow one to two business days after linking for the checklist item to be satisfied.\n\nDo home-educated students complete the SSAR?\n\nYes, if they have followed an academic curriculum patterned after the traditional U.S. system. If the curriculum followed cannot be represented on the SSAR, we ask that you contact the Office of Admissions at admissions@fsu.edu or call 850.644.6200 for further instruction.\n\nWhat if I have graduated from High School?\n\nYes, you will complete the SSAR. Students that have graduated high school will list all of their coursework and all final grades on the SSAR.\n\nWhat if I can't find my high school listed on the SSAR website?\n\nThe SSAR website uses a database of names from College Board which may vary slightly from the everyday name of your school. When searching for your school, try to use variants of the official school name. For example, if you attended T.C. Central High School, enter \"Central\" in the search box. Make sure you select the correct state. If you still can't find your high school, you should contact the Office of Admissions at admissions@fsu.edu or call 850.644.6200.\n\nHow do I re-lock my SSAR?\n\nTo re-lock your Self-reported Student Academic Record (SSAR), press the \"Submit\" button at the bottom of the \"Review/Submit\" section of the SSAR website. Once you click the \"Submit\" button, your SSAR will lock. If you do not re-lock your SSAR, your information will not be sent to Florida State.\n\nWhat will happen if I do not complete the SSAR?\n\nAll first-year applicants (excluding the exceptions) must complete the SSAR. If you are unable to complete the SSAR, you must contact the Office of Admissions at admissions@fsu.edu or call 850.644.6200.\n\nCan my SSAR be used by multiple colleges/universities?\n\nFlorida State University, the University of Florida, Florida Atlantic University, and Florida Polytechnic University require the SSAR. Once you complete your SSAR, you must check with each institution on how to provide them with access to your data.\n\nFor Florida State, link your Self-Reported Student Academic Record through your Application Status Check. Please allow one to two business days after linking for the checklist item to be satisfied.\n\nCan I submit the SRAR (self-reported academic record) instead of the SSAR (self-reported student academic record)?\n\nYes. Beginning August 1, 2022, your SRAR and SSAR accounts are the same. If you have previously created a SSAR with a different email address, you may link your account by clicking 'Login to Existing SSAR Account' when linking your SSAR through your Application Status Check.\n\nHow do I update my SSAR?\n\nTo update your SSAR navigate to your Application Status Check and select Update Your SSAR. While on the SSAR website, first select Continue to SSAR and then select Continue to navigate to the Record Complete page. Under Action Items, select Make changes to your SSAR. Select OK to begin making changes to your SSAR.\n\nOnce you have updated your SSAR, select the Review/Submit button located at the top right of your screen. Verify that all your information is correct and press the \"Submit\" button at the bottom of the \"Review/Submit\" section of the SSAR website. Once you click the \"Submit\" button, your SSAR will lock. If you do not re-lock your SSAR, your information will not be sent to Florida State.\n\nMy application was deferred. How do I update my SSAR to reflect first semester grades if my courses are entered as full year courses?\n\nIf your first semester grades are available and the in-progress coursework on your SSAR is set to \"Full Year\" Course Length, you should change it to \"Semester\" Course Length.\n\nTo make the update, navigate to your senior year courses on the SSAR and select \"Add Course.\" Add courses with the same values as the original courses but set the new Course Length to \"Semester.\" Add your grade to the first semester and leave the second semester set to \"In Progress.\" Select \"Add Course\" to complete.\n\nOnce the new course is added, delete the original Full Year course by checking the box on the course that was replaced and clicking the \"Remove Selected\" button. Repeat this for all senior year courses with first semester grades updated.\n\nWhat if my senior schedule changes?\n\nIf your schedule changes, you must immediately update your SSAR. To make changes to the SSAR, simply log in to the SSAR website with the email address and password used to create your original SSAR. Additionally, if you are an accepted student considering a senior schedule changes please contact the admissions office before making a schedule change since it may negatively impact your acceptance to the university.\n\nWhat if I am taking courses in the summer?\n\nYou will record the course and grade in the preceding school year. For example, if you took a course between the 9th and 10th grades, you would enter the course in the 9th grade.\n\nCan I change the SSAR once it is completed and I receive my SSAR ID Number?\n\nYes. We want your SSAR to be as accurate as possible. If you have corrections or your schedule changes, we encourage you to update your SSAR. To make changes, log in to the Application Status Check and select Update Your SSAR located in the Self-Reported Student Academic Record section. After you have made your updates, you must press the \"Submit\" button at the bottom of the \"Review/Submit\" section of the SSAR.\n\nDo I have to submit my first semester grades in the senior year?\n\nDo I have to submit my final senior grades?\n\nAll admitted students are required to update the SSAR with their final senior grades. You will log in to the SSAR website with the email address and password used to create your original SSAR. All admitted students who choose to enroll at Florida State are also required to submit final official high school and college dual enrollment transcripts, so that the grades entered on their SSAR can be verified.\n\nWhat if I am unsure about the dual enrollment classes that I will be taking during the second semester of my senior year?\n\nProvide the best estimation of the courses you will be taking when completing the SSAR. If your schedule changes, you must update the SSAR. If you are unable to update the SSAR, you must be in contact with the Office of Admissions at admissions@fsu.edu or call 850.644.6200. If the correct information is not listed on your SSAR when we validate your courses and grades from your official high school and college transcripts, your admission is subject to revocation and, if discovered after classes begin, cancellation of registration.\n\nWhen do I send my official high school and college (if dual enrolled) transcripts?\n\nOnly applicants offered admission who plan to enroll at Florida State are required to submit official high school and college transcripts after graduation. These transcripts will be used to validate the information on the SSAR. Students with inaccurate data on the SSAR may be denied admission to the University, have their admission revoked, or have their registration cancelled if enrolled."
