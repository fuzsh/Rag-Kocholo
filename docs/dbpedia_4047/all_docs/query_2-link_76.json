        "text": "I'm interested in pursuing research; do I have to do a URH program?\n\nThere any many benefits to participating in a URH research program. The benefits listed below may not be not available for all programs (e.g. FMP provides 199 credit, but not a stipend), but are available across URH offerings.\n\nStructured mentoring and programming\n\n199 credit\n\nCo-curricular credit\n\nStipend/scholarship\n\nAcademic year and summer term opportunities\n\n1-3 quarter opportunities\n\nAbility to participate in multiple programs for multiple terms/years (consecutively, not at the same time)\n\nAble to apply for URH conference travel funds\n\nSummer programs offer professional development seminars and workshops (e.g. GRE skills, professional communication, presenting at conferences, library training, ethics in conducting research)\n\nGraduate school application waivers (McNair Program)\n\nEnhanced support for applications to and nominations for prestigious scholarships\n\nHowever, no, you don't have to do research through an Undergraduate Research Hub program. There are many other research opportunities across the UC San Diego campus:\n\nVolunteering\n\nIndependent study\n\nHonors research\n\nReal Portal\n\nOther on-campus research programs\n\nCan I pursue research abroad?\n\nUndergraduate Research Hub programs\n\nIf you have a project that would require being abroad, our programs allow for this on a case-by-case basis and with agreement from the program coordinator and research mentor. If you do go abroad as part of your research project, you must still meet other requirements of the program.\n\nOther opportunities at UC San Diego\n\nYou can also do research abroad through the Study Abroad Office by participating in the research UCEAP program. Visit the Study Abroad Office for more information. There are scholarships available through the office.\n\nIf you’re in biology/biotechnology, you can consider applying to the Amgen Scholars Asia programs, as well. They include institutions in Japan, China, and Singapore.\n\nCheck out Alternative Breaks through CSI. Some of these opportunities allow for going abroad, and may be related to research/service projects.\n\nOpportunities beyond UC San Diego\n\nThere are also opportunities through other institutions such as the Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS) – Singapore through UCLA.\n\nCan I pursue research outside of UC San Diego?\n\nYes, there are many research opportunities across the country:\n\nResearch Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) at other universities.\n\nYou can search online for opportunities (REU + your field/interest)\n\nYou can search the NSF REUs list.\n\nAdditionally, you can subscribe to our newsletter and be notified of REUs on our radar.\n\nUC LEADS is a research program across the UC campuses.\n\nIn addition to doing a program in another location, it may also be possible to conduct your UC San Diego research elsewhere (e.g. conducting interviews in Tijuana or fieldwork in San Francisco).\n\nI am studying a field in the arts, humanities, and/or social sciences; can I pursue research?\n\nYes! Research can happen not only in labs, but also in libraries, performance stages, art studios, community centers, or anywhere else in the world where you pursue your intellectual curiosity. We encourage students working in the arts, humanities, and/or social sciences to conduct research, apply for our various programs, and to attend our Conference for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH) events.\n\nI am a first-year undergraduate student; can I pursue research?\n\nYes! There are several URH programs that are open to first-year undergraduate students, including the Triton Research & Experiential Learning Scholars (TRELS) program during the academic year and the summer and the Undergraduate Research Scholarships (URS) program during the summer. You can learn more about the specific requirements from our URH Programs Table. Be sure to double check the requirements for each specific opportunity when applying.\n\nAdditional opportunities for first-year students may also be available outside of URH through volunteering, an independent study course, the real portal, or another on-campus program.\n\nI am a transfer student; can I pursue research?\n\nYes! Generally, URH programs are open to all students regardless of transfer status. We also offer the STARTneuro program, which is specifically geared toward incoming transfer students with an interest in neuroscience, and the EMPOWER Scholars program that is for community college transfer engineering students. You can learn more about the specific requirements from our URH Programs Table here. Be sure to double check the requirements for each specific opportunity when applying.\n\nAdditional opportunities for transfer students may also be available outside of URH through volunteering, an independent study course, the real portal, or another on-campus program.\n\nI am a junior/senior student; can I pursue research?\n\nYes! All URH programs are open to juniors and seniors, and it is never too late to do research! If fact, some faculty prefer to work with students who have taken introductory courses.\n\nAdditional opportunities for juniors/senior students may also be available outside of URH through volunteering, an independent study course, the real portal, or another on-campus program.\n\nI graduate in the spring; can I pursue research in the summer?\n\nYou can \"walk\" in the spring graduation ceremony, but to participate in CAMP or McNair, you will need to extend your official graduation date to the summer.\n\nI am not a US citizen or permanent resident; can I pursue research?\n\nYes! All students are important members of our research community. There are several URH programs that are open to students regardless of citizenship status, including the Triton Research & Experiential Learning Scholars (TRELS) program, the Faculty Mentor Program (FMP), and UC Scholars. You can learn more about the specific requirements from our URH Programs Table here. Be sure to double check the requirements for each specific opportunity when applying.\n\nAdditional opportunities for non citizen/permanent resident students may also be available outside of URH through volunteering, an independent study course, the real portal, or another on-campus program.\n\nWhy are some programs restricted to certain groups (e.g. citizenship status, race/ethnic identity, major, etc.)?\n\nMany of these programs are funded by federal or private funds, and these funding sources determine what types of applicants they wish to fund. We cannot change these rules, we just implement them.\n\nI am a local high school student; can I pursue research at UC San Diego?\n\nThe Undergraduate Research Hub does not support research opportunities for high school students. However, you can check with COSMOS, ENLACE, HS STAR, OPTIMUS, MRSEC RIMSE, REHS. They may have opportunities for high school students during the summer.\n\nAdditionally, you can individually ask faculty if they support high school students through their project/lab. Some faculty will take high school students on a case-by-case basis.\n\nI am a high school student; can I present at UC San Diego Undergraduate Research Conferences?\n\nThe Undergraduate Research Hub does not accept high school students to present at our conferences, regardless if you have conducted research at UC San Diego.\n\nI am currently in community college; can I pursue research at UC San Diego?\n\nThe STARS program is a summer research program that accepts community college students. ENLACE is a summer program that may accept community college students as well.\n\nAdditionally, the STARTneuro program accepts transfer students to start research the summer before they start at UC San Diego.\n\nAdditional opportunities for current community college students may also be available. Check the All UC San Diego Research Program Database for the most up-to-date information.\n\nI am a currently in community college; can I present at UC San Diego Undergraduate Research Conferences?\n\nAny college student who conducted summer research can present at our Summer Research Conference.\n\nI am a college student, but not at UC San Diego; can I pursue research at UC San Diego?\n\nThe STARS and ENLACE are summer research programs that accepts applications from non-UC San Diego students.\n\nAlso, many REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates) are hosted on-campus for non-UC San Diego students in STEM. Best place to find them would be on https://pathwaystoscience.org. There is an advanced search if you prefer to list specific institution(s).\n\nAdditional opportunities for non-UCSD students may also be available. Check the All UC San Diego Research Program Database for the most up-to-date information.\n\nI am a college student, but not at UC San Diego; can I present at UC San Diego Undergraduate Research Conferences?\n\nAny college student who conducted summer research can present at our Summer Research Conference.\n\nI just graduated but want to gain research experience; can I pursue research at UC San Diego?\n\nThere are a number of ways recent graduates can pursue research opportunities at UC San Diego.\n\nThe STARS program is a summer research program that accepts recent college graduates.\n\nFor some areas of study, lab assistant positions are posted at jobs.ucsd.edu. These positions may require some experience. In some cases, lab coursework experiences may be sufficient.\n\nAdditionally, you can individually ask faculty if they can support you through their project/lab.\n\nAcross the country, there are also many post-bac and PREP (Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program). Here are a few examples, but there are many more that can be found by searching \"PREP Program\" or \"Postbaccalaureate Program\" + Interest/Major.\n\nPostbaccalaureate Premedical Programs\n\nNIH Biomedical Postbaccalaureate Program\n\nNIH Biomedical PREP Program\n\nUCLA Pre-Medical Enrichment Program\n\nCan I apply to multiple research programs at the same time?\n\nYes. We encourage you to simultaneously apply for as many research programs as you like, as long as you meet the eligibility requirements. Generally, however, URH only allows for students to participate in one program at a time. This means that if you were to have multiple offers for concurrent research programs—for example, multiple offers for summer research funding—you will likely have to accept one offer and decline the others.\n\nAlso, you will need to honor the offer you accept. It is unprofessional and often not possible to later withdraw from a program to accept another offer.\n\nCan I participate in more than one program during my UC San Diego academic career?\n\nYes. While we generally only allow for students to participate in one program at a time, you can participate in many of our programs throughout your academic career at UC San Diego. We encourage it! For example, you can participate in TRELS during the academic year and then participate in one of our summer research programs during the summer. This is one example. There are many options for mixing and matching our programs throughout your time at UC San Diego.\n\nDo I need to identify a faculty mentor before applying to URH opportunities?\n\nThis depends upon the specific program to which you are applying. Some programs require you to identify a mentor on your application, while other programs do not. Be sure to double check the requirements for each specific opportunity when applying. Feel free to reach out the program coordinator(s) if you have any questions.\n\nWho can serve as my faculty mentor for a research project?\n\nIn general, students participating in URH programs are expected to have a UC San Diego faculty member as their mentor. This usually means someone with the word “Professor” in their title: “Teaching Professor,” “Assistant Professor,” “Associate Professor,” or “Professor.” In some cases, graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, research scientists, or visiting lecturers may serve as your primary points of contact while pursuing your project, but you should still have an official faculty mentor of record.\n\nHow do I find a faculty mentor?\n\nThere are a variety of tools and strategies that you can employ to identify a faculty mentor.\n\nConsider reaching out to professors who have taught you in courses connected to your areas of interest. Talk to teaching assistants (TAs), instructional assistants (IAs), research assistants (RAs), or other people on campus who have shaped your intellectual life, and who might have contact with faculty members who serve as the principal investigator (PI) for a research group. Search the course catalog and departmental websites for faculty members who teach courses that you hope to soon take. Utilize the Research Experience & Applied Learning (REAL) Portal and/or the UCSD Profiles database to search for faculty members working in fields related to your interests. If you are interested in pursuing research, but are having difficulty identifying a potential mentor, please reach out to the URH staff, and we will be happy to assist you in your search.\n\nOnce you have identified a possible mentor, reach out via email to formally introduce yourself, explain your research interests in relationship to their work, and request whether they would be willing to meet with you virtually or in-person to further discuss the possibility of serving as a mentor. While faculty members are busy—and sometimes may seem intimidating to approach—most often they are truly excited to meet enthusiastic young scholars who share their intellectual interests."
