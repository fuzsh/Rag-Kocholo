        "text": "Academics\n\nLane College is devoted to fostering the future of “the whole student”—and one way they do so is with the Lane Institute. This student-centered resource acts as an addendum to courses and provides academic advising, extracurricular activities, and one-on-one support for incoming students during their first 60 hours of general education classes. Lane College undergrads are set up for success from the get-go, with no application deadlines, scholarship funding provided to 96% of need-based students, and a small 17:1 student to teacher classroom environment that focuses on each individual. Lane College offers associate and bachelor’s degrees as well as career-training certifications in three divisions, all with a goal of job placement upon completion. Areas of focus include Business, Social and Behavioral Sciences; Liberal Studies and Education; and Natural and Physical Sciences. Educational tracks range from sociology and music to religion and mathematics. Lane College recognizes that students benefit from diverse learning environments, especially ones that are tailored to each student’s field of study. On-campus specialty academic centers include the Writing Center, with staff able to support students on writing assignments; the STEM center, a lab where technology is paramount and student mentors and staff are available to assist with coursework; and the Mass Communication Building with multimedia equipment for use, including audio and editing programs, video and DSLR cameras, and fully functioning television and radio studios.\n\nCareer\n\nStudents looking to get involved with the community have their pick of more than 70 organizations, including Greekletter clubs, music programs, religious groups, and other special interest options. Prominent among them is the Lane College Concert Choir, which performs across the country and for dignitaries. There’s also the Lane College Dragons Marching Band, which, along with the dance team and color guard, is a regular presence not only at the school’s sporting events but also at professional NBA games. Lane College’s athletic teams compete as part of the NCAA Division-II level (men’s and women’s) across all the major sports. Continuing its faith-based history, religious programs are also paramount at Lane College, with services held weekly in the onsite chapel. There is also the annual Religious Emphasis Week, which is helps students to deepen their relationship with the church.\n\nCulture\n\nLane College has an exceptional roster of alumni across numerous sectors, including NFL footballer Jacoby Jones who played for the Houston Texans and has been lauded for his Super Bowl plays with the Baltimore Ravens, as well as renowned bass player Chuck Rainey who has worked with Aretha Franklin and Quincy Jones. There’s also civil rights lawyer Donald Lee Hollowell, known for helping to free Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the times he was imprisoned for his demonstrations."
