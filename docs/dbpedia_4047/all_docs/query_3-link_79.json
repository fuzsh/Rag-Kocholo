        "text": "You will need a desktop, laptop or mobile device as well as a microphone, camera (these may be part of the computer, or separate devices plugged into the computer) and internet fast enough to handle streaming video. Learning can be done online or offline.\n\nNewlane recommends that students and experts use the Chrome browser to access coursework and for course hearings (the one-on-one video conference oral exam with a course professor at the end of each course). Tests and counseling sessions are conducted through video chat on the Newlane site. No third-party software is needed. It is safest to consider the learning platform on Newlane in beta for mobile devices. While tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices may allow for some completion of coursework, they are not guaranteed to work in all areas.\n\nFirst, we’re not providing any fancy stadiums, or alumni centers, etc.. Second, we’re not providing live teaching or instruction for every lesson. Instead, we leverage the abundant free high quality online resources that our experts have vetted. And while we provide instructional material, you are also welcome to use whatever materials or resources you find to master the objectives. Newlane does not dictate or verify how or where you learn the information, only that you learned it. And assessing that you have mastered the target objectives is where the live expert is vital."
