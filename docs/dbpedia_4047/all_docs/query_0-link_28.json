        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. – The Memphis Tigers are set for their final exhibition tune-up, hosting Lane College Sunday at 1 p.m. at FedExForum.\n\nThe Tigers had to shake off some rust last Sunday in their first exhibition, overcoming a 2-for-19 shooting night from long distance to defeat Christian Brothers, 69-60. Kendric Davis poured in a game-high 22 points, while adding six assists and three rebounds in 29 minutes. DeAndre Williams had 12 points and a game-high nine boards in 25 minutes.\n\nKeonte Kennedy had nine points and four rebounds, while Chandler Lawson pulled down six boards. Alex Lomax dished out three assists, grabbed four rebounds and swiped three steals to go along with four points. Kaodirichi Akobundu-Ehiogu played 16 minutes and swatted a game-high three blocks to compliment six boards.\n\nThe Lane Dragons are coached by former Memphis standout Andre Turner, who helped the Tigers to four-straight NCAA Tournaments from 1982-86, including the 1985 Final Four. Known as the \"Little General,\" Turner's Memphis career was highlighted by the run the Tigers made in the 1985 NCAA Tournament. The Tigers cruised past Penn in the opening round and then, on the strength of three consecutive game-winning shots by Turner, topped UAB, Boston College and Oklahoma to reach the Final Four before losing to eventual national champion Villanova.\n\nTurner finished his Memphis career with 1,442 points, a total that ranks 14th all-time in school history. He still holds the Memphis records for assists in a game with 15 against South Carolina on March 7, 1986, assists in a season with 262 during the 1985-86 campaign and assists in a career with 763.\n\nSeason tickets for 2022-23 are available at www.GoTigersGoTix.com, with a mobile pass allowing fans to experience a different seating location for each game starting at $99.\n\nGAME DETAILS\n\nMemphis Tigers (0-0) vs. Lane College Dragons (0-0) (exhibition)\n\nSunday, Oct. 30, 2022 | 1 p.m. CT\n\nFedExForum (18,400); Memphis, Tenn.\n\nTelevision: None\n\nRadio: 98.1 THE MAX (Dave Woloshin, pxp; Matt Dillon, analysis)\n\nLive Stats: www.Memphis.StatBroadcast.com\n\nGAME NOTES\n\nMemphis has won 20 games in each of the last five seasons, including all four under head coach Penny Hardaway.
