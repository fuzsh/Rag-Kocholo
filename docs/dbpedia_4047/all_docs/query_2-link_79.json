By 2022, entry into two-year colleges was 21 percent lower than before the pandemic, with larger declines in Black- and Hispanic-majority colleges. Four-year college entry declined by only 6 percent and then rebounded 4 percent. High school graduation reached an all-time high in 2022. To explain these patterns, we undertook an interrupted time series design. Lower numbers of COVID cases and higher levels of in-person instruction led to increased college entry and possibly increased graduation. Relaxation of graduation standards explain between-state variation in high school graduation and helps explain the continued high graduation rates. Changing labor-market opportunities do not explain cross-state variation in attainment. We suggest additional explanations for these trends. Barring other substantial changes, we predict that future college attainment will be lower for cohorts of school or college age during the pandemic, especially for some marginalized groups.\n\nCOVID\n\npandemics\n\neducational attainment\n\nhigh school graduation\n\ncollege-going\n\nEducation has been near the center of the COVID crisis in part due to a concern about what the pandemic would do to students academically, socially, and psychologically. A large and growing number of studies find that the pandemic lowered test scores and exacerbated score gaps associated with poverty and race-ethnicity, especially in districts that made more use of remote instruction (Bacher-Hicks, Goodman, and Mulhern 2021; Betthäuser, Bach-Mortensen, and Engzell 2022; Goldhaber, Kane, et al. 2022; Halloran et al. 2021; Lewis et al. 2021; Sass and Goldring 2022; Thorn and Vincent-Lancrin 2021; West and Lake 2021). These score gaps may foreshadow large and negative economic impacts in the future (Goldhaber, Kane, et al. 2022; Hanushek and Woessmann 2020). Others have found evidence of declining mental health and stunted emotional development (Blanchflower and Bryson 2022; Czeisler et al. 2020), which may also have long-term repercussions.\n\nSome research has also examined educational attainment, especially overall K–12 enrollment and college enrollment. Thomas Dee and his colleagues, for example, reported a sharp drop in kindergarten enrollments and smaller effects on enrollment in higher grades (Dee and Murphy 2021; Dee et al. 2021). Also, the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC 2022) reported declining college enrollment, especially in two-year colleges.1 Remote and hybrid schooling was likely a key factor, which is troubling given the limited evidence that COVID education policies had much benefit for public health (Harris, Ziedan, and Hassig 2021), especially when masking and vaccine policies were in place (Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf 2021; Goldhaber, Kane, et al. 2022).2 However, we show that COVID triggered other changes, which were partly conflated with instruction, that may also have affected attainment.\n\nWe make four contributions to this discussion. First, we examine two forms of educational attainment that have received little attention in the COVID literature: high school graduation and the transition from high school to college. Others have reported trends in the total number of students attending college. We focus on initial college entry, as distinct from other influences such as dropout and persistence. High school graduation and college entry are both key stepping stones to further human capital investment that are critical to individual well-being and macroeconomic growth. It is therefore important to document pandemic-related trends in these outcomes.\n\nWhat effect did COVID have on high school completion and college entry during the first year of the pandemic? Given the declines in achievement and enrollment observed in every other study, and the apparent decline in the ability of educators to engage students in a pandemic, we expected similar declines in high school graduation and the transition to college. For college entry, our results confirmed our expectation. The transitions from high school to college dropped significantly—by 16 percent in two-year colleges and 6 percent in four-year colleges in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic period. In 2022, two-year entry dropped even further, by 21 percent, whereas four-year entry rebounded to just 2 percent below 2019 levels.\n\nBut we find a very different pattern for high school graduation, which actually increased slightly in 2020, dipped slightly in 2021, and then rebounded in 2022 to an all-time high. As far as we know, high school graduation was the only educational outcome to improve during the pandemic. Given the decline in the quality and engagement of schooling during this period, this is a somewhat surprising result.3\n\nSecond, how did educational attainment patterns vary by student subgroup and sector? We found that the improvement in high school graduation was broad based. Though marginalized groups saw larger drops in 2021, they also saw larger rebounds in 2022. For every subgroup, high school graduation rates were at least as high in the spring of 2022 as in the pre-pandemic spring of 2019—and in some groups notably higher.\n\nCollege entry, however, saw sharp drops, especially in two-year colleges serving high percentages of Black and Hispanic students. The changes were more muted at the four-year college level, and change seemed to be associated with colleges’ racial and ethnic composition rather than their economic levels. The rise in racial and ethnic inequality in college entry is a sign that COVID may have long-lasting effects on economic inequality.\n\nThird, what policy and environmental factors explain variation in the pandemic’s effects in different institutions and states? Prior studies have focused on how schools and colleges varied in their COVID instructional modes. But, especially with high school graduation and the transition to college, the human capital model suggests that a variety of other factors were likely at play, including a change in academic standards and opportunity cost (labor-market opportunities) for teenagers. We include proxies for these and other explanations in an interrupted time series analysis that includes district-institution fixed effects and unit-specific time trends. Despite the noted differing trends in high school graduation and college entry, variation in these trends nationally can be explained by common factors. Lower numbers of COVID cases and higher levels of in-person instruction led to increased college entry and possibly increased higher graduation. Relaxation of high school graduation standards is the one factor that seems to explain the differing trends because, anecdotally, high school educators were directed to ease the burden on students during the difficult pandemic period. We find some direct evidence of this in states with high school graduation exams that also reduced their academic standards and saw higher graduation rates during the pandemic. Finally, differential labor-market opportunities do not seem to explain variation in any of the attainment measures.\n\nFourth, why are the results so different across the various age groups and levels of the educational system? We observe four main patterns when we juxtapose our results with prior studies: smaller enrollment declines in high school than in earlier grades; larger declines in kindergarten than in other elementary grades (Dee and Murphy 2021; Dee et al. 2021; Musaddiq et al. 2022); small increases in high school graduation but large declines in the transition from high school to college; and larger declines in two-year than in four-year college enrollment.\n\nWe offer three plausible explanations for these patterns based on social science research. First, entry, persistence, and completion are different processes. Both kindergarten and college entry are forms of entry and were negatively affected by the pandemic, whereas high school graduation, a form of persistence, was much less affected. Second, one reason for the difference between entry and persistence is that teenagers’ social bonds to their friends make them likely to persist in and complete high school and college once they have entered. Last, two-year colleges and students differ from those at the four-year college level in multiple ways that may explain the larger drops in two-year college enrollment.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nConsiderable attention has been paid to learning loss during the pandemic. Here we extend the literature to focus more on educational attainment. Our preliminary results suggest that high school graduation did not decline during the pandemic—in fact, it increased to an all-time high. In contrast, the immediate transition to two-year colleges was the most negatively affected outcome, dropping by 21 percent two years after the onset of the pandemic. The results were consistently worse for students of color across types of attainment—high school graduation, two-year college entry, and four-year college entry.\n\nWe also examined variation in outcome trends across schools and colleges. Instructional mode and COVID cases both predicted educational attainment, especially college entry but perhaps in high school as well. The reduction in academic standards also seems to have propped up high school graduation rates, perhaps especially for white students and those with disabilities.\n\nIn addition to trying to understand heterogeneity between educational institutions (such as variation in graduation across high schools), we have identified distinctive patterns in attainment across ages and levels from K–16: high school enrollment and graduation increased while other forms of attainment decreased; entry dropped more than persistence and completion; and entry and enrollment dropped more in two-year colleges. We pose hypotheses for each pattern, and additional research is necessary to test them, but the analysis provides a general sense that these patterns that initially seem erratic were actually fairly predictable.\n\nWe note some limitations of the present analysis. COVID created a complex set of interconnected reactions that make it difficult to tease out cause and effect. We have advanced on prior research by considering a variety of factors simultaneously but recognize the difficulties involved in isolating the role each played. Also, even though the IPEDS college data include almost all colleges, we do note issues, especially with the subgroup trends in high school graduation, where missing data are especially high and where robustness checks yield some different conclusions.\n\nThe social welfare implications of all of this are a bit unclear. Of course, young people (and older people) are worse off because of COVID, educationally and otherwise. But the relevant question is whether the educational system could have responded better, given the pandemic circumstances. The actual policy response, at both the high school and college level, entailed educational institutions trying to serve students in ways as near as possible to the prior norm, given social distancing rules. One alternative would have been to engage in much less social distancing (more in-person instruction) and serve students exactly as before, but many families were worried about the pandemic and many students—and their teachers—simply would not have shown up; and spread the virus more when they did. Another option might have been to require students, at least at the high school level, to repeat the year and try to catch up. This, too, would have come at considerable cost as high schools would have had to continue serving both incoming and repeating students at the same time. Adding a year also likely would have led some students, eager to finish their schooling and move on, to drop out. Good options were simply not available.\n\nWhat do these results mean for long-term educational attainment? Will students return to their prior patterns? It seems quite likely that the kindergarteners who redshirted over the past two years will eventually enter school and that these students will continue through the schooling system. But students who have already started school learned less and will therefore be less prepared for higher grades. Also, research suggests that students who do not start college immediately after high school have a lower probability of ever entering or graduating. The lower entry rates we observe therefore signal a likely persistent decline in attainment.\n\nWhat we do know with more certainty is that human capital declined during the pandemic. Even with high school graduation, which is now at an all-time high, the reduction in standards means that this, too, is a signal of repercussions to come—for students, schools, and college alike—and especially for the most disadvantaged among us.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\nOpen Access Policy: RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences is an open access journal.
