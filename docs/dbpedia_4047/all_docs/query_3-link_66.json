However, they won’t all necessarily be a great fit for you. All of these colleges in Tennessee have programs and qualities that make them unique. So, finding the best colleges in Tennessee for you will require some research.\n\nCollege size and setting\n\nFirst off, you might want to consider college size. Generally, schools can be categorized as small, medium, or large universities. For example, there’s a big difference between a school with an undergraduate population of 7,111, like Vanderbilt, and 25,067, like the University of Tennessee – Knoxville. Smaller schools tend to have tighter-knit communities, whereas larger schools often have opportunities to be a part of a diverse student body.\n\nYou’ll also want to take into account the college setting. The top colleges in Tennessee are located in different types of cities that will impact your college experience. Think about whether you want a more urban or rural setting. Rural areas often have beautiful natural landscapes for hikers, runners, and outdoorsy people. A more urban college location, by contrast, can mean more exciting cultural experiences and opportunities for jobs and internships in various fields.\n\nEducational differences\n\nWhile you can expect to receive a strong education at all of the best colleges in the US, colleges in Tennessee will each have a unique approach. You may benefit from a more specialized, narrowed concentration in your chosen field. Or, you may want a liberal arts education with a more interdisciplinary curriculum. While the best colleges in Tennessee are all great schools, be sure to check out your specific major’s department and see if their offerings align with your interests.\n\nYou’ll also want to consider whether you’re open to both public and private colleges in Tennessee. Public colleges can be more affordable for in-state students, whereas private colleges often offer more need-based financial aid. All of the TN best colleges have financial aid websites where you can learn more about specific costs.\n\nBest Colleges in Tennessee Takeaways\n\nAfter reviewing this guide, we hope you see how many great colleges in Tennessee there are.
