        "text": "Bridging the gap between education and incarceration, six people in Tiptonville, Tennessee, recently got their bachelor's degrees through a historic collaboration with Lane College, a historically Black college in Jackson.\n\nThe Tennessee Higher Education in Prison Initiative allows inmates to earn associate's, bachelor's and even master's degrees.\n\nRichard Donnell, senior adviser to the president at Lane College in Jackson, wrote the proposal for the college to participate in the Second Chance Pell Experiment program. He added the program's belief is education can reduce recidivism, meaning inmates who get degrees are less likely to go back to prison.\n\nHe noted in July, Congress restored the eligibility of incarcerated people to receive Pell grants so they can pursue college degrees.\n\n\"We are all pleased that we were able to get involved in it and to educate these young men,\" Donnell stated. \"Which goes right toward our mission is to serve those who are underprivileged, and those who are deprived, disadvantaged. And so we're just fulfilling our mission and offering the education to them.\"\n\nDonnell pointed out individuals who have experienced incarceration often face greater challenges in securing employment compared with those who have not been in prison. This accomplishment plays a pivotal role in their reintegration into society, making it more likely for them to find employment, start a business or pursue a profession.\n\nLinda J. Theus, chair of the business department at Lane College, taught several subjects including personal finance, a class she said everyone needs daily. She emphasized the students learned practical money skills such as saving, spending less and simply being smart with their finances.\n\n\"One of the things that they really honed in on is money management, management skills, budgeting, how to invest your money, how to be conservative,\" Theus outlined. \"Just simple things that they had not thought about and hindsight, you know, how to just be frugal. \"\n\nTheus added they are working with 11 students in the second cohort and some already have associate degrees from Dyersburg State Community College or equivalent coursework.\n\nSupport for this reporting was provided by Lumina Foundation.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nIndigenous populations have long faced barriers in pursuing higher education and Minnesota's new free college tuition program could help put some of these dreams within reach.\n\nThis fall, the state launched its North Star Promise initiative, where households earning below $80,000 qualify for free tuition at state colleges and universities. Experts said limited scholarships are one of the many obstacles Native Americans encounter in the world of higher education.\n\nAnna Sheppard, president of White Earth Tribal and Community College, does not sense the new program will lead to a big enrollment boost but for students receiving aid, it could take their college journey to greater heights.\n\n\"What I really appreciate is that they're not going to have to graduate having debt,\" Sheppard emphasized. \"Maybe they're going to pursue a master's or doctoral, so then they don't have to worry about that.\"\n\nShe noted juggling student loans and other college debt often limits Indigenous populations from obtaining advanced degrees. Research from the Postsecondary National Policy Institute shows that between 2010 and 2020, there was an 18% decrease in graduate enrollment among Native Americans.\n\nAt White Earth, Sheppard noted the possibility of more students from tribal areas means they could be learning about in-demand careers and technology, such as solar energy.\n\n\"On top of that, we do have a solar array on campus, so they get to see one that's actually an operation,\" Sheppard explained. \"Right now, that powers our extension-customized education building.\"\n\nShe suggested the solar classes they provide, including learning how to install panels, put the students in a better position after graduation with more projects coming on board in Minnesota. Industry leaders said they are having a harder time filling jobs, increasingly offering good pay and benefits.\n\nSupport for this reporting was provided by Lumina Foundation.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nSome North Dakota community colleges and technical schools have had success when it comes to student enrollment but they have not been able to avoid challenges seen nationwide in hiring enough faculty.\n\nThe National Education Association said across the U.S., the number of faculty at two-year institutions declined 5% in the past decade, with two in three community colleges seeing declines averaging 17%.\n\nLisa Karch, executive vice president of academic affairs at the North Dakota State College of Science, said they have had ups and downs with staff retention, noting there were a few unfilled openings to start this academic year. She argued it is vital to have enough instructors to keep specialized class sizes smaller.\n\n\"For our labs, it really comes down to a safety issue,\" Karch pointed out. \"Whether it's a welding lab or a diesel lab or HVAC or plumbing.\"\n\nShe stressed they have accelerated efforts to have succession planning with more faculty retirements expected in the near future. The school also launched a new program where existing staff get additional training support on innovation related to their course material, making their professional development demands less of a burden.\n\nBismarck State College, which offers a mix of two-year and four-year degree options, reports difficulty in competing with the private market.\n\nDan Leingang, vice president of academic affairs at the school, said certain faculty are being wooed by job opportunities too hard to pass up.\n\n\"What we're seeing is a salary differential,\" Leingang observed. \"Especially in highly technical fields, where the industry is paying very strong wages because of the demand.\"\n\nPublic schools have a harder time matching such offers. But Leingang added they are taking advantage of higher enrollment numbers and reinvesting the revenue into faculty salaries and bonuses. Like the State College of Science, they are also leaning on industry leaders within the region to serve as part-time faculty to help fill gaps and ensure students get a comprehensive learning experience.\n\nSupport for this reporting was provided by Lumina Foundation.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nAs the economy continues to struggle with inflation and ongoing fears of a potential recession, a new report found the nation's labor market will add more good jobs in the next decade.\n\nSkilled trades will offer solid career pathways and are even more promising due to massive public and corporate investment in infrastructure and the transition to green energy.\n\nArtem Gulish, senior federal policy adviser in the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University and co-author of the report, said most good jobs will require bachelor's degrees or specialized credentials.\n\n\"Sixty-six percent of good jobs will go to workers with a bachelor's degree or higher, and 15% will go to workers with a high school diploma or less,\" Gulish reported.\n\nA good job is defined as paying at least $43,000 a year and a median annual salary of $74,000 for workers age 25 to 44. West Virginia is among five states with the greatest expected share of jobs for workers with a high school diploma or less, according to data from the Center.\n\nThe mass exit of baby boomers from the workforce and artificial intelligence in the coming decade will cause shifts in many sectors of the economy. Gulish pointed out blue-collar jobs such as construction, health care, maintenance and repair will increasingly require postsecondary training.\n\n\"Those jobs are increasingly going to be shifting to middle-skills workers with more specialized skills,\" Gulish emphasized.\n\nThe report also pointed to job quality beyond salary in the future jobs landscape, including access to health care plans and retirement benefits. The data show 89% of workers in the highest wage bracket have access to health care plans and retirement benefits, compared with only 30% of workers in the lowest bracket. Flexible work schedules and access to wellness programs are more common among in higher-income jobs.\n\nSupport for this reporting was provided by Lumina Foundation.\n\nget more stories like this via email"
