I love to find new trails, go to the beach, or go jet-skiing! After Lynn, I hope to have built meaningful connections and made a lot of memories!\n\nKathleen Scott '24\n\nBoca Raton, Florida, Psychology\n\n[email protected]\n\nMusic has been a huge part of my life since I was little, so finding a good conservatory was essential for me. The conservatory and faculty here at Lynn are amazing and are really helping me prepare for a career in music! Outside of the classroom, I enjoy swimming, drawing, and reading! After Lynn, I hope to pursue my master's degree and work towards getting a job in an orchestra!\n\nOlivia Oakland '25\n\nBoca Raton, Florida, Performance: Strings, Woodwinds, Brass, Harp & Percussion\n\n[email protected]\n\nI chose Lynn because its close to home and the classes are small. Outside of class, I like hanging out with friends, going to see any new marvel movie, or just playing video games. After getting my bachelor's in biology, I plan on to continue my education by applying to vet schools.\n\nBrian Manzanares '24\n\nCoral Springs, Florida, Biology\n\n[email protected]"
