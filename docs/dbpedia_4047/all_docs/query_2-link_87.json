In addition to a bar examination, there are character, fitness, and other qualifications for admission to the bar in every US jurisdiction. Applicants are encouraged to determine the requirements for any jurisdiction in which they intend to seek admission by contacting the jurisdiction. Addresses for all relevant agencies are available through the National Conference of Bar Examiners.\n\nFirst Year Students | Double Ducks | Transfer Students | International Students\n\nFirst Year (1L) Application Requirements\n\nApplication for Admission – You must submit your application through the Law School Admission Council.

If you are admitted to the law school, a financial institution must certify that you possess the necessary resources to cover educational and living expenses while in the United States.\n\nApplication Deadlines\n\nWe accept applications throughout the year, and offer admission on a rolling basis, so long as space remains in the incoming class. However, applications received in late spring or summer may be at a disadvantage in the admissions process.\n\nAdmission decisions are historically made between January and May, and applicants are notified of the decision by email. If you are offered admission, you are required to make a nonrefundable seat deposit of $600, payable in two installments, to reserve your place in the class. Deposit deadlines are included in the letter of admission, and failure to meet a seat deposit deadline could result in the loss of your seat.\n\nAlready Applied?\n\nClick on the button below to check your application status, or call the Office of Admissions at 541-346-3846.\n\nCheck Your Application Status"
