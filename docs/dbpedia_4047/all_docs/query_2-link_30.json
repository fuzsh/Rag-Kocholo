        "text": "Dalton State College (DSC) is a unit of the University System of Georgia (USG) and is governed by the policies of the Board of Regents of the University System. DSC adheres to the academic standards set by the USG, and students of DSC have no difficulty transferring credits to other colleges and universities in the system. Dalton State College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate and associate degrees. Dalton State College also may offer credentials such as certificates and diplomas at approved degree levels. Questions about the accreditation of Dalton State College may be directed in writing to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097, by calling (404) 679-4500, or by using information available on SACSCOC’s website (www.sacscoc.org).\n\nDalton State College operates on the semester system, with each of the academic year semesters extending over a period of approximately sixteen weeks. The basic unit of credit at Dalton State College is the semester hour. This unit normally represents one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours out-of-class student work each week over the course of a 15-week semester. The number of semester hours of credit awarded for a course is specified in the course description.\n\nACADEMIC ADVISING\n\nAcademic advisors are assigned to each student as they begin their studies at Dalton State College. In addition to course selection and registration, advisors help students adjust to the College experience by explaining College expectations and policies, checking the students' academic progress, and referring them to available resources.\n\nIn most degree programs, once students have exited all required learning support classes and completed a designated number of credit hours, they are assigned to faculty advisors in their majors. Faculty advisors will continue to assist with students’ academic plan with a greater focus on mentoring and specific career paths. In other degree programs, a self-contained model is used, and the advising continues through the advising center.\n\nRecognizing that advising is a shared responsibility, the mission of Academic Advising at Dalton State is to:\n\nAssist students in make a successful transition to and establish their place in college life.\n\nGuide student to make well-intentioned and strategic decisions.\n\nEncourage self-reliant problem solving through self-exploration.\n\nMaximize personal success in the student's undergraduate experience.\n\nACADEMIC HONORS\n\nThe Dean’s List, published at the end of each semester, includes the names of students who are in good standing and earn a grade point average of 3.5 or above for 12 or more semester hours of completed course work. Please note that learning support courses are not included in the GPA calculations for the semester.\n\nACADEMIC PROGRESS\n\nAcademic Warning: When a student’s Institutional or current term GPA drops below 2.0, the student’s status is automatically changed from Good Standing to Academic Warning. Students with Academic Warning status are permitted full enrollment privileges but are encouraged to take lighter course loads and to retake classes in their program of study that will improve their Institutional GPA. Students may remain in Academic Warning as long as their previous term’s GPA is at least 2.0; however, students who are in exceptional academic difficulty (term GPA below 1.0) will have their status changed from Good Standing to Academic Probation.\n\nAcademic Probation: Students in Academic Warning status who do not earn a 2.0 or higher term grade point average will have their status changed to Academic Probation. As stated above, students who are in exceptional academic difficulty (term GPA below 1.0) will have their status changed from Good Standing to Academic Probation. Students with Academic Probation status cannot enroll for more than 9 credit hours or take classes using non-traditional course delivery methods (e.g., hybrid or online) unless they have previously been successful with these delivery modes. In addition to retaking classes in their program of study that will improve their Institutional GPA, students must be registered by their academic advisor. Previously registered students will need to have schedule adjustments made. Students may remain in Academic Probation as long as their previous term’s GPA is at least a 2.0. Students will be reinstated to Good Standing when they achieve an Institutional GPA of 2.0 or greater.\n\nAcademic Suspension: Students in Academic Probation status who do not earn a 2.0 or higher GPA in their most recent semester of enrollment will have their status changed to Academic Suspension. Students on Academic Suspension cannot enroll for the subsequent Fall or Spring semester. To initiate an appeal of an academic suspension, the student must complete an Academic Suspension Appeal Form. Click here to access the form. The Office of Academic Affairs will review the appeal and email the student with a decision. Students on Suspension may not take online courses.\n\nAcademic Dismissal: Upon readmission to the College, the student will be subject to the requirements of Academic Probation status. If the student does not earn a 2.0 or higher term GPA, the student will be placed on Academic Dismissal. The student cannot enroll for one calendar year. The student will need to be readmitted through the Admissions office.\n\nOnce readmitted to the College, the student will be subject to the requirements of Academic Probation status. If the student does not earn a 2.0 or greater term GPA, the student will be dismissed again. These students cannot enroll for two calendar years unless they have earned an associate degree from an accredited institution.\n\nACADEMIC RENEWAL\n\nThe academic renewal policy allows University System of Georgia degree-seeking students who have experienced academic difficulty to make a fresh start and have one final opportunity to earn an associate or bachelor’s degree. Former students may apply for academic renewal under the following circumstances:\n\nThey have not been enrolled (not on dismissal) at any higher education institution in the past three years.\n\nThey completed all learning support requirements prior to the three years of absence.\n\nThe granting of academic renewal does not supersede financial aid policies regarding satisfactory academic progress. Students must apply for academic renewal within the first year of re-enrollment. Contact the Office of Enrollment Services for more information and to request an application for academic renewal. Click HERE to for full policy and application.\n\nAPPLICATION FOR GRADUATION\n\nAll candidates for degrees and certificates must submit an application for graduation to the Enrollment Services Office, by the published due date, for the term in which they anticipate completing graduation requirements. According to the repeat grade policy, if a course is repeated, only the most recent attempt will count toward graduation requirements.\n\nStudents who fail to apply by the graduation application deadline may forfeit the chance to adjust any errors or omissions made in their programs and may not be eligible for graduation.\n\nStudents may satisfy the curricular requirements for a degree or certificate by completing the program of study listed in the catalog in effect during their initial enrollment in the College, or they may complete their program of study under the catalog in effect at the time of their graduation. However, a student will be required to satisfy the curricular requirements of the catalog in effect at the time when they:\n\nchange programs of study;\n\nare required to complete a course for which a prerequisite has been established since the student’s initial enrollment, in which case the prerequisite must be fulfilled;\n\nre-enter the College after one calendar year in which they earned no academic credit at Dalton State College;\n\nhave not graduated by the time their entering catalog edition is 10 years old. However, if a major has been deactivated students have one year to complete a certificate from the time the major is deactivated and two years to complete a deactivated associate degree major from the time of deactivation.\n\nGraduation is held twice a year, at the end of the Fall and Spring Terms. Diplomas and certificates are awarded at these exercises. Students who complete graduation requirements at the end of Summer and Fall Terms will be awarded the appropriate diplomas or certificates at the Fall graduation exercises. Students completing graduation requirements at the end of Spring Term will be awarded diplomas and certificates at the Spring graduation exercises.\n\nAll students who complete requirements for degrees or certificates are encouraged to participate in the graduation exercises. Graduates who do not attend the exercises will receive their diploma or certificate at the address on their official record. Click HERE for application.\n\nCLASS ATTENDANCE\n\nStudents are expected to attend all scheduled class sessions. These may include field trips, seminars, and individual conferences, as well as lectures and laboratory sessions. The instructor will explain the attendance policy at the beginning of each class and print it in the class syllabi. Absences may result in a grade reduction.\n\nCLASS LOAD\n\nAn average load for a full-time student consists of 15-18 credit hours per semester. The College reserves the right to limit the class load of students who have received below-average grades (see Academic Progress).\n\nStudents may receive permission from the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs to enroll for more than the average load if they have a cumulative average above 3.0, or if they are in their last semester of enrollment before graduation.\n\nCLASS SCHEDULE\n\nThe courses required for most degree and certificate programs are available during day, afternoon, and evening. However, some are scheduled only during day or only evening class periods. Courses may also be offered in traditional, online, or hybrid formats. Information about the scheduling of specific courses may be obtained from the academic advisors, the Office of Enrollment Services, or the Office of Academic Affairs.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS\n\nStudents are classified as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors. At the beginning of each term, those with credit for fewer than 30 semester hours are classified as freshmen; with 30-59 hours, as sophomores; with 60-89 hours, as juniors; with 90 or more hours as seniors.\n\nStudents are considered full-time if they register for 12 or more semester credit hours; students who enroll in fewer than 12 semester hours are considered part-time.\n\nDROPPING OR CHANGING CLASSES\n\nChanges in schedules may be made the first week of classes. Dropping a class before the published date is permitted through the Roadrunner Portal, with advisor permission. Please see the academic calendar for specific dates.\n\nIf a course is officially dropped by the published drop date, the student will receive a “W.” If a student drops a course after the published drop date, a grade of “WF” is recorded. If a student ceases to attend a course without officially dropping, a grade of “F” is recorded.\n\nStudents receiving financial aid should be aware that enrollment status is determined at the end of the drop/add period at the beginning of each semester. A student receiving financial aid may owe money back to a financial aid program if his or her enrollment status changes after the drop/add period.\n\nGRADES AND SYMBOLS\n\nThe following grades are approved by the University System for use by Dalton State College in the determination of the grade point average. Note: Grades of A*, B*, C*, D* and F* are used to denote grades in co-curricular learning support classes and are not included in the students' grade point average.\n\nGrading Grade Description Quality Points A Excellent 4 B Good 3 C Satisfactory 2 D Passing 1 F Failure 0 WF Withdrew, Failing 0\n\nThe following symbols are approved for use in the cases indicated but are not included in determination of the grade point average.\n\nGrading Symbols Symbol Description > This symbol, when attached to a course grade, indicates an approved STEM course. For HOPE GPA calculations only, A> receives 4.0 quality points, B> receives 3.5 quality points, C> receives 2.5 quality points, D> receives 1.5 quality points, and F> receives 0.0 quality points. For other calculations, these grades follow the standard values as shown in the preceding table. I This symbol indicates that a student was doing satisfactory work but, for non-academic reasons beyond the student's control, was unable to meet the full requirements of the course. Student must have completed most of the major assignments of the course (generally all but one) and be earning a passing grade in the course (aside from the assignments not completed). When a student has a non-academic reason for not completing one or more of the assignments for a course, including examinations, and wishes to receive an incomplete for the course, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor in person or in writing of the reason. Upon receipt of the reason, a grade of \"I\" is awarded at the discretion of the instructor. Conditions to be met for removing a grade of \"I\" are established by the instructor. The \"I\" must be removed by the end of the next term of enrollment or the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services will change the \"I\" to \"F.\" Without regard to enrollment, the \"I\" must be removed within one year or it will be changed to an \"F.\" IP This symbol indicates that credit has not been given or that a student was passing a remedial course but did not pass the exit exam. It is considered a final grade for Learning Support courses. K This symbol indicates that a student was awarded credit for the course by Examination (CLEP, AP, SAT II, or institutional examination). NR This symbol means that a grade was Not Reported. S This symbol indicates satisfactory performance. U This symbol indicates unsatisfactory performance. V This symbol indicates that a student audited the course. Enrollment status in a course cannot be changed from audit to credit or credit to audit after the add period ends. W This symbol indicates that a student officially withdrew from a course by the published day to drop classes without penalty. After this date, withdrawal is permitted only in cases of extreme, non-academic hardship which prevent the student from completing the term and must be approved by the Dean of Students office. WM This symbol indicates that a student was permitted to withdraw for military service without penalty at any time during the term. WU This symbol indicates that a student dropped or withdrew, from a remedial course, after the last day to drop without penalty. UF This symbol indicates Failure due to lack of attendance.\n\nGRADE CHANGES AND APPEALS\n\nThe assignment of grades and symbols is the responsibility of the instructor. Any change in an assigned grade or symbol must be recommended by the instructor who assigned the original grade or symbol and be approved by the Dean, and Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. A final course grade may be changed only if there is unequivocal evidence that one or more of the following applies:\n\nIt was a direct result of arbitrary and capricious conduct on the part of the instructor.\n\nThe instructor discriminated against the student on the basis of a protected classification as the term is defined by Federal Law, Georgia State Law, or the Administrative Code of the City of Dalton.\n\nThe grade was incorrectly calculated, or a clerical error occurred in recording the grade.\n\nA mitigating circumstance prevented the student from completing a final assignment or attending the final examination.\n\nA student may file a formal challenge to a grade on any of the grounds listed above. The student must present positive, detailed, and specific evidence in support of his or her claim.\n\nThe student must notify the instructor in writing no later than three days after the deadline for posting grades. The instructor must confer with the student and inform the student in writing whether he or she will change the grade within five days of receiving the student’s notification. In the event Dalton State College no longer employs the instructor a student must notify the instructor’s department chair or dean if the school does not have department chairs.\n\nIf the instructor declines to change the grade or has not met the deadline, the student may appeal to the instructor’s department chair or the dean if the school does not have department chairs. The department chair (or dean) will meet with the instructor and the student to mediate the appeal. The department chair or dean must notify the student with a decision, in writing, no later than one day after the mediation.\n\nIf the student is dissatisfied with the department chair or dean’s decision, he or she may submit the appeal with appropriate documentation to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.\n\nThe Provost/VPAA or designee shall convene a meeting of an ad hoc Grade Appeals Committee as soon as possible to resolve the issue within two weeks of receiving the grade appeal. The committee’s decision is made on the day of the meeting and communicated verbally to the student, followed by a written confirmation of the decision.\n\nA student appealing a grade may be allowed to continue with his or her program of study until a final decision is made on the appeal depending upon the policy of the program. This policy may vary among schools, and the student is directed to the school’s handbook for further information.\n\nGrade Appeals Committee\n\nThe ad hoc grade appeal committee shall consist of the following individuals:\n\nProvost and Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) or designee.\n\nDean of the school involved in the appeal.\n\nVice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management or designee (non-voting member of the committee).\n\nThree faculty members: two from any of the school's other departments that are not directly involved with the appeal and one faculty member from another school.\n\nOne student representative within the school but not in the program.\n\nNote: In the School of Education, the two faculty members selected should not currently be teaching the student appealing the grade, and the one student representative from within the school should not be in the same block as the student who is appealing the grade.\n\nThe committee shall be deemed to have a quorum when the Provost and Vice President (or designee), the Dean, the Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Services (or designee), and two additional committee members convene to review a grade appeal.\n\nMeeting of the Grade Appeals Committee\n\nThe Grade Appeals Committee meeting shall be convened by the Provost and VPAA as needed. The committee shall invite the instructor and student to the meeting and consider any evidence which the student, the instructor, or the committee deems relevant. Should the student decline to meet with the committee, the committee may determine cases based on the submitted written arguments and supporting documents alone.\n\nThe student shall have the right to use an advisor of his or her choosing (at his or her own expense) for advice and counsel. An advisor can be, but is not limited to, a parent, fellow student, faculty member, coach, or attorney. The advisor may be present during meetings and proceedings at which his or her advisee is present. The advisor may advise his or her advisee in any manner, including providing questions, suggestions, and guidance on responses to any questions of the advisee, but shall not participate directly.\n\nThe institution shall not prohibit family members of a party from attending if the party requests such attendance in addition to another advisor; however, the College may limit each participant to two family members. Delays will not be allowed due to scheduling conflicts of advisors or family members. Every effort will be made to keep the committee's investigation confidential.\n\nThe committee will vote after its deliberation, and a final decision will be made by simple majority. In case of a tie, the decision will be determined by the Provost and VPAA. The Office of the VPAA will issue the committee's decision in writing to the student and instructor and provide copies to the chair and the dean. If the committee determines that the grade should be changed, a Grade Change Form will be sent from the Office of the VPAA to the Registrar to process the grade change. The decision of the Grade Appeals Committee may be appealed to the President of the College.\n\nGRADE REPORTS\n\nCourse grades are posted at midterm and the end of each semester, and students may access their grades on the student portal. Grades are not mailed to students.

The faculty reserves the right to require additional tests, special examinations or certifications that may be appropriate to establish the competence of potential graduates.\n\nCertification by the Vice President for Fiscal Affairs that all financial obligations to the College have been satisfactorily discharged.\n\nDOUBLE MAJOR IN BACCALAUREATE PROGRAMS\n\nStudents enrolled in baccalaureate programs may seek a double major in the same degree (i.e. a Bachelor of Science with majors in Biology and Chemistry) by completing the requirements for the two separate majors simultaneously. A double major is earned when the requirements for the major in each of the two program areas are satisfied and the requirements for the degree are satisfied. It is sometimes possible to count the same course twice, once in each major, thus satisfying the major requirements. Double majors are only permitted in certain programs of study. Students seeking a double major must graduate with both in the same semester. One diploma will be issued for the degree conferred. Each major will be reflected on the student's official transcript. Students should be aware of the impact of Financial Aid.\n\nSECOND OR SUBSEQUENT DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES\n\nAny student applying for a second or subsequent associate degree or certificate must complete eighteen (18) semester hours of academic credit with a grade of C or 2.0 or better earned at Dalton State College, excluding credit-by-examination, which have not been applied to the requirements of a previous degree or certificate.

The eighteen (18) and thirty-six (36) hours constitute a “residence requirement” and may be taken on the main campus or at any extended campus site of Dalton State College.\n\nGRADUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS\n\nStudents transferring to Dalton State College will be evaluated by the same standards of academic progress applied to native students. In order to graduate, a transfer student must have both a minimum graduation grade point average of 2.00 on all Dalton State College courses used to complete graduation requirements and a cumulative minimum graduation grade point average of 2.00 for all courses (both Dalton State College courses and transfer courses) used to complete graduation requirements.\n\nGRADUATION WITH HONORS\n\nStudents who achieve superior academic averages on all coursework completed at Dalton State College and who complete all requirements for graduation receive diplomas or certificates inscribed with honor designations.\n\nHonors Honor Description BACHELOR AND ASSOCIATE DEGREE HONORS Cum Laude Grade point average of 3.5 to 3.74 Magna Cum Laude Grade point average of 3.75 to 3.99 Summa Cum Laude Grade point average of 4.0 CERTIFICATE HONORS With Merit Grade point average of 3.5 to 3.74 With Distinction Grade point average of 3.75 to 3.99 With Excellence Grade point average of 4.0\n\nStudents completing all requirements of the Dalton State College Honors Program will receive additional special designation on their diplomas.\n\nHOPE GPA\n\nFor purposes of calculating HOPE Scholarship eligibility, the total number of quality points earned at every higher education institution attended since high school graduation is divided by the total number of academic semester hours attempted at all institutions in which a grade of A, B, C, D, F, or WF, has been received. Grades of K, V, S, U, I, IP, WM and WU are excluded from the GPA calculation.\n\nINSTITUTIONAL GPA/GRADUATION AVERAGE\n\nThe institutional GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points earned at Dalton State College by the total number of academic semester hours attempted in which a grade of A, B, C, D, F, or WF has been received. If a student repeats a course, only the most recent attempt will be figured in the institutional GPA calculation. The institutional GPA is used to determine a student’s academic progress (probation, suspension, and exclusion) and for graduation. Students are expected to achieve an institutional GPA of 2.0 or higher for graduation. Students should understand that most institutions use the cumulative average, which includes all hours attempted and all grades earned, in determining the eligibility for transfer admission.\n\nREGENTS' GPA/CUMULATIVE AVERAGE\n\nThe Regents’ GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points earned at by the total number of academic semester hours attempted in which a grade of A, B, C, D, F, or WF has been received. This average is used for determining eligibility for special honors and is the average that appears on the student’s permanent record. All “institutional credit” hours and grades are excluded from the cumulative average. Learning Support courses carry institutional credit.\n\nORIENTATION\n\nEvery student is expected to attend an orientation session prior to the start of his or her first term at Dalton State College. This session will provide detailed information regarding academic programs, student services, and registration procedures.\n\nPOLICY ON RELEASE OF STUDENT INFORMATION\n\nStudents in the University System of Georgia have the right to the assurance that their academic records, compiled and maintained by a unit within the System, will be recorded accurately and retained in confidence. Dalton State College follows the policy of the University System of Georgia on release of student information. A complete copy of this information is on file in the Office of Enrollment Services and is available for viewing by the student and authorized faculty.\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nAll students register for each term during announced registration periods. A student is regularly registered for a course only when all College requirements governing registration for the course have been met. Students not properly registered may not receive credit for courses completed. Any exception to this regulation must be approved by the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.\n\nTRANSCRIPTS\n\nOfficial Transcript Requests\n\nCurrent students can request transcripts through the Parchment Official Transcript Request link in their Roadrunner Portal.\n\nFormer or current students can visit Transcripts.
