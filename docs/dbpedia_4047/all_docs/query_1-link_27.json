        "text": "It was tough when I first got into lane tech, it was online, everything was over google meets, and I had no idea what was going on. All the teachers were so nice and helpful, they gave me all the information that I needed to know, and It was so nice despite only being over google meets. When I got on to the proceeding years I had some of the best teachers I have or think I will ever have in my life. I was able to challenge myself where I wanted(STEM) with all the classes that lane had(ap physics 2, multivariable calculus). I was also able to do about anything I wanted in computer science going from a game design class to a circuits class to getting me interested in microarchitecture despite not being able to take the course and showing me how to get a scholarship to get a cybersecurity certificate. The negatives of the school is that the people are very clique-y. I have had a lot of trouble getting to find people with myself barely going out with people outside of school or clubs"
