        "text": "This guide is designed to answer one question for you: How are you going to afford Lane College?\n\nYou probably know that planning for expenses is an important part of the college application process. What you may not know is how many different things you need to keep track of to pay tuition and apply for financial aid.\n\nHere's what we'll cover:\n\nHow much does Lane College tuition cost?\n\nHow much financial aid do students at Lane College usually get?\n\nHow much debt is typical for students at Lane College?\n\nHow much will Lane College cost YOU, and can you actually afford it?\n\nIs Lane College a good value for you?\n\nWhat are other schools that might be a better value than Lane College?\n\nBy learning more about expenses and aid, you’re already on the right path to managing college costs. Let’s get started!\n\nSchool location: Jackson, TN\n\nHow Much Does Lane College Cost?\n\nKnowing what a school costs is Step #1 in managing college costs. There’s more to think about than just the tuition—you also have to factor in where you'll live, what you'll eat, and more while attending Lane College.\n\nThe \"Cost of Attendance\" is the total amount of money the average student has to pay, WITHOUT any financial aid, to attend a particular school. Think of it as a school’s sticker price. It includes not just Lane College tuition and fees, but also room, board, textbooks, and personal expenses.\n\nHere’s the Cost of Attendance breakdown for Lane College:\n\nHow Much Financial Aid Do Students at Lane College Get?\n\nThe Cost of Attendance listed above might be intimidating. The good news is that most students don’t end up paying that full price to attend Lane College. Financial aid helps make up the difference between the Cost of Attendance and what families can actually afford.\n\nHere we'll cover how many students get Lane College financial aid, what types of aid they get, and how much.\n\nA Brief Intro to Financial Aid\n\nAid comes in many forms, including:\n\nNeed-based grants\n\nMerit-based scholarships\n\nStudent loans\n\nThis financial aid comes from a few different places:\n\nFederal aid comes from the federal government, or is subsidized by the federal government.\n\nInstitutional aid comes from your school itself.\n\nGenerally, it’s better for MORE students to receive HIGH amounts of financial aid—this means students pay less for college.\n\nLet’s take a look at how Lane College compares to other schools.\n\nOverall Aid\n\nLet's start with the overall numbers. At Lane College, we know that:\n\n99% of Students Get ANY Aid\n\nThis is 7% HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 92%.\n\nThis is good news - more students getting financial aid means students at Lane College are likely getting a pretty good deal on their education. It could also mean the school skews toward lower income students.\n\nNext, we'll look at actual aid amounts and student debt to dig deeper.\n\nGrants and Scholarships\n\nWe’re focusing on grants and scholarships first because they’re the most important forms of financial aid. Grants and scholarships are better than loans because students don’t ever have to pay them back. The more grant/scholarship aid students receive at a particular school, the better off those students are in the long run.\n\nAt Lane College, we know that:\n\n99% Get ANY Grant Money\n\nThis is 10% HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 89%.\n\nAlthough it’s useful to know how many students get grant aid, it’s also important to know how much grant aid people tend to receive. The bigger the average grant award, the better.\n\nSo how much grant money do students at Lane College tend to receive?\n\nAverage Grant Award: $6583\n\nThis is $9905 LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $16488.\n\nAltogether, this is mixed news - at Lane College, MORE students get aid, but the ones who do get LESS than average. This may mean that it's easier for you to qualify for Lane College financial aid, but the help you get will be lower than at other schools.\n\nHow Generous is Lane College’s Financial Aid?\n\nThe grant dollar amounts we’ve seen so far have included aid from all sources - both federal and institutional. Schools don’t have much control over how much federal aid students can qualify for (like Pell Grants), but they do their own financial aid dollars and how they’re used.\n\nTo figure out how strong Lane College’s own financial aid program is, we’ll look at how they award their own (non-federal) financial aid dollars. The more students receive aid directly from the school (otherwise known as institutional aid), and the bigger the award amounts, the better the financial aid program.\n\nLet’s see how generous Lane College is with its students:\n\n25% Get ANY School Grants\n\nThis is 57% LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 82%.\n\nBecause Lane College gives a smaller percentage of its students institutional grants than similar schools, it may offer less competitive financial aid.\n\nSome schools may claim to offer large amounts of aid to prospective students without advertising that much of this money may come in the form of student loans - money that you have to pay back. To figure out if this is the case, check out our following section on student loan debt at Lane College.\n\nThe amount of money that students actually get is just as important (if not more important) than the percent of students who get grants. If you receive a grant, you’ll want it to be big enough to do you some good.\n\nAverage School Grant: $2439\n\nThis is $11360 LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $13799.\n\nRight away, it seems like Lane College offers less institutional aid than other schools. This can mean a few things: first, students who do receive institutional grants may not get a competitive amount, compared to other schools.\n\nSecond, this can also mean that the school just costs less than the typical school of its type. If the school costs less, it makes sense for the average grant award to be lower.\n\nUp to this point, we've looked entirely at grants for Lane College. Next, we'll do the same analysis for student loans, which is where student debt comes from.\n\nHow Much Debt is Typical for Students at Lane College?\n\nAside from grants, the other major way to pay for college is with student loans. Student loans aren’t free sums of money - you borrow a certain amount to attend Lane College, and then pay it back with smaller monthly payments after you graduate.\n\nThe more student loan money you borrow, the more debt you’ll end up with after graduation. Ideally, you want to minimize your student debt as much as possible. Less debt means less of a financial burden once you leave school.\n\nIt’s generally a bad sign if a school has many students taking out a lot of loans. This indicates that graduates have to worry about paying back big sums of money once they leave school.\n\nTo address the amount and type of debt that students take on, this section will cover:\n\nLoan Overview\n\nFederal Loans\n\nOther Loans\n\nLet’s see what students at Lane College have to deal with:\n\nLoan Overview\n\nFirst, let’s talk about how many students at Lane College actually have to take out any student loans at all. The ideal goal is to graduate with little to no debt.\n\nIt’s very common for college grads in the US to graduate with some debt, but high percentages of students taking on loans at a particular school is a big red flag. In contrast, low percentages of students with loans is a sign that Lane College tuition is affordable.\n\nSo how many students actually end up taking out loans at Lane College?\n\n94% Have ANY Loans\n\nThis is 28% higher than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 66%.\n\nHigh numbers of students with loans is a red flag, and Lane College has a very high loan rate. Nearly every student has to take out loans to afford Lane College tuition and costs. This often means that the financial aid policy at the school is relatively weak, and grants aren't enough to cover total cost.\n\nIn the worst case, some schools, especially private for-profit colleges, provide subpar education for a very high cost. We'll talk more about this below.\n\nTo break this down further, we have to understand how much actual debt the average person takes out while in school. Next, we’ll look at student debt amounts.\n\nFederal Loans\n\nNow that you have a handle on the basic loan information for Lane College, we’ll get into some more nitty-gritty information on the types and amounts of loans that students typically have.\n\nWe’ll start with federal loans because, in general, federal loans are preferable to private loans. Federal loans tend to have low interest rates, which means they cost less in the long run. They may come with other perks (like subsidization or even options for loan forgiveness).\n\nHigh percentages or amounts of federal loans still isn’t a great sign - again, you don’t want to see students burdened with too much debt. Generally, schools with strong financial aid programs will have students with more federal loans than private loans.\n\nLet’s see how Lane College stacks up:\n\n94% Have Federal Loans\n\nAt Lane College, 94% of all students take out federal loans. This is 29% HIGHER than the average percent of students for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 65%.\n\nAverage Federal Loan: $6963\n\nAt Lane College, the average annual federal loan amount is $6963. This amount is $886 MORE than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $6077.\n\nWhat Would It Cost YOU to Attend Lane College?\n\nFinally, we get to the bottom line: what will Lane College actually cost YOU? Every family has a different situation, and depending on your income level, you'll have to pay more or less to go to college.\n\nWhat is Net Price, and Why Does it Matter?\n\nAbove, we've covered Lane College's Cost of Attendance (tuition, room and board, books, and more). We also covered its typical financial aid in grants, loans, and scholarships.\n\nThe Net Price is the total cost minus the total aid given. In other words, this is the price you have to pay to the school out of pocket. The lower the school's cost, and the more aid you get, the lower the Net Price.\n\nWe'll cover two ways to get your Net Price for Lane College - the fast way, and the precise way.\n\nNet Price: The Quick and Easy Way\n\nIf you want a quick, general idea of your annual Net Price at Lane College, here's a handy chart showing the net price of real students. All you need is your family income.\n\nIf your family makes between... Your Net Price will likely be around... $0 - $30,000 $10596 $30,001 - $48,000 $11754 $48,001 - $75,000 $11350 $75,001 - $110,000 N/A $110,000 and up N/A\n\nNote that these values may be a few years old, and today's prices may be a bit higher.\n\nAs we'll discuss next, your exact Net Price will depend on other factors like the number of family members and total assets, but this represents the typical Net Price.\n\nNet Price: The Most Accurate Method\n\nMost schools have an updated Net Price calculator available. To find it, just google \"Lane College Net Price Calculator\" - the official tool should be one of the top search results.\n\nOften the school will ask for more information than just income:\n\nThe number of people in your household\n\nThe number of family members in college\n\nParental wages, income, and assets\n\nStudent wages, income, and assets\n\nThis will take 10-15 minutes to complete, and you'll get a specific net price that's more accurate than the table above.\n\nCan You Afford to Attend Lane College?\n\nOnce you have a Net Price estimate, you’ll want to figure out whether your family can afford to pay Lane College tuition and costs. Once again, the Net Price is the total cost of attending, minus the aid you can expect to get (grants and scholarships). It's the amount you'd have to cover yourself.\n\nThe US government has come up with a standardized way to calculate how much a typical family can afford to pay without help. They call this the Expected Family Contribution, or EFC.\n\nAs an example, a family that brings home $80,000 in income before taxes, with no assets and no other children in college, has an EFC of around $7,000. This is the amount the government thinks that family can reasonably pay, and the school will have to step in and cover the rest.\n\nColleges use this number as a guideline to decide how much aid to give you, but it's just a guideline. Some schools will be stingier with aid, and you'll have to pay more than the government's suggested EFC.\n\nSo we're going to calculate your EFC and compare it to Lane College's Net Price. If the Net Price is higher than the EFC, the school will cost more than you can typically afford. It's a simple equation:\n\nNet Price - Expected Family Contribution = Deficit (extra cost you would need to cover)\n\nWe've constructed a simple tool to figure out whether Lane College is affordable for you:\n\nAffordability Calculator\n\nFinally: Is This Price Really Worth It?\n\nChances are, college won't be cheap. Even if you have a few top choice schools in mind like Lane College, it's still useful to explore broadly.\n\nA few questions to ponder:\n\nHow much better off will you be if you attend Lane College as opposed to a similar, but cheaper, school?\n\nHave you considered a range of private and public schools? Big and small?\n\nWhat if you didn't attend college at all? (This is extreme, but just worth considering even for a second.\n\nThese are the big picture questions to consider when we talk about the value of a college education.\n\nHere's our take: college will be a really important stage in your development. Going to a better, more reputable college will usually pay off in the long run. By going to a better college, you'll be surrounded by a more interesting community, find it easier to land a job, and open up opportunities.\n\nTo determine the value of Lane College, we're going to rely on reputable ranking lists. These consider factors like reputation, student selectivity, income after graduating, and more to determine the value of a school.\n\nValue Judgment\n\nSo how does Lane College stack up?\n\nWhat Other Schools Should You Consider?\n\nYour next step should be to get a better idea of costs and aid availability at similar schools. If you’re interested in Lane College, you should check out some other high-value schools that could give you more bang for your buck. Get started here to check both in-state and out-of-state schools that might provide a better value.\n\nBetter Value Schools\n\nFinally, we're going to look at schools that might offer a better value than Lane College. To compile this list, we first find schools at similar academic levels, so you have a similar chance at getting in. Then we select schools that better value for you, by being more affordable or having a higher quality of education"
