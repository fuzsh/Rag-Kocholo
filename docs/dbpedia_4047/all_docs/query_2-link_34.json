        "text": "Unlike high school, at college there is no supply list, and your textbooks are not provided. Many students are surprised by the additional cost of books or access codes for online content. Many items come down to personal preference, but a good planner, whether digital or paper, is a must! If you are an incoming freshman, you will be automatically signed up for the Brenau Book Bundle, a rental program that saves you time and money by bundling all of your books before the first day of class. Learn more about this program on the Brenau Book Bundle page.\n\nBrenau offers four interest-free payment options to help families choose the best option.\n\nOne-payment option\n\nTuition charges are due on or before the first day of each academic term semester during the academic year. Tuition may be paid through CampusWEB, by mail or in person at the Brenau Accounting Office or the North Atlanta location.\n\nThree-payment option\n\nYou can sign a Deferred Payment Contract to pay one-third of tuition on the first day of the academic term. The other two-thirds of the tuition will be paid in equal payments 30 days and 60 days from the first day of the academic term for a one-time fee of $35.\n\nFour-payment option\n\nYou can sign a Deferred Payment Contract to pay one-quarter of tuition on the first day of the academic term. The remaining three-fourths of the semester’s tuition will be paid in equal payments 30 days, 60 days and 90 days from the first day of the semester for a one-time fee of $50.\n\nFull year payment option\n\nYou can sign a Deferred Payment Contract to pay tuition over 10-monthly payments based on an estimate of the full academic year’s tuition/fees, The first payment is due on the first day of the semester. The remaining balance will be paid in nine equal payments due each month for a one-time fee of $75. . You must be an undergraduate or graduate student enrolled in Brenau’s day programs to qualify for the full-year payment option.\n\nFor many students, financial aid is one of the most important aspects of going to college. Our Financial Aid office has dedicated transfer counselors to assist you through the process. They can be reached by email at financialaid@brenau.edu or by phone at 770-534-6152.\n\nWe recommend that you begin the financial aid process as soon as you apply for admission.\n\nVisit fafsa.gov and complete the free application for Federal Student aid. This can be done as early as Oct. 1. Brenau’s FAFSA code is 001556.\n\nCreate a unique login (FSA ID) – if you don’t already have one.\n\nEligible Georgia residents should apply for the Georgia Tuition Equalization Grant and HOPE Scholarship at gafutures.org.\n\nVisit the Financial Aid Office webpage and Brenau’s Net Price Calculator to see what types of aid may be available.\n\nFrom StudentAid.gov:\n\nIf you have a Social Security number (SSN), you must provide it when creating your account.\n\nIf you don’t have an SSN, you can create an account if one of the following statements is true for you:\n\nI am a parent or spouse of a student who is applying for aid, and I don’t have an SSN.\n\nI am a citizen of the Freely Associated States and need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form online.\n\nWhile creating your account, you’ll need to answer a few knowledge-based questions to verify your identity. If you answer these questions correctly, you’ll be able to use your account immediately.\n\nNote that accounts created without SSNs have limited functionality.\n\nTo apply for an SSN, or to get a replacement Social Security card, you must contact your local Social Security office. For more information, you can visit the Social Security Administration or call at 1-800-722-1213.\n\nIf you create your FSA ID with a Social Security Number, it will take a few days to verify. Once the 2024-25 FAFSA is available to file, you should be able to start your FAFSA about 1-3 days after creating your FSA ID. To get a head start, you and your contributors can create your FSA IDs now using the Federal Student Aid website as long as you have a Social Security Number. If you go ahead and create your FSA IDs, you will be able to start the FAFSA as soon as it opens.\n\nSince contributors without a social security number must undergo a verification process to create their FSA IDs, those created without a Social Security number will be verified instantly and can start entering information on the FAFSA immediately.\n\nReport the information of the parent you’ve lived with the most during the 12 months before you completed your FAFSA. It doesn’t make a difference which parent claims you as a dependent for tax purposes. If you did not live with either parent or lived equally with each parent, the parental information must be provided for the parent who gave you the most financial support during the preceding 12 months, or the parent who provided you with the most support the last time support was given.\n\nBrenau University takes students’ safety and health seriously and has established guidelines and protocols for students living in campus residence halls and apartments. It is the responsibility of all community members to support these standards to maintain a healthy and safe living learning environment. Goals of health and safety inspections include:\n\nEncourage students to become engaged in maintaining the condition of their living environments\n\nAssist students in learning how to maintain a clean and safe environment in their residence\n\nPromote a better understanding of the expectations the university has for students living on campus\n\nAssist in the prevention of rodent and pest infestations, damage problems and other issues that impact health and safety\n\nIncrease safety within our residential buildings by timely identification and removal of prohibited items\n\nResidence Life performs health and safety inspections once per month over the academic year. During the inspections, the staff member will conduct a non-invasive inspection of the room/apartment/suite. They do not open drawers, refrigerators, or closets, but may move (or ask the resident to move) items blocking outlets. All inspections are advertised and announced in advance.\n\nThe inspections will include, but is not limited to, a visual examination of electrical cords, sprinkler heads, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and windows. In addition, each room will be examined for the presence of prohibited items (e.g., candles, non-surge protected extension cords, halogen lamps, cooking appliances in non-kitchen areas, etc.)\n\nStudents should do the following on a regular basis to keep their residence clean:\n\nRemove all trash and properly dispose of it in the trash room.\n\nVacuum or sweep and mop all floors in your room.\n\nCheck electrical outlets, cords, and connections to make sure they are not overloaded and that cords are not run under carpets or around bedding.\n\nCheck to ensure that beds, other furnishings, and other items are not blocking emergency exits and heating and ventilation units.\n\nNote any maintenance problems in your room and report them to your resident assistant.\n\nDo your laundry on a regular basis and properly store your clean clothes when finished.\n\nClean up any spills and dispose of leftover food in proper trash receptacles.\n\nIn the bathroom, clean the toilet, including in and around the bowl, clean the shower/tub, clean the floor, wipe down countertops and clean the sink, and put away and/or organize personal items.\n\nStudents are required to read and comply with our Residential Policies which include information on prohibited items.\n\nWe have security officers patrolling the campus 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Security officers are available to assist you with a wide range of needs. They will escort you from your car or classroom back to your residence hall or house, and make sure your safety needs are met.\n\nAll outside doors to our residence halls and sorority houses are locked 24 hours per day. You will be issued a front door key to your respective hall or house. If you find yourself locked out, you can call the RA on‐call to let you back into your room. For lock‐outs during business hours, please come to the Residence Life office in Owens for loaner keys.\n\nA word about keys: Each resident is issued a front door key to the hall in which they live. It is very important that the key is well guarded and kept secure. If a resident finds that they have lost their key, it is in everyone’s best interest that the Office of Residence Life is notified immediately. Loaning keys to visitors or friends is strictly prohibited. If you need a replacement key, you may fill out an order form.\n\nThe information you provided on your Housing Application form will be used to pair you with an appropriate roommate. We try hard to make positive matches, but there is no fail‐proof way to match roommates. Some of you will be fast friends, others will just be good roommates. You may not develop a life-long relationship with your roommate. The important thing is that you learn how to live with someone. You will gain skills in communication, cooperation, respect, flexibility, tolerance, and diversity to name a few.\n\nAnticipation of your new roommate can be one of the most unnerving times as you start college. In order to develop a healthy roommate relationship, it is vital that you begin communication right away. We recommend that you begin the process before you get to campus. Some good initial questions to ask each other are:\n\nWhere are you from? What was it like growing up there?\n\nDo you know what your major will be? What do you hope to do with that?\n\nWhat are some of your hobbies, interests and talents?\n\nWhat are you looking forward to at Brenau? Is there anything you are nervous about?\n\nWhat types of things are you hoping to get involved in on campus?\n\nHave you ever lived with someone before? What was it like?\n\nWhat do you think are the most important things for us to work on as roommates?\n\nWe want you to make your room your home away from home. Curtains, bedspreads, area rugs, lamps, plants and pictures are some of the items you may use to individualize your room. Room walls are painted on a rotating basis and may not be painted by the residents. Nails, putty or foam tape are not permitted on the room walls. Whatever you decide to bring with you to decorate, remember that your roommate will be bringing things as well. There can be nothing mounted to the walls.\n\nNot if you are a freshman. Living with another individual is a wonderful opportunity for you to grow and learn about who you are and how you interact with others. Brenau feels it is essential to your development that you have this opportunity. You will learn to communicate, interact, share and compromise with your roommate. All of these are important skills that enable you to develop personally and professionally, wherever your career path leads.\n\nOnce you are an upperclassman, you may have the opportunity to select a single room. If space is available, you may even choose to live in a double occupancy room and have it as a single. Both of these cost an additional fee per semester and are dependent on available space.\n\nTo graduate, you must have the right combination of courses and correct total number of hours. Each major requires a different number of hours to graduate. It is important to consult the catalog for your major when planning your courses. If you have general questions concerning the graduation process, please visit the graduation page. In addition to the requirements for each major, Brenau has overall graduation requirements such as residency, minimum grade point averages (overall and major), minimum number of hours, etc. For more details, refer to our catalog.\n\nConsult with your advisor if you have questions about your academic program. After you apply to graduate, the Registrar’s Office completes a graduation audit. Copies of the audit are sent to you and your advisor. If you have questions about the audit, contact your advisor.\n\nIf you need to take a course at another institution, you must contact your advisor to request transient status. Your adviser will complete a transient request form and forward the form to the Registrar’s Office for processing. If you are an undergraduate student and in the last 30 hours of your academic program, the form must be approved by your department and the Registrar’s Office. Brenau will not guarantee acceptance of coursework taken without a transient letter on file.\n\nPlease note:\n\nStudents must earn a grade of “C” or better for undergraduate courses.\n\nStudents must earn a grade of “B” or better for graduate courses.\n\nCourses with labs must have a “C” or better for both parts before\n\neither the lab or the lecture can be transferred.\n\nYour advisor and department chair must approve graduate transient letters. If the transient letter is approved, it will be forwarded to the transient school and copied to you and your advisor. If you’re receiving financial aid, contact the Financial Aid Office when you receive confirmation that your transient letter has been processed, if it is required for your financial aid for that semester. The Financial Aid Office can then confirm this acceptance and verify your aid for the affected semester. Brenau is not responsible for prerequisite courses required by the transient institution for the transient courses taken at that institution.\n\nGPA calculation is not as complicated as you think! Every grade received has a quality point value assigned to it.\n\nThose values are:\n\nA: 4 points\n\nB: 3 points\n\nC: 2 points\n\nD: 1 point\n\nF: 0 points (This includes WF and IF grades as well)\n\n”W”, “I” and “P” do not contain a point value, and the hours are not added to the total for determining your GPA.\n\nTo calculate GPA:\n\nMultiply the number of points by the number of hours for each course\n\nAdd all the points up\n\nAdd all the course hours up (don’t include the “W” “I” or “P” grades)\n\nDivide the number of course hours into the number of GPA quality points — now you have your GPA!\n\nClass schedule changes, in most cases, may be made up to one week after the first day of the semester (or session). Changes can be made via CampusWEB or the electronic Drop/Withdrawal Form. The academic calendar dates are printed in the catalog, and are included in detail on the Registrar’s Office web page.\n\nNote: You are unable to drop all classes in CampusWEB. The electronic Drop/Withdrawal Form must be submitted to cancel registration. You must drop classes even if payment has not been submitted and the student has decided not to attend. Failure to complete the form could result in a grade of F on your academic record.\n\nPlease refer to the Registrar’s Office website for the most up-to-date information concerning registration and drop/add.\n\nAll returning students have an assigned registration day on CampusWEB which is published on the Registrar’s Office schedule page. Students will receive an email two to three weeks before the registration date, which will contain a link to the online registration schedule and a reminder to make sure their student account is clear, all library books are returned, etc. Returning students will be billed a late registration fee if registering during the late registration period.\n\nAll dates for registration including initial registration, late registration, and drop/add periods are all on the academic calendar page on the Registrar’s Office’s web page. We recommend that you bookmark this site because the address does not change, and it’s updated every semester with new dates.\n\nDancers should arrive at LEAST twenty minutes prior to the audition to check in and prepare their bodies. The class/audition will be a ballet barre followed by ballet centre. If you are currently dancing en pointe, please bring your pointe shoes. It is okay if you are not en pointe. After the pointe, you will dance barefoot for a modern combination and then finish the dance portion with a jazz combination (jazz oxfords or dance sneakers are recommended).\n\nFollowing the dance section, you will have an interview with a faculty member.\n\nUPDATE LINKS\n\nStudents entering as dance majors will be considered for a talent-based scholarship when they attend a Dance Scholarship and Technique Placement Audition. Those being considered for scholarship will participate in a brief interview with faculty following the audition. Auditions are held three times a year. Please check the dance website by clicking here or email danceinfo@brenau.edu for dates. Students receiving dance scholarships will receive a contract of expectations including the expectation to register for technique and repertory classes every semester and participation in faculty and guest choreography and/or participation as a company member of the Gainesville Ballet Company. Dance scholarships are part of the total aid package offered by the university Office of Financial Aid.\n\nAll prospective dance majors must attend a Dance Scholarship and Technique Placement Audition before enrolling as a dance major. The audition will be used for faculty to place students in the appropriate technique class level, to advise students in their pursuit of a dance degree, and to assess students for the possibility of being awarded a talent-based scholarship. Those being considered for scholarship will participate in a brief interview with faculty following the audition.\n\nAt the time of the sophomore review, students will be encouraged to continue in the major or pursue other opportunities depending on the student’s progress at the time of the review.\n\nThe interior design undergraduate BFA coursework is offered in two locations/formats. The Women’s College, WC, classes are offered at our Gainesville Campus during the day in a traditional college setting. The University College, UC, classes are offered at our North Atlanta Campus in an evening and weekend setting. You select one of the two settings for your undergraduate work. However, the final year of study, in the MID program, combines these two programs into the evening and weekend college format. Online coursework may also be required in both the undergraduate and graduate coursework.\n\nThe MFA is offered in an online format.\n\nOur program combines an extensive professional interior design curriculum along with comprehensive liberal education coursework. Additionally, because the undergraduate portion ends in a BFA, classes are required in foundation studio arts and art history. We had previously completed all these requirements in the bachelor only format; however, with almost 130 semester credits, no elective credits, and more hours needed to meet updated CIDA requirements, we acknowledged that the content of the program warranted a Masters level degree. We believe, you should receive the degree earned for the quantity and quality of coursework you complete.\n\nThe final year is completed at our Atlanta Campus location in the Evening and Weekend College format. This allows you to work part-time during the day in the final year of your program and take courses at night and on the weekends. We encourage you to complete your internship during this time. In order to earn the BFA you must complete the MID. The degrees can only be received when they are combined and it is only this combination that is accredited by CIDA.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nStudents who are active duty service members, and spouses using My Career Advancement Account (MyCAA) should first receive approval from the student’s Education Services Officer (ESO), military counselor or service prior to enrollment.\n\nOnce written approval is received from your ESO or service, contact Whitney McDowell-Robinson at wmcdowell-robinson@brenau.edu to be included in the military student information network.\n\nSubmit your approval documentation to Portia Clark at pclark2@brenau.edu, then follow your branch specific instructions..\n\nBrenau University has a rolling admissions policy — there are no annual deadlines or specific priority dates for most programs. We recommended that financial aid requests be submitted two months prior to your anticipated start date. Visit our Financial Aid page for more information about how to get started.\n\nNew FAFSA forms are available on Oct. 1 of each calendar year for the academic year that begins the following August. For example, on Oct. 1, 2022, the 2023-24 FAFSA is available to file."
