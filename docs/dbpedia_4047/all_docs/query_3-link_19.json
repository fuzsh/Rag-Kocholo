        "text": "Lake State was the first in the country to offer an accredited four-year Fire Science program and is one of three such programs in the nation.\n\nStudents working at our aquatic research laboratory maintain one of the few fisheries in North America.\n\nLife outside the classroom is wide and varied. Not only do we have one of the world’s largest backyards to hunt, fish, bike, ski, snowshoe and just relax, there are more than 60 campus clubs and organizations to get involved with.\n\nOur Student Activity Center is perfect for pickup games, intramurals and getting a great work out. The “SAC” has a six-lane track, four multi-purpose courts for basketball, volleyball, and tennis plus their state-of-the-art aerobic workout stations.\n\nLeadership in training. Students at LSSU have more opportunities than students at bigger campuses for making a difference. Lake State offers the opportunity to really work closely with senior administration and staff in extracurricular activities. One person can make a difference at Lake Superior State University."
