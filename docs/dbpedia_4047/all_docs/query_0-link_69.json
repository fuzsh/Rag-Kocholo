        "text": "Corn Huskin\n\nBeginning in 1945, this competition between even and odds classes includes literally husking corn, bobbing for apples, skits, singing, comedy performances, and a lot of things you just have to experience. It is a time where students and faculty get to relax, enjoy each other, and just act \"corny\"!\n\nEvens and Odds\n\nThe big sister class is paired up with a graduating class two years after their own, the little sister class, for example, 2013 is paired with 2015 who is paired with 2017. The even graduating classes compete against the odd graduating classes while the little sis classes support the big sis classes.\n\nCrook Hunt\n\nThe first crook was hidden by the senior class of 1906 for the Junior class to find. This started a tradition that had to be suspended from 1913 to 1929 because the students were hiding it in increasingly dangerous places. It is decorated in the class colors if the Juniors can't find it before graduation day, but if it is found, it is decorated in black and must be brought to graduation events.\n\nThe Onyx\n\nIn 1954 The onyx ring was first introduced, and every Meredith College graduate wears the same ring to this day. The Meredith crest \"Lux\" points towards you when you are in school to symbolize that Meredith is becoming a part of you, and it faces away from you after graduation to symbolize that you are representing Meredith to the world."
