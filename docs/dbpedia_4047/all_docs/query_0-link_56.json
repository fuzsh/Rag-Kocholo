The Golden Suns currently have a 1-1 overall record so far this season.\n\nArkansas Tech and Lane College have faced each other seven total times between the history of the two programs. In terms of wins against Lane, the Golden Suns have won all seven matchups against the Dragons with the last one being a 61-48 victory for Tech on the road in Jackson, Tenn. back on November 27, 2019.\n\nThe home game against the Dragons is set for a 1 p.m. tip-off tomorrow afternoon in Tucker Coliseum. Tech Tidbits\n\nThe Golden Suns began their season on a high note with a 94-45 blowout of Champion Christian in front of the home crowd in Tucker Coliseum. Jalei Oglesby and Kaley Shipman led the team in scoring against the Tigers each putting up 16 and 15 points, respectively. Both also shot over 50.0% from the floor, while Shipman went 3-for-6 from beyond-the-arc.\n\nTheir most recent outing against Maryville was a tough 59-62 loss on the road in the final minutes of play. The Golden Suns held a lead over Maryville from 5:02 left in the first quarter, until the last few remaining minutes at the 3:04 mark in the fourth quarter. Oglesby led the way once more for Arkansas Tech against the Saints with a double-double consisting of 16 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBetween both games played, the Golden Suns are averaging 76.5 points per game on offense. They are also doing well on the defensive end of the court holding their opponents to just 53.5 points per game. On field goal percentage, the Golden Suns are getting 43.3% (65-of-150) of their shots to go down, while their opponents are hitting just 24.1% (32-of-133) of their shots from the floor.\n\nFrom behind three-point territory, the Golden Suns are making 29.4% (10-of-34) of their attempts from long range, while opposing teams are making just 22.2% (12-of-54) of their triples. At the charity stripe, the Golden Suns are knocking down 52.0% (13-of-25) of their freebies, while opponents are hitting at a clip of 75.6% (31-of-41) from the line.\n\nIn terms of individual play, the Golden Suns currently boast three players that average double figures in scoring. Oglesby leads the squad on a 16.0 points per game average, while Shipman follows with an average of 12.5 points per game. Marta Duda has offered high powered offense off the bench for the Golden Suns averaging 10.5 points per game. All double figure scorers for Tech are shooting exceptionally well so far early in the season with Duda leading the trio averaging a stellar 55.6% (10-of-18) on her shots from the floor, while Oglesby is averaging a fantastic 53.3% (16-of-30) from field goal range. Shipman has been hot with the three ball knocking down 50.0% (3-of-6) from beyond-the-arc in the first two games of the season.\n\nOglesby leads the team on the rebounding battle with 8.5 per game. Dana Thompson follows Oglesby with 7.5 boards per game, while Duda hauls in an average of 7.0 rebounds. In terms of assists, Shipman leads the team with a 3.0 assist per game average.

While at Tech, Wilbers has kept the Golden Suns as perennial contenders in the GAC, the region and the nation, winning 20 or more games nine times, capturing seven conference regular championships, five conference tournament championships and advancing to nine NCAA Regional Tournaments. Wilbers surpassed the 300-win milestone as a head coach in the 2020-21 season in a 63-60 win against Arkansas-Monticello. Wilbers was also named the GAC Coach of the Year during that same season.\n\nIn his time as head coach of the Golden Suns, in which he is now in his 16th season, Wilbers has amassed an impressive 329-109 career record.\n\nScouting The Dragons\n\nLane College is off to a 1-0 start to their season as they defeated Fisk University 75-64 on the road. Last season, the Dragons went 16-10 overall with an 11-6 record in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Lane would go on to make the SIAC Tournament where they were put out in the opening round by Albany State 68-57.\n\nWith only one game to their record this season, the Dragons do not have much in the way of statistical averages.\n\nIn their season opener win against Fisk, Lane College put up 75 total points and were led by Kayla Simmons who scored 19 points. She shot 66.7% (8-of-12) from field goal range and went 3-of-4 from the free throw line for the Dragons in their opener.\n\nAs a team, the Dragons shot 42.2% from the field (27-of-64), while hitting 33.3% of their attempts from three-point range (5-of-15) and knocked down 57.1% (16-of-28) of their shots from the charity stripe.\n\nDefensively, Lane College allowed 64 points to Fisk University. Statically, the Bulldogs shot 35.1% (20-of-57) overall, 21.1% (4-of-19) from three-point range and 83.3% from the free throw line (20-of-24).\n\nThe Dragons are coached by Surina Dixon, who is in her first season of her second stint as the head coach at Lane. Her first stint as the head women's basketball coach at Lane was from 2005-2007. Dixon's first stop as a head coach at the collegiate level was at the University of Maryland Eastern Shores from 2000-2004. Her most recent stop as a head coach, prior to returning to Lane College for her second stint, was at Jackson State University. Dixon has posted a career record of 124-207.\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
