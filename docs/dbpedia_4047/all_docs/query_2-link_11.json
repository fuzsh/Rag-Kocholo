        "text": "What are the minimum acceptance requirements?\n\nSoutheastern considers many aspects of a student’s academic and personal background when deciding admission status.\n\nWe require a GPA of at least 2.0, but students who have a lower GPA can submit a special appeal to be considered for admission.\n\nThe average incoming GPA of a Southeastern student is above a 3.0.\n\nAcademic scholarships are awarded based on incoming GPA, with higher GPAs qualifying for higher scholarship amounts.\n\nSAT and ACT scores are optional, however we encourage all high school students to submit their scores to potentially earn a higher academic scholarship or to be considered for additional opportunities, such as our School of Honors.\n\nIn addition to academics, we evaluate your character, mission fit, and desire to learn and grow, through a Christian character reference form and a short essay.\n\nNo applicant will be denied admission to Southeastern University on the basis of race, color, sex, nationality, or ethnic origin. Southeastern does not discriminate against individuals with physical or mental disabilities who are otherwise eligible for admission to the university.\n\nWhen is the deadline to apply?\n\nAt Southeastern University, students can apply at any time prior to the Fall or Spring semester for which they are hoping to enroll. We do offer priority deadlines, which allow for certain benefits, such as earlier acceptance decisions, more opportunities for financial aid, early registration options, and a higher likelihood to receive preferred housing and roommate selections.\n\nSEU has the following priority deadlines for students entering in the fall semester:\n\nDecember 1—Priority Application Deadline\n\nJanuary 15—Priority Acceptance Deadline\n\nFebruary 15—Institutional Scholarship Deadline\n\nMay 1—Priority Deposit Deadline\n\nWhat is the enrollment confirmation fee?\n\nThis $200 deposit is required of all accepted students who plan to attend Southeastern University. It saves your spot at SEU, guarantees that your class schedule will be completed, and that your on-campus housing will be reserved. The priority deadline for the enrollment confirmation fee is May 1 for the fall semester and November 1 for the spring semester. The deposit will be reflected as a credit on your student account.\n\nOnce I’ve completed my application, how long until I know whether I’m accepted?\n\nWe typically will have a decision on your application within two weeks of when all of your materials have been submitted. During certain seasons, the volume of applications will mean it could take longer, while other times decisions will happen quickly. If you have any questions or need updates during the process, feel free to contact your enrollment counselor. (Find your enrollment counselor here.)\n\nHow can I send in my application pieces/paperwork?\n\nWe prefer to receive most application materials through your personal application status link, which will be emailed to you upon completion of your application.\n\nOfficial transcripts can be sent electronically or mailed to:\n\nSoutheastern University\n\nAttn: Office of Admission\n\n1000 Longfellow Blvd.\n\nLakeland, FL 33801\n\nWhat are the steps I need to take to enroll at SEU?\n\nThe first step in the admission process is to complete your application using our convenient online application. Once you have completed the application, you will be provided with your next steps needed for acceptance, which include submitting a Christian character reference, a biographical essay, and transcripts. Your enrollment counselor can answer specific questions regarding your admission status and any incomplete steps. You can also view a step-by-step guide here.\n\nHow do I audition for admission to a music program or for music scholarships?\n\nVisit this page for details.\n\nWhere can I view SEU’s admission policies?\n\nYou can read Southeastern’s Admission Policy Manual by visiting the current Traditional Undergraduate section of the university catalog and choosing “Admission Policy Manual.”\n\nWhat financial aid options are available to students?\n\nSoutheastern University offers numerous scholarships and grants to incoming students, in addition to grants and loans available from state and federal governments. Scholarships include those based on academic merit as well as on performance ability in areas such as the fine arts and athletics. We also have special programs available for ministry leaders and their families, both within the Assemblies of God and other denominations. To see a complete list of the scholarship, grant and loan programs available at SEU, click here.\n\nWhat is Southeastern University’s FAFSA school code?\n\nOur code for FAFSA purposes is 001521.\n\nHow do I access Net Partner, SEU’s student financial aid online portal?\n\nStudents must log in to the SEU Financial Aid Portal to check their status and complete their financial aid award process. If it’s your first time logging in, you’ll need to choose “First Time User” and use your student ID to set up your PIN. Otherwise, use your PIN to sign in and explore your financial aid information.\n\nDoes SEU offer payment plans?\n\nYes. Southeastern offers affordable payment plans for all students regardless of need or financial standing. Visit this page for more details.\n\nHow many credit hours must I take in order to be eligible for financial aid?\n\nYou must be enrolled for at least six credit hours for federal loans and at least 12 credit hours for state and institutional financial aid.\n\nHow do I take out student loans?\n\nTo take out student loans, sign in at studentloans.gov with your student FSA ID. Complete the student entrance counseling section, and then sign the master promissory note.\n\nTo take out parent loans, sign in at studentloans.gov with your parent FSA ID, and complete the PLUS request process. Once your credit is approved, endorse the PLUS loan in order to take out the parent loan.\n\nLearn more about loans here.\n\nWhat is a subsidized student loan?\n\nA subsidized student loan offered by the government does not earn interest until after you leave or graduate from college. Neither the loan nor the interest is due until six months after you leave or graduate from college, and then the balance is divided into monthly payments over several years.\n\nWhat is an unsubsidized student loan?\n\nAn unsubsidized student loan offered by the government earns interest as soon as the funds are applied to your account. Neither the loan nor the interest is due until six months after you leave or graduate from college, and then the balance is divided into monthly payments over several years.\n\nWhat is the parent PLUS loan?\n\nParents may be eligible (based on credit) to take out a loan to help cover the cost of their students’ education.\n\nWhat is the interest rate on government loans?\n\nThe interest rate depends on many factors, including the type of loan. Federal interest rate information can be found here.\n\nHow long does it take to repay loans?\n\nThis depends on the amount of your loan, its interest rate and the length of time preferred. Click here for a helpful tool in determining how long it will take you to pay back your loans.\n\nWhat is student entrance counseling?\n\nThis is information provided to you by the federal government to help you understand the process of taking out a loan and how loans work.\n\nI’m a VA student and would like to use my benefits. How do I start the process?\n\nSubmit a copy of your Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to one of our VA certifying officials at SEU. Once your COE has been received, you will be sent a VA Request Form to request which semesters you would like your enrollment certified to the VA. After the drop/add period, your enrollment will be submitted to the VA but can take up to 14 days to process.\n\nI do not have a Certificate of Eligibility (COE). How do I get one?\n\nVisit va.gov to register for an account, select “Apply for Education Benefits,” and complete the electronic application. The VA will take up to 30 days to process your application and will send you the Certificate of Eligibility upon completion.\n\nI am using Chapter 31-Veteran Readiness Employment benefits. What do I need to provide to SEU for them to cover my tuition?\n\nChapter 31 benefits will not provide you with a certificate of eligibility. Work with your vocational rehabilitation counselor (VRC) through Veteran Affairs to determine which educational expenses are covered under your benefits. To apply for Chapter 31, click here.\n\nYou will need to complete a new VA Request Form each year with SEU, and work with your vocational rehabilitation counselor (VRC) through Veteran Affairs to submit a purchase order for billing.\n\nI have not received my first payment. What should I do?\n\nThe VA does not send monthly payments until after the first month of classes has concluded. Check with the SEU certifying official to make sure you completed the VA Request Form for the appropriate semester. If you still believe there may be an unresolved issue, please reach out to the VA Education hotline at 888.442.4551.\n\nDoes SEU accept tuition assistance?\n\nYes. Southeastern does accept tuition assistance but students are responsible for paying their remaining balance while awaiting payment from tuition assistance. Tuition Assistance (TA) is the term used for financial aid given by military branches to active duty and reserve service members for college courses. Service members should speak with their Educational Services Officer (ESO) or counselor within their military service prior to enrolling at the college.\n\nI am using tuition assistance to help cover my tuition balance. Is there anything I need to know?\n\nTuition assistance must be submitted in the proper portals according to your military unit and is approved by SEU after the drop/add period. Tuition Assistance is often sent late in the semester and only coves a portion of charges. It is not intended to be used toward securing financial clearance. Please reach out to Student Financial Services if you have specific questions.\n\nI received a notification that I will be dropped from my courses, but I will be covered by my VA benefits. Should I be worried?\n\nIf you are eligible for Chapter 33 Post 9/11 benefits at 100% tuition coverage, or you are a Chapter 31 Vocational Rehab student, you will not be dropped from your classes as long as you have provided the COE and completed the VA Request Form. All other chapters of VA benefits will be required to have a plan of payment in place to be financially cleared.\n\nWhy is my monthly stipend smaller than I expected?\n\nMonthly housing allowance or stipends are based on your benefit-type eligibility, delivery of education, rate of pursuit, and dates of enrollment. Dates of enrollment include semester (16 week) and session-based (8 week) classes. If you have questions on how your payments have been calculated, please reach out to the VA Education hotline 888.442.4551.\n\nHow do I verify my enrollment to continue receiving housing allowance payments (For Chapter 33, Chapter 30 or 1606)?\n\nIf you are a student using Chapter 33 Post 9/11 benefits, you must complete a monthly enrollment verification to keep receiving housing payments from VA. Two missed certifications will cause a delay in housing payments.\n\nTo set this up, call the Education Call Center (ECC) at 1.888.GIBILL.1 (1.888.442.4551) or watch this video for instructions. They can also help you opt in to text verification to make future verifications easier. If you are using Chapter 30 benefits, you must verify your enrollment through WAVE.\n\nWhat happens to my monthly housing allowance if I drop or withdraw from a class after my VA enrollment has been invoiced?\n\nIf you withdraw from one or more classes after the drop/add period, SEU is required to report your change to the VA and your monthly housing allowance will be affected. In rare cases, you may be required to pay back a housing payment. Please check with the certifying official at SEU if you have specific questions.\n\nMilitary Leave of Absence Policy\n\nMilitary Leave of Absence Checklist\n\nVisit SEU.edu/veterans for additional information. Please contact nlwolfe@seu.edu with any questions.\n\nWhat is Southeastern’s housing policy?\n\nSoutheastern’s housing policy states that single students who are 22 years of age and younger must live on campus unless they are living with immediate family members or close relatives who are 22 years of age or older. It is the policy of the university to provide on-campus housing for undergraduate students under the age of 24. The university is unable to provide housing for students who are age 24 or older, married, or have children; however, exceptions for age are considered through an appeal process.\n\nWhat does it cost to live on campus?\n\nFind the latest tuition & fees here.\n\nHow many academic credit hours do I need to live on campus?\n\nStudents need at least 10 credit hours to live on campus. If you have any questions, reach out to our Housing Office at studenthousing@seu.edu.\n\n(Note: Students taking less than 10 credit hours who would like to live on campus may make a request in writing; situations are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.)\n\nWhat is SEU’s curfew?\n\nAll residents 19 years of age and under are subject to a 1:00 a.m. curfew at all times, meaning they must be on campus no later than 1:00 a.m. each night. There is no curfew for residents 20 years of age and older. However, all students on campus after 1:00 a.m. are required to be in their room, in a designated 24-hour space, or traveling to or from their room or a designated 24-hour space. There is to be no loitering outside of a student’s assigned room or outside of a designated 24-hour space for any reason after 1:00 a.m. Any student who lives off-campus is required to leave the campus by 1:00 a.m.\n\nDo you have 24-hour spaces?\n\nYes! Our 24-hour spaces include Mi Casa, Portico, and Buena Vida West Mezzanine.\n\nWhat is Open Dorm?\n\nOpen Dorms are our opposite-gender visitation times throughout the week. Each hall has different scheduled days and times for visitation hours. Ask your Resident Assistant about your hall’s specific schedule.\n\nWhat is FERPA? As an institution receiving federal funds, SEU complies with the obligations under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) to maintain the privacy of a student’s education record and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure thereof. (20 U.S.C. §1232g; 34 CFR 99.)\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nFERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children’s education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are referred to below as “eligible students.”\n\nEligible students have the right to inspect and review their education records maintained by Southeastern University. SEU is not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records.\n\nEligible students have the right to request that SEU correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading.\n\nGenerally, SEU must have written permission from the student in order to release any information from a student’s education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31):\n\nSchool officials with legitimate educational interest;\n\nOther schools to which a student is transferring;\n\nSpecified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;\n\nAppropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;\n\nOrganizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;\n\nAccrediting organizations;\n\nTo comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena;\n\nAppropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and\n\nState and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.\n\nSchools may disclose, without consent, “directory” information such as a student’s name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. SEU notifies students annually of their rights under FERPA.\n\nCan we choose which dorm we live in and our roommate(s)?\n\nAll students may request to live in any residence hall and with any specific student. If a vacancy is not available in the requested residence hall at the time of assignment, the housing office will work to accommodate the alternate preferences as space is available. The campus housing application on the enrollment confirmation form has a location to request a specific roommate. His or her full name must be included. If the person you request to room with is also a new student, he or she must include your name on his or her form in order for your request to be processed. Enrollment confirmation forms for all requested roommates must be received by the advertised deadline each year for consideration.\n\nWhat do I do for Move In Day?\n\nMake sure you’re Fire Ready! Sign up for a check-in appointment and arrive at your designated Residence Hall at your scheduled time. Complete a room inspection with your Resident Assistant and then move in. For more information, check out our Welcome Week/Orientation page!\n\nHow do I relocate?\n\nAfter the resident checks into their residence hall assignment, he/she may wish to relocate into another residence hall location. Relocation requests can be made during certain designated relocation request periods. The first of these is after add/drop at the beginning of the fall semester, and the second is before Thanksgiving to request a relocation between fall and spring semesters. Residents can reach out to their Resident Director or the Student Housing Office for more information as to how to make these requests. Approved relocations must take place on the designated days as communicated by the Resident Director.\n\nAside from approved relocations occurring during designated relocation request periods, relocations are only permitted in cases of extenuating circumstances in consultation with the student’s Resident Director.\n\nWhat are room inspections? The Student Housing office conducts cleanliness inspections to ensure a healthy and safe living environment that is conducive to living and learning. It is the responsibility of the resident to be considerate of roommates and suitemates and keep their rooms neat and clean at all times. The Student Housing office reviews all aspects of a room in light of health issues, trash, safety, and the ability for Housekeeping to complete their assigned work.\n\nRooms are graded on an Excellent, Pass, or Failure system. If a room receives an Excellent rating, the names of all roommates are placed in monthly drawings for prizes including reserved parking and gift cards. If a room fails the room inspection, the first failure of the semester results in a written warning. Each failed room inspection after the written warning will result in a monetary sanction placed on the student account. Only one grade is given per room because roommates are jointly responsible for the condition of the room.\n\nIf students would like to complete a Roommate Agreement regarding the cleanliness of their room they can see their Resident Director. Roommate Agreements are recommended for all students living with a new roommate for the first time.\n\nWhat do I do if damage occurs in my room/suite?\n\nWe understand that accidents happen, whether it be spilling a drink or something breaking. The first thing to do is place a work order right away. Many spills can be cleaned by Housekeeping if addressed immediately rather than waiting until the end of the semester/year where it becomes harder to clean, resulting in permanent stains. The second thing is to own up to the accident. If you caused the damage, email studenthousing@seu.edu to take responsibility for the charges. If a resident doesn’t take responsibility for the damage, the Housing office has no alternative but to split the charges among all the residents in the room/suite.\n\nHow can I put in a work order?\n\nTo submit a work order, log in to MySEU. On the top of the page select “Campus.” In the drop down menu select “Facilities Management.” On the landing page click “work request form.” After being redirected to the SchoolDude site, follow the prompts on the page.\n\nWhat are hall meetings?\n\nHall meetings are held at the beginning and end of each semester. These meetings cover everything students need to know about living on campus including our residential policies and processes. Every student must attend their designated meeting.\n\nWhat are your community standards?\n\nFor detailed information on our community standards, please refer to the Student Handbook (located within the MySEU student intranet).\n\nIs SEU accredited?\n\nSoutheastern University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees.\n\nThis is the Commission that accredits SEU and authorizes the university to offer degree programs and financial aid. This is the same Commission that accredits many other institutions like University of Florida, Auburn University and Georgia Tech. You may contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call 404-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Southeastern University.\n\nWhat degree programs are available?\n\nThe degree programs offered at our site are listed in the “Degree Program” section of your site’s partner webpage. Click here to select your site. Each SEU partner site offers ministry-related programs, and many sites supplement these offerings with non-ministry program options that may include majors like business administration, leadership, psychology, communications, and human services. If you have questions about the specific degree programs offered at our partner site, please contact the Site Director for more information.\n\nIs student housing offered?\n\nSEU does not provide housing for students at partner sites. However, some church partners offer housing services as an optional benefit for participants in church-affiliated ministries. Often these options involve host homes with church families or preferred pricing with local apartment communities. Please contact the Site Director to inquire about the availability of such options with the local church partner.\n\nAre extension site students eligible for the academic scholarships listed on the SEU website?\n\nNo, because extension site students receive highly discounted tuition rates, you are not eligible for institutional scholarships. These scholarships are for main campus students. Extension site students are eligible for federal aid by submitting the FAFSA.\n\nAre extension site students eligible for the academic scholarships listed on the SEU website?\n\nNo, because extension site students receive highly discounted tuition rates, you are not eligible for institutional scholarships. These scholarships are for main campus students. Extension site students are eligible for federal aid by submitting the FAFSA.\n\nWhat financial aid options are available to partner site students?\n\nStudents at SEU extension sites and regional campuses may be eligible for federal financial aid, including grants and loans. You must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to see what you may qualify for. SEU’s academic scholarships are not available to extension site & regional campus students. Students may also apply for third-party scholarships.\n\nWhat expenses can my financial aid cover?\n\nFinancial aid is provided primarily to cover tuition and fee costs charged by Southeastern University. However, it may also be used to cover additional program expenses included in your Cost of Attendance (COA) such as books, supplies, transportation, and living expenses.\n\nWhen are funds disbursed?\n\nIn order for loan funds to disburse, Student Financial Services must first confirm all documents have been completed and half-time enrollment has been confirmed by faculty through the Office of the Registrar for each semester. Depending on your schedule, this may cause disbursement times to vary by student.\n\nAs an example, a student who is enrolled in 3 credit hours in Term A and 3 credit hours in Term B (with half-time enrollment being defined as 6 credit hours) would not have their loan funds disbursed until after enrollment for the Term B course has been confirmed. However, a student who is in 6 credits all in Term A would be eligible for loan funds to disburse after enrollment has been confirmed in Term A.\n\nShould I bring my car to campus, or is there public transportation I can use?\n\nYou are welcome to bring a car to SEU, even as a freshman, but if you choose not to, you can use Lakeland’s public bus system for free. We have a bus stop right in front of campus, and students can ride around Lakeland by simply showing their school ID card.\n\nDo I have to be a Christian to attend SEU?\n\nYes, one of the requirements for admission to Southeastern as an undergraduate student is that you claim Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. We understand that all Christians are at different points in their walk with Christ, but all our students should have made a commitment to follow Christ before attending SEU.\n\nIs Southeastern University accredited?\n\nSoutheastern University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097 or call 404-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Southeastern University. Click here to learn more.\n\nAre students required to attend chapel?\n\nYes, we do require students to attend a certain number of chapel services each semester. However, there are multiple chapel services each week, in addition to Discipleship group meetings which also count toward your chapel requirement. Learn more about Chapel at SEU.\n\nIs SEU affiliated with a particular denomination?\n\nYes, Southeastern has been affiliated with the Assemblies of God since our founding. However, we welcome students from many different denominational backgrounds, including Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholic, non-denominational and many others. In fact, the majority of our students are from backgrounds other than the Assemblies of God. The community at SEU shares a strong commitment to Christ and making Him known, and we celebrate our theological similarities while also appreciating our differences and learning from each other.\n\nAre there good options for local churches in Lakeland?\n\nLakeland has plenty of great churches for students from any Christian background. There are large churches, multisite churches and also lots of small community churches where students can get plugged in and serve. We encourage students to attend a local church.\n\nWhat kind of activities are available in and around Lakeland?\n\nWe love this question because there are so many great answers. Lakeland has lots to offer from parks and recreation to shopping to community events and more. We’re also within 45 minutes of theme parks such as Disney, Busch Gardens, SeaWorld, Legoland, etc., as well as beaches in the Tampa Bay area. Our students love the small-town feel of Lakeland, while still being so close to the great entertainment activities that central Florida has to offer in Tampa and Orlando. Click here to learn more."
