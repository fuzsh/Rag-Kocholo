        "text": "On this page:\n\nSummer Semester Housing\n\nSummer housing is available in Forest Lane, College Park and University Park. Summer spaces may be available in The Village but require a 4-semester housing agreement. This agreement includes the current summer semester, fall semester, spring semester, and the following summer semester.\n\nResidents currently living in residence halls who wish to transfer into an apartment may stay in their current space until their summer apartment is available. If you choose, you may request to retain your apartment for the following academic year. Requests are granted as space is available.\n\nIf you currently reside in an apartment, you will retain your current apartment for your summer assignment. There are no additional fees for the break between the spring and summer semesters.\n\nAll summer semester residents with a fall housing assignment will not be billed any additional fees for the break between the summer and fall semesters; nor do residents have to move out and move back in.\n\nSummer housing assignments are sent during the third week of April and housing bills are due on May 15. Payment plans are available. Please contact Enrollment Services for additional information.\n\nRates\n\nResidence Hall/\n\nApartment Room Type Room Rate\n\nCollege Park\n\nStandard quad $1,650 College Park Renovated quad $2,190 Forest Lane Studio, small two bedroom, or large two bedroom $1,650\n\nUniversity Park\n\nStandard quad $1,650 University Park * Six-person, double-occupancy quad $1,320 single room | $990 double room The Village Efficiency $2,808 The Village Deluxe efficiency $3,207 The Village One bedroom $3,642 The Village Two bedroom $4,143 The Village Two-bedroom split $2,161\n\nThere is an additional $200 communications fee and $60 activity fee billed to all students who stay on campus during the summer.\n\n* In Six-person, double-occupancy quads, apartments with only four residents will be charged the standard rate of $1650. Once the fifth resident completes an agreement to share a double room, the rate will be adjusted.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nTo submit your housing application/contract, follow these steps:\n\nLog in to WINGS Express with your Campus Username (w000abc) and Password.\n\nSelect Student and Financial Aid.\n\nSelect Housing Services.\n\nSelect Continue to Dayton Housing Account.\n\nSelect Summer Housing.\n\nIf you need assistance logging in, contact the Help Desk at 937-775-4827.\n\nRoommate Requests\n\nIf you have roommate request(s), you will need to have their name and UID (University ID) to enter on the application preferences.\n\nAll roommates must request the same preferred floor plan to be considered for a housing assignment together.\n\nWinter Break Housing\n\nOur residence hall communities including Hamilton Hall, Honors Community, and The Woods close for winter break. Rooms and any personal belongings left behind are not accessible during this closure.\n\nStudents who prefer to reside in their residence hall during the break between the fall and spring semesters may register for winter break housing. Those who register will be billed $225 and will have continued access to their room and community amenities during the break.\n\nTo be eligible for winter break housing, students must be registered for spring classes and must not have a past due housing balance. Keys for winter break housing in The Woods and Honors Community can be picked up beginning mid-November. Students must pick up a break key to access their respective buildings over winter break. Hamilton Hall residents do not need a break key.\n\nNote: Apartments will remain open during winter break for continuing residents only (no additional charge for winter break housing in our apartments). Residents returning for spring may leave personal belongings in the apartment during the break.\n\nPlease keep in mind that all campus policies are still in effect and enforced during winter break."
