It has grown from 1 campus into a regional educational and economic force.\n\nFounded in 1968 as a part of the Virginia Community College System, Tidewater Community College (TCC) serves South Hampton Roads with 4 campuses in Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach, and 6 regional centers. TCC is the second largest of the 23 Virginia community colleges, enrolling nearly 25,000 students in 2020-21.\n\nThe college had 2,963 graduates in 2020-2021, 48 percent of whom pursued degrees that would let them transfer to 4-year institutions. Of South Hampton Roads residents enrolled in higher education, 33% enrolled at TCC. TCC’s regional accreditation is affirmed through 2027 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. The college has 13 nationally accredited academic programs."
