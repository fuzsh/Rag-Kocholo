        "text": "Tuition and Fees\n\nIt is important that students carefully consider the total cost of financing their education, from the entering term to the completion of their degree. If financial help will be needed beyond those funds which the student or the family is able to provide, the student should make the necessary applications for financial assistance well in advance of enrollment. Students should pay particular attention to early deadlines for application for grants, scholarships, and work-study positions. While the needs and resources of each student differ, the University can provide a general list of fees and expenses normally encountered.\n\nStudents are given information at the time they complete their enrollment on the procedures and deadlines for payment of tuition and fees. (See \"Financial Obligation\" in the “Bursar” section of this Catalog.)\n\nThe required tuition and mandatory fees for resident and nonresident students at Oklahoma State University are listed below. Resident and nonresident tuition rates are based on the course level and program delivery. All course offerings are listed by four-digit numbers with the first digit indicating the course level. Undergraduate courses are all courses with a first digit of 0 through 4. Graduate-division and professional courses are all courses with the first digit of 5 or above.\n\nNew freshmen who are Oklahoma residents are given the opportunity at the time of enrollment to select a guaranteed tuition rate that is locked in for four years. To maintain this rate, students must remain continuously enrolled as full-time students. The lock tuition rate is included in the undergraduate tuition and mandatory fees grid and detailed information is provided on the Office of the Bursar website at bursar.okstate.edu/lock-tuition-program.\n\nFor the most recent student costs refer to the Office of the Bursar website at http://bursar.okstate.edu/tuition-and-fees. Included in this section is information regarding fee definitions, refund policies, and residential life rates.\n\nTuition and fees are subject to change without notice, as provided by the University Board of Regents and OSRHE policies.\n\nStarting fall 2014, OSU implemented a new block rate that includes tuition and University-wide fees for undergraduate students taking 12 to 18 credit hours. The “block” rate is one of OSU’s strategies to help students stay on target to finish college in 4 years. University-wide fees (also called mandatory fees) include: student activity fees, student facility fees, library automation and technology fee, health services fee, student development fee, Daily O’Collegian fee, academic records and maintenance fee, academic excellence fee, transit/parking services fee, advising/assessment fee, university technology infrastructure maintenance fee, academic facilities, life safety and security fee and student union renovation fee. Academic Service Fees such as specific course fees and/or college based fees are not included in the block rate and continue to be charged on a per-credit-hour basis. Additional block rate information is available at: blockrate.okstate.edu.\n\nEstimated Total Expenses for Students\n\nAn estimated one-semester budget (based on 2024-2025 figures) for an undergraduate student living on campus at OSU is as follows.

This fee also supports the commitment to academic advising within each college to create a collaborative decision-making framework which students can identify and realize their educational goals. The goal is to preserve personalized advising services, reduce the advisor/student ratio in high demand areas and to develop advising technology such as degree audit systems to support an increased graduation rate.

To be eligible under this fee policy, an employee must submit a completed Request for Faculty-Staff Fee Waiver form to the Office of the Registrar prior to the beginning of classes. If the form is not on file prior to the beginning of classes, the student will not be granted the waiver in fees.

If enrollment does not exceed one course, only the department head's approval is needed to receive a fee waiver. If the staff member is enrolled in more than one course, his or her dean and vice president must also give approval for a fee waiver.\n\nFor eligible full time 100% faculty or staff enrolled in University courses, the following fees will be waived:\n\nStudent activity fees\n\nStudent activity fee - Athletic fee\n\nHealth Services fee\n\nTransit/Parking Services fee\n\nStudent Development fee\n\nDaily O'Collegian fee\n\nFaculty and staff must pay 50% of the general tuition, 100% of any additional fees not listed above, as well as 100% of any special course charges.

If the institution is required to return Title IV funds, the student will be required to pay for the institutional charges originally paid by the aid returned. Please visit the Return to Title IV policy.\n\nRepayment Policy\n\nFinancial aid is considered to be used first for direct educational costs (tuition and fees) and, if the student is in University housing, for room and board. If a student financial aid recipient withdraws and is eligible for a refund of tuition and fees and/or room and board, all or part of this refund will be used to reimburse Title IV federal financial aid program(s); state programs which apply to tuition (i.e. OKPromise); or institutional tuition and fee waiver programs.\n\nIf a student receives Title IV federal aid in excess of institutional charges and subsequently withdraws, he/she may be required to return a portion of the aid. The student is ineligible for further aid until the required repayment has been made. The aid is returned on the student’s behalf and a charge is placed on the student Bursar account for the repayment. For additional information, please visit the Return to Title IV policy.\n\nRefund Policy for Students Entering Military Service\n\nIf a student is called to active military service during the term in which he or she is enrolled and has not completed sufficient work for receiving grades, the University will waive tuition and fees for that term. The student should submit a withdrawal form to the Office of the Registrar. Once the student has withdrawn and submitted a copy of the military orders, the student will receive a 100% waiver of the tuition and fees or a 100% refund of tuition and fees paid.

From national franchises to local favorites, healthy meals to indulgent snacks, the possibilities are endless. Whether you want an early-morning coffee or need a late-night snack, we've got it covered. We recognize that our students have varying needs and tastes when it comes to food; that is why we offer some of the most flexible plans in the nation.\n\nBeing a part of “America’s Healthiest Campus”, means there are always well-balanced, nutritious options for our customers. Our Choose Orange food labeling program encourages students to choose healthier options while dining on campus by easily identifying better-for-you choices without having to read a nutrition label. The program is based on the U.S. Dietary Guidelines and qualified items are identified by the Choose Orange icon.\n\nAll freshmen living on campus are required to have a meal plan at the bronze level or higher. Campus meal plans are available to on- or off-campus students and residents, as well as any staff or faculty members.\n\nHow our Meal Plans Work\n\nOne week before the start of each semester, your total meal plan amount is automatically loaded on your student ID, which can be swiped at any dining outlet on campus like a debit card. You can immediately spend as much or as little as you want, whenever you want and your balance declines as you make purchases.\n\nYour meal plan is valid anywhere you can eat or drink on campus, including on-campus sporting venues. Each item on campus has a dollar value associated with it and you are only charged that specific amount each time you use your meal plan to dine on campus – no “blocks,” “meals” or limits!\n\nDidn’t use your full meal plan this semester? No worries! 100% of your remaining balance at the end of the fall semester will roll over to the following spring semester as long as you maintain a valid meal plan contract. Rollover will only be available from the fall to the spring semester within same academic year (this does not include the non-contract G plan). To learn more about everything UDS has to offer, please visit dining.okstate.edu. For meal plan questions, call 405-744-4920, email dining@okstate.edu, or visit the Meal Plan office at 301 Student Union.\n\nThe table below describes the University Dining meal plans available:\n\nCurrent 2024-2025 Plans\n\nMeal Plan Fees Meal Plan Meal Plan Rate Per Semester Dining Dollars Per Semester Platinum $2,425 $2,275 Gold $2,155^ $2,005 Silver $1,905^ $1,755 Bronze* $1,700^ $1,550 Copper $1,330^ $1,180 Plan G (non-contract)** $100 increments Not subject to rollover limits or restrictions.\n\n*Minimum meal plan for freshmen living on campus.\n\n^$150 operations surcharge per semester to all contracted meal plans to help offset the cost associated with back-end systems and infrastructure, repairs and maintenance, debt service repayment, and major deferred maintenance to support dining service program.\n\n**Option for students who wish to have occasional meals on campus.
