        "text": "A brief look at CSU\n\nCharleston Southern University is an independent, comprehensive Christian university grounded in the liberal arts tradition, affiliated with the South Carolina Baptist Convention. Founded as the Baptist College at Charleston in 1964 upon the principle that students should have an opportunity for a quality education under the guidance of Christian faculty, the institution changed its name to Charleston Southern University in 1990 to reflect the offering of graduate programs.\n\nCharleston Southern University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate, master’s, and doctorate degrees. Questions about the accreditation of Charleston Southern University may be directed in writing to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097, by calling 404-679-4500, or by using information available on SACSCOC’s website (www.sacscoc.org).\n\nCharleston Southern University’s vision is to be a “Christian university nationally recognized for integrating faith in learning, leading and serving”; the university’s mission is “Promoting Academic Excellence in a Christian Environment.” That excellence is demonstrated throughout the curriculum.\n\nEach undergraduate degree program is built upon a comprehensive liberal arts foundation which develops and strengthens the student’s skills in critical thinking and reasoning. Through their majors students are prepared to enter professions or graduate studies. In the master’s programs, students are exposed to the significant research of their professions and are educated in current trends and developments in their chosen fields. Through online programs students can develop these skills and advance in their educations remotely, and through participating in our online community further their walks in faith and fellowship as well. Doctoral students engage in their fields of study at the highest levels, participating in research or intensive clinical placements to develop and demonstrate expert knowledge of their professions.\n\nWho Are Our Students?\n\nTraditional Undergraduate Students\n\nTraditional undergraduate students live on campus and attend classes in person. They experience the benefits of proximity to at-home NCAA Division 1 athletics, Sweet 16 student life events, weekly chapel, Elevate worship nights, intramurals, 50+ student organizations, and more.\n\nCommuter Students\n\nCommuter students are traditional and nontraditional students living off-campus and attending classes in person. Traditional students experience an off-campus lifestyle with only a short drive to campus for events and activities from affordable residential areas in cities like North Charleston, Ladson, Goose Creek, Summerville, and Hanahan. Nontraditional students may be working and caring for families in addition to enjoying the in-person classroom experience. CSU also has the best parking of any college in the area and is a stop for Charleston’s metro bus transit, CARTA.\n\nOnline Students\n\nOnline students are our most diverse group. From out-of-state undergraduate students to working parents seeking an advanced degree, the online program is preparing students from all walks of life who need the flexibility of an online program to take the next step in their career. Online students can get connected to campus life through online chapel, tutoring, career services, and more.\n\nGraduate Students\n\nGraduate students are pursuing the next step in their career through an advanced degree. Some are fresh out of college and others are balancing life as a working professional and raising families. Many choose hybrid or online learning to accommodate their busy lifestyles in pursuit of their goal to attain an advanced degree.\n\nDegree Programs\n\nAnnual Costs\n\nTuition\n\n$31,870 (annual, traditional undergraduate*, includes books)\n\nHousing & Food\n\n$11,590 – $12,880 (annual)\n\nAcademics\n\nCampus Size\n\n300 acres — View the campus map, or take a virtual tour!\n\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio\n\n12:1 — The benefit of a smaller classroom is more one-on-one interaction between professors and students.\n\nStudent Body\n\n3,572 Enrollment (2,941 Undergraduate / 631 Graduate)\n\n34.5% People of color\n\n62.9% Female / 37.1% Male\n\n20.2% Out-of-state undergraduates representing 43 states\n\n33 Countries represented by international students\n\n11.9% Undergraduates age 25 or older\n\nLibrary\n\n1,822,288 physical and electronic items\n\n215 databases\n\nSelective Depository in the Federal Depository Library Program\n\nFull-time Faculty\n\n226\n\nAthletics\n\nNCAA Division I, competing in the Big South Conference\n\nMascot\n\nBucky – Buccaneers\n\nSchool Colors\n\nCSU Navy (Pantone 295) and Pirate Gold (Pantone 7503)\n\nAlma Mater\n\nHail to thee, O Charleston Southern: Fount of God’s great truth and knowledge. We thy children all sing praises ever more to thee. Source of inspiration, beacon of salvation; Honor, Courage, Faith and Justice, These thou hast taught us day by day. Hail to thee, O Charleston Southern, Alma Mater Hail!\n\nCSU Victory"
