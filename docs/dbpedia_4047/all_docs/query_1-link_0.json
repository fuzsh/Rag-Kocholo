        "text": "In September 2001, the Board of Trustees approved the administration’s strategic plan to expand the College’s curriculum, strengthen the quality of its faculty, and increase student enrollment. During the years between 2006 and 2009, the College executed some of the most aggressive expansions in enrollment and facilities in its history.\n\nIn 2001, 672 students were enrolled at Lane. In Fall 2009, student enrollment was 2,250, a 235 percent increase, of which the ratio of males to females was approximately 1:1. To accommodate planned and sustained growth in student enrollment, the College’s administration established a strategic plan to meet the needs of the increased student population.\n\nDuring the fall 2002, the College began to expand its campus acreage and, in the summer of 2003, began extensive renovations of The Archives, now known as the Water Tower Place. As a result of these renovations, on November 4, 2004, the Cyber Café opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The facility is suited for meetings, coffee, or quiet study. During the evenings, the Café is also utilized by students for live entertainment and poetry readings.\n\nIn July 2005, the College acquired the FCC license to operate its own radio station, WLCD-FM. Lane is one of only two private colleges or universities in West Tennessee with its own full-time radio station.\n\nBetween March and December 2006, the College acquired an off-campus residence hall named Eastbrooke, with a capacity for 76 occupants; renovated P.R. Shy Hall (formerly named Meeting Hall and Production Center), the home of WLCD; secured through a gift from the City of Jackson the 3,500-seat (another document indicates 2,500-seat) Rothrock Stadium located on the west side of Hays Avenue between Lexington and College streets, now Lane Field, the home of the Lane College Dragons football team; purchased a telecommunications system to alert students, faculty, and staff of any emergency; and bought the historic St. Paul CME Church building located on the College’s eastern boundary. This building has been renamed The Lighthouse.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the College completed construction of two new residence halls: The Edens and The Orchards, each with a capacity of 86 students; and a new dining facility, Phillips Hall, which as the result of a 2009 expansion, now seats 800 students.\n\nBeginning in summer 2008 and continuing through 2009, the College completed the construction of three (3) residence halls (Alumni, Harper, and Jennie E. Lane) and a 42,000 square foot Science and Business Building. Alumni Hall accommodates 86 students and Harper Hall and Jennie E. Lane Hall each accommodates 129 students.\n\nA major facelift along the heart of the College during the summer of 2010, particularly the three-block area proceeding easterly on Lane Avenue from the railroad tracks to Middleton Street, heightened the aesthetic appeal of the campus. The project included the installation of decorative streetlights and crosswalks, street resurfacing, sidewalk replacements, landscaping beautification, and the installation of brick overlays in front of Cleaves Hall.\n\nAlso, during the summer of 2010, the College completed construction of a pedestrian underpass that connects Harper Hall, a men’s residence hall, with the North campus by creating a walkway under the West Tennessee Railroad.\n\nIn October 2010, the College completed construction of the new Berry Hall, replacing the former building that was moved to campus over 65 years ago. This building, now called the Berry Hall Teaching Learning Center is the facility where teacher education courses are taught and education faculty offices are located. Additionally, the Teaching Learning Center houses a resource area in which materials are available to enhance instruction.\n\nThe year 2012 was marked by enormous growth, but also the upholding of its Mission to serve the disadvantaged. Community health initiatives promoting HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of such diseases as diabetes and hypertension have been implemented in the College’s Wellness Program since 2006.\n\nIn July 2013, the College acquired the former Baptist Student Union Building located on Middleton Street from the Tennessee Baptist Missionary and Education (TBM&E) Convention. It is utilized as office space for faculty and staff.\n\nDr. McClure passed away after a short illness in December 2013 after leading the College for twenty-one years.\n\nDr. Logan Hampton was named the 10th President of Lane College by the Board of Trustees on June 12, 2014. He assumed this role with a commitment to advance the mission of the College. Under his leadership, Dr. Hampton has launched transformative initiatives to lead the campus in expanding online course offerings, receiving approval from SACSCOC to offer associate degrees and online instruction for the Bachelor of Arts in Religion, strengthening the College’s brand and Christian ethos, establishing a more conventional student residential community with a robust first-year experience program, and improving the arts, recreation, and athletic facilities. Giving to the College has increased significantly and steadily since Dr. Hampton’s arrival at Lane.\n\nOne of Dr. Hampton’s marquee initiatives is the Power of Potential® (POP) Scholars Program launched in 2015. Built on the premise that preparing students for lives of meaningful work has always been a central purpose of the College, the Program is designed to develop and enhance skills necessary to prepare each scholar to be an expert learner and assume leadership roles on campus and beyond. The program, led by two Scholar Leaders, is managed by students for students. Together, cohorts of students join a community of scholars aimed at attracting and supporting talented students.\n\nIn 2017, President Hampton led the campus to develop five strategic themes. Since its founding, the College has transformed lives, liberated minds and souls, and celebrated excellence in Christ as the institution has helped each student to achieve and realize the Power of Potential®.\n\nUnder the leadership of President Hampton, the College was designated a veteran-friendly campus. The College continued the improvement of existing facilities with the renovation of the aquatic center and gym floor in the J.F. Lane Building and bathroom areas in Cleaves, Hamlett, Graves, and Smith Halls. In addition, computer laboratories were added to each of these residential facilities and the windows were replaced in Cleaves Hall. During the 2018-19 year, the College completed the renovation of the Kirkendoll Student Union Building to include state-of-the-art conference facilities, meeting rooms, and student lounge areas. Lane Institute, First-Year Experience, and Second-Year Experience are housed on the lower level of the facility. In this same year, the Lady Dragons made history as the 2019 SIAC Women’s Basketball Champions.\n\nDuring the 2018-19 academic year, the College also was successful in submitting its Fifth-Year Interim Report to SACSCOC. The Report, along with the QEP Impact Report, was accepted without any follow-up reports required.\n\nDr. Hampton also sought to expand community support and involvement. Through a partnership with the Jackson-Madison County School System, the College was granted a lease of the music area at the former Jackson-Central Merry High School campus.\n\nPresident Hampton has dedicated significant time and energy to igniting creativity and full participation within the campus community. This cross-institutional approach has contributed to an increase in successful grant making; the creation of the Student Textbook Exchange Program (STEP), a collaboration of Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, and Auxiliary Services that provides each student with course materials; and, in 2019, broadened the pathway for students through enhanced interactions between the College and a top research university.\n\nIn Spring 2020, the College was gifted the former Lincoln Elementary School property by the City of Jackson. This property houses faculty offices and practice areas for the Concert Choir and the cheerleading program.\n\nDue to the global COVID-19 pandemic, higher education has experienced a transformational period and Lane College was no exception to the trends, both long- and short-term. Since the sudden pivot to online and hybrid instruction in March 2020 and continuing through the Spring 2021 semester, the College remained committed to supporting the well-being of its students and the need for both flexibility and compassion during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThrough this difficult season, President Hampton used this global pandemic as an opportunity to welcome creative ways to pursue a path forward and cultivate an environment of incremental improvement and innovation. In so doing, Dr. Hampton broadened the College’s national reach, raised the profile of the campus, and promoted collaboration across academic disciplines and administrative units as he guided the College through a period of significant financial challenges.\n\nIn June 2020, U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) invited Dr. Hampton to testify on behalf of the HBCU community, in particular, and the greater higher education community, in general. During his testimony, Dr. Hampton asked for $1 billion in support for HBCUs, the doubling of the Pell grant, and relief from the HBCU Capital Financing Program. Thus, in December 2020, the passage of the coronavirus stimulus legislation included $1.7 billion appropriated for HBCUs, increases in both the amount of the Pell grants and the number of eligible students; and forgiveness of the $1.3 billion in loans secured through the HBCU Capital Financing Program for several institutions.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings, Lane College has been a source of inspiration for countless numbers of youth and adults throughout this nation. Today, it stands as a symbol of Christian education for persons of all faiths, creeds, colors, and nationalities."
