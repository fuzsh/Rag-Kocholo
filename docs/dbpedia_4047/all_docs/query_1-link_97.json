Posse extends to these students the opportunity to pursue personal and academic excellence by placing them in supportive, multicultural teams—Posses—of 10 students. Posse partner colleges and universities award Posse Scholars four-year, full-tuition leadership scholarships.\n\nCheck out “The Posse Video” from The Posse Foundation on Vimeo.\n\nCLICK HERE to view Posse Chicago Brochure\n\nFor more information visit: www.possefoundation.org\n\nPOSSE Chicago Partner Colleges & Universities:\n\nConnecticut College - New London, Connecticut\n\nCornell University (Arts & Sciences) - Ithaca, New York\n\nDePauw University - Greencastle, Indiana\n\nDickinson College - Carlisle, Pennsylvania\n\nHobart & William Smith Colleges - Geneva, New York\n\nMiddlebury College - Middlebury, Vermont\n\nOberlin College - Oberlin, Ohio\n\nPomona College - Claremont, California\n\nTrinity College - Hartford, Connecticut\n\nUniversity of North Carolina School of the Arts - Winston-Salem, North Carolina\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison - Madison, Wisconsin\n\nWhitman College - Walla Walla, Washington\n\nWhy POSSE?\n\nThe Posse Foundation has three goals: 1) to expand the pool from which top colleges and universities can recruit outstanding young leaders from diverse backgrounds; 2) to help these institutions build more interactive campus environments so that they can become more welcoming institutions for students from all backgrounds; 3) to ensure that Posse Scholars persist in their academic studies and graduate so that they can take on leadership positions in the workforce.\n\nAre you POSSE?\n\nPosse is looking for individuals who have demonstrated leadership ability, communication and team building skills. High school grade point average and SAT/ACT scores are considered but are not solely the basis for selection. Posse looks for students who have done well academically, but who may not be considering (or might be missed by) some of the top universities (which often rely more heavily upon traditional admissions measures such as SAT/ACT scores). Winners of the Posse Scholarship have been positive contributors to their schools and communities. They are the kinds of students who change the climate for the better. They are interested in issues of community and diversity. They are mature team-players who are able to not only take care of themselves, but also to look out for their peers. Remember, Posse welcomes nontraditional candidates—those who may not have considered, or may have been overlooked by top colleges. We are looking for the students who have the perseverance and drive to make it in a highly competitive academic environment if given the support of a positive team of peers, a Posse.\n\nThe POSSE Nominee Application Process:\n\nLane Tech can nominate 25 POSSE candidates each year. Candidates are selected during their Junior year in May. In order to be considered as a POSSE Scholar Nominee, Juniors must submit an Online Nomination Application. Ms. Console, Counselor, along with her team, reviews nomination applications and selects the candidates.\n\nCLICK HERE to complete the POSSE NOMINATION APPLICATION\n\nApplication Deadline: Wednesday, May 1st (extensions available-email rconsole@cps.edu)\n\nPOSSE Informational Meeting for Juniors:\n\nWhen: Wednesday, April 10th @ 8:47 AM (Advisory/Champions Hour) or 11:53 AM (5th Period Lunch)\n\nWhere: CCC (Room 135)\n\nDescription: Juniors who are interested in the POSSE Scholarship are welcomed to attend an informational meeting. This is a great opportunity to learn more about POSSE and see if it is a good fit for you! You will learn about the scholarship program and the nomination application process.\n\nDynamic Assessment Process (DAP):\n\nAfter being selected as a POSSE Nominee, students undergo a Dynamic Assessment Process (DAP). Posse’s Dynamic Assessment Process (DAP) is a unique evaluation method that identifies young leaders with great potential.\n\nRunning from September through December each year, DAP finds students who might be missed by the traditional admissions criteria at highly selective schools but who can excel on campus. DAP uses nontraditional forums to evaluate potential, offering nominated students an opportunity to demonstrate their intrinsic leadership ability, their skill at working in a team setting, and their motivation and drive to succeed.\n\nDAP has proven to be an extremely effective tool. Using the three-part process, which includes group and individual interviews, Posse staff and partner college administrators ultimately select a diverse group of 10 students—a Posse—for each institution.\n\nPrevious POSSE Winners:\n\n94 Lane Posse Scholars since 2012!...that’s $25.5 million!

All of the awards are designed to prepare students to make the most of their chances in the college admissions process. The awards include:\n\nFull scholarships to summer programs at leading universities such as Brandeis, Emory, Harvard, Notre Dame, Stanford, Penn, and Yale\n\nInvitations to attend the annual QuestBridge College Admissions Conferences, where students can meet college admissions officers and attend workshops on applying to leading colleges as low-income students\n\nIndividualized college counseling provided by QuestBridge staff and current Quest Scholars\n\nAll-expense-paid visits to partner college campuses\n\nTele-mentoring with Amherst College students about the college admissions process\n\nWhat is the QuestBridge National College Match?\n\nThe QuestBridge National College Match helps outstanding low-income high school seniors gain admission and full four-year scholarships to some of the nation's most selective colleges.\n\nQuestBridge works with over 33 partner colleges that actively seek students who have overcome economic obstacles to achieve academic success. The QuestBridge application provides admissions officers with a fuller picture of students' unique circumstances and accomplishments. If a student is admitted to a partner college through the College Match, the college will provide a scholarship that covers the full cost of tuition, room, and board, typically worth around $200,000 or more.\n\nEven though the \"sticker price\" of attending many private colleges is quite high, QuestBridge's partner colleges offer generous financial aid packages that cover 100% of demonstrated financial need, making them very affordable for low-income students. In 2011, 321 students gained admission and full scholarships to leading colleges through the College Match, and we anticipate over 1,300 more QuestBridge applicants will be admitted to our partner colleges via the regular admissions process with generous financial aid.\n\nCollege Match Schools for Undocumented Students: http://www.questbridge.org/images/stories/ncm-images/citizenship-info_updated_10.21.png\n\nEligibility Requirements:\n\nWhile there are no absolute academic or financial cut-offs, the majority of successful applicants share the following characteristics:\n\nThey are in the top 5% or 10% of their class.\n\nThey have strong grades in challenging classes and high standardized test scores.\n\nTheir household income is less than $60,000 a year, and often less than $50,000 a year.\n\nOften they are among the first generation in their family to attend college.\n\nThe College Prep Scholarship Application Process:\n\nHigh school juniors can apply to the College Prep Scholarship through a free online application. The application allows you to apply to multiple awards at once.

Each year, more than 800 deserving caddies across the country attend college on a four-year scholarship from the Evans Scholars Foundation. Selected applicants must have a strong caddie record, excellent grades, outstanding character and demonstrated financial need.\n\nSince 1930, when the first two Evans Scholars enrolled at Northwestern University, more than 10,000 outstanding young men and women have been awarded Evans Scholarships. Most recipients attend one of the 14 universities across the nation where the Evans Scholars Foundation owns and operates a Scholarship House.\n\nAt the Evans Scholarship Houses, students live and work together cooperatively. Each House elects its own officers, runs social and service activities, and participates in campus programs. The Evans Scholars Chapters have earned a reputation on each campus for scholastic achievement and excellence in community service.\n\nLiving and working together provides Evans Scholars an opportunity to develop leadership capabilities and strong communication skills. We believe that the sense of empowerment fostered through chapter living is largely responsible for the tremendous success of our 14 Evans Scholarship Houses. When you compare our chapter houses with other campus organizations, they rank at or near the top in academics and community service.\n\nFor more information visit: www.wgaesf.org\n\nWhich Universities can I attend?\n\nScholarships are awarded to the universities listed below, depending on the state in which the candidate resides.
