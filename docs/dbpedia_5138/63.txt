The most successful team in baseball history, the New York Yankees may also be the most storied franchise in all sports. The team has won a record 27 World Series titles and 40 American League (AL) pennants. The Yankees are based in the New York City borough of the Bronx.

The franchise began in 1901 in Baltimore, Maryland, competing as the Orioles in the AL for two seasons. The struggling Baltimore team was bought by Frank Farrell and Bill Devery in 1903 and brought to New York. Their first home in the city was Hilltop Park (1903–12), one of Manhattan’s highest points, which led to the name New York Highlanders. Local sportswriters often referred to the team as “Yankees” or “Yanks,” because the team was in the American League. After the club moved to the Polo Grounds in 1913, the name Highlanders fell further into disuse, and the team was officially renamed the Yankees. They played at the Polo Grounds until 1922 and then moved to Yankee Stadium, where they played from 1923 to 2008. The team moved to a new ballpark, also named Yankee Stadium, in 2009.

The team was not a regular pennant contender during its first 18 years in New York. Its fortunes changed completely in 1920, however, with the acquisition of slugger Babe Ruth from the Boston Red Sox—the most famous sale in baseball history. With the superstar pitcher-turned-outfielder leading the charge, the Yankees dynasty began to take shape during his second season with the team. The team won three consecutive AL championships and its first World Series title (1923). The Yankees solidified their command throughout the 1920s and ’30s, winning 11 pennants and eight World Series championships, with contributions by such baseball legends as first baseman Lou Gehrig and outfielder Joe DiMaggio. In the mid-1920s the hard-hitting Yankees lineup—including Ruth, Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, Bob Meusel, and Earle Combs—earned the nickname Murderers’ Row.

Despite losing Gehrig to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (better known as Lou Gehrig disease) and Ruth to retirement, the Yankees continued their dominance in the 1940s. With DiMaggio as the star, the team won three consecutive league pennants (1941–43) and two World Series championships (1941, 1943). This stretch was followed by five consecutive World Series titles (1949–53) under manager Casey Stengel, whose squads featured such greats as center fielder Mickey Mantle, catcher Yogi Berra, shortstop Phil Rizzuto, and pitcher Whitey Ford. In 12 seasons as the team’s manager, Stengel won 10 AL pennants and seven World Series.
