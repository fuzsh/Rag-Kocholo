        "text": "The New York Yankees will host an Irish Heritage night this summer. Arguably the most successful professional sports franchise in the US, having set numerous MLB records, the baseball team will celebrate Ireland in August.\n\nThe Yankees will take on the Colorado Rockies for the Irish Heritage Cap Game on August 23 at Yankee Stadium to pay homage to Irish culture. It follows a string of highly successful Irish Heritage evenings in the past.\n\nA portion of each ticket sold will support the Aisling Irish Community Center which has served the Irish community in Woodlawn and Yonkers for 25 years. Based on McLean Avenue, the nonprofit organization has long supported Irish immigrants coming to New York, ensuring they have the resources to connect with the local community.\n\nNew York Jets to expand into Ireland, joining Pittsburgh Steelers and Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nFormer Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher John O’Reilly 'thankful' as he signs to Irish Wolfhounds\n\nNeither the Rockies nor the Yankees made the playoffs in the 2023 season and Irish Heritage night will be their first meeting of the 2024 season. Fans who purchase tickets through this offer will bag a special New York Yankees hat with the Irish flag.\n\nTickets range from $58-$105. Once inside the Stadium, fans should head over to the redemption table located on the Field Level (100 Level) next to Gate 2 up to 60 minutes after the originally scheduled first pitch to get their hat.\n\nJuan Soto wowed on defense on Thursday in his New York Yankees debut after throwing out the potential tying run at the plate in the ninth inning. He started New York’s comeback from a four-run deficit in a season-opening 5-4 win over the Houston Astros.\n\nHouston’s Cristian Javier, who took the loss in Game 7 of the ALCS, opposes Carlos Rodón when the four-game series continues on Friday. The Yankees have won 20 American League East Division titles, 40 American League pennants, and 27 World Series championships, all of which are MLB records."
