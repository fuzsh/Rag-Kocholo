        "text": "Yankees star Aaron Judge’s record-breaking feat gets mindblown CC Sabathia reaction\n\nThere are no superlatives left to describe Aaron Judge. The towering slugger swatted the 300th homer of his career in the New York Yankees’ 10-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday, becoming the fastest player to ever reach the milestone.\n\nYankees’ Juan Soto in Babe Ruth territory after blast vs. White Sox\n\nThe New York Yankees have gotten everything they could have ever wanted out of Juan Soto. The 25-year-old has been crushing it at the plate, especially of late.\n\nYankees Make IL Decision on Jazz Chisholm Jr.\n\nThe inevitable has occurred and now the New York Yankees will be hoping it won't be worst case scenario. On Wednesday, the Yankees officially placed the versatile Jazz Chisholm Jr.\n\nYankees Surprisingly DFA Hurler Just Weeks After Acquiring Him\n\nThe New York Yankees clearly aren't liking what they are seeing from one of the players they acquired ahead of the 2024 Major League Baseball trade deadline.\n\nAaron Judge Joins New York Yankees Legends Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig in History Books\n\nAaron Judge has been making history by blasting home runs for as long as he's been in the big leagues. The New York Yankees outfielder didn't hit any against the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday – he left that up to Juan Soto.\n\nYankees promote Oswald Peraza to replace injured star infielder\n\nThe New York Yankees are placing Jazz Chisholm on the IL as they try and figure out the severity of his UCL injury, and they’ll be calling up Oswald Peraza in the meantime to fill out their roster.\n\nNew York Yankees' Juan Soto Shatters All Kinds of Records With 3-Home Run Explosion\n\nJuan Soto blew up in a major way on Tuesday night, lifting the New York Yankees to victory in the process. New York was fresh off a historic 12-2 loss to the last-place Chicago White Sox on Monday, in dire need of a boost to remain in the race for the AL East crown.\n\nThe Yankees should consider calling up interesting 24-year-old infield prospect\n\nWith the New York Yankees awaiting news on the severity of Jazz Chisholm’s UCL injury, there’s a question about who they’ll turn to for the infield. Oswaldo Cabrera and DJ LeMahieu are their two options to cover there on the roster right now, but it would make sense for them to bring someone up from Triple-A to get a shot.\n\nThe Yankees Have a Future Starting Pitcher Brewing in Double-A\n\nOne of the most refreshing parts of the MLB draft is to see how a team’s selections flourish down the road. The New York Yankees have had some phenomenal draft selections over the years."
