        "text": "Mike Trout was so great at such a young age that he almost immediately transcended comparisons with his contemporaries. The baseball community had to draw from generational greats of other eras to put in perspective what they were seeing from the five-tooled center fielder. Going back to his first full season in the majors in 2012, Hall of Famer Al Kaline was among others saying that the then 20-year-old reminded him “a little of Mantle.” The similarities to Mantle continued throughout Trout’s dominance of the mid-to-late 2010s. The Mantle comparison still tracks, especially when looking at 162-game averages.\n\nHowever, with the crushing announcement that Trout will not return this season, similarities with another Yankee great, Don Mattingly, come to mind.\n\nWhile this week’s injury update sparked this comparison, similarities in their career arcs extend beyond their respective injury issues. They mirrored a similar on-field demeanor and approach. We saw greatness during their peaks, with injuries prevented them from reaching their full potential with their cumulative stats. Additionally, both the Angels and Yankees failed to capitalize on their primes, resulting in each player appearing in just one playoff series throughout their careers.\n\nYou, reader, know how to access Baseball Reference and FanGraphs. Trout was the better statistical player than Mattingly in both longevity and peak. It’s also important to establish that Trout’s career story is not close to finished. I am holding out hope that Trout—who turned 33 yesterday—will see his career statistics stack up closer to Mantle and Ken Griffey Jr.\n\nBut the similarities pile up once we move past the fact that Trout is another level as a player. Both players carried themselves in similar fashions. They each built up a reputation of being the type of athlete that you want your child to pick as their role model. Mattingly was respected by peers and fans as a gritty workhorse that brought it every day. Perhaps to his detriment. He worked himself so hard, he feared that he ran himself into the ground. “I should have learned quicker to not to beat my body up, and if I did less, I could perform better,” said Mattingly, in the MLB Network documentary, “Donnie Baseball.”\n\nFor older millennials and the younger Gen X generation of baseball fans, Mattingly will hold a special place in their heart, and there’s a good chance that Mattingly is their favorite player. He had a fittingly iconic ‘80s stache, a smooth swing, and a modest, laid-back midwestern demeanor when he talked. Unlike Trout, he did agree to some media opportunities, like appearing as a voice on the Simpsons, and being a guest on David Letterman:\n\nYou get a sense of the humility in the beginning of the interview that made Donnie Baseball endearing. At the same time, he also did not hold back talking about fighting for a better contract in arbitration, and how he did not appreciate Steinbrenner calling him selfish in his pursuit of home runs. Sometimes a lack of fire can be mistaken for complacency, but you can see his competitiveness and confidence in his abilities.\n\nAlthough reserved in his personality at times, Mattingly was named the Yankees’ tenth team captain in 1991. Similar to Trout, it was a role that he had to grow into. “I’ll lead by example,” he said during the 1991 spring training right after being named. “I’m not a talker. What’s a leader anyway? I think it’s anybody who goes about his job consistently.”\n\nSo while quiet, Mattingly earned his respect through his effort and performance. During his era, he was celebrated for his steadiness and even-keeled persona, perhaps highlighting a contrast to the reaction to Trout’s personality in the 2010s. Inscribed on his Monument Park plaque was the essence of what it meant to be a fan of Donnie Baseball. “...a humble man of grace and dignity, a captain who led by example, proud of the Pinstripe tradition and dedicated to the pursuit of excellence, a Yankee forever.”\n\nFor Trout, he also shared that quiet confidence that may have not shown itself in interviews or the traditional ways confidence is displayed on the field. However, his former manager, Mike Scioscia said, “I’ve never been around a player with such internal confidence from a young age — and absolutely trusting his talent was going to overcome any challenge.” In the same quote, the skipper also said that he was grounded and that ‘he’s never been around a more team-oriented player.”\n\nBoth players certainly believed in themselves. While it’s rare to find great athletes that lack confidence, both had a confidence where they felt secure enough in their own skills to display a humbleness and be team-focused attitude on the field.\n\nTrout’s matter of fact way demeanor in interviews and his overall muted media presence was often viewed negatively. His most notable IMDb credit is when he appeared as an “audience member” in the 2018 Super Bowl when his Eagles beat the Patriots. He has often been dogged by questions and concerns from baseball commentators, and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, about why he wasn’t a bigger star, more marketable, and has not resonated more outside the stat-obsessed community. He was used as a symbol to show baseball’s decline in national relevance.\n\nThere was validity to this: as a quick and imprecise marker of Trout’s popularity, he ranked seventh (2014), fifth (2016), and ninth (2019) in jersey sales during his three MVP seasons. There was always a feeling that his production on the field did not correspond with his popularity. He had a fan base that appreciated the way he just wanted to go about his business, but the concerns about baseball losing national capital manifested in worries about Trout’s Q-rating.\n\nThe bittersweet undertones are inescapable for the two players’ careers, with injuries and lack of team success when they were at their peaks. That seems unjust for two players that, at certain moments, were each at least in the conversation for being the best in the game. Both Mattingly and Trout had lofty expectations in their early 20s after hitting the ground running in their first full seasons. However, injuries hampered both of their cumulative numbers. Baseball fans often value career totals over peaks, especially in Hall of Fame discussions. So there will always be that curiosity of where they each would have ended up had they had better luck with their health.\n\nMattingly’s back issues in his late 20s limited his production, turning him into a league-average hitter and ruining a surefire Hall of Fame resume. He did not miss much time, but his back troubles prevented him from being in the conversation of upper-echelon of Yankee greats. (Pinstripe Alley ranked him 14th in our Yankees Top-100 series).\n\nFor Trout, his production has yet to significantly decline, but he has just missed a ton of time. By the end of this season, he will have played in just over 41 percent of games between 2021-24. Despite this, Hall of Fame expert and writer Jay Jaffe is confident Trout will be enshrined five years after his final game. Still, it appears he will fall short of reaching the career numbers that truly capture his greatness.\n\nThen there is the fact that both players were proof that one outstanding player cannot carry a team. During Trout’s stretch where he missed minimal time from 2012-2019 he made the postseason once. The Angels averaged 82 wins a season over those prime years. The Angels’ struggle became even more confounding when they added another generational talent with Shohei Ohtani. This classic post on Twitter/X was a good summary to explain to future generations the Ohtani and Trout Angels era:\n\nMattingly made the postseason in his final season, granted that he played in the pre-wild-card format until his final year in 1995. He was the consistent heartbeat for fans amid the chaos of the ‘80s and early ‘90s Yankee era. He experienced 12 managerial changes (three of which were Steinbrenner re-hiring Billy Martin) starting from his first full season in 1982. Through all the erratic decisions and off-field drama during this era for the franchise, Mattingly’s steady demeanor represented a contrast.\n\nA special moment for Mattingly came in 1995, during an epic Game 2 of the ALDS against Seattle, when he hit his first, and only, postseason home run to give the Yankees the lead:\n\nThis moment was significant because Mattingly, who was clearly nearing the end of his career, had been enduring pain and still grinding it out every day while playing for forgettable Yankee teams, finally had his moment of postseason glory. It had been such a long time coming for the Captain that many otherwise Yankee haters watching that night likely shared in the joy of Mattingly finally getting his moment. Joe Posnanski wrote in his Hall of Fame case for Mattingly, “Donnie Baseball was the one Yankee that even Yankees haters loved.” However, it wasn’t a perfect storybook ending to his career. The team lost the series in heartbreaking fashion, and after some deliberation, Mattingly decided to retire that offseason.\n\nThe thing I find sad about Don Mattingly’s career in particular is not necessarily the back issues that limited his hitting numbers itself. It’s that there is an air of sadness when he’s talked about by fans that grew up with him. The fixation on what could have been. Reading a recap from the Times about his number retirement ceremony in 1997, the focus was on what could have been with his career, not what he actually did accomplish.\n\n‘’I hate talking about the back,’’ Mattingly said the day he had his No. 23 jersey retired at Yankee Stadium. ‘’It didn’t really matter. I am who I am. I tried to make the best of it. I didn’t want to talk about it. I didn’t want any sympathy from people. I didn’t want to hear people say, ‘How’s your back?’ Or, ‘He’s struggling because of his back.’ So what? I was able to play for 12 or 13 years, some of those years feeling pretty good, some of those years not feeling so good.”\n\nIf we break up Trout’s career into stages, we have the first section as his first seven seasons of dominance, and the second act being the 2020s of injuries and a COVID-shortened season. As fans of the game, hopefully we can shift into a happier third chapter of his career where he can have his “hang on to the roof” moment in a postseason, and dwell less on what could have been, as we so long have with Mattingly."
