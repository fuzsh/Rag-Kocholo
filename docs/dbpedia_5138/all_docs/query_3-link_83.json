        "text": "The Yankees are back in the ALCS, and it's against an all-too-familiar opponent.\n\nAfter a grueling battle against the Guardians in the ALDS, they're taking on a rested Astros team. This will be the third time in six years they've seen Houston in the championship series.\n\nFor Yankee fans, however, it doesn't matter who they're playing or when. They expect to win.\n\nThat expectation is well-earned. The Yankees are one of the most storied teams in sports, with a legacy that is synonymous with MLB excellence. With more than three dozen league pennants, more than two dozen world championships and over 20 Hall of Famers, anything less than a title is considered a failure, no matter how flawed the team turns out to be.\n\nMORE: How many World Series have the Astros won?\n\nThe 2022 Yankees are an interesting lot. Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton represent their best, but make no mistake, this is a flawed team. They're a slight underdog (+133) to win the ALCS, per Sports Interaction. They're entering the series battered and bruised. But the goal is still the same.\n\nHave the Yankees won the World Series?\n\nHave they ever.\n\nThe Yankees' 27 championships are the most in North American professional sports, with the NHL's Montreal Canadiens second at 24. They have won the American League pennant 40 times.\n\nMORE: When is the last time the Padres went to a World Series?\n\nSome of the Yankees' most famous players are enshrined in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. The list of player who have won championships in New York includes Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, Mariano Rivera and Derek Jeter. Judge is looking to join that company after a historic individual season.\n\nDespite the Astros' recent success, the Yankees are who we think they are. The team with the second-most world championships still in the playoffs? The Phillies, with two. The Astros have one and the Padres have none.\n\nWhen is the last time the Yankees made the World Series?\n\nIt's been an uncharacteristically long dry spell for the Yankees. The 2010s were just the second decade in which the Yankees didn't win a World Series, with the 1980s being the other. They took home the Commissioner's Trophy in 2009 with a 4-2 series win over the Phillies.\n\nYankees outfielder Hideki Matsui was the MVP of that series. \"Godzilla\" went 8 for 13 at the plate with three homers and a slash line of .615/.643/1.385 (2.027 OPS).\n\nThe Yankees' 12-season World Series drought is the third-longest in franchise history.\n\nYankees World Series appearances\n\nThe Yankees have a remarkably long history in the Fall Classic. They have made 40 World Series appearances to date. They're 27-13 in those appearances."
