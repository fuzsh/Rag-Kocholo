        "text": "New York Yankees Fantasy Baseball Daily Bullpen Updates and Closer Depth Chart\n\nPrevious updates:\n\nAugust 13, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Inheriting runners on second and third with no outs, Jake Cousins navigated around a one-out walk with a shallow flyout and a game-ending strikeout for his first career major league save. He threw 17 pitches (11 strikes – 64.7 Strike%) and five whiffs (29.4 SwStr%).\n\nTommy Kahnle gets credit for his ninth hold. He stranded two runners in the eighth but issued a walk and gave up a double in the ninth, prompting his removal.\n\nMark Leiter Jr. allowed a hit, an earned run, and two walks over two-thirds of the seventh.\n\nUpdated Hierarchy: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Jake Cousins\n\nAugust 11, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – An eventful 25th save for Clay Holmes. He took over in the eighth with a runner on and induced an inning-ending groundout by Corey Seager. In the ninth, he recorded two quick outs via strikeout, then his struggles ensued. After issuing consecutive two-out walks, Holmes allowed Adolis García’s RBI single. With runners on second and third, Leody Tavares grounded out. Holmes threw a season-high 45 pitches (24 strikes – 53.3 Strike%) and induced five whiffs (11.1 SwStr%). This marked his most pitches since August 20, 2019 (64 pitches over 3.2 innings). Since July 5, he’s converted six of 11 save chances.\n\nMark Leiter Jr. gave up three hits, including two home runs, three earned runs, and a walk, while striking out two in two-thirds of the eighth.\n\nTommy Kahnle allowed two hits and an unearned run in the seventh.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Mark Leiter Jr.\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Locking down his 24th save, Clay Holmes fired a clean top of the ninth and recorded two strikeouts during a three-run win over the Angels in Game 1. He threw 13 pitches (10 strikes – 76.9 Strike%) and produced three whiffs (23.1 SwStr%). He’s been scoreless in his last four appearances and converted three of four save chances.\n\nLuke Weaver notched his 18th hold with a clean eighth, striking out two.\n\nJake Cousins gave up two hits, including Zach Neto’s solo home run in the seventh.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Mark Leiter Jr.\n\nAugust 4, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – After an extended rain delay, Mark Leiter Jr. stranded a runner in the ninth and retired four of five batters, three via strikeout against Toronto. He collected his third win courtesy of a walk-off rally in the bottom of the tenth. He threw 22 pitches (14 strikes – 63.6 Strike%) and generated six whiffs (27.3 SwStr%).\n\nEnyel De Los Santos gave up a hit and recorded a strikeout over two-thirds of the ninth.\n\nClay Holmes gets tagged with his ninth blown save. He inherited a bases-loaded situation with one out in the eighth, allowing an Alejandro Kirk sacrifice fly, and recorded an inning-ending strikeout.\n\nTommy Kahnle was credited with his eighth hold, giving up an unearned run and two walks over one-third of the eighth.\n\nLuke Weaver logged 1.1 scoreless frames and walked one in his outing.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Mark Leiter Jr.\n\nAugust 3, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Summoned with the bases-loaded and two outs, Clay Holmes recorded a game-ending strikeout by George Springer for his 23rd save, throwing four pitches (75 Strike%) with three whiffs.\n\nMark Leiter Jr. allowed three hits during two-thirds of the ninth before being removed.\n\nTommy Kahnle tossed a scoreless eighth, giving up a hit and striking out one.\n\nLuke Weaver notched his 17th hold with a scoreless seventh.

He converted three of seven save opportunities in July and allowed at least a run in four outings.\n\nMark Leiter Jr. gave up three hits and an earned run while striking out two in the eighth, getting credit for his 16th hold.\n\nTommy Kahnle notched his seventh hold, stranding a runner and issuing a walk with a strikeout in two-thirds of the seventh.\n\nLuke Weaver recorded his 16th hold, allowing two hits and an earned run during his combined inning.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Mark Leiter Jr.\n\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Working two innings in the 11th and 12th, Michael Tonkin collected his fourth win and second blown save, allowing a hit, an unearned run, and a walk while striking out three.\n\nMark Leiter Jr. navigated around a hit and a walk for a scoreless tenth, stranding the “place” runner in his team debut.\n\nClay Holmes suffered his MLB-leading eighth blown save. He gave up three hits, an earned run on a wild pitch, and a walk (intentional – Kyle Schwarber) in the bottom of the ninth. He’s only converted two of his last six save chances and given up at least a run in four of his previous eight.\n\nLuke Weaver notched his 15th hold, retiring the side in the eighth.\n\nTommy Kahnle fired a clean seventh, striking out one for his sixth hold.\n\nUpdated Hierarchy: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Mark Leiter Jr.\n\nNew York Yankees – Making the first move in the reliever market on the last day of the trade deadline, the Yankee acquired Mark Leiter Jr. from the Cubs and he immediately slots into our hierarchy. Through seven outings in July, he’s been scoreless, and hitless, with 14 strikeouts against zero walks while recording three holds.\n\nUpdated Hierarchy: Clay Holmes | Mark Leiter Jr. | Tommy Kahnle\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – With the score tied in the bottom of the ninth, Clay Holmes retired the side and returned for the tenth with a three-run lead.

Much of this will depend on how the Yankees handle the trade deadline. New York should be adding one, if not two relievers for the stretch run, but will it shop at the top of the closer food chain? Time will tell.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Jake Cousins\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Deserving better, Clay Holmes suffered his fourth loss and sixth blown save during a walk-off loss in Baltimore. He should not issue two walks, but with two outs and the bases loaded, Anthony Volpe committed an error, letting a run score without recording an out. Then, Cedric Mullins hit an opposite-field fly ball, which Alex Verdugo misjudged, slipped and fell, letting the game-winning runs score. All three runs were unearned for Holmes, but his two hits and two walks will not help fantasy managers from a WHIP perspective. He enters the All-Star break, allowing at least a run in six of his last 10 appearances and multiple runs in five.\n\nJake Cousins stranded a runner and retired both batters, one via strikeout in the eighth. He’s been scoreless in his last four games, recording nine strikeouts during 4.2 innings.\n\nLuke Weaver allowed a hit and struck out one in a scoreless combined inning.\n\nUpdated Hierarchy: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Jake Cousins\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Nailing down his 21st save, Clay Holmes worked a scoreless ninth and recorded a strikeout. He hit Heston Kjerstad in the helmet with a pitch, precipitating a benches-clearing shoving match. Holmes threw 20 pitches (60 Strike%) and induced one whiff. He’s converted consecutive saves with a clean appearance in each.\n\nLuke Weaver secured his 13th hold with a clean eighth.\n\nTommy Kahnle notched his fifth hold, giving up a hit during a scoreless seventh.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Tommy Kahnle\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Recording his 20th save, first since June 9, Clay Holmes retired all four batters and stranded two in the eighth. He preserved a one-run win while striking out two. He threw 21 pitches (13 strikes – 61.9 Strike%) and induced two whiffs. He had allowed at least a run in five of his previous seven appearances, so fantasy managers hope he’s turning a corner.\n\nTommy Kahnle was credited with his fourth hold, allowing a hit and a walk while striking out one in two-thirds of the eighth.\n\nLuke Weaver tossed 1.2 scoreless, issuing two walks and striking out one.\n\nTim Hill collected his third win, stranding three runners in the fifth and working a scoreless combined innings.

He threw 32 pitches (62.5 Strike%) and induced one whiff.\n\nJosh Maciejewski finished the lopsided 10-run victory with two scoreless innings, yielding a hit and striking out four.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Michael Tonkin\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – One strike away from preserving a win, Clay Holmes allowed a Dom Smith single and a game-tying, two-run home run by Masataka Yoshida, resulting in his fifth blown save. He threw 30 pitches (60 Strike%) and did not induce a whiff against the Red Sox. He last recorded a save on June 9 and has allowed at least a run in five of his last seven games and multiple runs in four. With pressure mounting in the Bronx, he would be placed on the hot seat but there’s no clear alternative to replace him unless the team stops using Weaver in multiple-inning outings.\n\nTommy Kahnle suffered his first loss, giving up a two-run home run by Ceddanne Rafaela in the top of the tenth. He finished with two hits against, two runs (one earned), and a walk while striking out one.\n\nLuke Weaver tossed two scoreless frames, yielding a hit and striking out three for his 11th hold.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Michael Tonkin\n\nJune 28, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Inheriting three runners in the bottom of the fifth, Michael Tonkin stranded two. He let one score on an RBI hit-by-pitch (George Springer), retired a batter at home on a wild pitch, and induced an inning-ending strikeout. He collected his first win when his teammates scored six in the top of the sixth. Tonkin finished 1.2 innings, allowing a hit, an earned run, and striking out one.\n\nLuke Weaver notched his tenth hold despite giving up two hits, including a solo home run (Vlad Guerrero Jr.) and recorded two strikeouts.\n\nTommy Kahnle worked a scoreless eighth, yielding a hit and striking out one.\n\nTim Hill finished the lopsided 11-run win with a scoreless ninth, allowing a hit.\n\nHierarchy remains: Clay Holmes | Luke Weaver | Michael Tonkin\n\nJune 23, 2024\n\n(RP | NYY): Appearing during a loss, Clay Holmes fired a clean top of the ninth, recording two strikeouts against Atlanta’s 5-6-7 lineup pocket.

Anthony Misiewicz escaped the ninth with a scoreless outing even though he allowed two hits and a walk. Caleb Ferguson retired the side in the eighth.

Ferguson let one of two inherited runners score, giving up a hit, and a walk while striking out two over two-thirds of an inning. Clay Holmes collected his first win, along with suffering his first blown save, allowing a hit, three unearned runs, and striking out one over 1.1 innings.

Jonathan Loáisiga fired a clean ninth, striking out one.

He’s posted a robust seven strikeouts against zero walks with a minuscule 0.18 WHIP over 5.2 innings this season.\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Providing the high-leverage relievers rest, manager Aaron Boone called upon Victor González for the save in the bottom of the ninth, and he responded with a scoreless inning, yielding a one-out double, but retired the next two batters. Nick Burdi secured his first hold, firing a clean eighth while striking out one. Luke Weaver collected his second win, logging 2.1 innings, giving up two hits, an earned run, and a walk.\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Hanging on for his third save, Clay Holmes navigated around two hits with a ground out and two flyouts for a scoreless ninth, preserving a one-run win.

Jonathan Loáisiga suffered his first blown save, letting his only inherited runner score while conceding three hits and a walk while striking out one in his combined inning.\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Capping a third straight comeback win in Houston, Clay Holmes secured his second save working a scoreless ninth, working around a hit batter (Jeremy Peña) with three ground outs.

Nick Burdi issued a walk and recorded all three outs via strikeout in a scoreless eighth.\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Not only did Jonathan Loáisiga log 1.2 innings during his outing on Thursday, Bryan Hoch reported this will be his role for the upcoming season. In this configuration, he will receive two days of rest between outings, which limits his upside in leagues with holds, but increases his appeal in deeper leagues if he records vulture wins.\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – Making his spring debut, Clay Holmes fired a clean fourth, striking out one. He threw 11 pitches (8 strikes – 72.7 Strike percentage) with no whiffs.\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – It appears Tommy Kahnle is “behind on his buildup” for the regular season per Max Goodman on “X”. He has been throwing bullpens but will not appear in spring games until near the end of March.\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\nNew York Yankees – In Bryan Hoch’s 2024 roster projection for New York, he feels Tommy Kahnle and Jonathan Loáisiga will fill the primary set-up roles for “closer” Clay Holmes. But note the lack of depth in this leverage ladder when viewing the link.\n\nSeptember 26, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Tommy Kahnle was placed on the IL with right shoulder inflammation, effectively ending his season. Look for Ian Hamilton to get any opportunities that don’t go to Clay Holmes in the final week.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Hamilton | Weissert.\n\nSeptember 23, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Jhony Brito pitched the final 3.2 innings of a Yankees 7-1 win to pick up his first save. In other Yankees’ bullpen news, Wandy Peralta was placed on the IL with a triceps injury. Ian Hamilton will take his place on the hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Kahnle | Hamilton.\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — As foretold by the Vulture Save Watch, Tommy Kahnle was used in a closing role during Thursday’s doubleheader against the Red Sox. He tossed the final two innings to earn the save in the nightcap.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | Kahnle | Peralta.\n\nSeptember 13, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — After all three members of the Yankees’ hierarchy pitched in game one of Tuesday’s doubleheader sweep of the Red Sox, Nick Ramirez finished off the nightcap with a perfect ninth inning for his first career save.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | Kahnle | Peralta.\n\nAugust 31, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Don’t look now, but the Yankees have reeled off three wins in a row and could be making an improbable push for the — just kidding, they’re still totally cooked. But Ian Hamilton did pick up a nice three-inning save for them last night.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | Kahnle | Peralta.\n\nAugust 14, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Clay Holmes has been great lately, but yesterday was bad, as he coughed up a 4-run lead and then took the loss after Tommy Kahnle was unable to stem the damage. Holmes was in and out of a committee earlier this season, and we’ll see if this outing changes the way the Yankees approach the 9th inning. Our guess is it won’t… yet. In other news, Michael King is being stretched out to potentially start games, so we’ll swap Wandy Peralta into the hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Kahnle | Peralta.\n\nJuly 23, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Clay Holmes struck out two in a scoreless inning to pick up his 13th save of the season. Holmes also picked up the save on Friday night and has now recorded the last three saves for the Yankees and four of the last five. That is enough to kick the committee tag for now even if there will likely still be nights that the Yankees use another member of their deep bullpen to close out a game.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | Kahnle | King.\n\nJuly 16, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Clay Holmes closed out a 6-3 Yankees’ victory and earned his 11th save of the season. Holmes is the best bet for a save on any given night but that’s not enough to kick the committee tag yet. We will monitor if that changes and Holmes can settle in the role as the primary closer.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Kahnle | King.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 9, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Michael King relieved starter Gerrit Cole and recorded the last five outs of the game to pick up his 6th save of the season. The Yankees are still in committee mode and this save moves King back onto the hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Holmes | Kahnle | King.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Michael King may have been off the hierarchy, but the Vulture Save Watch picked him as the best chance to pull a save last night. He got the ball with a 2 run lead, and worked a scoreless inning for his 5th save on the year. King needed a good outing badly, having given up runs in 5 of his last 6 appearances before last night. Maybe this is the start of him righting the ship, but given how heavily worked the Yankees bullpen had been, we will leave the hierarchy in place.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Kahnle | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 25, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees were lining up to use Tommy Kahnle in the 7th, Wandy Peralta in the 8th, and Clay Holmes in the 9th but after Peralta ran into some trouble, Holmes was needed to finish out the 8th. That left Ron Marinaccio for the 9th and he pitched a scoreless inning for his second save of the season. The Yankees bullpen have a lot of solid options at the back-end of their bullpen but there are two guys heading in opposite directions right now and we will swap them on the hiearchy. Tommy Kahnle has 10 straight scoreless appearances since returning from the IL and has only allowed three hits. Meanwhile, Michael King has given up runs in five of his last six appearances.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Holmes | Kahnle | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 22, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Clay Holmes did in fact get Wednesday off after a five-out save on Tuesday, but Michael King wasn’t able to finish things off. With a three-run lead and runners on the corners, Aaron Boone turned to Tommy Kahnle, who surrendered a sac fly before shutting the door with a strikeout. Kahnle has been unhittable since his return from injury, striking out nine in eight appearances and allowing only a hit batsman over the last six. Kahnle is pushing Wandy Peralta hard for a spot in this closer committee.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 14, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – After Wandy Peralta ran into trouble in the eighth inning, Clay Holmes came on to strike out both batters he faced, stranding runners on second and third and preserving the Yankees’ one-run lead. That set the stage for Michael King to earn his first save since May 15 with a 1-2-3 ninth inning. Despite King’s first save in a month, Holmes remains at the top of this committee; he would have most certainly gotten the save chance if he didn’t have to bail out Peralta in the eighth.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 11, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Clay Holmes pitched a scoreless 9th inning with a pair of strikeouts yesterday to pick up his 8th save of the season. Tommy Kahnle recorded the 8th inning hold ahead of Holmes and he has four scoreless appearances since his debut at the beginning of June. Holmes has recorded the last two saves for the Yankees and four of the last five. Meanwhile, Michael King has not recorded a save since May 15th. We will move Clay Holmes to the head of this committee and see how the Yankees continue to manage the back-end of their bullpen.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Michael King allowed two runs across two innings in Game 1 of a doubleheader Thursday to take the blown save and loss. In Game 2, Clay Holmes tossed a scoreless ninth inning for his seventh save, as projected by the Vulture Save Watch. Holmes has three of New York’s past four saves as this bullpen situation continues to be murky.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Holmes | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 5, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – With Michael King having thrown 33 pitches on Saturday, the Yankees leaned on Clay Holmes, who finished the 7th inning and got the first two outs of the 8th, followed by Wandy Peralta, who notched the final four outs for his 4th save of the year.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Holmes | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 4, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – After Wandy Peralta gave up a single, triple, and walk without recording any outs to start the 7th inning, the Yankees brought on Michael King. King gave up a single to the first batter he faced but then recorded three straight outs against the Dodgers’ very dangerous top of the lineup. King stuck around and pitched a scoreless 8th inning with a pair of strikeouts and that left Clay Holmes for the 9th. Holmes responded with a scoreless 9th inning to pick up his 6th save of the season. Holmes has started to settle in, as he has only allowed one earned run in his last 14 appearances, and we will see if he can work his way back to the top of this committee.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *King | Holmes | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 2, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Tommy Kahnle has been activated off the 60-day IL and could be in line for late-innings work for the Yankees. We’ll see how he’s deployed.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Peralta | Holmes.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Michael King got the day off after throwing 33 pitches on Saturday, and a solid 8th from Wandy Peralta was followed by a deeply shaky 9th by Clay Holmes (24 pitches, 3 baserunners), but Holmes got the job done to earn his 5th save of the year. This remains a committee until further notice.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Peralta | Holmes.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 21, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Ryan Weber picked up an extra-innings save yesterday as he pitched a scoreless 10th inning. Michael King and Clay Holmes pitched earlier in the game and Wandy Peralta got the day off after pitching in three of the past four games.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Peralta | Holmes.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 19, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – The Vulture Save Watch called an off-day Thursday for Michael King, but Wandy Peralta also got the night off after he worked in two straight, leaving Ron Marinaccio to close out the ninth on seven pitches for his first save. This is a pretty fluid situation that we’ll continue to monitor.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Peralta | Holmes.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 17, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Michael King still isn’t pitching on consecutive days, which paved the way for Clay Holmes in the eighth and Wandy Peralta in the ninth to close out a Yankee win.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Peralta | Holmes.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – After Ian Hamilton got into a little trouble in the 8th, Michael King came on and recorded the last four outs of the game to earn his 3rd save. King maintains his spot atop this committee, though we’d still like to see if/when he can pitch back to back games before we consider making any changes here.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Peralta | Holmes.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 14, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Wandy Peralta pitched a scoreless 9th inning to pick up his second straight save. The Yankees bullpen is wide open right now and two straight saves are enough to get Peralta back on the hierarchy. We will continue to monitor this situation to see if anybody can emerge as the primary closer moving forward.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *King | Peralta | Holmes.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees were en route to a bullpen loss after Michael King gave up a go ahead homer in the top of the 8th. When the Yankees retook the lead in the bottom half, they turned to proven closer Wandy Peralta for the tough save chance. Peralta converted for his first save on the season, giving him 10 on his career. Peralta is riding an 8 game scoreless streak and has some solid numbers on the season, but the rest of the Yankees hierarchy had already pitched, so no shakeups just yet. We will see if Peralta can ride this save opportunity into a more consistent late inning role.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Holmes | Hamilton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees called up 23-year-old Deivi Garcia for Wednesday afternoon’s game; he made his first career relief appearance in a three-inning save (the only type you can earn in an A’s game) and was promptly sent back to Scranton with a pat on the back for a job well done.\n\nHierarchy remains: *King | Holmes | Hamilton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – In a tie game against the Rays, the Yankees went with Clay Holmes in the 7th, Wandy Peralta in the 8th, and Michael King in the 9th. This situation is still very fluid, but it’s probably safe to say that on any given night, King has a better chance at a save than Holmes, even if it’s still questionable whether he can pitch on back to back nights with any consistency. We’ll swap them accordingly.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *King | Holmes | Hamilton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 7, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Clay Holmes pitched a scoreless 8th inning with the Yankees down 2-0. After the Yankees rallied for three runs in the top of the 9th, Ian Hamilton pitched a scoreless bottom of the 9th to pick up his first career save. Hamilton and Michael King have both pitched much better than Clay Holmes this season, and with King working to be available more often moving forward, we think Holmes is losing his grip on the closer role. We will throw an asterisk on this for now and see if anybody can establish himself as the primary closer moving forward.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | King | Hamilton.\n\n*=closer-by-committee\n\nMay 3, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – After Monday’s blown save, Clay Holmes received a vote of confidence from manager Aaron Boone prior to Tuesday’s game. However, last night’s save chance went to Michael King, who tossed a scoreless ninth inning to preserve a 4-2 win. Holmes may very well rebound from his struggles, but stashing King may be a prudent move if he’s still available.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\nMay 2, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Clay Holmes was staked to a 2-0 lead, but allowed three runs in the top of the 9th and took the loss. He’s not necessarily on the hot seat yet — it was only his second blown save of the year and the runs were unearned due to a throwing error — but it’s worth noting that he has a 5.29 ERA across 34 innings since the All Star Break in 2022.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Michael King made quick work of the Rangers on Thursday, recording the final seven outs on just 26 pitches to record his first save. King hadn’t pitched since Sunday so he was well-rested. The usage is also consistent with prior work as a high-leverage bulk reliever for the Yankees, so don’t be worried that he’s about to usurp Clay Holmes or something.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\nApril 13, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees are turning to Michael King again in a setup role, along with Wandy Peralta, their only lefthanded reliever. We think King is probably most likely to grab any vulture saves (unless they’re matchup-based), with Ron Marinaccio moving a step behind Peralta.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\nApril 9, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Clay Holmes picked up his second save of the season yesterday and has settled in after allowing two runs in his first outing of the season. Set-up man Jonathan Loaisiga was placed on the IL with elbow inflamation and will not throw for at least a couple weeks. Wandy Peralta pitched a scoreless 8th inning ahead of Clay Holmes last night and will join the hierarchy while Loaisiga is out.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Marinaccio | Peralta.\n\nApril 3, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees – Ron Marinaccio has started the season with 3.1 hitless innings, tallying 6 strikeouts in the process. He picked up his first hold of the season on Sunday, and given his usage thus far, he’s earned a spot on the hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Loaisiga | Marinaccio.\n\nMarch 13, 2023\n\nNew York Yankees — Once an unquestioned strength for the Bronx Bombers, the bullpen situation is a little more murky to start in 2023. Aroldis Chapman is gone, leaving Clay Holmes as the likely candidate to man the ninth inning. He’ll be set up by holdovers Jonathan Loaisiga and Michael King to start off, while Lou Trivino and Tommy Kahnle nurse injuries to start the campaign.\n\nStarting 2023 hierarchy: Holmes | Loaisiga | King.\n\nHolds candidates: Loaisiga, King, Wandy Peralta, Ron Marinaccio, and (eventually) Trivino and Kahnle.\n\nOctober 5, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – Jonathan Loaisiga picked up his second save of the season with a scoreless ninth inning in game one of the Yankees’ doubleheader with the Rangers.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Effross | Loaisiga | Trivino.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nOctober 4, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – Committee leader Scott Effross picked up his fourth save of the season on Monday with a 1-2-3 inning. Miguel Castro got the 8th inning and might also be a late-inning option when matchups are right.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Effross | Loaisiga | Trivino.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nOctober 1, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees got bullpen reinforcements last week, but that strength evaporated when Clay Holmes and Zach Britton were shut down for the remainder of the regular season. The Yankees have locked up the AL East and a bye, but cannot catch the Houston Astros for best record in the league, so they may choose to rest their highest leverage arms down the stretch (but not their bats, as Aaron Judge continues to chase history). Scott Effross is the most likely candidate to close any games for the next few days, while Lou Trivino joins the hierarchy to replace Holmes. The Yankees are also close to activating Wandy Peralta and he could vulture a save in the last week of the season if they are trying to get him in shape for the playoffs.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Effross | Loaisiga | Trivino.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Zack Britton made his second appearance back from Tommy John surgery and again struggled with control. So far this season, Britton has faced eight batters and walked five of them. A brighter spot for the Yankees (aside from, you know, the 61 thing) was Aroldis Chapman hitting 101 and striking out two Blue Jays in a clean ninth. An effective Chapman in any bullpen role would be a huge bonus heading into the playoffs.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Effross | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 28, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees rested their entire hierarchy after they all pitched Monday, which meant Lou Trivino recorded the final four outs of Tuesday’s division-clinching win. It was Trivino’s first save with the Yankees, making him the 12th different Yankee to notch a save this season. That’s one shy of the Rays’ record of 13 relievers with a save, set just last year. With the division now clinched, hopefully Aaron Boone embraces the chaos and challenges for that record!\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Effross | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – With rumors that the Yankees might be willing to DFA Aroldis Chapman, we figure they’re pretty unlikely to put him out there in a high-leverage spot if any other options are available. We’ll push Jonathan Loaisiga up into his place.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Holmes | Effross | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 25, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Scott Effross loaded the bases on a single, hit batter, and walk but was able to keep the Red Sox scoreless and earn his third save of the season. It was Effross’s first appearance since returning from a shoulder strain and he should continue to be in the mix for saves for the rest of the season.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Effross | Chapman.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 23, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees activated Scott Effross and Zack Britton on Thursday. A corresponding move led them to place Wandy Peralta on the IL. So what does the back end look like now? Well, manager Aaron Boone essentially said this week the Yankees will use a closer-by-committee approach, so we’ll keep the committee tag and insert Effross and Aroldis Chapman, who has been up and down of late. Other late-inning options include Jonathan Loaisiga, Lou Trivino and Britton. Holmes earned the extra-inning win Thursday, pitching the game’s final two innings, so he will continue to lead this ‘pen.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Holmes | Effross | Chapman.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 17, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees fell to the Brewers last night when their bullpen couldn’t hold onto a 1 run lead. Jonathan Loaisiga gave up an unearned run in a tie game in the 8th, and although Josh Donaldson tied it with a solo shot in the 9th, Clay Holmes couldn’t protect the lead and took the loss. Into this mess comes Aroldis Chapman, activated after an IL stint due to a tattoo related infection. In addition to Chapman, the back end of the Yankees bullpen is about to get a few more options as Zack Britton is currently on a rehab assignment and trade deadline acquisition Scott Effross is also close to a return. Manager Aaron Boone said that Chapman’s role will be based on his performance, so we will wait to see how he is deployed before making a move, but the Yankees may be getting healthy at just the right time.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Peralta | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 14, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Clay Holmes pitched the ninth with the game tied and then stayed on for the 10th after the Yankees took a 7-4 lead. Holmes hit a better and recorded a strikeout before he was lifted for Wandy Peralta to create a lefty-lefty matchup. Peralta allowed two runs thanks to a single and a wild pitch, but he struck out Rafael Devers to complete his fourth save of the season.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Peralta | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Lucas Luetge picked up his second save of the season in the nightcap of Wednesday’s doubleheader, coming in with a three-run lead in the seventh and finishing the game out after the lead stretched to six.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Peralta | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 30, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees brought Clay Holmes back from the IL yesterday, and the righty immediately got some action, pitching a scoreless 7th inning. As long as he doesn’t show any rust, we expect that he will be eased back into the closer role in the next week or two, so we’re slotting him in at the top with the understanding that he might have another tune-up outing before he’s back to the 9th.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Holmes | Peralta | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 28, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman was placed on the IL with an infection from a recent leg tattoo. Replacing him on the hierarchy for now is Ron Marinaccio, who got the extra innings save chance yesterday but wasn’t able to convert after giving up a pinch hit homer to Stephen Vogt. Marinaccio was on a very nice run before last night having allowed only one earned run since May 22nd. Clay Holmes could return on Monday and will likely get the closer’s job back since nobody else was able to establish themselves while he was out.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Peralta | Loaisiga | Marinaccio.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 26, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Clay Holmes says he’s feeling good and expects to be activated from the injured list on Monday. He’ll probably step right back into the closer’s role.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Peralta | Loaisiga | Chapman.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 25, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Zack Britton made his first rehab appearance ahead of a planned mid-September return to the big leagues. Britton retired both hitters he faced.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Peralta | Loaisiga | Chapman.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 24, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees continued to do everything they can to avoid Aroldis Chapman pitching in a high-leverage spot, trying to get 3+ innings out of Clarke Schmidt to close out Tuesday’s tilt against the Mets. Schmidt ran into trouble in the ninth, however, which forced Aaron Boone to call upon Wandy Peralta for a bases-loaded, one-out save, which he converted. After the game, Boone confirmed he isn’t quite ready to use Chapman in high-leverage spots. Boone may have no choice based on the options he has available, but we’re sliding Chapman down a few spots in our hierarchy until the Yankees regain confidence in the lefty.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Peralta | Loaisiga | Chapman.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 23, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – A Scott Effross IL stint, combined with the Yankees continued reluctance to give the full time job back to Aroldis Chapman, meant that Jonathan Loaisiga was asked to get the final four outs of Monday’s Subway Series opener. Loaisiga responded by retiring all four hitters he faced, becoming the 11th Yankee to record a save this season. Yankees gonna… Rays?\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Chapman | Peralta | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 18, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — A walk-off grand slam is a wonderful thing, but the Yankees needed it because of more control issues by Aroldis Chapman — two walks preceding a seeing-eye double. Chapman has the obvious pedigree to close, but Aaron Boone has shown once already this year that he’s not afraid to swap him out for an unheralded arm if necessary. Boone says he’ll play matchups, but Chapman is likely only one more wild outing away from another demotion.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Chapman | Effross | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 17, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – As expected, Clay Holmes has been placed on the IL with a back strain. Aroldis Chapman will close in his place, and if he keeps up this current run of good form, may not give the job back.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Effross | Peralta.\n\nAugust 17, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees lost last night, but the real news was that Clay Holmes is dealing with a back injury and may need an IL stint. While the move isn’t official yet, everyone from Aaron Boone to Clay Holmes himself seem to treat it as inevitable. We will alert if the Yankees make a move, but it may be time to grab Aroldis Chapman, who has continued to look like his old self in recent weeks.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Holmes | Chapman | Effross.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 14, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – Aroldis Chapman pitched a perfect 8th inning in a tie game last night and picked up the win after the Yankees took the lead in the top of the 9th. Scott Effross gave up a couple hits in the 9th but was able to hold the Red Sox scoreless for his first save as a Yankee. Clay Holmes got the day off and Aaron Boone said they will be working with him to get him right. Boone said that he still plans on using Holmes in the 9th inning on some nights, but that’s not the most glowing endorsement for a closer. We think this is a committee for now and Aroldis Chapman could take the job back if he continues his dominant stretch.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Holmes | Chapman | Effross.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 13, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – The entire Yankees team has struggled as of late, but maybe nobody more than Clay Holmes. Holmes was brought in to protect a 2 run lead in the 9th yesterday. He got 1 quick out before walking the next two batters and giving up the tying single before getting pulled for Wandy Peralta. The Yankees would go on to lose in extra innings. Holmes has now given up runs in 4 of his last 5 appearances, including 3 blown saves. Command seems to be the source of his trouble, as he has issued the same number of walks in his last 10 appearances as he has for the rest of the season (39 apps). Meanwhile, Aroldis Chapman pitched a clean 8th ahead of Holmes, and now has 8 straight scoreless appearances. It’s a bit too early to make a change here, but Holmes is certainly on a hot seat now, and with Chapman and Peralta continuing to pitch well, Holmes may not have many chances left.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | Peralta | Chapman.\n\nAugust 7, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – Aroldis Chapman pitched a scoreless 8th inning in a tight game with the Yankees down by one. Chapman now has five straight scoreless appearances and has only allowed one hit and one walk over those five innings. Chapman was also in line to get the save opportunity on Friday night and that’s enough to bring him back onto the hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Peralta | Chapman.\n\nAugust 6, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – With 3-4-5 due up in the 8th inning, the Yankees went to Clay Holmes to protect a one-run lead against the Cardinals, but the righty gave up an infield hit and then a walk before Paul DeJong laced a 2-out, 2-run double which ultimately was the difference in the game. Holmes has been a revelation this season, but he’s now given up 9 ERs (as well as 8 BBs and 3 HBPs) in his past 7.1 innings. He was a little unlucky last night, but we’ll keep an eye on this to see if he’s able to shake this recent stretch of wildness.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | Peralta | Effross.\n\nAugust 3, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees acquired A’s closer Lou Trivino and Cubs’ setup man Scott Effross at the deadline. Both additions made their Yankee debuts on Tuesday; we’ll slot Effross into the hierarchy for now and see if he can continue his strong rookie campaign.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Peralta | Effross.\n\nJuly 31, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – For the second straight appearance, Clarke Schmidt threw the final three innings of a lopsided Yankee’s victory to earn the save. Schmidt is mostly a multi-inning reliever so we aren’t ready to move him to the hierarchy yet.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | Peralta | Luetge.\n\nJuly 25, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – Clarke Schmidt threw the final three innings of a 6-0 Yankee victory on Sunday afternoon to earn his first career save. He’s having a fine year, but is almost always used across several innings, meaning he’s likely to be an inconsistent source of holds, even with the injury to Michael King.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | Peralta | Luetge.\n\nJuly 23, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees suffered a major blow when Michael King left last night’s game after throwing a pitch in the 8th inning. The early diagnosis is a fractured elbow which will end his season. King had been excellent, leading the team in holds and the Yankees will certainly be active at the trade deadline trying to find someone to replace those innings. The Yankees do have some hope that Zack Britton might be able to return from Tommy John surgery later this year, but until reinforcements arrive, expect Lucas Luetge to see an increased role. Luetge has been a true fireman this year, sometimes getting a single batter and sometimes working multiple innings (like last night), but he has been effective.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Peralta | Luetge.\n\nJuly 17, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Ryan Weber, who might be the best golfer on the Yankees and was formerly the number three starter for the Red Sox in 2020, pitched three scoreless innings to finish off a Yankees’ 14-1 victory over the Red Sox and record his first career save.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\nJuly 15, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Jonathan Loaisiga returned to action Thursday after a long layoff and did not look sharp, allowing three runs on four hits in the eighth inning to balloon his ERA to 8.31. It does not appear he’s ready for primetime work yet and won’t crack this hierarchy for the time being.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\nJuly 13, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — After a rare poor outing by Clay Holmes in last night’s ninth inning, the Yankees turned to Wandy Peralta to try and complete a Houdini and preserve a 3-2 win. Peralta came within a strike of doing so, but he gave up a two-run single that put the Reds ahead, 4-3. It is clear, however, that Peralta is ahead of Aroldis Chapman right now in this hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | King | Peralta.\n\nJuly 9, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — In a game that got out of hand quickly, and featured Joey Gallo try for an inside the park home run (or 4 base error if you don’t believe losing a ball in the lights is a good excuse), the Yankees turned the last 3.1 innings over to Lucas Luetge. Luetge was masterful, giving up a hit and a walk while striking out 6 on the way to his first save on the year. The former rule 5 draftee debuted in 2012, but spent almost 6 years pitching in the minors before catching on and finally sticking with the Yankees last year. Luetge is having a solid season in long relief and as a lefty matchup specialist, but doesn’t usually factor into the late innings.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | King | Chapman.\n\nJuly 3, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman made his first appearance since returning from the IL and it did not go well. Chapman walked all three batters he faced and only one of the eight fastballs he threw was a strike. It’s hard to imagine the Yankees using Chapman in a meaningful spot after yesterday’s outing so we will drop him on the hierarchy until he proves he can throw strikes.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | King | Chapman.\n\nJuly 2, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — While last night’s contest against the Guardians was rained out, Aroldis Chapman was activated yesterday. He won’t return to closing just yet, as Clay Holmes has been nearly perfect on the year, but expect Chapman to be in the late inning mix. Meanwhile, Miguel Castro was placed on the paternity list\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | Chapman | King.\n\nJuly 2, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — While last night’s contest against the Guardians was rained out, Aroldis Chapman was activated yesterday. He won’t return to closing just yet, as Clay Holmes has been nearly perfect on the year, but expect Chapman to be in the late inning mix. Meanwhile, Miguel Castro was placed on the paternity list\n\nUpdated Hierarchy: Holmes | Chapman | King.\n\nJune 16, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Not satisfied to be 30 games over .500 with a closer on a 30-inning scoreless streak, Aaron Boone is threatening Yankee fans with the promise that Aroldis Chapman will “be closing some games” after he returns from Achilles tendinitis. The more relevant Greek myth here might be Icarus.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Castro.\n\nJune 13, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – Making his third appearance of the season, Manny Banuelos pitched the final three innings of a Yankees blowout win, earning his first save.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Castro.\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman is nearing a return from tendinitis — expected to throw off a mound this Saturday — but Aaron Boone refused to commit to his immediate return to the ninth, noting only that Chapman will be a “big-time back-end reliever.” It looks like Holmes, who is still working on a 26-inning scoreless streak, will keep his job at least as long as he remains perfect.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Castro.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Wandy Peralta earned a nontraditional save in Game 1 of Thursday’s doubleheader against the Angels, coming into the game in the eighth inning with a five-run lead, but the bases were loaded at the time. He induced a flyout and then pitched a clean ninth for his first save. Clay Holmes picked up the save in the nightcap.\n\nHierarchy remains: Holmes | King | Castro.\n\nMay 26, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees’ season-opening hierarchy has been reunited, but this time on the injured list. Jonathan Loaisiga (right shoulder discomfort) joined Aroldis Chapman and Chad Green on the shelf Wednesday, leaving Miguel Castro and Wandy Peralta as the team’s top seventh-inning options. Rookie Ron Marinaccio pitched two scoreless innings with three strikeouts last night and could also be in line for some holds.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | King | Castro.\n\nMay 25, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman was placed on the IL on Tuesday with an achilles injury. Clay Holmes should be the primary option to close while Chapman is out, but Michael King could also be in the mix.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Holmes | King | Loaisiga.\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman’s recent absence now has an explanation – the Yankees’ closer has been dealing with an achilles issue. An IL stint may be warranted; we’ll monitor and alert as appropriate. Having also just lost Chad Green for the year to Tommy John surgery, a Chapman injury would leave Clay Holmes and Michael King as the likely contenders for saves on most nights.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Holmes | King.\n\nMay 22, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees turned the ball over to Clay Holmes to get the last out of the 8th inning, and after throwing just 2 pitches there he stuck around for the 9th with a 2 run lead. He pitched a clean 9th inning for his 4th save on the year, but it is noteworthy that Aroldis Chapman was well rested, having last pitched on Tuesday. The Yankees do have a doubleheader today, so it is possible that they did not want to waste Holmes getting warmed up for just a 2 pitch, 1 out appearance. However, Holmes has been electric this year, only giving up 1 run, and that was on opening day. Meanwhile Chapman has given up a run in his last 4 appearances, but has yet to blow a save on the year. So while Holmes has closed the gap a bit, Chapman is still the closer in New York, but if his struggles start costing the Yankees games they may have an easy plan B.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Holmes | King.\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — You weren’t surprised to see Clay Holmes grab his third save of the young season last night while Aroldis Chapman rested. You saw it coming. You planned for it. You reveled in it. Why? Because you read Wednesday’s Vulture Save Watch.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Holmes | King.\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – We’d tabbed Clay Holmes as the likeliest Yankee for a vulture save, and while he was indeed needed for some key outs — closing the door in the 7th and pitching a scoreless 8th — it was Chad Green who got the call in the 9th inning. Green has been decent, but not great, thus far, so we’ll keep the hierarchy as is for the time being.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Holmes | King.\n\nMay 2, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees – Michael King’s phenomenal season continued, as the righty on Sunday finished the 7th and then pitched a clean 8th inning ahead of Aroldis Chapman. It was his third hold on the season to go along with 22 Ks in 14.2 innings, and while he’s likely most valuable pitching multiple innings (rather than as a more strict set-up man), we can’t keep him out of the hierarchy any longer, even if Jonathan Loaisiga might be more likely to get a save on a night that Chapman is off.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Holmes | King.\n\nApril 28, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Bullpen hierarchies change fast, and Aaron Boone has quickly found that his most trusted late-inning relievers ahead of Aroldis Chapman are 29-year-old sinkerballer Clay Holmes and crafty long man Michael King. Boone’s turn to Holmes last night for a vulture save with Chapman resting means a promotion to first in line.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Holmes | Loaisiga.\n\nApril 27, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Clay Holmes continued his strong season on Tuesday with a seventh-inning hold that lowered his ERA to 1.04. Chad Green has allowed two runs on three hits in each of his last two outings, including this past Saturday.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Loaisiga | Holmes.\n\nApril 17, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Clay Holmes recorded the last four outs in a 5-2 victory to pick up his first career save. The Yankees’ bullpen had been busy recently as Aroldis Chapman and Jonathan Loaisiga had both pitched in three of the last four games and Chad Green had pitched in two of the last three. That left Michael King and Clay Holmes to finish off yesterday’s win.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nApril 16, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman needed a rest both due to workload and also to get some distance from a disaster outing against the Blue Jays on Thursday. Unfortunately, he got pressed into service in the 11th inning after Clarke Schmidt loaded the bases loaded with 1 out. The historically correct play is to issue an intentional walk with the bases loaded, which the Angels proved again last night. Chapman decided take the brave man’s route of pitching to the Orioles, and after a quick strikeout he made the mistake of unintentionally walking Ramon Urias to end the game. Aaron Boone defended the decision to go to Chapman despite his recent command struggles. It is difficult to blame any pitcher for failing to deliver a near-Houdini, but the bright lights of New York can be unforgiving and it wouldn’t be the first time Chapman’s hold on the closers role seemed to be slipping. He’s always bounced back from these rough stretches before, but it may be time to get out the Loaisiga handcuff if you’re invested in Chapman.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nApril 15, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — Every closer is due for a poor outing, and maybe Aroldis Chapman got his clunker out of the way early. The flame-throwing veteran loaded the bases on three walks with no outs on Thursday against the Blue Jays and was pulled for Michael King, who danced around the trouble on just five pitches (all strikes) and struck out one to earn his first save. Chad Green already pitched earlier in the contest and Jonathan Loaisiga, who pitched on Tuesday and Wednesday, was likely unavailable. After the game, Chapman said he agreed with manager Aaron Boone’s decision to yank him. We’ll continue to monitor Chapman’s control in the early going.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nMarch 23, 2022\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees have one of the more stable bullpens in baseball, with Aroldis Chapman set to once again close in the Bronx. Jonathan Loaisiga and Chad Green will set up Chapman, as Zack Britton isn’t expected to be back from Tommy John surgery until later this year, if at all.\n\nStarting 2022 hierarchy: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nHolds candidates: Loaisiga, Green.\n\nSeptember 30, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Jonathan Loaisiga returned from the injured list and immediately pitched a perfect seventh in a tied game. That’s enough to get him back on the Yankees’ hierarchy for the remainder of the season.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Green | Loaisiga.\n\nSeptember 29, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Jonathan Loaisiga is expected to be activated from the IL today. He should immediately see high-leverage chances as the Yankees look to clinch home field advantage for the AL Wild Card game.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Green | Peralta.\n\nSeptember 17, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Jonathan Loaisiga will begin a throwing program Friday as he hopes to return to the Yankees bullpen before the season ends.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Green | Peralta.\n\nSeptember 16, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman had a dominant outing on Wednesday and, just as importantly, Chad Green keeps blowing leads. The Yankees will ride with Chapman the rest of the way, for good or ill.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Green | Peralta.\n\nSeptember 9, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman was booed off the mound on Wednesday after a low-leverage outing that included a home run, two walks, and a wild pitch. Chapman started the season with no earned runs in 18 appearances and he had a 0.39 ERA (1 ER, 23 IP) going into the game on June 10. Over the last three months, however, he boasts a 7.23 ERA, three blown saves, 24 walks, and seven homers allowed. You can’t trust him and neither should Aaron Boone. Chad Green seems likeliest to get the next save chance, and we’re sticking an asterisk back on this bullpen.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Chapman | Green | Peralta.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 6, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees placed Jonathan Loaisiga on the IL on Sunday with a strained rotator cuff and are hopeful that he’ll only miss a couple weeks.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Green | Peralta.\n\nAugust 25, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees – Tasked with protecting a two-run lead in the ninth inning against Atlanta, Aroldis Chapman retired two of the first two hitters he faced. Two walks and an infield single derailed his inning, however, and Wandy Peralta won a fierce battle with Freddie Freeman to leave the bases loaded and earn the save. We’ll keep an eye on how much of a leash Aaron Boone gives Chapman going forward and whether Peralta, Jonathan Loaisiga or Chad Green become Boone’s preferred ninth-inning options. Zack Britton’s name isn’t on that list, as surgery is now a possibility after he landed on the IL with an elbow strain.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nAugust 24, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees – Zack Britton was placed on the IL with a left elbow sprain. The injury appears minor, but there isn’t a timetable for his return yet.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nAugust 20, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman had a rough outing Wednesday, so manager Aaron Boone decided to give his closer the day off and turned to Chad Green, who allowed a run but managed to earn his sixth save. Zack Britton pitched the eighth inning and Jonathan Loaisiga was rested again after he tossed two innings on Tuesday.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nAugust 19, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman returned from his injury absence and Aaron Boone announced that he would immediately resume his role as New York’s closer. With a four-run lead, Chapman gave up a solo home run — his seventh on the year, tying his career high — then was pulled for Lucas Luetge after he put two more guys on base. Luetge got a single out to earn his first save of the season, and also his first since August 21, 2012. (Covered, naturally, by Closer Monkey.) Chapman is still looking to recapture his command, but (for now at least) he’ll be doing so in the ninth inning.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nAugust 18, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees swept a doubleheader against the Red Sox on Tuesday, allowing both Jonathan Loaisiga and Chad Green to collect a save. Loaisiga loaded the bases with nobody out in the first game of the day but recorded a Houdini to end the game. Green closed out a 2-0 win in game two to complete the sweep.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Loaisiga | Green | Britton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 17, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees had a much-needed strong showing from their bullpen yesterday, with Chad Green closing out a 2-1 victory for his fourth save. We’ll watch to see if Green gets the next chance with an eye on moving him ahead of Jonathan Loaisiga if he does.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Loaisiga | Green | Britton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 16, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees – Wandy Peralta picked up his second save in a week, cleaning up the mess after Lucas Luetge got in trouble in the 9th. He’s still behind several others on the depth chart, but if he keeps finding his way into these spots, we’ll make a place for him on the hierarchy.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Loaisiga | Green | Britton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 15, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Zack Britton told manager Aaron Boone to remove him as closer and that meant that Chad Green got the call in the 9th inning yesterday with the Yankees up one. Unfortunately for Yankees fans and fantasy owners, he couldn’t get the job done. After the Yankees took the lead again in the top of the 10th, out trotted Zack Britton from the bullpen to try and record the save. However, he clearly wasn’t kidding about wanting to be removed from the closer role and after allowing a single in between a pair of walks, he was pulled for Albert Abreu. Abreu retired the two batters he faced and picked up his first career save. Jonathan Loaisiga and Chad Green should split save chances with Britton no longer an option and we will move Loaisiga to the top of the committee after Green blew the save yesterday.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Loaisiga | Green | Britton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 13, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees let Liam Hendriks off the hook at the Field of Dreams, giving him the cheapest win imaginable when Tim Anderson smashed a walk-off homer that sent the ball disappearing into the corn fields and gave Zack Britton another blown save. The Yankees might not give Britton the next shot.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Britton | Loaisiga | Green.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 12, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — For the third time since Aroldis Chapman’s injury, Zack Britton got the ninth inning for the Yankees, protecting a three-run lead for his first save of the season. The Yankees will likely continue to treat this as a committee, but it looks like the experienced Britton will get the bulk of the opportunities.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Britton | Loaisiga | Green.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 10, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees – The Yankees bullpen tied an MLB record on Monday by blowing a save four different times before Wandy Peralta finally closed the door in the 11th. Perhaps even more amazingly, they did so in four consecutive innings (7th through 10th), as Jonathan Loaisiga, Chad Green, Zack Britton, and Clay Holmes all allowed the Royals to tie it after the Yankees had taken the lead in the top half. Not much to report on the fantasy front, here, though we’ll continue to see if anyone emerges as the clear leader for the Yankees with Aroldis Chapman out.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Loaisiga | Green | Britton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 8, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — As we alerted you yesterday, Aroldis Chapman was placed on the IL with elbow inflammation. The MRI did not reveal any structural damage and the Yankees are hopeful he can return from the IL when eligible. Jonathan Loaisiga picked up the save yesterday and we think he will lead a committee that includes Chad Green and Zack Britton while Chapman is out.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Loaisiga | Green | Britton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 7, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees placed Aroldis Chapman on the IL. Expect a committee of Jonathan Loaisiga, Chad Green and Zack Britton to handle the late innings while Chapman is out, with Loaisiga as the leader.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Loaisiga | Green | Britton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 1, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees gave Aroldis Chapman the day off yesterday as the Vulture Save Watch predicted, but the save went to Jonathan Loaisiga instead of Chad Green. Loaisiga had one blow-up outing recently where he gave up four runs, but other than that he has been great and we will slide him up first in line behind Chapman after yesterday’s save.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Loaisiga | Green.\n\nJuly 25, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Aroldis Chapman worked around a walk and a two-out double to pitch a scoreless inning and record his 18th save of the season. After a brutal three game stretch where Chapman allowed nine earned runs, he is starting to pitch better and has only allowed one earned run over his last six appearances. He has also recorded the last two saves for the Yankees after Chad Green picked up the save on July 7th.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Green | Loaisiga.\n\nJuly 24, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees activated Jonathan Loaisiga from the IL yesterday, although he did not pitch in a four-run loss. Zack Britton earned a couple holds last week, but they came in some pretty rough outings, and we see Loaisiga unseating him for now.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Chapman | Green | Loaisiga.\n\nJuly 22, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — Zack Britton’s return now comprises three outings, eight baserunners, and four earned runs, with no clean innings in the bunch. With Aroldis Chapman’s finger continuing to give him trouble, the Yankees’ bullpen is unusually unreliable lately.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Green | Britton.\n\nJuly 21, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — It had been a month since Aroldis Chapman had earned a save, but despite allowing a solo homer to Andrew McCutchen, the struggling reliever stuck out Bryce Harper, Rhys Hoskins and Didi Gregorius to convert his first save opportunity since that disastrous outing against the Mets on July 4. Not only did Chapman get the save, but his velocity was great, particularly in the final two at-bats of the night. In other news, Jonathan Loaisiga is back with the team and could return this weekend while Darren O’Day will have season-ending surgery.\n\nHierarchy remains: Chapman | Green | Britton.\n\nJuly 17, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — There isn’t much good news coming out of the Yankees these days, but one bright spot is the return of Zack Britton from the IL. The Yankees have seen the season start to slip away, and the bullpen struggles have been a large part of it. Aroldis Chapman needed the All-Star break more than anyone, having given up 9 runs in the 4 appearances leading up to it. Meanwhile, Chad Green took the loss in one of the more spectacular blown saves of the year. Jonathan Loaisiga, who was the Yankees’ best reliever recently, is expected to miss 10 days due to COVID so he won’t be back until next week. We will slide Britton into his hierarchy spot and see how the Yankees bullpen plays out over the next couple of weeks.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Chapman | Green | Britton.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 11, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — The Yankees have placed Jonathan Loaisiga on the COVID IL, but he may not be out very long as manager Aaron Boone said Loaisiga was feeling good. The Yankees did not need their bullpen at all yesterday as Gerrit Cole pitched a complete game but Aroldis Chapman was warming in the bullpen for the save chance if the Yankees decided to pull Cole.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Chapman | Green | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 8, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — For years, a one-run lead in the ninth inning has produced a Pavlovian response in Yankees fans: Aroldis Chapman. But a month of increasingly harsh negative reinforcement has flipped the script, leaving them newly desperate to not see their $17.2 million closer in a tight spot (examples one, two, and three). Aaron Boone, a veteran of the Skinner box of the New York media, still wants it both ways, nodding to Chad Green’s recent ascendance while affirming Chapman as the long-term answer. We believe he’ll return to Chapman full-time after the All-Star break, but the ultimate result of this experiment is very much up in the air. But things could always be worse.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Chapman | Green | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 5, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees – Aroldis Chapman had another ugly outing, consisting of a leadoff homer to tie the game, followed by a walk and a hit batsman, both of whom eventually scored. But it wasn’t just that he was bad again. It was that the two relievers who are ostensibly competing with him for save opps were both stellar. Chad Green picked up a 1-out hold in game one of Sunday’s doubleheader, then came back and threw 3 perfect innings (including an immaculate one in the 7th) to close out the nightcap. Meanwhile, Jonathan Loaisiga contributed 2.1 scoreless innings of his own — though he did allow one inherited runner to score — in the first game. With Aaron Boone’s postgame comments about continuing “to talk through” the late game issues, combined with an earlier remark about getting his usually-otherworldly closer some lower-leverage work, we’re slapping a committee tag here and will wait to see how the next few games go.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Chapman | Green | Loaisiga.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\nNew York Yankees — It’s all about roster construction.
