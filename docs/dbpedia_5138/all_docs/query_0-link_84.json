The New York Yankees compete in the American League (AL) East division of Major League Baseball (MLB) and are probably the most successful franchise in the history of professional baseball. Nicknamed the \"The Bronx Bombers\" and \"The Bronx Zoo\" as they based in the New York City borough of the Bronx, their successes have been legendary having 27 World Series titles (the most of any team), 40 American League pennants, and 18 Eastern Division titles to date. Their successes have also earned them other nicknames such as \"The Evil Empire\" and even \"Murderer's Row\" by their detractors, but nobody can honestly not also recognize their successes.\n\nThe Yankees were born out of the early infighting between the National and American baseball leagues in the early 20th century first in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1901 as the Baltimore Orioles (no relationship to the current Orioles). They played their home games in Oriole Park (1901-1902). Two years later in 1903 they moved to New York, first briefly named the New York Americans, then quickly renamed the New York Highlanders. The New York Mets of the National League were also located in New York City, so the Highlanders were referred to as the \"Invaders\" in the New York Evening Journal. Soon however the New York Press coined them unofficially with another name, the Yankees, or Yanks, because it was easier to fit in headlines. Their home games were first played in Hilltop Park (American League Park) between 1903 and 1912, then moved to the Polo Grounds, also named Brush Stadium, (1913-1922) then to Shea Stadium (1974-1975), the old Yankee Stadium (1923-1973, 1976-2008), and finally to the current Yankee Stadium (2009-present). The Yankees team colors are midnight navy blue, gray, and white.\n\nIt should be noted that in the early years baseball teams used pennants rather than flags (hence the practice of calling championships winning the pennant) and there were a host of unofficial manufacturer's variants of these and later fan flags marketed for their fans. They included flags, banners, and pennants too numerous to all be shown here.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nCommemorative flags\n\nNew York Yankees World Series Flag\n\nimage from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nIn 2009 the Yankees won their 27th World Series title which are the most won by any Major League baseball team in baseball history. They were the \"World Champions\" in 1923, 1927, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1943, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1951. 1952, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1977, 1978, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009, an amazing accomplishment that this commemorative flag celebrates.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nDerek Jeter Flag 2017\n\nManufacturer's Variant\n\nimage from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nAs a shortstop, Derek Jeter spent his entire 20-year MLB playing career with the New York Yankees. A five-time World Series champion, Jeter is regarded as one of the primary contributors to the Yankees' success of the late 1990s and early 2000s for his hitting, base running, fielding, and leadership. In 2017, the Yankees retired his uniform number 2.\n\nAn interesting fact: When the Yankees declared July 4, 1939, to be remembered as \"Lou Gehrig Day\" and they retired his number 4, it was the first time the practice began and the first retired number ever in baseball history. (But sadly no flag was issued then)\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nFan flags\n\nNew York Yankees Logo Flags (with white fields)\n\nManufacturer's Variants\n\nimages from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nThese Yankees fan flags use the team logo on white backgrounds or fields.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nNew York Yankees Logo Flag (multiple logos)\n\nManufacturer's Variant\n\nimage from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nThis Yankees fan flag presents us with both an original design treatment and unusual ratio.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nNew York Yankees Flags (with script text)\n\nManufacturer's Variants\n\nimage from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nTwo examples of Yankees fan flags in team colors and using white script text on midnight navy blue fields.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nNew York Yankees (Tricolor design)\n\nimage from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nThis horizontal tricolor Yankees fan flag places pinstripes in the upper and lower bands and vertical stripes on the center midnight navy blue band. The Yankees logo is centered defacing all three horizontal bands.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nNew York Yankees Flag\n\nimage from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nYet another Yankees fan flag design using text, cap emblem, and midnight navy blue, gray, and white.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nThe Yankees \"Stars and Stripes\" Fan Flags\n\nManufacturer's Variants\n\nimages from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nThese type flags have been reproduced in team colors for all the MLB baseball teams (also for football and basketball teams in the United States) and displayed by their enthusiastic fans. The flags come in several manufacturer's variants using different logos in the cantons, some with stars, some not, and with different stripes at their fly end.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nNew York Yankees Flags (pin stripe)\n\nManufacturer's Variants\n\nimages from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nThese two New York flags use some unusual pin striping effects.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nNew York Yankees Flag (vertical stripes)\n\nManufacturer's Variants\n\nimages from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nThese manufacturer's variants use the current Yankees logo and different vertical stripes.\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nNew York Yankees \"Divided Loyalty\" Flag\n\nimages from Pete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nThis flags are for those families with divided loyalties between different teams. In this case, the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, one of the oldest rivalries in baseball. It began when Pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth was traded to New York from Boston in 1920. That trade haunted the Red Sox for the next 86 years and came to be called the \"Curse of the Bambino\" (Babe Ruth's nickname). The 86 years between World Series championships for the Red Sox was one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history (1919-2014). But hey, baseball fans aren't superstitious are they?\n\nPete Loeser, 10 April 2019\n\nNew York Yankees Yacht Flags and Pennants\n\nimages from Pete Loeser, 17 May 2019\n\nFor those baseball fans who own boats and want to display their team loyalty afloat, these flags are available for them. The flags take the form of either a broad pennant or a square boat flag with either a cap or team logo near the hoist. Each uses the individual team's colors in their designs.\n\nNote: Because of the small size of these nautical broad pennants. usually about a foot tall (approximately 30.48 centimeters), they have also gained popularity as \"golf cart\" flags. It should also be noted that a broad pennant, or any other flag shape, is only called a \"burgee\" if it designates an organized boating club.\n\nPete Loeser, 17 May 2019"
