        "text": "Even though the New York Yankees season is already over in terms of not making the post-season, there are some reasons to smile for the fans. Youngster Anthony Volpe made a massive impact as a shortstop and is giving off some interesting vibes that are getting him wild comparisons. It's still far too soon to start talking about the shortstop elephant in the room but if he remains consistent, Volpe can definitely leave a mark. A perfect first step was already given by him on Thursday, when the New York Yankees played against the Detroit Tigers. As he faced closer Alex Lange, Volpe got a homer that meants his 20th of a brilliant rookie season. What mattered more to Volpe is that he managed to tie the game in the 9th inning and gave the Yankees a lifeline.\n\nVolpe reaches unique Yankees record\n\nDespite the poor results this season for the Yankees, the fans are finally starting to enjoy the season with Anthony Volpe's performances and Aaron Judge's return. With his impressive 21 stolen bases this season, Anthony Volpe becomes the first rookie Yankee to become part of the prestigious 20/20 club. Although the Tigers did win the game 4-3 in the 10th inning, what remains is Volpe's impressive record and a bright-looking future ahead of him. From this moment forward, Anthony Volpe should be considered for all games as long as he remains healthy. We han't seen a Yankees shortstop this talented since 'you-know-who' retired."
