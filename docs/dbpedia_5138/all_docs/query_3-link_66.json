        "text": "The Los Angeles Angels (50-64) and New York Yankees (68-47) wrap up a 3-game set at Yankee Stadium Thursday. First pitch is scheduled for 7:05 p.m. ET (MLB Network). Let’s analyze BetMGM Sportsbook’s lines around the Angels vs. Yankees odds and make our expert MLB picks and predictions for the best bets.\n\nSeason series: Yankees lead 3-2\n\nAfter losing 5-2 in Game 1 of Wednesday’s doubleheader, the Angels won the nightcap 8-2 as +220 underdogs as the Over (9) hit. SS Zach Neto (3 for 5, career-high 6 RBIs) belted his 1st career grand slam, part of a 6-run 2nd inning for L.A.\n\nYankees 3B DJ LeMahieu singled in a run in the 2nd inning, and 2B Gleyber Torres hit a sacrifice fly in the 4th for New York’s final run. The Yankees are 8-2 over their last 10 games.\n\nAngels at Yankees projected starters\n\nLHP Tyler Anderson vs. LHP Nestor Cortes\n\nAnderson (8-10, 3.05 ERA) makes his 23rd start. He has a 1.17 WHIP, 3.4 BB/9 and 6.8 K/9 in 135 2/3 IP.\n\nLast start: Loss, 5 IP, 3 ER, 8 H, 2 BB, 3 K in 5-1 home defeat vs. New York Mets Friday\n\n2024 road stats: 5-3, 1.84 ERA (58 2/3 IP, 12 ER), 0.97 WHIP, 7.2 K/9 in 9 starts\n\n2024 vs. Yankees: 0-1, 1.80 ERA (5 IP, 1 ER), 4 H, 6 BB, 4 K in 1 start, a 2-1 home loss May 29\n\nCareer vs. Yankees: 0-1, 2.70 ERA (10 IP, 3 ER), 1.70 WHIP, 7.2 K/9 in 2 starts\n\nCortes (5-9, 4.16 ERA) makes his 24th start. He has a 1.20 WHIP, 1.9 BB/9 and 8.5 K/9 in 129 2/3 IP.\n\nLast start: Win, 5 1/3 IP, 3 ER, 3 H, 2 BB, 6 K in 6-5 victory at Philadelphia Phillies July 31\n\n2024 home stats: 4-4, 2.48 ERA (69 IP, 19 ER), 0.88 WHIP, 8.6 K/9 in 11 starts\n\n2024 vs. Angels: 0-0, 3.38 ERA (5 1/3 IP, 2 ER), 5 H, 0 BB, 4 K in 1 start, a 4-3 road loss May 28\n\nCareer vs. Angels: 2-0, 3.24 ERA (25 IP, 9 ER), 1.00 WHIP, 9.0 K/9 in 7 appearances (3 starts)\n\nWho’s going yard?

Lines last updated at 11:45 a.m. ET.\n\nMoneyline (ML): Angels +200 (bet $100 to win $200) | Yankees -250 (bet $250 to win $100)\n\nRun line (RL)/Against the spread (ATS): Angels +1.5 (+100) | Yankees -1.5 (-120)\n\nOver/Under (O/U): 8.5 (O: -105 | U: -115)\n\nAngels at Yankees picks and predictions\n\nPrediction\n\nYankees 5, Angels 4\n\nMoneyline\n\nIt’s hard to imagine the Yankees (-250), who are tied with the Baltimore Orioles for the lead in the AL East, losing a series in the Bronx against the the 2nd-worst team in the AL West. However, it’s a losing proposition long term to bet into lines with this much vig.\n\nPASS. Bet the run line and/or total instead.\n\nRun line/Against the spread\n\nSince the All-Star break, just 4 of the Yankees’ 11 home games have resulted in multi-run wins for New York. Even worse, the last time the Yankees won a Cortes start by 2 or more runs was June 18 (7 straight starts failing to cover -1.5).\n\nWhile expecting the Angels to win straight up is a tough ask, taking them +1.5 at even money is better than laying -120 with the Yankees. New York has won 8 of 10 overall, but has struggled to blow teams out at home after the break, especially when Cortes starts.\n\nBET ANGELS +1.5 (+100).\n\nOver/Under\n\nCortes has allowed 3 ER or more — and been pulled in the 6th inning or earlier — in 4 straight starts.\n\nAnderson has given up 3-plus ER in 3 of his last 4 starts, and 3 of those outings were against the Oakland A’s and Seattle Mariners, 2 bottom-5 offenses in the AL. While Anderson hasn’t been horrible recently, he should struggle against the AL’s No. 1 offense (5.13 runs per game), especially since the Yankees are coming off a loss.\n\nBET OVER 8.5 (-115).\n\nPlay our free daily Pick’em Challenge and win!
