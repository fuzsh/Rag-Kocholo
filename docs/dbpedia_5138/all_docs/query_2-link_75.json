        "text": "The Baltimore Orioles are just a half-game back of the New York Yankees for first place in the American League East. They currently have a 67-47 record and lead the Wild Card race.\n\nOn Wednesday, the team added a new piece to the mix, signing a slugger that was recently released by the Yankees. Jon Heyman of the New York Post was the first to report the news.\n\n\"JD Davis is signing with the Orioles,\" Heyman wrote on Twitter.\n\nDavis has bounced around this season. He began the year with the San Francisco Giants but never played in a game with them this season before they designated him for assignment.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics picked him up but ultimately got rid of him, only for the Yankees to grab him. Davis has joined his third organization since being let go by San Francisco before the season.\n\nNot surprisingly, it's been a tough year for Davis. He has appeared in just 46 games this season and is hitting .218 with only four home runs and six RBI. He also has an uninspiring .631 OPS.\n\nWhen he's right, he can be a power threat at the plate. He went deep 18 times last season for the Giants while hitting .248, driving in 69 runs, and posting an OPS of .738.\n\nThe 31-year-old will certainly hope to finally find his footing with the Orioles as the 2024 regular season nears its conclusion."
