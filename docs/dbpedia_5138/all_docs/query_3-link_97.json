        "text": "After starting their 2024 season red hot on the road, the New York Yankees will finally be back in the Bronx on Friday, where they are slated to face off against the Toronto Blue Jays in their home opener.\n\nLike most Major League Baseball stadiums these days, Yankee Stadium offers an almost endless array of opportunities for fans â young and old alike â to indulge in, from Yankee lore to ballpark meals.\n\nBefore heading to the game, here is a guide to Yankee Stadium that includes everything fans need to know.\n\nHow do I get tickets to a game?\n\nGame tickets can be purchased directly from the Yankees online or at the stadiumâs box office. Websites like SeatGeek, StubHub and Ticketmaster also offer tickets to games.\n\nWhat happens if a home game is rained out?\n\nThe New York Yankees have a rain check policy. In most scenarios, youâll be able to exchange your ticket for the rescheduled game, or exchange the ticket for a comparable one in price and location if it is within 12 months of the originally scheduled game.\n\nThe teamâs full ticket and parking rainout policy can be viewed here.\n\nHow do I get to Yankee Stadium by driving?\n\nLocated at 1 East 161st St. in the Bronx, Yankee Stadium is accessible from the Major Deegan Expressway at the following exits:\n\nNorthbound I-87: Exit 4 (East 149th Street/145th Street Bridge) and Exit 5 (East 161st Street/Macombs Dam Bridge)\n\nSouthbound I-87: Exit 5 (East 161st Street/Macombs Dam Bridge)\n\nDoes Yankee Stadium provide parking?\n\nThe Yankees are not directly involved in prepaid parking around the stadium. The private company City Parking owns the rights to set rates and rules for parking lots, according to the Yankees. City Parking has more information about parking at the stadium listed on their website. The parking fee listed on their website is $47.\n\nWhat items are prohibited from the stadium?\n\nAccording to the Yankeesâ stadium guide, the items that attendees are not allowed to bring to the ballpark include:\n\nany bag larger than 16 inches by 16 inches by 8 inches\n\nhard-sided bags or containers of any size\n\nglass bottles or cans\n\nlaser pens\n\nselfie sticks\n\nmono/tripods or other professional camera equipment\n\nvideo cameras or other equipment designed for the sole purpose of video and/or audio recording\n\ndrones\n\nlaptop computers\n\nfirearms, knives or weapons of any kind\n\nalcohol\n\nFor a full list of banned items, check here.\n\nIn case you happen to bring something like a laptop with you to the ballpark, some businesses nearby offer luggage storage. A Yankee Stadium staff member can point you in the right direction.\n\nHow can I get there by public transit?\n\nFans can get to the ballpark via New York City subway, bus and commuter rail.\n\nOption 1: Subway\n\nThe No. 4 train and D train both stop at the 161st Street/Yankee Stadium subway station, located on East 161st Street and River Avenue. B train service is also available, but only on weekdays.\n\nOption 2: Bus\n\nThe Bx1, Bx2, Bx6, Bx13, and BxM4 all stop near Yankee Stadium. For more info on exactly where you can catch those buses, and where they let you off, check here.\n\nOption 3: Train\n\nMetro-North Railroad service also has a stop near the stadium (Yankees/East 153rd Street). You can check here for more information on their availability of service.\n\nLong Island Rail Road customers can take a train to Grand Central and transfer to either the 4 train (taking it to 161st Street/Yankee Stadium) or to a Metro-North train (taking it to Yankees/East 153rd Street).\n\nCan I bring food and drinks into the stadium?\n\nYes, but with limits. Food is permitted for âindividual consumption,â according to the stadiumâs information guidebook. So donât plan on feeding your entire row with food youâve brought from home.\n\nItems like apples or oranges must be sliced or sectioned.\n\nAs for drinks, unopened, clear plastic water bottles â 1 liter and smaller in size â are also permitted.\n\nWhatâs on the menu this year at the ballpark?\n\nIf youâve been to a Major League Baseball game at any point in the last few decades, you already know they serve more than just peanuts, Cracker Jacks and hot dogs at the ballpark.\n\nReturning restaurants this year to the stadium include fan favorites, such as Streetbird by Marcus Samuelsson, Bobby Flayâs âBobbyâs Burgers,â Lobelâs, Mighty Quinnâs, Fuku, chef Christian Petroni, Mac Truck, Chickieâs & Peteâs, City Winery, The Halal Guys and Benihana.\n\nCity Winery is adding some Porchetta sandwiches to the mix, StreetBird will include Mâs Spicy Chicken Wings to their offerings, and NYC chef Christian Petroni is introducing meatballs and cheesy garlic bread to his menu.\n\nNew partners at the stadium will include Mister Softee Soft Serve ice cream, Baby Ruth and Blue Bunny.\n\nWhat should I know about the New York Yankee Museum before I go?\n\nPart of the allure of the team is its rich history, which includes 27 World Series titles and dozens of Hall of Fame players and coaches.\n\nThat lore has been distilled inside the ballpark at the New York Yankee Museum, which includes exhibits on everything from the history of the old Yankee Stadium â known as the âHouse that Ruth builtâ â and Derek Jeter to displays of their World Series trophies, rings and notable game-used baseballs.\n\nThe stadium also offers a âHands on Historyâ experience eight times throughout the season each year, which gives patrons the opportunity to hold and take photos with Yankee artifacts, including game-used bats, jerseys, baseballs and World Series rings.\n\nYou can find out more about the hands-on experience here.\n\nAdditionally, Yankee Stadium also offers public and private tours of the venue, where customers can visit locations inside the stadium like the legendary Monument Park, where the legacies of the most storied Yankee greats are enshrined.\n\nTap here to read more about that experience.\n\nDid the Yankees make any deals during the offseason?\n\nFollowing their worst season in three decades, the Yankees made multiple splashes during the offseason, including adding the bat of former San Diego Padre Juan Soto to their lineup. The 25-year-old slugger is a three-time All Star who knocked in 35 homers and 109 RBIs last season. Itâs some offensive firepower that is expected to boost the lineup after their 2023 struggles.\n\nNew York also got Gold Glove center fielder Trent Grisham in the trade for Soto, which saw the Yankees send right-handed pitchers Michael King, Jhony Brito, Randy VÃ¡squez and Drew Thorpe, as well as catcher Kyle Higashioka, to the Padres.\n\nThe team also added Alex Verdugo, an outfielder who played for the rival Boston Red Sox last season. Verdugo, a 27-year-old lefty who batted .264 with 13 homers, and 54 RBIs last year, was also a Gold Glove finalist.\n\nThe teamâs biggest pitching acquisition was the signing of former Blue Jay, Met and Cub Marcus Stroman. Stroman was an All Star for a second time last season. He also won a Gold Glove in 2017."
