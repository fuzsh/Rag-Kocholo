        "text": "HOUSTON -- The Yankees begin their quest for a 28th World Series championship -- and first since 2009 -- when they take on the Houston Astros in the opener of a four-game series at 4:10 p.m. on Thursday at Minute Maid Park.\n\nJuan Soto will make his debut for the Yankees after being acquired in a 7-player trade with the San Diego Padres in the offseason.\n\nOn the mound, Nestor Cortes will start for New York against Houston's Framber Valdes. Reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole suffered an elbow injury in spring training and will start the season on the injured list.\n\nBy position, the Yankees' opening day starters are expected to be:\n\nCatcher: Jose Trevino\n\nFirst base: Anthony Rizzo\n\nSecond base: Gleyber Torres\n\nShortstop: Anthony Volpe\n\nThird base: Oswaldo Cabrera\n\nOutfield: Alex Verdugo (left), Aaron Judge (center), Soto (right)\n\nDesignated hitter: Giancarlo Stanton\n\nThe Yankees are 82-40-1 all-time on opening day, including wins in six of their last seven, while the Astros are 33-29.\n\nThe Yankees have won five of their last seven meetings with the Astros in the regular season, but Houston defeated New York in the AL Championship Series in 2017, 2019 and 2022.\n\nThe opener and the series finale will be broadcast on the YES Network, the second and third games will air on Apple TV+ and FOX, respectively. To see the Yankees' full regular season game and TV schedule, please click here.\n\nAfter this series in Houston, the Yankees start a three-game set in Arizona against the Diamondback before taking on the Toronto Blue Jays in the home opener at Yankee Stadium on April 5."
