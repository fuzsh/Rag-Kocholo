        "text": "David Fischer has written for The New York Times and Sports Illustrated For Kids and has worked at Sports Illustrated, National Sports Daily, and NBC Sports. He is the author of several sports titles, including Aaron Judge: The Incredible Story of the New York Yankees’ Home Run-Hitting Phenom; Derek Jeter #2: Thanks for the Memories, and Miracle Moments in New York Yankees History. Fischer is also the editor of Facing Mariano Rivera. He resides in New Jersey.\n\nThe 50's was the decade when America discovered television and television discovered the Yankees. What a time it was, and what great heroes the Yankees provided for a post-war nation with a Baby Boomer generation discovering the joy of baseball. David Fischer has rediscovered that time in this fine book, and that's a gift for us all.\n\n— Marty Appel, author of Pinstripe Empire, Munson, and Casey Stengel\n\nIt was baseball's last decade as America's unrivaled game--before the rise of the NFL and a calendar filled with world championships. It was the age when Major League baseball spread beyond the Mississippi River and the World Series meant everything. It was when the Yankees ruled, when schoolboys wanted to hit like Mickey and sportswriters labored to make sense of Casey. David Fischer gives the reader a box seat for the golden age.\n\n— Randy Roberts, co-author of A Season in the Sun: The Rise of Mickey Mantle\n\nThe Yankees dynasty was born with Babe Ruth in the 1920's and carried on through the 30's with Lou Gehrig and the 40's with Joe DiMaggio. In the 50's, pop culture produced two lasting legacies of the post-war era: rock 'n roll and the Yankees. The Bronx Bombers of the 50's brought us Mickey Mantle, and as TV sets popped up in households everywhere The Mick became as synonymous with 1950's America as Elvis. David Fischer's journey through this decade of Yankees dominance is perfect for fans of the Pinstripes both old and new.\n\n— Sweeny Murti, Yankees reporter, WFAN\n\n\"Fischer concentrates on the individuals who made the team so stellar and who came to personify excellence in the sport. . . . [His] frequent mentions of minority players and the role of television are essential and on the mark.\"-- Booklist\n\n— Booklist\n\n“A home run. It’s an outstanding book that brings a great era in Yankees history to life.”\n\n— Bronxpinstripes.com"
