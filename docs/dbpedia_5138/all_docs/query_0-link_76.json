        "text": "The New York Yankees are the most successful team in both Major League Baseball and all American sports. No other organization comes close to the 27 Yankees World Series wins.\n\nIn baseball, the St. Louis Cardinals are a distant second at 11. In all sports, the Boston Celtics are the closest U.S.-based team, with 17 NBA championships.\n\nThe following is a list of every Yankees World Series win. A handful are highlighted because even on this impressive list, they stand out. Of course, every Yankees fan has their own favorite – and plenty of great memories.\n\n1923\n\nYankees 4, New York Giants 2. The season opened with Babe Ruth hitting a home run at the first game played at the original Yankees Stadium. The season ended with the first Yankees World Series win.\n\n1927\n\nYankees 4, Pittsburgh Pirates 0. This series marked the first time a National League team was swept by an American League team.\n\n1928\n\nYankees 4, St. Louis Cardinals 0. The Yankees continued to rewrite the record books, as this was the first back-to-back championship for any team that swept both series. Ruth hit a staggering .625 in the series, hit three homers in Game 4 and caught the last out (off the bat of Frankie Frisch).\n\n1932\n\nYankees 4, Chicago Cubs 0. The Yankees swept the Cubs in a series that may have not been as memorable as others, but features one of the most famous moments in all of sports history. In Game 3, Babe Ruth came to the plate in the 5th inning to face Cub pitcher Charlie Root. He supposedly called his shot by pointing with the bat where he planned to hit the ball out in Wrigley Field – which he then did. However, debate continues to this day about whether he really called his shot. Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who was at the game as a kid, is one of the many eyewitnesses who said it happened. This also was the last World Series appearance for Ruth.\n\n1936\n\nYankees 4, Giants 2. This was a transition series for the Yankees, being the first with Joe DiMaggio and the first without Ruth. Same result.\n\nJoe DiMaggio's MLB Career\n\n1937\n\nYankees 4, Giants 1. Before this series, the Yankees were tied with the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox for the most championships (5). After this, the Yankees never looked back.\n\n1938\n\nYankees 4, Cubs 0. Another sweep and another victory over the Cubs. This one is notable because it was the Yankees last game in Wrigley Field until 2003 (an interleague matchup).\n\n1939\n\nYankees 4, Cincinnati Reds 0. The Yankees won their fourth in a row with yet another sweep. In Game 3, Yankees pitcher Monte Pearson pitched a complete game, two-hitter that lasted just 87 minutes.\n\n1941\n\nYankees 4, Dodgers 1. The first series win over the Dodgers – something that would become a frequent occurrence for long-suffering Brooklyn fans.\n\nWhy Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants Moved\n\n1943\n\nYankees 4, Cardinals 1. After losing to the Cardinals in 1942, the Yankees won to claim their 10th championship. That seemed like a lot – and it was – but they were just getting going.\n\n1947\n\nYankees 4, Dodgers 3. The first series in which an opponent pushed a series-winning Yankees team to Game 7.\n\n1949\n\nYankees 4, Dodgers 1. This series victory started a run in which the Yankees won five World Series in a row, all with Casey Stengel as manager, and 14 out of 16 American League championships.\n\n1950\n\nYankees 4, Philadelphia Phillies 0. The Whiz Kids of Philadelphia were no match for the Yankees and pitchers like Vic Raschi, Allie Reynolds and Whitey Ford.\n\n1951\n\nYankees 4, Giants 2. Another transition year, as this was the last World Series with Joe DiMaggio and the first with Mickey Mantle.\n\nThings You Didn’t Know About Mickey Mantle\n\n1952\n\nYankees 4, Dodgers 3. Another seven-game series against the Dodgers, another win for the Yankees.\n\n1953\n\nYankees 4, Dodgers 2. The fifth in a row, a feat never duplicated by any other baseball team. Future Yankees manager Billy Martin had 12 hits.\n\n1956\n\nYankees 4, Dodgers 3. After the Dodgers finally broke through and beat the Yankees in 1955, the Yankees came back and won again. This was the last all-New York City series until the Yankees played the New York Mets in 2000. This one is remembered most for Game 5, when Don Larsen pitched a perfect game to defeat the Dodgers. No one else has ever pitched a perfect game in the World Series, making this one of the most extraordinary feats in baseball. The image of catcher Yogi Berra leaping into Larsen’s arms after the final out is one of the most iconic in all sports.\n\nYogi Berra Early Life and MLB Career\n\n1958\n\nYankees 4, Milwaukee Braves 3. Milwaukee managed to take the Yankees to Game 7, and even led the series three games to one. Then, the Yankees stormed back, winning the final game behind great pitching from Bob Turley and an eighth inning rally started with a double by Berra.\n\n1961\n\nYankees 4, Reds 1. This was the same season in which Roger Maris beat Babe Ruth’s home run record by hitting his 61st on the last day of the season.\n\n1962\n\nYankees 4, Giants 3. This one is most remembered for how it ended. In the ninth inning of Game 7, Willie McCovey hit a scorching line drive with two runners on base – but Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson made the catch and ended the series.\n\n1977\n\nYankees 4, Los Angeles Dodgers 2. In one of the most remarkable feats ever, Reggie Jackson hit four home runs (one in Game 5, three in Game 6) all on the first pitch. What’s more, each was hit off a different Dodgers’ pitcher – Don Sutton, Burt Hooton, Elias Sosa and Charlie Hough. Jackson earned his nickname during this series: Mr. October. This was the only World Series win Billy Martin had as manager.\n\n1978\n\nYankees 4, Dodgers 2. Another back-to-back championship, with the Dodgers again on the losing end of a World Series against the Yankees.\n\n1996\n\nYankees 4, Atlanta Braves 2. In the first two games, the Braves outscored the Yankees 16-1. The Yankees never lost again. After taking three in row in Atlanta, the Yankees won the World Series – the team’s first in 18 years – in Yankees Stadium. The most memorable involved a comeback in Game 4, capped by catcher Jim Leyritz’s home run off Atlanta closer Mark Wohlers.\n\n1998\n\nYankees 4, San Diego Padres 0. David Wells, Orlando Hernandez and Andy Pettitte all collected wins in this series that was never close.\n\n1999\n\nYankees 4, Braves 0. The Yankees closed out the 20th century with another back-to-back championship run.\n\n2000\n\nYankees 4, New York Mets 1. And they opened the 21st century with a win over the Mets, giving the Yankees their third championship in a row.\n\n2009"
