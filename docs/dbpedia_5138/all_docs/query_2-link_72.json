        "text": "From top to bottom, the New York Yankees farm system features nine minor league affiliates. All levels of professional ball are represented, from Triple-A to foreign rookie leagues. The Yankees own all but two of the affiliates, with only the recently engaged Hudson Valley Renegades and Somerset Patriots being privately owned.\n\nThe Yankees farm system is now comprised of the following affiliates on the heels of the major restructuring MLB demanded in 2020 :\n\nAAA : Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders\n\nAA : Somerset Patriots\n\nHigh-A : Hudson Valley Renegades\n\nSingle-A : Tampa Tarpons\n\nRookie : Gulf Coast League Yankees 1\n\nRookie : Gulf Coast League Yankees 2\n\nDominican Summer League : Dominican Summer League Yankees\n\n2024 Yankees Top Minor League Prospects\n\nHereâ€™s a list of the 30 most highly regarded players in the Yankees system at the moment, complete with in-depth scouting profiles and updated statistics: 2020 New York Yankees Prospect Watch.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nIt all began in 1931 when New York Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert purchased the Newark Bears of the International League. It would become the foundation of the Yankees player development, or â€˜farmâ€™ system. By 1932, Ruppert had 5 minor league teams under club control including the A-Ball Springfield Rifles (Massachusetts), Cumberland Colts (Maryland), Binghamton Triplets (Binghamton, NY), and the Erie Sailors (Erie, Pennsylvania).\n\nThe affiliate team total ballooned to 24 by 1948, and while over the years most locations were in proximity to the East Coast and South, some were as far West as the Amarillo Gold Sox (1960 Texas League) and the 1951 San Francisco Seals. Joe DiMaggio played his minor league ball for the Seals in the early 1930s, and retired from pro ball after the 1951 season, which would be the only year the Seals would be part of the Yankees organization.\n\nBy the early 1950s, the height of â€˜the golden era of New York baseballâ€™, the Yankees farm system would be cultivating the stars of what would be the organizationâ€™s last hurrah in the early 60s â€” until The Bronx Zoo clubs restored the roar in The Boogie Down in the mid-to-late 70s.\n\nIn 1950, the then-Triple A affiliate, the Kansas City Blues, fielded teams that included a 21-year-old Whitey Ford, Elston Howard (21), Mickey Mantle (18), Billy Martin (22), and Lew Burdette (23). To reflect how level classifications have changed over the years, in 1950 it was AAA, AA, A, then B, C, and D leagues. In 1950, with all of that budding talent, the KC Blues went 54-99 (.353).\n\nThe Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders (AAA)\n\nThis storied minor league ball franchise debuted in 1919 and has bounced around the northeastern part of the country and Canada since.\n\nOriginating in Reading, Pennsylvania as the Reading Coal Barons the organization called home to numerous outposts in New York, New Jersey and Ottawa, Canada before settling in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in 1989 as an affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nIn 2007 the organization became the Yankees new Triple-A affiliate and assumed the name of the parent club. Games are played at PNC Field in Moosic, Pennsylvania. In 2013, the name was changed to the â€˜RailRidersâ€™ in homage to the areaâ€™s historical connection to Americaâ€™s railroad industry.\n\nâ€¢ Official Website\n\nâ€¢ RailRider Current Roster\n\nâ€¢ Team Statistics\n\nâ€¢ Schedule\n\nâ€¢ Ballpark Directions\n\nâ€¢ Purchase Game Tickets\n\nâ€¢ Local Radio Stations: The Game 93.5 FM | WICK 1400 AM\n\nâ€¢ Listen Live Online\n\nâ€¢ League/Division: International League ; North Division\n\nâ€¢ International League Standings\n\nâ€¢ League Championships: 2008, 2016\n\nâ€¢ Local Newspaper(s): Times-Leader (local news)\n\nâ€¢ Social Media: Twitter | Facebook | Instagram | RSS\n\nPlayers both drafted by the Yankees and played for SWB include:\n\nâ€¢ Joba Chamberlain (2007)\n\nâ€¢ Ian Kennedy (2007)\n\nâ€¢ Phil Hughes (2007)\n\nâ€¢ Brett Gardner (2007-2008)\n\nâ€¢ Ramiro PeÃ±a (2009)\n\nâ€¢ Kei Igawa (2007-2011)\n\nâ€¢ Hector Noesi (2010-2011)\n\n// more to come shortly\n\nThe Somerset Patriots (AA)\n\nPrior to joining the Eastern League, the Patriots were the most successful organization in the independent Atlantic League between 1998 and 2020. The Patriots are owned by auto industry entrepreneur and New Jersey Hall of Fame member Steve Kalafer, with Patrick McVerry serving as long-time General Manager. The team has been very active in local community affairs and charitable outreach.\n\nâ€¢ Official Website\n\nâ€¢ Somerset Patriots Current Roster\n\nâ€¢ Player Statistics\n\nâ€¢ 2024 Schedule & Results\n\nâ€¢ Going to a game?

At this writing only the Renegades and the Brooklyn Cyclones (New York Mets) are the only members. The Renegades were previously connected with the Tampa Rays (1996-2020) and the Texas Rangers (1994-95). They play homes games at Dutchess Stadium, a 4,500 seat ballpark in Fishkill, New York.\n\nâ€¢ Official Website\n\nâ€¢ Hudson Valley Renegades Current Roster\n\nâ€¢ Team Statistics\n\nâ€¢ Schedule\n\nâ€¢ Going to a game?

Dipping into the rich history of minor league baseball in the area, the â€˜Tampa Tarponsâ€™ name was revived from the days prior to 1957 when the team was an independent minor league club.\n\nHome games are played at George M. Steinbrenner Field where Spring Training for the Yankees is based.\n\nâ€¢ Official Website\n\nâ€¢ Tampa Tarpons Current Roster\n\nâ€¢ Player Statistics\n\nâ€¢ Schedule\n\nâ€¢ Going to a game?

There was a minute there when it looked like the organization might survive the carnage, but no luck. Things got nasty and went public between the ownership and the Yankees front office, and the Staten Island Yankees have since filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of New York State. While we welcome the new affiliates, itâ€™s tough to see one happen.\n\nPlayers of note who where both drafted by the Yankees and played with the Staten Island Yankees include:\n\nâ€¢ Robinson Cano (2002)\n\nâ€¢ Francisco Cervelli (2006)\n\nâ€¢ Brett Gardner (2005)\n\nâ€¢ Ian Kennedy (2006)\n\nâ€¢ Melky Cabrera (2001)\n\nâ€¢ Danny Burawa (2010)\n\nâ€¢ Andy Cannizaro (2000)\n\nâ€¢ Chance Adams (2015)\n\nâ€¢ Dellin Betances (2007)\n\nThe Pulaski Yankees (Advanced Rookie): Whacked\n\nAlso a casualty in MLBâ€™s restructuring of the farm system, the Pulaski Yankees are now a footnote in pinstripe history. The organization itself has been around since 1942 and have been associated with 8 major league teams over the decades, but in the Yankees family since only 2015 â€” but did notch an Appalachian League title in 2019.\n\nGulf Coast League Yankees (Rookie)\n\nDerek Jeter started here. So did Mariano Rivera. And a handful of others fortunate enough to not only reach mad heights of success in the Pinstripes, but to actually start out in the Yankees system. Since 1964, that system began with the Gulf Coast League.\n\nNamed after the ultimate destination of every player, since 2004 the Gulf Coast League Yankees have played home games in George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, shared by the Advanced A level Tampa Tarpons, as well as the official Spring Training facility of the big club.\n\nSince 2013, there have been two Yankees squads in the GCL â€” East (1) and West (2), which compete in different divisions. This is where weâ€™ll first see players just starting out in pro ball â€” from free agent walk-ons to advancing international free agent signings.\n\nâ€¢ Official Website(s): GLC Yankees East | GCL Yankees West\n\nâ€¢ Gulf Coast Yankees Current Rosters: East | West\n\nâ€¢ Player Stats: East | West\n\nâ€¢ League: Gulf Coast League\n\nâ€¢ Gulf Coast League Standings\n\nâ€¢ League Championships: 12 (since 1966)\n\nPlayers drafted by the Yankees and played for the Gulf Coast teams include:\n\nâ€¢ Joe Harvey (2014)\n\nâ€¢ Thairo Estrada (2014)\n\nâ€¢ Miguel Andujar (2012-2013)\n\nâ€¢ Tyler Austin (2010)\n\nâ€¢ Greg Bird (2011)\n\nâ€¢ Gary Sanchez (2010)\n\nâ€¢ John Ryan Murphy (2009)\n\nâ€¢ Ian Kennedy (2008)\n\nâ€¢ Austin Romine (2007)\n\nâ€¢ Ivan Nova (2006)\n\nâ€¢ Hector Noesi (2010-2011)\n\nâ€¢ Francisco Cervelli (2005)\n\nâ€¢ Phil Hughes (2004)\n\nâ€¢ Robinson Cano (2001)\n\nâ€¢ Juan Rivera (1998)\n\nâ€¢ Nick Johnson (1996)\n\nâ€¢ Derek Jeter (1992)\n\nâ€¢ Ricky Ledee (1990-91-92)\n\nâ€¢ Mariano Rivera (1990, 1993)\n\nâ€¢ Ramiro Mendoza (1993)\n\nâ€¢ Shane Spencer (1990-1991)\n\nâ€¢ Sterling Hitchcock (1989)\n\nâ€¢ Marcus Thames (1987) / Our 2019 hitting coach!\n\nâ€¢ Bernie Williams (1986)\n\nâ€¢ Jose Cano (1980) / Yes, Robinsonâ€™s dad!\n\nâ€¢ Roberto Kelly (1980)\n\nâ€¢ Fred McGriff (1980) / Donâ€™t get me started about the trade!\n\n2024 Dominican Summer League\n\nFounded in 1985, the Dominican Summer League (DSL) is a rookie league which packs a 64-game schedule into about 11 weeks between June 1 and late August.\n\nThe DSL Yankees play in the Boca Chica South Division against squads from the Angels, Cardinals, Nationals, Orioles, Phillies, Rockies and Twins. All told there are six divisions totaling 45 teams. The players are between the ages of 16 and 22, with the top prospects moving up to lower tiered minor league teams in the United States. The Yankees have been very active in recruiting international talent and many will begin their journeys to the big leagues in the DSL.\n\nâ€¢ Official Website (in Spanish only)\n\nâ€¢ Standings\n\nâ€¢ 2024 DSL Schedule\n\nRecommended Reading"
