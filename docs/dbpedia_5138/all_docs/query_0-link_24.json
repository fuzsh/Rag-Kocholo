They are in the Eastern Division of the American League.\n\nOne of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Yankees have been among the most storied teams in American sports over their 100+ year history; along with franchises like the Boston Celtics, Dallas Cowboys, and Montreal Canadiens, the Yankees have helped exemplify the phrase \"dynasty\" in professional athletics. They are one of two major league franchises which operate in New York City, the other being the New York Mets of the National League.\n\nThe Yankees have won 26 World Series in 39 appearances; the St. Louis Cardinals and the Athletics franchise are tied for second with 9 World Series victories each, and the Dodgers franchise is second in World Series appearances with 18. Among the North American major sports, the Yankees' success is only approached by the 24 Stanley Cup championships of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League. The Yankees are also the only team that is represented at every position in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nEstablished : 1901 Based in New York : since 1903\n\nMajor league affiliations\n\nAmerican League :(1901-present) East Division : (1969-present)"
