        "text": "Today, The New York Yankees were proud to pay tribute to members of the United States Military and to the United States Special Operations Command. For the past 41 years, The Special Operations Warrior Foundation has been supporting the families of fallen Special Operations personnel by providing comprehensive ‚ÄúCradle to Career‚Äù educational funding and advocacy for the children of fallen Special Operators, deceased SOF spouses, and all Medal of Honor recipients. Today we welcomed the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation ‚Äì Retired Major General Clay Hutmacher, who was a career Army officer and served over 40 years in uniform. He was joined by Lillian Woods, the surviving daughter of United States Army Sergeant First Class William Woods who lost his life in 2009 while serving with the 20th Special Forces Group. Through the help of the Warrior Foundation Lillian is currently a Junior at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Additionally, we thank our partners from the Friedman Family Foundation, The Robert Irvine Foundation, and Black Rifle Coffee Company for donating a combined total of $370,000 to the Warrior Foundation üëè\n\nKnocking it out of the park for a great cause! ‚öæÔ∏è The New York Yankees staff stepped up to the plate at Food Bank For New York City's warehouse, assembling 1,000 children‚Äôs snack kits and Starbucks items to be sent around the five boroughs. We‚Äôre incredibly thankful to have the Yankees on our team! #nyc #yankees #giveback\n\nOn this National Intern Appreciation Day, we recognize our fantastic group of summer interns at Yankee Stadium üëè As they wrap up their time with us this summer, we want to express our appreciation for their dedication and hard work.

Each participant also receives a bag filled with provisions to prepare the demonstrated healthy meals at home after each session. At the conclusion of the program, participants receive their own custom chef jackets, a specially tailored recipe book that displays the recipes they learned throughout the program and groceries from Healthy Homeplate partners Associated Super Market group and Avenue A to implement the recipes they learned throughout the program.\n\nEarlier this week, the Yankees, in partnership with the New York City Police Department‚Äôs Blue Chips Program, NYC Department of Parks & Recreation, NYC Department of Youth & Community Development, The Players Alliance, SCAN-Harbor and Poland Spring Spring Water, held Opening Day for the Summer Night Lights Program at Elston Gene Howard Field.
