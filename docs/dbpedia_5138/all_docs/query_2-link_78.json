        "text": "The 2024 baseball season is heating up, and if you’re a Yankees fan, Prime Video is serving you some of the most anticipated match-ups and rivals in all of Major League Baseball.\n\nPrime Video is exclusively broadcasting 21 New York Yankees games to those in the Yankees territory. That’s to say, if you live in New York state, Connecticut, north and central New Jersey, and northeast Pennsylvania, it’s worth tuning in to Prime Video on game day. That’s at no extra cost, mind you—so if you’re a fan, you don’t have to worry about additional subscription costs, on top of a Prime subscription.\n\nWhether you’re a huge Yankees fan, or you just live in the area and want to keep an eye on the game, here’s when and how to watch New York Yankees games on Prime Video.\n\nWhich Yankees Games will be on Prime Video?\n\nYou can check out the full schedule of exclusive games on Prime Video. All of the game times below are listed in Eastern Daylight Time, and the schedule is subject to change. These are the remaining games for the 2024 season:\n\nMonday, July 29: New York Yankees at Philadelphia Phillies – 6:30 p.m.\n\nWednesday, August 7: Los Angeles Angels at New York Yankees – 7:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday, August 14: New York Yankees at Chicago White Sox – 8:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday, August 21: Cleveland Guardians at New York Yankees – 7:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday, August 28: New York Yankees at Washington Nationals – 6:30 p.m.\n\nWednesday, September 4: New York Rangers at Texas Rangers – 8:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday, September 11: Kansas City Royals at New York Yankees – 7:00 p.m.\n\nSchedule is subject to change.\n\nWhat else to know about watching Yankees games on Prime Video\n\nPrime Video’s 30-minute pregame show has also returned, with YES’ Meredith Marakovits hosting for home games, and Bob Lorenz hosting for away games.\n\nYES Network play-by-play announcer Michael Kay will once again be behind the mic for Prime Video’s Yankees in-game coverage. Entering his 33rd year as the voice of the storied franchise, Kay will be joined by YES analysts David Cone, Paul O’Neill, Joe Girardi, John Flaherty, and Jeff Nelson.\n\nYankees games on Prime Video will feature Amazon’s X-Ray technology, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), allowing viewer access to live in-game stats, team and player details, and real-time play-by-play information for fans streaming on Android, iOS mobile, and Fire TV. Prime Video’s live Yankees games will be available to MLB.TV subscribers outside the Yankees’ home-team footprint.\n\nHow to watch Yankees games on Prime Video\n\nIt’s very easy to watch Yankees games on Prime Video. As mentioned, you’ll need to live in New York state, Connecticut, north or central New Jersey, or northeast Pennsylvania to see the game.\n\nAssuming you do, all you need to do is open up the Prime Video app on your smart TV, phone, or tablet; or open Prime Video on the web; when a game is on.\n\nPrime Video is included with an Amazon Prime membership, priced at $14.99 per month or $139 annually. Amazon has also extended its services to cater to a broader demographic, offering discounted memberships through Prime Access, aimed at those benefiting from certain government assistance programs—and Prime Student, for those enrolled in higher education.\n\nWhat else is on Prime Video?\n\nWhen the game is done, there are tons of other things you can tune into on Prime Video. Notably, Prime Video offers access to original movies, TV shows, and documentaries, and there should be something there for everyone.\n\nFantasy fans will want to take a look at Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, while action fans should check out Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan. Other popular Amazon Originals include the likes of The Marvelous Mrs. Maiseland A League of Their Own. And, if you’re a fan of baseball, it’s worth checking out the Reggie docuseries, which focuses on baseball legend Reggie Jackson.\n\nNext, learn everything you need to know about Prime Video and Amazon Freevee."
