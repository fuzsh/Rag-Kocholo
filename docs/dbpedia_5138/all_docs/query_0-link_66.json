        "text": "Guest blog by Smithsonian-published author Stephen Wong who also serves as honorary advisor to the Baseball: America’s Home Run exhibition.\n\n“No man or woman born, coward or brave, can shun his destiny.”\n\n—Homer, The Illiad—\n\n“It was commonly said at the time that Lou Gehrig lived in [Babe] Ruth’s shadow,” said sportswriter Fred Lieb, who covered Gehrig and the Yankees for several newspapers. “Such talk never bothered Lou. ‘It’s a pretty big shadow,’ he said. ‘It gives me lots of room to spread myself.’” Gehrig, the strong, silent type without an ounce of boast, preferred to let his bat and glove do the talking, and he was happy to cede the spotlight to Ruth. “Let’s face it. I’m not a headline guy,” Gehrig once said.\n\nGehrig achieved a lifetime batting average of .340, with 493 home runs and 1,995 RBI—including a record 185 RBI in a single year (1931) and more than 150 RBI seven times in his 17 years with the Yanks. Gehrig belted 23 career grand slams, a record that lasted until 2013, when Alex Rodriguez broke it. Gehrig is best remembered, however, for playing in 2,130 games over 14 years without taking a day off, a streak of longevity and toughness that earned him the sobriquet “the Iron Horse.”\n\nGehrig’s meteoric rise to fame, abrupt decline, and death at the age of 37 has made him somewhat of a mythical hero. His illness and how he handled himself are better remembered than all he accomplished playing 17 seasons for the New York Yankees. Gehrig seemed invincible, with no physical weaknesses, yet he withered away from a rare, incurable disease. “Don’t think I am depressed or pessimistic about my condition at present,” Gehrig wrote following his retirement from baseball after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), now commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. “I intend to hold on as long as possible and then if the inevitable comes, I will accept it philosophically and hope for the best. That’s all we can do.”\n\nBorn on June 19, 1903, Henry Louis Gehrig developed his work ethic as a child partly as a result of a negative example. His father, a first-generation German immigrant, was a part-time sheet metal worker who drank too much and frequently missed work. When he interacted with his son, it was usually in a drunken rage. Gehrig’s mother, also from Germany, worked as a maid, and Lou helped her do laundry and sweep stairs. He found solace in baseball and starred at Commerce High School in Manhattan, earning the attention of sportswriters, particularly after his performance in an intercity game against Chicago’s Lane Tech High School on June 26, 1920. In the ninth inning of that game, Gehrig hit a grand slam, prompting the Chicago Tribune to write, “Gehrig’s blow would have made any big leaguer proud, yet it was walloped by a boy who hasn’t yet started to shave.”\n\nLou finished high school in 1921 and entered Columbia University on a football scholarship, with plans to study engineering. Scout Arthur Irwin convinced Gehrig to try out for the Giants, and he hit six consecutive home runs in batting practice. But when Gehrig allowed a grounder to roll between his legs, Giants manager John McGraw yelled, “Get this fellow out of here! I’ve got enough lousy players without another one showing up.” Irwin found Gehrig a spot on the Hartford Senators of the Class A Eastern League for the rest of the 1921 season.\n\nIn his sophomore year at Columbia, Gehrig set records for batting average (.444), slugging percentage (.937), and home runs (seven). His power caught the attention of Paul Krichell, a scout for the New York Yankees. The left-handed Gehrig was six feet tall and weighed 200 pounds, and he set home-run distance records on several fields. “That right field at Cornell had a high fence, then there was a road back of it, then a forest,” recalled Gehrig’s Columbia teammate, second baseman George Moisten. “Lou lifted his home run into the forest. I looked over at coach [Andy] Coakley, sitting near me on the bench, and he was slapping his head in wonder.”\n\nThe Yankees signed Gehrig in 1923, and he played sparingly in 1923 and 1924. But in 1925, he hit 20 home runs and became the team’s regular first baseman, taking over the position from 32-year-old Wally Pipp and launching his consecutive-games streak. One story suggested that Gehrig filled in for Pipp because Pipp had a headache. Pipp later conceded that Gehrig earned the position because he was simply the better ballplayer. Pipp’s numbers had been in steady decline all season (.244 average), and Gehrig turned the team around, particularly in 1926, after Yankees manager Miller Huggins taught the 23-year-old Gehrig to pull pitches to the short right-field fence. Gehrig soon realized that he could pull any pitcher in the league. In 1927, sportswriters began calling the Yankees lineup (with Gehrig batting fourth after Babe Ruth) “Murderers’ Row.” Gehrig and the Bambino went head to head in home runs, and Gehrig finished the season with 47 to Ruth’s record of 60. Gehrig was named the American League’s MVP.\n\nGehrig enjoyed one solid season after another. In 1932, he swatted four consecutive home runs in a single game, the first time that happened in the twentieth century. Philadelphia Athletics fans, who hated the Yankees with a passion, gave Gehrig a standing ovation when he crossed home plate the fourth time. Two years later, he took home the Triple Crown, leading the league in batting average (.363), RBI (166), and home runs (49). He became the third player in baseball history to lead both the AL and NL in all three categories. When Ruth left the Yankees for the Boston Braves after the 1934 season, Gehrig became the undisputed leader of the Yankees. In 1937, Gehrig posted a team-leading n.351 batting average with 37 home runs, and he helped the Bronx Bombers claim their sixth World Series title. Gehrig wore this gray wool-flannel New York Yankees road jersey during that remarkable season.\n\nThe jersey features the 1939 Baseball Centennial Patch on the left sleeve, which signifies that Gehrig also wore the garment in 1939, a season that would come to define his legacy. At one time, Gehrig had outfielders backing up to the fences when he stepped to the plate. But when the 1939 season started, Gehrig was so weak he could barely hit the ball out of the infield. After he missed several easy pitches that, as DiMaggio noted, he normally would have “hit into the next county,” Gehrig saw the handwriting on the wall. On April 30, he played his last big league game against the Washington Senators. When the Yankees took the field in Detroit on May 2, Gehrig—his batting average down to .143—withdrew from the lineup and, for the first time in 2,130 straight games, sat on the Yankees bench wearing the wool-blend New York Yankees professional model warm-up jacket shown here. On June 19—Gehrig’s 36th birthday—doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, diagnosed him with ALS.\n\n(The above jacket will be on display in the museum in the Spring of 2023.)\n\nTwo days later, the Yankees announced Gehrig’s retirement, and on July 4, the team organized Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium. A crowd of 61,808 thundered a “hail and farewell” to baseball’s Iron Horse. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia opened the ceremony by declaring Gehrig “the greatest prototype of sportsmanship and good citizenship.” Members of the 1927 Yankees championship team paraded on the field. The group included Babe Ruth, Waite Hoyt, Bob Meusel, Earle Combs, Herb Pennock, Tony Lazzeri, Joe Dugan, Mark Koenig, Benny Bengough, Bob Shawkey, and George Pipgras.\n\nOvercome by this extraordinary reception, Gehrig stepped to the microphone and kept his eyes glued to the ground as he fought to keep back the tears. Speaking steadily and calmly, he delivered one of the most celebrated speeches in American history:\n\nWhat young man wouldn’t give anything to mingle with such men for a single day as I have for all these years? Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about a bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth. . . . I’ve got an awful lot to live for.\n\nGehrig died on June 2, 1941, exactly 16 years after he replaced Wally Pipp at first base. Today, more than 83 years after Gehrig’s Yankee Stadium oration, we are still moved by his embodiment of courage, humility, and strength. Here lies the armour of baseball’s most mythical hero, glorious garments worn by Henry Louis Gehrig as his life neared its tragic end.\n\nRay and Marion, who were prominent New York citizens and close friends of Lou and Eleanor, assisted Eleanor with the process of finalizing Lou’s affairs after his death. After Lou’s passing, the jacket was given to Ray and Marion Parker by Eleanor as a token of her appreciation. The jacket remained within the family of Marion Parker until 2008.\n\n—Based on “Mythical Hero” by Stephen Wong in Game Worn: Baseball Treasures from the Game’s Greatest Heroes and Moments, Stephen Wong and Dave Grob, Smithsonian Books, 2016—"
