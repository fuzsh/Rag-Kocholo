        "text": "Cabrera went 2-for-5 with one RBI, a stolen base and two runs scored in Wednesday's 10-2 win over the White Sox.\n\nCabrera's playing time predictably dropped when the Yankees traded for Jazz Chisholm, but Chisholm is now out indefinitely with an elbow injury. This has opened up third base for Cabrera, tho has hit safely in each of his last five games. The utility man is at a .248/.294/.376 slash line with eight home runs, four steals, 35 RBI and 39 runs scored across 280 plate appearances this year. Cabrera is a switch hitter, which should given him a reasonable chance at maintaining a platoon advantage over DJ LeMahieu or Oswald Peraza if the Yankees don't want Cabrera in an everyday role.\n\nSoto went 1-for-2 with a solo home run, three walks and three total runs scored in Wednesday's 10-2 win over the White Sox.\n\nSoto opened the scoring with a first-inning solo shot. He walked in his last three plate appearances, including once intentionally during the Yankees' eighth-inning rally. Soto's last six hits (over a span of four games) have all been homers, giving him 34 on the year. He's added a .307 average, 1.052 OPS, 87 RBI and a major-league-leading 103 runs scored through 118 contests.\n\nWells went 3-for-5 with a solo home run and two additional RBI in Wednesday's 10-2 win over the White Sox.\n\nWells' homer was his first since July 26, though he batted a strong .298 over the 14 contests between long balls. The catcher continues to bat cleanup versus right-handers, keeping him in a prime spot to rack up RBI in a strong lineup. For the season, Wells is slashing .257/.347/.426 with nine homers, 36 RBI, 32 runs scored and one stolen base over 292 plate appearances.\n\nJudge went 2-for-4 with a three-run home run, a double, a walk and two total runs scored in Wednesday's 10-2 win over the White Sox.\n\nJudge slugged his 300th career homer when he went deep in the eighth inning. He became the fastest player in major-league history to reach the 300-homer mark, doing so in his 955th game to easily surpass Ralph Kiner (1,087 games) to that milestone mark. Judge is batting .500 (20-for-40) with four homers over 12 games in August, lifting his slash line to a stellar .333/.467/.707 with 43 long balls, 110 RBI, 95 runs scored, six stolen bases, 28 doubles and a triple through 120 contests.\n\nTonkin allowed two hits and struck out two without walking a batter over three innings to earn the save in Wednesday's 10-2 win over the White Sox.\n\nThe Yankees pulled ahead in the seventh inning and then rallied for more in the eighth, so Tonkin stayed in the game and ended up with his second save of the year. This was just his second scoreless appearance in nine outings since the All-Star break. He's added one hold this season while rarely featuring in high-leverage spots. Tonkin has a 3.21 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and 63:22 K:BB over 61.2 innings between the Yankees, Mets and Twins in 2024.\n\nWarren allowed two runs on seven hits and struck out five without walking a batter over five innings in a no-decision versus the White Sox on Wednesday.\n\nWarren exited with the Yankees down 2-1, but they rallied for nine runs between the seventh and eighth innings. This was the best of Warren's three appearances in the majors this season. He's allowed 14 runs over 14.2 innings while posting a 17:5 K:BB. The 25-year-old is expected to be sent back to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in the near future since this was likely just a spot start to build in some rest for the Yankees' other starters.\n\nCabrera will start at third base and bat eighth in Wednesday's game against the White Sox.\n\nWith Jazz Chisholm (elbow) hitting the injured list Wednesday, Cabrera will man the hot corner for the second game in a row and looks like he'll get the first chance to claim the open spot in the Yankees' everyday lineup. Cabrera enters Wednesday's contest with a four-game hitting streak, but he's supplied a modest .245/.292/.375 slash line with eight home runs and three stolen bases across 275 plate appearances on the season. Along with Cabrera, DJ LeMahieu and Oswald Peraza could get looks at third base while Chisholm is out indefinitely.\n\nStanton is not in the lineup for Wednesday's game against the White Sox.\n\nStanton will get a chance to rest Wednesday after going 1-for-8 with three strikeouts through the first two games of the series. His absence open up the designated-hitter spot for Aaron Judge while allowing Trent Grisham to start in center field.\n\nGrisham (hand) will start in center field and bat sixth Wednesday against the White Sox.\n\nGrisham hasn't played since he was hit in the hand by a pitch during the first game of Saturday's twin bill versus the Rangers, but he'll now return to the starting nine after a few days of rest. The 27-year-old outfielder is slashing .179/.304/.359 across 47 plate appearances since the All-Star break, though he has tallied a hit in three of his last four games.\n\nRice is out of the lineup for Wednesday's game against the White Sox.\n\nAfter going 0-for-5 with a strikeout through the first two games of the series, Rice will get a day off during Wednesday's series finale. DJ LeMahieu will step in to cover first base while batting ninth.\n\nThe Yankees designated De Los Santos for assignment Wednesday.\n\nThe move comes two days after De Los Santos was bludgeoned for seven runs over a 1.2-inning relief appearance versus the White Sox. While his brief tenure with the Yankees has gone poorly, De Los Santos has a career 25.6 percent strikeout rate as a reliever and is under team control through 2026, so he could draw interest via trade or waivers.\n\nThe Yankees recalled Warren from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday.\n\nWarren will make a spot start Wednesday in Chicago against the White Sox. He has coughed up 12 runs over 9.2 innings in his previous two starts with the Yankees this season, though he notched 12 strikeouts. Warren is expected to be sent back down to Triple-A after the game.\n\nThe Yankees recalled Peraza from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday.\n\nPeraza will join the 26-man active roster as a replacement for Jazz Chisholm (elbow), who was placed on the injured list. The 24-year-old has slashed .244/.351/.382 with eight home runs and 17 steals across 65 contests with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre this season. He could see some starts at third base while Chisholm is out, but Peraza could struggle to see everyday playing time.\n\nThe Yankees placed Chisholm on the 10-day injured list Wednesday with a left elbow sprain.\n\nHe was injured during Monday's game against the White Sox on a slide into home plate. A decision on whether Chisholm will be able to rest and rehab the injury or require season-ending surgery has yet to be made, but even in a best-case scenario, he's going to miss multiple weeks of action. In the meantime, Oswaldo Cabrera is likely to see the bulk of the starts at third base for the Yankees, with DJ LeMahieu and Oswald Peraza also in the mix for playing time at the position.\n\nHamilton (lat) is scheduled to toss a live bullpen session this week, Bryan Hoch of MLB.com reports.\n\nHamilton has recently been upping the intensity of his bullpen sessions, and because he's cleared that hurdle without any setbacks, he's now ready to face live hitters. The right-hander could subsequently move on to a minor-league rehab assignment and may be back in the big-league bullpen by the end of the month. Hamilton had been struggling prior to landing on the injured list, allowing eight runs (seven earned) over four innings spanning his previous four appearances.\n\nThe Yankees are expected to recall Peraza from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to take the roster spot of the injured Jazz Chisholm (elbow), Daniel Alvarez-Montes of ElExtraBase.com reports.\n\nThere's still no word yet on the seriousness of Chisholm's left UCL injury, but a trip to the 10-day injured list is a foregone conclusion. Peraza is the logical choice to replace him on the roster and could see some action at third base in Chisholm's stead, although Oswaldo Cabrera and/or DJ LeMahieu figure to be given first dibs. The 24-year-old Peraza has yet to play an inning for the Yankees this season, having slashed .244/.351/.382 with eight homers and 17 steals across 65 contests with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre."
