Jallianwala Bagh Massacre

On 13 April, 1919, thousands of people assembled at Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh for celebrating Baisakhi and for peacefully protesting against the arrest of some local leaders. General Dyer entered Jallianwala Bagh along with his troops, and blocked the main entrance. He ordered his troops to open fire on the crowd without any warning for around 10 minutes until the ammunition supply was almost exhausted. Hundreds of innocent people lost their lives in the unfortunate incident and over a thousand were injured. Udham Singh was present during this incident, and was serving water to the crowd from the orphanage with his friends.

Michael O’Dwyer, who was the LG of Punjab during the Jallianwala Bagh incident, was scheduled to give a speech at Caxton Hall in London on 13 March 1940. Singh hid a revolver in a book, and entered the hall. He shot O’Dwyer twice. Singh was formally charged with the murder on 1 April 1940, and he called himself âRam Mohammad Singh Azadâ in custody. The first three names represented the three major religious communities in Punjab - Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, while the word âAzadâ (free) stood for his anti-colonial sentiment. Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, he was hanged at London’s Pentonville prison. His remains are still preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh.
