        "text": "Of the seven Indian players to win three Olympic gold medals for hockey (field), only Udham Singh and Leslie Claudius also won a silver medal. Singh won gold in 1952, 1956 and 1964 and a silver in 1960. Singh was a centre-forward who was the leading scorer at the 1956 Olympics with 14 goals.\n\nAfter Toni Sailer, Jean-Claude Killy became the second person to win all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics. His victory in the slalom was controversial, as Karl Schranz was disqualified under mysterious circumstances."
