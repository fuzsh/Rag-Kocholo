        "text": "Millions of people sacrificed their lives to make India what it is today. While we remember the few well known names there were other who are rarely mentioned. One such revolutionary and great freedom fighter was Shaheed Udham Singh Kamboj. Born on December 26, 1899, in Sunam, today is his 117th birth anniversary. Shaheed Udham Singh Kamboj (December 26, 1899 â€“ July 31, 1940) was one of the great patriots of India, with a burning desire to see his motherland free from the clutches of British colonialism and imperialism. This message is to pay rich tributes and homage to the great martyr of our community and Indian freedom struggle. Shaheed Udham Singh Kamboj avenged the massacre of JallianWala Bagh Amritsar on April 13, 1919 in which numerous patriots made supreme sacrifices against the tyranny of the British Government during the freedom struggle of India. Shaheed Udham Singh ki Jai !!!\n\nRead more about Shaheed Udham Singh"
