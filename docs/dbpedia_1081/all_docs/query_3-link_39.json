In this blog post, we delve into the details surrounding his date of birth, shedding light on the life of this fearless freedom fighter.\n\nUdham Singh: A Brief Overview\n\nUdham Singh was born in Sunam, Punjab, British India, during a time when the Indian subcontinent was grappling with British colonial rule.
