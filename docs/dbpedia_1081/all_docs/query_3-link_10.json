        "text": "Context:\n\nEvery year India observes July 31 as Shaheed Udham Singh Martyrdom Day.\n\nUdham Singh\n\nUdham Singh was born Sher Singh on December 26, 1899, in the Sunam city of Sangrur districts.\n\nAfter his father’s death, he and his older brother were raised in a Central Khalsa orphanage in Amritsar.\n\nUdham Singh joined the Ghadar movement in the early 1920s.\n\nSingh rose to prominence as a Ghadar activist in the US, establishing the Azad Party and broadening his network abroad.\n\nHe met Bhagat Singh in prison after being arrested in 1927 for carrying a weapon and reading seditious literature.\n\nUdham Singh was a survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\nHe planned revenge against former Punjab lieutenant governor O’Dwyer and assassinated him in 1940.\n\nJallianwala Bagh Massacre:\n\nThis incident happened on April 13, 1919, in which under O’Dwyer’s regime British Brigadier Reginald Dyer fired at a crowd of Indians in an open space known as the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, killing several hundred people and wounding many hundreds more.\n\nStory of revenge\n\nAs Michael O’Dwyer (then Lt. governor of Punjab) was giving a speech at Caxton Hall, Udham Singh shot him 5 times at point-blank range with a handgun hidden in the book.\n\nThe massacre’s mastermind, Reginald Dyer, had passed away in 1927.\n\nHe was sentenced to death in the Central Criminal Court. He also went on a hunger strike while in jail. He hanged himself on July 31, 1940, in a London jail.\n\nUdham Singh’s Legacy\n\nSingh’s one-room accommodation ancestral house in Sunam has been converted into a museum, now maintained by the archaeology department.\n\nIn 1974, Singh’s remains were exhumed in the UK and repatriated to India.\n\nIn 2016, marking Udham Singh’s birthday, then Punjab Chief Minister laid the foundation stone of a memorial for Singh, it was built on four acres of land in Sunam. The memorial was inaugurated on October 31, 2021.\n\nPunjab and Haryana observe public holidays on the day of his execution.\n\nOn the directive of the then-chief minister of undivided Uttar Pradesh, the Udham Singh Nagar district in Uttarakhand bears the name of Udham Singh.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nIndia and Vietnam to Intensify National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC)"
