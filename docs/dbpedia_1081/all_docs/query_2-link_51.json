        "text": "Shaheed Udham Singh was a well-known freedom fighter from Punjab. Udham Singh belonged to Ghadar party and was best known for the assassinating Michael O' Dwyer, the former Lieutenant Governor of Punjab in India. Dwyer's assassination on March 13, 1940, was carried out as a revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919.\n\nUdham Singh was convicted and hanged in 1940 for the murder of Dwyer.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHere are some facts about the great martyr:\n\nUdham Singh was born as Sher Singh in Sangrur, Punjab.\n\nUdham Singh was given the title of Shaheed-i-Azam (the great martyr).\n\nSingh became an orphan at an early age and was taken away by Central Khalsa Orphanage, Putlighar. He was named Udham Singh after he joined the orphanage.\n\nSingh was an eyewitness of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\nSingh was a fond of Bhagat Singh and used to look up to him as one of his idols.\n\nSingh hid his revolver in a book and assassinated Dwyer during a meeting at Caxton Hall, London. Singh had carved the shape of the revolver to fit it inside the book.\n\nUdham Singh did not run away after shooting two times at Dwyer, who died on the spot. Singh, instead, waited for the officials to arrest him.\n\nWhile awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and had to be forcibly fed. Singh was hanged at Pentonville Prison in July 1940.\n\nSingh's weapon, a knife, a diary and a bullet from shooting are kept in Black Museum, Scotland Yard.\n\nThe remains of Udham Singh are preserved at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar.\n\nPublished By:\n\nNeha Vashishth\n\nPublished On:\n\nJul 31, 2018\n\n--- ENDS ---"
