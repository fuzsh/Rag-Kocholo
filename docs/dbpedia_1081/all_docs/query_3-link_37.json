        "text": "HOW NOT TO DO LEADERSHIP, BY SUELLA & RISHI ‚Äú‚Ä¶When there is no vision, there is no hope‚Ä¶‚Äù - George Washington Carver When addressing the topic of leadership amongst those we coach, we frequently ask them to list their favourite leaders, or those they admire most, and highlight the virtues exhibited by their choices. This exercise helpfully illustrates behaviours and practical skills individuals might want to acquire. But in our experience, a second, and far more valuable exercise, is to review the performance of those who are in positions of leadership and assess their weaknesses. Why ? You see, when an individual is in a position of leadership, there is an unspoken expectation for them to behave in ways reflecting their seniority, so when they do, it‚Äôs the expected default. It‚Äôs when they don‚Äôt, everyone takes notice. So it‚Äôs the weaknesses a leader wants to avoid. And we distinguish clearly between the notions of vulnerability and weakness. And that brings us neatly to ‚ÄòSuella‚Äô and ‚ÄòRishi‚Äô. The former has effectively ended her career by her recent utterances on the topics of the homeless and police bias. These were comments unfitting of a person in high office, or wanting to be a serious leader. She was simply appealing to a tiny portion of right wing activists in her Party, not those of a wider world. She‚Äôs ‚ÄòBoris‚Äôed‚Äô herself before she‚Äôs even taken off. (Boris‚Äôed is our term for self-sabotage) But the greater failing has come from Rishi, who has for too long, tolerated her aberrations, to the point he is almost forced to give her more oxygen, until the point he will have to act. But then it will be too late - he should have acted earlier. And this is a profound lesson of leadership. Act in time, even when the choice is difficult, because the final choice following procrastination will be the most damaging. But this should always have been clear from the outset, as the answer is always in a name. One anagram of ‚ÄòSuella‚Äô and ‚ÄòRishi‚Äô is ‚ÄòAh, sillier Us‚Äô, and so it has proven to be. Why not contact us below to find out more about our Leadership mentoring programs - and before it is too late. ‚ÄòAh, cleverer, me‚Äô Good fortunes, The METRICA Group\n\nLeadership is an art that encompasses a multitude of qualities and responsibilities. It is about setting an example, guiding others through actions, and demonstrating the values that define a leader. A recent incident involving the Prime Minister of the Netherlands exemplifies these principles in an unexpected way. In a moment that could have easily gone unnoticed, the Dutch Prime Minister found himself in a situation that demonstrated his leadership prowess. As he accidentally spilled his coffee, he chose not to delegate the cleanup to someone else but instead took it upon himself to rectify the situation. What followed was a heartwarming response from his people, who couldn't help but applaud his humility and commitment to leading by example. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that leadership goes beyond just words; it is about action, responsibility, and self-discipline. Leading by Example: In any organization, when leaders take the initiative to uphold the standards they set, it inspires others to do the same. This creates a culture where everyone takes ownership and responsibility for their actions, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and productive work environment. Responsibility and Accountability: In a leadership role, owning up to mistakes and addressing them directly is crucial. It shows that leaders are not only willing to take credit for successes but also willing to learn from their failures. This, in turn, fosters an atmosphere of trust and transparency within the organization. Humility and Approachability Humility is a quality that endears leaders to their followers. In the case of the Dutch Prime Minister, his willingness to perform a humble task like cleaning up a spilled drink made him more relatable and approachable to the public. It showed that he is not distant or disconnected from the daily experiences of ordinary citizens. #leadershipskills #LeadByExample #Accountability #SelfDiscipline #Humility #Resilience #Adaptability #LeadershipLessons #Inspiration #LeadWithActions\n\nWhat an honor to interview Cayman Islands Institute of Professional Accountants Pioneer Award recipient, Dan Scott, OBE, JP, JP during last week's Momentum Conference. Dan retired this year after a 40-year career, most recently serving as Regional Managing Partner for EY. During our fireside chat, Dan shared a variety of variety leadership insights, including: -You're not a leader because you have a title. You're a leader because people follow you. And people follow you because they trust you. -There's a difference between character and reputation. Character is who you are deep within. Reputation is what other people say about you. Eventually, lapses in your character will show up in your reputation. -Ethical failures often start as small mistakes or lapses in judgment that aren't dealt with right away. Leaders need to create an environment where it's okay to admit these mistakes so they can be addressed, rather than feeling the need to cover them up, which typically leads to bigger problems. -To ensure behavior consistent with your organization's values, leaders need to ensure there are clear expectations and training for acting within the values, along with appropriate consequences for not adhering to them. Congratulations to Sheree Ebanks, Cert.Hon., Marilyn Layne, Kevin Morales and the rest of the CIIPA team for another successful annual conference. Special thanks for the opportunity to interview Dan and also to share my presentation, Empowering a Hybrid Workforce: Strategies to Set Your Leaders Up for Success. #leadership #ethics #leadershipdevelopment #keynotespeaker #corporatetrainer #leadershipcoach\n\nI attended an excellent session on positive leadership at Henley Africa earlier this week and at our table we had a discussion about the obsession with immediate results in so many organisations. I remember a number of people I reported to in my life saying to me: You are only as good as your next result Frans, always remember that and make that result at all costs. We can pick up the pieces in the next six months. And it‚Äôs the ‚Äòat all costs‚Äô that becomes the problem. We have all seen organisations reducing the scheduling of people who are crucial for the customer experience to save costs, and it inevitably leads to a reduction in motivation and sales. Another senior manager said to me: Never tell people they are doing well, they will ask for more money and it will cost you your result. ( Another lesson here: while listening is imperative, do not believe everything senior management tells you, always verify, always do your own research and read and read.) Reward people in the best way you can, and move away from rewarding immediate results. And make the work experiences worthwhile with purpose., vision, inspiration and motivation. It is not about the next result, but about the results for the coming decades. It is about the value that is added while making results. It is about shared value. Upliftment of people and communities, thriving people and communities ensure thriving businesses. At times we have to sacrifice an immediate result, because we are investing for numerous good results in the future. Put the ego away for a while and consider the future.\n\nüí°Seeking Help, Ideas, Support: The Power of fresh Perspectives üöÄ On Friday The Regional Directors and Founders of Boardroom Advisors got together in person at the stunning KPMG offices in Reading. We shared our own journeys, wins, challenges and how we can best serve our clients moving forward. It was fantastic to meet everyone in person finally! No matter how experienced or knowledgeable we are (or think we are ü´£) there are times when we need help, fresh ideas, and support. As business owners we are so deeply engrossed in the day-to-day running we often can‚Äôt see the wood for the trees. However, there is immense power in stepping back and inviting a fresh pair of eyes to the table. One of the key requests we receive from our clients recently is for support with a strategy day. To provide the perfect setting to openly discuss challenges, seek advice, and not only tap into the collective wisdom of their senior leaders but also from an experienced Advisor who can support their goals and create a tangible plan for the next 100 days as a minimum. If you would like to have a no obligation chat to discuss how we can arrange and deliver this for your business needs, please send me a message. P.s It‚Äôs not only an insightful, highly beneficial and valuable day but also a whole lot of fun! Huge thank you to John G. Courtney & Kath Dawson, looking forward to the next one!
