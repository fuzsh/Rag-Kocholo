        "text": "The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, one of the darkest chapters in Indian history, occurred on April 13, 1919, in Amritsar. The British Indian Army, under the command of General Reginald Dyer, opened fire on a peaceful gathering of men, women, and children who had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh public garden to protest against the oppressive Rowlatt Act. The act allowed for the arrest and detention of individuals without trial, sparking widespread discontent among Indians. The massacre was a result of a combination of factors, including the British government's fear of growing Indian nationalism and the perceived need to assert control. General Dyer, motivated by a desire to instill fear and maintain British authority, ordered his troops to open fire on the unarmed crowd without any warning. The brutal massacre resulted in the deaths of hundreds and left many more injured. . The impact of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre was profound and far-reaching. It fueled a sense of outrage and resentment among Indians towards British rule, galvanizing the independence movement. The incident also exposed the brutal nature of British colonialism and led to widespread condemnation both in India and around the world. . Today, Jallianwala Bagh stands as a memorial to those who lost their lives in the massacre, serving as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought for India's freedom. The site holds immense historical significance and continues to be a place of remembrance and reflection for people from all walks of life. The massacre remains a poignant reminder of the importance of upholding democratic values, and human rights, and the need to learn from the mistakes of the past. . #JallianwalaBaghMassacre #BritishColonialism #RowlattAct #IndianIndependence #HistoricalTragedy #HumanRights #DemocraticValues #ColonialAtrocities #BritishRaj #RememberingHistory #FreedomStruggle #IndiaAgainstColonialism #MartyrsOfJallianwalaBagh #HistoricalInjustice #LessonsFromThePast #NeverAgain #PeacefulProtest #ColonialOppression #MemorialSite\n\nThis is why I Love BJP! The idol of BJP is Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj. Tamil Nadu BJP President Annamalai having a idol of Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj on his desk proves this. Many of us do not know about the contribution of Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj to India. It is because a deliberate attempt was made by the leftist Liberal gang to confine Shivaji Maharaj to Maharashtra. It is shocking when we see that Shivaji Maharaj is seen as an outsider in parts Karnataka and Andhra whereas Barbaric leaders like Afjhal Khan are praised. Talking about contribution of Shivaji Maharaj he was the one leader who created his own empire withstanding pressure from Islamic sultanates like Mughals and Adilshahi. Shivray created DBT transfer for his masses so that schemes reach directly to people and middlemen do not create anarchy. He created the modern Navy for India and fought against Western powers of Brits and French. He created a 2500 words Shabdkosh to remove Parsi language from official use in India. Did you know Baba is an Parsi word? Many of us call our dad's by this Parsi word. Shivaji Maharaj was the first Hindu King to be coronated according to Hindu rituals after Islamic invaders controlled India for around 800 years. The administration, military, warfare, management and governance of Shivaji Maharaj is a subject of study all across the globe. Such is the idol of BJP and hence I beleive BJP carried the capacity to lead India in a right direction. Just look at Congress, its leadership is busy appeasing a single community and carries different sets of rules in different states. Congress in Kerala is fully leftist. Whereas Congress in Chhattisgarh was socialist. This dismantled form of leadership is what that led India to anarchy and thus downfall of Congress. But BJP with it's robust ideology will continue to rule for decades to come.\n\nTitle: Commemorating Jallianwala Bagh Massacre Introduction: - April 13 marks a solemn day in Indian history, as we remember the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. - This tragic event took place in 1919, when British troops opened fire on unarmed civilians who had gathered at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar to peacefully protest against oppressive British policies. - Today, let's reflect on the significance of this day and pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for India's freedom struggle.

Congress to not attend Ram Temple Pran Pratishtha. Bla-bla-bla...! Is it about the strategic use of God in politics or being spiritual in real sense? Are politicians genuinely driven by faith, or is invoking God a calculated move? On multiple forums people are joining the conversation on how religion becomes a powerful tool in the political arena. Working hard (Karma) with honesty (Dharma) is what God (any name) wants from all of us. While politicians are playing God Card, 90% of Indians are busy with their daily work, exams, job crisis, weather crisis, earning basic comfort for family, protection against crime, EMIs, resolving social disputes, and many more real life-drivers. What are you busy with? #Politics #GodCard #Reflections #PoliticalStrategy üé≠ü§ù\n\nEvery Indian should work on the basis of the spirit of Nation First like our Honorable Prime Minister.r..... Self-interest is not bigger than the policy of Nation First, if we want to see a growing Hindustan then we should work individually without any propaganda. The world is an opportunity for every Hindustani because of our culture and patience and commitment without any selfishness. We should prove during our service period that Hindustani is an exceptional country and Hindu culture is the oldest civilization in the world. Those who are criticizing our Prime Minister should review the anti-Modi competition in the Lok Sabha election, compare Nehru Pandit family, later the family became Gandhi for political gain - Indira Gandhi Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi Rahul Gandhi Priyanka Vadra Gandhi, you should review their scams and India was divided on the basis of religion Then why did Nehru stop Muslims from going to Pakistan during 1947? Because Pakistan was made for Muslims on the basis of religion and Hindustan for every caste except Muslims.\n\nWhile you are sleeping and living a cosy life ,your land and life both belong to the draconian Waqf board. Under the section 3 of the Waqf board act ,1995 states that if Waqf \"thinks\" that the land belongs to the muslim ,then land is the property of Waqf. The Waqf has more than 8.5 lakh acres of land which is equivalent to the entire land area of Punjab which is valued at 2 lakh crore rupees today. All credit goes to the KHAN-GRESS govt. Such was the hatred against Hindus in the heart of CON-GRESS. Such was the irony and hatred towards hindus by the CONMENS were that the land which belongs to Hindus were gifted and protected by laws and given to terrorists. Another act was the Place of Worship act 1992 which was implemented after the regaining of Shri Ram janmbhumi from the terrorist desert cult. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, prohibits the conversion of any place of worship and aims to maintain the religious character of such places as it existed on August 15, 1947. Our previous generation which comprises our father and grandfather didn't pay attention to those distarious things. But we must stop it now. It is do or die situation for the present generation as time is running out . Introspect and act Blitzkrieg. #Bharat #Needdicatatorshiprule #Worshipact #Waqfboard #Draconianlaw #VishnushankarJain #Harishankarjain #GovtofIndia #Abolishwaqfact #Destroyallmadrasas\n\nIf a minority CONgress under UPA1 & UPA2 could introduce such a draconian legislation and a minority CONgrease under PVN Rao could pass irrational and partisan law like Places of Worship Act, what stopped Modiji1 and Modiji2 with full majority to repeal such Acts, which are against the letter and spirit of the Constitution? Enough of blaming CONgrease and ensuring that Modiji delivers on key issues affecting India, than lecturing INDIA and the world. Those who reshare are requested to tag PM, HM and his team, so that they understand feelings of citizens, rather than giving ears to Media Mercenaries. Can't PM hold discussions in ordinary citizens, rather than only with Media personnel? #narendramodiji #pmoindia #amitshah"
