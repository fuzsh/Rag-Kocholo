He through his courage and bravery will always remain as a freedom fighter who tried to suppress the British regime. He is also referred to as ‘Shaheed – I – Azam Sardar Udham Singh’. Sardar Tehal Singh Jammu, father of Udham Singh, was a railway crossing watchman in the village called Upali. After his father’s death, he was taken in by the orphanage called Central Khalsa orphanage Putlighar in Amritsar. There he taught about the Sikh initiatory rights, and there he received the name ‘Udham Singh’.\n\nUdham Singh as a part of the orphanage was serving water to the crowd at Jallianwala Bagh. It was at that time General Dwyer ordered the troops to leave, and he opened fire on the people without giving them a warning.
