        "text": "Parking is readily available in the memorial's parking facility, operated under a concession contract between the National Park Service and Xanterra Travel Collection. A parking ticket entitles a non-commercial vehicle unlimited entry to the memorial for one year from the date of purchase. No reservations are needed to visit the memorial.\n\nSix charging stations for electric vehicles are located on Level Two of the parking facility. A free tire inflation station is available near the exit of Level Four. Bicycle lockers are available on Level One. See a parking attendant for more information about using the lockers.\n\nOvernight parking is not allowed anywhere within the boundaries of Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\n\nThe America the Beautiful â€“ National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Annual Pass, Military Pass - Annual, Military Pass - Lifetime, Senior Pass, Access Pass and Every Kid Outdoors Pass cannot be used for parking fees at Mount Rushmore National Memorial. These passes cover entrance fees but do not cover concession fees such as parking. Mount Rushmore National Memorial does not charge an entrance fee.\n\nHow to Park\n\nUpon arrival you will be directed to the entrance gates. Lanes One, Two and Three are for non-commercial cars and Lane Four is for buses, RVs, trailers, and commercial vehicles. Parking for larger vehicles such as RVs and trailers is very limited. During peak summer season it is best to arrive earlier in the day. Overnight parking is not allowed.\n\nIf you need access to ADA parking or the drop off zones, please use Lane Four. The attendant in this lane can direct you to those areas.\n\nAs you enter lanes One, Two, or Three take a parking ticket to open the gate. If you already have a valid, paid parking ticket, follow the directions on the machine to scan your ticket.\n\nHow to Exit\n\nAfter you pay for your ticket, keep it to use to exit the parking facility. Paid parking tickets that have been validated at the exit gate are valid for one year. In order to use your ticket for parking during that time, you must insert your ticket into the machine at the exit gate. This validates your ticket and opens the gate. Before driving away, take your validated ticket out of the machine.\n\nIf the exit gate is open as you drive up and you do not insert your ticket into the machine, it is not validated. Unvalidated tickets will not allow you to re-enter the parking facility."
