EQL prevents sites from crashing, slows down scammers and delivers a launch that is Run Fair.\n\nWhat does Run Fair mean?\n\nWe believe that everyone should have a fair chance of getting their hands on the products they love, that’s why we partnered with EQL. They’ve built fairness in:\n\nOnly humans can enter draws: Every entry goes through a multi-step security verification process that confirms you are a human.\n\nOne entry per person: Entries are deduplicated against unique identification tags.\n\nLaunches are always secure: Best in class security protocols make sure your information is always safe and secure.\n\nIt should be simple to enter: Once you have a verified EQL account, entering becomes a breeze.\n\nWhen you see the ‘Run Fair’ logo, it’s a fairness certification. It means the technology used and the steps taken to run the launch are of the highest standard.\n\nWhat are the steps required to enter a draw on EQL\n\nGo to an EQL powered draw form.\n\nCreate an EQL account\n\nProvide shipping and payment details\n\nVerify your entry\n\nSubmit\n\nYour entry is now registered in the draw.\n\nAm I charged for entering a draw?\n\nNo. You are only charged if you are successfully selected at the close of the draw.\n\nAm I charged for winning a draw?\n\nIf you are entering a free giveaway, you will not be charged any fees or costs associated to the giveaway, regardless of your selection as a winner or non-winner. If you are a winner, your products will be shipped to you by the retailer free of charge to your specified shipping address.\n\nHow do I know if I’ve won?\n\nYou will be alerted via email after the draw has closed.\n\nWhy do you need my credit card details when I enter?\n\nCredit card details help EQL to confirm that you are a real human. It also allows for fraud checks to be done on your card. It’s a robust security measure so that we can deliver a fair draw for everyone. Providing your credit card details is one of the many important steps that confirms your spot in the draw.\n\nDoes submitting an entry via an EQL form guarantee me the win?\n\nNo. It does however guarantee you an entry into the draw and a fair chance to win.\n\nIf I submit my entry and change my mind later, is there a chance to withdraw?\n\nYes.
