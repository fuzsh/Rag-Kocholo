        "text": "The coincidences here are definitely interesting...\n\nA few months ago, this happened: Waltham Grandfather\n\nBut just like in that post, first the clock, then the story. This grandfather clock is a John Wanamaker, New York. It stands 8 ft 1-3/8 inches tall. The movement is marked B&D Monastery, for which there are a lot of posts on this board and which I have yet to sort through. From what I can tell B&D used other movements, so this is a John Wanamaker retailed clock, with a B&D (retailed or wholesaled) movement and I have yet to uncover the original maker of the movement. I'll let the photos complete the description.\n\nIt seems to be all original, including the key, and the only damage appears to be someone cut off the right side of the right claw foot (I presume to fit in a corner?). I'll post the movement photos in the next post, but now onto the story.\n\nAbout a month ago I saw an ad in the For Free section on CL for a rather grand Grandfather Clock (as you can see above). I responded as soon as I saw it and received this response, \"I have a lot of interested people. Would you like to make an offer?\" I explained prices are all over the place and that they are dropping and that it was pretty far away from me, etc., etc., so I offered $50. I thought that would be the end of it if others were interested.\n\nI was surprised when she responded, \"If you want to pick it up for 50 that's fine.\" Score! It was in New Rochelle, NY which is about 140 miles from me and she wanted to get rid of it that weekend, but she couldn't help move it, so I scrambled to borrow a van, find someone willing to help for 5 or so hours, and make arrangements to pick it up.\n\nAbout an hour before leaving to pick it up, I got this response, \"Hi so sorry to waste your time but a family member has expressed interest in the clock so I'm going to give it to them. Thanks for the info about it.\" While I raged a little inside, I thought I would be civil and offered recommendations for her relative including that she should definitely seek advice here. End of story? (As you can tell from the photos above, no it wasn't...)\n\nEarlier this week, I received this, \"Hi so it turns out my aunt does not want the grandfather clock. Would you still be interested in buying it?\" Of course I would! Once again, I scrambled to make the arrangements and this time the clock is now in my living room waiting for a thorough cleaning and check up and finding space (If I move this clock here, and that one there, I think I can squeeze it in right here - prefect! Anybody else been in that situation?).\n\nSo, the coincidences are pretty amazing to me.\n\nBoth clocks on CL about 140 miles from my home, but amazingly within 5 miles of each other.\n\nBoth high quality, 1920s era grandfather clocks.\n\nBoth sellers initially found other \"buyers.\"\n\nBoth sellers came back to me after their original deals fell through.\n\nBoth clocks are now in my living room.\n\nTom\n\nHa, I though I posted this, but it was still in the draft window...\n\nHere are some photos of the movement.\n\nView attachment 549430 View attachment 549431 View attachment 549432 View attachment 549433 View attachment 549435 View attachment 549434\n\nI presume the E plate can help with dating? I was hoping to find a map to buried treasure or something cool under the E plate, but just a smudge. The hooks seem odd - two on one chain closed, two on one chain open and an oddball hook on the third. The chime chain is a little shorter, so I think someone had messed with them.\n\nI'm off to read the B&D posts, but if you have anything to offer based on what you see, please do. It does need a suspension spring, but the slot in the bridge is very narrow compared to my other grandfather clocks.\n\nTom\n\nTom,\n\nThe B&D Monastery TM was registered in 1909, so your clock most likely dates after that date.\n\nAs you probably know, Wanamaker was a Philadelphia retailer. When they opened operations in NYC (I do not know) could also provide a clue as to the vintage of your clock.\n\nThe plate that you removed sometimes includes the TM of the movement maker, but does not on your clock.\n\nB&D contracted with Baeuerle of Germany for many of their movements and I suspect your movement was made by Baeuerle.\n\nRegards."
