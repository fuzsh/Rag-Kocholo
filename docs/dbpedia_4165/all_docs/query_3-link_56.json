The video, now viral with more than 20 million views, has also shot still photographs of the phenomenon. In his post, he added that they had to stay outdoors in stormy conditions for more than three hours to capture the perfect shot. Read less\n\nIn a near-impossible feat, a stunning scene was captured when the 100 ft statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro was recently hit by lightning. It was captured during a flash storm in Brazil. If the viral pictures are to go by, the bolt of flash struck the head of the statue, which seemed to turn the sculpture into a godly figure.\n\nRead more: Breathtaking colossal statues across the world\n\nThe stunning video was captured by photographer Fernando Braga, which has stunned the internet like no other. The video, now viral with more than 20 million views, has also shot still photographs of the phenomenon. In his post, he added that they had to stay outdoors in stormy conditions for more than three hours to capture the perfect shot.\n\nHe added that responding to requests, he decided to prepare a brief timelapse of the lightning that hit Christ the Redeemer, with just over 500 processed photos, including changing the lens. If reports are to go by, the structure was hit by lightning twice before, in two decades, in 2008 and 2014.\n\nAs per the records, when the statue was hit for the first time, it remained unscathed. In 2014, the thumb of Christ was, however, damaged by the strike, which was later repaired. Records suggest that this time too, the statue, thankfully, seems to have suffered no damage at all. It's one of the biggest cultural icons in the world, and is that one landmark that is synonymous with Rio. A trip to this beautiful city is deemed incomplete unless you make a trip to the statue as well.\n\nThis iconic statue is the famous landmark of Brazil, and is the largest stone-work of Jesus that has ever been built, which stands more than 2,000 ft above Rio de Janeiro on top of the Corcovado Hill. Built in 1931, the statue has become a national symbol for Brazil. It weighs 635 metric tonnes, is 98 ft tall and the arms stretch to 92 ft. It is also a cultural icon and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nThe attraction is also wildly popular in India, with a number of blockbuster movies shot here. If you are planning to visit Rio de Janeiro, April to June and September to late November are the best times to do so. It'll be less crowded.\n\nend of article\n\nAlso Read"
