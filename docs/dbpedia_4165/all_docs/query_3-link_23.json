        "text": "I would have thought that actually it is quite the contrary. Some places are far more likely to get hit by lightning than others, and repeatedly. That is why tall buildings have lightning conductors.\n\nMultiple lightning strikes on the CN tower - source Richard Gottardo (https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardgottardo/7649012416/).\n\nThere is no scientific law that says that and it's definitely false.\n\nThere are two reasons why it's unlikely to see lightening strike the same place twice:\n\n1) The earth is really big, and lightening strikes will occur pretty randomly.\n\n2) Lightening (cloud to ground or vice versa) occurs after there's a charge buildup between a point in the sky and a point on the ground. Lightening neutralizes that charge differential, so the process of charge buildup would have to start over from scratch once an area has been struck. This would only make striking twice in the same spot less likely during the same storm."
