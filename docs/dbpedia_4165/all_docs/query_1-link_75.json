        "text": "As the world reeled with the news that Pope Benedict XVI was to resign, another bolt from the blue was to hit the Vatican within hours. This time quite literally.\n\nA bolt of lightning - surely not a message from above - was photographed striking the lightning rod on the top St Peter's Basilica, not by one, but two photographers. Or, indeed, maybe more?\n\nOne of those was photographer Alessandro Di Meo, external, who was in the area following the breaking news of the resignation. When the first bolt struck, he immediately moved to a position where he would be able to record another strike. It was, he says, a race against time but also against misfortune.\n\n\"While I was cleaning the lens from raindrops a first lightning bolt hit the dome and I could not help but watch,\" he says.\n\n\"Bad luck. However it was not enough to discourage me, so I went on to persevere in an attempt to try to make the picture as well as I had imagined. I tried again several times until a bolt of lightning struck the cupola just as I was taking the shot.\"\n\nFor those not aware, to take a photograph of lightning you must open the shutter and hope - or perhaps pray. You can't wait until you see a flash and press the shutter release, as you will, of course, have missed the event.\n\nThe trick is to frame the shot and set the camera for a long exposure, then any bolts that appear in the frame will be captured in all their glory.\n\nDi Meo's camera was in fact balanced on a fence to ensure it did not move during the long exposure, though no doubt a tripod would have been used had one been available. He set his camera for an exposure time of eight seconds, at f/9 aperture and 50 ISO.\n\n\"Of course, the camera was set to manual and I mounted a wide angle lens that allowed me to include the whole church in the frame,\" he says."
