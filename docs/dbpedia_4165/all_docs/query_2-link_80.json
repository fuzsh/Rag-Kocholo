        "text": "The City of Buffalo is putting a temporary halt on imposing amusement license fees on local music clubs.\n\nMayor Byron W. Brown has directed the city’s Department of Permit and Inspection Services and the Law Department to review the current statute pertaining to the collection of the fees.\n\n“The collection of Amusement License fees is being temporarily paused,” the city said Wednesday in a letter to business owners. “We have reviewed the ordinance and are looking to make adjustments. In the coming weeks, the city will work with the Common Council to resolve any issues.”\n\nThe pause comes on the heels of a July 31 report from Investigative Post about the Brown administration using an obscure law to impose fees on music clubs and other entertainment venues for every ticketed event they produce. That includes Babeville, Town Ballroom and Sportsmen’s Tavern.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe Common Council this week approved about $24 million in federal pandemic relief funding for affordable housing projects, cultural institutions, homeowners and health equity initiatives.\n\nThe schedule of fees was based on the price of admission. A venue would be assessed a fee of $55 to host an event with a ticket that costs $25 or less, according to the Investigative Post. An event that costs $100 or more to attend would have a fee of $350.\n\nThe fees could add tens of thousands of dollars to the operating costs of venues like Babeville, RiverWorks, Iron Works and Town Ballroom, according to the Investigative Post.\n\nThe move to collect entertainment fees comes at a time when a fiscal crisis is looming for Buffalo, the city comptroller, Council members and the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority have warned.\n\nIn less than 12 months, the city will face a budget gap of at least $41 million, but it could be more than $55 million. Brown himself has acknowledged, “we’ve got some storm clouds on the horizon, fiscally.”\n\nNext year, the city could be short about $58 million, including $14.9 million in cash reserves and $25.8 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds that must be obligated by the end of the year. There’s $11 million in casino revenue that is uncertain; about $4 million in the hotel occupancy tax the State Legislature declined to approve; and about $2 million in added fees and fines that the city comptroller called “speculative.”\n\nBy Deidre Williams\n\nNews Staff Reporter\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nDeidre Williams\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
