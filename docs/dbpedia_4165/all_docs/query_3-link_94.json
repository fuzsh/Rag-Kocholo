        "text": "Thirty-thousand feet — more than twice the height of Mount Whitney. That’s how high fire-induced clouds, known as pyrocumulus, are rising into the sky above the massive Park Fire in Northern California.\n\nLarge rotating columns of smoke, ash and embers continue to spin up along the edges of the blaze. In some cases, tornado-like behavior was observed.\n\nTwo weeks after it began, California’s fourth-largest wildfire on record continues to create its own weather as it burns through Tehama and Butte counties. This extreme fire behavior challenges firefighters and threatens communities, burning rapidly through rugged mountain terrain.\n\nMassive smoke plumes\n\nBurning at hundreds — if not thousands — of degrees, wildfires dramatically alter meteorology. Wildfire heat can induce billowing clouds capable of producing lightning on a day where skies would otherwise be clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIntense heat rises vertically from a wildfire. This rising air, a necessary ingredient for cloud formation, cools and condenses as it rises, turning invisible water vapor into visible cloud droplets. In the presence of sufficient atmospheric moisture, cauliflower-looking cumulus clouds can form from this rising motion. A fire-induced cumulus cloud is referred to as a pyrocumulus.\n\nPyrocumulus clouds create a feedback loop of extreme fire activity. By ingesting air into a strong upward current, the fire receives additional oxygen, which further raises the temperature of the fire, causing more rising motion.\n\n“In this case, the fire heating is feeding its own circulation,” said David Peterson, a meteorologist with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.\n\nUpdrafts loft hot embers and ash thousands of feet into the air before they fall downwind, and those embers can ignite new blazes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIn extreme cases, even larger pyrocumulonimbus clouds can form, producing thunderstorms and posing a threat for new lightning-sparked fires.\n\nAlthough pyrocumulonimbus have yet to occur from the Park Fire, pyrocumulus clouds alone are dangerous. In the early stages of the Park Fire, billowing smoke and flames associated with a pyrocumulus blocked the only route out of Cohasset, a mountain community in Butte County.\n\nPyrocumulus are “very unpredictable in terms of winds, which makes the firefighting environment hazardous and if you’re trying to evacuate people,” Peterson said. “Plus, if it’s a pyrocumulonimbus, you have this very deep cloud that’s filled with smoke, so it’s very dark. If you’re underneath it, you can have lightning. … It’s just a scary environment if you’re on the ground near one.”\n\nWestern North America is the global hot spot for pyrocumulus clouds, according to Peterson’s research team, which has cataloged more than a decade’s worth of data. California’s peak pyrocumulus season is July through September, according to Peterson, when fire activity intersects with monsoon moisture intrusions and other optimal weather patterns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFire tornadoes\n\nPyrocumulus and pyrocumulonimbus clouds can present another hazard: fire tornadoes.\n\nOn the second day of the Park Fire, July 25, a large smoke plume began to rotate near Highway 32 in Butte County. Observers on the ground noted strong wind gusts and erratic fire behavior, indicating a fire tornado may have been shielded by the smoke. Numerous wildfire meteorology experts told the Chronicle a fire tornado was probably embedded in the smoky rotation.\n\nThis extreme fire weather contributed to 150,000 acres of fire growth in 24 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNearly two weeks later, additional large rotating columns of smoke were visible as the fire approached Mineral (Tehama County) on Tuesday.\n\nAnd where there is smoke, there is fire. These rotating plumes of fire and smoke can deposit embers and ash downwind, spreading the fire even faster.\n\n“People start to get mesmerized by the rotation, and before you know it, the spot fires are thrown a pretty good distance,” said Ryan Walbrun, incident meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “The safety action by the command staff is to not insert (firefighters) into the area because it’s simply too dangerous.”\n\nThe Park Fire isn’t the first California blaze to produce a fire tornado. In 2018, the Carr Fire north of Redding produced a monster fire vortex. A large fire whirl was also observed in the 2021 Dixie Fire, which burned nearly 1 million acres to the east of the Park Fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nExtreme fire weather is becoming more common in California, and throughout the world, in a hotter climate. Rising temperatures not only dry out fuels, but intensify plume-driven wildfires.\n\nPeterson’s team will begin a field campaign to study pyrocumulonimbus clouds in 2026, flying aircraft above fires and clouds to investigate why some blazes produce pyrocumulonimbus while others do not. Proposed research sites include Palmdale (Los Angeles County); Boise, Idaho; and Cold Lake in Alberta."
