        "text": "There’s nothing more romantic than falling in love while chasing thunderstorms. At least, that’s what I told myself while I was writing LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE. Now all I had to do was figure out how to get my main characters together using said thunderstorms.\n\nI knew my heroine, Kate, was going to be a large animal vet. And at first my hero, Nathan, was that quintessential rancher/cowboy archetype. Easy enough, I thought. They can bond over ranch stuff and the thunderstorms will come in later. Only, I wasn’t in love with this characterization for my hero. Nathan felt like he came from a world that was a little unpredictable and filled with adventure. But what kind of adventure would bring him to Hatchet Lake and put him on Kate’s radar? I had no idea.\n\nAs I was brainstorming this vital piece of my outline, the world was mid-pandemic. At the time, I was living on the East Coast and working as a military nurse. Every moment of my day was consumed by Covid-19. When I was able to step away from that hectic world, I really wanted to get away. So, I started driving to remote places along the coast—a small stretch of beach, a quiet park, an abandoned hiking trail. This is when I began taking photos. I’d never considered myself a photographer before, but here I was, scouring Instagram to find my next photo spot. What started as a way to put some distance between myself and the pandemic soon sparked a genuine love for photography.\n\nDrawing from my own experience, I came to the conclusion that Nathan was going to be a photographer. More specifically, a nature photographer. I wanted him to be at home outdoors, chasing down different landscapes and wildlife. I also wanted Kate to fall in love with Nathan while watching him pursue his passion. Finally, this is where the thunderstorms came in. I gave Nathan some photography buddies, a cool green Volkswagen van, and set up a summer of storm chasing to capture the perfect photo.\n\nNow, besides my intense love of the movie Twister, I didn’t have a lot of personal experience with storm chasing. However, when I was a kid, my dad used to pack my siblings and I into the car in the summer and we would chase down the hot-air balloons that used to fly over our house. Though it wasn’t a storm, the idea of piling into a vehicle at a moment’s notice to set out on an adventure to an unknown destination was familiar. I understood the rowdiness and excitement and exhilaration. The rest I filled in with proper research, using my good friend Google and going on the occasional YouTube deep-dive, studying videos of actual storm chasers.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nI always find that my best stories are an amalgamation of research and lived experience, and for LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE, I got to build off my actual experience going from newbie to amateur photographer extraordinaire. One of my favorite things about being a writer is that (with all the research we do), you sort of become a jack-of-all-trades. So, if anyone’s looking for me, I’ll be adding storm-chasing, camera-wielding ranch hand to my résumé.\n\nAbout LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE\n\nRecently single, livestock vet Kate Cardiff is tired of risking her heart. So when an emergency calls her home to her family’s struggling ranch, Kate is ready to help—and definitely not looking for love. It’s dislike at first sight when she meets temporary ranch hand and storm-chasing photographer Nathan Prescott. He says he can win her over, but Nathan lives in the moment, not for the future. If Kate opens her heart to someone who lives on the edge, will taking the risk lead to another heartbreak…or a new beginning?"
