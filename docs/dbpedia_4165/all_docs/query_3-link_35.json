        "text": "In the previous article I looked at the different ways you can set your camera up to capture a lightning strike. In this article I'll cover some more tips on how to get great lightning photos.\n\nKa-boom (lightning) by Leszek.Leszczynski on flickr (licensed CC-BY)\n\nCamera power\n\nMost of the methods used for photographing lightning (other than the Lightning Trigger) use a lot of energy. So it is a good idea to make sure you have enough power for your camera.\n\nIf you're working indoors, you might consider connecting your camera to the mains power (using the appropriate adapter). But this could be rather risky as a power surge caused by a lightning strike could then fry your camera. Even if you have good surge protection in place, it likely still won't protect against a direct lightning strike on or near your house.\n\nIf you're working outdoors, make sure you bring a spare battery. If you're planning on setting a camera up outdoors and then leaving it to photograph the storm while you retreat to safety, then a battery grip would be a good idea.\n\nBattery grips are available for most DSLRs and some other interchangeable lens cameras. They allow the camera to run on two batteries instead of one, so the camera will last twice as long until the battery runs out."
