Things for which another community would cast you into an ignominious outer social darkness are regarded with amused tolerance in the film colony. But there are things that Holly- wood will never forgive so long as a camera turns within her city limits. What are these lapses, these indiscretions, these sins? And who are the sinners? Helen Louise Walker knows and she will tell you in next month's Picture Play. She names names, she gives facts, she tells the truth amusingly, wittily, and adds one more brilliant article to Picture Play's credit — and the enjoy- ment of its readers.

STREET & SMITH PUBLICATIONS, INC., 79 7th AVE., NEW YORK, N. Y. What Repeal of Prohibition Will Mean to the Screen There'll be a change in pictures all right. More especially, there'll be a change in manners, mor- als, and in — yes — drink- ing! In dressing, too. Women's clothes will be more formal, more ele- gant, and more men will wear tails when they are seen with girls at night. With cocktails no longer illegal, their use will be freer in films and more will be required for the heroine to become ex- hilarated, desperate, un- inhibited. Then, too, hulking he-men like Wal- lace Beery no longer will get tipsy on a single swig, as he did in \"Tugboat Annie.\" James Roy Fuller hu- morously describes what the New Year will bring in the first flush of repeal of the Eighteenth Amend- ment.

AM I just blindly, stupidly prejudiced isc I refuse to believe such a lot if silly accusations against Joan Crawford? I don't think so. I know our Joan, and am willing to con- cede that she has made her share of mis- takes. J Jut why should we break faith with her for being as human as we ourselves are? Why expect perfection — for that mat- ter, why want it? Unless, of course, we are prepared to live up to it ourselves, and mostly we aren't, you know. No preach- ing, I mean it. It didn't take twenty-nine years of living to find out about that. I'm honestly sorry about Joan and Doug. Not critical — just sorry. No one has the right to criticize when he doesn't really know, and how can any of us be sure of anything so entirely personal? Why should we dare condemn where we can't possibly fully understand? Two splendid kids torn apart for some reason it hasn't been given us to compre- hend. Wounds, of course, and yet isn't there something rather fine about a pair of kids who have the strength and the vision to accept the hurt now, rather than lose precious memories both cherish? Only Joan herself can ever shake our faith in her, and even she'd find it dis- heartening business. We've seen, those of us who really care, much too far beneath the surface, and after all, it's the things we find deep inside folks that really matter. We'd be discouragingly hard to convince that our Joan is anything less than we know her to be. Anne DeLacy. 833 West Seventeenth Street, Des Moines, Iowa. Gable Is Not Brutal. THE Gable letters are always the most interesting outbreaks in this depart- ment. Though it may seem superfluous, I would like to sum up what I think of Clark, having seen all his pictures during the past two years. Clark has been called an abysmal brute whose only appeal is to our baser instincts. This is a fallacy. In only one picture did I see him brutalize a woman, and then only to slap her with his open hand. Any frog- eyed juvenile could be taught to sock his leading lady, but does any one suppose this would change him into a Gable? Several fans with nothing better to do have criticized the Gable features. Al- though I do not deem him handsome, ac- cording to matinee-idol standards, his forceful personality more than offsets any defects that may be evident. If you crave men with dreamy eyes, chiseled features, md Marcelled ringlets, that's your privilege. As for me, I don't go to the theater just to look at pretty faces. The same critics find fault because Clark has dimples. Who ever heard of dimples being a physical defect? Accusation No. 6,479— \"Gable is a poor actor.\" And yet this \"poor actor\" has been cast opposite Greta Garbo, Helen Hayes, Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Constance Bennett, Carol Lom- bard, and Marion Davies. Hither Gable is a darn good actor or the M.-G.-M. casting director should be taken before a firing squad and put out of his misery. Frank Tully. 20 New Street, Danbury, Connecticut. Ripping! Hover Your 'Eads, Dehsay. READING \" V B.'s\" Utter in \"What the Fans Think,\" I felt I could restrain If no longer. I have been living in America only one year and the first picture I saw, a picture so truly English that 1 believed myself home again, was Our Open Forum \"To-day We Live.\" It is childishly absurd for Americans to send in elaborate crit- icisms of the dialogue and mannerism- of the actors, protesting that it is not really English. My dear American friends, how arc you in a position to pass judgment? Hadn't you better let some one who actu- ally knows do the condemning or praising, some Englishman or woman perhaps? Let me say only this : The acting was so typically English that I could hardly be- lieve the actors were Americans. You say the love-making was wooden, but then Englishmen always have been known to have self-control, a quality that our Amer- ican cousins know practically nothing of. Vn Englishman does not go temporarily insane when in love, and by the same token, the heat of his passion does not dwindle down to zero shortly after marriage. An Englishman, in or out of love, is calm, cool, and phlegmatic ! — and if you'll be kind enough to compare the rate of divorces in America and in England, I think you'll find the latter's rate appreci- ably smaller. So maybe being level-headed and deliberate is somewhat better than be- ing blazingly unrestrained, after all. And as to the dialogue being exagger- ated : If you think an Englishman uses three words when two and a half will suf- fice, just think again, and the answer is he doesn't. I hope I have made it quite clear that an Englishwoman seeing \"To-day We Live\" thought it was perfect — what do you say to that, my faultfinding friend? Jane Carlyle. 19 Newcomb Boulevard, New Orleans, Louisiana. Up and At Her, Dugald! IT seems to me that American fans dislike very much the criticism of stars by fans of other countries. In September Picture Play, Beaulah M. Klink waxes strong and slams rather hard at Dugald McAlpine, the Scotsman, for what he had to say about Buddy Rogers. Everv one has a right to his own likes and dislikes. Mr. McAlpine doesn't like Buddy Rogers — O. K. ! Neither do I, for that matter, and I've seen him on both the stage and the screen. I just can't like Buddy, but it's not his fault if I prefer Fredric March, Leslie Howard, Clive Brook, and George Arliss. I really think Miss Klink could have expressed herself less insultingly to Mr. McAlpine. Bear in mind, young lady, that some of your best talent on the screen and stage came from foreign countries, and more than a few have come from Scotland, England, and Ireland, so why shouldn't we criticize ? Come on, Dugald, let's hear some more of your likes and dislikes. I know if you are a true Scot you won't take Miss Klink's slams sitting down. Get up and show 'em, boy, what a Scotsman can really do. Effie L. McCarron. 204 W. Franklin Street, Richmond, Virginia. When Clara Went to Europe. EMILY C. BURKE of Milan, Italy, finds fault with Clara Bow for finding fault witli Europe. I read the diary which Miss Burke refers to, and really can't see that Miss Bow said anything so dreadful about Europe in her diary. On the contrary, she said she enjoyed her European trip very much, that what she saw of that country was nice and even said she hoped to go back again for another trip. Of course, there may have been some things Miss Bow failed to appreciate about Europe, jusl as some foreigners fail to ap- preciate parts of America. Miss Bow de- serves credit for putting down her impres- sions a- she felt them — truthfully, and not gushing over everything and everybody as e hypocrites are inclined to do. If any one has a right to be sore, it's we Americans. How many foreigners come over here to visit and make scathing re- marks? What about George Bernard Shaw? What has America ever done to him to deserve the insults and slights which he saw fit to shower upon this country? But no, he L called wonderful, a genius ! Rah ! He gives me the impression of just being a very self-satisfied old man and one extremely hard to get along with. But to get back to Miss Bow. I give her credit for being frank and sincere. If she did fail to appreciate some of the moth- eaten glories of Europe, at least, she wasn't afraid to say so. Clara isn't one of those who say one thing and think another. Irene Hef. Buffalo, New York. Abused Babes in the Wood. AFTER reading a slam at a grand per- son and actress like Joan Crawford, such as the one delivered by Dorothy Rogers, I must try my hand. As if that weren't enough, I turn the pages and behold : Miss Crawford is again criticized by Judith Field because she sliced her age to match her husband's. \"And he is only twenty-three, you know,\" says Miss Field. Indeed ! Why shouldn't Joan keep Doug from making her his grandaunt? And who told Miss Field Douglas was only twenty-three? When I was a child in Brooklyn I saw Doug several times when he visited the old Vitagraph studic with his mother. He was at least my age then and certainly looked a great deal older, and I reach twenty-six in a few weeks. Don't misunderstand me — I like Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. He's one of my favorites. But I don't think he compares in character and sincerity to Joan. What qualifies Dorothy Rogers to pass judgment on the cause of a divorce? Read- ing tabloids? Then she must have read more muddy stories about Doug than Joan. I did. Marie Kroneis. 139-06 Thirty-fourth Road, Flushing, L. I., New York. Soviet Cheers Picture Play. FOR about seven years I had been lucky enough to read Picture Play, and then, by a deal of fate, I was deprived of that privilege for two long years. Recently, however, a generous soul sent me the July number as a gift. Imagine seeing the first issue of my favorite magazine in two years ! I was thrilled and startled at once by the considerable changes that have taken place since I saw it last. It has improved in appearance and contents. It has beauty and intelligence, every inch of it, from the cover painting to the fashion plates. Oscar Greiner's Lilian Bond cover is much su- perior as a painting to many of the former covers, in my opinion. The Greta Garbo article by Rakel Erik- son lacks any of the usual gossip and super ficialities. The art gallery is a gorgeous improvement over what it was two years ago. As to \"What the Fans Think,\" it is more interesting and more intelligent, and Norbert Lusk's sound and expert criticism i- undoubtedly Picture Play's special fea- ture. I hope Picture Play continues its tri- umphant march to perfection, striving as it does for truth and independence of opin- ion, avoiding ignorance and average- mindedness in its pages, whether these qualities are expressed by professional writ ers or the fans themselves.

Released thru UNITED ARTISTS ■ c^*as« WHAT THE FANS THINK An actor who played opposite Elissa Landi says her kisses are the real thing, not mere chilling imprints as a fan surmised. Testimonial to Landi's Kisses. THOUGHT I might send in a little note to agree with V. Witt, who would like to push off a cliff the wisecracker who said, \"If Elissa Landi were to kiss an Es- kimo, the Eskimo would die of pneumonia.\" This letter isn't about me, but it might be well to add that I am a screen player, and at the moment am shining brightly. I have played opposite Miss Landi, and rind her one of the brightest and most inter- esting persons 1 have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Miss Landi claims she uses charm, not sex appeal. Well, if it's charm she uses, I'm for it. People who class her as cold and uppish have the nerve to compare her with cer- tain oilier players, such as one Mexi- can whirlwind who shouts herself hoarse at a boxing match while even Mae West sits sedately by. As for the Eskimo crack, T dis- tinctly remember kissing Miss Landi when I played opposite her. I am no! an Eskimo, and 1 most certainly was not afflicted with pneumonia. In my opinion, if Hollywood had more charm and less sex appeal the movies would be better off. A Player. I lollvwood, C ali fornia. Our Wandering Heroines. I\" WISH to ask all the fans to join in tribute to a great actress and grand person who recently passed on to her reward — Louise Closser Hale. The death of this brilliant woman is an irretrievable loss to the stage and screen. And now a complaint : The cinema has become too self-consciously unmoral for words. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Feminine stars vie with one another to see who can depict the most depraved character. This craze, I believe, started with Garbo. Norma Shearer followed in the silent Swede's steps, and Saucer-eyes Crawford was next. Now just try to see a movie without at least one loose woman in it ! I wouldn't want a parade of too, too sweetly good heroines. Surely there is a happy medium. These heroines invariably come to an unjust reward in the hnal fade-out — in the arms of some forthright young man, the possessor of his undying love and good name. All this with the movie houses full of impressionable young fans. I suppose I'll be called old-fashioned and narrow-minded for ex- pressing these view's. It's smart nowadays to read the rawest books and see the most risque plays, so, of course, my wee small voice will be lost in the shuffle. If only Norma Shearer would make another picture like \"Smilin' Through\" ! It was the most exquisite thing done since movies began. I don't think any one could see it and come away not loving Miss Shearer. Give us more pictures like \"A Lady's Profession\" and \"Elmer the Great.\" Give us fewer pictures like \"To-day We Live,\" all Jean Har- low pictures, and, fgoshsakes, throw all those animal cartoons in the junk pile. Diana Brennan. Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Garbo's First Real Rival. WHAT an actress is Katharine Hep- burn ! In my opinion she is the greatest personality the screen has ever known. Her amazing performance in \"A Bill of Divorcement\" brought her instant acclaim, and it is no wonder that thou- sands of moviegoers im- mediately became Hep- burn-conscious. Her magnetic person- ality, her superb poise, her originality and ver- satility, make her the out- standing screen player to-day. Her performance in \"Christopher Strong\" was again sparkling, full of variety, and keenh, alive with remarkable tal- ent. A splendid cast supported her. but again Miss 1 lepburn stood out and overshadowed all the other pla\\ ers.

Then, too, she is exultant because Gene Raymond is her leading man and the picture features the famous Teatro dei Piccoli, a company of twenty-eight puppeteers and eight hundred marionettes from Italy. They're great! 12 Adelina Patti's glamour, lavish- ness and tendency to acquire husbands are reincarnated in Gloria Swanson. And Fredric March has many of Edwin Booth's characteristics. AMONG tlic actors and actresses of Hollywood one occasionally finds an artist who reminds one of an outstanding genius of the past. The similarity may be a matter of appearance, temperament, or talent. In rare instances it springs from a combination of these qualities. Comparing the characteristics of one's favorites with the glamorous people whose names have gone into the annals of the past is a pleasant pastime. So with winter upon us let's get together, preferably before an open fire — some fudge and buttered popcorn will also lie ac- ceptable— and figure out who resembles who. and why. US By Madel i ne Glass Heir to Booth's Mantle. When I told Fredric A I arch that he had many of Edwin Booth's char- acteristics, he expressed his appreciation of the compliment and, after a moment's hesitation, added. \"I have been told that before.\" If similarity of tem- perament, dramatic tech- nique, and personal ap- pearance proves anything it proves that March is the Booth of the screen. The comparison becomes increasingly apt with the rich unfolding of the March talents. If this young fellow doesn't watch out he is likely to develop into an acting genius. Edwin Booth was on the stage for more than forty years. According to his biographers, he was a friendly, charitable, mettlesome man, thought- ful of his parents and having simple but refined tastes. For all his glow- ing talent and brilliantly faceted life, he never abandoned the home-and- fireside mode of living except when necessity re- quired. Like his par- ents, he was more than ordinarily religious. This description fits March like the proverbial glove. Booth, who was born during a meteor shower and who died during a violent electrical storm, had a marked capacity for high romance and constancy. This is also true of March, whose delightful love scenes reveal the gay, exalted emotionalism of a civilized romantic. Booth was paternally inclined and displayed great devotion to his daughter and grandchildren. The Marches, having no child of their own. recently adopted a baby girl. Originally of a cheerful disposition, Booth's life was saddened by numerous tragedies, the mosl shocking hav- ing been, of course, the assassination of Lincoln by his brother. 13 TSELF Some of the dazzling giants of the past live again in our screen stars. Do you agree in awarding Fredric March the mantle of Edwin Booth and John Gilbert the Byron temperament? So far the sable cloak of sorrow has infolded Fredric March but once — t he death of his mother. At that time he was engaged on a picture and for ten days studio conditions compelled him to work while in the East the funeral was delayed awaiting his arrival. Although March is more robust of build, and his handsome face- lacks Booth's suggestion of melancholia, the re- semblance is noticeable. Add to this the similarity of character and tem- perament and it appears that the great Thespian's mantle belongs to Para- mount's pride and joy. A Screen Prima Donna. Gloria Swanson is the Adelina Patti of the screen. Although Miss Swanson's singing voice can scarcely be compared to that of the nineteenth- century diva, her acting ability is much greater, so their respective artis- tic merits -are about equal. Here the resemblance is largely that of tem- perament and character. Adelina Patti was energetic, ambitious, ex- travagant, and exces- sively fond of luxury. She knew her worth and demanded it in coin of the realm. So concerned was she over money that her salary, from $5,000 to $8,000 per perform- ance, had to he paid in advance or she would not set foot on the stage. No king ever traveled in greater state than she. Her private drawing-room car was said to have cost well over $50,000. Does not this lavishness remind you of the sum; Gloria? Recall her splendid homes, her lavish clothes, her salary demands, her luxurious traveling accommodations, and her glittering entertainments, and it is obvious that she is not exactly an exponent of the simple life. [Continued on pag< Lord Byron, the fatally romantic poet, set the pace for John Gilbert, and Jeanne Eagels in- herited the golden voice of Sarah Bernhardt. 14 UP f rom By Evelyn Williams Gwili Andre was a Powers model before she reached the movies. After posing on several ad jobs for Mr. Powers, she came to the attention of beauty-mad producers. \"Before I let you ask a lot of questions about the players I knew,\" Mr. Powers said, \"I want to tell you an interesting story about one star I never met — Mae West. \"When Mae started to produce her own plays she was pretty broke, but she kept it hidden from Broadway. She knew that she Helen Twelvetrees posing for a story illustration- \"Jerry grabbed me and tried to turn me away from him. 'Choose between us forever,' he sobbed.\" THE telephone rang in the office of the John Robert Powers model agency in New York City. \"I'd like to speak to Mr. Powers, please,'' requested a feminine voice — my voice. \"This is Mr. Powers talk- ing,\" said a voice in answer. \"Is this,\" I asked gently, oh, so gently, \"the Mr. Powers who knew Fredric March, Barbara Stanwyck, Mae Clarke, Anita Page, Constance Cummings, Anita Louise, Tom Brown, and a lot of other stars be- fore they went into movies?\" 'Acs, indeed,\" said Mr. Powers heartily, \"and if you come up here while I'm in the mood I'll tell you about them, and I'll show you pic- tures that will make you doubt your own eyes. I say while I'm in the mood, because last week I turned down interviewers from two tabloids and a magazine because 1 wasn't in the mood to talk.\" Now it is not so difficult to find persons who knew one star be fori' fame. But to find a man who knew them by the dozen was like coming across a gold mine with an inexhaustible lode. For Mr. Powers not only knew the players before they became famous; he also advised and encouraged them so that their work led to the studios. Mr. Powers is a mild-mannered little man whose opinion on beaut)', both feminine and masculine, is val- ued by artists, photographers, and stage producers. When they want a handsome man or a beautiful girl they call up \"John R.\" and put in an order, just as you would order at a bookstore. And John R. never fails them, for be has several thousand models to choose from. Photo by Feder And here is 'he heroic Fredric March ustrating how he got the job by putting on a starched collar.

His name was Lyons Wickland, and when I say he looked Society with a capital S, I mean that he looked as though his name should hi' Vanderbih or Astor. \"Lyons had plenty of work as a model.\" said Powers. \"But he was ambitious. So when he heard that Mae had a part for his type he walked right into it. \"And Mae liked him from the time she hired him. She recognized that he was a pretty line type of man 15 SMILING ADS How several stars of to-day got their start dramatizing the whitening power of toothpaste and the charm of sheer stockings. and a sincere friend. It wasn't a romance, you under- stand. They were just swell friends. He knew she wasn't rolling in money because one day she asked for a loan so small that it surprised him. She admitted to him how things were, and he admired her inure than ever because of the way she was outsmarting the smart boys on Broadway. \"When she got the loan from Lyons, Mae said, 'I'll never forget this. If I ever get famous, I'll remember you.' Of course, Lyons thought she was a grand per- son to say that, but he never took it seriously. When Mae was famous and came back to New York, Lyons didn't even call her up. He felt that she was a star and he was not, and it would hardly be fair to force her to re- member him. Helen Vinson's blond beauty is unrecognizable in this brunette dress model. Plmin hv Feder |.j Barbara Stanwyck liked to pose for illustrations but hated the thought of acting. The man with her is the late Thomas Holding after his fame in early movies. \"But, there's one thing aboul Mae Wesl that is ad- mirable.\" And Powers, who knows hi^ Broadway, rel- ished telling this story. \"She doesn't say anything un- less she means it. When she told Lyons she would re- member him, she was sincere. I bet there wasn't a more surprised man in the world than Lyons Wickland when he got a message from Mae West. She wanted to him, wanted to do something for him. \"Well,\" finished Powers, \"Mac West got Lyons Wickland a part in her picture at a mighty fancy salary. She got him his chance in the movies. Now it's up to Lyons to make good. She's repaid her debt in her own fashion.\" I should say that if Mat' West is as generous in repay- ing all her debts there will Ik a statue erected to her some daw for it is a well-known human failing to for- get those who did us favors when we no longer require their aid. Powers opened a well-thumbed catalogue of his mod- els in 1926. He pointed to the full-length picture of a girl wearing a large scarf and exposing a gen- erous portion of a perfectly formed hack. Her legs were perfect, too, and her smile was, strangely enough, demure. Underneath the picture was the name, Ruby Stevens. \"She looks,\" I ventured timidly, \"exactly like Barbara Stanwyck might have looked seven years ago.\" \"That is Barbara Stanwyck.\" Mr. Powers retorted. \"She had a figure for modeling that artists raved about. Barbara used to get as high as twenty-live dollars an hour posing for hosiery ads. and that's high for a model. Look at those legs,\" he encouraged — and I looked, for 1 knew that it was rare to see the Stanwyck legs uncovered, especially since she has become a dramatic actress. \"You may not believe it.\" said Mr. Powers a- though he hardly had the courage to be- lieve it himself, \"but there was a time when Barbara was actually frightened of the mere thought of acting before a camera. \"She was first brought to my office by a friend of hers, a girl with whom she was dancing in a night club. The friend's name was Mae Clarke, and Mae had done quite a hit of posing. She brought Barbara in and asked if I couldn't get her some pos- ing to d \"Well.

But when Barbara heard the word 'film' she had a fit. She said she wouldn't go on the job. She kept on saying. 'That's a movie studio and 1 won't go because it means acting. I tell you, I can't act.' She almost cried about it. Continued on page 52 1G Th e G I'hol ,' Hum. II 'You've tried to hide your natural self under an outer veneer of culture and imitative glamour, because you thought it was what your fans wanted.\" Th ey By Judith Field T KINGS aren't what they used to be! And, Joan, il you don't already know that, you could soon find it out by studying reactions to the Crawford barometer. Time was when every article announcing the discovery of a \"new\" Joan was regarded as hot news, no matter how many had been printed before. But now. alas, even the very suggestion seems to bother a fickle public. Some of your ex-admirers swear that you have let your own career go to pieces because you have been keeping your- self so busy being a dozen other girls. The sad truth is that your infinite variety has not amazed or pleased your fans at all. It has simply reduced them to a state of annoyed incredulity. Soon when your name is mentioned one will expect them to hurst forth with such vociferous and blas- phemous assertions as, \"It's a fake. There isn't any Joan Crawford. That':: a mirror trick of M.-G.-M.'s.\" And, of course, it would be madness to give the public an opportunity to consider seriously such a notion. So it might be a good idea for you to forget your repertoire of Joans and step out to take a curtain call as yourself, just to reassure your audience, before they start walking out on you, that you're real. Stagy as it sounds, Joan, you're a daughter of the people if there ever was one. What could be more real than that0 You've tried to hide your natural self un- der an outer veneer of culture and imita- tive glamour, because you thought it was what your fans wanted. However, mis- takes can be rectified. If Horatio Alger, Jr., were still living and wrote about ambitious girls instead of newsboys and the like, he would seize upon you as the perfect model. For you have had to struggle upward in the face of ob- stacles. In fact, Joan, you're the feminine counterpart of any or all Alger heroes. Besides that, you occasionally reveal more than a trace of \"Merton of the Movie-.\" Altogether, it is a combination which is o . likely to he resented and misunderstood in this day and age. Poor Joan! Even from the beginning of your rise to fame and fortune you unconsciously ex- hibited Mertonish qualities of sincere affec- tation when speaking for publication. In 1927 when hailed as a dancing daughter and you were spending Saturday after- noons gayly whirling at the Montmartre, you were really doing a Pagliaccio. At least,, that's the impression one got from an interview of that year. One afternoon when you were feeling just too terribly, terribly blue and spotted a press woman's amiable face, you dropped into a chair beside her, broke down and poured out all your troubles. But it was not for publica- tion— oh, my, no! During the process of relating various moods of loneliness and melancholy, you confessed, \"It's 17 TALK ABOUT An open letter to Joan Crawford begs her to forget all the new Joans and to confine her acting to the studio if she values the loyalty of fans. not so bad now, for when I get thai way I have my car that I can jump into and drive away to the hills, and 1 often do.\" I wouldn't be human if I didn't ask myself, \"Now where have I heard those words he- fore?\" I recalled that they were quoted vir- tually unchanged in last year's magazines. However, it is still a good line and is referred to at intervals when the Crawford complexi- ties are delineated. And it also shows that, in spite of startling reports to the contrary, our Joan hasn't changed so very much after all. That 1927 interview was published, by the way, only after the writer, deciding that such touching confessions were too good to keep, had explained her point of view to you and received your rather surprised but gracious permission. But, strange as it seems, you usually do give permission for such wide dis- closures of your emotions and reactions. It has become quite a. habit of yours to pour con- fidences into the ears of a writer, and later consent to the publication of these effusions. Such goings-on please and flatter the writers and re- sult in a good story, but a very transparent one. If all the spectacular items ever written about you were placed before a psychiatrist, it would be interesting to hear his comments. Probably he would take one glance at the array of stories dwelling on your restless- ness, moodiness, superhuman energy, emotional tangles, and burning ambitions that not only aspire to better acting, but also include the desire for some proficiencv in art, literature, and designing, and declare you are psychopathic. Imagine that ! But we fans know our movie actresses better than that. You are not a psychopathic case — no crazier than the rest of us. It just shows naivete. That is what Constance Bennett is said to have said it was, and that should make it official. Of course, some one with your best interests at heart might suggest now as a good time to outgrow it — not all of it, perhaps, but enough to notice. And again, as gently as possible, it could be advised that when fans take to accusing their erstwhile favorite of everything from being infantile, melodramatic, and shallow to acting as though you were a Lady Vere de I 'ere, the best thing for her to do is — right about face. One must also admit that it grows a trifle irksome to hear so very often about the way you and Franchot Tone took to carrying and wearing those gardenias on evenings out. However, the subconscious reason for our annoyance may be mere jealousy because we couldn't have our flowers and Franchot, too. People are funny that way, you know. Now you have earned the right for diversion in leisure time, no matter how flowery it happens to be. Your gen- uine goodness more than makes up for the too theatrical Photo by Hurrell Joan is advised to stop airing her yearnings and emotions for the press in order to give her natural personality a chance in print. effects of the latest \"dancing lady\" moments, even if these qualities are much less publicized. One could probably count on five fingers the Holly- wood stars who would hail a sound crew man on the set with, \"Hi, there, how're the babies?\" and stop a ward- robe woman to chat about a candy recipe, or join, as an honorary member, the various fan clubs of her profes- sional rivals, and still keep up personal correspondence with the writers of the first twenty- four fan letters they received. Yet that is exactly what you do. Mow many movie queens would devote part of their time and the contents of their weekly pay envelope to the upkeep of four rooms in a Hollywood hospital — with instructions that they be used for the benefit of those who cannot afford to pay? Or surprise and delight their friends with impulsive and generous gifts and their mothers with flowers on Mother's Day? And still re- member with appreciation those who helped them before they reached the top of the screen ladder? And face a barrage of unfair publicity with such courage? Again Miss Crawford, step forward and take a bow. No matter how deeply one may be prejudiced by sur- face artificialities, it's impossible to dislike a girl like that. The fact that you are a subjective actress is perhaps the main reason why the Crawford personality is such a perplexing mixture of virtues and imperfections. Per- haps you unconsciously retain certain traits of every role you've ever played — and every strong character with whom you've come in contact. Maybe you fear your natural personality isn't interesting enough for inter- views, and so you dramatize. That's your error! The sooner you learn to be im- personal about your talents and keep your private life separate from the parts you play, the finer actress you'll Continued on page 58 IS MARRIAGE HASN'T CHANCED HIM George O'Brien is still a man's man, ready for anything at any time — and Marguerite Churchill is not trying to make a new man of him.

She is herself! You must read Margaret Reid's story on the opposite page to know more about her than has ever been published in a single article. I'hoto by Klnier Fryer 27 HALIFAX HONEY Ruby Keeler is surprisingly gentle and modest considering that she could be excused for being both dizzv and ritzy. By Margaret Reid RL\"B\\ KEELER is a surprise. If she conformed to the pattern of her life she would be a knowing, wisecracking baby, for wasn't she a night-club dancer when she was thirteen years old? Or she would be a contentedly self-important young matron, for, after all, isn't she the wife of Al Jolson, one of the most popular and richest stars in the theater? There is ample excuse for Ruby to be either dizzy or ritzy, or both. That she is neither constitutes the surprise. The adjectives which describe Ruby are the ones associated with any girl who dreams through a quiet childhood and leaves the shelter of her family only for the shelter of her husband. Adjectives such as \"nice,\" \"modest,\" \"gentle,\" and \"sincere\" apply to Ruby, whose childhood was spent, not in nurseries and gardens, but in the shifting colored lights of night clubs. In the middle of the night, when other little girls of her age were sleeping, Ruby was dancing on a polished, smoke-hung floor under a blazing spotlight. She was innocent of the men's eyes appraising her adolescent body as she tapped and swayed and whirled. Maybe there was an indulgent guardian angel keeping a weather eye on her. Or maybe it was that Mrs. Keeler and Ruby were nice people. Sitting recently in the interview room of the Warner offices in New York, Ruby was at the most exciting part of her picture career, her first flowering of success. \"Forty-second Street\" had put her away up on the cinema map, and \"Gold Diggers of 1933\" had done it again. Her New York vacation was a tumult of inter- views and photographs and uncourted publicity. The success of the hour was a trifle breathless, but she did not raise her eyebrows in phony unconcern, nor did she giggle witli girlish excitement. She sat, shy but poised, and spoke when spoken to in her deliberate, quiet little voice, without a flutter. A blue tweed suit matched her incredibly blue eyes. Her thick black lashes, unplucked brows, and healthy, pink cheeks render make-up unnecessary. It's a funny little face and a wholly beguiling one. Not much of a nose, a demure mouth — a tender, honest little Irish face made arresting by blazing blue eyes. Does she like the movies? Oh, yes, very much. Even though she was fright- ened at first. \"I started out with wonderful luck. In 'Forty-si Street' I played a girl new to the stage and scared to death. It was the perfect excuse for the way I felt — Photo by Fryer Miss Keeler, who began dancing in a night club at thirteen, takes her success as an actress with neither phony uncon- cern nor girlish excitement. and acted.

Even her explanation of her entry into the theater at thirteen is untinged with any spurious dramatics. \"My dad,\" she explains, \"was ill. And I was the oldest girl in the family, so naturally \" Ever since she • about three years old, she had danced. Her parents had moved from her birthplace, 1 falifax, Nova Scotia, to New York when she was three. By the time she had been in public school a year or so her dexteritv in the school drills had become so marked that her parents placed her in the Professional Children's School. Among her classmates were Lillian Roth. Mar- guerite Churchill. William Jannev, and Gene Raymo When she was thirteen, and her father fell ill. Ruby thought it was fine that she was already equipped to help out. Because - a cute child with lightning feet and melting grace, she got a job immediately in the chorus of a musical show called \"The Rise of Rosie ( >'Reilly.\" And continued to work steadily in night clubs and choruses of Broadway shows. i g :.s 28 HOLLYWOOD By Edwin and Elza Schall< sisterhood. \"Nice\" heroines have often been described as colorless, but possibly since Mae West has gone to the utter- most limit in depicting them, the pendulum is to swing back, and charming and persuasive innocence will come into its own again. Ruth's firm \"No\" to the idea of being perpetually naughty does suggest possibilities in that direction, and the tendency is one that will bear watching for the time being. Because of her temporary vacation, while Warner Broth- ers looked for something else to replace \"Mandalay,\" Ruth won't wind up her engagement at the studio until December. And we hear that George Brent may leave with her when she goes, even though his contract has still some time to run. Kay Francis took Ruth's place in \"Mandalay.\" Stars Freeze Mae West. — Mae West was cold-shoul- dered at her premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater. Very few stars turned out, except those from her own studio. Gloria Swanson, Richard Barthelmess, and William Powell saw the picture on the opening night, but there was a reason, for Bill went with Carol Lombard, who is a Paramount player, and Miss Swanson, Barthelmess, One of Marie Dressler's birth- day treats v/as an overnight visit to the White House. Bookworms like Virginia Dabney must make sure that a little absent- minded exposure only adds to the general scenery. RUTH CHATTERTON is deadly opposed to playing any more shady ladies. So opposed that she was willing to sacrifice her salary for a month rather than be seen in \"Mandalay.\" .She feels that there ought to be something in the films for her oilier than such honkatonk heroines as she portrayed in \"Frisco Jenny\" and \"Lilly Turner.\" She doesn't want always to seem bait for men. This is the first revolt of the kind that has occurred in months. Maybe it's the forerunner of a reform move- ment on the part of stars. Many of them have doted on appearing as damsels of uneasy virtue. They're re- garded as so much more dramatic than the strait-laced a n ci h e a r e good friends. Metro-Gold- wyn, Fox, and R'K O s t a r s wen' scarcely to be observed. It looked a little chilling, but did Mae care\" She drew a full house, anyway, for the first showing of \"I'm No Angel.\" with executives and society people well repre- sented, and they seemed tc be highly amused. 29 HIGH LIGHTS Our rambling reporters get the inside gossip from all the studios. Also she gained a major victory. Marlene Dietrich was present, and that quelled the report that Miss Diet- rich had not recognized Mae's existence when she re- turned from Europe.

Matrimonial Flub-dub. — Johnny Weissmuller and Lupe Yelez put on the anticipated silly show just he fore their marriage, probably to excite extra attention and get extra pub- licity. Lupe apparently inspired most of it, for she was very flip in answer- ing questions put to her by reporters, saying \"Maybe I marry to-morrow ; maybe I marry next week ; maybe I marry a vear from now. Maybe I tell nobody ; maybe the whole world will know,\" and much more jargon of that kind. Husbands haven't seen anything yet in the way of curlers if the home perma- nent waver worn by Helen Mack be- comes popular.

Baby LeRoy a Worry. — When the X. k. A. fight over salaries was on, some people became terribly worried about the size of Baby LeRoy's weekly revenue, and whether he might be seriously affected by the threatened control of the money paid to stars. The matter was looked into, and it was di-scovered that the baby receives on! a week when he is working, and $15 as a sort of retainer when he isn't. He is guar- anteed only ten we< work a year. Pretty good for an in- fant, but nothing as compared with Greta Garbo's $9,000 or $10,000 a week. Later on, since his contract is on a sliding scale, he will receive $110 a weelc, with a $50 retainer, but no- body has to worry about all that in- flation for several years. Meanwhile, the baby has been hav- ing a terrible feud with W. C.

A year ago one of the brightest potential stars on the Hollywood horizon, to-day she stands at the crossroads. Many Hollywood observers contend that Miss Morley's career, which began so brilliantly a short time ago, is rapidly fading into oblivion. Be they right or wrong, there can he little room for doubt that Karen's fate hangs in the balance, in the face of recent events. When she was first discovered by Clarence Brown, the director, Karen was hailed as star material. Scarcely a day went by without some published account of her charm, her poise, her individuality. To-day her name rarely appears in print, and then only in the smallest, most obscure items. \\\\ hen Karen's baby was horn recently, a short para- graph in a corner of a Los Angeles newspaper announced the event. It stated that a seven-pound son had been horn to Karen Morley, actress, and her husband. Charles Vidor, director, at Saint Vincent's hospital. It carried no account of Karen's brilliant rise to fame, no men- tion of her popularity in films. A year ago, so impor- tant an event probably would have been given a headline and a two-column picture of the actress. It is not alone the attitude of the press which has changed. Grumblings on the part of the public are becoming more evident each day. Fans want to know what Karen is doing, why more is not heard about her, why the sudden change from colorful public life to aloof seclusion? \"We pay to see her,\" they argue. \"Haven't we a right to know something ah nit her?\" Their query is met by silence on the part of Karen. \\- to the attitude of the studio where she is under By Jeanne de Kolty contract, it has completely reversed since Karen first at- tracted marked attention in Garbo's \"inspiration.\" Shortly after the picture was completed, I happened to mention to one of the studio publicity writers that Karen and I had been classmates at high school. The publicity man asked me — nay, begged me — to write a story about Karen. Metro-Goldwyn, he explained, was anxious to build up this brilliant actress, who was slated for the heights. The result of that conversation was the first fan- magazine story ever written about Miss Morley, in Pic- ture Play of October, 1931. A few w*eeks ago I telephoned to the studio requesting information for another story about Karen. The publicity department informed me that she could not be reached, they knew nothing about her expectant motherhood — the baby had not yet arrived — and had no information to give me. From the attitude of the person I spoke with, T had the impression that interest in Karen was on the wane. Possibly that is not true. Possibly the studio has some reason for wishing to assist Karen in her campaign for seclusion, but the present attitude is certainly a striking contrast to that of less than two years ago! At the beginning of her career, Karen went out of her way to gain friends among repre- sentatives of the press, and through them, the fans. She was always delighted at the prospect of an interview and did all she could to assist the writers. She even went so far as to suggest new angles for stories. She attracted considerable attention by issuing statements on her rather extraordinary views of love and marriage. \"I would rather be dead than face the life which is the usual lot of women.\" she said in an interview a little more than a year ago. \"I could never see little Karen sweeping, cooking, and having babies. Even love would Two years ago Miss Morley's debut on the screen was applauded by fans and the press for her charm, poise and individuality. never bring me to that.\" That she meant what she said is hard to believe in the face of the fact that to-day she is the mother of a robust infant. In another interview, she remarked that she was too busy even to think of romance. \"Possibly years from now 1 will consider marriage.\" she said. \"But it won't he for a long, long time.\" Two or three months later. Karen was the wife of Charles Vidor. Perhaps Karen still entertains her much-discussed distaste for domesticity. But she lives in a large home in Westwood Village with but one maid, she eats three meals a day, and I haven't heard of her husband missing a meal yet. and her house is scrupu- lously clean ! About the time of her marriage, Karen suddenly ceased to he interested in publicity of any sort. The girl who had been the fan writers' delight made a com- plete about-face. She refused to see any one. She would not comment upon her romance with Charles Vidor, other than to deny its existence. Rumors arose that she was married. She denied the truth point-blank. 31 of MISS MORLEY Has Karen Morley deserted her career to be a mother and housewife, which she often declared she would never do, or has she just gone into snooty seclusion for a while? On a hunch, I communicated with J. Ah Backs, county clerk of Orange County, California. From Santa Ana he wrote last November : \"Charles Vidor, age 33, and Mildred L. Linton, age 22, were married in Santa Ana November 15, 1932, by Harry Evan Owings, a minister.\" Karen and I first met when we were freshmen at Hol- lywood High School. At that time she was plain Mil- dred Linton, fresh from Iowa. After her marriage, Karen continued to work in pic- tures. She is under contract to M.-G.-M. and appar- ently the studio has no intention of releasing the tal- ented actress whose ability nobody who knows her will deny. \"She seems to look upon the world with mistrust,\" says Louella O. Parsons, whose influence with both stars and executive- is unchallenged in the movie world. \"I don't believe she is trying to be snooty. Rather, she is unreliable. She just isn't on the level. A week after her marriage, she gave me a purportedly exclusive story denying any romance. She seems to have no faith in any one. Surely, she realizes that we writers wish her no harm ! Karen has always been charming to me, and it is hard to believe she would deliberately lie. Rather, I believe that she is ill-advised.\" Many explanations have been offered for Karen's attitude. It has been sug- gested that she wishes to give up her career for motherhood. This is difficult to credit when one considers the tremen- dous amount of hard work and heart- breaking struggle that she has put into her career. Since the day we first met, Karen has been working toward one ob- jective— professional success. She hoped to become a physician, and spent two years at college preparing for medical training. This did not prevent her tak- ing part in every school play and operetta that was given, and when she finally re- linquished the idea of becoming a doctor, she set her heart upon success as an actress. She has made a slave of herself for pictures. Surely, she cannot intend to give up the career that has cost so much ? A possible explanation lies in the fact that Karen's behavior has resembled that of Greta Garho in the past few months. Unfortunately, Karen lacks the glamour To-day her name rarely appears in print. Even the birth of her son, Michael Karoly Vidor, got only a short paragraph in a Los Angeles newspaper. ot the Swedish star. The brilliant publicity campaign which resulted in one of the strongest fan followings ever created might prove dynamite in another's hands. It is difficult to believe that this extremely intelligent and talented girl would try to imitate another star! Nevertheless, just after their marriage, Karen and her husband visited the Pasadena Community Playhouse, when- tin- actress met her first success. Apparently t' made every effort to conceal their identity, entering and leaving the theater while the lights were dimmed, and giv- ing old friends the cut direct. This performance certainly smacked of the \"Garboesque.\" [Continued on pa.u<- 551 32 Why STARS They're considered fair game by every one with something to sell and as fame in- creases it's harder and harder to say \"No!\" WHY are there so few movie fortunes? What happens to those big salaries? Some actors wave their money adieu down the stock- market slide, others buy laundries or hosiery mills or ranches or gold mines. The answer is the same. They live splendidly, often invest foolishly and are targets for salesmen gifted with silver oratory. Usually stars pay much more for everything than you or I would be charged. \"Well, 1 have a nice hot story for you to-day!\" Richard Dix greeted me some time ago. \"I'm flat broke!\" At that time Hollywood estimated his fortune at well over a million. I was so surprised that I actually stopped eating. Extending my hand, I said brokenly, \"Pard!\" \"Practically,\" he qualified. When I learned his definition of that word. I felt a bit easier for the fate of his pedigreed dogs. I can't work up much sympathy for a man with real-estate holdings and who gets fifty thousand dollars a picture, besides percentages. However, when one who has earned as much as Dix. who is reputed to have been successful in business ventures and who is not a spend- thrift, confesses that he is strapped for cash and cleaned out of all other assets but real estate, it is a situation worth pondering. Richard Dix is one of the least extravagant actors, though not stingy. His scale of living is exactly what it would be were he suc- cessful in some other profession, he insists. His wardrobe makes a big dent in his salary, but his cars are never of the most expensive models. He steers clear of premieres, waiting for popular-price showings. Theaters and dinners cost him only what is necessary to repay social obligations. He lives simply on his San Fernando ranch, the upkeep of which totals two hundred and fifty dollars a month. It is nonproductive, designed merely as a home. Maintenance of this and other real estate requires no negligible sum. Actors are notoriously poor business men, although there are a few good ones, he says. I inquired as witheringly as possible, \"Who?\" \"Here's one!\" He emphatically thumped his broad chest. \"Didn't you lose your shirt in the market crash a few years ago?\" I asked. \"Now, now, you're getting technical.\" he admonished. \"I hold onto my money longer than most actors. I took only one big licking These players tell how they try to hold their own, some even going into business on the side. Helen Chandler, Ricardo Cortez, Charles Bickford, Edmund Lowe, and Esther Ralston have shopping systems. 3?, Co BROKE By Myrtle Cebhart on the market — and I lost in a bank crash. But I've profited in other business ventures and in real estate. I consider myself a good business man. Others.-' Lewis Stone, Conrad Nagel, Thomas Meighan — men of their steady type inspire respect. \"But we all buy dozens of neckties we don't need, or a 'genuine Chinese mandarin's coat' — made in Los Angeles — or gaudy vases at antique prices. That is part of the price we pay for being actors.\" Even aside from costly plunges, it is difficult for an actor to salt away many ducats for that inevitable gloomy day. A large portion of his earnings must go back into his career. And he seldom is quoted the private citizen's prices. There is a tendency among merchants to consider cinema celebs fair game. Don't they belong to the public? Resentment is voiced at times because the actors object to the belief that they should dish out their money to the public that gives it to them. True, shopkeepers have carried some bad stellar accounts on their books ; some players are notoriously \"poor pay,\" frequently through forgetfulness. Often servants are trusted with too much responsibility, and the merchant, ascribing carelessness to the actors who shop by proxy, may try to nick them — probably to make up for the bad accounts. And some stellar lights manage to sail along, victors in a one- sided battle. There was the girl, for instance, who got an expensive new motor periodically \"on trial,\" always with a good excuse for not making a down payment, rode in grand style for several months by \"neglecting\" the agent's letters, and returned it when he became annoying. This dodge worked for a couple of years, during which she was driven in luxurious cars on which she hadn't paid a dime. But is that bad business on the part of the girl or the dealer? And there was the blond ingenue who made a deal with a jeweler by the terms of which she was to broadcast hints to the boy friends around gift days, receiving fifteen per cent commission besides the baubles. So the merchants partially justify their attitude. \"It is habitual with them to overcharge us,\" Dix said. \"We must expect that a part of our salaries will be wasted in this manner.\" He would not estimate the figure, but others have placed it all the way between a tenth and a fourth of their incomes. Continued on page 55 Richard Dix explains in detail why money is slippery in Hollywood. Ken Maynard, Mary Astor, Bill Boyd, and Ann Harding also tell of their strug- gles to beat the high cost of stardom. 34 They Say By Karen Hollis Warner Brothers have sent Bushy Berkeley, their dance director, to New York to sign a few dozen dancing beauties. And I thought all the time that I was watching \"Footlight Parade\" that they already had too many. Even through the splendid gaudiness of the waterfall number I kept wishing the girls would finish their stint and make way for Jim Cagney. Paramount's big idea was to hold beauty contests all over the world in order to find recruits for a picture called \"The Search for Beauty.\" England's, Ireland's, Scot- land's, and South Africa's nominees arrived in New York en route to Hollywood and proved to be four very pretty girls and as many nice-looking boys. Maybe there is a potential Garbo or Gable among them, but it seems to me the chance is just as good, if not better, of finding a potential star among Hollywood extras. Latest to enlist outside aid for Hollywood is Jesse Lasky, who wants recruits from society for his picture, \"Coming Out Party.\" He already has Alice Moats, who wrote \"No Nice Girl Swears.\" A little group of New York Junior Leaguers, discussing their debutante friends and their possibilities, weren't too enthusiastic. To hear them tell it, there is hardly a girl among them who doesn't try to ape the looks and man- nerisms of her favorite star of the moment. They are just pallid replicas of Greta Garbo. Katharine Hepburn,. Mae West, and Kay Francis, according to their friends. In the midst of the discussion up cropped an incident that has long been gloated over in New York's social circles. It happened before Mae West became the rage that she now is, back in the days when she was being arrested regularly for putting on shows that somebody or other considered indecent. A society reporter remarked that a certain young woman of one of our first families grew to resemble Miss West more every day. Next day the telephone wires to the newspaper office burned. The mother, the uncle, the family lawyer, and finally the girl herself, called to protest indignantly. The reporter admitted her blunder, pro- fessed to be broken-hearted, said that she would never make such an invidious compari- son again, and then added slyly, \"Because every one expects Mae West to sue me for libel.\" Marlene Dietrich, re- turning from Europe, made history when she said she did not know Mae West. EVERY one who ought to know says that Holly- wood is overcrowded by some ten thousand players. Not ten thousand screen-struck amateurs, but ten thousand players who have had some experience but just haven't caught the eye of a casting director when he was in a mood to give an unknown a break. So what do the Hollywood executives do? They launch innumerable campaigns to lure more people to Hollywood to take a chance on the biggest gamble of the day. Harold Lloyd, working in the modest way of a pro- ducer who makes just one picture in ever so long a while, has signed a girl to play in his future pictures. She is Pauline Moore, an artist's model. She poses in many of Arthur William Brown's magazine illustrations. Broadway Lights Up. — After a few false starts, the theater season has got under way and Hollywoodians are scam- pering Easl to >ee if the stage is up to any new tricks they can borrow. Janet Gaynor, Al Jolson, Irene Dunne, Marie Dressier, Harold Lloyd. Colleen Moore, Wallace Beery, and Miriam Jordan have been among the 6rs1 nighters. On the other side of the footlights they find players that Broadway snatched from Hollywood, usually while Hollywood's interest in them was at low ebb. Lois Moran, Marilyn Miller, and Douglas Gilmore, all of whom films released without a pang, are knock-outs on Broadway. Frances Fuller who was so beguiling in \"One Sunday Afternoon.\" had contracted to do a play on Broadway before her advent into pictures, so she is not a Hollywood cast-off, just a loan. Pola Negri, The Screen in Review 39 Mr. Muni's performance is not distinguished, although it could not fail to be competent, of course. But more, much more, is expected of the star of \"Scarface\" and \"I Am a Fugitive.\" On the other hand, Mary Astor is brilliantly suc- cessful as Mr. Muni's cruel, neurotic wife, and Gordon Westcott is fine as his idle son with an English accent. Some of the others, however, fail signally to portray the passing years beyond turning their faces over to the make- up department. \"Torch Singer.\" Claudette Colbert, Ricardo Cor- .' tez, David Manners, Lyda Roberti, Baby LeRoy, Florence Roberts, Cora Sue , Collins.

But here, unfortunately, Mae goes out of her way to show us that she's bluffing, that really she is a sentimentalist almosl as eager for a happy Christmas- card ending as Janet Gaynor. How else to account for the outcome of the breach-of -promise suit and Mae's fade-out embrace with Gary Grant as the defendant? Incidentally, the courtroom sequence is the comic high light of the picture and .Mae'- cross-examination of the witnesses, her subjugation of the jury, and her flirtation with the ancient judge are moments to remember. Before that she is seen as the \"cooch\" dancer of a side- show, then the star of a big circus, and as the retired lady of leisure whose only occupation is to snare willing, grateful, and generous men. Far from an inspired story, but rather an excuse to flaunt the West personality, the picture is inconceivable without her. The best line comes, I think, when Mae. all but suffocated in spangles and feathers, drawls to one of her four colored maids, \"I'.eulah. peel me a grape.\" But it is not fair to single out one speech of Mae's. She makes them all sure-lire. The whole show, and nothing else but, Miss West subordinates the entire cast, demoting such accomplished Continued on page ^1 \"I'm No Angel.\" Grant, Edward Arnold, Ralfe Harolde, 40 By Edwin Schallert HELL OVER Is it just \"nerves\" from high-tension work or the artistic temperament that keeps feuds simmering in the movie colony? HOLLYWOOD is a fighting- town. Persnickity temperamental bouts are always being waged. Sometimes they are real fist fights. More often they are just squabbles, with hot words, snubs, and ritzes. Whichever way the chips fall, and sometimes they fall quite briskly and right off the shoulder, there's many a petty quarrel that turns into a burning feud. Occasionally shots have been fired, but mostly in the old days. Once a real duel was threatened. Norman Kerry was all but challenged with coffee and pistols for two. He had a disagreement with a foreign actor whose idea of vengeance was an early-morning encounter with real weapons. That might be the way to settle things, but under California law a duel happens to be a felony. So after considering Mexico and other more distant points, the two antagonists abandoned the combat. Feuds nowadays often reach the punch stage. One punch generally is all that's delivered, as when Al Jolson recently took a sock at Walter Winchell because he thought Winchell, in writing \"Broadway Through a Keyhole,\" cast aspersions at him and Ruby Keeler. This brief and much publicized tournament provided a nine-day wonder and is said to have netted Winchell $10,000 extra for exploitation of his film. Anyway, he said so. And if it did, that was one instance where the punchee rather than the puncher got the purse. The battle of Jolson versus Winchell adds to a long list of feuds which featured blows, including those between Louis B. Mayer and Charles Chaplin in 1920; John Barrymore and Myron Selznick ; John Gilbert and Jim Tullv ; Tom Mix and a stage comedian, Will Morrisey ; Ernst Lubitsch, the director, and Hans Kraly, the writer, which occupied head- line attention for days, because of the prominence of the principals and the fact that the ex-Mrs. Lubitsch was dancing with Kraly at the time; and finally ( ieorge Raft and some obscure assailant. Hollywood always relishes a good fight, and lately they have occurred with fair regularity, although not always with stars as combatants. The fact is that stars have to protect their faces and if the fighting keeps up. a clause may go into contracts forbidding luminaries from indulging in U C t L.iRUE MIRIAM HOPKINS WALTER WINCHELL LILVAN TASHMAN 41 HOLLYWOOD THELMA TODD WILLIAM GARGAN LUPE VELEZ NANCY CARROLL any pugilistic pastime. Black eyes, swollen noses, cauliflower ears, and mauled faces are likely to hold up production and cost a lot of money. No such battling is anticipated at the moment, though. If there are wars to be fought among players, they'll be done with the stilettos of acid glances, the velvet claw of feline repartee, the pillowed wallop of \"I don't care to talk to you. Out of my way !\" And are the movie sparklers masters and mistresses of these art-, as well as the more genial one of ribbing! Still there are always the film fights. They lead to many things. The widely recited antipathy between Claudette Colbert and Miriam Hopkins, for instance. They got very mad at each other over a slapping scene in \"The Smiling Lieutenant.\" The slaps administered by Colbert we: hard, Miriam thought. The scene, though it was shown late in the film, was photographed early. The two didn't look at each other very kindly through the rest of the production, and even had words. A feud was started which has never been overcome. You may have noticed that Miss Colbert and Miss Hopkins have never been seen together since then. Clara Bow and Thelma Todd weren't so hot about each other after their encounter in \"Call Her Savage.\" A slap in a movie may be just a synthetic slap, but it seems to have dire sequels among the ladies. Often, to be sure, much is made of the antipathies that supposedly arise, just for the sake of press-agenting. Still the Bow-Todd affair had genuine feudish earmarks — or were they cheek marks? The one thing that hasn't happened yet is the spectacle of two women clawing each other in public. Those who sit around waiting for sensa- tional events feel that this will occur some day. but so far their dream has been frustrated. Tallulah Bankhead got her face slapped and her hat torn off by a woman in a Condon restaurant, but after all that was too far away to provide a ringside thrill.
