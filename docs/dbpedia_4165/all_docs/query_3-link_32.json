        "text": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. â The weather forecast for Saturday afternoonâs home game against the Houston Dynamo calls for temperatures in the low 50s and a mix of sun and clouds.\n\nItâs a far cry from what unfolded the last time the Dynamo visited the New England Revolution at Gillette Stadium back in August 2015, when a pair of lightning delays totaling almost three hours pushed the final whistle well past midnight and into the wee hours of the following morning.\n\nDespite the chaos it was ultimately a happy end for the Revs, who used second-half goals from Jose Goncalves and Juan Agudelo to down the Dynamo, 2-0.\n\nAs the Revs prepare to welcome the Dynamo back to New England for the first time since that frenzied evening, I asked a few of the players and coaches involved to recall that weather nightmare.\n\nNew England Revolution forward Teal Bunbury\n\nâI think thatâs the craziest (game Iâve experienced in MLS). I feel like every Open Cup game thereâs always something crazy with delays, but that was something that Iâve never experienced before â having to wait in the locker room and then, âOh no, 30 minutes,â and âOh no, there was another lighting strike.â That was something Iâve never experienced and this is my eighth season now in the league. That was crazy. Iâm hoping â and Iâm sure â that it wonât happen again.â\n\nNew England Revolution midfielder Kelyn Rowe\n\nâThat was a very long night for all of us. I think we came in multiple times and had to wait and wait and wait. As a player, thatâs hard to do. You wait all day for the game â thatâs hard to do â and then you have to wait during the game and thatâs even worse. That was a big mental challenge and we came out on the positive side of that, and I think that was a huge take on how that team was. I think this team is even stronger.â\n\nNew England Revolution head coach Jay Heaps\n\nâWe wanted to finish so very badly, and I donât think they wanted to as much. I remember them after the game saying, âWhy is this game going on?â We just wanted to make sure that we had every minute played at home, so we pushed hard to have that game continue on.â"
