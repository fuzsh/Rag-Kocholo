        "text": "Better than ever - Real-time lightning photography\n\niLightningCam 2 - The Second Generation - Real-time lightning photography with iPhone made easy.\n\nIt enables everyone to take spectacular pictures of real lighting strikes with an iPhone or iPad!\n\nAfter three years of development, iLightningCam 2 follows the unique iLightningCam, which was the only app with ISO control since 2012 with more than 160 000 users.\n\niLightningCam 2 features:\n\n- Full AUTO Mode!\n\nNo user input needed!\n\nThe app changes automatically between day and night mode\n\nContinuous calculation of best ISO settings based on the last\n\nstrikes\n\n- Original Photo Resolution, no tricks, no interpolation!\n\n- Much better detection!\n\n- Double-shot , + one image as blend of first and second shot!\n\n- New modern design!\n\n- For experts: ISO ranges are fully manually adjustable, if wished!\n\niLightningCam 2 uses true real-time recognition of lightning strikes. Once recognized, your iPhone takes a picture of the recognized lightning in up to full resolution. And yes - your iPhone or iPad is fast enough!\n\nYou only need a good view on a real thunderstorm.\n\nThe app works free hand. Just point your iPhone towards the scene/part of the sky/thunderstorm where you expect the next lightning, start the iLightningCam 2 and wait, the app will automatically press the trigger if a lightning is detected in your view.\n\nWarning:\n\nLightning storms are life threatening for you and your phone!!! Take care using this app! Do not take any risks and avoid exposure to thunderstorms! Use this app only in lightning and storm protected places. You are solely responsible for your actions and adverse consequences. Read full safety warning in the instructions page, before using this app.\n\nWho is it not for: It is not for children and it is not for mentally handicapped persons, as they may have not the ability to protect themselves against lightning or the associated storm.\n\nmagsnanna2012 ,\n\nDoes what I could never do but still....\n\nLook I love that this app captures what I never could. I only have one COMPLAINT: why do my pics have a dark gray band across the top????? All captures have it and it ruins what would otherwise be a pristine shot...ð¤ð Fix that or tell me how to and I will change my rating to 5 stars....I am using it on iPhone 6s Plus and it continuously has the gray bandingððððððð\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nDear customer,\n\nit is not the app, it is the iphones camera that uses a rolling shutter technique for image aquisiton. this means, that the image reaout of the sensor is not done all at once, but from top to down in a few milliseconds. if a strike is shorter than the read out, you end up with rolling shutter artifacts. these are more common during bright conditions, and rare during night because of longer exposure times. we do a lot of tricks to reduce the probability of these artifacts in our app, but during bright day and having a strom with short or oszillating strikes it is difficult.\n\nwe therefore developed the FAST mode for the iphone 6s and newer, which makes more images in a shorter interval so that the chance for one good image (of the image series) is much higher, however at the cost of photo resolution (only 2 MP). for iphone 8 and 10 we have the PH60 (photo60) mode, that does the same with 8 MP. so during bright day you can choose: less artifacts /flaws but less resolution (FAST or pH60) versus super high photoresolution but higher probability for flaws.\n\nYou have a 6 s plus , so during bright day please try the FAST mode\n\nDuring night the PHOTO mode\n\nAll the best\n\nThe iLightningCam team"
