        "text": "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nWe turn now to the big story on the Korean Peninsula. Not, not the one about the guy in the North with the missiles and the threats. But the guy in the South with the shades and the goofy dance moves.\n\nPSY: (Singing) Oppan Gangnam Style...\n\nMARTIN: After that monster YouTube hit, PSY released his new video at a concert this weekend.\n\nNPR's Frank Langfitt has reaction from South Korea.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF A CROWD)\n\nFRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: I'm at World Cup Stadium in Seoul and tens of thousands of people are pouring in here for this weekend's PSY concert. They're very excited to hear this new song, see the new video, and also see how he follows up the huge success of \"Gangnam Style.\"\n\nLee Han Sun is a 33-year-old power plant engineer. He's heading inside with 50,000 other PSY fans for the sold-out concert. Lee hopes the new song will be a bit hit.\n\nLEE HAN SUN: (Through Translator) I have really high expectations for how this one is going to turn out. Gangnam Style has such a huge impact and I expect this one to have an even larger one.\n\nLANGFITT: The audio for the single, \"Gentleman,\" came out Saturday morning.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, GENTLEMAN)\n\nPSY: (Singing in foreign language)\n\nLANGFITT: That was mother father gentleman.\n\nLee likes what he's heard so far, but is waiting on the key element: the video. Some here wonder if PSY or anyone can match the success of Gangnam, which took Korean pop - or K-Pop - global. Even Lee worries PSY could become a global one-hit wonder.\n\nSUN: (Through Translator) I heard the new single and, honestly, I don't know. I think maybe there's a 30 percent chance it will flop.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF A CROWD)\n\nLANGFITT: So, it's Sunday morning after that concert Saturday night. And the video is out and so I've come to a mall in - where else - Gangnam, to hear the public's verdict.\n\nKim Kyung Ah is a 21-year-old film student at Seoul's Dongguk University. She's sitting with her boyfriend around the corner from a Baskin-Robbins. Kim says the new video, which is full of hip-thrusting, slap-stick and big dance numbers, is similar to Gangnam and a bit of a let down.\n\nKIM KYUNG AH: (Through Translator) Because PSY was a big hit internationally, I had this expectation that he was going to produce something of quality that befits his reputation. But he copied this one dance move from a famous girl group, so I thought it wasn't as fresh as I expected.\n\nLANGFITT: Kim's boyfriend, Lee Ju Yong, is a freelance photographer with a mop of auburn-tinted hair. He agrees. And he also thought the new video had too much product placement. Lee is actually from Gangnam, a wealthy, fashionable district in Seoul which PSY parodied with his absurd, lassoing, horse-riding dance.\n\nSo you live in Gangnam. Are your rich and do you own a horse?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLEE JU YONG: (Foreign language spoken)\n\nLANGFITT: I'm not actually rich, he says, but my grandfather was.\n\nAlthough the new video did not live up to expectations, the couple are still PSY fans. And Kim is proud of what PSY has done to boost their country's image.\n\nAH: (Foreign language spoken)\n\nLANGFITT: Because he's promoting Korea to the rest of the world, she says, and spreading K-pop.\n\nWhich is a lot more than can be said for that guy with the missiles up North.\n\nFrank Langfitt, NPR News, Seoul.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GENTLEMAN\")\n\nMARTIN: This is week, NPR is launching a new project focused on race, ethnicity and culture in America, and how we communicate across those lines. It's called Code Switch. We'll talk about what code switching is, along with the rest of the day's top news, tomorrow on MORNING EDITION.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GENTLEMAN\")\n\nMARTIN: You're listening to NPR News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2013 NPR.
