        "text": "The excitement for Freaky Friday 2 keeps going on and on and on and on.\n\nLindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis had the ultimate reunion on the set of their new movie as filming is underway in Los Angeles.\n\nTwenty years after the original body-swap movie hit theaters, the actresses were seen dressed in eccentric outfits while reprising their roles as Anna and Tess Coleman. In one scene, the mother-daughter duo took a ride in a red convertible, with Curtis flashing the peace sign.\n\nAnd although Anna is a smart, strong, beautiful, independent woman and she doesn't need a man to complete her, the movie—on the other hand—would not be complete without an appearance from her detention buddy Jake (Chad Michael Murray).\n\nFortunately, the actor was also spotted on set, rocking a pair of jeans and carrying a motorcycle helmet just like old times.\n\nWhile it's unclear where Jake and Anna stand these days, Freaky Friday 2 is promising fans won't be disappointed by this \"multigenerational twist\" on the original 2003 flick."
