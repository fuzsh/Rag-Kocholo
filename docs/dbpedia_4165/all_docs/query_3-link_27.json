        "text": "CENTRE HALL — No one told the Centre Hall Library building about the old adage that lightning never strikies twice in the same place.\n\nIn fact, the water pipes in the building have burst three times over the last 22 or so years. The most recent event happened on Dec. 27, while Pennsylvania was experiencing that brutal Christmas cold snap.\n\nKathleen Edwards, Centre Hall Library’s branch manager, was in the building getting ready to open for the day when she discovered the water pipe break. The pipes had frozen and then burst.\n\nA plumber who was called to the library estimated that the water had been running for about an hour before Edwards found it. A crew of people have been working to restore the library ever since.\n\nThe damage done was to the ceiling in a craft closet and the area above the children’s collection. This same area had flooded in 2003. That flood had wiped out 50% to 60% of the children’s collection and necessitated the removal of all of the library’s contents to another location while the floor covering was replaced.\n\nThe craft closet contained art supplies, board games and construction paper. The paper and board games were not salvageable, but many of the art supplies were in plastic tubs and were saved. The children’s books that took a hit were the ones for very young readers. These “board books,” or books that that have pages made of heavy paper that can handle a toddler’s attention, soaked up the water and pages swelled.\n\nThe expansions of these books were too much for the bookcase and its sides were pushed out, destroying the bookcase. The bookcase and the board books will have to be replaced.\n\nThere was no estimate of the cost of the damage.\n\nThe building at the time was set to the regular normal temperature but the cold overnight had overcome the heat in the area of the water pipes. The library was expected to re-open this week.\n\nEdwards was excited to share the news that the Centre County Library board and the local Centre Hall board members are going to kick off a capital campaign this spring to raise money to expand the library and fix problems like the frozen pipes.\n\nThe library boards have done a needs assessment and they hope to raise funds to expand the size of the library. They hope to go from 25,000 square feet to 27,500 square feet.\n\nOne of the desired improvements, for example, is a separate meeting room. The collection takes up most of the floor space and if a program is being presented at the library, the rest of the library’s functions shut down. With a separate meeting room, the meeting could happen and library patrons could still go about their business. In addition, more room to house the collection would be added.\n\nAnother wish of the manager is that the bookmobile restart making its rounds.\n\nThe bookmobile that serviced many of the surrounding towns has been out of service since COVID hit. The vehicle needed repairs and the driver found another job when he couldn’t go out with the bookmobile. Edwards is hoping a driver can be found and the bookmobile can begin again to make its rounds.\n\nMost of us are looking forward to spring unless, of course, you are a skier or an ice fisherman. The library manager and the library patrons in the Centre Hall area are looking ahead to the coming challenges and in the end a better library."
