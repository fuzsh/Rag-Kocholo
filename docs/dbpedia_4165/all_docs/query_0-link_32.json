        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1894–1982). American director King Vidor created a series of motion pictures in the 1920s and 1930s that are considered among the most creative Hollywood productions of the late silent and early sound eras. Vidor’s films of the period typically deal in relatively uncompromising terms with such themes as idealism and disillusionment in contemporary life. Among his admired works are The Big Parade (1925), Hallelujah! (1929), The Champ (1931), Stella Dallas (1937), and The Citadel (1938).\n\nKing Wallis Vidor was born on February 8, 1894, in Galveston, Texas. As a schoolboy, he was an assistant projectionist in a nickelodeon. In 1913 he directed his first film, Hurricane in Galveston, a short about the natural disaster in 1900, which Vidor had witnessed as a boy. Two years later he went to Hollywood, where he worked as an extra, a clerk, and a scriptwriter, while his wife, Florence Vidor (divorced 1924), became a well-known silent-film actress. In 1918 Vidor returned to directing and made 16 short films. The following year he directed his first feature, The Turn in the Road, a drama that he also wrote.\n\nThe 1920s\n\nIn 1922 Vidor began working at Metro Pictures, which merged twice to become Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1925. His reputation was established with the hit The Big Parade, which became MGM’s biggest moneymaker to that time. It was followed by The Crowd (1928), considered to be one of the finest of all silent films. It deals with the life of an average American who starts out with high hopes but is gradually broken by the social ills of modern urban life. The Crowd earned Vidor the first of his five Academy Award nominations for best director. That same year he directed a pair of notable comedies, The Patsy and Show People.\n\nAt this time Vidor was successfully able to move into sound films. Hallelujah!, which was made into a talkie in postproduction, may have been the best picture of 1929. The drama was one of the first features from a major studio to have an all-black cast. It tells the story of a cotton picker who turns to religion after accidentally killing his brother. The critics praised Vidor’s blend of melodrama and music, and he earned another Oscar nomination for best director. American audiences, however, were not quite ready to embrace the film, and it was a box-office failure.\n\nThe 1930s\n\nVidor’s first project in the 1930s was the popular comedy Not So Dumb (1930), adapted from a George S. Kaufman–Marc Connelly Broadway play. Billy the Kid (1930), about the famed outlaw and the sheriff who killed him, was a box-office disappointment. Much better was the drama Street Scene (1931), from Elmer Rice’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Set on a New York street, the movie follows the lives of the various residents. Vidor’s success continued with The Champ, a popular tale starring Wallace Beery as a washed-up boxer who looks to make a comeback in order to keep custody of his son (Jackie Cooper). The film received an Academy Award nomination for outstanding production, and Beery won for best actor. In addition, Vidor earned another Oscar nod for best director.\n\nIn 1932 Vidor directed Cynara, a drama that starred Ronald Colman and Kay Francis, and Bird of Paradise, which featured Joel McCrea and Dolores del Rio in a South Seas setting. Next was The Stranger’s Return (1933), which centers on an unhappily married woman who leaves New York City and moves to a farm in the Midwest. Our Daily Bread (1934) was a Great Depression-era drama about a struggling couple who create a farm collective; the movie failed at the box office.\n\nIn 1935 Vidor directed the romance The Wedding Night. Despite the presence of Gary Cooper, the film was not a commercial success. That same year Vidor directed So Red the Rose, an American Civil War romance starring Margaret Sullavan as a wealthy Southerner who struggles to keep her family’s plantation and Randolph Scott as the pacifist turned Confederate officer she loves. In 1936 Vidor made the western The Texas Rangers, with Fred MacMurray and Jack Oakie as ex-bandits who become Rangers and are tasked with finding a former partner-in-crime.\n\nVidor then directed Stella Dallas, an adaptation of Olive Higgins Prouty’s novel. Barbara Stanwyck played the role of a mother who sacrifices her own happiness for that of her class-conscious daughter (Anne Shirley); both actresses were nominated for Oscars. Nearly as popular was Vidor’s adaptation of A.J. Cronin’s novel The Citadel, with Robert Donat as a once-idealistic doctor seduced by fame and wealth, despite the pleas of his wife (Rosalind Russell). Vidor earned his fourth Academy Award nomination for director.\n\nAlthough he was not credited with any releases in 1939, Vidor had a hand in The Wizard of Oz, shooting a few of the black-and-white scenes. The next year Vidor directed Northwest Passage, an adaptation of Kenneth Roberts’s best seller about Rogers’s Rangers, an 18th-century militia headed by Robert Rogers. The cast included Spencer Tracy, Robert Young, and Walter Brennan; W.S. Van Dyke and Jack Conway also filmed some scenes, but their work was not credited. Later that year Vidor directed Comrade X, a romantic comedy that starred Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr.\n\nLater Years\n\nVidor subsequently spent three years writing, producing, and directing An American Romance (1944), an epic about a steelworker (Brian Donlevy) who rises beyond his class to become a leader of industry. However, it was met with indifference by wartime moviegoers. Vidor returned to prominence with one of the decade’s most controversial projects, David O. Selznick’s epic melodrama Duel in the Sun (1946). Vidor quit two days before the final wrap because of tensions with Selznick, who continually revised the script and hired a number of directors to reshoot Vidor’s work. Still, Duel in the Sun was one of the year’s biggest hits.\n\nVidor’s later films were less impressive. These included On Our Merry Way (1948), which was codirected with Leslie Fenton (John Huston and George Stevens were uncredited); Beyond the Forest (1949), featuring Bette Davis as a small-town married woman who is in love with another man; and The Fountainhead (1949), an adaptation of Ayn Rand’s best-selling novel. In the 1950s Vidor directed the B-films Lightning Strikes Twice (1951) and Japanese War Bride (1952), the melodrama Ruby Gentry (1952), and the western Man Without a Star (1955). In 1956 he released a version of Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace. Although the movie failed to find an audience, Vidor received an Academy Award nomination for best direction (although the battle scenes, arguably the film’s best parts, were directed by Mario Soldati).\n\nVidor’s last feature was Solomon and Sheba (1959), a biblical epic. Vidor subsequently retired from directing, though he later taught. In 1979 he was given an honorary Oscar for “his incomparable achievements as a cinematic creator and innovator.” Vidor’s autobiography, A Tree Is a Tree (1953), contains valuable information on the development of motion pictures. Vidor died on November 1, 1982, in Paso Robles, California."
