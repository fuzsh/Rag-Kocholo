        "text": "“The Very Best Piano Instruction may well be the best piano instruction on the web. It makes difficult classical and contemporary arrangements easy to digest in an intuitive, revolutionary way. One of the biggest obstacles to learning music is sight reading, but theverybestpianoinstruction.com offers an alternative with its word notation, which is easy to understand and to read. Whereas sight reading can take months or years to become proficient at, word notation is intuitive and can help a student learn their favorite music in minutes.”\n\n“The website is set up much like a MasterClass and is led by individuals with expertise in their fields. It is modern and keeping up with the times which allows for more widespread learning of a certain subject. The music offered on The Very Best Piano Instruction incorporates a wide range of music pieces from classical, to modern, to soundtrack and to alternative. This is uncommon and what initially drew me to the website.\n\nWhen I learned piano, I was taught to follow only the Royal Conservatory and I felt like I missed out on the opportunity to tap into other categories such as jazz or alternative music. The site offers these other facets and makes it inclusive to a wide range of individuals who aren’t just focused on classical music. Further, the intro video allows for you to know exactly what you are paying for and what pieces you have access to. The ability to offer some free lessons prior to signing up also differentiates this website from other sites which focus more on your membership than prioritizing your learning experience. I would highly recommend this website for those interested in seriously pursuing musical composition as well as for those who have sparked an interest and are learning for the first time.”\n\n“My name is Zach Taylor and I’m a professional drummer and music teacher. I’d like to start by saying I love Paul’s passion for piano and creating an accessible platform for musicians and non-musicians of any level to learn and enjoy piano. Some things I appreciate are the word graph notation, simplified songs options, and play along instructional videos. The Very Best Piano Instruction is a great resource for me to develop my own skills and provides excellent materials to use with my students. I would definitely recommend checking out this site!”\n\n“I played bass for a band growing up and have lately been trying to learn piano by using some of the how to play piano sites I found online. I found their instruction complicated, boring, and dry it made me want to quit learning. I discovered The Very Best Piano Instruction.com and found it very different. I like the way the keys light up which makes following along easy, the ability to control the playback speed of the video, and was quite surprised by the big collection of pieces offered. It gets rid of the need for an in-person instructor and allows you to learn at your own pace which is very important. Overall, the website is stellar and the creators did a great job including content suitable for all age groups and skill levels.“\n\n“TheVeryBestPianoInstruction.com is an incredibly comprehensive and user-friendly resource. The introduction video was very thorough and gave a good overview of how to use the resources on the website. The videos and previews themselves were high quality with great sound. When I took the Million Dreams piano course, the video break down was very cognitive and helpful for learning not just the notes but the flow of the song. The shadow behind the keys was incredibly natural and made following the instructor very easy.\n\nI am a musician and music teacher, but for violin; and while I can read sheet music, I’ve struggle with the bass clef and with reading music for piano in the past. The Word Notation tool was absolutely fantastic for me. It helped me to easily understand and grasp the bass clef in much less time than it would take me to figure it out on the sheet music. I think the method developed for this site is going to make music much more accessible to people, especially adult students who struggle with learning sheet music. I’m really happy I found this site and will definitely be using it regularly to expand my ability to play the piano. I also sing, so I’ve been wanting to learn instruments that are more conducive to accompanying myself than a violin. Beautiful website.”\n\n“Since I discovered this site, I bought and have been practicing 5 level 3 classical songs and really love the way the material is presented. You can familiarize yourself with a song by watching it being played in very slow motion then print the sheet music and take it to the piano where you can study and memorize it. So much better and easier than the piano apps I’ve tried. I read the About Us Page and the story of how this method of learning was developed was quite interesting. I recommend this site.“\n\n“Okay, so I would like to begin by saying thank you! I am a beginner pianist, and the video’s were spot on in helping me understand keynotes. I’ve listened to my grandmother play as a child and could see the passion and flame she had but couldn’t quite replicate it. Watching the tutorials and starting over from scratch helped me feel that passion of my late grandmother and I truly will be visiting your website for many many hours to come. Thank you.”\n\n“My name is Nilam and I have always wanted to learn to play piano. This website provides a platform to easily access tons of pieces from a single platform. There are 11 professional players on the website and all play songs you can learn in their specific genre and most also teach courses in their expertise. The genres are surprisingly large and include classical, jazz, contemporary music and blues. I had never used the Word Notation before coming across this website and learned it easily and learned to play one of the free songs Liberstraum N0.3. The video testimonials come in clutch in explaining how to learn a song. Probably my favorite part of the entire concept is not having to be bombarded with a subscription fee.\n\nI have already recommended this site to friends of mine who are also interested in learning piano because of how well organized it is and easy of use. In conclusion, the website is delightful and I had a lot of fun going through it and learning music along the way. Great Job to the creators!!!”\n\n“A couple of things that stand out on this website are how well planned the lay out is and I had little to no trouble navigating thru the material. Also, the website is quite full with songs in different genres and covers pretty much everything which is great. The site has a full list of musicians who offer their knowledge with attached courses ranging from inversions to jazz voicings. The video on How to Use the Word Notation sums up quite well how to read it in a concise 3-minute presentation. All in all, I liked the experience a lot and would recommend this site to my musical friends in no time.”\n\n“I am so glad that I stumbled across this site. When I was younger, I had an interest in playing the piano but felt discouraged because learning sheet music wasn’t easy for me. But after all these years that feeling of wanting to play piano never left me so to come across theverybestpianoinstruction.com is a Godsend. I’ve always hesitated to buy a piano due to not knowing how I will learn to play, but now, I purchased one with the confidence of a real pianist.\n\nAfter exploring the site, I see Paul put much thought and intention into developing it. I appreciate the intro videos that thoroughly explained how to navigate the website and break things down step by step. Reading the musical notes in this simple form called Word Notation with the ability to slow down the video to a speed that is easy to follow makes learning a song easier. The website features many options when choosing songs and the songs and courses for sale are reasonably priced. When someone is passionate about their work it shows so thanks Paul for creating material that benefits all music lovers. Once I learn a few songs, I look forward to teaching my 5-year-old son.”\n\n“First and foremost, I was impressed with the layout and design of the website. The user interface was clean and easy to navigate which made it easy to find the songs and courses that interested me. The website also offered some songs for free. The videos were clear and concise and the instructors were knowledgeable and engaging and I was blown away by the quality of the instruction. The courses were built upon each other in a logical way which helped me progress quickly and confidently.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this website to anyone looking to learn how to play the piano. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced player, this website is a fantastic resource that will help you improve your piano skills and achieve your musical goals.“\n\n“I played the piano in my youth and I really didn’t enjoy it much. My teacher was a foreign professor and she was strict and nagged me about how I never practiced. Here we are 20 years later and I find myself wishing I just sucked it up and continued because I wish I knew how to play an instrument. When my girlfriend recommended this website to me, I was skeptical but also open minded because I want to learn and continue my musical journey.\n\nI must admit, The Very Best Piano Instruction is very cool and makes learning a lot simpler. I had flashbacks of my nightmare lessons as a kid but realized that the method of teaching and going at your own pace is so important. There’s a ton of teachers to choose from and there’s a ton of pieces to choose from too. The lessons are not super expensive and there is no obligation to commit which is a big positive for me. My girlfriend likes classical piano and I like jazz so it’s nice that the website offers a range of different types of music.\n\nAll in all, the website is great and I really liked the free trial offered. I’m happy it doesn’t ask for payment upfront and allows you to try it for free without putting in credit card information. Good job to the developers of this site.”\n\n“As someone who loves the idea of playing the piano but procrastinated learning because of the perceived difficulty and my short attention span, I was excited to come across theverybestpianoinstruction.com. This website is great in so many ways.\n\nThe instructional videos are comprehensive and thorough without being too lengthy-THANK YOU!\n\nThe instructions use everyday language-THANK YOU!\n\nThe videos display the back shadow and the letter of the keys being played-THANK YOU!\n\nNO SHEET MUSIC-THANK YOU!\n\nThe videos are segmented into parts, and I control the speed and video quality-THANK YOU!\n\nFor the FREE Trial-THANK YOU!\n\nMore expansive song collection-THANK YOU!\n\nThe homepage is visually appealing and very intuitive. I appreciate that it has steps 1-3 videos to guide me through the site. One of the first things I noticed was the large “Catch the chance to learn piano” video, which made me chuckle and put me in a slightly better mood. It is evident that theverybestpianoinstruction.com is the product of love, passion, dedication, and collaboration. This website really lives up to its name!”\n\n“I’ve wanted to improve my piano skills for several years after studying jazz saxophone in college. Between a few lessons as a young person, playing around with keyboards, and passing some basic proficiency classes, I had mixed experience before my time with The Very Best Piano Instruction. Not quite a beginner, not quite advanced, experience playing another instrument, and some knowledge of chords and harmony.\n\nI also took great interest in Scott Grube’s Blues course. Playing blues, jazz, and specifically boogie-woogie is a dream that always seemed beyond my reach. This lesson features some authentic playing by the teacher and is jam packed with essential musical vocabulary and stylistic nuance. He instructs not only the basics of the style and some riffs to get started, but how to develop your own individual sound within the genre. Instead of teaching just one blues song, he shows techniques and concepts that can be applied to any repertoire and style. This video course had me jamming in no time!\n\nThe videos are well made and thoughtfully edited. The pace of the media player is just right and includes repeated sections and built-in “slow-downs” that sound good and retain pitch. The lighting and sound are pleasant and I was surprised at how effective the shadow fell on the depressed keys, leaving no questions or room for error in telling what notes the teacher is playing at any given time. This is essential for figuring out chords and harmony of the tune without needing to stare at sheet music. I was able to find courses that spoke directly to my goals of improving as a piano player while barely scratching the surface of what the site can offer.“\n\n“The very best piano instruction website is a worthy introduction to those who are looking to begin their foray into the magical world of piano. It is especially helpful to those who are coming to music without any training or prior exposure to music theory, sight-reading, or a keyboard. Gathering a variety of musical genres, songs, and courses in one site allows the learner to customize their education and progress at their own pace.\n\nAs a piano teacher, I appreciate that there are two options for learning the songs: musically notated pieces for those who might have some familiarity with sight-reading, as well as Microsoft word notation graph which allows you to learn how to play without reading sheet music. I am struck by the simplicity and clarity of the playback model, which ensures that upon hearing the piece, it plays again automatically on slow motion. This allows you to “hear” the piece with more attention and grasp the musical structure while training your eyes to follow along with the shadowed keys being played. All in all, The Very Best Piano Instruction is a notable entry to the world of piano education online. Try it out and see!”"
