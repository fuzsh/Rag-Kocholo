        "text": "25 Jun â€“ Following the release of Gillian Chung's Mandarin ballad album, \"Tung Blossom\", comes her Twins counterpart, Charlene Choi's solo Cantonese album titled \"Blooming\".\n\nGroove Asia reported that the 30-year-old Charlene explained that the title and concept of her album reflects her current state of womanhood, saying, \"I am at that age where a woman starts to bloom and gives off a feminine charm.\"\n\nUnlike Gillian, who sings of sorrow and lost love, Charlene's musical choices are slightly more eclectic.\n\n\"A lot of thought and dedication are put into the compositions, in order to bring forward the exoticness of the music.\"\n\nThis is evident through the songs composed by her usual collaborators; Eric Kwok and Riley Lam, as well as the other famed musicians she invited to work on the album, including YLK Organisation's Keith Chan, Alex Fung, Pong Nan and The Island.\n\nSongs that have received positive feedback are Keith Chan's \"Alive\", \"Mistaken\", which is The Island's first collaboration with Charlene, as well as \"Intelligent Fool\", composed and written by Charlene's traditional working partners, Eric Kwok and Riley Lam respectively. Meanwhile, Alex Fung and Pong Nan worked together for the rock song \"To Be Kind To Women\".\n\nApart from the 10 songs, the album also includes the music videos for \"Alive\", \"Mistaken\", \"Intelligent Fool\", \"To Be Kind To Women\" and \"Mist\"."
