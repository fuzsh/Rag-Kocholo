        "text": "Isn't it amazing how wisdom speaks to us in so many ways?\n\nHave you ever had a song suddenly start playing in your mind? I’m pretty sure we’ve all had this experience sometime. It happened to me this morning with Peter, Paul, and Mary’s folk version of Rock My Soul.\n\nRock my soul in the bosom of Abraham…\n\nOh rock my soul…\n\nSo high can’t get over it\n\nSo low can’t get under it\n\nSo wide can’t get round it\n\nOh rock my soul...\n\nI hadn’t heard this song since 1969, when a hundred or so other St. Bonaventure students and I sang along with The Wooden Nickel performances on Saturday nights at the O.H. in Olean, New York.\n\nBack then, I didn’t know what the “it” was in\n\n“can’t get over it…under it…or round it.”\n\nAnd I still don’t know for sure.\n\nBut this morning I got a clue–at least about what “it” meant to me in the moment.\n\nI was feeling a deep hurt.\n\nWhen the song started “playing,” it felt like wisdom, gently guiding.\n\n“Don’t try to ignore, deny, or stifle the hurting,” it said.\n\n“You can’t climb over it, sneak under it, or run around it.\n\nAnd it’s best not to.”\n\nUpon hearing the inner music, I got it.\n\nIt is what it is and I need to let it be… as another song goes, speaking words of wisdom.\n\nLet it be. Let it be, sang the Beatles.\n\nYes. Let it be.\n\nWhen hurt fills you, what do you do?\n\nPerhaps these songs sound true for you too.\n\nInstead of trying to escape or suppress pain,\n\nwe can breathe, let it be,\n\nand let ourselves be cradled in compassion and rocked by Love Itself.\n\nWishing you all of life's gifts and wonders, today and every day.\n\nAnd, may your soul be gently rocked."
