        "text": "The song is universally panned here on DL, but out of curiosity I went to youtube for the song and looked at the comments. People were saying the song brings tears to their eyes and how moving it is. And they weren't being sarcastic they were serious.\n\nI don't get the huge discrepancy in how this song is viewed?\n\nWhen it first came out, it rode a frau wave of “my life hasn’t turned out like I had wanted.” It tapped into the fantasy life of many middle aged women.\n\nGay men have an entirely different relationship with the song. They can identify with “I’ve spent my life exploring the subtle whoring” yet they affirm how maudlin, yet cheesy, the song really is.\n\nThis song could have only gotten attention in the 1970s genre when these type songs were popular (much like I am woman, hear me roar). If it had been released in mid-1980s, it would have been laughed right out of the recording studio.\n\nI love the song, but really in a nostalgic way, since I was a kid when it came out. In reality, it is a terrible, schmaltzy, sexist song that tells women that if they don't get married and have children they will regret it:\n\nBut you know what truth is?\n\nIt's that little baby you're holding\n\nAnd it's that man you fought with this morning\n\nThe same one you are gonna make love to tonight\n\nThat's truth that's love\n\nDon't travel the world, don't learn things, don't stretch beyond the limited expectations for your sex or:\n\nSometimes I've been to crying for unborn children\n\nThat might have made me complete\n\nReally dreadful.\n\nIt went to #1 in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the UK.\n\nOddly enough though, while it got to #3 in the US on Cashbox and Billboard it only got to #7 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nCharlene had recorded \"I've Never Been to Me\" in 1976 for her debut album, the self-titled Charlene, a Prodigal release (P6 10015S1), and the ballad contained a spoken section. \"Songs of Love\" came out six months later in 1977 and was essentially a re-issue of Charlene, having a slightly different track listing but retaining \"I've Never Been to Me\" without the spoken bridge.\n\nThe Hot 100 peak of \"I've Never Been to Me\" in its original formal release without the monologue was #97\n\n[quote]In 1982, Scott Shannon, a disc jockey at Tampa radio station WRBQ-FM, began playing the \"I've Never Been to Me\" track off the Charlene album (with the original recitative), and response from local listeners was such as to motivate Shannon, a former Motown employee, to alert Motown president Jay Lasker to the track's hit potential. Lasker located Charlene who, discouraged by the poor performance of her 1977 Motown releases and by the label's decision not to release a second album she had recorded, had left the music industry and met and married an Englishman, subsequently accompanying him to England and taking a job at a sweetshop in Ilford.\n\nIt subsequently rose as high as No. 3 on the Hot 100, where it held for three weeks during May and June, prevented from further chart movement by \"Don't Talk to Strangers\" by Rick Springfield and \"Ebony and Ivory\" by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder.\n\nI remember hearing this song on the radio in the station wagon as my mom drove me to the grocery store. It had a nice melody and the lady's singing voice was pleasant.\n\nHowever, the lyrics are a shit show. This woman has done fucking EVERYTHING and now she's whining that she doesn't have a husband to cook and clean for and that she didn't pop out a kid. The song is a Republican chauvinist's dream: the only path to happiness for a woman is to get married, pop out babies and dedicate your life to being your husband's subservient helpmeet, maid, and nanny. Forget a career and wild experiences...those things are for men.\n\nI could tell this shit was awful even when I was nine. I mean, there was schmaltzy stuff in the Top 40 of the time (Journey's \"Open Arms,\" etc) but this was on a whole other level. It wasn't fun pop like Sheena Easton or Olivia or Kim Carnes. I didn't have a clue what camp was back then, or I would have immediately recognized it as that. The cutesy, affected vocal; the nauseatingly saccharine arrangement; the clumsy, overwrought, moralizing lyrics. It remains a mystery why anyone dug this ungainly monstrosity out from the dustbin of history and why it became a hit years later. I guess resurgent conservatism is the only thing that can explain it.\n\nHy mama, hey mama\n\nInsta-ing your mundane life\n\ngotta be a perfect mother\n\ngotta be a perfect wife\n\nYou dream about the things you'll never do\n\nI wish someone told me that college and nice clothes are overrated like I want to tell you.\n\nOoh, I've been to college and stores that weren't Walmart and I've been on a plane.\n\nTook the hand of a man with no neckbeard\n\nAnd had sex without getting knocked up\n\nBut I ran out of places and friendly faces\n\nBecause I had to be free\n\nAll the unemployed overweight mamas didn't like their husbands looking at me.\n\nPlease lady please Karen\n\nDon't just walk away\n\n'Cause I have this need to tell you\n\nWhy I'm all alone today\n\nwith a fat bank account\n\nand time to spend with my friends and creative hobbies\n\nBut a couple of them could have been potential children if she had gotten laid at the right time without using birth control, R78.\n\nInstead, she responsibly used birth control, and it worked. But now she and the other lady are both experiencing that feeling that \"the grass is greener on the other side\". The lady posts in reddit everyday about how her husband plays video games all day and won't help take care of the kids.\n\nThat was DREADFUL, R20. I never knew there was a male version, let alone that it came before the one I know and love (yeah, I love some campy schmaltz occasionally).\n\nR37 I can tell he had a potentially good voice, but by had no idea or at least no direction in the way he used it. Embarrassing. And he had been in \"Dallas\" recently at that point, and had had a Hollywood career of course, but a \"farewell tour\"? How many people came out to see that?!\n\nR38 Thanks for sharing that! I love a deep dive from time to time, and I enjoy a bit of backstory. Charlene seems sweet, and it was nice to hear it from her.\n\nNope. Just like it's not illegal to point out that a troll (or a troll cohort) is obsessed with it, and serially spams the Datalounge with threads about it.\n\nI don't dislike the song. I read a couple of those threads with interest, and even responded on one or two of them. But here it is again, and I have no doubt this won't be the last one. But you have to admit that repeatedly starting threads about the same topic dozens of times, some only a few weeks apart, is trolling.\n\n[quote]No, keep going. Give us that dressing down, King.\n\nUnlike some, I know when enough's enough.\n\nYou're seriously stung - look at the continuing comebacks at R179, R180, and R181.\n\nAnd look! a far right sock at R182. :D\n\nGo fix your mascara, hon - weeping makes it run. You look like a raccoon.\n\nHey, you know what paradise is? It's FAN-FUCKIN' TASTIC\n\nA fantasy I've lived about people and places, that are better than imagined\n\nBut you know what truth is? That babies crap and smell bad\n\nAnd it's that man you fought with this morning, that knifes you and gets off because the glove doesn't fit\n\nThat's truth that's love\n\n[quote] [R37] I can tell he had a potentially good voice, but by had no idea or at least no direction in the way he used it. Embarrassing. And he had been in \"Dallas\" recently at that point, and had had a Hollywood career of course, but a \"farewell tour\"? How many people came out to see that?!\n\nI'd say Keel was probably much more popular in the UK than the US. During his time on Dallas he released two top forty albums in the UK, and another that peaked at #51. He also had successful concert tours of the UK, at the time. So I'd imagine, a farewell tour was warranted. And that clip is from the perfect show. I'd imagine Bruce Forsyth and Keel probably appealed to similar audiences.\n\nSome of the lyrics are bad, but they are in the original one as well. I think Keel's rendition is pretty good, because the song sorta screams for an older person to sing it.\n\nSomeone up above mentioned Fancy and it does feel like the flipside of that story. In Fancy you have a whore that is satisfied with her life, in this one the whore isn't. I would now, like to hear Reba cover it. Also. Charlene in the music video looks like she stole Loretta Lynn's dress from Coal Miner's Daughter."
