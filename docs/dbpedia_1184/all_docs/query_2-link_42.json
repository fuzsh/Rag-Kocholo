        "text": "Q: What are you working on at the moment?\n\nA: I'm working on my own album at the moment. And lots of demos, backup vocal jobs and topline gigs here on Soundbetter.\n\nQ: Analog or digital and why?\n\nA: I'm an old soul at heart so I wish the whole world was in analog. But digital makes things go easier and connects us all. So I guess I'm for both.\n\nQ: What's your 'promise' to your clients?\n\nA: You will like the results very much. That's my goal.\n\nQ: What questions do you ask prospective clients?\n\nA: I usually ask about the direction and vision they have for the track to see how I can fit into that and to determine if I am the right one to bring your project to life. I do not blindly say yes to every job that comes my way. Music is about doing the best possible for the project, not about making money.\n\nQ: What was your career path? How long have you been doing this?\n\nA: I have been doing this over 15 years! And I love it. It never gets old for me. This is my true profession and the only work I do for a living.\n\nQ: Which artist would you like to work with and why?\n\nA: Radiohead! I have been a big fan for years. They are unique and every record they put out has a concept to it that is strange and amazing. I like experimental artists.\n\nQ: What's your typical work process?\n\nA: I listen first to any references you send. This is key! Listening is important, to understand the vibe you want, your direction and what you are looking for. I always do this before recording any project. I like to know about what you want to achieve, what the feeling of the song is. I look at the lyrics and their meaning. I take all this into account before recording anything. I also rehearse a bit before I record. For some songs I find it best to rehearse and learn it and then record it on a different day. There is something good about that \"sink in\" time that some projects need.\n\nQ: Tell us about a project you worked on you are especially proud of and why. What was your role?\n\nA: I recently did a topline for a song for a producer in London. I was really proud of how it turned out because we gave each other space and freedom to do what we feel and the result was fresh and creative. That's how music should be.\n\nQ: Tell us about your studio setup.\n\nA: You can hear acapella samples from my set up right here: https://soundcloud.com/really-good-vocals/sets/acapella-examples/s-15TBM\n\nQ: Can you share one music production tip?\n\nA: LISTEN. Understand the project you are working on before you record a thing. That's the strongest thing that can be done for any music production.\n\nQ: How would you describe your style?\n\nA: I would say it's always emotion driven no matter what genre I'm working on. I like to feel my way through any song I'm singing. A song is a monologue and all singers should learn the craft of acting because the song must be felt and lived through the whole way.\n\nQ: What type of music do you usually work on?\n\nA: I work on all types of pop and rock songs. I sing a lot of jingles too.\n\nQ: What's your strongest skill?\n\nA: Performing the song as I said, but I'm also very good with arranging harmonies. I do it most often in a spontaneous way, going with my gut and how I feel.\n\nQ: What do you like most about your job?\n\nA: That I get to bring your song to life! I like to hear a rough demo or guide vocal and transform it. I really never tire of putting headphones on and getting in front of the mic. I like the way different songs bring out different emotions and expressions to work with.\n\nQ: What's the biggest misconception about what you do?\n\nA: That any good singer can record a song for you. Live singing and studio singing are very different! It's a completely different skill and through much experience it can be done effectively.\n\nQ: What advice do you have for a customer looking to hire a provider like you?\n\nA: Have everything prepared and know what you want. Make sure you have a scratch vocal as a guide and a track that is well quantized so I can sing to it. Also, know your BPM and make sure you tell me that info too. Dig through references and tell me what you envision.\n\nQ: Is there anyone on SoundBetter you know and would recommend to your clients?\n\nA: Yes! I have some friends on SoundBetter! If I'm not suitable for the job,I can willingly recommend someone who is.\n\nQ: If you were on a desert island and could take just 5 pieces of gear, what would they be?\n\nA: A microphone and a big amplifier and an electric guitar and a loop pedal and a notebook/pen. And yes, a notebook/pen is a piece gear and a very important piece of gear! Writing lyrics and just writing any stream of consciousness is important in any creative process.\n\nQ: What do you bring to a song?\n\nA: Performance, emotion. This is a very important ingredient that a lot recording artists forget about. It's not just about the technical skill, it's about bringing the meaning of the song alive. Because I've sung so much in the studio, I really have a knack for bringing a song alive on tape. I also work as an actor, so to me a song is a monologue, it has an expression and purpose. It must be connected to something real inside in order for the emotion to come across authentically.\n\nQ: What other musicians or music production professionals inspire you?\n\nA: I'm most inspired by independent artists who go their own way, who write music with a message that is connected to something inside them. Music is expression and should be entirely original. I'm into underground artists with grit and feel. I prefer this to overly polished commercial styles.\n\nQ: Describe the most common type of work you do for your clients.\n\nA: I sing on a lot of pop and rock song demos. I also do a lot of jingle and commercial work. I understand the difference of singing those things, it's not the same approach. I'm also really skilled in harmony arrangements. Another major area I work in is kid's music which requires another vocal tone too. :-)"
