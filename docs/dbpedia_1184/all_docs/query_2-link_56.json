        "text": "MANILA, PHILIPPINES ‚Äî Pop-R&B songstress Charlene Su has finally dropped her debut EP titled onlyfriends, with four songs that promise to be absolute bops.\n\nAside from subtly and cheekily referencing the popular, albeit raunchy online platform, OnlyFans, onlyfriends came about through collaboration among friends. Looking through the writers, you can see why. ‚ÄúTo me, collaboration is the best part about music,‚Äù says Charlene, as she likes to think of songwriting as self-expression through shared human experience.\n\n‚ÄúWe have all felt disappointment and the ache of heartbreak before, be it unrequited feelings for a crush or even within friendships. I think of this EP as my coping mechanism of sorts for that disappointment; it‚Äôs really just me whining and trying to get over my feelings in a very melodic, pop way.‚Äù\n\nCharlene Su‚Äôs onlyfriends EP also includes the R&B jam ‚Äúbitter baby,‚Äù whose laid-back beats and tropical-sounding production drip with sensual confidence, and the earlier released tracks ‚Äúiwas4u‚Äù and ‚Äúilikered.‚Äù\n\nThe music video for ‚Äúsay it back‚Äù will be released on 25th August 2021 together with a live- streamed performance of the EP. The new song off Su‚Äôs new EP, features Universal Music Singapore‚Äôs up-and-coming singer-songwriter and producer YA√ò.\n\nAbout Charlene Su\n\nCharlene has been writing songs and dreaming up bedroom bops since her teen years. With her candy-coated vocals sitting atop a spirited hybrid of modern pop, R&B and lo-fi, she has drawn audiences from all across Asia with her unfiltered, unadulterated charm.\n\nWith success in the cards both in a tech start-up career as well as with music, Charlene worked to balance both priorities over the past few years before deciding in 2021 to focus on her efforts on her passion for art.\n\nStraying from the downtempo roots with which she first made her name, the Singaporean artist has turned her vocal prowess towards a series of intimate and infinitely catchy soundscapes, crafted with care for today‚Äôs digital music landscape. Her fresh, decidedly distinct, and vibrant pop-princess sound is bound to captivate audiences across the globe.\n\nAt the end of the day, Charlene hopes to make honest music that both entices and empowers. With lyrics that feel and beats that truly bop, she remains one to watch in this exciting new age of pop music."
