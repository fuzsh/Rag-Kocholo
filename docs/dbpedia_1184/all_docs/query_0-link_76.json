        "text": "Since forming in 2015, Montreal duo Heather Foster Kirkpatrick and Dylan Konrad Obront – aka Sorry Girls – have received acclaim from the likes of Pitchfork whilst consistently honing and developing their distinctive sound. Now, set to release their new album in June, they continue to charm our ears with their lilting heartfelt offerings, such as recent single ‘Prettier Things’. Reflecting on being honest with yourself, it oozes a glistening splendour as Heather’s crystalline sugar-sweet vocals ripple with a stirring emotion throughout, reminiscent of the catchy alt-folk of Jenny Lewis. An instant earworm, ‘Prettier Things’ showcases Sorry Girls’ ability to create truly blissful soundscapes, luring the listener in with their immersive twinkling grace.\n\nWe think one of the best ways to get to know an artist is by asking what music inspires them. So, to celebrate the upcoming new album, we caught up with Heather from Sorry Girls to ask about the music that has inspired her the most. So, read about her five favourite ever albums, and check out the beautifully hand-crafted video for ‘Prettier Things’ below…\n\nArthur Russell – Love Is Overtaking Me\n\nThis album has to be an all-time favourite for me, and Arthur Russell an ever-evolving all-encompassing HUGE influence for me musically. I’ve carried this album and all of its different songs with me across many chapters of my life. I first heard Arthur Russell in 2015 or so while I was having a nap mid-recording at one of Dylan’s (of Sorry Girls) old apartments, listening to his iTunes Library on shuffle. I heard ’That’s Us / Wild Combination’ and jumped up from my nap and was so excited and thought it was so beautiful. Then, after only really listening to World of Echo and Calling out of Context, I first heard the opening track to ‘Love is Overtaking Me’ on our first tour, where we drove and camped our way across Canada. A friend of ours picked up the guitar and played ‘Close my Eyes’ as we were all nestled around the campfire, and I was in awe because I thought he had written it. I’ve always been really attracted to country music and a sort of “classic” poem-like song and I feel like this is what Arthur Russell is amazing at, especially on this album. I’ve listened to each of the songs countless times over the years since and I don’t know if there is an album I love more than this one. Every song is beautiful, unique and captivating.\n\nJohn Prine – The Tree Of Forgiveness\n\nSomehow I missed out on John Prine for most of my life, but this album is gut-wrenching. I love that I found him on his last album because it adds a lot to the experience of it and contextualises a lot of the themes throughout the album. And I honestly think it has some of his best songs: ‘Summer’s End’ and ‘I Have Met my Love Today’ are beautiful songs with gorgeous words on mortality, love and endings sung in his gravelly ageing voice. I think a common thread in the music I love is imagination and playfulness – songwriters that can mix poetic words with a sense of magic and absurdity. I guess, music with a sense of humour. I love the eclectic mix of genres, and I love that his music has a feeling of levity mixed with a grounding sense of emotional honesty.\n\nCaroline Polacheck – Pang\n\nI am a huge fan of pop, especially of the avant-garde/ art-pop variety. I feel like this album kind of encompasses all of those influences, and seems similarly influenced by artists such as Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Imogen Heap, Dido etc, whilst also being super grounded in the current pop sound. It presents a kinship to the old while innovating, which is something I really appreciate. This album deals a lot with the idea of transition and it carried me through a very transitional time in my life where I was dealing with carving identity and moving through heavy emotions, and I feel like this album is a perfect anthem for this kind of pursuit. Not to mention the amazing songwriting and out-of-this-world voice with seeming built-in theremin. I love.\n\nThe Complete Stax / Volt Soul Singles Vol. 2\n\nIt might be kind of cheating to feature a compilation BUT this one has two of my all-time favourite songs – ‘Love Changes’ by Charlene And The Soul Serenaders and ‘Just the Way You are Today’ by Barbara Lewis, which I found through this particular compilation. Soul music has been a huge inspiration for me and is the music that drew me in and captivated me the most as a child. I have so many memories of dancing to soul and Motown in my parents’ living room, and to this day it’s still the genre of music that moves me the most.\n\nAlex G – God Save The Animals\n\nSince this album came out I have almost not listened to anything else. It’s full of so much sincerity, creativity and energy and has such a mix of genres and sounds that feel really honest, but also innovative and exciting. I feel really fired up when I listen to it and it has really set the bar for me recently as a standard for the musical integrity and vibrancy I am striving for. It’s so much fun!\n\nMassive thanks to Heather from Sorry Girls for sharing her Five Favourites! Watch the video for ‘Prettier Things’ here:\n\nBravo!, the upcoming new album from Sorry Girls, is set for release on 2nd June via Arbutus Records.\n\nPhoto Credit: Japhy Saretsky\n\nBuilding upon the dream-pop melodies of the Vancouver duo known as Mu, that have taken us on various adventures in the tragedies of youth, Canadian singer-songwriter Francesca Belcourt now creates under a new musical moniker – Tiberius b.\n\nHaving now shared beautifully reflective, nostalgia laden new single ‘No Smoke’, they have showcased their ability to create utterly dreamy atmospheric soundscapes.\n\nWe think one of the best ways to get to know an artist is by asking what music inspires them or influences their writing. We caught up with Francesca, who has shared their “Five Favourites” – five tracks or albums that particularly resonate with them. Check out their choices below, and scroll down to listen to latest single ‘No Smoke’ at the end of this post.\n\nNelly Furtado – Woah, Nelly!\n\nI received this CD along with my first disc-man. I listened to it front to back for the first time over and over and over again on a road trip to Tofino with my family, and was entranced. To be honest, I never really understood what she was saying until revisiting the record recently, but I think her unabashed progressive lyrics mixed with her insane delivery/voice must have impacted me on a subconscious level… Everybody knows ‘I’m Like A Bird’, but everything she says across the whole record is so poignant and empowered. She also grew up on Vancouver Island which is very close to where I’m from.\n\nSOPHIE – ‘Is It Cold In The Water?’\n\nThis was my favourite song of 2018. SOPHIE and Cecile Believe are both geniuses. I had the honour of working with Cecile on my upcoming album right before Oil Of Every Pearls Un Insides came out. When I heard ‘Is it Cold In The Water?’ for the first time after coming back from our residency, I was devastated by its tragic and gorgeous intensity.\n\nPortishead – ‘The Rip’\n\nI grew up listening to the albums Portishead and Dummy heavily. They were in the collection of CDs that my parents brought from London to Canada which soundtracked the lonely stretches of my childhood. I felt proud to embrace my creepy dark feelings when as I listened to them. Discovering ‘The Rip’ in adulthood helped reunite me with those early memories, and is my current favourite song by them.\n\nArthur Russel – ‘Close My Eyes’\n\nI love this song because it is perfect, but also because it encourages me every time I hear it to be unafraid to explore whatever type of music that I’m inspired to create. I admire that Arthur never withheld himself from approaching and releasing a vast range of styles.\n\nUnderworld – ‘Born Slippy’ (Nuxx)\n\nOne of my favourite songs off of the Trainspotting soundtrack, another album of the dad CD collection which I adored as a kid. We used to dance in the kitchen and make pancakes to this. Growing up listening to dance music made me feel quite free when I entered actual club environments, knowing how to express myself with my body.\n\nMassive thanks to Francesca for sharing their choices with us!\n\nListen to ‘No Smoke’, the captivating new track from Tiberius b here:\n\nNorwegian newcomer Sea Change is skilled at crafting atmospheric, transformative, electronic sounds. She’s set to release her new album INSIDE on 15th November, and if recent singles ‘Stepping Out’ and ‘Flown’ are anything to go by, it’ll be filled with intriguing synth textures, longing vocals, and irresistible lo-fi beats.\n\nSea Change (aka Ellen Sunde) wrote her new album after she relocated to Berlin, and during her many trips back and forth to LA; resulting in seven tracks that meander through intimate and stimulating personal territories.\n\nWe think one of the best ways to get to know an artist is by asking what music inspired them to write in the first place. We caught up with Ellen to ask her about her “Five Favourites” – five albums that have influenced her song writing techniques. Check out her choices below, and scroll down to listen to her latest track ‘Flown’ at the end of this post.\n\n1. PJ Harvey – Is This Desire / 4-Track Demos\n\nDiscovering PJ Harvey at 16 made my whole world turn around. Before that, I loved music and I knew that I needed to do music myself, but I’d never heard anything by a female voice or musician that I loved with all my heart (how sad is that !?). But then I discovered PJ Harvey and the way she sang and made her music was so gut wrenching and vulnerable and beautiful and horrible at the same time; I realized that I don’t have to sing in a pretty voice to make music. When I heard Is This Desire, it was like – yes – this is the music I’m gonna make. Everything kind of fell into place when I discovered her. She taught me that being raw and honest is what makes amazing art. She has a special place in my heart.\n\n2. Sidsel Endresen & Bugge Wesseltoft – Duplex Ride / Out There. In There.\n\nAt 18 I started to discover more and more experimental music and in Norway. There’s an amazing improv and jazz scene. I discovered Sidsel Endresen which is an experimental jazz singer. I think the way she uses silence and minimalism in her music is incredible. She is an amazing improviser, it’s super intuitive. In her music there’s nothing of that showing off-virtuosity you can often find in jazz music, but it’s actually something that comes from her heart. And I think she also taught me to not give a crap about what other people think, and to do your own thing. Her lyrics are also utterly beautiful.\n\n3. Arthur Russell – World Of Echo\n\nArthur Russel makes the perfect blend of club music/disco/experimental and vulnerability. He has something that I can’t explain. His music and lyricism is so naive and beautiful in it’s simplicity, and I love that it’s electronic music but it has this off-kilter and strange vibe. It sounds like he is improvising and jamming by himself in his living room, and it’s so rare to listen to electronic music that is so unperfected. His songs don’t really have one proper studio version, they have about 10 different ones that make his artistry so utterly interesting. He has a mixture of authority, intuition and vulnerability in his music that I will always strive after, ‘cos its so explosive in an artist. I recently heard that he will be releasing a new mix of unreleased songs/demos on the 15th of November (the same day I’m releasing my record!) and I can’t wait to listen.\n\n4. Noise/Improv/Lasse Marhaug/Noxakt/Kevin Drumm\n\nI need to put in this on the list but it’s more of a state of mind/genre than albums or tracks. Most of this music I’ve experienced live. When I moved to Oslo at 19 I started to go to improv and noise concerts. Oslo has an amazing experimental scene and it was really cool to be able to go to so many shows that were so well curated. There’s a rawness and punk atmosphere to this music that I love, and to be able to just close my eyes and dive into a world of raw sound is incredible. This was also at the same time I started making music myself. When I started playing live I usually had parts in the live sets that were ambient and drone like (it’s surprisingly hard to make something that actually sounds good). This music is best to experience live. I think it awakes something primal in me, and I’m really happy I went through this musical phase cos it taught me so much about what music can be and that it has no limits!\n\n5. Fever Ray – Plunge\n\nI’m such a huge fan of Fever Ray, it’s kind of embarrassing. When she all of the sudden dropped PLUNGE in 2017 I was listening to the record over and over for days. I can’t remember last time I had this obsession with a record, since I was in my teens I guess, and that is the most amazing feeling. I love what she’s challenging both musically and lyrically. There was a music journalist that wrote that this record was like jumping into cold water, and I really love that allegory. This record hit me in the chest and I think it came at a time in my life when I really needed it and it also influenced my newest record a lot. I love how she blends club music, pop music and listening music and makes her own breed of art with her explosive visual narrative. She is a HUGE inspiration!\n\nI saw her live recently and she had a seven piece band with only female musicians, and I remember how shocked I was with how shocked I was. How have I never seen that before!? And that made me realize that hell, from now on I’m only gonna have female musicians on stage. Her first record was amazing and Its still a piece of art that stands steady as a rock, and I find myself going back to it over and over again.\n\nThanks to Ellen for sharing her favourites with us.\n\nFollow Sea Change on Facebook for more updates.\n\nPhoto Credit: Fotini Chora"
