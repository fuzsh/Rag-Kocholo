        "text": "Infotable\n\nHey there!\n\nI’m Charlene, a film composer and singer-songwriter. I am dedicated to the art of interweaving music with narratives, and I love writing diverse styles of music that would best serve the picture.\n\nI recently graduated from the University of Liverpool with a joint honours degree in Music and Communication, focusing on film scoring. Prior to that, I spent a year at The University of Western Australia, majoring in Electronic Music and Sound Design. Currently, I’m undertaking my Masters in Screen Scoring at USC, and being privately mentored by Andy Hill (ex-vice-president of music production at Disney). With my experience, I can offer a classic Hollywood/Disney orchestral main theme, hybrid electroacoustic piece, pop/alternative end credits song, and much more.\n\nCollaborations are central to my creative process. Most recently, my piece \"Summer of the Earth,\" written for a wildlife documentary short, was performed live-to-picture at an International Women’s Day concert (a collaboration between the University of Liverpool and the Alliance for Women Film Composers). As I continue my journey at USC, I’m so excited to be learning and growing with fellow creatives, and forging longstanding connections. If there’s any style of music you don’t see in my portfolio - reach out anyway! I truly love writing new styles of music for different genres of film.\n\nIn my free time, I am either knee-deep in a novel or on the hunt for the best plate of pasta. You can check out more of my music at https://www.charlene.works. I'd love to hear all about your project! Feel free to drop me a message at charlene.composer@gmail.com or on my Instagram (@musicbycharlene) - whether it's to discuss which creative world we'd be escaping to over pasta, or to recommend a good book ☺️\n\nPortfolio:"
