        "text": "Description\n\nPeacefrog Records, the label that introduced the world to artists such as JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez and Little Dragon present the new album from Charlene Soraia. The former Brit school singer-songwriter builds on the foundations of her debut album Moonchild by embracing bold new soundscapes and working with a stellar array of co-writers and producers to create a collection of bittersweet, beautifully nuanced love songs. Among the high points on Love Is The Law is the BBC Radio 1 Track of The Day and B listed single, Caged one of 4 songs co-written and produced with Jim Eliot.\n\n\"Caged is an empowering song I wrote whilst looking back at how I broke free from a bad relationship that had emotionally held mecaptive for far too long! I wrote it a couple years after the breakup, and only then truly understood how poisonous and incompatible we were! They didn't want me to leave them and used the fact that I couldn't justify myself at the time against me. I look back now and think \"no wonder I left!!\"â€¦ This song is for every girl out there who has been or is being emotionally blackmailed, confused and fooled by the person they \"love\"â€¦ We must empower ourselves and give ourselves permission to leave these people, places, things that are no longer good for us! You are a beautiful being, with a soul made of the things of stars and you deserve more!â€¦\" Charlene Soraia."
