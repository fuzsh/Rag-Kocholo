        "text": "Vital Stats\n\nAge: Do you really want to know? 68 years young!\n\nInstruments: Trombone (many years ago), piano (since age 4; also taught piano for many years), ukulele, sing bass or baritone (used to sing tenor but now can only whistle it).\n\nGroups: Song of the Coast (SotC) Chorus of Sweet Adelines International -- I'm a certified associate director, approved arranger and bass singer.\n\nBass singer and arranger for the Firecrackers, an a cappella quartet established in 1995. We are never, ever boring, and we sing good, too.\n\nChief Kook, founder and arranger for the Kookyukes, a comedy ensemble established in 1989.\n\nDay job: One can only wish! I'm distracted by being a wife, mom, grandma and great-grandma. Music is a hobby through which I can share the talent with which God has blessed me and bring joy to others.\n\nHometown: Born in Akron, Ohio, but spent most of my life in the Baltimore/Washington area, with a four-year hiatus in Fort Worth.\n\nCurrent residence: Flagler Beach for the last 12 years; moved from Lorton, Va., to the Daytona Beach area in 1986.\n\nType of music you perform: A cappella harmony, sometimes accompanied by baritone ukuleles, washboards, kazoos, maracas, etc.\n\nRepertoire sampler: SotC: \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love,\" \"Heartaches,\" \"Mood Indigo\" (my arrangement), \"Renaissance Woman (in a Diet Coke World).\"\n\nFirecrackers: \"Operator,\" \"In the Middle of the Night\" (both my arrangements), \"Achy Breaky Heart\" (featuring the fabulous Courtney Ronca).\n\nKookyukes: \"Down on the Corner (All the Kookyukies Are Singing),\" \"I Can Be as Happy as a Sardine in a Can (With My Old Man).\"\n\nUpcoming area gigs: Song of the Coast will be in concert at 3:30 p.m. Sunday at Tomoka United Methodist Church, 1000 Old Tomoka Road, Ormond Beach.

For more information, call me at 386-439-4583.\n\nWebsite: songofthecoast.org, sairegion9.com\n\nTaking Notes\n\nWho or what inspired you to take up music?\n\nI played the piano by ear for many years before my piano teacher caught on. My mom and my two older sisters taught me to harmonize. Sticking your fingers in your ears really does work!\n\nPlaying trombone in the band forced me to learn to count. As a Girl Scout member and later a leader, I played my uke around many a campfire. My Uncle Ducky inspired me to try barbershop harmony, through \"The Nursery Rhyme\" (similar to \"One Bottle of Pop\"). Sweet Adelines International focuses on educating their members according to their interest and ability. I've learned so much about music through the organization.\n\nWhat was the most unusual or memorable gig you've ever played?\n\nMy great-grandson, Nate Truelove, was critically injured in an automobile accident last September. The Unitarian Universalist Society donated their building in Ormond Beach on March 13 for a benefit concert for Nate. The Firecrackers performed. It was a very inspirational and touching experience. The feeling of love in the sanctuary was palpable.\n\nAlso, the Kookyukes performed at a wedding dinner. My uke got caught in another member's veil. It was an \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" moment!\n\nAnd the Kookyukes singing \"Four Wet Pigs\" at a protest rally in front of CSX in Jacksonville.\n\nWhat musician/celebrity/historical person would you most like to have dinner with?\n\nJesus. I have many questions for him, and am looking forward to learning the answers. Would I have found the perfect seashell if I'd searched for just one more minute? Most of my questions are a lot more important than that.\n\nWhat was the last book you read?\n\n\"The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven: A Remarkable Account of Miracles, Angels and Life Beyond This World -- A True Story\" by Kevin and Alex Malarkey.\n\nWhat CD/tape/music is in your car/home stereo/iPod right now?\n\nWhat's an iPod? In my car's tape player, I swap between the last SotC rehearsal and the last Firecracker rehearsal. Makes me feel really groovy. In my car's CD player, I listen to the CD of Nate's benefit.\n\nWhat is your favorite movie?\n\n\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" Great music and George Clooney. Who could ask for anything more?\n\nWhat was the best concert you ever attended?\n\nNeil Diamond at the Washington Cap Center -- boundless energy and rapport with audience. Also Up With People, Arlo Guthrie and Pete Seeger at Wolf Trap, Reston, Va. Uplifting!\n\n\"If I didn't play music, I would ... \":\n\nContinue to arrange four-part harmony and coach others. I'd play the piano and the uke with my friends, just for the fun of it and the joy that music brings to our hearts and souls. Music is therapy!\n\n\"I'd sell my soul for ...\":\n\nNothing. God owns my soul. It's not mine to sell. It is God's gift to me."
