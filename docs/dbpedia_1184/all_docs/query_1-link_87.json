        "text": "“It took me a while before I didn’t feel like I was doing live band karaoke to the San Fermin band,” singer Charlene Kaye tells Soul Sisters about what it was like joining the beloved indie band after their self-titled first album was already making waves.\n\n“I think when the second record came out I really felt like I had an ownership and an identity with those songs and being a part of this project.”\n\nKaye tells us about her parents’ anxiety over her chosen career in music (“If she had her druthers,” she says of her mother, who grew up in Singapore without much money, “she would have had me go to law school or become a doctor”) and how she still worries for herself as well (“I often think, ‘Wow, am I ever going to have health insurance? Am I ever going to have social security? Probably not.'”)\n\nSoul Sisters Podcast: Rumer Willis May Have Learned Music From Dad, But That Voice Is All Her Own\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“When you have a career that depends entirely on your own drive you have to be almost in this constant state of self-analysis,” she explains. While that kind of self-doubt proved almost crippling at times, Kaye finds herself in a new moment of self-assurance as San Fermin tours the world to promote their heralded second album, Jackrabbit. And who has time for constant self-analysis anyway? Or, as Kaye puts it:\n\n“I’m too busy doing what I really care about.”"
