        "text": "A Humble End\n\nAfter 6 months of exploring music from both the popular golden age, and of civilisations past, the blog has now come to an end. It has covered the musical boom of the 60’s, the glittery 70’s, the synthesised 80’s, and a fair part of the 90’s. In-between has been months of ancient and medieval music explored; from the Vikings to the Ancient Egyptians. The posts will all remain below, but in the meantime; thanks for reading!\n\nThrough Time- Music of Ancient Greece\n\nWelcome to the intermediary post of the blog! Here I’ll be exploring the importance and styles of music in differing time periods and their meaning in past cultures; everyone from the Romans and Greeks to the Celts and Medieval Europeans.\n\nThis month I will be going back to explore the music of Ancient Greece, a civilisation associated with their exotic and numerous gods, iconic columned buildings, and progressive politics. This period in Greek history dates back from around the 12th-9th centuries BC right up until 600 AD; with it came incredible achievements in art, architecture, and science. But it was in this period that the word ‘music’ was first used, and with that, early forms of musical notation, philosophical debates surrounding music, and a plethora of Greek instruments- not to mention one of the ancient world’s earliest complete songs!\n\nAncient Greek Instruments and Roles\n\nMusic in Ancient Greek society was prevalent at all levels, from official ceremonies to entertainment, even to back recitations of epic poetry. The word ‘music’ was derived from the Muses, daughters of the Greek god Zeus who were goddesses of creative and intellectual pursuits. Unique to the Greeks in the ancient world, they linked music with science and philosophy, with famed thinkers such as Pythagoras and Plato applying their own studies to create new laws and formalities surrounding harmonics and modes (specific musical scales which create varied emotional effects on the listener). Instruments were played often by rich men and women, who competed in competitions and, in the boy’s case, learned to play at school. Many Greek instruments were specifically attributed to their gods; the lyre to Hermes, the panpipes to Pan, and the flute to Athena. Other instruments used at the time included the harp, kithara (an early guitar-like instrument), aulos (a wind instrument) salpinx (trumpet) and the Ancient Egyptian sistrum.\n\nReligious Music- Paeans/Hymns\n\nThe Greek god of music, Apollo, strumming a lyre and wearing a crown of laurel leaves. Ancient Greeks often wrote Paeans, hymns of praise, to Apollo, but also sang them before a battle to draw from Apollo’s victory and glorious slaying of the Python.\n\nThe belief in Greek gods and various mythical beings unsurprisingly shaped some of Ancient Greek music, with many hymns and odes being dedicated to specific deities, and music accompanying ritual sacrifices, initiations and divinations of priests. The gods themselves were strongly linked with music; in fact, music was considered a gift from the gods. The chief god associated with music was Apollo, credited with the invention of string-music, and associated with the lyre along with the messenger god Hermes. He was known to take part in musical contests with others but would often punish his competitors for their hubris in challenging the god. Other musical deities include Pan, the half-man, half-goat god associated with rustic music who himself had dared to challenge Apollo to a contest. The Ancient Greeks had their own genre of music praising the gods; Paeans. A Paean is a hymn expressing thanksgiving and triumph, usually towards a specific god. As Apollo was so strongly associated with music, a Paean often be dedicated to him.\n\nPaean Example- Second Delphic Hymn\n\nDated to 128BC, this Delphic hymn is one of two discovered in fragments, each addressing Apollo (who was associated with the ancient sanctuary of Delphi where the Python had lived). The music flits between the Lydian and Hypolydian modes, specific melodic movements invented by the Greeks themselves. The music is an exotic and mysterious blend of a sparse drum, Krotalon (the ancient equivalent of castanets), lyre, harp, and a rich and low voice. The lyrics thankfully survived, along with potentially the oldest credited writer ever found in music history! The narrator is calling out to the Muses to come to Delphi and join in the singing in honour of Apollo, the Pythian Lord. There are multiple references to other sacred beings and places; the Pierian maidens refer to the Pierian Spring in Macedonia, a place of importance to the Muses (the maidens). Leto was the mother of Apollo and his sister Artemis, who gave birth to them on a distant land, while the Goddess Pallas was the tragic granddaughter of the sea god Poseidon who was accidentally killed by Athena.\n\n“Oh, come now, Muses,\n\nand go to the craggy sacred place\n\nupon the far-seen, twin-peaked Parnassus,\n\ncelebrated and dear to us, Pierian maidens.\n\nRepose on the snow-clad mountain top;\n\ncelebrate the Pythian Lord\n\nwith the goldensword, Phoebus,\n\nwhom Leto bore unassisted\n\non the Delian rock surrounded by silvery olives,\n\nthe luxuriant plant\n\nwhich the Goddess Pallas\n\nlong ago brought forth.”\n\nWritten by Limenius\n\nLyrical poetry was often used in praise to the gods, shown here with Mesomedes, a lyric poet from the 2nd century AD.\n\nHymn to the Sun\n\nPreviously the only surviving written poetry and music from the ancient world, The Hymn of the Sun is another wonderful tribute to Apollo, who the Ancient Greeks believed rode the chariot carrying the sun into the sky for a time (along with Helios). This recreation is played beautifully, with a sparse drum, deep vocals, and a flute which begins the hymn and joins in with the vocal melody from time to time. The music and singing is somewhat haunting and exotic, demonstrating the brilliance of Mesomedes’ composing and helping to carry the solemnity needed to venerate and respect Apollo. The hymn has the singer praise and describe Apollo’s journey in the chariot as he flies over the whole earth with the sun, giving light to the world. He attributes the stars above Olympus to Apollo, as they seem to sing and rejoice to the sound of his famous lyre while his sister Artemis takes her own chariot and white horses into the night to carry the moon. A truly evocative hymn expressing a genuine love and appreciation for the gods.\n\n“Father of the Dawn with her snow-white eyelids,\n\nYou who follow in your rose-pink chariot\n\nThe track of your flying steeds, exulting in the gold of your hair,\n\nTwining your darting rays across the boundless vault of sky, Whirling around the whole earth, the thread of your all-seeing beams,\n\nWhile flowing rivers of your deathless fire beget the lovely day.\n\nFor you the peaceful chorus of stars dance their measure across Olympus their lord,\n\nForever singing their leisured song, rejoicing in the music of Apollo’s lyre;\n\nAnd leading them the silvery-grey Moon, marshals the months and seasons,\n\nDrawn by her team of milk-white heifers.\n\nAnd your benevolent mind rejoices as it whirls around the manifold raiment of the Universe.”\n\nWritten by Mesomedes of Crete\n\nPersonal Music\n\nLike all cultures, the Ancient Greeks also liked to play and compose their own music for personal entertainment, and to express their feelings. As a gift from the gods themselves, music was taken seriously in matters of education, and so many Greeks had mastered the lyre, kithara and singing through specially created music schools. All-male drinking parties often ended with satirical songs called silloi, while Greek children had their equivalent of Christmas carols, agermos, which involved them singing at people’s doors in exchange for sweets and gifts. Music was also used in marriages and funerals as well as to poetry (with a lute as accompaniment) by writers such as Sappho and Alkaios.\n\nSong of Seikilos\n\nThe oldest known song in its entirety, the Seikilos epitaph luckily includes the musical notation and lyrics in full! Written in roughly 1 or 2AD, it’s interpreted to be a rather touching tribute made by a man called Seikilos, who dedicates the song to his deceased wife Euterpe. He ensures her name will live on forever by inscribing the complete composition on the marble column, along with the simple dedication ‘Seikilos to Euterpe’, and a final inscription: “I am a portrait in stone. I was put here by Seikilos where I remain forever, the symbol of deathless remembrance.” The reconstruction is poignant and captures the aeons long spent; a woman sings the lyrics, accompanied only by the gentle plucking of strings whose melody she follows. The words themselves are powerful, reminding us to appreciate the time we have with our loved ones. The song is short, but the words are timeless; Seikilos is telling us not to worry about the smaller things in life- it is too short, and time will eventually run out. A message that is utterly timeless.\n\n“While you live, shine Have no grief at all Life exists only for a short while And Time demands His due.”\n\nWritten by Seikilos\n\nIt’s no surprise to encounter such vivid and beautifully arranged music from the Ancient Greeks- the civilisation pioneering everything from music notation to philosophical ideas about the world. Their rich curiosity laid the groundwork for much of the arts and sciences of the Ancient World and continues to make waves today. Ever timeless is their need for music, whether to praise and venerate their gods, or to simply release emotions and bring joy to others. It is a further demonstration of mankind turning to music to enrich their lives, no matter when and where they’re from- a tradition unlikely to ever end.\n\n1965- July Chart\n\nWelcome to Songs Through Time! In this blog I aim to look back at pop music history using the charts featured on BBC Radio 2’s ‘Pick of the Pops’ show each week, providing some historical context to understand how the music of the time came to be, along with its impact on the record-buying public. I’ll be choosing a personal favourite, looking at the week’s Number 1, and uncovering more obscure songs from the same year which deserve the spotlight. Each song will be broken down and I’ll be throwing in some trivia for good measure. My aim is for you to learn something new and to discover some great artists. Happy reading!\n\nInspired by last week’s Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2, let’s take another look at 1965.\n\nJuly 20 1965 Top 20\n\n20. Cliff Richard- On My Word\n\n19. Peter Cook & Dudley Moore- Goodbye-ee\n\n18. The Searchers- He’s Got No Love\n\n17. The Animals- We Gotta Get Out of This Place\n\n16. Sir Douglas Quintet- She’s About a Mover\n\n15. The Everly Brothers- The Price of Love\n\n14. The Who- Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\n\n13. Sam the Sham & The Pharaohs- Wooly Bully\n\n12. Donovan- Colours\n\n11. Joan Baez- There But For Fortune\n\n10. The Fortunes- You’ve Got Your Troubles\n\n9. Dusty Springfield- In The Middle Of Nowhere\n\n8. Lulu- Leave A Little Love\n\n7. Gene Pitney- Looking Through the Eyes of Love\n\n6. Elvis Presley- Crying in the Chapel\n\n5. Peter & Gordon- To Know You Is To Love You\n\n4. The Hollies- I’m Alive\n\n3. The Ivy League- Tossing and Turning\n\n2. The Yardbirds- Heart Full of Soul\n\n1. The Byrds- Mr Tambourine Man\n\nI’m back to 1965, 2 months on from my last Top Twenty! Much of the year was dominated by The Beatles, but other British bands were following suit; The Who released their first hit single ‘I Can’t Explain’, while The Animals made waves across the pond on America’s popular Ed Sullivan Show 3 times that year. Meanwhile, ‘The Killing of Sister George’, premiered at the Duke of York’s Theatre, introducing one of the first lesbian characters to British plays, and Parliament celebrated its 700th anniversary! The charts this week see the Fab Four missing for once- instead US group The Byrds take the Number 1 spot, with fellow American Joan Baez also making the Top Twenty with ‘There But For Fortune’. The British Invasion’s love of blues-orientated rock is visible here through The Yardbirds (Heart Full of Soul) and The Animals (‘We Gotta Get Out of This Place) while older veterans flank the charts in the form of Cliff Richard (‘On My Word’), Elvis Presley (‘Crying in the Chapel’), and The Everly Brothers (‘The Price of Love’). For the rarer side of the year, I’ll be exploring some Northern Soul from Sandra King, plus a beautiful ballad from Phil & Harv!\n\nBeyond the Chart\n\nThe Animals- We Gotta Get Out Of This Place\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘We Gotta Get Out Of This Place’ was written by husband-and-wife Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil associated with the Brill Building song-writing scene in New York. The song was actually intended for The Righteous Brothers, who had a hit with another of the duo’s songs, ‘You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling’ in 1964, but record executive Allen Klein heard the demo recorded by Mann and passed it on to The Animals’ producer Mickie Most, who was already looking for Brill Building songwriters for the groups next recording session.\n\nThis iconic record is raw, gritty, and powerful, taken to heart by American GI’s serving in the Vietnam War at the time of its release. The music builds up slowly, beginning with Chas Chandlers’ ominously repeating bassline, a single cymbal keeping up the timing, and Eric Burden’s foreboding vocals. Before long the guitar chords and full drumbeat come in and Burden’s vocals become fierce and filled with anguish, backed by the vocals of the other band members as the verse becomes the chorus. Flitting between foreboding and full-blown desperation, the music and vocals back the lyrics perfectly: ‘We Gotta Get Out Of This Place’ is about a young man yearning to escape the inevitable life of working until you die in a dark, industrial city, as his father has done. It reflects The Animals’ Newcastle roots, but famously was considered an anthem of sorts for those serving in the Vietnam War; for the soldiers, the lyrics represented escaping the inevitable suffering and death in a country far-flung from their homes. A powerful Pick of the Chart.\n\n“In this dirty old part of the city, where the sun refused to shine\n\nPeople tell me there ain’t no use in tryin’\n\nNow my girl you’re so young and pretty and one thing I know is true\n\nYou’ll be dead before your time is due, I know\n\nWatch my daddy in bed a-dyin’, watched his hair been turnin’ grey\n\nHe’s been workin’ and slavin’ his life away, oh yes I know it\n\n(Yeah!) He’s been workin’ so hard\n\n(Yeah!) I’ve been workin’ too, baby\n\n(Yeah!) Every night and day\n\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)\n\nWe gotta get out of this place, if it’s the last thing we ever do\n\nWe gotta get out of this place ’cause girl, there’s a better life for me and you…”\n\nWritten by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil\n\nThis week’s Number 1 comes courtesy of America!\n\nNumber 1\n\nThe Byrds- Mr Tambourine Man\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe Byrds had recorded ‘Mr Tambourine Man’ before its writer Bob Dylan had released his version! They’d used a demo recorded for his 1964 album ‘Another Side of Bob Dylan’ which was presented to them by their manager Jim Dickson. After some reluctance from the band, who didn’t think the song had hit potential, ‘Mr Tambourine Man’ became The Byrds’ debut single and the title of their debut album, the latter of which was released two months later.\n\nThis week’s Number 1 is a brilliant take on a Bob Dylan classic, even going on to inspire the man himself to enter the world of folk rock! ‘Mr Tambourine’ kicks off with The Byrd’s signature jangling 12-string guitar and (suitably) a tambourine before the full band and vocals come in. The chorus is almost immediate and satisfying, consisting of the band singing in harmony before dropping out for (Roger) Jim McGuinn’s whimsical lead vocals. With two choruses and one verse, the single manages to be short and sweet, gaining even Bob Dylan’s approval (upon hearing it in the studio he remarked ‘Wow, man! You can dance to that!’) and fast becoming the shining example of how ’60’s folk rock should sound. Lyrically, ‘Mr Tambourine Man’ is full of vivid imagery; the narrator is weary and, senses dulled, ready to follow Mr Tambourine Man anywhere and listen to his song. His lack of sleep seems to cause the vivid imagery he sees, although it’s been heavily suggested (though denied) that his images were caused by drug use. A very worthy Number 1 and brilliant take on folk!\n\n“Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n\nI’m not sleepy and there ain’t no place I’m going to\n\nHey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n\nIn the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you\n\nTake me for a trip upon your magic swirlin’ ship\n\nAll my senses have been stripped and my hands can’t feel to grip\n\nAnd my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels\n\nTo be wanderin’\n\nI’m ready to go anywhere, I’m ready for to fade\n\nOnto my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way\n\nI promise to go under it\n\nHey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n\nI’m not sleepy and there ain’t no place I’m going to\n\nHey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\n\nIn the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you…”\n\nWritten by Bob Dylan\n\nThe rare side of 1965 adds artists of Northern Soul and doo-wop to the mix!\n\nBeyond the Chart\n\nSandra King- Leave It Up To The Boys\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSandra Eubanks, stage name Sandra King, was just 16 years old when this rare single was recorded! She was given permission to leave her school for the day of the recording with Robert Holmes who’d written the single. Holmes was a soul and blues songwriter on the Nashville scene and associate of Ted Jarrett, who had written ‘You Can Make It If You Try’ in 1957 for Gene Allison– it’s been covered by a variety of artists including The Rolling Stones and Gene Vincent.\n\nThis brilliant soul record captures the spirit, energy, and heartbreak of the young Sandra King. ‘Leave it Up to the Boys’ is driven by a Cha-Cha drum-beat and brass instrumentation along with electric guitar and bass, helping to back King’s powerful vocals. King is backed by the vocals of The Hytones and The Tides, who are effective in letting King conquer the record with her brilliant voice. The powerful and irresistibly catchy music backs lyrics perhaps unusual for a 16-year-old to sing; the overwhelming emotions in ‘Leave it Up to the Boys’ are of cynicism, bitterness, and the pain of a lesson learned the hard way. In it, the narrator is warning the listener to stay away from boys, for fear that they would inevitably break your heart by using you, leaving you, and blaming the ending of the relationship on you. She describes beautifully romantic scenes but uses them to warn you that they are fake and the man in question was never meant for you. A criminally under-rated record!\n\n“Leave it up to the boys they’ll break your heart They’ll take your world then tear it apart So don’t let them hold you and squeeze you so tight Don’t stroll in the moonlight hold hands in the daylight He, sir was never meant for you\n\nLeave it up to the boys they’ll do you wrong They’ll steal your love then leave you alone So don’t let him kiss you and hold you so close Cos boys never mean it not even a little bit Don’t let him tell you that his love is true\n\nEvery time a boy looks my way, he starts on the same old game When the love is over, he said that the girl’s to blame\n\nLeave it up to the boys they’ll make you cry Make you wish you were lain right down and die So you’ll never change him or rearrange him So I’ll go on living always forgiving So little boy is gone to me So I’ll go on living always forgiving So little boys is gone to me…”\n\nWritten by Robert Holmes\n\nNext up is a rarity from the West Coast!\n\nPhil & Harv- Darling\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAlthough there is little information on Phil & Harv themselves, their record label Rampart had some fairly successful groups on its label including Mexican Americans The Blendells, cult favourites of the West Coast! They managed some success with a cover version of Stevie Wonder’s ‘La La La La La’ but many of the band suffered by being drafted into the Vietnam War. Other artists with releases on Rampart include The Atlantics, Eastside Connection, and Skylite.\n\nThis rarity is a sweet doo-wop ballad which begins slow and steady before plunging into an exciting middle section! The musical backing is gentle but driven, beginning with a short electric guitar melody before Phil and Harv’s beautifully harmonised vocals come in, followed by the waltzing drums and gentle plodding piano. It remains calm and beautiful before the drums become more driven and harsher, with haunting female backing vocals in the background and minor (sadder) chords being added by the guitar. It’s a refreshing break in the song which transitions back into the verse and repeated end line. In 60’s love-song fashion, ‘Darling’ has the narrator yearning for the love of someone he misses and is lonely without. He expresses his longing and continually asks her to come back to him with her love and affection to rid him of his sadness. It’s a short and sweet plea, with simple repeated lyrics- a true ’60’s single!\n\n“Oh darling I’m so blue and lonely Want your love and only please bring your love Oh darling I miss you so much Miss your gentle touch please bring your love I want to hold you squeeze you tell you how I feel And show you that I love you and tell you my love is real Oh darling I’m just a fool, a fool in love Please bring your love…”\n\nWritten by Delbert Franklin\n\nBy this time, the doors had been opened to freer, less formal music, yet 1965 was really just the beginning! Musicians very quickly began to evolve their styles and sounds, some to great success at the expense of tamer listeners. Bob Dylan would don an electric guitar this very year at the Newport Folk Festival, alienating folk purists but opening himself up to the rock world, while The Beatles would abandon touring for some truly magnificent and richly layered music within the space of a year, helped along by more colourful and exotic imagery on their album covers. An explosion of music, fashion, and teenage liberation was about to ensue!\n\n1984- July Chart\n\nWelcome to Songs Through Time! In this blog I aim to look back at pop music history using the charts featured on BBC Radio 2’s ‘Pick of the Pops’ show each week, providing some historical context to understand how the music of the time came to be, along with its impact on the record-buying public. I’ll be choosing a personal favourite, looking at the week’s Number 1, and uncovering more obscure songs from the same year which deserve the spotlight. Each song will be broken down and I’ll be throwing in some trivia for good measure. My aim is for you to learn something new and to discover some great artists. Happy reading!\n\nInspired by last week’s Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2, let’s take another look at 1984.\n\nJuly 13 1984 Top 20\n\n20. The Jackson 5 Feat. Mick Jagger- State of Shock\n\n19. Sister Sledge- Thinking of You\n\n18. Wham!- Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\n\n17. Lionel Richie- Stuck On You\n\n16. Michael Jackson- Farewell My Summer Love\n\n15. OMD- Talking Loud And Clear\n\n14. The Bluebells- Young At Heart\n\n13. Alison Moyet- Love Resurrection\n\n12. Bronski Beat- Smalltown Boy\n\n11. Thompson Twins- Sister of Mercy\n\n10. Tina Turner- What’s Love Got To Do With It\n\n9. Grandmaster Flash & Melle Mel- White Lies (Don’t Don’t Do It)\n\n8. Prince- When Doves Cry\n\n7. The Pointer Sisters- Jump (For My Love)\n\n6. Ollie and Jerry- Breakin’….There’s No Stoppin’ Us\n\n5. Neil- Hole In My Shoe\n\n4. Nik Kershaw- I Won’t Let the Sun Go Down On Me\n\n3. Cyndi Lauper- Time After Time\n\n2. Frankie Goes to Hollywood- Relax\n\n1. Frankie Goes to Hollywood- Two Tribes\n\n3 months on from my previous look at 1984, there is still so much to talk about. It was the year of the Financial Times Stock Exchange, Torvil and Dean’s Winter Olympic triumph, and the abolition of dog licenses! The charts have naturally altered drastically from the April Top Twenty, but the socio-political themes seem to have stuck; LGBT anthems appear in the form of Bronski Beat’s ‘Smalltown Boy’ and Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s ‘Relax’ while Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel tackle the serious consequences of drug addiction in ‘White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It). Much of the other Top Twenty records are dance-heavy, with pop groups like Sister Sledge (Thinking of You’ and The Pointer Sisters (‘Jump’) along with some catchy R&B from Tina Turner (‘What’s Love Got to Do With It’). The rare side of the year celebrates the era of the synthesiser with Jon St. James, plus some German boogie from Peter Patzer!\n\nMy Pick of the Chart\n\nSister Sledge- Thinking of You\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘Thinking of You’ was already 5 years old by the time it hit the Top Twenty- it had featured on Sister Sledge’s 1979 album ‘We Are Family’! Kim Sledge says of the record, “It’s my absolute favourite song that’s we ever recorded. You can go anywhere with it. Regardless of the audience, demographics, age groups, cultures, it’s one of those songs that is just so full of love and encouragement. When we sing it I get happy.”\n\nThis disco classic revived the world’s love for Sister Sledge, and what a way to do it! From the very beginning we’re treated to Nile Rodgers’ famously scratchy, catchy rhythm guitar before Bernard Edwards’ iconic bass kicks in- together they are the perfect duo to ground this brilliant song. Filling out the addictive sounds of drums, bass and guitar are strings and piano, backing a host of vocals from not only the sisters but Luther Vandross as well! It holds up fantastically in an era addicted to synthesisers and drum machines, proving the timeless quality of recorded instruments and the talent of Rodgers and Edwards (who famously produced not only Sister Sledge but Diana Ross too). Lyrically, ‘Thinking of You’ has the narrator excitedly telling everyone about her love- someone who makes her feel so good to be alive it feels like he is a gift from above who makes the sun rise. She promises to stay with him forever, feeling like there’d be no reason to go on without him. The words are straight-forward but the music it sits on, along with the sisters’ brilliant vocals (particularly Kathy’s soaring ad-lib near the end of the song) make this record an easy Pick of the Chart and a definite disco classic!\n\n“Everybody let me tell you about my love\n\nBrought to me by an angel from above\n\nFully equipped with a lifetime guarantee\n\nOnce you try it, well I’m sure that you’ll agree\n\n[Without love] There’s no reason to live\n\n[Without you] And what would I do with the love I give\n\n[All my lovin’] To you I’ll be giving\n\nAnd I promise, as long as I’m living\n\nI’m thinking of you and the things you do to me\n\nThat make me love you, now I’m living in ecstasy\n\nI’m thinking of you and the things you do to me\n\nThat make me love you, now I’m living in ecstasy…”\n\nWritten by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards\n\nThis week has one particular group stealing the Top Two!\n\nNumber 1\n\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood- Two Tribes\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe famous music video for ‘Two Tribes’, featuring a hand-to-hand fighting match between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko, was produced by 10cc’s former band members Lol Creme and Kevin Godley! According to Godley, “It was a very intense shoot. We were trying to get the audience to behave in a manner that we wanted to by chanting, ‘Kill! Kill! Kill!’ A few of them seriously got into the spirit of it by jumping in the ring and beating each other up!”\n\nThis week’s Number 1 is an effective anti-war song, expressing the world’s fears of the Cold War between the US and Soviet Russia turning into a deadly catastrophe through nuclear warfare. Frankie Goes to Hollywood reflect this pointedly, choosing to begin the song with snippets of official government advice spoken by Patrick Allen; the ‘Protect and Survive’ public information films advising citizens on how to survive nuclear attacks. It is soon backed by strings taken heavily from Russian classical music; one of the two tribes. The other, the US, is reflected in the pounding R&B bassline and drums which enter the song once the advice ends, still backed by strings. Johnson’s vocals come in, often backed up as he sings his nihilistic message. While at its core ‘Two Tribes’ is criticising war; its futility and point-scoring- there is a disturbing rhetoric in the question ‘Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new gods?’, a suggestion that the chaos of war is something as lustful as love and sex. A disturbing Number 1, reflecting the overwhelming feelings of impending destruction felt by the average citizen in the Western world.\n\n“The air attack warning sounds like this is the sound When you hear the air attack warning\n\nYou and your family must take cover\n\nWhen two tribes go to war\n\nOne is all that you can score\n\n(Score no more, score no more)\n\nWhen two tribes go to war\n\nOne is all that you can score\n\n(Workin’ for the black gas)\n\nComrad number one\n\nA born again poor man’s son\n\n(Poor man’s son)\n\nOn the air America\n\nI modeled shirts for Van Heusen\n\n(Workin’ for the black gas) yeah…”\n\nWritten by Peter Gill, Holly Johnson and Mark O’Toole\n\nThe rarer side of 1984 mixes pop, rock and synths!\n\nBeyond the Chart\n\nJon St. James- Playback\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe original version of ‘Playback’ was actually released by Jon St James’ group, SSQ (Stacey Q)! Their version can be found here. St James’ album, Trans-Atlantic, which featured this track, also includes a cover of The Moody Blues’ ‘Nights in White Satin’ but all other songs credit himself as either co-writer or writer.\n\nThis rare album track from Jon St’ James is a true earworm, creating an addictive sound with the power of the 80’s synthesiser one moment, and the classic distorted guitar the next! The former sound rules the beginning of the track, with an unmistakeable techno feel backed by a drum machine and synthetic backing vocals. It lends a clean sound to St James’ vocals as he alternates with the quiet voice of Stacey Swain. The chorus then raises the intensity of the song, with the introduction of electric guitar and extra percussion. The synth-pop re-enters until the next chorus, after which the guitar ratchets things up all the more with a mini solo against the synths. Its quick raw chords continue throughout, merging with the tech beloved of St. James (a pioneer in audio effects and utilising synthetic tapes). Lyrically, ‘Playback’ relates the process of recording a song to a relationship. An interesting, addictive rarity!\n\n“It’s a polyphonic sound, it’s the shape of things It’s a very modern century that we’re living in You were seventeen and I was nine, I saw you take my sister to bed one time I was young but I know, I’d want to Playback take me back your love for me Playing in the studio playing on the radio, playback\n\nIt’s a day in my life it’s the coldest yet You sit there with your tankary and a cigarette I’m not gonna wait around for you to Playback take my back your love for me Playing in the studio play it on the radio, playback\n\nIt’s the supersonic look of the things to come It’s the jet edge now that we’re coming from you’re a hi-tech man of discovery But you walk away and leave me here in misery, just walk on Playback take me back playing in the studio playing on the radio, playback…”\n\nWritten by Jon St. James and Daniel Van Patten\n\nThis next obscurity lives up to its record label- boogie on the mainline!\n\nPeter Patzer- You Are Not The One For Me\n\nDid You Know?\n\nGerman composer Peter Patzer created a variety of library records for the record label Crea Music, becoming the main artist whose music was released on the label. Other releases (up to the late ’90’s) included a jazz LP by percussionist Harold E. Smith and a single from short-lived Belgian rock band Bad Influence, ‘God’s Private Devil’!\n\nThis album track from Peter Patzer is smooth synthesised boogie at its beat, with a crisp and clear musical backing of syncopated clapping and percussion, strong piano chords, beautiful harmonies, and the 80’s staple, the synthesiser! The backing is always strong but not afraid to change when it counts; the beats move on to emphasise the beginnings of each bar after choruses, creating the feeling of an interesting yet precise transition back to the verses. The second time this happens, the instruments are left to themselves, stopping suddenly before a synthesised solo rips through the song and jams right through to the fade-out. Lyrically, ‘You Are Not The One For Me’ fits its title; the narrator is trying to reason with her partner to let her break up as she has realised their relationship is not supposed to last. She tells her partner there is nothing left to say; she wants to leave and pursue someone else. For a break-up song, it’s certainly catchy and makes for a brilliant dance tune!\n\n“You’re not the one for me why don’t you set me free I had a love so strong why can’t we get along Now that I know you can, somebody else giving me the share You better turn around I’m gonna live the love I’ve found\n\nYou said that you were the only guy and noticed the way I did was really shy Now that you know my love is gone you’re telling me to carry on Why can’t you see there’s no way out, baby, nothing left to talk about I’ll go my way right on my own you can be sure I’m not alone\n\nYou’re not the one for me why don’t you set me free I had a love so strong why can’t we get along Now that I know you can, somebody else giving me the share You better turn around and go and live the love I’ve found”\n\nWritten by Peter Patzer\n\n1984 certainly had a fair mix of music, both dealing with the socio-political climate, and offering record-buyers a chance at escapism and fun. Musicians began to take the various new technology for granted, believing wholly in the precision of sequencing and MIDI-controlled instrumentation; its popularity is proven here by the Top Two, courtesy of Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Older artists would adapt their styles to the ultra-modern sound, the ultimate step in creating our association between the 1980’s and the sound of the synthesiser! Still, the tradition of band-led artists would continue, and would have their day a decade later…\n\n1975- July Chart\n\nWelcome to Songs Through Time! In this blog I aim to look back at pop music history using the charts featured on BBC Radio 2’s ‘Pick of the Pops’ show each week, providing some historical context to understand how the music of the time came to be, along with its impact on the record-buying public. I’ll be choosing a personal favourite, looking at the week’s Number 1, and uncovering more obscure songs from the same year which deserve the spotlight.

Happy reading!\n\nInspired by last week’s Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2, let’s take a look at 1975.\n\nJuly 6 1975 Top 20\n\n20. Roy Wood- Oh What a Shame\n\n19. The Rubettes- Foe Dee Oh Dee\n\n18. Donny Osmond & Marie Osmond- Make the World Go Away\n\n17. Nazareth- My White Bicycle\n\n16. Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel- Mr Raffles (Man it Was Mean)\n\n15. Pete Wingfield- Eighteen With a Bullet\n\n14. Gilbert O’Sullivan- I Don’t Love You (But I Think I Like You)\n\n13. Kenny- Baby I Love You, OK!\n\n12. Wings- Listen To What The Man Said\n\n11. The Osmonds- The Proud One\n\n10. Mud- Moonshine Sally\n\n9. The Chi-Lites- Have You Seen Her/Oh Girl\n\n8. Gary Glitter- Doing Alright With the Boys\n\n7. Showaddywaddy- Three Steps to Heaven\n\n6.

Johnny Nash- Tears On My Pillow\n\n1. 10cc- I’m Not in Love\n\n1975 was a year of snow-showers, band breakups and beginnings, and social progression. Deep Purple’s Ritchie Blackmore left the band to form his own band, Rainbow, master showman Peter Gabriel left Genesis to pursue a solo career, and heavy metal group Iron Maiden were formed in East London. British women gained new protection in the workplace through the Sex Discrimination Act and Equal Pay Act coming into force, while Margaret Thatcher became the Conservative Party’s first female leader. This week’s charts reflect an eclectic set of music, from teenybopper sensations like The Osmonds (The Proud One) to second-wave glam rockers like Mud (Moonshine Sally). Nostalgia was in the air with a cover of Eddie Cochran’s ‘Three Steps to Heaven’ from Showaddywaddy and Nazareth’s cover of Tomorrow’s 1967 songTomorrow’s 1967 song ‘My White Bicycle’. The rarer side of the year shows off some pre-punk raucousness from Feather along with some smooth, gentle country from John Stuckey!\n\nMy Pick of the Chart\n\nPete Wingfield- Eighteen With A Bullet\n\nDid You Know?\n\nPete Wingfield wasn’t only playing music in the ’70’s, he was also a regular writer and reviewer for the British magazines Melody Maker and Let It Rock! He was primarily skilled in soul music, and performed in the band Olympic Runners, a group made up of session musicians. They managed to reach Number 72 on the US R&B chart with the single ‘Put the Music Where Your Mouth Is’ in 1974.\n\nThis intriguing Pick of the Chart harks back to the glory days of do-wop- perfect in an era when pop and rock artists turned back to the ’50’s for inspiration! In doo-wop style, the music is syncopated, with ad-libbing backing singers, strings, piano, off-beat guitar chords, and a gentle beat increasing in tension during choruses. Wingfield’s vocals are a surprising falsetto one moment, and low and bassy the next- further into the song his voice seems to get higher still! We’re treated to a saxophone solo midway through, short and cool amidst the filled out beat. Lyrically, ‘Eighteen With a Bullet’ tricks the listener with its music-industry euphemisms; a bullet in chart terms is a song which enters the chart with a lot of momentum- a sure-fire hit rather than the physical ammo that comes to mind when referring to a bullet. Wingfield then goes on to use more metaphors to refer to a relationship, with the narrator describing himself as an oldie-but-goldie and a single that could become a hit followed by an LP if the girl he’s interested in responds. A single no doubt loved by Radio DJ’s and journalists for its industry-heavy references!\n\n“I’m eighteen with a bullet\n\nGot my finger on the trigger, I’m gonna pull it\n\nI’m picked to click now\n\nI’m a son-of-a-gun\n\nSo hold it right there little girl, little girl\n\nWe’re gonna have big fun\n\nI may be an oldie, but I’m a goldie, too\n\nI’ll last forever and I’ll be good to you\n\nOh, yes I will\n\n(Do, do, do, do, do…)\n\nI’m eighteen with a bullet\n\nGot my finger on the trigger, I’m gonna pull it\n\nI’m a super-soul sure-shot, yeah\n\nI’m a national breakout\n\nSo let me check your playlist, mama\n\nHuh, c’mon let’s make out…”\n\nWritten by Pete Wingfield\n\nThis week’s Number 1 spins the love song on its head!\n\nNumber 1\n\n10cc- I’m Not In Love\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe lyrical inspiration for ‘I’m Not in Love’ was actually Eric Stewart saying ‘I love you’ to his wife (he thought) too often! According to Stewart: “I had this crazy idea in my mind that repeating those words would somehow degrade the meaning, so I told her, ‘Well, if I say every day “I love you, darling, I love you, blah, blah, blah”, it’s not gonna mean anything eventually’. That statement led me to try to figure out another way of saying it, and the result was that I chose to say ‘I’m not in love with you’, while subtly giving all the reasons throughout the song why I could never let go of this relationship.”\n\nArguably 10cc’s most iconic single, ‘I’m Not in Love’ turns the love song on its head lyrically and utilises the musical technology of the time to brilliant effect. The wordless choir effect is instantly recognisable and powerful, the result of a painstaking 256 vocal dubs by the band. It’s the defining ‘instrument’ of the record, but the music grounds it subtly with soft electric piano chords, a simple beat centred around the bass drum synthesiser, bass guitar during only the middle section, and rhythm guitar. 10cc even use their receptionist on the record; she can be heard whispering when the music dies down to piano and bass. It’s an incredible achievement for 1975; long before autotune and readily available MIDI instrumentation, vocals had become the centre-point for the entire record. Lyrically, ‘I’m Not In Love’ is just as unique; the narrator is continually denying he is in love, yet he drops many hints that he still does, such as keeping her picture and continuing to call her. A breath of fresh air in the pop-heavy world of 1975!\n\n“I’m not in love, so don’t forget it\n\nIt’s just a silly phase I’m going through\n\nAnd just because I call you up\n\nDon’t get me wrong, don’t think you’ve got it made\n\nI’m not in love, no no, it’s because\n\nI like to see you, but then again\n\nThat doesn’t mean you mean that much to me\n\nSo if I call you don’t make a fuss\n\nDon’t tell your friends about the two of us\n\nI’m not in love, no no, it’s because\n\nI keep your picture upon the wall\n\nIt hides a nasty stain that’s lying there\n\nSo don’t you ask me to give it back\n\nI know you know it doesn’t mean that much to me\n\nI’m not in love, no no, it’s because…”\n\nWritten by Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman\n\nThe rarer music of the time flits between the heavy and the heavy-hearted!\n\nBeyond the Chart\n\nFeather- Stupid Girl\n\nDid You Know?\n\nRolling Stones fans might recognise ‘Stupid Girl’ from their album, ‘Paint It Black’ from 1966! According to Keith Richards, “It was all a spin-off from our environment… hotels, and too many dumb chicks. Not all dumb, not by any means, but that’s how one got. When you’re canned up – half the time it’s impossible to go out – it was to go through a whole sort of football match.” As for Feather, they were formed as a studio project by Mike Butcher (guitar) and Alan Ward (vocals).\n\nThis rarity from Feather is unashamedly audacious, loud, and energetic, taking from The Rolling Stones original and injecting rowdy pre-punk into it nearly a decade later! Sticking to the time-honoured line-up of guitar, bass, drums and vocals, the band kicks things off with a straight rock drum beat before the electric guitar and bass come in, followed quickly by Alan Ward’s vocals. Despite the venomous lyrics, the music feels up-beat, energetic and catchy, with Ward also sounding not quite as scornful as you’d think. Notably, near the end, the music takes a strange turn, slowing down and becoming more rockabilly in nature; piano begins the section, the guitar riff becomes more typically rock and roll, and the whole feel of the music becomes bouncy. Lyrically, ‘Stupid Girl’ has the narrator scornfully describing a girl as stupid, fake, and vain. According to him, she’s a gold-digger as well as being only skin-deep; she cares only for her appearance and for impressing others with fake stories. The toxicity of the lyrics only serves to add to the loud, rude sound Feather create just a year before punk music became popular- an intriguing obscurity!\n\n“I’m not talking about the kind of clothes she wears, look at that stupid girl I’m not talking about the way she combs her hair look at that stupid girl Well the way that she powders her nose well her vanity shows and it shows Well she’s the worst thing in this world look at that stupid girl\n\nWell I’m not talking about the way she digs for gold look at that stupid girl Well I’m not talking about the way she grabs and holds look at that stupid girl Well the way she talks about someone else that she don’t even know herself She’s the sickest thing in this world look at that stupid girl\n\nWell I am sick and tired and I really have my doubts I’ve tried and tried but it never really works out Like a lady in waiting to a virgin queen look at that stupid girl She bitches ’bout things that she’s never seen look at that stupid girl…”\n\nWritten by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards\n\nThe flip side of the year is gentler in sound, but still a heartbreaker!\n\nJohn Stuckey- Without You\n\nDid You Know?\n\nJohn Stuckey had his own radio show in Houston during the ’70’s! He later went on to become a talented tattoo artist and fan along with (Good Ole) Uncle Bob (who the record label was apparently named for). This record was recorded at Houston’s legendary Sugarhill Recording Studios, famous for launching the careers of The Big Bopper, Lightnin’ Hopkins, and George Jones! More information on the Studios can be found here.\n\nThis rare single hit the nail on the head when it comes to country records, with acoustic instruments and lyrics telling a story of heartbreak. Interestingly though, the main instrument for ‘Without You’ is unusual; the humble flute! It features prominently alongside the more expected musical backing; bass, piano, drums, steel guitar, acoustic guitar and organ. The backing begins gently, led by piano and flute before Stuckey’s calm voice comes in. The choruses lend some extra weight to Stuckey’s sad declaration of his loneliness through the drums, screeching organ, and a short instrumental break led by the flute. Lyrically, ‘Without You’ describes the daily life of a man who has just broken up with his partner. He is painfully aware of how alone he is throughout all aspects of his life; for him it feels wrong and unbearable to think about, so he busies himself working and getting drunk on beer to drown out his pain in coming back to an empty house. An interesting mix of country and folk (via the flute) music.\n\n“Early in the morning when the sun shines go rolling in my window, I’m alone Early in the morning when the sun shines bring up the brand-new day without you I lift my bones and fix a pot of coffee and I hold the cup by myself All alone, all alone without you When ready to leave it feels so wrong with no-one to say goodbye to I’m alone\n\nTwo eggs and ham at the corner café a cup of coffee, someone to talk to without you The harder I work the less I think about you, so I work real hard by myself All alone all alone without you I stop by Sam’s have a beer, then another people all around me I’m alone Drunk enough now to face an empty house and darkened windows without crying Without you Can’t stand the quiet, turn on the tube and watch a movie till I fall asleep by myself All alone all alone without you, without you, without you”\n\nWritten by John Stuckey\n\n1975 certainly had a variety of music; however much of it would soon go on to be seen as boring, unfashionable, and far from trendy. Glam rock was already fading out along with progressive rock, and long hair would quickly become associated with an older generation of record-buyers. Within a year mohawks, Doc Martins, and drainpipe jeans became the hottest and most dangerous looks to the mainstream media- enter the era of the punk! That’s not to say the future was all about rude words on album covers though- Saturday Night Fever would see to that! An exciting change was in the air…\n\n1982- June Chart\n\nWelcome to Songs Through Time!

Against the backdrop of unofficial war, music got a big boost with the broadcasting of live performance programme ‘The Tube’ on the newly created Channel 4, while German musicians celebrated with the first ever German Number 1 single, Kraftwerk’s ‘The Model’, hitting the British charts, plus a German song ‘A Little Peace’ winning that year’s Eurovision Song Contest! This week’s charts reflect the ’80’s trends that spring to mind when thinking of the decade; New Romanticism from Gary Numan (We Take Mystery), Soft Cell (Torch) and ABC (The Look of Love), wacky ska from Madness (House of Fun), and a mixture of dance, R&B and even The Beatles! The rarer side of 1982 includes a great groove from The Limit, along with some experimental synth from A Final Discipline!\n\nPick of the Chart\n\nMadness- House of Fun\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘House of Fun’ has a very mature meaning within its lyrics! According to Madness front-man Suggs: “It’s about the embarrassment of going to a chemist’s shop to buy a condom for the first time.” The music video was wacky in itself, with it being set variously in a joke shop, a chemist, and a rollercoaster in Great Yarmouth. The band were made to go round the rollercoaster over 50 times before the director of the video was satisfied!\n\nMadness’ wacky ska-pop features as my Pick of the Chart, demonstrating their iconic sound guaranteed to have gotten record-buyers jumping around! ‘House of Fun’ is utterly catchy and bizarre, beginning with those iconic twin brass instruments, the saxophone and the trumpet, playing to a ska beat, tinkling keys, and bass. Then Sugg’s accented vocals come in, almost speaking as he delivers lines easily misunderstood! The middle section is almost sinister, carnivalesque before a beat is missed to make way for another verse- touches like this demonstrate that Madness were and are very talented musicians underneath their playful exterior. Lyrically, ‘House of Fun’ is a coming-of-age song that (surely) accurately describes a 16-year-old who goes to the chemist for the first time with the intention of buying condoms- except he confuses the woman serving him by using a stream of euphemisms to ask for them! She mistakenly assumes he’s after party items and directs him to a joke shop. A brilliantly funny record!\n\n“Good morning miss, can I help you son?\n\nSixteen today and up for fun\n\nI’m a big boy now or so they say\n\nSo if you’ll serve, I’ll be on my way\n\nBox of balloons with the feather-light touch\n\nPack of party-poppers that pop in the night\n\nA toothbrush and hairspray, plastic grin\n\nMiss Clay on all corners has just walked in\n\nWelcome to the house of fun\n\nNow I’ve come of age\n\nWelcome to the house of fun\n\nWelcome to the lion’s den\n\nTemptation’s on his way\n\nWelcome to the House of…”\n\nWritten by Lee Thompson\n\nThis week’s Number 1 re-launched the career of its singer!\n\nNumber 1\n\nCharlene- I’ve Never Been to Me\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘I’ve Never Been to Me’ barely registered on the Billboard Hot 100 upon its first release- this was back in 1977 (though the record was created in 1976 with the spoken word section, deemed too feminist to be released). Its revival was sparked by a radio DJ from Tampa, Florida, who began playing the record 5 years after its release. It received such a positive response from listeners that the DJ alerted Motown’s president Jay Lasker as to the potential of the song. By this time Charlene had quit the music industry; Lasker tracked her down, signed her to Motown records, and the rest is history!\n\nThis bitter-sweet ballad is thought-provoking yet gentle, with Charlene’s calm, soothing voice backed with beautiful harmonies. The piano guides much of the music, joined by drums, bass, and strings that soar during the choruses. This version of the record also contains Charlene’s controversial spoken-word middle section (unlike the 1977 version), which is effective in its delivery and hammers home the message that paradise consists of life’s simplicities; children and rowing partners- all real in the face of the narrator’s own lack of fulfilment. She has lived a hedonistic life, with all the material luxury a person could want, but has learned the hard way that the lifestyle does not lead to a full and satisfying life. She expresses regret that she did not have children or any real friendships- instead she’s seen the lie behind the champagne and jet setting lifestyle. She is addressing a woman completely her opposite, a mother who would have liked the hedonistic life and did not understand the drawbacks of it. A powerful Number 1.\n\n“Hey lady, you, lady, cursin’ at your life\n\nYou’re a discontented mother and a rich inventive wife\n\nI’ve no doubt you dream about the things you’ll never do\n\nBut I wish someone had a talked to me like I wanna talk to you\n\nOoh I’ve been to Georgia and California, oh, anywhere I could run\n\nTook the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun\n\nBut I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free\n\nI’ve been to paradise, but I’ve never been to me\n\nPlease lady, please, lady, don’t just walk away\n\nCause I have this need to tell you why I’m all alone today\n\nI can see so much of me still living in your eyes\n\nWon’t you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies”\n\nWritten by Ron Miller and Kenneth Hirsch\n\nThe obscure side of 1982 includes an emphasis on great funk!\n\nBeyond the Chart\n\nThe Limit- Pop\n\nDid You Know?\n\n1980’s group The Limit were made up of Dutch producers Bernard Oattes and Rob Van Schaik, who managed a UK Top Twenty hit in 1985 with ‘Say Yeah’. It was taken from their self-titled album, which is available here. The duo also produced songs for other artists including Five Star with their hit ‘Love Take Over’ that same year.\n\nThis brilliantly funky rarity celebrates the feelgood nature of music, with the rhythm and vibe pop gives off. The music is a combination of prominent funk and subtle synth- upfront and cool is the bass, which slaps and pops to a funky drumbeat. It’s accompanied by off-beat piano chords, and a quiet synth helping to fill out the sound. The vocalists ad-lib to emphasise that 4-on-the-floor feel, so precise as to act as instruments themselves. The precision of the music does nothing to prevent some great off-cuff moments, notable the piano solo which overlaps the vocals and becomes more frenzied, and the vocalists themselves singing their lines over each-other by the end of the song. The emphasis is on the music, which serves also as the subject of the lyrics; ‘Pop’ is quite literally about pop; it’s ability to make people feel good and dance to its rhythm. A criminally overlooked piece of funk!\n\n“Can you feel it it’s pop, can you feel it, pop Can you feel it it’s pop, can you feel it, pop Hasn’t it been good to you and hasn’t it been good to me I’ll tell you want I’m gonna do, turn it on for you A a a check out the rhythm, a a a check out the give-or-take A a a check out the rhythm, a a a\n\nCan you feel it it’s pop, can you feel it, pop Can you feel it it’s pop, can you feel it, pop Hasn’t it been good to you and hasn’t it been good to me I tell you what I’m gonna do, turn it on for you A a a check out the rhythm, a a a check out the give-or-take, a a a…”\n\nWritten by Bernard Oattes and Rob Van Schaik\n\nMy next obscurity is straight out of the Midlands!\n\nA Final Discipline- Empty Pictures\n\nDid You Know?\n\nLed by Gary Unsworth, The Final Discipline’s origins lay in Cheshire, though they moved to Wolverhampton to attend the art college there. This record was released by Clock House Records, a label attached to the University of Keel’s music department; that same year they’d published records by The Man Upstairs, Random Access, and the vividly-named Incandescent Luminaire!\n\nThis rare record is a unique one in its musicality and mysterious lyrics. The drums are slightly experimental; sometimes a straight beat, other times missing out kick and bass drums to keep listeners feeling off-centre. The vocals are low and nearly monotone, never rising too much and, as a result, contributing to the otherworldly feeling that can’t be shaken off. This is helped all the more by the strange combination of jaunty synth and violins- an unexpected choice of instrument sound for 1982! Lyrically the ‘Empty Pictures’ represent the narrator’s great and ambitious dreams which he realises cannot come true without the person he is addressing (the pictures could be literal, as the band were art students). He feels like he is turning backwards as the dream begins to be forgotten. The words are sketchy enough to let listeners decide how to interpret them, but they are certainly effective in drawing you into the song for its 4 minute duration. An intriguing piece of music reflecting an experimental time for University students like A Final Discipline.\n\n“Empty pictures symbolising dream schemes for us Thinking of moments perfect moments Dreams I build upon too real too true too difficult to realise without you Turning backwards on the memory of a fading dream Turning backwards on the memory of a fading dream\n\nEmpty pictures symbolising dream schemes for us Thinking of moments perfect moments Turning backwards on the memory of a fading dream Turning backwards on a memory of a fading dream Turning backwards on the memory of a fading dream Turning backwards on the memory of a fading dream.”\n\nWritten by Gary Unsworth\n\n1982 was certainly a huge year for music. Along with the great variety in the Charts, Queen of Pop Madonna made her debut, with her first single ‘Everybody’ while the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, released the world’s best-selling album, ‘Thriller’! The era would see the biggest genres we associate with the decade become mainstream; glam metal, europop and techno, while hip-hop and urban music would begin to emerge. The decade would continue to explode!\n\n1993- June Chart\n\nWelcome to Songs Through Time! In this blog I aim to look back at pop music history using the charts featured on BBC Radio 2’s ‘Pick of the Pops’ show each week, providing some historical context to understand how the music of the time came to be, along with its impact on the record-buying public. I’ll be choosing a personal favourite, looking at the week’s Number 1, and uncovering more obscure songs from the same year which deserve the spotlight. Each song will be broken down and I’ll be throwing in some trivia for good measure. My aim is for you to learn something new and to discover some great artists. Happy reading!\n\nInspired by last week’s Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2, let’s take a look at 1993.\n\nJune 22 1993 Top 20\n\n20. Time Frequency- The Power Zone EP\n\n19. TTD & Des’ree- Delicate\n\n18. 2 Unlimited- Tribal Dance\n\n17. Sister Sledge- Thinking of You (Ramp Radio Remix)\n\n16. Sting- Fields of Gold\n\n15. Tina Turner- I Don’t Wanna Fight\n\n14.

Ace of Base- All That She Wants\n\n3. Haddaway- What Is Love\n\n2. Gabrielle- Dreams\n\n1. UB40- I Can’t Help Falling In Love With You\n\n1993 was a year of royal controversy, IRA terror, and the continuing tradition of British novelty records. Princess Diana suffered the glare of the newspapers, who reported her separation from Prince Charles as a divorce instead; she would soon announce her retirement from public life. The IRA continued their campaign of bombing, becoming part of the Queen’s Christmas speech calling for peace. In the background, record buyers saw remixes and reissues topping the charts, from the likes of the late Freddy Mercury with ‘Living On My Own’ and Bluebells’ 1984 song ‘Young At Heart’ while Mr Blobby’s self-titled Christmas Number 1 hit continued the trend of novelty chart-toppers. This week’s chart holds a variety of genres, including electronic dance from Time Frequency (‘The Power Zone’), synth-pop from Pet Shop Boys (‘Can You Forgive Her’), reggae from Inner Circle (‘Sweat’) and UB40’s Number 1 cover of ‘Can’t Help Falling in Love With You’. The rarer side of 1993 reveals nostalgic R&B from One Tyme and good ole-fashioned country from Johnny Paycheck!\n\nPick of the Chart\n\nSting- Fields of Gold\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘Fields of Gold’ was inspired by the 16th century manor house Sting had bought near a barley field in Wiltshire. He described the view: “In England, our house is surrounded by barley fields, and in the summer it’s fascinating to watch the wind moving over the shimmering surface, like waves on an ocean of gold. There’s something inherently sexy about the sight, something primal, as if the wind were making love to the barley. Lovers have made promises here, I’m sure, their bonds strengthened by the comforting cycle of the seasons.“\n\nThis beautiful, somewhat melancholy song takes the listener on a journey through courtship, love, and eventually, death. The music is soothing, sticking with simple drums, strings, harmonica, Northumbrian smallpipes, and an acoustic guitar plucked and often mimicking the melody Sting is singing- a very English selection of acoustic instruments. The guitar gets a solo continuing the melody, brief but calming, until Sting comes back in with the final verse. The narrator describes the fields and sky around him, as he commits to a woman he falls in love with- he’d never been able to commit and keep his promises before. Their love even makes the Heavens above them jealous. The time skips to years after the courtship of that summer, with the couple now having children who continue to run through the barley field. Then it is implied the narrator has died, with his subtle but sad changing from the present to the past tense, when they once walked the fields of gold- he asks to be remembered with that image. A nostalgic, beautiful song.\n\n“You’ll remember me when the west wind moves upon the fields of barley\n\nYou’ll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we walk in fields of gold\n\nSo she took her love for to gaze awhile upon the fields of barley\n\nIn his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold\n\nWill you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?\n\nWe’ll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we lie in fields of gold\n\nSee the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.\n\nFeel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold\n\nI never made promises lightly and there have been some that I’ve broken\n\nBut I swear in the days still left we’ll walk in fields of gold\n\nWe’ll walk in fields of gold…”\n\nWritten by Sting\n\nThis week’s Number 1 may be familiar with listeners!\n\nNumber 1\n\nUB40- Can’t Help Falling In Love With You\n\nDid You Know?\n\nFor anyone who is a fan of the 1961 Elvis Presley version of ‘Can’t Help Falling in Love With You’ (based on the melody of a 1784 French love song called ‘Plaisir d’amour’) you’ll be pleased to know it was UB40’s drummer James Brown who had suggested covering the song as it was one of his favourite Elvis tracks! The band thankfully agreed, with the intention that the song would feature in the 1992 movie ‘Honeymoon in Vegas’; however, several other artists had already covered the song for the movie, and so it was instead included in the soundtrack for the movie ‘Sliver’.\n\nThis Number 1 spins an Elvis classic on its head with UB40’s unique reggae-fusion! ‘Can’t Help Falling in Love With You’ becomes a catchy, danceable reggae track here, starting with the lead vocal backed by distinctive off-beat chords beneath the synthetic, four-on-the-floor drums and synthesisers. The middle section gets some great brass parts almost responding to the vocal lines. It’s a hyper-modernised take on the ballad, a celebration of sorts, with vocal harmonies, a big beat, and the brass instruments becoming more prominent near the end of the song. Lyrically, the narrator is singing about falling in love, knowing that he shouldn’t rush into commitment. He is questioning whether it would be a sin to stay in the relationship, a fool’s game to love, but ultimately believes it is fate to stay and commit his life to his love, as it feels as natural as the flowing of a river to the sea. An interesting take on the ballad, and UB40’s biggest hits!\n\n“Wise men say only fools rush in\n\nBut I can’t help falling in love with you\n\nWise men say only fools rush in\n\nBut I can’t help falling in love with you\n\nShall I stay would it be a sin\n\nBut I can’t help falling in love with you\n\nAs the river flows, gently to the sea\n\nDarling so we go\n\nSome things were meant to be\n\nTake my hand take my whole life too\n\nBut I can’t help falling in love with you\n\nAs the river flows, gently to the sea\n\nDarling so we go\n\nSome things were meant to be…”\n\nWritten by Hugo Peretti, Luigi Creatore and George David Weiss\n\nThe rarer side of 1993 throws up some interesting sounds, starting with this rare piece of R&B!\n\nBeyond the Chart\n\nOne Tyme- Little Girl\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAlthough there is little information available about One Tyme, the compilation cassette they feature on, ‘Whatcha Gonna Do?’ showcases at least two of their songs, ‘Little Girl’ and ‘All About Us’. The compilation itself is described as showcasing a variety of music, from soul and dancehall to rap and progressive jazz! Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear to be on YouTube.\n\nThis rare song is smooth, catchy, and nostalgic in its old soul feel. ‘Little Girl’ is backed by simple drums, bass, synths, and backing vocals which both harmonise and act as a call-and-response to the lead singer. The bass gets more funky during the choruses, with added percussion. We even get a rap performed right at the end of the song, making the music a curious mix of old soul, R&B, and new rap! In ‘Little Girl’ the girl in question is described by the narrator as seemingly flitting between two personalities; one of the sweet but infuriating little girl, the other time as a sexy, seductive woman. The narrator is confused and never sure of which of these personalities he’ll see; but he consoles himself with knowing that at least she stays with him, as she’s popular and loved by many men who wish they could be with her. An interesting rarity stepping into both the world of 1993 and the world of earlier soul and funk groups.\n\n“Sometimes it seems the girl is living into two worlds yeah One other woman I hear she changes to a little girl, well She seduces me with her eyes When she wants her way, oh, she hits me with that big smile yes she does When she’s a girl sometimes she makes me mad I’ll be real real mad (I’ll be real, real mad) Then as a woman I’m so glad to have she’s so beautiful and she has so much man (Little girl in a woman’s body) She’s so sexy she’s so naughty (Little girl in a woman’s world) She’s so sexy she’s so naughty I’m so confused cos I don’t know what personality she’ll be when At least I know wherever she’s coming from she’ll come to me yeah Cos she’s got my heart on a spin yeah When she pulls it tight oh it seems it’s like the endless sea girl…”\n\nWritten by One Tyme (Credits Unavailable)\n\nMy next obscurity may be known to country-fans!\n\nJohnny Paycheck- Next of Kin\n\nDid You Know?\n\nMost will know country musician Johnny Paycheck for his 1977 hit ‘Take This Job And Shove It’ which was written by singer David Allan Coe. His success before then was mostly only in the Country Music charts, up until he changed his image to that of an outlaw. By the 1990’s he had suffered from tax problems, drug addiction and from coming out of time spent in prison but continued performing and releasing music right up until the early 2000’s.\n\nThis obscure country song from multi-instrumentalist Johnny Paycheck is a catchy love song with hints of desperation beneath the up-beat music. A straight 4/4 beat is backed by simple guitar chords, a typical root-five bassline, subtle harmonies and strings, plus some electric guitar for good measure. We’re treated to a pleasant guitar solo and some piano near the middle of the song- it’s a kitchen sink full of feel-good instruments! Lyrically, ‘Next of Kin’ is used as a euphemism by the narrator to hit home that he would die if his partner decided to leave him after some terse words he’d said to her. He describes a funeral scene, right down to the words on his headstone and the tears in his mother’s eyes should she leave him- it’s dramatic and perhaps over-the-top for her to hear but the narrator is desperate for her to stay and give him a reason to live. The contrast between the up-beat music and the lyrics couldn’t be more stark- an interesting piece of country.\n\n“New suit new tie big ol’ tears in my momma’s eyes\n\nPreacher man tells my friends they’ll see me in the bye and bye\n\nIf you say our love is gonna end\n\nYou’ll have to call my next of kin\n\nA limousine long and black I finally ride in a Cadillac\n\nI’ll leave my truck to brother Buck cause I won’t be coming back\n\nIf you say it’s over it’ll do me in\n\nYou’ll have to call my next of kin\n\nYou’ll be following close behind me\n\nDriving with your headlights on\n\nThis man died from a broken heart\n\nWill be written on my stone\n\nThey’ll lower me six feet deep in the cold cold ground\n\nYou’re gonna hurt throw in some dirt as the family gathers round\n\nIf you leave me here I’ll just cash it in\n\nYou’ll have to call my next of kin\n\nSo unpack my teddy back I’m sorry for the things I’ve said\n\nCrazy me can’t you see without you I’m as good as dead\n\nIf you walk out I won’t be breathing in\n\nYou’ll have to call my next of kin\n\nYeah if you walk out I won’t be breathing in\n\nYou’ll have to call my next of kin.”\n\nWritten by Johnny Paycheck (?)\n\n1993 certainly demonstrated a variety of music in and out of the charts, everything from reggae to Europop. The lavish and gaudy nature of the previous decade had long since faded, allowing for a more stripped-back approach to rock, and an emphasis on simple and catchy beats for pop. These were encapsulated in the likes of Grunge and Britpop, but for young teenagers boy and girl bands were all the rage. It can be argued that this era was to be the last for big, sweeping sub-genres- the 2000’s would emerge with music so readily accessible via the Internet that no group of people could be guaranteed to like the same music, and therefore to create as many huge sub-cultures. Music would go through its biggest transformation in decades.\n\nThrough Time- Music of the Viking Age\n\nWelcome to the intermediary post of the blog! Here I’ll be exploring the importance and styles of music in differing time periods and their meaning in past cultures; everyone from the Romans and Greeks to the Celts and Medieval Europeans.\n\nThis month’s historical post will be exploring the music of the Vikings, Norse seafarers who explored, traded, and raided much of Northern Europe and beyond from the 8th to 11th centuries. Unfortunately they had not yet formed a written system of music with which to note down any of their music or songs until just after the end of the age; however we are lucky enough to have discovered a variety of Nordic instruments, and to know how and when they would have been used in relation to Viking culture and religion. We’ve also songs from immediately after the age; the oldest written Scandinavian music, plus some brilliant interpretations created based on Norse poetry!\n\nViking Instruments and Roles\n\nThe common image of the Vikings are of a loud, rowdy, loud group of pillaging barbarians. This is probably helped along by the accounts of travellers who came across them, even in describing their music; take this example from an Arab merchant in 950 AD: “Never before I have heard uglier songs than those of the Vikings in Slesvig. The growling sound coming from their throats reminds me of dogs howling, only more untamed.” Their instruments consisted of woodwind and string instruments; pan flutes made from cow’s horns, sheep bones and other animal parts, horn pipes (similar to bagpipes), an instrument resembling the lyre, harps and rebecs, covered in my post on the music of Medieval England. The Vikings regarded professional musicians in both a respected manner, and a judgemental one. There were generally two kinds of musicians; skalds, and jesters. Skalds travelled the land, entertaining the courts of various kings and Viking chiefs with sung poetry and songs. Jesters were not so lucky. They were widely regarded with disdain, to the point where it was legal to kill a jester without punishment!\n\nViking Music Interpretation- Poetic Edda\n\nGiven how ingrained the image of the Viking is in popular culture, it is perhaps not a surprise that many musicians have recreated as music of the Nordic sound as possible in their songs. Genres such as Viking Metal have emerged, and the recent TV show ‘Vikings’ seeks to capture the civilisation with soundtracks owing much to the discovered instruments and notation from a few centuries later. However, modern songs also take from Nordic writings referring to mythology- one particular set of poems, estimated to have been written between the 10th and 13th centuries, still captures the imagination surrounding The Vikings and their immediate descendants. The Poetic Edda is a collection of poems from anonymous authors full of vivid imagery, alliterative devices, and references to Nordic mythology. The best known of these poems, Voluspa, forms the basis of the song below, and is estimated to be written at the time of the Vikings!\n\nInterpretation Example- Voluspa (Yggdrasil)\n\nPerformed by German folk band Duivelspack, Voluspa takes on an incredible magic as the primitive drums, haunting lute, sweet flute and deep, sometimes harmonised vocals bring the beautifully vivid poem to life. The melody is played by the instruments before being sang in Old Norse. There’s an exotic, haunting sense of the old brought out with the simple backing and beautiful vocals singing an ancient language. They sing sometimes in unity, sometimes in harmony, and other times with their own lines over the top of one another- it’s a wonderfully eloquent arrangement, making the words almost spiral. The flute gets its own solo, performing the main melody which gets taken on by the lute and by the low, soothing humming at the end of the music. The poem taken for the music refers to Yggdrasil, the world tree at the centre of the cosmos, and the creation of the world through the voice of a religious seer or shaman, known as a volva. She refers to three all-knowing maids who came from Urdhr (referencing a well beneath Yggdrasil); Urdh, Verdhandi, and Skuld. who created laws and the fates of mankind. The ability to bring the poetry of the Vikings to life through music is perfectly demonstrated here.\n\n“An ash I know it stands, it is named Yggdrasill. High tree, sprinkled with white mud; There from come the dews that fall on the dale! It stands always green, above, the source of Urdhr. There from come the maids, much knowing; three, their dwelling, stands under the tree; Urdh is named one, The other Verdhandi They notched (scored) wood – Skuld is the third. They set up the laws, they decided on the lives Of the children of time (‘the children of man’). They promulgate fate. “\n\nWritten based on Poetic Edda (Anonymous)\n\nThe following interpretation also draws from the Poetic Edda, from one of the poems making up its manuscript, the Codex Regius (‘King’s Book’).\n\nWardruna- Helvegan (The Way to Hel)\n\nTaking its final stanzas from the poem Havamal, ‘Helvegan’ is hauntingly beautiful song in which the narrator is questioning who will sing them to the other side when they die. To begin with, there is little but the sound of a storm. Then the sound of birds cawing, and a steady drum bring with them the vocals. A lone man sings, before a whole group of men and women come in, harmonising and singing in unison. The atmosphere they create is utterly beautiful, with a low hum of chording in the background to complement the drum. Eventually the drums fill out with a staggered rhythm, and a form of tambourine- the impression is almost of celebration, the spirituality easily felt. The powerful clamour of voices and drums then goes out to leave the lone man singing, calm and peaceful against the returning sound of the rain in the background. It’s a riveting piece of Norse spirituality, paying homage to its ties with the god Odin and the Vikings’ belief in the afterlife; for them Hel was a place beneath the Earth where regular families would go to after dying, a type of Underworld.\n\n“Who shall sing me into the death-sleep sling me\n\nWhen I walk on the Path of Death and the tracks I tread are cold, so coldI sought the songs, I sent the songs\n\nwhen the deepest well gave me the drops so touched\n\nof Death-fathers wager\n\nI know it all, Odin\n\nwhere you hid your eyeWho shall sing me into the death-sleep sling me\n\nWhen I walk on the Path of Death and the tracks I tread are cold, so cold\n\nearly in the days end still the raven knows if I fall\n\nWhen you stand by the Gate of Death\n\nAnd you have to tear free\n\nI shall follow you across the Resounding Bridge with my song\n\nYou will be free from the bonds that bind you!\n\nYou are free from the bonds that bound that you!\n\nCattle die, kinsmen die\n\nYou yourself will also die but the word about you will never die\n\nif you win a good reputation\n\nCattle die, kinsmen die\n\nYou yourself will also die\n\nI know one that never dies the reputation of those who died”\n\nWritten by Wardruna except final two stanzas; taken from Codex Reguis- Havamal\n\nOldest Scandinavian Song\n\nMy final example is from the Codex Runicus, a 700-year old manuscript written in medieval runes. The runes actually correspond with letters of the Latin alphabet, written on parchment. This separate manuscript included the oldest ever Nordic law, Scanian Law, a chronical of Danish monarchs, and a description of a Danish-Swedish border. More interesting here is that it contained a very early form of musical notation, making the following song the oldest written secular Scandinavian song!\n\nDromde mik en drom i nat (I Dreamt A Dream Last Night)\n\nThis fascinating secular Norse song was written in around 1300, forming the final note of the Codex Runicus. It is performed beautifully, starting out with the melody line being played exclusively on a flute- peaceful and relaxing. It is then joined by the strumming of a G-note drone, before the vocals come in and sing the few lines we still have from the manuscript. Then the music is filled out with harmonies, a fiddle, and a tambourine. The flute is given most of the chance to play the melody, in harmony with the lower positioning of the fiddle, before the vocals come back in with a beautiful harmony. It is unfortunate this wonderful version cuts off so soon, but it is a brilliant demonstration of the type of music Norsemen would have performed and listened to. Lyrically, the two lines we have are open to many interpretations due to the vague meanings behind certain words. They are listed below, with the final two interpretations being the most realistic as they refer more to dreaming of justice than luxury (thereby linking this note to the rest of the manuscript, which concerns itself with Nordic law).\n\n“Drømde mik en drøm i nat um silki ok ærlik pæl\n\n(I dreamt a dream last night of silk and fine fur)\n\n(I dreamt a dream last night of silk and expensive cloth)\n\n(I dreamt a dream last night of justice and fair play)\n\n(I dreamt a dream last night of equality and honest measure)”\n\nWritten by anonymous, as part of the Codex Runicus\n\nViking culture still fascinates us today, with its association with its various gods, who’ve since been incorporated into our culture (Thursday meaning ‘Thor’s Day’) and the inclusion of a reimagined Asgard in the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. The truth is, they are still something of a mystery, especially in terms of their music, yet it can still be pictured; drum-heavy battle songs, flutes, lyres, fiddles, and the inclusion of their gods in the lyrics. Interpretations, particularly those sang in the now-extinct Old Norse language, can continue to keep the music of warriors alive- even if they were described as sounding like ‘dogs howling’.\n\n1964- June Chart\n\nWelcome to Songs Through Time! In this blog I aim to look back at pop music history using the charts featured on BBC Radio 2’s ‘Pick of the Pops’ show each week, providing some historical context to understand how the music of the time came to be, along with its impact on the record-buying public. I’ll be choosing a personal favourite, looking at the week’s Number 1, and uncovering more obscure songs from the same year which deserve the spotlight. Each song will be broken down and I’ll be throwing in some trivia for good measure. My aim is for you to learn something new and to discover some great artists. Happy reading!\n\nInspired by last week’s Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2, let’s take a look at 1964.\n\nJune 15 1964 Top 20\n\n20. Freddie & The Dreamers- I Love You Baby\n\n19. The Fourmost- A Little Loving\n\n18. Gigliola Cinquetti- Non Ho L’Eta Per Amarti\n\n17. Dionne Warwick- Walk On By\n\n16. The Swinging Blue Jeans- You’re No Good\n\n15.

Cilla Black- You’re My World\n\n1964 was an explosive year for teenage record-buyers! The Beatles’ mass hysteria and popularity reached the United States, helped along by their first ever movie, ‘A Hard Day’s Night’ and John Lennon’s book, ‘In His Own Write’. Britain was treated to the first ever broadcasting of Top of the Pops, their first regular pirate radio station, Radio Caroline, and the birth of the Queen’s fourth child, Edward. This week’s charts start to reflect the new beat groups inspired by the success of The Fab Four with The Dave Clark Five (Can’t You See That She’s Mine), The Fourmost (A Little Loving) and The Four Pennies (Juliet). Alongside these groups are sole singers like Cliff Richard (Constantly) and Louis Armstrong (Hello, Dolly!) along with some Motown from Mary Wells (My Guy) and rock and roll from Chuck Berry (No Particular Place to Go). The rarer side of 1964 showcases some pre-Led-Zeppelin Jimmy Page in the form of The First Gear, plus a brilliant cover version of a jazz favourite from ‘Venus’ singer Mariska Veres!\n\nMy Pick of the Chart\n\nDionne Warwick- Walk On By\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOne of the writers of ‘Walk On By’, Burt Bacharach, had a good feeling about his time recording the song and others in the studio! He said, “‘Walk On By’ was the first time that I tried putting two grand pianos on a record in the studio. I can’t remember if I played and Artie Butler played or if Paul Griffin and Artie Butler played but here were two grand pianos going on. I knew the song had something. It was a great date. I walked out of that studio and we had done two tunes in a three-hour session, ‘Walk On By’ and ‘Anyone Who Had A Heart.’ I felt very good leaving knowing that I had two monster hits on my hands. You never know for sure but you feel a great satisfaction.”\n\nThis classic piece of rhythm and blues is relaxing to hear but doesn’t try to hide the heart-breaking lyrics. The musical backing is smooth and precise, with simple bass, twin pianos, off-beat guitar, an iconic brass riff, and strings for good measure! Everything about the music is nuanced, subtly allowing certain instruments moments of brilliance; the trumpet seemingly responding to Dionne Warwick’s choruses; the broken and full chords of the pianos during quieter moments, even the sweet and intense strings during the middle section. Warwick sings pleasantly but with strength as she conveys the sad message of the song. ‘Walk On By’ is about a woman telling her former partner to leave her alone. She can’t stand to be around him, and so for the sake of her pride and need for privacy to grieve the loss of their relationship, she tells him to carry on walking if he sees her. It’s a sad song of wanting dignity, to hide how broken you are; Warwick’s rich, strong voice gives the message even more weight. An unmissable Pick of the Chart.\n\n“If you see me walking down the street\n\nAnd I start to cry each time we meet\n\nWalk on by\n\nWalk on by\n\nMake believe that you don’t see the tears\n\nJust let me grieve in private\n\nCause each time I see you I break down and cry\n\nWalk on by\n\nI just can’t get over losing you and so if I seem broken and blue\n\nWalk on by\n\nWalk on by\n\nFoolish pride that’s all that I have left\n\nSo let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me when you said goodbye\n\nWalk on by…”\n\nWritten by Burt Bacharach and Hall David\n\nThis week’s Number 1 is by a beloved favourite and icon of Liverpool!\n\nNumber 1\n\nCilla Black- You’re My World\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘You’re My World’ was originally an Italian song (Il Mio Mondo) recorded in 1963 by its co-writer Umberto Bindi. With the help of American songwriter Carl Sigman, it was rewritten in English, having caught the attention of The Beatles’ legendary producer, George Martin. Sigman’s son Michael commented on his father’s lyrics, saying: “Inspired by Umberto Bindi’s haunting melody, Carl evoked Gino Paoli’s Italian title (translating from Italian as ‘My World’). But he created a wholly original English lyric”. A quick link from my Pick of the Chart- Dionne and Cilla are linked by their versions (originally Warwick’s) of ‘Anyone Who Had A Heart’!\n\nThis fabulous Number 1 from Cilla is gentle at times, and powerful in others, but always beautiful. Led sometimes by piano, and other times by excitable drums and sweet strings, Cilla Black’s amazing vocals are given a great backing to rest on. ‘You’re My World’ varies its dynamics enough to take you on a 3-minute journey of sorts; it starts off with some strings, before they quickly are replaced by soft piano backing Black’s gentle voice. Things build up as the strings re-enter, followed by bass, drums that almost march, and then the chorus becomes powerful and utterly emotional, with vocal backing group The Breakaways joining in- a sheer rollercoaster of light and shade that continues throughout. Lyrically, ‘You’re My World’ is a sheer love ballad, describing the narrator’s love for somebody as being the centre of her world, of consisting of elements she can see in her love rather than in the natural beauty of the real world. A stunning ballad, affecting enough to have been spontaneously sang years later at her funeral mass in August 2015 by her fans.\n\n“You’re my world, you’re every breath I take\n\nYou’re my world, every move I make\n\nOther eyes see the stars up in the skies\n\nBut for me they shine within your eyes\n\nAs the trees reach for the sun above\n\nSo my arms reach out to you for love\n\nWith your hand resting in mine\n\nI feel a power so divine\n\nYou’re my world, you are my night and day\n\nYou’re my world, you’re every prayer I pray\n\nIf our love ceases to be\n\nThen it’s the end of my world for me…”\n\nWritten by Umberto Bindi, Gino Paoli and Carl Sigman\n\nThe rarer side of 1964 offers a look at young, promising musicians who would soon become household names!\n\nBeyond the Chart\n\nFirst Gear- Leave My Kitten Alone\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘Leave My Kitten Alone’ was written back in 1959, first recorded that year by one of its writers, Little Willie John. It’s since been covered by multiple artists, from Johnny Preston to Solomon Burke and even The Beatles! Their version can be found on The Beatles Anthology 1 compilation album, released in 1995. Then-session-guitarist Jimmy Page was brought in for this version, adding that incredible, beat-destroying guitar break in the middle of the song!\n\nThis rare, rocking single combines rip-roaring guitar and the 12-bar blues with wacky metaphorical lyrics! ‘Leave My Kitten Alone’ is 2 minutes of straight, fast blues-rock, taking influence from The Beatles with its emphasis on guitar and harmony backing vocals. Its straightforward beat is broken up with stops and starts leaving the vocals bare to end the verses before a drum fill brings things back up to speed. Before you know it, Jimmy Page unleashes an 1000 note flurry he’d later become famous for, actually overpowering the underlying rhythm of the music with an incredibly heavy, flashy guitar solo faster perhaps than anyone in 1964 could have imagined! The lyrics are slightly bizarre and violent; the narrator is threatening someone he calls a bulldog to stay away from his girlfriend, his ‘kitten’, even threatening to hit him and make him wish he was dead. It’s a strange combination of animal metaphors and violence, making this single wacky despite its rocking backing.\n\n“Well you better leave my kitten alone, yeah you better leave my kitten alone I don’t tell you big bad bulldog you better leave her alone Well don’t you know my kitten is a dream, yeah don’t you know my kitten is a dream So get your hands up off her cos I’m a loving man\n\nWell Mr Dog I’m gonna hit you on the top of your head That girl’s gonna miss you, you gonna wish that you were dead If you don’t leave my kitten alone Well I love my little kitten just like you hound dogs love your bones\n\nWell Mr Dog I’m gonna hit you on the top of your head That girl’s gonna miss you, you gonna wish that you were dead If you don’t leave my kitten alone Well I love my little kitten just like you hound dogs love your bones Well I love my little kitten just like you hound dogs love your bones”\n\nWritten by Little Willie John, Titus Turner and James McDougal\n\nThis post’s next obscurity shines the light on another musician before they were famous!\n\nMariska Veres- Summertime\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘Summertime’ at this point was already 30 years old, having been composed by George Gershwin for the 1935 opera ‘Porgy and Bess’. The writer of the novel version of ‘Porgy and Bess’, DuBose Heyward, provided the lyrics, inspired by a southern folk lullaby called ‘All My Trials’. As for Mariska Veres, who would go on to become the lead singer of Shocking Blue (famous for their 1969 single ‘Venus’) she recorded this version of ‘Summertime’ at the young age of 16!\n\nThis cover of the jazz standard showcases the early promise of Mariska Veres’ beautiful, powerful voice. Recorded with the band Les Mysteres, Veres’ first ever recording offers her a simple backing of guitars and bass, starting off slowly to let her freely sing that iconic opening line, and then jumping into a faster, consistent beat. We also get a nice, jazzy guitar solo before it returns to adding an extra little melody to Veres. Her voice at 16 is incredible; strong, clear and mature- you could almost imagine her continuing jazz and not moving into rock! Lyrically, ‘Summertime’ was written as a lullaby for ‘Porgy and Bess’ and its easy to see why- it describes a positive, happy life in the summer; in context it is soothing children of the American South, African-American cotton pickers, with assurances that the cotton is high and there are plenty of fish. The narrator is reassuring and calming, seemingly exaggerating how good life is for the sake of who they are singing to. A very interesting cover version!\n\n“Summertime and the livin’ is easy\n\nFish are jumpin’ and the cotton is high\n\nOh your daddy’s rich and your mommy is good lookin’\n\nSo hush little baby don’t you cry\n\nOne of these mornin’s you’re gonna rise up singin’\n\nThen you’ll spread your wings and you’ll take to the sky\n\nBut ’til that mornin’ comes, there’s anothin’ can harm you\n\nSo hush little baby don’t you cry\n\nSummertime and the livin’ is easy\n\nFish are jumpin’ and the cotton is high But ’til that mornin’ comes, there’s anothin’ can harm you\n\nSo hush little baby don’t you cry, summertime, summertime…”\n\nWritten by Dubose Heyward and Ira Gershwin\n\n1964 was certainly an exciting year for record-buyers. America was treated to the wave of talent already causing the music industry to boom, and musicians at their zenith in terms of popularity would soon feel able to experiment with their styles. The arrival of Bob Dylan’s iconic records across the pond, George Martin’s increasing experiments in the recording studio, and the explosion of the counter-culture and musical underground would soon impact music forever. The rules of the pop world had been established- suits, singles no longer than 2-3 minutes, formality and the ballrooms- it was time for them to be broken!\n\n1979- June Chart\n\nWelcome to Songs Through Time! In this blog I aim to look back at pop music history using the charts featured on BBC Radio 2’s ‘Pick of the Pops’ show each week, providing some historical context to understand how the music of the time came to be, along with its impact on the record-buying public. I’ll be choosing a personal favourite, looking at the week’s Number 1, and uncovering more obscure songs from the same year which deserve the spotlight. Each song will be broken down and I’ll be throwing in some trivia for good measure. My aim is for you to learn something new and to discover some great artists. Happy reading!\n\nInspired by last week’s Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2, let’s take a look at 1979.\n\nJune 8 1979 Top 20\n\n20. Tubeway Army- Are Friends Electric?\n\n19. The Undertones- Jimmy Jimmy\n\n18. Art Garfunkel- Bright Eyes\n\n17. The Skids- Masquerades\n\n16. The Police- Roxanne\n\n15. Eruption- One Way Ticket\n\n14. Sparks- The Number One Song In Heaven\n\n13. Gary Moore- Parisienne Walkways\n\n12. ABBA- Does Your Mother Know\n\n11. Donna Summer- Hot Stuff\n\n10. The Shadows- Theme From The Deer Hunter\n\n9. David Bowie- Boys Keep Swinging\n\n8. McFadden & Whitehead- Ain’t Know Stopping Us Now\n\n7. M- Pop Muzik\n\n6. ELO- Shine A Little Love\n\n5. Peaches & Herb- Reunited\n\n4. Earth, Wind & Fire feat. The Emotions- Boogie Wonderland\n\n3. Anita Ward- Ring My Bell\n\n2. Roxy Music- Dance Away\n\n1. Blondie- Sunday Girl\n\n1979 was a year of emerging genres, a brand-new Government, and the anticipation of a new decade. It was the year of emerging electropop, 2 Tone, and even rap courtesy of The Sugarhill Gang, all under the rule of the UK’s first female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. The Winter of Discontent, a period of time marked by an increase in strikes, came to an end, Elton John became the first Western musician to perform in South Korea, and Brighton established its first ever nudist beach! This week’s charts reflect the newest music trends; New Wave and post-punk rules supreme with the likes of The Police (Roxanne), The Undertones (Jimmy Jimmy) and Blondie’s brilliant Number 1 (Sunday Girl). Disco enjoys successes with Earth, Wind & Fire (Boogie Wonderland) and Donna Summer (Hot Stuff) while a host of pop (ABBA), rock (Gary Moore) and synthpop (Tubeway Army) lend even more variety to the Top Twenty. The obscure side of the year offers some catchy disco from Fantasy and full-blown space pop from CC Mann!\n\nMy Pick of the Chart\n\nDonna Summer- Hot Stuff\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe song-writing trio responsible for writing this disco hit had a fair few other great credits to their names! Bellotte had co-written other Donna Summer hits such as ‘Love To Love You Baby’ and ‘Heaven Knows’; Faltermeyer had his own solo hit with ‘Axel F’ in 1984 (featuring famously in the Eddie Murphy movie series ‘Beverly Hills Cop’), while Forsey is credited for the likes of Simple Minds (‘Don’t You Forget About Me’) and Bob Seger (Shakedown)!\n\nThis disco classic is quite literally ‘hot’! It’s everything you’d want from a sizzling disco tune- a strong 4/4 drum beat, a memorable riff, raw guitar chords, funky bass (often playing octaves, traditional in disco), and the Queen of Disco’s vocals, backed with some swift harmony during the brilliant choruses and the chance for the backing vocalists to sing the main line on their own. We even get an lengthy, powerful guitar solo courtesy of one-time-member of Steely Dan, Jeff Baxer! ‘Hot Stuff’ means business, with a catchy, strong musical backing to Summer’s vocals consisting of not only disco, but also rock tropes. She portrays a libidinous wild child wanting ‘hot stuff’ and trying to get it by ringing as many men as she knows. It’s implied she’s alone and fed up with the loneliness at night, prompting her need. Not surprising that this has since become one of Donna Summer’s most famous songs- one that couldn’t be ignored in this Top Twenty!\n\n“Sittin’ here, eatin’ my heart out waitin’\n\nWaitin’ for some lover to call\n\nDialed about a thousand numbers lately\n\nAlmost rang the phone off the wall\n\nLookin’ for some hot stuff, baby this evenin’\n\nI need some hot stuff, baby tonight\n\nI want some hot stuff, baby this evenin’\n\nGotta have some hot stuff\n\nGotta have some love tonight\n\n(Hot stuff)\n\nI need hot stuff\n\nI want some hot stuff\n\nI need hot stuff\n\nLookin’ for a lover who needs another\n\nDon’t want another night on my own\n\nWanna share my love with a warm blooded lover\n\nWanna bring a wild man back home…”\n\nWritten by Pete Bellotte, Harold Faltermeyer and Keith Forsey\n\nThis week’s Number 1 is ruled by America!\n\nNumber 1\n\nBlondie- Sunday Girl\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘Sunday Girl’ was reportedly written by Chris Stein to cheer up Debbie Harry; her cat Sunday Man had run away while the band were on tour! It wasn’t only sung in English either; a French version of the record was released as a 12″ single. Later, a bilingual version appeared on both ‘The Best of Blondie’ album in 1981, and 2002’s ‘Greatest Hits’ compilation. Oddly enough, the single was not released in Blondie’s native America at the time!\n\nThis classic Blondie track helps reinforce the band’s change of musical style from punk to pop. ‘Sunday Girl’ is a sweet piece of power pop, with Debbie Harry’s smooth vocals, modulating guitar playing some upbeat major chords, and steady drums providing a double back-beat. Lyrically the inspiration for ‘Sunday Girl’ is losing Harry’s cat, but they contain a very different context; a girl who finds out from the narrator that her guy has been seen going out with someone else. He has been seeing them both, with the crying girl being ‘Sunday girl’ representing the day she gets to see him. She also deals with strict, uptight parents who won’t let her go out, forcing her to stay at home battling her sadness until he comes again. Considering the upbeat nature of the music, the lyrics are truly sad, dealing with feelings of need, a desperation to escape, and the inability as a result of tough parents to go out and consolidate a relationship. A relatable Number 1 for many.\n\n“I know a girl from a lonely street\n\nCold as ice cream but still as sweet\n\nDry your eyes Sunday girl\n\nHey, I saw your guy with a different girl\n\nLooks like he’s in another world\n\nRun and hide Sunday girl\n\nHurry up, hurry up and wait\n\nI stay away all week and still I wait\n\nI got the blues, please come see\n\nWhat your loving means to me\n\nShe can’t catch up with the working crowd\n\nThe weekend mood and she’s feeling proud\n\nLive in dreams Sunday girl\n\nBaby, I would like to go out tonight\n\nIf I go with you my folks’l"
