        "text": "Born and raised in South London, Charlene first picked up her father’s guitar at the age of 5, and played her first show at 8. She was inspired by artists such as David Bowie, The Beatles, Pink Floyd and King Crimson, and was very interested in the prog-rock genre.\n\nShe was accepted into the BRIT School alongside future chart artists Adele, Jessie J and Kate Nash & began performing as a solo artist in 2008, releasing the EPs ‘Daffodils and Other Idylls’, ‘Postcards from iO’ and ‘One of the Sun’. The former reached the top of the UK Folk Chart on iTunes. An iTunes Live Sessions EP was also released after she performed at the festival in early 2008.\n\nCharlene fully connected with a mainstream audience in 2011 when her cover of “Wherever You Will Go” by The Calling was featured in a Twinings commercial. The song was subsequently released as a digital download on iTunes and reached number 2 on the UK Download Chart and number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. Her debut album Moonchild, featuring the song as a bonus track, was released on 21 November 2011.\n\nCharlene’s second album ‘Love is the Law‘, featuring co-writes with the likes of Eg White, Jim Eliot and Cathy Dennis, was released in late 2014 to critical acclaim.\n\nAfter a flurry of songwriting and intimate self produced recordings in her South London home studio, she moved to the West Country and released the album Where Is My Tribe in Early 2019."
