        "text": "What Our Customers Are Saying\n\n I am a Steinway and Sons artist, have sold millions of recordings and had over 30 White House performances. Requests were made at a White House party for some Stevie Wonder tunes so I immediately pulled out my iPad, summoned Musicnotes and bought sheet music for \"Overjoyed\" and \"Ribbon in the Sky\". Your company has made me look great in so many performances. Thank you for this fabulous gift musicnotes is to performers.\n\n I sing some of the most current songs thanks to Musicnotes. I do not know how I would be able to find such great quality piano pieces and such an affordable price anywhere else. I love that I can find basically any song I want in your wide variety of music. I am also glad that you give a preview of the song so I can hear it before I buy it. This site is such a huge help to my performing abilities and is the ONLY site that I will buy sheet music from.\n\n As a piano bar performer I must try to play all requests. I need the sheet music now, today, while it is hot and can earn me tips. I don't have time to find it in a collection or something containing songs I already have, or to wait for the Post Office to deliver it to me. With Musicnotes I can order it, pay for it, and have it in minutes. I can use the song that night & make a better living."
