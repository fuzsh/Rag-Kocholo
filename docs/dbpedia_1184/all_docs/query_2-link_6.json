        "text": "Post by HER MINAJesty on\n\nOh this is his 2nd album? I wasn't aware of that\n\nI haven't heard Charlene yet, but I like \"Comin From Where I'm From\" and Im also really enjoying \"My 1st Love\" featuring LaToiya Williams\n\nThat song is hot, they take it to church big time on that one, I wish that was his 2nd single, or a future single\n\nbut somehow I dont know if his album will get more than 2 singles\n\nI saw his album yesterday at HMV for $19.99, and it was \"on sale\", lol. I was tempted, but I didn't get it.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nYes, his first album \"XTC\" was released in 1996. It was critically acclaimed, but it didn't sell well and was discontinued.\n\nI'm not a big fan of \"My First Love,\" mainly because it's one of those songs where I like the original so much that I hate any covers of it.\n\nPost by krazymack on\n\nI've got to hear Anthony's track \"Charlene\" because right now I'm really loving \"Comin' From Where I'm From.\" That's probably one of my favorite Urban AC songs on the chart right now. The song exemplifies some good darn R&B soul! I love it to death.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nANTHONY HAMILTON\n\nCharlene\n\nProducer(s): Mark Batson\n\nWriter(s): A. Hamilton, M. Batson\n\nPublisher(s): Songs of Universal/Tappy Whyte's Music/Bat Future Music, BMI\n\nGenre: R&B/HIP-HOP\n\nLabel/Catalog Number: So So Def/Arista 57597 (CD promo)\n\nSource: Billboard Magazine\n\nOriginally Reviewed: March 20, 2004\n\nHaving shared a bit of himself by way of his debut single, \"Comin' From Where I'm From,\" Anthony Hamilton opens his heart and soul again with \"Charlene.\" Hamilton tells the semi-autobiographical tale of an artist who is so focused on his career that he doesn't realize what's important in his life—his woman and child—until it's too late: \"Baby, I'll be sitting here waiting on you to come home again/I won't leave/Promise I'll be here till the very end/And I'll be by your side/To protect you and to love and to be with you for life.\" Hamilton's gritty, church-honed voice conveys the ballad's sentiment with such emotion that you feel as if you have also gone through the experience. Adult R&B radio should be all over this one. This is the essence of soul music.—RH\n\nPost by krazymack on\n\nWow, this song was out since January.\n\nYet it is just blowing up and receiving attention at Urban radio at the end of July. ??? The song spin gains at the format now stands at +208.\n\nI have two reasons which might explain Anthony Hamilton's \"Charlene,\" doing well right now. His multiple award nominations at the Soul Train Awards, Grammies and BET awards.\n\nAlso his current hit with Jadakiss called \"Why\" is blowing up right now. So I think they're really pushing him to walk in R. Kelly's footsteps.\n\nPost by Bob on\n\nkrazymack said:\n\nI particularly don't care if you \"really don't know about that\" comparison because it's called an opinion. *shrugs*\n\nas was mine, grow up and dust that dirt off your shoulder!\n\nPost by krazymack on\n\nBob said:\n\nas was mine, grow up and dust that dirt off your shoulder!\n\nI'm already grown up and I don't need YOU of all people to tell me that. Lol!\n\nPost by Blacmajic on\n\nI think Charlene was a good choice for a release. His album is a soulful breath of fresh air. He sounds like a grown man singing grown folks music.\n\nI love his voice. It would be nice to hear him do something with Syleena Johnson. That would sound real classy. His song with LaToiya Williams is nice too.\n\nPost by Me. I Am Justin... on\n\nI love \"Charlene\", but \"I'm A Mess\" is my favorite on the album. I hope the release that in the future, but they probably won't ....\n\nPost by HER MINAJesty on\n\nlol...alot of people ask for MP3's, why don't you guys just download the songs off WinMX or whatever program?\n\nbut anyway, a 7 minute version of \"Charlene\"? I like Anthony Hamilton and he's got a great voice but I have a feeling I'd be bored to tears after the first 45 seconds, if I even got that far. I can't even listen to the original for more than 10 seconds.\n\nPost by WhySoSerious? on\n\nI love \"Chyna Black\" and want it to be his next single, but I don't think urban will play it. >:( It's too laid back and has a rock-ish vibe."
