But May won't mark Charlene's first steps into the limelight. After all, her 2011 single \"Dress and Tie\" was featured on Delta Airline flights, her loyal-beyond-words fans helped to raise $33,000 for the new album, and if that wasn't enough, she went to the Grammys on the arm of her friend, Glee's Darren Criss (whose smooth voice is also featured on \"Dress and Tie\"). And just for all of you *Glamour *readers, we have the exclusive video premiere for \"Animal Love I,\" the first single off her new album!\n\nGlamour: Woah, that whole thing was done in one shot?! How did you come up with the concept for the video?\n\nLiann: We always knew that we wanted to do a one-shot video, but because the camera was rolling the entire time, our biggest concerns were hiding the lights and making sure the actors didn't trip over the props! Then we thought, \"Hey, let's make the dancers the 'props' and have the boys carry the light sources.\" It was still pretty tricky, but problem solving definitely inspired us to create a hunt with flashlights through a forest of human trees.\n\nGlamour: Good thinking! Who designed the costumes for the video?\n\nLiann: Lara de Brujin is an NYU grad we found by blasting their theater/design mailing list! She's incredible and I can't believe she agreed to make all of those costumes for basically nothing. Aren't they amazing?\n\nGlamour: Love them! So, what's it like working with your sister?\n\nCharlene: I love working with Liann. She's no nonsense, organized and incredibly creative. It's easy because we can be direct with each other without it having to be a matter of ego.\n\nLiann: Plus, she's the only artist I can walk up to an say, \"I'm not into the way you did your hair...fix it!\" without spending 20 minutes tiptoeing around the subject. We're very efficient together!\n\nGlamour: What was your favorite part about making the video?\n\nCharlene: I had a ball learning how to dance. My only dance experience was being on the cheer squad in eighth grade, so it was fun to get back into it again. I'm no Fred Astaire, but I hope the energy translates...even if there are no high kicks!\n\nGlamour: What was the hardest part about making the video?\n\nLiann: We knew that doing a one-shot video was going to be hard, no matter what. Everyone had to remember about a billion things. Off screen, we had people grabbing the lantern, handing it back, spotting the camerawoman, turning on lights, and many times crawling around the floor to get out of the shot. We shot it 21 times, and every time we messed up, we had to do it all over again!\n\nGlamour: What are you the most proud of with this video?\n\nCharlene: The moment where we caught the take we used. Our camerawoman yelled out, \"Cut! That was the best one ever!\" and everyone whoops in joy. We liked that so much that we kept it in the actual music video, so you can hear everyone cheering at the end.\n\nGlamour: Well congrats on an awesome song and music video, you two! I know our readers will love it.\n\nAre you a new fan of Charlene? And if you've ever worked with your sister, what was your experience like?\n\nMore music news...\n\nOh, Yes!
