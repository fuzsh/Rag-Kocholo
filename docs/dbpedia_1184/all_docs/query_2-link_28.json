        "text": "If you love soulful R&B then there’s no way Anthony Hamilton’s ‘Charlene’ isn’t on your playlist.\n\nThe Anthony Hamilton classic will have you feeling ALL the emotions and is definitely one of the singer’s biggest hits.\n\nThe song and music video originally dropped in 2004, a somber hit that represented all of our heartbreaks. At its height, ‘Charlene’ reached no. 3 on the R&B chart.\n\nNow, 17 years later, it appears Charlene has finally returned. Anthony Hamilton had been making posts about finding Charlene for the past few days.\n\n“Have you seen her…Ham Fam I need y’all help #FindCharlene,” he wrote in one of the captions.\n\nHe used the hashtag #FindCharlene to tease a new single that apparently will feature the same actress who played Charlene in the original song.\n\n“SHE had a brotha all messed up,” another caption read.\n\nAnthony’s new song is titled, “You Made A Fool Of Me” and it looks like he’s finally going to tell Ms. Charlene how he feels face-to-face.\n\n“LOOK WHO FINALLY CAME HOME,” he wrote under a video where Charlene reveals herself.\n\nDid Anthony finally get his lady back? Will it be too late and too much time passed? We definitely need answers but I’m sure we’ll get them when the video drops.\n\nI’m here for Anthony bringing the nostalgia during this time! If the song is giving Charlene vibes, then it will surely be a bop!"
