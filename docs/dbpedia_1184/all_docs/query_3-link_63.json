I have coached many students to successful auditions. I have worked in the past with K-12 students in the school venue introducing music and teaching music appreciation as well as introducing singing. I work with older students and adults in my studio through The Music Academy of North Carolina. It is my great pleasure to teach a vocal technique that takes the “guesswork” out of singing. I am patient and thorough as a teacher and I believe that it is always possible to improve on one’s ability.\n\nVoice Type: Soprano\n\nMusic Styles Taught: Pop; Opera; Jazz; Folk; Classical; Musical Theatre\n\nAvailability: I am currently accepting private students\n\nContact Information"
