Take a look back at some of the best tracks from this year’s nominee.

By Tabie Germain

2021 Soul Train Awards nominee Anthony Hamilton demonstrated what he had to contribute to the R&B and soul genre following the release of his highly successful second studio effort, Comin’ from Where I’m From. The 2003 project had classic tracks including a single featuring the same title and its follow-up record “Charlene.”

Since then, the North Carolina native’s soulful collection of music have earned him mass recognition in the industry, including over a dozen Grammy nominations. This year, Hamilton is going up against some heavy hitters including The Isley Brother for the title of “Certified Soul Artist.” Ahead of the big event, let’s take a stroll down memory lane as we look back at the songs that prove why this soul crooner deserves his nomination.

“Charlene”

This track is perhaps one of the first singles that comes to mind when you think of Hamilton’s work and is the singer’s most successful song to date.

“Coming From Where I’m From”

Hamilton’s R&B / soul single from his second studio album Coming From Where I’m From, earned the singer two Grammy nominations in 2004 for “Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance” and “Best R&B Song.”

“Best Of Me”

This breezy r&b ballad demonstrated Hamilton’s different approach to the genre, as did the album the single was featured on, Back to Love.

“Can’t Let Go”

This soulful ballad was written by Hamilton and produced by longtime collaborator Mark Batson for the singer’s third album, Ain’t Nobody Worryin' released in 2005. It peaked at No. 13 on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart .

“Cool” ft. David Banner

In this uptempo track, Hamilton sings about finally getting to spend some much anticipated alone time with his lady. The music video will definitely put a smile on your face as well.
