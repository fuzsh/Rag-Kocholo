        "text": "Jon Rahm and his wife Kelley Cahill are about to become a family of five!\n\nThe Spanish professional golfer and Cahill are parents to two sons: Kepa, 3, and Eneko, 2. In March 2024, they announced they are expecting their third child.\n\nTwo months after welcoming Kepa in April 2021, Rahm told GOLF that his mindset changed after becoming a dad. He reflected on how he regretted some of his negative reactions after losing, especially now that he has a son who looks up to him.\n\n“Now I have a son, somebody who is dependent on me who is going to learn a lot of things from me like I did from my dad,” he said. “This cannot happen, I cannot do some of the things I’ve done in the past that I truly regret.”\n\nHe added that he made a deal with himself to “try to be better,” not just for himself, but for his son.\n\nFrom joining him at tournaments to how they’ve changed his outlook on life, here’s everything to know about Jon Rahm’s kids.\n\nKepa Cahill Rahm, 3\n\nRahm and Cahill’s first son, Kepa, was born on April 3, 2021. The happy couple announced his birth on Instagram with a carousel of photos of the two of them embracing their newborn in the delivery room.\n\n“Momma Kelley is doing great and recovering,” Rahm wrote in the caption. “Kepa is also in great health. He is 7.2 lb and 20.5inch, big boy from the Basque Country. Without a doubt the greatest day of my life!”\n\nRahm later explained the meaning behind Kepa’s unique name in an interview with the Golf Channel, sharing that the name comes from the Basque region.\n\n“It's from where I'm from in the Basque country,” he said, per Golf Digest. “When we were going through Basque names because [my wife] agreed to honor my heritage that way, we just had to find one that she could pronounce and that's the one we came up with that she really liked.\"\n\nJust two months after Kepa was born, Rahm won his first major tournament at the U.S. Open on Father’s Day and his infant son was there to celebrate the day with him.\n\n“To win my first major on my first Father’s Day, at a place that means so much to me like Torrey, is simply unbelievable,” he wrote on Instagram of the special moment. “If this is a dream, I still haven’t woken up yet – so happy I can enjoy this with my entire family!”\n\nDays after his 1st birthday, Kepa joined his dad at the Masters Par 3 tournament in April 2022 and adorably tried to steal the mic from him during his interview with ESPN. As Rahm was reflecting on his excitement going into the tournament, Kepa reached for the microphone and giggled when the reporter asked him to say hello to the camera.\n\nEneko Cahill Rahm, 2\n\nRahm and Cahill welcomed their second son, Eneko, on Aug. 5, 2022. The couple announced they were expecting six months earlier on Cahill’s birthday in a sweet post on Instagram. In the photo, the pair held up their ultrasound while Kepa ran toward the camera in a shirt that read “Big Bro.”\n\n“Happy birthday to my beautiful wife,” Rahm wrote in the caption. “Grateful for an amazing year, looking forward to adding baby boy this summer!”\n\nFive days after Eneko was born, Rahm announced his birth to the world with a post of him cuddling the newborn alongside Kepa, sharing that his second child was a “healthy boy.”\n\n“Kelley, Eneko and big brother Kepa are all doing great,” he captioned the photos. “We have had an amazing last few days soaking in these amazing moments as a family of four. Now time for the playoffs!”\n\nExpanding his family gave Rahm more to look forward to after coming home from a golf tournament or match, he shared in a press conference in February 2023. He said that no matter what happens on the field, knowing he has two young sons looking forward to his arrival makes it all better.\n\n“The fact that I get home, Kepa sees me — Eneko can’t really move still yet — but Kepa sees me and all he cares about is dad and playing,” he said. “From 5 p.m. until he goes down so two hours, I completely forget about what’s going on and what I’m doing, it doesn’t matter.”\n\nHe added, “It’s so much joy that comes from being with him and him just having fun that makes everyday life so much easier. Ever since they came along, going home after a golf tournament and a golf round is so much easier just because of things like that.”\n\nJon Rahm and Kelley Cahill’s Baby on the Way\n\nIn March 2024, Rahm and Cahill announced they are expecting their third child together, but have yet to share the sex. The couple shared the happy news on Instagram with a photo of the two of them holding their two sons and Kepa holding up a photo of the new baby’s ultrasound."
