I worked throughout the summer, I did some work with Athletes' Performance in LA when I was on holiday,\" Cahill said.\n\n\"I played internationally the last time against Japan. I had a good rest, but also, we worked very hard.\n\n\"I think I just need game time. Even in all the madness of being here, doing visas and medicals and those sorts of things, we've been under strict instructions from the manager, with the conditioning coaches, trying twice a day or once, or even in Montreal (on the weekend) when I was stuck there to try and find a training pitch and train in the gym.\n\n\"For me it's natural, I think as a professional playing at the highest level you have to keep yourself in good fitness and after that comes the game time, and that's something I'm going to get in good time. So I'm feeling good.\"\n\nThe game is about opinions. Make yours heard!
