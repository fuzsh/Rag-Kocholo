Its goal is to better inform people in communities across the island of Ireland about what palliative care is, when it may be needed and the benefits it can bring to the quality of life to those living with a life-limiting illness, their families, carers and those close to them.\n\nThis year’s theme is ‘You, Me and Palliative Care’.\n\nIt reflects the commitment of AIIHPC and its member organisations to emphasise the message that palliative care affects us all, and the importance of community in the provision of palliative care services and supports.\n\nWith this theme in mind, a first of its kind all-island event will take place in Newry on 9 September. The Compassionate Communities in Palliative and End of Life Care Conference is a free event open to the public which aims to promote a compassionate response from communities to support people with palliative care needs including at the end of life and bereavement supports for families and friends. The conference will raise awareness about the challenges people face when dealing with dying, death, and loss in our communities, highlight successful community responses and initiatives, and discuss constructive solutions to build more equitable compassionate communities.\n\n“Trad Wife” trend criticised by Mental Health Charity Turn2Me\n\nTurn2Me, a leading national mental health charity, is raising concerns about the growing \"Trad Wife\" trend on social media, which idealises a return to traditional gender roles where women are expected to focus solely on homemaking and submissiveness to their husbands. The charity said this movement sends a regressive and damaging message to both men and women, undermining decades of progress in gender equality, and is an unrealistic lifestyle for most.\n\nThe charity listed five reasons the “Trad Wife” trend is harmful which include reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes, undermining gender equality, promoting unhealthy relationships, increasing mental health risks, and putting all the financial pressure of providing on men.\n\nReinforces Harmful Gender Stereotypes:\n\nTurn2Me stated the \"Trad Wife\" trend perpetuates outdated and harmful gender stereotypes that confine women to domestic roles and men to being sole breadwinners. These stereotypes can limit individual potential and reinforce the notion that a person's worth is tied to their adherence to traditional gender norms, rather than their unique skills, talents, aspirations, and contributions to society. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem for those who do not fit into these narrow roles.\n\nUndermining Gender Equality:\n\nBy glorifying the idea that women should prioritise homemaking over careers or personal ambitions, the \"Trad Wife\" trend directly challenges the strides made towards gender equality. This messaging suggests that women's empowerment is less valuable than fulfilling traditional roles, which can hinder progress in achieving equal opportunities for all genders. It also discourages men from embracing more nurturing roles, such as being stay-at-home fathers or taking on household responsibilities.\n\nPromoting Unhealthy Relationships:\n\nThe extreme submissive dynamics promoted by the \"Trad Wife\" trend can foster unhealthy relationship patterns, where one partner holds power over the other. Turn2Me warns that these dynamics can lead to emotional and psychological harm, including feelings of being trapped, resentment, dependency, and even abuse. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect, equality, and shared responsibilities - values that this trend directly contradicts.\n\nIncreases Mental Health Risks:\n\nTurn2Me is concerned that the \"Trad Wife\" trend may contribute to increased mental health issues, particularly among women who feel pressured to conform to this ideal. The unrealistic expectations set by this movement can lead to anxiety, depression, and a sense of failure when people are unable to meet these standards. Men may also suffer from the pressure to conform to traditional roles as sole providers, leading to stress, burnout, and emotional distress.\n\nAll the Financial Pressure on Men:\n\nThe charity pointed out that many of the online influencers who are promoting the “Trad Wife” trend on social media come from generational wealth, make money from their online content via sponsorships, or are married to wealthy men. The reality for most households in Ireland today is that they can’t afford for one parent to be the sole source of income. The pressure for men to be the sole financial provider can lead to significant stress, anxiety, and mental health issues. This expectation can cause feelings of inadequacy if they struggle to meet all the financial demands of their household.\n\nAbout Turn2Me:\n\nTurn2me was founded in 2009 stemming from the very personal experiences of Oisin and Diarmuid Scollard, who lost their brother, Cormac, to suicide in 2003. In 2013, Turn2me gained the support of the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention to deliver counselling online. In 2019, Turn2me joined forces with ReachOut Ireland to create a space for young people to find information to support their mental health online. As of September 2021, Turn2me offers adult counselling and peer support services to adults living in Ireland. It helps around 10,000 adults living in Ireland every year with their anxiety, grief, and depression. Turn2Me has helped over 130,000 people living in Ireland since 2009.\n\nGAA News.\n\nThere was No Winner of this weeks lotto jackpot of €6,500. The numbers drawn on 12 August: 10-23-24-32.

Participants do not need to complete any training before ‘Let’s Talk About Suicide’ in fact, it is a helpful introduction to the topic for anyone considering attending more comprehensive training programmes in the future. These might include more advanced face-to-face programmes (such as safeTALK or ASIST) available from the HSE.\n\nTo access ‘Let’s Talk About Suicide,’ visit traininghub.nosp.ie.

The family who has been in receipt of support from Jack and Jill for their daughter Caoimhe, arranged the walk as part of the charity’s annual Up the Hill campaign whereby people can set their own challenge in order to fundraise for the charity.\n\n“Our twins Caoimhe and Isabella were born very premature at 25 weeks and 5 days” says mum Lindsey, “Isabella remained in hospital for four months, while Caoimhe came home after five months, she required a lot more support and was on oxygen and had feeding requirements that needed 24-hour monitoring.”\n\nGiven the challenges involved in Caoimhe’s care regime the family were referred to Jack and Jill, a nationwide charity which provides in-home nursing care and respite support for families with children with complex medical needs. The family chose to use their Jack and Jill hours at nighttime giving them back the gift of full night’s sleep. “Caoimhe’s feeding schedule was 24/7 and very demanding, knowing that our wonderful nurse was able to take over at nighttime and give us the opportunity to get some well needed reast was invaluable” Lindsey explained.\n\n“When the girls were first home from hospital, they were both very vulnerable given their premature status as well as Caoimhe’s additional needs, so we really isolated ourselves for that first winter. Having our Jack and Jill nurse was not only helpful because of the practical elements of care but she was also a really reassuring sounding board for any concerns or worries we had.”\n\nCaoimhe has continue to go from strength to strength and is currently doing really well and is now coming to the end of her time needing support from Jack and Jill. “It’s really bittersweet to be finishing up our time with Jack and Jill, it has been an invaluable support to my family”, explains Lindsey, “As such we really wanted to give back to the charity which provides such a vital service all over Ireland. Taking on an Up the Hill challenge was a simple way for us to do just that.”\n\nAlie Sheridan, Head of Fundraising at Jack and Jill said: “It is lovely to hear a success story like Caoimhe and we are all delighted to hear she is doing so well. Jack and Jill currently supports 13 families in Tipperary and in fact since we were founded in 1997 we have provided in-home nursing care and respite support to 77 families across the county. We really appreciate the lengths families under our care, past and present, go to, to support Jack and Jill right back. By taking on this challenge and organising a great day out for their community Lindsey and Colm are not only celebrating their beautiful daughter they are also help raise vital funds and awareness of the service we provide to over 400 families in Ireland. Now in its 10th year Up the Hill is a great way for friends, families, communities and colleagues to come together and celebrate someone who inspires them. Just pick a challenge that suits you and your fitness levels – from mountain tops to forest walks; anything goes! It’s a wonderful opportunity to take some time out to reflect on those who inspire you, while helping to raise funds to keep our vital service going, which has been a lifeline for over 3,000 families since 1997”\n\nThe walk which will start at 3pm on August 11th promises to be a great day out for all the family. There will be treats on hand for young and old and anyone wishing to join in and take part can register via #UpTheHill2024 Registration - The Jack and Jill Children's Foundation a registration fee of €18 will help provide one hour of in-home nursing care for a local Jack and Jill family.
