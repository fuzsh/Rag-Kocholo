JULIA DORGAN, b. 1865, Middletown, CT; m. (1) THOMAS CARROLL; m. (2) JOHN CARROLL.\n\nGeneration No. 3\n\n5. H\n\nONORAH3 DORGAN (JOHN2, CORNELIUS1) was born 12 Apr 1843 in Cork, Ireland, and died 06 Apr 1894 in Arlington, Middlesex, MA25. She married JOHN GALLAGHER 25 Nov 1860 in Cambridge, Middlesex, MA26. He was born 1829 in Funshina, Tisrara, Roscommon, Ireland, and died 11 Jul 1918 in Arlington, Middlesex, MA27.\n\nNotes for H\n\nONORAH DORGAN:\n\nThe Arlington Advocate of November 23, 1912 reports the death of JamesA. Gallagher, son of John Gallagher and Honora Dorgan. Pallbearers athis funeral included William Cahill. The Advocate also reported themarriage of Martin J. Gallager, son of John and Honora (Dorgan)Gallagher, to Catherine Mulcahy. The article indicates that WilliamJ. Cahill of Meriden, CT was the best man. C. W. Cahill, also ofMeriden, CT, was an usher at the wedding.\n\nThe participation of Cahill family members at important Gallagherfamily events led to the belief that there may be a familialrelationship. To confirm this, I consulted certain sources. The 1900US census for Meriden, CT confirmed the existence of the Cahillfamily. Cornelius W. Cahill, a dealer in meats, born in Ireland in1844 is enumerated as head of the family. The census includes hissons, William and Cornelius.\n\nI consulted NEHGS town directories and found a text entitled,\"Meriden, Connecticut,\" published by Curtis and Gillespie in 1906.This text provided a brief biography of Cornelius W. Cahill ofMeriden. The article indicated that Cornelius W. Cahill, a prominentbusinessman, was born in Ireland on February 12, 1844. His parentslocated to Middletown, CT when he was about 3 years old. In 1865,Cornelius removed to Meriden where he became a clerk in a provisionsstore. He soon established his own store and became a leader in thewholesale commission business handling the Swift beef supply. thearticle went on to indicate that Cornelius married in May, 1869 andhas five sons, William J., Joseph, George, C. W., and Walter; and twodaughters, Mrs. Joseph B. Weed of New York and Margaret Cahill.\n\nThe next step in tying in the Gallagher/Cahill connection was toconsult vital records of Meriden, CT. I sent a message via Prodigy toother members and on November 16, 1992, Dan DeLuca of Meridencontacted me. The next day, Dan, after consulting Meriden townrecords, sent me a message indicating that Cornelius Cahill, bornabout 1844, died April 5, 1927 in Meriden. His father: William; hismother: Margaret Dorgan. Cornelius Cahill married May 27, 1869 inMeriden, Bridget Ann Ahern, born about 1845 in Newark, NY; died March14, 1924 in Meriden. Her father's name: Michael; mother: Bridget F.O'Neil.\n\nDan also informed me that one of the pallbearers at the funerals ofCornelius and Bridget Cahill was Martin Gallagher.\n\nI copied text and photographs from the \"Meriden, Connecticut\" book.Photographs include a portrait of Cornelius Cahill (page 349) and apicture of the Cahill Block (page 350), a building erected byCornelius Cahill.\n\nAs a result of this research, it is evident that theGallagher/Cahill connection lies with Margaret Dorgan. Dorgan is themaiden name of John Gallagher's wife, Honora. Honora Dorgan was bornabout 1843 in Cork, Ireland, the daugher of John and Ellen (McCarthy)Dorgan. I estimate the date of John Dorgan's birth to be 1820.Margaret Dorgan's birth date is estimated to be about the same year.It seems that John Dorgan and Margaret Dorgan may be brother andsister and that Honora (Dorgan) Gallagher and Cornelius Cahill may befirst cousins.\n\nThe 1860 US census of Middletown, CT at the Waltham FederalArchives (M653, Roll 83, page 277, July 3, 1860) shows the followingfamilies on lines 24-38:\n\nHouse 655, family 756 - Cornelius Dorgan, age 40, male, gardener, bornIreland, value of real estate: $400; Mary, age 38, born Ireland; John,age 17, mechanic, born Ireland; Honora, age 8, born CT; Michael, age6, born CT; Patsey, male, age 2, born CT; Jerry, male, age 1, born CT.\n\nHouse 656, family 757 - William Cahill, age 48, day laborer, bornIreland, value of real estate: $250; Margaret, age 47, born Ireland;Bart, age 20, mechanic, born Ireland; Betsey, age 11, born Ireland;Patrick, age 9, born Ireland; John, age 6, born CT; Margaret, age 3,born CT.\n\nThe Margaret Cahill identified in the census in family 757, wife ofWilliam Cahill, is Margaret (Dorgan). I seems very likely thatCornelius Dorgan, family 756, is her brother.\n\nIn August, 1998, I researched the Hale Collection at the NEHGS.The Hale Collection is a compilation of Connecticut cemeteryinscriptions. Film #272, New St. John Cemetery, Middletown, CT(711-9), section 4 (page 428) shows an inscription on a stone for thefollowing:\n\nWilliam Cahill, died June 10, 1884, aged 72 years.\n\nMargaret Cahill, wife of William, died January 27, 1890, aged 76years\n\nPatrick Cahill, born 1852, died 1893\n\nJohn J. Cahill, born 1855, died 1906\n\nHonora Cahill, born 1847, died 1911\n\nMary Cahill, born 1842, died 1919\n\nElizabeth Cahill, born 1850, died 1933\n\nI sent a letter on August 29 to the Middletown Clerk's office toget the death record for William and Margaret Cahill with the hopethat place of birth and parent's names are listed on the certificate.\n\nOn the same film (page 500), I found an inscription on a stonelocated at Old St. John Cemetery (711-10):\n\nMichael Dorgan, son of Michael and Mary, b. 1843, d. 1907\n\nMichael Dorgan, b. 1801, d. 1861\n\nMary, wife of Michael Dorgan, b. 1806, d. 1884\n\nNatives of Dunbullug, County Cork, Ireland\n\nI cannot confirm a direct family connection with this Dorgan familyyet. However, it's likely that they are related. I check thelocation of Dunbullug in the Alphabetical List of Towns and Townlandsof Ireland and found Dunbulloge, a townland in the parish ofDunbulloge, East Cork, Barrymore Barony, Cork Poor Law Union.Griffith's Valuation for 1852 shows the following occupiers inGlashaboy South townland, Dunbulloge Parish:\n\nMary Cahill\n\nJohn Cahill\n\nWilliam Cahill\n\nJohn Dargan (sic)\n\nArthur Kieffe\n\nWilliam Dargan (sic)\n\nRobert McCarthy\n\nSheehan\n\nThere is a good possibility that Dunbulloge is the origin of theDorgan (Dargan) and Cahill families directly related to theGallaghers. The next step will be to locate the Catholic Churchrecords to find any baptism, marriage or death that will confirm thisconnection.\n\nThe Hale Collection film #272 showed another interestingpossibility on page 415. Buried in section 4 of New St. John Cemeterynear the William Cahill family plot is John Dorgan, a Civil Warveteran. He was a member of Co. H, 1st Regiment, ConnecticutArtillery during the war. He died on May 18, 1880. A form requestinghis war records was sent to Washington, D.C. in early August, 1998.If the record is found, it may confirm a Gallagher/Dorgan relationshipand give the Dorgan origin in Ireland.\n\nDeath record reads: Nora Gallagher, age 50 years, 11 months, 24 days,died on April 6, 1894. She was born in Ireland, the daughter of JohnDorgan and Nellie McCarthy.\n\nCause of death: cancer of liver.\n\nBuried at St. Paul's Cemetery, Arlington, MA.\n\nI, Honora Gallagher, of Arlington, in the County of Middlesex andCommonwealth of Massachusetts, wife of John Gallagher, make this mylast will in maner following hereby revoking all former wills by me atany time made.\n\nFirst.

The first record hinting at origin was thebaptismal certificate of his daughter, Ellen, in 1872 at St. Peter'sChurch, Cambridge, MA. The certificate reflects that John Gallagherwas from County Roscommon, Ireland. The County Roscommon origin isfurther corroborated through John Gallagher's naturalizationcertificate, U.S. District Court, Boston, dated March 5, 1877 in whichhe attests that he was born in County Roscommon, Ireland.\n\nJohn Gallagher's death record in 1918 indicates that his father's namewas John and that his mother's name was Bridget Looly. His marriagerecord in 1860 shows his father to be John and his mother to beMiroley. It is believed that the unusual name Miroley was amisinterpretation in the record transcription. John Gallagher and hiswife, Honora Dorgan, named their first daughter Mary Bridget. Thenaming of the eldest daughter after the father's mother is an age oldIrish tradition. It is believed that John Gallagher's mother's namewas Mary Bridget Looly and that in Irish, it may have been pronouncedas Maire Looly or Miroley.\n\nSince his mother and father probably came from the same area inRoscommon, Ireland and because the Looly name seemed so unusual, itwas felt that an analysis of Irish government records would be thenext logical step in narrowing the family origins in Roscommon.Indexes for Griffith's Primary Valuation of 1855 and the TitheComposition Applotment Books of 1836 were consulted. This inspectionled to the Barony of Athlone, Diocese of Elphin, Parish of Tisrara,Townland of Funshinagh. Griffith's Valuation of 1855 identified aJohn Looby in the Townland of Funshinagh (Madden), Parish of Tisrara.The Tithe Composition Applotment Books of 1836 identified the Townlandof Funshinagh Looly in which John Looly, Senior, John Looly, Juniorand Bryan and Owen Galaugher were occupiers. The most interestingfeature of this record is that when the recorder wrote the name (whichis in long hand) of John Looly, Junior, a small letter \"L\" was placedjust above the second \"L\" in Looly, as if to clarify the name as beingLooly and not \"Looby\".\n\nIn light of this information, it is believed that the Townland ofFunshinagh, Parish of Tisrara, County Roscommon, Ireland, is thebirthplace of John Gallagher.\n\nAn attempt has been made to verify John Gallagher's birth in Tisraraby soliciting the help of the County Roscommon Heritage and GenealogySociety in Ireland. A letter was sent to this agency with all of theabove information. On 22 November 1991, the agency responded to myinquiry. They were unable to confirm the Gallagher-Looly origins inTisrara because Roman Catholic records do not commence until 1850 forthe particular parish in question. All other records in catholicparishes throughout Roscommon for the period relevant to the baptismof John Gallagher or the marriage of John Gallagher and Bridget Loolywere consulted. Nothing was discovered.\n\nAccording to the death record, John Gallagher, 55 Palmer Street,Arlington, died July 11, 1918, age 88. W/M/W, husband of NorahDorgan. Occupation: retired farmer.\n\nBorn in Ireland. Father: John Gallagher; Mother: Bridget Looley, bothborn in Ireland.\n\nCause of death: mitral regurgitation.\n\nBuried at St. Paul's Cemetery, Arlington.\n\nInformant: Nellie Cummins, daughter.\n\nJohn Gallagher is buried at St. Paul's Cemetery, Arlington in a lotpurchased by him in 1892, probably at the time of death of his eldestson, John. Four lots were purchased, lots 143 and 145 on GelasiusPath and 144 and 146 on John Path. A large grey stone is on the lotwith the inscriptions: John Gallagher 1829-1918; his wife HonoraGallagher 1843-1894/John F. Gallagher 1863-1892; Eva E. Gallagher1883-1910/James A.

Collins.\n\n\"An Old Resident Deceased\"\n\nJohn Gallagher, one of Arlington's long-time residents, passed awayJuly llth at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Edward A. Cummins, 55Palmer Avenue in his eighty-ninth year. Mr. Gallagher has resided inArlington some sixty-five years. He was born in Ireland and came tothis country when he was twenty-three years of age. Most of his lifehas been devoted to farming and a greater part of it has been passedin the Arlington Heights section of the town. His wife has beendeceased twenty-five years.\n\nHe was a man of sterling character, devoted to thrift and industryand these traits of character have evidently been handed down to hischildren, all of who are respected and prosperous residents of thetown. His home, since the death of his wife, has been made with hisdaughter, Mrs. Cummins, where he has received loving care. BesidesMrs. Cummins he leaves two sons, Martin J. Gallagher and Cornelius D.Gallagher, both well-known business men in the market district ofBoston and residents of this town, and a daughter, Miss AbbieGallagher.\n\nThe funeral took place Saturday morning at the residence of Mrs.Cummins. A solemn high mass of requiem was celebrated in St. Agnes.The music for the mass was sung by the members of the choir under thedirection of Miss Lucy J. Butler, organist. The bearers were: JamesM.

First marriage for both.\n\n*It is felt that John Gallagher's mother's name is a misinterpretationby the recorder of the document. John Gallagher's first child, afemale, was named Mary Bridget. Following the age old Irish traditionof naming the first male child after the father's father and the firstfemale child after the father's mother, it is believed that JohnGallagher's mother's name was Mary Bridget.\n\nAn analysis of the index to the Tithe Applotment Books of Ireland of1836 led to the townland of Funshinagh, Parish of Tisrara, CountyRoscommon. In this townland the family names of Looly and Galaugherwere found. Edward Looly and Bryan and Owen Galaugher shared 36 acresof land with eight other individuals. One peculiarity found in thisrecord was a notation made over the Looly name on the record. Thedocument was recorded in long hand. The recorder purposely wrote asmall case \"L\" above the second \"L\" of the Looly name, obviously toclarify the pronunciation of the name and to eliminate anyinterpretation of the name as \"Looby.\"\n\nAll other government records for County Roscommon, includingGriffith's Valuation of 1855, were researched for evidence of anyother Gallagher/Looly connection. No other connection was found, infact, no other family named Looly was found in any of the records.Further research by the Roscommon Heritage and Genealogical Societyhas failed to discover any other records that might confirm the originof John Gallagher or a connection to the Looly family in Roscommon.\n\nIt has been confirmed through his naturalization record and abaptismal record of his daughter Ellen in 1872 that John Gallagher wasfrom County Roscommon, Ireland. People from this part of Ireland wereGaelic-speaking. It is now believed that when the priest at hismarriage asked John Gallagher his mother's name he pronounced it init's Gaelic form as \"Maire (anglicised Mary) Looly\" and that thepriest, not fully comprehending, recorded the name as \"Miroley.\"\n\nFurther evidence of the Looly name is recorded in John Gallagher'sdeath record, 1918. The record informant, Ellen Cummins, JohnGallagher's daughter, reported his mother's name to be Bridget Looly.\n\nChildren of H\n\nONORAH DORGAN and JOHN GALLAGHER are:\n\ni.

He married BRIDGET ANN AHERN 27 May 1869 in Meriden, CT. She was born 1845 in Newark, NY, and died 14 Mar 1924 in Meriden, CT.\n\nNotes for C\n\nORNELIUS CAHILL:\n\nThe Arlington Advocate of November 23, 1912 reports the death ofJames A. Gallagher, son of John Gallagher and Honora Dorgan.Pallbearers at his funeral included William Cahill. The Advocate alsoreported the marriage of Martin J. Gallager, son of John and Honora(Dorgan) Gallagher, to Catherine Mulcahy. The article indicates thatWilliam J. Cahill of Meriden, CT was the best man. C. W. Cahill, alsoof Meriden, CT, was an usher at the wedding.\n\nThe participation of Cahill family members at important Gallagherfamily events led to the belief that there may be a familialrelationship. To confirm this, I consulted certain sources. The 1900US census for Meriden, CT confirmed the existence of the Cahillfamily. Cornelius W. Cahill, a dealer in meats, born in Ireland in1844 is enumerated as head of the family. The census includes hissons, William and Cornelius.\n\nI consulted NEHGS town directories and found a text entitled,\"Meriden, Connecticut,\" published by Curtis and Gillespie in 1906.This text provided a brief biography of Cornelius W. Cahill ofMeriden. The article indicated that Cornelius W. Cahill, a prominentbusinessman, was born in Ireland on February 12, 1844. His parentslocated to Middletown, CT when he was about 3 years old. In 1865,Cornelius removed to Meriden where he became a clerk in a provisionsstore. He soon established his own store and became a leader in thewholesale commission business handling the Swift beef supply. Thearticle went on to indicate that Cornelius married in May, 1869 andhas five sons, William J., Joseph, George, C. W., and Walter; and twodaughters, Mrs. Joseph B. Weed of New York and Margaret Cahill.\n\nThe next step in tying in the Gallagher/Cahill connection was toconsult vital records of Meriden, CT. I sent a message via Prodigy toother members and on November 16, 1992, Dan DeLuca of Meridencontacted me. The next day, Dan, after consulting Meriden townrecords, sent me a message indicating that Cornelius Cahill, bornabout 1844, died April 5, 1927 in Meriden. His father: William; hismother: Margaret Dorgan. Cornelius Cahill married May 27, 1869 inMeriden, Bridget Ann Ahern, born about 1845 in Newark, NY; died March14, 1924 in Meriden. Her father's name: Michael; mother: Bridget F.O'Neil.\n\nDan also informed me that one of the pallbearers at the funerals ofCornelius and Bridget Cahill was Martin Gallagher.\n\nI copied text and photographs from the \"Meriden, Connecticut\" book.Photographs include a portrait of Cornelius Cahill (page 349) and apicture of the Cahill Block (page 350), a building erected byCornelius Cahill.\n\nAs a result of this research, it is evident that theGallagher/Cahill connection lies with Margaret Dorgan. Dorgan is themaiden name of John Gallagher's wife, Honora. Honora Dorgan was bornabout 1843 in Cork, Ireland, the daugher of John and Ellen (McCarthy)Dorgan. I estimate the date of John Dorgan's birth to be 1820.Margaret Dorgan's birth date is estimated to be about the same year.It seems that John Dorgan and Margaret Dorgan may be brother andsister and that Honora (Dorgan) Gallagher and Cornelius Cahill may befirst cousins.\n\nThe 1860 US census of Middletown, CT at the Waltham FederalArchives (M653, Roll 83, page 277, July 3, 1860) shows the followingfamilies on lines 24-38:\n\nHouse 655, family 756 - Cornelius Dorgan, age 40, male, gardener, bornIreland, value of real estate: $400; Mary, age 38, born Ireland; John,age 17, mechanic, born Ireland; Honora, age 8, born CT; Michael, age6, born CT; Patsey, male, age 2, born CT; Jerry, male, age 1, born CT.\n\nHouse 656, family 757 - William Cahill, age 48, day laborer, bornIreland, value of real estate: $250; Margaret, age 47, born Ireland;Bart, age 20, mechanic, born Ireland; Betsey, age 11, born Ireland;Patrick, age 9, born Ireland; John, age 6, born CT; Margaret, age 3,born CT.\n\nThe Margaret Cahill identified in the census in family 757, wife ofWilliam Cahill, is Margaret (Dorgan). I seems very likely thatCornelius Dorgan, family 756, is her brother.\n\nIn August, 1998, I researched the Hale Collection at the NEHGS.The Hale Collection is a compilation of Connecticut cemeteryinscriptions. Film #272, New St. John Cemetery, Middletown, CT(711-9), section 4 (page 428) shows an inscription on a stone for thefollowing:\n\nWilliam Cahill, died June 10, 1884, aged 72 years.\n\nMargaret Cahill, wife of William, died January 27, 1890, aged 76years\n\nPatrick Cahill, born 1852, died 1893\n\nJohn J. Cahill, born 1855, died 1906\n\nHonora Cahill, born 1847, died 1911\n\nMary Cahill, born 1842, died 1919\n\nElizabeth Cahill, born 1850, died 1933\n\nI sent a letter on August 29 to the Middletown Clerk's office to get the death record for William and Margaret Cahill with the hope that place of birth and parent's names are listed on the certificate.\n\nOn the same film (page 500), I found an inscription on a stone located at Old St. John Cemetery (711-10):\n\nMichael Dorgan, son of Michael and Mary, b. 1843, d. 1907\n\nMichael Dorgan, b. 1801, d. 1861\n\nMary, wife of Michael Dorgan, b. 1806, d. 1884\n\nNatives of Dunbullug, County Cork, Ireland\n\nI cannot confirm a direct family connection with this Dorgan family yet. However, it's likely that they are related. I checked the location of Dunbullug in the Alphabetical List of Towns and Townlands of Ireland and found Dunbulloge, a townland in the parish o Dunbulloge, East Cork, Barrymore Barony, Cork Poor Law Union. Griffith's Valuation for 1852 shows the following occupiers in Glashaboy South townland, Dunbulloge Parish:\n\nMary Cahill\n\nJohn Cahill\n\nWilliam Cahill\n\nJohn Dargan\n\nArthur Kieffe\n\nWilliam Dargan\n\nRobert McCarthy\n\nSheehan\n\nThere is a good possibility that Dunbulloge is the origin of the Dorgan (Dargan) and Cahill families directly related to the Gallaghers. The next step will be to locate the Catholic Church records to find any baptism, marriage or death that will confirm this connection.\n\nThe Hale Collection film #272 showed another interesting possibility on page 415. Buried in section 4 of New St. John Cemetery near the William Cahill family plot is John Dorgan, a Civil War veteran. He was a member of Co. H, 1st Regiment, Connecticut Artillery during the war. He died on May 18, 1880. A form requesting his war records was sent to Washington, D.C. in early August, 1998.If the record is found, it may confirm a Gallagher/Dorgan relationship and give the Dorgan origin in Ireland.\n\nOn September 8, 1998, the Asst. Registrar of Vital Records for Middletown, CT sent the two death records I requested. The records revealed the following:\n\nWilliam Cahill, age 72, died June 10, 1884 in Middletown. He was born in Ireland. His father's name was Bartholomew Cahill and his mother's name is noted as Mary Cahill. He died from old age and nephritis.\n\nMargaret Cahill, his wife, died on January 26, 1890 in Middletown at age 76. She was born in Ireland, the daughter of Cornelius Dorgan and Hanora Murphy. Cause of death is listed as Morbus Brighti and heart failure.\n\nThe record of death for Margaret (Dorgan) Cahill provides me with the parents of John Dorgan, Honora (Dorgan) Gallagher's father, since Margaret and John are certainly brother and sister.\n\nOn September 18, 1998, Jeanne and I went to pick up Elizabeth at Quinnipiac. She wouldn't be ready until she finished a class at 3:00PM, so we left early and stopped at the CT State Library in Hartford on the way down. I found many genealogical resources available there. Time permitted only a one hour stay, but I hope to return.\n\nDuring the one hour, I did find some interesting death records. One of the most interesting was the death record of the wife of Cornelius Dorgan. (Cornelius, it is believed, is the brother of Margaret (Dorgan) Cahill and John Dorgan). Cornelius' wife, Mary, died on February 18, 1880 in Middletown, CT at age 52. Her maiden name was Cahill. The record reveals that her father's name was John and that her mother's name was unknown. Cause of death was asthma.\n\nAnother interesting death record revealed that Jeremiah F. Dorgan, age 31, son of Cornelius and Mary Dorgan, died on June 9, 1891 of alcoholism and central congestion. His occupation was listed as baseball player. (Jeremiah is listed as Jerry, age 1, son of Cornelius and Mary Dorgan in the 1860 census of Middletown, CT.\n\nBartholomew Cahill, son of William and Margaret (Dorgan) Cahill, died on June 28, 1892 at age 51. He was born in Ireland, was married and lived in the Staddle Hill district. Cause of death was heartdisease and dropsy.\n\nA second Cahill son, Patrick, died at age 41 on July 18, 1893. He was born in Ireland and was married. His occupation was listed as butcher and he lived at 57 West Street, Middletown.\n\nHeadline on page 1, column 2 of the Meriden Record reads: \"C. W. Cahill Dies In His 83rd Year; Funeral Thursday. Former Manager Of Wholesale And Retail Meat Businesses Here. WAS LARGE DEALER IN REAL ESTATE. Had Been Ill With Severe Cold For Last Three Weeks Of His Life.\" Text reads as follows:\n\n\"The funeral of Cornelius W. Cahill will be held Thursday morning at 9:30 o'clock from his late home, 96 Liberty Street, with a solemn high mass of requiem at St. Rose's Roman Catholic Church at 10o'clock. Interment will be in the family plot in St. Patrick's cemetery. Friends are requested not to send flowers.\n\nMr. Cahill, one of Meriden's best-known citizens, died at his home yesterday morning after a three weeks illness which began with a severe cold. His lowered vitality, due to advancing age, made it impossible for him to throw off the malady, and he gradually grew weaker, and on Sunday he lapsed into a state of coma, from which he did not rally.\n\nMr. Cahill was born in Ireland eighty-three years ago. When a child of three he came with his parents to this country and settled at Staddle Hill, Middletown, where he attended school until he was fourteen years of age, when he began driving a butcher cart in Middlefield.\n\nCame to Meriden - In 1865 he came to Meriden and began service as a clerk in the provision store of Samuel C. Paddock at the corner of East Main and State streets. A few years later he went into business for himself, establishing the City market. He met with instant success in the meat business and after a few years established a pork packing business, but after a year returned to the retail trade.\n\nAfterwards he became a partner (Continued on Second Page) of John W. Coe and W. W. Bartholomew as local agents of Swift & Co. Shortly afterward he bought out the interests of Mssrs. Coe and Bartholomew, and for many years Mr. Cahill continued as Meriden's representative of Swift & Co. with headquarters on Cross street. He was succeeded by his son, George A. Cahill, who still is the local agent of that concern.\n\nEntered Realty Business - After retiring from the wholesale meat business Mr. Cahill turned his attention to real estate. He erected the Cahill block on East Main Street in 1895, and later several large buildings on Pratt street. He came to be the largest individual taxpayer of the city, but a few years ago formed the C. W. Cahill Realty company, which took over his large holdings.\n\nMr. Cahill has served as a director of the Meriden hospital, the First National bank and the Meriden Board of Trade, and was a member of the board of governors of the old Amaranth club, and a trustee of the Meriden Savings bank.\n\nMr. Cahill is survived by five sons, William J., Cornelius W. Jr., Joseph H., and George A. Cahill of Meriden and Walter T. Cahill of Washington, D. C.; two daughters, Mrs. J. B. Weed of New York and Mrs. Frank P. Neligon of Meriden; two sisters, the Rev. Mother Gertrude of St. Agnes' home, Hartford, and Miss Elizabeth Cahill of this city, and eighteen grandchildren.\"\n\nMeriden Record - obituary of Cornelius W. Cahill reads as follows:\n\n\"The funeral of Cornelius W. Cahill was held yesterday morning at9:30 o'clock from his late home, 96 Liberty street, and at 10 o'clock at St. Rose's church. A solemn high mass of requiem was celebrated by the Rev. John R. Quinn, assisted by the Rev. J. Francis Egan as deacon, the Rev. Paul Regan of New York as sub deacon and the Rev.

Funeral from St. Agnes this morning.\n\nMartin J. Gallagher, member of the Board of Assessors for the past nine years and prominent financial figure in the town, passed away very suddenly last Tuesday afternoon. He was driving his automobile along Massachusetts Avenue behind a trolley car when it stopped near Highland Avenue to take on passengers. Mr. Gallagher brought his machine to rest, but when the trolley started up again, he did not move. It was seen by a passerby that Mr. Gallagher was slumped over the wheel, and he notified the police that there was a man on theavenue who seemed to be ill. Before the ambulance arrived, LeonardCollins, who runs a filling station nearby, had rushed him to the hospital, but there it was found that Mr. Gallagher had died. Thecause, according to the examing physician, was heart disease.\n\nBorn in Arlington - Martin Gallagher was born in Arlington,attending our schools. At the time of his decease he was living at140 Pleasant Street. It was thought by all those who had dealingswith him in his official capacity that he was one of the finest menwho ever held office here. In private life, he held the respect andlove of all with his quiet unassuming manner. He was fair minded andsquare in his dealings and had not a real enemy anywhere. Of coursehe held no place in the heart of the bigoted politician, but that isdecidedly to his credit. He allowed no prejudice of any kind toinfluence his dealings, but was broad both in his ideals and deals.\n\nSuccessful Manufacturer -When he had finished school Mr. Gallagherstarted business in the Boston Market, but his foresight soon led himinto the manufacture of market boxes. In fact, he was one of thepioneers in the bushel box line. He built up this business to such anextent that during the war he was able to sell out to tremendousadvantage. He busied himself with his various real estate ventureshere among them being the Menotomy Garage which is now owned by theestate.\n\nWhen James M. Mead, the assessor, died in January, 1920, no one wasappointed to fill the vacancy, the time between then and the electionbeing so short, but in March Mr. Gallagher was elected by a largemajority. this last March the ballot showed how high a place in theregard of the community he held. He was re-elected for another threeyear term by one of the widest margins in the history of the town. Hewas a member of the board of directors of the Menotomy Trust Company,a director of the Arlington Associates, belonged to the ArlingtonChamber of Commerce, the Middlesex Sportsman's Association, theArlington Lodge of Elks and Arlington Council, Knights of Columbus.\n\nSon Passed Bar - About two weeks before Mr. Gallagher died, hisson, Francis J., passed the Massachusetts Bar examinations, gratifyingone of his father's greatest ambitions. He was sworn in on themorning following his father's death.\n\nSurviving Mr. Gallagher are his beloved wife, Catherine, sister ofthe late Rev. John F. Mulcahy, pastor of St. Agnes church years ago; ason, Francis J. Gallagher, two daughters, Mary C. Gallagher and HelenF.
