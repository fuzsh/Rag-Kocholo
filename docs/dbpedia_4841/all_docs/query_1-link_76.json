        "text": "This article chronicles 239 violent deaths of women in Ireland since 1996 — a particularly gruesome year for “femicide”, with 19 killings of women.\n\nThat terrible toll prompted Women’s Aid to initiate the Stolen Lives project, and it has shared its research with The Irish Times for this article, written by Jennifer O’Connell, Brian Hutton and Adesewa Awobadejo.\n\nIn cases where criminal trials are pending we have not given names or details of deaths. This is to comply with legal rules prohibiting publication of material that could prejudice court proceedings.\n\nThis should not be considered a finished project and may be added to as more information becomes available.\n\nReaders may find some of the details upsetting.\n\n1996\n\nMarilyn Rynn\n\nDied, aged 41, on December 22nd, 1995\n\nIndependent, sporty and sociable Marilyn Rynn, a civil servant at the Department of the Environment with a wide circle of friends, went missing after she got a Nitelink bus home from her office Christmas party on December 22nd, 1995. It wasn’t until January 6th, 1996, that her naked body was discovered in Tolka Valley Park, in north Dublin. David Lawler, a local father of one with no previous history of violence, would say later that he raped and strangled her “on spontaneous impulse”. He was the first murderer in the history of the State to be convicted on the basis of DNA. He received a life sentence. You can read more here. Jennifer O’Connell\n\nJoyce Quinn\n\nDied, aged 44, on January 23rd, 1996\n\nMother of three Joyce Quinn – “a woman with a broad, warm smile for everyone” – offered her regular customer Kenneth O’Reilly a lift as she drove home from her sweet shop in Milltown, Co Kildare, on a January evening in 1996. He stabbed and raped her, dumping her body at the Curragh. He pleaded guilty to her murder but was never charged with sexual assault, because it could not be determined if she was alive or dead at the time of the rape. “Joyce was as perfect as you can get in the world,” her grieving husband, Cmdt Ray Quinn, says. O’Reilly’s latest application for parole is due to be heard in 2022. You can read more here and here. JO’C\n\n[ Stolen Lives: ‘I said, ‘Where’s your mum?

He was diagnosed with acute schizophrenia and found guilty but insane. Two men at the house in Thurles at the time were also injured. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nSandra Tobin\n\nDied, aged 36, on March 15th, 1996\n\nThe body of Sandra Tobin was found in her home in Waterford city after a neighbour noticed a broken window.

JO’C\n\nNoeleen Cawley\n\nDied, aged 39, on April 2nd, 1996\n\nFive children, aged between two and 17, were taken into care after their mother, Noeleen Cawley, was stabbed by their father, Michael Cawley.

You can read more here. JO’C\n\nAlison White\n\nDied, aged 13, on April 14th, 1996\n\nAlison White, a schoolgirl, was found dead with horrific head injuries in scrubland near her home, in Bundoran, Co Donegal. Her neighbour Patrick Granaghan invited her for a walk and attempted to rape her, but she bravely fought him off. He strangled her and bludgeoned her with a large stone. It was a premeditated attack – he had been inviting young people to his home for months. They regarded him as an “Irish Forrest Gump”. “He preyed on children’s innocence,” Alison’s father, Tommy, said as Granaghan was convicted of her murder. JO’C\n\nAnne-Marie Duffin\n\nDied, aged 39, on April 15th, 1996\n\nAnne-Marie Duffin, a well-liked Dutch national who worked at a health shop, restaurant and creches in the Tralee area, was stabbed 66 times in broad daylight, in her home in Blennerville, by a 15-year-old boy from the area. Her two teenage sons, Kevin and Timothy, then aged 15 and 13-years-old, discovered her body in the hall when they came home from school. The killer, a friend of the elder of her sons, told the Garda she “did not like him”. The boy was 17-years-old when he was convicted and given a life sentence. After the verdict the Duffin family said they would pray for him. Tragically, Anne-Marie’s son Kevin Duffin died by suicide in 2008. You can read more here, here and here. JO’C\n\nMartina Halligan\n\nDied, aged 33, on May 5th, 1996\n\nMartina Halligan collapsed outside a neighbour’s house in Darndale, in north Dublin, after her estranged husband, Michael Halligan, stabbed her seven times.

She had been married for only eight months when she confided in her sister that there were problems in the relationship. Just a few days later he strangled her. PJ Collins, whom the judge described as “a danger to life” and who had a string of other convictions, was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for nine years. JO’C\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nDied, aged 33, on May 28th, 1996\n\nPatricia Murphy’s body was found beside a skip in Glasnevin, near her home in north Dublin. She had been strangled. Her husband was convicted of her murder in December 1998, primarily on the basis of heartbreaking video-link testimony by three of their four small children, who had seen their mother’s body in the garage of the family home. One little boy, five at the time of giving evidence, testified to having seen “Daddy hammering Mammy”. Patricia’s mother, Brigid Behan, said she had beautiful memories of Patricia “which will live with me until the day I die”. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nVeronica Guerin\n\nDied, aged 37, on June 26th, 1996\n\nThe respected Sunday Independent crime journalist was fatally shot six times as she waited at the Newlands Cross traffic lights on Naas Road in west Dublin. She had previously been shot in the leg, assaulted, threatened, intimidated and had shots fired at the house she shared with her husband and young son, as a result of her reporting on the activities of criminal gangs. More than 200 arrests and 39 convictions arose from the investigation into her death, which was described by Bertie Ahern, who would become taoiseach the following year, as an attack on democracy. Paul Ward, a 32-year-old, was found guilty of her murder in November 1998, but this was overturned on appeal. John Gilligan was tried and acquitted. To this day the only person behind bars for her murder is Brian Meehan. JO’C\n\nMaura McKinney\n\nDied, aged 58, on August 5th or 6th, 1996\n\n“Lovely, bubbly” Maura McKinney’s five adult children pleaded with a judge not to jail their father, Michael McKinney, after he admitted killing their mother with caustic soda, causing burns to 35 per cent of her body. Suspending the last five years of his eight-year sentence, Justice Carney referred to the children’s letter, the couple’s history of alcoholism and McKinney’s previous good character. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nHannah (Margaret) O’Sullivan\n\nDied, aged 40, on August 18th, 1996\n\nHannah O’Sullivan was discovered in a pool of blood by her 12-year-old son on the day of her 40th birthday at her home in Tralee, in Co Kerry. She had been stabbed 99 times by a 35-year-old local man, John O’Mahony, whom she had previously accused of rape, withdrawing the allegation a week before the trial. O’Mahony, who admitted manslaughter but denied intent, claimed she had threatened to revive the rape claim. He later lost his appeal against the murder conviction. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nFiona Pender\n\nLast seen, aged 25, on August 23rd, 1996\n\nVivacious, caring Fiona Pender had returned from London a few months earlier to live in Tullamore, in Co Offaly, when she disappeared from home. She was seven months pregnant. She was last seen early in the morning of August 23rd, 1996, at her flat on Church Street in the town. Afterwards, friends recalled that she had just wanted a secure home for herself and her baby.

A decade later her husband, John Diver, was acquitted at the Central Criminal Court of her murder, following a decision by the Supreme Court to order a retrial because the Garda had failed to comply with regulations governing the treatment of people in custody. John Diver always maintained his innocence. He was embraced by his children as the verdict was announced. The case is now closed, and nobody else is being sought in connection with Geraldine’s death. JO’C\n\nSophie Toscan du Plantier\n\nDied, aged 39, on December 22nd, 1996\n\nThe French documentary maker Sophie Toscan du Plantier was battered to death in west Cork in the days before Christmas 1996. Ian Bailey, who has always maintained his innocence, was found guilty in France of her murder in absentia. Several people who gave Garda statements at the time have recently been reinterviewed. JO’C\n\nBelinda Pereira\n\nDied, aged 27, on December 29th, 1996\n\nA week after the death of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, which continues to attract international media coverage, podcasts and documentary series, another visitor to Ireland died of head injuries in circumstances that remain unexplained. Belinda Pereira, a Sri Lankan national, was found dead in an apartment on Liffey Street in Dublin city centre. She had arrived in Ireland on Christmas Eve to work in the sex trade, and planned to return to London on New Year’s Day. Despite numerous Garda appeals, nobody has been charged with her murder.

She had left a window on the latch and appeared to have been planning to come home. She never made it. In 2015, the Garda searched Balmer’s Bog, outside the town, but no remains have ever been found. The Garda identified a chief suspect in her disappearance – a man who was 35 at the time – but he died in 2017. JO’C\n\nMary Callinan and Sylvia Shields\n\nDied, aged 61 and 57, on March 6th, 1997\n\nMary Callinan and Sylvia Shields, two women “full of goodness, beauty and innocence”, who were patients at St Brendan’s Hospital in Grangegorman, in north Dublin, were found dead in their shared sheltered home. They had been brutally murdered in a savage stabbing attack. Dean Lyons spent nine months in prison for the murders before it emerged he had signed a false statement. In August 1997 Mark Nash made a statement incriminating himself. In 2015, after the uncovering of DNA evidence, Nash was found guilty and sentenced to life. He is also guilty of the murder of Catherine Doyle, whom he murdered in August 1997, along with murdering her husband, Carl. (See entry below.) In May 2020 Nash failed in an application to the European Court of Human Rights to examine his conviction for the Grangegorman murders. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nBernie Sherry\n\nDied, aged 44, on April 6th, 1997\n\nBernie Sherry, a mother of three, was shot dead by her ex-partner, Sean Brennan, near Portarlington, Co Laois, after she ended their relationship. The court heard that the father of eight had been “almost stalking her”. He led the Garda to her body near his flat, close to where Fiona Pender had last been seen nine months earlier. Brennan pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life. JO’C\n\nKitty Gubbins\n\nDied, aged 70, on May 2nd, 1997\n\nKitty Gubbins and her farmer husband, Jimmy, were found lying side by side near the back door of their bungalow in the village of Oola, Co Limerick.

JO’C\n\nMandy Wong\n\nDied, aged 28, on June 11th, 1997\n\nMandy Wong was five months pregnant when she was strangled in her bathroom, where she had been getting ready to wash her hair, at the rented house she shared in Walkinstown, in west Dublin. There did not appear to be a sexual or racial motive, or one of robbery, and there was no sign of a break-in at the Malaysian Chinese national’s home. JO’C\n\nElizabeth (Lily) Troy\n\nDied, aged 60, on July 8th, 1997\n\nElizabeth Troy was found dead in her home in Limerick on July 8th, 1997. She had been strangled. Her husband, 58-year-old Christopher Noel Troy, was charged with her manslaughter and released on bail. Troy took his own life while on bail in August 1997. JO’C\n\nMargaret Murphy\n\nDied, aged 74, on August 1st, 1997\n\nMargaret Murphy, a well-known newspaper vendor, died of a heart attack from the terror she suffered when she was tied up with an electric flex during a burglary in her home. Two men were convicted of her manslaughter: John Arundel, a professional criminal, and Declan Meehan. Arundel was jailed for 11½ years. Meehan, who changed his plea six days into his trial, got eight years. JO’C\n\nCatherine Doyle\n\nDied, aged 28, on August 16th, 1997\n\nCatherine Doyle and her 29-year-old husband, Carl – “dynamite people … so much in love”, her father would later say – had been together since their teens. They moved from Dublin under the rural-resettlement programme, and were blissfully happy raising their four children, all aged under seven, in the countryside when they were stabbed to death by Mark Nash in a vicious attack in their Roscommon home. As six children slept in the house, Nash stabbed Carl and “laid into” Catherine’s sister and his then girlfriend, Sarah Jane Doyle, with a metal tool. When Catherine tried to protect her sister, Nash savagely beat and stabbed her. Nash was found guilty of the murders of Carl and Catherine and the attempted murder of Sarah Jane in November 1998.

JO’C\n\nSheila McDonagh\n\nDied, aged 26, on September 12th, 1997\n\nSheila McDonagh’s husband, James McDonagh, forced her into a bending position, took a knife out of his pocket and stabbed her in front of five witnesses outside a house in Dundalk. He claimed in evidence that she had “come back up into the knife” from a horizontal position. The jury did not believe him. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. He was refused leave to appeal in 2001. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nGillian Thornton\n\nDied, aged 20, on October 17th, 1997\n\nGillian Thornton, a popular, much-loved sister, daughter and friend, left a disco in her native Ballina with a man, telling her two best friends she’d see them later “up town”. She didn’t. The man, 21-year-old Dean Richardson, had sex with her, strangled her and left her semi-naked body in a garden near a laneway. He told the Garda he “just lost the head, I went crazy”. A rape charge was withdrawn when he pleaded guilty to murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Many in the Co Mayo town were upset by the picture painted of Gillian in court, particularly the unchallenged assertion that she had consented to sex. “We were just treated as numbers. We were handed Gillian’s clothes in a box and told to go away,” Gillian’s mother, Angela, later said. JO’C\n\nMary Cully\n\nDied, aged 54, on November 8th, 1997\n\nMary and Vincent Cully, a married couple, were shot dead by their neighbour in the Westmeath townland of Turin (also called Tevrin) in a row over pebble-dashing. Forty-three year old Seamus Dunne had been at war with the couple for the eight years he lived near them, complaining several times to the Garda about what might normally be considered minor differences between neighbours. His last complaint before the day he shot them was over bangers at Halloween. He was given two life sentences for the shocking murders, which left the Cullys’ children, aged between 15 and 26, without their parents. Dunne’s wife moved out, and the house they had lived in together was burned down. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nMary Kelehan\n\nDied, aged 48, on November 10th, 1997\n\nSix times on the day before she was stabbed, Mary Kelehan called the Garda to ask for help. But, her inquest was told, no one came to her. Her body was discovered in the hallway of her Galway home, with stab wounds in her back. The separated mother of four grown-up children was involved in a relationship with Michael O’Donnell, whose body was found in Galway Bay nine days after her death. He had been due to appear in Galway District Court in connection with her death. JO’C\n\nEileen Costello O’Shaughnessy\n\nDied, aged 47, on November 30th, 1997\n\nEileen Costello O’Shaughnessy, a taxi driver, was battered to death after she took a routine fare to Claregalway at about 8pm on the night of November 30th. Her taxi was found at midnight that night with visible signs of violence. Her body was found the next day in the townland of Knockdoemore, outside Galway, 200 metres from the main road. She had been assaulted and murdered. Twenty years later another appeal for information was issued, but as yet her killer has not been found. JO’C\n\n1998\n\nAmanda Smyth\n\nDied, aged 26, on January 3rd, 1998\n\nMandy Smyth was strangled by her ex-partner Niall Gaynor, who subsequently took his own life.

JO’C\n\nFiona Sinnott\n\nLast seen, aged 19, on February 8th, 1998\n\nFiona Sinnott was last seen leaving a pub near her home in Ballyhitt, in Co Wexford on February 8th, 1998. The mother of an 11-month-old girl, she had been the victim of violent attacks previously. The missing-persons inquiry into her disappearance was upgraded to a murder investigation in 2005. JO’C\n\nJoan McCarthy\n\nDied, aged 47, on April 11th, 1998\n\nJoan McCarthy, a mother of four and grandmother in her 40s, was murdered in her bed while babysitting her granddaughter, but nobody has ever been convicted of her killing. Her daughter Aisling and her daughter’s partner, Brian Farrell, came home at 3am from a night out and found her up and well. By the following morning she was dead. Months later Farrell was arrested and charged with her murder. On the eve of his trial, in July 2002, the director of public prosecutions requested the court enter a nolle prosequi. On July 29th, 2004, a verdict of unlawful killing was returned at an inquest on her murder. JO’C\n\nGeorgina O’Donnell\n\nDied, aged 21, on May 2nd, 1998\n\nGeorgina O’Donnell was shot in the face in a Limerick nightclub on Saturday, May 2nd, 1998. The mother of a nine-month-old baby was murdered by Mark Cronin, who had pointed the gun at his wife, Angela (Biddy) Collins. In April 2000 he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Georgina’s mother, Vera O’Donnell, has said she forgives her daughter’s killer and prays he comes out of jail a better man. Her son, Jason, who never recovered from his sister’s death, died in tragic circumstances in 2010. JO’C\n\nSinead Kelly\n\nDied, aged 21, on June 22nd, 1998\n\nSinead Kelly grew up in Santry, in north Dublin, with a loving family, but from her late teens her life had become blighted by heroin. In the early hours of June 22nd, 1998, she was found dead along the banks of the Grand Canal. She had been stabbed to death – not, as initially reported, because her work as a prostitute made her vulnerable but because of a debt she owed as a small-time dealer. Two months earlier she had been raped and badly beaten, and just 30 minutes before she was killed she spoke to gardaí on patrol in the area about it. A number of people have been arrested in connection with the June 1998 killing, and files were prepared for the director of public prosecutions. JO’C\n\nDeirdre Jacob\n\nLast seen, aged 18, on July 28th, 1998\n\nDeirdre Jacob, a student teacher, was almost home from running errands in Newbridge, in Co Kildare, when she disappeared on a Tuesday afternoon in the summer of 1998. In 2018 the Garda upgraded her disappearance to a murder investigation, following a review by the serious-crime review team and new information. The convicted rapist Larry Murphy has been identified as a “person of interest”, but the latest investigative file sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions had not resulted in any charges against him. A three-week search, in October 2021, on the Kildare-Wicklow border yielded no new information, and her family still waits for answers. JO’C\n\nChantal Bergeron\n\nDied, aged 41, on August 20th, 1998\n\nChantal Bergeron was shot at close range by her husband, Louis, who then killed himself, in the idyllic Tipperary cottage where they had planned to live out their retirement. Some people in the community later pointed to red flags in the relationship between the former French navy sailor, who was 53, and his younger wife, reporting that she would sometimes flee the cottage in the middle of the night. In August 1998, just hours after they had returned home from a “jovial” night out with friends, he murdered her with a legally held shotgun. Chantal was remembered as a vivacious and gregarious woman whose interests included early-morning jogs, gardening and organic farming. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nTeresa Doherty\n\nDied, aged 50, on September 21st, 1998\n\nTeresa and her 58-year-old retired garda husband, Bill, a “good and kind” and popular couple, were stabbed to death at home on September 21st, 1998, in Monadreen, Co Tipperary. Martin Doherty, the eldest of their three sons, was found guilty but insane. The court heard he was experiencing an intense period of paranoia and was in a psychotic state when he killed his parents. He had suffered from schizophrenia for many years but had been taken off prescribed antipsychotic drugs prior to the killings. JO’C\n\nChristina Hackett\n\nDied, aged 31, on October 9th, 1998\n\nThirty-one-year-old Tina Hackett died of a single gunshot wound to the head on Friday, October 9th, 1998. The inquest into her death, in 2001, heard evidence from a man with whom she’d been having an affair that she had pointed the gun at her own head. The man received a two-year suspended sentence for illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, and no further action on the incident was taken by the director of public prosecutions. The jury returned an open verdict in relation to Tina Hackett’s death, and her family called for a review of the case. JO’C\n\nMarie Dillon\n\nDied, aged 72, on November 25th, 1998\n\nA campaigner for elderly people living alone, and a much-loved figure in her community, Marie Dillon was brutally beaten after she disturbed a burglar in November 1998. Her partially clothed and badly beaten body was found in the garage of her home in Finglas, in north Dublin. In May 2001 Richard Kearney, who was 17 at the time of the murder, was given a life sentence. JO’C\n\nSiobhán Hynes\n\nDied, aged 17, on December 6th, 1998\n\nSiobhán Hynes, a schoolgirl, was found dead on Tishmane beach, in Carraroe, Co Galway, a week after her 17th birthday. She had been subjected to section-four rape, her larynx was fractured and her body was dumped in the sea. A local man, 25-year-old John (Demesne) McDonagh – whose anonymity had been protected until he was convicted, and who managed to get many of her family members excluded from court – was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment for rape and murder. He appealed the sentence in 2007 but lost. “We will never get Siobhán back,” her heartbroken father said. JO’C\n\nSheila Lynch\n\nDied, aged 44, on December 19th, 1998\n\nShelia Lynch, a mother of four, was strangled in her bed in Cootehill, in Co Cavan, on December 19th, 1998, by her 27-year-old son, Anthony Lynch, just a year after the tragic death of another son in his 20s. Anthony was found guilty, but insane, of his mother’s murder. A dog was also found stabbed to death on the property. JO’C\n\n1999\n\nCatherine Hegarty\n\nDied, aged 33, on February 26th, 1999\n\n“Quiet, gentle” Catherine Hegarty was stabbed three times by her boyfriend, 27-year-old Don O’Halloran, at a flat in Cork city. He said she had called him names and provoked him. He pleaded manslaughter but was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison. JO’C\n\nLayla Brennan\n\nDied, aged 25, on March 2nd, 1999\n\nWhen 26-year-old Philip Colgan stopped Layla Brennan on Nassau Street in Dublin in March 1999 to ask directions, she could not have known he was out of prison on early release for the aggravated double rape of a 79-year-old woman and a Spanish student. He knocked Layla unconscious and strangled her before dumping her body in the Dublin Mountains. Layla had been working as a dental receptionist but lost her job when she became addicted to heroin. At the time of her death she was involved in prostitution. Acknowledging her family’s devastation, Mr Justice Paul Butler said he had to “fight back tears” on occasion as a result of the evidence in this case. Philip Colgan was sentenced to life imprisonment. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nMarie Hennessy\n\nDied, aged 31, on May 10th, 1999\n\nMarie Hennessy, a “beautiful, vivacious” nurse, died two days after she was beaten with a car jack by her 37-year-old husband, Patrick Hennessy, on the side of a road as two of their three young daughters, then aged one and three, sat in a nearby car. After several contradictory statements to the Garda, he admitted he “let fly” when she confronted him about his suspension from his job as a manager at Callan labour exchange for embezzlement. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. He was sentenced to eight years. The court heard that Marie Cleere-Hennessy was not just a sister but also like a mother to her six younger sisters, whom she helped to raise after their mother died in May 1986. JO’C\n\nBente Carroll\n\nDied, aged 45, on May 26th, 1999\n\nBente Carroll, who was born in Denmark, was killed at her home by her husband, Joe Kinsella, who denied her murder but admitted attacking her after a two-day drinking spree. He said he killed her because she was “nagging” him. Bente’s friend Vicky Higgins told the trial that Kinsella had choked his wife twice in the days before her death and had threatened to kill her. Joseph Kinsella was cleared of murder by the jury but convicted of manslaughter in March 2001 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nGertrude Dolan\n\nDied, aged 56, between June 16th and 19th, 1999\n\nGertrude Dolan was stabbed to death at home in East Wall, in Dublin, by her 26-year-old son, John Francis Dolan, who was also found guilty of the manslaughter of his 71-year-old father.

JO’C\n\nEileen Coyne, Bridget McFadden and Margaret Concannon\n\nDied, aged 81, 80 and 72, on July 6th, 1999\n\nSisters Eileen, Bridget and Margaret died in a house fire on the island of Inishbofin, off Co Galway, on July 6th, 1999. Alan Murphy, a 27-year-old hotel worker from Newcastle, Co Down, told the Garda that he walked in the open front door of Eileen Coyne’s house – where her two sisters were visiting from England – and set it alight because he was angry at being thrown out of Day’s pub on the island. He was found guilty of the manslaughter of the three women and of committing arson. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Bridget McFadden’s daughter said the sentence would not restore the lives of three innocent people. The court heard the fire and the deaths of the three women had a profound and continuing effect on the families and the entire community. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nRaonaid Murray\n\nDied, aged 17, on September 4th, 1999\n\nRaonaid Murray, a teenager, left Scott’s pub in Dún Laoghaire, in south Co Dublin, planning to walk home to Glenageary, change her clothes, and rejoin her friends in a nightclub later. But she was stabbed multiple times in a laneway by a person armed with a knife. She managed to walk almost 100 metres towards home before she collapsed and died. Her body was found by her older sister. No motive has ever been established, and there is no prime suspect. Her funeral heard that she wanted to become a writer, that she had plans to repeat her Leaving Certificate and that “all the life, talent and personality” that had been maturing in her had been brutally stolen. A Garda appeal on the anniversary of her death in September 2021 said that extensive lines of inquiry are still being pursued. You can read more here. JO’C\n\nCharlene McAuliffe\n\nDied, aged 19, on October 2nd, 1999\n\nCharlene McAuliffe was murdered in a house in Cork city on October 2nd, 1999. She was beaten with a wok and then choked to death by Gerard Graham, a 35-year-old fisherman. Another man, 27-year-old Alan Graham Clucas, was sentenced to 18 months for his role as an accessory, which involved putting Charlene’s body in the boot of a car. Her remains were dumped in a caravan near Ventry, in Co Kerry. In January 2002, his trial already under way, Graham changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder. JO’C\n\nCatherine Mullins\n\nDied, aged 43, on October 31st, 1999\n\n“We really loved each other. I’m in bits over it,” Francis Cahill, a separated father of 12, told the Garda after he strangled his girlfriend Cathy Mullins in the early hours of Halloween at a flat in Rialto, in Dublin. Her body was found to have 46 older injuries, some of which may have resulted from physical abuse. Mr Justice Carney said Cahill “started his life in Artane and thereafter was living in Fatima Mansions, a disadvantaged background for anyone, I should think”. Cahill was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, with the final 20 months suspended. JO’C\n\n2000\n\nRachel Sandyman\n\nDied, aged 17, on February 5th, 2000\n\nRachel Sandyman, a teenage fast-food worker, was on her way to a house party after a disco when she met her killer. Jonathan Kepple, a 19-year-old living in London, walked with her until they came to waste ground near Nutley Road in Mahon, in Cork, where they kissed and had sex, his trial was told. The pair had an argument. Kepple told the Garda: “Rachel hit me. I snapped.” He repeatedly punched Rachel before strangling her until she stopped screaming. After covering her body in a thicket, he took a bus to the city centre, where he played snooker with a friend. A girl playing found her remains. Kepple was sentenced to life in prison a year later. A neighbour of Rachel’s said: “She was just beginning to blossom into a beautiful young lady when she had her life snuffed out by him.” You can read more here. Brian Hutton\n\nNancy Nolan\n\nDied, aged 81, on February 14th, 2000\n\nNancy Nolan, a retired national-school teacher, was alone in her home in Ballygar, Co Galway, on St Valentine’s Day when she was bludgeoned to death with a lump hammer. She was a widow. Two days later her body was discovered lying in a pool of blood. Her killer, 37-year-old Thomas Murray, also of Ballygar, was a former pupil. The Garda believed he may have borne a grudge. Nancy’s son and five daughters could not make sense of the murder. Murray was on unsupervised temporary release from Castlerea Prison, where he was serving a sentence for murdering another pensioner, also in Ballygar, in 1981. Then aged 17, he stabbed William Mannion to death. During a previous temporary release he was convicted of indecent exposure in Galway. Murray was jailed for life a second time after pleading guilty to murdering Nancy Nolan. You can read more here. BH\n\nJennifer Donnan\n\nDied, aged 42, on April 17th, 2000\n\nJennifer Donnan was strangled by her son in an early-morning row over a cigarette. Damien Donnan, a 20-year-old from De Valera Park, in Limerick, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. An argument broke out between the pair when he went into her bedroom to look for a cigarette, his trial heard. Holding her in a headlock, Donnan snapped his mother’s larynx. After she was dead he woke his nine-year-old brother and told him, “I’m after killing Mam.” Donnan said his mother was an alcoholic and he had been “getting her drink since I was seven. I just had enough. I had enough.” He was given a life sentence for manslaughter, which was suspended on certain conditions. He was ordered to receive psychiatric treatment. Donnan’s sentence was reactivated in 2007 after he broke the terms of his suspension. BH\n\nMaeve Byrne\n\nDied, aged 35, on September 26th, 2000\n\nMaeve Byrne was beaten and stabbed to death by her husband, Stephen Byrne, in her family bungalow in Cuffesgrange, in Co Kilkenny.

They were found to have alcohol in their blood. Later, Stephen Byrne’s body was found off the coast of Wales. Cuffesgrange’s curate, Fr Martin Delaney, told Maeve Byrne’s funeral she had been “a young woman full of life, who was generous to a fault and spontaneous in her friendships and in everything she did”.

She was just a few hundred metres from her home. A Jehovah’s Witness, she was due to attend a Bible-reading class that night; she had just returned from working as an au pair in Italy. Ian Horgan, a neighbour who was 16 at the time, was found guilty of her rape and manslaughter.

His trial heard he picked up his teenage girlfriend from work after the rape and killing. He was released from prison in 2021. BH\n\nDearbhla Keating\n\nDied, aged 28, on November 19th, 2000\n\nDearbhla Keating was stabbed in the heart during a row with two men who stayed in a room at her boyfriend’s house in Co Carlow. Her boyfriend, Alan Walsh, was also seriously injured in the attack. In November 2001, 25-year-old Dermot Lennon was convicted of assault and endangerment. The jury failed to agree a verdict on a charge of manslaughter. Dearbhla Keating had moved to Waterford city a number of months beforehand in an attempt to beat her years-long drug problem. She had returned to Carlow to make plans to return there to live. BH\n\nSandra Collins\n\nLast seen, aged 29, on December 4th, 2000\n\nAfter buying two bags of chips at a takeaway in the Co Mayo seaside village of Killala, Sandra Collins disappeared. She was pregnant. Her pink fleece jacket was later found on the pier. She was not believed to have been distressed. A search of the sea turned up nothing. Her body was never found. A married man who told the Garda he had been in a relationship with her stood trial in 2014 for her murder. A judge directed the jury to find him not guilty, saying there was insufficient evidence. Sandra was a carer for her aunt. BH\n\nJean Reilly\n\nDied, aged 34, on December 8th, 2000\n\nJean Reilly, a nurse and mother of one, was stabbed to death with a steak knife by her ex-partner. Brian Daly, an alcoholic and a chef, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for her manslaughter. His trial heard the pair met at a clinic for alcohol addiction. They had a “tumultuous” relationship; Jean had secured a barring order against Daly. Breaking the order after a day’s heavy drinking, he turned up at her home in Laytown, in Co Meath, to collect clothes. After assaulting her friend, Daly then stabbed her through the heart. She stumbled outside and died on the pavement. BH\n\nJennifer Wilkinson\n\nDied, aged 24, on December 13th, 2000\n\nJennifer Wilkinson was stabbed to death in the hallway of her home by her ex-boyfriend. Declan Burke, then 27, could not tolerate the mother of one seeing another man, his murder trial heard. Burke waited outside the house, at The Rise, Boden Park, Ballyboden, Dublin, for hours. After forcing his way in, he stabbed Jennifer at the bottom of the stairs. Then he seriously injured her mother, who was looking after her young child. He was given a life sentence for murder and a separate three-year term for that attack. Leaving the scene, he said: “That’s an end to it now.” Burke had been getting psychiatric treatment and had tried to take his own life “around 50 or 60 times”. A psychologist said his past sexual abuse led to post-traumatic stress disorder, flashbacks and bouts of uncontrollable anger. BH\n\nSusan Prakash\n\nDied, aged 28, on December 16th, 2000\n\nSusan Prakash had sparkling eyes. She was small and delicate. James Conroy, a farm labourer, battered her to death with a wheel brace at a picnic spot in the Slieve Bloom Mountains, in Co Laois, nine days before Christmas. The mother of two young children, aged three and six, died choking on her own blood, which was flowing from serious head wounds, including a broken jaw. Hours after the murder, Conroy walked into a Garda station, still wearing blood-soaked clothes, and confessed. He claimed the pair were lovers and he lost his temper when she asked if he raped young girls. Conroy was previously jailed for six years for sexual assault. “She put up a battle,” Conroy told the Garda. “She begged me to stop. I couldn’t stop.” Conroy was jailed for life. BH\n\n2001\n\nMary Gough\n\nDied, aged 27, on March 1st, 2001\n\nMary Gough, a legal secretary, was a good and thoughtful daughter. The only girl in a family of six children, she was strangled by her husband of six months, Colin Whelan. Her body was found at the foot of the stairs in their home on Clonard Street in Balbriggan, in north Co Dublin. It was thought she had fallen down the stairs. Forensic tests showed otherwise. Searches of Whelan’s computer revealed he had looked up “death by strangulation”, “choking” and “smothering” in the days leading up to the killing. Charged with murder, Whelan vanished. His car was found in Howth, on the northern coast of Dublin Bay. It was thought he had taken his own life. But a holidaymaker spotted him working in a bar in Majorca a year later. He had been living a double life under the pseudonym Martin Sweeney and had a girlfriend. A tip-off to the Garda saw him extradited back to Ireland, where he was given a life sentence. BH\n\nLiu Quing\n\nDied, aged 19, between March 12th and 14th, 2001\n\nLiu Quing was in Ireland to learn English. Her family dug deep to finance her studies, raising £15,000. She phoned home and wrote often. She seemed happy. The teenager’s badly charred body and that of her 19-year-old flatmate, Yue Feng, were found in their rented apartment at Blackhall Square in Dublin. A person they considered a friend, Yu Jie, also Chinese, had strangled the pair. The apartment was then set ablaze in a botched attempt to hide his tracks. His trial heard the motive was money.

They ran a shop and petrol station. Fox admitted he was jealous and possessive and believed his wife was having an affair. A row broke out when she told him she wanted a break from their relationship. “I loved my wife so much but she didn’t love me, and I just went mad,” he told the Garda. Fox beat his wife with his fists and a hurl. He used a broken beer bottle to slash her throat. He stabbed her several times with a kitchen knife. Then he went to his sons’ bedroom and stabbed nine-year-old Trevor and seven-year-old Cillian repeatedly. Wounds on their hands showed they had struggled to defend themselves. Fox was given three life sentences. BH\n\nGeraldine Kissane\n\nDied, aged 23, on October 8th, 2001\n\nGeraldine Kissane, who worked in an off-licence, had just finished a shift before midnight when she returned to her home in Shannon, in Co Clare. Waiting outside was her ex-boyfriend, 32-year-old Mark Sims. She had ended the relationship months before. His ongoing obsession with her led to solicitor’s letters. The separated father of three was warned to stop harassing her to avoid court action. In front of her sister, with whom she shared the house, Sims dragged Geraldine down an alley and on to open ground, where he shot her twice. Then he killed himself. Three hours earlier, Sims had been looking after his children and was said to be “in good form” as he had a cup of tea with his estranged wife. BH\n\nMargaret Fahy\n\nDied, aged 78, on September 10th, 2001\n\nMargaret Fahy, a grandmother, lay on the floor of her home in Ballindooley, in Co Galway, with a walking stick protruding from a wound in her neck. She had extensive head injuries. Her back was broken. A fingertip was severed and her chest was crushed. There was blood on the walls, floor and ceiling. Next to her, asleep on the couch, was her 40-year-old son, Seán Fahy. Paranoid and delusional, the father of five had been released from St Brigid’s psychiatric hospital, in Ballinasloe, just five weeks beforehand. After drinking heavily, he confronted his mother, believing she was trying to poison him. He slept the night after savagely murdering her and decided in the morning to take an overdose. A brother found them both. Fahy survived and went on to tell the Gardaí “I’m sorry for the trouble I have caused. I loved that woman.” At his murder trial a jury took 10 minutes to find Fahy guilty but insane. BH\n\nLynda Dunne\n\nDied, aged 24, on September 18th, 2001\n\nLynda Dunne was a nice, friendly girl, very chatty and outgoing, a neighbour in Ballymun, in north Dublin, said. The young mother was knifed to death in her flat by her ex-boyfriend Liam Wells. The pair had rowed about access to their 18-month-old daughter. During the frenzied stabbing, Wells, a 37-year-old scaffolder, kissed Dunne as she lay dying on the couch. Then he placed a photograph of him and their baby in her hands. Wells had left the flat two months earlier to live with another woman. He told the Garda he was worried Dunne was not looking after their child. He “flipped” when she told him he would not see their daughter, he said. Wells then left the blood-soaked scene with a knife, intending to kill Lynda’s mother, who lived nearby. He was jailed for life, and was handed separate sentences for assaulting Lynda Dunne’s mother and her partner. BH\n\nBettina Poeschel\n\nDied, aged 28, on September 25th, 2001\n\nBettina Poeschel, a German journalist, was on the final day of her holiday in Ireland when she went to visit Newgrange, the Stone Age monument in Co Meath. Instead she was raped and murdered and her body, naked from the waist down, was dumped in dense undergrowth nearby. Her remains were found three weeks after she vanished while walking to the monument. Her murderer, Michael Murphy, then 39, had killed before. He was working on a motorway construction site nearby when he abducted Bettina Poeschel. During Garda questioning he broke down, saying: “Just tell that girl’s parents I’m sorry for taking her life and for what I did to her.” Murphy was given life imprisonment. An appeal was rejected. Eighteen years earlier, Murphy strangled Catherine Carroll, a 64-year-old widow, as she returned from a whist drive. He served nine years of a 12-year manslaughter sentence. A string of previous convictions also included an assault on two women as they walked home from a disco. BH\n\nLorraine O’Connor\n\nDied, aged 19, on October 23rd, 2001\n\nLorraine O’Connor was very close to her mother, Anne. She told her everything. When her boyfriend of two years, Noel Hogan, then 30, turned up alone at the O’Connors’ family pub, in Ennis in Co Clare, her mother asked where Lorraine was. He said he didn’t know. She was probably back at the flat they shared, he told her. Anne’s suspicions grew, and she reported her only daughter missing. Days later her strangled body was found under a bed in the flat. Hogan went missing. Hogan had stolen £2,600 from the pub. When the cash ran out he called the Garda from England and admitted the murder. Hogan was brought back and jailed for life. Previous convictions included a sentence for sexual assault. BH\n\nSr Philomena Lyons\n\nDied, aged 68, on December 15th, 2001\n\nBorn Christina Lyons in Rahan, in Mallow in Co Cork, Sr Philomena Lyons was in jovial mood on the cold morning of her murder. She was to take a bus from her convent in Ballybay, in Co Monaghan, to Dublin for the Christmas holidays. Although physically frail, she had a soaring spirit. As she waited at the bus stop she was dragged back into the convent grounds. She was strangled with her own scarf, and her tights and underwear pulled down. She was eight days short of her 69th birthday. The Garda asked locals to fill in a questionnaire. Discrepancies appeared in 21-year-old Kealen Herron’s response. Fingerprints on Sr Lyons’s glasses and DNA evidence later put him at the scene. It is believed she was not his intended target. A young Lithuanian woman had unwittingly escaped his pursuit, and he turned instead on the nun. He was jailed for life. BH\n\nLisa Bell\n\nDied, aged 22, on December 15th, 2001\n\nLisa Bell, a night-shift worker with An Post, was getting on well with her brother David. The pair shared a flat at St Teresa’s Gardens in Dublin with her two-year-old son. But rows started after David Bell, then 24 years old, began using heroin again. He was selling things from around the house, including a Christmas present for the child, to fund his addiction. During their final row Bell took a Stanley knife to his sister as she sat up in bed. He slashed her throat and “covered her with a pillow so I wouldn’t have to look at her face”, he admitted. Their father found Lisa Bell’s body hidden in a sleeping bag inside a bedroom wardrobe. David Bell was given a life sentence.

He had worked as a night porter there for just six days when he pointed a gun at her and demanded cash. She told him, “This is not going to happen,” but he shot her at point-blank range twice and in two separate locations, before stealing €3,000 from the hotel. He then returned and shot her a third time. He was given a life sentence for her murder. In June 2022, Nascimento – who is being held at Shelton Abbey – launched a High Court challenge over what he claims is a refusal by the Minister for Justice to consider his entitlement to parole.

Her husband, Declan Power, a mechanic, believed she was having an affair with her ex-employer, a wealthy businessman named Maurice Curran.

Power turned himself in, admitting he was jealous and possessive of his wife. He was jailed for life. You can read more here. BH\n\nRosie Collinson\n\nDied, aged 50, on March 3rd, 2002\n\nDays before she was murdered, Rosie Collinson had twice contacted a social worker to say she was in fear of her estranged husband. John Collinson had turned up unexpectedly in Carrick-on-Suir, the Co Tipperary town where she lived. He booked into a hotel. The pair had been separated for six years. During a meeting in the hotel, a row broke out over her relationship with another man. Collinson told his trial he “snapped” when she said the man “will f***king kill you”. He beat and strangled her to death. He had been violent to her during their marriage as well. A broken jaw and broken bones were among her past injuries. Rosie’s body was so disfigured she had to be identified by her jewellery. Her coffin was closed. Her husband gave himself up to the Garda. He was jailed for 10 years for manslaughter. A defence of provocation was accepted by the jury. You can read more here. BH\n\nNichola Sweeney\n\nDied, aged 19, on April 27th, 2002\n\nMusic-loving teenager Nichola was getting ready for a night out with her friend Sinead O’Leary. It was in her home in Cork, a house she chose, and loved, when her family had returned to Ireland. She was in the en suite bathroom, Sinead curling her hair on the bed, when a neighbour appeared in the room. Without uttering a word and carrying two knives, Peter Whelan, then 20, launched into a savage attack on the pair. Nichola died from stab wounds. Sinead was critically injured but able to give gardaí a detailed description of their attacker. He was recognised when he returned to the scene to watch detectives. Whelan blamed voices in his head. Two weeks previously he had finished treatment for alcohol and substance abuse. He was handed a life sentence for murder and a 15-year sentence for the attempted murder of Sinead.

She was squatting with her boyfriend, Phillip Reddin. The pair had been rowing about his ex-girlfriend, Reddin, who was 23 at the time, told the Garda. He said Niamh began hitting him when he grabbed her by the throat. “I grabbed her neck and I kept on choking her, and before I knew it she was blue in the face,” he confessed. “I panicked. I tried covering my tracks by cutting her throat with shears. I knew a lot of prints were on them.” Reddin was jailed for life. In 2011 he died of a heart attack in his jail cell. A pathologist could not determine if it was caused by chronic cocaine use or an inherited heart disease. You can read more here. BH\n\nNora Kiely\n\nDied, age 46, on July 25th, 2002\n\nNora Kiely, a lab technician, had made a life for herself against the odds. Despite a constant battle with a severe form of schizophrenia since she was 22-years-old, she held down her job at St Finbarr’s Hospital in Cork. She had good friends in the city. She was always well dressed. Nora was strangled during a robbery at her flat on Leitrim Street. Her body was found in bed, naked from the waist down. A pathologist said the evidence was highly suggestive of an attempted sexual assault. The robbers had taken €20. A neighbour in the same apartment block, 20-year-old Brian Walsh, was convicted of murder. He got a life sentence. His flatmate Thomas Penkert was acquitted of murder but given a 12-year sentence for the break-in. BH\n\nCarmel Coyne\n\nDied, aged 42, on August 11th-12th, 2002\n\nCarmel Coyne was “a lovely girl, beautiful and very bright”, according to a neighbour who last saw her “buying a school uniform for her young lad. There wasn’t a bother on her at all.” On the day of her murder, Carmel, who had four children, met her estranged husband, Noel Curran. The pair were drinking in Sallins, in Co Kildare. They went back to his caravan, several kilometres north of the nearby town of Allenwood, and drank more. Despite an argument, during which she walked out, Curran said, he brought her back and she eventually went to bed. The lorry driver strangled her while she slept. He continued drinking the next day before turning himself in. He was jailed for life. BH\n\nMook Ah Mooi\n\nDied, aged 48, on August 22nd, 2002\n\nMook Ah Mooi watched a film with her killer before he turned on her.

Mook told Lamhin that her daughter was going to France with another man. He would have to return to Malaysia, she told him. They rowed. After strangling Mook, Lamhin threw himself in the River Liffey, but he was fished out by a garda. He admitted the killing, claiming he had lost control and was merely trying to stop Mook screaming. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denied murder. His plea was thrown out, and a jury found him guilty of murder. He was jailed for life. BH\n\nChristine Quinn\n\nDied, aged 36, on December 5th, 2002\n\nChristine Quinn’s teenage killer used a bloodied £50 note to buy a PlayStation game after murdering her. A PlayStation was missing from her home in Kilkenny, which was set ablaze after she had been stabbed 35 times. A similar console was found in the home of Mark Costigan, then 16 years old. His trial heard he had been friends with Christine’s son Ronan and a regular visitor to their home, but they fell out over claims that Costigan may have stolen Christine’s mobile phone. Costigan’s trial heard he had set three fires around the house after the frenzied stabbing. A blade was lodged in Christine’s head when her other son found her. Costigan was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder. You can read more here.

The Dubliner, who was living in Cork, had suffered from anorexia and alcoholism. Her partner, 44-year-old Edward McKenna, who was originally from Liverpool, was a chronic alcoholic. After beating Jean to death, the part-time doorman stepped over her body to record a film – The Field – on television. Then he went to bed. Jean’s chest almost caved in because so many of her ribs were fractured. She had a broken jaw. There were 108 bruises and cuts on her body. When Carol Scanlon saw her daughter Jean’s body she “could not believe that one human being could do that to another”. Friends and a GP had warned her that Jean “would end up dead”. McKenna told the Garda: “I was vicious. She was just drawing out my temper.” The killer was given six years in prison for manslaughter. Jean’s mother said the only consolation was that “no one would ever hurt Jean again”. BH\n\nMarie Bridgeman\n\nDied, aged 56, on January 21st, 2003\n\nMarie Bridgeman was a well-known brothel keeper. After separating from her husband she was struggling for money – and “did it for my family”, she once said. She had been convicted of brothel-running in Dublin and tax evasion. On the night of her killing she was returning home from the city to Ratoath, in Co Meath, on a bus. Her son Kevin Bridgeman – she was a mother of two – was there to collect her. Neighbours heard a commotion and saw the 38-year-old, a chronic paranoid schizophrenic, jumping on his mother. He later told the Garda she was domineering and “wrecking” his head. She died from a combination of brain injury, blood inhalation, facial fractures and compression of the neck. Found guilty but insane, her son was detained in the Central Mental Hospital. BH\n\nCliona Magner\n\nDied, aged 19, on February 14th, 2003\n\nCliona’s schoolgirl dream was to become a rally racer.

Eduart Kulici, then 24, travelled with a friend. Lindita showed the pair around and they went to Toffs nightclub. Kulici got jealous when she hugged another man at the club. They argued. Back at her house, Lindita pleaded with him to leave her alone, but Kulici spent the night in her bedroom. In the morning Kulici laughed as he told his friend, “I killed the f***ing b**ch.” Lindita had been strangled with the necklace she was wearing.

A fluent French speaker, she took up a job as a make-up artist at the Brown Thomas department store after graduating with an honours degree in European studies. Restless, she answered an ad for a receptionist at an alternative-therapy clinic in Walkinstown, in west Dublin. There she fell under the spell of its owner, Christopher Newman, who was 61-years-old. The Indian-born British national used the alias Prof Saph Dean. She was in awe of him. The pair began an affair. A man Georgina met at a charity ball had sent her text messages. Dean read them and left an aggressive voicemail for the man. After a row, Dean stabbed her more than 20 times in a flat beside his clinic. He fled but was arrested by police in London while drunk. They tried to contact Georgina on his phone. Gardaí who had just found her body responded. Newman was tried in London and sentenced to life in jail. BH\n\nXiang Yi Wang\n\nDied, aged 21, on July 4th, 2003\n\nKnown in Ireland as Linda, Xiang Yi Wang was an only child. It was a huge decision for her parents to send her here from China. The gifted piano teacher was their hope, their future. Two simple reasons, her father said, settled their country of choice: Ireland was safe, and Ireland was beautiful. Xiang was stabbed to death with a kitchen knife in an open green in Bray, Co Wicklow. She had been in a relationship with her killer. Lawyers for 26-year-old Hua Yu Feng argued it was a crime of passion. Xiang had confessed to a date with a garda when they met at the green near her home. Feng got “very crazy, very angry”. He stabbed in her in the back six times, the blade twice going right through her body. Her last words, he said, were, “I’m sorry, Mum and Dad.” Feng was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. He was jailed for 10 years.

Dunamon Castle, the headquarters of the Divine Word Mission, was just across from her farmhouse in Co Roscommon. She had been at Mass there as usual on the Sunday. She seemed normal and unworried. Later that day her husband, Brian Flynn, a construction worker and part-time nightclub doorman, went to a local pub to watch an All-Ireland semi-final. What happened when he returned home remains a mystery. It is believed he shot his wife before taking his own life. Flynn rang an ambulance to report a terrible accident. Ann was found dead in a chair in the livingroom. He was found dead in the back porch. They were widely regarded as decent, hard-working people and good neighbours. The double killing baffled investigators. You can read more here.

Walking from Mass in Lifford, Co Donegal, over the river to her home in Strabane, Co Tyrone, the mother of five accepted a lift from Trevor Hamilton. A complete stranger, Hamilton was a convicted rapist just months out of prison, on parole. He bludgeoned Attracta with an axe or hatchet before burying her in an animal-feed sack in a hole dug into the side of a riverbank behind his home. Such was the state of her body when it was found, four months later, that experts could not be certain she was sexually assaulted. Sentenced to life, Hamilton was told he would die in prison. BH\n\n2004\n\nDolores McCrea\n\nDied, aged 39, between January 20th and 22nd, 2004\n\nDespite an increasingly abusive marriage, Dolores McCrea tried to keep the good side out. She was a devoted mother of four daughters. She raised funds for the local school in Co Donegal. When friends asked about her bruises she brushed it off. She eventually plucked up the courage to leave her husband, Gary McCrea, a 41-year-old mechanic. She took a flat in Ballintra and made a new home for her children. She took on two pub jobs to make ends meet. Dolores called to the family home nearby, where her husband stayed, on her way to a darts game with the local women’s team. They were to discuss him buying her car. Dolores never arrived at the darts match. The next morning one of her daughters woke another. “Mammy’s not home,” she said. It is possible McCrea strangled her. It was impossible to say definitively, as he burned her body in a fire that reached 1,000 degrees – hotter than a crematorium furnace. Convicted of murder, he was given a life sentence. An appeal was rejected. You can read more here.
