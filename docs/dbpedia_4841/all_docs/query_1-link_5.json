The first is more of a visual picture while the second has detailed information. This ancestry is as I know it here at the end of the year 2000.\n\nThis ten generation narrative is as generated for John (the middle child and thus the choice) but it is the same for each one of you. If you would like your own version, I would be happy to generate it and print it out for you. Be aware that if you want to print this yourself, it is some 40 plus pages long. I have omitted details on the living folks but they are available if you want a hard copy. This is to help prevent someone from looking at the webpage information and stealing your identity.\n\nDad"
