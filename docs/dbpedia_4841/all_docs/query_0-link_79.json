It is an ancient fertility festival.\n\nBeltaine is associated with the Celtic God, Bel (also known as Belenus and Balor). Bel is a God of light, fire and the Sun. Fires are an important custom at Beltaine and people would leap over them to ensure their fertility. Cattle were also driven through the ashes or between two fires to ensure a good milk yield.\n\nThe Beltaine fire was kindled with Birch twigs and much of the festival was spent with couples frolicking in the woods. A Maypole, representing the phallus and made from Birch wood was erected or was sometimes a living Birch tree and fertility dances were performed around it to ensure good health and abundant crops.\n\nAs at Samhain, the veil between our world and the Underworld is considered to be thin at this time and the spirits of our Ancestors can be contacted.\n\nToday in Irish History: 1 May 1171 – Diarmaid MacMurrough, King of Leinster, dies in Ferns, Co Wexford.\n\nStrongbow is his (disputed) successor (MacMurrough’s remaining legitimate son, Connor, has been executed while a hostage of Rory O’Connor).\n\nDiarmait Mac Murchada (also known as Diarmait na nGall, “Dermot of the Foreigners”, “Daimait MacMorchada”) anglicised as Dermot MacMurrough was the King of Leinster, and is often considered to have been the most notorious traitor in Irish history. Ousted as King of Leinster, he invited King Henry II of England to assist him in regaining the throne. The subsequent invasion led to Henry becoming Lord of Ireland himself, and marked the beginning of eight centuries of English dominance.\n\nToday in Irish History: 1 May 1916 – Easter Rising, Pádraig Pearse’ Letter to his Mother.\n\nMy dear Mother, You will I know have been longing to hear from me. I do not know how much you have heard since the last note I sent you from the G.P.O.\n\nOn Friday evening the Post Office was set on fire and we had to abandon it. We dashed into Moore Street and remained in the houses in Moore St. on Saturday evening? We then found that we were surrounded by troops and that we had practically no food.\n\nWe decided in order to prevent further slaughter of the civilian population and in the hope of saving the lives of our followers, to ask the General Commanding the British Forces to discuss terms. He replied that he would receive me only if I surrendered unconditionally and this I did. I was taken to the Headquarters of the British Command in Ireland and there I wrote and signed an order to our men to lay down their arms. All this I did in accordance with the decision of our Provisional Government who were with us in Moore St. My own opinion was in favour of one more desperate sally before opening negotiations, but I yielded to the majority, and I think now the majority was right, as the sally would have resulted only in losing the lives of perhaps 50 or 100 of our men, and we should have had to surrender in the long run as we were without food.\n\nI was brought in here on Saturday evening and later all the men with us in Moore St. were brought here. Those in the other parts of the City have, I understand, been taken to other barracks and prisons. All here are safe and well. Willie and all the St. Enda’s boys are here. I have not seen them since Saturday, but I believe they are all well and that they are not now in any danger. Our hope and belief is that the Government will spare the lives of all our followers, but we do not expect that they will spare the lives of the leaders. We are ready to die and we shall die cheerfully and proudly. Personally I do not hope or even desire to live, but I do hope and desire and believe that the lives of all our followers will be saved including the lives dear to you and me (my own excepted) and this will be a great consolation to me when dying.\n\nYou must not grieve for all this. We have preserved Ireland’s honour and our own. Our deeds of last week are the most splendid in Ireland’s history. People will say hard things of us now, but we shall be remembered by posterity and blessed by unborn generations.

Ireland had maintained strict neutrality during WWII. In language that to many seems mind-boggling, de Valera claimed it “would have been an act of unpardonable discourtesy to the German nation and to Dr Hempel (German Ambassador). During the whole of the war, Dr Hempel’s conduct was irreproachable.”\n\nHempel’s conduct may have been as described, but de Valera would have been well aware at this stage of the horrors of German concentration camps. One irate letter-writer from New York wrote:\n\n“Have you seen the motion pictures of the victims of German concentration camps, de Valera? Have you seen the crematoriums? Have you seen the bodies of little children murdered by Nazi hands? Have you seen the flourishing cabbages—cabbages for German food—flourishing because of the fertiliser, human remains of citizens from almost completely Catholic countries like Poland? These were citizens of a conquered country—and ÉIRE might easily have been a conquered country, neutrality or no neutrality. Have you seen the living dead, de Valera? Skin stretched over bone, and too weak to walk?”\n\nSource: National Archives\n\nToday in Irish History: 2 May 1957 – Death of Fr Aloysius Roche, Irish patriot.\n\nWhile many clerics have supported the armed struggle of the IRA since 1916, the Capuchin Friars have been particularly noted for their republicanism.\n\nOne such Capuchin was Fr Aloysius Roche, the son of an Irish father and English mother, born in Scotland in 1886. He studied for the priesthood and, following his ordination, he was transferred to Dublin where he was attached to the Capuchin Order in Church Street.\n\nDuring Easter Week 1916, Fr Aloysius along with Frs Albert, Augustine and Dominic brought spiritual aid to the Volunteers in the numerous garrisons and outposts throughout Dublin.\n\nFollowing Pádraig Pearse’s surrender on Saturday, 29 April 1916, Fr Aloysius spent the next day carrying the surrender order to the main garrisons on the south side of the city.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 3 May, Fr Aloysius administered the last sacraments to Pearse, MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke, the first three leaders of the Rising to be executed.\n\nOn 7 May, he met John Dillon, a leading member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, who agreed to do all in his power to persuade the British government to stop the executions. And it was largely due to his efforts that Dillon, five days later, during a debate on the rising in the House of Commons, launched a blistering attack on the British government’s handling of the situation in Ireland.\n\nEarlier that day, Fr Aloysius accompanied James Connolly by ambulance from Dublin Castle to Kilmainham Gaol for execution and stood behind the firing squad as they fired the final volley.\n\nDuring the Tan and Civil Wars he was an enthusiastic and practical supporter of the national struggle and continued his republican allegiance throughout the following decades.\n\nThe tall figure of Fr Aloysius was a familiar sight along Dublin’s quays for over fifty years.\n\n3 May :-\n\nToday in Irish History – 3 May:\n\n1714 – Sir Wentworth Harman, MP for Lanesborough, dies from the wounds he receives in a carriage accident on 28 April.\n\n1785 – The Irish Academy, later to become the Royal Irish Academy, meets for the first time.\n\n1903 – Bing Crosby, descendant of Irish immigrants, is born in Tacoma, Washington, as Harry Lillis Crosby.\n\n1915 – Birth in Galway of novelist Walter Macken.\n\n1916 – Pádraig Pearse, Thomas Clarke and Thomas MacDonagh executed by firing squad in Kilmainham Gaol.\n\n1921 – The South Mayo IRA flying column under Tom Maguire together with members of the east Mayo flying column ambush British troops at Tourmakeady.

Dublin born (1879) Pearse graduated from the Royal University in 1901 with a degree in Arts and Law. A strong believer in education he founded two schools, Coláiste Éanna and Coláiste Íde, where teaching was through the Irish language. Pearse was a founder member of the Irish Volunteers, and the primary author of the Proclamation of Independence. During the Rising, he fought in the GPO and was Commander in Chief of the rebel forces.\n\nThomas James Clarke who fought in the GPO. A number of the 1916 leaders were not Irish born. Most notably de Valera (United States) and Clarke who was born in the Isle of Wight in 1857. Clarke’s father served in the British army. While in America, Clarke joined Clann na nGael. In 1883, he was sentenced to fifteen years of penal servitude for his role in a bombing campaign in London. Clarke was the first signatory of the Proclamation of Independence through deference to his seniority, Clarke was with the group that occupied the GPO.\n\nThomas MacDonagh. The Cloughjordan, Co Tipperary born MacDonagh was a teacher and founder of St. Enda’s (Coláiste Éanna) School with Pádraig Pearse. A creative mind, his play ‘When the Dawn is Come’ was produced at the Abbey theatre. He was commander of the Second Battalion of Volunteers that occupied Jacob’s biscuit factory and surrounding houses during the Rising.\n\nPhoto credit: 1916 Easter Revolution in Colour\n\n4 May:-\n\nToday in Irish History – 4 May:\n\n1699 – According to Jonathan Swift’s book, Gulliver’s Travels, it was on this day that Lemuel Gulliver sets sail on board the Antelope from Bristol.\n\n1715 – Joseph Deane, Justice of Assize for Munster and MP for Co.

Prior to the Easter Rising he had been an active member of the republican movement, joining both Fianna Éireann and the Irish Volunteers. A dedicated teetotaler, Colbert was captain of F Company of the Fourth Battalion which occupied the Marrowbone Lane distillery until surrendering on Sunday, 30 April 1916.\n\nÉamonn Ceannt: Born in Co Galway 1881. Éamonn Ceannt was a skilled Uilleann piper. He was a co-founder of the Irish Volunteers, partaking in the successful Howth gun-running operation of 1914. As the commander of the Fourth Battalion of Irish Volunteers during the Rising, he took possession of the South Dublin Union (St. James Hospital).\n\nMichael Mallin: Born in Co Dublin 1874. A music teacher, devout Catholic and teetotaler. On the eve of the 1916 Rising, Michael Mallin played the flute in the four-piece Workers’ Orchestra during a recital for the Irish Citizen Army in Dublin’s Liberty Hall. Mallin was second in command of the Irish Citizen Army under James Connolly and commanded the garrison at St. Stephen’s Green in Dublin, with Constance Markievicz as his second in command.\n\nSeán Heuston: Born in Co Limerick 1891. With Con Colbert, Heuston was involved in the education of the schoolboys at Scoil Éanna, organising drill and musketry exercises. A section of the First Battalion of the Volunteers, under the leadership of Heuston, occupied the Mendicity Institute.\n\nToday in Irish History: 8 May 1567 – Shane O’Neill’s army crosses the Swilly estuary at Farsetmore, and is defeated in a pitched battle by Hugh O’Donnell.\n\nMany drown while trying to escape; O’Neill loses 1,300 men.\n\nThe Battle of Farsetmore was fought near Letterkenny in Co Donegal, on 8 May 1567, between the O’Neill and O’Donnell Túath. Shane O’Neill, chief of the O’Neills of Tyrone, was defeated by Aodh mac Maghnusa Ó Domhnaill (Hugh O’Donnell) and the O’Donnells freed themselves from O’Neill aspirations of ruling Ulster as its King.\n\n‘If Elizabeth, your mistress, is Queen of England, I am O’Neill, King of Ulster; I never made peace with her without having been previously solicited to it by her. I am not ambitious for the abject title of Earl… I have gained that kingdom by my sword, and by the sword I will preserve it.’ –Shane O’Neill’s response to Queen Elizabeth’s message offering him an English title.\n\nShane O’Neill had, in the previous 20 years, eliminated his rivals within the O’Neills and asserted his authority over neighbouring clans (or “septs”) the MacDonnells in Antrim and O’Donnells in Donegal. In 1566, the English Lord Deputy of Ireland, Henry Sidney, gave military support to the O’Donnells against O’Neill, who was regarded as a destabilising and anti-English power in the north of Ireland. O’Neill forced out these English troops, but the new O’Donnell chieftain, Hugh O’Donnell, took the opportunity to assert his independence and raided O’Neill’s lands at Strabane. In response, O’Neill mustered his armed forces and marched into O’Donnell territory.\n\nPhoto: An artist’s impression of an O’Donnell gallowglass dispatching an O’Neill kern in the waters of the Swilly, with Glebe Hill in the background.\n\nPhoto: Clonmel Town Walls.\n\nToday in Irish History: 22 May 1946 – George Best, the greatest player of his generation and the world’s first superstar footballer, is born in Belfast.\n\nGeorge Best is undoubtedly the finest Irish soccer player ever, and probably one of the five finest footballers ever. Best was discovered by famed Belfast scout Bob Bishop who told Manchester United manager Matt Busby “I have found a genius.” He was not exaggerating. Best made his debut as a 17 year old for United on 14 September 1963. For the next ten years, he lit up the football landscape, before alcohol took its toll.\n\nBest was the first soccer superstar. In 1965, he demolished Portuguese giants Benfica almost single-handedly in what was then the European Cup, after which he was dubbed “El Beatle” by the Portuguese press. Best won league championship medals with United in 1965 and 1967. In 1968 he won the European Cup with United, and was named the European Footballer of the Year and Football Writers’ Association Player of the Year.\n\nThen it started to go downhill. The young man who was shy by nature started drinking heavily, missing training sessions and games. The pressure to perform in what was becoming a very poor United team added to his problems. He walked out on United in 1972, returned and then finally quit the club in 1974. The ghost of a wonderful footballer played itinerantly for 11 clubs in South Africa, Ireland (Cork Celtic), Scotland and USA for a period, but he could never beat his drink demons which saw him in 1984 serve a three-month prison sentence for drunk driving, assaulting a police officer and failing to answer bail.\n\nOne of Best’s goals for the San Jose Earthquakes in 1981 shows just what Best was capable of even at 36.\n\nGeorge Best GOAL Ever: http://youtu.be/U2HWUbFGHMU\n\nBest lived the pop star life to the full. In one of his most famous anecdotes, he tells of a waiter delivering champagne to Best’s hotel room where thousands of pounds of casino winnings and Miss World lay on the bed. The waiter asked: “Mr. Best, where did it all go wrong?”\n\nBest told self-deprecating stories about himself to the day he died 25 November 2005. “I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars. The rest I just squandered.”\n\nHe was a beautiful man who didn’t know how to handle fame. Jeff Powell of The Mail on Sunday summed the Belfast Boy up best.\n\n“History will rank him among the three best footballers. But the real debate is not the one about whether he, Pele or Maradona is the greatest. George was simply the most beautiful footballer of all, in every sense. The most impossibly handsome, the most poetic in motion, the most romantic lover of the ball.”\n\n23 May:-\n\nToday in Irish History: 23 May 1798 – United Irish Rebellion begins in Wexford and in Leinster.\n\nThe short lived, brutal 1798 Rebellion instigated by the United Irishmen commences when on the night of the 23rd May, the mail coaches leaving Dublin were seized – as a signal to those United Irishmen outside the capital that the time of the uprising had arrived.\n\nFounded in 1791, The United Irishmen had been inspired by the French Revolution. Led by Theobald Wolfe Tone, Thomas Russell, Henry Joy McCracken and William Drennan, their idealistic goal was to unite Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter into one political movement to rid Ireland of English rule. The seizure of the mail coaches did not evoke a rising in Dublin as planned and over the coming days mis-matched Irish rebels throughout the country, but especially Wexford, were put to the sword by a brutal English response.\n\nThe 1798 Rebellion was the bloodiest in Irish History. Over two months, atrocities occurred on both sides. The number of casualties among the Irish – rebels and civilians – ranges from 10,000 to 50,000. English military casualties (many of them Irish) are estimated between 1,000-2,000 with possibly another 1,000 civilians loyal to the crown also killed.\n\nRebellion is coming: http://youtu.be/TT70dlg0yG4\n\nPhoto: Henry Joy McCracken\n\nToday in Irish History: 23 May 2015 – Irish voters make history in gay marriage referendum, becoming the first country to ask it’s electorate to legalise gay marriage.\n\nToday in Irish History: 24 May 1923 – Frank Aiken orders the Anti-Treaty fighters to “dump their arms” and return home.\n\nÉamon de Valera supports the order, issuing a statement to Anti-Treaty fighters; “Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic”. End of the war.\n\nToday in Irish History: 24 May 1798 – The first clashes of the United Irish Rebellion begins in Wexford and in Leinster just after dawn.\n\nThe Irish Rebellion of 1798 (Éirí Amach 1798), also known as the United Irishmen Rebellion (Éirí Amach na nÉireannach Aontaithe), was an uprising against British rule in Ireland lasting from May to September 1798.

Tara was chosen as it provided strategic control of road access to the capital Dublin and cultural significance as the former seat of the high kings of Ireland. Between 4,000-7,000 rebels gathered at the hill. There were incidents of violent encounters throughout the countryside as rallying rebels made their way to Tara from the outbreak of the rebellion on the 23rd to the day of the battle on the 26th.\n\nPicking up yeomanry reinforcements along the way, the combined fencible, yeoman and militia force formed up at the bottom of the hill to attack the rebels who had established a large camp on the hill. The lack of any cannon or cavalry placed the rebels at a great disadvantage despite their numbers. Disciplined Volley fire and flanking cavalry action combined with withering grape shot delivered from a 6 pounder cannon drove the rebels to within graveyard walls at the summit. There at dusk, the rebels made their last stand on the hill until a final grenadier assault finished them.\n\nThe loss to the fencibles yeomen and militia was minimal. However rebel casualties have estimates running from several hundred to several thousand dead and many wounded. Many bodies were removed during the night of the 26th and 350 dead were counted still lying on the battlefield the following day. Witnesses to the burial recollect many more bodies of those rebels who died of their wounds during the night being collected from the surrounding countryside in carts. It was noted by the witnesses that the bodies were universally disembowelled by the victors. The dead are buried in a mass grave marked by the Lia Fail standing stone which was moved to mark the burial site. The defeat effectively ended the United Irishmens rising in Meath."
