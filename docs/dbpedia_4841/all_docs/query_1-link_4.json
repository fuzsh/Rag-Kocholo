        "text": "For other uses, see Cahill (disambiguation).\n\nCahill ( , or ) is a name of Irish origin. It is the anglicised version of the Gaelic \"Ó Cathail\" meaning \"descendant of Cathal\".\n\n\"Cathal\" consists of two parts: \"cath\" means battle; the second could be \"val\" (rule), so that the name as a whole meant \"battle ruler\" or \"strong in battle\",[1][2][3] or it could be \"all\" (great), so that the name as a whole meant \"great warrior\".[4][5]\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.
