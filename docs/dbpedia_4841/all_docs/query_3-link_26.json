        "text": "Socceroo Tim Cahill made his first senior club appearance in Australian football on Wednesday night, coming on as 64th-minute substitute in Melbourne City’s 2-1 victory over Brisbane Strikers in the FFA Cup round of 16.\n\nThe 36-year-old, who drew a sellout 3,571 crowd to Perry Park in Brisbane, entered the fray to a rapturous ovation with the scores level at 1-1. Playing just behind striker Bruno Fornaroli, Cahill had his own effort on goal blocked in the 73rd minute before putting his hand up to take a penalty that came four minutes later, but skipper Fornaroli waved him away before netting his second spot-kick of the night.\n\nThe Strikers opened the scoring in the 34th minute when unmarked centre-back Greig Henslee turned home Hiroki Omori’s inswinging free-kick from six metres out. The National Premier League Queensland winners were full value for the lead after goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen had being called on to make stops from Omori and Rhys Meredith.\n\nThree minutes after his goal, Henslee undid his good work by chopping down Nick Fitzgerald in the penalty area to concede in the box and Fornaroli hit his penalty to the left of Sebastian Usai’s outstretched arm.\n\nThe second spot-kick was almost a carbon copy of the first with Bruce Kamau this time goal-bound before Jake Marshall, who had blocked Cahill’s effort minutes earlier, rashly brought down the winger. Last year’s A-League top scorer Fornaroli blasted the penalty down the middle of the goal to put his side through to the last eight.\n\nAlthough relieved at making the quarter finals, City’s defence will have worried John van ‘t Schip with balls played over the top of their defence consistently, causing difficulty throughout the night. It is no surprise City are likely to sign a defender as a marquee player before the A-League season starts in October.\n\nCahill played his part as an ambassador, signing numerous autographs before and after the match for the record crowd, the first of many contributions back following his part-FFA-funded estimated $4 million two-year deal with City.\n\n“It felt like I was starting my career again,” Cahill said. “I began my career playing in grounds like this. These guys were up for it; they can be proud at what they achieved – and so can City. It was a really good effort and [they are] a good footballing team.\n\n“This is amazing, it’s really good for this place and I’m really happy for them. This is what it’s all about to come to places like this and help fill the ground up and contribute for 30 minutes is nice. Obviously, I’d have liked to contribute a bit more on the pitch, but I’ve got a few games coming up with the Socceroos being involved in and we’ll see what happens with that,” Cahill said.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, FFA Cup holders Melbourne Victory needed a lone strike from goal king Besart Berisha to see off semi-professional side Hume City and advance to the quarter-finals. Victory were pushed to the limit in an at-times feisty affair at ABD Stadium in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, in a repeat of last season’s semi-final.\n\nBerisha netted from the penalty spot midway through the first half to extend his FFA Cup goalscoring record to 10 in as many matches. Victory were fortunate to be awarded the penalty as midfielder Fahid Ben Khalfallah went to ground easily after dribbling into the penalty area.\n\nMelbourne dominated possession with Socceroo midfield pair Oliver Bozanic and new signing James Troisi looking sharp, but Hume created several half-chances of their own. Kym Harris was denied a second-half equaliser for Hume after some desperate, last-gasp defending from Victory.\n\nOne-time Socceroo midfielder Carl Valeri, who missed much of last season through illness, didn’t take the field and is set for a stint on the sidelines after having his tonsils removed.\n\nCanberra Olympic ended the run of giant killers Redlands United, the Brisbane-based side who shocked Adelaide United in the previous round. Futsal international Angelo Konstantinou and prolific veteran striker Robbie Cattanach scored in a 2-0 win in the nation’s capital.\n\nBlacktown City are also through to the quarter-finals after easing to a comfortable 3-0 over fellow Sydney club Bonnyrigg White Eagles."
