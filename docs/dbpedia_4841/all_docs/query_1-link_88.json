        "text": "FORMER Shelbourne players who took part in the club’s 2004 Champions League adventure will take to the Tolka Park pitch again next week to help raise funds for a year-old Finglas baby suffering from a rare disorder.\n\nCian Oliver Byrne – a nephew of the late Ollie Byrne, the club’s former chief executive and majority shareholder – was born with a rare chromosome disorder called Cri Du Chat.\n\nThere’s no cure or specific treatment for the condition and Cian, who also has partial Down Syndrome, has difficulty swallowing meaning he’s constantly at risk of choking.\n\nCian has being fighting for life from the day he was born on June 30, 2013, and has been rightly described as\n\n“a little fighter\n\n? after beating the odds of survival several times over the last 13 months.\n\nHowever, he still requires constant round-the-clock attention and fundraisers such as the upcoming match at 8pm in Tolka Park next Wednesday (August 13) are needed to provide the nursing care he needs.\n\n“He underwent heart surgery recently but he’s doing well at the moment,\n\n? Cian’s aunt Lisa Kennedy Byrne told Northside People.\n\n“He’s had a couple of fights along the way and we nearly lost him in March.\n\n“But he’s a real little fighter and deserves every chance.\n\n?\n\nLisa admitted the struggle to provide care for Cian was getting harder but said the support the family were getting was helping keep their spirits up.\n\n“He’s getting bigger and he’s a strong little fellah,\n\n? Lisa continued.\n\n“It’s very hard on the family but he’s doing good.\n\n“The winter will be tough because that’s when most of the bugs and infections are around and any infection really knocks Cian for six.\n\n?\n\nA Facebook page was set up for Cian and has attracted over 10,000\n\n‘likes’ with messages of support constantly pouring in.\n\n“The support we are getting is absolutely amazing,\n\n? Lisa adds.\n\n“He’s followers all over the world now, from as far away as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and all those people are spearheading fundraising events over there.\n\n“We’ve had donations in from places like Lanzarote and New York, it’s just amazing.\n\n?\n\nNorthsiders are also showing their support, with numerous local fundraisers having already taken place and several more planned over the coming weeks.\n\nWednesday’s match at Tolka Park will feature many of the Shelbourne team who took came close to becoming the first League of Ireland side to make the Champions League groups stages.\n\nIn the First Qualifying Round they beat Icelandic side KR Reykjavik 2-2 on away goals before disposing of Croatians Hajduk Split 4-3 on aggregate after a memorable 2-0 Tolka Park thriller.\n\nIn the Third Qualifying Round, which would have brought them into the Champions League proper, they faced Deportivo La CoruÃ±a from Spain who beat them 3-0 after a credible 0-0 first leg draw in Dublin.\n\nBut the adventure wasn’t quite over as Shels had earned themselves a chance in the UEFA Cup where they faced tough French side Lille OSC. Another great performance earned the Dublin side a 2-2 draw in front of over 7,000 fans at Lansdowne Road but they were finally undone when they lost 0-2 in France.\n\nThe match in aid of the\n\n‘Care for Cian’ fund kicks-off at 8pm on Wednesday, August 13 and will include players from the 2004 campaign including: Dave Rogers; Owen Heary; Glen Fitzpatrick; Jim Crawford; Ollie Cahill; Stuart Byrne; Jason Byrne; Dean Delany; Jamie Harris and assistant manager Kevin Doherty.\n\nThe team will be managed by Pat Fenlon and will play against a Republic of Ireland over 40s side, managed by Shels first team coach, Mick Byrne.\n\nTickets are priced at e10 for adults, and e5 for students, children and OAPs. They are on sale from Tolka Park and can be purchased at the stadium on the night or beforehand online from tickets.ie."
