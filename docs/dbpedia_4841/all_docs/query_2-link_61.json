        "text": "On September 6, 2010, O.E. Owen, MD, 75 years old, having lived 55 years with type 1 diabetes, died from an intracranial hemorrhage after a fall in his house in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania. Dr Owen, who has been characterized as “one of a kind,” had an extraordinarily interesting and successful career.\n\nHe was born December 24, 1934 in Roswell, New Mexico, son of Omer and Ruthia Owen. His father, owner of a car repair garage, was a personal friend of the popular Country and Western singer, Lefty Frizzell, who was responsible for Ollie Owen's lifelong love of country and western music. In high school, O.E. Owen started boxing in 8th grade, became a New Mexico State Champion, and participated in the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions in Chicago in 1953. From 1953–1955 he attended the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque with a Ford Foundation Scholarship and earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in 1958 from the Central State College in Edmond, Oklahoma. During his college summer vacations, he worked on oil rigs throughout the Southwest and later frequently entertained his friends with colorful stories of his redneck days in the Colorado and Oklahoma oil fields.\n\nAfter college, O.E. Owen entered the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, CO, where he graduated first in his class and Summa Cum Laude in 1962. From 1962 to 1965, he was an Intern and Resident in Internal Medicine on the Osler Service of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, under the direction of A. McGehee Harvey, MD. From 1965–1968, he was a Research Fellow under the direction of George F. Cahill Jr, MD, at the Elliot P. Joslin Research Laboratories, Harvard Medical School, in Boston, Massachusetts. It was there that he, together with Dr Cahill, did the now classic work on ketone body metabolism. In a series of publications, several of which became citation classics, they were able to show that the human brain was able to use ketone bodies as fuel during starvation (1–4).\n\nIn 1968, Dr Owen moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he joined the Section of Metabolism at Temple University Hospital and became the first Program Director of the new NIH-sponsored General Clinical Research Center at Temple University School of Medicine. Over the next 2 decades, he built the Temple GCRC into a worldwide recognized center for research on human energy metabolism and diabetes. In addition, he served as Chairman of the Board of the Greater Philadelphia Chapter of the American Diabetes Association from 1979 to 1982. In 1989, Dr Owen became Professor and Chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Southern Illinois School of Medicine in Springfield, Illinois, where an annual O.E. Owen Diabetes Symposium has been held since 1995. He resigned from this position in 1996 and returned to Philadelphia where, for the next 6 years, he was a visiting Professor at the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research and a Physician on the Medical Staff of Lankenau Hospital.\n\nA prolific contributor to medical literature, Dr Owen published 103 peer-reviewed papers (21 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation) and 31 book chapters. He published his memoirs Searching for Medical Truths in 2006. Dr Owen received many honors and awards, including election to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society during his junior year in Medical School, election to the AOA Board of Directors (1993–1998), election as Chairman of the AOA Nominating Committee (1995) and as Chairman of the AOA Leaders in American Medicine Committee (1996–1998), as well as Vice President of the AOA (1997–1998). He was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation (Young Turks) in 1974, to the Association for American Physicians (Old Turks) in 1978, to the Clinical Interurban Club (1979), and to the American Clinical and Climatological Association in 1989. He received the George Morris Piersol Teaching and Research Scholar Award from the American College of Physicians and the Russell P. Moses Memorial Award for excellence in clinical teaching in 1975.\n\nHe was a member of the Philadelphia Country Club and the Merion Cricket Club and, until a few years before his death, played a very competitive game of squash. Dr Owen is survived by his wife Paula and his son Rodney in Scottsdale, Arizona; two daughters, Lydia Babich in Rhode Island and Michele Black in California; and 6 grandchildren."
