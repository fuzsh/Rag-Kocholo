        "meta_description": "Lynn - Beloved daughter, grand- and great-granddaughter, sister, niece, cousin, and friend, Stacey Creighan, 40, passed away on Saturday, October 23, 2021. She is survived by her parents, Robert and Lori-anne (Osgood) Creighan, and her brother, Robert Creighan, Jr. and his partner Mark Baldwin.   Stacey was born on August 10, 1981, in Salem, Massachusetts, and grew up in Lynn. She graduated from St. Pius V and Bishop Fenwick.   Stacey loved traveling. She spent a summer abroad in London and explored England, France, and Spain. She also trekked all over America, driving cross-country. But her favorite place was Sluice Pond, located steps from her childhood home in Lynn.   Stacey is also survived by aunts and uncles: Linda and Arthur Crist; Josie (Capobianco) Osgood and Steve Lightbown; David and Debora Osgood; Nancy Elizabeth and Paul Seaward; Kevin and Cathy Creighan; Jane and Al D’Addario; Danny Creighan; Patty Kausel; and Paula and James Fauci. She’s also survived by many cousins: Jenny Jalali; Nicholas Crist; Lexi (Michael Porambo); David Osgood Jr; Katy Osgood (Jon Armstrong); John Capobianco (Tricia); Jodi Capobianco (Davy Pruzansky); Elizabeth Osgood; Erin Osgood (Brian Schroy); Julia and Timothy Seaward; Lori, James Jr. , Danielle, Michelle, Luke, and Michael Fauci; and Julia and John Kausel.   Stacey is predeceased by her grandparents. Ralph H. Jr. and Nancy Osgood; Luke and Barbara Creighan; and great grandparents Gertrude (Keown) MacLean, Ralph H. Sr. and Elizabeth “GG” Osgood; her uncle Ralph H. Osgood, III; and her aunt and uncle, Patti and Jimmy Maguire.  Stacey Creighan had a good soul, a loving heart, and was happiest helping others. She will be sorely missed by all who knew her. (She would have hated us saying this) — To have known her is to love her, and to love her is to miss her.  ARRANGEMENTS: Stacey’s funeral services will be private, followed by a memorial service at a later date. Arrangements by the Conway Cahill-Brodeur Funeral Home, 82 Lynn St. , Peabody. Contributions may be made in her memory to Tunnels to Towers Foundation. For an online guestbook, please visit www. ccbfuneral. com.",
