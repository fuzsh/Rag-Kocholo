THE TIPPERARY WAR DEAD - C

THIS PAGE IS DEDICATED TO MEN AND WOMEN WITH CONNECTIONS TO COUNTY TIPPERARY, IRELAND, WHO DIED SERVING IN OR FOR THE MILITARY FORCES FIGHTING FOR EUROPEAN FREEDOM DURING 'THE GREAT WAR' 1914 - 1918

FURTHER DETAILS OF THOSE LISTED BELOW, AND OF OTHERS FROM COUNTY TIPPERARY CAN BE FOUND IN THE BOOK "A BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF TIPPERARY" by Martin O'Dwyer ISBN 0 9535634 0 5

NOTE: The table below may be used in several different ways to aid historical research. It is shown on this webpage in alphabetical order by surname in Column 1. However, if you copy the table to a text program on your computer, you can then manipulate the data to find out other things, e.g. putting Column 2 into ascending alphabetical order will show all the men who died from one town or village grouped together. Doing the same to column 6 will show all those of one regiment or corps grouped together, and similarly, Column 5 can be arranged to show all the men of the same rank grouped together and Column 3 will group by KiA, DoW and place of death. ( see explanation of abbreviations below). Column 4 will group all those who died on the same day. This last piece of information may be of help in finding out where a particular man died, as it can be compared with the dates of major battles as shown on the WW1 page of this Website via the World Index.
