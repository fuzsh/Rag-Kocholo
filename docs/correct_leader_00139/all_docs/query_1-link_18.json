        "text": "Global health security\n\nStrategic focus\n\nCDC partners with Cameroon's Ministry of Public Health (MOH) to build core public health capacities in disease surveillance, laboratory systems, emergency management, and workforce development. These efforts have strengthened health security in Cameroon, in the West-central African region, and globally.\n\nThe global health security portfolio includes efforts on:\n\nchildhood immunization\n\ninfluenza sentinel surveillance\n\ncapacity strengthening for anthrax and brucellosis surveillance and diagnostics\n\nborder health measures\n\nmaternal and perinatal death surveillance and response\n\ntechnical assistance for disease outbreaks, including COVID-19 and cholera\n\nemergency risk communication\n\nCDC also works with national partners to increase capacity for monkeypox laboratory diagnostics, viral genome sequencing, and ecological investigations.\n\nWorkforce development\n\nCDC supports training disease detectives through the Cameroon Field Epidemiology Training Program (CAFETP), established in 2010. The program consists of the two-year advanced FETP, nine-month intermediate FETP, and three-month frontline FETP. CAFETP is now training public health professionals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Central African Republic, and Chad.\n\nEmergency response\n\nCDC supported the establishment of Cameroon's Public Health Emergency Operations Center, which has responded to more than 20 health emergencies since 2016. Also, CDC has supported over 100 outbreak investigations in Cameroon, including COVID-19, mpox, cholera, measles, polio, and other threats since 2017.\n\nKey achievements\n\nMore than 1,700 CAFETP trainees from across 10 Cameroon regions.\n\nSupported the National Public Health Laboratory to train 25 laboratory staff from five regions to diagnose ten targeted priority diseases.\n\nConducted active border surveillance during the 2023 Marburg Disease Outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, which resulted in detecting over 40 alerts.\n\nPodcast ‎\n\nListen to how CDC leveraged global health programs to respond to COVID-19 in Cameroon.\n\nHIV and TB\n\nStrategic focus\n\nCDC has helped transform the HIV epidemic response in Cameroon. The progress made has positioned the country to be at the cusp of controlling the HIV epidemic.\n\nCDC partners with diverse stakeholders in Cameroon and uses data-driven approaches to:\n\nIdentify people living with HIV (PLHIV).\n\nLink people diagnosed with HIV to life-saving treatment.\n\nEnsure continuity of treatment to suppress HIV.\n\nCDC also supports Cameroon's MOH with:\n\nIntegrating HIV and TB services.\n\nScreening for TB among PLHIV.\n\nPreventing TB transmission in healthcare settings.\n\nIn 2024, CDC supported the launch of the National Pediatric Surge, which aims to identify thousands of children living with HIV in Cameroon and link them to life-saving treatment.\n\nKey achievements\n\nISO Accreditation‎\n\nCDC's efforts in Cameroon have resulted in five International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-15189 accredited laboratories—the first accredited laboratories in Central Africa and the first internationally certified blood bank in West and Central Africa.\n\nMore than 424,000 people living with HIV in Cameroon receive antiretroviral treatment.\n\nOver 840,000 pregnant women tested for HIV.\n\n97% of those who tested positive received treatment.\n\n98% of TB patients at PEPFAR-supported facilities have been tested for HIV.\n\nCDC played a pivotal role in establishing Cameroon’s National Public Health Laboratory in 2016.\n\nElectronic data systems inform clinical decisions and monitor patient outcomes in more than 340 health facilities across all ten regions."
