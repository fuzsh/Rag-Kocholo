        "text": "Germany is one of Cameroon's top three bilateral donors. Following temporary restrictions on Germany's cooperation with Cameroon imposed because of the way in which the country handled the domestic crisis and because of governance and human rights deficits, Germany has been increasing its cooperation with the country again since 2021. However, in the English-speaking regions, project implementation can only continue on a limited basis because of the tense security situation.\n\nIn May 2023, government negotiations with Cameroon were held in Berlin. At the negotiations, Germany committed 59 million euros in new funding for 2023 and 2024, of which 20 million euros was for Financial Cooperation and 39 million euros for Technical Cooperation. Another 6.6 million euros was committed in December 2023. The two sides also agreed on a debt swap for six million euros. This funding will benefit a reproductive health project. In addition to these funds, the German Development Ministry (BMZ) provided 9.4 million euros for Cameroon in 2023 via multi-country programmes and special initiatives.\n\nIn 2022, Germany had already made interim commitments of 8.45 million euros for bilateral projects. In that year, a total of 15.77 million euros was channelled to Cameroon via multi-country projects, regional projects and special initiatives.\n\nGermany's development cooperation with Cameroon currently addresses the following core areas:\n\nConserving nature and natural resources, protecting life on Earth\n\nTransformation of agricultural and food systems\n\nPeaceful and inclusive societies\n\nHealth, social protection and population dynamics\n\nAt the 2023 government negotiations, the two sides agreed that they would concentrate their cooperation on three core areas in future.\n\nCameroon is also benefiting from various regional programmes under German development cooperation. For example, the BMZ supports the Central African Forests Commission (COMIFAC) and works together with the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). Some projects under the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI) are also starting in Cameroon. They are co-financed by the BMZ."
