It rules on the constitutionality of laws. This regulatory organ oversees the functioning of institutions.

The Constitutional Council proclaims the results of these various elections.\n\nThe eleven members of the institution are appointed for six years eventually renewable. Appointed by the Head of State, they are designated according to Section 51, as follows:\n\n- Three members including the President of the council by the President of the Republic;\n\n- Three by the Speaker of the National Assembly with the bureau’s approval;\n\n- Three by the Chairman of the Senate with bureau's approval;\n\n- And two by the Supreme Magistracy Council."
