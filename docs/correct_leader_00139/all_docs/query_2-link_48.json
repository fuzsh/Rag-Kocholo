        "text": "In its “Vision 2035” strategy, Cameroon has adopted the goal of becoming an emerging economy by 2035. In November 2021, the country also adopted a new national development strategy. It envisages a surge in industrial development by 2030, based mainly on domestic products and creating many jobs.\n\nThe government is committed to the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the African Union's Agenda 2063. However, in practice, sustainable development approaches are only being applied to a limited extent. Overall, the Cameroonian government's practical efforts for development are not living up to the ambitious goals it has adopted. Accordingly, the latest Sustainable Development Report does not note any progress on most Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWithin a region that is fragile overall and characterised by military coups and increasing anti-Western sentiment, Cameroon is one of the relatively stable countries. However, conflicts in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest Regions and in the Far North Region are posing a threat to this stability. This is compounded by the uncertainty over who will succeed President Biya, a question that must be expected to arise in the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to United Nations figures, there are about 2.2 million displaced people in Cameroon. It is estimated that nearly one million people from conflict regions have been internally displaced. Only 500,000 of them have so far been able to return home.\n\nIn addition, there are about half a million refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from the Central African Republic and Nigeria. Meeting their needs is presenting local communities with great challenges. Over four million of the country's approximately 28 million people are themselves in need of humanitarian assistance (see also Social situation).\n\nIn the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest Regions, separatist groups have been fighting since 2016 for a greater say in decision-making and for the areas to form an independent country, the “Republic of Ambazonia”. In the last few years, the conflict has claimed more than 6,000 lives. It is being exacerbated by criminal players who are using the power vacuum for their own ends. The protracted nature of the conflict, grave human rights violations committed by both sides, and the poor humanitarian situation are putting strain on social and political cohesion between the two regions and the central government.\n\nThe government under President Biya launched a “Major National Dialogue” in 2019, took a few significant initial steps towards decentralisation and announced the reconstruction of infrastructure. However, Biya has rejected the idea of returning to a federal system that would give far more decision-making powers to the regions. At present, there are no grounds for expecting a political solution to the conflict. Mediation efforts by third countries have failed. Due to the high level of military expenditure, sectors that would be important for national development continue to be underfunded."
