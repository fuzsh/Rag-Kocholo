Climate catastrophe is deepening. Poverty and inequality are rife. Mistrust and division are pulling people apart. The Sustainable Development Goals are dramatically off-track. And developing countries are left without the support they need to invest in their people.”\n\nMr. Guterres urged everyone not to lose sight of the collective objective of a more peaceful and sustainable world.\n\nHe acknowledged the leadership of Assembly President Francis, adding that like him, president-elect Yang will also play an important role."
