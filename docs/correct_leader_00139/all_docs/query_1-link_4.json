        "text": "The Republic of Cameroon is a decentralized unitary state.[1]\n\nState power\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Republic of Cameroon, the President of the Republic and the Parliament exercise 'State power' as per Article 4 of the constitution of Cameroon.[2]\n\nExecutive power\n\n[edit]\n\n'Executive power' is vested in the President and the Government.\n\nThe president\n\n[edit]\n\nA presidential election determines the President of the Republic.

The Parliament has legislative power in matters relating to (a) The fundamental rights, guarantees and obligations of the citizen; (b) The status of persons and property ownership system; (c) The political, administrative and judicial organization; (d) The following financial and patrimonial matters; (e) Programming the objectives of economic and social action; and (f) The system of education in the country – Article 26.

Such ordinances shall be tabled before the bureau of the National Assembly and the Senate for purposes of ratification within the time-limit laid down by enabling law.\n\nPublic administration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe numerous administrations existing in Cameroon can be seen as the government in charge of the policy of the nation within the framework of their respective duties.\n\nMinistry of Social Affairs: Following decree n°75/467 of June 28, 1975, the Social Affairs Department is established as a Ministry in its own rights. The Ministry of Social Affairs is organised by Decree n°75/723 of November 1975. Madam Delphine TSANGA, economist, is at the Head of this ministerial department, there are central and external services. There were two Departments: Private Assistance Department and Social Development Department. External services were Provincial Services of Social Affairs, Divisional Sectors of Social Affairs, and Social Posts. Decree n°77/495 of December 7, 1977 fixes of functioning conditions and creation of Private Social Structures (OSP). Decree n°78/056 of February 23, 1978, creates the National Rehabilitation Centre for Persons with Disabilities initiated by the Canadian Cardinal Paul Emile LEGER. Decree n°80/199 of June 9, 1980 creates the National School of Social Workers (ENAAS) of Yaounde. A small innovation intervenes in 1981, with Decree n°81/295 of July 23, creating within the Ministry of Social Affairs, a Women Empowerment and Social Defence Service.\n\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development\n\nThe Superior State Audit: ministry under the Presidency of the Republic\n\nMinister-Delegate at the Presidency in charge of Relations with the Assemblies\n\nMinistry of Commerce 4.7. Ministry of Communication\n\nMinistry of Culture\n\nMinistry of Defense\n\nMinistry under the Presidency of the Republic\n\nMinistry of Urban development and Housing\n\nMinistry of Economy and Finance\n\nMinistry of Finance (Cameroon)\n\nMinistry of Basic Education\n\nMinistry of Livestock Fisheries and Animal Industries\n\nMinistry of Employment & Vocational Training\n\nMinistry of Energy & Water Resources\n\nMinistry Of Secondary Education\n\nMinistry of Secondary and Superior Education\n\nMinistry of Environment & Nature Protection in Cameroon\n\nMinistry of the Public Service and Administrative Reforms\n\nMinistry of Forestry & Wildlife\n\nMinistry of Industry, Mines & Technological Development\n\nMinistry of planning, Programming and Regional Development\n\nMinistry of Small & Medium Size Enterprises, Social Economy & Handicraft\n\nMinistry of Posts & Telecommunications\n\nMinistry of Women Empowerment and the Family\n\nMinistry of Scientific Research & Innovation\n\nMinister of External Relations\n\nMinistry of Public Health\n\nMinistry of Sports and Physical Education\n\nMinistry of Tourism\n\nMinistry of Transport\n\nMinistry of Labor & Social Security\n\nMinistry of Public Works\n\nMinistry of Justice\n\nMinistry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization: Preparation, implementation and assessment of Government policy on territorial administration, decentralization and civil protection is within the framework of the duties assigned to the MINATD.[4] It is the duty of the MINATD to organize the territorial administrative units, chiefdoms and external services, to organize national and local elections and referendums in accordance with constitutional laws. By assuring the preparation and implementation of the laws and regulations and the maintenance of public order, the MINATD acts as a guarantor public liberties- associations and political organizations; religious organizations; non-profit movements, organizations and associations. Performing as a guarantor of the state powers, the MINATD oversees the activities of regional and local authorities. The MINATD is also in charge of preventing and managing the risks related to natural disasters.\n\nRegional government\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginality, the Republic of Cameroon was divided into provinces. The appellation \"regions\" came with the Amendment of the Constitution of 1996. The regions are the primary subdivisions in Cameroon. Here are the ten regions of Cameroon: Adamawa, Center, East, Far North, North-West, West, South, South-West,Littoral and North .\n\nConsidering the fact that the Law No. 96-06 of 18 January 1996 did not yet came into force, a region is under the authority of a Governor appointed by Presidential Decree meaning that the governor represents the authority of the President of the Republic and implicitly upholds the authority of the State in the province/region where he is appointed. Each Ministers assigns to each region a competent provincial delegate in charge of implementing the policy of the state in his province within the framework of the responsibility assigned to their respective Ministerial department. For example, the Minister of Public Health appoints to each province a Delegate in charge of Public Health to coordinate the duty assigned to the Ministry of Public Health at the regional level.[citation needed] It is the same for all the Ministerial departments. With the collaboration of provincial delegates, the governor covers the general administration and co-ordination of the work of the civil service in the province, with the exception of those aspects that fall within the remit of the Minister for justice. And we also have to notice that all local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets. As the country is subdivided into regions, the regions are subdivided into departments.\n\nDepartment administration\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are 58 departments in Cameroon. As in the French model, the capital of a department is called \"prefecture\" (préfecture in the French language). A department is under the authority of a Prefect (in French préfet) appointed by Presidential decree meaning that the prefect upholds both the authority of the State and implicitly the authority of the region at the local level. Each Ministerial department appoints to each department a departmental delegate in charge of preparing and implementing the policy of the state in his department within the framework of their respective agenda. For example, the Minister of Secondary Education appoints to each department a delegate in charge of secondary education to coordinate the duty assigned to the Ministry of Secondary Education at the local level.[citation needed]\n\nDistrict administration\n\n[edit]\n\nWe have to acknowledge the fact that the French's word arrondissement is translated \"district\" in English pose a problem in the context of the subdivisions in Cameroon. Departments are subdivided in \"arrondissements\", and \"arrondissements\" are further subdivided in districts. As it is the case for the French's administrative division, the capital of an arrondissement is a sub prefecture (translate in French sous-préfecture). An arrondissement is under the authority of a sub-prefect (translate sous-préfet in the French language) who upheld the authority of the state in the arrondissement.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
