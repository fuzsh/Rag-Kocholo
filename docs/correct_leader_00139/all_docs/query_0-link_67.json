        "text": "On March 26, 2021, President Xi Jinping exchanged messages of congratulations with Cameroonian President Paul Biya on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cameroon.\n\nXi Jinping pointed out in his message that over the past half a century since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China and Cameroon have been standing side by side through thick and thin, and the traditional friendship between the two countries has grown stronger with time. In recent years, the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries have enjoyed a strong momentum of development with deepening political mutual trust and fruitful results in practical cooperation. The two countries have understood and supported each other on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns, and have coordinated closely in international and regional affairs. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been working with Cameroon and other African countries to help and support each other in fighting the pandemic, which demonstrated the brotherly friendship between China and Africa that shares weal and woe.\n\nXi Jinping emphasized that I attach great importance to the development of China-Cameroon relations, and I am willing to work with President Paul Biya to take the opportunity of the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic ties to implement the outcomes of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and enhance the joint efforts to build the Belt and Road, so as to benefit the two countries and peoples and to make positive contributions to forging a closer China-Africa community with a shared future.\n\nIn his message, Paul Biya said for a long time, with the efforts of the two heads of state, the friendly cooperative relations between Cameroon and China, which are mutually-beneficial and win-win, have been fruitful and continuously consolidated. The fruits of cooperation between the two countries have made great contributions to enhancing the Cameroonian people's well-being and helping Cameroon achieve national modernization. The far-sighted Chinese leadership and the diligent and brave Chinese people have made China a significant force on the international stage. What is even more encouraging is that China has been attaching importance to South-South cooperation and supporting African countries in achieving development and vitalization. On the occasion of grand celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, he wishes Cameroon-China cooperation becoming closer with a broader prospect to better benefit the two peoples."
