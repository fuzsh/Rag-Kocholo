We hold training sessions to strengthen their knowledge of the law and improve respect for humanitarian principles.\n\nWe help restore family links between people separated by armed violence and strive to find missing people. We visit people deprived of their freedom to ensure that their treatment and living conditions comply with internationally recognized standards.\n\nAs well as delivering emergency relief to meet the immediate needs of vulnerable people and communities, we help provide more sustainable solutions by improving their access to health care and drinking water and by supporting livestock breeders and farmers."
