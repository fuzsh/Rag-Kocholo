        "text": "YAOUNDE (ILO News) - The Director-General of the ILO, Gilbert F. Houngbo, paid an official visit to Cameroon from 12 to 15 May 2024. During his visit, he was received by several senior Cameroonian government officials, including the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Employment and Vocational Training, and the Minister of the Economy, Planning and Regional Development.\n\nMr Houngbo also had fruitful discussions with the representatives of United Nations system agencies, as well as with representatives of employers‘ and workers’ organisations. Discussions focused mainly on youth employment and resolving the mismatch between the skills produced by education systems and the needs of the labour market.\n\nThe highlight of the visit was an audience with the Prime Minister, Joseph Dione Ngute. During this meeting, the tripartite constituents and the Director of the ILO Yaoundé Office signed Cameroon's Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP).\n\n\"I am pleased to have witnessed the signing of the new Decent Work Country Programme, which demonstrates the commitment of our tripartite partners in Cameroon to employment, social protection and social dialogue,\" said the Director-General.\n\nMr Houngbo welcomed Cameroon's commitment to social protection, particularly with regard to ensuring universal health insurance coverage. \"During my first day in Yaoundé, I had several fruitful discussions with government ministers on the strong cooperation between the ILO and Cameroon. We discussed key issues, including child labour, the financing of social protection, the promotion of youth entrepreneurship and the promotion of apprenticeships\", he stressed.\n\nMr Houngbo also gave a lecture at the Cameroon Institute of International Relations (IRIC) on the future of work in the context of the Global Coalition for Social Justice, and visited ILO colleagues at the national office to encourage them to continue their support of the ILO's constituents in promoting decent work and social justice in the country.\n\nOn 15 May 2024, the Director-General of the ILO was again received by the Prime Minister, this time on behalf of the President of the Republic, thus consolidating relations between the ILO and Cameroon to achieve social justice and decent work for all.\n\nThis visit strengthens the cooperation between Cameroon and the ILO, highlighting joint efforts to promote decent work, extend social protection and effective social dialogue."
