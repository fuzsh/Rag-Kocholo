        "text": "Constitutional framework\n\nCameroon’s constitution has undergone various developments since the country achieved independence. The constitution of 1961 linked the states of West Cameroon and East Cameroon together into a federation. The constitution of 1972, subsequently revised, replaced the federation with a centralized government. The constitutional revision of 1996 provided for the establishment of a bicameral legislature—although a second body was not created until 2013—and, to a minor extent, decentralized the government.\n\nCountry Facts\n\nCapital, Population, Government...\n\nCountry Facts\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Cameroon\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Joseph Dion Ngute\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 27,334,000\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: Paul Biya\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nunitary multiparty republic with two legislative houses (Senate [100]1; National Assembly [180])\n\nExecutive powers are conferred upon the president, who serves as chief of state and head of the armed forces; the president also appoints a prime minister and a cabinet. The president is elected to a seven-year term by direct universal suffrage. A controversial constitutional amendment promulgated in 2008 eliminated presidential term limits and granted immunity to the country’s president for any acts committed in an official capacity during the president’s time in office.\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 18, 2024, 1:49 AM ET (Deutsche Welle)\n\nCameroon opposition doubts reasons for election postponement\n\nJuly 17, 2024, 4:45 AM ET (The Guardian)\n\nKidnappings soar in central Africa’s ‘triangle of death’\n\nJuly 11, 2024, 4:55 AM ET (Nation.Africa)\n\nHow Paul Biya, 91, plans to stay in power\n\nJuly 10, 2024, 5:06 AM ET (Voice of America)\n\nCameroon's opposition says postponing elections is president's ploy to stay leader for life\n\nJuly 7, 2024, 1:17 AM ET (Rappler)\n\nLatvia faces Brazil for Olympic berth after beating Cameroon in FIBA OQT semis\n\nLegislative power is vested in the bicameral parliament, consisting of the National Assembly and the Senate. The 180 members of the National Assembly are directly elected for five-year terms. The Senate is composed of 100 members. Each of the country’s 10 regions is represented by 10 senators, 7 of whom are indirectly elected while the remaining 3 are appointed by the president. Senators serve five-year terms.\n\nLocal government\n\nFor administrative purposes, Cameroon is divided into 10 régions. Prior to 2008, the country was divided into 10 provinces (coterminous with the current régions), which were administered by a governor appointed by the president. The 1996 constitutional revision addressed, albeit nominally, popular demand for decentralization of the government; that was the impetus for provinces being replaced in 2008 by régions, which were supposed to be administered by councils composed of indirectly elected members and representatives of traditional leaders. However, the regional councils were not in place at the time the régions were introduced and more than a decade later still had not been implemented.\n\nJustice\n\nAlthough the constitution calls for an independent court system, in practice the president has a powerful role in judicial appointments. The legal system of Cameroon consists of the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, and tribunals. Among its functions, the Supreme Court passes judgment on appeals concerning administrative actions of the government and decisions of the Courts of Appeal and the lower courts. The Court of Impeachment passes judgment on the president in case of high treason and on other government ministers in the event of a plot against the government. The Constitutional Council is concerned with matters pertaining to the constitution.\n\nPolitical process\n\nCameroon became a de facto one-party state in 1966 and was dominated by the Cameroon National Union, a union of six political parties; it was renamed the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement in 1985. After significant political unrest and a number of violent clashes, a constitutional amendment in 1990 established a multiparty system. Other major political parties include the National Union for Democracy and Progress, the Cameroon Democratic Union, and the Social Democratic Front.\n\nThe constitution guarantees every Cameroonian the right of participation in the government of the country, whether directly or by way of elected officials. Women have held a number of posts within the government, including seats in the National Assembly and the cabinet and positions in some of the major political parties. Although all ethnic groups have the right to participate in the political process, the constitution does not guarantee that they are represented proportionally in government positions; historically, the Beti have held a disproportionately high number of government posts.\n\nSecurity\n\nCameroon’s defense forces are composed of an army, a navy and naval infantry, an air force, and a paramilitary force. The army is the largest contingent, although the paramilitary force is also sizable. Service in the military is voluntary, and recruits are eligible at age 18. Cameroon maintains a bilateral defense agreement with France."
