        "text": "Parliament name Parlement - Parliament Structure of parliament Bicameral Chamber name AssemblÃ©e nationale - National Assembly Related chamber (for bicameral parliaments) SÃ©nat - Senate / Senate POLITICAL SYSTEM Type of political regime semi-presidential Notes The executive is separate from the legislature. The executive has two heads, the Head of State and the Head of the executive (Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). Head of the executive President of the Republic Notes The President of the Republic is the Head of State. He or she defines national policy. The Head of the executive implements that policy. Method for appointing the executive The President is directly elected by universal suffrage from the majority of all those voting (Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). The President takes office on taking the oath of office before the Cameroon people in the presence of both Chambers assembled. The oath is administered by the President of the National Assembly. The President nominates the Prime Minister and, on his or her advice, appoints the other members of Government (Article 10, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). Term of office of the executive and coincidence with the term of the legislature The President is elected for seven years and may be re-elected once only. His or her term of office does not coincide with the term of office of the deputies of the National Assembly, which is for five years. Incompatibility of the functions of member of the executive and member of Parliament Yes The office of a member of Government, or similar office, is incompatible with that of a parliamentary mandate, the chairmanship of an executive body or an Assembly or a decentralised territorial body, or of any professional representational function (Article 13 of the Constitution). Dissolution of Parliament Yes\n\nCircumstances\n\nIn the case of a serious crisis, or in case of grave need, the President can request the National Assembly to enact a law proroguing or shortening its term of office.\n\nModalities\n\nFor any such dissolution request the President shall consult with the Presidents of the Constitutional Council and the bureaus of the National Assembly and the Senate. Elections for a new Assembly shall take place at least 40 days and not more than 60 days after such prorogation or shortening of the Assembly's term of office (Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Constitution). In the last 11 years (1990 - 2000) the parliament was prorogued once and dissolved once. ACCOUNTABILITY Accountability of Government to Parliament Yes Government is collectively responsible to the National Assembly. Modalities of oversight\n\nOral and written questions of parliamentarians\n\nGovernment accountability to the parliament is brought into play by questions put to ministers.\n\nGovernment reports to Parliament\n\nNot available Measures\n\nVote of confidence on Government programs and/or legislative proposals\n\nThe Prime Minister can, after consultation with the Council of Ministers, call for a vote of confidence in the Government by the National Assembly on any government programme or on a general statement of policy (Article 34, paragraph 2 of the Constitution). The vote cannot be taken until at least 48 hours have elapsed from the motion being tabled. A vote of no confidence requires an absolute majority of parliamentarians. The only votes counted are those against a vote of confidence. The Prime Minister can also, after consultation with the Council of Ministers, associate a vote of confidence in the Government by the National Assembly with the vote on the text of a bill. In such a case, said text is considered adopted unless an explicit motion of no confidence is tabled within 24 hours (Article 34, paragraph 4 of the Constitution). Motions of censure and votes of no confidence (sub-report)\n\nCircumstances\n\nThe National Assembly may call Government to account by a vote of no confidence (Article 34, paragraph 3 of the Constitution). The circumstances for tabling such motions are very wide.\n\nModalites\n\nIn order to be valid, a motion of no confidence must be signed by at least one third of the members of the National Assembly. The vote may not be taken until at least 48 hours have elapsed since the motion was tabled. A motion of no confidence is adopted with a majority of two thirds of the members of the Assembly. The only votes counted are those in favour of the motion. If a motion of no confidence is defeated, signatories may not table a new motion before one year has elapsed.\n\nConsequences\n\nWhen the National Assembly adopts a motion of censure or refuses a vote of confidence in Government, the Prime Minister must submit the Government's resignation to the President. Over the last 11 years (1990 - 2000), numerous motions of censure have been tabled but none has succeeded in obtaining at least one third of the votes of the members of the Assembly. The motions tabled have come exclusively from opposition parties. Dismissal and/or impeachment of Government and other public officials (sub-report)\n\nCircumstances and persons concerned\n\nThe National Assembly does not have the right of dismissal or impeachment. However, the President, the Head of the executive, other members of Government and holders of similar offices, together with those high-ranking government officials in receipt of powers delegated under Articles 10 and 12 of the Constitution, can be judged by the High Court of Justice.\n\nModalites and procedure\n\nThe High Court of Justice is competent to judge any acts committed in office by the President in the case of high treason, or in the case of any plot against the security of the state, or any acts by any other persons concerned in the case of a plot against the security of the state (Article 53, paragraph 1 of the Constitution).\n\nConsequences\n\nNo accusations have been brought over the last 11 years (1990-2000).\n\nHave these procedures been applied?\n\nOVERSIGHT OVER THE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION Oversight over the actions of the Government administration Yes Government can be called to report to the National Assembly on its actions, notably in plenary session. Means and modalities of oversight\n\nHearings in Committees\n\nThe National Assembly exercises oversight over Government through hearings in committees.\n\nCommittees of inquiry and missions to Government departments\n\nThe National Assembly exercises oversight over Government by the creation of committees of inquiry.\n\nOral and written questions of parliamentarians\n\nThe National Assembly exercises oversight over Government by written and oral questions (Article 35, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). In the course of each ordinary sitting one session per week is reserved particularly for members' questions and Government's replies. Oral and written questions are put to ministers on matters relating to their respective departments. Questions may not deal with personal problems and ministers are required to reply. Neither written nor oral questions may give rise to a debate in the National Assembly.\n\nRole of Parliament in the appointment of senior Government officials\n\nNot applicable\n\nActivity reports of the Government administration and of public services or establishments\n\nNot applicable\n\nRepresentation of Parliament in governing bodies of the Government administration\n\nThe National Assembly is not represented in the governing bodies of certain administrative departments or public bodies. Deputies may, however, serve on the boards of directors of certain national enterprises. Existence of an ombudsman No\n\nMethod for appointing the executive\n\nNot applicable\n\nRelationship to Parliament\n\nNot applicable BUDGETARY OVERSIGHT Consultation of Parliament in the preparation of the national budget No The National Assembly is not consulted in the preparation of the budget. Modalities of oversight\n\nExamination of the budget / finance act by Parliament\n\nBudgetary oversight is brought into play when the finance bill is scrutinised.\n\nReports on the budget / finance act by Committees\n\nReports from the finance committee can be considered as a means of parliamentary oversight. Fields overseen\n\nDefence budget\n\nThe National Assembly exercises oversight over all public funds.\n\nBudget of special departments\n\nThe National Assembly does not exercise oversight over funds allocated to special services.\n\nRole of Parliament in national development plans\n\nWith regards to development plans the National Assembly's role is purely consultative. The state's role is central in managing the economy and negotiating with financing bodies. Parliament's deadline for the examination and adoption of the budget / finance act The National Assembly has one month to examine the national budget in the regular budgetary session. Consequences of failure by Parliament to adopt the budget / finance act If the budget has not been adopted before the end of the financial year the President may repeat the budget appropriations for the previous year by twelfths until the new budget is adopted (Article 16, paragraph b of the Constitution). Budgetary autonomy of Parliament Yes The National Assembly's budgetary autonomy is brought into play through the adoption of its budget in specialised committee and by the implementation of the same without Government oversight. OVERSIGHT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET AND OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING Evaluation of Government spending Parliament approves Government expenditures annually No Not applicable Parliamentary oversight of public companies No Not available Modalities of oversight\n\nBody for auditing the Government's books and method for appointing\n\nThe National Assembly does not appoint the public finance audit body.\n\nReports of the public auditor's office\n\nThe public finance audit body is not required to report to the National Assembly.\n\nSpecialised committee\n\nGovernment reports on public spending as required through oral and written questions put during parliamentary sittings. The Constitution does not grant to the National Assembly any other means of oversight other than those already mentioned above. OVERSIGHT OVER FOREIGN POLICY Foreign Relations Committee (sub-report)\n\nFunctions of the Committee\n\nThe National Assembly exercises oversight over foreign policy through the committee on foreign affairs.\n\nPowers of the Committee\n\nForeign policy oversight is brought into play by the scrutiny of draft bills carried out by this committee.\n\nComposition of the Committee\n\nThe composition of the committee reflects the numerical strength of each party in the National Assembly.\n\nBilateral visits of Parliament, inter-parliamentary conferences and information missions abroad\n\nInter-parliamentary conferences, and the contacts to which these give rise, constitute an indirect means of exercising oversight over foreign policy.\n\nPlenary debates on foreign policy issues\n\nThe National Assembly exercises oversight over foreign policy by organising plenary debates on foreign policy matters. Involvement of Parliament\n\nParticipation of Parliament in inter-governmental meetings\n\nThe National Assembly is not called on to participate in, and does not send delegations to, intergovernmental meetings.\n\nModalities and procedures for ratifying international treaties and agreements (sub-report)\n\nThe National Assembly has no means of requesting that a treaty be laid before it for ratification. Nonetheless it may, through written and oral questions, require justifications from Government. The President negotiates and ratifies treaties and international agreements. Treaties and international agreements having legal consequences (as defined under Article 26 of the Constitution), must be submitted to the National Assembly prior to ratification in the form of a bill. Treaties without legal consequences are signed directly by the President. The Constitutional Council may be petitioned in the case of any conflict of competence. If the Constitutional Council declares that a treaty or international agreement contains a clause contrary to the Constitution any approval in the form of a bill, or ratification by signature of the treaty or agreement, may only take place after the Constitution has been revised.

There is no national defence committee. STATE OF EMERGENCY Circumstances The President of the Republic may, where circumstances so warrant, declare by decree a state of emergency which shall confer upon him or her such special powers as may be provided for by law (Article 9 of the Constitution). In the event of a serious threat to the nation's territorial integrity or to its existence, its independence or institutions, the President of the Republic may declare a state of siege by decree and take any measures as he or she may deem necessary. He or she shall inform the nation of his or her decision by message. Can parliament take the initiative to declare a state of emergency No Consequences of a state of emergency for Parliament The National Assembly has no role to play in this area. It nevertheless continues to sit and function. VERIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY AND THE APPLICATION OF LAWS Modalities of oversight\n\nBody ruling on the constitutionality of laws\n\nState Court The Constitutional Council has jurisdiction in matters pertaining to the Constitution. It rules on the constitutionality of laws. It is the body that regulates the functioning of state institutions (Article 46 of the Constitution).\n\nMeans and procedures\n\nThe Constitutional Council gives final rulings on (i) the constitutionality of laws, treaties and international agreements; (ii) the constitutionality of the standing orders of the National Assembly and the Senate prior to their implementation with regard to their conformity to the Constitution; and (iii) conflict of powers between state institutions; between the state and the regions, and between the regions themselves (Article 47, paragraph 2 of the Constitution). Matters may be referred to the Constitutional Council by the President of the Republic, the President of the National Assembly, the President of the Senate, one third of the members of the National Assembly or one third of the senators. Presidents of regional executives may refer matters to the Constitutional Council whenever the interests of their regions are at stake. Evaluation of laws No Not applicable"
