        "text": "Cameroon is a lower-middle-income country endowed with rich natural resources, including oil and gas, mineral ores, high-value species of timber, and agricultural products, such as coffee, cotton, and cocoa. The country is also dominated by a strong central government. Cameroon currently faces a multitude of crises including: spillover violence from Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province in its northern regions, which are its poorest and most impacted by climate change; hosting the largest refugee population from the Central African Republic (CAR) in its East and Adamawa regions; ongoing insurgency in its English-speaking Northwest and Southwest Regions; and the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country’s economy and public healthcare system.\n\nUSAID upgraded its presence in Cameroon to a Limited Presence Country in 2020. We work with a range of partners – local, international, multilateral – to deliver critical services to the Cameroonian people. Our work improves healthcare, boosts business opportunities, and provides emergency humanitarian assistance, and works to combat violent extremism."
