        "text": "Presidency\n\nBiya was reelected as president in elections held in 1984 and 1988, in which he was the sole candidate. Belying this perceived level of unanimous support was an unsuccessful coup attempt in April 1984; there were suspicions that Ahidjo or his supporters had been involved. The next year, at the UNC’s party congress, Biya dissolved the party and from its remains created the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM; Rassemblement Démocratique de Peuple Camerounais [RDPC]), of which he was also the head.\n\nAlthough Biya supported democratic changes when he first took office, he reversed course after the 1984 coup attempt. In the face of domestic and international pressure, Biya eventually yielded and allowed some democratic and constitutional reforms in the 1990s, though Biya and the CPDM managed to consolidate power and remain dominant. The country held its first multiparty elections 1992. Biya won reelection that year and in the subsequent elections held in 1997 and 2004 (the presidential term had been extended, first to five years, and then to seven years), although some level of irregularity was noted in all the elections. After a consultative process that began in 1993, a new constitution was implemented in 1996. A controversial constitutional amendment passed in April 2008 abolished presidential term limits and provided Biya with the option to stand in future presidential elections, which he did. He was reelected in 2011 and 2018, with opposition parties again complaining of electoral irregularities and unsuccessfully challenging the results.\n\nBiya inherited a troubled economy, one that was hit by a drop in global commodity prices in the 1980s and further hampered by corruption and economic mismanagement. In 1987 he accepted the need to adhere to an International Monetary Fund structural adjustment program, but, despite efforts to reform the economy, Cameroon entered into a severe recession. Corruption remained prevalent, hindering the country’s development, and in 2006 Biya established an anti-corruption commission by presidential decree. In the following years, the commission had some success, but corruption remained a prevalent problem.\n\nDuring Biya’s long presidency, the country faced several crises and security challenges, such as those that arose in the 1990s and 2000s from the dispute with neighbouring Nigeria over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula, which both countries claimed. The International Court of Justice awarded the peninsula to Cameroon in 2002, and Nigeria completed the handover process in the following years. In 2013 the violence of Boko Haram, a militant group that originated in Nigeria, began to spill over Cameroon’s northern border more frequently. Biya met with leaders from the affected countries to discuss strategy in 2014, and the next year a regional task force comprising Cameroon, Nigeria, and other countries was formed to combat the militant group.\n\nOne of the most concerning issues during Biya’s decades of rule has been the growing discontent among the country’s English-speaking minority in the southwest, who felt marginalized by the French-speaking majority. The multiparty political environment introduced in the 1990s was conducive to Anglophones who wanted to organize and advocate for change, with some calling for a return to the federal form of government that the country had in the years after independence, while extremists called for secession. The tensions between the English-speakers and the government continued into the 2000s, occasionally boiling over, such as in late 2016 when strikes and demonstrations held in the Anglophone community to protest the government’s marginalization of English-speakers were met with repressive measures from the government, further stoking unrest. Though Biya followed up with some conciliatory gestures, it was not enough. In 2017 some Anglophone separatist leaders declared the country’s two English-speaking regions to be independent, calling the new state Ambazonia; this led to open armed conflict between the separatists and government forces that continued on for years. Biya launched a national dialogue in 2019 in an attempt to find an end to the turmoil; out of this event came the creation of a special status designation for the two English-speaking regions, which would ostensibly provide them with a higher level of autonomy. The new designation was criticized, however, for having been formulated without input from the Anglophone community and for the limited level of autonomy it would actually provide. Much of the Anglophone community was not satisfied with it, and fighting continued."
