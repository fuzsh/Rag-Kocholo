        "text": "When to File for TPS\n\nIf you currently have TPS under Cameroon’s designation and would like to keep your TPS, you must re-register during the 60-day period that runs from Oct. 10, 2023 through Dec. 11, 2023. We encourage you to re-register as soon as possible within the 60-day re-registration period.\n\nIf you are filing an initial application for TPS under Cameroon’s redesignation, effective Dec. 8, 2023, you must register during the registration period that runs from Oct. 10, 2023, through Dec. 7, 2025. We encourage you to register as soon as possible within the 18-month registration period.\n\nIf we approve a pending Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, we will grant TPS through June 7, 2025. Similarly, if we approve a pending TPS-related Form I-765, we will issue a new Employment Authorization Document (EAD) that will be valid through the same date.\n\nWhere to File\n\nIf you are applying for TPS Cameroon, you may file Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, online. When filing an initial TPS application, you can also request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by submitting a completed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, online with your Form I-821.\n\nFile Online\n\nIf you are filing a paper initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, or if you are filing for a replacement EAD for TPS you were already granted, send your TPS package to the appropriate address in the table below.\n\nIf you are using...Mail to...the U.S. Postal Service (USPS)USCIS\n\nAttn: TPS Cameroon\n\nP.O. Box 4091\n\nCarol Stream, IL 60197-4091FedEx, UPS, or DHL deliveries:USCIS\n\nAttn: TPS Cameroon (Box 4091)\n\n2500 Westfield Drive\n\nElgin, IL 60124-7836\n\nIf we approve your TPS registration application and you filed Form I-765 and paid the fee for an EAD (or if we approved your fee waiver request), we will issue you an EAD with an expiration date of June 7, 2025.\n\nFor more information on TPS eligibility requirements, what to file, and step-by-step instructions on submitting a re-registration or initial TPS application package, go to the TPS webpage. You can find the filing fees for TPS related forms on our Fee Schedule page.\n\nAutomatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\n\nUSCIS has automatically extended through Dec. 7, 2024, the validity of EADs issued with a Dec. 7, 2023, expiration date under the TPS designation of Cameroon. If your EAD is covered through this automatic extension, you may continue to use your existing EAD through Dec. 7, 2024, as evidence you are authorized to work.\n\nTo prove that you are authorized to work in the United States, you may show the following documentation to your employer. Government agencies may also accept these documents if they need to determine your immigration status:\n\nYour TPS-related EAD with a Dec. 7, 2023, expiration date; and\n\nA copy of the Federal Register notice announcing the automatic extension.\n\nYour employer may rely on the Federal Register notice as evidence of the continuing validity of your EAD. Go to the Documentation Employers May Accept and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries May Present as Evidence of Employment Eligibility page for more information.\n\nIf we approve your TPS re-registration application and you paid the fee for a new EAD (or if we approved your fee waiver request), we will issue you a new EAD with the expiration date of June 7, 2025.\n\nOther Immigration Options\n\nYou might be eligible for other immigration options listed on the Explore My Options page.\n\nTo apply for lawful permanent resident status (a Green Card), you must be eligible under 1 of the categories listed on the Green Card Eligibility Categories page. When you find a category that may fit your situation, click on the link provided to get information on eligibility requirements, how to apply, and whether your family members can also apply with you.\n\nNote on Seeking Asylum: Being granted and maintaining TPS until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of the 1-year filing deadline. In other words, having TPS status “stops the clock” on the requirement to file for asylum within 1 year of arriving in the United States, if the 1-year clock has not already expired. See 8 CFR 208.4(a)(5)(iv).\n\nAvoid Scams\n\nPlease be aware that some unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file TPS forms. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to obtain such forms; however, all USCIS forms are free for download from the USCIS website at uscis.gov/forms. We want to ensure that all potential TPS applicants know how to obtain legitimate, accurate legal advice and assistance. A list of accredited representatives is available on the USCIS website on the Find Legal Services webpage.\n\nWe do not want you to become a victim of an immigration scam. If you need legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. Only an attorney or an accredited representative working for a Department of Justice (DOJ) recognized organization can give you legal advice. Visit the Avoid Scams page for information and resources.\n\nRelated Links"
