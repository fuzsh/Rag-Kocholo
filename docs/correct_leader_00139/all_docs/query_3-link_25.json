        "text": "The president is the head of state and is directly elected to a seven-year term in a single voting round and may serve an unlimited number of terms. President Paul Biya won a seventh term in the October 2018 presidential election, with 71 percent of the vote in a process characterized by low turnout and a lack of genuine democratic competition. Maurice Kamto of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) came in second with 14 percent of the vote. The election was marred by irregularities including unsigned results sheets. Intimidation and fear in the Anglophone regions prevented many from casting their votes.\n\nThe upper chamber of Cameroon’s bicameral Parliament is the 100-member Senate. Senators serve five-year terms; 70 are elected through indirect suffrage by regional councils, while the remaining 30 are appointed by the president. The 180 members of the National Assembly, the lower chamber, are directly elected in multimember constituencies to five-year terms.\n\nLong-delayed National Assembly elections were finally held in Cameroon in February 2020, together with municipal elections. The CRM refused to put up candidates, though the Social Democratic Front (SDF) participated, as did the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP), which is allied with the CPDM. The CPDM retained its majority, winning 139 of the 167 seats contested. The Constitutional Council invalidated the results in 11 constituencies of the Anglophone Northwest and Southwest Regions, where boycotts and ongoing tensions resulted in low turnout. Reruns took place in March 2020, and the incumbent CPDM won all 13 of the seats at stake.\n\nThe first-ever regional elections took place in December 2020, despite calls for a boycott by opposition parties and threats by separatist groups in the Anglophone regions to arrest would-be voters. Biya’s CPDM won the majority.\n\nPartisan election management bodies compromise the independence of Cameroon’s electoral system. The majority of the 11 members of the Constitutional Council, which validates election results and adjudicates election disputes, have ties to the ruling party. The council rejected all 18 petitions to cancel the presidential election results filed by opposition parties in 2018, despite credible allegations of fraud and intimidation.\n\nThe Elections Cameroon (ELECAM) electoral body was created in 2006 to address concerns about the fair management of previous elections. However, President Biya chooses its members, and CPDM partisans have historically dominated the body. Police shut down a 2021 effort by the leaders of seven opposition parties to draft a new electoral code.\n\nThe ability to organize in political groups and their freedom to operate is severely limited, and opposition leaders risk arrest and imprisonment. Opposition rallies are frequently prohibited by the government, while CPDM marches in support of President Biya are authorized.\n\nIn 2022, several CRM party leaders arrested in September 2020 after a peaceful protest were still facing proceedings at a military tribunal, with potential sentences ranging from five to seven years.\n\nDespite the existence of hundreds of registered political parties, Cameroon remains a one-party state. The organizational advantages of the ruling party’s long incumbency, its dominance over electoral bodies, and its superior access to media and public resources disadvantage opposition candidates. Frequent harassment, intimidation, and arrests of opposition figures further reduce the ability of opposition parties to gain power through elections.\n\nOpposition parties—including the two largest, the SDF and CRM—remain highly fragmented, preventing any one of them from becoming a viable alternative to the ruling CPDM. In June 2022, an internal reshuffle carried out by the SDF chairman created two opposing internal groups. Within the CRM, one of the leaders and main activists, Alex Nguepi, was excluded from the party following an internal election.\n\nCorruption is systemic and bribery is commonplace in all sectors, despite anticorruption initiatives and the presence of the National Anticorruption Commission (CONAC). Several former high-level government officials are in prison for corruption allegations, though these efforts are often perceived as moves by President Biya to sideline political adversaries. Individuals convicted of crimes have been released by seemingly arbitrary clemency decisions, and corruption charges at times are similarly dropped despite evidence of wrongdoing. In 2022, proceedings against the director of the Autonomous Port of Douala were suspended, reportedly at the president’s behest, despite clear irregularities in his awarding of service contracts.\n\nDecisions, especially those made by presidential decree, are often adopted without public consultation. Cameroon lacks an access to information law, and it is difficult to access government documents or statistics. The websites of most ministries do not provide substantial information. Despite the existence of a minister dedicated to public procurement, the process is typically opaque. A constitutional article regarding asset declaration by the president and senior officials offers no means to assess their wealth when entering and leaving office.\n\nIn 2022, financial authorities opened investigations into alleged embezzlement of funds set aside to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon. The development came after the International Monetary Fund (IMF), citing alleged mismanagement, called for an independent audit of the agency in charge of pandemic spending.\n\nIndependent and investigative journalists continue to face serious pressure including risk of attack or detention. In March 2022, journalist Paul Chouta, known as a strong critic of the government, was kidnapped by unidentified assailants who assaulted him and left him with severe injuries to his face and ear.\n\nThe National Communication Council (CNC), a media regulatory body, has a history of harassing journalists. Throughout 2022, several journalists received sanctions including temporary suspensions ordered by the president of the CNC. State-run Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) has been criticized for favoring the CPDM in its coverage. The government continued to suppress media coverage of the Anglophone crisis in 2022.\n\nThere are no legal restrictions on academic freedom, but state security informants operate on university campuses and academics can face negative repercussions for criticizing the government or discussing its political opponents. In September 2021, military security forces detained and tortured Fridolin Nke, a university professor who had recently published a book criticizing the Biya government. In April 2022, Messanga Nyamding, a professor, faced threats after he publicly accused several high-level officials of embezzling of public funds. Nyamding first lost his academic position at the International Relations Institute Cameroon (IRIC), and was expelled from the CPDM, of which he had been a member.\n\nAcademic freedom continues to be severely impacted by the crisis in the Anglophone regions, with separatists enforcing a boycott of schools and carrying out acts of violence against teachers and students.\n\nThe influence of civil society is weak, with many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) relying entirely on foreign assistance, and others coopted by the regime. Anglophone activists have faced harassment, violence, and arrest for their activities. LGBT+ organizations have also been targeted by law enforcement.\n\nThe government has restricted the work of international NGOs, denying them access to the country. This includes even medical operations such as Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which was forced to withdraw from the Northwest Region in August 2021. In 2022, the Ministry of Defense issued a press release on “false allegations” of a report published by Human Rights Watch that August. The report provided evidence of the execution of civilians, looting, arbitrary detention, and other severe abuses committed by security forces between April and June 2022 in the Northwest Region.\n\nTrade unions and collective bargaining are legally permitted, although unions are still subject to numerous restrictions when exercising their rights. Strikes are theoretically permitted, but in practice, the government has used force to disrupt them. In March 2022, a general strike of high school teachers to call for improved working conditions was heavily restricted by the police.\n\nDue process rights are poorly upheld. Lengthy pretrial detentions are commonplace. Civilians accused of terrorism are frequently not afforded the right to a fair trial. French legal norms are regularly imposed upon Cameroonians in Anglophone regions. Acts of violence against lawyers continue to be reported. The government has also invoked charges of terrorism and insurrection against opposition leaders and separatist supporters, and they are often detained in the absence of due process and without realistic avenues for challenging their detention.\n\nIn 2022, active conflicts involving both Boko Haram and Anglophone separatists continued to threaten the security of millions of people and have forced large numbers of people to flee their homes. As of December 2022, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that there were over 600,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Northwest and Southwest Regions. Likewise, the Far North Region crisis has internally displaced some 385,000 people as of December 2022.\n\nPrison conditions are harsh, marked by extreme overcrowding and poor sanitation. Inmates often face a lack of access to food, water, and medical care. Police brutality remains a problem, including the abuse and torture of detainees.\n\nDiscrimination against Anglophone Cameroonians and individuals from certain ethnic groups, including the Bamiléké, is common. The government imposes the French language in Anglophone regions, and Anglophone Cameroonians are frequently denied senior jobs in the civil service.\n\nDiscrimination against LGBT+ individuals is rife, and violence against them is common. The penal code forbids same-sex relations; those convicted face prison sentences as long as five years. A cybercrime law punishes those who solicit same-sex relations online with two-year prison sentences. People are frequently prosecuted under draconian anti-LGBT+ laws on suspicion that they are gay.\n\nFree movement is severely limited in parts of the Far North Region due to Boko Haram activity, and in the two Anglophone regions due to the ongoing crisis. The latter has exacted a heavy toll on children, many of whom have been deprived of their right to education. Thousands of schools have closed, and attacks and kidnappings of students and teachers were frequent throughout 2022. In April, separatists launched an attack at the University of Bamenda’s campus in Bambili, in the Northwest Region, injuring at least five people.\n\nThe constitution guarantees equal rights to men and women, but traditional legal values and practices often take precedence, and do not always provide women with full rights. The Boko Haram conflict has exacerbated the already prevalent practice of child marriage and the sexual abuse of minors in the Far North Region. Customary law can allow rapists to escape punishment if they marry their victim. Despite laws guaranteeing equal rights to men and women to file for divorce, in practice courts often disadvantage women by making proceedings prohibitively expensive or lengthy. Cases of domestic violence and rape are widespread, and perpetrators are rarely prosecuted."
