        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nFrench Cameroon became independent in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon. The following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge with the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In 1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary state, the United Republic of Cameroon. The country has generally enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n6 00 N, 12 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 475,440 sq km\n\nland: 472,710 sq km\n\nwater: 2,730 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 55\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than California; about four times the size of Pennsylvania\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 5,018 km\n\nborder countries (6): Central African Republic 901 km, Chad 1116 km, Republic of the Congo 494 km, Equatorial Guinea 183 km, Gabon 349 km, Nigeria 1975 km\n\nCoastline\n\n402 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24nm\n\nClimate\n\nvaries with terrain, from tropical along coast to semiarid and hot in north\n\nTerrain\n\ndiverse, with coastal plain in southwest, dissected plateau in center, mountains in west, plains in north\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 667 m\n\nlowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m\n\nhighest point: Fako on Mont Cameroun 4,045 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, bauxite, iron ore, timber, hydropower\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 20.6% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 13.1% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 3.3% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 4.2% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 41.7% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 37.7% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n290 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation concentrated in the west and north, with the interior of the country sparsely populated\n\nNatural hazards\n\nvolcanic activity with periodic releases of poisonous gases from Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun volcanoes volcanism: Mt.

Fertility is falling but remains at a high level, especially among poor, rural, and uneducated women, in part because of inadequate access to contraception. Life expectancy remains low at about 55 years due to the prevalence of HIV and AIDs and an elevated maternal mortality rate, which has remained high since 1990. Cameroon, particularly the northern region, is vulnerable to food insecurity largely because of government mismanagement, corruption, high production costs, inadequate infrastructure, and natural disasters. Despite economic growth in some regions, poverty is on the rise, and is most prevalent in rural areas, which are especially affected by a shortage of jobs, declining incomes, poor school and health care infrastructure, and a lack of clean water and sanitation. Underinvestment in social safety nets and ineffective public financial management also contribute to Cameroon’s high rate of poverty.International migration has been driven by unemployment (including fewer government jobs), poverty, the search for educational opportunities, and corruption. The US and Europe are preferred destinations, but, with tighter immigration restrictions in these countries, young Cameroonians are increasingly turning to neighboring states, such as Gabon and Nigeria, South Africa, other parts of Africa, and the Near and Far East. Cameroon’s limited resources make it dependent on UN support to host more than 320,000 refugees and asylum seekers as of September 2017. These refugees and asylum seekers are primarily from the Central African Republic and more recently Nigeria.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 42.15%(male 5,445,142 /female 5,362,166)\n\n15-24 years: 19.6%(male 2,524,031 /female 2,502,072)\n\n25-54 years: 31.03%(male 4,001,963 /female 3,954,258)\n\n55-64 years: 3.99%(male 499,101 /female 524,288)\n\n65 years and over: 3.23%(male 384,845 /female 443,099) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 85.9 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 80 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 5.9 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 17 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 18.6 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 18.5 years\n\nfemale: 18.7 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 208\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n2.54% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 20\n\nBirth rate\n\n35 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 21\n\nDeath rate\n\n9.4 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 49\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.1 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 103\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation concentrated in the west and north, with the interior of the country sparsely populated\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 57% of total population(2019)\n\nrate of urbanization: 3.63% annual rate of change(2015-20 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas -

Oil remains Cameroon’s main export commodity, and despite falling global oil prices, still accounts for nearly 40% of exports. Cameroon’s economy suffers from factors that often impact underdeveloped countries, such as stagnant per capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, endemic corruption, continuing inefficiencies of a large parastatal system in key sectors, and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise.Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The IMF continues to press for economic reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. The Government of Cameroon provides subsidies for electricity, food, and fuel that have strained the federal budget and diverted funds from education, healthcare, and infrastructure projects, as low oil prices have led to lower revenues.Cameroon devotes significant resources to several large infrastructure projects currently under construction, including a deep seaport in Kribi and the Lom Pangar Hydropower Project. Cameroon’s energy sector continues to diversify, recently opening a natural gas-powered electricity generating plant. Cameroon continues to seek foreign investment to improve its inadequate infrastructure, create jobs, and improve its economic footprint, but its unfavorable business environment remains a significant deterrent to foreign investment.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$89.54 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$86.47 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$82.63 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 88\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$34.99 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n3.5% (2017 est.)\n\n4.6% (2016 est.)\n\n5.7% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 98\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$3,700 (2017 est.)\n\n$3,700 (2016 est.)\n\n$3,600 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 182\n\nGross national saving\n\n25.5% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n25.2% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n23.9% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 56\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 66.3% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 11.8% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 21.6% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: -0.3% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 21.6% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -20.9% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 16.7% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 26.5% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 56.8% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncoffee, cocoa, cotton, rubber, bananas, oilseed, grains, cassava (manioc, tapioca);
