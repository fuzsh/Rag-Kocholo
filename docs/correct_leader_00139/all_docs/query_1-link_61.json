(6,13,14) Children are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation, domestic work, and forced labor in mining and agriculture. (13,14) Parents often entrust children to intermediaries who promise to take them to urban centers for education or improved living conditions, and these children are often subjected to exploitation. (13) In the artisanal mining sector in eastern Cameroon, children are subjected to hazardous conditions, including frequent collapses of open pit mines and use of dangerous chemicals including mercury. (6-8,15)\n\nSeveral crises within Cameroon and in neighboring countries—including the Central African Republic refugee crisis; the Lake Chad Basin Crisis impacting Cameroon's Far North as well as Nigeria, Niger, and Chad; and the separatist crisis in Cameroon's Northwest and Southwest regions—have heightened children’s vulnerability. (16) As of December 2022, 3.9 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance, and Cameroon was home to over 1 million displaced people and nearly half a million refugees, primarily from Nigeria and the Central African Republic. Disruptions to family livelihoods as a result of these crises place children at greater risk of human trafficking and child labor. (16) In 2022, in the Far North Region near Lake Chad, non-state armed group Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad (JAS) recruited and used children. (6) English-speaking separatist groups in the Northwest and Southwest regions have recruited and used children as fighters. (6) Anecdotal evidence suggests that some community neighborhood watch groups in the Far North Region, known as Vigilance Committees, may have incorporated children into their ranks. Vigilance Committees carry out reconnaissance operations against Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa, and some receive non-lethal material support from the government. (6,13,14,17)\n\nOngoing violence in Cameroon and the surrounding regions has significantly disrupted children's schooling, making both Cameroonian and refugee children vulnerable to exploitation. In prior years, armed separatist groups have violently enforced school boycotts, leading to long-term disruptions of education for children in the Northwest and Southwest regions. (18) While calls for school boycotts subsided in 2022, separatists continued to attack and kidnap students and teachers who attended classes, often releasing them only after collecting ransom. (6,18) In addition, armed separatists have occupied and used schools as camps and bases for their operations. (18) According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 3,223 of 5,724 schools in the Northwest and Southwest regions are non-functional. (6) In the Far North Region, terrorist activity by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa has also disrupted children’s schooling, and at least 66 schools remained closed in the aftermath of attacks. (6) Research suggests that roughly 36 percent of primary school students lack birth certificates, which are required to register for end‐of‐course examinations to enter secondary school. (3,19) Many public officials in the Northwest and Southwest regions have fled since the beginning of the crisis in those regions, reducing access to birth registration services. In addition, many internally displaced children lost their birth certificates as they fled the violence and have been unable to participate in end-of-course examinations. (3) The law guarantees free education up to the age of 12, but in practice, additional school fees are often charged and families must pay the cost of books and uniforms, which is a significant barrier for many families. (6,19,20) Further barriers to education include inadequate school facility infrastructure, including toilets and sanitation facilities, and an insufficient number of teachers. (6,21)\n\nCameroon has ratified all key international conventions concerning child labor (Table 3).\n\nTable 3. Ratification of International Conventions on Child LaborConventionRatificationILO C. 138, Minimum Age✓ILO C. 182, Worst Forms of Child Labor✓UN CRC✓UN CRC Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict✓UN CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography✓Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons✓\n\nThe government has established laws and regulations related to child labor (Table 4). However, gaps exist in Cameroon’s legal framework to adequately protect children from the worst forms of child labor, including the lack of prohibition of the use of children in illicit activities.\n\nTable 4.

This standard makes children ages 13 and 14 vulnerable to child labor because they are not required to attend school but are not legally permitted to work. (29,30) In addition, the Decree on the Organization of Public Schools provides for free schooling only through primary school, but basic education is a total of 9 years and includes 3 years of lower secondary school. The failure to provide for complete free basic education may increase the risk of children's involvement in the worst forms of child labor. (31) Human trafficking provisions do not meet international standards because they require threats, the use of force, or coercion to be established for the crime of child trafficking, and individuals ages 16 to 18 are not considered children for the purposes of trafficking in persons provisions. (24,25) In addition, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children under age 18 are not comprehensive because work at dangerous heights and underwater is not prohibited. (23,34)\n\nThe government has established institutional mechanisms for the enforcement of laws and regulations on child labor (Table 5). However, gaps exist within the operations of enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate enforcement of their child labor laws.\n\nTable 5. Agencies Responsible for Child Labor Law EnforcementOrganization/AgencyRole & ActivitiesMinistry of Labor and Social Security (MINLSS)Enforces labor laws, including those related to child labor, and promotes decent working conditions. (35)Ministry of Justice (MOJ)Prosecutes cases referred by the General Delegate for National Security or the Ministry of Defense’s National Gendarmerie (SED), and contributes to investigations, as appropriate. (3,35)Criminal Law Enforcement AgenciesThe General Delegate for National Security operates as the national police service of Cameroon, enforces laws against the worst forms of child labor, and investigates violations in urban areas. (3,35) Through its Special Vice Squad, it investigates cases of human trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, and other forms of abuse against women and children. (3,35) The SED investigates cases of child trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation in both urban and rural areas before referring cases to MOJ for prosecution. (3,35) It also operates a reporting hotline for human trafficking cases. (3,35,36)\n\nLabor Law Enforcement\n\nIn 2022, labor law enforcement agencies in Cameroon took actions to address child labor (Table 6). However, gaps exist within the operations of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MINLSS) that may hinder adequate labor law enforcement, including insufficient financial resource allocation.\n\nTable 6.

(6) In September 2022, a government official in the East Region reported that officials from the Ministry of Social Affairs (MINAS) had identified 3,000 children engaged in child labor at 46 mining sites during the reporting year. (6) MINAS and the Ministry of Mines, Industries, and Technological Development carried out inspections at mining sites in the South Region and identified 10 children engaged in child labor. (6)\n\nResearch indicates that Cameroon does not have an adequate number of labor inspectors to carry out their mandated duties. (3,37) Labor inspectors do not conduct inspections in the informal sector, in which the majority of child labor occurs. (3,38) While the government did not provide for publication the labor inspectorate's funding, it reported that it allocated $167,000 to child labor prevention and elimination efforts, in comparison with $120,000 in 2021. (6) Despite this increase in funds, the labor inspectorate lacked sufficient resources, including transportation, to carry out its mission. (6) Government officials, journalists, and NGOs in the East Region indicated that labor inspections rarely took place, especially at rural mining sites at which children are known to work. (3,6) Although the government has not created a formal mechanism for filing and responding to complaints about child labor, cases of child labor can be reported directly to any of the institutions, including MINAS, MINLSS, the National Gendarmerie's State Defense Secretariat, and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). (6)\n\nCriminal Law Enforcement\n\nIn 2022, criminal law enforcement agencies in Cameroon took actions to address child labor (Table 7). However, gaps exist within the operations of enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate criminal law enforcement, including insufficient allocation of financial resources.\n\nTable 7. Criminal Law Enforcement Efforts Related to Child LaborOverview of Criminal Law Enforcement20212022Training for Criminal Investigators ProvidedYes (3)Yes (6)Number of Investigations0 (17)Unknown (6)Number of Prosecutions Initiated0 (17)Unknown (6)Number of Convictions0 (17)Unknown (6)Imposed Penalties for Violations Related to the Worst Forms of Child LaborNo (17)Unknown (6)Reciprocal Referral Mechanism Exists Between Criminal Authorities and Social ServicesYes (3)Yes (6)\n\nIn July 2022, the National Interpol Bureau coordinated with criminal law enforcement and social services agencies to identify Nigerian children in Cameroon who had been subjected to trafficking and forced labor in automobile shops in Cameroon. (6,39) In addition, MINAS inaugurated a government-sponsored anti-trafficking hotline, 1503, in cooperation with the IOM. The hotline allows real-time interaction with representatives from the police, gendarmerie, MOJ, and social and health services. (6) In May 2022, the government and the IOM held a workshop that trained 800 gendarmerie officers on trafficking in persons, case identification and investigation, and referral to social services and prosecution. (39) Law enforcement officers, however, did not receive training specifically addressing child labor, and criminal law enforcement agencies do not receive adequate funding to investigate the worst forms of child labor. (6,12,40) In 2013, MINAS and IOM developed the National Referral System and Standard Operating Procedures to coordinate the identification and assistance of human trafficking victims, including children found to be in the worst forms of child labor. Research shows no evidence of relevant stakeholders using this system during the reporting period. (6)"
