        "text": "Cameroon initiated its economic transformation process in the late 1980s, which was followed by political changes introduced in the early 1990s. Under the presidency of Ahmadou Ahidjo, advancements were made in agriculture, education, health care, and transportation. However, Ahidjo’s rule was characterized by repression in a highly centralized state, and he was perceived as showing preference toward his co-ethnics from northern Cameroon. The discovery of off-shore oil deposits in 1977 stimulated economic growth but also resulted in increased corruption and rent-seeking. The political transition from Ahidjo to Paul Biya was tumultuous, marked by an attempted coup in 1984 and an economic crisis. Despite Biya’s pledges of a “New Deal” and structural reforms, he heavily relied on his southern co-ethnics, who occupied prominent positions in the military, government, ruling party, and economy. This further strengthened corruption and resistance to democratic and economic reforms, leading to a severe economic crisis in Cameroon by the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1989, Cameroon entered into a structural adjustment loan agreement with international lenders, which included components such as banking sector reform, privatization, trade liberalization, and budgetary constraints. However, the pace of reform was slow, and the World Bank labeled Cameroon one of the most disappointing adjusters. Reforms gained momentum after 2000, with the privatization of state-owned enterprises and increased competition in the banking and telecommunications sectors. Cameroon qualified for the IMF’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), which significantly reduced its debt burden. The country made progress in stabilizing macroeconomic indicators and well-being measures. Nevertheless, international lenders noted continued resistance to reform, due to poor governance and pervasive corruption. Cameroon increasingly relied on non-concessional lending to finance infrastructure projects, while investments in human development declined.\n\nCameroon’s democratic transformation was also driven by the economic crisis of the 1980s. Similar to other African countries, civil society activism, mass protests, and international pressure compelled the regime to allow multiparty elections. Numerous parties emerged, mostly based on ethnic or regional support. However, attempts to pressure the regime to initiate constitutional reform before the elections failed, and the 1992 parliamentary and presidential elections were heavily manipulated to secure a narrow victory for the regime. Since then, the regime has marginalized the opposition, leading to a state of “electoral authoritarianism.” While there have been slight improvements in political rights and civil liberties, Biya will not allow a peaceful transition of power. In 2006, the regime launched Operation Sparrowhawk, a large-scale anti-corruption campaign used to target its political opponents. In 2008, the National Assembly abolished presidential term limits, resulting in major protests and state violence. In 2014, a broad anti-terror law was passed, granting the regime extensive discretion in defining crimes against the state and enabling the use of military tribunals to prosecute opponents. In 2018, Paul Biya won another disputed election, extending his 35-year tenure in office.\n\nCameroon has also faced significant armed challenges to state authority. Since 2009, the jihadist group Boko Haram has operated along the Cameroonian-Nigerian border in the Extreme North Region. Although the conflict has subsided from its peak in 2013/14, it has taken a significant toll. Since 2017, English-speaking regions have been embroiled in intense civil conflict driven by long-standing grievances concerning linguistic and cultural discrimination that emerged from the colonial period. The conflict escalated after peaceful civil society protests demanding redress were met with brutal state repression. Multiple armed groups are now fighting for what is known as “Ambazonian” independence. However, efforts at conflict resolution have been largely symbolic and have not led to substantial progress.\n\nCameroon initiated its economic transformation process in the late 1980s, which were followed by political changes introduced in the early 1990s.

Since 2009, the jihadist group Boko Haram has operated along the Cameroonian-Nigerian border in the Extreme North Region. Although the conflict has subsided from its peak in 2013–2014, it has taken a significant toll. Since 2017, English-speaking regions have been embroiled in intense civil conflict driven by long-standing grievances concerning linguistic and cultural discrimination that emerge from the colonial period. The conflict escalated after peaceful civil society protests demanding redress were met with brutal state repression. Multiple armed groups are now fighting for what is known as “Ambazonian” independence. However, efforts at conflict resolution have been largely symbolic and have not led to substantial progress.\n\nAn ongoing secessionist movement in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon (Northwest and Southwest Regions) significantly challenges the state’s monopoly on the use of force. In October 2017, the self-proclaimed Interim Government (IG) and the Ambazonian Governing Council (AGC) both claimed the region’s independence from Cameroon. These groups operate or coordinate the activities of several local militias engaged in insurgent activities against the government. Militant groups also target civilians perceived as cooperative with the government or unwilling to support insurgent activities, such as economic and political boycotts. Civilians are also frequently kidnapped for ransom as a way for groups to raise funds. Government-organized vigilante groups also target civilians suspected of cooperating or sympathizing with Ambazonian militant groups. Despite a prolonged counterinsurgency effort marshaled by the Cameroonian government, the crisis has not abated, and there are no sincere attempts at a cease-fire or reconciliation. Since 2017, over 700,000 people have been displaced, 60,000 have become refugees, and nearly 1.5 million people need humanitarian aid. Over 4,000 people have been killed in the crisis.\n\nThe state’s monopoly on the use of force is also challenged in the remote Extreme North Region. In recent years, the Islamist group Boko Haram has become increasingly active, partly because Cameroonian troops were redeployed in Anglophone regions. There are numerous self-defense vigilante groups with approximately 14,000 members who face criticism for their involvement in criminal activities such as cattle stealing, smuggling, and banditry. Similarly, the fallout from the conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) affects Cameroon’s eastern border. Armed groups participate in banditry and kidnapping, leading to frequent border shutdowns and limiting commerce. The proliferation of state-sponsored vigilante groups, especially in the Northwest and Southwest Regions, further indicates that the state’s military forces struggle to maintain a monopoly on the use of force.\n\nGovernment agencies and administration are present in most parts of the country but are largely ineffective in terms of performance or the provision of public services. In 2020, only 44.6% of the population had access to sanitation, while less than two-thirds had access to drinking water (65.7%) and electricity (64.7%).\n\nCameroon is divided into 10 regions, each governed by a presidentially appointed governor and an indirectly elected council. In response to demands for greater autonomy, in 2019, the Anglophone regions were granted a special status that entailed creating regional assemblies with greater powers than the regional councils in Francophone regions have. However, the regional assemblies are still very weak and under the control of appointed regional governors. The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions or departments, which are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers. Departments are divided into sub-divisions that correspond with 360 elected municipal councils and 14 unelected urban councils. Despite constitutional provisions, decentralization has only partially been implemented and has not translated into effective resource allocation (local councils do have the ability to levy local taxes and licensing fees). Consequently, access to public services remains limited, especially in rural areas where roughly half the population lives. Only half the country has access to improved sanitation facilities, and in rural areas, this rate is even lower at 20%. Roughly one-third of the country has no access to electricity or a safe water source.\n\nAll levels of government are eroded by corruption. It is common to find instances of petty corruption among the police, judiciary, and tax and customs officials. While several high-level government officials have been prosecuted for corruption, many have had charges dropped, and it is assumed that many elites in Cameroon are involved in large-scale corruption. The prosecution of high-level elites, which is referred to locally as Operation Sparrowhawk, is perceived as politically motivated against Biya’s rivals.\n\nWhile Cameroon has a nominally democratically elected legislature, regional and local councils, political power is heavily concentrated within the office of the presidency. The constitution of Cameroon provides the president with extensive formal powers; including the ability to singlehandedly appoint ministers and senior civil servants. Presidentially appointed governors, district officers, and sub-district officers wield significant political power that can override elected officials. Similarly, government-recognized traditional authorities are also dependent on the presidency and can exert influence over elected officials. The president is also the commander-in-chief of all military units and appoints the bulk of the senior officer core. Presidential power is amplified through ambiguously defined emergency powers. The president can suspend the rule of law for renewable three-month terms. These powers were expanded in 2014 with the passage of an anti-terror bill that defined terrorism as any activity that threatened the functioning of the state and allowed for certain crimes to be prosecuted in a military tribunal.\n\nThe president of Cameroon wields additional power over elected officials through his control of the ruling party and his centrality in the Cameroonian political system. Since the ruling Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM) dominates politics in Cameroon, it is the main avenue for most political ambition. As chairman of the party, the president essentially controls the political careers of the party and elected body members and can cultivate political loyalists. In addition, Paul Biya has been in power for over 35 years, and during that time he has created extensive patronage networks throughout the state apparatus and military. These patronage networks hold together a tenuous multiethnic coalition that generally benefits Biya’s southern co-ethnics. The question of succession has loomed large in Cameroon for many years, and many elites believe that a challenge to Biya’s authority would spell destabilization.\n\nIn principle, the constitution guarantees freedom of association and assembly, but in practice, these rights are significantly curtailed. Citizens can create associations and political parties. There are currently over 100 registered political parties and numerous civil society groups. However, in January 2017 the government used its authority under the 2014 anti-terror bill to ban two Anglophone advocacy groups: The Southern Cameroon National Council (SCNC) and the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium (CACSC).\n\nThe U.S. Department of State reports that the authorities typically cited security and health-related concerns as the basis for deciding to block assemblies, while pro-government groups were generally authorized to organize public demonstrations. For instance, as the U.S. Department of State also reported, a government official in Douala banned a three-day seminar hosted by Germany’s Friedrich Ebert Foundation in February 2021. The purpose of the seminar was to train members from opposition parties, the MRC and Social Democratic Front (SDF), in political communication.\n\nGenerally, assembly rights are more often constrained than association rights. Throughout the Anglophone Crisis, the government has resorted to severe violence to counter peaceful demonstrations and used emergency declarations to impose curfews. In other parts of Cameroon, political opposition has been increasingly limited. In the past, the state apparatus would deny permits for assemblies for unspecified reasons. More recently, the state has suppressed activities under the guise of the 2014 anti-terror bill and the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, defeated presidential contender Maurice Kamto and 350 of his supporters in the MRC party were detained for nearly 10 months on charges of insurrection.\n\nGenerally, human rights reports assess that the government does not always respect judicial independence and impartiality. The U.S. Department of State reports that, in some instances, the outcomes of trials appeared to be influenced by the government, especially in politically sensitive cases. Corrupt officials are only selectively prosecuted, although corruption or lack of professionalism on the part of judges is not specifically mentioned in human rights reports.\n\nThe judiciary in Cameroon is subordinate to the executive. While the constitution provides that judicial power is independent of legislative and executive power, the president is noted as the guarantor of the judiciary’s independence. The president is responsible for appointments, promotions and disciplinary sanctions under with advisement of the Higher Judicial Council. However, the president chairs that council and appoints most of its members and, therefore, wields ultimate control over the careers of justices and magistrates. While justices enjoy tenure, the president can use disciplinary standards to transfer justices, suppress promotions, temporarily dismiss justices and force early retirement. In addition, the judiciary is highly dependent on the executive for its financing and the executive can use decrees to delay salaries and allowances. In 2018, a Constitutional Council was finally formed, as required by the 1996 constitution. This council took responsibility for constitutional law away from the Supreme Court and is responsible for adjudicating disputes during presidential elections. The president appoints the Constitutional Council’s 11 members for renewable six-year terms. Clément Atangana, perceived as a CPDM insider, was appointed as the council’s president.\n\nThe independence of the judiciary is further undermined by the creation of special tribunal and court systems for the prosecution of financial crimes and terrorism. In 2011, a Special Criminal Court was created to deal with cases of public financial misappropriation. However, many view this court as a way for the ruling regime to punish political detractors and opponents. The 2014 anti-terror bill defines terrorism broadly to include any activity that threatens the territorial integrity of the nation and allows the government to fast-track prosecutions through a military tribunal rather than through the normal judicial system. Opponents of the bill note that these new powers have been used to stifle political dissent and freedom of expression, in particular over the government’s activities in northern Cameroon to combat Boko Haram and in Anglophone regions.\n\nPublic corruption is pervasive, and prosecutions against offenders are selective and typically politically motivated. Cameroon has had several institutions ostensibly created to fight corruption. In 2000 the National Anti-Corruption Observatory was founded but lacked a sustained financial basis or any independence from the executive. In 2006 the National-Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) replaced this institution, and in 2011 the Special Criminal Court was created to prosecute state officials involved in particularly egregious corruption scandals. In 2006 a coordinated anti-corruption effort known as “Operation Sparrowhawk” was launched and continues to operate to this day. Consequently, there have been several high-profile prosecutions of public officials including ministers, a former prime minister, and several managers of state-owned corporations.\n\nHowever, observers note that these anti-corruption drives are slow-moving, half-hearted and used to silence critics. For instance, in 2012 former Minister of Health Urbain Awono was sentenced to 20 years in prison for embezzlement in relation to a fake contract to deliver mosquito nets to hospitals. But Awono was arrested in 2008 following his criticism of the abolishment of presidential term limits. In 2012, Minister of Interior Marafa Hamidou Yaya was arrested and sentenced to 25 years in jail for his involvement in a scandal relating to the purchase of a new presidential jet (the Albatross Affair). The following year, former Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni was sentenced to 20 years in prison for embezzlement. Both Yaya and Inoni were seen as potential challengers to President Paul Biya. Despite these prosecutions, many other trials have stalled. For instance, the U.S. Department of State reported slow progress in the judicial proceedings that President Biya ordered in 2021 to investigate COVID-19 spending. This investigation, popularly known as “Covidgate,” revealed failings such as opacity in the awarding of contracts, overrunning allocated budgets, embezzlement and overbilling. In October 2022, an arrest warrant was issued for Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh, the secretary-general of the presidency, without any further developments before the end of the reporting period.\n\nCivil liberties are supposed to be guaranteed by constitutional procedures or the legal system. However, according to an assessment by the U.S. State Department, both options involve lengthy delays and there are problems enforcing civil court orders due to bureaucratic inefficiency and pervasive corruption. Many civil rights are frequently violated, especially those of political opponents. As in previous years, supporters of the Anglophone secessionist movement are increasingly targeted. Likewise, the government has declared states of emergency and imposed curfews in Anglophone areas and parts of northern Cameroon. It is common for the government to arbitrarily detain hundreds of people and hold them in administrative detentions for long periods. Prison conditions are notoriously horrible with overcrowding, subpar sanitation, food shortages, and systematic torture and rape. Moreover, the increased use of military tribunals under the guise of the 2014 anti-terror law has severely restricted civil rights.\n\nThere is also evidence of significant discrimination and unequal access to justice. Since 2011, the LGBTQ+ community has faced a series of trials because homosexuality is criminalized in Cameroon. Human Rights Watch has noted that Cameroon prosecutes homosexuality more aggressively than any country in the world. In 2021, it issued a report noting a significant increase in the arrest and abuse of LGBTQ+ people. Women also suffer from judicial and de facto discrimination in terms of inheritance, employment and property rights. Domestic violence is believed to be widespread, and female genital mutilation impacts approximately 1% of women. In northern Cameroon, the government continues to monitor Muslim places of worship and has banned full-face veils in the past.\n\nA number of societal interests are represented in Cameroon, but many are under-represented and those interests that are organized often suffer from weak membership and government intervention in their affairs. Formal workers can form trade unions, and the Confederation of Cameroon Trade Unions (CCTU) coordinates most union activity. However, membership remains low (~200,000) and most workers in Cameroon are in the under-represented informal sector. Moreover, the CCTU is heavily monitored, and the government has also encouraged the creation of rival organizations. During the period under review, the U.S. State Department reported that several strikes were announced. Some were called off after successful negotiations, others were carried out peacefully, and still others faced some degree of repression. Agricultural interests are organized into a number of cooperatives, but these are much stronger in West and Northwest Regions. The business community is organized into an employer’s association (GICAM), but its leadership has strong ties with the ruling party. Cameroon also has various elite associations based on villages and ethnic groups, which are often penetrated or co-opted by the ruling party. Women are relatively under-represented in Cameroon’s interest groups. Likewise, there is no real advocacy network for civic education, governance, or democracy.\n\nSince 2016, interest groups in Anglophone areas have come under intense repression. In January 2017, the government banned the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC), which advocated for the self-determination of Anglophones. The government also banned the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium (CACSC), which was an umbrella organization that brought together local legal groups, teacher unions, and student organizations to advocate for a redress of cultural and economic grievances.\n\nIn 2021, the U.S. State Department, citing the International Labor Organization (ILO), noted that the legal definition of terrorism in Cameroon could apply to acts related to the legitimate exercise of activities by trade unions or employers’ representatives.\n\nSocial capital in Cameroon is primarily bonding rather than bridging. Intercommunal trust is weak, as evident in the prevalence of ethnic associations and the importance of kinship in accessing the state’s hierarchy. These patterns often extend from rural to urban areas, where it is common to find village associations that cater to communal life. Likewise, perceptions of ethnic bias in the distribution of resources and accusations of under- or over-representation of certain groups in state structures and prestigious institutions permeate political discourse. Government narratives of national unity mask a strategy of ethnic balancing and divide-and-rule tactics that reinforce primary identities. These tendencies are exacerbated by persistent economic insecurity, which leads ordinary citizens to seek recourse through their primary identity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government encouraged citizens to contribute to a Health Solidarity Fund. The fund generated over $40 million in contributions (primarily from politicians and corporate entities), much of which was apparently embezzled.\n\nThe Francophone-Anglophone division is currently the most significant barrier to social capital, and the crisis has significantly exacerbated this tendency. Trust between French-speaking and English-speaking Cameroonians was already likely low before the conflict. But the spread of violence has had a twofold effect. First, it has widened the chasm between the two communities and allowed the government to portray Anglophones as terrorists who threaten to destabilize the country. Second, violence has also frayed bonds within the Anglophone community, as citizens have not been spared violence from separatists. There is frequent reporting of attacks against accused informants and regime collaborators (referred to as “black legs”). A similar dynamic eroded social capital in northern Cameroon at the peak of the war against Boko Haram.\n\nCameroon’s economic structure and performance do not meet the criteria for a socially responsible market democracy. Despite making significant improvements in poverty alleviation and human development since the 1990s, Cameroon still ranks low and improvement has stalled. Only one of the Millennium Development Goals – net school enrollment – has been met, and many have deteriorated since the start of the Anglophone Crisis. Although the situation had greatly improved by 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a lingering impact on small and medium-sized businesses, with female-led microenterprises being particularly affected.\n\nWith a per capita GDP of $1,666 in 2021, Cameroon is a lower middle-income country. Cameroon’s calculated HDI value of 0.576 now places it at the very low end of the “medium human development” spectrum, and the country is ranked 151 out of 189. Life expectancy is 61 years, and 47% of the population lives on less than $3.65 a day. This reflects only a slight improvement from levels in 2010. Likewise, there have been mixed improvements in other development indicators. Between 2020 and 2022, infant mortality remained high, at 55 per 1,000 births.\n\nIn addition, socioeconomic development is strongly influenced by persistent inequalities. More than 40% of the population resides in rural areas, with poverty highly concentrated in the rural Extreme North and East Regions. Moreover, approximately 33% of the urban population resides in slums with inadequate sanitation conditions. When accounting for inequality, Cameroon’s HDI value drops to 0.318, which is significantly below the average for Medium HDI countries (0.483). The most recent available data on the Gini coefficient dates back to 2014 and indicates a high level of income equality (46.6). Gender inequality is also a concern, particularly evident in disparities in education acquisition and labor force participation. Currently, Cameroon’s Gender Inequality Index stands at 0.56, slightly above the average for Medium HDI countries (0.489).\n\nCameroon adheres to the multilateral trade system, specifically the agreements of the WTO and the World Customs Office (WCO), as well as common trade rules set out by CEMAC. Additionally, Cameroon has signed several limited bilateral trade agreements and maintains a few Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) where certain trade barriers are reduced. Cameroon’s membership in the Commonwealth and CFA franc zone is also intended to facilitate trade.\n\nIn 2016, the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union took effect, granting Cameroon duty-free exports of most goods to Europe in exchange for a reduction in tariffs on EU imports. Furthermore, Cameroon ratified the 2020 African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTFA), although its implementation is pending. Conversely, in 2020, Cameroon lost its eligibility for preferential trade under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, due to human rights violations.\n\nDespite these structures, there are several formal and informal barriers to free trade. Complex and inefficient bureaucracies, particularly at Douala’s port, result in long delays and high costs. Cameroon adheres to CEMAC’s common external tariff, which establishes four tariff rates ranging from 10% on raw materials to 30% on certain consumer goods. However, this does not account for additional expenses incurred as a result of lengthy and sometimes expensive permit and registration processes. Certain products (such as specific textiles, meat, imported sugar alcohol and nicotine products) face issues with customs valuation practices, which do not always consider the transaction value but instead rely on a reference price set by the government. While there are no export subsidies or import quotas in place, the government enforces grade certifications for the export of coffee, cocoa, gold and diamonds. Additionally, the government prohibits the export of certain types of forestry products as a means of environmental conservation.\n\nEqual opportunity is partially achieved. Discrimination based on gender, ethnicity and political preference exists. Cameroon has ratified several international conventions and accords to eliminate discrimination against women. In practice, women continue to encounter barriers to economic, cultural, educational and policy participation. Women hold 25% of Senate and 34% of National Assembly seats, largely due to gender quotas. Only 10% of municipal councils are led by women and 11 of 63 ministers are women. The disadvantages women face are reflected in their lower literacy, educational enrollment and labor participation rates when compared to men. While Cameroon’s labor force was 46.8% female in 2021, men still tended to occupy higher positions. Many social practices limit equal opportunity for women. According to the U.N., more than one-third of women report suffering from domestic abuse and half report experiencing physical violence at least once in their lifetimes. One-third report being forced into a child marriage and 1% report undergoing genital mutilation. Discrimination based on ethnicity and political preference is very apparent. Membership in the CPDM is an informal prerequisite for accessing higher education, business loans and government service. There is a widespread perception that ethnic quotas are used to make decisions regarding access. Anglophones, in particular, report ongoing discrimination dating back to the abolishment of federalism in 1972, exacerbated by the ongoing Anglophone conflict.\n\nThere is also discrimination against specific minority groups. According to the U.S. State Department, the Baka people, derogatorily known as pygmies, often face discrimination and lack representation in higher government offices. Other forms of discrimination are also widespread. Similar to other African nations, social stigma arises from Albinism and HIV+ status. Cameroon lacks protection for LGBTQ+ rights and members of that community endure severe discrimination. Same-sex sexual activities are illegal. There are instances each year of imprisonment, harassment and public exposure for members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThere are insufficient environmental initiatives or regulations and enforcement is deficient. Cameroon relies heavily on fossil fuels for energy production, and there have been severe issues with land, water and air pollution. Increased investments in palm oil, mineral extraction and road development have led to higher rates of deforestation over the past decade (~1% annually, the second highest in the Congo Basin). There is little regulation of the use of pesticides. Poor waste management systems have resulted in the discharge of large amounts of refuse directly into the environment. Similarly, industrial waste and poor management of wastewater (less than 1% of sewage water is treated) have degraded water sources and supplies. Sustainable exploitation of marine life resources, particularly fisheries, remains hugely problematic with increased rates of illegal fishing. The European Union recently issued Cameroon a “yellow card” due to overfishing and its failure to cooperate in combating the problem. The government has little money to even measure air pollutants, but rates are likely rising rapidly in major cities due to urbanization. Cameroon is also highly susceptible to climate change, which has begun to cause desertification in northern regions. Cameroon currently ranks 153 on Yale’s Environmental Performance Index.\n\nThe current legal and regulatory environment is inadequate for these challenges. Cameroon is a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and participates in other regional and global environmental efforts, including the 2015 Paris Accords. Cameroon has a National Climate Change Observatory (ONACC), but this has not resulted in any policy changes. The Ministry of Environment, Nature Protection and Sustainable Development (MINIPED) has piloted reforestation programs, but there is no new legislation on the horizon. Likewise, MINIPED was consulted during the development of the 2020 National Development Strategy, but no concrete policies have yet to emerge as a result.\n\nThere are a number of social society traditions in Cameroon, but decades of authoritarian rule have limited civil society development. A large proportion of early civic organizations were permeated by the ruling party and co-opted. While civil society played an important role in the transition to multipartyism in the early 1990s – particularly Anglophone organizations – it has since undergone a process of fragmentation and political demobilization. Many of the civil society groups that have appeared recently are explicitly ethnic or used as vehicles for securing government patronage. Participation is limited to towns and cities, with many organizations lacking basic offices. Approximately 50% of the population lives in rural areas where they are integrated into local civil society traditions, but not part of national movements. There has been a steady decrease in electoral participation. The Anglophone Crisis has exacerbated this situation and created severe issues in the realm of social trust. Much of the civil society movement in the Anglophone regions has been banned and the conflict has exacerbated the perception among some Francophones that the Anglophones want to destabilize the country.\n\nAs noted above, social trust is limited. Intercommunal trust is weak, as evident in the prevalence of ethnic associations and the importance of kinship in accessing the state’s hierarchy. These patterns often extend from rural to urban areas, in the latter of which it is common to find village associations that cater to communal life.\n\nFor the past decade, Cameroon has been faced with serious social and religious conflicts. The Anglophone Crisis has taken a heavy humanitarian and economic toll. Over 4,000 people have been killed, 700,000 internally displaced, and 60,000 made refugees. Government forces have come under heavy criticism for their indiscriminate use of violence, including the destruction of entire villages and the use of rape and torture. Insurgent groups have also increasingly used violence against civilians, either to extract money, to punish perceived collaborators or to impose economic boycotts. The Anglophone Crisis has also likely made the conflict with Boko Haram in the Extreme North Region much worse. Since 2021, there has been an escalation in Boko Haram activity, in part due to the redeployment of security forces to Anglophone areas. This conflict has also taken a heavy humanitarian toll, with evidence of severe human rights violations.\n\nThe potential for other forms of violence is real. Ethnic, regional, and religious identities are reinforced and often suggested in private and public discourse to evoke alleged marginalization or favoritism. The practice of scapegoating certain groups to mobilize support or secure legitimacy for would-be-leaders is common. Some groups are persistently framed in confrontational terms. For instance, the West Cameroonian Bamileke are widely believed to monopolize economic power and are accused of being overly ambitious. Other groups like the Beti (Paul Biya’s co-ethnics) are perceived as entrenched in the upper echelons of power and unwilling to cede that power. A presidential succession would have the potential to unleash many of these tensions because different ethnic groups would compete for political power.\n\nThe government has established strategic priorities, notably through initiatives such as the Cameroon Vision 2035 program, the National Development Strategy (NDS30, 2020 – 2030), and its commitment to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the government’s own statement, the “NDS30 aims to bring about a structural transformation of the economy by making fundamental changes in economic and social structures, promoting inclusive development from within, and preserving opportunities for future generations. The ultimate goal is to elevate the country to the status of a New Industrialized Country.” The government has prepared a comprehensive 207-page document that focuses on the following four pillars: (1) structural transformation of the national economy; (2) development of human capital and well-being; (3) promotion of employment and economic\n\nintegration; (4) governance, decentralization and strategic management of the state.\n\nWhile NDS30 indicates some level of priority setting, it appears highly ambitious and its implementation relies heavily on external actors. The political leadership’s focus seems more concerned with maintaining Paul Biya as president than with achieving the stated objectives. Many of these reforms were hard won through negotiations with multilateral lenders after decades of non-compliance or mandated due to Cameroon’s membership in CEMAC. Consequently, most reforms remain incomplete and fail to meet their intended strategic goals.\n\nNumerous government institutions are poorly managed and often used to place Biya supporters so they can gain access to patronage resources. This problem includes an oversized cabinet (the largest in Africa), an excessively large civil service and a weak national legislature. Decisions are typically driven by narrow political objectives, primarily aimed at securing the regime’s survival. Implementing genuine political and economic institutional reforms would erode the ability of regime supporters to access patronage, thereby posing a significant threat to a core feature of the regime.\n\nThe political leadership is largely unable to manage cleavage-based conflict and takes steps to encourage societal and political fragmentation. The policy of “regional balancing” (i.e., public sector appointments that respect regional quotas) has been poorly implemented and has not prevented several identity groups from claiming that they are under-represented in government and public administration. There are major divisions between north-south, Anglophone-Francophone, urban-rural, west-east, Christian-Muslim and even between Northwest-Southwest Anglophone communities. The internal debate within the CPDM about who would succeed Paul Biya is primarily about which ethnic group would emerge on top. Many anticipate that this process could end up in violence, in part because the military is also divided along ethnic lines. The government benefits from this division since it ensures a strong base of core supporters for the regime (Beti) who feel threatened by changes to the status quo.\n\nThe inability to manage cleavage-based conflict is most evident in the Anglophone regions. The Francophone-Anglophone division has historically been one of the most difficult long-term cleavages to manage (in addition, there is also a division within the Anglophone community, between Northwest and Southwest Anglophone Cameroon). The government’s delegation of an ad hoc committee to negotiate with protesters, while simultaneously using state violence, exacerbated tensions. Paul Biya leveraged this in his 2018 campaign (with the slogan “the force of experience”) and portrayed the Anglophones as a threat to the integrity of Cameroon. The platforms the government has provided and the concessions it has made to respond to this conflict, such as the Major National Dialogue of 2019, the special status designation or the 2020 regional council elections did not receive support from the major Anglophone groups and have not fundamentally lowered the level of conflict.\n\nCameroon’s leadership use international partners primarily for engagement on issues of economic development and regional security, but very little on questions of democracy and governance. Many of the major aid donors are present in Cameroon, targeting a range of sectors. The World Bank has ongoing projects and Cameroon passed the third review of a 2019 IMF Extended Credit Facility. The European Union and the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) fund various development projects. The WHO and many other NGOs operate programs and offer technical expertise. While, in 2019, Cameroon lost its preferential trade status with the United States, in 2020, USAID upgraded its engagement with a “Limited Presence Country” to primarily work on issues regarding HIV/AIDs. Political leadership makes use of this assistance, but it does not translate into a consistent long-term strategy for development.\n\nCameroon lacks international partners to support efforts to improve democracy and governance. The Commonwealth Secretariat and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie are the most persistent observers, but they have also been the subjects of criticism for their unwillingness to seriously criticize the regime and the state of democracy. Cameroon receives relatively low amounts of democracy aid and is not home to major institution-building efforts. The programs funded through USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) are focused on promoting youth leadership and mitigating the impact of conflict in northern Cameroon. The European Union funds the Civil Society Strengthening Programme (PASC) but has had difficulty finding local contract partners.\n\nCameroon’s superficial stability as well as its strategic position in a restive region provides the government with an enormous amount of leniency with international partners. With the spillover of Boko Haram since 2014 and the Central African Republic crisis, diplomats and international aid workers have found further justification for ignoring poor implementation of reform initiatives and supporting the regime. This was once again notable with the tepid international response to the Anglophone Crisis. Outside of diplomatic calls for peaceful dialogue, no serious pressure has been exerted to force parties to the negotiating table. Consequently, and evident throughout its engagement with the international community, Cameroon has been able to skirt major reforms and resist real structural change to its politics or economy.\n\nCameroon has increased its international (and regional) security cooperation. It contributes troops to the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) and has allowed the Nigerian and Chadian armies to enter its territory. Likewise, Cameroon has permitted the United States to operate a drone base in the Extreme North. Cameroon is also a member of the G5 Sahel force, which was formed as a regional military coordination mechanism. Since 2021, the United States has begun to restrict visas for individuals associated with perpetuating the Anglophone Crisis.\n\nAlthough it is seen as the pillar of the CEMAC region, Cameroon’s credibility as a reliable partner has been mixed. For decades, Cameroon was a dependable partner of the French in the international arena, especially during disagreements with powerful states like the United States. Yet, in 2003 Cameroon was willing to abstain on a possible U.N. Security Council resolution on the Iraq War in exchange for American military aid. Similarly, Cameroon abstained from a U.N. vote that backed the “Goldstone Report” on the 2005 Israel-Gaza conflict, with the United States reportedly offering to support Cameroon in its territorial dispute in the Bakassi Peninsula. More recently, Cameroon abstained from a U.N. vote condemning Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and inked a military deal with Russia in April 2022. This is an indication that Cameroon seeks to maintain a relationship with Moscow for military support. Cameroon is a reliable partner in regional security operations but is not a party to the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n\nCameroon is a member of many regional organizations, such as the African Union, the monetary union of the CFA franc zone, and the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC). Within CEMAC, Cameroon is the most important market and producing economy.\n\nAnother pivotal point was the resolution of the Bakassi Peninsula dispute in 2009, which notably led to improved relations with Nigeria. As a result of this resolution, Cameroon and Nigeria have forged a partnership centered around regional security, particularly in combatting the threat posed by Boko Haram. This collaboration reached a noteworthy juncture in early 2018 when the Nigerian government facilitated the extradition of members belonging to the self-proclaimed “independent Ambazonia” administration. This gesture symbolized a deeper commitment to shared security concerns, allowing Cameroon the prerogative to pursue separatist militias across the border. Cameroon and the Central African Republic took a decisive step in 2022 by entering into an agreement to delineate their mutual border. The aim of this accord was to curb cross-border violence, fostering stability in the region. Parallel to these developments, Cameroon has demonstrated its commitment to regional security through participation in the G5 Sahel force since 2014. This coalition is chiefly dedicated to enhancing security cooperation within the region. However, it’s worth noting that despite these commendable regional cooperative initiatives, Cameroon’s role in broader aspects of Central African regional integration remains underdeveloped. In comparison to other sub-Saharan African regions, Central Africa still grapples with significant integration challenges. Thus, while Cameroon has been an active participant in regional security collaborations, there remains room for advancement in broader issues pertaining to the overall integration of the Central African region.\n\nDespite some progress in macroeconomic reform, Cameroon remains trapped in a state of inertia that appears both difficult and which the government is seemingly unwilling to overcome. While the Anglophone Crisis has brought issues of political stability to the fore of voters’ concerns, Cameroon contrasts with the continent’s trend of aging leaders being ousted or compelled to step down from power. President Paul Biya’s enduring rule signifies Cameroon’s lack of readiness to adapt to change. The issue of a “post-Biya” Cameroon is an ongoing concern, as Biya’s tenure is expected to end with his death and the country lacks the political and institutional preparedness for such an eventuality. The transition is likely to be highly contested and possibly marked by violence. Mutual distrust, factionalism and ethnic interests have made the question of succession a zero-sum game for many. A troubling indicator is the existence of rivalries within the military, with some political elites maintaining close ties to specific officers, adding to the complexity of the situation.\n\nA key factor perpetuating this outcome is a permissive international environment that views Cameroon as an “island of stability” in a strategically important region. Cameroon’s close relationship with France, and more recently, the United States and Russia, has shielded it from serious criticism on the state of its democracy and economy. Moreover, international support has helped ensure that Cameroon remains in the good graces of international lenders. This cooperation is likely to continue and provide the regime with some protection from the domestic challenges it faces. Indicatively, while there were some changes between 2020 and 2022, no donor country has suspended aid or sanctioned the regime over its gross human rights violations, especially in its violent confrontations with the Anglophone movement.\n\nYet, even if the transition to a post-Biya regime is relatively peaceful, the institutions in place and the style of politics inculcated over the past 30 years are likely to continue. The use of patronage to build political support has been the primary cause of widespread public corruption and misallocation of state resources. Regime resistance to economic and political reform is driven by the elite’s dependency on rents derived from the state (or state access) to sustain political support. Unless political incentives are realigned, it will be difficult for reform-minded elites to exert sufficient influence to push Cameroon toward real economic and political transformations.\n\nFor this reason, the economic returns on Cameroon’s infrastructural investments and exploration of off-shore natural gas are likely to be limited. Without policy reforms and equal investments in human capital, only a few will benefit from economic gains, which will be otherwise eroded by corruption and inefficiencies. Cameroon lacks sufficient spending on health care, education and social protection. State intervention in the economy and a substantial public sector inhibit private entrepreneurship and confine the private sector to large firms that cannot generate enough jobs to lift the country out of poverty. The strategic outlook reveals an economy that continues to muddle through – supported by specific advantages, such as regional integration – but performs well below its potential.\n\nThe country’s prolonged malaise has also had several social impacts that are likely to continue or worsen. There is massive demand for jobs and viable livelihoods among Cameroonians under the age of 25, who represent roughly 60% of the population. Coping with this demand will remain a key challenge for Cameroon in the years to come. Cameroonians increasingly express high distrust and disillusionment with most political institutions. Nowhere is the breakdown of social trust more evident than in the Anglophone regions, which contain approximately 25% of the population. Prolonged violence has polarized society and revealed that the regime is willing to use extreme violence to cope with challenges to its authority. The conflict will likely continue in the near future, perhaps not as intensely, but it will have generational impacts.\n\nIn international relations, Cameroon may be entering a period of change. Currently, there is a rivalry between France and Russia there, as Moscow has increasingly become a key strategic partner, particularly in terms of military and economic cooperation. It remains to be seen how this situation will unfold."
