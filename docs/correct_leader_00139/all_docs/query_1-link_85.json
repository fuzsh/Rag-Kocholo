        "text": "Background information\n\nTo ensure that the commitment of Mission 21's partner organizations and churches in Cameroon has the desired impact, the organizational and personnel development of the partner organizations plays a central role. There is a need for training and further education in the area of project and program management (planning, reporting and accounting). Our employee Lumumba Mukong and his office coordinate the country programme in Cameroon and regularly conduct training courses for the project managers of the partner organizations. These are the Presbyterian Church of Cameroon (PCC), the Protestant University of Central Africa (PUCA), Aid International Christian Women of Vision (AIChrisWoV) and the Emmanuel Sisters, as well as the projects of the former Stucki Foundation. In addition, there are the partner organizations in emergency aid that work on a mandate basis.\n\nIt is central for Mission 21 partners to know about the work of other international organizations and to cooperate with them. The Mission 21 coordinator does important networking work to promote mutual learning and exchange processes and to enable synergies. One of the main tasks is the coordination of the ecumenical emergency aid program for the many internally displaced persons since the escalation of the political situation in the Anglophone provinces of the country.\n\nProject goals\n\nThe aim of the project is to increase the impact of the projects in Cameroon. It also develops capacities in the partner organizations and strengthens networking between different actors. The coordinator Lumumba Mukong forms a bridge between the partner organizations in Cameroon and Mission 21 in Basel. This improves the flow of communication and program management. Mission 21 can thus respond more specifically to the needs of the people on the ground, especially in the current political crisis, which has led to a large number of internally displaced persons since 2016.\n\nTarget group\n\nThe coordination office works together with the partner organizations of Mission 21:\n\nPresbyterian Church in Cameroon (PCC)\n\nPUCA\n\nAI-ChrisWoV\n\nEmmanuel Sisters and the projects of the former Stucki Foundation\n\nIn addition to these organizations, the CBC (Cameroon Baptist Convention) and seven local non-governmental organizations are also involved in the emergency aid program.\n\nActivities\n\nThe scope of the coordination office primarily includes the following activities:\n\nProgram management (planning, monitoring and evaluation)\n\nRelationship management with and support for partner organizations, especially in capacity building\n\nNetwork and public relations work, including guest services\n\nEnsuring the flow of communication between Cameroon and Switzerland Coordination of the ecumenical humanitarian aid program\n\nProject progress\n\nThe local coordinator Lumumba Mukong took up his duties in April 2016. Since then, numerous processes have been initiated that increase the impact of Mission 21's work in Cameroon. Thanks to the coordinator, the projects in the major areas of health, education, theological training and emergency aid are better coordinated and synergies are made possible. Thanks to these activities, donations can be used even more efficiently and sustainably. In addition, there is participation in international committees and organizations, for example in the regional forum of ACT Alliance. The official registration of Mission 21 as an international organization with the Cameroonian government has strengthened our networking activities."
