        "text": "Americans planning travel to Cameroon are encouraged to consult the Department of State’s latest Cameroon International Travel Information. This information, updated periodically, may be accessed by visiting the Department of State’s travel website. American citizens residing in Cameroon are urged to register with the Consular Section’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.\n\nBusiness Customs\n\nCameroon is the largest economy in Central Africa. It has a blend of Western and local business culture. Cameroonians appreciate an opportunity to get to know potential partners before beginning concrete discussions. It is helpful to supplement written communication with as many face-to-face contacts as possible. Adherence to Western standards of punctuality is not common; patience and persistence are needed to do business in Cameroon. In professional settings, Cameroonians dress in business attire. The use of the internet and email is somewhat limited compared to Western standards, but rapidly increasing especially in urban areas and among Cameroon’s growing youth population. A growing number of companies have sophisticated websites with company email domain addresses, though use of Gmail or Yahoo! accounts is still common, even in government.\n\nTravel Advisory\n\nAs of September 2023, Cameroon is suffering from Boko Haram terrorist attacks in the Far North Region, an influx of refugees from the Central African Republic in its East Region, and a violent separatist movement in the Northwest and Southwest Regions. U.S. citizens are strongly advised against travelling to the Northwest, Southwest, Far North, and North regions, and to the Adamaoua region north of the capital Ngaoundere, and the border area with the Central African Republic in the East. Please check the U.S. Embassy Consular Website for the latest security alerts and enroll in the Department of State’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). American citizens of Cameroonian descent are advised that Cameroon does not recognize dual citizenship and they should enter Cameroon on their U.S. passports.\n\nVisa requirements\n\n-Requirements for Entry include:\n\n-Passport\n\n-Visa\n\n-Current immunization records, including evidence of yellow fever vaccination are required for entry into Cameroon.\n\n-World Health Organization (WHO) card with yellow fever vaccination.\n\n-Please check the U.S. Embassy website for the latest health information.\n\nAs of 30 April 2023, all applications for entry visas to Cameroon shall be completed exclusively online, by accessing evisacam.cm. Visit the Cameroon Embassy website for the most current visa information. Overseas inquiries should be made at the nearest Cameroon Embassy or Consulate.\n\nU.S. Companies that require travel of foreign businesspersons to the United States are advised that security evaluations are handled via an interagency process. Visa applicants should go to the following link(s): State Department Visa Website.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe currency of Cameroon is the CFA Franc, which is pegged to the Euro with a fixed rate (one Euro is worth 655 CFA Francs). Cameroon remains a cash heavy economy, particularly outside of Yaoundé and Douala. Cash machines are increasingly common, even in second and third tier cities. Select hotels have electronic credit and debit card processing units for their businesses, though most rely on cash.\n\nTelecommunications/Electronics\n\nCameroon and the United States have a direct telephone link via satellite. Cameroon’s country code is 237. All telephone numbers have nine digits; there are no city-specific area codes. Cameroon has facsimile and telex services. There are three private mobile telephone companies currently operating 3G mobile networks in Cameroon: Orange, MTN, and Nexttel. MTN and Orange offer LTE sim cards. All mobile phone companies currently operate on the GSM 900 and 1800 standards with mobile internet-access capabilities. CAMTEL, the national telecom provider, also provides internet access, as do several private companies, and there are internet cafes in all cities and larger towns. There is increasing access to the internet even in many rural areas, with MTN and Orange boasting nationwide mobile-modem coverage. Several smaller private companies provide mobile internet access using Wi-Fi connectivity. The cost of internet connectivity is quite expensive and connection rates are relatively slow. There were 10 million internet users in Cameroon as of January 2022, for an internet penetration rate of 36.5 percent. Kepios analysis indicates that internet users in Cameroon increased by 967,000 (+10.6 percent) between 2021 and 2022. As with all infrastructure services, there is an acute shortage of telecommunications access in the Far North Region, when compared to telephone and internet services in the rest of Cameroon. The West Africa Cable System (WACS) is a submarine cable link with a 14.5 Terabit/second design capacity, with a Cameroon landing point in Limbe, which allows MTN to provide high-speed backbone capacity in Cameroon. Smaller entrepreneurial Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Creolink are now building out more robust internet and cable networks in Cameroon due to WACS connectivity.\n\nTransportation\n\nRoad Conditions and Safety: Cameroon’s roads networks are poorly maintained and are not well lit. U.S. citizens are strongly advised not to travel outside of the major cities after dark. During the rainy season from April to November, many roads are not passable even with four-wheel-drive vehicles. Traffic safety is hazardous due to lack of traffic signs, poorly trained/disciplined drivers, inadequately maintained vehicles, and indifference among many drivers toward the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. Other driving risks include excessive speed, erratic driving habits, lack of vehicle maintenance, and pedestrians, wildlife, and livestock.\n\nOutside of major cities, travel with extra fuel, food, and water, as well as a reliable means of communication, such as a satellite phone or radio, as mobile phone coverage is limited. Professional roadside assistance service is not available. You are allowed to drive in Cameroon with your state driver’s license for up to three months.\n\nAccidents: Accidents due to hazardous road conditions are a major threat to health and safety. In the event of an automobile accident, remain inside the vehicle and wait for police. Although it is illegal to move your vehicle before the police arrive, if a crowd forms or you feel threatened, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly.\n\nPublic Transportation: Avoid all travel by public transportation and hire private transport from a reliable source. Any form of public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. Mini-buses, buses, trains, and ferries are in poor mechanical condition and are often filled well beyond their intended capacity. Make sure any car you hire is adequately insured, preferably by written confirmation from the insurance company (rather than the car hire firm). If you are hiring a driver and car, make sure you are not liable for any accident or damage.\n\nLanguage\n\nAlthough both French and English are official languages in Cameroon, at least two-thirds of the population speaks primarily French, which is the dominant business language. A majority of professional Cameroonians understand, even though they may not speak, both languages. Pidgin English is a local language in the two predominantly English-speaking regions (the Southwest and Northwest) of Cameroon. Staff at most hotels and restaurants usually understand both English and French.\n\nHealth\n\nAll visitors entering Cameroon must present evidence of a yellow fever vaccination on a valid World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Immunization Certificate. Immunization against rabies, tetanus, typhoid, polio, meningitis, and hepatitis A and B is also recommended. Cameroon has chloroquine- and fansidar-resistant malaria. Americans are urged to take appropriate malaria prophylactic medication and to use insect repellents. Travelers should explore health insurance options, including provisions for evacuation and emergency procedures. COVID-19 information can be found on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Health Information for Travelers to Cameroon.\n\nLocal time, business hours, and holidays\n\nCameroon local time is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) +1. The statutory Cameroonian workweek is forty hours from Mondays to Saturdays. Civil service workers are not required to work on Saturdays, but most businesses are open on that day. Government offices are officially open from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. without interruption, but shorter hours and longer lunch breaks are the norm. Businesses are usually open between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.\n\nTemporary Entry of Materials and Personal Belongings\n\nThe temporary entry of goods is allowed, provided the traveler can justify that the goods are personal effects and/or the goods are to serve only for the temporary period of residence or nature of its usage. Visitors’ household items (except automobiles, for which there is a special clearance procedure) are customs duty exempt."
