        "text": "Overview: Because of its modest oil resources and favorable agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious problems confronting other underdeveloped countries, such as stagnant per capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, endemic corruption, and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. Subsidies for electricity, food, and fuel have strained the budget. Cameroon has several large infrastructure projects under construction, including a deep sea port in Kribi and the Lom Pangar Hydropower Project. It also recently opened a natural gas powered electricity generating plant. Cameroon must attract more investment to improve its inadequate infrastructure, but its business environment is a deterrent to foreign investment.\n\nGross Domestic Product:\n\nGDP (PPP): $67.23 billion (global rank: 96)\n\nGDP per capita (PPP): $3,000 (global rank: 189)\n\nreal growth rate: 5.1% (global rank: 52)\n\ncomposition by sector: agriculture: 19.9%, industry: 27.6%, services: 52.5%\n\nCurrency:\n\ncurrency: Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale Francs\n\nexchange rate (per US Dollar): 491.2\n\nPoverty:\n\npopulation below poverty line: 48%\n\nunemployment rate: 30%\n\nAgricultural Products:\n\ncoffee, cocoa, cotton, rubber, bananas, oilseed, grains, root starches; livestock; timber\n\nIndustries:\n\npetroleum production and refining, aluminum production, food processing, light consumer goods, textiles, lumber, ship repair\n\nExports Commodities:\n\ncrude oil and petroleum products, lumber, cocoa beans, aluminum, coffee, cotton\n\nImports Commodities:"
