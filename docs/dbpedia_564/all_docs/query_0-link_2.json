        "text": "Barry Davis was one of the game's greats. He was a superb half-back flanker and then ruck rover who came to Essendon from Essendon High School and started as a half-forward.\n\nHe played one game in the Seconds before debuting in Round 2, 1961, and played every remaining game that year to finish with the Best First Year Player award. In just his second season he played in a premiership. He had just turned 19. He won a second premiership in 1965 after missing seven games with a severe facial fracture, incurred in a game against St Kilda.\n\nDavis had all the skills, was tough but scrupulously fair and could read the play well. He was a fabulous mark and one of the best kicks in the game.\n\nIn the 1960s he was part of Essendon's great half-back lines with Alex Epis and Ian Shelton. He ultimately became a top ruck-rover where he could display his talents all over the field. He won the Club's Most Consistent Player award in 1964 and 1966 and Best Team Man in 1967.\n\nDavis captained Essendon in 1970 and 1971 before becoming vice-captain to Des Tuddenham in 1972. He had also been vice-captain in 1969.\n\nPrior to becoming captain in 1970, he was one of the five senior players who resigned over pay and conditions, refusing to play in the first game of the season.\n\nDavis won the Club Best and Fairest award in 1968, 1969 and 1971 and was runner-up in 1972. he was also twice runner-up in the Brownlow Medal in 1969 and 1971 (18 votes both years). He also polled most Essendon votes in 1968 with 14 votes and in 1970 with 7 votes.\n\nHe was selected in the State side in every year from 1967 to 1972 and was vice-captain of Victoria in 1971.\n\nIn 1967, Davis was selected in the team to play Gaelic football in Dublin and New York as well as an Australian Rules exhibition match in London. He had the distinction of being selected in the All Ireland team.\n\nHe was also selected on the half-back flank in The Sun All Star team in 1972 and in the Inside Football team of the year in 1971 and 1972.\n\nIn 1973, he left Essendon controversially under a new League ten year's service rule, to captain North Melbourne and he led that club to a premiership in 1975.\n\nDavis later returned to Essendon as a specialist coach in 1976 and he became coach from 1978 to 1980. He did not have a great deal of success as coach and, in 1980, he announced mid season that he would resign if Essendon didn't make the five.\n\nHe kept his word.\n\nDavis returned to Essendon in mid-1982 to help out with the Under 19s for the remainder of that season."
