His prowess for developing the QB position was on full display as he coached EIU QB Pierce Holley to 2nd team All OVC honors after Holley finished #25 in the nation in passing yards. It was the 8th different QB that Davis has coached to All Conference honors in his career. Davis has been a part of 9 seasons where his QB's have accounted for over 3,000 yards of offense and 30 touchdowns.\n\nPrior to EIU, Davis spent 2018-2021 as the Associate Head Coach, Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks Coach at UAlbany where his offenses broke 21 school records, produced 3 All Americans as well as 6 All-CAA selections.\n\nIn 2019, Davis’ offense saw redshirt-freshman Jeff Undercuffler throw for a freshman FCS record, single-season UAlbany record, and FCS-leading 41 touchdown passes. The Great Danes ranked third in the CAA in scoring offense, averaging 31.4 points per game, and fourth in passing efficiency. Collectively, the Great Danes gained 387.8 yards per game on the season. In addition to his touchdown record, Undercuffler set single-season program records with 262 completions, 464 passing attempts, and 3,543 yards. He led the CAA in passing yards. Undercuffler further set single-game program records with 31 completions, 53 attempts, and tied the single-game program record with 398 passing yards. Against Central Connecticut State in the FCS Playoffs First Round, Undercuffler threw for a single-game program-record six touchdown passes. Undercuffler was named CAA Offensive Rookie of the Year, HERO Sports Freshman All-America First Team, All-ECAC Second Team, ECAC FCS Rookie of the Year, Phil Steele Postseason CAA Freshman of the Year, and Phil Steele Postseason FCS Freshman All-America Second Team. Additionally, Undercuffler was the runner-up for the STATS FCS Jerry Rice Award, recognizing the top freshman in the country.\n\nDavis spent the 2016-2017 seasons as the Passing Game Coordinator and Quarterbacks Coach at Fordham University where he mentored quarterback Kevin Anderson who finished his career by setting a school record for career touchdown passes with 73. In 2016, Davis helped the Fordham passing game rank second in the Patriot League and 18th in the NCAA FCS, averaging 268.5 yards per game.\n\nIn 2015, Davis served as the Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks Coach at Northern Iowa. UNI advanced to the quarterfinals of the NCAA FCS Championship and a #6 ranking in the final FCS polls. The Panthers’ offense established a school record for rushing yards in a season with 3,266 and for the first time in school history produced a pair of 1,000-yard rushers in the same season. Davis mentored MVFC Newcomer of the Year and 2nd Team All MVFC QB Aaron Bailey who broke the conference record for rushing yards (1,334) and rushing touchdowns (19) in a season by a quarterback.\n\nIn 2013-2014, Davis served as the Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks coach at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania. The SU offense broke 55 school records during his tenure and produced All Americans in QB Zach Zulli and WR Trevor Harman. In 2014 Davis’ offense ranked eighth in Division II football in total offense (513 YPG) and second in first downs (29 PG).\n\nFrom 2009-2012 Davis spent four seasons as the Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks coach at the highly successful Division III program at Wheaton College (IL). Under his direction, the Thunder averaged more than 35 points and 400 yards per game while totaling 18 All-Conference selections on offense along with two All-Americans.\n\nDavis was also the quarterbacks coach at Wayne State from 2003-05 before heading to North Park University in Chicago to become the associate head coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Vikings from 2006-2008.\n\nThe Brighton, MI native played collegiate football at Adrian College, where he was the starting quarterback for the Bulldogs. He finished his career with eight school records and was a two-time team captain. Davis continued his career after graduation, playing overseas and working as the offensive coordinator for the Vienna Rangers in Austria in 2003. He also spent three seasons as a quarterback in both the National Indoor Football League and the Arena Football League.\n\nHe earned his B.A. in communications from Adrian in 2002 and received an M.A. in sports administration from Wayne State in 2005. Joe and his wife, Whitney, are the proud parents of daughters Zoey and Jolie."
