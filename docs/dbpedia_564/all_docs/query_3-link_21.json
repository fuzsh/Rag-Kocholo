See the link below for video from this current season, 2013.\n\n2013 Season Highlight Video Link:\n\nhttp://www.hudl.com/athlete/o/1022473/#highlights/63402377\n\nI have played several different sports since I was 5 years old but I love the game of football. It is my goal to be the best football player that I can be and to continue playing football in college while pursuing a degree in pre-med. The summer of 2012 was a busy one and I attended several camps and combines. At the National Underclassmen combine in March 2012 I was named to the All Combine team and invited to the Ultimate 100 camp in Atlanta GA. After attending the U100 combine in Atlanta, I was invited to the National Underclassmen Top Prospect development camp at the University of Oklahoma in July 2012. It was a great experience to attend these events and I learned a lot about myself, realizing that I was able to compete against some of the top football recruits in the country."
