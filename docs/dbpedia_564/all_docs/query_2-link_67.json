        "text": "A place at Brazil 2014 might be in their own hands but England have been here before, and the omens are against them.\n\nIt is almost exactly 40 years since the Three Lions last needed to beat Poland in a make-or-break World Cup qualifier - and the man who stopped them then is back in town.\n\nJan Tomaszewski will be watching at Wembley on Tuesday, where he entered footballing folklore with a virtuoso, if unorthodox, goalkeeping performance on 17 October 1973.\n\nFamously dubbed a \"circus clown in gloves\" by Brian Clough on TV before kick-off, his heroics helped Poland hold England in a game Sir Alf Ramsey's side needed to win to reach the 1974 World Cup finals.\n\nNone of the England team were laughing at the end of a completely one-sided match that saw them take 36 shots to Poland's two, force 26 corners, hit the woodwork twice and have four efforts cleared off the line.\n\nBut Tomaszewski has much happier memories.\n\n\"I have never watched the game again,\" he told BBC Sport. \"But if you have a game like this, you always remember it in your heart. I can wake up in the middle of the night and remember every minute.\"\n\nPoland had gone top of a three-team group with one game to go after beating England in a bad-tempered match in Chorzow in June and Ramsey was coming under pressure from the press.\n\nNobody was panicking, however. After all, England had been at every World Cup finals since they entered for the first time in 1950, had won the tournament less than eight years earlier, and had been one of the best teams at the 1970 finals in Mexico too.\n\n\"It was win or bust but I don't think anybody seriously thought England would fail,\" said Barry Davies, who was at Wembley commentating on the game for the BBC.\n\n\"This was still in the age when everybody felt we had an entitlement to be in the World Cup finals, and it was simply unthinkable that we wouldn't be there.\"\n\nPoland boss Kazimierz Gorski thought otherwise. He knew his players saw Wembley as an impenetrable fortress and, according to Tomaszewski, used that to inspire them.\n\nIn the dressing room before kick-off, Gorski told his players: \"Win against a weak team and there is no joy. You can play for 20 years and in 1,000 games and nobody will remember you. But tonight, in one game, against a team like England and at a place like this, you have the chance to put your names in the history books.\"\n\nThey did.\n\nMost of the 100,000 crowd were expecting England to get their revenge. So were some of the Poland side.\n\n\"I wasn't just afraid of England - I was terrified,\" Tomaszewski added. \"They had beaten Austria 7-0 a month earlier and when I was in front of the royal box with the national anthems being played, I was just thinking 'I hope we are not the next Austria'.\"\n\nIf it was not for the exploits of the then 25-year-old LKS Lodz keeper, it might indeed have ended up being a similar scoreline. But his first eccentric save, after two minutes, was almost his last.\n\n\"I was feeling the pressure and did not notice that Allan Clarke was standing two metres away from me when I rolled the ball out,\" Tomaszewski explained.\n\n\"I dived at his feet to make a save but he kicked me instead of the ball and I broke five tiny bones (his metacarpals) in my left wrist, like glass.\n\n\"They were frozen during the game and the adrenaline meant I did not feel the pain. Afterwards, one of my team-mates Adam Musial told me 'it was good that he kicked you because he woke you up'.\"\n\nChance after England chance followed but, whether it was Tomaszewski's legs, arms or hands, he continued to keep the ball out, even if he dived the wrong way.\n\nWhen he was beaten, the posts or a team-mate came to his rescue, and the score was goalless at the break.\n\nIn a sense, Clough was right; a goal did arrive early in the second half. Sadly for England, it was Poland who scored it.\n\n\"I had spent quite a lot of time watching the Poles in training before the game,\" said veteran commentator Davies.\n\n\"I could see how they were going to play. They knew they would be under pressure but they thought they had the pace to catch England on the break.\"\n\nThat is exactly what happened. Norman Hunter, preferred to Bobby Moore in central defence, came across to pick up the ball on the left touchline near the halfway line but got his feet tangled up.\n\nRobert Gadocha was left free to surge towards the area before playing in Jan Domarski, who was arriving like a train to his right, to hit a low shot that skidded past Emlyn Hughes' challenge and went under Peter Shilton's dive.\n\nHunter trudged off the pitch looking utterly dejected, and there were more tears from several other players in a desolate England dressing room afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Poland's party was just beginning, but not for Tomaszewski.\n\n\"How did I celebrate? I was the only one who didn't,\" he said. \"The team went out all night but I was in pain with my wrist and stayed in my hotel room to take medicine.\n\n\"In the morning, I saw the newspapers and felt extremely satisfied because I was on the front pages.\n\n\"They called me the 'man who stopped England' but it was not just me. It was Gorski and the 11 people he positioned on the pitch. Against England, I made mistakes but they were not punished because of my team-mates.\"\n\nPoland would go on to finish third at the 1974 World Cup, with Tomaszewski excelling.\n\nWembley was just the start of a golden period in Poland's footballing history, but for Ramsey it was the beginning of the end. By the time the finals started the following June, England's only World Cup-winning manager had been sacked.\n\nTomaszewski, who is now a 65-year-old politician, had the last laugh on his critic Clough too.\n\n\"Years later we met at the BBC in Manchester,\" he said. \"Clough apologised for what he had said about me. We shook hands and I said thank you, because only great people can admit to mistakes.\"\n\nWith thanks to Jan Krzesimowski, who acted as a translator for Jan Tomaszewski."
