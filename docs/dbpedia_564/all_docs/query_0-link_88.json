        "text": "EVENWOOD TO AUSTRALIA VIA LONDON & HOLLAND\n\nSome time ago, the ICREAR Facebook page and the ER&DHS website posted a number of articles about sporting personalities which featured Arthur Purdy, Jacky Bell, John Peddelty, Steve Vickers and Tony McMahon who all played at the highest level in the English Football League, some gaining international honours at Junior level. Oliver Bogle thought Barry Bolton had played for Chelsea – he was contracted by Chelsea but never played first team football. Barry contacted us and penned a few lines, outlining his football career. There will be a few names that people recognise – thanks Barry.\n\nBarry Bolton was a member of the Staindrop Secondary Modern School which won 4 trophies in 3 seasons.\n\nAbove 1968-69 season: Staindrop Secondary Modern School\n\nAbove: 1969-70 season: Staindrop Secondary Modern School\n\nBarry, along with Kenny Brown and William Hull from Evenwood, were in the Bishop Auckland Schoolboy team that had a great run in the English Schools Trophy. In front of 5,500 at Kingsway, Bishop Auckland they beat Coalville Boys 1 – 0.\n\nHe believes that they were robbed in the next round against Huyton (Liverpool) Boys. They were 1 nil ahead in the away tie when Jimmy “Flash” Elliott was brought down in the penalty area. The “home” referee didn’t blow and waved play on. Had Jimmy or Jeff Smith scored from the spot, making it 1 – 1, then the draw would have meant a replay at Bishop Auckland. In front of a 5000+ crowd, “We would have done ‘em!” Barry continues,\n\n“I give Huyton one thing, that day they had the best player on the pitch – Peter Reid was outstanding but we were the better team.”\n\nBarry Bolton signed schoolboy forms for Chelsea at the age of 14 and went on to have 3 years at the club, 2 years as an apprentice and 1 year as a professional, winning 3 trophies in the 1973-74 season.\n\nFamous names in this squad are the late Ray “Butch” Wilkins, Clive Walker, Ray Lewington and Steve Wicks.\n\nAfter breaking his leg as a young pro, Chelsea released him and FC Dordrecht (Holland) signed him on a 1-year contract, promising a 3 year deal at Xmas. After successful trails against an Arsenal team which included Charlie George and Liam Brady and a touring Algerian national team, Barry broke his leg for a second time, half way through the season. FC Dordrecht reneged on the 3-year contract and released him after 1 year.\n\nBarry Bolton returned to England and once fit again, played local football for Tindale WMC alongside Johnny Hussey, one of his boyhood heroes, Johnny being an influential member of the all-conquering Evenwood Town side of 1969-71 seasons. As a kid, he watched every home game and many away matches, even being allowed onto the team coach.\n\nTindale WMC had a cracking team with Johnny Hussey, Jacky Foster, “Flash” Elliott, Stan “the Man” Thexton, Gordon Beecham, Kenny Yorke, Josh Richardson to name but a few. Barry’s first goal for Tindale WMC was against Seaton Carew in a 10 – 0 victory which would have taken them into the last 16 of the prestigious County Cup competition. However, Club Secretary Dale Daniel had “erred” with Barry’s international clearance with Durham F.A. and they were kicked out of the competition.\n\nAfter a while in the North East at home with parents Norman and Annie and his brothers and sisters, he headed back down south, this time to play for Barnet in North London, 1977. Dave Sexton, manager of QPR arranged the move with the then Barnet Chairman, Dave Underwood. Marvin Hinton (ex-Chelsea) and Bob McNab (ex-Arsenal) played for Barnet at this time.\n\nBarry trained 3 days a week with the QPR reserves. QPR had a great team with Stan Bowles, Gerry Francis, John Hollins, David Webb and Dave “Ticer” Thomas from West Auckland. One of the highlights with Barnet was a game against Chelmsford when the legendary Jimmy Greaves played for the opposition in the tied game. Barry recalls,\n\n“I played 90 minutes against Jimmy and never got a tackle on him in the whole game. Even at this late stage of his career, he was too smart and too clever. In his autobiography, Jimmy stated that he knew he was an alcoholic by them but he was still a class act.”\n\nAfter a season with Barnet, he headed back home playing Sunday League football for Tindale Club again and on Saturday’s for Shildon under their new coach Kenny Morton, an ex-Manchester United player. Kenny had played in Australia and after a few games recommended that Barry try his luck in Oz. He thought, the conditions would suit Barry’s style of play – flat, green pitches good for skilful players on the ball. Kenny had the contacts, Barry was up for a new challenge and within a couple of weeks a contract was drawn up for the following season with Prahran Suavia, a Czechoslovakian club in Melbourne. In Australia at this time, the European immigrants organised their own leagues. There were no National or State leagues.\n\nBarry, tragically, broke his leg for the third time while playing for Tindale Club – his right leg, both the other breaks had been to his left leg. Three broken legs before the age of 22. Sunderland’s Bobby Kerr managed 2 broken legs early in his career and was regarded as particularly unlucky – but 3? This didn’t deter the young Bolton and within weeks of getting the plaster off, he was up to full fitness. He didn’t let Prahran officials know anything about the injury and off to Australia he went.\n\nFrom the start, he was in the first team, playing left midfield, using his left peg more than ever, giving the right time to strengthen. Barry was always a 2 footed player and thanks his dad Norman for encouraging him to use both feet. The club actually thought that Barry was a left footed player.\n\nAfter 6 months, the weather wasn’t what he expected in Melbourne and he’d heard that the weather in Perth, Western Australia was much warmer. He had 4 good mates over in Perth. Barry negotiated a deal which took him to, Inglewood Kiev a Ukrainian club. As he arrived in Perth, his mates were off to Argentina to watch the World Cup – it was 1978. In Perth, he lived with Alex Willoughby (ex-Rangers and Aberdeen) and his wife.\n\nLater, Barry moved on to Perth Azzurri, an Italian side.\n\nHe had the great pleasure of playing alongside the great Bobby Charlton. Barry says:\n\n“At 42, Charlton’s skills were still as sharp as ever and he was the stand out player of the tournament. Both Bolton and Charlton on the score sheet in the 3 – 1 win over Gosnels F.C. To have your name on the team sheet alongside Bobby Charlton – what an honour!”\n\nBarry had 10 good years in Perth. The 3 broken legs didn’t hold him back. There were some top players gracing the football pitches of Western Australia – Charlton, Willoughby, Ernie Hannagan (ex-Coventry & Preston NE, Derek McKay (ex-Aberdeen & Crystal Palace), Reg. Davis (ex-Newcastle & Wales) to name but a few.\n\nBarry retired from the game having sustained a knee injury which, later in life, resulted in a knee replacement.\n\nAfter 47 years enjoying life in Australia and returning home to visit family and friends, on one trip, when he married Angie, they met the late, great George Best.\n\nBarry was in Evenwood this summer catching up again with family and friends. A highlight was the visit to the Two Blues Memorabilia Shop in Bishop Auckland. Keith Oldfield showed him round, meeting John Phelan, Steve Newcombe, Charlie Townsend, Peter Dunn and others.\n\n“And would you believe it, while Keith was walking me back up Bishop main street who did we spot walking down the other side of the street with 2 ladies, my boyhood hero – Johnny Hussey. I had to cross the road to shake his hand and tell him he was my hero at Evenwood and I used to carry his bag into the ground so I’d get in for free. When I told Johnny all this, he said, “Thank you, thank you.” I also told him we played together at Tindale Club. When I told him my name Bolton, he said, “Yes. You went to Chelsea.” Great that he remembered me from all those years back!”\n\n“It was a fantastic trip from start to finish – Evenwood to Australia with London and Holland in between”\n\nAND WHAT DID BARRY DO AFTER FOOTBALL?\n\nREAD ON\n\nHere’s another photo from Perth, about 1984\n\nAnd a recent press article by John Phelan, Northern Echo, 20 January 2024."
