        "text": "COLLEGE STATION â€“ Texas A&M Men's Basketball Director of Student-Athlete Development Barry Davis was honored as a member of the inaugural class into the Hill College Athletic Hall Of Fame earlier this month in Hillsboro, Texas.\n\nDavis was a standout at Hill College from 1973-74, leading the Runnin' Rebels to their best-ever NCJAA tournament finish. The Galveston native arrived at Hill College after spending his freshman year at Sam Houston State. In his one season in Hillsboro, he led the team in both rebounding and scoring. Davis and the Rebels made a long run into the postseason, culminating in a fifth place finish at the 1974 NCJAA Tournament.\n\nDavis was named Most Valuable Player of the 1974 NCJAA Region V Tournament, where the Rebels captured a spot in the national tournament in Hutchinson, Kan. The Rebels went 3-1 in the national tournament where Davis was named First Team All-Tournament.\n\nAfter his lone season in Hillsboro, Davis transferred to Texas A&M where he led the Aggies to consecutive Southwest Conference titles. At A&M, Davis was named All-Southwest Conference twice and led the Aggies to their first 20-win season and an NCAA Tournament appearance in 1975. After graduating, Davis joined the Texas A&M coaching staff and helped lead the Aggies to the Sweet 16 in 1980."
