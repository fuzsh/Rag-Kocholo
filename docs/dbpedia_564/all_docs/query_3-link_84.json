        "text": "Now in his second season at UNLV, former NFL player Akeem Davis oversees the Rebel cornerbacks. His 2023 position group was highlighted by an all-conference performance from Cameron Oliver, who tied for the Mountain West lead and for sixth in the nation with five interceptions -- the most picks by a Rebel since 2010. Oliver was named First Team All-Mountain West by Phil Steele, College Football Network and Mountain West Wire. Overall, the Rebels tied for fourth in the nation with 17 interceptions and tied for 17th in the nation with a turnover margin of plus-eight.\n\nDavis came to Las Vegas after three seasons as co-defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach at Austin Peay State University, including both the spring and fall seasons for the ASUN Conference program in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, two of Davis’ DBs earned all-conference honors, including Third Team All-American Demetries Ford, as APSU grabbed 13 interceptions. In fall of 2021, the Governors ranked second in the FCS with 19 interceptions and fifth in pass efficiency defense. That season, Davis coached two consensus All-Americans in Johnathon Edwards and Conference Defensive Player of the Year Koby Perry.\n\nPrior to his time in Clarksville, Tennessee, Davis was a member of the Southern Miss coaching staff for four years beginning as a defensive graduate assistant for the 2017 season. He was elevated to USM’s cornerbacks coach in 2019 and then moved to oversee the Golden Eagles’ running backs before the 2020 season when he coached Frank Gore Jr. to Second Team All-Conference USA honors.\n\nDavis was an undrafted free agent signee by the NFL’s Washington Commanders in 2014 and spent parts of three seasons on the active roster at Washington, New Orleans, Seattle, Indianapolis and Jacksonville. He played 21 games in the NFL, finishing with 11 tackles and a forced fumble.\n\nThe NFL Network documented Davis’ journey from undrafted free agent to making a 53-man NFL roster in its “Undrafted” series. Off the field, Davis established the AD47 Football Leadership Academy. AD47 is a free, one-day football skills camp dedicated to implementing the “Five Pillars” core curriculum of Character, Leadership, Discipline, Follow-through, and Grit. The academy is sanctioned and insured by the NFL Foundation and run in partnership with USA Football through the FUNdamentals program.\n\nIn college, Davis played three seasons at Memphis, posting 162 tackles, three interceptions, five forced fumbles and seven fumble recoveries in 34 career games for the Tigers. Davis is married to the former Sierra Byrd and the couple has a daughter, Carsyn, and son, CJ.\n\nDAVIS’ COACHING FILE\n\n2022-PR UNLV – Cornerbacks\n\n2021-22 Austin Peay – Co-Defensive Coordinator, Defensive Backs\n\n2020 Southern Miss – Running Backs\n\n2019 Southern Miss – Cornerbacks\n\n2017-18 Southern Miss – Graduate Assistant"
