        "text": "NEW ORLEANS – Tulane University football secured one of the great wins in program history back on Dec. 1, 1973, as it defeated the LSU Tigers for the first time since the 1948 season.\n\nTulane dominated every phase of the game, as it defeated an LSU team that was bound for the Orange Bowl before the largest football crowd in the history of the South at the time.\n\nThe two teams drew 86,598 fans to Tulane Stadium. The attendance mark still ranks as the most fans to ever see a college football game at Tulane University.\n\nThe Green Wave led in first downs (14-12), rushing (205-165), passing (110-55) and total yardage (315-220). Defensively, Tulane more then held its own as it racked up 52 yards worth of sacks.\n\nDepth made the difference as the number two offensive unit registered both scoring drives with Terry Looney hitting Darwin Willie with a 36-yard touchdown pass with only 19 seconds left in the first half.\n\nDoug Bynum’s 53-yard scamper up the middle set up the clinching touchdown in the final quarter, a one-yard plunge by Lyndon Lassiter. Tulane defenders picked off three passes and allowed LSU inside the Tulane 20-yard line only once.\n\nWith the win over LSU, Tulane finished the regular season 9-2 under the direction of head coach Bennie Ellender and earned a bid to the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston.\n\nTulane fell to Houston in the bowl game, but still finished the year with a No. 15-ranking in the UPI Poll and No. 20-ranking in the Associated Press Poll.\n\nDownload the official mobile app of Tulane Athletics. Now, you can stay in touch with the Green Wave anytime and anywhere on your Android or iOS mobile device.\n\nFollow Tulane football on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at @GreenWaveFB.

The lessons Green Wave student-athletes have learned through their connection with this university and city have BUILT doctors, lawyers, business leaders, conference champions, all-conference players, All-Americans, professional athletes and NCAA tournament teams.
