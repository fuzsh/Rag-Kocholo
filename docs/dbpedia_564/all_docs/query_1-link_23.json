        "text": "ðŸŽµ \"Little boxes on the hillside, Little boxes made of ticky tacky, Little boxes on the hillside, Little boxes all the same.\" ðŸŽµ These lyrics from \"Little Boxes\" reminded me of the importance of breaking free from conformity and finding our own leadership style. As leaders, it is also our duty to inspire others to step out of their boxes and embrace their leadership uniqueness. Let's create a world where every individual's authentic leadership shines, driving positive change and making a lasting impact. Break free from the little boxes and inspire action today! https://lnkd.in/e7QgV6fQ\n\nJay used to think that managing was all about coaching. Jay Floyd is a data engineering leader, life coach, and podcaster. He is also the curator of the 'What's Good' brand, dedicated to finding the good in all of life's scenarios, or as he calls it, 'feeding our good wolf.' We discuss leading with a personal touch, the power of positive growth, fostering rich team environments, and the wolves we carry inside us. Watch or read our interview here: https://lnkd.in/gZExqVG2 or listen to it here: https://lnkd.in/g4hczWxS. How are you getting to know your teammates as people today? Let Jay and me know in the comments. #leadership #mindset #change\n\nSome days it is all rain and mud. Wading through muck to find a solution, All you can think about is being cold, wet, and stuck. Because misery loves company, the team is stuck, too. Here are two ways to snap out of it: ðŸ”‘ Attack the problem as a team. Ask: How can we solve this today? Use all that untapped genius on your team. ðŸ”‘ Bring your purpose to the surface. Remember why you are here. Purpose is the fuel that solves the seemingly impossible. Last weekend I led a volunteer trail crew on a mission to repair a badly damaged section of the PCT. It was 45 degrees and raining hard all day. Fun. It took the smarts and heavy physical labor of all 8 of us to plan and execute the repair on the edge of a steep ravine. We all earned our pizza and beer that night. I found a rock that reminded me why we were all there on a cold, rainy Sunday: Team and purpose. Team and purpose can get you out of the muck every time. #team #purpose #leadership #problemsolving"
