        "text": "ROSEMONT, Ill. – Purdue University basketball center Zach Edey has been selected as the 2023-24 Big Ten Conference Jesse Owens Male Athlete of the Year, and University of Iowa basketball guard Caitlin Clark has been recognized as the 2023-24 Big Ten Conference Female Athlete of the Year, the conference announced Thursday.\n\nEdey is the third Boilermaker student-athlete to earn Big Ten Jesse Owens Male Athlete of the Year honors, joining diver David Boudia in 2011 and basketball’s Glenn Robinson in 1994. Edey also joins former Ohio State wrestler Kyle Snyder, the 2017 and 2018 honoree, as the only repeat winners.\n\nEdey is also eighth basketball student-athlete chosen as Big Ten Jesse Owens Male Athlete of the Year and the first since Iowa’s Luka Garza in 2021. In addition to Edey, Robinson and Garza, the other basketball recipients of the Big Ten Jesse Owens Male Athlete of the Year have been Indiana’s Steve Alford (1987), Michigan’s Glen Rice (1989), Ohio State’s Evan Turner (2010), and Michigan State’s Draymond Green (2012) and Denzel Valentine (2016).\n\nLikewise, Clark joins field hockey standout Kristy Gleason in 1994 and basketball great Megan Gustafson in 2019 as award winners from Iowa and becomes the third repeat winner in the award’s 42-year history, joining Wisconsin’s Suzy Favor and Indiana’s Lilly King.\n\nThis marks the 10th time a basketball student-athlete has captured the Big Ten Female Athlete of the Year award. Along with the selections of Clark and Gustafson, other basketball recipients have been Purdue’s Joy Holmes (1991), MaChelle Joseph (1992), Stephanie White (1999) and Katie Douglas (2001), Penn State’s Kelly Mazzante (2004), Ohio State’s Jessica Davenport (2007), and Minnesota’s Rachel Banham (2016).\n\nAfter posting one of the most-statistically dominant seasons in college basketball history in 2022-23, Edey improved on it in 2023-24. Edey averaged 25.2 points, 12.2 rebounds, 2.2 blocks and 2.0 assists and shot 62.3 percent from the field and 71.1 percent from the free throw line, while leading the Boilermakers to their first Final Four since 1980 and NCAA championship game appearance since 1969. He is the only player in NCAA history to average at least 25.0 points, 12.0 rebounds, 2.0 blocks and 2.0 assists per game.\n\nA 7-4 center from Toronto, Edey swept all six major National Player of the Year awards for the second straight year, becoming the first player since UCLA’s Bill Walton (1972, 1973) to accomplish the feat. His 12 major National Player of the Year honors are the second most in NCAA history, behind only Ralph Sampson’s 14. For the second consecutive year, Edey also received the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award given to the nation’s top center and the Pete Newell Award given to the nation’s top post player.\n\nEdey joins Elvin Hayes in 1968 as the only players in NCAA history to record at least 983 points and 474 rebounds in a season and becomes the first player to lead the country in points and rebounds since Hank Gathers did so in 1989.\n\nEdey was at his best during Purdue’s 2024 NCAA Tournament run. His 177 points in the NCAA Tournament were the third most in March Madness tournament history. Edey became the first player since 1975 to have at least 30 points, 20 rebounds, two assists and two blocks in an NCAA Tournament game, when he did so against Grambling in the first round. Edey’s 37 points in the NCAA Championship game were also the fourth most in title-game history and the most since 1978.\n\nClark was named the consensus National Player of the Year in 2023-24, earning 12 National Player of the Year accolades. The West Des Moines, Iowa native was also recently honored as recipient of the 2024 Honda Cup Award winner and named Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year for the second consecutive year.\n\nClark led the nation in 10 statistical categories, including 31.6 points per game, 8.9 assists per game, 201 three-pointers made, and six triple-doubles, while leading Iowa to a 34-5 record and its second consecutive Big Ten regular season and tournament titles and a return trip to the NCAA championship game.\n\nIn addition to her third consecutive Big Ten Tournament Most Valuable Player honor, Clark was a unanimous All-Big Ten First Team selection, becoming the first Iowa women’s basketball player to earn four First Team All-Big Ten honors.\n\nClark is the only player in NCAA DI men’s or women’s basketball history to lead her conference in scoring and assists in four consecutive seasons and the first Division-I player to surpass 3,800 points, 1,000 assists, and 950 rebounds in a career. She is the first Division I player to notch back-to-back 1,000 point seasons and the sixth to collect more than 1,000 career assists.\n\nThis season, Clark recorded 1,234 points, breaking Kelsey Plum’s NCAA single season scoring mark, en route to collecting 3,951 points throughout her career, surpassing “Pistol” Pete Maravich as the NCAA’s men’s or women’s all-time leading scorer. Clark also owns the NCAA’s all-time field goals mark of 1,293.\n\nClark’s 59 games with at least 30 points are the most in men’s or women’s basketball over the last 25 seasons, while her 20 games with at least 30 points and 10 assists are 18 more than any other women’s basketball players during the same span.\n\nEdey and Clark were among a high-powered field of 28 nominees (one male and one female per Big Ten school) that included eight national champions, 26 All-Americans, 15 conference champions, 12 conference Players of the Year and nine standouts who collected at least one national player of the year accolade.\n\nThe Big Ten Conference has recognized a Jesse Owens Male Athlete of the Year since 1982 and first honored a Female Athlete of the Year in 1983. The Big Ten Athletes of the Year are selected by a panel of conference media members from nominations submitted by each institution.\n\nThe complete list of 2023-24 Athlete of the Year nominations, as well as the list of all-time winners for each award, can be found below.\n\n2023-24 BIG TEN ATHLETE OF THE YEAR NOMINEES Illinois: Terrence Shannon Jr., basketball; Rose Yeboah, track & field\n\nIndiana: Carson Tyler, swimming & diving; Anna Peplowski, swimming & diving\n\nIowa: Real Woods, wrestling; Caitlin Clark, basketball\n\nMaryland: Ajax Zappitello, lacrosse; Emily Sterling, lacrosse\n\nMichigan: Blake Corum, football; Kari Miller, tennis\n\nMichigan State: Heath Baldwin, track & field; Skyla Schulte, gymnastics\n\nMinnesota: Isaiah Salazar, wrestling; Vivi Del Angel, swimming & diving\n\nNebraska: Darius Luff, track & field; Eleanor Dale, soccer\n\nNorthwestern: Daniel Svärd, Golf; Lauren Wadas, field hockey\n\nOhio State: JJ Tracy, tennis; Jacy Sheldon, basketball\n\nPenn State: Aaron Brooks, wrestling; Bridget Nemeth, softball\n\nPurdue: Zach Edey, basketball; Eva Hudson, volleyball\n\nRutgers: Josh Kuroda-Grauer, baseball; Chloe Timberg, track & field\n\nWisconsin: Kyle McClellan, ice hockey; Sarah Franklin, volleyball\n\nBIG TEN JESSE OWENS MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNERS\n\n1982 - Jim Spivey, Indiana, cross country/track & field\n\n1983 - Ed Banach, Iowa, wrestling\n\n1984 - Sunder Nix, Indiana, track & field\n\n1985 - Barry Davis, Iowa, wrestling\n\n1986 - Chuck Long, Iowa, football\n\n1987 - Steve Alford, Indiana, basketball\n\n1988 - Jim Abbott, Michigan, baseball\n\n1989 - Glen Rice, Michigan, basketball\n\n1990 - Anthony Thompson, Indiana, football\n\n1991 - Mike Barrowman, Michigan, swimming\n\n1992 - Desmond Howard, Michigan, football\n\n1993 - John Roethlisberger, Minnesota, gymnastics\n\n1994 - Glenn Robinson, Purdue, basketball\n\n1995 - Tom Dolan, Michigan, swimming\n\n1996 - Eddie George, Ohio State, football\n\n1997 - Blaine Wilson, Ohio State, gymnastics\n\n1998 - Charles Woodson, Michigan, football\n\n1999 - Luke Donald, Northwestern, golf\n\n2000 - Ron Dayne, Wisconsin, football\n\n2001 - Ryan Miller, Michigan State, ice hockey\n\n2002 - Jordan Leopold, Minnesota, ice hockey\n\n2003 - Amer Delic, Illinois, tennis & Matt Lackey, Illinois, wrestling\n\n2004 - Damion Hahn, Minnesota, wrestling\n\n2005 - Luis Vargas, Penn State, gymnastics\n\n2006 - Peter Vanderkaay, Michigan, swimming\n\n2007 - Cole Konrad, Minnesota, wrestling\n\n2008 - Brent Metcalf, Iowa, wrestling\n\n2009 - Jake Herbert, Northwestern, wrestling\n\n2010 - Evan Turner, Ohio State, basketball\n\n2011 - David Boudia, Purdue, diving\n\n2012 - Draymond Green, Michigan State, basketball\n\n2013 - Derek Drouin, Indiana, track & field\n\n2014 - David Taylor, Penn State, wrestling\n\n2015 - Logan Stieber, Ohio State, wrestling\n\n2016 - Denzel Valentine, Michigan State, basketball\n\n2017 - Kyle Snyder, Ohio State, wrestling\n\n2018 - Kyle Snyder, Ohio State, wrestling\n\n2019 - Bo Nickal, Penn State, wrestling\n\n2020 - Chase Young, Ohio State, football\n\n2021 - Luka Garza, Iowa, basketball\n\n2022 - Gable Steveson, Minnesota, wrestling\n\n2023 - Zach Edey, Purdue, basketball\n\n2024 – Zach Edey, Purdue, basketball"
