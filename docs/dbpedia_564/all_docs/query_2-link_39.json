        "text": "Details:\n\nOn Saturday, November 24, 1973, at CNE stadium in Toronto the Saint Mary’s University Huskies football team were crowned national champions of university football in Canada and winners of the College Bowl, now referred to as the Vanier Cup.\n\nA convincing 14-6 win over the McGill Redmen was led by a veteran Huskie defense, the running game of Angelo Santucci as well as the offensive line and the kicking game of Ken Clark (Vanier Cup MVP). A torrential rain throughout the game limited the explosive Huskie passing game. Co-captains Fraser MacDonald and Ken Clark accepted the school’s first Vanier Cup trophy.\n\nA week earlier, Saturday November 17th, one of the biggest upsets in Canadian football history took place at a sold out Huskies Stadium in Halifax. The undefeated and number 1 ranked team Wilfred Laurier University Golden Hawks came to town as a three touchdown favorite over the AUFC Champion Huskies. The previous week in the Ontario final they destroyed the Ottawa Gee Gees 55-1. The Laurier team was laden with 5th year seniors and several former CFL professionals. The AUFC conference in 1973 was the only conference that had four year eligibility. In the 1972 Atlantic Bowl Laurier defeated the Huskies 50-17.\n\nIn one of the most exciting and hard-fought games, the Huskies marched 75 yards in the last three minutes with all-star quarterback Bill Robinson hitting key passes to tight ends Steve Telfer and Keith Hotchkiss before finding all-star Ken Clark in the end zone for the dramatic go-ahead touchdown. In the final minutes of the game the defense stepped up and ended the game in the dying seconds with a fumble recovery by defensive tackle Dave White.\n\nThe 1973 Atlantic Bowl victory climaxed a great season even before the Vanier Cup, having the Huskies and their 21 veterans finally win the Atlantic Bowl after losing the two previous years. A statement game to the rest of Canada. The Huskies finished first in the conference and defeated the UPEI Panthers 21-7 in the AUFC Championship game. A dominant defense led by Ralph Panzullo’s two interceptions shut down the Panthers offense while quarterback Bill Robinson rushed for three touchdowns. Earlier in the season the Huskies defeated the number two ranked Ottawa Gee Gees 23-21 in an exhibition game at Huskie Stadium.\n\nThe 1973 season showed the strength, grit, experience, and outstanding athleticism of this team. Head coach Al Keith was an amazing recruiter, a young and dynamic leader who was ahead of his time in offensive football. Dr. Dave Murphy assisted Coach Keith in running the offence. Defensive coaches Gord “Spook” MacLeod and Dougie Wright brought their Navy experience and wisdom, and coordinated amazing defensive schemes to match the toughness and athleticism of their players. The linebacker core of Fraser MacDonald, Roy Kendall, Rodney Allison, Doug Wasson, and Whip Watson were hard hitters and always in the right position. The secondary was experienced, athletic, and were led by the shut-down corners Ray Romano and Brian Burgess. Ralph Panzullo, Cliff Pelham, Jim Browne, Joe Simatovic, Henri Mayer, and Peter Grandy were ball hawks and very smart players. The defensive line were led inside by veteran Dave White and Mike Riley that stopped the inside run game. Ends Tony Cipollini, Larry Bridges, and Peter Miller pressured from the outside. They were key in the Atlantic Bowl victory.\n\nThe kicking game was the best in the country and that was Ken Clark. Leading the NFC in punting a few years later with the LA Rams verified that. The Saint Mary’s offense was explosive and record setting. An all-star receiver core was led by tight ends Steve Telfer (led in receptions and yards) and Keith Hotchkiss, wide receivers all-star Ken Clark, speedster Mike Kirkpatrick, and sure handed Bruce Hopkins. Three-time MVP quarterback Bill Robinson aired it out. Rick Lewis backed up the important quarterback position. The multi-dimensional offence had an in-your-face running game led slashing all-star halfback Angelo Santucci, the hard nose fullback John Matkowski, and elusive tailback AJ Marinari. The offensive line was a unique story. The guards and center were small, undersized, but exceptionally tough and quick. Inside Mike Curry, Gord Fumerton, Buzzy Theriault, Dave Faryniuk, and Jimmy Rodgers were outstanding in protection as well as the run game. On the outside the tackles were big and athletic. Rookie sensation Hector Pothier, Halifax native Frank Yakimchuk, and Peter Miller protected the Huskies outside.\n\nThe 1973 Huskies were a well-balanced, athletic, veteran group that had a strong will to win from top to bottom. Their national championship gave notice to the rest of Canada.\n\nThe team was also supported by team trainer Richard Bishop and team managers Dave McCormick, Dave Townsend, and John Landry, as well as team Doctor Dr. David Petrie.\n\nThe last chapter in the team story was the individual successes of the players had that season, their career at Saint Mary’s and afterwards:\n\n19 players were drafted, signed, or attended CFL or NFL training camps.\n\nFirst Round CFL Draft picks included Mike Riley (Hamilton), Angelo Santucci (Hamilton), Steve Telfer (Toronto), and Fraser MacDonald (Calgary).\n\n1973 AUFC All-Stars included Ken Clark (wide receiver), Bill Robinson (quarterback), Mike Curry (Center), Steve Telfer (tight end), Doug Wasson (linebacker), Brian Burgess (safety), Frank Yakimchuk (tackle), Angelo Santucci (halfback), Hector Pothier (tackle), and Fraser MacDonald (linebacker)\n\n1973 AUFC MVP Bill Robinson (71-72-73)\n\n1973 AUFC Most Outstanding Player Ken Clark\n\n1973 Vanier Cup MVP Ken Clark\n\n1973 CIAU All-Canadians Ken Clark and Fraser MacDonald\n\n1975 JP Metras Trophy Award – Hector Pothier, top University lineman in Canada\n\nCFL Grey Cup Winners:\n\nAngelo Santucci -Edmonton 1978-1982 – 5 Grey Cups\n\nHector Pothier -Edmonton_1978-1982 and 1987 – 6 Grey Cups\n\nBill Robinson- Ottawa 1976\n\nCFL ALL PRO SELECTIONS- Hector Pothier, 1981\n\nGREY CUP OUTSTANDING CANADIAN- Angelo Santucci, 1978\n\nAttended NFL training camps: Brian Burgess, Mike Kirkpatrick, and Ray Romano\n\nMike Riley played in the CFL with Hamilton and Ottawa.\n\nKen Clark played in the CFL with Toronto, Saskatchewan, Hamilton and Ottawa. After leaving Saint Mary’s, Ken punted in the World Football league with the Portland storm and in 1979 punted for the NFC Champions Los Angeles Rams, losing in the Superbowl to the Pittsburg Steelers."
