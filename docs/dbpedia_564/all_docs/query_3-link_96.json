        "text": "Former Wisconsin wrestling head coach Barry Davis has a new gig: an assistant coaching role with Navy.\n\nNavy head coach Cary Kolat made the announcement Wednesday. He’s been the head coach of the Midshipmen since March of 2020.\n\nDavis, who is a legend on and off the mat, is one of the bigger hires to a staff this wrestling offseason.\n\n“With the rapid changes in recruiting trends over the past few years, I’m excited to announce that coach Barry Davis will be spearheading our recruitment with the Naval Academy wrestling program. Barry has a wealth of experience as both an athlete and a coach,” Kolat said in a release.\n\n“He has been an assistant coach for Dan Gable at the University of Iowa and then eventually led his own program at the University of Wisconsin. Coach Davis will make a significant impact on our program. His addition to our coaching staff not only strengthens our team, but will enhance the experience of our athletes here at the Naval Academy. He will bring valuable contributions to our program and I’m excited to welcome him aboard.”\n\nDavis resigned from the Wisconsin head coaching position back in March of 2018 after 25 years at the helm. He was succeeded by Chris Bono.\n\n“I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Wisconsin,” Davis said at the time. “I’ve worked with lots of great people and many tremendous student-athletes. This University will always hold a special place in my heart.”\n\nDavis, a member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, coached 26 All-Americans, eight Big Ten champions and three NCAA champions while at Wisconsin. He was named NWCA National Coach of the Year in 2010 after leading the Badgers to a fourth-place finish at the NCAA championships.\n\nDavis was Wisconsin’s all-time winningest head coach, going 227-167-11.\n\nDavis began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, Iowa, during the 1986 and 1987 campaigns. He later served as an assistant coach with the Hawkeyes from 1988-92 before heading to Madison.\n\nDuring his coaching tenure in Iowa City, he helped Iowa win three national championships (1986, ’91, ’92) and seven-straight Big Ten titles (1986, ’87, ’88, ’89, ’90, ’91, ’92).\n\nDavis was a three-time NCAA champion and four-time All-American when he wrestled for Iowa. Following a Gold Medal at the 1983 Pan American Games as a member of Team USA, Davis won a Silver Medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\nHe also won a Bronze and Silver Medal at the 1986 and ‘87 World Championships. While he did not medal in 1988, Davis was a member of the Olympic Team once again."
