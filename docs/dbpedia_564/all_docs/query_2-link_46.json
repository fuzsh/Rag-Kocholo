Florida State played defense as though it merited a better fate, but an interceptions-plagued offense indicated nothing of that sort as the Seminoles fell to Wake Forest in a football opener here Saturday night 9-7.\n\nChuck Ramsey's 42-yard field goal with three seconds left dealt Florida State its first opening-game loss since 1967.\n\nThe Seminoles were backed up most of the long evening, with Ramsey's booming punts contributing considerably to the fact.\n\nBut they had moved in front on their first series of the last half, 7-6, and held that lead until Ramsey boomed the big one through.\n\nFor the start the Seminoles shifted Hodges Mitchell to fullback, from his normal tailback slot, and opened with soph Bobby McKinnon at the tailback position. It was a clear evening following a fair, sunshiny day. Friday's rain had quickly dispersed.\n\nThe new stadium of 31,000 capacity was a little more than half full. There were more Florida State rooters on hand than one might have anticipated. About 75 showed up for a pre-game gathering.\n\nWake Forest got first turn with the football, after winning the coin toss. The Seminoles led with a freshman Collis Dennison kicking off - to the 10. Wake ran it back to the 29.\n\nThree runs were short, to the 38, and a 40-yard punt put the Seminoles at their 22. Florida State tried three runs, got to the 28 before Joe Downey punted to the 34.\n\nA 14-yard pass to Ken Griffith gained the 50. On third down at the 47 a screen pass to Clayton Heath picked up 13, to the 33. Heath shot up the middle for a dozen more yards. QB Andy Carlton kept, struggled to the 14, and Frank Harsh's running led to a first down at the eight.\n\nThe Seminoles stiffened, held at the seven. Chuck Ramsey came in and kicked a 24-yard field goal for 3-0.\n\nWith the help of an offsides penalty and a short pass to Mitchell, the Seminoles struggled to the 37, but no further. Downey's 47-yard punt backed Wake to its 16.\n\nA motion penalty nullified Heath's 23-yard run, and eventually the Deacons kicked from the 16. Dave McGinn, back to catch the punt, got racked before having a chance to catch it, and Wake was penalized 15 yards for interfering. That gave the Seminoles a shot from the Wake 40.\n\nMitchell gained five. But two Billy Sexton passes missed as the quarter ended.\n\nAhmet Askin entered for a 51-yard try at a field goal. Short.\n\nOn third and one, Greg Johnson and John Murphy stopped Heath short on a plunge. Ramsey's 52-yard punt placed the Seminoles at their 23.\n\nA pass to Mitchell for nine and Doug Glosson's plunge got a first down. But on a play when a pass bounced off an intended receiver and was plucked out of the air by center Rocky Saldana, the Seminoles got penalized 15. Soon Downey punted to the Wake 35.\n\nOn third and seven, Bill Armstrong, who had just come in at quarterback for the home team, shot a screen pass to Heath, who rambled for 15 to FSU's 47. The Seminoles held, and Ramsey's punt was a bit short, to the 22.\n\nOn third and two, FSU faked a run, with Sexton slipping back and throwing - but John Harris happened to be in the right spot for Wake, and the end intercepted at the 40.\n\nSoon heath plunged for 14 to the 26. Tom Fehring grabbed a 16-yard pass at the 10. Harsh hit to the seven, but following passes were broken up.\n\nRamsey kicked another 24-yard field goal, making it 6-0.\n\nQuickly the Deacons got another chance. Tony Barnes, a freshman, stole Sexton's first-down pass and hustled it 10 yards to FSU's 31.\n\nA busted play and two incomplete passes left Wake at the 29. Ramsey tried for three points from 46 yards out. Wide.\n\nThe half ran out, with the Seminoles standing fourth down at the 30.\n\nAt this stage Florida State showed just 53 yards of offense, 37 of it on the ground, of which Mitchell had got 33 - plus all 16 of the passing yards on two receptions.\n\nBy comparison, Wake had totaled 140 on offense, with 81 running. Heath had accounted for 90, on 46 rushing, 44 receiving.\n\nThe Seminoles had just two first downs.\n\nJoe Goldsmith wheeled with the third-quarter kickoff from the goal to the 29.\n\nFirst play, Goldsmith raced deep and hauled in a 39-yard bomb from Sexton.\n\nMitchell got caught for a loss of two, but Goldsmith pulled in another throw, at the 13. Mitchell got a couple. A pass missed then Jim Everett caught one just over the five. It came to fourth and one, and the Seminoles went for it.\n\nThe play was a quick pitchout to Mitchell, who scored easily. Askin put a point on the board for a 7-6 FSU lead.\n\nThen Felix Glasco danced 62 yards with the kickoff before Buzzy Lewis bumped him out of bounds at the FSU 34.\n\nBut two runs and a pass didn't get it. Ramsey's 45-yard bid for a field goal was short.\n\nA 21-yard pass to Everett and a 13-yarder to Glosson led the Seminoles to the Wake 46.\n\nThen, after a penalty, Rich Severs intercepted a Sexton toss, and presented the Deacons another chance inside FSU territory, at the 47.\n\nAfter Heath got a first down at the 34, the Deacons failed to make it on a fourth-and-two run from the 26.\n\nThe Seminoles couldn't maneuver. Downey punted to the 35. Carlton got Wake to FSU's 46 on a pass, but Randy Coffield soon nailed the quarterback for a 13-yard loss, blunting that bid. Ramsey punted into the end zone.\n\nSexton's 38-yard throw to Ed Davis lifted the Tribe to its 47.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 0 0 7 0 7 Wake Forest 3 3 0 3 9\n\n1st 0- 3 Opp, 24, field goal, 9:59 2nd 0- 3 Ahmet Askin, 42, field goal failed 0- 6 Opp, 24, field goal, 2:24 0- 6 Opp, 36, field goal failed 3rd 7- 6 Hodges Mitchell, 5, run (Ahmet Askin, kick), 12:07 7- 6 Opp, 45, field goal failed 4th 7- 6 Opp, 38, field goal failed 7- 9 Opp, 41, field goal, 1:11\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 9 15 Rushes-yards 38-97 39-116 Passing 163 173 Att-Comp-Int 21-11-4 35-14-1 Total Yards 59-260 74-289 Punt Returns 1--6 2-3 Kickoff Returns 3-60 2-81 Interception Ret. 1-0 4-27 Fumble Returns 0-0 2-0 Punts 6-37.3 7-40.4 Fumbles-Lost 2-2 0-0 Penalties-Yds 4-30 5-63 Time of Posession 27:35 32:25 Attendance 18,000 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Hodges Mitchell 25 83 1 13 Doug Glosson 2 18 0 15 Bobby McKinnon 7 4 0 5 Billy Sexton 4 -8 0 1 --------------------------------------------- FSU 38 97 1 15 Opp 39 116 0 28 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Joe Goldsmith 2 60 0 39 Jimmy Everett 2 26 0 21 Ed Davis 1 26 0 26 Mike Allen 2 19 0 11 Hodges Mitchell 2 16 0 16 Doug Glosson 2 16 0 13 --------------------------------------------- FSU 11 163 0 39 Opp 14 173 0 16 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Billy Sexton 11 20 4 163 0 39 Joe Downey 0 1 0 0 0 0 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 11 21 4 163 0 39 Opp 14 35 1 173 0 16 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- David McGinn 1 -6 0 -6 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 -6 0 Opp 2 3 0 6 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Joe Goldsmith 2 37 0 29 Hodges Mitchell 1 23 0 23 --------------------------------------------- FSU 3 60 0 29 Opp 2 81 0 62 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Joe Downey 6 224 43 ---------------------------------------- FSU 6 224 43 Opp 7 283 49 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Phil Arnold 9 2 11 . . . . . . . . .

Kansas imposed the scoring blackout, 28-0, in a less than artistic intersectional battle that sent many of an equally disappointing 19,280 Doak Campbell Stadium crowd home early.\n\nNot since midway through the 1965 season when North Carolina State applied the whitewash, 3-0, have the Seminoles failed to dent the scoreboard.\n\nNever has the nation's leading passing team over the past half decade looked so inept. \"The chorus line offense,\" mumbled one Seminole fan. \"You know. One-two-three-kick.\"\n\nWhile FSU's offense turned the ball over to the Big Eight Conference Jayhawks on eight occasions - five intercepts and three fumbles - the Seminole defense had their shining moments averting what could have been the worst setback in tribal lore.\n\nTwo of those fumble recoveries by KU linebacker Odell Weidner were turned into touchdowns by veteran quarterback David Jaynes, who wound up with 15 of 28 for 168 yards and two TDs, clearly winning the passing duel against the one-two FSU punch of Billy Sexton and Mark Orlando.\n\nThe touchdown makers were bruising running back Delvin Williams (15 carrier, 89 yards), touted wide receiver Bruce Adams and sophomore back Luvurne Smith.\n\nWilliams broke the scoring ice with 3:11 remaining in the first quarter on a 24-yard tackle-busting run, running over three Seminoles in the process. His second score, following a Hodges Mitchell fumble, was a twisting seven-yard scamper with a Jaynes option pitchout.\n\nJaynes split defenders Chris Griffin and Phil Cahoon on a perfect 24-yard scoring pass minutes into the final period after Weidner's second recovery. Jaynes teamed with Smith on a 15-yard swing pass two exchange of series later, a tiring Seminole secondary finally wilting under the oppressive number of KU offensive plays.\n\nOnly once did the Seminoles resemble an offensive team, Sexton guiding an aborted length-of-the-field drive at the onset of the third quarter. Steve Taylor took the wind out of the Seminoles' sails with an end zone interception that wiped out a 42-yard Sexton-to-Ed Davis big gainer that had the look of confidence about it.\n\nSexton and Orlando wound up with 17-for-26 and 134 but nothing to show for it, a factor that greatly disturbed both Larry Jones, the befuddled Seminole coach, and Sexton who is used to having better days.\n\n\"I'm definitely disappointed,\" snapped an unhappy Jones afterward. \"We knew Mitchell was hurt and (Mike) Davison was not ready to play but we still should have moved the ball better. I'm disappointed we didn't generate anything. That really bothers me. I haven't seen much to get excited about so far.\"\n\nSexton seconded the motion. \"I'm disappointed, very much so,\" said the lanky senior. \"It's just a bunch of intangibles that are hard to explain. You've got to make something happen and that's my job. And I didn't do it.\"\n\nA lack of intangibles or whatever, the eight turnovers plus some consistently favorable KU field position gave the 2-0 Jayhawks an opportunity to start at the FSU 15, 46, 32, 49, 47, 33, 32, 36, 35 and 18 plus once on their own 45. It also kept the tiring FSU defense on the field for 88 plays while their offensive buddies were handling the pigskin on only 52 occasions.\n\nThus the 28 points were misleading to some headhunters like John Murphy, who blocked a field goal, Jim Malkiewicz, who led a goal-line stand, and numerous Seminole defenders who came up with enough big plays to keep the final score respectable.\n\n\"When you give them the ball at your end of the field, the percentage of your chances of stopping them go way down. Usually the offense will score, some studies show, three out of four times,\" offered Jones. \"I was proud of them (defense) at times but this is a team game and they simply have to come up with some bigger plays.\"\n\nThe defensive efforts simply were not enough as the offense sputtered to a decade low of 151 yards.\n\nJones offered no excuses although he knew since Monday that Mitchell, his No. 1 runner, had a lame ankle that would keep him at half speed, and Davison was still a question mark with his torn thigh muscle.\n\n\"We wanted to play them because of their leadership and experience,\" he explained. \"But it just didn't work out.\"\n\nWhich brings Seminole fans back to more Tribe trivia. If there were 80 games played between blankings, when was the last time an FSU team stood 0-2? Would you believe 1967, the year some followers think was the best squad ever? FSU started 0-2-1 that autumn, the tie with Alabama.\n\nFor Jones, however, there is no Alabama, just Miami, the team that knocked off nationally-ranked Texas.\n\n\"We just got off to a bad start,\" offered Jones. \"So we have to get back to work to get something accomplished now. We're not looking to next year or the year after. We want to do something now.\"\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Kansas 7 7 0 14 28 Florida State 0 0 0 0 0\n\n1st 0- 7 Opp, 24, run (kick), 3:11 2nd 0-14 Opp, 7, run (kick), 14:12 0-14 Opp, 30, field goal blocked by John Murphy 4th 0-21 Opp, 28, pass (kick), 14:11 0-28 Opp, 15, pass (kick), 9:42\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 7 18 Rushes-yards 26-17 54-191 Passing 134 176 Att-Comp-Int 27-9-5 32-16-1 Total Yards 53-151 86-367 Punt Returns 2-0 4-39 Kickoff Returns 4-96 1-25 Interception Ret. 1-0 5-52 Fumble Returns 1-0 3-0 Punts 7-40.0 8-38.3 Fumbles-Lost 4-3 2-1 Penalties-Yds 2-5 6-70 Attendance 19,240 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mike Davison 6 7 0 4 Bobby McKinnon 2 7 0 4 Hodges Mitchell 8 4 0 3 Rudy Thomas 1 1 0 1 Mark Orlando 2 0 0 1 Billy Sexton 7 -2 0 17 --------------------------------------------- FSU 26 17 0 17 Opp 54 191 2 24t Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mike Shumann 4 65 0 22 Ed Davis 1 41 0 41 Mike Allen 1 13 0 13 Jimmy Everett 1 7 0 7 Mike Davison 1 5 0 5 Joe Goldsmith 1 3 0 3 --------------------------------------------- FSU 9 134 0 41 Opp 16 176 2 28t Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Billy Sexton 7 22 4 116 0 41 Mark Orlando 2 5 1 18 0 13 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 9 27 5 134 0 41 Opp 16 32 1 176 2 28t Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- David McGinn 2 0 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 0 0 Opp 4 39 0 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Joe Goldsmith 3 75 0 Rudy Thomas 1 21 0 21 --------------------------------------------- FSU 4 96 0 21 Opp 1 25 0 25 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Joe Downey 7 280 55 ---------------------------------------- FSU 7 280 55 Opp 8 306 44 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Randy Kaiser . . . . . 1- 0 . . . . . .

At the same time, the Seminoles gained some maturity and respect.\n\n\"We didn't beat ourselves,\" admitted a downcast but proud Seminole boss Larry Jones afterward. \"That was our first objective. To cut down on our mistakes. We wanted to make Miami beat us and I think we made them do that with that fourth quarter drive. They are so big and physical and that Thompson is, well, something else.\"\n\nTrailing 10-7 and seemingly caught in a maze of mistakes that are reminiscent of the past seven Seminole victories in succession, Miami awoke with a blazing fury, ignited by a successful fourth-and-one gamble at its own 37.\n\nFor practical purposes that was the ball game. Thompson followed a fanatical block by Alan Reynaud for nine yards and a first down at the Hurricane 46.\n\nThen it was Thompson for 10. After a 'Cane first down at the FSU 32, it was Thompson for 27 more. A penalty pushed Miami back to the 10 but it was Thompson to the six, Thompson to the 4, then Thompson on a super second effort ripping into the end zone like a relentless shark smelling blood.\n\nIt was the culminating blow to seven years of Seminole success but at the same time provided these same Seminoles with impetus which could produce happier results in the near future.\n\nFSU's impetus was offensive execution and a myriad of his plays on defense which included two fumble recoveries by Hialeah sophomore Randy Coffield, a pass interception by Buzzy Lewis and a blocked field goal by Leesburg sophomore Greg Johnson.\n\n\"We just aren't physical enough to beat a team like Miami,\" said defensive coordinator Gene Henderson afterward, \"But I can't complain about our effort. We showed a lot of progress and that's a start in the right direction.\"\n\nFor the 0-3 Seminoles, mired in the worst beginning since 1952 - ironically the same year FSU played a similar amount of freshman on the varsity - the effort sustained brought more locker room smiles than tears and quarterback Billy Sexton, who ran and passed with poise, felt the close loss \"would bring us even closer together.\"\n\nSexton directed a 60-yard, 12-play third-period drive which gave the Seminoles their 10-7 lead, a perfectly executed effort that controlled the football for 6 ½ minutes and gave 22,378 Doak Campbell Stadium fans high hopes on a gritty two-yard slam into the teeth of the beefy Hurricane line after Sexton set it with a bullet 14-yard pass to hustling Joe Goldsmith.\n\nEarlier, with just 6:40 left in the first half, Ahmet Askin had ended a 110-minute, six-quarter Seminole scoring drought with a 51-yard field goal, a side-winding beauty that was the second longest three-pointer in Seminole history. Ironically, Grant Guthrie's record 53-yarder also came against the Hurricanes.\n\nBut as FSU's Jones was to point out later, \"This is a game of mistakes, inches, seconds and efforts and I think you saw that out there today.\"\n\nOne of those mistakes Jones referred to was a costly 15-yard roughing the kicker penalty assessed against Oviedo's Steve Bratton with 3:09 remaining in the first half maintaining Miami ball possession at the Seminole 39. Instead of FSU starting from its own 28 on the punt, the 214 pound Thompson had another crack at the Seminole defense.\n\nThompson worked the ball to just inches from the goal line and quarterback Coy Hall barely nudged it across for a touchdown that gave Miami a 7-3 halftime lead. Only 10 seconds were left on the clock before intermission.\n\nIf there was a disappointment for Jones, other than the ultimate football fate of defeat, it was the fact his club did not get a final opportunity to pull out a victory.\n\n\"We didn't get the ball that one more time and that really hurt,\" said Jones, \"but I think you have to give Miami tremendous credit for that fact. It showed what a fine physical force they are by running out the final four minutes on the clock. This was definitely out best game. We cut down on mistakes but still had too many. We had great effort and you can't ask for more than that.\"\n\nUnless you would ask to find a Woody Thompson.\n\n\"Do you know where I can find one?\" grinned Jones. \"He's a great back, He scratched it out for them, gouged us and ran over us.\"\n\nHe ran over FSU for 119 yards in 24 runs and presented Pete Elliot with a prized 47th birthday present. He should have presented him with a backscratcher too. The itch had finally departed and Miami sighed in relief.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Miami 0 7 0 7 14 Florida State 0 3 7 0 10\n\n1st 0- 0 Opp, 44, field goal blocked by Greg Johnson, 0:53 2nd 3- 0 Ahmet Askin, 51, field goal, 6:40 3- 7 Opp, 1, run (kick), 0:10 3rd 10- 7 Hodges Mitchell, 1, run (Ahmet Askin, kick), 3:22 4th 10-14 Opp, 4, run (kick), 6:24\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 11 23 Rushes-yards 38-71 57-275 Passing 61 126 Att-Comp-Int 14-7-0 17-9-1 Total Yards 52-132 74-401 Punt Returns 2-7 4-25 Kickoff Returns 3-35 3-53 Interception Ret. 1-0 0-0 Fumble Returns 2-0 0-0 Punts 6-42.5 2-35.5 Fumbles-Lost 0-0 4-2 Penalties-Yds 2-20 9-74 Time of Posession 25:37 34:23 Attendance 22,278 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Bobby McKinnon 13 27 0 5 Hodges Mitchell 14 26 1 10 Billy Sexton 8 9 0 15 Rudy Thomas 3 9 0 7 --------------------------------------------- FSU 38 71 1 15 Opp 57 275 2 27 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Joe Goldsmith 2 23 0 14 Mike Allen 1 19 0 19 Mike Shumann 1 9 0 9 Bobby McKinnon 2 6 0 13 Hodges Mitchell 1 4 0 4 --------------------------------------------- FSU 7 61 0 19 Opp 9 126 0 24 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Billy Sexton 7 14 0 61 0 19 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 7 14 0 61 0 19 Opp 9 17 1 126 0 24 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Greg Johnson 1 6 0 6 Mike Shumann 1 1 0 1 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 7 0 6 Opp 4 25 0 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Rudy Thomas 1 18 0 18 David Harper 1 11 0 11 Joe Goldsmith 1 6 0 6 --------------------------------------------- FSU 3 35 0 18 Opp 3 53 0 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Joe Downey 6 255 56 ---------------------------------------- FSU 6 255 56 Opp 2 71 39 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Buzzy Lewis . . . . . 1- 0 . . . . . .

FSU had time and the chance to spoil the Bear's night, but only got as far as the 20.\n\nOn fourth down, Sexton's pass for Ed Davis fell incomplete and the Seminole threat for all practical purposes, was over.\n\nBecause in the end it was the Seminoles' six turnovers - three fumbles and three interceptions - that designed their fall. The last ditch effort might have been valiant but without offensive consistency it was useless.\n\nPenalties, not offense, provided most of the football movement during the first period as neither Baylor nor Florida State was able to mount a drive.\n\nWith three minutes to go in the quarter, the falling flags of the officials had accounted for 96 yards in penalties - that was three more than FSU's total and 19 more than Baylor.\n\nFSU's deepest penetration was the Baylor 40 after Billy Sexton hit Joe Goldsmith on a 34-yard pass play, but Goldsmith fumbled as he was hit by cornerback Charles McClanahan and McClanahan came up with the ball for Baylor.\n\nBut the Bears didn't move it, and after four penalties punted to FSU and the Seminoles took over on their 17.\n\nStill, both offenses sputtered and it was not until 11:33 to go in the second period that Baylor was able to move toward the FSU goal. The TD was set up by an interception by Baylor's Lester Ealey, who snared Sexton's aerial when Goldsmith slipped down at the FSU 36.\n\nDespite a clipping penalty that pushed the Bears back to the FSU 46, it took only five plays for tailback Gary Lacy to crack the Seminole line for one yard and six points. Two big gains, one of 26 by Brian Kilgore on a reverse and a 17-yard sprint by Lacy, made it possible.\n\nAnd with 10:15 to play in the half Bubba Hicks put Baylor in front 7-0.\n\nFSU was unable to move on its next possession and on third and two from its own 33, Rudy Thomas fumbled and Dale Keohter recovered for Baylor at that spot.\n\nBaylor's Billy Wilson picked up seven, then three straight runs at the FSU line by fullback Pat McNeill got the Bears to the 13.\n\nThen with a first down at the 11, senior running back Godfrey White took a pitchout around right end for the touchdown. With 6:41 left, Hicks made it 14-0.\n\nThe Seminoles advanced only as far as midfield following the Baylor kickoff and punted deep to the Bears who wound up at the two-yard line. Ealey actually fielded the ball at the seven, but was driven backward five yards by Scott Meseroll, down fast on coverage.\n\nBaylor moved out to its own 35, but as White ripped up the middle, he was hit and fumbled to Meseroll at the 37. FSU battled back, determined to go into the dressing room with some points on the board.\n\nThe effort paid off. With 25 seconds left, Sexton passed to flanker Jim Everett for 12 yards and the score. Ahmet Askin converted and the Seminoles appeared to be making a game of it.\n\nStatistically, FSU and Baylor were even in first downs with seven apiece but Baylor had the edge in total offense - 199 to 166. Hodges Mitchell led the FSU ground attack with 48 yards in 14 carries, followed by Bobby McKinnon with 26. Sexton passed five times, completed two for 43 yards.\n\nFSU threatened at the start of the third quarter when freshman Detroit Reynolds recovered Godfrey White's fumble on the kickoff at the 40.\n\nSexton passed the Seminoles to well within striking distance, getting them down to the four. But the Bear defense would yield no more and forced Florida State to surrender the ball.\n\nThen it was FSU defense's turn. Baylor got only as far as the 11, and punted out to its own 43.\n\nSexton, spreading the Bear secondary out with his passing, appeared on the way to tying the score, but was intercepted at the four by Bear rover Tom Turnipseed. The pass, intended for Ed Beckman, the tight end, was deflected, and Turnipseed made a tumbling catch.\n\nThat was the second interception of a Sexton pass, and the fifth Seminole turnover. The other three were fumbles.\n\nThe contest moved down toward the last act which saw Sexton intercepted a third time, then Baylor dealt the Seminoles another blow when Lacy ripped 58 yards to the FSU seven, in the last seconds of period three.\n\nEarl Humes saved the TD, but with 14:16 to go in the game Lacy went nine yards to put the Bears in command.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 0 7 0 7 14 Baylor 0 14 0 7 21\n\n1st 0- 0 Opp, 55, field goal failed, 6:50 2nd 0- 7 Opp, 1, run (kick), 10:15 0-14 Opp, 11, run (kick), 6:41 7-14 Jimmy Everett, 12, pass from Billy Sexton (Ahmet Askin, kick), 0:17 4th 7-21 Opp, 9, run (kick), 14:16 14-21 Mike Allen, 56, pass from Billy Sexton (Ahmet Askin, kick), 6:13\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 14 12 Rushes-yards 45-183 54-307 Passing 179 45 Att-Comp-Int 29-12-3 8-4-0 Total Yards 74-362 62-352 Punt Returns 5-20 1--5 Kickoff Returns 4-64 2-46 Interception Ret. 0-0 3-1 Fumble Returns 3-0 3-0 Punts 6-38.2 9-36.7 Fumbles-Lost 4-3 4-3 Penalties-Yds 5-57 9-93 Attendance 29,000 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Hodges Mitchell 21 109 0 13 Bobby McKinnon 11 54 0 9 Rudy Thomas 6 19 0 7 Billy Sexton 7 1 0 11 --------------------------------------------- FSU 45 183 0 13 Opp 54 307 3 58 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mike Allen 1 57 1 57t Joe Goldsmith 1 31 0 31 Jimmy Everett 2 24 1 12t Ed Davis 2 24 0 13 Ed Beckman 2 16 0 10 Bobby McKinnon 2 15 0 11 Mike Shumann 2 12 0 7 --------------------------------------------- FSU 12 179 2 57t Opp 4 45 0 16 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Billy Sexton 12 29 3 179 2 57t ----------------------------------------------- FSU 12 29 3 179 2 57t Opp 4 8 0 45 0 16 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mike Shumann 5 20 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 5 20 0 Opp 1 -5 0 -5 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Joe Goldsmith 4 64 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 4 64 0 Opp 2 46 0 24 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Joe Downey 6 229 60 ---------------------------------------- FSU 6 229 60 Opp 9 330 55 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Meseroll . . . . . . . . 2- 0 . . .

Forget it.\n\nThe Seminoles were nothing more than an inept team as they lost 37-12 here Saturday afternoon to aggressive Mississippi State representatives that never before had beaten the Garnet and Gold.\n\nMississippi State was as good as Coach Larry Jones of FSU thought it might be on offense. The score could have been bigger.\n\nThough a loser of five straight this season, the Seminoles, for the first time, performed poorly on both offense and defense.\n\n\"We just weren't ready to play,\" Jones said afterward.\n\nIf the Seminoles had been \"ready to play,\" they might have put the visitors in an early hole, instead of vice versa, for they got a liberal share of \"breaks\" at the start.\n\n\"It was the worst start I've ever seen,\" said Jones.\n\nAfter holding off the Bulldogs at their 9-yard line, the Seminoles turned over the football three straight times on fumbles. Mississippi State scored after each of those fumbles and led 21-0 before the first quarter was over.\n\nThen, before a rather quiet turnout of 19,829 on this sunny afternoon, M-State put it out of reach, really, by scoring on their first series of the second quarter, for 28-0. On four consecutive series M-State got touchdowns.\n\nThe Bulldogs cut up Florida State's defense in a variety of ways, but notably with the running of big Wayne Jones, who whacked out 140 yards in a mere 16 carries. Rockey Felker was the spectacular quarterback that had been anticipated, passing for 152 yards and two touchdowns, running for 33 yards.\n\nFelker jammed a thumb on his throwing hand in the third quarter - there's a possibility it may be broken - and turned over the mop-up work to Mike Monaghan, who directed the team to a last-quarter field goal and touchdown.\n\nTrailing by so much so early, the Seminoles shucked their running game and threw repeatedly.\n\nBilly Sexton quarterbacked the first quarter and two plays of the second. Mark Orlando was in there the rest of the way. Sexton was 2-for-7 on his passing before departure. Orlando went 20-for-41, getting two intercepted, total 228 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nMike Shumann, the Tallahassee freshman, accounted for both FSU scores, on a 5-yard Orlando pass that narrowed the halftime score to 28-6, on a 37-yarder from Orlando that brought the Seminoles within 31-12 with 3:37 left. Saturday was Schumann's 18th birthday.\n\nWhile Shumann caught four passes for the day, Mike Allen collared eight.\n\nBut Florida State passing was not as good as the overall figures may lead some to surmise. M-State appeared vulnerable on defense. Both quarterbacks failed to hit with receivers wide open - and the receivers themselves showed some inconsistency, particularly in hanging onto balls that might have been retained.\n\nThe Seminoles ran Hodges Mitchell not a time in the last half. Also back in action, if not exactly fit, was Mike Davison, who looked at times as though he may soon be ready.\n\nMississippi State got those three early fumbles at FSU's 31, 24 and its own 44. Stan Murray scored the first TD from the four. The second came on Felker's 13-yard pass to Danny Malone, the third on Murray's 2-yard run with a pitchout.\n\nA bit later it was Felker throwing to All-American hopeful Bill Buckley for a TD on a 50-yard play. (Buckley got 154 yards out of six catches, scored the Bulldogs' last TD on a 33-yarder from Monaghan.)\n\n\"I think,\" said Bob Tyler, the new coach of the Mississippians in a possibly remarkable statement, \"FSU's young players did a good job. Just the fumbles hurt bad.\"\n\nNext week: homecoming for the Seminoles, versus Memphis State.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Mississippi State 21 7 0 9 37 Florida State 0 6 0 6 12\n\n1st 0- 0 Opp, 27, field goal failed, 11:33 0- 7 Opp, 4, run (kick), 6:22 0-14 Opp, 13, pass (kick), 4:03 0-21 Opp, 1, run (kick), 1:21 2nd 0-28 Opp, 50, pass (kick), 12:43 6-28 Mike Shumann, 5, pass from Mark Orlando (Mark Orlando, pass failed), 1:21 4th 6-31 Opp, 24, field goal, 14:19 12-31 Mike Shumann, 37, pass from Mark Orlando (Mark Orlando, pass failed), 3:37 12-37 Opp, 33, pass (kick failed), 2:09\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 21 19 Rushes-yards 25-45 52-255 Passing 247 221 Att-Comp-Int 48-22-2 18-12-0 Total Yards 73-292 70-476 Punt Returns 1-16 2-10 Kickoff Returns 6-138 2-38 Interception Ret. 0-0 2-3 Fumble Returns 0-0 3-0 Punts 6-39.0 4-43.8 Fumbles-Lost 4-3 4-0 Penalties-Yds 6-87 8-108 Time of Posession 29:45 30:55 Attendance 19,829 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Hodges Mitchell 8 42 0 13 Mike Davison 9 11 0 8 Mark Orlando 3 6 0 11 Bobby McKinnon 2 3 0 2 Billy Sexton 3 -17 0 2 --------------------------------------------- FSU 25 45 0 13 Opp 52 255 2 36 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mike Shumann 4 76 2 37t Mike Allen 8 68 0 18 Larry Jones 4 42 0 17 Hodges Mitchell 1 18 0 18 Joe Goldsmith 1 14 0 14 Ed Beckman 2 13 0 8 Mike Davison 1 13 0 13 Bobby McKinnon 1 3 0 3 --------------------------------------------- FSU 22 247 2 37t Opp 12 221 3 50t Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Mark Orlando 20 41 2 228 2 37t Billy Sexton 2 7 0 19 0 11 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 22 48 2 247 2 37t Opp 12 18 0 221 3 50t Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mike Shumann 1 16 0 16 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 16 0 16 Opp 2 10 0 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Joe Goldsmith 6 138 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 6 138 0 Opp 2 38 0 22 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Joe Downey 6 234 44 ---------------------------------------- FSU 6 234 44 Opp 4 175 62 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FSU 0 0 0 . . . . . . . . .

One lonesome, bittersweet yard.\n\nMemphis State's spunky defense, keyed by Florida-bred Van Anderson, stacked up Hodges Mitchell one yard shy of the goal line on two consecutive plays late in the third period Saturday.\n\nThe result was a 13-10 Tiger triumph, the sixth consecutive setback this season by FSU, the first Homecoming loss suffered at Doak Campbell Stadium in 11 years and the seventh straight loss over a two-year period for the long-suffering Seminoles who came oh, so very close.\n\nIt marked the fourth time among those six losses that these Seminoles fell by a touchdown or less but that was little consolation for Coach Larry Jones.\n\n\"They're all heartbreaking,\" he admitted, his face a mirror of frustration. \"It was a lousy call,\" Jones mourned, referring to Mitchell's last-gasp victory effort, \"and it was my call. Hodges was running good. Maybe we ran him once too often. I don't know. You always second guess. We had just run Hodge three times in there and didn't make it. It was that close.\"\n\nThe final outcome was indeed that close. Memphis State's Fred Pancoast, a popular Florida figure, said he held his breath on Mitchell's final, fateful burst. \"Our players said he took a deep breath and we keyed on him,\" revealed Pancoast. \"I just held my breath and watched the referee expecting him to signal touchdown.\"\n\nBut there was to be no signal, nor no Seminole war-whoop among the 23,883 partisans. Before Mitchell could dent the line of scrimmage, the 245-pound Anderson, from Fort Pierce Central, smashed into the squatty 185-pound runner and extended Seminole frustrations by still another Saturday.\n\n\"Our defense gave us the gut play,\" said Pancoast. \"FSU had the momentum. They had the spirit. They had us right where they wanted but we got up off our butts and did a job. A win is a win and I've never seen a better one.\"\n\nOf course, the defense didn't put points on the board and the eventual outcome was decided by two punchless but accurate placements by Hal McGeorge. The field goals covered 37 and 32 yards, both barely clearing the crossbar. The kicks brought the Tigers all the way back from a 10-0 deficit to give them a 5-2 record.\n\nBut Pancoast put the praise back on his defense. \"This game turned out exactly like I was afraid it would. They didn't make any errors. We gave them something early to hang their hat on. But our defense rose to the occasion. Otherwise we would be 4-3.\"\n\nThat something Pancoast referred to was a 74-yard scoring burst by sophomore Bobby McKinnon, who broke five tackles in the process of turning an option pitch from Mark Orlando for an attempted first down into the game's big play and the fourth longest TD run in FSU history.\n\nMcKinnon broke two tackles past the scrimmage line in driving for the first down. He was hit, miraculously kept his balance on the sideline, then found himself in the clear and gone. When Ahmet Askin kicked the seventh point, the clock read 9:17 in the first period. It was FSU's first touchdown of the year in the initial 15 minutes.\n\nFour more times before intermission, the Seminoles carried the attack to Memphis State, but the Orlando directed offense could only convert the consistent defensive play into three points, a 35-yard fielder by Askin following a Buzzy Lewis interception.\n\nTwo missed Askin field goals, from 52 and 35 yards, and clipping penalty plus fumble late, stymied the efforts.\n\nThe defense suffered just one breakdown during the first half, but it proved costly. On third-and-16 in his own territory, Tiger Dan Dary escaped two Seminoles on the draw play and maneuvered 26 yards to highlight a 12-play, 80-yard scoring drive which narrowed the gap to 10-7.\n\nSpeedy Bobby Ward returned the second half kickoff 46 yards to set up McGeorge's tying field goal 11:02 into the third quarter. Just 4 ½ minutes later, Floridian Joe Bruner directed Memphis to the 14, where McGeorge entered for his 32-yarder with 6:30 on the clock.\n\nThat set it up for the Tiger defense to play up to their nicknames. They got the opportunity when Greg Pounds intercepted a Bruner pass and returned to Memphis 21.\n\nBilly Sexton took command at QB on this fateful series and Mitchell carried six of the eight times for all of the yardage, moving to the one-yard line. The artful Hodger, as he is sometimes called, totaled 111 yards for the afternoon.\n\nIt was third-and-one from the one when FSU's victory bid came up short, not once but twice. To every disheartened Seminole, that yard seemed as long as the season.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Memphis State 0 7 6 0 13 Florida State 7 3 0 0 10\n\n1st 7- 0 Bobby McKinnon, 74, run (Ahmet Askin, kick), 9:17 7- 0 Ahmet Askin, 52, field goal failed, 2:55 2nd 7- 0 Ahmet Askin, 40, field goal failed, 13:49 10- 0 Ahmet Askin, 35, field goal, 8:55 10- 7 Opp, 3, run (kick), 5:30 3rd 10-10 Opp, 37, field goal, 11:02 10-13 Opp, 32, field goal, 6:30\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 9 17 Rushes-yards 40-202 49-222 Passing 68 108 Att-Comp-Int 22-14-0 27-15-2 Total Yards 62-270 76-330 Punt Returns 1-6 1-3 Kickoff Returns 4-52 2-68 Interception Ret. 2-22 0-0 Fumble Returns 2-0 1-0 Punts 6-38.5 4-33.8 Fumbles-Lost 3-1 3-2 Penalties-Yds 4-36 6-70 Time of Posession 28:18 31:42 Attendance 23,883 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Hodges Mitchell 20 111 0 18 Bobby McKinnon 8 77 1 74t Mike Davison 8 17 0 13 Billy Sexton 1 2 0 2 Joe Downey 1 -1 0 -1 Mark Orlando 2 -4 0 1 --------------------------------------------- FSU 40 202 1 74t Opp 49 222 1 26 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Hodges Mitchell 5 40 0 15 Bobby McKinnon 2 13 0 9 Mike Davison 6 10 0 5 Larry Jones 1 5 0 5 --------------------------------------------- FSU 14 68 0 15 Opp 15 108 0 14 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Mark Orlando 14 22 0 68 0 15 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 14 22 0 68 0 15 Opp 15 27 2 108 0 14 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mike Shumann 1 6 0 6 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 6 0 6 Opp 1 3 0 3 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Joe Goldsmith 3 35 0 Mike Davison 1 17 0 17 --------------------------------------------- FSU 4 52 0 17 Opp 2 68 0 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Joe Downey 6 231 52 ---------------------------------------- FSU 6 231 52 Opp 4 135 41 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Buzzy Lewis . . . . . 1- 5 . . . . . .

Of that, 231 came on the ground, 359 in the air.\n\nThat topped, by much, the previous high of 510 granted by a Florida State team, at Texas Tech in 1966 - and the Seminoles won that one 43-33.\n\nAnd the 359 yards passing were the most ever against a Florida State team in a single game. Previous high was 324 by South Carolina in 1968. The Seminoles won that one, too, 35-28.\n\nInterestingly, and ironically, Claude Gilbert, the San Diego coach, indicated after the game he was far from pleased with his team's record-buster against Florida State.\n\n\"Right now,\" he said, 'we are not playing well. Nor are we playing with any character or class right now.\"\n\nHe seemed to feel his Aztecs should have scored more. \"We stop ourselves with mistakes,\" he said, \"It is totally frustrating to get down there in scoring position and have an interception or fumble stop us or a mental mistake. If we keep playing like this, we are going to get beat somewhere along the way.\"\n\nWhat the game also was was one that reminded the few Florida State followers who made the trip of a team they used to know.\n\nJesse Freitas, possibly as good a passer as there is in the college game this year, was reminiscent of Florida State quarterbacks of recent years. The way San Diego's aerial game opened the door for the running game was another reminder.\n\nCompleting 22 of 36 passes for 308 yards and three touchdowns, Freitas may have climbed to No. 1 statistical rank nationally in passing. Last week he was No. 5. In six games he has hit 101 of 165 for 1,232 yards.\n\nFrank Geary, a big one, led the running charge for the Aztecs with 113 in just 18 carries.\n\nFlorida State had a creditable yardage total itself, 386.\n\nMark Orlando, completing 19 of his 34 throws, accounted for 199 of FSU's 283 passing sum. Billy Sexton was 3-for-13, completing just one of seven last-half tosses.\n\nHodges Mitchell, with 101 yards in 23 carries, accounted for all except two iof FSU's rushing net yardage of 103, if you want to slice it that way. Bobby McKinnon gained 19 in just three carries. Mike Davison nine in four. (Orlando finished with a net loss of 17.)\n\nNine different Seminoles caught passes. Mike Shumann collared four. Five - Ed Beckman. Larry Jones, Jim Everett, McKinnon and Davison - got three apiece.\n\nThough the defense yielded all those yards, it also provided more than a normal run of \"breaks\" - five interceptions plus one fumble recovery. Buzzy Lewis had two interceptions, Jim Malkiewicz, Randy Kaiser and Phil Cahoon one apiece.\n\nBut three of those breaks came in the early going of the game, and the Seminoles got just three points out of 'em.\n\n\"What really disappoints us,\" said Coach Larry Jones, \"is that we should have had more points in the first half.\n\n\"San Diego is a fine football team - as good offensively as we've played this season. Freitas hurt us in the clutch. I'll say it again - Freitas is a good one. We knew that coming in.\n\n\"Our idea going in was to try to throw more and try to loosen them up. It was pleasing that we got as much offense as we did, but we didn't get enough points.\n\n\"They were upset that they hadn't been scoring enough in previous games and they really came after us.\"\n\nJones said that the kicking game \"really killed us.\"\n\nJoe Downey averaged just 29 yards on six punts.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, after scoring its last touchdown and cutting the score to 31-17, Florida State was obliged to kick off three straight times.\n\nCollis Dennison, a freshman who has as strong a leg as any player in FSU history but needs improvement on his form, but the first kickoff out of bounds. Ahmet Askin came in for the next one, and did well - but the Seminoles were offsides. On the third kickoff, Ahmet rocketed it from his 30 to the enemy 10 - but Keith Denson, a 5-8, 161-pounder who had already pulled in two touchdown passes, returned it 64 yards.\n\nAnd that paved San Diego's last touchdown.\n\nSan Diego State was obliged to punt only once all night.\n\nThe Seminoles apparently came out of the game with no binding new injuries, though there was perhaps more that a normal amount of \"bumps and bruises.\"\n\nThey flew home right after the game that ended at 1:30 a.m. (Tallahassee time), arriving shortly after daylight following a flight of more than five hours.\n\nThis week it's a date in the Astrodome against always troublesome Houston, a foe the Seminoles have beaten just once, a foe with a 6-1 record freshly stung by its first loss (7-0 at Auburn on Saturday).\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 3 7 0 7 17 San Diego State 7 10 14 7 38\n\n1st 0- 0 Ahmet Askin, 45, field goal failed, 8:18 3- 0 Ahmet Askin, 30, field goal, 3:58 3- 7 Opp, 33, pass (kick), 2:00 2nd 3-10 Opp, 32, field goal, 12:44 3-17 Opp, 10, pass (kick), 1:07 10-17 Eddie Davis, 35, pass from Billy Sexton (Ahmet Askin, kick), 0:09 3rd 10-24 Opp, 6, run (kick), 13:24 10-31 Opp, 4, pass (kick), 5:19 4th 17-31 Jimmy Everett, 9, pass from Mark Orlando (Ahmet Askin, kick), 13:40 17-38 Opp, 3, run (kick), 11:10\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 22 26 Rushes-yards 35-113 48-231 Passing 283 359 Att-Comp-Int 47-22-1 43-26-5 Total Yards 82-396 91-590 Punt Returns 1-0 2-1 Kickoff Returns 7-116 4-86 Interception Ret. 5-54 1-33 Fumble Returns 1-0 3-0 Punts 6-29.2 1-30.0 Fumbles-Lost 4-3 3-1 Penalties-Yds 4-30 5-51 Attendance 26,492 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Hodges Mitchell 23 101 0 11 Bobby McKinnon 3 19 0 8 Mike Davison 4 9 0 5 Billy Sexton 1 1 0 1 Mark Orlando 4 -17 0 7 --------------------------------------------- FSU 35 113 0 11 Opp 48 231 2 56 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Jimmy Everett 3 64 1 44 Mike Shumann 4 63 0 26 Ed Davis 1 35 0 35t Ed Beckman 3 32 0 15 Larry Jones 3 31 0 15 Mike Davison 3 30 0 12 Bobby McKinnon 3 19 0 9 Mike Allen 1 12 0 12 Hodges Mitchell 1 -3 0 -3 --------------------------------------------- FSU 22 283 1 44 Opp 26 359 3 41 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Mark Orlando 19 34 1 199 0 44 Billy Sexton 3 13 0 84 1 35t ----------------------------------------------- FSU 22 47 1 283 1 44 Opp 26 43 5 359 3 41 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Andy Stockton 1 0 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 0 0 Opp 2 1 0 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mike Shumann 2 58 0 22 Larry Jones 2 31 0 21 Joe Goldsmith 1 20 0 20 Ed Beckman 1 7 0 Phil Jones 1 0 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 7 116 0 22 Opp 4 86 0 65 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Joe Downey 6 175 38 ---------------------------------------- FSU 6 175 38 Opp 1 30 30 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Buzzy Lewis 12 2 14 . . 2- 22 . . . . . .

Nobles-to-Brian Willingham TD bomb two minutes before halftime, a play which turned around a defensive struggle into a typical Houston rout.\n\nIt was the Seminoles' eighth consecutive loss and the brightest spot was the linebacker play of Bruce Bell who forced Nobles to change the game plan and start throwing the ball.\n\nThrow D.C. did. He fired 11 times, completed seven for 189 yards and the big TD play. Most of his throws were on third down plays which eventually led to short TD bursts by Leonard Parker, Donnie McGraw and DeLand's Reggie Cherry concluded the scoring as Cougar Coach Bill Yeoman emptied his bench in the second half.\n\nCherry's score, a 36-yard burst, was his 11th TD of the year as he closed in on Elmo Wright's single season mark of 14. Parker amassed 151 yards, his fifth 100-plus of the year.\n\nFSU's lone points came on Ahmet Askin's 52-yard field goal as neither Mark Orlando nor Billy Sexton could find the passing range.\n\nHouston wasted little time in venting its offensive anger on the Seminoles, a slow burn that had lasted seven days since Auburn inflicted a 7-0 setback.\n\nParker ripped seven yards up the middle to set the tone, then Nobles swept down the line on the veer, stuck the ball under his arm and cut upfield for 56 yards before Earl Humes chased him down at FSU's 16.\n\nThree plays later, Parker dove into the end zone and the potent Cougars enjoyed a 6-0 advantage with just 11:39 showing on the clock. Ricky Terrell's PAT was wide.\n\nFSU had an opportunity moments later when an errant Houston pitchout was recovered by freshman defensive tackle John Thames of Gainesville. Mitchell burst 25 yards on a delay and Orlando got inside the 25 on a busted play but a movement penalty set the Seminoles back and Ahmet Askin came on to try a 52-yard field goal. The sophomore sidewinded one barely over the bar but true for his personal record and the second longest in school history. Askin's previous best was 51 and the best ever was Grant Guthrie's of 53.\n\nThe clock showed 8:22 when the lights changed to 6-3.\n\nHouston roared right back, thanks to a clutch third down Nobles to Brian Willingham pass which gave the Cougs a first down in Seminole Country. A holding penalty pushed Houston back to the 30 where two long passes failed and the Seminoles took over on downs.\n\nThe period ended with Houston at the Seminole 38, fourth and five, and the home towners leading, 6-3.\n\nIn deep trouble from their own nine, Joe Downey extricated the Seminoles with a 44-yard punt. It proved to be a net 54-yard gain when Tampa freshman Pat Booth ran down Cougar Joe Rust for a 10-yard loss eventually leading to a Hal Roberts' punt.\n\nAgain the offense sputtered and Downey got a big break on a squibber that took a Seminole bounce and rolled off Rust's hands for 44 yards, two Seminoles narrowly losing a battle for the errant ball at the Cougar 41.\n\nBuilding hope against hope, FSU's young defense, led by linebacker Bruce Bell, played great for two plays but time and again Nobles would throw accurately on this down. He hit Willingham for 20 and a first down at the FSU 33. Then he hit tight end Miller Basler for a first down at the 19.\n\nFSU held Parker for no gain but defensive holding was detected, moving the ball half the distance to the goal. Parker got a first down at the seven and fumbled, FSU recovering. But officials declared the ball down and Houston retained possession. After a procedure penalty and no gain, Nobles passed into the end zone and pass interference was ruled against Earl Humes.\n\nFrom the one, it took the Cougars three plays to score and even that was controversial when Parker was stacked up on the goal line. The head linesman did not rule TD but the back judge, under the goal posts, signaled for the score.\n\nFSU's anguished defenders stomped in vain protest while Ken Faulkner of the Southwest Conference explained to two Seminoles that Parker penetrated with 4:15 on the clock.\n\nNobles then passed to Bassler for the two-point conversion and a 14-3 lead.\n\nUndaunted, Orlando finally found a receiver and hit freshman Tom McDougal for a 16-yard play to the 47, but wouldn't you know it, a 15-yard penalty was imposed after the play ended and the Seminoles ended up punting once more.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Downey was injured on a 45-yard punt when he was clipped. The penalty set Houston up at its own 17 but the time bomb offense was ready to explode.\n\nNobles dropped straight back, got little rush, and fired downfield to the 50. Will"
