        "text": "Published by: Jody East\n\nToday is the 50th anniversary of the first ‘official’ England Women’s football match.\n\nThis was a really significant moment in 1972. It was only a year since the Football Association had overturned their 1921 ban on women playing football on any affiliated FA grounds, which effectively killed the women’s game for 50 years. A new team, chosen through trials held by the Women’s Football Association, travelled to Scotland to play a newly formed Scottish team on 18 November 1972.\n\nThis week, local Lioness, Julia Brunton (née Manning), came to Brighton Museum to share her story of being in that very first official squad. Women such as Julia are one of the reasons we celebrated the England team lifting the UEFA Women’s EURO trophy at Wembley this summer. They played despite lack of facilities, lack of funding and ridicule from the media and the general public alike.\n\nJulia remembers travelling up to Scotland in an ‘ancient coach’ with her new teammates\n\n‘It was freezing cold and snowed during the second half.’\n\nDespite the weather, there were plenty of goals and England beat Scotland 3-2 in front of a crowd of about 400 people.\n\nJulia kept her programme from the game, signed for by all her teammates and the Manager, Eric Worthington. It was the start of women’s football internationals for the England team, although it would still be 12 years before an official competition was organised, in 1984, the European Championship.\n\nJulia was a substitute for the England/Scotland game and received her first Cap in the second international match, which was against France on 22 April 1973.\n\n‘I was more excited than nervous. But when I got on the pitch I just relaxed and enjoyed it. I can imagine it was very different for the girls walking out at Wembley this year! We had to hand our kit back after matches, we didn’t get to keep it. We were given one Cap in honour of our first game for our country, which was handsewn by a lady called Flo Bilton. We were never given an official Cap, until now. It cost money to play for England, we paid for our own travel to our team meeting point.’\n\nDespite the best efforts of the Women’s Football Association, which was a volunteer organisation, the women who played in the early teams have never felt recognised, appreciated, or respected by the Football Association. Until this year, when the FA invited that very first team to Wembley as special guests to watch England vs USA on 7 October.\n\n‘It was the first time I really felt like a Lioness. We were given official Caps, with our England Legacy number on, and an England shirt with our name on. My Legacy number is 13. I looked up my male equivalent, and it is a chap called Leonard Howell, born in 1848, which was 103 years before I was born! We walked into the player changing room in Wembley and all our shirts were hanging up, like we were players now. It was incredible, so emotional.’\n\nJulia was playing for Lowestoft Ladies team when she was chosen to be a Lioness in 1972. She moved to Brighton when she got married, having first researched Brighton teams. She played for Brighton and Hove Albion Supporters Ladies Club, and when it disbanded, went on to play for C&C Sports.\n\nJulia’s story is one of many captured by the UEFA Women’s EURO 2022 Heritage Programme to recognise, highlight and celebrate untold histories of women’s football in England.\n\nThank you to the National Lottery Heritage Fund for their support in uncovering these stories.\n\nRelated Stories"
