He came back to A&M to serve in his current role as Director of Student-Athlete Development in 2006 after 10 years as head coach at Grand Prairie (Texas) High School, where he had an impressive 179-124 record.\n\nDavis twice earned first-team All-Southwest Conference honors after helping the Aggies win consecutive conference titles in 1975 and 1976. The 1975 squad finished 20-7 - the first 20-win season in school history - and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. The 1976 Aggies went 21-6 with Davis serving as team co-captain.\n\nHe holds the unique distinction of having been on a national playoff team four consecutive years at three different levels -- Sam Houston State in 1973, where he began his college career and played in the NAIA College Tournament as a freshman, Hill Junior College for the 1974 NJCAA College Tournament and finally Texas A&M. Davis also has the recognition of playing and coaching teams that have played in the NCAA College Tournament and NJCAA National Tournament.\n\nDavis joined Shelby Metcalf’s staff as an assistant coach from 1977-82, helping the Aggies to a 24-9 record in 1978-79 and a school-record 26-8 mark in 1979-80. The 1978-79 team posted wins against Indiana, Kentucky and UNLV, while the 1979-80 team beat North Carolina in the NCAA Tournament before falling in overtime to eventual national champion Louisville.\n\nDavis was head coach at Western Texas College from 1982-84, earning region coach of the year honors after leading the team to a fifth-place finish in the national junior college tournament. From 1986-88, he served as an assistant coach at North Texas, helping the team to its first Southland Conference title and the first NCAA Tournament appearance in the school’s history.\n\nDavis was co-MVP for 1975 and 1976 Southwest Conference Championship teams. After the completion of collegiate career, Davis was drafted by the Houston Rockets.\n\nDavis was head coach at Bryan High School from 1988-94, earning a variety of coaching honors, and at Seguin High School from 1994-96. A native of Galveston, Davis was a standout player at Ball High School. He and his wife, Mildred, have one son, Barry, and godchildren - Tiffany, Bryan and Collin."
