Oklahoma participated as members of the Big Eight Conference and played its home games in Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium where it has played its home games since 1923.[1] The team posted a 10–0–1 overall record and a 7–0 conference record to earn the Conference outright title under first-year head coach Barry Switzer.[2][3] This would be the first of eight consecutive Big Eight Conference championships for the Sooners with Switzer as head coach.[2]\n\nThe team was led by three All-Americans: Rod Shoate (Oklahoma's second three-time All-American)[4] the oldest of the Selmon brothers, Lucious,[5] and Eddie Foster.[5] The Selmon brothers Lucious, Lee Roy and Dewey started on the defensive line.[6] The team went undefeated on a schedule that included seven ranked opponents (In order, #1 USC, #17 Miami, #13 Texas, #13 Colorado, #10 Missouri, #18 Kansas, and #10 Nebraska). Five of these opponents finished the season ranked. The team tied with USC in the second game of the season before winning nine consecutive contests. It began the season ranked number 11 and steadily climbed in the polls as the season progressed.[3]\n\nJoe Washington led the team in rushing with 1173 yards, Steve Davis led the team in passing yard for with 934 yards, Tinker Owens led the team in receiving with 472 yards, Davis led the team in scoring with 108 points, Shoate led the team in tackles with 126, and Randy Hughes led the team in interceptions with 5.[7]\n\nPrior to the season in August, the Sooners were put on probation by the Big Eight Conference, which included a two-year ban on bowl appearances, and a two-year ban on television appearances (1974, 1975).[8]\n\nSchedule\n\n[edit]\n\nDateOpponentRankSiteTVResultAttendanceSourceSeptember 15at Baylor*No. 11W 42–1441,573 September 29at No. 1 USC*No. 8T 7–783,986 October 6No. 17 Miami (FL)*No. 6W 24–2062,040 October 13vs. No. 13 Texas*No. 6ABCW 52–1372,032 October 20No. 16 ColoradoNo. 3\n\nOklahoma Memorial Stadium\n\nNorman, OK\n\nW 34–761,826–62,580[9] October 27at Kansas StateNo. 3W 56–1429,523 November 3Iowa StateNo. 3\n\nOklahoma Memorial Stadium\n\nNorman, OK\n\nW 34–1761,876 November 10at No. 10 MissouriNo. 3W 31–365,515 November 17No. 18 KansasNo. 3\n\nOklahoma Memorial Stadium\n\nNorman, OK\n\nW 48–2060,961–64,122 November 23No. 10 NebraskaNo. 3\n\nOklahoma Memorial Stadium\n\nNorman, OK (rivalry)\n\nABCW 27–062,257 December 1at Oklahoma StateNo. 2W 45–1850,964\n\n*Non-conference game\n\nHomecoming\n\nRankings from AP Poll released prior to the game\n\n[3]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nGame summaries\n\n[edit]\n\nAt Baylor\n\n[edit]\n\n#11 Oklahoma Sooners at Baylor Bears\n\n1 234Total • #11 Oklahoma 21 1407 42 Baylor 0 068 14\n\nDate: September 15\n\nLocation: Floyd Casey Stadium, Waco, Texas\n\nGame attendance: 46,000\n\n[10]\n\nAt USC\n\n[edit]\n\nMiami (FL)\n\n[edit]\n\n1 234Total Miami (FL) 7 1300 20 • Oklahoma 7 0143 24\n\nDate: October 6\n\nLocation: Oklahoma Memorial Stadium • Norman, Oklahoma\n\nGame attendance: 61,826\n\n[11]\n\nvs Texas\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Red River Rivalry\n\nWorst loss in Darrell Royal's coaching career [12]\n\nTeam Category Player Statistics Oklahoma Passing Steve Davis 5/6, 185 Yds, 2 TD Rushing Joe Washington 12 Rush, 117 Yds Receiving Tinker Owens 4 Rec, 163 Yds, 2 TD Texas Passing Marty Akins 5/9, 64 Yds, INT Rushing Roosevelt Leaks 20 Rush, 82 Yds Receiving Pat Kelly 4 Rec, 71 Yds\n\nColorado\n\n[edit]\n\n1 234Total Colorado 7 000 7 • Oklahoma 7 7713 34\n\nDate: October 20\n\nLocation: Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, Norman, Oklahoma\n\nGame attendance: 61,826\n\n[9]\n\nAt Kansas State\n\n[edit]\n\n1 234Total • Oklahoma 21 14147 56 Kansas St 0 770 14\n\nDate: KSU Stadium\n\nLocation: October 27\n\nGame attendance: 34,500\n\n[13]\n\nIowa State\n\n[edit]\n\n1 234Total Iowa St 14 300 17 • Oklahoma 7 1377 34\n\nDate: November 3\n\nLocation: Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, Norman, Oklahoma\n\nGame attendance: 61,826\n\nJoe Washington 136 Rush Yds [14]\n\nAt Missouri\n\n[edit]\n\n#3 Oklahoma Sooners at #10 Missouri Tigers\n\n1 234Total • #3 Oklahoma 7 3129 31 #10 Missouri 3 000 3\n\nDate: November 10\n\nLocation: Memorial Stadium, Columbia, Missouri\n\nGame attendance: 68,831\n\n[15]\n\nKansas\n\n[edit]\n\nNebraska\n\n[edit]\n\n#10 Nebraska Cornhuskers at #3 Oklahoma Sooners\n\n1 234Total #10 Nebraska 0 000 0 • #3 Oklahoma 14 067 27\n\nDate: November 23\n\nLocation: Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, Norman, Oklahoma\n\nGame attendance: 61,826\n\nTelevision network: ABC\n\n[16]\n\nAt Oklahoma State\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Bedlam Series\n\n#2 Oklahoma Sooners at Oklahoma State Cowboys\n\n1 234Total • #2 Oklahoma 7 14717 45 Oklahoma State 0 3312 18\n\nDate: December 1\n\nLocation: Lewis Field, Stillwater, Oklahoma\n\nGame attendance: 50,511\n\n[17]\n\nRankings\n\n[edit]\n\nRanking movements\n\nLegend: ██ Increase in ranking ██ Decrease in ranking\n\nт = Tied with team above or below ( ) = First-place votes\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nAll-American: Rod Shoate,[4] Eddie Foster[18][19][20][21] and Lucious Selmon[5]\n\nBig Eight Athlete of the Year: Selmon[5]\n\nBig Eight Defensive Player: Selmon[5]\n\nChevrolet Defensive Player of the Year: Selmon[5]\n\nPostseason\n\n[edit]\n\nNFL draft\n\n[edit]\n\nSeven Sooners were selected in the 1974 NFL draft.[22]\n\nRound Pick Player Position NFL Team 4 85 Durwood Keeton Defensive back St. Louis Cardinals 5 110 Gary Baccus Linebacker New York Giants 5 119 Clyde Powers Defensive back New York Jets 9 227 Ken Pope Defensive back Oakland Raiders 12 296 Eddie Foster Tackle New England Patriots 14 349 David Smith Linebacker Philadelphia Eagles 16 399 Lucious Selmon Defensive tackle New England Patriots\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
