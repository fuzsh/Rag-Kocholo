        "text": "IN the record books, Cork’s 1973 All-Ireland Football success stands in isolation; a one-off in a long era of failure. But it should not be viewed in that way. It was, in fact, the pinnacle of many smaller successes that took 20 years to bear fruit.\n\nThe roots of that triumph 50 years ago next year can be traced back to the 1945 All-Ireland Final win over Cavan. Cork’s football fortunes improved after that. There was a far more competitive county championship. City football clubs like Nemo Rangers and St Finbarrs became stronger and rose to the senior ranks.\n\nA little over a decade later, Cork were winning Munster Minor football championships on a regular basis, starting with three titles between 1959 and 1961. The first All-Ireland Minor football title came in 1961.\n\nCork minor teams went on to dominate the decade, racking up a three-in-a-row of All-Irelands from 1967. All-Ireland U21 football titles followed in 1970 and 1971.\n\nOne major obstacle remained before Cork could hope to lift the Sam Maguire Cup.\n\nKerry had proved a stumbling block to Cork’s football ambitions throughout the 20th century. Cork failed to beat them between 1907 and 1943, and beat them in just six finals between 1945 and 1971. In line with their improving fortunes, however, three of those titles came between 1966 and 1971.\n\nWhen Nemo became County Senior Football champions for the first time in 1972, it proved the final piece of the jigsaw needed to take Cork to the next level.\n\nAs champions, Nemo were entitled to nominate the captain and a selector. They put forward Billy Morgan and Denis McDonnell, who became Chairman of the selection committee. Both choices were inspired.\n\nThe other selectors included ex-star Paddy O’Driscoll, Derry Gowen (Fermoy), Sean Crowley (Bandon) and Mick McCarthy (St Nicholas). Donie O’Donovan, who had trained and coached Cork to the 1967 All-Ireland final, was trainer and coach.\n\nProgress was slow. On Sunday, February 26, just a few hundred turned up as Cork beat Longford in a dreary game. Jimmy Barry- Murphy, at 19, made his debut, almost unnoticed, but soon developed a reputation as one of the most iconic dual players of the 20th century.\n\nAs Cork’s league campaign petered out, focus shifted to the championship. Never before had such a pool of talent been available to a Cork football selection committee. At that time, only 21 were invited to train with the county. The question of who to omit from the panel was as big a challenge as picking the first 15.\n\nCork beat Clare first up 2-14 to 0-3, with Billy Field scoring 1-8. Barry-Murphy was a sub.\n\nThe Munster Final against Kerry - National League champions and favourites - took place at the Athletic Grounds on July 15.\n\nBarry-Murphy was at No.13. Some wondered if he was too young to face a seasoned Kerry defence. Cork, however, had a plan to create space for him and Kerry never saw it coming.\n\nThe visitors attacked from the off. At the other end, Ray Cummins moved from full-forward in a switch with Barry- Murphy. Crucially, Kerry instructed full-back Paudie O’Donoghue to follow Cummins.\n\nThe move left acres of space in front of the lightning-fast Barry Murphy and Jimmy Barrett. An unprecedented goal blitz ensued.\n\nIn the third minute, a high ball into the Kerry goal area was fisted in the net by Barry-Murphy.\n\nCork’s first goal.\n\nIn the tenth minute, Denis Long’s free kick found Jimmy Barrett, who cut in from the left corner position and shot low to the net.\n\nCork’s second goal.\n\nTen minutes later, Kerry conceded a penalty. Field took it.\n\nCork’s third goal.\n\nCork won possession from the kick-out. Dave McCarthy shot for a point. The ball struck the upright, fell back in front of the goal. Barry-Murphy coolly side-footed it into the net.\n\nCork’s fourth goal.\n\nIn the 24th minute, Kevin Jer O’Sullivan found Barry Murphy. He flicked the ball to Barrett who punched it into the net.\n\nCork’s fifth goal.\n\nAt half-time, Cork led 5-4 to 0-6.\n\nKerry rallied and were a mere three points down with 19 minutes left. Morgan made an exceptional save to keep them at bay before Cork re-established their grip and won 5-12 to 1-15.\n\nCork faced Tyrone in the All-Ireland semi-final. It was played in heavy drizzle and the weather set the tone. Leading scorer Field broke his leg inside six minutes, and the half-time score was 1-4 to 0-1 to Cork. Ray Cummins scored Cork’s goal.\n\nCork eventually settled and the goals came. Barry-Murphy got two, Declan Barron and Seamus Coughlan one each. Cork ran out easy winners 5-10 to 2-4.\n\nGalway had already qualified for the final. Consequently, Cork knew it was likely they would be required to wear white in the final. Sets of jerseys were scarce, so they borrowed a white set off Tyrone to train in.\n\nThe county was alive with excitement in the build-up to the final. Never before had Cork entered an All-Ireland final having scored 13 goals in three games. It was 28 years since the 1945 win. As expected, the demand for tickets was unprecedented.\n\nThe game took place on September 23 before 73,308. Early on, Barron kicked a free that appeared to be going wide. Barrett however, got a fist to it and the ball struck the upright. From the rebound, Barry-Murphy coolly fisted the ball to the Galway net.\n\nThat settled Cork. By the 28th minute, they led 1-9 to 0-3. The half-time score of 1-10 to 0-6 did not do justice to Galway’s fightback before the break.\n\nIt took a great save again from Morgan and some heroic defence to keep Cork seven points ahead with 20 minutes to go. Three minutes later, Galway goaled.\n\nThe most memorable moment of the game came with seven minutes left. Barry-Murphy received a pass from Cummins, headed for goal, stopped, and soloed once before coolly slotting the ball between three defenders.\n\nCork 2-17, Galway 1-12.\n\nGalway attacked with all their might and scored a second goal with a minute left. It was quickly cancelled by Cork’s third goal from Barrett on the final whistle.\n\nCork 3-17, Galway 2-13. Over.\n\nIt was hailed as one of the best finals ever. The Irish Independent reported it was “the most honest and wholesome game ever seen”. Jack Lynch, who played in the 1945 team, said: “This is the finest Cork football team I ever saw”. The Cork Examiner said: “The grace and skill of this team… must wipe out years of bitter disappointment.”\n\nThe homecoming on the Monday night rivalled any seen in the city before or since. Similar scenes followed in Millstreet and West Cork when the Cup visited.\n\nCork retained the Munster title in 1974 but fell to a rising Dublin in the All-Ireland semi. Kerry regrouped in 1975 and, despite some fantastic, and often controversial games, in front of large crowds, Cork’s only Munster title between 1975 and 1986 came in 1983, when they again lost to Dublin in the semi-final.\n\nThe fact Cork did not kick on after 1973 does not take from the quality of the displays, the excitement and sense of joy the team brought to the entire county. Nor did the team stop giving to Cork and to the GAA.\n\nWhen Cork won back-to-back titles in 1989-90, Morgan was coach and Frank Cogan played a leading role. Four of the 1973 team, Brian Murphy, Coughlan, Barry-Murphy and Cummins, went on to win senior hurling medals in Cork from 1976-78.\n\nThe 1973 title stands alone, but is representative of a time when all the strands of Cork football, North, South, West and City, were strong at the same time and pulled together to achieve their full potential, resulting in the Sam Maguire Cup residing in Leeside for that glorious year."
