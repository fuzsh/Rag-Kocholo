        "text": "In conjunction with the NFL’s 100th season celebration, 19 current and former reporters across the USA TODAY Sports Network were asked to compile a list ranking the 100 greatest players in pro football history.\n\nThe challenge was daunting, considering each person had to assess talent back to 1920. While there were no strict parameters, the process for making decisions focused on the field of play and considered elements such as induction to the Hall of Fame, statistics, awards, reputation and the eye test. Each voter was asked to rank 60 players. Those votes produced a list of 170 names. A points system was used for the rankings starting with 60 points for the top player on a list down to 1. Ties were broken by using the highest single vote a player received.\n\nOur panel: Jarrett Bell, USA TODAY; Dave Birkett, Detroit Free Press; Christine Brennan, USA TODAY; Mark Curnutte, Cincinnati Enquirer; Nate Davis, USA TODAY; Pete Dougherty Green Bay Press-Gazette; Gregg Doyel, Indianapolis Star; Gentry Estes, Nashville Tennessean; Doug Farrar, Touchdown Wire; Martin Frank, Wilmington (Del.) News Journal; Mike Jones, USA TODAY; Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, USA TODAY; Joe Rexrode, formerly Nashville Tennessean; Steven Ruiz, For The Win; Kent Somers, Arizona Republic; Rachel Shuster, former USA TODAY; Art Stapleton, Bergen (N.J.
