        "text": "Few prizes attract the same attention worldwide and have such a rigorous selection process as the Nobel Prize. Thomas Perlmann is the one who makes that life-changing phone call the first Monday of every October. But it's actually not his favourite part of the job. Find out what thrills the secretary of KI's Nobel Assembly and Committee the most.\n\nMost researchers will never come close to winning a Nobel Prize. But some are fortunate enough to work with one of the 200 or so living Nobel legends of the research world. Meet three of the lucky ones.\n\nDuring Nobel Week, the world's eyes are directed towards Stockholm and ground-breaking research. For KI's researchers, it is a chance to focus on research that deserves more attention. Organize your event during the week and get traction in marketing via Nobel Calling Stockholm.\n\nIn 2022, research on the importance of Neanderthals to modern humans was rewarded. Or rather, how we carry their genes, which have been shown to be associated with both sensitivity to pain and the risk of developing severe covid-19, to name a few examples.\n\nSvante Pääbo's Nobel Prize-winning research has also presented Denisovans, a previously unknown human species that has also contributed to the DNA of living humans.\n\nThe 2021 prize is about how people can feel temperature and touch. The discoveries explain basic functions in our lives and have opened doors to new treatments for pain, for example. We take for granted the fact that we can feel an icy wind or a hot plate, but how this actually works was discovered by the Nobel Laureates.\n\nThe 2020 prize awarded the discovery of the hepatitis C virus. Thanks to the work of the laureates, it is now possible to detect the virus in blood and to provide an effective treatment for the infection. It has saved the lives of millions of people. The prize also focuses on the importance of research into viruses.\n\nThe 2019 prize went to three laureates that explained a vital ability – how cells adapt to the availability of oxygen. These discoveries have opened the door to new strategies for combating anaemia, cancer and many other diseases and are now being investigated further at institutions like Karolinska Institutet.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to K. Barry Sharpless, Morten Meldal and Carolyn R. Bertozzi for the development of click chemistry, a quick and efficient way to build molecules. Several KI researchers use the “Lego-like” technique in their daily research and one has co-authored a study with one of this year's prize winners.\n\nThe 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry rewarded Benjamin List and David MacMillan for a new and ingenious tool for building molecules, asymmetric organocatalysis, which has contributed to more environmentally friendly chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing. KI researcher Per I Arvidsson was one of those who introduced organocatalysis in Sweden and says that the prize was expected.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna for the development of a method for genome editing. Several KI researchers use the method in their own research. “It’s the best tool to study gene function at the molecular level,” says KI Professor Galina Selivanova who has met one of the laureates."
