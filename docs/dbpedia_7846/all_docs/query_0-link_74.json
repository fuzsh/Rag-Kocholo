        "text": "Ben Mottelson participated in the 1944 Westinghouse Science Talent Search and received the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was recognized for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and for the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus. In collaboration with Mottelson and experiments in 1952 and 1953, Aage Bohr determined that nucleons in the outer portions of the atomic nucleus move in paths and interact with nucleons inside, which distorts the nucleus.\n\n​Frank Wilczek participated in the 1967 Westinghouse Science Talent Search and received the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was recognized for his discovery of asymptotic freedom in the strong interaction theory. An atomic nucleus is held together by a powerful interaction which binds protons and neutrons. This interaction also holds together quarks that make up those protons and neutrons. In 1973, Wilczek, David Gross, and David Politzer came up with a theory suggesting that when quarks come close to each other, the attraction reduces and they behave like free particles — this is called asymptotic freedom. Wilczek is a Society for Science & the Public board member.\n\n​John Hall participated in the 1952 Westinghouse Science Talent Search and received the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was recognized for his contributions to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb technique. In 2000, Hall and Theodor Hänsch developed this technique, where laser light with a series of equidistance frequencies can be used to measure frequencies with great precision. In quantum physics, light and other electromagnetic radiation appears in the form of packets with fixed energies, which corresponds to energy transitions in atoms. And determining the frequency of light waves provides information about atoms’ properties.\n\n​Roger Tsien participated in the 1968 Westinghouse Science Talent Search and received the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He was recognized for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP. Some organisms produce this protein, and its formation is regulated by a gene that can be incorporated into other organisms’ genomes. With genetic engineering, GFP can be linked to other proteins, and has become an important tool for studying biological processes in cells. In the 1990s, Tsien succeeded in varying the color of the light for the protein so that different proteins and biological processes could be tracked.\n\n​Alvin Roth participated in the 1968 Westinghouse Science Talent Search and received the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics. He was recognized for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design. In the 1980s Roth used Lloyd Shapley’s theoretical results of different matching methods to explain how markets function in practice. With empirical studies and lab experiments, Roth showed that stability was critical to successful matching methods. He also developed systems for matching doctors with hospitals, school children with schools, and organ donors with patients."
