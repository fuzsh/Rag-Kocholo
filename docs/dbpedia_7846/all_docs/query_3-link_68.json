        "text": "Chris Torrance (1969)\n\nBorn: Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, United Kingdom. An avid reader of science fiction as a child, Dr Chris Torrance has always sought to work on problems that lack a solution. Not a high flyer at school, Torrance only really gained a sense of purpose after spending a year in industry during his undergraduate degree. Introduced to the exciting potential of genetics during his doctorate, Torrance has since then been at the cutting edge of developing new technologies to improve drug discovery and development. Initially Torrance devoted his energies to finding more effective cancer treatments, but more recently has widened his scope to looking at other disease targets that have so far proven undruggable. Driven by scientific curiosity and a passion to make a difference, Torrance has founded several successful UK-based biotechnology companies, one of which raised the largest private funds in the UK life sciences in 2021. Each company is geared towards advancing technologies with potential to transform our understanding of the mechanisms of disease and its treatment."
