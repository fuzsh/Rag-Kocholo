        "text": "Secretary of the Navy A. P. Upshur's report on the condition of the Navy addresses the deplorable state of education of naval officers. Little or no attention has hitherto been paid to the proper education of naval officers. For many years the young midshipmen were left to educate themselves and one another. Their schools were held in receiving ships and cruising vessels, in the midst of a thousand interruptions and impediments, which render the whole system of little or no value.\n\nDecember 1\n\nMidshipman Philip Spencer and two bluejackets are hanged at the yardarm of the small brig Somers for what is perceived by the captain, Commander Alexander Slidell MacKenzie, to be a mutiny. The incident becomes a catalyst for founding the Naval Academy.\n\nMarch 11\n\nGeorge Bancroft of Massachusetts, outstanding historian, educator, and energetic administrator, becomes Secretary of the Navy, appointed by President Polk.\n\nMay 1\n\nSecretary Bancroft requests four professors at the successful Philadelphia Asylum school to make a report of the instruction and procedures there for the planning of a new school.\n\nJune 25\n\nNaval Board of Examiners submits recommendations for a naval school at Annapolis.\n\nSeptember 3\n\nFort Severn, Annapolis, Maryland, a nine acre tract of land called Windmill Point, is transferred from the War Department to the Navy Department. Commander Franklin Buchanan is placed in command.\n\nOctober 10\n\nAt 11:00 a.m., the superintendent, Commander Franklin Buchanan, assembles the 7 professors (3 civilians, 4 officers) and some 50 midshipmen in one of the classrooms and declares the school open. Buchanan will later command the Confederate forces at Mobile Bay.\n\nThe original Naval School course covers five years, with the first and last being spent at the school and the three intervening years being spent at sea.\n\nJanuary 15\n\nFirst midshipmen's ball is held.\n\nSpring\n\nMidshipmen Spirit Club presents the school's first theatrical production, \"Lady of Lyons.\"\n\nMay 13\n\nWar with Mexico declared. An orderly system of advancing the date of commissioning is established. Before the end of the war, 90 officers will be furnished to the Navy. The school's successful adjustment to war needs may well have been the proof of its value to the Navy that was needed to justify its existence and silence the skeptics. Various war trophies will be located at the Naval Academy. Guns on the Academy grounds bear such colorful names as \"Biter,\" \"Grumbler,\" and \"Last Argument of the King.\"\n\nAugust 10\n\nCongress recognizes the existence of the school by voting $28,200 \"for repairs, improvements and instruction at Fort Severn.\"\n\nMidshipmen erect their first monument to Midshipmen Henson, Clemson, Pillsbury, and Shubrick who were lost in the Mexican War.\n\nInstigated by Professor Henry Lockwood, a West Pointer, the Academic Board adopts military drill at the Naval School. Angry midshipmen are aroused to new heights for they know the old maxim of the day: \"A messmate before a shipmate, a shipmate before a stranger, a stranger before a dog, but a dog before a 'sojer' (soldier).\"\n\nProfessor Lockwood is hanged in effigy from the school's flagstaff for inventing \"Midshipmen P-rades.\"\n\nRev. William Whiting, a clergyman of the Church of England, comp oses the \"Navy Hymn\" (Eternal Father, strong to save) after passing safely through a violent gale on the Mediterranean Sea. Music was written by John Bacchus Dykes of England.\n\nFirst foreign national to attend the Naval Academy, the Frenchman Pierre d'Orleans, Duc de Penthievre.\n\nStars above anchors on collars first designate midshipmen for academic achievement.\n\nJune\n\nHerndon Monument is erected. It commemorates Commander William Lewis Herndon, who went down with the mail steamer Central America in a storm off South Carolina in 1857. After making every possible effort to save the ship, Herndon left the quarterdeck long enough to don his full dress uniform, in which he returned to his post to meet a seaman's death.\n\nNovember\n\nTripoli Monument is moved to the Naval Academy from Washington.\n\nAlbert A. Michelson (USNA 1873) first accurately measures the speed of light with $10 worth of apparatus along the seawall.\n\nJuly 1\n\nCommodore Foxhall A. Parker becomes superintendent. His brother, William H. Parker, had been superintendent of the Confederate Naval Academy during the Civil War.\n\nOctober\n\nThe Naval Academy is awarded a gold medal at the Paris Universal Exposition for the best system of education in the United States.\n\nAugust 2\n\nRear Admiral George B. Balch becomes superintendent. The previous superintendent, Commodore Foxhall A. Parker, had died during June Week.\n\nGraduates are authorized to enter the U. S. Marine Corps. Legislation is passed that designates the student officers as \"naval cadets.\"\n\nCongress limits the number of Academy graduates who can be taken into the Navy.\n\nThe distinction between cadet engineers and naval cadets is abolished in both name and training. Up to this year, some 135 cadet engineers have been furnished to the fleet.\n\nApril 23\n\nThe Spanish-American War begins. At the outset of the war, 2,307 midshipmen had graduated from the Naval Academy. Dewey, Sampson, and Schley are among graduates who win new combat luster for the school.\n\nJuly 15\n\nRear Admiral Frederick V. McNair becomes superintendent.\n\nJuly 16\n\nFollowing the American naval victory at Santiago, Admiral Cervera and other officers of the Spanish Navy are quartered in Academy buildings as \"prisoners of war,\" though they are soon paroled and spend the summer enjoying the hospitality of Academy personnel and Annapolis society more as guests than prisoners.\n\nAugust\n\nA Protocol of Peace is negotiated and hostilities generally cease. Representatives of Spain and the United States sign a formal peace treaty in Paris on December 10, 1898.\n\nPark Benjamin , Class of 1867, designs the Naval Academy Seal. This is approved and adopted by the Navy Department. The seal is a hand grasping a trident, below which is a shield bearing an ancient galley coming into action. Below that is an open book, indicative of education. The motto is Ex Scientia Tridens: From Knowledge, Sea Power.\n\nThe Army-Navy football game is held for the first time in Philadelphia (Franklin Field). The score was Army 17 - Navy 5.\n\nMarch 28\n\nConstruction begins on Dahlgren Hall, first building of the \"New Naval Academy.\"\n\nThe coast squadron of the North Atlantic Fleet, comprising two battleships, four monitors, and seven destroyers, embarks some of the midshipmen.
