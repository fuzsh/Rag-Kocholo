        "text": "David Ralph “Coach” Lahtinen, age 75, of Gladstone passed away Saturday, March 5, 2022 surrounded by his family at UP Health Systems in Marquette.\n\nDave was a loving husband, father, grandpa, brother, uncle, cousin, coach “Lahts,” teacher, mentor, and friend to all.\n\nDave was born May 11, 1946, in Ishpeming, MI. The son of Ralphael and Lourice (Moretti) Lahtinen, he graduated from Ishpeming High School in 1964 and finished his education at Northern Michigan University in 1968, collecting degrees in mathematics, education, and history. Known as “Blondie’s kid” and a hardworking Finn, Dave spent his summers working in the Hematite Iron Mine.\n\nDave’s career spanned 37 years at Gladstone High School as both an educator and coach. He also taught at ‘Iolani school in Hawaii. Dave served as the head of the math department for several years before retiring in 2004. As a coach, Dave spent 35 years as the head of the men’s cross country team (special 1979 and 1984 team championship memories), coached over 20 years in high school basketball including many years of summer clinics at NMU, and was responsible for starting the women’s cross country program. He also coached high school track (on the cinder track) and volunteered until his retirement. His coaching achievements are numerous, perhaps best summarized by the fact that he was enshrined in the Gladstone Athletic Hall of Fame in 2021. He encouraged academic performance to be equally important to sport as many of his teams were All-Academic, and he served as the scholarship chairman on the UP Sports Hall of Fame Executive Council. He supported UP athletics also as a sports broadcaster for football and basketball and announced track and football at the Gladstone football field. Much more important to Dave than the wins and losses of his teams were the thousands of student-athletes he had the privilege of coaching, meeting, and honoring…many of whom he remained close friends with until his final days. He was known for caring in a cheerful and encouraging way and making light of difficult moments. The impact he had on generations of students from all walks of life, no matter their ability, made him special to all. He will be remembered as “Coach” with a solid gold soul.\n\nDave’s personal life revolved around his family and the many friends he considered a part of his family. A bachelor until 39, he married the love of his life, Dianne Lee Anderson, on February 8, 1986. Daughters Tara and Tiffany followed soon after, joining step-children Tim Fox and Tammy (Fox) Woods. Dave’s family has grown to currently include nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. “Papa Day” loved nothing more than when he was with his youngest grandkids, Porter (5) and Ruby (1). He spent much of last year “preparing” Porter for kindergarten and teaching her how to hit a baseball. He surely became Ruby’s favorite person. Each of his children and grandchildren were athletes of some kind and he loved watching their games and coached when he could, even his eldest granddaughters NCAA Division 1 cross country races. His daughters remember him always in the stands even at figure skating and Gladstone Cheerleading State competitions.\n\nDave was an avid golfer (more than one hole in one!), organized men’s golf leagues, an active youth sports coach (Little League, 7th grade basketball, junior golf at Escanaba CC), and a spontaneous traveler. His favorite trips with the family were to Grand Marais, Disney World, Kennebunkport, NYC, attending the Masters and US opens, and countless softball excursions throughout the country. One of his favorite memories was winning the 1999 Little League Major State Championship with his daughters. Most recently, he and Dianne did a “bucket list” drive through Yellowstone, Teton, Redwoods, and Glacier National Parks (2021). In 2020, they revisited Kennebunkport where he accepted the challenge to walk to the shore with his walker and told Dianne he wanted to stay, however, he turned around in time for the tide to come in. It was an unforgettable moment that exemplified his perseverance.\n\nDave’s love for life always overcame any physical ailment he endured as he aged. He swam at the YMCA and loved being in the pool. He smiled through a Michigan football game in torrential downpour and worked tirelessly to climb the steps at Detroit Tigers games. He worked as a golf ranger at Sweetgrass, continued to tutor students in math, and was a mainstay at high school basketball games throughout the UP. It was his love for the game that was such a light– any sport, any time, any place. He preferred a high school game over any pro game, as it is the spirit engaging the community that he loved so much.\n\nDave will always be remembered for his gregarious personality, converting strangers to friends with a sincere “what’s happenin?” His text messages (from his flip phone) are already sorely missed by his friends and family.\n\nDave was always in our corner, wearing a baseball “cap”, smiling beyond his limitations, tough beyond measure, and ready for a car ride to anywhere (most especially to friend’s driveways to beep his horn in).\n\nPlease raise a cup of McDonald’s Diet Coke in Dave’s honor!\n\nWe know he’s joined his dog Penny, is dancing to the beach boys, and free to walk and golf once again.\n\nThe Lahtinen family would like to extend a thank you to Dr. Napier, Dr. Steele, Dr. Hayen, Dr. Wallace, both OSF and UP Health Marquette staff for taking such loving care of him.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Dianne, Dave is survived by…\n\nDaughters:\n\nTara Lahtinen (Brian Dunne)\n\nTiffany (Ben) Hewitt\n\nStepchildren:\n\nTim Fox (Sheri)\n\nTammy Woods (John)\n\nGrandkids:\n\nJordan (Victoria), Caleb (Talia), Anthony (preceded in death)\n\nAshlyn (Zach), Allison (Ben), Matthew, Brooke\n\nPorter, Ruby\n\nGreat-grandkids;\n\nLandon and Luca (Jordan and Victoria)\n\nSister:\n\nDianne Malcomb (Delmas)\n\nDave was preceded in death by:\n\nParents:\n\nRalphael and Lourice (Moretti) Lahtinen\n\nGrandson:\n\nAnthony Fox\n\nFamily will receive friends on Thursday, March 17, 2022 from 3:00 until 6:00 PM at First Lutheran Church in Gladstone. A luncheon will be served throughout the visitation. A Funeral service will follow at 6:00 PM with Pastor Elisabeth Daniels officiating. Friends and family are invited to gather at The Freshwater Tavern following the service. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions will be used to establish a scholarship fund in Dave’s memory. The Skradski Family Funeral Homes of Delta County are assisting the Lahtinen family."
