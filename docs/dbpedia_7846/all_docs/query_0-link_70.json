        "text": "Gerald Edelman, who shared a Nobel Prize for his discoveries about antibodies and later labored on one of the toughest problems in science — the nature of consciousness — has died at the age of 84.\n\nEdelman was director of The Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla and was a professor of neurobiology at The Scripps Research Institute. The Neurosciences Institute had operated on property in Torrey Pines Mesa leased from Scripps since the early 1990s, when Scripps recruited him and the institute from The Rockefeller University in New York. In 2012 he moved the institute to a smaller location in downtown La Jolla to focus on theoretical and computational research.\n\nHis work on the structure of antibodies earned him the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with Rodney Robert Porter. Antibodies are huge protein molecules, and their complexity made it difficult to model. Edelman employed chemical methods to break antibodies into substructures. Porter used enzymatic methods. Each approach helped in determining the structure.\n\nEdelman died Saturday at his home in La Jolla from natural causes, Einar Gall, senior vice president of the Neurosciences Institute, said Tuesday.\n\n“In addition to his manifold scientific achievements, Gerry had an exemplary knowledge of science, music, literature, and the visual arts,” Gall said. “He was a brilliant speaker, raconteur, wit, writer for both scientific and lay audiences, and observer of the human condition. Working with him for five decades has been a remarkable and rewarding experience.”\n\n“We offer our condolences to the Edelman family,” Michael Marletta, president and CEO of TSRI, said in a statement. “With Gerry’s passing, the world has lost an independent and creative thinker with a true passion for knowledge. Throughout his long and productive career, he made significant research contributions to remarkably diverse areas of biology.”\n\nEdelman’s work on antibodies alone would have assured him a place in history, not only for his Nobel Prize, but for laying the foundations for much of the biotechnology industry.\n\nAntibodies form a Y shape, formed of four subunits, pairs of what are called light chains and heavy chains. The tips of the branches determine how particular antibodies bind to molecules, such as on the surface of a disease-causing microbe. Today, antibody drugs are used to treat various forms of cancer and autoimmune disease, and are employed as diagnostics. Hybritech, San Diego’s first biotechnology company, was founded in 1978 on the use of antibodies for diagnostics.\n\nThe understanding of antibody structure was necessary for Hybritech and antibody technology in general, said San Diego biotech veteran Ivor Royston, who co-founded Hybritech with Howard Birndorf.\n\n“Without that understanding, there would be no Hybritech. There wouldn’t be anything related to antibodies,” Royston said, likening that understanding to the significance of understanding the structure of DNA.\n\nEdelman also helped develop a theory of how antibodies are generated. The immune system generates a vast number of antibodies with apparently randomly varying shapes, each capable of binding to a particular molecular configuration. But there’s not enough genes in the human genome to code for the number of antibodies the immune system can produce.\n\nEdelman and Joseph A. Gally proposed that genes in the antibody-making immune cells are shuffled and recombine to create antibody diversity. Their theory, published in 1967 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was startling at the time, when genes were considered essentially fixed except in cases of disease. But later experimentation showed it to be correct.\n\nThe selection of antibodies for function bears a strong resemblance to Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, Gall said. But while organisms are selected by the environment, the immune cells are selected for by the immune system itself.\n\nFurther extending the analogy of natural selection, Edelman developed a theory called neuronal group selection, or “Neural Darwinism,” which says group of neurons strengthen or weaken their connections to each other in response to environmental stimuli, Gall said. The interplay between these neuronal groups, called re-entrance, integrates sensory perceptions to form consciousness.\n\n“When a particular stimulus in the environment triggers these cells to fire, to be active, they would be strengthened, and thus when you encountered the same situation again, they would tend to fire again,” Gall said. “The idea was, this large repertoire of variants is both a key part of both embryological development, in terms of your nervous system, and your immune system.”\n\nHe explored various aspects and implications of the theory in a series of books. In 1987, he published the book “Neural Darwinism,” followed by “The Remembered Present,” “Bright Air, Brilliant Fire,” along with “Wider than the Sky: The Phenomenal Gift of Consciousness,” and “Second Nature: Brain Science and Human Knowledge,” in 2006.\n\nEdelman also investigated cell growth and development of multicellular organisms. The work led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules, which guide how cells in animals and plants grow and stick together to achieve their forms. He developed a theory on how this works that was published in PNAS in 1984.\n\nEdelman wrote more than 500 research papers.\n\nEdelman is survived by his wife, Maxine Morrison, sons Eric and David Edelman, and daughter Judith Edelman.\n\nThe family suggests that in lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to the Athenaeum Music and Arts Library, 1008 Wall Street, La Jolla, CA 92037, or to Neurosciences Research Foundation, 800 Silverado St., Ste 302, La Jolla, CA 92037."
