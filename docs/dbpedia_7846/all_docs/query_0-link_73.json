Davis.\n\nVincent T. DeVita and colleagues build on the VAMP chemotherapy regimens of 1961; report first astounding success in cancer remissions with the four-drug chemotherapy protocol of mustargen, oncovin, procarbazine, and prednisone [MOPP] that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Report various subsequent successes in 1967 & 1970.\n\n1966\n\nGynecologist John McLean and biologist Gertrude Van Wagenen at the Yale School of Medicine report the successful use of oral high-dose estrogen pills for post-coital contraception in women and rhesus macaque monkeys respectively.\n\nAmerican internist Victor A.
