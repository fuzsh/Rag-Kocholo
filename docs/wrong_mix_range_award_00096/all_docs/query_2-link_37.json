        "text": "The Leigh Page Prize Lecture series are given each year by a distinguished physicist in honor of Leigh Page who received his PhD in Physics from Yale in 1913. He was later acting Chair and Director of the Sloane Physics Laboratory. Professor Page devoted his time to teaching (mostly graduate classes), research, and writing several textbooks. Since 1967, several speakers in the Leigh Page Prize Lecture series have later received Nobel Prizes and other notable awards. In connection with the lecture series, a prize is offered to first year graduate students in recognition of their fine academic record and for the promise of important contributions to the field of physics.\n\nStarted in 1967\n\n2024 (April): Charles Kane, University of Pennsylvania - April 23, “The Emergence of Topological Quantum Matter”; April 24, “Symmetry, Topology and Electronic Phases of Matter”; and April 25, “Topology of the Fermi Sea”.
