        "text": "Description\n\nLeather Binding\n\nThree volumes of poetry from three famous French lyricists. One Coppee's work, one volume of Leconte de Lisle's work and one volume of Anatole France. With a portrait frontispiece of Coppee to the Coppee volume, and a vignette title page to all volumes. In the original French. Of Coppee's works the two volumes have his Le Reliquaire, Poems Divers, Intimites, Poems Modernes and Le Greve des Forgerons. Leconte de Lisle's work is his Poems Barbares, which is a collection of many poems. The works of Anatole France include his Les Poems Dores, Idylles et Legendes, Les Noces Corinthiennes, Leuconoe, La Pia, La Prise de Voile and L'Auteur a un Ami. Leconte de Lisle was in the Parnassian movement and is traditionally known as his last name. He had three famous poetry collections, of which Poemes Barbares is included. The Parnassian poetic movement shared many values of other poets of his generation, bridging the Romantic and Symbolist periods. Francois Coppee was a French poet and novelist. He was famed as the poet of the humble which is reflected in his verse and prose. His works tend to focus on the plain expressions of emotion, patriotism, young love and pitifulness of the poor. Anatole France was a successful novelist, poet, journalist and man of letters. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in recognition of his literary achievements.\n\nCondition\n\nIn a half morocco binding with paper covered boards. Externally, smart with some rubbing to the extremities of the boards. Some very minor rubbing to the spines, particularly to the raised bands and to the head and tail of spines.
