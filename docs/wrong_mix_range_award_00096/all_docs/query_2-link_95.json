        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn this chapter, I discuss the universal dimensions of reading for Nobel. The Nobel Prize is and has always been considered a universal prize. This is its unique, prestigious and everywhere-acknowledged property. In The World Republic of Letters, Pascale Casanova even writes: “There is no better measure of the unification of the international literary field than the effectively universal respect commanded by this prize.” How effective the prize is to unify the literary world is open to debate, and I will not try to answer that here. I will rather clarify in an analytical way the different and changing meanings of the universal in the history of the prize, characterized by conflicting interpretations of the donor’s will of 1895. I will stress the gradual but slow transition of the prize from a European to a global horizon during the twentieth century, but also to a prize that is more in tune with the developments of modern literature. I will finally touch upon the possible conflicts between the autonomy of aesthetic judgement and what the French philosopher Étienne Balibar has called “the new quarrel of universals”, typical of contemporary debate. This is a question that involves many dimensions of the universal but also puts the legitimacy of the prize in focus.\n\nOlsson, Anders. \"Reading for Nobel and the Idea of the Universal\".
