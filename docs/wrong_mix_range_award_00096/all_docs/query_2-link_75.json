Publishes thesis Uber die Quantenmechanik der Elektronen in Kristallgittern, on the quantum mechanics of electrons in crystal lattices. 1928-29 Assistant in theoretical physics to Wolfgang Pauli in Zurich. Begins work on superconductivity. 1929-30 Fellow of the Lorentz Foundation with H. A. Kramers in Utrecht. 1930-31 Assistant to Heisenberg at the University of Leipzig. 1931 Fellow of the Oersted Foundation with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. 1932-33 Privatdozent in theoretical physics in Leipzig. Begins work on theories of ferromagnetism and of electron conductivity. 1933 Offered position at Stanford University. 1933-34 Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation with Enrico Fermi in Rome. 1934 Leaves Europe to become Acting Associate Professor of physics at Stanford University. 1936 Appointed Professor of Physics at Stanford University. 1937 Elected member of the American Physical Society. 1939 Naturalized as American citizen. 1939-40 Works with Dr. Luis Alvarez of the University of California at Berkeley on the determination of the magnetic moment of the neutron. 1940 Marries Lore Clara Misch on March 14. 1941 Twins George Jacob Bloch and Daniel Arthur Bloch born on January 15. 1942-43 Conducts research at Los Alamos on uranium fission and implosion as part of the Manhattan Project. 1943-45 Associate group leader in the theoretical division of the Radio Research Laboratory at Harvard under direction of F.
