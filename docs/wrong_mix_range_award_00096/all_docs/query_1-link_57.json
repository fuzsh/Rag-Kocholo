        "text": "Science Quotes by Anatole France (11 quotes)\n\nCe qui est admirable, ce n'est pas que le champ des étoiles soit si vaste, c'est que l'homme l'ait mesuré.\n\nThe wonder is, not that the field of the stars is so vast, but that man has measured it.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nDoutons même du doute.\n\nEven doubt the doubt.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nJe suis médecin. Je tiens boutique de mensonges. Je soulage, je console. Peut-on consoler et soulager sans mentir? … Les femmes et les médecins savent seuls combien le mensonge est nécessaire et bienfaisant aux hommes.\n\nI am a physician. I keep a drug-shop of lies. I give relief, consolation. Can one console and relieve without lying? … Only women and doctors know how necessary and how helpful lies are to men.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nL’art d’enseigner n’est que l’art d’éveiller la curiosité des jeunes âmes pour la satisfaire ensuite.\n\nThe whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nLes hommes ne sont pas faits pour savoir; les hommes ne sont pas faits pour comprendre … et nos illusions croissent avec nos connaissances.\n\nMen are not created to know, men are not created to understand … and our illusions increase with our knowledge.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nPour accomplir de grandes choses il ne suffit pas d'agir il faut rêver; il ne suffit pas de calculer, il faut croire.\n\nTo accomplish great things, we must not only act but also dream, not only plan but also believe.\n\n[Referring to the Suez Canal, initiated by Ferdinand de Lesseps.]\n\n— Anatole France\n\nChance may be the pseudonym God uses when He doesn't want to sign His name.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nDistrust even Mathematics; albeit so sublime and highly perfected, we have here a machine of such delicacy it can only work in vacuo, and one grain of sand in the wheels is enough to put everything out of gear. One shudders to think to what disaster such a grain of sand may bring a Mathematical brain. Remember Pascal.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nThe man of science multiples the points of contact between man and nature.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nThe sciences are beneficent. They prevent men from thinking.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nWe find it hard to picture to ourselves the state of mind of a man of older days who firmly believed that the Earth was the centre of the Universe, and that all the heavenly bodies revolved around it. He could feel beneath his feet the writhings of the damned amid the flames; very likely he had seen with his own eyes and smelt with his own nostrils the sulphurous fumes of Hell escaping from some fissure in the rocks. Looking upwards, he beheld ... the incorruptible firmament, wherein the stars hung like so many lamps.\n\n— Anatole France\n\nQuotes by others about Anatole France (1)\n\nNeither the absolute nor the relative size of the brain can be used to measure the degree of mental ability in animal or in man. So far as man is concerned, the weights of the brains or the volumes of the cranial cavities of a hundred celebrities of all branches of knowledge all over the world have been listed. … At the bottom of those lists are Gall, the famous phrenologist, Anatole France, the French novelist, and Gambetta, the French statesman, each with about 1,100 cc brain mass. The lists are topped by Dean Jonathan Swift, the English writer, Lord Byron, the English poet, and Turgenev, the Russian novelist, all with about 2,000 cc … Now our mental test! Had Turgenev really twice the mental ability of Anatole France?"
