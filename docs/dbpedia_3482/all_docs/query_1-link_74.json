        "text": "In this study, three Latin American creators living in the U.S. share their reflections on writing in Spanish but living in English. Three diverse voices and personalities from three different national backgrounds (Chilean, Colombian, and Cuban) describe their respective-and diverging-personal and professional experiences to help us understand what it means to \"write from a place of absence\" stemming from distance from their mother tongue and motherlands.\n\nThis study analyzes the model of the New York Times en Español. From February 2016 to September 2019, this initiative attempted to cultivate a global audience, capitalizing on the world's burgeoning Spanish-speaking population, which is currently greater than 572 million and is forecasted to reach 754 million by the middle of the century. This study outlines the characteristics of the entirely digital project, which was cancelled after it \"did not prove financially successful,\" and focuses on the paper's language policy: in the face of other publications' neutral Spanish, the New York Times en Español demonstrated that it is possible to ensure understanding without hampering cultural and linguistic richness.\n\nAbstract: This study aims to introduce Santayana to present-day North American Hispanists, from whose perspective it analyzes the hybrid or two-pronged nature of his work and life. Santayana offers a paradigmatic mode of being Hispanic and being American, which could be of significant interest: his life and work do not contain nostalgia and alienation but, rather, liberation and release. This study also examines the bilingualism that can be found in all of the translations of his work into Spanish (in both Latin America and Spain), and in his secondary bibliography (works cited as well as the list of publications included as an appendix.)\n\nThis study demonstrates how the toponomy of the United States is a critical tool for understanding the extensive influence of the Spanish language and Hispanic heritage on U.S. culture. It analyzes Spanish place names at the state, county, and municipal levels, combining qualitative and quantitative methods (for state-level names and county-and municipal-level names, respectively) to create a visual sketch of what is already historically documented. Although they have diverse origins, these place names reflect the deep roots of Hispanic history and the Spanish language in the U.S. The data demonstrate that histories of Hispanic colonization are often evidenced in the toponomy of the regions where they occur. The data also show that the legacy of Hispanic colonization has expanded beyond the areas where Spain had a major presence and has become an integral part of U.S. culture more broadly. One confirmation of this is the nation's toponomy.\n\nEver since the US Census Bureau first collected the number of immigrants of Latino or Hispanic origin residing in the country in 1970, that number has continued to grow. This demographic transformation has brought multiple changes to American society, forcing it to rethink various social aspects, such as social class, immigration or race. Thus, the conflict between the racial systems prevailing in the United States and in Latin America has plunged Latinos of color into deep silence for years. Therefore, this study aims to build, first of all, a framework for discussing the current status of Afro-Latinos in the U.S. Second, it analyzes the construction of a trifold conception of identity that emerges from the fact of residing in the U.S. by examining the work of several African-American writers living in this country. It then attempts to establish some points of contact between Afro-Latinos and the U.S. African-American community. Finally, it suggests new lines of research on the individual and collective impact of Afro-Latinos in the United States of America.\n\nSpanish has been fundamental to the definition of Latin music in the U.S. Since the 19 th century, this catchall term has been used to describe a heterogenous catalogue of musical styles that has evolved over time, adapting to the reality of the Hispanic community of each moment. This category's collective imagination, subject matter, and musical practices are in a state of constant transformation, contributing to the rearticulation of the Latino identity for each historic period. This study analyzes the evolution of Latin music from its conception as a category through the current moment. It begins with the pan-Latino context of the 19 th century and pays particular attention to the emergence of pop in the past few decades, including the 'Latino Boom' of the 1990s and through the present day, when a new generation of Latino artists has prompted a number of musical developments broadly referred to as 'urban music.' In this overview, we see how Latin music and its use of the Spanish language have adapted in line with the political, economic, and social status of the Hispanic community in the U.S.\n\nThe meaning of the terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino' in the United States have been debated since their emergence. Some people who identify as Latino or Hispanic claim geographic origin is the identity's defining characteristic, while others argue that internal and external racial perceptions of the group, lived experiences of oppression, or common cultural components are more relevant. This study examines the conception of these identities in the second half of the 20 th century in order to understand part of their current meaning. It analyzes the population that the United States Census classifies as Hispanic/Latino, beginning with the social movements that arose during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s to bring an end to discrimination and achieve legal and representative equality in key U.S. institutions. As time has passed and more people from Latin America and Spain have arrived in the county, the meaning of the terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino' have taken on new dimensions. Nevertheless, these terms refer to an identity that has always had a political component and has always brought together very disparate populations, which it continues to do today."
