        "text": "The new case in the successful series featuring inspector Manuela Mauri. With over 100,000 readers, this combative and literary crime novel explores the links between prostitution and gender violence while also focusing on the personal and intimate side of an inspector who must take better care of her small family if she doesn't want to risk losing them.\n\nAs summer holiday approaches, homicide inspector Manuela Mauri is not at her best. She has recently experienced several events that have made her realize there are feelings and experiences that cannot be put into words, and things that are impossible to name. She feels it when her sons, Manuel and David, tell her about the sudden death of their father (her ex-husband), and she can't find a way to console them. She senses it when she sees Susana's parents, a sixteen-year-old girl who was working as a prostitute and died of an overdose, demanding justice for their daughter in the Lesly Operation trial, and the inspector is sure that, whatever the verdict, nothing will repair such a loss. She deduces it when she faces the gaze of Belén, who has just lost her sister Rebeca to the stabbings inflicted by her former partner. She assimilates it when her own colleague, Alberto, makes the most important proposition of their relationship, and she doesn't know how to respond.\n\n\"Manuela Mauri is one of those characters that any crime novelist would have liked to create: perfectly imperfect.\" César Pérez Gellida\n\n\"Four hands can make a good duo, and from a good duo can come an excellent novel, as this one is. Interesting and enjoyable, it is read with pleasure until the end.\" Alicia Giménez Bartlett\n\nBlacklladolid Prize 2023\n\nA gripping thriller that combines the fast-paced action of films like Bourne and Taken with the literary drive of Lorenzo Silva, a best-selling author in Spain.\n\nPúa is the code name of a former agent of the Company, a secret special unit set up to fight against terrorism. Now, no one would recognize him if they saw him in his new job as a bookseller in the provinces, under a new identity after dedicating the best years of his life to the corps. And he still doesn’t knowing whether he wasted them pointlessly or was making sacrifices to save lives.\n\nWhen an old colleague asks him for help to protect his daughter Vera, caught up in the drug world and bad company, Púa has no choice but to return to action. It does not take him long to discover that Vera is in no way a helpless girl waiting for a knight-errant. Nonetheless, she has got herself into big trouble with a gang of corrupt police officers among whom there are former colleagues from the Company.\n\nForced to act outside the law again, using violent methods and in a race against the clock, Púa settles accounts with his past. In the Company, which has carte blanche to kidnap and execute its enemies, the recruits go through a testing training programme that pushes them to the limit, in search of operatives with a very unusual profile. People ready to give their all on dangerous missions, without flinching, and where there is no time to decide what is right and what is wrong. People like Púa.\n\n“I believe that Púa will mark a before and after in his career. [...] In Púa, Lorenzo demonstrates the mastery of literary maturity in a story that is both powerful and meticulously crafted.” Dolores Redondo\n\n“Púa is undoubtedly the best narrator of his own story: he exposes himself to the reader without judgment or excuses, allowing them to decide the verdict. However, he warns on the first page: there are no heroes in this novel.” Zenda Libros\n\n“The plot and storyline, as always in Silva's work, are impeccably crafted; the architecture, meticulously constructed; and the moral implications, well presented.” El País\n\n“Lorenzo Silva continues down the thriller path that has led him to success over the last quarter-century. Only he knows how to novelize and give identity, without personifying, to those souls who cross the red line.” La Sexta\n\n“Púa is destined to be the thriller of the year.” Lecturalia\n\n“A complex character, full of shades, very aware that ideology is mere chaff when it's not a charade. What matters in understanding what a man does or doesn't do is what activates those levers we all have inside, which can turn us, depending on the lever in question, into either a blessing or a calamity for others.” El Imparcial\n\n“A masterful thriller about the human condition. Púa delves into the heart of the executioner and explores the irreversible life-changing effect of crossing boundaries.” La caixa d’eines\n\n“Lorenzo Silva is one of the great figures in contemporary noir literature. Recognized for his detective novels, with this new thriller, he confronts the heart of the executioner head-on. He achieves something unprecedented: making the reader reflect on the double standards that some human decisions entail. Finally, he will raise new questions about guilt.” El Mundo\n\n“When it comes to his style, I am particularly impressed by his natural eloquence in language use and his honesty in structuring his novels.” César Pérez Gellida, Director of the Blacklladolid festival\n\nA brave fiction about conflicts and those who experience them on the front lines where there is no one ahead.\n\n\"Heráclito says that war is the father of all things. There was a time when war concerned everyone. The fact that in the conflicts of this century only professional soldiers live them on the front lines for us has led us to confuse living in peace with living in the rear. There is a war, there has never ceased to be one, and in it, the course of history is still being decided and the world is being shaped. The only thing that happens is that the vast majority of us look at it from too far away to feel challenged.\" From the prologue, Lorenzo Silva\n\nAlicante, July 2002. Jorge, alias Ruina, is at an Estopa concert when he receives a notice: the Moroccans have taken the islet of Perejil and he, a young sergeant, is mobilized to prepare the operation to recover it. Alongside Jorge and his three comrades, we will experience the assault on the islet, which reveals the existence of the elite unit to which they belong and which is only the prelude to twenty years of operations. From the battle of Nayaf in Iraq in 2004 to the dangerous and compromising evacuation of Kabul airport in 2021, in which the protagonists are the young people whom Jorge and his colleagues give way to and whom they, already mature and on the verge of retirement, have to settle for observing from a distance.\n\nA collection of fiction stories inspired by real events, of high intensity, starring those who volunteer to be in that uncomfortable place where no one is ahead.\n\nQueralt Bonmatí, a young woman from a wealthy family in Barcelona, whose father is linked to Catalan independence and is under judicial investigation, is murdered on the Camino de Santiago. The case will take Bevilacqua from Lugo to Barcelona, the city where he arrived in the days of the Olympic dream, and which in the autumn of 2019 will be set alight with the flame of a long-standing rage.\n\n“One of the best instalments of Bevilacqua’s adventures.” Babelia, El País\n\n“A magnificent novel and the best in the whole police series.” Zenda Libros\n\n“Silva's Civil Guard is the star of a committed involvement in the past and present circumstances of Catalonia. [...] A moving novel.” La Vanguardia\n\n“Bevilacqua understands how to grow old. He resigns himself to the fact that his son has decided to take up the same profession, he turns down promotion in the force, and he continues to be the inveterate reader admired by those around him. This excellent storyteller must have taken the idea of making him so human that nothing human is strange to him from the comedy by the Roman playwright Terence, The Self-Tormentor.” El Cultural\n\n“Lorenzo Silva continues to follow the path of the thrillers that have brought him success during the last quarter of a century. Only he knows how to fictionalize those individuals whose fight take them across the red line, giving them an identity without personification.” La Sexta\n\nThe tenth novel in Lorenzo Silva's acclaimed crime series, with 2,000,000 readers and three film adaptations, takes us back to the years of terror in the Basque Country.\n\nAfter a failed operation in which his most important accomplice, Sergeant Virginia Chamorro, is hospitalised with a bullet wound, Second Lieutenant Bevilacqua travels to Formentera, where a former ETA collaborator has been savagely murdered on a beach.\n\nThe identity of the victim will once again confront Bevilacqua with his past, the difficult years of the anti-terrorist fight in the Basque Country when the police force had to cope with an absolutely hostile, belligerent environment. Now, many years later, Bevilacqua returns on duty to Guipúzcoa, where the fratricidal war has ended but the embers of enmity and resentment are still burning.\n\n\"A wonderful popular novel that succeeds in interweaving the epic with an accurate and endearing lesser realism.\" Carlos Pardo, Babelia, El País\n\n\"Lorenzo Silva has achieved that elusive balance between the clean form of a crime story and consistency in the portrayal of a time and a world. [...] Silva is as thorough in his descriptions of the inner workings of the Civil Guard as Le Carré when he writes about British espionage... \" Antonio Muñoz-Molina, Babelia, El País\n\n\"A history lesson. Lorenzo Silva has published the umpteenth adventure of his pair of civil guards, Bevilacqua and Chamorro, and in this one he has given the former character an ageing quality that, in addition to evoking the world of John Ford, confronts us with a number of our contemporary demons. \" Carles Francino, El Periódico\n\nA historical novel that moves around the history of the military uprising in Barcelona on July 19th, 1936.\n\nGeneral Aranguren is a little-known figure who played a highly relevant role in the early days of the Spanish Civil War. As the general in command of the Civil Guard in Barcelona, he refused to cooperate with the uprising and remained faithful to the government of the Republic. When rebel troops finally entered Barcelona, Franco ordered his execution by firing squad.\n\nLorenzo Silva relates his encounter with a descendant of General Aranguren’s, who encourages him to dig deeper into the life of this heroic figure. Fascinated by Aranguren, he discovers parallels with his own grandfathers, who fought in the war on opposite sides. Silva decides to tell Aranguren’s story to rescue him from the unfair obscurity to which he was relegated by Franco’s version of history.\n\nIn a detailed analysis of the events, including exhaustive historical research, an introspective journey into his own family’s past, and reflexions on the often unfair treatment history gives to the defeated, Lorenzo Silva writes one of the best stories literature can offer about the Spanish Civil War.\n\n“This formidable novel by Lorenzo Silva is undoubtedly one of his best books not starring Civil Guards Bevilacqua and Chamorro.” José María Pozuelo Yvancos, ABC\n\n“Silva achieves the prodigious task of remaining distant and unbiased, and does not fall into the easy trap of Manichaean interpretation.” Javier Sampedro, El País\n\n\"Silva’s literary role models are authors such as Ramón J. Sender and Manuel Chaves Nogales, champions of the laudable task of “remembering civilization and not barbarism.” P.

Civil Guard lieutenant Bevilacqua is a veteran criminal investigator. In his fifties, with more past than future in his career, he has just messed up spectacularly in his pursuit of a killer in a shanty town on the outskirts of the capital. He is miraculously rescued by colleagues of his, but his quarry escapes him.\n\nHe has barely emerged from this disaster, with his patrol car and his pride battered, when he takes a call from his former boss, General Pereira, who is now responsible for the Spanish Civil Guard’s international operations. The general tells him that things can always get worse, even the harshness of the place where he has to do his job. As a proof, he orders Bevilacqua to leave at once for the Spanish base at Herat, six thousand kilometres away in Afghanistan, where a sinister incident has occurred. The dead body of a Spanish officer has been found in his bed, with his throat cut. Beside him, the murder weapon: a folding sickle typical of those used by the Afghans to harvest the poppies that are used to produce the drug that provides the country with its main source of income. Is the murderer an infiltrated Taliban fighter? That is one possibility, but the crime might have a different origin altogether, because the attack does not correspond to the usual Taliban tactic of using a suicide bomber to cause maximum damage. And this folding sickle is a souvenir that can be purchased for ten euros in the market run every Sunday at the base: almost all the Spanish military personnel take one home in their backpack. The killer could be anyone.\n\nBevilacqua takes with him his battle-hardened female sergeant Chamorro (who has just turned forty), corporal Salgado (somewhat older, but still in full possession of her womanly wiles) and officer Arnau (reaching the end of his twenties). The lieutenant and his team have to leave on the first available plane in order to investigate on the ground in Afghanistan who the dead man was and the reasons behind his death.\n\nDuring their investigation, in the searing heat and dust of the Afghan summer, they meet a fascinating array of characters and to dig into the dead man’s past. It soon becomes obvious that this veteran of several military operations outside Spain (euphemistically known as peace-keeping or reconstruction missions), had more than one skeleton in his cupboard, and leads them to an unexpected and bewildering climax that will test them to their limits in this strange, complex scenario.\n\nPrimavera de Novela Award 2004\n\nAfter reading just the first page of Carta blanca we know that, in spite of some very general similarities regarding foreign legionnaires, this is not going to be another Beau Geste (1924). Lorenzo Silva replaces Percival Wren’s exoticism and romance with stark realism best designated as neotremendista. Additionally, the list of references at the end of the novel reveals that factual accuracy underpins his imagination and that what he learned about the role of the Spanish Legion in Morocco forced him to describe the indescribable. According to the author, soldiers of the Spanish Foreign Legion had carte blanche (\"carta blanca\") to plunder Berber settlements suspected of collaboration with the insurgency that resisted the foreign occupiers. Officers tolerated the unofficial practice, known in legionnaire vernacular as salir de razia , literally, \"to go on a plundering spree.\" The tripartite story begins in 1921 when the protagonist, Juan Faura, goes plundering with five other comrades. The home of the shepherd family that the soldiers break into becomes a living hell: screaming children clinging to their parents and relatives; a young girl and a woman in her thirties gang-raped; another woman bayonetted to death; an elderly man and two boys with slit throats; and, to complete the slasher scene, a man whose penis they sever. Moreover, upon reading these atrocities, it becomes clear that the author recounts them out of a deep sense of rage. And although the crimes do not compare to those of the Japanese in China, documented by Iris Chang in her convulsant The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II (1997), they do bring to mind what some of the troops did during the war in Vietnam and, more recently, in Iraq. Wisely, the author tempers the depravities of the first section of the novel with an erotic interlude that comprises the second section. Faura, now separated from the legion, and Blanca, his exlover, now married, take up where they left off twelve years earlier. As in Entre naranjos (1901) by Blasco Ibáñez, here too the sensuous Valencian milieu serves as a reagent for the erotica that follows. Whereas Vicente Blasco Ibáñez depended on suggestion for his seduction scene, Silva opts for full disclosure. The final section of the novel finds Juan Faura defending the Republic at the outbreak of the Spanish civil War in 1936. Gravely wounded, Juan is approached by two enemy combatants, one a legionnaire who recognizes him, the other a Moorish mercenary who is poised to cut his throat. What transpires in the next few moments defies all logic, except that of a legionnaire. Silva avoids demonizing. When the boot is on the other foot, so to speak, the Moors rape and kill Spaniards.\n\nCarta blanca is a cautionary tale that exposes the utter absurdity of war and the unspeakable evils it unchains.\n\nEl nombre de los nuestros is a disturbing story based partly on oral accounts transmitted to Lorenzo Silva by his grandfather and father and partly on the author’s archival research about Spain’s protracted expeditionary war in the western Sahara during the 1920s. Toward the end of the novel a hard-bitten sergeant is talking with a young recruit who has survived his tour of duty in Morocco and will soon return to Spain. The boy remarks on the capriciousness of war, how some live, some die, and his premonition that each soldier has a bullet with his name on it that will eventually kill him. The sergeant replies that every bullet that finds its mark carries the name of the universal soldier, \"el nombre de los nuestros\", and that every soldier should remember those who died, regardless of the flag under which they had fought.\n\nAlthough this statement of soldierly solidarity occurs at the end of the novel, from the outset we sense a cruel dichotomy between the designers and the fighters of wars. This sentiment intensifies when Silva’s virtual-reality descriptions let us feel what life was like in the trenches. Although these soldiers fought in the deserts of North Africa over eighty years ago, they hauntingly resemble the young grunts sent to the jungles of Vietnam. In fact, as the novel progresses, it seems Silva could have co-written the screenplays for Oliver Stone’s Platoon and Stanley Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket through the force of an intricate prose that infects us with the anxiety felt by his protagonists. Silva sustains the supercharged mélange of terror and impending doom by trifurcating the story line among the battle fronts of Sidi Dris, Afrau, and the hellhole of Talilit. Specifically, each chapter involves us in what is taking place at a particular position, and just when the action seems to reach the boiling point, the author breaks away to the fighting at another front; and so on almost up to the end of the story. His achievement of suspended crescendo produces unforgettable impressions. Silva’s study in horror engages all five senses: we watch dumbstruck the disembowelment of a soldier whose captors laugh at his attempt to contain his intestines; hear the shrieks of another who is being castrated; feel the maddening thirst of humans pushed to the extreme of imbibing their own urine; taste the rancid pork from swine fed on human body parts; and inhale the ubiquitous odor of gangrene and dysentery. The only moments of respite from this Dantesque existence come when Silva shifts his focus from land to sea and portrays life aboard the navy rescue ships. However, these interludes serve only as a torturer’s pause lest we succumb prematurely to the pain that we must still endure in an attempt to understand man’s inhumanity to man.\n\nEl nombre de los nuestros is a biting indictment of a contemporary attitude of those of us who, despite all the wars and concomitant suffering, have yet to see human life as the sine qua non of our all.\n\nPremio Nadal 2000\n\n2nd book of Bevilacqua and Chamorro Series\n\nThe protagonists of El alquimista impaciente are criminal investigator Rubén Bevilacqua and his assistant, Virginia Chamorro, who represent the new look of the Spanish Guardia Civil that has attracted a growing number of young professionals to its ranks for the first time in its history.\n\nThe opening scene of El alquimista impaciente combines classic noir and contemporary cinematic shock: a nude bodylying face down on a motel bed, wrists bound to the bedposts... Soon we learn that the body is that of Trinidad Soler, a middle-aged family man who worked as a radiation-safety specialist at a nuclear power plant northeast of Madrid. According to the desk clerk, the victim checked in the night before, accompanied by a stunning, tall blond woman in her early twenties. The body was discovered by an understandably upset and perplexed femme de chambre. The autopsy that identifies the cause of death as a heart attack partially confirms the investigators’ theory that sexual ecstasy contributed to Sr. Soler’s demise, but it also detects high levels of cocaine, bromazepam, and alcohol in the blood.\n\nIn their quest for killers, Silva places before us the sterile lives of the nouveaux riches in the fashionable foothills north of Madrid, provincial politicians on the take, arrogant, tax-cheating land developers, paranoid public-relations directors of nuclear facilities, and East European girls caught up in the lucrative sex industry in and around Madrid. In truth, it is difficult to know where detective work stops and social criticism begins, or if in Silva’s incursion into noir both are gratifyingly part and parcel of this exhilarating, eye-opening journey into the side alleys of contemporary Madrid.\n\nOjo Crítico Award 1998\n\nNo. 1 Bevilacqua and Chamorro Series\n\nLorenzo Silva´s crime novel feels initially like an enigma or mystery story à la Agatha Christie but soon has the ring of a crime story à la Raymond Chandler. Like Chandler´s pulp crime stories that transpire on the dark side of sunlit Los Angeles, Silva´s novel moves in the shadows of sunny Mallorca. Understandably, some major differences prevail. Silva´s bizarre title, El lejano país de los estanques (The Faraway Country of the Ponds), taken from a page by Virginia Woolf, sounds unlike that of any pulp crime story but nevertheless holds the clue to the strange events that unfold. Moreover, whereas in Chandler the investigators are private dicks, Silva chooses as his sleuths two individuals from Spain´s new Guardia Civil who have nothing in common with their infamous predecessors known metonymically as tricornios. In fact, Sergeant Bevilacqua and his younger assistant Virginia Chamorro more closely resemble FBI agents or federal marshals.\n\nBevilacqua (or \"Vila\") and Chamorro have been summoned from Madrid by the Guardia Civil in a Mallorcan hamlet to help solve the murder of a young Austrian woman whose nude body with two gunshot wounds was found hanging from a crossbeam in the living room of a seaside chalet –or more succintly, as one of the local gendarmes who found the body commented to Vila and Chamorro, \"una tía desnuda con un par de balazos. Como en Los Angeles.\" (a naked chick with a couple of bullet holes. Like in Los Angeles). Although superficially accurate, the gendarme´s oversimplification could not foreshadow that the trail of clues leading back from the hanging body to the perpetrator of the crime would immerse Vila and Chamorro in Mallorca lesbian´s subculture.\n\nShort-listed for one of the most prestigious literary awards in Spain before being made into a successful film, The Faint-hearted Bolshevik has, over the fifteen years since its first edition, become an undisputed classic of contemporary Spanish literature. One morning in a traffic jam on his way to work, a driver is distracted and slams into the car in front. When the woman driving the other car reacts with a torrent of abuse out of all proportion to the incident, the driver cracks and decides to teach her a lesson, by dedicating his whole summer to ruining this foul woman’s life. But his plans for revenge are thrown by the sudden appearance of Rosana, his intended victim’s compelling teenage sister, and he finds himself and his base instincts severely tested … Caught up in this impossible affair, the man’s thoughts turn in moments of weakness to that famous photo of the last Tsar’s daughters, as he tries to put himself in the place of the Bolshevik hired to kill the beautiful Grand Duchess Olga; a man who was surely, just like him, a victim of his own faint-heartedness. So, within a story somewhere between comedy, suspense and melodrama, Lorenzo Silva uses his main character to present a vicious critique of today’s world of work, and the inner conflicts of a frustrated middle-aged man, which is at the same time a story of ill-fated love with an unexpected twist.\n\nLorenzo Silva presents his observation diary of the first fifty days of lockdown in our country due to COVID-19.\n\n\"If there's one thing I believe I've learned from all this, it's that human nature is not going to change significantly, just as it didn't according to the testimony of the ancients after other similar episodes. However, one would have to be very blind not to see that this crisis has exposed many of the seams of our world. Humanity will continue to be more or less what it was, but in a different world. Better or worse, partly depends on us.\"\n\nSince the state of alarm was declared due to the global health crisis of COVID-19, Lorenzo Silva has been writing day by day, up to fifty, a diary reflecting the situation of our country and its people during confinement. With his lucid, incisive, and literary gaze, this is a unique testimony, an observation diary, of the early days of a pandemic that has already changed us forever as a society and as individuals.\n\nIn a reflective and profound text, which does not avoid light remarks, irony, or evasion, Lorenzo Silva draws on his readings and the experiences of an ordinary citizen subjected to confinement, but also on the tales of harshness and sacrifice that reach him from those on the front line of the fight against the disease, to remind us of who we are and to outline an inventory of everything the virus has revealed to us and we should never forget."
