        "text": "José María Gironella (born December 31, 1917, Darníus, Gerona, Spain—died January 3, 2003, Arenys de Mar) was a Spanish author best remembered for his long historical novel Los cipreses creen en Dios (1953; The Cypresses Believe in God), in which the conflicts within a family portrayed in the novel symbolize the dissension that overtook the people of Spain during the years preceding the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. The book, which won the National Prize for Literature, was the first explanation of the origins of that war that was well received by the Spaniards themselves.\n\nGironella’s formal education ended when he left a Roman Catholic seminary; he worked at menial jobs until the civil war started and then joined the Nationalist army. After the fighting stopped he worked as a newspaper reporter and correspondent. In 1945 he published a volume of poetry and in 1946 his first novel, Un hombre (Where the Soil Was Shallow), which won the Nadal Prize.\n\nThe chronicle begun in Los cipreses was continued with Un millón de muertos (1961; One Million Dead) and Ha estallado la paz (1966; Peace After War), neither of which achieved the popular acclaim of the earlier novel. Condenados a vivir (1971; “Condemned to Live”) is the story of two families of Barcelona during 1939–67, while the fourth novel of the series, Los hombres lloran solos (1986; “The Men Cry Alone”), continues his analysis of the Spanish Civil War. Gironella also wrote short stories, memoirs, books based on travels to China and Japan, and essays."
