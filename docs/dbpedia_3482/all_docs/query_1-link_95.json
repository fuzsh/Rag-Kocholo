Of course, there had long been a small but faithful public of specialists and aficionados. However, the new awareness was an entirely different matter: many people now found themselves interested in Spanish America as a result of reading its literature, rather than the other way round. This reader reaction is highly significant since many earlier novels were picturesque—exotic, the way travel books are. Undoubtedly, the basic explanation of the new interest in the 1960s is that Spanish American fiction shows more artistic originality than ever before. The books, therefore, are more likely to provide valid literary experiences, regardless of whether or not they have regionalistic aspects. Often the word boom is used in connection with the phenomenon of the 1960s, in Spanish America itself and in other countries. The usage is entirely justified, because the amount of high-quality fiction has increased enormously. In terms of publicity, the increase in quantity and quality has been given a push by the international activity—the high profile—of writers like Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa. With this fact in mind, it is well to remember that two highlights in our enthusiasm for Spanish Americanfictionare writers who belong to an earlier generation: Miguel Angel Asturias and Jorge Luis Borges. Asturias won the Nobel Prize in 1967 in recognition of a body of work that fictionalizes the myths and problems of Guatemala. Borges, the great storyteller, has written only short fiction but has contributed as much as anyone to the Spanish American novel through his insistence on the novelist's right to invent. Both careers began in the 1920s. In an in-between generation, Juan Rulfo and Julio Cortázar\n\nPreface constitute a similar pair, Rulfo mythologizing the reality of the rural Mexican, Cortázar annihilating logic in works where the regionalistic factor is of no practical importance. The fact is that the tradition of the novel in Spanish America is long and substantial. Its recent excellence indicates an age of maturity that encourages the writers to invent and innovate. However, the boom should not be allowed to obscure all the good that has gone before; and, in fact, there are a number of studies that deal with the Spanish American novel (see Bibliography). Fernando Alegría's outline history is a handbook covering the subject from the Colonial Period to the early 1960s. Alberto Zum Felde's study is a history of the genre terminating at about the middle of the twentieth century. Both books are stronger on general trends than on critical analysis. More recently, Kessel Schwartz has published a history of Spanish American fiction from the Colonial Period to the late 1960s. Its organization is based on the traditionally recognized literary movements and phenomena. The study contains many plot synopses, frequent critical judgments, occasional analytical comment, and a copious bibliography. Another recent study, by Cedomil Goic, organizes the material by generations and concentrates on analyses of fewer novels. Arturo Torres Rioseco and J. R. Spell published collections of essays on authors, including most of the big names of the first forty years of the century. Spell's book contains detailed plot summaries and critical evaluations with a limited amount of specific analysis. Torres Rioseco's essays include the results of interviews with the writers as well as studies of their works. His critical observations place great emphasis on the psychological validity of characterization. Luis Harss's Into the Mainstream also uses a combination of interview and literary analysis in dealing with much more recent authors. The book is published in both English and Spanish versions and is the best way for a recently interested reader to begin learning about the novels and their authors. Harss makes some errors of fact as well as a few questionable judgments in his general statements about the novel's trajectory in Spanish America. However, his insight is often keen, and the best quality of his book is that it provides a sense of the work of each author. There are, of course, many books that deal with the novel in different countries and with various aspects of prose fiction. My χ\n\nPreface purpose in the present book is to study the development of the genre in Spanish America as a whole, during the twentieth century. Emphasis is on works rather than on authors, and I have resisted the temptation of putting all the works of a single author in one place. The study of fiction on an author-by-author basis is important and interesting. My purpose here, however, is to study the novel as a cultural organism; therefore, the structure of this book depends on the dynamic factors in the genre, rather than on biography. A novel belongs to a culture. It may transcend limitations of time and space, but even that fact is important to the understanding of the cultural milieu in which it is created. This consideration is not necessarily related to questions of ideological commitment. In many cases it is appropriate to show how a fictional experience of a given situation differs from a documentary recording of the same situation. The procedure, however, is not to dwell on contrasts, but to point out the factors that transform incident into art. Although I have used many sources of historical information, the basic reference used throughout preparation of the study is A History of Latin America, by Hubert Herring (New York: Knopf, 1968). I believe it is reasonable to begin this study at the entrance to the twentieth century because Spanish American novels from 1900 to 1930 show all the major characteristics of fiction during the nineteenth century and, in addition, the earliest adventures in innovation. The termination of the study in 1970 is a matter of practical necessity. Its preparation demanded that cut-off point. There is, however, some reason to think the future may regard it as a good stopping place in any case. The new novel in Spanish America was well established by 1970. The writers now enjoy an unprecedented self-confidence. A spectacular decade has invited the attention of readers throughout the world. Although many excellent novels will surely be coming from Spanish America, it is not likely that they will create an effect as dramatic as the phenomenon of the 1960s. There is always some question about the extent to which Spanish America can be studied as a whole. Even books that claim to do so very often turn out to have national or regional divisions. One of the secondary purposes of the present study is to test the possibility of dealing with the novel while avoiding such divisions. In order to enhance the effect of unity, I have not mentioned the nationality of xi\n\nPreface novels gratuitously. When this kind of identification is necessary for clear explanation, it is included in the text. In other cases, nationalities of authors, and also their dates, may be found in the index after each author's name. A list, at the end of the book, illustrates the basis of the book's organization. The list does not contain all Spanish American novels published during the years indicated; it is not supposed to be a bibliography. It serves as a graphic representation of the trends, coincidences, and contrasts that make up my concept of the Spanish American novel. In the text of the book, this material is presented in two different kinds of chapters. Some concentrate on particular years and depend primarily on a single novel, as in the chapter entitled \"The Year of Los de abajo.\" The other chapters are panoramic and cover periods of intervening years between the appearance of key works. This organization has the advantage of adding a dimension to what we normally expect in a panorama of literature, because it permits us to see more clearly all the aspects of the genre at a specific point in time. Some of the novels included in the \"Year of . . .\" chapters would have to be left out if the book were entirely panoramic. Therefore, the two kinds of chapters tend to correct a distortion that might be created if either kind were used exclusively. Naturally, problems of whether to include or exclude a novel become acute as the study progresses. The question of which ones to emphasize is just as difficult. It is the age-old problem faced by anthologists, and the solutions are never entirely satisfactory. From the beginning I have tried not to be unduly influenced either by traditional emphases or by fashionable canons of taste. As the study progressed, it is fair to say that I tended to emphasize overlooked novels that change our understanding of what prose fiction was like at a given time: Op Oloop, La casa de cartón, and Noveh como nube, for example. I have also attempted to \"rescue\" some excellent novels—books whose merits are recognized by all their readers, but whose fame has been restricted by the general excellence of the last decade. Among them are Job-Boj, La comparsa, El día señalado, and Los habitantes. Sometimes I have been aware of readers measuring the space allotted to particular works, in studies similar to this one. It should be clearly understood that in the present book there is absolutely no correlation between my estimate of a novel's aesthetic value and the xii\n\nPreface number of words I have used in writing about it. In some cases, novels included in panoramic chapters receive much less detailed treatment than if they were in a \"Year of . . . \" chapter. In all cases, the amount of attention accorded a book is governed by what characteristics are most enlightening in a particular context. In speaking of the novels, I have avoided, as far as possible, words that have special meanings for particular groups of critics or teachers of literature. However, I have used two words that are important in my own vocabulary of criticism and that might create some confusion: experience and dynamism. I speak of the experience of a novel—by that I mean the process of its coming into being, whether from the standpoint of the author or the standpoint of the reader. This act refers to appreciation of a work of art, but as a dynamic phenomenon rather than as a fait accompli. To put it another way, a work of art is an experience, not a document; what we learn from it is not just the product of the experience, but the experience itself. My use of dynamism, or dynamic, is closely related. I use it in connection with the factors in a novel that vitalize the experience, transforming the anecdotal base of the work offictionand sustaining the process of growth and change throughout the novel. Several technical matters invite comment. First, the passages translated in this book are mine unless otherwise noted. Second, when referring to a novel several times, I have used a note citation only in the first instance. After that, page references appear parenthetically within the text. Third, and most important, it is desirable to clarify a term—Spanish America or Spanish American. I refer to the countries of the Western Hemisphere where Spanish is the principal language. The term is different from Latin America, which includes Brazil, where Portuguese is spoken, and Haiti, where the language is French. It may be convenient sometimes to speak of Latin America as a whole, in some political or sociological context. It is hardly ever suitable, however, in speaking of literature, because language is the primary ingredient, and this fact modifies all but the most general statements. Finally, readers interested in English translations of the novels studied here should consult Latin American Fiction and Poetry in Translation, by Suzanne Jill Levine (New York: Center for Inter-American Relations, 1970). A matter that is decidedly nontechnical and of fundamental importance is the fact of my own foreignness. No one working in a foreign xiii\n\nPreface literature can possibly see his material with the sense of cultural identification that is natural in dealing with one's native literature. I hope that genuine interest in Spanish American culture, combined with visits to some of the countries, will serve as a reasonably adequate compensation. My efforts have been assisted by support from the General Research Fund of the University of Kansas and by a travel grant from the Joint Committee on Latin American Studies, awarded through the Social Science Research Council. Prominent among my acknowledgments I am pleased to say that several libraries in Spanish America served me extremely well. These institutions have often been criticized harshly by scholars and even by the general public. In all cases, I was aware of the general shortage of funds; but I found a very high percentage of the material I needed, and much friendly assistance. Many students have contributed to this study, particularly in seminars and in dissertations. Several are mentioned in the notes. I do wish to mention here the names of two former students who were also my research assistants: Stella T. Clark and Karen Hardy. Another group deserving special thanks is made up of four excellent critics, who unselfishly let me use manuscripts of their works prior to publication: Osvaldo Larrazábal Henríquez, Raymond D. Souza, Martin S. Stabb, and Jaime Valdivieso. It would be impossible, of course, to name—or even remember— all the people who have contributed to this study. However, I recall with gratitude and admiration the names of some who made special efforts to help, in many different ways: suggesting books, resolving literary puzzles, reading manuscript, arranging interviews, and listening patiently. Prominent among them are Demetrio Aguilera Malta, Fernando Alegría, Pedro F. de Andrea, Jorge Barros T., Alfonso Calderón, Alberto Escobar, Sergio Galindo, Cristóbal Garcés Larrea, Juan Carlos Ghiano, Luisa Mercedes Levinson, Néstor Madrid Malo, Eduardo Mallea, Juan Mejía Baca, Pedro Orgambide, José Miguel Oviedo, Gustavo Sainz, Manuel Zapata Olivella, and Roberto Yahni. I certainly do not wish to hold them accountable for any shortcomings the book may have; rather, I hope they may find some satisfaction that suitably rewards their friendly cooperation. JOHN S. BRUSHWOOD\n\nXIV\n\nThe Spanish American Novel\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915)\n\nA retrospective view of the turn of the century may create a false impression of serenity if we allow generalities to absorb and obscure illuminating nuances. In the political realm, for example, it is deceptively easy to focus on the peculiar stability of certain strong-arm governments while ignoring the general state of unrest. In literature, the period seems to find expression in two modes: a dreamily idealistic, art-for-art's-sake modernismo, and the earthy revelations of realism and naturalism. Actually, these three kinds of writing are more closely related than their definitions might suggest. The meanings of realism and naturalism parallel each other and even join in Spanish American fiction. They are sometimes used indiscriminately to refer to novels that emphasize the seamy side of life to the exclusion of human goodness. There has been, and still is, a good deal of discussion as to whether one novel or another is deterministic enough to be considered naturalist. Realism sometimes refers to technique, sometimes to verisimilitude. Part of the problem is that, with rare exceptions, novels are not written to serve as examples of literary terms; rather, literary terms are a means of describing novels, always with reservations. The clinical view is the\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) most interesting function of naturalism in Spanish America. It is more accurate to speak of naturalist tendencies in novels than of naturalist novels. Realism's most important function is to focus attention on the distinguishing characteristics of the New World. Narrative techniques overlap. Modernismo is a more difficult problem. Often its importance in prose fiction is overlooked because poetry seems to be a more appropriate vehicle for the eternal search for beauty. Modernismo—the name of the movement itself—is highly significant because it indicated the intention of belonging to the mainstream of literature. Its writers reacted against many of the excesses of romanticism but retained the romantics' yearning for the unattainable. The search brought them into contact with the poetry of French symbolism and Pamassianism and strengthened their dedication to what may be called the grand poetic tradition—that is, all kinds of poetry of earlier times. Their interest in being modern also brought them faceto-face with the unimaginative society of the time and created an intense reaction that turned into hyperaestheticism. The notion was that everybody was against the artist. His subsequent rebellion— often taken for escapism—was an eloquent protest against the mediocrity of the world he lived in. This idea related the modernistas to the French decadentists. It is also the most convenient point for the observation of modernista prose fiction. The year 1900, naturally, does not mark a specific point of change in the Spanish American novel. The tendencies apparent at century's end, and for some years thereafter, are characteristic of a period that may reasonably be dated from 1885. At the turn of the century, we have a showcase of what the twentiethcentury Spanish American novel inherited from the past. Occupying prominent places in this display are several novels where the spiritual, vague idealism of modernismo is in obvious contrast to the practical outlook of realism-naturalism. The more practical way of looking at the world accepts objective awareness as the only knowledge and attempts to deal with humanity's problems on that level. The aesthete-idealists were not willing to settle for so little. Their search was based on the presumed possibility of cultivating an awareness that would separate individual men from the dull conformity exacted by a practical society. In spite of this diametrical opposition, both sides end in a sense of futility, although for different reasons 4\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) in the two cases. Hernán Vidal discusses this phenomenon as it relates to Manuel Díaz Rodriguez's Sangre patrida (1902).1 He deals with symbolism, one of the major components of modernismo, and with naturalism as we understand it in the works of Emile Zola. Relying principally on Ralph Freedman's The Lyrical Novel, he shows that symbolist perception of objects transforms them gradually into representations of the beholder's interior emotion. The object observed, therefore, transcends the reality it has as part of our objective awareness; but it ceases to be of worldly use to the symbolist, who, therefore, withdraws from the everyday, commonplace world. The creature of naturalism, of course, is defeated by physiological circumstances that repress his development. The two apparent opposites, therefore, come together as representations of futility, in terms of the everyday world. Hardly an optimistic start for the new century. There is more to the sense of futility, however, than this coincidence of literary philosophy with literary science. One of the reasons for the insistence on art was the feeling that the world—and life—was ugly. Resignation from this distasteful world was not just an escape; it was also a protest. The insensitivity of everybody else—the bourgeoisie because of materialistic greed, the masses because of ignorance—stood between the artist and the creation of a perfect society. In Sangre patricia, Díaz Rodríguez brings this problem to life by using a shifting narrative point of view that Andrew Debicki has analyzed in his explanation of the novel.2 The analysis shows that Díaz Rodriguez's reader sees the protagonist, Tulio Arcos, in two different ways: at times with intimate sympathy for his dreamy idealism, but often in a more detached, clinical fashion. Technically, there is no change in narrative point of view, since the entire novel is written in the third person. There is, however, a change in narrative attitude. The third-person voice alters the distance between narrator and character, sometimes standing apart from Tulio, then almost taking Tulio's position. The anecdotal base of Sangre patricia is slight and commonplace except for one detail. Tulio Arcos is in Paris, awaiting the arrival of Belén, whom he has married by proxy. (This is the unusual detail.) The bride dies and is buried at sea. After that, nothing happens until Tulio commits suicide—in the sea, of course—at the end of the novel and after long and sometimes tiresome discussions with 5\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) his friends about his lack of adjustment to the loss of Belén. What then makes this book come alive? Debicki has stated the basic experience very clearly in pointing out that \"by making us shift, again and again, from one [narrative attitude] to the other, Díaz Rodríguez forces us to keep picking our way among two very opposite outlooks on life, one elevated and romantic, the other down-to-earth and pragmatic.\"3 There is a second important factor in the reader's experience of this book. It is the translation of tangible reality into attitudes or feelings, by means of symbolist imagery. First, it is convenient to observe that Tulio's problem of adjustment is more philosophical than psychological, though literary critics' love for psychological character development often produces a slightly oblique reading of the novel. Debicki suggests the philosophical nature of the problem when he speaks, in the lines quoted above, of \"two very opposite outlooks on life.\" The contrast is personified later in two of the protagonist's helpful associates: Borja the idealist, and the pragmatic Ocampo. The author introduces a possible compromise in the person of Martí, a musician who has made his peace with social institutions. Within the experience of the novel, however, Martí never represents an acceptable choice, because his compromise always seems dull, mediocre. Tulio's ultimate decision is not the result of a neurosis, however neurotic he (and the other characters, for that matter) may be. It is his choice of a particular view of life. The unusual detail of the marriage by proxy plays an important role in the communication of his attitude. Díaz Rodríguez constructs the narrative so we see Belén only in the first chapter, when she is on her way to France. The chapter ends with her death. In the second chapter, the narrative moves back with Tulio to a preceding time; and then the third chapter begins after Belén's death. This structure enhances Tulio's idealized vision of his bride. She is vanishing reality. Material reality also vanishes in the mist of symbolist imagery. The world of tangible reality becomes useless to Tulio Arcos, and suicide is the act that has most meaning. At this point, the reader has to be affected by the basic contrast in the novel, unless his own view of life corresponds to Tulio's. Within the novel, and within a nonobjective frame of reference, Tulio's decision is perfectly acceptable. But if we withdraw and take the clinical view, 6\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) we face the problem of whether he was right. Certainly his solution does not promise a long future for humanity. The idealist-pragmatist contrast in the philosophical problem of the novel corresponds to the symbolist-clinical contrast in the author's narrative technique. Thinking in terms of literary movements or modes, the same contrast corresponds to modernismo, on the one hand, and realism-naturalism, on the other. Then, moving outside the strictly literary world, the contrast lies between some kind of intuitional view of reality (Bergson, for example) and the practical world of positivism. The contrast also affects our understanding of Tulio Arcos as he is related to the world in which the novel was conceived and developed. Taking the idealist view, Tulio Arcos is a rebel against a materialistic, practical society; from the clinical position, he is an aristocrat who is out of step with social and political changes taking place in Venezuela, and with the more general predominance of an unimaginative bourgeoisie. Debicki speaks of Tulio's efforts \"to rise above a pretty horrible world.\" The world was, in truth, less than delightful. In addition to universal human failings, Spanish America suffered political problems that produced general unrest. Occasional references to a period of stability in the latter part of the nineteenth century are misleading. There are indeed some instances of strong-arm peace that fostered material progress. Railroads were built, for example, and also schools, but these were built with less enthusiasm than railroads. The presumably progressive programs, in any case, were carried out by leaders who desperately wished to transform backward countries into modern European states. In spite of this programmed activity, Spanish America was not relatively stable at century's end; it was chaotic. Venezuela was still gasping from the Guzmán Blanco dictatorship when Cipriano Castro swooped down from the hills in 1899 and established a dictatorship that lasted until he turned it over to Juan Vicente Gómez in 1908. The Castro revolution was the first invasion of hill people (andinos) into the placid ambience of aristocratic Caracas. In Argentina, Leandro N. Alem led a middle-class revolution against ex-President Roca and the oligarchs, in 1890. Although the revolution was only a partial success, it forced Roca's puppet, Juárez Celman, out of office in favor of Carlos Pellegrini and solidi7\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) fled the Radical party, which rebelled again in 1905 and finally elected Hipólito Irigoyen in 1916. Colombia was embroiled in a vicious civil war from 1899 to 1902, after the death of Rafael Núñez left no strong leader. Jorge Montt, in Chile, became president after the civil war of 1891 and granted most of the executive power to the Congress. Eloy Alfaro returned to Ecuador from exile in Nicaragua, in 1895, and led a successful revolution against García Moreno. Uruguay was effectively divided into two parts in order to quiet the blanco rebellion under Aparicio Saravia in 1897; and war was necessary again in 1904 to reunite the country under President Batlle. Cuba was fighting for its independence from Spain and then was occupied by United States troops from 1891 to 1902. The Cuban experience, incidentally, was very important in Spanish America's identity problem. When Spain was overwhelmed by the United States in the war for Cuban independence, there was a resurgence of sympathy for the mother country, in spite of old wounds and libertarian inclinations. The United States occupation did nothing to comfort the wary Spanish Americans. They were right in regarding the occupation—and the Platt Amendment, which made Cuba a United States protectorate—as a statement of intent that was followed by a long period of interventions in Latin America. Peace and stability, such as they were, existed in Mexico where the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, pestered by strikes and mumbled dissent, was building up to the biggest explosion of all—the Revolution of 1910; in Peru, where the nation was exhausted from the War of the Pacific; in Bolivia, also exhausted and caught now without a port; in Guatemala, where Estrada Cabrera, one of the worst of Spanish America's dictators, replaced an assassinated president in 1898; and in a few smaller countries, where economic adventurers from the United States were laying the foundations for exploitation. There was certainly plenty of cause for rebellion against the course society was taking. The modernista influence in the novel naturally produces varied effects. The most satisfactory general description is \"poetic,\" though even this word is open to varying interpretations. The novelists sometimes become humorously critical of the movement's hyperaestheticism, and they persist in their desire to shock the reader into thinking that change is possible.4 At times, this anxiety turns into overt cynicism, as in El desarraigado (1907), by Pablo J. Guerrero. The protagonist finds life unworthy of his 8\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) concern. An interesting aspect of the novel is that its setting is Venezuela rather than Paris, the customary setting for intensely sensitive protagonists of this period. A different facet of modernista prose is apparent in La gloria de don Ramiro (1908) by Enrique Larreta. Here the artist moves away from worldly reality by retreating into the past. The novel is a ldnd of love affair with the city of Avila; and Larreta's antiquarian aestheticism does as much to give life to the novel as do the contrasts that form the basis of the action.5 The influence of realism-naturalism is apparent, frequently on a philosophical plane, in the novels of modernismo. In La gloria de don Ramiro, it is apparent in the accuracy of the historical background. Probably the realist-naturalist interest in the New World experience prompted the setting of El desarraigado in Venezuela. Yet all these novels are fundamentally modernista. Reversing this priority and looking at novels that are basically realist-naturalist, with modernista influences, we naturally find greater emphasis on the clinical tone or narrative attitude, but not necessarily a more effective social role for the fictional characters. They corroborate Hernán Vidal's explanation concerning the futility of characters created within both literary tendencies, even though the causes for futility are entirely different. An approximation of the relationship between modernista fiction and realism-naturalism may be suggested through an association of the work of Joris Karl Huysmans with that of Paul Bourget and, in turn, with the work of Emile Zola. Federico Gamboa's Santa (1903) is one of the most widely read novels that can be considered basically naturalist. No doubt some of its public has been attracted by its risqué theme—the rise and fall of a Mexico City prostitute. However, the modernista influences in Gamboa's novel give it a quality—\"dimension\" might even be a suitable word—that attracts readers who would be repelled or bored by Nana, for example. Suggestive associations transcend words. Early in the novel, while Santa waits at the door of the bordello where she intends to work, the sound of children's voices creates a remarkable contrast. Later, the sound of rain turns into Santa's emotional state. This kind of transfiguration is \"dangerous\" for the symbolist personage because the voices and the rain cease to be practical realities for him, and the process gradually separates him 9\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) from the real world. Gamboa's novel does not go that far. The transfigurational development is partial and serves to deepen the reader's experience. Other stylistic factors contribute to the same effect. Gamboa's prose style is visually unattractive. The reader's eye informs him that long sentences and paragraphs could be boring. The actual reading experience proves otherwise, and Seymour Menton's analysis of the style shows why.6 Gamboa makes frequent use of verbs and derivatives of verbs to give motion to his lengthy utterances; repetitions or near repetitions of motifs, words, or families of words have a rhythmic effect; similes and metaphors contribute to the lyric sound of the prose as well as to the meaning. Santa has a very controversial ending. The protagonist is rescued from the gutter by the long-suffering and devoted Hipo, dies of cancer, and is buried in a tranquil country cemetery. True love redeems the fallen woman. Some readers find all this insufficiently deterministic, some think it is overly dramatic, and some accept it as just right. As a matter of fact, the outcome has a structural importance and ought to be read that way. Any sensitive reader must know—or at least sense—from the beginning of the novel that it is not going to be a textbook example of naturalism. The symbolist devices are apparent enough. After the introductory scene, in which the children's voices emphasize the critical point between Santa's past and future, Gamboa shifts to the cause of Santa's plight. The flashback could be a short story and is more purely naturalist than the novel as a whole. It deals with her seduction, miscarriage, and dismissal from the home by her brothers. This episode modifies the contrast established by the children's voices, showing that Santa did not leave home of her own free will. The second point in this fundamental development comes when Santa's grim-faced brothers appear in the middle of café gaiety to inform her of her mother's death. Here again the contrast, and also the information that the presumably idyllic side of the contrast is not real. The death of her mother removes the only comforting factor in Santa's memory. This event coincides roughly with the apex of Santa's career as a prostitute—there is a transition from the distinction of courtesan to the disgrace of whore. The controversial ending is the third step. Santa's miserable condition certainly contrasts with the tranquillity of the cemetery. But 10\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) the fact is that tranquillity was available to her only through death. Redeemed by true love or not, futility marks the life. A clear reaction against this sense of futility is apparent in the novels of Carlos Reyles. They develop and illustrate his belief that the goal of living is the accumulation of power and money—a position that has not endeared him either to his contemporaries or to more recent generations. Gerardo Sáenz, author of the most extensive study of Reyles's work, considers the exposition of this ideology the fundamental goal of the novelist in Raza de Caín (1900) and in the rest of his work.7 Through narrative techniques similar to many novels of realism-naturalism, Raza de Caín tells the story of the domination of a weak idealist by a strong, practical type. Artistic transformation appears to interest Reyles only slightly. The story is designed to inculcate the idea that progress is good, idealism is bad. The purpose apparently was to inspire activity rather than futility in the author's society. Naturalist novels are not intentionally regionalistic. Their real purpose is to deal with human problems rather than political or social ones. However, the inclination to reflect the New World experience often produces interesting regionalistic detail in the realistnaturalist works. Hacienda life in Reyles's novels is an example; an equally rich example—this time of small-town life—is Manuel Gálvez's La maestra normal (1914). This novel probably owes its longevity to the integration of story line with setting, raising a question as to what actually underlies the fictional experience: the plot of seduction, or the slow movement of the provincial town. The life of the town is dull, crawling but inexorable. The novel could be described the same way, and so could the Solís-Raselda story line. Solís seduces the schoolteacher out of boredom. As a fictional personage, he could find a place in any novel influenced by end-of-thecentury ennui and hypersensitivity. It would be possible to describe a line of development of the Solis-Raselda story and give an entirely erroneous impression of the novel. In fact, Solis is caught by the town as much as by the receptive Raselda, and it is only within the setting of the town that the seduction could have any interest. Alegría calls this novel one of the masterpieces of Spanish American costumbrismo.8 His reason is that Manuel Gálvez, instead of simply hanging types against a background of customs and local\n\n11\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) color, develops intricate relationships among the characters, making a world in which the reader can enter rather than simply observe. This differentiation is of some importance to an understanding of the function of the novel in Spanish America, because it is related to the writer's attitude toward reality. In general, the novels oriented toward human problems have more carefully made structures than those that emphasize regionalism. La maestra normal is a kind of bridge between two methods of novelization. To some degree, Grandeza (1910) by Tomás Carrasquilla also strikes a compromise. It has a more intricate structure than many costumbrista works, but interest in the novel depends largely on the quaint types chosen for portrayal. The use of identifiable types either enhances the verisimilitude of fiction or intensifies the illusion of reality. When types are caricatured, the increased sense of reality must be illusion. A second effect of character typing in regionalist fiction is fragmentation of the narrative. Emphasis on types tends to make the narrative structure lineal and episodic. Two steps in this direction are the picaresque El casamiento de Laucha (1906) by Roberto J. Payró and the satirical stories of Argentine society by José S. Alvarez, published in a collection as Cuentos de Fray Mocho in 1906. Local customs, recognizable types, and language peculiarities are the stock-in-trade of the costumbrista novelists. This kind of regionalism is not much concerned with the role of nature. The land may be superficially related to custom or type, but there are no more than faint suggestions of the man-nature conflict and combination that later characterized novels about the New World experience. The writing is influenced to some extent by Flaubertian realism, but Hispanic models like the traditional picaresque novel and the sketches of Mariano José de Larra give a better idea of what these works are like. The reader's experience as he accompanies Laucha's narration is like that of any picaresque novel: the protagonist is a likeable acquaintance whose frame of morality probably differs from the reader's. Therefore, we either suspend our criticism and experience the story intimately, or we read it judicially and unhappily. Orgambide and Yahni, who obviously like this novel, point out two planes of morality and note also that the book is critical of certain social ills of the period, such as quick fortunes made by unscrupulous use of an unregulated stock market, and dishonest politicians.9 The fact 12\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) that the protagonist is a gaucho gives the book a certain regional interest. His jote de vivre is unusual. Life is a party at best, a practical joke at worst. This attitude is what makes the story move. The fact that his marriage is a fake is just part of the joke. Although Laucha is an interesting type, he is not well known in Spanish American literature. Much of the regional identification depends on the language. The language of Carrasquilla, the Colombian regionalist, is probably his most useful instrument, but he is careful to keep it understandable. The same is true for El casamiento de Laucha, where the language becomes important as a unifying device, since the story line is episodic. Alvarez (Fray Mocho), however, swings more freely than either of them. He is not in the least concerned about the unifying factor since his stories (\"vignettes\" might be a better word) were not intended to be published together. They are intended to capture the reality of a time and place, as accurately as possible. The people in his sketches are those one sees every day, and his reports might seem to be dull if it were not for an unconscious transformation of reality, which Orgambide and Yahni have analyzed very cleverly.10 They see the humor primarily in a situation which is announced in the title. The title itself is always in the form of a folk saying, or a pseudo folk saying made up by Fray Mocho. The dialogue tells the story, and the language is the soul of the dialogue. The personage, therefore, is actually revealed through the language, and Fray Mocho tries to make the language just exactly as the character would speak it. So, in the process of the story, the language itself actually becomes the source of humor and of reality. There is a similarity here to the role of language in the works of some novelists of the 1960s and 1970s. Fray Mocho's satire may be the sharpest of all the costumbrista writers, but José Rafael Pocaterra's Política feminista (1913) will be a close second.11 The political orientation of his novel makes it a special kind of costumbrismo. Everybody loses to political power, and there is not much hope for change. The author develops the idea through the use of familiar techniques that reveal his disgust. At the same time, he amuses the reader with his semidetached bitterness. Characterization by Pocaterra is really caricature, because his technique is to emphasize a single detail. He is by no means objec13\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) tive, and his feeling of superiority produces a sarcastic tone. The effect almost amounts to a tradition in Spanish American literature. There is never any question that the novelist is the narrator. He creates his people, puts them on display, comments on their follies and peculiarities. The feeling he creates for the character is sympathetic, but patronizing; the reader has a choice of identifying with the character or of joining the author in his sarcasm. Pocaterra maintains the same attitude in his descriptions of situations, showing his impatience with the world he lives in. The setting of the novel is a provincial town, and \"The Great Venezuelan Railroad station— because in Venezuela, among other great things, we have a railroad—was full of people\" (p. 18). Given the political situation in Venezuela early in the twentieth century, it is hardly surprising that fiction was used as a vehicle of protest. El Cabito (1909), by Pío Gil, is a denunciation of the government of Cipriano Castro. In an extensive essay on the novel, Guillermo Meneses points out that the Castro regime is not always considered as bad as Pío Gil makes it appear.12 The same may be said for most denunciatory literature. However, that judgment refers to the work's value as a document, rather than to its merit as an experience. In the latter connection, Meneses points out that the narrative wavers between emphasis on individuals and emphasis on groups. Readers necessarily will appreciate the direction of his attack—the political opportunists who stand between the president and the people. However, the characteristics of individuals do not always contribute to this focus, and the end of the novel produces a dishonored heroine dying in a convent and a hero who misses his opportunity to kill the tyrant. This finale is a combination of the sense of futility observed in many novels of the period and the remains of romantic overstatement. It is an interesting corroboration— in a clearly nonartistic novel—of the protest found in several Venezuelan modernista novels. A more searching appreciation of social disruption appears in A la costa (1904), by Luis A. Martínez. The organization of action and ideas in this novel has two essential aspects. One is the personal trajectory of Salvador Ramírez, a young man caught up in the conservative struggle against the Eloy Alfaro revolution; the other is the contrast between Salvador and his friend Luciano Pérez, a revolutionary and a liberal in the nineteenth-century sense—that is, a 14\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) defender of the rights of the provinces against the encroachment of centralized power. Salvador's movement from the highlands to the coast gives the novel an underlying dynamism that contributes to the sense of loss of a traditional situation. The destruction caused by an earthquake foreshadows the changing circumstance which is personified in Salvador. In the aftermath of this natural disaster, the narrator's words associate decay with violence, in order to communicate the protagonist's state of mind. Enrique Gil Gilbert, in an excellent study of the novel, notes that this feeling contrasts with Martinez's description of the overwhelming fecundity of the coastal region.13 He also points out that Salvador, having traveled from one environment to the other, achieves happiness and dies almost immediately thereafter. There is something abortive about this development that may indeed leave the reader with a taste of pessimism. On the other hand, Salvador's movement from one zone to the other suggests the totality of Ecuador. The feeling of unity tends to make a contrast opposed to the division of the novel into two parts, and the reader's experience in this case is ambivalent—a paradoxical combination of wholeness and division. This ambivalence is an almost inescapable reaction to civil war, and it is Martinez's best communication. In addition, he allows Salvador to explain his ideas in expository discourses that bear a very faint resemblance to interior monologue. They do not work very well, because they do not sound like words a person might say, but rather like a contemplative essay. If there is any other message of importance in this novel, it is the suggestion, noted by Gil Gilbert, of man overwhelmed by nature, a theme of fundamental importance in communication of the New World experience. Awareness of this experience deepened gradually. Basically, literary expression of the New World phenomenon takes into account the most obvious factors that distinguish it from the familiar European environment—for example, the strange flora and fauna, or coexistence with a non-European people. Toward the middle of the century, writers also show an appreciation of more subtle differences —for example, the amazing range of civilization, from savagery to cosmopolitanism, within a small area. The development of the novel in Spanish America is based on the accommodation of technique to material and vice versa. It is very likely that a sense of the uniqueness of the material tended to modify the literary influences from Eu15\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) rope. On the other hand, Spanish American writers were bound to tradition closely enough to make them respect the general lines. The heritage on which they have based the novel during the twentieth century amounts to a combination of modernismo, realism, naturalism, and an ever persistent romanticism—all these terms understood as referring to tendencies, rather than as restrictive schools. The question of whether there were any notable changes in the novel during these first fifteen years of the century is rather like asking when the century begins. Superficially, the question may sound frivolous; actually it is of great importance, because our customary use of centuries as units of history is simply a convenient approximation, like the names of literary movements or schools. Beyond the reference to the century as a unit, most people look for a point in time when some general direction or attitude changes. A Chilean critic has said that for his country the twentieth century began in 1925 when church and state were finally separated. He notes that the orientation of the society and of the novel changed around that time.14 There is little doubt that for Mexico the crucial date is 1910, the year that marks the beginning of the revolution and the end of the Díaz regime. In Argentina, a possible choice might be 1916, when the Radical party succeeded in electing Hipólito Irigoyen president. Cuba's independence almost coincides with the century, but some might pick 1934 (the abrogation of the Píatt Amendment) as the crucial year. In Uruguay, a new era might date from the beginning of Batlle's second term, after his trip to Switzerland where he studied the social structure; or it might date from 1917 when the country adopted a new constitution that provided for a commission-type government. Although it would be impossible to pick a single date for all of Spanish America and propose that our century begins then, it does seem safe to say that the early part of the century saw a number of attempts to improve on various nineteenth-century circumstances. Changes in the novel are similarly elusive, and the most striking change coincides with the most basic social movement, the Mexican Revolution. Outside Mexico—specifically and somewhat surprisingly in Chile, where traditionalism in prose fiction has been a persistent characteristic—two writers produced novels that subtly suggest change in the function of the genre. One of them, Pedro Prado's La reina de Rapa 16\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) Nui (1914), uses a theme that provokes an examination of generally held values. The other, Eduardo Barrios's El niño que enloqueció de amor (1915), is interesting because of the consistency of its narrative point of view, which is the diary of a ten-year-old boy. The title of Prado's novel means \"The Queen of Easter Island.\" The narrative is in the form of a journalist's diary and consists of episodes about people who belong to an ancient civilization. The totally fictional situation allows the author to invert commonly held beliefs or change the perspective in which we see social reality. A natural problem, the shortage of water, destroys the civilization, and Prado's invention remains inviolate. The author's respect for his right to invent is as important as any of his unusual ways of seeing reality. The diary form is also interesting, but is not as important as in El niño que enloqueció de amor. Barrios turns the story over to the diarist except for the frame, which is the work of the novelist who finds the diary. This technique is of considerable importance because earlier novelists found it very difficult to surrender the narrative voice, even when the third-person omniscient was obviously inadequate. There may be some room for debate about the psychological validity of what Barrios's ten-year-old protagonist does and says, but the book is consistently written within the limits of the presumed characterization. The sharpest turn from traditional ways of making fiction is Andrés Pérez, maderista (1911), by Mariano Azuela.15 Several earlier novels by the same author are safely within the realist-naturalist tradition. Some of the themes show dissatisfaction with the state of society, but there is nothing unusual about the means Azuela uses to communicate. Andrés Pérez, maderista is an entirely different matter. The anecdotal base concerns a man who becomes involved accidentally in the Madero phase of the Revolution, and who with growing cynicism exploits the opportunity. Azuela makes the point by creating an idealist, Toño Reyes, who emphasizes the opportunism of Pérez. The author turns the narration over to Pérez and lets his antihero tell his own disgrace. The fact that he tells the story himself adds insensitivity to opportunism. The author does not leave Andrés standing alone, however. The negative message comes through in a different way. The novel introduces a considerable variety of people who are willing to come to the feast even though 17\n\nThe Heritage (1900-1915) they had nothing to do with its preparation. The emphasis, therefore, in the contrast between Andrés and Toño, has to be on Toño, whose idealism is unique and destined for defeat. Putting aside the old custom of long descriptions, Azuela emphasizes dialogue as a means of moving the plot and making characterizations. The story moves fast and is, in fact, short. Speaking of Azuela's persistent war against the opportunists, Luis Leal quotes the author regarding Andrés Pérez, maderista: \"I wanted to condemn, in less than a hundred pages, an aspect of the Madero movement whose rapid triumph was the major cause of its downfall, because it did not have the time to mature in the consciousness of the people.\"16 The statement is interesting for the opinion expressed; it is even more interesting because it suggests that there was in the mind of the author a relationship between the length of the work and the time factor in the anecdotal matter. This concept of fiction and the techniques used in Andrés Pérez, maderista appear again, and under more complete control, in his masterpiece, Los de abajo.\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916)\n\nMariano Azuela conceived and wrote Los de abajo during, and immediately following, one of the decisive stages of the Mexican Revolution. He was a medical officer attached to the forces of General Francisco (Pancho) Villa. From about the middle of 1914, what had started as a revolution turned into a civil war, with Villa and Venustiano Carranza as the principal leaders. Although Villa seemed more powerful for a while, Carranza gained the upper hand by the end of the year; 1915 was a long period of withdrawal to the northern part of Mexico by the villista forces. By October, Azuela was in El Paso with two-thirds of the novel written. He wrote the rest of it in the office of El Paso del Norte, the newspaper that first published the book.1 It appeared serially from October to December, then as a book in 1916. One of the outstanding characteristics of Los de abajo is the author's ability to transform experience and observation into fiction in an on-the-spot situation. Other novels of the Revolution, although written years later, are less successful in transforming anecdotal base into artistic narrative. In fact, Azuela's rapid assimilation of the circumstances placed him so far ahead of his time that Los de abajo 19\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) came into its own after a decade had passed. The novel was \"discovered\" in 1925, and rapidly gained international recognition. The year of Los de abajo could be 1915 or 1916 or 1925. The choice of 1916 shows some interesting comparisons and contrasts with other Spanish American novels published the same year. Los de abajo is one of the most-written-about books in the history of Spanish American letters. If a devoted investigator cared to search long enough, he could find practically anything said about the novel. Analyses conflict with each other, and changing principles of literary criticism shift the focus of interest as time passes. Torres Rioseco says the book is an epic poem in prose, but does not pursue the point. Alegría says it is an antiepic. Leal says the structure is original, not influenced by any foreign novel. Menton says the structure is epic and explains this description in an analysis of the novel.2 Prominent in discussions of the book is the question of what the author thought about the Revolution. The result is often more biographical than literary, but it does underline the fact that, whatever else Los de abajo may be, it is involved with the human condition in a particular situation. These opinions regarding structure and epic character indicate that something about the book goes beyond the local scene, that there is a heroic element, and that the structure communicates some kind of knowledge that cannot be stated in a summary of the novelist's ideas extracted from the work. Demetrio Macias, the protagonist, dies in a losing battle at the precise scene of his first triumph as a revolutionary leader. To that extent, at least, Los de abajo is circular. Hardly anyone would care to argue the point. This awareness, however, becomes a part of the reader's experience gradually, and it is not complete until the end of the novel. Meanwhile, other factors also follow a circular course and combine with the sense of movement necessary to the creation of a circle, which is indeed important in the understanding of revolutionary activity. The opening episode of Los de abajo deals with Macías's flight from home and organization of a band of revolutionaries. Federal soldiers invade his house and then burn it. Azuela reveals his basic narrative techniques from the beginning. The novel opens with a person speaking, in the middle of an episode that becomes clear gradually. The clauses tend to be short and create an effect of sim20\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) plicity and tenseness. As Macias goes up the mountain, Azuela allows himself a typically brief descriptive passage—imagery that says more than objective awareness, but used with severe restraint. He accomplishes character portrayal with just a few observations. The procedure is much like caricature, but with the important exception that Azuela does not exploit a characteristic to the point of making it absurd. Just as a few words make a personage emerge clearly, so later on a few more words can add to the characterization. Demetrio Macias is ingenuous, strong, patient, independent. Azuela invites the reader's outrage over the invasion of the man's home. There is no sense here of the semislave living in subhuman circumstances. He is a humble man, certainly. His reaction, however, is not that of a wretch who finally reacts against a lifetime of misery, but rather of a man whose rights have been disregarded in a particular situation. This point of departure, for those interested in the author's ideology, speaks eloquently with regard to his view of society. For the reader who is interested only in the experience of the Revolution through the novel itself, it means that his original sympathy is for a man who commands respect as an individual, not for an anonymous mass. However tempting it may be at times to say that the Revolution itself is the real protagonist of Los de abajo, the fact is that the reader's sympathy toward Macias is basic from the start of the novel, and concern for him is active throughout the book. From this point—that is, beginning with the picture of Demetrio Macias climbing up the side of the mountain—the novel is in motion, the protagonist's power grows, and the circle begins to form. Motion is physical movement from one place to another, and it has a corollary spiritual effect of liberation. Together, these phenomena are the very essence of revolution, in the sense that revolution is the opposite of a static condition created by a repressive society. The sense of movement comes via Azuela's quick, clear statements, by his leaving pieces of action unresolved as the narrative jumps to some other situation, through objective observation of the pleasure the soldiers take in simply roaming about the country, and, of course, by gradual appreciation of the circular movement of the book's structure. Still early in the novel, Azuela introduces Luis Cervantes, a city slicker who teaches Demetrio that the Revolution is more than a local protest. Cervantes turns out to be an opportunist, a characteri21\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) zation similar to Andrés Pérez in an earlier novel. Another character introduced later, Solís, is to a considerable extent the opposite of Cervantes. The Cervantes-Solís contrast is similar to the Andrés Pérez-Toño Reyes contrast in Andrés Pérez, maderista, but in Los de abajo the pairing is not as important to the structure. The importance of Solís is more contemplative than functional. The presence of Cervantes is needed to bring about the change in Macias and stimulate the circular movement. The first effect is to indicate that Macias and his men don't have the slightest idea what they are fighting for. Then, in a kind of double-take reaction, we realize that revolutionary ideology is of the least importance. Revolution is movement; ideas are secondary. Indeed, the men of ideas have little or no revolutionary effect in Azuela's novel. Encouraged by Cervantes, Demetrio acquires more power and more followers, but loses the human touch. The subtitle of this novel is \"Scenes of the Revolution,\" and it indicates what the author was probably thinking when he wrote the episodes. Effects like the sense of movement caused by absence of detailed transitions arise from the set of circumstances in which the artist works, rather than from his plan. Azuela might well have said \"Scenes and Portraits of the Revolution,\" because he introduces a wide variety of people. Like the scenes, the people are based on experience and observation. Apparently, he took a few of the minor characters completely from real life, even keeping their nicknames. Others are composites of two or more people.3 The variety serves to give a broad personality base to the revolutionaries. The gamut of human emotions parallels a long series of reasons for participating in the Revolution. The procedure communicates a sense of general unrest, but it does not create the feeling of a faceless mass of people united in a common cause. As the Revolution expands, Demetrio Macias loses his keen awareness of relationship to all his men. Then as villista fortunes decline, his forces become fewer and fewer. Once when a subordinate reported to him that his men were killing each other in a brawl, his unemotional retort was to order them buried. But back in the ravine where it all began, now with fortunes reversed, Demetrio sees his men falling one by one, and he thinks of them separately and by name. The circle—if it really is a circle—is complete in more than 22\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) the geographical sense. The reborn feeling of proximity to his men is a psychological or spiritual return. He has been a general and now is once again undistinguished by rank. This, also, is a return. If all these factors that contribute to the feeling of the circle did in fact close, then the movement of making a circle would not be revolutionary at all. But that is not really the experience of the novel. There is a point in the story when Demetrio goes home to visit his wife and child. He could elect to stay; but, in this much commented on scene, he tosses a stone and lets it roll down the side of the mountain. And he explains that he has become like the stone, caught up in the movement of the Revolution. Maybe this inexorable, primordial movement comes to a standstill when the circle closes there at the end of the second battle of the ravine. In the last sentence of the novel, Azuela says, \". . . Demetrio Macias, his eyes fixed forever, keeps aiming his rifle . . .\" (The second suspension points are the novelist's.) Our first reaction is that Azuela has found a poetic way of saying that Demetrio is dead. Then we wonder, without denying the positive reality of that statement, whether there is another level of understanding, which informs us that the circle doesn't close, but makes a spiral. No matter how often we return to what seems to be a past condition, it turns out never to be exactly the same. Reference to more than one way of understanding Los de abajo does not mean that Azuela's disenchantment with the Revolution was unreal or unreasonable. His involvement dates back to the last years of the Díaz regime when he became a supporter of Francisco I. Madero. The novelist's political ideas, like Madero's, were not very startling. They called for political reform—democratic institutions, civil justice, a fair economic opportunity—rather than profound social reform. The Madero revolt triumphed in the middle of 1911, and Azuela was given a political appointment in Lagos de Moreno. Madero's government was riddled with hangers-on from the old order, and it soon fell. Reactionaries and foreign interests brought about the assassination of Madero early in 1913 and Victoriano Huerta was made president. Villa, Carranza, and Emiliano Zapata continued the Revolution. With a change in United States recognition policy, the Huerta government fell in July 1914. At that point, the Revolution turned into civil war between Villa and Car-\n\n23\n\nThe Year of Los de abafo (1916) ranza. A Villa-Zapata alliance gained strength very briefly, but the alliance did not hold. Azuela served the villista cause in both civil and military-medical positions. The revolutionary movement culminated in the new constitution of 1917. Throughout its course, the Revolution had placed increasing emphasis on social reform. In other words, it had both bourgeois and proletarian aspects, with corresponding emphasis on political and social change. Although Azuela spent much of his time in the service of the poor, he never favored proletarianism in politics. He was disillusioned by the general course of political developments, and even more by the behavior of men. His bitterness is apparent in Los de abajo. However, it does transcend documentary-type exposition because Azuela discovered, probably without knowing it, the proper medium for the material. The matching of movement in the novel's structure with the primordial movement of revolution is the basic cause of the novel's surpassing its initial and most accessible meaning. However, behind this cause is the author himself, who was willing to depart from traditional procedures in order to accomplish something new. An Uruguayan novel of the same year, El terruño by Carlos Reyles, also has much to say about internal upheaval. There is even a hint of the inexorable movement of revolution. However, Reyles's narrative techniques—unlike Azuela's—are all within the naturalist manner that is now referred to as \"traditional.\" Its structural base is the characterization of Doña Angela, known also as Mamagela, the owner of a pulpería. She represents Reyles's ideal of the realistic, hardworking opposite of the dreamy intellectual. We appreciate her character through third-person omniscient narration—a point of view entirely in accord with the narrator's eagerness to coordinate several facets of the novel. In addition to the practical-idealistic contrast exemplified in Mamagela and several other characters, El terruño also contains a story of adultery and the author's arguments in favor of sheep raising for the good of the agricultural economy. This campaign, of course, underscores the plea for common sense as seen through characterization. A feud between brothers, in the first part of the novel, foreshadows the fratricidal war that dominates the second part. We assume, because of the novel's stereotyped idealist, that intellectuals 24\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) will not solve the nation's problems. However, revolutionary activity is also of questionable value. Many people join the rebellion for reasons that have nothing to do with ideas—it promises a degree of freedom, irresponsibility, and food. This motivation recalls Los de abajo and the Mexican revolutionaries' appreciation of wandering about the countryside. The sense of movement never develops beyond a hint. Therefore, it remains in the background of our experience, particularly because Reyles uses lyric repetition to emphasize moments of important emotional response.4 This stylistic device is not used with reference to the movement of revolutionary action. The dynamism of El terruño is produced by the build-up of tension in the first part, followed by its release in the second. Mamagela's practical good sense, which Reyles probably would have liked to be the dynamic factor, often finds expression in static exposition. This common sense provides an optimistic ending for the novel, but experience within the work informs us that words are very fragile. Shifting the scene to Argentina, Benito Lynch's Los caranchos de La Florida touches on problems of the rural economy because one of the protagonists has studied agronomy in Germany. However, Lynch decided to base his story on a tragedy caused by the violent tempers of Don Francisco (Pancho) Suárez Orono and his son, Panchito. The complications resulting from their personalities constitute a spinal column rather than a base for the novel. Nothing very complicated happens between the time the conflict is established, early in the novel, and the tragedy right at the end. Along the way, Lynch supplies a number of good pictures of gaucho life and a considerable comprehension of social attitudes. These factors take their place along the line of continuity maintained by the very slight plot. Lynch first establishes the character of Don Pancho, the father, by commenting on how men have trembled in his presence. Then he provides a kind of prologue, a condensed history, of Don Pancho and the estancia named \"La Florida.\" This part of the novel is not a flashback in the usual sense, because the author's purpose is to give as much information as possible in very little space. Artistic creativity is not a consideration. Real novelization begins when Don Panchito returns from Germany. Given the setting of the novel, we might reasonably expect a conflict between rural common sense and 25\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) book learning, or between traditional ideas and urban enlightenment. But there is no such contrast. The elder Pancho is a man of some sophistication, though he freely discards any of its aspects that stand in the way of his enormous ego. As for the effect Europe has had on young Panchito, the father wavers between wondering how six years abroad could have changed the boy so little and, on the other hand, berating him for shaving off his moustache in order to be fashionable. The tragedy of the novel is caused by the greatest similarity between the two men: their foul temperaments. Lynch narrates in the omniscient third person. Since the characters of the two men are so important to his story, some deviation from this point of view could have been very helpful. And as a matter of fact, there is one part of the novel—Panchito is taking account of his relationship with his father—when the narrative comes close to being interior monologue.5 The change is probably instinctive rather than intentional, because Lynch did not use it in other places where it would have served well. His prose style, although it does not make use of brilliant effects, is useful to the communication of the narrative. Occasionally, he makes the reader focus on a person or an object by repeating the object of emphasis in a following phrase. Apparently he does this when he wishes to communicate a feeling of warmth for what he is talking about. He uses dialogue extensively, and his use of gaucho speech is a major technique of characterization. In general, it has a natural, authentic ring, and he uses it consistently and unobtrusively. That is, he does not call attention to what he is doing. Torres Rioseco points out that the speech of the gaucho in Lynch's novel reveals either low intelligence or limited opportunity to cultivate his natural advantages.6 His very limited expression is entirely consistent with a servile attitude that comes as no surprise in view of the fact that, if he says the wrong thing, either of the two masters of La Florida is likely to belt him in the mouth with a riding crop. The amazing thing is that the gauchos do not hit back. They only predict that such violence will lead to no good. Father and son are named caranchos about one-quarter of the way through the novel, by the half-crazy gaucho who foresees disaster (p. 47). A carancho combines the characteristics of eagle and vulture.7 While the description is accurate enough for this father-son combination, Lynch does not emphasize the theme. The conflict between the two men 26\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) develops over their interest in the same girl, who is by age better suited to Panchito. In the violent end, son murders father and is murdered in turn by the overseer of the estancia. Two very important conditions define the nature of Panchito's crime. First, on the night of his arrival from Germany, Panchito's father forbids him, under any circumstances, to go to a certain part of the estancia. The young man reacts understandably to what amounts to a dare, but he does not disobey. When he does go there, it is because he is lost in a storm. There he finds Marcelina, the woman in the case. Second, Panchito is quite a hand with his pistol. Repeated reference to it makes the reader expect him to commit murder. However, when he kills Don Pancho, he does so with a wrench he happens to have with him at the moment. The initial step toward disaster is pure chance; the murder itself is clearly not premeditated, but is caused by the passion of a moment. Lynch does not suggest that the violence of his protagonists has any relationship to the environment. It appears to be hereditary and susceptible to aggravation by practically anyone or any circumstance. Between the establishment of the plot line and the final disaster, Los caranchos de La Florida levels off into a series of episodes of about equal intensity. The only development in the story line is Panchito's progress in finding out the exact nature of his father's relationship with Marcelina. Throughout these episodes, Lynch makes word portraits of a variety of gaucho types, of the country schoolteacher, and particularly of Panchito's cousin, Eduardo. He is particularly important because of the role he plays in the revelation of class consciousness. As Don Pancho sees them, the gauchos are subhuman: halfsavage, dirty, immoral, and stupid. He insists that they recognize his superiority. Panchito may be slightly more enlightened, but only to the extent that he is less consistently cruel. Like his father, he maintains a general policy of aloofness. Eduardo, on the other hand, fraternizes with the gauchos and enjoys a more relaxed though less respectable life. His relatives do see him, but they deplore his disgrace. An appreciation of this class system develops naturally as Panchito goes from place to place. It is the most interesting aspect of the book. The basic plot is so slight we hardly notice its movement in a large part of the novel. The reader tends to look for plot de27\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) velopment and, in the process, becomes involved in the apparently incidental communication of social attitudes. The problem of the unappreciated artist seems far removed from the ways of life novelized in these three works. The publication of Manuel Gálvez's El mal metafísico in the same year calls attention to the great disparity between society in rural Spanish America and in the great urban centers. It is the story of a poet, Carlos Riga, in Buenos Aires during the early years of the twentieth century. Gálvez's sympathetic treatment of the dreamer by means of realist narrative techniques produces a contrast very similar to the contrast one recognizes in the confused literary scene at the turn of the century and for a decade or more beyond. Orgambide and Yahni say circumstances and personages are taken from real life and are identifiable.8 They regard the book as an important document for Argentine letters. Indeed, it has a similar importance for Spanish American literature in general. And, by even further extension, the novel is important as a portrayal of gradual alienation. The artist's particular attitudes separate him more and more from the ordinary social process. Because Gálvez intended to make his work as a whole a portrayal of Argentine reality, there is every reason to believe that he did place real people in the novel. The discovery of equivalences is fascinating. However, if we put aside the game of identity and deal with the book as pure fiction, we find the author has used a changing narrative tone to give the novel vitality. The story of El mal metafísico is divided into three parts. The function of the division is simple—it provides* for a lapse of four years between the first two parts and a lapse of three years between parts two and three. Involvement of the reader in the life of the novel depends not on an obvious structural pattern, but on the establishment of a particular tone right at the beginning. Gálvez is gently ironic. Carlos Riga, a law student aged twenty, is waiting for friends to arrive at a café where he is to read them one of his poems. \"Every night he used to meet some of his colleagues in literature and illusions at a coffeehouse, and there, carefully nursing the inspirational coffee, they would spend long hours defining Life, organizing Society, cursing the hateful Philistines who ignored them, and deceiving poverty and the thirst for glory with vague, easy dreams.\"9 The narrator's tone is partly critical, partly nostalgic. And 28\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) even if the past might have been a bit pretentious, it was important and understandable. In an immediate flashback, Gálvez deals with Riga's family, then he goes to the pensión where the poet lives, and from there into his literary life. The tone of gentle irony pervades all this introduction. Then on page forty-five, one of the young men defines the \"metaphysical illness,\" saying it is the sickness of creating, of dreaming, of thinking. The tone has shifted. This is a serious matter. Gálvez's reader discovers a sense of frustration increasing at the expense of pleasant nostalgia. The tone of gentle irony still appears from time to time, but unhappiness becomes dominant. This change gives the book vitality. It also gives it meaning for any age, because Gálvez deals with the dark tragedy that is another facet of when-we-wereyoung-and-foolish. The first part of the novel has to do with Riga's first literary steps. One of the most perceptive episodes shows that his trouble with his father is of two kinds. First, the elder Riga thinks Carlos's literary pursuits are a waste of time. Later, having been persuaded by an old-fashioned writer that literature may even help an attorney's career, the father objects to Carlos's modernista efforts. Gálvez builds on the latter conflict to make a point of society's reluctance to accept innovation in the arts. Each characterization, major or minor, relates one way or another to the acceptance or rejection of the artist. The triumph of the first part is publication of the first number of a new cultural magazine, which is supposed to revitalize the country. Part two carries Riga into greater difficulties. He has trouble scratching out a living. And his literary work is appreciated only by a few. Part three is about alcoholism, loneliness, sickness, and death. The novel has some of the romantic qualities often associated with bohemianism, but there is no melodrama unless it is created by the discomfort of particular readers. The calmness of Gálvez's prose lends dignity to situations that might have been ruined by overstatement. Modernismo's exquisite sensitivity, while a subject for Gálvez's irony, was still cultivated when he was writing his novel. El hombre que parecía un caballo, by Rafael Arévalo Martínez, is an excellent example of symbolist transformation. This short novel, or long story, is the expression of a human relationship. The narrator is pleased, 29\n\nThe Year of Los de abajo (1916) and later disillusioned, by his friend. The positive aspect of the relationship is expressed in terms of jewels; but even these become more brilliant than substantive. The negative aspect is expressed by association of the friend's movements and mannerisms with those of a horse. While this imagery contains an element of bestiality, there is also an element of graceful beauty. Therefore, the presumed positive and negative factors are not absolute. Each contains elements of the other. It has long been taken for granted by most people that the friend in the story, Señor Aretal, is a fictionalization of the Colombian poet Porfirio Barba Jacob—otherwise known as Ricardo Arenales and Miguel Angel Osorio. The accuracy of this assumption makes no difference to the story. Recently, Daniel R. Reedy has explained that the author is talking about two aspects of himself.10 The argument relies heavily on the ideas of Carl Gustav Jung. Without going into the pros and cons of the new interpretation, it is worth noting that it retains the essential communication of the traditional reading: an appreciation of the contrast between the fine and the gross. Apparently, the reader's experience depends on the author's shift of balance within the two systems of imagery. In spite of this tour de force, what one remembers of El hombre que parecía un caballo is more likely to be the clever descriptions of the man-horse. The associations are amusing and invite the reader to look for personanimal similarities in his own world. These effects—both the serious and the frivolous—make the story seem more innovative than it really is. Its freshness is the product of Arévalo Martinez's personal way of seeing things. Technically, it was old-fashioned in 1916.\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER\n\n3\n\nFrom Los de abajo to Don Segundo Sombra (1917-1925)\n\nThe novelists became more and more aware of their immediate surroundings, and this growing regionalism found its place in conjunction with themes inherited from the turn of the century, rather than in opposition to them. The hypersensitive, dreamy protagonist was still a major interest, but by this time he often found himself in circumstances far different from the Parisian settings of earlier years. In fact, regional awareness discovered a possible cure for his condition in the milk-and-honey beneficence of the simple life. In turn, this idealization of rural life indicates that the protagonist's troubles come from city life in general, rather than from Paris specifically. The characteristics of the hero himself become less restrictive. He is not necessarily the bored aesthete whose symbolist transformations alienate him from real life. He may be alienated because he is an intellectual—as is Tocles, in El terruño. He may be simply the ingenuous, pampered son of a wealthy family; and, of course, this condition makes a very credible combination with the idea of the bored aesthete.\n\nFrom Los de abajo to Don Segundo Sombra (1917-1925) The transfer to the country doesn't always work the cure. It may be only temporary—Mariano Latorre's Zurzulita (1920) is an example. There are also times when the curative agent is not the country itself, but a rural woman overflowing with good health. Eduardo Barrios's Un perdido (1917) is such a case; and Joaquín Edwards Bello persistently reveals his fondness for the \"woman of the people.'' To avoid any possible misunderstanding, it should be clear that these novelists were not members of the proletariat, nor were they proposing to let down class barriers. Their view of the robust and cheerful woman of the people is similar to their view of prize livestock. This view is hardly an enlightened one, but it is a step ahead of not seeing the common people at all. The so-called popular classes were also apparent in the cities where a novel of protest started developing. Dissatisfaction with the state of society is apparent in a large percentage of novels. It is implicit, of course, in the novels where the protagonist tries to grasp reality more firmly by seeking a different milieu. However, it is far more apparent in novels that deal with urban society, by Azuela, Gálvez, Edwards Bello, and Carlos Loveira, and in stories by Elias Castelnuovo. Again in a rural setting, the feeling of discomfort focuses on the plight of the Bolivian Indian in Alcides Arguedas's Raza de bronce (1919). None of these books amounts to a crusade. Rather, they acknowledge the existence and problems of people who are not members of the oligarchy. Their cautious investigation—examining, but not daring to make any fundamental changes—is entirely in accord with the political mood of the time. It is hardly necessary to say that political circumstances were not the same in all the countries of Spanish America. At any given time, the spectrum provided by nearly a score of political entities is likely to show widely divergent extremes. It is often possible, however, to find similarities in several countries—enough to justify some general assumptions provided we expect them to be suggestive rather than definitive. There were, in fact, several political moves that indicate awareness of the need for social improvement, but they tended to fall short of radical change. The Mexican Revolution was the most apparent and the most effective. A new constitution was promulgated in 1917, and through it a considerably larger portion of the population was given a chance at economic improvement. Much of 32\n\nFrom Los de abajo to Don Segundo Sombra (1917-1925) its potential went unrealized because a great deal of the nation's political energy was spent in power struggles. By 1925, a political revolt by Adolfo de la Huerta and a vicious religious controversy emphasized the need for stability rather than programs of social improvement. In Chile, antioligarch sentiment produced the organization of the Communist party in 1920 and the election of Arturo Alessandri in the same year. He was able to bring about the enactment of a progressive labor code, but was unable to secure consistent legislative cooperation. In 1925 he was replaced by a military coup. The Radical party of Argentina succeeded in electing Hipólito Irigoyen in 1916. Unfortunately, he was a personalistic and indecisive administrator. During 1919, he tolerated strikebreaking tactics. Marcelo Τ. Alvear, an aristocrat who was an Irigoyen partisan, became president in 1922. Within three years, however, the two politicians had broken their alliance, and the influence of the Radical party was practically over. The new Uruguayan constitution of 1917 set up a commission-type government and made provisions for labor and social welfare that were similar to those in the Mexican constitution. There were no provisions for land reform. President Batlle had said in 1910 that this problem would be solved effortlessly by the general progress of the country. Ex-President Augusto B. Leguía of Peru seized the presidency in 1919. A new constitution with electoral reforms went into effect in 1920. However, Raúl Haya de la Torre, then a rising young politician, was exiled. He was in Mexico by 1924 when he organized APRA (American Party of Revolutionary Alliance). In several other countries, there were major changes or tragedies important to the social situation, even though they were not related to planned social reform. Petroleum was discovered in the Maracaibo area of Venezuela in 1918. Guatemalans overthrew dictator Manuel Estrada Cabrera in 1920. Costa Rica endured Federico A. Tinoco for only two years, 1917-1919. Ecuador suffered a massacre of strikers in 1922 and a frustrated revolt in 1925. Gerardo Machado was elected president of Cuba in 1925. His administration turned into a repressive dictatorship that eventually produced Fulgencio Batista. The picture of social change runs from armed revolution to nothing at all. It portrays an inadequate awareness of a complicated society, but it also indicates some recognition of a new era. Indica33\n\nFrom Los de abajo to Don Segundo Sombra (1917-1925) tions of a new era in the novel appear in the form of changing thematic interests and also in experimentation with narrative technique. These two lines of innovation cross each other rather than coincide. That is, thematic change may be apparent in a novel that uses well-established techniques. Rómulo Gallegos's protagonist in his first novel, El último Solar (1920), is basically a turn-of-thecentury sensibility type, and his presentation is in the realistic manner. The author expands the thematic material to show, through his hero, a good deal about Venezuela during that time. Torres Rioseco points out that it is a country where dishonesty and opportunism are rampant.1 He also says artistic talent is a liability—a condition apparent in the novels of Manuel Díaz Rodríguez. It is tempting to blame all the troubles on dictatorships, but in all fairness we must note that the problem of the unappreciated artist is as fundamental in Gálvez's El mal metafísico as anywhere else. Indeed, thematic change is apparent in El último Solar precisely because Gallegos uses a traditional theme as his base, then goes beyond that point in response to his specific surroundings. This expansion is the prime characteristic of his novels. It is not so easy to point out cases of static themes developed by experimental techniques. A case might be made for Eduardo Barrios's Un perdido because psychological character analysis acts as an important narrative technique. The difficulty—not just in the case of Barrios's novel, but in a general sense—is that experimental technique actually changes the theme. However traditional the story may be, a new way of telling it makes it a different experience. Ricardo Güiraldes's first novel, Raucho (1917), is an exemplary case. Its autobiographical aspect tends to distract critics from its importance as fiction. There is no reason to doubt its reflection of the author's life. Juan Carlos Ghiano points out that the subtitle, \"Moments from the Life of a Contemporary Youth,\" strongly suggests the relationship of the author to a particular social situation.2 The anecdotal base is the experience of a boy with a natural affinity for estancia life who lives an alienating odyssey through city life and a trip to France, then returns to the estancia and rediscovers his identity. The disoriented protagonist is saved by wholesome rural living, just as in many other novels. Raucho, however, is different from the rest. The principal difference is the structure of the narrative. \"Mo34\n\nFrom Los de abajo to Don Segundo Sombra (1917-1925) ments,\" in the subtitle, is the key. There are nine of them, each one intended to communicate the feeling as well as the fact of a given moment. Even the first one, \"Prólogo,\" is an integral part of the story—a word game that the customary realist-naturalist attitude would not likely permit. Concentration on the nine moments separates Raucho's life from humdrum reality. It is by no means a repetition of what the reader has experienced, and does not intend to be; therefore, it transcends documentary value. In other words, nine moments cannot possibly be a re-creation of real life. They are a distillation of it, as is the case of Güiraldes's novel, or they fail to be anything. This structure is surprisingly similar to that of Los de abajo—a comparison likely to pass unnoticed, since the subjects are so different. Azuela even announces the structure in his subtitle, \"Scenes of the Revolution,\" just as Güiraldes does. The effect is the same, if we take into account the difference between the odyssey of a single life and the movement of social upheaval. That is, Azuela's scenes amount to a distillation of his knowledge of the Revolution, just as Güiraldes's moments are a distillation of Raucho's youth. It is also interesting that the protagonists of both novels make a geographical circle, but each return is sufficiently different from the beginning to suggest a spiral rather than a closed ring. This last coincidence, while interesting to contemplate, is probably unimportant in a consideration of experimental techniques. There is no question of influence in the case of these two books. Their similarity amounts to two authors searching for adequate expression. Azuela found it, probably unconsciously, because his material suggested it. Güiraldes was aware of the search. His work prior to Raucho shows his desire to find some way to transform his feeling toward rural Argentina. In his story of Raucho, Güiraldes reinforces the effect of the structure by using a narrative point of view, which Ghiano describes as grammatically third person, but with the psychological presence of the first person.3 Actually, this narrative position acts as a liaison between the author and the protagonist, with the result that Güiraldes's reader tends to accept this multiple identity. The effect is created by having the presumed third person say things about Raucho which we may take to be Raucho's sentiment. It is this projection of one person into the other which makes the narrative almost first person. What the author accomplishes by all this is a 35\n\nFrom Los de abajo to Don Segundo Sombra (1917-1925) communication of what a certain kind of life (a set of circumstances) means to him. It is a significance discovered via a profound emotional response rather than by observation. Recognition of this attitude on the part of the author will also illuminate his intent in Don Segundo Sombra and should silence discussion about whether the author painted a true picture of gaucho life as compared with, for example, Benito Lynch's El inglés de los güesos (1924). Nothing could be more real than Raucho or Don Segundo Sombra, though neither approaches a one-to-one correspondence with objective awareness. One of the extraordinary characteristics of readers of Spanish American fiction was for many years the willingness to accept as real the highly improbable scientist of Lynch's novel (a combination of caricature and misconception) while considering Güiraldes's creations as somehow separated from reality. They are separated, of course, in the sense that they are transformations rather than documentations. And Güiraldes was not alone. Azuela, after continuing to deal with the Revolution in several works using most of the techniques of Los de abajo, became even more experimental in La Malhora (1923) and El desquite (1925). He intensifies the use of selected moments, adds to the effect by using a style that often seems to select words just as the structure selects incidents. This procedure minimizes the importance of a cause-effect sequence, and Azuela goes even farther, using an antichronological development of the story. He also experiments with interior monologue. The product is not always successful, but these works leave no doubt about the author's vanguardist tendencies. If Azuela had been an influential author at that time, we might consider his work the inspiration of other novels, or even types of novels, that transcend documentary recording by experimenting with techniques. Actually, vanguardist trends in Mexico and the rest of Spanish America come from European influences and from a pervasive sense of a new era. A Mexican phenomenon called the \"colonialist novel\" is particularly interesting because its theme is really determined by the attitude of the author and because communication of the theme depends to such a great extent on the prose style of the narration. It is a highly specialized historical novel cultivated by Artemio de Valle Arizpe and several other young 36\n\nFrom Los de abajo to Don Segundo Sombra (1917-1925) writers who were trying their wings in the postrevolutionary years. The novelists are more antiquarians than historians—they treat the past with possessive regard. Herein lies the theme. It is not simply the historical event or personage that inspires the novel, but the attitude of the author with reference to the historical fact. The theme comes to life through language that becomes precious in its attempt to create the ambience of a past time. To a considerable extent, these works recall Larreta's La gloria de don Ramiro. However, a difference of fundamental importance is that the Mexican writers were reviving the past of their own country, and their works serve as a means of identifying their particular reality. They contain an element of New Worldism that is not present in Larreta's novel.4 By transferring the experience of the novel to the past, the author places the present in a different perspective—for the reader and for himself. Historical fiction, therefore, can be a means of appreciating the present. The effect is different, of course, from the distillation of present reality as in Rancho or Los de abajo, for example, but the motivation of the authors seems rather similar. Still another way of changing perspective is the use of an imaginary situation like Pedro Prado's La reina de Rapa Nui. Like good science fiction, it affords the author opportunity to comment on his particular circumstance. Prado used a different approach, with much the same motivation, in Alsino (1920). Reduced to its minimum, this novel has the fantasy and charm of a story for children. A crippled boy grows wings and flies around the Chilean countryside becoming involved in situations that are quite ordinary until they are changed by his aeronautic capability. Allegorical implications deepen the experience of reading the novel. Association with the Icarus myth is inevitable; and given the boy's condition of being chained by his physical disability, Prado's reader is flooded with multiple implications relating to freedom—the restraints of social order, the problem of individual commitment, and concern for others. To make matters more complicated, Alsino is by no means a poet, or even a standard hypersensitive type; he is a country boy of very humble circumstances. One of the interesting aspects of the novel is Prado's insistence on a deterministic view of his protagonist in preflight stage and of the country people in general. The view is in marked contrast to the sense of freedom and also to certain passages that may be considered slightly excessive in their poetic rapture. The contrast 37\n\nFrom Los de abajo to Don Segundo Sombra (1917-1925) provokes considerations of psychological validity that detract from the more imaginative implications of the novel. Something—or perhaps several different phenomena—called \"psychology\" takes on increasing importance during these years. As applied to some of the novels built around the turn-of-the-century aesthete, the term could well be discarded in favor of \"philosophical.\" At times it seems to mean any kind of searching character delineation. And it also refers to the psychological validity of the novelist's creation. For Eduardo Barrios it was the basis of fiction. Psychological analysis is actually the dynamic factor in some of his novels. On this foundation, he built his studies without great concern for their relationship to society. Rather, he thought in terms of universal human problems and, as is very often the ca"
