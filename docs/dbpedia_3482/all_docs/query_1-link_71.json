At its best the novel explores the inner reality that is the deeper part of existing circumstance, and also the dreams that transcend the visible in a different direction. It is able to probe in both directions without mitigating its own awareness, or the reader's awareness, of visible circumstance. Obviously, not all novels are written with vision so penetrating. But novels ought always to be considered on the basis of their most complete function. Like other forms of art, the novel is a cultural organism with an ideal role, and the way in which that role is fulfilled or neglected offers one way of examining a culture's grasp of reality. The intent of this book is to take account of the Mexican reality that is revealed through the nation's novel. In many respects, of course, this view coincides with the view of the historian, the economist, or the sociologist. But the novel reveals some aspects of reality that would not be apparent to specialists in nonartistic disciplines. We ought to know this fuller truth, because Mexico's unique experience may be enlightening in our consideration of the contemporary dilemma. Mexico is at once a very old country and a very new one. Its roots are deep in the European tradition, and within the present-day interpretation of that tradition there are subtle manifestations of an ancient indigenous culture. Mexico does not deny its history. But, during the present century, the nation has passed through a social revolution that, from the beginning, was a mixture of proletarian and bourgeois impulses. This redefinition of Mexico gave it many characteristics of\n\nχ\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\na new nation. And looking at basically individual characteristics, rather than at basically political ones, we find in Mexico a number of interesting attitudes that speak to the contemporary problem of loneliness, apartness, or lack of communication. In spite of the fact that Northamericans live close to Mexico, and frequently travel below the border, our ignorance of the country is abysmal. Without knowing enough about it to decide whether it is important or not, we regard it as unimportant, so showing our easy inclination toward prejudice in its purest form. Least of all are we concerned with Mexico's cultural life. I recall with frankly nationalistic embarrassment the scores of times I have been faced with an ingenuous \"I never realized that Mexico had novels; of course they must have them; how interesting.\" The fact is that even the Northamericans who visit Mexico rarely search beyond the picturesque superficialities. And I should not wish to treat them too harshly, because it is a rewarding country, even on that very elementary level. Still it seems to me that we ought to be aware of Mexico's aspirations, problems, and vitality—and especially of its long struggle toward the liberty that is self-realization. We are moving toward the estimation of nations on bases other than their military or economic prominence, past or present. It is quite possible that, in this changing world, the role of Mexico may be very important. This book is addressed primarily to Northamericans, particularly to those who are interested in literature in general but know little of my specialization. Naturally, I hope that my fellow specialists in the United States and in Mexico will find the book interesting. While I have included some basic information that will be well known to some readers, the book is by no means a literary primer. I hope it may answer some questions, but raise even more. I have chosen to write a history of the novel, rather than a history of the novelists. The latter can be very interesting, but the novel has a life of its own which deserves to be told without distortion for the sake of dealing with an author all in one place, or for the sake of dealing with a particular theme in one chapter. The basis for the organization of the book was a chronological list of novels written in Mexico. An abridgment of this list is printed at the end of the book so the reader may see for himself some of the unexpected sequences and juxtapo-\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nsitions that are hidden when the novel is discussed author by author or theme by theme. A study of the list, from the standpoint of the novel as the expression of a people, reveals some rather obvious divisions. These divisions became the chapters of the book, and the lines were maintained even if it meant that some novelists would appear in more than one chapter. In a few cases I have broken the chronological order to bring together one or more works of a single author, when that procedure served to clarify the discussion. The story begins with the present period, which is a time of realization, then goes back more than four centuries to the time of the Conquest. From that point the story of the novel is told chronologically throughout the nation's history until the last chapter meets the first. Perhaps I should say that I have avoided any particular critical method, but have allowed each novel to dictate, by its own character, the direction of my comments. Indeed, I have thought less about method than about point of view. Trying always to remember the human character of the novel, I have written of the aspects of each work that contribute to its re-creation of reality, and have tried to search out the farthest limits of reality captured in each book. Several technical matters call for brief explanations. First, footnotes appear only where it was hopelessly awkward to put the necessary information in the text. Second, the Bibliography is highly selective. Specialists who are interested in more bibliographical detail and in biographical data, may find both in the Breve historia de la novela mexicana and in Literatura mexicana contemporánea, which are cited in the Bibliography. Third, titles are translated or explained only when they contribute substantially to my comments. Fourth, translations of excerpts from novels are mine unless otherwise indicated. Fifth, I have used the term\"Northamerican\"to refer to my fellow countrymen. It is not an accurate term, but there is no accurate term that is manageable (I refuse to say \"United-statesian\"), and \"Northamerican\" is the term most commonly used in the Mexican press. By way of confession, I should emphasize that I am a foreigner in my field. In spite of the fact that I know Mexico reasonably well, I am aware that I cannot possibly see Mexico as a Mexican sees it. I regret the errors that have inevitably come from my foreignness, and hope\n\nxii\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nthey may be balanced by the advantage of a certain objectivity. I must also confess a great faith in intuition, and I have not tried to harness it in writing this book. I have given intuition greater validity by writing the book in Mexico and living each day among Mexicans, not observing them from outside, but participating in their cultural life. One of the most rewarding aspects of my work has been the help received from so many people. I wish I could name them, but they are too many. The first investigations were made more than twenty years ago. Many years of learning followed, all of them satisfying. Recent reconsideration of what was learned earlier has been the most satisfying experience of all, and from it came the present essay. Over the years, ideas have come from teachers, colleagues, students. In the past few months, the sympathetic hearing and response given my ideas by many Mexican friends have made the subject more alive than ever before. All these people contributed to what is here, but the version is mine, and mine too is the blame for the errors. John S.

For instance, the\"Revolut i o n \"in the United States means the war of independence, while in Mexico the\"Revolution\"refers to a twentieth-century social upheaval. Since it is necessary, in this book, to make frequent references to the history of the country, a few words about the main currents may be helpful. The most convenient procedure is to consider four major events: The Conquest, The Independence, The Reform, and The Revolution. THE CONQUEST Hernán Cortés landed at Veracruz in 1519, invaded the territory of the Aztec emperor, Moctezuma, reached the capital city, Tenochtitlán (Mexico City), and conquered the Aztecs in 1521. This event amounted to a clash between Spain, then at the height of her power, and an advanced Indian civilization. The Conquest brought Spanish domination, but the Indian was not eliminated. The Colonial Period lasted three hundred years. THE INDEPENDENCE The War of Independence began with the revolt led by Father Miguel Hidalgo, who called his followers to arms on September 16, 1810 (Mexican Independence Day). Some other leaders of the movement in subsequent years were Javier de Mina, Father José María Morelos, and Agustín Iturbide. Independence was finally achieved under the leadership of Iturbide when he entered the capital on September 27, 1821. The ideology behind the Hidalgo revolt was the liberal thought of the period that led to the establishment of many representative governments. However, the political situation in Spain was so uncertain\n\n4\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nthat some conservatives joined the liberals in the fight for Mexican independence. Their victory was the result of a compromise that soon turned into political chaos. The struggle between the liberals and conservatives fed the opportunism of Santa Anna, and was one of the causes of the secession of Texas. Then the nation suffered the Northamerican Invasion (1845-1847), by which the United States took approximately half of Mexico's national territory. THE REFORM Under the leadership of Benito Juárez, a group of dedicated liberals, determined to bring order out of chaos, created the Constitution of 1857. Their political ideology was capitalist-democratic, and their goal was to make Mexico a progressive nation. The conservatives reacted violently for three principal reasons: the Reform attacked the power of the Church, it threatened some personal interests, and it proposed a governmental structure which the conservatives considered too weak. The War of the Reform lasted from 1857 to 1860, and the liberals were victorious. However, Napoleon III saw an opportunity to establish an empire in the New World, and he conspired with Mexican conservatives to place Archduke Maximilian of Austria on the throne of Mexico. The French Intervention began in 1862 when the troops of Napoleon III entered the country. In 1864, Maximilian and his wife, Carlotta, arrived. Threatened by external pressures, Napoleon III withdrew his troops and the liberals were again victorious. Maximilian was captured and shot in 1867. The next several years showed that the noble intent of the Reformists was too advanced for the state of the country. In 1876, Porfirio Díaz, a Reformist general, assumed the Presidency. He served a fouryear term, allowed a political associate to serve the next four years, then returned to the office which he held until 1910. Díaz paid lip service to the principles of the Reform, and quietly allowed the Church to regain power and the bourgeoisie to fatten their purses. The age of Díaz was one of relative stability, foreign investment, overt prosperity, and exploitation of the poor.\n\nA Note on Mexican History\n\n5\n\nTHE REVOLUTION By 1910, there was a great deal of dissatisfaction with the Díaz dictatorship. Some of the thinking was entirely political, but there were also some questions about social justice. The Revolution started late in 1910 under the leadership of Francisco Madero, idealist and martyr. Other names rapidly became prominent: Villa, Orozco, Zapata, Carranza, Obregón. The Revolution was a chaotic struggle that had no apparent unity. Ideologies differed, power struggles created strange alliances. For some, the Revolution was always political, for others it was a social crusade. In 1917 a Revolutionary constitution was promulgated. Based on the Constitution of 1857, its radical provisions were more specific. Then the administrative phase of the Revolution began. From the beginning, the Revolution had been a middle-class movement and a proletarian movement at the same time. Its administrative interpretation has varied, depending on the political position of the leaders during each presidential term.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\n1. TheNovel of Time and Being (1947-1963) Town of women in mourning clothes. Here, there, at night, in the dawn approaching, in the blessed river of morning, under the fiery brilliance of midday, in the afternoon light—strong, clear, gaunt, in extremis— old women, mature women, young maidens, little girls; in the entrances to churches, in the street silence, inside shops and some of the houses— so few—furtively opened. Cloistered town. Shamefaced saloons . . . Town with no pool parlors, or phonographs, or pianos. Town of women in mourning clothes . . . Desire, desires pretend not to breathe. You have to be still a moment to hear their breathing, to know that it exists behind the barred doors, in the trail left by women in mourning clothes, by grave men, by healthy young bucks, by pale little boys. You have to hear it in the ecclesiastical prayers and chants where it takes refuge. Deep breathing, feverish breathing held back . . . Life goes by among the women in mourning clothes. Death comes. Or love. Love, which is the strangest, most extreme form of dying; the most dangerous and frightening way of living one's death.1 The\"Acto Preparatorio\"of Al filo del agua (On the Edge of the Storm )2 is Agustín Yáñez's setting for a novel that discovers the relationship between the outer and inner lives of the people in a small 1\n\nAgustín Yáñez, Al filo del agua, 2nd ed. (Mexico City: Porrúa, 1955), pp. 3,5,14. 2 Yáñez explains that the title of his novel is a rural expression which refers to the moment just before the rain begins. It can also mean to be on the brink of any event.\n\n8\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nMexican town. It is more than a mood setting, because Yáñez prepares the reader to know and to see the town and the individuals who live in it. It is an introduction which looks forward and backward, up and down, as does the book. The characters emerge from the preparatory act, identify themselves with their severely circumscribed world, then transcend the limits of visible reality and move into the reality of all men, enlarging at the same time their own objective experience. Al filo del agua was published in 1947, three decades after the promulgation of the Revolutionary constitution. It is an historical novel in the best sense, because it re-creates the reality of Mexico on the edge of the Revolution, during the fading moments of the\"peace and order\"of the age of Porfirio Díaz. Yet it is not an historical novel that moves the reader back into a past that he wishes to get to know or to relive. In this novel, the past is the present, for two reasons. One is that the Revolution did not completely change the circumstances that are apparent in the novel. The condition of being on the edge of the storm is not entirely different from being in the midst of the storm, or even after the storm. The second reason is that, in the case of the Revolution, awareness followed reality. The significance of the Revolution was not easily understood at first. What must have appeared to be a series of rebellions gradually acquired an element of unity. And later, men were so impressed by the movement of the Revolution— movement that was physical, social, spiritual, and to a lesser extent intellectual—that they responded only with movement in one form or another. In the case of prose fiction, the movement was generally expressed in a lineal account of the action of the Revolution. Sometimes the line formed a pattern, but more often it kept moving on the same plane, as if the author were seeking to take account of what had happened. It would be unfair to say that Al filo del agua changed the direction of the novel. But it does mark a turning point, embodies the characteristics of a new direction. It incorporates and surpasses the anecdote, the costumbrismo,3 the social protest, the studied artistry that are present in earlier novels, though hardly ever in combination. And 3\n\nThis is a term used in Hispanic literature to refer to the novel of customs and similar prose.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n9\n\nit accomplishes a degree of interiorization seen only rarely in earlier Mexican prose. The book itself is indeed\" a l filo del agua\" literarily. And it is in a similar position as an expression of the Mexican nation because it transposes the reality of the moment of its setting, historically past, to the reality of the present, the moment of awareness. It also transposes another reality—a literary one— from past to present, for it is the blossoming of the intent of the Contemporáneos group in the late 1920's and early 1930's, an intent that had to wait until awareness became a fact. It is typical of Yáñez's way of expressing himself that the titles of his novel and of his introduction involve the reader in speculation beyond the minimal understanding of what the author says. In all his works, Yáñez uses his mastery of prose, names of characters, sequence of events, proverbs, place names, and association of ideas to propel his reader into creative participation. A fair appraisal of Yáñez calls for the use of the word\"propel,\"for it is important to understand that Yáñez does not drag a hand-clutching reader behind him. Sometimes it appears that he is making an allegory; and in a sense, that is what he is doing, but the allegory is not carried to completion or resolution. His intimations are to allegory as thought is to systematic philosophy. Yáñez's use of the language contributes greatly to the feeling of a hermetic situation which is about to change. His prose has an inner rhythm that suggests the regular movement of day-to-day existence; and this rhythm flows into a larger one which is produced by the writer's movement from simple narrative statement to a poetic quality that is based on his understanding the exterior and appreciating the interior at the same time. The town is closed, but only temporarily. The future is open. It would be reasonable to say that the town's hermeticism is ecclesiastical, for its rhythm and its apparent reason for being are controlled by the Church. But Al filo del agua is not a complaint against the Church, because the Church itself is as circumscribed as any inhabitant of the town. The Church has become either its own victim or the victim of some force that is greater than the life of the Church or the life of the town. The members of the clergy do not move in a common direction, have only glimpses of the quality of being. Neither ritualism, nor organizationalism, nor even ordinary human under-\n\n10\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nstanding, can break the spell of restraint, fear, death, cast by the circumstance which past attitudes and actions have created. The town, afraid to die, is living its death. In this respect, Yáñez's town is not very different from other towns, and not just in Mexico, where restraints placed upon the natural inclination to live have made life die. This fact alone would give Αl filo del agua universal appeal. Yáñez narrates from the point of view of the reader, assisted by the author's omniscience. The reader learns of events in the town as if he lived there, and later finds out how and why they happened. But it is the author whose interiorization completes the reason, and the reader whose projection considers the significance. Many characters move within the setting. None becomes a single central figure, but all who are affected directly or indirectly by the possibility of change from the outside contribute to the anticipation that is the focus of the novel. The fact of the coming Revolution identifies the novel with Mexican history. But the town is as clearly the cause of the Revolution as the Revolution is the cause of change in the town. And if the Revolution had not taken its historical form, the town's hermeticism would have been broken in some other way, because it was\"al filo del agua\" The change brings hope to some, despair to others. Frustration and fulfillment are equal possibilities; life is given a chance against death. Potential self-realization stands before everyone. Damián Limón, who has worked in the north, knows that a more attractive material life is possible. But his anxiety cannot wait for the expected moment. His death comes less from the tragedy he precipitated than from his trying to live. The priest, after the Revolution has swept through the town, says Mass because it is the only thing he can think of to do. Gabriel, whose bells have marked the progress of the days, of the years, of life, has before him the possibility of artistic creativity, the opposite of Damián's material ambitions. Victoria, from the outside, knows that the change will bring life to some, but only to some. María, whose dreams would have broken the shell from within, is swept along with the Revolution into the World, which is a substitute for dreams. The town remains, changed but not remade, its hermeticism broken by the Revolution, a Mexican fact, its future to be determined by its awareness of its own identity, a human concern. Αl filo del agua is the best Mexican novel to date, whether judged\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n11\n\npurely on the basis of its artistic worth, or on that basis combined with its merit as the expression of the nation. It brought the author national and international prominence. Some may consider this book afirstnovel because Yáñez's earlier narrative prose is autobiographical to a considerable extent, and its form is not clearly novelistic. But the earlier works are a preparation for the masterpiece, and they all show an important characteristic of the author which is extremely significant in present-day Mexico: the ability to move outward from the particular, the intimate, the commonplace, toward a general identification with the human condition. He is like Ramón López Velarde and, in a somewhat different way, Alfonso Reyes. All three have been particularly successful in being Mexican and universal at the same time. Yáñez's preparation began with his work on a literary review in Guadalajara, Bandera de Provincias, which was published during the lifetime of Contemporáneos4 and which professed to be a provincial organ sharing the goals and interests of the review published in Mexico City. During the years between this beginning and the publication of Al filo del agua, Mexicanfictionwas concerned mainly with objective social discovery: narrative accounts of the military phase of the Revolution, analysis of the social results of the Revolution, awareness and description of the Indian problem. Some good fiction was produced during these years; but as a general rule, art was considered subordinate to message, and sometimes was disregarded entirely. It is easy to let the importance of a work like Al filo del agua distort the facts of literary history. It is wrong to let the impression stand that this novel, because it is indicative in many ways of the direction taken by the best fiction in later years, brought about an immediate 4\n\nFrom 1928 to 1931 the review Contemporáneos was published by some of the most eminent literati of the present century: Torres Bodet, Novo, Cuesta, Ortiz de Montellano, Villaurrutia, Owen, etc. The group was frequently accused of being un-Mexican because they were profoundly interested in foreign literatures. Their fundamental Mexicanism was not recognized by extreme nationalists and propagandists. The nature of this nativist-universalist argument is extremely complicated, and, in addition to comments at various places in this book, I have tried to provide some clarification in an article,\"Contemporáneos and the Limits of Art,\"Romance Notes, V, 2 (Spring, 1964).\n\n12\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nchange in the characteristics of the Mexican novel in general. Yáñez's novel is only one of many published in 1947, and right at that moment was hardly more indicative than any one of several others. The other novels of 1947 that received more than just passing attention hardly indicate the beginning of a new phase, though a few promise a deeper understanding and broader interpretation of the Mexican circumstance. As far as subject matter is concerned, these novels look rather traditional: the tale of the Revolution, personalistic leadership (caciquismo), rural social protest, and the like. María Luisa Ocampo published her first novel, Bajo el fuego, which is another lineal account of experiences of the Revolution similar to many that were published in the thirties and forties. It demonstrates the same need to recount the recent past in an attempt to become aware of what had happened, by sharing experiences with others. Rogelio Barriga Rivas' Guelaguetza, another first novel, deals with the caciquismo theme, but it is really nothing more than a piece of competently written costumbrismo. The critical reception accorded José María Dávila's El médico y el santero is especially revealing in that it shows an interest in the possibility of expressing the Mexican character in fiction combined with a willingness to accept an extremely superficial interpretation.5 Dávila was an accurate observer and reporter. The humor and cynicism of his novel have a kind of picaresque appeal that is reminiscent of José Rubén Romero. Its frankness gives the impression of an uncommonly realistic view of Mexico. Actually it is no more realistic than many others, and the book contains nothing that will take the reader beyond the objective account. Some other authors show new and varied tendencies toward an idea of the novel that is very different from what had become more or less traditional in Mexico. One of these novels has to be regarded as a special case: Jesús Goytortúa Santos' Lluvia roja. In this novel, as in his earlier one, Pensativa, the author makes a successful combination of fact and imagination, which is a good deal closer to what a novel ought to be than is the lineal tale of the Revolution. Goytortúa is not a great novelist, because he lacks the ability to accomplish a refined 5\n\nA discussion with suitable quotations of this critical reaction may be found in Manuel Pedro González, Trayectoria de la novela mexicana, pp. 388-390.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n13\n\nshading of characters, and tends to overstate emotional response. In the earlier novel, he dealt with the cristero rebellions, and in Lluvia roja he deals with the end of the Obregón administration. Both novels are written with the obvious intent of involving the reader in the action; and if the author gives us little or nothing more, it is to his credit that he knows how to attract readers who are not already involved in his own interests. In the rather vague category of the novel of social protest, Magdalena Mondragón published a kind of rural version of Yo como pobre. Her earlier novel describes the life of the very lowest social elements in Mexico City. Mondragón's technique is direct description, and the effectiveness of her protest depends largely on the compassion with which she presents the problem. Más allá existe la tierra shows a similar concern for the rural problem. In both cases, she succeeds in arousing her reader; but the later book is better because a deeper psychological penetration of the characters directs the reader's sympathy toward the plight of individuals rather than toward the generalized problem. For the most part, during the 1930's and early 1940's, the novel tended to be so concerned about the social condition that the authors were led into a kind of abstraction of the problem that left individuals bereft of significance. The same year saw the publication of an inferior novel, Lola Casanova^ by a very important writer, Francisco Rojas González. This novel is the reconstruction of an old legend, and its only possible importance in the history of the genre is that the author's psychological insight is considerable. He had earlier shown the same ability in a better novel, La negra Angustias, which is a novel of the Revolution. We may sometimes question the validity of the author's psychological insight, but there is no doubt that his novel moves forward from the lineal account. Rojas González wrote no more novels, but his interpretive ability is amply apparent in his short stories which probably contribute more to the contemporary novel than his longer works do.6 He can write about various sectors of society without implying that one or the other is the real Mexico. And although his subject matter is un6\n\nJoseph Sommers, \"La génesis literaria en Francisco Rojas González,\" Revista Iberoamericana, XX, 56 (julio-diciembre, 1963), 299-309.\n\n14\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nquestionably Mexican, he bases his fiction on human characteristics that are common among men rather than peculiar to Mexico. Still, his reader does not feel that he is struggling to be universal. His base may be resignation or abnegation or any other universally understood condition, and his identification with Mexico rests on that universality. Undoubtedly the most important book of the year, next to Al filo del agua, is Miguel Lira's Donde crecen los tepozanes ( Where the tepozanes grow), a novela indigenista.7 The book is the first novel of an established poet and playwright. It is radically different from the usual idea of what an indigenista novel is, because it does not protest the Indian problem nor undertake proposals for the integration of two cultures. Rather, Lira's attitude seems to be that this culture is partly integrated, but different, and that the proper starting point is recognition of its nature. Lira wrote a kind of learned folkloric poetry in which his poetic sensitivity changes the commonplace into the legendary. A similar transition takes place in Donde crecen los tepozanes. The chronological setting of the novel could be at any point after a few ChristianEuropean customs and beliefs had infiltrated the native ones. Lira presents this partial conjunction of cultures as if it were quite natural, and he purposely suspends time, which indeed reflects the actual situation since the development of the native culture was halted by the European intrusion. It is not possible to tell where one culture ends and another starts, where reality ends and imagination begins, where fact becomes superstition. It is possible that some might criticize this novel because it does not present easily recognizable characters in a costumbrista setting. The fact is that it does not have the quaint, touristic charm that is often expected of Indianist novels, but presents the disturbing fact of a world different from ours. The people live in a cultural Nirvana where life, death, and time are entirely different from what they are to us. And the contrast with our own attitudes provokes astonishment and speculation. 7\n\nThis is a term used to identify novels that deal with the life and problems of the Indian population, and to distinguish them from the nineteenth-century novels that idealized the Indian.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n15\n\nLira wrote four novels in all, and each one is worthy of special attention as representative of an era. One year after Donde crecen los tepozanes, he published La escondida, the first of two novels of the Revolution. He selected some folkloric, revolutionary figures and set them against the background of the last days of the Díaz regime. These characters tend toward the heroic, but they are not dehumanized. They are similar to the characters in the author's folk-type poetry, and so achieve something of the realist-legendary value of the heroes found in old Spanish romances. They are more authentic than the people that belong to refined society, and Lira used them to set up a confrontation of their world and the other side of Mexican life of that period. If the reader ignores this confrontation, the novel will seem to have two poorly integrated plots: one that deals primarily with Revolutionary action, and one that is the love story of one of the revolutionaries and a woman of the favored social class. If the Revolution was to have any meaning, certainly it would call for some sort of integration of the society. So Lira moves his characters beyond the act of fighting into the problems of a personal relationship where he contrasts the basic with the superficial aspects of Mexican society. If we define a message in this novel, it is that the reality of the folktype characters must prevail, but not without the influence of more cultivated people. However, it is unfair to imply that Lira actually states a message. He only describes a possible situation. Lira's second novel of the Revolution was written ten years later, and is one man's retrospective view of the Revolution. Mientras la muerte llega is, like Fuentes' La muerte de Artemio Cruz and Almanza's Detrás del espejo, an attempt to bring the reality of the Revolution into focus, not by personal reminiscence, but by the recall of a fictional character. By using this technique the author enhances the possibility for analysis rather than mere observation. Una mujer en soledad, which Lira published in 1956, is quite removed from Revolution or from social problems in the ordinary sense of the term. That is, it does not have to do with the plight of any group. It is an epistolary novel, miraculously saved by the author's ability to breathe life into his characters, which has to do with a personal relationship in contemporary life. To be more specific, it is the story of a woman who is made to become what she really is not, by\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\n16\n\nthe pressures of modern society. It is also the story of a man who is irresistibly attracted to her, but cannot save her from destruction. At first glance, this story appears to be the naturalist's account of the woman's fall. But it is not a fall, it is the enforced negation of self. Sometimes novelists appear to deny the importance of social protest and to ignore the great social problems. On the other hand, there are still some writers who examine the problem from the outside, not caring to study the relationship of the problem to the state of being Mexican, of being man. María Elvira Bermúdez, in her review of Concha Villareal's El desierto mágico ( 1961 ), says:\"What is important above all things [in this novel] is to denounce and redeem. That is why this is a social novel, a type that is abundant in Mexico. And it will keep on being abundant as long as there are oppressed to redeem and oppressors to denounce.\"8 The point is not whether a book does or does not present a social problem, but whether it does anything else. I do not mean that the author is obliged to present a solution to any problem he may describe, but that he needs to relate the problem to the basic human qualities and allow the coincidence to be seen in individuals. Herein lies the art of the novelist, whether or not he wishes to emphasize a problem. There is little point in a novelist's being a poor sociologist. It is not possible to understand recent Mexican fiction without knowing that the country passed through a social revolution that did not create utopia. Some believe that the Revolution has been betrayed, others that a predictable human compromise has been made between what was hoped for and what was possible. The fact is that, although a very large number of Mexicans enjoy a higher standard of living than before the Revolution, the distribution of wealth and the national product are still far from satisfactory. And it is also necessary to point out that certain elements of society, like those in Magdalena Mondragón's Yo como pobre, and some rural groups, do not live within the national economy at all, but subsist on the margin of it. We may hope that in a world where, in spite of the many selfincurred dangers, men appear to be more concerned than they used to be for the material welfare of other men, a combination of individ8\n\nLetras. XXXI, 165 (julio, 1962), p. 2.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n17\n\nual human concern and the principles of the Revolution will assure the continuation of the progress that has changed Mexico into a modern nation in the last fifty years. A great deal of Mexican fiction since the Revolution shows dissatisfaction with the social interpretation of the change. Not much of this fiction is revolutionary in the sense that it advocates another revolution. But it does show plainly that such an upheaval is within the realm of possibility unless attention is paid to the needs of the nation as a whole and confidence expressed in its future. In general, the attitude of the novelists is hopeful. But the clearest hope is apparent where the author goes beyond the presentation of a social problem and attempts to find the reality that is deeper than the problem. The fiction that is chronologically closer to the Revolution than the books that we have just been dealing with shows that Mexico, after the Revolution, went through a process of introversion and of extroversion at the same time. The country felt a need to understand its own nature and its problems; but at the same time it needed to understand its relationship with the rest of the world. But what was the nation? To a considerable extent, it was new. Mexico has an important history, and present-day Mexico is rooted in that history; but the modus operandi from the time of the Revolution has been quite different from what it was before. The most important single reason is that a larger part of the population is incorporated into the life of the country. During the years when Mexico was first going through the simultaneous and conflicting processes of introversion and extroversion, the attempts to understand the nature of the country were often inhibited by the lack of awareness of the fact of the Revolution.9 This question of awareness can best be understood in terms of the individual. If a person is affected by a favorable change of circumstances, he may profit from the change before he is quite aware of what has happened to him. He may recall an event that precipitated the change, but its significance in relation to his changed circumstances half eludes him. He does not really know what has happened. And only 9\n\nIt should be understood that such a generalization must necessarily have notable exceptions. Perhaps the outstanding example is Samuel Ramos.\n\n18\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\ntime will enable him to appreciate fully the nature of the present and, indeed, the fact that he is a different person. So it was in the case of the Mexican change; and by the year 1947, I believe enough progress had been made toward the state of necessary awareness so that at least the mainstream of fiction goes beyond the description of the problem to study the nature of Mexico and of man. And it is important to observe that the relationship of one nation to another has changed in such a way that Mexican reality cannot be apprehended except in terms of universal man. So it is perfectly understandable that if a particular kind of anxiety focuses the attention of a writer on a social problem, the obverse of that anxiety might cause another writer to ignore the problem and address himself to man's universal condition. And it is possible for a novelist to combine the two procedures effectively. Not long after the publication of Al filo del agua, Agustín Yáñez entered politics and became governor of the state of Jalisco, an act thoroughly in accord with his idea of what a novelist should be and do. Both jobs require the same vision, the same projection beyond objective fact. His political activities broke the thread of his novelistic production temporarily, and a number of important books were published by other authors before his next novel appeared. The first novel of really major importance after Al filo del agua was Juan Rulfo's Pedro Páramo ( 1955 ). During the years between these great novels, almost all the important novelists who had published before 1947, ended their careers. The most important of them was Mariano Azuela, whose Sendas perdidas was published in 1949, followed by two posthumous novels, La maldición and Esa sangre, in 1955 and late 1956 respectively. Sendas perdidas is a somewhat better novel than the quarrelsome books that Azuela had been writing toward the end of his career. Instead of being petulantly disgusted with the loss of ordinary moral values in the new Mexican society, he seems to be probing for deeper causes. The book suggests that the author senses the need for common concern among men, and that he is willing to consider this need rather than insist blindly on the perverseness of the modern world. La maldición is more like the novels published immediately before Sendas perdidas, and adds neither to the stature of the writer nor to his interpretation of Mexico.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n19\n\nThe most important of the three books is Esa sangre, a novel which rounds out Azuela's production because it is about the return of Julián Andrade, the male protagonist of Mala yerba, one of the author's earliest novels, in which he clearly draws the contrast between the landed aristocracy and the rural poor. Azuela does not defend the morality of either class in these novels, but concerns himself with where the power lies. In Mala yerba, whatever we may think of Andrade's conduct, power is on his side. When he returns, in Esa sangre, he is essentially the same person, unwilling to assume that power has deserted him. But he is obviously wrong, and his intransigence leads to his death. This book is the final comment of a great novelist whose works give us his view of the whole spectrum of the Revolution: the society from which it burst, the military phase, the chaos, and the organized social result. However much he may question some of the values of the new society, Azuela recognizes the fact of its existence. The addition of Esa sangre to Azuela's works gives his view of modern Mexico a depth of perspective that it could not have without the dovetailing of time and circumstance that is effected by the return of Julián Andrade. Mauricio Magdaleno achieved a similar perspective in Tierra Grande ( 1949 ), a long and complicated novel that looks backward to the time of the Revolution and examines its effect on a large and important landholding family. The novel has a structural protagonist in the person of Gustavo Suárez Medrano, but the spiritual protagonist is the family as a whole. Following his usual custom, Magdaleno went back several generations to set the stage for the members of the family who are contemporary with the principal action of the novel. Gustavo is the most ruthless of the young generation, and perhaps the most devoted to the land. For the Suárez Medrano family, the land is essence. Even though they are removed from the direct act of extracting life from the land, they still feel the relationship so deeply that defense of the land is almost equivalent to defense of life. Indeed, there have been moments in the family's past when land was more important than life. Magdaleno makes no attempt to justify the cruelty that has grown out of the family's passion, but he does show that their ownership is important to them for reasons that are much deeper than the purely economic. The land is belonging, and it is identification. Relation-\n\n20\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nships may be broken within the family, but the integrity of the land remains. The Revolution comes to destroy this relationship between the family and its property. Gustavo, courageous and ruthless, admirable and hateful, holds on as well as he can to the meaning of his existence. But as the Revolution progresses, he gradually degenerates, and hope is found only in a new generation. Magdaleno's central theme in this novel, the feeling for the land, functions exactly as it should and serves as the focal point for the study of a multitude of characters. Many of the people are seen with admirable clarity, but the dominating characterization is of the family. The social role of this family, as a unit, is destroyed, but there is no doubt that the strength of character that has grown from their well-founded sense of belonging will cast them in new roles. At the same time, the land takes on new significance for some to whom it has been denied, and their roles too will change. Magdaleno, who had neglected the novel for many years, published two in 1949, and then lapsed into another long silence. His second novel of that year, Cabello de elote, is an ambitious failure, but a significant one. It is a panoramic view of a small Mexican town during the Second World War. The picture of the town in the process of change is superb. Magdaleno shows the communication and lack of communication among the different social classes, the conflict between political conservatism and progressivism, the influence of immigrants from Europe, the effect of the changing agricultural economy. The novel's great fault, and it is major, is that the central theme is not strong enough to justify the enormous, panoramic backdrop. Indeed the panorama becomes so important the theme is sometimes forgotten. The title of the novel, Cabello de elote, refers to the blonde hair of the protagonist, who is the daughter of an Indian woman and a foreigner. Although she is rescued from a poor economic environment, her social position in the town remains nebulous and she is alternately accepted and rejected. Her goal is to find a new environment where she can be an integrated person. The theme is a perfectly good one, and the author is sensitive enough to its implications. The trouble is that there are too many things going on around the theme.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n21\n\nMagdaleno's town was at one time almost entirely dependent on a nearby hacienda. It is not hard to imagine a place similar to the town in Al filo del agua. But the economy of the town had to change when the land was redistributed, and it is anything but hermetic when Magdaleno describes it. It is open to all kinds of influences, and change and confusion are apparent everywhere. A new middle class has appeared, and it has some of the characteristics of Azuela's\"nueva burguesía,\" but Magdaleno does not have Azuela's bitterness. European immigrants have brought an awareness of the size of the world. A movie theater is the symbol of a new sophistication. The old aristocracy clings to its conservative point of view, but cannot remain separated from the new middle class. Neither the one nor the other knows exactly what the relationship is, and neither the town nor its individual constituents can be sure of an exact identity. The personality of the protagonist is, to an extent, a reflection of the town's confusion. The Indian is apart from the rest of the town; and although Magdaleno does not exclude the possibility of integration, the hope belongs to a future that is farther away than tomorrow. Magdaleno's position here, among the\"older\"novelists, is strange. His earlier works do indeed belong to the preceding period because of their concern with the social problem; but even these early novels are concerned with the condition of man in a way that is not characteristic of the novel of protest. Rather, they are to a considerable extent forerunners of Al filo del agua and Magdaleno's own later works. His neglect of the novel is based on his decision to turn his efforts in another direction, not on his having rounded out his novelistic circle or having reached a conclusion. His work stands with an open end pointing toward the future, and he really should be publishing currently. José Mancisidor, on the other hand, obviously finished his work when he published his last two novels in 1953, Frontero junto al mar and El alba en las cimas. The first is about the invasion of Veracruz by Northamerican marines in 1914, the second about the expropriation of oil. Both novels are intensely nationalistic, and they will certainly make a conscientious Northamerican aware of why his country is not universally loved. El alba en las cimas, like all of Mancisidor's novels except Frontera junto al mar, promises more than it\n\n22\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nproduces. On beginning a Mancisidor novel, the reader is likely to expect a penetrating study based on a social position. It is unfortunate that the author's ideological anxiety overshadows his interest in authentic creation; and while the novels are never quite devoid of art, they do not come up to the reader's expectation or the author's ability. Frontera junto al mar fares better, perhaps because it is the account of an event in which the author participated. In this book, the author's position is so closely identified with his action that one would hardly overshadow the other. Entresuelo, published by Gregorio López y Fuentes in 1948, has to be mentioned only because of the author's reputation. It is a middleclass novel of the city, subject matter in which the author had shown no earlier interest, which is written in the realist tradition and might more properly belong to the nineteenth century than to the twentieth. It has nothing of the legendlike value that is the outstanding characteristic of the earlier novels that used folkloric or indigenist themes. And without that quality, not much is left, for López y Fuentes was never a great literary artist. Entresuelo tells us that there is a middle class, but it does not take us beyond the fact.10 Among the younger writers, several followed the lead of Magdalena Mondragón in Yo como pobre. This theme of indignation concerning the plight of the urban poor is a compelling one, but apparently not a rich one. It is the theme of the only novels of Benigno Corona Rojas {La barriada, 1948) and of Felipe García Arroyo (El sol sale para 10 It should be noted here that this discussion cannot hope to include all the novelists whose names are respected. Some were writing in this period whose work, in my opinion, does not need to be considered at this point. Rodolfo Benavides, an uncultivated writer, wrote with considerable native force. His protest is strong, but his view is entirely personal, and his work neither benefits from nor contributes to what other novelists were doing. Fernando Robles published Cuando el águila perdió sus alas, an account of the Northamerican invasion, in 1951. It it a good historical novel, but not different from his earlier works. Luis Rivero del Val published his only novel, Entre las patas de los caballos, in 1953. This lineal account of personal experiences in the cristero rebellions really belongs to an earlier period. Artemio de Valle Arizpe, raconteur, author of colonialist and quasi-picaresque novels, continued writing in the same vein until his death in 1962. A charming anachronism even in his youth, he was doubly so in his later years.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n23\n\ntodos, 1948) ; and even in cases of more productive writers, only one novel by each author is on this theme. Yo como pobre is the only one by Mondragón, Candelaria de los patos (1952) is Héctor Raúl Almanza's treatment of the theme, and Barriga Rivas published Río humano ( 1949) between a novel on the theme of the cacique (Guefoguetza, 1947) and an indigenista novel (La mayordomía, 1952). These novels of misery, of the dregs of urban society, have relatively little artistic value. They are mainly descriptive of a deplorable social condition. The blame is not clearly fixed, though Corona Rojas tends to place it on corrupt officials. In general, the assumption is that the social condition is the fault of society as a whole, and that it is society's duty to change the condition. Usually there is some impulse in one or another of the characters to improve himself—the strongest is in Candelaria de los patos—but the general picture is one of hopelessness. There are a few people who like to say that these novels portray the real Mexico, and they like to make a contrast with cafe society, ignoring the tremendous upward impulse of the majority of the Mexican people. The fact is that both social extremes are false, both groups are actually less alive than the middle. While the social propagandists make active use of the novels of misery, there is no reason to think that the writers consider these criminals, prostitutes, and thieves as representative of the real Mexico. If they did, surely they would write more about them. They do consider this subhuman element to be a part of visible reality in Mexico, and they know that its existence cannot be ignored. The different novelists' approaches to the subject matter vary widely. None of them has actually experienced the life he describes. Magdalena Mondragón tries hard for identification, but the best she can do is be compassionate, so her novel is not entirely convincing. García Arroyo tries to be a Luis Buñuel, and it is possible that more experience as a writer might have enabled him to succeed. His novel has two major faults: a lack of precision in character delineation, and a tiresome use of nouns for descriptive purposes. He insists on describing the revolting scene to the point that the reader reacts against the novelist. Corona Rojas' novel has a different focus: the exploitation of the poor by dishonest officials. His protest is so violent that he\n\n24\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nbreaks the action in an editorial fashion. Almanza's novel is the most positive of the group, because his emphasis is on hope. Barriga Rivas is the most objective. Río humano is a series of snapshots of the people who pass through a police station on a given evening. The structure is weak, and the author is in no way involved with his socially condemned characters. But it is probably the most convincing of all these novels because the author does not make a futile attempt to identify with characters whom he could know only from the outside. Barriga Rivas is a costumbrista novelist, and that quality is the dominant characteristic of Río humano as well as of his other novels. Among the works of Mondragón and Almanza, on the other hand, the novels of urban misery amount to one aspect of a wide range of social protest. Almanza's began with Huelga blanca in 1950. And after Candelaria de los patos, came Brecha en la roca in 1955, and two more novels after that date. He has dealt with wetbacks, the exploitation of oil workers by foreign companies, the fishing industry, and the meaning of the Revolution. In many ways, Almanza is an old-fashioned writer. He has no stylistic tricks, no significance beyond what is readily apparent. The truth is that his novels are sometimes a welcome relief from those that intend to involve the reader beyond what the writer actually says. In his earlier novels, his characterizations are carelessly done, or else they are purposely stereotyped. He obviously holds Northamericans in very low regard, and his evaluation of their moral standards is unjust to the point of being ludicrous. But Anglo-Americans should be aware that Almanza is not alone in this evaluation, and that some Northamerican evaluations of Mexicans are just as absurd. In his later novels, Almanza shows some improvement in characterization, and starts to move beyond the descriptive. The indigenista theme constitutes a particular kind of social protest because it involves not only an economic issue, but a cultural one as well. Indeed, this kind of novel is less a novel of protest than of cultural analysis. While it is obviously important to incorporate the Indian population into the national economy, it is even more important to understand the significance of the Indian influence in the national culture. The discussion of nativism has been long and sometimes bitter, and only recently has there been much calm clarification of it.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n25\n\nSince there are still almost as many positions as there are people, any statement is likely to bring upon its maker the wrath or indignation of a substantial number of critics. My opinion is that indigenous culture in Mexico is alive but static, as it has been since the time of the Conquest. Large segments of the Indian population had reached a high degree of civilization at that time. In some ways the Indians were more civilized than the Spaniards. But the egocentric anxiety of the Spaniards, their desire to make the world over in their own image, was so overwhelming that the impact of the confrontation of two cultures brought the development of the indigenous to a standstill. Yet the indigenous culture was not destroyed. Miguel Lira says something to this effect in Donde crecen los tepozanes. Since that time, a fusion of the two cultures has been in process, though not always in the most desirable way. If we think of the indigenous culture as an identifiable and independent reality, it exists only among small and isolated groups of Indians. If, however, we think of how indigenous culture has modified the European culture which throttled its development, we find that the influence is considerable. Movements to revive indigenous culture are futile and reactionary. Attempts to understand indigenous culture, on the other hand, are absolutely necessary, because the result of the fusion can never be understood in any other way. From the time of the Revolution the Indian was given more serious attention in the novel as well as elsewhere. The new treatment certainly differentiated him from the romanticized Indian of the last century. But it tended to generalize him and to recognize his dignity without searching for a deep-rooted cause of that dignity. Miguel Angel Menéndez moved toward improvement in Nayar (1941), in which he sends his protagonist into the world of a special group, the coras. A different, but even more mature, approach was used by Lira. In 1948, a great push in the same direction was given by two books dealing with the tzotziles: Juan Pérez Jolote by Ricardo Pozas Α., and Ramón Rubin's El callado dolor de los tzotzües. The more influential of the two has been Juan Pérez Jolote, which is not a novel but the account by a social anthropologist of the life of a tzotzil. Its accuracy is generally accepted, and it is read with the intense interest that a fine work of this type deserves. Actually, the\n\n26\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nbook is something between scientific description and novel. Pozas limits the amount of detail and in his language captures the simplicity of his subject. By doing so he brings his reader within the situation, and the effect is something like that of a good historical novel, where the author re-creates the feeling of a time past and moves his reader into it. If Pozas' documentary tends to be novelistic, Rubin's novel tends to be documentary, and they come out nearly even. Of the two books, Pozas' is the more compelling because his choice of detail attracts the reader while Rubín loses his reader by his insistence on too much detail. However, Rubin's interests are more varied, and he has written of other Indian groups and also of mestizos.11 It is a pity that he does not see the value of more careful character development and plot construction. If he would take this care, the re-creation of an unfamiliar culture would be more complete, and he would make a greater contribution to the understanding of the fusion of cultures and to the understanding of man. One of the principal values of the ethnological tendency in the indigenista novel is the representation of man in a culture sufficiently different from our own to make us aware of facts that we normally ignore. At its best this kind of novel goes far beyond the representation of an isolated group. However insistent the social problem theme may be in the recent Mexican novel, this kind of writing has tended gradually to do more than just describe the problem. Sometimes the desire to transcend the immediate leaves the author in an unresolved mess which he cannot clarify adequately. José Revueltas, one of the most strongly committed and most artistically capable of Mexican writers, has failed even after several attempts to write the novel that many consider him capable of. Revueltas maintains a strong leftist position politically; and although this position is apparent in his novels, the author wishes to base it on the condition of man rather than on the volume of his 11\n\nEl canto de la grilla (1952) concerns the coras and La bruma lo vuelve azul (1954) concerns the huicholes. The author calls La canoa perdida (1951) a\"novela mestiza.'9 It is not really a novela indigenista, but the author's insistence on a kind of documentary use of folklore makes this book interesting in a consideration of the fusion of cultures.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n27\n\nprotest. The impression left by a Revueltas novel is that somehow the author gets lost and is never able to do what he sets out to do. Revueltas' first novel, Los muros de agua ( 1941 ), deals with political prisoners and is notable mainly because the author is fundamentally concerned with them as people. The second novel, El luto humano, was published in 1943, and it indicated to many critics the author's tremendous potential. It also suggested that a politically committed novelist could write a novel without forsaking either his commitment or his art. The people are rural, destitute, facing death; but the meaning of death is controlled by the meaning of life—if it can be called that—which has had no significance except on the most basic level. They are lost, utterly lost; and although they have participated in the Revolution, in strikes, in whatever they were asked to do, these actions have had no meaning, the participants have never known the why. Their land is nothing, their religion is nothing, their actions are nothing, their life is nothing. They only die. Revueltas has the elements of a very powerful novel, yet somewhere he misses. Three faults are identifiable. One is that the reader is thrown off by inconsistent characterization. Revueltas knows how to make characters, but some are seen in the clarity of daylight, others in the mist of poetry. A second fault is lack of narrative organization. Revueltas does not use a line straight or even in a pattern, but breaks it up and puts the pieces in a bowl that is his novel. The third fault is that the author seems not to be able to express his ideology adequately through his creating of characters, and the reader feels the strain and confusion that are the author's. Yet, in spite of these faults, Revueltas is a compelling novelist because he makes his reader anticipate greater things. The same criticism could be made of Los días terrenales ( 1949 ), which the Communist Party caused him to renounce, and Los motivos de Caín ( 1957 ) which is an indictment of the brutality of Northamerican soldiers in the Second World War. Nowhere is the feeling of human isolation stronger than in this last novel, but the strength of the book is mitigated by the author's forcing it to say what his political position demanded. In novels of social protest, the author's most effective tool is the ability to construct a narrative. Neither perceptive observation nor\n\n28\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nstrong commitment can be as effective as a story that will involve the reader in the world of the fictional characters. In this respect, Revueltas has repeatedly failed. Luis Spota, with considerably less artistic sensitivity than Revueltas, has had amazing success. His characterizations are often superficial and he is inclined to be sensationalist, but his ability to tell a story is one that other novelists cannot afford to overlook. From 1948 to the present, Spota has published novels that give the inside stories of the bullfight, migrant workers, cafe society, and other subjects in which the author finds injustice and hypocrisy. The novels are to a considerable extent a refinement and enlargement of what the author does in his newspaper column. Murieron en mitad del río (1948) set the tone of Spota's fiction and it hasn't changed much since. His most widely read work is Casi el paraíso (1956) which is a condemnation of cafe society in Mexico City. In this book, as in many others, Spota expresses himself so strongly he becomes silly. It has been widely read because it is easy, it is scandalous, and it belabors a group toward which few feel any particular generosity. Spota really doesn't pretend to be enough of an artist to be included in the tradition of the deeply searching novel that was established by Yáñez in 1947. The contribution of Spota to the new novel is his cosmopolitanism combined with his honest concern for the welfare of Mexico. His work would naturally help the novel of social protest move from its position of isolation. During the years when an older generation was disappearing and a younger one establishing itself, the short story acquired an unusual importance in Mexican fiction. Three specific volumes probably did more to enhance the artistic awareness of the novel than did any three novels of the same period: Juan José Arreola's Confabularlo ( 1952), Juan Rulfo's El llano en llamas ( 1953 ), and Carlos Fuentes' Los días enmascarados (1954). All three writers later turned to the novel, though Arreola not until late 1963, and then with a kind of antinovel. Fuentes is the only one who can be called prolific. It is not easy now to think of these collections outside the framework of their subsequent influence and the later work of their authors. Trying to place myself in 1952, when Confabularlo was published, I think that if it were not for Rubén Salazar Mallén's Ejercicios,\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n29\n\nArreola's stories might appear to be lost in a sea of concern for immediate problems and past memories. Confabularlo is a work of the imagination, though I don't mean to say that Arreola is unaware of the world around him. Quite to the contrary, he is probably more deeply aware of it than most of his contemporaries. But the world that comes out of Arreola is one that has passed under the spell of his particular way of looking at things. Salazar Mallén's Ejercicios contains a story,\" S o l e d a d , \" which, according to its author, is\" t h e only novel that has been written in Mexico from within and toward within and with interest in immortality rather than in the present moment.\" 12 This statement would have been an exaggeration in 1952, and it was nonsense in 1958. But if we assume that its author, writing in 1958 about his own work, recaptured the feeling he had when he wrote the story in 1952, we may understand that he felt some uneasiness about the lasting value of Mexican fiction. \" S o l e d a d \"is a sound and penetrating view into the life of an isolated and insignificant individual. What the author did not take account of in 1952, but should have known by 1958, is that the attitude he describes had been present for many years and was becoming characteristic of the mainstream of Mexican fiction. The evidence is apparent in many works, Arreola's Varia invencion, among them. As for Arreola's stories, Varia invencion and Confabularlo are of one piece, and indeed they do later constitute a single volume. It is necessary to say something about Arreola's way of looking at things. Arreola happen. In spite of Arreola's easy expression and amazing flow of ideas, I suspect he is really an introvert, because the world comes out of him bearing a highly personal stamp and listing slightly to one side. A project to get a camel through a needle's eye so that rich men can go to heaven involves all the knowledge of modern science and philanthropy in such a way that if the experiment doesn't succeed, the wealthy will have become poor from supporting it and will have no problem after all (\"La verdad os digo\"). The national railways become part ghost, part paper empire, part reality, and part absurd12\n\n\"Letras. Actualidad y perennidad,\"Mañana, 12 abril 1958.\n\n30\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nity (\"El guardagujas\"). No one could say seriously that Arreola is not dealing with reality. No one could say that he is not profoundly Mexican. But he speaks to all of us. Arreola is one of those fortunate people who don't need to serve an apprenticeship; or else he's one of those wise people who don't publish until they have practiced enough. In any case, the excellence of Arreola 's writing attracted attention and gave it immediate status, which was a blessing for Mexican fiction. It is not fair to consider ous slant leads him overboard and at other times it leaves him standing with no place to go. And it must be observed that some of his pieces are not stories, but little bits of poorly developed inspiration. Still there is no doubt that he had a liberating effect on fiction. Juan Rulfo's stories are entirely different from Arreola's; and although it may not be just to select between such different works, I believe Rulfo's have more value as a body of literature because their quality is more consistent and because they represent a clearer involvement of the author, his immediate environment, and the larger world of all men. El llano en llamas (The Plain Aflame) is a collection of rural stories, though sometimes the rural values are made apparent by the injection of an\"outsider\"contrast. Common to all the stories is a certain parched quality, a feeling of dust in the throat, of dogged living in spite of what happens, of resistance to change, of belonging to something that is hostile or at best senseless and at the same time indispensable. Sometimes an attitude or a custom will be based on primitive logic that will not work in a complicated society; but Rulfo's stories are in no way costumbrista, because the author's reason for writing is not to show quaint customs, but to examine the actions of men. A valuable comparison can be made with the writing of William Faulkner, whose aim is certainly not to show the quaint customs of Mississippi, but to use them for other purposes.13 Rulfo's 13\n\nSome people have seen further similarities between Faulkner and Rulfo, as well as other Spanish-American novelists. See, for example, James E. Irby, La influencia de William Faulkner en cuatro narradores hispanoamericanos (Mexico City: n.p., 1956). I doubt that this influence is very profound. It is quite possible that Faulkner demonstrated for these writers the validity of\n\nArreola\n\nperf\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n31\n\nstyle is entirely different from Faulkner's. His language is strong, simple, even coarse. It has characteristics of rural speech; but it is not rural speech because objectively we know that the characters would not speak that way, nor would Rulfo. The closest I can come to describing this style is to say that he captures and uses the essence of rural speech so that we accept his language as authentic, but allow it to remove us from a folkloric plane to a mythic plane where we observe not customs but symbols of customs. The stories of Los días enmascarados are more in the nature of exercises than are the stories of Arreola and Rulfo. Fuentes is primarily a novelist, and his stories are preliminary to the main event. They show two extremely important characteristics: the author's interest in the role of indigenous culture in contemporary Mexico, and his willingness to enter a world of fantasy which, at its best, becomes superreality. Juan Rulfo was the first of these three writers to publish a novel. Pedro Páramo ( 1955 ) is, on the first reading, one of the most difficult novels ever published; but on subsequent readings we are more and more amazed by its unique clarity. I suppose we might make interesting speculations about different influences; and since Rulfo has read other novelists, the speculations would perhaps have some justification. But I think it would be impossible to say that Pedro Páramo is like any other novel. Precisely for this reason, the initial reading is difficult, because the book cannot be read as other novels are read. Nor can it be described as other novels are described. It is possible and desirable to make some objective statements about what Pedro Páramo is, but it should be remembered that such statements alone cannot describe the novel. Pedro Páramo is a cacique, and the novel is the story of his hate and the people who are tyrannized by it, including himself. Hate is both the cause and result of his power and his obsessive love for one woman. He is the epitome of egocentricity. There is no time. It is wrong to say that Rulfo suspends time; he doesn't suspend it, because it doesn't exist. Characmoving from the regional to the universal. Faulkner's influence was that of a teacher, not a model.\n\n32\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nters pass back and forth between the two states we call life and death with no regard for what we consider possible. The style is fundamentally the same as in the author's short stories. The narrative viewpoint is varied and changes as is required by Rulfo's reconstruction of reality. It is possible that the author is subject to criticism on this last point. It may be that the frequent changes make the novel unnecessarily difficult, but I am inclined, after several readings, to believe that the author is right. The story opens with the arrival in Comala of Juan Preciado, one of the many sons of Pedro Páramo, sent by his dying mother to claim from his father what was his due. The town is dead, and so is Doña Eduviges, who receives Juan Preciado into her house. Or perhaps this death is life. Eduviges talks with Juan about his mother who was her friend.\" P o o r Dolores. She must have felt abandoned. We promised each other we'd die together. . . . So she's ahead of me? But you can be sure I'll catch up with her. I know how far away heaven is, but I know how to find the shortcuts. It's a question of dying, God willing, when you want to and not when He wants you to. Or if you'd rather, you make Him want it ahead of time.\" 14 Beyond the first few pages of this book, any reference by the reader to either life or death is utterly useless. There are states of being in the novel, but an exterior comment on them is impossible. The book must be read with the subconscious. The reader cannot stay outside the novel. And he must do even more than just enter the book. He must unite with it, entering into the book and allowing the book to enter him. Once the subconscious is open, the reader's problem is solved. Since time does not exist in the subconscious, the major obstacle is removed, and what at first seemed unreal now appears to be quite the reverse. Páramo's obsession becomes a lyric and is perfectly placed wherever it interrupts the throat-parching narration. \"The wind made us laugh. Our eyes met as the kite string ran between our fingers after the wind, until it broke with a gentle snap as if it had been cut by a bird's wing. And up above, the paper bird fell somer14\n\nJuan Rulfo, Pedro Páramo, 4th ed. (Mexico City: Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1963), p. 16.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n33\n\nsaulting, dragging its rag tail, disappearing in the green of the earth. Pedro Páramo's love-obsession, his hate, and his power are one. The church bells ring in Comala, they ring until they deafen the people, who learn that they are tolling the death of Susana. People come, vendors come, musicians come, a travelling circus comes. The festive air grows, and even when the bells stop, the fiesta goes on. Around Páramo all is quiet. He looks at Comala: \" 'I will fold my arms and Comala will die of hunger.' And that is what he did.\"16 The fate of Comala, of Susana, and of Páramo are one. However you comprehend the change, it is the natural fruition of existence, and the change in Páramo is interior as well as exterior. He is a ripe fruit dropping.\" H e leaned on the arms of Damiana Cisneros and tried to walk. After a few steps he fell, pleading within, but not saying a word. He made a dry thud against the ground and crumbled as if he were a pile of rocks.\"17 We can only ask if this is the death of life or the death of death. Nowhere in Mexican literature has the caciquismo theme been treated as well as in Pedro Páramo. There is not the slightest doubt that Rulfo knows what he is talking about, that he understands his theme, and that he is able to show the reality of it as it had never been shown before. Quite naturally, some readers object to the difficult access to the novel, and some prefer to reject it rather than work for what it says. I can sympathize with the reluctance to participate so actively, but it seems to me that the result is worth the effort. Even more disturbing to me is the occasional assumption that a simple, descriptive novel of protest is a more patriotic undertaking than an artistically important novel. Such an attitude seems to me to be equal to saying that an observation is worth more than a reason. Certainly observation has its uses, but I think it does not speak directly to the present need in Mexico. The continuation of the movement of the Revolution in Mexico seems to me to depend on the development of a deep understanding of Mexican reality. Rulfo has contributed not15\n\nIbid., p. 18. Ibid., p. 143. 17 Ibid., p. 152. 16\n\n\"Your\n\n34\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nably to this end. And unless I read the contemporary novel poorly, such is the general orientation of the writers. Just as Rulfo's work is based on a social circumstance that can be defined as a problem, so the other writers begin with the problem and transcend its visible reality. And even if, in some cases, the visible reality is not a typically Mexican social problem, the universal human reality discovered by the author also contributes to the Mexican act of self discovery. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that treatment of the novel becomes more difficult as we approach the present day. Current criticism is not very helpful, because it is not really independent. Personal friendships or enmities, the pressure of literary cliques, and political and professional associations inhibit objective, professional criticism. And since the number of novels published is increasing steadily, it is difficult to separate wheat from chaff, and even harder to say which of the wheat is best. My notes reveal the names of something more than eighty novelists who might be given a place in this chapter. The exigencies of time, space, and sound judgment demand a considerable reduction in that number, and we must proceed bravely, knowing that some injustice will be done. It is not easy for a novelist to achieve the wide and deep reality of Pedro Páramo. Two other good novels of the same year show how the novelist's view rarely acquires the dimensions of Rulfo's: José Alvarado's El personaje and Almanza's Brecha en la roca. Alvarado, a keenly perceptive observer of human nature, had already published Memoria de un espejo in 1953. Both works are short novels that make fine contributions to the tendency to look beyond the immediately apparent. It is unfortunate that Alvarado has not written more. Almanza, on the other hand, is the hard-hitting, indignant corrector of injustice—honorable, but not very enlightening. Considering these and other novels of the year, we find that quantitatively, the novelists still take a view that is turned inward upon Mexico, but not toward the basic nature of man. The following year shows less nationalistic concern. Among its books are Azuela's Esa sangre, Lira's Una mujer en soledad, a minor Revueltas work (En algún valle de lágrimas), and La veleta oxidada by newcomer Emilio Carballido. Although he is well known and properly respected as a playwright, Carballido's stories and novels are\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n35\n\noften overlooked. La veleta oxidada and El norte (1958) are short pieces, but they are novels and good ones. Both are concise examinations of human relationships. Like many contemporary novels, they show the loneliness of the individual, whose relationships are either nullified or perverted by the failure of contemporary society to be significant. The two novels are similar in many ways, but El norte is the stronger of the two. It concerns the misery-ridden love affair of a middle-aged woman and a young boy. The egocentricity of one or the other member of this unnatural union forbids the realization of every decent tendency on the part of either the woman or the boy. The reality of the situation is made apparent by the author's movement between past and present. He writes a neat but sketchy prose that invites the reader to fill in what the author does not say. Carballido is utterly pessimistic, and some people believe that this kind of pessimism, which is found in many contemporary novels, is characteristic of the writer who does not base his work on an intimately known situation, regional or personal.18 It is true that novels like those of Yáñez, Rulfo, Fuentes, Castellanos, and others, leave a somewhat more positive impression. It is difficult to say whether they actually are less pessimistic. Their affirmation may be only in the implication of possible action. And that action may be nullified by the same living of death that is at the root of more abstract pessimism. The novelist's aim would be the same in both cases: to discover life. Whatever its shortcomings, the most spectacular novel of 1956 was Spota's Casi el paraíso, because of the direction of its attack and because of its sensationalism. In addition to the fact that the people who are the object of the attack are an unlovely bunch, these same people represent the greatest threat to the progress of the nation, less on account of their accumulation of wealth than on account of their lack of human concern. They are, of course, just as disoriented as the characters of Carballido or anyone else. The novel is important because it reached a very large number of readers. Its place in history, however, will be slight, because Carlos Fuentes did the job much better two years later. The appearance in 1957 of a lineal account of the Revolution, José 18\n\nRosario Castellanos,\"La novela mexicana contemporánea,\"México en la Cultura, no. 597 (21 agosto 1960), pp. 1 ff.\n\n36\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nPérez Moreno's El tercer canto del gallo, indicates the persistence of that kind of novel; but it looks completely out of place beside Revueltas' Los motivos de Caín and Rosario Castellanos' Balúm Canán, both of the same year, and sandwiched between the extraordinarily imaginative works of 1956 and 1958. In Balúm Canán, Castellanos goes back to her childhood as a means of discovering reality that is hidden from an adult, and deals with a dispute between the Argüelles family and an Indian group. Her approach to the problem is not sociological but personal. The situation she describes is really a frontier situation where the two cultures come into contact. Castellanos has all the necessary ethnological information, which combined with her desire for human understanding, makes a very different and welcome approach to the indigenista theme. In 1962, she published a more mature novel, Oficio de tinieblas, which probes similar material even more deeply. The Indian is not at all generalized. Although the reader is aware of the customs that lie behind the behavior of the characters, each one is seen individually. Once in a while the author falls into the\"many-moons-will-pass\"pretentiousness that has bedevilled so much Indianist literature, but the total effect of the novel is far removed from such foolishness. Castellanos' thought is contained within the action of the novel, a story of the confrontation of two cultures. These cultures have been mutually influential; but there has been no real marriage of them, and human relationships fall into the abyss that exists between the two. Oficio de tinieblas is an eloquent demonstration of how this happens. The author's optimism consists of the suggestion that new and more radical approaches to the problem are needed, but it is not clear what these approaches should be. The richness of 1958 is overwhelming, both with regard to the number of good novels published and with regard to the breadth and depth of the authors' view. The outstanding novel of the year is Carlos Fuentes' La región más transparente (Where the Air Is Clear),19 the first novel of one of Mexico's best writers, and probably the most widely discussed book written in Mexico. The reaction to it reflects both its merits and faults, but no one opinion of the novel has given 19\n\nThe reference, well known in Mexican literature, is to Mexico City.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n37\n\nadequate importance to both the good and the bad. Interestingly enough, the best review of La región más transparente was written by Anthony West20 after the translation appeared in the United States. It is a tribute to the author that Anthony West, who so far as I know has no particular knowledge of Fuentes' material, comprehends so well what this vigorous author is saying. Putting aside the temptation to argue with opinions already expressed, I shall give one view of the novel. It is the story of life in Mexico City, all social classes, all kinds of people. Fuentes has a wonderful ability to re-create the feeling of a city—he has done it in other places—and this feeling is one of the basic values of the novel. The reader feels adequately placed. The central character in the narrative is Fernando Robles, an old Revolutionary, now a financial tycoon whose affairs have become so complicated that even making money has no point to it except to make more money. Robles cannot extricate himself from this meaningless web of obligations except by throwing over the whole business and returning to the most primitive way of life open to him. Through this story move businessmen, poets, philosophers, actresses, servants, prostitutes, laborers, film directors, mistresses, opportunists, aristocrats, nouveaux riches, the whole gamut of society. The story deals with the events leading to Robles' ruin. Anthony West describes the narrative technique as\" a rapid, cinematic movement that cuts nervously from one character to another every time a new life intersects a strand in the cable of Robles' affairs. The focus of attention moves from within one character to give an exterior view of the point of intersection in a brilliantly written narrative passage, and then moves inside the mind of the new character.\"While Robles is the central figure of this action, he is not really the center of the author's attention. The character of Robles is seen through the effect he has on others, and Fuentes intends to direct the reader's attention to the others as well as to Robles. The world in which Fernando Robles moves is a representation of the Revolution betrayed. It may be interpreted as a condemnation of capitalism in Mexico. But it seems to me to be even more susceptible 20\n\nThe New Yorker, 4 March 1961, pp. 123-125.\n\n38\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nto another interpretation: that power runs contrary to human concern. Far worse than Robles himself are the inadequates and opportunists who attach themselves to his power. Robles had at least been a man at one time. Some of his satellites have never known the adventure of being human. As pathetic as these revolting people are, they are hardly more so than the humble people who, on a different level, are equally lost in modern society. For both groups, the values held are not those required for authentic living. Objectively, we can observe that Fuentes describes people who do indeed live in Mexico. Their vulgar senselessness, their inhumanity are brilliantly apparent. But it is also true that people like these are present in any large urban situation. And if the Revolution is what gave them to Mexico, it means only that the Revolution made Mexico resemble a large part of the rest of the world. To have done anything else, the Revolution would have had to change men, not institutions.21 Moving in and out through the action of the novel is Fuentes' major mistake, a shadowy character named Ixca Cienfuegos. It is a good thing that Fuentes was bold enough to write a novel of such heroic proportions, otherwise Ixca Cienfuegos would have destroyed it. As well as I can determine, the enigmatic Ixca is intended to be the conjunction of cultures or the indigenous spirit, or something similar. The trouble is that he is neither man nor myth, and his presence refuses to make sense because he persists in being one when he would more reasonably be the other. Perhaps Fuentes meant him to be this way. I have wondered if Ixca's meddling in the affairs of the characters of the novel could be the author's way of showing the indigenist influence in Mexican culture. But it all could have worked out the same way without him. It appears that Fuentes would like to give Ixca an importance that is not justified in the novel. A combination of memory and present circumstance is the basis of Fuentes' portrayal of Mexican reality. The proportions vary according to the specific situation. In spite of the youthful impetuosity apparent in some parts of this novel, it is carefully worked out. Readers of the English translation should be warned that the second-rate, 21\n\nAn observation to this effect was made by Mariano Azuela in connection with his disenchantment concerning the Revolution. Cien años de novela mexicana, p. 222.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n39\n\nneo-Naturalist prose of the English version belongs to the translator, not to Fuentes. Perhaps the most general criticism of La región más transparente is that the author attempted to do too much. His second novel, Las buenas conciencias ( 1960 ), indicates that he gave consideration to the criticism, because it is a much less ambitious book. Fuentes studies the provincial background of one of the characters mentioned rather casually in the first novel. The setting is less hermetic than the town in Al filo del agua, but it has some of the same qualities. The author has to examine the customs, many of them religious or semireligious, which control the pattern of life. This culture has been subjected to only a small amount of the antitraditional tendencies that constitute pressures in cosmopolitan Mexico City. Fuentes writes about it with less assurance than in the earlier novel, and I think Las buenas consciencias has to be regarded as a minor work. In 1962 Fuentes published two other novels, one major and one minor. The lesser of the two, Aura, is a short novel in which the author allows himself to enjoy his taste for fantasy. A young man answers an advertisement for someone who knows French, and finds himself in a ghostly old house whose owner is an elegant lady of years long past. This withered belle also appears as a beautiful young woman with whom the protagonist falls in love. Fuentes doesn't tell his reader the secret of the dual woman; but he doesn't fool anybody because the whole atmosphere of the story informs the reader from the beginning that he has already heard or read it in several different versions. Fuentes tells the story well, narrating in the second person singular, a technique he probably learned from his French contemporary Michel Butor. The viewpoint is effective for a while, but I find myself taking the\" y o u \"personally rather than impersonally, and consequently rebelling. Salvador Reyes Nevares recently observed that the atmosphere of Aura—the persistence of a worn out past: musty old houses, antique furniture, and elderly people that are semi-ghosts—is a recurrent preoccupation in the works of Fuentes. Reyes Nevares understands this atmosphere as a representation of the reactionary element in society— an element which is repulsive because it insists on surviving although it is really dead. The idea is interesting, and may well be valid. The\n\n40\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nsocial criticism that Reyes Nevares sees in Aura gives the novel a reasonable place in the trajectory of Fuentes' work.22 There is certainly no doubt that Fuentes reproduces the same atmosphere many times. I have assumed—perhaps too innocently—that it is no more than a neo-Romantic obsession. Whatever the interpretation, Fuentes has already used it too much. La muerte de Artemio Cruz is an altogether different proposition. In my opinion, it is Fuentes' best novel to date, though it has not been praised as highly as La región más transparente. Artemio Cruz is another Fernando Robles, but here the spotlight is on him rather than on the people about him. The reader is introduced to him when he is on his death bed, and through changing narrative viewpoints which use all three persons, is told what Cruz's thoughts are at the moment, what his external situation is, and what his life has been. The last is revealed through a pattern of flashbacks that recede in time until the heart of the matter is finally revealed. He spent his early years in a situation that frustrated almost every act that would have given meaning to life. The opportunism of his later life was originally self-preservation, and he has cast aside every possibility that might have made his death significant in terms of what had gone before. Now, at the point of death, isolated from those who should be related to him, he is in no way prepared to accept death which has no more meaning than life. A great deal of Mexico is seen as Artemio Cruz moves through it. The scene is not as panoramic as in La región más transparente, but the novel gains through its tightness. Comparing the two novels is something like comparing a sonnet and a long lyric poem. The changing narrative viewpoint is extremely effective, providing a clarity that could not have been accomplished any other way. I doubt that there is anywhere in fiction a character whose wholeness is more apparent than in the case of Artemio Cruz. The ideology of the novel is somewhat disturbing. It is much the same as in La región más transparente, but without the apparent insistence on the indigenist influence. I assume that the life and char22\n\nSalvador Reyes Nevares,\"Una obra maestra,\"La Cultura en México, no. 127, supplement to Siempre (22 julio 1964), 19.\n\nThe Novel of Time and Being\n\n41\n\nacter of Artemio Cruz are the author's representation of Mexican reality. It is not that Fuentes has created a gigantic symbol, for Cruz is every inch an authentic, flesh-and-blood character; but it does seem that the life of Cruz can be understood as one way of looking at the attitudes of the nation and why they are as they are. If my assumption is correct, Fuentes sees Mexico as having deceived herself by accepting values that will not allow her to realize her potential. Foremost among the false values of Cruz is the accumulation of wealth and power. And here again is the possible condemnation of capitalism that is also apparent in La región más transparente. It is not surprising that Fuentes should express such a position in his novels, since his leftist position is amply apparent in his political essays. However, his novels do not make clear whether the accumulation of wealth and power is an economic disadvantage or a cultural error. Much of his displeasure is directed against the influence and imitation of the United States. His belief is that Mexico should take account of herself and maintain her independence. Fuentes' novels indicate that many Mexicans of all social classes will have to develop more faith in their country's present and future if this independence is to become reality. Fuentes' two great novels show the Revolution's inherent dynamism and also its loss or acquisition of various characteristics through the years that followed the military phase. Even if we disagree with his understanding of the Revolution, we can hardly doubt that the broad conception of these works is one of their greatest values. In 1958, the year when La región más transparente was published, Miguel N. Lira published Mientras la muerte llega, another retrospective view of the Revolution. Lira's is a good novel, but its relatively limited view is unsatisfactory when it is compared with Fuentes' panorama. Carballido's El norte is an example of a strong tendency to examine the human dilemma without particular attention to the Mexican scene, though the writers who take this road certainly are not avoiding Mexico. It is simply a question of whether the Mexican problem or the human problem constitutes the basis of the author's search. One is as authentically Mexican and as authentically human as the other. The novels refer to a contemporary human condition that is often called\n\n\"solitude\"\n\n42\n\nMexico in Its Novel\n\nof self-realization. It is difficult for the individual to untangle the complications of society so he can see what he really is, what his relationships with others ought to be, and what he can become. The path to this self-realization is blocked by numerous tyrannies that man imposes upon himself. His need to overcome them, for the sake of the individual and for the sake of the nation, was made apparent in Al filo del agua, and this same need has become increasingly a preoccupation of the novel. The attempt to understand, to see more clearly, has led to different methods of isolating a segment of human experience so its nature may be accurately observed. In El norte, Carballido used only three characters. In 1956 (this is the title of the novel published in 1958), Carmen Rosenzweig examines the year of the slow death of the narrator's father. In El solitario Atlántico, Jorge López Páez goes back to childhood, as Rosario Castellanos had done in Balúm Canán, to establish a beachhead on reality. Josefina "
