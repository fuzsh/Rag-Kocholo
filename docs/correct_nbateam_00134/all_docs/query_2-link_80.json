He'd be a selfish douchebag if he was a trucker, if he worked on a farm, or if he was in the NBA.\n\nI do approve of what the Jazz did. For whatever struggles that franchise had, at least they didn't get held hostage like the Melo in Denver and Howard in Orlando situations. They just told the guy to go pack his trash and leave as soon as Sloan decided he'd rather fish than deal with Deron Williams.\n\nThink about that indictment. Sloan did something he loved forever, then decided it was easier to stop loving it than deal with Deron Williams. Is there a bigger open judgement call on a person made ever in pro sports? That's quite the mantle - that you are the kind of douchebag that saps every bit of love out of the game itself wherever you go."
