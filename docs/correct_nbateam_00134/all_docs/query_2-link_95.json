        "text": "Deron Williams spoke about Kyrie Irving in a recent interview. The former All-Star called Irving the most skilled player he had ever seen and said that Irving was capable of doing things on the court that other players just couldn't do. Williams was full of praise for Irving, who now plays for the Mavericks, just like he did in the past.\n\n\"Kyrie is the most skilled player I’ve ever seen, as far as just pure skill. There’s nothing on the offensive end that he can’t do... He's posting up dudes (who are) 6'6, 6'7. He's hitting runners with his left hand for game. The dude is just skilled. I've never seen anybody dribble the ball like him. He’s a wizard with the basketball.”\n\nDeron Williams has played with Kyrie Irving before on the Cavaliers, serving as his backup during the Cavs' 2017 run to the NBA Finals. Williams, a former All-Star, has also gotten the chance to play with several NBA legends, so his effusive praise for Kyrie Irving really does mean a lot.\n\nIrving joined the Mavericks in 2022 after he demanded a trade to end his controversial stint with the Nets. While the Mavs missed the playoffs after his arrival, last season saw a great improvement in their fortunes, as they reached the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011.\n\nLast season, Irving averaged 25.6 points, 5.2 assists, and 5.0 rebounds, as he and Luka Doncic led the Mavericks to the fifth seed in the Western Conference. They defeated the Clippers, Thunder, and Timberwolves to reach the NBA Finals, but couldn't overcome the Celtics to win the NBA championship.\n\nKyrie Irving Believes The Mavericks Can Win It All\n\nKyrie Irving spoke in the immediate aftermath of the Mavericks' loss to the Celtics in the NBA Finals. He noted how proud he was of the entire team and franchise, and expressed his belief that he and his team would be competing at the highest level next season for a championship and that this wouldn't be the last anyone sees of them.\n\n\"Very confident [in the team's future]. That's one positive that we can take from this series, just how far we made it and how proud I am of the guys. We answered a lot of questions this year on what we're capable of doing. Now it's just about being consistent. I think, probably in the last week, I said that I wanted [us] to be remembered as one of the best teams of this era.\"\n\n\"The last few champions have been new ones, each and every year. I see an opportunity for us to really build our future in a positive manner where this is almost like a regular thing for us and we're competing for championships.\"\n\nIrving and the Mavericks have made some big steps in improving their roster, as they added four-time NBA champion Klay Thompson, after he left the Golden State Warriors. Thompson will improve the Mavericks' offense, especially their three-point shooting, significantly with his catch-and-shoot prowess.\n\nThe Mavericks might have a chance to win the Western Conference once again next year, as they are perhaps the team among the favorites in the conference who have improved the most in free agency. If they return to the NBA Finals, Luka and Kyrie must deliver better performances than they did against the Celtics."
