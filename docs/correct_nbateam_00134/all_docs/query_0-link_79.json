        "text": "Jazz fans and Utah writers like to say their team has netted Derrick Favors, Marvin Williams, Enes Kanter and Trey Burke from the Deron Williams trade, although there should be asterisks next to Marviin Williams and Trey Burke's names. Marvin was traded for Devin Harris and Trey Burke was the result of a Draft Night deal in which the last pick from the D-Will trade was paired up with the Jazz own pick to move up. (Gorgui Dieng was taken with the pick the Nets traded.)\n\nStill, Kurt Kragthorpe of the Salt Lake Tribune writes Sunday as impressive as that haul was for Kevin O'Connor, \"the Jazz haven't won the trade.\" He argues, \"While the Jazz continue to rebuild themselves and keep saying that all these assets they’ve gathered in the two-plus years since the D-Will deal eventually will work for them, the Nets are making it happen right now.\"\n\nIt's another paean to Mikhail Prokhorov's spending --and desire to win. Kraghthorpe says that will to win is what attracted longtime Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko to sign with the Nets, not some mythical side deal hatched in the shadow of the Kremlin.\n\n\"I’m saying a guy who has earned $100 million in the NBA can afford to cut back his salary to pursue a championship,\" Kragthorpe writes. His counterpart at the Deseret News, Doug Robinson, also writes about the Deron Williams deal, noting how the deal's secrecy is typical of the way the Jazz work."
