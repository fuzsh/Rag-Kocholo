        "text": "Steph Curry is the face of the Golden State Warriors franchise. He is the best shooter the NBA has ever seen. He is a four-time champion. And, even at age-36, he’s among the best players in the NBA. As such, his position in the league’s history, and where he ranks among the all-time greats, is often discussed during the offseason.\n\nDuring a recent episode of “No Media,” former NBA guard Deron Williams debated where Curry stacked up against the greatest players in league history. Williams spent 12 seasons in the NBA and faced off against Curry on multiple occasions, so he is speaking from experience.\n\nCurry will be entering his 16th season with the Warriors later this year. He is still capable of helping them win another championship in the coming seasons. If he wins a fifth ring before he retires, the debate around where he ranks all time will undoubtedly reach fever pitch.\n\nYou can hear Williams full thoughts on Curry’s status among the all-time greats by clicking on the embedded video above."
