        "text": "When turning the clock back to the 2010-11 NBA season, former Utah Jazz F Derrick Favors had an unorthodox start to his career. After being a key piece in the blockbuster trade to send All-Star G Deron Williams to the New Jersey Nets, it shipped him off from the franchise that drafted him just 56 games into play.\n\nIt’s not a scenario you see super often in the NBA. A franchise sending off a newly drafted rookie less than a year into his tenure with the team, let alone a top-three selection, is virtually unheard of. That’s what makes Favors’ case so intriguing.\n\nHoopsHype’s Michael Scotto spoke with Favors about his turbulent time with the Nets, and how he saw the deal to send him to Utah develop:\n\n\"I was 19 at the time. The funny thing about that is as soon as I got drafted around training camp and preseason time, that was the Carmelo Anthony trade talks where New Jersey wanted Carmelo. I had to deal with those trade rumors up to February. Once Melo got traded to the Knicks, I relaxed because I thought maybe my name wouldn’t be in more trade rumors. Then the Deron Williams trade happens with Utah the next day or two. I found out when I think I was told to go home by the assistant GM right after the All-Star break. I didn’t know what was going on, and I don’t think anybody knew. Then, it just happened right there on ESPN.\"\n\nThe deal ended up working pretty successfully for Favors, as he eventually would spend 10 of his 12 seasons in the NBA with the Jazz. Throughout his time with Utah, he posted averages of 11.4 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 1.1 assists through 644 games.\n\nToday, Favors anticipates an opportunity in the G-League before the 2023-24 season with hopes of a potential NBA return in the near future.\n\nFollow Inside The Jazz on Facebook and X."
