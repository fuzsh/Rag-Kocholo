        "text": "All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving has been called a lot of things during his stint in the NBA, both good and bad. For former Utah Jazz star Deron Williams, though, the Dallas Mavericks guard is a wizard with the basketball.\n\nAfter a standout high school career, Irving played one season of college basketball at Duke University. He was then selected 1st overall in the 2011 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year following his debut season.\n\nOver the course of his professional career, Irving has been selected to 8 NBA All-Star teams, won the 2014 NBA All-Star Game MVP award, and been named to the All-NBA Third Team on two occasions. In 2016, he won an NBA championship with the Cavaliers.\n\nIn his second year playing for the Mavs, Irving somehow redeemed his reputation by helping the Luka Doncic-led team go deep in the playoffs. While other teams were heavily favored to defeat them, such as Anthony Edwards’ Minnesota Timberwolves, Nikola Jokic’s Denver Nuggets, or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s Oklahoma City Thunder, Dallas still managed to reach the NBA Finals. However, the duo of Irving and Doncic came short against Jayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics.\n\nFormer NBA Point Guard Deron Williams Says Dallas Mavericks Star Kyrie Irving Is a Wizard With the Basketball\n\nFor as long as anyone can remember, Irving has been a human highlight machine whenever the ball is in his hands. In a video shared by PlayersTV’s official account on X, former NBA star Deron William attested to this claim and called the Mavericks star a wizard with the basketball.\n\nDuring the last regular season, Irving proved his doubters wrong by averaging 25.6 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 5.2 assists. He continued his production on the court by notching 22.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 5.1 assists to help Dallas reach the NBA Finals.\n\nWith the addition of Klay Thompson, everyone will be looking forward to how Irving will play with him and Slovenian star Luka Doncic. If his performance last season is any indication, Dallas fans won’t be disappointed at all.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
