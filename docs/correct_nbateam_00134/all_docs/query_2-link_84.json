        "text": "Ever since Deron Williams was acquired by the Nets a little more than three years ago, plucked out of Utah by general manager Billy King in the wake of his failed pursuit of Carmelo Anthony, the Nets have done everything in their power to make the point guard happy, comfortable and successful.\n\nThe Nets first chased Dwight Howard, then traded for Joe Johnson to play alongside Williams. They fired Avery Johnson and hired Williams’ childhood idol, Jason Kidd, to coach him, and then traded away several draft picks and massively inflated their payroll to bring Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce to Brooklyn to help Williams push this team into title contention.\n\nBut now, after all of those moves, the Nets find themselves on the verge of a first-round playoff exit for a second straight season. This time, though, there’s no question who will be blamed, if the Nets are once again sent home by a team they were widely expected to beat.\n\nThe answer, of course, is Williams, who has more on the line than anyone on either team when the Nets and Raptors square off in Game 6 Friday night at Barclays Center, where a loss would mean Brooklyn would see its season end at home for a second consecutive season.\n\n“We just have to play with a sense of urgency,” Williams said after Game 5. “We have to now. If we lose, we’re done.”\n\nThe Nets find themselves in this position mainly because Williams hasn’t been the player the Nets expected to be getting when they signed him to a five-year, $98 million contract in July 2012. Williams hasn’t been the kind of game-changing player he was in Utah while he and Chris Paul were battling to be considered the NBA’s top point guard.\n\nThose days seem like a distant memory because Williams is not only nowhere near the best point guard, but he’s clearly the second- best point guard in this series.\n\nKyle Lowry — who the Raptors were ready to move for a first-round pick if they could get one for him earlier this season — has been sensational this series. He has dominated his individual matchup with Williams,through the first five games, including his virtuoso 36-point performance in Game 5.\n\n“I thought Deron was good [in Game 5],” Kidd said on a conference call Thursday. “I thought he was attacking, he was making plays for other guys and he helped us get back in the game.”\n\nThat could be a winning argument if you only watched the fourth quarter of Wednesday’s 115-113 loss, when Williams had 10 points and five assists as the Nets nearly dug out of a 22-point deficit to begin the final period, only to come up short.\n\nBut that would be ignoring the first three quarters, when Williams had just three points, four assists and three turnovers and was largely a non-factor.\n\nThat inconsistent effort simply isn’t good enough for the Nets, who need Williams to be a franchise player in order to win the final two games of this series and advance to face the two-time defending champion Heat — let alone making a serious run for an NBA title.\n\nThe Nets unquestionably had championship aspirations entering this season after King put together a roster costing owner Mikhail Prokhorov over $190 million, after sending several draft picks to Boston to bring Garnett and Pierce on board to help show Williams what it takes to lead a team to a championship.\n\nInstead, the Nets find themselves on the brink of elimination, and make no mistake — if the Nets lose one of the next two games, Williams will receive the lion’s share of the blame. And if a $190 million roster can’t get out of the first round, it’s hard to believe there won’t be significant changes coming before this team returns to the court next season. Even the possibility of Williams being traded is likely to come up, particularly with the Nets facing another massive wage bill again next season.\n\nNow Williams finds himself at the defining moment of his time with the Nets, and, arguably, of his NBA career. All the moves the Nets have made over the past three years have been done with the expectation Williams still can perform like the player he was in Utah, the player who was on a pair of gold medal winning Olympic teams and one capable of leading a team deep into the postseason.\n\nNow Williams and the Nets enter the biggest game of their season, the biggest of their time together, with the spotlight squarely upon him.\n\nEverything the Nets did the last three years was done to put Williams in position to lead the Nets through this type of situation."
