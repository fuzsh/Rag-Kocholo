        "text": "Former NBA star Deron Williams was a true point guard. He could handle the ball, score, pass, and defend at a high level. He was a 1-guard you wanted on your team, and he had plenty of success in the Association while racking up nearly $160 million in career earnings, to the point that Williams vs. Chris Paul was a popular positional debate during his peak years.\n\nBut Williams hasn’t played in the NBA since a 24-game stint for the Cleveland Cavaliers closed his 2016-17 campaign. What’s he been up to since?\n\nA standout career at Illinois\n\nDeron Williams played his college basketball at the University of Illinois.\n\nDuring his junior year, he had a breakout season for the Illini, leading them to the NCAA Championship Game in 2005 before they suffered their first loss of the season at the hands of the North Carolina Tar Heels.\n\nHe was named a consensus second-team All-American and the University of Illinois Athlete of the Year. Williams was also a finalist for the Wooden Award, which is awarded annually to the best player in college basketball.\n\nAfter his junior year at Illinois, Williams decided to enter the NBA draft.\n\nDeron Williams’ career in the NBA\n\nThe Utah Jazz selected Deron Williams with the No. 3 pick of the 2005 NBA Draft. In his first year calling Salt Lake City home, he averaged 10.8 points and 4.5 assists in 80 games. He was named to the All-Rookie First Team and had begun establishing himself as a premier point guard at the sport’s highest level.\n\nWilliams spent six seasons with the Jazz and played on some successful teams, making four trips to the playoffs. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team twice and made the All-Star squad twice with the Jazz.\n\nAfter his Utah tenure, he was infamously traded to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Favors, Devin Harris, cash, a 2011 first-round pick (used on Enes Kanter), and a 2013 first-round pick (Gorgui Dieng). He spent five seasons with the Nets and then finished his NBA career with the Dallas Mavericks and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nWilliams’ NBA days ended with 845 games played and career averages of 16.3 points, 8.1 assists, and 3.1 rebounds. The three-time NBA All-Star had a reputation as one of the most physical point guards in the league, and he made the most of a killer crossover that allowed him to get a step on most defenders. He could also post up opponents on the block and rarely backed down from any individual challenge.\n\nWilliams also played with Team USA in 2008 and 2012 and won two gold medals.\n\nDeron Williams after the NBA\n\nFollowing the end of his NBA career, Deron Williams pursued fame in a different sport.\n\nEven while in the Association, the point guard was a fan of combat sports and spent years training in mixed martial arts and boxing. He also owns a stake in Fortis MMA, a martial arts club in Dallas, Texas.\n\nWilliams made his boxing debut with an exhibition fight on the undercard of the Jake Paul vs. Tommy Fury headliner on Dec. 18, 2021. He fought against former NFL running back Frank Gore and won via a split decision.\n\n“I’m going to sit my old dumb a** down somewhere and let the pros do their s***,” Williams said after the bout, announcing his retirement from boxing, per Mirror. “I probably looked terrible out there. I felt my last five sparring sessions were on point, but once you get in there and you get touched, your training goes out the window. I’m glad I did this, but like I said before, I’m one and done.”"
