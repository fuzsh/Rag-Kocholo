        "text": "Misko Raznatovic, Europe’s leading basketball agent who represents Nikola Jokic, shared a story of how he helped three-time NBA All-Star Deron Williams to make a transfer to Besiktas Istanbul during the NBA lockout in 2011. All it took were 15 games for Williams to have his No. 8 jersey retired by Besiktas after averaging 21.8 points and 6.5 assists during his stay in Istanbul, which came to an end with the NBA lockout settled. “This is a very crazy story. At that time, I did not follow NBA basketball. Really, I did not,” Raznatovic started, via the EXTRA SMOKE podcast, co-hosted by Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. “I had no players [in the NBA], games at three o’clock in the morning, I cannot.\n\n“I know that my partner Jeff Schwartz has Jason Kidd. I told him about Jason Kidd, and the coach was excited. I called Jeff and said, ‘Give me him.’ He said, ‘No, he [Jason] is not interested. He is older. But take Deron Williams.’ “I have to say I have never heard of Deron Williams,” Raznatovic continued. “I closed the phone and said like, ‘I am asking him for Lamborghini, he is offering me Ford.’ But okay, let’s check this guy. I take a look at his profile, wow. 25 points per game, multiple All-Star. I call coach, ‘Hey, Jason Kidd said no, but I have another one.’ A reaction was not so good but three minutes later, his reaction was a copy-paste of my reaction. I was like, ‘Let’s bring him.’ “So, we brought the guy. I met him in Istanbul, a great guy. Even though he stayed for only two months, he left there a lot, grew everything up here. At the end of the day, they [Besiktas] won the Turkish championship. Nobody ever expected that before the season.”"
