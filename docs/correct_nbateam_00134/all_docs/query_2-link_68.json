        "text": "Deron Williams was a very skilled player back in his day, but he believes that there is a better player than him in that regard.\n\nDeron Williams spoke about Kyrie Irving in a recent interview. The former All-Star called Irving the most skilled player he had ever seen and said that Irving was capable of doing things on the court that other players just couldn’t do. Williams was full of praise for Irving, who now plays for the Mavericks, just like he did in the past.\n\n“Kyrie is the most skilled player I’ve ever seen, as far as just pure skill. There’s nothing on the offensive end that he can’t do… He’s posting up dudes (who are) 6’6, 6’7. He’s hitting runners with his left hand for game. The dude is just skilled. I’ve never seen anybody dribble the ball like him. He’s a wizard with the basketball.”\n\nDeron Williams has played with Kyrie Irving before on the Cavaliers, serving as his backup during the Cavs’ 2017 run to the NBA Finals. Williams, a former All-Star, has also gotten the chance to play with several NBA legends, so his effusive praise for Kyrie Irving weighs a lot.\n\nIrving joined the Mavericks in 2022 after he demanded a trade to end his controversial stint with the Nets. While the Mavs missed the playoffs after his arrival, last season saw a great improvement in their fortunes, as they reached the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011."
