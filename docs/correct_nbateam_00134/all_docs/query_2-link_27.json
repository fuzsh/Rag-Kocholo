        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nOwns one of the most devastating crossovers in the game and uses his thick frame to power through the lane. Has a sweet perimeter shot with nice arc. A great overall package of talent at point guard, with top-tier skills, quickness, hands, and court vision. Doesn't always bring his A-game. Coachability, leadership, and maturity have been questioned. Sometimes forces the action, contributing to high turnover totals. Despite his physicality and athleticism he's not much of a defensive ace or rebounder."
