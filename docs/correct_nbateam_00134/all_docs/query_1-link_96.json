        "text": "NEW YORK (WFAN/AP) -- Better than 'Melo?\n\nAfter whiffing on Carmelo Anthony for the third time, the Nets made a big splash Wednesday by landing Utah Jazz star Deron Williams in a three-team deal.\n\n\"We are very excited to add a player the caliber of Deron Williams to our roster,\" Nets general manager Billy King said in a statement.\n\nLISTEN: Nets general manager Billy King with Joe & Evan\n\nThe Nets will send Devin Harris, Derrick Favors and two first-round draft picks to Utah for Williams.\n\nAs part of the deal, the Golden State Warriors will send Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric to the Nets in exchange for Troy Murphy.\n\nThe trade was a stunner on the day before the NBA's trading deadline. Williams was expecting to play with the Mavericks in his hometown of Dallas when the deal was agreed to.\n\n\"Utah traded DWill??\" Chris Paul wrote on his Twitter page, adding hashtags with \"EpicFail\" and \"notagoodlook.\"\n\nRELATED: Nets Call Off Practice After Missing Out On Anthony\n\nHarris, a former All-Star point guard, and Favors, the No. 3 pick in the draft, were part of the package the Nets were offering the Nuggets all season for Anthony. While they couldn't get Denver's All-Star forward, Wednesday's trade stole some of the spotlight from the rival Knicks on the night Anthony arrives at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe Jazz were a perennial contender with Williams, but his reputation took a hit in Utah when Hall of Fame coach Jerry Sloan retired the day after a clash with him during a game.\n\nRELATED: It's Official: Carmelo Anthony Era Begins For Knicks | Carnegie's Introduces Enormous Carmelo Anthony Sandwich | Want A No. 7 Carmelo Jersey? Better Act Fast | On WFAN: Knicks' D'Antoni Breaks Down Carmelo Trade\n\nWilliams was expected to be one of the headliners of the 2012 free agent class along with 2008 Olympic teammates Dwight Howard and Chris Paul, and the small-market Jazz could have faced losing him for nothing.\n\nThe Nets now hope Williams will sign a contract extension with them, which they can offer this summer. If so, he would become the face of their franchise when they move into their new arena in Brooklyn for the 2012-13 season.\n\nLISTEN: WFAN's Marc Malusis and The Bergen Record's Al Iannazzone break down Nets-Deron trade\n\nNew Jersey has been desperate to make its first score under new Russian owner Mikhail Prokhorov. The Nets talked with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh last summer and when that failed they turned their attention to Anthony. They quickly bounced back from the disappointment of missing out on him with Williams, who is averaging 21.3 points and 9.7 assists.\n\nWilliams joins the exodus of top West players heading East, following Amare Stoudemire's move from Phoenix to New York and Anthony's deal to the Knicks. The Jazz are only a half-game ahead of Memphis for the final playoff spot in the West and will have to try to hold on without their best player.\n\nNets fans: Who would you rather have, Deron Williams or Carmelo Anthony? Sound off in the comments below!\n\nStatement From The Nets:\n\nThe New Jersey Nets have acquired two-time All-Star guard Deron Williams from the Utah Jazz in exchange for guard Devin Harris, forward Derrick Favors, two first round draft picks (Nets 2011, Golden State 2012) and cash considerations, Nets General Manager Billy King announced today.\n\n\"We are very excited to add a player the caliber of Deron Williams to our roster,\" said King. \"He is one of the premier point guards in the NBA, and his skill and talent level will bolster our franchise as we continue to build towards our goal of becoming a championship-caliber team.\"\n\nWilliams, 6'3\", 209, was selected third overall in the first round of the 2005 NBA Draft by Utah.
