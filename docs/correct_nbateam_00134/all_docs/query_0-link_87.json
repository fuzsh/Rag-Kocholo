        "text": "As I watch these 2018 playoffs, like many I am ecstatic to see this new exciting generation of Utah Jazz basketball, lead by Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. One is a game changing defensive anchor and the other is a special player that this franchise has never seen, and by far the most dynamic player in to see in a Jazz uniform. As they are surprising teams in the playoffs, I can’t help but reflect on a generation of the Jazz franchise that we tend to overlook with all this new excitement. When you think of the Utah Jazz history it is always the glory years with Stockton and Malone, led by the one and only Jerry Sloan. There is a gap from those days to now that should not be ignored.\n\nAll great franchise runs come to an end and when Stockton and Malone took the Jazz to the finals back-to-back, Jazz fans knew that the future was unclear. Jerry Sloan had lead his team to 20 straight playoffs and missed just a few years when the team struggled, but the hall of fame coach knew he still had something left for one last run. They put together a few great teams that don’t get the credit they deserve. Headed by a new duo, Carlos Boozer and Deron Williams, these two players anchored a team that was not only revitalizing for the franchise but gave fans something to get excited about. They had great teammates like; Memo Okur, Kyle Korver, CJ Miles, Wes Matthews, Paul Millsap and Derek Fisher that competed each night and gave the franchise hope. From 2006 to 2010 D Will and Boozer lead the Jazz to the playoffs with these core guys. During that period; they made it to the first round, second round twice, and one appearance to the conference finals. All four years they were eliminated by just two teams; Kobe Bryant and the Lakers, and the Big Three with the Spurs. Much like the current times with the Warriors and Cavs those were the teams nobody could pass.\n\nThere are two personal off court moments that are examples of how these two guys shaped and lead this team in ways that weren’t basketball related. First was with Carlos Boozer. Hands down one of not only the best NBA guys I have ever met, but just an overall genuine person. During his years with the Jazz he was All-NBA, a two-time NBA All-Star and Olympic Gold Medal winner. Countless times I have seen him meet people and greet them by shaking their hand with a smile and introducing himself, “Hi, I am Carlos Boozer.” As if you didn’t know who he was when he walked in the room at 6’9”. He treated every person like a normal human and wanted you to treat him that way as well. I would like to say he became a close friend of mine and it all started his second year with the Jazz. I was a timid ball boy and one day I walked into the locker room with my head down, hoping not to bother the players. As I go past the locker room I hear Boozer yell, “Colt, what’s up man! How come you can’t say hi when you come in?” From that day on I always felt welcome and as if I was part of the team. He helped create that atmosphere for everyone in the locker room and that’s the type of leader he was. It wasn’t just me but with every ball boy, video staff member, PR personnel or anyone who was frequently around felt like they were about of something. I was lucky enough to help Carlos with two of his youth summer league basketball camps in Salt Lake and Juneau, Alaska. I was able to see how he transitioned that same family environment outside the locker room and how much he care for both his communities and his roots.\n\nThe second moment was with D Will. He was a top 3 draft pick and came into the league ready to make a statement. His time with the Jazz he was a two time All-Star, two time all-NBA and an Olympic Gold Medal winner. Now, he has a different approach to his personal relationships. He likes to test people and is great at reading everyone in the room. I had worked around NBA players for a few years when he was drafted and realized they are people just like us. During summer league his rookie year he proved he was the man in the locker room. He was messing around after practice and shot something into the trash. He missed and he looked at me and told me to pick it up for him. “No”, I said. Basically, letting him know I wasn’t going to be his bitch. He stood up and looked at me and said, “I don’t like you, I like the other team attendants, but I don’t like you.” So, I told him I didn’t like him either in front of a few players and training staff. Everyone in the room paused for a minute, then immediately started laughing, and from that day on we were cool with each other. He was just testing me, Deron is a smart ass and always liked to mess with people. He pushed the team when they needed it but also was a leader that brought everyone together as a family. He lead young guys like CJ Miles, Wes Matthews, Ronnie Price, Dee Brown and Ronnie Brewer but also had mutual respect from the vets like Memo Okur, Kirilenko and Boozer. After practice it was common to see Williams leading the players in shooting competitions against one another for an hour, followed by bull shitting in the locker room, just like you would see High School friends. The team was built with players with high character and knew they all had the same goal to go out and compete against anyone. One of the best examples of Deron bringing the team together is when he started his dodge ball tournament during the off season. This not only brought the community together, but regular fans were able to face off against D Will, Korver, Ronnie Price, and none other than myself in a ‘friendly’ game of dodgeball.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010 these two guys gave the city hope and excitement again. They went to the playoffs each year surprising every opponent they faced. In 2007 the Jazz surged to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since Jordan broke all our hearts. Nobody expected them to get past the first round facing the Rockets with Mcgrady and Yao. During these playoffs years it was all lead by Deron Williams who averaged 21 points and 9.5 assist and Carlos Boozer with 20 points and 9 rebounds throughout their post-season career with the Jazz. Those are some ridiculous numbers that cannot be over looked. They had help from guys like Memo Okur, stretching the court with his 3-point shot. AK47, a freak athlete who would feel the stat sheet up every night, and Matt Harpring who was out there with the old school mentality of the 1990’s NBA. Then you had the veteran experience and leadership of Derek Fisher that made a career of big moments. The team continued to make a push throughout the years. They brought in guys like a fan favorite, Kyle Korver, bombing threes like he has done his whole career. Younger guys like Millsap and Miles helped bring depth to the team and developed great careers overall, stemming from the mentality that they learned during their time with the Jazz. Overall, they had a great run and couldn’t get over the hump like many of the teams Jazz fans have seen.\n\nI see this young Jazz team now in the playoffs and it reminds me of those years and although nobody ever expects the Jazz to be a real threat, but this team has some new very rare talent that could be what helps get this franchise what is has deserved. The players all seem to get along and support each others roles, regardless of who is in the limelight. The motto, “the strength of the team, is the team” is what you see every night and that was the same feeling I got when I was around those earlier teams. They all knew how important their roles were and trust one another to do their job. Now living in Chicago, I am still the same fan I was working for the team. Hopefully this young core can give us something we haven’t ever had, but if not I will always be a Jazz fan."
