        "text": "DERON Williams is a former NBA star who has transitioned from the hardwood to the boxing ring.\n\nThe 39-year-old ex-member of the iconic USA men's basketball \"Redeem Team\" for the 2008 Olympics stepped away from the game and walked straight into the ring.\n\nWilliams spent 12 seasons in the NBA and playing for four teams.\n\nThe West Virginia-born guard was a multi-sport standout athlete growing up in Texas.\n\nHe won two state wrestling championships in elementary and was a four-star recruit in high school for basketball.\n\nHe attended the University of Illinois and played under the legendary coach Bill Self before another notable college coach, Bruce Weber, took over in Williams's sophomore season.\n\nWilliams spent three seasons with the program and was crucial to Illinois reaching the 2005 National championship, where they lost to North Carolina.\n\nHe would forego his senior season and was selected by the Utah Jazz in the 2005 NBA draft with the No.3 pick.\n\nHe would go on to play for the Jazz, New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets, Dallas Mavericks, and the Clevland Cavaliers.\n\nWillaims was a three-time NBA All-Star, two-time All-NBA, and most notably, a \"Redeem team\" member.\n\nThat squad featured Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony.\n\nWilliams retired from the NBA in 2017 and got more involved in the MMA gym he bought back in 2015 — and describes himself as a combat sports fanatic.\n\n\"Combat sports have been a part of my life since my youngest days.\n\n\"Before I was a basketball player, I was a wrestler.\n\n\"Since 2015, I have had the privilege of owning an MMA gym, and through that, I have trained in various martial arts to stay active,\" Williams told BBCSports.\n\nThe former NBA star took his first professional fight against ex-NFL legend Frank Gore in December of 2021.\n\nHe won by split decision over the former NFL running back.\n\nWilliams hasn't fought since his 2021 bout with Gore and hinted that it might be the only time we see him in the ring after the fight.\n\n\"I'm gonna go sit my old dumba** down somewhere and let these professionals do their s***.\n\n\"Honestly, I probably looked terrible out there. … As soon as you get out here and you start getting touched, all your training goes out the window.\n\n\"It was fun. I'm glad I had the chance to come out here and do it, but like I thought coming into this, I'm one and done,\" Williams said."
