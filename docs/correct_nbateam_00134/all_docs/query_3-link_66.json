        "text": "By Johnny Askounis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nThree-time NBA All-Star and two-time Olympic gold medalist, Deron Williams is expected to be part of the Jake Paul versus Tommy Fury undercard on December 18, per Shams Charania of The Athletic.\n\nMost Valuable Promotions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian confirmed that Williams will be indeed stepping into the squared circle, via ESPN Ringside. Former NFL star Frank Gore Sr. is considered as a potential opponent, but not yet confirmed.\n\nWilliams, 37, last appeared in the NBA at the bottom end of the 2016-17 season helping the Cleveland Cavaliers win the Eastern Conference before succumbing to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals. The Utah Jazz and New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets were the main highlights of his career with the two stints stretching from 2005 to 2015. He also played for the Dallas Mavericks before joining the Cavs.\n\nPrior to focusing on basketball, he became a state wrestling champion in his youth. Further ties in the fighting world stem from an ownership stake in a gym in Dallas, Fortis MMA. He has been training in mixed martial arts and boxing for years.\n\nSince high school and through his successful NCAA stint at Illinois, Williams focused on basketball leading him to be picked third overall in the 2005 NBA draft. Apart from the NBA, he also displayed his talents in Turkey as a member of Besiktas during the 2011 NBA lockout.\n\nOther notable crossovers into boxing include Seattle-born Nate Robinson being knocked out by social media personality Paul at the Staples Center on November 28, 2020.\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images"
