        "text": "I miss the Jazz of the 2000’s. I miss the dual-balding ballet that was the Deron Williams, Carlos Boozer pick and roll. I miss Williams’s deadly crossover and confusingly quick first-step. I miss the shiny, hair-dye haircut that Boozer regrettably donned in his post-Jazz NBA life. I miss Boozer’s high-arching, hiccupy shooting stroke. I miss Andrei Kirilenko’s long-armed defensive brilliance and perfectly apt nickname — AK47. Kirilenko was a player before his time, wasting away in a less-analytic era of lumbering big men and inefficient superstars. I miss Kirilenko’s 5x5 mastery and the reckless abandon that defined his game. I miss the dead-eye shooting of Mehmet Okur. I miss the bowl-cut and body fat era of NBA basketball. I miss the powder blue uniforms and zip-zap-zop ball-movement. I miss Jerry Sloan. I have no idea why I miss Jerry Sloan, but I do.\n\nI miss the blissful ignorance of youth.\n\nToday, I know too much. I know how the Jazz got their name. I know that Salt Lake City is the opposite of jazz and I’m all too aware that Donovan Mitchell is more Devin Booker than Dwyane Wade.\n\nAll is not lost Jazz fans. The Utah Jazz have taken the first step in recovery. They have admitted to themselves and to us, quite loudly, through their off-season trades and signings, that anytime Joe Ingles is the second-best offensive player on a team, that team isn’t going very far.\n\nForecast: The Jazz will likely bow out as a try-hard, overmatched “regular season team” in the playoffs, but this iteration of try-hard should be more fun to watch than last year’s. Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, and Bojan Bogdanovic should provide more nightly entertainment than we’re accustomed to getting from non-Kirilenko Jazz teams. They’ll even wear the old jerseys some nights!"
