        "text": "Editor’s note: This story was originally published on Nov. 29, 2016. We’re bringing it back with the news of Deron Williams signing up for his first professional boxing match against ex-NFL running back Frank Gore next month.\n\nMavericks point guard Deron Williams is obsessed with mixed martial arts.\n\n“I don’t miss fights,” he said. “Every UFC fight, Fight Pass, if I miss them, I’ll record them and watch them later.”\n\nNow, Williams is taking his obsession to the next level, partnering to develop a new gym in Deep Ellum named Fortis MMA. It’s not simply an investment to watch others work out, grapple or punch. Williams would like to compete when his NBA career is over.\n\n“I think it would be realistic,” he said. My coach “wants me to fight [in the cage]. I don’t know about that. I will do some jiu-jitsu grappling tournaments.”\n\nWilliams, 32, is in the twilight of a basketball career plagued by injuries. His last team, the Brooklyn Nets, bought out his contract. The 6-3, 200-pound Williams recently re-signed with the Mavericks on a one-year, $9-million deal.\n\nWilliams, who has played in only eight of the Mavericks’ first 16 games this season because of injuries, says the MMA training helps lessen the impact on his body.\n\n“I can control my body better,” Williams said. “I can hit the bag, with very little movement and do some light rolling and get a great workout and learn and drill. That’s what I love about it. ... My body has taken a pounding from running on the court.”\n\nBut, he isn’t allowed to take a pounding in MMA yet.\n\n“I don’t think there is something specifically for MMA but there is language that could get you into trouble,” Williams said about restrictions in his Mavericks contract. “You can’t ride a motorcycle. You can’t ski. If you got hurt playing football, you could definitely void your contract or face a fine.”\n\nWilliams, who grew up in The Colony, wrestled from ages 5 to 13 and won youth state championships. He stopped wrestling because of conflicts with his basketball schedule.\n\nWhen he returned to Dallas to join the Mavericks, Williams found Sayif Saud, a local MMA coach. The two hit it off and created the new gym that is a quick drive from Williams’ Preston Hollow home.\n\nNamed for the Latin word “strong,” the 7,000-square-foot Fortis MMA was refurbished from an old art gallery. It’s luxurious for an MMA gym, containing:\n\n— Two mat spaces, one with many boxing bags\n\n— 60-inch LCD TVs to broadcast fights or sports\n\n— Cardio machines and free weights\n\n— Full locker rooms with showers and a sauna\n\n— An outdoor area with padded turf\n\n— An upstairs balcony with an oversized chess game, projector screen and putting green\n\nMonthly memberships will cost $170 for the first 100 members and $200 after that.\n\nWilliams hopes the gym becomes a family affair. His wife, Amy, does kickboxing. Two of his four children plan to do some type of martial arts or wrestling.\n\nAnd for his Mavericks teammates, Williams wants them to be a part of it, too.\n\n“I want to get some of the guys here, especially if I’m here next year,” he said. “Maybe do a boot camp before the season starts.”\n\nWhat about making Dirk Nowitzki into an MMA fighter?\n\n“I don’t know about Dirk. Dirk is almost 20 years in, he’s got his routine. They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. But you never know.”\n\nRelated:Former Mavs guard Deron Williams to fight Frank Gore on Jake Paul-Tommy Fury undercard"
