        "text": "(KSL News and AP) This afternoon, the Utah Jazz signed point guard Deron Williams to a three-year contract extension with a one-year option.\n\nThe team's general manager, Kevin O'Connor, would not discuss the terms of the agreement, but it expected that Williams will receive at least $50 million, and up to $70 million, as part of the deal.\n\nHead coach Jerry Sloan said he is pleased with the deal and is excited to continue working with Williams, saying, \"He certainly made me a lot better by him being here.\"\n\nWilliams said he is eager to continue his career with the Jazz. \"I love this city. I love the fans here, I think they're the best in the world,\" he said.\n\nWilliams still has one year with the Jazz on his rookie contract, signed after the Jazz picked him third overall in the 2005 NBA draft. He has led Utah to the last two Northwest Division titles.\n\nWilliams is also a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team that will play in China next month.\n\nWilliams has career averages of 15.3 points, 8.1 assists and 2.9 rebounds while appearing in a total of 242 of a possible 246 career games, including all 82 during the 2007-08 regular season.\n\nTo watch this afternoon's press conference announcing the deal, click here.\n\n(The Associated Press contributed to this report.
