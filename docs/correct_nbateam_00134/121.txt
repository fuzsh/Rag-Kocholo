Deron Williams Biography

Deron Williams was a catalyst for the 2004-05 University of Illinois basketball team that made an NCAA Championship game appearance. That season he earned consensus second team All-American honors and set the stage for the All-Star career he’d have in the NBA. In 2005 the Utah Jazz selected the Fighting Illini star with the 3rd overall pick in the first round of the NBA Draft, and he’s since become one of the top point guards in the league, earning three All-Star selections and All-NBA Second Team honors in both 2008 and 2010. In 2011 he signed with the Brooklyn Nets. Of his many accomplishments, helping lead Team USA to a Gold Medal in the 2012 London Olympic Games is at the top of the list.
