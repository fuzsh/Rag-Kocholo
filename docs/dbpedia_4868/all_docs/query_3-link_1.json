        "text": "\"Abdur Rahman\" and \"Abdelrahman\" redirect here. For other uses, see Abdur Rahman (disambiguation).\n\nAbd al-Rahman\n\nعبد الرحمنPronunciationÁb-dur-ráh-mán or\n\nÁb-dál-ráh-mánGenderMaleLanguage(s)ArabicOriginLanguage(s)ArabicWord/name'Abd + Ar-RahmanMeaningServant of the Most GraciousRegion of origin7th-century Arabian PeninsulaOther namesRelated namesAmat al-Rahman (female variant), RahmanSee alsoAbdur Rahim, Abdullah\n\nAbdelrahman or Abd al-Rahman or Abdul Rahman or Abdurrahman or Abdrrahman (Arabic: عبد الرحمن or occasionally عبد الرحمان; DMG ʿAbd ar-Raḥman) is a male Arabic Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Rahman. The name means \"servant of the most gracious\", ar-Rahman being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.[1][2]\n\nThe letter A of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. Because the letter R is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Rahman, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Rahman. Alternative transliterations include Abd ar-Rahman, Abdulrahman, Abdur Rehman, Abdul Rehman, Abidur Rahman, Abdrrahman, and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation. Certain transliterations tend to be associated with certain areas, for example, Abdirahman in Somalia, Abderrahmane in French-speaking North Africa, or Abdelrahman in Egypt.\n\nNotable people with the name include:\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Awf (581–654), Arab businessman and tycoon\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr (died 675), Muslim commander and eldest son of Abu Bakr\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Khalid (616–667), Umayyad governor of Homs\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Muljam (died 661), the Kharijite assassin of Ali\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Rabiah (fl. 652), Arab leader in the Khazar-Arab Wars\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Ziyad, Umayyad governor of Khurasan in 679–681\n\nAl-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi (deposed 718), Umayyad governor of Al-Andalus\n\nAbd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi (died 732), Arab leader in the Battle of Tours\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Kathir al-Lakhmi (fl. 746) Umayyad governor of Al Andalus\n\nAbd ar-Rahman ibn Uqba (fl. 755), governor of Septimania\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri (died 755), ruler of Ifriqiya\n\nYusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri (fl. 756), governor of al-Andalus\n\nAbd al-Rahman al-Awza'i (707–774), Arab lawyer\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Rustam (729–784), founder of the Rustamid dynasty\n\nAbd al-Rahman I (731–788), Umayyad emir in Córdoba, founded Umayyad dynasty\n\nAbd al-Rahman II (788–852), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nAbd al-Rahman III (890–961), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nAbdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti, traditionally held to be the common ancestor of the Somali Darod clan\n\nAbd al-Rahman al-Sufi, also known as Azophi (903–986), Persian astronomer\n\nAbd al-Rahman Sanchuelo (983–1009), chief minister of Córdoba\n\nAbd al-Rahman IV (died 1018), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nAbd al-Rahman V (died 1024), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nYusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Mizzi (1256–1342), Syrian Islamic scholar\n\nMohamed bin Abdulrahman M.
