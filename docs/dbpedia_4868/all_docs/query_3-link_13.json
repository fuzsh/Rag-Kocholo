It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Rahman. The name means \"servant of the most merciful\", ar-Rahman being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.\n\nContents\n\nMedieval\n\nBusiness\n\nEntertainment\n\nJudges and lawyers\n\nInternational organizations\n\nHistorical nations\n\nAfghanistan\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nIraq\n\nJordan\n\nLibya\n\nMalaysia\n\nMorocco\n\nNigeria\n\nPakistan\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSomalia\n\nSudan\n\nYemen\n\nOther places\n\nPrisoners\n\nReligion\n\nScience and academia\n\nSoldiers\n\nBasketball\n\nCricket\n\nFencing\n\nFootball\n\nRunning\n\nOther sports\n\nTerrorists and militants\n\nWriters\n\nOther persons\n\nReferences\n\nThe letter A of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. Because the letter R is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Rahman, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Rahman. Alternative transliterations include ‘Abd ar-Rahman, Abdul Rahman, Abdur Rahman, Abdur Rehman, Abdul Rehman, Abidur Rahman, and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation. Certain transliterations tend to be associated with certain areas, for example, Abdirahman in Somalia, and Abderrahmane in French-speaking North Africa.\n\nIt may refer to:\n\nMedieval\n\nAbdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr (early 7th century), son of the first Sunni caliph\n\nAbdur Rahman bin Awf (died 652), one of the Sahaba\n\nAbdulreman ibn Khalid (616–667), Muslim soldier\n\nAbd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah (fl. 652), Arab leader in the Khazar-Arab Wars\n\nAbd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam, assassin in 661 of Ali\n\nAl-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi (deposed 718), Umayyad governor of Al-Andalus\n\nAbdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi (died 732), Arab leader in the Battle of Tours\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Katir al-Lahmi (fl. 746) Umayyad governor of Al Andalus\n\nAbd al-Rahman ben Uqba (fl. 755), governor of Septimania\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri (died 755), ruler of Ifriqiya\n\nYusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri (fl. 756), governor of al-Andalus\n\nAbd al-Rahman al-Awza'i (707–774), Arab lawyer\n\nAbd ar-Rahman I (731–788), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nAbd ar-Rahman II (788–852), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nAbd-ar-Rahman III (890–961), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nAbdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti, traditionally held to be the common ancestor of the Somali Darod clan\n\nAbd al-Rahman al-Sufi, also known as Azophi (903–986), Persian astronomer\n\nAbd al-Rahman Sanchuelo (983–1009), chief minister of Córdoba\n\nAbd ar-Rahman IV (died 1018), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nAbd ar-Rahman V (died 1024), Umayyad emir in Córdoba\n\nYusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Mizzi (1256–1342), Syrian Islamic scholar\n\nBusiness\n\nYousif bin Abdulrahman Fakhro (1871–1952), Bahraini businessman\n\nMohamed bin Abdulrahman M.
