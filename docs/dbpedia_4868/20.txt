The 2011 CAF Champions League Final was the final of the 2011 CAF Champions League, the 47th edition of Africa's premier club football tournament organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), and the 15th edition under the current CAF Champions League format.

The final was played between Wydad AC from Morocco and Espérance ST from Tunisia.[1][2] After a goal-less first leg,[3] Espérance ST won the second leg 1–0 to win their second African title (the first being the 1994 African Cup of Champions Clubs).[4] The win saw Espérance ST complete the Treble, and as a result, Espérance ST qualified to enter the quarterfinals of the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup as the CAF representative, as well as participate in the 2012 CAF Super Cup against the winner of the 2011 CAF Confederation Cup.

Format

The final was decided over two legs, with aggregate goals used to determine the winner. If the sides were level on aggregate after the second leg, the away goals rule would have been applied, and if still level, the tie would have proceeded directly to a penalty shootout (no extra time is played).[5]
