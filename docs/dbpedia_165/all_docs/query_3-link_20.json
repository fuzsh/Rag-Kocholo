        "text": "Mussels within the subfamily Bathymodiolinae, in particular the larger Bathymodiolus species (sensu lato) thriving at cold seeps and hydrothermal vents, are among the most iconic fauna to colonize deep-sea reducing habitats globally. Fuelled by energy derived from chemosynthetic symbioses, their contribution to ecosystem productivity is conspicuous, with many bathymodioline species forming dense, extensive aggregates. Chemosymbiotic mussels play crucial roles as ecosystem engineers, both through the formation of spatially heterogeneous biogenic reefs and in redistributing reduced-fluid emissions. The notable absence of Bathymodiolinae outside of reducing ecosystems affirms their dependency on these ephemeral habitats, placing spatiotemporal constraints on dispersal to, and colonization of nascent, chemosynthetically active substrata. Thus, although symbioses may explain why these mussels are so productive in deep-sea reducing habitats, species' survival over successive generations depends largely upon the adaptive characteristics of their lifecycle as a whole. Despite accumulating data on the biology and ecology of adults however, details remain fragmented regarding earlier developmental junctures during their development. This paper therefore brings together results from research undertaken over recent years on this topic, providing a synthesis of various lifecycle aspects of bathymodiolins from the earliest stages of development, gametogenesis, through to sexual maturity, including the intrinsic, emerging role of symbionts. The review provides a comprehensive overview of our current understanding and identifies areas where further study into these keystone organisms is warranted. The benefits of applying an integrated, lifecycle approach when evaluating the potential impacts of global change and anthropogenic activities upon deep-sea fauna and their habitats are then discussed.\n\nStudies of the trophic structure in methane-seep habitats provide insight into the ecological function of deep-sea ecosystems. Methane seep biota on the Chilean margin likely represent a novel biogeographic province; however, little is known about the ecology of the seep fauna and particularly their trophic support. The present study, using natural abundance stable isotopes, reveals a complex trophic structure among heterotrophic consumers, with four trophic levels supported by a diversity of food sources at a methane seep area off Concepci on, Chile (~36Â° S). Although methanotrophy, thiotrophy and phototrophy are all identified as carbon fixation mechanisms fueling the food web within this area, most of the analysed species (87.5%) incorporate carbon derived from photosynthesis and a smaller number (12%) use carbon derived from chemosynthesis. Methane-derived carbon (MDC) incorporation was documented in 22 taxa, including sipunculids, gastropods, polychaetes and echinoderms. In addition, wide trophic niches were detected in suspension-feeding and deposit-feeding taxa, possibly associated with the use of organic matter in different stages of degradation (e.g. from fresh to refractory). Estimates of Bayesian standard ellipses area (SEA B) reveal different isotopic niche breadth in the predator fishes, the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides and the combtooth dogfish Centroscyllium nigrum, suggesting generalist versus specialist feeding behaviors, respectively. Top predators in the ecosystem were the Patagonian toothfish D. eleginoides and the dusky cat shark, Bythaelurus canescens. The blue hake Antimora rostrata also provides a trophic link between the benthic and pelagic systems, with a diet based primarily on pelagic-derived carrion. These findings can inform accurate ecosystem models, which are critical for effective management and conservation of methane seep and adjacent deep-sea habitats in the Southeastern Pacific."
