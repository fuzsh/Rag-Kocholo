It is these properties that allow locomotion by molluscs on what is seemingly an adhesive. On dehydration, the strength and stiffness of mucus increase such that molluscs can suspend their body by a thread of it. Mucus production has been studied quantitatively by various methods, some gravimetric and some colorimentric using pedal, faecal, pseudofaecal and hypobranchial mucus: there is much spatial and temporal variation. In locomotion mucus is a coupling agent between foot and substratum; a medium in which propulsive cilia beat; and a drogue. Mucus deposited as a trail by gastropods is an important facet of their environment. Many species follow mucus trails possibly contributing to the observed patchy distributions of gastropods. The methods by which the presence and polarity of mucus trails are detected is poorly understood. Mucus plays a vital role in feeding. In filter-feeding bivalves, mucus aids the transport of food from gill to mouth and is employed to cleanse the mantle cavity of particles rejected by the labial palps. In gastropods mucus nets and bags are used to trap food prior to ingestion and some groups roll their prey in mucus to prevent its escape. Pedal mucus may be ingested after it has become studded with organic material and perhaps act as a fertilizer for microbial growth. A copious secretion of epithelial mucus is used to isolate molluscs from their environment and mucus may also serve as an ionoregulator. Mucus may also contain specific products to render the animal poisonous, distasteful or irritating. Agglutinin and lysozyme have been found in mucus from marine molluscs. Mucus secretion can present a considerable drain of energy (up to 70% of consumed energy). The fate of molluscan mucus is largely unknown and probably makes a considerable contribution to POM in inshore waters, although its is readily degradable by marine microbes. Given the persistence of mucus, densities of benthic gastropods and their motility patterns, much of the gastropod-inhabited benthos is likely to be covered for most of the time with a layer of pedal mucus.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nMucus is essential to the function of marine molluscs. Mucus has a function in almost all physiological processes and plays a role beyond the use of its producers, at the levels of community and ecosystem. Nevertheless the literature is relatively sparse - particularly in comparison to the vast literature on mammalian mucus and its physiological functions. Hence comparatively\n\n3\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\nlittle is known of the composition, structure, functions and fate of molluscan mucus. Recently there has been an increase in the awareness of the importance of mucus in the functioning of marine molluscs and its role in the ecosystem. Our review draws together the current knowledge concerning mucus from marine molluscs, synthesizes ideas and points the way towards future work. We first discuss the nature of mucus, its properties, production sites and functions. The importance of mucus in physiological and ecological energetics is then considered and finally its significance at the community and ecosystem level is assessed. Our discussions are confined in the most part to the secretions of marine molluscs, but we include relevant information on terrestrial and freshwater molluscs and other animal phyla. Table 1 summarizes key papers on mucus from other groups. We must first clearly define what we are discussing. The nomenclature of mucus is confused. We follow the nomenclature of Reid and Clamp (1978) who proposed a standard, simplified, terminology. Polymeric substances consisting of carbohydrate covalently linked to non-carbohydrates, usually lipid or protein, are glycoconjugates and exist in combination with protein as either proteoglycan (glycosaminoglycan) or glycoprotein depending on Table 1 Important references on mucus in non-molluscan groups.\n\nGroup/topic\n\nReference ~~\n\nInvertebrate mucus: structure Invertebrate mucus: functions Invertebrate mucus: agglutinating and antibacterial activity Mammalian mucus: biochemistry Fish Fish: defence Fish skin: drag reduction Elasmobranch skin: composition Fish gills Tunicates: mucus filtration mechanism Nemerteans (terrestrial and freshwater) Coral: composition Coral: production and fate Sponges: antimicrobial activity Macroalgae Diatoms Foraminifera: bacteria “farming” Phytoplankton aggregates Microbes (marine) Microbes Plant roots\n\n~~\n\n~~\n\n~~\n\nHunt (1970) Denny (1989) Astley and Ratcliffe (1989) Strous and Dekker (1992) Shephard (1994) Alexander and Ingram (1992) Bernadsky et al.

Mucus is used both as adjective and noun and the latter is regarded as the slimy secretion of any epithelial surface. The purified glycoconjugate from mucus is called mucin. Usage of vague terms, particularly those prefixed by “muco-”, such as “mucoprotein”, “mucopolysaccharide” and “mucosubstance” (excepting “mucocyte” which is any cell which produces mucus), is not encouraged. We advocate the abandonment of the adjectival “mucous” in favour of the shorter “mucus”, used as an adjectival noun.\n\n2. COMPOSITION OF MUCUS\n\nThe major component of molluscan mucus is water (Wilson, 1968; Hunt, 1970; Grenon and Walker, 1980; Connor, 1986, Davies et al., 1990b) which forms from 81.4% (w/w) of wet weight in pedal mucus from Nucella emarginata (Connor, 1986) to 99.8% (w/w) in hypobranchial mucus from Busycon canaliculatum (Shashova and Kwart, 1959). Table 2 gives a summary of the constituents of mucus. There is mounting evidence that, at least for terrestrial species, the majority of this water is absorbed from the environment, and that the mucus is released in a membrane-bound dehydrated form (Kapeleta et al., 1996). This leaves 0.2% to 18.6% (w/w) as solid matter which can be divided into two groups: the high molecular weight protein-polysaccharide complexes and the inorganic salts. Grenon and Walker (1980) found the inorganic salts formed 3.1% (w/w) of the hydrated pedal mucus of Patella vulgata and consisted of sodium, magnesium and calcium ions, of which almost two-thirds were the divalent cations. Other analyses have been performed on the pedal mucuses of the terrestrial Helix pomatia (Burton, 1965) and the freshwater Lymnaea truncatula (Wilson, 1968); both these mucuses were shown to contain sodium and potassium ions. Inorganics in the hypobranchial mucus of Busycon canaliculatum amounted to up to 12% of dry weight and their main ionic components were sodium and calcium (Shashova and Kwart, 1959). There is a distinct seasonal variation in the composition of the pedal mucus of Patella vulgata (Davies et al., 1990b), which may be related to the reproductive cycle, reflecting similar variation in somatic tissues (Barry and Munday, 1959; Blackmore, 1969b). Ash content showed a maximum (-60% of dry mucus weight) in spring when the gonads were inactive. Protein (-36%) and carbohydrate (1620%) also reach maxima during the spring or early summer and show minima (-30% and 14-18%, respectively) towards the end of the spawning period in early winter, suggesting that energy might be diverted from mucus production into gonad development. Davies et al. (1990b) recorded a higher carbohydrate content in the\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n5\n\nmucus from small limpets than in that from larger limpets. The mucus produced by intertidal gastropods must function over a wide range of environmental conditions, for each of which a specific mucus composition may be most appropriate. Thus seasonal variation in, for example, temperature, may equally be responsible for variations in composition. Following CHN analysis of the pedal mucus of the Antarctic limpet, Nacella concinna, Peck et al. (1993) determined protein to be 31.1YO, carbohydrate to be 12.0% and lipid to be 2.5%. Similar values were recorded for Californian acmaeid limpets by Connor (1986) (Table 2). Iwasaki (1992) discovered that in the limpet Cellana grata, the protein content of trail mucus was some 16 times less than in the mucus produced while stationary; and the protein content of “stationary” mucus increased the longer the animals remained stationary (up to 24 h tested) (Table 2). According to Reid and Clamp (1978) and Denny (1983), the proteinpolysaccharide complexes (high molecular weight) components of mucus have attracted more work since it is these which confer on the mucus its particular and peculiar properties. In particular, specific complexes can have specific functions (see Section 3). These complexes have traditionally been split into two groups according to their structure: glycosaminoglycans (GAGs; often called mucopolysaccharides or proteoglycans) and glycoproteins (Reid and Clamp, 1978). In invertebrates there is a blurred distinction between these two groups since structurally they represent the endpoints of a continuum (Denny, 1983). The glycoproteins are composed of short, often branched, carbohydrate chains (oligosaccharides) bound to a large protein component which is important in determining the properties of the mucus (Gottschalk, 1972). In contrast, the GAGs are made up of high molecular weight, long and typically linear carbohydrate chains (Gottschalk, 1972) and the attached protein contributes little to the properties of the mucus (Denny, 1983). These complexes occur widely in invertebrates (see Hunt, 1970, for review). An account of the physical chemistry of the GAG present in the hypobranchial mucus of Busycon canaliculatum is given by Kwart and Shashova (1958). Although it has been established that glycoprotein and GAG do not occur in isolation from each other, for example, in the hypobranchial secretion of Buccinum undatum (Hunt, 1967, 1970), it is recognized that GAGS are far more common than glycoproteins in molluscan mucuses (Denny, 1983). Glycoproteins are conjugated proteins where the prosthetic group or groups are constituted by covalently bound heterosaccharide units (see Gottschalk, 1972 for details on glycoproteins). Each macromolecule has a molecular weight of between 10 x lo6 and 45 x lo6. The carbohydrate constitutes about 80% (w/w) of the mucin and occurs in clusters along a protein core. Each cluster has a molecular weight of 500 to 4000 and can be neutral or acidic, branched or linear and contains from one to about 20 monosac-\n\nTable 2 Summary of biochemical content of mucus from aquatic gastropods.

These tightly packed oligosaccharide units protect the core from proteolytic enzymes (Gottschalk, 1972). This type of mucus can be fragmented by the reduction of disulphide bonds (see Clamp et al., 1978, for review). The fine structure of the clusters is reviewed by Hunt (1970). The viscosity of vertebrate mucus is increased by the presence of sialic acid-substituted glycoproteins. In invertebrates this role is more commonly filled by acidic GAGs (Hunt, 1970) and sialic acid generally appears absent (Warren, 1963; Denny, 1983). Inoue (1965), however, identified sialic acid in hydrolysates from the digestive gland of the whelk, Charonia lampas as did Cottrell et a f . (1993) from the trail mucus of the terrestrial slug, Arion ater ( < 1 % of solids). Although less is known about the structure of GAG, it is related to that of glycoprotein (Gottschalk, 1972). Livingstone and de Zwaan (1983) give a limited account of GAG structure which they describe as heteropolysaccharides combined with specific proteins. The sugar groups are composed of two types of alternating monosaccharide units, at least one of which bears an acidic (carboxyl or sulphuric) group. The presence of uronic acid gives each GAG an anionic charge (sometimes increased by the presence of sulphate groups) which allows its separation from proteins and glycoproteins. The precise structure varies from mucin to mucin (Chandrasekaran and BeMiller, 1980) and anything other than a superficial structure has yet to be elucidated. The bonds linking protein and carbohydrate in gastropod GAGs have been shown to be covalent, alkali stable and 0-glycosidic (Hunt, 1970; Grenon and Walker, 1980), but this apart, little is known of their nature. Fountain (1982) suggested that agglutinating lectins might have a structural role (cross-linking carbohydrate and protein) in the mucuses from a wide variety of plants and animals, including a terrestrial pulmonate. Detailed accounts of mucus structure, giving information on, for example, the precise nature of some of the proteinxarbohydrate bonds are given by Clamp et a f . (1978) and Strous and Dekker (1992). These details are solely for mammalian mucus and so may not be consistent with molluscan findings. Shashova and Kwart (1959) proposed a molecular structure for the hypobranchial mucus of Busycon canaliculatum, based on the evidence available at the time, which suggested a polyhexoseammonium sulphate linked to an acidic protein moiety through calcium ions. Despite this, as far as the Mollusca are concerned, the exact biochemical composition and the linkage of the various components into a final mucus gel have yet to be understood, although Cottrell et al. (1993) present some valuable though limited information on the trail mucus of terrestrial slugs. Denny (1983) gives an account of what is known for the Mollusca and his comment that there are insufficient data to enable a model of molluscan mucus to be drawn is still true. It is clear then that much more biochemical and molecular work is needed to\n\n8\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\nunderstand how the mucus of molluscs is able to act in such a wide range of activities (see Section 5).\n\n3. PROPERTIES OF MUCUS The properties of molluscan hypobranchial and pedal mucuses were reviewed by Denny and Gosline (1980) and Denny (1983, 1984). Even the simple physical properties remain to be fully explored, probably owing to the complex and heterogeneous nature of mucus. Solubility of the pedal mucus of Patella vulgata in a variety of solvents was described by Grenon and Walker (1980). Mucus was insoluble in seawater and distilled water, salt solutions, common organic solvents and in Nacetyl-L-cysteinewhich according to Davis et al. (1975) is a strong mucolytic agent. Grenon and Walker found mucus to dissolve in solutions of sodium hypochlorite and alkaline sodium sulphate. In our tests with mucus from the same source, however, these solutions did not dissolve the mucus, although hypochlorite did cause the mucus to disaggregate after about 30 min. Trials with l,l, 1-trichloroethane, which can break up vertebrate mucuses (pers. obs.), had no effect on pedal mucus from P . vulgata. Not surprisingly, 16M HN03 effectively broke up the mucus. The precise rheological properties of mucus are critical in enabling the mucus to function; the strength of mucus should not be underestimated. Denny (1989) reported the tensile stiffness of the mucus “ropes” of the terrestrial slug Limax maximus to be of the order of lo5 N m-*. The shear stiffness of gastropod pedal mucuses ranges from 200 to 400N m-2 (Denny, 1983). It is this stiffness that enables mucus to function as a tensile element in feeding strands, webs, nets, bags and curtains (see Denny, 1989); and a mucus secretion, loaded with protein, forms the crystalline style of bivalves and some suspension-feeding gastropods (Barnes, 1980). Under small deformities pedal mucus is a viscoelastic solid. As stress is increased the mucus yields to become a viscous liquid, the yield strength being proportional to the rate of deformation (see also Simkiss and Wilbur, 1977). Solidity, increasing with time, returns if the mucus is allowed to heal undeformed. Concordantly, the hypobranchial mucus of the whelk Buccinum undatum shows a Weisman effect - an elastic recoil - when stirred (Hunt and Jevons, 1963, 1966). It is these properties whch enable the familiar crawling locomotion of slugs and snails. Under the leading edge of a locomotory (muscular) wave travelling along the sole of a slug or snail, mucus is stressed and as a result flows, allowing the wave to progress. As the wave passes over the mucus the viscosity of the mucus increases. In many species this provides the adhesive coupling\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n9\n\nbetween substratum and mollusc which allows slugs and snails to adhere to walls and ceilings (see Denny, 1981, for a quantitative description of this for terrestrial slugs). It should be noted that mucus is not the sole tenacityenabling agent. Smith (1991, 1992) noted that suction can play a role in the adhesion of some limpet species, but presumably mucus helps to produce a good seal. Denny (1984) suggested that the rheological properties of mucus may place constraints on gastropod structure and performance. Denny measured the properties of Ariolimax columbianus mucus and derived a theoretical maximum speed of locomotion (0.6 mm s-I), comparable to speeds observed (0.8-2.3 mm s-'), by calculating the time taken for mucus to flow under the stresses imposed by the foot of a slug. Denny also calculated theoretical tenacities based on the properties of mucus and predicted the maximum size for molluscs in wave-swept environments (17.3 cm for a limpet-shaped organism), again with reasonable accuracy (typical maximal size, 25cm). Molluscan mucus also has a remarkable capacity for absorbing water when it is first secreted (Verdugo, 1990, see Section 4), although this ability in marine molluscs has not been assessed. When dehydrated both the strength and stiffness of pedal mucus increase substantially, such that littorinid snails can attach to rock walls (Wilson, 1929; Bingham, 1972; Denny, 1984) and hang from rock ceilings (Davies and Hawkins, pers. obs.) using a strand of dehydrated pedal mucus. Denny (1984) found the mean breaking strength for such mucus produced by Littorina aspera to be lo8N m-2. Patterns of dehydation of the pedal mucus of Patella vulgata with temperature, wind speed and relative humidity, point to > 50% dehydration - and often total dehydration - of exposed mucus on mid-upper shores during emersion (Davies et al., 1992~).In seawater, rehydration of the mucus (from a totally dehydrated state) is slow (from -10% to -20% of hydrated weight over a 6-h period) and although after this period the mucus regains its stickiness, such dehydration means that the mucus is unlikely to recover to a fully hydrated state. Davies et al. (1992~)also found in laboratory experiments that the pedal mucus of P. vulgata degrades (loses weight) in seawater at a rate of 10% 6 h-'. This degradation was ascribed to the mechanical action of moving seawater.\n\n-\n\n4. MUCUS PRODUCTION\n\nThe structure and the secretions of the molluscan epidermis were reviewed by Simkiss and Wilbur (1977). These authors also provided a comprehensive account of the functioning of the epidermis in the transfer of substances, including mucus, across the skin. They report that mucus as a functional\n\n10\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\nsubstance is often a product of various glands mixed with a general exudate from epithelial cells. Parker (191 1) suggested that during gastropod locomotion a “high viscosity” mucus was secreted by the suprapedal glands and a lower viscosity mucus was secreted by the sole, although there is no evidence to support this suggestion. Numerous authors (Deyrup-Olsen et al., 1983,1992; Martin and DeyrupOlsen, 1986; Verdugo, 1990; Luchtel et al., 1991; Deyrup-Olsen, 1996; Deyrup-Olsen and Jindrova, 1996; Kapeleta et al., 1996) have reported that the mucus of terrestrial slugs is released as membrane-bound “granules”. These are typically of size -5-10pm (Kapeleta et al., 1996). The bursting of these granules can be triggered by elevated pH (Deyrup-Olsen, 1996), certain carbohydrates (Deyrup-Olsen and Jindrova, 1996), mechanical force (e.g. during locomotion), cold shock and micromolar levels of ATP (Deyrup-Olsen et al., 1992). Deyrup-Olsen et al. (1992) obtained evidence that initiation of granule swelling may occur via an ATP receptor on the granule membrane which triggers calcium channels, allowing a large efflux which in turn triggers swelling. Hydration then occurs, in the presence of water, to a volume of 150-8OOx (Verdugo, 1991; Kapeleta et al., 1996) to produce a functioning mucus. In many cases such products from several different types of mucocyte (e.g. those on the sole of the foot of a gastropod, Shirbhate and Cook, 1987), will combine to produce a multifunctioning mucus (see Section 2). It seems likely that marine molluscs also release their mucus in discrete microscopic packets. Although this has yet to be demonstrated conclusively, pedal mucus from the limpet Patella vulgata can be seen emerging in packets under TEM (Figure 1). This has also been seen in the periwinkle Littorina litforea (Davies, in press). Mucus “filaments” ( < 1 pm wide, > l00pm long) and associated granules in the locomotory trails of Helix aspersa (Simkiss and Wilbur, 1977), Ilyanassa obsoleta (Bretz and Dimock, 1983) and littorinids (Tankersley, 1990; Davies and Hutchinson, 1995) have puzzled their observers, but may be related to the hydration of mucus. Histological examination of the gastropod epidermis has attracted much attention (see Simkiss and Wilbur, 1977; Grenon and Walker, 1978; Shirbhate and Cook, 1987 for reviews) as has the functions of the gastropod epidermis such as respiration (e.g. Jones, 1961), osmoregulation (e.g. Greenaway, 1970) and tenacity (Grenon and Walker, 1981). However, there has been little attempt to relate such function to the detailed structure of the epidermis. Mucus secretion is no exception in this respect even though it is a characteristic feature of the molluscan epidermis and is important in a wide range of physiological processes. Branch and Marsh (1978) described the structure of the foot in six Southern African Patella species in terms of interspecific differences in mucus secretion and tenacity. They found that high tenacity was associated with a low mucus secretion rate and a small\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n11\n\nFigure 1 Transmission electron micrograph showing the ultrastructure of the pedal sole of the limpet Putella vulgatu.

Grenon and Walker (1978) described histologically and biochemically the structure of the foot and pedal gland system of P . vulgara and proposed functions for each of nine gland types (P1to P9) identified (Figure 2). Six of the gland types release their secretions onto the foot sole and three onto the side wall. The sole epithelium consists of three cell types: non-ciliated cells, ciliated cells and P9 goblet cells (mucocytes) (Figure 1). These mucocytes are\n\n12\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J.

Grenon and Walker (1978) also examined the pedal glands of Acmaea (Tectura) tessulata and identified six gland types secreting on to the sole, homologous in function to the six of P . vulgata. Epithelial goblet cells are present in many prosobranchs (Fretter and Graham, 1994) and are not merely providing a surface lubricant or protective layer as their density is much greater in the sole of the foot than in areas where these functions are more important such as the side wall of the foot (Grenon and Walker, 1978). It is unlikely that they are responsible for producing locomotory mucus as this is probably secreted mostly by the marginal gland in\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n13\n\nthe anterior marginal groove (Fretter and Graham, 1994; Grenon and Walker, 1978). The other, more likely function of P9 glands is adhesion. Grenon and Walker (1978) suggested some pedal glands secrete a highly viscous mucus for adhesive function, while others secrete a less viscous mucus for locomotory purposes. However, Denny and Gosline (1980) showed a single pedal mucus of Ariolimax columbianus was capable of altering its viscoelastic properties under different physical conditions. The acid GAG secretion of the P9 glands (Hunt, 1973; Grenon and Walker, 1978) is indicative of high viscosity in aqueous solution (Hunt, 1973) and suggests an adhesive function (see earlier). The density of P9 cells in the feet of three limpet species, Patella vulgata, P . depressa and P. ulyssiponensis ( P . aspera) was investigated by Davies (in press). He found that there was no significant change in P9 density in P. vulgata populations differing in shore height (at the one site investigated) but that significant differences were apparent (range of means: 63-96 mm-' of epithelium transversely-sectioned at 8 pm) between the species and between P. vulgata populations from shores of different exposure. Shirbhate and Cook (1987) identified five types of mucus-secreting cell in the foot of Littorina littorea (Figure 3). Most mucus is secreted by the two cell types in the anterior groove of the pedal sole which are differentiated on shape and texture and contain neutral GAGs. The remaining three types, two of which are subepithelial, secrete neutral, sulphated and carboxylated GAG. Although most other epithelial surfaces of most marine gastropods are likely to be secretory to some extent, there is a notable lack of information on gland types and discharges. An exception is Littorina littorea whose epithelia are described by Fretter and Graham (1994) and whose opercular gland system has been described by Shirbhate and Cook (1987). Goblet cells likely to be responsible for producing mucus are also apparent on the pallial margin of Patella spp. (Hackney et al., 1983; Hodgson et al., 1987) and are presumably present on most molluscan pallial surfaces. For bivalves, the most obvious site of mucus production is the ctenidia, although surprisingly little work has been done to determine mucocyte distribution and density, especially since such studies can reveal much about the feeding mechanism. Foster-Smith (1975) recorded many more mucocytes on the abfrontal surface of gill filaments than on frontal surfaces in Mytilus edulis, Cerastoderma edule and Venerupispullastra, and their uneven distribution is now established (see Owen and McCrae, 1976). Ahn et al. (1988) identified mucocytes in M . edulis containing neutral and acidic GAGs on the lateral gill surface and neutral or sulphated GAGs abfrontally. A useful and relatively new application to investigate the production sites of mucus and the subsequent movement of mucus is the endoscope (Ward et al., 1991, see Section 5 ) . Beninger et al.

These authors used these techniques on Mytilus edulis to trace the origin of the ventral mucus strand, which transports trapped food particles to the mouth, as the mucocytes of the frontal surfaces of the gill filaments and/or the mucus glands within the filaments dorsal to the ventral grooves. Endoscopic observation by Beninger et al. (1992) suggests that in the scallop Placopecten magellanicus there are two types of mucus used in feeding and each has a different viscosity. Particles transported towards the dorsal margin are trapped in a low-viscosity mucus, while those transported ventrally are in a high-viscosity mucus. Beninger et al. (1993) further examined the gills of P. magellanicus and found that on the principal filaments mucocytes increase in number dorsalward and secrete a mixture of mucins. On the interprincipal (“ordinary”) filaments mucocytes\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n15\n\nmostly contain an acid GAG and increase in number towards the plical crests. Endoscopy revealed the principal filaments to be involved in feeding and the interprincipal filaments in cleaning activities. Beninger et al. (1993) also examined Mytilus edulis and found a more even distribution of mucocytes and a broader range of GAG secretions. Beninger and Dufor (1996) recorded both mucocytes secreting acidic GAG and mucocytes secreting neutral GAG on to the gill of Crassostrea virginica. The density of mucocytes decreased from plical crest to trough and the anterior plicae showed an increased proportion of acid GAG secretory cells. Beninger and Dufor suggested that this would increase the viscosity of mucus as it reaches the labial palps, facilitating the transport of filtered material to the palps (see Ward et al. 1994), and that conditions for the formation of a mucus cord were “a relatively large amount of acid-dominant mucus compressed into a tight space”. Sorting of food particles and a control on their volume entering the mouth is thought to be achieved by the labial palps (see, e.g. Bayne and Newell, 1983) where dense mucocytes occur (Beninger et al., 1995) (Figure 4). Subepithelial mucocytes with acidic secretions are concentrated on the anterior half of palp ridges in M . edulis and epithelial mucocytes with neutral secretions are concentrated on the anterior half of ridge crests. In the troughs subepithelial mucocytes dominate. On the smooth surface of the palps epithelial mucocytes with mostly neutral, but occasionally acidic, secretions are randomly distributed (Beninger et al., 1995) (Figure 4). The functioning of the palps in particle sorting is partially described by Beninger and St-Jean (1997a) and by Beninger et al. (1997a). Drawing on both published and unpublished evidence, Beninger and St-Jean (1997b) suggested that the mucus produced by various pallial organs differs according to the function of each organ. They postulated that: viscous acid-dominated GAGs are produced on, or from areas leading to, exposed surfaces and function in particle transport against the prevailing current flow, e.g. nonselective transport of pseudofaeces or in gill ventral grooves; lower-viscosity mixed GAGs are produced where transport is on, or from areas leading to, an enclosed surface and is with the current flow, e.g. transport of particles for ingestion; low-viscosity neutral GAGs occur where a reduced viscosity function is important, e.g. on labial palps where food particles are extracted from mucus prior to sorting. The mucus of cephalopods has received relatively little attention, perhaps because it is not regarded as functionally important as in other molluscan classes (see Packard, 1988, for information). Quantitative studies of mucus production have rarely been undertaken for their own sake (but see Denny, 1980a; Culley and Sherman, 1985; Davies et al., 1990a, 1992b; Davies, 1993; Davies and Williams, 1995, 1997; Kapeleta et al., 1996). They are more usually made incidentally in studies where the main aim is something else (e.g. biochemical study, Wilson, 1968;\n\n16\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J.

The only mucuses whose production have been quantified are those secreted by the pedal sole and hypobranchial gland, those which emerge with the faeces and those involved in bivalve feeding. A large proportion of bivalve mucus is lost to the environment as pseudofaeces (Foster-Smith, 1975; Owen and McCrae, 1976; Bayne and Newell, 1983), most of which has the large bivalve gill as its ultimate origin (Morton, 1983, Beninger et al., 1993). Although attempts have been made to measure this loss, none has been totally satisfactory. Deslous-Paoli et al. (1983), Heral et al. (1983) and Deslous-Paoli and HCral (1984) used the technique of Sornin et al. (1983) to measure the “biodeposits” (faeces and pseudofaeces) produced by oysters. Sornin et al. used jars suspended under tables of oysters to collect their biodeposits. The biodeposits were then analysed for photopigments and organic C and N. Deslous-Paoli et al. (1992) placed Crassostrea gigas “on a division” such that pseudofaeces and faeces could be collected by pipette on either side. Organic and mineral contents of the biodeposits were determined. Walz (1978) estimated organic material in faeces and pseudofaeces by dispersing them with an airlift as they were produced by Dreissena polymorpha. He then took a sample of the medium (assuming its organic component to be uniformly suspended) and determined its C content using a C-H analyser. K i ~ r b o eet al. (1980) collected pseudofaeces in a sedimentation chamber attached via a tube to the inhalant siphon of Mytilus edulis. Pseudofaecal carbon content was determined by wet oxidation. Aiello et al. (1988) quantified mucus production of M . edulis gill by staining the collected mucus string using alcian blue and then reading in a spectrophotometer the concentration of free dye in a suspension of dissociated mucus formed by treatment with dioctyl ester of sulphosuccinic acid.

Aiello et al. also recorded the velocity (means -0.5 mm s-’) and width (means from 24-56 pm) of the mucus string in the ventral food groove and concluded, by observing the effects of neurotransmitters, that at least the secretion from frontal mucocytes is under nervous control. The above techniques, particularly the latter, could be applied to estimate mucus loss by feeding an inorganic diet. Until this is done the results regarding mucus will remain difficult to interpret. None of the above studies was undertaken specifically to determine mucus production. Nevertheless, given the amount of pseudofaecal release (see, e.g. Bayne and Newell, 1983, Htral et al., 1983), the amount of mucus in pseudofaeces is likely to be energetically costly. Prins and Smaal (1989) reported net losses of carbon by M. edulis, > 40 mg I-’ of water pumped, attributed to loss of mucus bound in pseudofaeces, described by Hawkins and Bayne (1992) as “very significant indirect costs of filtration in turbid environments”. Hypobranchial mucus secretion was measured by Kideys and Hartnoll (1991). They filtered the seawater taken from tanks in which individual Buccinum undatum had been placed for 20-30 min. The residue (assumed to represent hypobranchial mucus) was produced by animals at the rate of 2-100 mg dry weight h-’, depending on animal size and had a calorific value of 8.76 kJ g-I. Lubricatory mucus may be secreted into the gut of molluscs to ease the passage of food (see Bayne and Hawkins, 1990) and will emerge with the faeces. Some vermetid molluscs use mucus produced in the foregut to transport food particles into the stomach (Morton, 1951). Beninger and Le Pennec (1993) observed mucus glands in the bucco-oesophageal region of Mytilus edulis, the mucus produced presumably aiding transport through the gut. They suggested the strong amylase activity of the digestive gland may be responsible for preventing accumulation of mucus in the gut, thus easing digestive processes. Quantification of intestinal mucus was achieved by Calow (1974a), Kofoed (1975) and Edwards and Welsh (1982). Calow and Kofoed estimated gut mucus using a radiotracer technique. Calow estimated mucus to represent up to 20% of the faecal organics of the freshwater snails Ancylus Juviatilis and Planorbis contortus. Kofoed reported & 19% depending on food for the mud snail Hydrobia ventrosa. Edwards and Welsh allowed the mud snail Zlyanassa obsoleta to feed on an organic-free sediment, then transferred the snails to a petri-dish containing seawater to void faeces. Faecal pellets were collected by pipette and transferred to precombusted filters for drying and ashing to determine the organic component of the faeces. Assuming all the ash-free matter was mucus (which is incorrect as other organics are secreted into the gut, see Goddard and Hoggett, 1982), Edwards and Welsh found mucus to account for 8% of the organics in the faeces from a “normal” diet. A similar technique was employed on ascidians by Goddard and Hoggett (1982). They fed their animals diatomaceous earth\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n19\n\nthen dissected out each part of the gut and examined the contents for organic C and N. The quantification of pedal mucus from gastropods has been achieved in two ways. Either the mucus adhering to the foot is scraped off or the mucus is collected from the animal’s pedal trail. The former method was employed by Calow (1974b) who collected -5mg dry weight of mucus from 50 Lymnaea stugnalis. Calow’s technique was based on that of Wilson (1968) who removed the mouth of the shell of L. truncatula and “gently stroked” the head-foot with the bent end of a fine glass rod to remove 200-800 pg of hydrated mucus per snail. Calow also determined a calorific value for the mucus (24 kJ g-’). A similar collecting method was employed by Branch and Marsh (1978) who ran a “clean blade” over the foot of South African patellids to collect mean values of 0.50-1 1.47 mg hydrated mucus cm-2 of pedal sole. Horn (1986) used a glass rod to collect mucus from the foot of the chiton Chiton pelliserpentis after the animal had been adhering to a glass slide for 8 h. The collected mucus was then transferred to the slide for rinsing, drying and weighing. Kapeleta et al. (1996) collected the pedal (and dorsal) mucus from five species of terrestrial slug by moistening the epidermis in a high K + Ringer solution and then drawing a stainless steel spatula over the epidermis until mucus, in granule form, appeared as a “milky white fluid”. Kapeleta et al. calculated the mean number of granules contributing to the slugs’ trails as 0.58 x 106cm-2. Davies et ul. (1990a) and Davies (1993) measured mucus production of limpets by allowing animals to adhere to and move on glass plates for 6 h. At the end of this period, mucus was wiped from the sole using the rounded end of a pair of forceps and collected from the plate using a razor blade. A calorific value of 8.9 kJ g-’ was also determined. Mucus production rates should be regarded with caution as their magnitude can depend on when and from where animals were taken and on the environmental conditions at collection. Davies et al. (1990a) found pedal mucus production by Patella vulgata to be -230 pg dry weight h-’ for a limpet of 1g whole dry weight in saturated air. In seawater production was -70% of the rate in saturated air and -40% in air at 70% relative humidity (RH). Those animals in the low RH treatment did not move and so mucus production increased when animals were active. By assuming that limpets spend 12hd-’ in a low RH environment (stationary) and 12hd-’ in seawater (active), Davies et al. calculated that for a population (12.6 m-2) active whilst the tide is in during daylight (Hartnoll and Wright, 1977) at Derbyhaven, Isle of Man, pedal mucus production was 80 g m-2 year-’. Calculations such as these, based on many assumptions, should, of course, be regarded as very approximate. By allowing winkles to crawl over preweighed glass plates and estimating mucus production by subtraction, Davies et al. (1992b) similarly found that Littorinu littoreu produced\n\n20\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\n-35% less mucus in seawater than in saturated air (mucus production rate = 0.6 pg dry weight mm-' travelled for an animal of 0.5 g whole dry weight, energy content of mucus = 19kJg-') (Figure 5). Grimm-Jnrrgensen et ul. (1986) observed a similar phenomenon in the freshwater snail Fossuriu modicellu. Davies et al. (1990a, 1992b) suggested the phenomenon might be owing to the increased weight of emersed animals over immersed animals or to the lack of a diluent for mucus in air (the mucus may not be fully hydrated when secreted). For intertidal species, foraging when the tide is in will save energy as mucus production. This may not necessarily correlate with an increase in fitness, since foraging when the tide is in may have other energetic costs or be risky owing to the threat of dislodgement or predation. Nevertheless, mucus may still limit the distance over which it is profitable to search for food, especially when emersed. Smaller gastropods, which produce proportionately more mucus than larger ones (Davies, 1991; Navarro and Torrijos, 1995) may be particularly restricted, and this may possibly contribute to high juvenile mortality, particularly in limpets (Blackmore,\n\n.s C\n\na\n\na\n\n6\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nI\n\nj 0.8\n\n2\n\n1.o\n\n0\n\nLog,, whole animal dry weight (g\n\nFigure 5 Pedal mucus production during locomotion and associated energy loss for different-sized periwinkles, Littorina littorea, in saturated air (open circles) and in seawater (solid circles). (Redrawn after Davies et al., 1992b.)\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n21\n\n1969a; Bowman and Lewis, 1977). In one population of P . vulgata, pedal mucus production whilst immersed was found to vary by up to fivefold (from 50 to 221 pg dry weight h-' for a limpet of 1g whole dry weight), dependent on when, during a 22-month period, the animals were collected (Davies, 1993). Such variation is difficult to explain as no seasonal pattern was apparent. Mucus production also increased with shore height (a twofold increase) and with exposure to wave action (by 1 . 5 ~ )These . differences were attributed to differences in foraging behaviour since in situ foraging high on the shore and on exposed shores might be limited by exposure time (these populations feed when the tide covers them) and wave action, respectively, thus animals in the laboratory may have been moving, hence producing mucus, in opportune conditions. The plasticity of limpet behaviour, particularly that of P . vulgata, makes interpreting such information extremely difficult (see Hawkins and Hartnoll, 1983; Little, 1989). Peck et al. (1993) used a similar technique to that of Davies to quantify pedal mucus production by the Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna. They measured mucus production by allowing limpets (transported to the UK) to attach to weighed glass plates and reweighing the plates after the removal of the limpets and drying of the plates. Mucus production rates ranged from 0.49 to 1.87 mg dry mucus day-' for animals of 21.O-85.2 mg tissue AFDW; calorific value = 10.9kJg-'. Starvation of limpets for 5-7 weeks prior to experimentation reduced mucus production rates by 61%, despite locomotory activity being increased. Peck et al. also noted that mucus produced whilst attaching amounted to 80% of the mucus secreted in a 24-h period. For stationary P . vulgata in an aerial environment, the amount of mucus produced did not increase after the first lOmin of a 6-h period (Davies, 1993). These results suggest that mucus can retain its functional capability (adhesive properties) over periods of hours and that there are long periods during which the pedal secretory apparatus is inactive. Data on mucus production by tropical gastropods are notably lacking, although two studies have been performed. Davies and Williams (1995), using the technique of Davies et al. (1990a), measured pedal mucus production by stationary Cellana grata, a tropical limpet, as 3.8 mg dry weight over a 30-min period for an animal of 1g dry flesh weight (mucus calorific value = 10.8 kJ g-'). Locomotory production was also assessed (from 2.1 to 15.2pg dry weight mm-' for animals from 0.139-0.891 g dry flesh weight) by allowing animals to crawl up a glass plate inclined at 60\" which was constantly sprayed with seawater. Mucus was scraped from the plates using a razor blade. Davies and Williams (1997) similarly recorded mucus production rates for the pulmonate limpets Siphonariajaponica, S. Sirius and S. atra. Siphonaria japonica (2.7pg dry mucus produced per millimetre moved for an animal of 0.1 g whole dry weight) produced more mucus when active than did S. atra (0.97pg dry mucus produced per milli-\n\n22\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\nmetre moved for an animal of 0.1 g whole dry weight), although the mucus of S. japonica had a lower calorific value (5.6 kJ g-’) than did the pooled mucus of S. atra and S. Sirius (9.1 kJ g-I), perhaps indicating a trade-off between the quantity of mucus produced and its calorific value. Stationary S. atra and S. Sirius produced mucus at rates over a 10-min period which were not significantly different (mean = 55 pg dry weight for an animal of 0.1 g whole dry weight). Several workers have estimated production of mucus by examining trails. Calow (1972) scraped the mucus trails of Ancylus fluviatilis and Planorbis contortus from the sides of 2 1 vessels. He then isolated the mucus by filtration through a 0.8 pm pore filter and weighed the residue (mean production = 0.21 mg dry weight d-’ for 50 A.fluviatilis and 0.18 mg dry weight day-’ for 50 P. contortus). A similar method was employed by Gonzalez et al. (1990) in determining pedal mucus production by Concholepas concholepas. Navarro and Torrijos (1995) scraped pedal mucus from the walls of glass vessels in which C. concholepas had been crawling. Pedal mucus was produced at a rate of 0.7mg dry weight h-’ for an animal of log dry flesh weight and was converted to a calorific value (6.9 kJ g-’) using data from Gonzalez et al. (1990) for this species. Kideys (1991) used a similar technique, scraping the pedal mucus produced by the whelk Buccinum undatum from the sides of tanks. Mucus was produced at a rate of -2 mg dry weight h-’ for an animal of log dry whole weight at 8°C. Mucus production at higher temperatures (up to 15OC) was slightly greater, but generally pedal mucus was produced at only half the rate of hypobrancial mucus in this species. Iwasaki (1992) collected both trail and “stationary” mucus from the limpet Cellana toreuma by scraping mucus from glass slides to which the animals had attached or moved over in running seawater in order to determine protein content (see Section 2). Richardson (1975) allowed the terrestrial snail Cepaea nemoralis to crawl over a preweighed aluminium mesh and then dried, weighed and determined the calorific value of the resulting mucus film (14kJg-’) (mean production rate = 1.61mg dry mucus individual-’ d-’ ). Peduzzi and Herndl (1991) used a similar technique for Patella caerulea and Monodonta turbinata, replacing aluminium foil each hour, over 24 h This technique may have overestimated mucus production: for “average sized” P. caerulea, 12.27mg dry mucus individual-’ d-’; M. turbinata, 5.58 mg dry mucus individual-’ d-’. Denny (1980a) measured the length and the thickness (10-20pm) of the mucus trail of Ariolimax columbianus using the method of Lissman (1945) which involves freezing the mucus in absolute alcohol. Denny and Gosline (1980) collected A . columbianus pedal mucus by allowing the slug to crawl around a rotating glass rod. This technique produced 0.1-0.3 ml of mucus from each slug. Edwards and Welsh (1982) allowed Ilyanassa obsoleta to crawl across a combusted sediment in filtered seawater. The mucus trail produced was then dried and\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n23\n\nashed before weighing (mean weight = 21.8 pgcm-2 of trail). Siddall(l984) collected the trail mucus of the conch Strombus gigas after groups at different densities were allowed to crawl for 7.3 h in a crystallizing dish filled with filtered seawater. The mucus was removed and dry weighed after being stabilized (using cetylpridimium chloride) to ease handling and stained with Evans blue. Siddall found that the rate of mucus production per centimetre travelled increased significantly at high population densities, although no explanation for this was proposed. Culley and Sherman (1985) and Peck et al. (1987) both used the same technique for estimating trail mucus production by Huliotis tuberculuta, the former to determine the effect of substratum particle size on mucus production (an exponential relationship of the form y = ax b ,where y = mucus production rate and x = substratum particle size) and the latter in the construction of an energy budget. In each case ormers (abalones) were placed in large preweighed crystallizing dishes filled with filtered seawater. After 24 h the animals were removed and the dishes rinsed in distilled water to remove seawater and faeces before drying to constant weight. Mucus production values were obtained by subtraction. Peck et al. (1987) removed some of the mucus and burned it in a calorimeter to yield an energy value (23 kJ g-'). The quantification of mucus production from gastropod epithelial surfaces other than the pedal sole, hypobranchial gland and gut has been neglected but these could prove to be sites of considerable mucus production. Much variation is evident in the quantities of mucus produced by different molluscs, although they are usually of a considerable amount. However, comparison is hindered by the non-uniformity in the units in which mucus production is expressed.\n\n5. FUNCTIONS OF MUCUS\n\nThe uses to which mucus is put are varied. Mucus is a highly complex product whose uses far outstrip that of a simple friction-reducer. Nevertheless it is an energy-rich product (see Section 6) and so is likely to be a product which is conserved. Here we list the broad functions of use to the producer of the mucus. 5.1. Locomotion\n\nThe importance of mucus in molluscan locomotion has been recognized since Barr (1926) found Milax sowerbii was incapable of movement once its pedal gland had been cauterized. Denny (1980b) reported that owing to\n\n24\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\nmucus production the cost of locomotion in crawling molluscs is greater than locomotion in any other animal. In gastropods, mucus, usually from the anterior pedal gland (see Gainey, 1976; Grenon and Walker, 1978; Shirbhate and Cook, 1987), secreted as a thin layer (10-20pm, Denny, 1980a) between gastropod foot and the substratum can function in locomotion in two ways. It can act as a medium in which pedal cilia beat to propel the animal (Miller, 1974), for example, in the sediment dwellers Hydrobia ulvae and Cassis ruberosa (Hughes, 1986). The mucus can alternatively act to couple the force exerted by the pedal muscles to the substratum for those groups (e.g. patellids, littorinids) which require a firm grip on the substratum (Miller, 1974; Branch and Marsh, 1978). The mucus acts as a sticky adhesive which extends the range of these groups to vertical faces and overhangs (see Branch and Marsh, 1978; Grenon and Walker, 1978) and is important in reducing predation by seabirds which attempt to prise marine gastropods and polyplacophorans from their substrata (Hahn and Denny, 1989). The way in which this coupling facilitates both locomotion and adhesion is described by various authors (e.g. Jones and Trueman, 1970; Miller, 1974; Branch, 1981; Denny, 1981, 1989). The properties of mucus which allow this form of locomotion are described by Denny (1983) (see Section 3). Whatever the mechanics of molluscan crawling, mucus is lost from its producer and is laid down as a characteristic trail. It may be thought that the work of Barr (1926) demonstrated the necessity of mucus for gastropod locomotion. However, lack of locomotion in Milax sowerbii may have been a stress response and although the mechanism of locomotion and the production of mucus have undoubtedly co-evolved, many creeping organisms (e.g. annelids) can propel themselves using muscular waves without the need for the production of a mucus. It is our contention therefore that the employment of mucus in locomotion has been successful, since it allows organisms to occupy verticals and overhangs which hitherto were inaccessible habitats. Thus the adhesive properties of mucus are an essential part of the locomotory mechanisms of many molluscs, and the mechanisms may have adapted to accommodate those adhesive properties. The freshwater bivalve Corbiculafluminae has been shown to use mucus in locomotion by extruding mucus from its inhalant siphon until the hydrodynamic drag generated is sufficient to “balloon” the animal downstream (Prezant and Chalermwat, 1984). Reports of similar behaviour in marine molluscs are common. Microscopic mucus threads are exuded, usually in combination with byssus threads, to enable a brief planktonic existence for numerous post-larval bivalves including Mytilus edulis (Sigurdsson et al., 1976; Lane et al., 1985; Beukema and de Was, 1989) and Cerastoderma edule (de Montaudouin, 1997). Martel and Chia (1991a) confirmed empirically that the gastropods Barleeia spp., Tricoliapulloides and juveniles of Nucella emarginata and Littorina sitkana all exhibit drifting using a mucus thread or\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n25\n\nthreads. The phenomenon has been studied in more detail in gastropods of the genus Lacuna which secrete pedal mucus and raise the sole of the foot to release the mucus produced which then extends to between 50 and 160 x the shell length, depending on animal size. The mucus then acts as a drogue to disperse the animals and has been observed to aid settlement by becoming entangled in algae. The mucus thread reduces the sinking rate of the gastropods by up to four times (Martel and Chia, 1991b). Such post-metamorphic drifting may aid dispersal and enable individuals to escape from an unfavourable habitat: Abelson et al. (1994) give a good account of the hydrodynamics involved in mucus-thread transport and its implications for settlement. Indeed Martel and Diefenbach (1993) observed higher rates of drifting behaviour (3-5x) in juvenile Lacuna vincta and L. variegata maintained in an unfavourable environment (without macroalgae) as compared to a favourable environment (with macroalgae). Octopod larvae of several species from Hawaii are thought to use a similar mucus drogue, secreted from integumental pores, for dispersal (Young et al., 1989).\n\n5.2. Mucus Trails\n\nThe complex topography of gastropod habitats, where visual tracking may be difficult, has been suggested to explain the use of pedal mucus trails (Figure 6) as an aid to navigation (Denny, 1989). Trail-following behaviour\n\nFigure 6 Mucus trails of the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus, visible owing to adhesion of fine sedimentary particles.\n\n26\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\nmay also have evolved at least in part as a means of recycling energy-rich mucus (Connor, 1986, Davies et al., 1992a) and a mechanism of producing efficient foraging by speeding aggregation on patchy resources (see Hawkins and Hartnoll, 1983; Deneubourg et al., 1988). Individuals may follow their own mucus trails to home (Funke, 1968; Cook et al., 1969; Cook, 1971; Cook and Cook, 1975; Cook, 1977; McFarlane, 1980, 1981; Chelazzi et al., 1983, 1985, 1987; Chelazzi, 1990; Della Santina, 1994; see Cook, 1979 for review of earlier work), those of conspecifics to aggregate (perhaps for protection), and often to mate (Moulton, 1962; Breen, 1973; Townsend, 1974; Lowe and Turner, 1976; Trott, 1978; Trott and Dimock, 1978; Hirano and Inaba, 1980; Bretz and Dimock, 1983; Cook, 1985; Wareing, 1986; Chelazzi et al., 1985, 1988; Branch and Barkai, 1987; Chelazzi, 1990; Cook, 1992; Erlandsson and Kostylev, 1995) and those of other species to find prey (Paine, 1963; Gonor, 1965; Blair and Seapy, 1972; Murray and Lewis, 1974; Cook, 1985; Carte and Faulkner, 1986; Cimino and Sodano, 1989). The locomotory force applied is reduced in trail-following (“tracker”) snails in comparison to “marker” snails (Tankersley, 1989). Thus trail following may reduce the metabolic energy required for locomotion (Hall, 1973), although the energy cost of mucus production in locomotion has been found to be 35x that of the metabolic energy cost of locomotion (Davies et al., 1992b) and Cook (1992) found that the quantity of mucus produced by Limax pseudojlavus (terrestrial slug) in following its own mucus trail was the same as for the original deposition of mucus. The speed of Zlyanassa obsoleta is unchanged when it traverses conspecific mucus trails (up to four trails thick) in comparison to a substratum of sand (Dimock, 1985) but Littorina irrorata increases its speed over mucus trails in comparison to sand (Hall, 1973). L. littorea also increases its speed over trails in comparison to glass in both mating and non-mating seasons (Erlandsson and Kostylev, 1995), although this is not owing to the presence of mucus directly facilitating a faster locomotion. Since mucus trails may both stabilize the substratum and produce a smoother surface over which to move, some species may reduce the amount of mucus produced whilst trail-following. Surface topography has been shown to determine the amount of mucus required for locomotion (Culley and Sherman, 1985). Further studies are necessary to determine whether gastropods can save energy in this way. The mechanism by which gastropods can detect the presence and polarity of a mucus trail is, however, poorly understood. The presence of a physical cue in the mucus has been suggested by Simkiss and Wilbur (1977), Bretz and Dimock (1983) and Stirling and Hamilton (1986) and the filaments found in mucus trails (see Section 4) may provide this cue. Both Simkiss and Wilbur (1977) and Bretz and Dimock (1983) noted that the filaments were frayed at their ends furthest from the animal laying the trail. The presence of a chemical cue in the mucus, perhaps as a volatile chemical\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n27\n\nwhose concentration can indicate the age - and perhaps direction - of the trail, has been suggested by Hall (1973), Gilley and Swenson (1978), Bousfield et al. (1981) and Raftery (1983). Stirling and Hamilton (1986) showed that a polarity cue persisted in the mucus trails of Littorina irrorata for at least 60 min in air. Calculations by Denny (1989) showed that for a volatile substance to be involved in the detection mechanism, the snails must detect concentration gradients less than M mm-l, which seems unlikely. However, an initial testing of the trail over distances of several centimetres (as is done by L. irrorata, Hall, 1973) would greatly reduce the need for such sensitivity. Robbins and Hamilton (1996) have shown that trailfollowing and detection of trail polarity by L. irrorata is dependent on the presence of intact cephalic tentacles. 5.3. Feeding\n\nProbably the most extensively studied molluscan feeding system is the filtering mechanism in bivalves. Here food particles are trapped by the gills, bound in mucus and transported along ciliated tracts to the labial palps for sorting and eventually to the mouth (Yonge, 1949; Bayne et al., 1976; Morton, 1983, see Purchon, 1977 for review). The role of mucus in this process was only inferred until endoscopy revealed that mucus was important in intact, as opposed to opened and thus stressed animals (Beninger et al., 1991,1992 and Tankersley and Dimock, 1993). Ward et al. (1993) and Beninger et al. (1993) examined particle transport in situ by endoscopy and confirmed that mucociliary action (the propulsion of particles bound in mucus by cilia) transports filtered material to the ventral ctenidial margin and thence along ciliated grooves. Although mucus plays a critical role in this process, the finer points of its function are still in the process of being understood, and are likely to be clarified using the endoscope as a tool combined with histology or confocal microscopy. Some of this mucus is ingested with the food, indeed Beninger and Le Pennec (1993) found evidence that particles suspended in water alone are not ingested. Mucus is also employed by bivalves to cleanse the mantle cavity of uningested particles. These pseudofaeces are bound in mucus and ejected through the inhalant aperture (Yonge, 1926,1949; Barnes, 1980; Bayne and Newell, 1983, Ward et al., 1993). Beninger et al. (1995) concluded that since pseudofaeces are not produced from the ventral particle groove of the gill (Beninger et al., 1993; Ward et al., 1993), pseudofaecal mucus must originate on the labial palps, which certainly contain enough mucocytes for this to be true (Beninger et al., 1995; Beninger and St-Jean, 1997a; Beninger et al., 1997a). Beninger et al. (1995) noted in Mytilus edulis that while the palps were in an inclined position mainly acid-dominant secretions will be discharged but while in an erect\n\n28\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\nposition mainly neutral secretions will be discharged, and this was presented as evidence for the function of the palps in particle selection. Using Crassostrea virginica fed on Tetraselmis suecica, Newell and Jordan (1983) showed that energy, carbon and nitrogen in the pseudofaeces were all reduced compared to that in the food and their results suggested that this oyster can select particles of differing types for ingestion and rejection. Newell and Jordan hypothesized that this is achieved by a chemosensory mechanism acting on particles which have been freed from mucus. This may be achieved by the lowering of the viscosity of the mucus through the beating of labial cilia (Ward et al., 1994). This hypothesis has yet to be confirmed, but future endoscopy may provide the necessary information. Beninger et al. (1997b) give evidence that food particles are transported in mucus “rafts” (10-25 pm thick) which are propelled by the tips of cilia and which sit atop the periciliary space that contains a medium less viscous than the mucus but more viscous than the surrounding water, and suggest a twolayer model of mucociliary transport. For an earlier and fuller discussion of the propulsion of mucus by cilia see Sleigh (1989). Given the amount of pseudofaecal release (see, e.g. Bayne and Newell, 1983; Hbral et al., 1983), the amount of mucus in pseudofaeces is likely to be energetically costly. Bivalves such as Macoma balthica (Taghon, 1982) may also use mucus whilst deposit feeding. It is presumably secreted by the inhalant siphon, and preferentially adheres to organic, rather than inorganic particles in the sediment, whereby the former are selected for ingestion. Connor and Quinn (1984) and Connor (1986) suggested that pedal mucus might serve a nutritional role for territorial grazing gastropods and is ingested after acting as a trap and possible fertilizer for food. These authors showed that the growth of microalgae (a component of the diet) was enhanced in the presence of the pedal mucus of the homing limpets Lottia gigantea and Collisella (Macclintockia) scabra, but not in the presence of mucus from the non-homing limpet Collisella (Tectura) digitalis, nor that of the carnivore Nucella emarginata. They also showed that trail mucus persisted from 4 to 15d, depending on species and position on the shore, and suggested that this time was sufficient to allow for ingestion of mucus. Davies et al. (1992a) showed that the mucus produced by Patella vulgatu persisted for up to 80d (Figure 7) and could similarly trap microalgae, especially diatoms (Figure 8), particularly in the first 24 h of exposure. Davies and Williams (1995), however, found that the pedal mucus of the tropical limpet Cellana grata persisted for only 6 d and the mucus trapped microalgae (with a peak at 4 d of exposure), but only marginally better than bare surfaces. Santelices and Bobadilla (1996) demonstrated that the pedal mucus of Chilean gastropods trapped microalgal particles in the laboratory and microalgal and macroalgal particles in the field, again showing that more algal material was collected after a shorter exposure period (1 h)\n\n29\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n100\n\nLittorina littorea\n\n80\n\n60 40 n\n\nE 20 at c, c en\n\n.

Persistence is recorded by allowing animals to crawl over a Perspex (Plexiglass) plate that is marked into cells. The plate is then dipped into a suspension of graphite and the graphite adheres to the mucus. The plate is then placed onshore and monitored as graphite is removed from the cells (presumably along with mucus) by wave action. Mucus persists for the order of weeks: limpet mucus for about twice as long as periwinkle mucus. The rapid loss of mucus from one plate for each species was attributed to its position in a microhabitat prone to siltation. (Redrawn after Davies et al., 1992a.)\n\n30\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J.

Interestingly, these authors also suggested that pedal mucus might be useful as a device to trap algal spores in intertidal environments with the aim of documenting changes of spore abundance in the water. No direct evidence for the ingestion of mucus trails\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n31\n\nhas, however, been shown, although individual Hydrobia ulvae have been observed to ingest their own pedal mucus which is used to trap organic material as the animals float in the water between ripple marks on the beach (Fenchel et al., 1975; Newell, 1979). Given the density of molluscan grazers on many shores, the production rates of trail mucus, the persistence of the mucus and the trail-following habit of many species, it is likely that trail mucus does fulfil a provendering role, albeit perhaps serendipitously. Pedal mucus may be a preferential food for, for example, littorinids or amphipods, in habitats where levels of nutrient-rich detritus are low. It would pay grazers to know when, after laying a trial, is the optimum time in terms of the nutritional content of the trail to ingest it. In addition, evolutionarily stable strategy theory predicts that if grazers are adding a factor to the trail to promote attachment of, or growth of, food particles then such grazers would be territorial (Davies et al., 1992a). The evidence that grazing species have evolved to exploit their mucus trails for feeding is circumstantial and the area would benefit from further research, particularly in species which maintain “gardens” (see Branch et al., 1992). The ingestion of mucus has also been shown in the terrestrial slugs Ariolimax columbianus (Richter, 1980) and Limax maximus (Denny, 1989). Suspension feeding using a mesh of mucus (to filter) or curtain of mucus (to adhere) small food particles from the water column is common in adult (see Yonge, 1928; Morton, 1951; Walsby, 1975; Graham, 1985; Fretter and Graham, 1994) and larval gastropods (Hamner et al., 1975). Gilmer (1972) observed unsupported mucus webs of up to -2m diameter produced by planktonic opisthobranchs Gleba cordata and Corolla spectabilis, which are -50mm in length. The mucus is produced from mucus glands along the periphery of the wing plate and when entangled with food is moved, using ciliary action, into the mouth. Several sessile species use mucus nets or bags (Jerrgensen, 1966) where porous sheets of mucus are held extended into flowing water before being hauled into the mouth (e.g. Bithynia tentaculata, Schafer, 1952; Olivella columellaris, von Seilacher, 1959; Gadinalia nivea, Walsby et al., 1973; Dendropoma maximum Hughes and Lewis, 1974; Barnes, 1980; Serpulorbis squamigerus, Nelson, 1980). Other species, such as Crepidula fornicata (Orton, 1912, 1914; Barnes, 1980) and Trimusculus reticulatus (Walsby, 1975) secrete a mucus net across their inhalant aperture to catch food particles (Hughes, 1986). Umbonium species, turritellids, vermetids and some capulids (Orton, 1912; Yonge, 1938) capture food particles on their gills (see Hughes, 1986) before the food is transported to the mouth in mucus strings. Many naticid gastropods also use mucus for feeding purposes, coating their prey in mucus to prevent its escape (Kohn, 1983). During the capture of Umbonium vestiarium by Natica gualteriana the latter secretes (presumably from the foot) mucus into the former’s aperture (Savazzi and Reyment,\n\n32\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\n1989). This action appears to have no detrimental effect on U.vestiarium save that it prevents it from emerging from its shell and thus is quiescent while the naticid drills into it. Savazzi and Reyment concluded that that the mucus acts in a chemical, rather than physical manner in preventing the emergence of the prey. Mucus is involved in the drilling activity of numerous gastropods (Carriker, 1981), but its role is uncertain. Mucus is also used by deposit-feeding scaphopods. The secretions of gland cells located at the head of captacula were thought to be involved in prey capture as a toxin (Morton, 1959) and adhesion (Shimek, 1988), but are now thought to aid the passage of food particles along ciliated tracts (Byrum and Ruppert, 1994) in a fashion similar to that in bivalves. 5.4. Protection\n\nThe use of mucus to isolate an animal from its environment, or to actively counter some facet of environment is common in marine Mollusca and it is perhaps here that mucus is most diverse in function. Mucus is produced from most molluscan epithelia (Simkiss and Wilbur, 1977), acts as a barrier to diffusion (Grimm-Jnrrgensen et al., 1986) and may function in selective ion transport (Ahn et al., 1988). Gastropod epithelial mucus is often a first line of defence and has been shown to reduce exposure to physical stress and predation. Wilson (1929), Bingham (1972), Morris et al. (1980), Denny (1984), McMahon and Britton (1985), Britton (1995) and Davies and Hawkins (pers obs.) have noted the habit of littorinids and amphissids of attaching themselves to vertical rock using a strand of pedal mucus as a glue between substratum and shell. The animal’s head is then retracted behind the operculum. This behaviour is thought to render the animal less susceptible to desiccation and overheating. By secreting a veil of mucus (which then dries to form a wall) between shell and substratum, the limpets Acmaea (Tectura) digitalis, A. (Macclintockia) scabra and A. persona can reduce desiccation stress (Wolcott, 1973). A similar phenomenon occurs in terrestrial snails which secrete a CaC03/ mucus matrix across the shell aperture which dries to form a water-tight seal (e.g. Helix aspersa, Otala lactea, Sphincterochila boisseri, Machin, 1967; Schmidt-Nielsen et al., 1971). Mucus has also been implicated in protecting antarctic limpets from extreme cold (Hargens and Shabica, 1973). The role of mucus in fish as a barrier to pollution has been extensively studied (Shephard, 1994), but in molluscs this has not been directly assessed. However, excess mucus production by bivalves after exposure to heavy metals (Lakshmanan and Nambisan, 1985; Moraes and Silva, 1995; Sunila, 1987; Hietanen et al., 1988; Sze and Lee, 1995) and hydrocarbons (Axiak and George, 1987) has been reported; and excess pedal (Mills et al.,\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n33\n\n1990) and intestinal (Triebskorn, 1989; Triebskorn and Ebert, 1989) mucus production by slugs in response to metaldehyde (a molluscicide) has been observed. Davies (1992) described a reduction in pedal mucus production in limpets, Patella vulgata, exposed to single heavy metals, although this reduction was probably owing to an accompanying lack of activity. Mucus can function in predator avoidance by rendering the gastropod distasteful and/ or toxic (e.g. the dorsal secretions of Doriopsilla albopunctata, Reel and Fuhrman, 1981 and Phyllidia varricosa, Johannes, 1963; the hypobranchial mucus of Calliostoma canaliculatum (pers. comm., N. Smaby); the secretions of the mantle edge in Cellana spp., Branch and Branch, 1980); by anaesthetizing the predator (Trimusculus reticulatus, Rice, 1985); by fouling the predator’s feeding apparatus (e.g. Ariolimax columbianus, Richter, 1980); or by making the animal too slippery to handle (e.g. Calliostoma species, Sellers, 1977; Harrold, 1982). Handling of molluscs can also induce copious mucus secretion (e.g. Buccinum undatum, Strombus gigas pers. obs.), as can tissue disruption upon dissection (e.g. Milax sowerbii, Barr, 1926; Archidoris pseudoargus, McCance and Masters, 1937). Interestingly, some nudibranchs are able to sequester poisons from their food which subsequently emerge in their mucus, providing a defence for these molluscs which cannot retreat into a shell. Indeed the evolution of loss of shell in this group may well have coincided with the ability to use mucus in a defensive capacity. Poisons or deterrents will probably all emerge with mucus, but few studies have specifically recognized this. Examples include: Avila et al. (1991) who observed that Hypselodoris webbi secretes the allomone longifolin (an ichthyodeterrent) in its dorsal mucus, the allomone originating in the sponge Dysidea fragilis; Paul et al. (1990) who observed that Nembrotha spp. secrete tambjamines (ichthyodeterrents from the ascidian Atapozoa sp.) in their mucus; Gustafson and Andersen (1985) who discovered terpenoids from sponges, bryozoans and coelenterates in the mucus of Archidoris montereyensis and Anisodoris nobilis. The African land snail Achatinu fulica produces an agglutinin (lectin) in its mucus (Iguchi et al., 1985) which is a 70 000 MW glycoprotein (Mitra et al., 1988). Lectin activity has also been reported for the mucus of the terrestrial gastropods Arion empiricorium (Habets et al., 1979), Helix aspersa (Fountain and Campbell, 1984; Fountain, 1985) and Archachatina marginuta (Okotore and Nwakanma, 1986). Astley and Ratcliffe (1989) examined the mucus of some species of marine mollusc but could find no lectins, although they were present in the epithelial mucus of Loligo vulgaris (Marthy, 1974). Whilst these discoveries present numerous potential roles for mucus (slug mucus is apparently used in some human therapy, Habets et al., 1979), it may be that the lectin has no function other than structural within the mucus matrix (Fountain, 1982). McDade and Tripp (1967) recorded the presence of lysozyme in oyster mucus and hypothesized that\n\n34\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\nthis formed an antimicrobial defence, although lysozyme may merely prolong the functional life of the mucus by slowing down bacterial breakdown. Kubota et al. (1985) purified a glycoprotein (“achatin”, 140 000 MW) from the pedal mucus of Achatina fulica which showed no lysozyme activity but did kill both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by acting on cytoplasmic membranes (Otsuka-Fuchino et al., 1992). The use of mucus as a carrier for these compounds provides an unstirred layer on the surface of the animal in which the compounds can be held and prevents them from dispersing in an aquatic environment (Denny, 1989). Bakus et al. (1986) reviewed the chemical ecology of marine organisms and whilst they rarely mentioned mucus it is likely that mucus is employed as a carrier of secretable chemicals in most of the taxa they describe. The functioning of limpet pedal mucus in limpet tenacity (to prevent dislodgement by, for example, predation) is a subject of debate. Smith (1991, 1992) concludes that a glue-like adhesion is responsible for the great tenacities observed in limpets by Grenon and Walker (1981) and Denny (1984), although whether this glue is related to, or is part of, mucus is not clear. It may be that these tenacities are is not a product of a glue or mucus at all, but are owing to a very flexible muscular foot which can effectively mirror, and hence grip, the microscale contours of substrata. This would explain the way in which limpets can increase their tenacity when disturbed. Davies and Case (1997) who studied the tenacity of two littorinid species, concluded that “muscular grip” does not play a role in adhesion. They suggested that the mechanism of adhesion in these animals involves mucus. Grenon and Walker (1982) measured the thickness (3 pm) of the mucus layer under the foot of Patella vulgata after it had been attaching to an alga for 2d. Grenon and Walker suggested that adhesion was afforded by the thinness of the layer (cf. Branch and Marsh, 1978) caused by the slow uptake of water and mucus from the sole of the foot by epithelial cells, a mechanism proposed by Zylstra (1972) and Machin (1975). Cephalopods also use mucus in escape from predators. Their “ink”, squirted at predators to confuse them is bound with mucus to prevent its rapid dispersion in water (Denny, 1989). 5.5. Other Functions\n\nMucus, by virtue of its properties, is often thought of as a lubricant (Simkiss and Wilbur, 1977; Simkiss, 1988), but a more careful examination of its viscoelastic properties (e.g. Denny, 1983; see Section 3) would suggest that this is not the case and if anything is sticky, acting as a glue to retard phenomena rather than promoting their rate of activity. However, mucus may act protectively to ease the passage of particles through the gut of\n\n35\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\ngastropod (Edwards and Welsh, 1982) and bivalve (Bayne and Hawkins, 1990) molluscs. Some bullomorph opisthobranchs move through sediments by ciliary action in a tube of mucus, but the mucus can also act both as a lanyard should the slug fall from its tube and as a camouflage as it collects small particles owing to its adhesive nature (Rudman, 1971). The Silurian burrowing bivalve Nionia prisca was thought to use mucus to line an inhalant tube in the sediment (Liljedahl, 1992). Pedal mucus can also act as a buoyancy device for aquatic transportation. In pelagic prosobranchs, such as Janthina, a sticky raft of bubbles is produced which also serves as protection for eggs (Barnes, 1980). When the limpet Helcion pellucidurn is dislodged, a mucus “sail” is produced which gives the animal sufficient lift to recolonize its habitat (Vahl, 1983), a function overlapping with dispersal (see above). Lindberg and Dwyer (1983) reported patellid mucus to be important in home scar formation where it etches the substratum, forming a template for radular erosion. Theisen (1972) and Jones (1984) observed a shell-cleaning action by the foot of the bivalve Mytilus edulis and the top-shell Calliostoma zizyphinum respectively, and suggested pedal mucus is important in keeping the shell free from epibionts. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that this mucus - including the epibionts which its traps - is ingested (pers. obs.). This area needs further investigation since the mucus might have useful antifouling attributes. Mucus is, of course, also present in the larvae of molluscs where complex arrangements of mucocytes have been shown (e.g. Cranfield, 1973; Lane and Nott, 1975). The pedal mucus produced by bivalve larvae may play a role in locomotion and substratum selection (Cranfield, 1973; Hermans, 1983).In pteropod larvae and prosobranch veligers mucus feeding nets have been observed (see Hamner et al., 1975).\n\n6. MUCUS IN MOLLUSCAN ENERGY BUDGETS\n\nPhysiological energetics is concerned with the study of the gains and losses of energy at the level of the individual. This can then be scaled up to the population level. Such studies are geared towards producing values for the terms in, and then balancing, the equation:\n\n+\n\nC = Pg iP,. R iF iU\n\nwhere C = consumption, Pg = somatic growth, P, = reproductive investment, R = respiration, F = faeces and U = excretion. This is a standard International Biological Programme (IBP) equation and is a transformation of that offered by Petrusewicz (1967). The equation describes the net energy\n\n36\n\nM.S. DAVIES AND S.J. HAWKINS\n\nexchange in the individual organism following the laws of thermodynamics and assuming steady-state conditions (Bayne and Newell, 1983). Carefully constructed energy budgets for populations can help to produce an understanding of energy transfer in ecosystems (ecological energetics). Such budgets constructed for intertidal grazer or carnivore species (see Wright and Hartnoll, 1981; Bayne and Newell, 1983; Hawkins and Hartnoll, 1983; Hawkins et al., 1992 for reviews) can show the importance of these species in terms of energy flow within the littoral community, although energy budgets must be interpreted with caution, since specific budgets rely on a specific set of assumptions used in compiling them. The position of mucus in the equation is a matter of disagreement. Although defining U as excreta, Bayne and Newell (1983) then included the secretion of mucus in this term. Hawkins and Hartnoll (1983) noted this error and mentioned an alternative position of mucus in the equation, as part of production. Richardson (1975), Branch (1981) and Horn (1986) argued that secreted mucus is derived from assimilated (physiologically useful) energy and is therefore a part of production (as P, or P,,,,). Hawkins and Hartnoll (1983) suggested an “9’(secretions) term to embrace urine (Su),mucus (S,), dissolved organic matter (SdJ and exuviae (S,) secretions. Peck (1983) used S to represent mucus production, preferring to separate it from both P and (I. Johannes and Satomi (1967), Calow and Fletcher (1972) and Edwards and Welsh (1982) noted that mucus production may also contribute to the F term, along with other metabolic products such as digestive enzymes. We propose that mucus be separated to its own term, M , both for correctness and to emphasize its importance in the energy budget. In doing so, mucus is freed from the other terms and so can be incorporated independently into terms such as assimilation (A = P R M). Unless stated otherwise, M should include all mucus secretions be they pedal, faecal, or from any other epithelial surface. This was the approach adopted in various studies (Peck et al., 1987; Davies et al., 1990a, 1992b; Kideys and Hartnoll, 1991), although Bayne and Hawkins (1990) and Hawkins and Bayne (1992) preferred to further divide mucus by its origins (faecal, pseudofaecal) in their analyses of bivalve energy balance. However, in most molluscan energy budgets mucus has been either ignored (e.g. Hughes, 1970, 1971; Baluyut, 1977; Bayne and Widdows, 1978; Barkai and Griffiths, 1988; Carefoot, 1989; Wilbur and Hilbish, 1989) or relegated to the U term which is then regarded as negligible or given an arbitrarily low figure (e.g. Huebner and Edwards, 1981; Wright and Hartnoll, 1981; Lucas, 1982; Hartnoll, 1983; Davis and Wilson, 1985). (See Branch, 1981; Hawkins and Hartnoll, 1983 for reviews.) The omission of mucus can arise because many workers measure C, P and R and balance the energy equation by assuming that C - (P R) represents the unassimilated ration (Mann, 1969). The lack of the incorporation of mucus is probably\n\n+ +\n\n+\n\nMUCUS FROM MARINE MOLLUSCS\n\n37\n\nowing to an underestimation of the role of mucus in energy flow coupled with the paucity of data on its production as a result of inherent technical difficulties in its measurement; although an appreciation of its importance is not new and was commented on by Paine (1971). Numerous workers have made estimates of mucus production by difference, i.e., by measurin"
