Equally at home singing the Great American Songbook, musical theater, and contemporary rock and pop, she has quickly become one of the most notable voices to emerge in the vibrant Minneapolis music scene, being hailed for her joy-filled performances and her “fun, human, beautiful, interpretations.” (Levi Weinhagen)\n\nIn 2023, she released her sophomore album About Last Night which garnered much critical attention from fans and music critics in the Twin Cities, especially from Jazz88 FM, where she’s become a regular in-studio guest. She’s recorded with the band Viewers Like You and performed alongside Twin Cities legends including Jeremy Messersmith, Joyann Parker, and Patty Peterson. Vincent is poised for the national spotlight, mixing jazz standards, vintage blues, and her own fresh originals.\n\nOnstage at History Theatre: Buddy!

Spanning St. Paul to Nashville to Broadway to the UK, Jen’s career has led to performing with the Star of the North Jazz Orchestra, creating her own monthly cabaret at MetroNome Brewing, and continuing to follow her heart - which lies in musical theatre. Being part of Mamma Mia!, playing Donna, Rosie, and Tanya on the Broadway stage and in five subsequent productions is just one of the pieces of Jen's Musical Theatre pie... History Theatre has also been a huge part of Jen’s life, and one of her favorite spaces to play -- nine shows in just 15 years. Whether pop or jazz, rock or musical theatre, Jen’s warmth and connection to the material drives her performance. Pioneer Press raves, “Jen Burleigh-Bentz packs vocal and emotional power into her version of songs.\" Jen has been featured in many recordings over the years, performed with Jim Brickman on national tours and here in her hometown, and with Orchestras across the nation."
