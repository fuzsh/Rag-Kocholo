        "text": "There are some amazing artists tonight, but I'm gonna start with my personal favorite of the bunch, and he's not even headlining. Tonight, Minnesota singer/songwriter Jeremy Messersmith returns for his first time in a few years, supporting Eric Hutchinson. Obviously, as headliner, Hutchinson is spectacular in his own right, but Messersmith is the bee's knees, and I think you'd be wise to get to Solana Beach early to catch him open the show. Of course, there are other great shows. Dawes are back in town with their first show at the Observatory, pop-punk band Real Friends headline at the Irenic and Tech N9ne plays House of Blues. And of course, if you're still looking for a chance to dress up, join the Mac Sabbath crew at the Casbah.\n\nMonday, Oct. 29:\n\nEric Hutchinson & the Believers, Jeremy Messersmith @ Belly Up\n\nDawes @ Observatory North Park\n\nReal Friends, Boston Manor, Grayscale, Eat Your Heart Out @ The Irenic\n\nMac Sabbath, Franks & Deans @ Casbah\n\nTech N9ne, Futuristic, Dizzy Wright, Krizz Kaliko @ House of Blues\n\nY La Bamba, Kera & the Lesbians, Marineros @ Space\n\nJoshua Hedley, Kelsey Waldon @ Soda Bar\n\nLady Dottie & the Diamonds @ Humphreys Backstage Live\n\nJulia Sage & the Bad Hombres @ Bar Pink\n\nMotown on Mondays @ The Office\n\nChad & Rosie @ Crossroads, House of Blues (free)\n\nElectric Waste Band @ Winston's\n\nMakossa Mondays with DJ Tah Rei @ Seven Grand\n\nBlue Monday: Darkwave Halloween Party @ Blonde\n\nJazz Jam with Louis V @ Rosie O'Grady's\n\nAndy & Nathan @ Martini's Above Fourth\n\nStrictly Acoustic @ Navajo Live\n\n'80s with Junior theDISCOpunk @ The Brass Rail\n\nElectric Relaxation @ Whistle Stop\n\nWheels of the Industry @ Live Wire\n\nOpen Mic @ Lestat's\n\nAcoustic Night/Industry Night @ Henry's Pub\n\n31 Flavors @ U-31"
