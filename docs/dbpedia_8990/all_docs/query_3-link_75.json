        "text": "THINKING MAN: Jeremy Messersmith makes ultra-melodic pop with dark, literate lyrics – what’s not to like? He plays Joe’s Pub, hawking goods from his third album, the wonderfully-named (and downloadable on a name-your-price basis at his website, BTW) Reluctant Graveyard, and beyond. 9PM.\n\nROOTS: Q: How often do you get to see a musician of the stature of Lee “Scratch” Perry – legendary producer, reggae icon, and magnetic performer – on stage these days? A: Not very. He comes to Highline Ballroom, 9PM."
