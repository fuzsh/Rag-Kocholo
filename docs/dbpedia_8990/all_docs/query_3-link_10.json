        "text": "Singer-songwriter Jeremy Messersmith found his path after auditing a songwriting course at North Central University in Minneapolis. The class encouraged him to start writing songs of his own and experiment with different styles and genres than he experienced as a music major. The songs from his album The Alcatraz Kid reflect some of his influences: Elliott Smith, The Beatles and Brian Wilson. With Messersmith on acoustic guitar, the track \"Beautiful Children\" showcases the emotional depth of his lyrics and vocals.\n\nOriginally from Washington state, Messersmith moved to Minneapolis in 1999. After his songwriting interest sparked in 2002, Messersmith played in some local bands. He went solo in 2004, handing out free copies of his music in brown paper bags.\n\nEither by fate or skill, or a little of both, a bag found its way into the hands of the Minneapolis-based Princess Records, which released Alcatraz in the Fall of 2006. On tour to support the album, Messersmith is working on a follow up record with producer Dan Wilson, who has also worked with Semisonic."
