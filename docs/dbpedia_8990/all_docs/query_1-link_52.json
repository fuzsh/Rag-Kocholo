Wilson himself received the 2007 Grammy Award for Song of the Year for \"Not Ready to Make Nice,\" one of the songs he co-wrote with the Dixie Chicks.\n\nHis accolades as a songwriter have grown from success with his own band Semisonic. In 1999, Wilson was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for Semisonic's \"Closing Time,\" which hit No. 6 in the Top 40 Chart and was No.\n\n1 on the Modern Rock Chart."
