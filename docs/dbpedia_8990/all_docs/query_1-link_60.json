        "text": "Rob Meany is a singer-songwriter best known as the leader of jazz-rock quartet, Terramara.\n\nBorn and raised in Duluth, Minnesota, Rob was drawn to a wide range of music at an early age while studying classical piano and listening to Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder and The Beatles. He continued his studies at college, playing french horn, singing in choir, and playing in jazz band.\n\nIt wasn’t until a few years later that Rob would find his muse as a songwriter and singer. After short stints as a sideman in various groups, he formed Terramara as a vehicle for his jazz-funk, piano-driven songs. Over the past fifteen years, Terramara has released three full-length albums, garnering a loyal following among smart-pop and jazz-rock lovers around the world.\n\nThe band’s first album, self-titled Terramara, (2000, produced by Ken Chastain of Greazy Meal), introduced the band’s unique sound to the local scene: \"Think Steely Dan with an edge. Great pop tunes with a flavor of jazz and rock…”— TwinCities.com.\n\nSeveral years and line-up changes later, the band reformed and released a follow up, entitled Four Blocks To Hennepin (2005, also produced by Ken Chastain), a more fully-realized and finely-crafted production that put the band on the map as a rare purveyor of modern pop/rock/jazz fusion: “If you thought the parting of Spymob meant there weren't any good Steely Dan-loving bands left in town, then you obviously haven't heard the new Terramara CD. Titled, Four Blocks to Hennepin, the sophomore album is a piano- and horn-driven effort full of tight, poppy harmonies and instrumental jams that could light an incense stick. Terramara's singer-keyboardist Rob Meany has a smooth yet powerful, Sting-like voice…and his songs such as \"Running Down the Avenue\" and the title track feature guy-lost-in-the-city themes.”—Chris Reimenschneider, Star Tribune.\n\nFour Blocks To Hennepin also yielded Rob some accolades as a songwriter, with the track “Goodbye” winning a second place finish in the international Billboard World Song Contest. Another track, “Outrunning Headlights” won Grand Prize in the Positive Pop Song Contest out of Nashville. Other awards include Grand Prize in the Strictly Original New Music Competition on Minnesota's WB TV, and top ten in the Unisong and the Independent Music Awards (IMA).\n\nRob's songs have also been featured in many national and international TV programs such as Supernatural (CW), Making The Movie: The Watchmen (UK), Animal Planet, Biography (A & E), Dress My Nest (Style Network), Emeril Green, Man Vs. Food (Travel Channel), among others.\n\nThe release of the band’s third album, Dust & Fiction (2008, produced by Jon Herchert), continued the drive toward progressive-pop perfection, leaning more heavily on guitar-driven tunes and quirky arrangements. Critics agreed: “…Dust & Fiction, shifts away from the Steely Dan style and toward XTC…Simultaneously intelligent and incredibly catchy, they might just single-handedly save pop music.” — Larry Kolota, KenesisCD.com.\n\n“Beautifully arranged jazz-pop that offers an urbane, sardonic wisdom that's beyond the reach of most mainstream acts today.” — Jason Warburg, The Daily Vault\n\n“Funky pop-rock that has a great notion of vocal harmonies, Terramara is part jazz and part Maroon 5 — J Sin. smother.net\n\nOver the last few years, Rob took a hiatus from Terramara to produce his first solo album, Ferris Wheels Unbound (2016), which departs from the rock quartet-oriented production of past albums, instead presenting a collection of more intimate performances, storytelling, and stark arrangements, enhanced by string quartet and jazz trio. Producer Andy Thompson (Jeremy Messersmith, Natalie Lovejoy, Kevin Steinman) provides a Beatlesque art-pop sheen to the songs, while retaining their homegrown, folksy style. “This shimmering collection might be recommended to fans of Marshall Crenshaw, XTC, and chamber pop.—Jay Gabler, KCMP 89.3 The Current.\n\nAfter a pandemic-induced hiatus, Rob has regrouped and begun releasing new music in 2023."
