I have loosely followed the career of Jeremy Messersmith — NPR favorite and one of Minneapolis’ hometown heroes — since the release of his 2010 full-length, The Reluctant Graveyard. Messersmith has an undeniable talent for pop standards, and his dusky voice is remarkably pliable.

Last year, he signed to Glassnote Records — a well-earned contract — and in February, he released Heart Murmurs. This latest yields some of Messersmith’s best writing yet; the songs start in your gut and bloom in your heart.
