Current Software Versions

Adobe Flash 25.0.0.148

Adobe Reader DC 2017.009.20044

Dropbox 23.4.19 [Citadel warns against relying on security of Dropbox or other cloud-based file exchange systems. We recommend files containing sensitive information be independently encrypted with a program like Axcrypt; encryption keys be at least 15 characters long; and the master Dropbox [or other] password be at least 15 characters long and different from other passwords.]

Firefox 53.0 [Windows]

Google Chrome 58.0.3029.81

Internet Explorer 11.0.9600.18639

Java SE 8 Update 131 [Citadel recommends removing or disabling Java from your browser. Java is a major source of cyber criminal exploits. It is not needed for most internet browsing. If you have a particular web site that requires Java, Citadel recommends using a two-browser approach to minimize risk. If you normally browse the Web with Firefox, for example, disable the Java plugin in Firefox and use an alternative browser — such as Chrome, IE9, Safari, etc — with Java enabled to browse only the sites that require it.]

Microsoft Edge 40.15063.0.0

QuickTime 7.7.9 [Citadel recommends removing QuickTime. On April 14, US-CERT advised Microsoft Windows users to remove QuickTime. This followed a report in ars technica that Apple has no plans to update the Windows app despite at least two reliable QuickTime vulnerabilities that threaten Windows users who still have the program installed.]

Safari 10.1 [Mac OS X Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan]

Skype 7.35.0.101
