        "text": "This section contains information about enhancements in version 12.6 of the BMC Client Management product..\n\nReplacement for Java Web Start\n\nOracle recently announced a major change to their licensing policy and release cadence for Java SE (Standard Edition including both JDK and JRE). BMC Client Management earlier included Oracle Java (JRE) for some server processes and the Administration Console. To minimize impact of the new Oracle licensing change for users, BMC Client Management now provides support for open JDK through the web start installer. The web start installer is a replacement for Java Web Start, and provides the following advantages:\n\nProvides an easier way to install the BMC Client Management Console, with fewer installation steps.\n\nEnsures that the console is always up-to-date.\n\nIf you use BMC Remedyforce or BMC FootPrints with BMC Client Management, you must wait until the release of BMC Remedyforce Winter 19 or BMC FootPrints version 20.19.01 before upgrading to BMC Client Management 12.6 patch 5 in order to launch the BCM console from BMC Remedyforce and BMC FootPrints. The current releases of BMC Footprints and BMC Remedyforce are not compatible with BMC Client Management 12.6 patch 5, due to the introduction of the new BMC Client Management web start installer.\n\nFor more information, see Downloading and installing the BMC Helix Client Management console.\n\nCentralized management of account credentials for rolling out BMC Client Management agents\n\nBefore BMC Client Management version 12.6, administrators had to authenticate their credentials on each asset while rolling out BMC Client Management agents. Any changes to administrator credentials did not automatically apply to the associated rollouts. It became time-consuming and repetitive to enter authentication credentials on each asset.\n\nFrom BMC Client Management version 12.6 onwards, administrators can centrally manage account credentials and associate it to rollouts. BMC Client Management automatically applies any changes to an account credential to all the associated rollouts. This mechanism efficiently manages rollouts.\n\nThe BMC Client Management console provides a new node, Account Credentials, that enables administrators to centrally manage account credentials for all the roll outs.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the overview of account credentials in your IT infrastructure:\n\nFor more information, refer to Managing administrator credentials centrally for rolling out BMC Client Management agents.\n\nRemotely controlling devices through a web browser\n\nIn addition to the classic remote control feature through the BMC Client Management console, 12.6 release enables remote control of devices through a web browser. It does not need you to install the BMC Client Management java console to remote control devices. You can remote control devices from anywhere through a web browser using a compatible browser on a compatible operating system. As a BMC Client Management administrator, you can configure the remote control settings that will be used by the help desk technician.\n\nFor more information, refer to Remotely controlling a device through a web browser.\n\nIntegrating Remedy with Smart IT product with BMC Client Management\n\nIntegrating Remedy with Smart IT with BMC Client Management enables administrators to automate incident generation in Remedy with Smart IT based on events defined in BMC Client Management.\n\nFor more information, refer to Remedy with Smart IT product integration with BMC Client Management.\n\nIntegrating BMC Remedy SSO with BMC Client Management\n\nIntegrating BMC Client Management with BMC Remedy SSO enables Remedy with Smart IT technicians to remote control BMC Client Management managed endpoints through the BMC Client Management browser-based console.\n\nFor more information on configuring Remedy SSO with BMC Client Management:\n\nRemedy SSO parameters\n\nIntegrating with BMC Helix Single Sign-On\n\nCustomizing the end-user dialogs to provide a personalized experience\n\nFrom BMC Client Management version 12.6 onwards, you can directly customize dialog boxes that provide product updates or acknowledgments to an end user. It enables you to deliver a personalized experience for end users.\n\nYou can customize the end-user dialogs for the following features:\n\nRemote Control Access and Direct Access\n\nOperational rules\n\nPatch management\n\nFor more information on customizing the dialogs that are sent to devices which are to be remotely controlled or directly controlled, or where operational rules, patches are to be installed, see\n\nCustomizing the end-user dialogs to provide a personalized experience\n\nCustomizing company logo for end-user dialogs\n\nFrom BMC Client Management version 12.6 onwards, administrators can customize logo for end-user dialogs boxes:\n\nOn the BMC Client Management console, go to Global Settings > System Variables > Customization.\n\nClick Browse to select a logo.\n\nSelect a logo in PNG or JPG format.\n\nYou can crop a part of the image or select a specific part of the image and click OK.\n\nOn the Customization tab, click Apply.\n\nAfter you customize the logo, all dialog boxes will display the customized logo.\n\nFor more information, refer to Managing company logo.\n\nCustomizing company logo for style-based reports\n\nBefore BMC Client Management version 12.6, administrators could customize logos by storing logos on the master server and browsing them from the BMC Client Management console. But, an administrator could not add and customize new logos directly from the BMC Client Management console.\n\nFrom BMC Client Management version 12.6 onwards, administrators can customize logo for style-based reports directly from the BMC Client Management console. This enhancement is not applicable for template-based reports.\n\nTo customize logo on style-based reports:\n\nOn the BMC Client Management console, go to Global Settings > System Variables > Reports.\n\nClick Browse to select a logo.\n\nSelect a logo in PNG or JPG format.\n\nYou can crop a part of the image or select a specific part of the image and click OK.\n\nOn the Reports tab, click Apply.\n\nAfter you customize the logo, any newly generated style-based reports will display the customized logo.\n\nFor more information, refer to Managing report settings.\n\nEnsuring GUIDs generated for BMC Client Management devices are not duplicated\n\nFor eliminating duplicate Global Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) associated to devices, BMC Client Management has enhanced its GUID generation mechanism. The new mechanism uses all the device attributes to generate a GUID, irrespective of whether an attribute is enabled or not in the BMC Client Management console.\n\nBMC Client Management considers the attributes enabled in the console when an agent has to be re-installed on a device. BMC Client Management performs an attribute match to determine whether a device exists with at least one attribute match in the master database. If an attribute match is found, BMC Client Management persists the existing GUID for that device. This ensures that GUIDs are not duplicated in the master database and there are no communication issues between the master database and the agents.\n\nBefore BMC Client Management version 12.6, BMC Client Management used to generate unique IDs for devices by using the attribute value defined in the BMC Client Management console. The GUIDs were duplicated because was due to identical attributes on different systems. Thus it caused communication issues between the master database and the agents.\n\nWhat's changed\n\nFrom BMC Client Management 12.6 onwards, BMC Client Management uses all the attributes of a device to generate GUIDs, irrespective of whether an attribute is enabled or not.\n\nFor more information, refer to Managing BMC Client Management agent connection behavior.\n\nDoes an upgrade change existing GUIDs\n\nExisting device GUIDs will not be changed after BMC Client Management is upgraded from version 11.7 or later to version 12.6.\n\nHow does BMC Client Management manage GUIDs when you deploy an OS (OSD) using the BMC Client Management console\n\nWhen you deploy an OS image on systems using BMC Client Management, it ensures that each OS deployment is assigned a unique GUID. It ensures GUID uniqueness, by removing any existing GUID information from the Identity.ini file that is captured by the SYSPREP utility.\n\nBefore you use third-party tools to deploy OS images, ensure that the captured OS image that you will use to deploy the OS image on other systems is clean of any GUID information. To ensure that the captured OS image is clean of GUID information, remove any GUID information from the ini file.\n\nIf you do not remove the existing GUID from the Identity.ini file before you deploy the ghost OS image, then the same GUID will be deployed on all the other systems causing duplicate GUIDs recorded by the master database.\n\nImproved patch management mechanism\n\nFrom BMC Client Management version 12.6 onwards, the patch management mechanism is upgraded to provide a more efficient patch management experience. The update is seamless with a fresh product install or during an upgrade.\n\nMicrosoft Office patching\n\nThe upgrade patch management mechanism does not support patching individual Microsoft Office products. It only supports patching the entire Microsoft Office suite.\n\nIn the Patch/Service Pack Distribution Wizard, the Office Options step is not available in the wizard, which enabled selecting individual Office products. The upgraded patch management mechanism only patches the complete Microsoft Office suite. SDK 9.2 only deploys the patches that support full file. In BMC Client Management 12.5, the Office Options step was part of the wizard.\n\nSDK 9.2 also supports Office 365 patching for devices with an internet connection.\n\nColumns that list the patch versions are not shown in the wizard.\n\nTo view the updated console:\n\nGo to Patch Management.\n\nOn the menu bar, click Wizards > Patch/Service Pack Distribution Wizard.\n\nFor more information on distributing patches/service packs, refer to Patch Service Pack Distribution Wizard.\n\nProduct family representation\n\nIn the Patch Criteria step, the Product Name list an updated list, where some product families list all individual products.\n\nThe updated product listing is beneficial because you can pick and choose the products you want to patch rather than patch the entire product family.\n\nFor more information on selecting specific products to patch, refer to Patch Criteria.\n\nAfter upgrading to or freshly installing BMC Client Management 12.6, the Security Products Inventory types and Virtual Infrastructure Management are updated in BMC Client Management.\n\nFor more information on updates to BMC Client Management, refer to Updates to Security Products Inventory and Virtual Infrastructure Management.\n\nManaging application using Apple's Volume Purchase Program\n\nLicense applications that are purchased through Apple's Volume Purchase Program for BMC Client Management users.\n\nFor more information, refer to Managing applications purchased through the Apple Volume Purchase Program.\n\nVisible column separators in BMC Client Management console\n\nIn the BMC Client Management console, you can add color between columns to make the columns visible.\n\nTo add a color, go to the Preferences window, in the Color of separators between columns setting, choose a color and click OK to apply the settings.\n\nYou can enable a parameter to remove unused or outdated patches from BMC Client Management.\n\nFrom the Patch Group tab of the Global Settings > System Variables page, you can select the remove old patches automatically parameter."
