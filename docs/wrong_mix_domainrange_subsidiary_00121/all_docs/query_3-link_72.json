We recommend files containing sensitive information be independently encrypted with a program like Axcrypt; encryption keys be at least 15 characters long; and the master Dropbox [or other] password be at least 15 characters long and different from other passwords.]\n\nFirefox 53.0 [Windows]\n\nGoogle Chrome 58.0.3029.81\n\nInternet Explorer 11.0.9600.18639\n\nJava SE 8 Update 131 [Citadel recommends removing or disabling Java from your browser. Java is a major source of cyber criminal exploits. It is not needed for most internet browsing. If you have a particular web site that requires Java, Citadel recommends using a two-browser approach to minimize risk. If you normally browse the Web with Firefox, for example, disable the Java plugin in Firefox and use an alternative browser — such as Chrome, IE9, Safari, etc — with Java enabled to browse only the sites that require it.]\n\nMicrosoft Edge 40.15063.0.0\n\nQuickTime 7.7.9 [Citadel recommends removing QuickTime. On April 14, US-CERT advised Microsoft Windows users to remove QuickTime. This followed a report in ars technica that Apple has no plans to update the Windows app despite at least two reliable QuickTime vulnerabilities that threaten Windows users who still have the program installed.]\n\nSafari 10.1 [Mac OS X Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan]\n\nSkype 7.35.0.101\n\nFor Your IT Department\n\nCisco Multiple Products: Cisco has released updates to address vulnerabilities in Unified Communications Manager, Integrated Management Controller, Apache Struts2, Firepower Detection Engine, IOS and IOS XE, ASA Software Internet Key Exchange, ASA Software SSL/TLS, ASA Software IPsec, ASA Software DNS, Prime Network Registrar, FindIT Network Probe, Prime Infrastructure Web Framework, Integrated Managment Controller, ASA Software and FTD Wofware, Industrial Ethernet 2000 Series Switches, Prime Optical for Service Providers RADIUS, OpenSSL Affecting Cisco Products, and others.
