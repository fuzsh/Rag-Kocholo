IBM is not backing away from collaboration but EMC's lack of vocal support of eRoom, pandering to backend integration and promises for the delayed Rich Internet Client suggest that eRoom...

Market leader Adobe Acrobat PDF better watch out or Adobe Macromedia FlashPaper will eat their market share. Oh wait a minute, Adobe and Adobe, oh. I get it, another company where two divisions don’t talk to each other. Looks like Adobe’s been creating a new portable document format specifically for...

I think it’s too early to talk about how a customer should choose a CEVA when there’s only one CEVA to choose from. What we really need is for vendors and VARS to look at a...

To support our mission, I thought it was time to build a consolidated view of the news in the ECM landscape. In the process of adding RSS feeds to all of the top ECM vendors, I discovered something. Vignette offers RSS feeds as a... Continue Reading →\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEMC has been gobbling up companies like there is no tomorrow. On Monday they sweetened the offer to acquire Iomega and this one introduces something new to EMC. With the possible exception of hosted backup and storage services from Dantz and Mozy, EMC has stayed away from marketing it's wares directly to the home user....

Then just over eighteen months ago, IBM acquired FileNet and with that the third entry into content management. Is the “third time a charm” or is “history repeating”?
