        "text": "Hi! My fully configured 2015 Retina iMac with 24Gb is so slow (beachballing galore, and slow browser responsiveness).\n\nMy Login Items is down to only dropbox, but I still have many other programs that appear to launch on startup - such as Malwarebytes, Backblaze, Pulse Secure etc - how do i disable these?\n\nSeparately, might the two following data points help isolate the issue with my Mac?\n\n1. The Mac temporarily runs faster after a CCleaner run.\n\n2. The last safe boot took about 18 hours. Any suggestions on how to figure out to make my Mac zippy again?\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S.

So I removed the AVirus. It no longer is an \"Issue\". Two issues remain - failing hard drive and unsigned files. All the unsigned files are on a whitelist, so that is not an issue. Can a 3 year old hard drive really be failing? Is there another test program perhaps for the hard drive (Disk Utility gives the drive a clean bill of health).
