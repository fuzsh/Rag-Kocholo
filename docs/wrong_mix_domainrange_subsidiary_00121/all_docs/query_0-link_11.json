        "text": "OpenText Carbonite acquisition part of cloud push\n\nHistorically a vendor of mostly on-premises software, OpenText is amid a cloud transformation campaign.\n\nThe acquisition is \"an expansion of OpenText's cloud portfolio,\" Gartner analyst Michael Woodbridge said. \"It will be interesting to see how far they intend to integrate [Carbonite] into other services.\"\n\nExisting Carbonite customers ought to be confident that OpenText will continue to support them because OpenText usually maintains support for acquired products in the long term, Woodbridge added.\n\nThe acquisition comes after the content management vendor last summer launched a major expansion of its partnership with Google to help OpenText customers move EIM systems projects to Google Cloud.\n\nAlso, last summer OpenText revealed that OpenText cloud editions of its on-premises applications, dubbed OpenText CE, would be available by April 2020 for the OpenText Cloud and the AWS and Microsoft Azure public clouds.\n\nAs one of the biggest independent content and enterprise information management vendors, OpenText also appears to have recognized with the acquisition that it needed to build up security features around data inside its systems.\n\nThat initiative started in 2017, when OpenText acquired Guidance Software.\n\n\"Connecting that other piece -- the backup and data protection -- might improve its reach or its appeal to its customers,\" Naveen Chhabra, a Forrester Research analyst, said of the Carbonite acquisition.\n\nCarbonite\n\nMohamad Ali suddenly resigned as Carbonite CEO in July 2019, with chairman Steve Munford stepping in as interim CEO.\n\nFounded in 2006, Boston-based Carbonite began as a vendor of online backup services for desktop PCs, and later evolved into a provider of SaaS data protection and data security services.\n\nIn March 2019, Carbonite moved aggressively into security with a $618.5 million acquisition of Webroot, a network and endpoint security vendor and provider of threat intelligence services and training.\n\nJust over a year earlier, in February 2018, Carbonite bought cloud backup vendor Mozy, a former longtime competitor, for $145.8 million from Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nUnder the terms of the definitive acquisition agreement between the two publicly traded companies, OpenText agreed to buy all outstanding Carbonite shares for $23 per share in cash.\n\nOpenText said it expected to close the transaction within 90 days.\n\nOpenText's Carbonite acquisition appears to be focused on adding data classification, protection and recovery capabilities across OpenText's products, including guarding against ransomware, Woodbridge said.\n\nNews director Shaun Sutner and senior news writer Johnny Yu contributed to this story."
