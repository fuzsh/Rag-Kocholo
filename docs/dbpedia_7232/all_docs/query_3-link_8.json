        "text": "While external forces such as financial compensation, praise, or the avoidance of negative consequences can generate short-term action, these are simply not enough to inspire committed, creative work in the long term.\n\nIn fact, some studies show that, other than for the simplest tasks, extrinsic motivators like these can actually impede the creativity and cognitive effort needed for peak performance.\n\nInstead, to ensure productive, engaged, and satisfied teams, managers and HR professionals need to leverage intrinsic motivators.\n\nToday, we’ll turn to Daniel Pink’s book Drive to examine three key generators of intrinsic motivation - Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose – each anchored by key psychological and motivational theories.\n\nWhether your role demands inspiring leadership, or you’re simply in the doldrums yourself, this framework can help you look for ways to identify your de-motivators and find exciting solutions.\n\nAutonomy — the sense of control and freedom in one's work — is a significant contributor to motivation.\n\nProtecting our own identity or ‘sense of self’ is a fundamental psychological drive, so when we can weave this into our work, we strive to protect the work, too. As a manager, respecting individual talents and encouraging unique contributions can enhance employee engagement.\n\nConversely, micro-management and inflexible work processes are likely to erode feelings of autonomy and act as demotivators. Team members start to to feel like ‘cogs in a machine’, and the work does not feel like ‘theirs.’ In order to feel intrinsically motivated, we need to fully and creatively perform the task ‘as ourselves’, rather than robotically complying with instructions.\n\nPurpose – a sense of meaningfulness and impact of one's work – is a potent motivational force.\n\nThis echoes the concept of 'Meaningful Work,' as described in the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), where individuals seek to be a part of something bigger and impactful.\n\nConversely, the feeling that our work is somehow pointless (or perhaps even having a negative effect!) is a major de-motivator.\n\nPurpose need not always be grand (in the sense of noble societal impact) but can also emerge from a sense of contributing meaningfully to a larger project, supporting peers that are depending on us, or providing a great service to customers."
