        "text": "One might expect this book to be about money, status, work and the likes. Fortunately, this book is exactly what it says on the front cover — provocative and fascinating. It explores the gap between business and science’s understanding of human behaviour. The book also includes a useful toolkit at the end to help individuals, businesses, others in the position of leadership practice the principles.\n\nFrom the book, we learn that much of our societal operating system consist of a set of assumptions about human behaviour about what drives us. In the earliest times, the underlying drive of humans was a biological drive to eat and drink to satisfy hunger and thirst etc. This biological drive the author calls Motivation 1.0.\n\nFollowing our sophistication over the years, we now have an improved operating system fueled by the drive to seek reward and avoid punishment. This improved operating system the author calls Motivation 2.0.\n\nMotivation 2.0 is best reflected by this quote: ‘’The way to improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence is to reward the good and punish the bad’’.\n\nSurprisingly, although Motivation 2.0 likens us to horses motivated by the dangling of the carrot and the whip of the stick, we remain generally comfortable with this approach, after all it has powered so much economic development. According to Daniel (the author), it’s not like carrot and sticks, external rewards and punishments don’t work. In fact, they work very well for algorithmic tasks. But the problem is that many of us now perform heuristic tasks and because of this, extrinsic rewards employed by the management of most organisations often fail to motivate us for seven key reasons — it extinguishes intrinsic motivation, diminishes performance, crushes creativity, crowds out good behaviour, becomes addictive, fosters short term thinking, and encourages shortcuts and unethical behaviours. Billable hours are a relic of Motivation 2.0- if the reward comes from time, then time is what firms will get.\n\n‘’People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person’s motivation and behaviour, but in so doing, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person’s intrinsic motivation towards the activity’’.\n\n“Mixing reward with inherently interesting, creative, or noble tasks — deploying them without understanding the peculiar science of motivation — is a very dangerous game”.\n\n“The problem with making an extrinsic reward the only destination that matters is that some people will choose the quickest route there, even if it means taking the low road”.\n\nSince we are intrinsically motivated purpose maximisers not only extrinsically motivated profit maximisers, since we are full-fledged human beings, not single-minded economic robots, since we prefer work to be creative, interesting, and self-directed not unrelentingly routine, boring, and other-directed — what then is the truth about what motivates us?\n\nIn three words the answer is — Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose (Motivation 3.0).\n\n#1 Autonomy\n\nMotivation 3.0 seeks autonomy — creating conditions for people to do their best work. Research has shown that businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control-oriented firms and had one-third the turnover (FYI the toolkit provides excellent examples of how to achieve this for example via the FedEx day or 20% time with training wheels exercise).\n\nOne of my favourite sections in this book was the brief discussion on Management’s advocation of how they promote “empowerment” and ‘’flexibility”. Empowerment presumes that the organisation has the power and is now choosing to give some to its grateful employees. Flextime presumes the organisation’s control of a supposed to be self-directed human’s time. It’s a slightly more civilised form of control.\n\n“The ultimate freedom for creative groups is the freedom to experiment with new ideas. Some sceptics insist that innovation is expensive. In the long run, innovation is cheap. Mediocrity is expensive and autonomy can be the antidote.” Tom Kelley, General Manager, IDEO\n\n#2 Mastery\n\nMotivation 3.0 seeks Mastery — the desire to get better and better at something that matters.\n\nAutonomy leads to engagement and engagement to mastery. We can enjoy the “autotelic experience’ when we run, swim, climb a mountain and yes even at work if the goal is clear, feedback is immediate, and if the relationship between what a person had to do and what a person could do is perfect.\n\nFor mastery to truly captivate the mind, it needs to be set towards learning goals (not performance goals). One of the best things about this book is its use of simple examples; for example, getting an A in French is a performance goal, speaking French fluently is a learning goal.\n\n“Figure out for yourself what you want to be really good at, know that you’ll never really satisfy yourself that you’ve made it, and accept that that’s okay.” Robert B. Reich, former U.S. Secretary of Labour.\n\n#3 Purpose\n\nPurpose provides activation energy for living. We are perfectly capable of doing something beyond ourselves. We have been wired that way.\n\nWhile Motivation 2.0 emphasises profit maximisation. Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profit but places equal emphasis on purpose maximisation. Little wonder businesses who have a purpose bigger than their product do exceedingly well (remember TOMS).\n\nI found the concept of the ‘MBA Oath’ very fascinating. Something tells me a simplified version of this should exist at primary level of education all the way through to undergraduates so conscious accountability is engraved at an early stage.\n\n“One cannot lead a life that is truly excellent without feeling that one belongs to something greater and more permanent than oneself”. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.\n\nWhile I dream of a time when I can take a Sagmeister like Stefan Sagmeister who goes off on a year sabbatical and generate ideas that he lives off for the next seven years, I have so far taken the flow test, undertaken a performance review and I have plans to apply the toolkit as much as possible in my daily life. Of all the exercises in the tool kit, I have found the Webber card exercise most fascinating. It goes like this:\n\n1) Get a few blank cards\n\n2) On one, write the answer to ‘‘What gets you up in the morning’’\n\n3) On the other card, write the answer to “What keeps you up at night”\n\n4) Pare each response to a single sentence. If you don’t like the answer, before tossing the card decide what you will do about it? Keep trying until you have written down something you can live with\n\n5) If both answers give you a sense of meaning and direction then you are on the path to autonomy, mastery and purpose.\n\nYou can watch a beautiful animate video of here, listen to Daniel Pink’s TED talk here.\n\nWhether you read the book, read the summary above, or watch the videos, there is much to be learnt from this book."
