        "text": "Intrinsic motivation is defined as the motivation to engage in a behavior because of the inherent satisfaction of the activity rather than the desire for a reward or specific outcome. According to \"Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior With Concept Maps,\" intrinsic motivation occurs when we act without any obvious external rewards: \"We simply enjoy an activity or see it as an opportunity to explore, learn, and actualize our potentials.\"\n\nThe three main elements of intrinsic motivation are autonomy, purpose, and mastery. People are intrinsically motivated when they can act independently, feel that their efforts matter, and gain satisfaction from becoming more skilled.\n\nIntrinsic motivation can be contrasted with extrinsic motivation, which involves engaging in a behavior to earn external rewards or avoid punishment.\n\nHow Intrinsic Motivation Works\n\nWhen was the last time you did something simply for the enjoyment of the activity itself? There are a number of activities that fall into this category. For instance, you may plant a garden, paint a picture, play a game, write a story, take a walk, or read a book. These may or may not produce something or provide a prize. Instead, we do them because we like to. They make us happy.\n\nWhen you pursue an activity for the pure enjoyment of it, you are doing so because you are intrinsically motivated. Your motivations for engaging in the behavior arise entirely from within rather than out of a desire to gain some type of external reward, such as prizes, money, or acclaim.\n\nActivities can generate such feelings when they give you a sense of meaning, like participating in volunteer or church events. They may also give you a sense of progress when you see that your work is accomplishing something positive, or competence when you learn something new or become more skilled at a task.\n\nImpact of Extrinsic Reinforcement\n\nResearchers have discovered that offering external rewards or reinforcements for an already internally rewarding activity can actually make the activity less intrinsically rewarding. This phenomenon is known as the overjustification effect.\n\n\"A person's intrinsic enjoyment of an activity provides sufficient justification for their behavior,\" explains author Richard A. Griggs in his book \"Psychology: A Concise Introduction.\"\n\n\"With the addition of extrinsic reinforcement, \" Griggs writes, \"the person may perceive the task as overjustified and then attempt to understand their true motivation (extrinsic versus intrinsic) for engaging in the activity.\"\n\nIn work settings, for instance, productivity can be increased by using extrinsic rewards such as a bonus. However, the actual quality of the work performed is influenced by intrinsic factors. If you are doing something that you find rewarding, interesting, and challenging, you are more likely to come up with novel ideas and creative solutions.\n\nIntrinsic Motivation in Your Life\n\nIntrinsic motivation can drive behavior in all aspects of life, particularly in education, sports, careers, and personal pursuits.\n\nIn Education\n\nIntrinsic motivation is an important topic in education. Teachers and instructional designers strive to develop learning environments that are intrinsically rewarding. Unfortunately, many traditional paradigms suggest that most students find learning boring, so they must be extrinsically goaded into educational activities.\n\nIn a book chapter called \"Making Learning Fun: A Taxonomy of Intrinsic Motivations for Learning,\" authors Thomas Malone and Mark Leeper suggest that this does not need to be the case. They identify several different ways to create learning environments that are intrinsically rewarding.\n\nIn Personal Pursuits\n\nExamples of intrinsic motivation in daily life abound. If you participate in a sport because you enjoy it rather than to win awards or competitions, you're responding to intrinsic motivation.\n\nAnother example: You try to do your best at work because your tasks and mission provide fulfillment and satisfaction, regardless of extrinsic factors such as pay and benefits.\n\nPerhaps you maintain a beautiful garden because you enjoy planting it and watching it grow, not because the neighbors would complain if your yard were messy. Or, maybe you dress stylishly as a way to express yourself and your interest in fashion, rather than to garner attention. Whenever you do something \"just for you,\" you're responding to intrinsic motivation.\n\nFactors That Influence Intrinsic Motivation\n\nMalone and Leeper identify these factors as increasing intrinsic motivation:\n\nChallenge: People are more motivated when they pursue goals with personal meaning and when attaining the goal is possible but not necessarily certain. These goals may also relate to their self-esteem when performance feedback is available.\n\nControl: People want control over themselves and their environments and want to determine what they pursue.\n\nCooperation and competition: Intrinsic motivation can be increased in situations where people gain satisfaction from helping others. It also applies to cases where they can compare their performance favorably to that of others.\n\nCuriosity: Internal motivation is increased when something in the physical environment grabs the individual's attention (sensory curiosity). It also occurs when something about the activity stimulates the person to want to learn more (cognitive curiosity).\n\nRecognition: People enjoy having their accomplishments recognized by others, which can increase internal motivation.\n\nPotential Pitfalls Affecting Intrinsic Motivation\n\nExperts have noted that offering unnecessary rewards can have unexpected costs. While we like to think that offering a reward will improve a person's motivation, interest, and performance, this isn't always the case.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that a number of factors can influence whether intrinsic motivation is increased or decreased by external rewards. Salience or the significance of the event itself often plays a critical role.\n\nAn athlete competing in a sporting event might view the winner's prize as confirmation of competence and exceptionalism. On the other hand, some athletes might view the same prize as a sort of bribe or coercion.\n\nThe way in which the individual views the importance of different characteristics of the event impacts whether the reward will affect their intrinsic motivation for participating in that activity.\n\nSummary\n\nIn your own life, there are probably many things you do which are prompted by intrinsic motivation. These are important elements for a well-balanced life. If we spend all of our time working to make money, we may miss out on the simple pleasures of life. Realizing your own intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and balancing them can be quite rewarding."
