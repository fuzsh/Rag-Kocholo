        "text": "Please share what you find valuable:\n\nThe Puzzle of Motivation\n\nCareer analyst Dan Pink examines the puzzle of motivation, starting with a fact that social scientists know but most managers don’t: Traditional rewards aren’t always as effective as we think. Listen for illuminating stories — and maybe, a way forward. (Youtube).\n\nWhat Motivates Us\n\nDaniel Pink is a behavioral scientist and author who has written extensively on motivation. In his book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, he challenges the traditional view that people are motivated by rewards and punishments. Instead, he argues that people are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\n\nAutonomy is the desire to have control over our own lives and to make our own choices. Mastery is the desire to improve our skills and to become better at something. Purpose is the desire to do something that is meaningful and that makes a difference in the world.\n\nPink supports his argument with research from a variety of fields, including psychology, economics, and neuroscience. He shows that when people are given autonomy, mastery, and purpose in their work, they are more productive, more creative, and more satisfied.\n\nPink also provides examples of organizations that are using autonomy, mastery, and purpose to motivate their employees. For example, he talks about a company called Atlassian that gives its employees 20% of their time to work on any project they want. This allows employees to pursue their own passions and to develop new skills.\n\nPink’s work has had a significant impact on the way we think about motivation. He has shown that the best way to motivate people is to give them autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\n\nHere are some examples of how Pink’s ideas can be applied in the workplace:\n\nGive employees autonomy. Let employees have a say in how their work is done and what projects they work on. This will help them to feel more engaged and motivated.\n\nProvide opportunities for mastery. Give employees opportunities to learn and grow in their careers. This will help them to feel more challenged and fulfilled.\n\nConnect employees to purpose. Help employees to understand how their work contributes to the organization’s mission and vision. This will give their work meaning and purpose.\n\nBy following Pink’s advice, organizations can create a more motivating work environment for their employees. This can lead to increased productivity, creativity, and satisfaction.\n\nTraining from CEO and Leadership Gurus."
