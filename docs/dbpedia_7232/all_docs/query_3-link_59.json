It is influenced by:\n\nhow much you want the goal\n\nwhat you will gain\n\nwhat you will lose from not achieving your goal\n\nyour personal expectations\n\nMost people want to change at least one thing in their life. But it can be challenging to find the motivation just to make a start. It helps if you understand what motivation means to you so you can find your own ways to get motivated.\n\nWhy is motivation important?\n\nMotivation is important because it:\n\nprovides you with goals to work towards\n\nhelps you solve problems\n\nhelps you change old habits\n\nhelps you cope with challenges and opportunities\n\nHow can I get motivated?\n\nReachOut.com has more tips on getting motivated.\n\nHow can I stay on track to achieve my goal?\n\nMake your goal part of your routine by using a diary or app for reminders.\n\nPositive self-talk is important and effective in managing depression or anxiety. Instead of saying 'I can't', say 'I can try'.\n\nMindfulness helps keep you relaxed and focused.\n\nStart a class or join a support group. Support groups can be as effective as professional help.\n\nReward yourself when you have completed a step or goal.\n\nHow can I stay motivated?\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nRegularly review your goals and progress. Seeing progress is a great motivator in itself, and also improves your self-esteem.\n\nContinue to set new goals. Think about what you want to achieve next week, next month and next year. Tackle one goal at a time so you don’t feel overwhelmed.\n\nKeep the momentum up. It takes most people about 2 months to develop a new habit, but for some people, it can take much longer. Keeping the momentum and routine helps it feel more automatic over time.\n\nFind mentors, for example, someone you look up to who is experienced in the habit you want to change. Finding social or support groups with the same interest can help you find a mentor.\n\nSurround yourself with positive people. Positive friends and family enhance your positive self-talk. This also helps to manage the symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\nUse exercise as one of your daily goals to improve your mental health.\n\nWhat to do if you lose motivation\n\nSetbacks are normal, but developing resilience can help you carry on and continue from where you left off.\n\nHere are some tips to help you find your motivation again:\n\nReview your goals and see if they are realistic in the timeframe you have set. You may need to break your goal down further into smaller and more achievable goals.\n\nRemember why you wanted to get motivated or reach that goal in the first place.\n\nTake motivation from others — feel inspired by reading a book. Talk to your mentor, or friends or family who have reached similar goals to the ones you have set.\n\nSometimes you just need to take a break and start a fresh."
