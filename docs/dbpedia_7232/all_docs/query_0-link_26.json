        "text": "Very interesting topic\n\nThis is an interesting topic and a well written synopsis of the science of motivation. If you are a leader in a working company who has had to motivate people in the past, this book will mostly confirm what you already know. Monetary and other extrensic incentives don't work and they can be very detrimental. That in itself makes it valuable as a work of literature. There are a lot of people in high levels of leadership who may actually need a book like this to tell them what they should already know by looking at the effects of the systems they have created.\n\nI wouldn't call this book a must read or a game changer however. It is saying what a LOT of literature in the business world is currently saying. What it does do is organize what is very good science behind ideas that are being propogated in many other books. There are a few other books I would recommend ahead of this one but if you are well read in business and leadership texts, this is definitely not one you want to skip.\n\nSummary of Concepts From Other Books\n\nIt's not a surprising truth when it is mainly a summary of information covered in other books like 'Mindset' (Carol Dweck), 'Flow' (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi), 'Grit' (Angela Duckworth), 'Peak' (Anders Ericsson), and 'Talent Is Overrated' (Geoff Colvin). However, it does do a nice job of connecting the concepts from the various books and providing actions at the end of each chapter.\n\nRead Drive\n\nDrive got trashed by the Economist - you should read it and make your own judgements.\n\nDrive falls squarely in the \"strengths\" literature - a field I know best from the work of Marcus Buckingham. The basic premise is familiar. Traditional management strategies of incentives and sanction (rewards and sticks) are at best ineffective and at worst counter-productive in motivating performance. Effect motivation needs to be intrinsic. People need to do work that is meaningful, and they need be given both autonomy and responsibility for their jobs. Workplaces (and educational environments) are best set-up to focus on results rather than means. People will perform well if their job (or education's) matches their strengths (passions) - efforts by management to focus on and correct weaknesses are bound to fail.\n\nPersonally, I find this philosophy both correct and liberating. Drive is a book that I hope is read and discussed in both higher ed. and in other workplaces.\n\nAn ABSOLUTE Must Read for Innovative Leaders!!!\n\nDrive is an absolute must read for supervisors, managers and leaders! It captures the very essence of what's needed in today's workplace to inspire staff to meet their full potential and beyond. The concepts are well articulated, easily digested, innovative and exciting. I can't wait to share this with my colleagues!!!\n\nexcellent for people in positions of authority\n\nas a sales coach and sales manager I found this book to offer insightful knowledge that can help me to help other sales managers in motivating their teams to higher levels of production. this book also did a fabulous job of explaining why we should not be doing many of the things that sales managers do today thinking that we are going to help our team and in reality we are hurting them. This is a must-read for all people in positions of authority"
