        "text": "1. thoughts on great book “Drive” by Dan Pink Presentation: Hubert Golec HOW THE MOTIVATION WORKS\n\n2. Why the “Drive” Title • In the 2nd half of 20th century scientists discovered that there is a third “Drive” ⁻ This is people’s intrinsic motivation… ⁻ Scientists understand this… ⁻ …Companies do not yet consistently use that ⁻ Dan Pink called it motivation 3.0 • Once believed that people react to: ⁻ Biological needs – e.g. hunger, thirst, sex… (motivation 1.0) ⁻ Then rewards and punishments came into play (motivation 2.0) 2\n\n3. Drive • There are 3 forces motivating people internally – Autonomy – desire to direct our own lives – Mastery – desire to be better and develop ourselves – Purpose – be part of something bigger than ourselves • In the past people believed that “stick and carrot” were the best motivational tools – But this approach does not fit well for the present and future challenges, which require a lot of creativity – May lead to behaviors which are different from intentions 3\n\n4. Paradox of Rewards • Psychological experiments (like the Candle Problem*) consistently show the paradox of rewards - For tasks which involve creativity rewards result in poorer performance -For non-creative mechanical tasks rewards may cause better performance * See Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_problem 4\n\n5. Motivational Types • Author described 2 motivational types – I (intrinsic) – with internal motivation – X (extrinsic) –motivated externally – Good news – type I traits are learnable not born Type I Type X • Internal satisfaction is a reward •Seeking solutions, not avoiding problems/risks, failures are opportunities to learn • Is more resilient to burnout • In long term achieves better results • Motivated by rewards and punishments • Puts focus on the status and bonuses • Aversion to failures, potentially avoiding challenges and risks •Burnout is a risk •In short term may be more efficient 5\n\n6. Autonomy • We want to have control over what we do and how we do it • Do not like when somebody gives us orders or tells us how to do things - rewards or punishments are the form of such pressure • We take responsibility for results of our actions, we cannot replace responsibility with process / instructions • Traditional management – where someone tells what to do and how to do often leads to type X behaviors Motivation 3.0 6\n\n7. Mastery • We chose our professions and the places in the life (more or less consciously ) • Natural aspiration is to get better and better in what we do • To achieve world class in anything, need to spend around 10000 hours of focused training – no shortcuts exist • 6 hours x 200 days x 9 years = 10800 hours • So after ~10 years we can achieve world class (e.g. as programmers or managers…) • Do we spent time to find out where we are (e.g. seek for feedback)? Motivation 3.0 7\n\n8. Purpose • Each of us wants to be part of something bigger and more important than us • To achieve something meaningful – purpose must be bigger than profit and money • We need to find individual answers why we are doing things in life and what are our life’s goals • Similarly organization has to find answer what is it’s goal • Last global crises shown that companies which are motivated by profit only, may eventually not survive Motivation 3.0 8"
