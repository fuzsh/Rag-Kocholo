Remember, differing views are good, they lead to great discussion and better understanding. If you don't agree with the discussion or the author, speak up and say why.\n\nDaniel Pink outlines the premise behind what drives us today.\n\nTime- ​18 minutes.\n\nPART 1, A new operating system\n\nUse this video to connect with the content in Part 1, chapters 1-3.\n\nTime- 10 minutes\n\nPART 2, The three elements: autonomy, mastery, purpose\n\nThis video reviews the elements of Part 2, chapters 4-6.\n\n​Time- 8:28 minutes.\n\nPART 3, The Type I Toolkit\n\n​DRIVE Survey- Are you a Type I or Type X\n\nSurvey time- about 10 minutes.\n\nTwo questions that can change your life.
