        "text": "In the book Drive by Daniel H Pink he talks about various things that could come in handy. Pink talks about how people should change to Motivation 3.0 and leave behind Motivation 2.0.Motivation 3.0 is for someone to continue with their life and have a better future with doing things that you love and would want to do for your rest of your life. Which Motivation also talks about Type X behavior which leads to three types of behavior autonomy mastery and purpose, this explains how people use them to become someone better in their life and show us how that involves with Motivation 3.0. This is something I keep in consideration, that’s why I consider myself in having a Type I behavior that can lead as well with Motivation 3.0.\n\nIn the introduction and chapter one of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Daniel H. Pink expressed how behavioral science can change the common understanding of people’s driving force and suggests a more helpful way to better performance. Pink mentioned that there are two main drives that are powered by behavior. First is the biological drive which comes from within individuals and the second drive comes from without rewards and punishments the environment provides for performing in particular ways. However, a scientist named Harry F. Harlow came up with a third drive after experimenting with monkeys and Harlow called it the “intrinsic motivation.” Harlow said that to completely comprehend the human condition, people have\n\nAccording to researcher Lindner (1998), motivated employees are needed in our rapidly changing workplaces to aid in the survival of organizations. Not only is it important to meet the needs of the consumer, it is equally important that to make sure that associates are taken care of and remain motivated. For this reason, Gibson, Ivancevich, Donnelly and Konopaske (2012) “states much of management’s time is spent addressing the motivation of their employees” (p. 125). According to the Encyclopedia of Small Business (2007), employee motivation is the level of energy, commitment, and creativity employees bring to their jobs; the inner force that drives individuals to accomplish personal and organizational goals (Lindner, 1988). Despite its obvious importance, employee motivation can be an elusive quest for managers due to the multiplicity of incentives that can influence employees to do their best work. The reality is that every employee has different ways to become motivated and the knowledge of how to motivate them is key to organizational success. It is imperative that employers get to know the personal needs and wants of their employees in order to establish tactics in which to motivate each of them. Once achieved, “managers are in a better position to encourage and reward employees to behave in effective ways” (Gibson et al, 2012, p.\n\nIn chapter one of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Author Daniel Pink introduces two types of motivators that he refers to as, “Human operating systems”. Times have changed, and business models are changing as well. Just like we need to upgrade our computer software when it begins to fail. We also need to upgrade our human operating systems, when our current method is not keeping up with the ever-changing business world. The concept of reward and punishment to encourage employees to be more productive is an outdated way of managing people. In order to create a better work environment and increase productivity, we need to upgrade our idea of motivation to include autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\n\nIt’s up to us in the world of business to pinpoint that very subject of our motivation and strive to reach our goals. The book, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us breaks down the gap between what science knows and what business does, on the issue of what drives us. Drive is written by New York Times bestselling author Daniel Pink, who understands both the life of a businessman, as well as a family man. The book is broken\n\nThe work of Harlow and Deci, however, brought a different perspective to the table. The idea that people can be motivated internally by things that cannot be seen or touched was a startling new concept. Intrinsic motivation, or Motivation 3.0 as Pink calls it, was officially born. Motivation 3.0 suggests that “I want to do something” because the sheer act of doing so is personally satisfying and deeply meaningful on a much grander scale. Intrinsic motivation, as the name implies, comes from within an\n\nIn this week’s OB case study, Julie Stewart describes her experience with a group of Taco Bell employees in South Central LA (Kietner, 2013). Julia explained that this particular group of employees are not accustom to receiving praise or other positive forms of feedback. However, Julia learned from her father who was an educator that the ability to humanize subject matter or in other words make it relatable and relevant to the learner engages them and excites them to learn. Utilizing that same concept, Julia’s teaching style of management exploits Thomas’s Progress building block of intrinsic rewards and motivation. In psychology, intrinsic rewards refer to the motivation to engage in behavior arises from within the individual because it is\n\nThe success of any business depends on the productivity and satisfaction of its employees. Employees need to be motivated to work. Motivation can be defined as the inner force that drives individuals to accomplish personal and organizational goals. Motivation can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. For an individual to be motivated in a work situation there must be a need, which the individual would have to perceive a possibility of satisfying through some reward. Intrinsic motivation stems from motivations that are inherent and arise from performing the task of the job itself, which the individual gets a feeling of either positive or negative motivation as a result of\n\nBeing rewarded and recognised for their work or contribution is what keeps an employee motivated to work towards achieving the organisational as well as personal goals. When the employees is motivated by rewards, they will have job satisfaction consequently increasing the productivity of the organisation. It necessitates the need of managers to pay more attention in understanding their employees and come up with suitable types of reward systems for the organisation so that the employees are intrinsically and extrinsically motivated all the time. The hypotheses that I put forward here is to support this statement that effective reward management is critical to\n\nThere are as many different methods of motivating employees today as there are companies operating in the global business environment. Still, some strategies are prevalent across all organizations striving to improve employee motivation. The best employee motivation efforts will focus on what the employees deem to be important. It may be that employees within the same department of the same organization will have different motivators. Many organizations today find that flexibility in job design and reward systems has resulted in employees ' increased longevity with the company, improved productivity, and better morale."
