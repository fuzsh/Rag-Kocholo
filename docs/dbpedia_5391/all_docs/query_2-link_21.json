Sobieniak\n\n--\"Fightin' the Frizzies since 1978\"--\n\nDavid Johnson\n\nThat series was pure genius! Amazing how something like this could get\n\non Saturday mornings. The last show before that had me laughing out\n\nloud on Saturdays was \"The Oddball Couple\" and an occasional \"What's\n\nNew, Mr. Magoo?\"\n\nThe O's in the Tree Weasels ep were called \"O-Horrids\".\n\n--David Johnson"
