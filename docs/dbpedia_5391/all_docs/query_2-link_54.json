        "text": "Ralph Bakshi started the \"creator-driven\" rebirth of cartoons with his NEW ADVENTURES OF MIGHTY MOUSE that came out on CBS in 1987. Many new-style cartoons flourished in the early 90s following Ralph's lead. My work on Mighty Mouse led straight to my own Ren and Stimpy Show a couple years later.\n\nHOW TO FORMAT CARTOONS AND WORK WITH SPONSORS\n\nIf I had total control over not only my cartoons, but also the business and packaging, here is how I would air them.\n\nRalph hired me as the supervising director on Mighty Mouse and then I hired most of crew. It all came together really fast, but Ralph was the one who made sure that we were basically left alone by the network people to do our thing. It was the first cartoon series in at least 20 years that was actually made by cartoonists. We wrote, designed and directed it. I even changed the whole production system. I brought back the old \"Unit- system\" to replace the horrible anti-creative assembly line process that the other studios had been using on TV.\n\nEveryone worked really hard because it was the first chance any of us had to actually have fun making cartoons. It launched many careers and revolutionized cartoons for awhile.\n\nThis system and process should come back. If it doesn't, talented cartoonists in animation are doomed to be replaced by computer geeks who can't draw but can use programs.\n\nNIGHT OF THE BAT BAT\n\nSTORY BY JOHN K. AND JIM REARDON\n\nDIRECTED BY JOHN K.\n\nI always thought Superheroes were funny, because the whole concept is so preposterous. Especially Batman and Robin who don't even have superpowers. They just have fancy underwear. This was my first spoof of the Dark Knight. I did another in the Ripping Friends, years later.\n\nThe story was forged in a funny way. I had the concept and the rough plot basically worked out. I had just hired Jim Reardon out of the infamous Cal Arts. He was a funny cartoonist so I said, \"you'll be a writer.\" The kinds of gags he specialized in were \"one-liners\", gags that at the time seemed dated to me but funny none the less. Bob Hope style throwaway lines. Jim came up with so many that I actually got sort of mad at one point. I said \"Can't you come up with more action or personality gags? This is a cartoon for Christ's sake - not a @#%*@#** sitcom! \"\n\nThen it dawned on me that I could make the one liners part of the plot and Jim and I reworked the story to make fun of Bob Hope type gags. Little did I expect that in a couple years one-liner cartoons would become all the rage in prime time, and here I was thinking they were dated!\n\nI think this is also the first male cow who stands on 2 legs that ever appeared in cartoons. I wanted to have his teats sticking out, but that was too risque for Saturday Morning cartoons at the time so I kept them stuffed in his shorts.\n\nSOME STARS WHO WORKED ON THIS EPISODE:\n\nRALPH\n\nLYNNE NAYLOR\n\nBRUCE TIMM\n\nKEN BOYER\n\nJIM SMITH\n\nBOB JAQUES\n\nEDDIE?\n\nVICKY JENSEN\n\nLIBBY SIMON\n\nISTVAN\n\nJIM GOMEZ\n\nMIKE KAZALEH\n\nANDREW STANTON\n\nJEFF PIGEON\n\nDAVE MARSHALL\n\nBIN\n\nMIKE PATAKI (AS the Cow)\n\nPATRICK PINNEY (MIGHTY MOUSE)\n\nCHARLIE ADLER (BAT BAT)\n\nIf I left anyone out, let me know and I'll add you! It was a long time ago and I don't remember every detail of who did what.\n\nWHO WOULD PAY HARD CASH FOR A SHOW LIKE THIS TODAY?\n\nGO SEE MY FAVORITE EPISODE!\n\nhttp://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2007/09/mighty-mouse-show-episode-2-mightys.html"
