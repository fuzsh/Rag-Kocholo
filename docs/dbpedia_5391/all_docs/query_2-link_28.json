Perhaps a Brady Bunch reboot and a live-action Yu-Gi_Oh could work.\n\nnow\n\nWhat family program ideas do you have for All Access?\n\nIt may not to be considered feasible to place any family/child friendly-type shows since the service does not considered any child/family friendly stuff \"marketable\" to their terms, it ain't that they wouldn't add anything family-focused, it's not that type of service/network that would focus on it.\n\nThis is where the Star Trek animated series from the 1970s comes in place and I think they have the rights to Terrytoons so they could put that also on the service. If you want more, just wait for the CBS-Viacom deal to take shape and I wouldn't be surprised if Sony decides to buy them to enter the streaming wars and forge CBS & Showtime All Access with Pluto TV (just bought today by Viacom), Crackle, and all of Sony's other mini-streaming services into one grand service to be formidable as the WarnerMedia one coming out of this year. Hint: Redstones are going the Murdochs' route of selling Fox to Disney and getting stock in it so getting Sony stock and they can then prosper from the gaming, music, electronics business alongside movies and TV.\n\nThey have quite a fair few actually (aside from the animated Star Trek series, of course):\n\n-The Terrytoons library, including both of the Mighty Mouse \"New Adventures\" series* (the Mighty Mouse short \"Wolf! Wolf!\" is in the public domain)\n\n-Harlem Globetrotters (Hanna-Barbera series that the original Viacom co-produced^)\n\n-Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, plus the animated Laverne and Shirley, and Mork and Mindy series\n\n-The animated Little Rascals series (both of them)\n\n-The Brady Kids\n\n...and those are the ones I can think of at the moment.\n\n*\"The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle and Quackula\" from Filmation, and Ralph Bakshi's \"Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures\".\n\nThey have quite a fair few actually (aside from the animated Star Trek series, of course):\n\n-The Terrytoons library, including both of the Mighty Mouse \"New Adventures\" series* (the Mighty Mouse short \"Wolf!

While it's true that Viacom was originally CBS' syndication division*, remember that they (the current CBS) inherited both the Paramount and (original) Viacom TV libraries after CBS split from Viacom. After the original Paramount-Viacom merger, Viacom's productions were credited under Paramount Television for a while.\n\n*They had to become independent after the FCC said that networks couldn't syndicate their own shows, a ruling that has since been repealed."
