        "text": "Filmation Associates (later known simply as Filmation) was a studio located in Reseda, California that produced animated cartoons for American television. It was founded in 1963 by Lou Schiemer and Hal Sutherland.\n\nHistory\n\nLou Schiemer and the studio's main director Hal Sutherland had previously worked at Larry Harmon's animation studio making Bozo the Clown cartoons and a handful of the Al Brodax Popeye cartoons. After Norm Prescott joined the consortium, they created their own studio, True Line, which made the syndicated cartoon Rod Rocket and produced two theatrical features--Pinocchio In Outer Space and Journey Back To Oz (which featured the voice of Liza Minnelli as Dorothy but was not released to theaters till 1974).\n\nTrue Line would rename itself Filmation Associates in 1963 after Rod Rocket became a syndicated series and they would spend the next three years making commercials. In 1966, CBS tapped them to make The New Adventures of Superman. At that point, they were the main competitor to Hanna-Barbera when it came to accomodating Saturday morning schedules.\n\nPrescott, Schiemer and Sutherland would readily attest that drawing and animating Superman wasn't easy. In contrast to the Fleischer cartoons of 25 years before, the TV Superman cartoons were hopelessly wooden and repetitive. Regardless, it delivered big ratings. Filmation's main output consisted of licensed properties. They would animate DC heroes such as Aquaman, the Teen Titans, Batman and Justice League of America. In following years, they would make the numerous Archie shows as well as Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down? (1970), Star Trek: The Animated Series (1973, Emmy winner), Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (1972), The New Adventures of Flash Gordon (1979), The Ghost Busters (live action series, 1975), Ghostbusters (1986, based on the 1975 series, not the 1984 movie) and The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle (1979).\n\nIn the 1980s, Filmation released two theatrical features--Happily Ever After and Pinocchio And The Emperor of the Night--that not only fared poorly both critically and financially, but the Disney Corporation sought to have their releases halted citing intellectual property (in spite of the fact that the source stories are public domain).\n\nIn 1989, the L'Oreal cosmetics company bought the Filmation studio from Westinghouse (Group W) and closed the studio. Ownership of the Filmation library is varied, with CBS Television Distribution owning Star Trek: The Animated Series, The Brady Kids and The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle, Warner Bros. Television owning the DC Comics heroes line, The New Adventures of Gilligan, Gilligan's Planet and The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show, and The Walt Disney Company (through 20th Television) and NBCUniversal (through DreamWorks Classics) owning other properties.\n\nList of shows produced by Filmation Associates\n\nRod Rocket - Syndicated, 1963 (under True Line name)\n\nThe New Adventures of Superman - CBS, 1966\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth - ABC, 1967\n\nThe Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure - CBS, 1967\n\nFantastic Voyage - ABC, 1968\n\nThe Archie Show - CBS, 1968\n\nThe Batman/Superman Hour - CBS, 1968\n\nThe Hardy Boys - ABC, 1969\n\nThe Archie Comedy Hour - CBS, 1969\n\nSabrina and the Groovie Goolies - CBS, 1970\n\nWill the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down? - ABC, 1970\n\nArchie's Funhouse Starring the Giant Jukebox - CBS, 1970\n\nArchie's TV Funnies - CBS, 1971\n\nSabrina the Teenage Witch - CBS, 1971\n\nABC Saturday Superstar Movie - ABC, 1972 (selected features)\n\nFat Albert and the Cosby Kids - CBS, 1972\n\nThe Brady Kids - ABC, 1972\n\nLassie's Rescue Rangers - ABC, 1973\n\nMission: Magic - ABC, 1973\n\nStar Trek: The Animated Series - NBC, 1973 (Emmy winner)\n\nMy Favorite Martians - CBS, 1973\n\nThe New Adventures of Gilligan - ABC, 1974\n\nShazam! - CBS, 1974 (live action)\n\nUncle Croc's Block - ABC, 1975\n\nThe Shazam!/Isis Hour - CBS, 1975 (live action)\n\nThe Ghost Busters - CBS, 1975 (live action)\n\nThe Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty - 1975\n\nTarzan: Lord of the Jungle - CBS, 1976\n\nArk II - CBS, 1976 (live action)\n\nSpace Academy - CBS, 1977 (live action)\n\nThe Archie/Sabrina Hour - NBC, 1977 (split up as Super Witch and Bang Shang Lalapalooza at mid-season)\n\nThe Young Sentinels - NBC, 1977 (retitled The Space Sentinels at mid-season)\n\nTarzan and the Super 7 - CBS, 1977\n\nFabulous Funnies - NBC, 1978\n\nThe New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle - CBS, 1979\n\nThe New Fat Albert Show - CBS, 1979\n\nJason of Star Command - CBS, 1979 (live action)\n\nThe New Adventures of Flash Gordon - NBC, 1979\n\nThe Tom and Jerry Comedy Show - CBS, 1980\n\nTarzan and the Lone Ranger - CBS, 1980\n\nSport Billy - NBC, 1980\n\nBlackstar - CBS, 1981\n\nTarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro - CBS, 1981\n\nGilligan's Planet - CBS, 1982\n\nHe-Man and the Masters of the Universe - Syndicated, 1983\n\nShe-Ra: Princess of Power - Syndicated, 1985\n\nGhostbusters - Syndicated, 1986 (based on the 1975 CBS show)\n\nBravestarr - Syndicated, 1987"
