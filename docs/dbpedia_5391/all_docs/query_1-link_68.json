        "text": "Disney D23 has announced a bevy of details for the upcoming 2024 D23 Expo. In this article, explore everything that has been announced so far in terms of presentations and show floor details. Information has also been announced for the reservation process and talent central offering!\n\nWith less than one month to go to the highly anticipated D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event presented by Visa®, Disney today revealed details about what fans will be able to experience at the Anaheim Convention Center during this sold-out event, which will include an outstanding lineup of over 230 panels and presentations, show floor offerings, and Talent Central interactions. This announcement builds upon plans previously shared about this year’s D23 gathering, which is set to be bigger and better than ever before.\n\n“We are thrilled for fans of all ages to join us in Anaheim next month for what will truly be the ultimate Disney fan experience,” said Michael Vargo, head of D23: The Official Disney Fan Club. “This year, D23 has been reimagined to showcase even more of what they love from across the worlds of Disney. Guests will enjoy the incredible programming and show floor offerings we have in store at the Anaheim Convention Center, where our exceptional storytelling and experiences will come to life through spectacular entertainment with many of the creative masterminds behind the magic.”\n\nOver 55 panels and presentations across five stages are coming to the multi-day fan experience, showcasing the very best in creative storytelling and innovation from across The Walt Disney Company. Disney’s award-winning storytelling engines, along with the Walt Disney Archives and Disney Experiences, have carefully curated an expansive lineup of extraordinary panels and presentations featuring behind-the-scenes access, rarely seen treasures, first-look showcases, and highly anticipated reunions. And fan-favorite presentations including D23 Mousequerade: The Ultimate Disney Costume Contest, Disney Princess – The Concert, Disney Character Voices: Inside the Studio, and more will once again return to the Anaheim Convention Center.\n\nThis year’s show floor is the largest in the event’s history and provides even more ways for fans to interact with beloved brands, stories, and talent, including immersive pavilions from Disney Experiences, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Disney+, Hulu, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, National Geographic, and more. There’s something for everyone with incredibly immersive experiences for all fans. And, for the first time, Avatar will have a full pavilion, ESPN and ABC News will have a presence on the show floor, while Lucasfilm’s groundbreaking ILM Stagecraftä technology will make its D23 debut for fans to interact with. The Walt Disney Archives has curated its biggest exhibition in history with “A Great Big Beautiful Car Show.” Talent Central will once again offer guests the opportunity to meet many of the extraordinary stars and creative visionaries behind popular films and series, including Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Descendants: The Rise of Red, The Simpsons, Raven’s Home, and more.\n\nFor the first time, D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event will expand beyond the Anaheim Convention Center for the largest footprint in event history, with events and programming throughout the city of Anaheim, including the first ever D23 Day at Disneyland Resort on August 8, three nights of larger-than-life evening showcases at the Honda Center on August 9, 10, and 11, and D23 Day at Angel Stadium on August 4. Announced earlier this week, to celebrate the fans who are at the heart of the magic, Disney launched a company-wide sweepstakes including 23 spectacular offerings. D23: The Ultimate Disney Sweepstakes – FANtastic Prizes features an impressive lineup of exclusive prizes and engaging experiences that only Disney can deliver. The full list of prizes can be found on fantasticprizes.d23.com.\n\nONE-OF-A-KIND STAGE PROGRAMMING\n\nThe reimagined Spotlight Stage will delight guests on the show floor with exclusive programming featuring content from National Geographic, Beauty and the Beast on Broadway, Disney on the Yard, Lorcana, Disney Global Ambassadors, and more.
