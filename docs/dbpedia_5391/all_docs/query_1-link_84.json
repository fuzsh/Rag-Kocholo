Along with the main series, the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise released spinoff shows Kamp Koral: SpongeBob’s Under Years and The Patrick Star Show, as well as the movies The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, and The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, before finally turning its focus on an installment centered on Bikini Bottom’s favorite anthropomorphic squirrel. Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie is now available on Netflix.\n\nThe CGI/live-action spinoff movie, the first franchise spinoff film starring a supporting character, gives appreciable insight into Sandy’s origins and puts her in the position to be Bikini Bottom’s hero. Per the Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie trailer, when B.O.O.T.S., the science lab Sandy works for, scoops Bikini Bottom out of the ocean, she enlists the help of SpongeBob and her family to understand the lab’s motive and save the city. Although the movie has received divisive reviews, the familiar voice performances of its cast make for a fun and nostalgic adventure comedy.\n\nCarolyn Lawrence as Sandy Cheeks\n\nActor: Carolyn Lawrence was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Lawrence’s first credited performance was in the drama movie Little Man Tate as Sorority Girl, and she pursued a few other minor live-action roles across the 90s in TV shows such as Wings and Seventh Heaven.

The journey is difficult and dangerous, causing Sandy to call on her family of traveling circus performers to escort them safely. However, upon arrival, Sandy realizes that B.O.O.T.S has nefarious plans for her undersea friends and has been using her to spy on Bikini Bottom for so long as she’s lived there.\n\nTom Kenny as SpongeBob\n\nActor: Tom Kenny is a renowned voice performer from Syracuse, New York. His love of and propensity toward stand-up comedy led to early career appearances on late-night talk shows and sketch comedy series, including The Edge and Mr. Show with Bob and David, for which he first gained notice. Though, as deft as his live performances were, Kenny’s true talent lies in voice acting, proven by three decades of his phenomenal efforts for beloved characters like Heffer Wolfe (Rocko’s Modern Life), Mayor (Powerpuff Girls), Dog (CatDog), and SpongeBob. For SpongeBob alone, Kenny has won numerous Annie and Daytime Emmy awards.\n\nNotable Movies & TV Shows:\n\nCharacter: Kenny plays the titular yellow sponge SpongeBob in Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie. More of a travel companion than a valuable sidekick, SpongeBob offers plenty of laughs and silly asides as he races to Texas alongside Sandy.

As a result, Nahmee used Sandy’s life in Bikini Bottom to spy on its residents to support her ultimate ploy of selling them for children to enjoy.\n\nClancy Brown as Mr. Krabs\n\nActor: Clancy Brown hails from Urbana, Ohio, and has been acting since the ’80s.
