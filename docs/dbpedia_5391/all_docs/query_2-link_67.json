        "text": "TELEVISION'S CRAVING FOR animation continues to be as ravenous as the appetites of those sinister cats on the film maker Ralph Bakshi's ''Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures,'' Saturday mornings on CBS. While just about all program schedules have currently been offering a cornucopia of animated holiday fare, animators are already busy at their drawing boards crafting colorful fantasies for 1988 and '89.\n\nIndeed, the small screen's insatiability may in some measure be temporarily satisfied next fall when the first animated mini-series in television history is presented on prime time. The four-hour CBS production, as yet untitled, was conceived as a kind of Snoopy history of the United States, from Charlie Brown & Co, and their creator, Charles Schulz. Over four nights, the Peanuts gang will be wearing the contemporary dress of the days when the Mayflower landed and the Constitution was written and the Wright brothers first flew, plus five other milestones in American history.\n\nHistorians have not recorded that Ben Franklin borrowed a kite from Charlie Brown to fly during a spare moment while co-drafting the Constitution, but such an event will occur in the course of the mini-series, to provide a few laughs along with an appreciation of the significance of the Bill of Rights that youngsters (and a dog named Snoopy) might have acquired in Colonial days by volunteering to do odd jobs around Constitution Hall in Philadelphia (Charlie Brown holds delegates' horses, Snoopy is ''doordog'' and Lucy Van Pelt is a waterperson).\n\nThe network is committed to eight half-hour programs, says Bill Melendez, the president of Bill Melendez ProducMtions, which has produced 28 Charlie Brown television specials in 32 years, from ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' in 1955 to ''Happy New Year, Charlie Brown'' in 1985.\n\nSpecials aside, cartoons now pervade television's after-school hours, in addition to their long-held domination of the Saturday-morning schedule. In the early 1980's, for instance, the three commercial networks, along with independent stations, were providing a choice of roughly three to four hours of animated fare every weekday afternoon. Then it dawned on toy manufacturers that they could broadcast, in effect, 30-minute commercials by making their toys the heroes of the cartoons. This development, coupled with the ever-widening presence of cable TV, is responsible for much of the 11 1/2 hours of cartoons now available during the same time period.\n\nYet, this abundance of animated work on television has not proved the boon to Hollywood animators that it might have only a few years back. The grim tidings this holiday season is that 47 percent of the animation force in the world's cartoon capital is on layoff.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
