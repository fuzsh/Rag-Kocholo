        "text": "Terrytoons was a studio in New Rochelle, New York that produced animated cartoons for theatrical release. Its founder and chief was Paul Terry.\n\nPaul Terry founded the studio in 1929 with Frank Moser, with Audio-Cinema studios providing funding and workspace in the Bronx. Terry and Moser worked with no pay until Audio-Cinema recouped its investment on the first films, released by Educational Pictures.\n\nThe cartoons were haphazardly animated and very bizarre, populated generally by mice. It was assembly-line animation with Terry regulating the films with tight budgets and gauging a cartoon ready by how high the stack of animation was. Farmer Al Falfa was the studio's first regular star, and the films in general relied mainly on background music over dialogue. The themes of the cartoon were formulaic and repetitive, with usually no coherent direction. Sometime later in the 1930s, 20th Century Fox took over distribution of the cartoons.\n\nThis pretty much continued after Terry broke ground on his own studio in 1934, and many one-shot cartoons were churned out under formula alone. Two films featuring an imperiled heroine, Fannie Zilch, were created, and the villain in the films, Oil Can Harry would be revived later. Terrytoons graduated to color films in 1938, one of the last studios to do so. Gandy Goose and Dinky Duck would be born during this era. It was in 1941 that Terry would capitalize on the success of Superman, which the Fleischer studio brilliantly animated, by creating Super Mouse, which would eventually become Mighty Mouse. It was in the late 1940s Mighty Mouse films that Oil Can Harry would be revived as a villainous cat. Through the 1940s, the Terry cartoons were so bland and listless that theaters would run a Terrytoons film last in a program just to clear the auditorium. As bad a reputation as Terrytoons had, it did garner four Academy Award nominations (1941's All Out For V, 1944's My Boy Johnny, the 1945 Mighty Mouse cartoon Gypsy Life, and the 1958 Silly Sidney cartoon Sidney's Family Tree). In the late 1940s, the studio brought in Jim Tyer, an expatriate animator from Paramount's Famous Studios. Tyer's slapdash style of animation has been widely acclaimed as inherently hilarious for its sheer lack of quality control.\n\nHeckle and Jeckle, two mischievous magpies, were created in 1946 and would become the studio's second biggest stars. In the 1950s, Little Roquefort (a mouse) and the Terry Bears would emerge. In 1955, Paul Terry sold the Terrytoons studio to CBS for $1 million and retired, turning the reins over to financial chief Bill Weiss. CBS immediately capitalized by launching Mighty Mouse Playhouse on Saturday mornings, showcasing Mighty Mouse cartoons, and Barker Bill's Cartoon Show Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Colgate Toothpaste sponsored Mighty Mouse's show. In 1956, Terrytoons films were spotlighted in the summer series CBS Cartoon Theater, hosted by Dick Van Dyke. That series begat The Heckle and Jeckle Cartoon Show. CBS also began syndicating the Terrytoons product through its CBS Films division (later renamed as the original CBS Enterprises in 1968) around that time.\n\nIn 1955, CBS brought comic strip artist and former UPA staffer Gene Deitch to give the studio a creative kick in the pants. He created the Terrytoons \"smiley-box\" logo (pictured above) and he churned out some cartoons that critics actually liked with characters like John Doormat, Clint Clobber, Flebus, Gaston Le Crayon, and his classic TV star Tom Terrific. However, Weiss wasn't thrilled about the Terry studio becoming a renaissance art house, choosing instead to fall back on the same old. It was said that he wanted Deitch out from day one. In 1958, Deitch developed a pilot for CBS prime time, The Easy Winners (about life through the eyes of two toddlers--33 years before Rugrats), which did not sell. In 1959, Deitch left to helm Rembrandt Films, a Czechoslovakia-based studio that would make made-for-TV Popeye cartoons and theatrical Tom and Jerry cartoons.\n\nTerrytoons films released to theaters took on the appearance of made-for-TV budgeted efforts, and the studio created their first all-cartoon made-for-TV effort, The Deputy Dawg Show. Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle appeared in cartoons that made their earlier efforts look like Disney made them. Other characters from the 1960s included Lariat Sam, Possible Possum, James Hound, Sad Cat, the Martian Moochers, and the Mighty Heroes. In 1964, the Total Television company (Underdog) created a proposed series called The Colossal Show and farmed the pilot out to be animated at Terrytoons. A comic take on Ancient Rome (eight years before Hanna-Barbera's The Roman Holidays), it did not sell. Ralph Bakshi, who started as a cel inker at the studio and took it upon himself to become an animator then a director, would make most of these cartoons and would create the Mighty Heroes for CBS's Saturday morning line-up. After that, the Terrytoons studio shut down. Bill Weiss farmed out two pilots for CBS in 1967--The Ruby Eye Of The Monkey God and Sally Sargent were animated by the Fred Calvert studio. Neither pilot sold, and they would both go into the Mighty Mouse package in syndication. The Fred Calvert studio was commissioned in 1970 to animate Mighty Mouse for Zestabs children's vitamins commercials, using original animation and reusing and altering animation from classic Mighty Mouse films.\n\nCBS Enterprises, the original TV distributor of the Terrytoons library, became Viacom Enterprises in 1971 after CBS spun off its syndication operations due to a 1970 FCC ruling prohibiting the broadcast networks from distributing their own shows in syndication. When Viacom acquired Paramount Communications in 1994, the rights to the Terrytoons library passed to Paramount Pictures (taking over from 20th Century Fox) for theatrical re-release and to Paramount Domestic Television (which had absorbed Viacom Enterprises) for TV distribution. Following Viacom's reacquisition of CBS in 1999 and subsequent corporate restructuring that saw Viacom split into two companies (with the original Viacom becoming what is now CBS Corporation and the current Viacom being spun off from the former) in 2005, CBS reacquired the Terrytoons library as a result. CBS Television Distribution now syndicates the Terrytoons catalogue for television, while the theatrical re-release rights remain with Paramount on behalf of CBS, and home video rights are with Paramount Home Media Distribution via CBS Home Entertainment.\n\nIn 1999, Nickelodeon Animation Studios attempted a reboot of Terrytoons stars and created a pilot, Curbside With Heckle & Jeckle. It did not sell.\n\nContents\n\n1 Characters\n\n1.1 Characters with two or more theatrical shorts\n\n1.2 Characters created specifically for television\n\n2 Terrytoons TV Series\n\nCharacters\n\nCharacters with two or more theatrical shorts\n\nCharacter(s) From To Notes Farmer Al Falfa 1931 1946 Kiko the Kangaroo 1936 1937 Fannie Zilch and Oil Can Harry 1935 1937 Oil Can Harry revived as cat for Mighty Mouse cartoons Puddy the Pup 1936 1938 Gandy Goose 1938 1955 Sourpuss 1938 1951 Mainly co-starred with Gandy Goose Dinky Duck 1939 1957 Nancy 1941 1941 Comic strip character by Ernie Bushmiller Mighty Mouse 1942 1961 as Super Mouse, 1942-44 Heckle and Jeckle 1946 1966 Dimwit 1953 1957 stand-alone cartoons (had co-starred with Heckle and Jeckle) The Terry Bears 1951 1956 Phoney Baloney 1954 1957 Little Roquefort 1949 1955 The Dingbat 1949 1952 First appeared in Gandy Goose cartoon Half Pint 1951 1951 Good Deed Daly 1956 1956 Clint Clobber 1957 1959 Gaston Le Crayon 1957 1959 John Doormat 1957 1958 Hector Heathcote 1959 1963 Silly Sydney 1958 1963 Hashimoto 1958 1963 Foofle 1959 1960 Luno 1963 1964 James Hound 1966 1967 Astronut 1964 1966 First appeared on Deputy Dawg TV show; cartoons were released to theaters through 1971 Sad Cat 1965 1966 Cartoons were released to theaters through 1968 Duckwood 1964 1964 First appeared on Deputy Dawg TV show Possible Possum 1965 1966 Character of Macon Mouse first appeared as Mischa Mouse on the Deputy Dawg TV show; cartoons were released to theaters from 1968 to 1971 The Martian Moochers 1966 1966\n\nCharacters created specifically for television\n\nTom Terrific\n\nLariat Sam\n\nDeputy Dawg (Selected cartoons were released to theaters through 1971)\n\nThe Mighty Heroes (Selected cartoons were released to theaters through 1971)\n\nTerrytoons TV Series"
