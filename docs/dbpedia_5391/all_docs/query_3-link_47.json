        "text": "Weekly Digital Disc Picks – January 5, 2010\n\nThere’s not a lot of completely new product available this week, but there is an absolute flood of low-cost two season packs. We’ve only drawn attention to the most notable ones, but there are more that you can find, mostly distributed by Universal.\n\nFirst, the DVD picks:\n\n10 Things I Hate About You\n\nBig Love: The Complete Third Season\n\nBurn Notice: Seasons 1 and 2\n\nChuck: The Complete Second Season: Also available on Blu-Ray\n\nCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: Single disc edition\n\nCloudy With A Chance of Meatballs: Two disc edition. Also available on Blu-Ray\n\nD-Gray Man: Season 2, Part 2\n\nDoctor Who: The Keys of Marinus (Story 5): A story with the first Doctor (William Hartnell).\n\nDoctor Who: The Twin Dilemma (Story 137): A story with the sixth Doctor (Colin Baker).\n\nThe Final Destination: The fourth in the series, not the first.\n\nFrontline: The Warning: Alex: The episode of the PBS documentary series about the roots of the economic collapse.\n\nFrontline: A Death in Tehran: Alex: Another episode of Frontline, this one covering the first wave of student protests in Tehran, focusing on Neda Soltani, a young woman who was killed during the protests.\n\nGhost Hunters: The Best of Ghost Hunters\n\nIron Man: Armored Adventures, Vol. 2\n\nJane Austen Complete Collection\n\nKendra: The Complete First Season\n\nMighty Mouse: The New Adventures Complete Series: Blaine: This is the Ralph Bakshi series, which I enjoyed at a relatively young age.\n\nNighthead Genesis Complete\n\nNova: Hubble’s Amazing Rescue: Alex: Episode of the PBS science documentary series covering the work to save the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nPetite Princess Yucie Complete\n\nThe Philanthropist: The Complete Series\n\nPsych: Seasons 1 and 2: These seasons reviewed here.\n\nThe Second Best Science Fiction Movie Ever Made: Blaine: I’ve never heard of the movie, the cast, the director, or the distributor, but the title is a fairly lofty claim to make, so I thought I’d point it out.\n\nSuper Friends, Season One, Volume One: Blaine: This is the ninth Super Friends release on DVD, and the first to collect episodes from the original 1973 series. What’s wrong with releasing these things in order, I ask you? At this rate, it’ll probably take 11 releases to finally have them all out on DVD.\n\nYou’re Under Arrest: Fast & Furious Collection 2: Alex: The second season of the show continues.\n\nNow, the Blu-Ray picks:\n\n10 Things I Hate About You\n\nBattlestar Galactica: Season One: Blaine: The rerelease of the new series, including the miniseries. Previously released on DVD and HD DVD, this is the first time the season has been made available on Blu-Ray individually. There’s already a Blu-Ray set of the entire series available.\n\nCheaper By The Dozen 2\n\nChuck: Complete Second Season\n\nCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\n\nD-Gray Man: Season 1, Part 1: Alex: My best bet explanation for the delay between the DVD version and the Blu-Ray version is getting permission of the Japanese company who made the series. There was a semi-recent episode of Anime News Network’s ANN Cast which went into this – the episode for 12/10/2009, with Shawn Klempner of RightStuf.com.\n\nDawn of the Dead\n\nDogtown and Z Boys\n\nThe Final Destination\n\nThe Green Berets\n\nThe Last Starfighter\n\nRiding Giants\n\nThe Rundown\n\nFinally, the picks of the week. Alex says, “while Season 2 of Chuck is already in my Netflix Queue, I can’t make it my pick because I haven’t seen it yet. However, I can reccomend the two-pack of Seasons 1 & 2 of Burn Notice, to get you ready for the upcoming release of Season 3 on DVD & Blu-Ray (whenever that’s due). As far as the Anime side is concerned, I would also reccomend the You’re Under Arrest set. Normally I wouldn’t reccomend coming in on the middle of an anime series, but You’re Under Arrest is episodic enough that there shouldn’t be any problems getting the hang of things.” Blaine says, “I have also not seen this season of Chuck, but I’ve pre-ordered the Blu-Ray. Based on what I’ve seen, I’d go with Psych or Battlestar Galactica, depending on what player(s) you have and what you already own.”"
