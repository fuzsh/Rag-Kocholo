        "text": "Well, around the time you were born and before; some of them did have more exposure. Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle, at least. I remember my parents talking about watching Deputy Dawg, but I had never seen it. Then, at some point around there or afterwards, it came up in syndication, for awhile, then was never seen again.\n\nFor some reason, Terrytoons and several other studios just did not get the exposure Looney Tunes did, and then Hanna Barbera. Those are what dominated syndicated TV. (It was when I got Lenburg's Cartoon Encyclopedia, I saw how vast the Terrytoons library, along with Walter Lantz, UPA, etc were beyond just the lead stars). And for one thing, they maintained a strong network base (The post-48's for the Looney Tunes; and new shows for HB; many of which were new versions of old shows).\n\nIn the cable age; the same thing happens. WB and HB gain the solid base in Nick and USA first; and then Cartoon Network. The companies who owned other cable outlets, and had the rights to these other libraries for the most part just sat on them. They did not have dedicated cartoon channels, so if they did come up, it would be occasionally in cartoon blocks. Or they passed around between Viacom, Disney and other cable stations.\n\nMy apologies in advance to any Terrytoons fans, but I think it has less to do with under-exposure than it does with quality; generally, Paul Terry's cartoons just weren't as good as the shorts produced by Warner Bros., Disney and MGM.\n\nI was born in 1969 and I grew up watching all of those shorts, and I never thought they were as good as the stuff Looney Tunes, the Mouse House, et al had produced. The only Terrytoons shorts I found even remotely above average were Heckle and Jeckle. There was just something lacking in Paul Terry's work.\n\nYou do have a point, as many people see the redeeming factor of the Terrytoons was the animation work of Jim Tyer, but that doesn't mean they were less popular. From the 50's until the late 80's they were regularly shown on TV, but from what I understand once USA Network bought the rights to the cartoons, that was pretty much the end point for the characters on TV. CBS Television owns the rights to the cartoons now, and I'm sure the reason they don't put them back on TV, other than a suitable place to put them, is that hardly any other theatrical cartoons are on TV, save Tom And Jerry. With the Looney Tunes, non-Tom and Jerry MGM's, and even Disney's shorts not shown on TV anymore, why should the Terrytoons?\n\nThey really do need to release the cartoons on DVD though. And apparently there are new projects in the works, such as a Mighty Mouse film being worked on by Nickelodeon Movies. And Jerry Beck said on Shokus that Ralph Bakshi's Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures will be released to DVD sometime soon.\n\nBeing born in the mid-70s, I grew up watching the Terrytoons shorts on TV as a kid (living near Chicago, the third-biggest media market in the country, probably helped). I watched Deputy Dawg, Heckle and Jeckle, and Mighty Mouse, including the latter's late-80s revival. Still, I did like the Warner Bros. output better; as others said, Terrytoons weren't exactly up there with \"What's Opera Doc?\"\n\nThe studio's owner was from what I've read basically the \"anti-Walt Disney\"---his only concern was how profitable the shorts were, and treated the whole operation and characters as just a business. Which might explain why his was one of the first studios' shorts to make it to television in the 50s, when Terry sold the shorts and studio to CBS wholesale in the mid-50s; CBS have since owned the characters to this day. While CBS at first seemed to make use of the characters (\"Mighty Mouse Playhouse\" in the 50s and 60s, some revivals in the 70s-80s), these days, they're pretty much just letting the shorts sit on a shelf collecting dust; I can't recall seeing anything from them on TV since the late 80s. CBS also isn't quite the massive media conglomerate (save when Viacom bought it out in the 90s, though they've since split into two entities again) with a trillion media outlets that Time-Warner or Disney are, which also might not help them much. Finally, as noted above, theatrical shorts on TV these days are pretty much extinct, no thanks to said conglomerates' (mis-)management.\n\nAbout the only use CBS has made of the Terrytoons library in the past decade or so to my knowledge was:\n\n- A \"power of cheese\" promotional ad for the dairy industry using Mighty Mouse (in a non-speaking role).\n\n- Apple Computer is licensing the rights to the name \"Mighty Mouse\" for the name of their line of computer mice.\n\nAbout the only hope for the Terrytoons characters at this point is probably either DVD releases, CBS putting the shorts online (maybe Hulu, or CBS' own site?), or someone at CBS remembering they still have these characters and bother to make use of them in some project (like the aforementioned Mighty Mouse movie, which given I haven't heard much about it lately must not be going along as planned?)...\n\n-B.\n\nI think the others said it best. It's a combination with the rights issue and the fact that the Terrytoons shorts just aren't good.\n\nI'd say the only Terry shorts that are genuinely good are the ones made under Gene Deitch's supervision. They had its problems (like how they were too cheap to hire women actresses to voice female characters, leaving Alan Swift or Lionel Wilson to do the voices) but they were clever and sometimes even imaginative, at least. Bill Weiss was an idiot for firing Gene after only a year and a half.\n\nAnd Deitch was probably the only guy at the studio to take advantage of Tyer's animation for full effect.\n\nI think the others said it best.

If so, then I find it shocking to learn that he did something good. Although it's opinion though. Maybe those cartoons sucked as well and you guys just happen to think differently.\n\nGene Deitch is very much an underrated talent. He's done great cartoons over the years, from his time at Terrytoons to those made when he moved to Prague. It's a shame that he's often associated with \"Tom and Jerry\" despite the wide and varied work he did.\n\nYou can read his autobio here."
