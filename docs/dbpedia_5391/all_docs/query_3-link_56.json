The first week, a replica of the Ancient Mew card featured in the movie was given out. The following weeks gave out various cards for legendary birds. (In Japan, one of the promotional cards was a special edition of Slowking/Yadoking as drawn by the voice actor who portrayed him, famed comedian—and infamously bad artist—Masatoshi Hamada.)\n\nDuring the Japanese release, the first run of Ancient Mew had ‘Nintendo’ spelled as ‘Nintedo’. This was corrected for future runs (and the US release) of the card.\n\nThe film was financially successful. It earned $9,250,000 on opening day,[7] which was only less than $1 million behind the opening day of its predecessor. However, it only reached #3 for its opening weekend, grossing $19,575,608.

The latter scene was written by Chuck Jones as a way to debunk fellow animation director Robert Clampett's claims throughout the 1970s that he alone created Bugs, and Clampett's name is notably missing from Bugs's list, as a result of the conflict between Jones and Clampett\"\n\nMIGHTY MOUSE AND THE GREAT SPACE CHASE (1982)\n\nPointless wiki facts--\"The serialized Mighty Mouse story \"The Great Space Chase\" from The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle Saturday morning series made it into a 1982 movie by Filmation.\n\nThe film got a big-screen release, a re-release as a kids' matinee film, and was released on VHS.\n\nStar Wars mania was strong in 1982 with The Empire Strikes Back and the upcoming Return of the Jedi.

CBS Home Entertainment via Paramount has not yet released Mighty Mouse in the Great Space Chase on DVD or Blu-ray.\"\n\nHEATHCLIFF THE MOVIE (1986)\n\nPointless wiki info--\"Heathcliff: The Movie is a 1986 animated film from DIC Entertainment, released by Atlantic Releasing under their Clubhouse Pictures label.

As with The Animated Series, the film stars Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman, as well as the voices of Mark Hamill, Dana Delany, Hart Bochner, Stacy Keach, Abe Vigoda and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. The film's storyline introduces Andrea Beaumont, an old love interest of Bruce Wayne's, who returns to Gotham City, restarting their romance.

The original idea was to release the film as direct-to-video, but the studio decided for a theatrical release, giving the filmmakers a strenuous eight-month schedule. Mask of the Phantasm received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the film for its animation style, dialogue and acting, but it was a box office bomb due to the decision to release the film in theaters on such short notice.

The third animated feature from Nelvana, it was directed by Dale Schott, written by Peter Sauder and produced by Nelvana's three founders (Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith). It starred the voices of Alyson Court, Cree Summer, Maxine Miller and Hadley Kay.\n\nIn the second film based on the Care Bears franchise, a character called The Great Wishing Star (voiced by Chris Wiggins) tells the origins of the Care Bears, and the story of their first Caring Mission. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse lead the other Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins, as they come to the aid of Christy, a young camper who is tempted by an evil shape-shifting figure named Dark Heart. The film marked the first appearance of the Care Bear Cubs, who also had their own line of toys.\n\nA New Generation was made over a seven-month period at Nelvana's Toronto facilities, with additional work handled by Taiwan's Wang Film Productions, and involved several crew members who had worked on the original Care Bears Movie. Patricia Cullen served as composer, and Los Angeles musicians Dean and Carol Parks worked on the film's six songs. The Samuel Goldwyn Company, a U.S. independent distributor, was originally set to release this follow-up; demands from the film's producers caused the company to give up. To the chagrin of Goldwyn's founder, the worldwide rights were then acquired by Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures.\n\nUpon its release in March 1986, A New Generation gained mostly negative critical attention; some of its key elements received comparisons to the German legend Faust and J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. The film grossed only US$8.5 million in North America, about a third of what the previous instalment earned, and over US$12 million worldwide. It was released on video in August 1986, and on DVD in April 2003. This was the last animated feature for Columbia until Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within in 2001. A third film starring the title characters, The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland, was released in 1987.\""
