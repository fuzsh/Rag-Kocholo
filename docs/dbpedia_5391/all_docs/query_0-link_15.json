        "text": "Quick facts for kids\n\nThe Mighty Heroes Genre Animation, comedy Directed by\n\nRalph Bakshi\n\nRobert Taylor\n\nVoices of\n\nHerschel Bernardi\n\nLionel Wilson\n\nCountry of origin United States Original language(s) English No. of seasons 1 No. of episodes 20 (list of episodes) Production Executive producer(s) William M. Weiss Running time 30 min Production company(s)\n\nCBS\n\nTerrytoons\n\nDistributor\n\nViacom\n\nParamount Domestic Television\n\nCBS Paramount Television\n\nCBS Television Distribution\n\nRelease Original network CBS Audio format Monaural Original release October 29, 1966 ( ) – March 11, 1967 (1967-03-11)\n\nThe Mighty Heroes was an animated television series created by Ralph Bakshi for the Terrytoons company. The original show debuted on CBS, on October 29, 1966, and ran for one season with 20 episodes.\n\nThe stories took place in Good Haven, a fictitious city that was continually beset by various supervillains. When trouble occurred, the city launched a massive fireworks display to summon a quintet of high-flying superheroes into action—Strong Man, Rope Man, Tornado Man, Cuckoo Man and Diaper Man.\n\nPremise\n\nIn Act 1 of each episode, the team members were portrayed as accident-prone bunglers. A typical occurrence had them in combat hopelessly tangled together offering each other stock apologies, often while falling en masse until they were captured by the villain. In Act 2, however, having escaped the villain's deathtrap in the cliffhanger, the team always managed to regroup and fight with proper coordination to win the day. Their villains included the Drifter, the Ghost Monster, the Enlarger, the Frog, the Junker, the Monsterizer, the Toy Man, the Shocker, the Shrinker, and the Scarecrow.\n\nPost first-run syndication\n\nReruns of The Mighty Heroes were eventually syndicated by Viacom (now CBS Television Distribution) in the 1970s as part of the Mighty Mouse package. There have also been two licensed VHS releases. Ten Mighty Heroes theatrical shorts also appeared in movie theaters between 1969 and 1971.\n\nThey appeared in animated form as guest stars in the episode \"Heroes and Zeroes\" of the late 1980s series Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, produced by Bakshi, in which they had all retired and were running the accounting firm of Man, Man, Man, Man and Man. Even Diaper Man had grown up, evidenced by his having a mustache.\n\nThey were included in the 1999 Terrytoons pilot Curbside.\n\nComic books\n\nThere are three comic book adaptations of The Mighty Heroes. The first series was published by Dell Comics in 1967 and ran for four issues. The second series was published by Spotlight Comics in 1987 and ran for one issue. The third series was published by Marvel Comics in 1998 and also ran for one issue.\n\nCharacters\n\nAll five of the Mighty Heroes had the power to fly. Individually, they were:\n\nStrong Man has super strength. He speaks with a friendly farm-boy type of accent and holds a civilian job as a mechanic. His favorite fighting move is his \"jet-propelled blow\", by which he flies into a villain fist-first.\n\nRope Man is a sailor who works at the docks. Erudite with a British accent, he can transform into a seemingly unending length of rope. He can use his hands like lassos, and can even weave himself into a net. The drawbacks to his powers are that he frequently gets tangled up or knotted, more often than not around his own teammates.\n\nTornado Man is a television weather forecaster who can spin himself into a tornado. He often sucks the villains into his vortex, then shoots them out toward the nearest wall. He speaks in a wheezy voice.\n\nCuckoo Man is a bird shop owner whose powers are the most limited of the group. Unlike the other heroes, who can fly with no effort, Cuckoo Man has to flap his arms almost constantly in order to keep aloft (the conclusion of every episode always shows him lagging behind the others as they fly off into the distance). Cuckoo Man changes into his costume by jumping up through the bottom of his store's cuckoo clock and popping out through the little door. While the other heroes' flying is accompanied by a \"jet\" sound effect similar to Mighty Mouse's, Cuckoo Man's is represented by a chugging jalopy-engine sound.\n\nDiaper Man is a red-headed, diapered, yet fully articulate baby, as well as the leader of the group, who sounds a lot like Popeye the Sailor Man. His main weapon is his bottle, which by holding on to the rubber nipple, he can swing around (or shoot like a slingshot) forcefully. The bottle can also shoot high pressure streams of baby formula. In emergencies, Diaper Man (and often Strong Man) will drink some formula from the bottle when extra strength is needed.\n\nEpisodes\n\nAlmost all of the 20 episodes were named after the enemies the Mighty Heroes encountered in each.\n\nNº Title Air date 1 \"The Plastic Blaster\" October 29, 1966 ( ) 2 \"The Frog\" November 5, 1966 ( ) 3 \"The Junker\" November 12, 1966 ( ) 4 \"The Shrinker\" November 19, 1966 ( ) 5 \"The Ghost Monster\" November 26, 1966 ( ) 6 \"The Stretcher\" December 3, 1966 ( ) 7 \"The Monsterizer\" December 10, 1966 ( ) 8 \"The Drifter\" December 17, 1966 ( ) 9 \"The Shocker\" December 24, 1966 ( ) 10 \"The Enlarger\" December 31, 1966 ( ) 11 \"The Toy Man\" January 7, 1967 ( ) 12 \"The Dusters\" January 14, 1967 ( ) 13 \"The Big Freeze\" January 21, 1967 ( ) 14 \"The Timekeeper\" January 28, 1967 ( ) 15 \"The Scarecrow\" February 4, 1967 ( ) 16 \"The Time Eraser\" February 11, 1967 ( ) 17 \"The Return of the Monsterizer\" February 18, 1967 ( ) 18 \"The Paper Monster\" February 25, 1967 ( ) 19 \"The Raven\" March 4, 1967 ( ) 20 \"The Bigger Digger\" March 11, 1967 ( )\n\nAlthough some sources list \"The Proton Pulsator\" as a 21st episode, this was actually an episode of The Astronut Show.\n\nThe series had no opening/closing titles of its own; each episode began with its own title."
