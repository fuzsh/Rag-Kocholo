        "text": "Media Release -- Dynamite Entertainment and CBS Consumer Products announced today a new license agreement for two classic properties from the rich history of television: the animated legend Mighty Mouse, and the hit 90's series Charmed!\n\nMighty Mouse returns to comics for the first time in 30 years, just in time for the character's 75th anniversary in 2017! Mighty Mouse was first conceived in 1942 as a parody of another cape and cowl hero introduced a few years earlier, and went on to star in countless animated films for the better part of the next 20 years, finding a new life on Saturday mornings in the 1960's.\n\n\"Mighty Mouse is as much a part of American pop culture as the two characters he is inspired by,\" says Nick Barrucci, Dynamite CEO and publisher. \"The original comics and animation entertained generations of fans, and with the popularity of superhero movies, there couldn't be a better time for his return! I am thrilled that Dynamite will be able to bring this timeless hero to a whole new generation of fans.\"\n\nCharmed premiered critical acclaim and commercial success, and by the end of its eight-season run, had won numerous awards and aired in more than 20 countries. Charmed follows the Halliwell sisters: three witches, each powerful in her own right, but invincible when they come together to summon The Power of Three. Protecting innocents from the underworld's demons, the Halliwell sisters battle evil from their family home in San Francisco.\n\n\"Charmed is a perfect fit for Dynamite for a number of reasons,\" says Dynamite CEO and publisher Nick Barrucci. \"We have had tremendous success with cult television properties, and the Halliwell sisters will be right at home. Our plans for these new series are sure to please comics readers and die-hard TV junkies alike!\"\n\nDetails on Dynamite's upcoming Mighty Mouse and Charmed publishing programs will be released in the coming months.\n\nAbout Dynamite Entertainment:\n\nDynamite was founded in 2004 and is home to several best-selling comic book titles and properties, including The Boys, The Shadow, Red Sonja, Warlord of Mars, Bionic Man, A Game of Thrones, and more. Dynamite owns and controls an extensive library with over 3,000 characters (which includes the Harris Comics and Chaos Comics properties), such as Vampirella, Pantha, Evil Ernie, Smiley the Psychotic Button, Chastity, and Peter Cannon: Thunderbolt. In addition to their critically-acclaimed titles and bestselling comics, Dynamite works with some of the most high profile creators in comics and entertainment, including Kevin Smith, Alex Ross, Neil Gaiman, Andy Diggle, John Cassaday, Garth Ennis, Jae Lee, Marc Guggenheim, Mike Carey, Jim Krueger, Greg Pak, Brett Matthews, Matt Wagner, Gail Simone, Steve Niles, James Robinson, and a host of up-and-coming new talent. Dynamite is consistently ranked in the upper tiers of comic book publishers and several of their titles - including Alex Ross and Jim Krueger's Project Superpowers - have debuted in the Top Ten lists produced by Diamond Comics Distributors. In 2005, Diamond awarded the company a GEM award for Best New Publisher and another GEM in 2006 for Comics Publisher of the Year (under 5%) and again in 2011. The company has also been nominated for and won several industry awards, including the prestigious Harvey and Eisner Awards."
