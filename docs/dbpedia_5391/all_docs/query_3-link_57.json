        "text": "Background\n\nKids Klassics was a children's division of GoodTimes Home Video. It was known for distributing some Hanna-Barbera videos and even some low-budget public domain cartoon tapes, among others. They also distributed several Children's Bible Stories videos.\n\nLogo (1985-1995)\n\nVisuals: Over a blue background is the corner of a gold theater-like sign with \"KIDS KLASSICS\", each word on either side of it, which shimmers with changing colors throughout. On some VHS releases, \"HOME VIDEO\" (in gold Korrina font text or white sans serif text) fades in under it. Sometimes, \"PRESENTS\" fades in below \"HOME VIDEO\".\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is a (sometimes shortened) variant where the text doesn't change colors.\n\nOn the Kids Sing Along series, the logo would disappear via a page-turning effect to reveal \"presents\" in a metallic font, which would turn away again to reveal the Kids Sing Along title card.\n\nLater versions have a blue gradient background (same background used for the GoodTimes \"rainbow\" logo) instead of a solid blue background; there is no \"TM\".\n\nOne variant has a different colored logo flying up from the bottom of the screen.\n\nThere may be a copyright date chyroned in and \"HOME VIDEO\" is in a bigger font size. It was used for the closing version.\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation. The logo was designed by Assael Associates in Florida.\n\nAudio: None, or a lush orchestrated fanfare.\n\nEarly Audio Variant: On the TV variant, an overly synthesized circus-like tune is heard. On the video variant, a kettle drum pound is heard along with a cymbal crash and then a 7-note triumphant fanfare.\n\nOther Audio Variants:\n\nThe Kids Sing Along variant uses a different synth fanfare. Later on, none\n\nOn the 1985 VHS release of Popeye Meets Sinbad The Sailor/Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves, a man chants \"Kids Klassics Presents!\"."
