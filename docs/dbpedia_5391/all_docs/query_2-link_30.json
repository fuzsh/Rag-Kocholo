        "text": "You know, that update was very good! I was just starting to wonder when the next update was gonna be.\n\nSomething tells me WB is probably gonna buy out UA instead of MGM when Heaven's Gate causes Transamerica to start considering selling UA ITTL. If UA's top executives still walk out to form Orion ITTL, maybe they'd want to merge back with UA if WB DOES buy out the latter.\n\nOoh, interesting\n\nWell, all the chips are there for that to happen, and Turner can keep all of MGM with the costs of UA no longer being required.\n\nExactly!\n\nWell, in that case, I may have to change my plans for CN... if it even exists\n\nOh man, whatcha got in store?\n\nI just hope your new plans are good.\n\nSame here!\n\nNew Series for the 1974-1975 season(timeline changes only):\n\nView attachment 784751 These Are the Days (from Hanna-Barbera, on ABC): Similar to the IOTL series, but an hour long and in primetime. This was part of a new attempt at a prime-time animation block, much like CBS's Toonsday and NBC's Wednesday-mation (the name of their Wednesday animation block), and called ABC's Toon Thursday. Much like IOTL, this was an attempt at making \"serious\" animation, as well as an attempt to cash in on CBS's wildly successful The Waltons through a historical family drama.\n\nOk. If they want serious mature animation, then I have plenty of ideas.\n\nView attachment 784750 Devlin (from Hanna-Barbera, on ABC): Much like as These Are the Days- similar to IOTL, hour long, primetime. This was another family drama, this time cashing in on Evel Knievel rather than The Waltons. Both this and These Are the Days are much more successful than IOTL. Other shows in Toon Thursday included Wait Till Your Father Gets Home, previously on Fridays as a companion piece to fellow Love, American Style spinoff Happy Days, and reruns of WB's The Road Runner Show, the latter of which to pad for time and due to Looney Tunes' newly revitalized adult popularity.\n\nOk, another family drama.\n\nTo fit the IOTL programs on the schedule, the Tuesday and Wednesday Movies of the Week were scrapped to make room for the remaining programs, such as the hit series The Odd Couple.\n\nABC TOON THURSDAY LINEUP FOR THE 1974 SEASON\n\n8 PM: The Road Runner Show(new to primetime!)\n\n8:30 PM: These Are the Days(new show!)\n\n9:30 PM: Devlin(new show!)\n\n10:30 PM: Wait Till Your Father Gets Home(new night!)\n\nThat's a good lineup, what's the other toon lineups looking like?\n\nLand of the Lost (from Lantz, Universal, and Sid and Marty Krofft, on NBC): ITTL, in addition to being produced by Lantz as well as the Krofft Brothers, it's animated instead of live action. This marks the Krofft Brothers' first full animated series, and a continuation of the Krofft-Lantz partnership after last year's successful Monster Mashup.\n\nSo, Lantz, Universal and The Krofft Brothers all team up on an animated series? This is nice.\n\nView attachment 784757 Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters (from Rankin-Bass, on ABC): Following the success of Monster Mashup on NBC from Universal, as well as General Mills' Monster Cereals (Count Chocula, Frankenberry, Boo Berry, and now Fruit Brute), Rankin-Bass revived an earlier TV movie of the same name, itself based on their stop-motion 1967 feature Mad Monster Party?, into a series. To differentiate from the story-based Groovie Goolies and the short-based Monster Mashup, this series was a sketch comedy, with a \"party\" similar to Mad Monster Party? as a sort of framing device. While initially more successful than Mashup, modern audiences have heard of and prefer Mashup more, though this series is still a cult hit.\n\nNice.\n\nView attachment 784755 Shazam! (from WB, on CBS, live-action): Aside from being produced by WB instead of Filmation, it's the same as the IOTL series. Shazam/Captain Marvel also appeared in animated form in Justice League over on NBC.\n\nOk.\n\nView attachment 784745 Moonlight Mask (from Knack Productions in Japan, licensed by WB stateside, in syndication as part of the Rising Sun block):\n\nCool except we've never heard of it.\n\nAfter three years with no changes and no new episodes, the popular Rising Sun lineup was starting to get stale.\n\n1: That's what happens when you rely on the same stuff over and over again.\n\n2: The block was ACTUALLY popular? On SUNDAY MORNINGS AT THAT?\n\nIn order to spice up the lineup, the decision was made to expand the block to four hours and add two new series.\n\nMy idea: Completely ditch the older stuff in favor of newer stuff, if you look hard enough, there's plenty of new stuff that could be imported throughout the rest of the decade.\n\nAfter noticing that the block had several non-conventional superheroes (Astro Boy, Gigantor, Phantom Knight of Princess Knight) but no traditional ones, the decision was made to include Moonlight Mask, a popular superhero from Japan in the more traditional vein.\n\nAwesome!\n\nIn addition, due to United Artists' new relationship with Warner via the Cartoon Group, the decision was also made to include another, even more popular Japanese superhero, this time going back to unconventionalism and live-action, with reruns of the giant tokusatsu hero Ultraman(United Artists had previously syndicated the series in 1966).\n\nBut this is better! May Ultraman gain much success in America.\n\nRISING SUN LINEUP FOR THE 1974 SEASON\n\n8 AM: Kimba the White Lion\n\n8:30 AM: Princess Knight\n\n9 AM: Astro Boy\n\n9:30 AM: Marine Boy\n\n10 AM: Moonlight Mask(new show!)\n\n10:30 AM: Speed Racer\n\n11 AM: Ultraman(live-action, new-ish show!)\n\n11:30 AM: Gigantor\n\nThat's alright for what it was, but by then, I'd probably only be watching for Moonlight Mask and Ultraman.\n\nAlso, due to DFE affiliating with the Warner Cartoon Group, the Planet of the Apes series switches studios to a Canadian studio, Nelvana. The international outsourcing is to cut costs, and this series is ITTL Nelvana's big break.\n\nOk. I can't wait to see how:\n\nThe double whammy of Planet Of The Apes and Star Wars will do for Nelvana!\n\nI see Ultraman and Gigantor and I am happy now. Please let Ultraman be a success here.\n\nSame here!\n\nIt's going to be a Rising Sun tradition from now on.\n\nSo more Ultraman series in the US. Perfect.\n\nYep! We got enough Ultraman series to get us through at least the 1981 season\n\nThat's perfect! I knew there a was reason I was intrigued by your ideas!\n\nAny thoughts on the other stuff?\n\nNot as far as I'm aware.\n\nAlright let's break this down!\n\nI know Moonlight Mask is obscure over here, but I found it while looking through old anime Univision aired (they also aired Princess Knight, which is why I focused on that specifically).\n\nWow! Univision aired that? I also heard they aired Lost Universe and Tenchi Muyo!\n\nThe other toon lineups are essentially unchanged.\n\nYes, it was popular, at least by syndication standards.\n\nOk.\n\nThey had been repeating episodes for a while, and it was getting stale, but back then shit loads of reruns of old cartoons were still popular- The Jetsons had been running for almost a decade at that point and only had a single season\n\nWow.....\n\nThat's surprising to learn!\n\nDid you see the Looney Tunes lineup?\n\nYes. It's great!\n\nGreat start for Nelvana! But hopefully Nelvana may revive the Terrytoons classic cartoon characters (Mighty Mouse, Heckle & Jeckle) for theatrical release in cooperation with Viacom International (owners of the Terrytoon properties) and 20th Century-Fox will act as a distributor.\n\nMost likely Filmation will do that, but that happening before 1994 is a cool idea, just as long as we get Tattertown in return:\n\nNelvana reviving the Terrytoons stable is better than Filmation doing that. Bar none and no doubt.\n\nOkay, but at the end of the day, it’s Viacom’s decision. Then again, they did distribute Cosmic Christmas in the states, so it could be possible…\n\nFair enough. Just putting my own opinion out there.\n\nRight, but we can get Terrytoons revivals AFTER Viacom buys Paramount!\n\nAnd the originals could always be reran on whatever their animation spin off network will be....\n\nYeah, but WB could also enter into a partnership (maybe feature film distrubution?) with Nelvana as well. WB got to distribute Nelvana's early specials on home video in the 80s:\n\nView attachment 784821View attachment 784822\n\nPlus, United Artists (whom might bought out by WB ITTL, now that I've given that idea out...), got to distribute Nelvana's first film Rock & Rule, although decisions made by UA's IOTL owners MGM caused Nelvana to edit the film to MGM's liking (replacing one of the main character's voices with Paul Le Mat was one of those MGM decisions...), and the film didn't even get marketing or a soundtrack, and only got a limited release until 1985. Maybe WB will treat Rock & Rule better?\n\nSpeaking of animation studios that got their first film screwed over by MGM in the 80s... Does Don Bluth still leave Disney ITTL? If so, then I might have a few ideas I could send through DMs...\n\nI’m still having Nelvana with Fox, film wise\n\nWell, that's a good idea, but I think @Tacomaster's idea of Fox with Nelvana is better, and I really like the concept of WB buying out UA outright and Turner remaining independent.\n\nShould I move Mad Mad Mad Monsters to primetime for next season?\n\nYeah.\n\nMaybe. Also The Road Runner Show was axed, although The Tom & Jerry Show would easily work for primetime as a replacement for Wait Til Your Father Gets Home. Among the shows CBS is axing in 1975 are My Favorite Martians, Gunsmoke and Mannix, and just substitute My Favorite Martians with The Road Runner Show.\n\nOk.\n\nPlan for the Rising Sun moving forward- the Ultraman series will be rotated out every year, and also every year, one of the other programs will be replaced by a newer program. Starting out with the six \"traditional\" series being replaced before Moonlight Mask or any of the initial replacements, and starting out with lesser known programs before going to more well known programs. Princess Knight, the newest of the traditional six and the only one to debut on the Rising Sun, will be the last. So basically, the order of replacement goes:\n\nMarine Boy, to be replaced in 1975\n\nGigantor, in 1976\n\nKimba the White Lion, in 1977\n\nSpeed Racer, in 1978\n\nAstro Boy, in 1979\n\nPrincess Knight, in 1980\n\nMoonlight Mask, in 1981\n\nSOME POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT SERIES for the 70s and early 80s - minimum barrier to entry is AT LEAST a year after Japanese airing\n\nFROM ASTRO BOY PRODUCERS (Tezuka Productions, after Mushi Productions, producers of Kimba, Princess Knight, and the original Astro Boy, shut down)\n\nAstro Boy 1980, in at least 1981 (but, well, duh)\n\nDon Dracula, in at least 1983\n\nFROM SPEED RACER PRODUCERS (Tatsunoko Productions)\n\nThe Genie Family, in at least 1975 (already made in 1972, with a remake in 2020; IOTL dubbed by Saban in 1992 as Bob in a Bottle)\n\nHoneybee Hutch, in at least 1975 (already made in 1970, with a sequel in 1984; IOTL dubbed by Saban in 1996)\n\nPinocchio: The Series, in at least 1975 (already made in 1972; IOTL dubbed by Saban and ran on HBO in 1992)\n\nGatchaman, in at least 1975 (already made in 1972, with sequels in 1978 and 1979; IOTL dubbed by Sandy Frank in 1978; you may know it as Battle of the Planets)\n\nSpace Knight Tekkaman, in at least 1976 (IOTL dubbed by Sandy Frank and ran on UPN in 1995 as Teknoman)\n\nTime Bokan, in at least 1976 (with sequels in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983)\n\nMacross, Southern Cross, and MOSPEADA, in at least 1983, 1985, and 1984, respectively (IOTL stitched together in 1985 by Harmony Gold as Robotech)\n\nFROM TELE-CARTOONS JAPAN (producers of Marine Boy and helped animate Johnny Cypher in Dimension Zero)\n\nSasuke, in at least 1975 (already made in 1968)\n\nGolden Bat, in at least 1975 (already made in 1957, also a popular Japanese superhero)\n\nFROM GIGANTOR PRODUCERS (Eiken, formerly Television Corporation of Japan)\n\nZoom the White Dolphin, in at least 1975 (already made in 1971, IOTL aired as a compilation movie on Nickelodeon as part of Special Delivery)\n\nUFO Warrior Diapolon, in at least 1977\n\nFROM ULTRAMAN PRODUCERS (Tsuburaya Productions, for tokusatsu rather than anime)\n\nMirrorman, in at least 1975 (already made in 1971)\n\nJumborg Ace, in at least 1975 (already made in 1973)\n\nMagmaman, in at least 1975 (already made in 1973)\n\nThe \"Dinosaur Trilogy\" - Born Free, Izenborg, and Koseidon, in 1977, 1978, and 1979, respectively (mix of animation and live-action)\n\nAztekizer, in at least 1976\n\nAnd of course, a TON of Ultraman series!\n\nUNIVISION INFANTALES (IOTL broadcaster of Princess Knight and Moonlight Mask)\n\nTime Bokan (again?)\n\nTreasure Island, in at least 1979\n\nThe Adventures of the Little Prince, in at least 1979 (IOTL ran on Nickelodeon from 1985-1989)\n\nNobody's Boy: Remi, in at least 1978\n\nFuture Boy Conal, in at least 1979\n\nBeast King GoLion and Armored Fleet Dairugger XV, in at least 1982 and 1983, respectively (IOTL stitched together by World Events Productions in 1984 as Voltron, which is how it aired on Univision)\n\nPlan for the Rising Sun moving forward- the Ultraman series will be rotated out every year, and also every year, one of the other programs will be replaced by a newer program.

Especially if Disney dubs the Tatsunoko Pinocchio anime.\n\nMOVIES and SPECIALS\n\nPretty much all the theatrical movies from IOTL release, at least the American ones.\n\nFritz the Cat still releases in 1972 with an X rating. It's not AS big of a mega hit ITTL due to adult animation being not as much of a novelty, but it is still very successful. The one-two punch of Fritz and TV adult animation results in more theatrical adult animation.\n\nAt the end of 1973, after rejection from Universal-Lantz, the Warner Cartoon Group, and Disney, George Lucas signs with 20th Century Fox and their new animation ally Nelvana for an animated science fiction feature to be called The Star Wars. While Lucas envisioned it as a live-action film, the decision was made to make it animated, in order to go farther with the sci-fi theming while costing less than visual effects.\n\nSnoopy, Come Home is a bigger success than ITTL, resulting in Peanuts feature films becoming a more common occurrence.\n\nUncle Sam Magoo airs on NBC in 1970, as one of UPA's last animated specials. UPA sells its cartoon library to Columbia, who then buys them overall to get back into the animation business (the UPA studio was closed down, but they still owned the rights to their characters such as Mr. Magoo and Gerald McBoing Boing; the new shorts were made by Rankin/Bass). This was shortly after UPA signed a deal with Toho to distribute some of their tokusatsu films, such as the popular Godzilla franchise. The resulting television syndication helps create a cult market for Japanese monster movies, which, along with the success of anime during this time and the controversy of the Japanese internment camps during the 1940s during World War II, sparks a Japanese-influenced counterculture.\n\nSuperstar Goofy releases in theaters in 1972, same as internationally, rather than 1976 IOTL. The success of this compilation film results in a generally Disney-focused compilation-documentary with a Mickey skew, It All Started With A Mouse, in 1973, to even greater success. In response, WB is set to release a Looney Tunes compilation, Bugs Bunny: Superstar, in 1975, as is Universal-Lantz with Guess Who? It's Woody Woodpecker!\n\nCharlotte's Web is animated by Filmation instead of Hanna-Barbera.\n\nABC and Universal's The Mini-Munsters is butterflied out, due to the existence of Universal's Monster Mashup.\n\nSanta and the Three Bears is released on TV by WB in 1970, as a companion piece to Christmas Story. It's also made in-house at WB, although Tony Benedict is still director.\n\n1973's Treasure Island and 1974's Oliver Twist, while still released by Warner Bros., are also produced by WB rather than Filmation, as part of a new series of Family Classics.\n\nThe first WB-produced special under the Cartoon Group, and not in-house at WB, is aired on The World of Warner Bros. on CBS- Chuck Jones' Bugs Bunny in King Arthur's Court. The special, while well-hyped and well-rated, was critically panned. It was derided as slow and boring, and the jokes weren't funny. It was also the first major sign that something had once again gone wrong at WB Animation, and his name was Chuck Jones- while the in-house and DFE shorts were decently funny and fast-paced, Jones' shorts were quite the opposite- and his constant credit-hogging didn't help matters. In following years, legitimate discussions were had on whether Chuck Jones' shorts and created series (specifically, the Road Runner and Pepe Le Pew, whose reputation would both bottom out during this time) were ever good in the first place! The aformentioned efforts of DFE and the in-house crew, luckily, kept the studio's reputation from tanking like in the 60s.\n\nSHORTS AND TV\n\nTerrytoons is still shut down in 1972 by Viacom; however, by 1974's end, following the successes of the Warner Cartoon Group's series, Hanna-Barbera's Tom and Jerry revival, and the retooling of Woody Woodpecker, Viacom decides to revive various Terrytoons characters such as Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, Farmer Al Falfa, Gandy Goose, Dinky Duck, Deputy Dawg, and Astronut. 20th Century Fox, once again, distributes the cartoons in theaters, with Nelvana providing the animation. However, Viacom keeps the copyright to the shorts and the television distribution rights.\n\nFollowing the success of Warner's Rising Sun, Rankin/Bass teams up with fellow Toei Animation and Topcraft, as well as fellow WCG-distributed anime producer TCJ/Eiken, to create their own anime block for the 1975 season.\n\nWait Till Your Father Gets Home shifts production from Hanna-Barbera to Filmation in 1973. With Fox shifting to Nelvana in 1974, this began a studio-animation allience system.\n\nWB has its in-house studio, as well as DFE and Chuck Jones. United Artists is also included in this deal.\n\nFox has Nelvana.\n\nMGM has Hanna-Barbera.\n\nColumbia has Rankin-Bass.\n\nParamount has Filmation.\n\nUniversal has Walter Lantz, as well as Sid and Marty Krofft Productions, the latter of which isn't strictly animation but includes animated and hybrid programs.\n\nDisney has their own in-house studio.\n\nThe Invisible Girl and Wolf Boy in Monster Mashup are only like that in the pilot; in the show proper, they're the Invisible Boy and the Wolf Girl.\n\nEmergency +4 is produced by Lantz instead of Fred Calvert. It still only lasts two seasons.\n\nBack in 1973, instead of Hanna-Barbera's Super Friends (which ITTL became WB's Justice League), Hanna-Barbera produces Marvin Man and Wonder Wendy, a comedy superhero series starring Wendy and Marvin from the IOTL Super Friends. They actually have superpowers in this version, but they're terrible at using them. It lasts only a single season.\n\nYes, Filmation's other Paramount series-based cartoons, such as The Brady Kids and its spinoff Mission: Magic are made here.\n\nThe New Adventures of Gilligan is produced by DFE, then later co-produced by WB Animation thanks to DFE and UA's new inclusion in the Warner Cartoon Group.\n\nAnime and adult animation have taken off, but what about adult puppetry?
