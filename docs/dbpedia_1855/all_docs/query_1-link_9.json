Five high-resolution C and X-band scenes were recorded in the Fram Strait covering fast first-year and old sea ice. In addition sea ice thickness, surface roughness and melt pond fraction were collected during a helicopter flight at the study area. From the SAR scenes, six polarimetric features were extracted. Along sections of the track of the helicopter flight, the mean of the SAR features were compared to mean values of the properties measured during the helicopter flight. The results reveal relations between several of the SAR features and the geophysical properties measured in C-band, and weak relations in X-band.\n\nInitial assessment of an airborne Ku-band polarimetric SAR.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRaynal, Ann Marie; Doerry, Armin Walter\n\n2013-02-01\n\nPolarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been used for a variety of dual-use research applications since the 1940s. By measuring the direction of the electric field vector from radar echoes, polarimetry may enhance an analysts understanding of scattering effects for both earth monitoring and tactical surveillance missions. Polarimetry may provide insight into surface types, materials, or orientations for natural and man-made targets. Polarimetric measurements may also be used to enhance the contrast between scattering surfaces such as man-made objects and their surroundings. This report represents an initial assessment of the utility of, and applications for, polarimetric SAR at Ku-band formoreÂ Â» airborne or unmanned aerial systems.Â«Â less\n\nRetrieval of the thickness of undeformed sea ice from C-band compact polarimetric SAR images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, X.; Dierking, W.; Zhang, J.; Meng, J. M.; Lang, H. T.\n\n2015-10-01\n\nIn this paper we introduce a parameter for the retrieval of the thickness of undeformed first-year sea ice that is specifically adapted to compact polarimetric SAR images. The parameter is denoted as \"CP-Ratio\". In model simulations we investigated the sensitivity of CP-Ratio to the dielectric constant, thickness, surface roughness, and incidence angle. From the results of the simulations we deduced optimal conditions for the thickness retrieval. On the basis of C-band CTLR SAR data, which were generated from Radarsat-2 quad-polarization images acquired jointly with helicopter-borne sea ice thickness measurements in the region of the Sea of Labrador, we tested empirical equations for thickness retrieval. An exponential fit between CP-Ratio and ice thickness provides the most reliable results. Based on a validation using other compact polarimetric SAR images from the same region we found a root mean square (rms) error of 8 cm and a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.92 for the retrieval procedure when applying it on level ice of 0.9 m mean thickness.\n\nRetrieval of the thickness of undeformed sea ice from simulated C-band compact polarimetric SAR images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Xi; Dierking, Wolfgang; Zhang, Jie; Meng, Junmin; Lang, Haitao\n\n2016-07-01\n\nIn this paper we introduce a parameter for the retrieval of the thickness of undeformed first-year sea ice that is specifically adapted to compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.

The aim of this paper is to classify multi-temporal full polarimetric SAR data using kernel-based fuzzy C-means clustering method, over an agricultural region. This method starts with transforming input data into the higher dimensional space using kernel functions and then clustering them in the feature space. Feature space, due to its inherent properties, has the ability to take in account the nonlinear and complex nature of polarimetric data. Several SAR polarimetric features extracted using target decomposition algorithms. Features from Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi algorithms used as inputs for the clustering. This method was applied to multi-temporal UAVSAR L-band images acquired over an agricultural area near Winnipeg, Canada, during June and July in 2012. The results demonstrate the efficiency of this approach with respect to the classical methods. In addition, using multi-temporal data in the clustering process helped to investigate the phenological cycle of plants and significantly improved the performance of agricultural land cover mapping.\n\nOil spill analysis by means of full polarimetric UAVSAR (L-band) and Radarsat-2 (C-band) products acquired during Deepwater Horizon Disaster\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLatini, Daniele; Del Frate, Fabio; Jones, Cathleen E.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nSAR instruments with polarimetric capabilities, high resolution and short revisit time can provide powerful support in oil spill monitoring and different techniques of analysis have been developed for this purpose [1][2]. An oil film on the sea surface results in darker areas in SAR images, but careful interpretation is required because dark spots can also be caused by natural phenomena. In view of the very low backscatter from slicks, the Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ) is a primary sensor parameter to be considered when using a sensor for slick analysis. Among the existing full polarimetric sensors, the high resolution and very low NESZ values of UAVSAR (L-band) and RADARSAT-2 (C-band) make them preferable for oil spill analysis compared to the last generation SAR instruments. The Deepwater Horizon disaster that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 represents a unique and extensive test site where large amounts of SAR imagery and ground validation data are available. By applying the Cloude-Pottier decomposition method to full polarimetric UAVSAR (L-band) and RADARSAT-2 (C-band), it is possible to extract parameters that describe the scattering mechanism of the target. By comparing quasi-simultaneous acquisitions and exploiting the different penetration capabilities of the sensors, we investigate the potential of full polarimetric SAR to discriminate oil on the sea surface from look-alike phenomena covering the full range of backscattering values down to those at the instrument noise floor.\n\nInvestigation of the Capability of Compact Polarimetric SAR Interferometry to Estimate Forest Height\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Hong; Xie, Lei; Wang, Chao; Chen, Jiehong\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe main objective of this paper is to investigate the capability of compact Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (C-PolInSAR) on forest height estimation. For this, the pseudo fully polarimetric interferomteric (F-PolInSAR) covariance matrix is firstly reconstructed, then the three- stage inversion algorithm, hybrid algorithm, Music and Capon algorithm are applied to both C-PolInSAR covariance matrix and pseudo F-PolInSAR covariance matrix. The availability of forest height estimation is demonstrated using L-band data generated by simulator PolSARProSim and X-band airborne data acquired by East China Research Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation.\n\nAgricultural Land Cover from Multitemporal C-Band SAR Data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSkriver, H.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nHenning Skriver DTU Space, Technical University of Denmark Ãrsteds Plads, Building 348, DK-2800 Lyngby e-mail: hs@space.dtu.dk Problem description This paper focuses on land cover type from SAR data using high revisit acquisitions, including single and dual polarisation and fully polarimetric data, at C-band. The data set were acquired during an ESA-supported campaign, AgriSAR09, with the Radarsat-2 system. Ground surveys to obtain detailed land cover maps were performed during the campaign. Classification methods using single- and dual-polarisation data, and fully polarimetric data are used with multitemporal data with short revisit time. Results for airborne campaigns have previously been reported in Skriver et al. (2011) and Skriver (2012). In this paper, the short revisit satellite SAR data will be used to assess the trade-off between polarimetric SAR data and data as single or dual polarisation SAR data. This is particularly important in relation to the future GMES Sentinel-1 SAR satellites, where two satellites with a relatively wide swath will ensure a short revisit time globally. Questions dealt with are: which accuracy can we expect from a mission like the Sentinel-1, what is the improvement of using polarimetric SAR compared to single or dual polarisation SAR, and what is the optimum number of acquisitions needed. Methodology The data have sufficient number of looks for the Gaussian assumption to be valid for the backscatter coefficients for the individual polarizations. The classification method used for these data is therefore the standard Bayesian classification method for multivariate Gaussian statistics. For the full-polarimetric cases two classification methods have been applied, the standard ML Wishart classifier, and a method based on a reversible transform of the covariance matrix into backscatter intensities. The following pre-processing steps were performed on both data sets: The scattering matrix data in the form of SLC products were\n\nValidation of Forested Inundation Extent Revealed by L-Band Polarimetric and Interferometric SAR Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChapman, Bruce; Celi, Jorge; Hamilton, Steve; McDonald, Kyle\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUAVSAR, NASA's airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), conducted an extended observational campaign in Central and South America in March 2013, primarily related to volcanic deformations along the Andean Mountain Range but also including a large number of flights studying other scientific phenomena. During this campaign, the L-Band SAR collected data over the Napo River in Ecuador. The objectives of this experiment were to acquire polarimetric and interferometric L-Band SAR data over an inundated tropical forest in Ecuador simultaneously with on-the-ground field work ascertaining the extent of inundation, and to then derive from this data a quantitative estimate for the error in the SAR-derived inundation extent. In this paper, we will first describe the processing and preliminary analysis of the SAR data. The polarimetric SAR data will be classified by land cover and inundation state. The interferometric SAR data will be used to identify those areas where change in inundation extent occurred, and to measure the change in water level between two observations separated by a week. Second, we will describe the collection of the field estimates of inundation, and have preliminary comparisons of inundation extent measured in the field field versus that estimated from the SAR data.\n\nPolSAR-Ap: Exploitation of Fully Polarimetric SAR Data for Sea Oil Slick Monitoring\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMigliaccio, M.; Nunziata, F.\n\n2013-08-01\n\nIn this study, some of the most up-to-dated polarimetric approaches for sea oil slick observation are reviewed and their performance is discussed using actual C-band RadarSAT-2 SAR data where both oil slicks, related to the Deepwater Horizon accident, and oil seeps are present.Results demonstrate the unique benefits of polarimetric SAR data in: a) characterizing the scattering mechanism of sea surface with and without surfactants; b) providing information on the damping properties of the surfactant.\n\nOffshore platform sourced pollution monitoring using space-borne fully polarimetric C and X band synthetic aperture radar.\n\nPubMed\n\nSingha, Suman; Ressel, Rudolf\n\n2016-11-15\n\nUse of polarimetric SAR data for offshore pollution monitoring is relatively new and shows great potential for operational offshore platform monitoring. This paper describes the development of an automated oil spill detection chain for operational purposes based on C-band (RADARSAT-2) and X-band (TerraSAR-X) fully polarimetric images, wherein we use polarimetric features to characterize oil spills and look-alikes. Numbers of near coincident TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 images have been acquired over offshore platforms. Ten polarimetric feature parameters were extracted from different types of oil and 'look-alike' spots and divided into training and validation dataset. Extracted features were then used to develop a pixel based Artificial Neural Network classifier. Mutual information contents among extracted features were assessed and feature parameters were ranked according to their ability to discriminate between oil spill and look-alike spots. Polarimetric features such as Scattering Diversity, Surface Scattering Fraction and Span proved to be most suitable for operational services. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These data can be acquired without the limitations of weather conditions, sun illumination and dust particles. As result, SAR images, and in particular Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) are powerful tools for various environmental applications. Unlike the optical images, SAR images suffer from the unavoidable speckle, which causes the segmentation of this data difficult. In this paper, we use the wavelet transformation for segmentation of PolSAR images. Our proposed method is based on the multi-resolution analysis of texture features is based on wavelet transformation. Here, we use the information of gray level value and the information of texture. First, we produce coherency or covariance matrices and then generate span image from them. In the next step of proposed method is texture feature extraction from sub-bands is generated from discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Finally, PolSAR image are segmented using clustering methods as fuzzy c-means (FCM) and k-means clustering. We have applied the proposed methodology to full polarimetric SAR images acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) L-band system, during July, in 2012 over an agricultural area in Winnipeg, Canada.\n\nRice growth monitoring using simulated compact polarimetric C band SAR\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Zhi; Li, Kun; Liu, Long; Shao, Yun; Brisco, Brian; Li, Weiguo\n\n2014-12-01\n\nIn this study, a set of nine compact polarimetric (CP) images were simulated from polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data acquired over a test site containing two types of rice field in Jiangsu province, China. The types of rice field in the test site were (1) transplanted hybrid rice fields, and (2) direct-sown japonica rice fields. Both types have different yields and phenological stages. As a first step, the two types of rice field were distinguished with 94% and 86% accuracy respectively through analyzing CP synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations and their behavior in terms of scattering mechanisms during the rice growth season. The focus was then on phenology retrieval for each type of rice field. A decision tree (DT) algorithm was built to fulfill the precise retrieval of rice phenological stages, in which seven phenological stages were discriminated. The key criterion for each phenological stage was composed of 1-4 CP parameters, some of which were first used for rice phenology retrieval and found to be very sensitive to rice phenological changes. The retrieval results were verified at parcel level for a set of 12 stands of rice and up to nine observation dates per stand. This gave an accuracy of 88-95%. Throughout the phenology retrieval process, only simulated CP data were used, without any auxiliary data. These results demonstrate the potential of CP SAR for rice growth monitoring applications.\n\nSpace-borne polarimetric SAR sensors or the golden age of radar polarimetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPottier, E.\n\n2010-06-01\n\nSAR Polarimetry represents an active area of research in Active Earth Remote Sensing. This interest is clearly supported by the fact that nowadays there exists, or there will exist in a very next future, a non negligible quantity of launched Polarimetric SAR Spaceborne sensors. The ENVISAT satellite, developed by ESA, was launched on March 2002, and was the first Spaceborne sensor offering an innovative dualpolarization Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) system operating at C-band. The second Polarimetric Spaceborne sensor is ALOS, a Japanese Earth-Observation satellite, developed by JAXA and was launched in January 2006. This mission includes an active L-band polarimetric radar sensor (PALSAR) whose highresolution data may be used for environmental and hazard monitoring. The third Polarimetric Spaceborne sensor is TerraSAR-X, a new German radar satellite, developed by DLR, EADS-Astrium and Infoterra GmbH, was launched on June 2007. This sensor carries a dual-polarimetric and high frequency X-Band SAR sensor that can be operated in different modes and offers features that were not available from space before. At least, the Polarimetric Spaceborne sensor, developed by CSA and MDA, and named RADARSAT-2 was launched in December 2007 The Radarsat program was born out the need for effective monitoring of Canadaâs icy waters, and some Radarsat-2 capabilities that benefit sea- and river ice applications are the multi-polarization options that will improve ice-edge detection, ice-type discrimination and structure information. The many advances in these different Polarimetric Spaceborne platforms were developed to respond to specific needs for radar data in environmental monitoring applications around the world, like : sea- and river-ice monitoring, marine surveillance, disaster management, oil spill detection, snow monitoring, hydrology, mapping, geology, agriculture, soil characterisation, forestry applications (biomass, allometry, heightâ¦), urban mapping etcâ\n\nPolarimetric SAR Models for Oil Fields Monitoring in China Seas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBuono, A.; Nunziata, F.; Li, X.; Wei, Y.; Ding, X.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIn this study, physical-based models for polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) oil fields monitoring are proposed. They all share a physical rationale relying on the different scattering mechanisms that characterize a free sea surface, an oil slick-covered sea surface, and a metallic target. In fact, sea surface scattering is well modeled by a Bragg-like behaviour, while a strong departure from Bragg scattering is in place when dealing with oil slicks and targets. Furthermore, the proposed polarimetric models aim at addressing simultaneously target and oil slick detection, providing useful extra information with respect to single-pol SAR data in order to approach oil discrimination and classification. Experiments undertaken over East and South China Sea from actual C-band RadarSAT-2 full-pol SAR data witness the soundness of the proposed rationale.\n\nPolarimetric SAR Models for Oil Fields Monitoring in China Seas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBuono, A.; Nunziata, F.; Li, X.; Wei, Y.; Ding, X.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIn this study, physical-based models for polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) oil fields monitoring are proposed.

Clint; Crawford, Melba M.; Gibeaut, James C.; Gutierrez, Roberto O.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA three-year project to study small-scale topographic changes and relict geomorphic features on barrier islands using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is described. A study area on the Texas coast consisting of Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula was overflown by the NASA/JPL DC 8 AIRSAR in April 1995. Data was acquired in the fully polarimetric mode using C-, L-, and P-bands and in the TOPSAR configuration with C- and L-bands in interferometric mode. The study area will be overflown again in late spring 1996. The data will be registered to global positioning system (GPS) surveyed points to form high resolution digital elevation models (DEM) and then analyzed to investigate possible topographic changes.\n\nProcessing of polarimetric SAR data for soil moisture estimation over Mahantango watershed area\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRao, K. S.; Teng, W. L.; Wang, J. R.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nMicrowave remote sensing technique has a high potential for measuring soil moisture due to the large contrast in dielectric constant of dry and wet soils. Recent work by Pults et al. demonstrated the use of X/C-band data for quantitative surface soil moisture extraction from Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system. Similar technique was adopted using polarimetric SAR data acquired with the JPL-AIRSAR system over the Mahantango watershed area in central Pennsylvania during July 1990. The data sets reported include C-, L-, and P-bands of 10, 13, 15, and 17 July 1990.\n\nPolarimetric C-/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar Observations of Melting Sea Ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCasey, J. A.; Beckers, J. F.; Brossier, E.; Haas, C.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nOperational ice information services rely heavily on space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for the production of ice charts to meet their mandate of providing timely and accurate sea ice information to support safe and efficient marine operations. During the summer melt period, the usefulness of SAR data for sea ice monitoring is limited by the presence of wet snow and melt ponds on the ice surface, which can mask the signature of the underlying ice. This is a critical concern for ice services whose clients (e.g. commercial shipping, cruise tourism, resource exploration and extraction) are most active at this time of year when sea ice is at its minimum extent, concentration and thickness. As a result, there is a need to further quantify the loss of ice information in SAR data during the melt season and to identify what information can still be retrieved about ice surface conditions and melt pond evolution at this time of year. To date the majority of studies have been limited to analysis of single-polarization C-band SAR data. This study will investigate the potential complimentary and unique sea ice information that polarimetric C- and X-band SAR data can provide to supplement the information available from traditional single co-polarized C-band SAR data. A time-series of polarimetric C- and X-band SAR data was acquired over Jones Sound in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, in the vicinity of the Grise Fiord, Nunavut. Five RADARSAT-2 Wide Fine Quad-pol images and 11 TerraSAR-X StripMap dual-pol (HH/VV) images were acquired. The time-series begins at the onset of melt in early June and extends through advanced melt conditions in late July. Over this period several ponding and drainage events and two snowfall events occurred. Field observations of sea ice properties were collected using an Ice Mass Balance (IMB) buoy, hourly photos from a time-lapse camera deployed on a coastal cliff, and manual in situ measurements of snow thickness and melt pond depth\n\nThe Ecosystems SAR (EcoSAR) an Airborne P-band Polarimetric InSAR for the Measurement of Vegetation Structure, Biomass and Permafrost\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRincon, Rafael F.; Fatoyinbo, Temilola; Ranson, K.

Scatterometer observations identify two dominant backscatter sources from the ice cover: the snow-ice, and ice-water interface. Using in-situ measurements as ground-truth, a winter time series of scatterometer and satellite acquisitions show increases in backscatter from the ice-water interface prior to the timing of tubular bubble development in the ice cover. This timing indicates that scattering in the ice is independent of double-bounce scatter caused by tubular bubble inclusions. Concurrently, the co-polarized phase difference of interactions at the ice-water interface from both scatterometer and SAR observations are centred at 0Â° throughout the time series, indicating a scattering regime other than double bounce. A Yamaguchi three-component decomposition of SAR observations is presented for C-band acquisitions indicating a dominant single-bounce scattering mechanism regime, which is hypothesized to be a result of an ice-water interface that presents a rough surface or a surface composed of preferentially oriented facets. This study is the first to present a winter time series of coincident ground-based and spaceborne fully polarimetric active microwave observations for bubbled freshwater lake ice.\n\nDiscrimination of Oil Slicks and Lookalikes in Polarimetric SAR Images Using CNN.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Hao; Wu, Danni; An, Jubai\n\n2017-08-09\n\nOil slicks and lookalikes (e.g., plant oil and oil emulsion) all appear as dark areas in polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and are highly heterogeneous, so it is very difficult to use a single feature that can allow classification of dark objects in polarimetric SAR images as oil slicks or lookalikes. We established multi-feature fusion to support the discrimination of oil slicks and lookalikes. In the paper, simple discrimination analysis is used to rationalize a preferred features subset. The features analyzed include entropy, alpha, and Single-bounce Eigenvalue Relative Difference (SERD) in the C-band polarimetric mode. We also propose a novel SAR image discrimination method for oil slicks and lookalikes based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The regions of interest are selected as the training and testing samples for CNN on the three kinds of polarimetric feature images. The proposed method is applied to a training data set of 5400 samples, including 1800 crude oil, 1800 plant oil, and 1800 oil emulsion samples. In the end, the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through the analysis of some experimental results. The classification accuracy obtained using 900 samples of test data is 91.33%. It is here observed that the proposed method not only can accurately identify the dark spots on SAR images but also verify the ability of the proposed algorithm to classify unstructured features.\n\nDiscrimination of Oil Slicks and Lookalikes in Polarimetric SAR Images Using CNN\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAn, Jubai\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOil slicks and lookalikes (e.g., plant oil and oil emulsion) all appear as dark areas in polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and are highly heterogeneous, so it is very difficult to use a single feature that can allow classification of dark objects in polarimetric SAR images as oil slicks or lookalikes.

Five high-resolution satellite SAR scenes were recorded in the Fram Strait covering iceberg-fast first-year and old sea ice during a week with air temperatures varying around 0 Â°C. Sea ice thickness, surface roughness and aerial photographs were collected during a helicopter flight at the site. Six polarimetric SAR features were extracted for each of the scenes. The ability of the individual SAR features to discriminate between sea ice types and their temporal consistency were examined. All SAR features were found to add value to sea ice type discrimination. Relative kurtosis, geometric brightness, cross-polarisation ratio and co-polarisation correlation angle were found to be temporally consistent in the investigated period, while co-polarisation ratio and co-polarisation correlation magnitude were found to be temporally inconsistent. An automatic feature-based segmentation algorithm was tested both for a full SAR feature set and for a reduced SAR feature set limited to temporally consistent features. In C band, the algorithm produced a good late-summer sea ice segmentation, separating the scenes into segments that could be associated with different sea ice types in the next step. The X-band performance was slightly poorer. Excluding temporally inconsistent SAR features improved the segmentation in one of the X-band scenes.\n\nForest Structure Characterization Using JPL's UAVSAR Multi-Baseline Polarimetric SAR Interferometry and Tomography\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNeumann, Maxim; Hensley, Scott; Lavalle, Marco; Ahmed, Razi\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper concerns forest remote sensing using JPL's multi-baseline polarimetric interferometric UAVSAR data.

M.; Brozena, J. M.; Liang, R.; Ball, D.; Holt, B.; Thomson, J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAs one component of the Office of Naval Research supported Sea State Departmental Research Initiative during October of 2015 the Naval Research Laboratory flew an ultrawide-band, low-frequency, polarimetric SAR over the southward advancing sea ice in Beaufort Sea. The flights were coordinated with the research team aboard the R/V Sikuliaq working near and in the advancing pack ice. The majority of the SAR data were collected with the L-Band sensor (1000-1500 MHz) from an altitude of 10,000', providing a useful swath 6 km wide with 75o and 25 o angles of incidence at the inner and outer edge of the swath respectively. Some data were also collected with the P-Band SAR (215-915 MHz). The extremely large bandwidths allowed for formation of image pixels as small as 30 cm, however, we selected 60 cm pixel size to reduce image speckle. The separate polarimetric images are calibrated to one pixel to allow for calculations such as polarimetric decompositions that require the images to be well aligned. Both frequencies are useful particularly for the detection of ridges and areas of deformed ice. There are advantages and disadvantages to airborne SAR imagery compared to satellites. The chief advantages being the enormous allowable bandwidth leading to very fine range resolution, and the ability to fly arbitrary trajectories on demand. The latter permits specific areas to be imaged at a given time with a specified illumination direction. An area can even be illuminated from all directions by flying a circular trajectory around the target area. This captures ice features that are sensitive to illumination direction such as cracks, sastrugi orientation, and ridges. The disadvantages include variation of intensity across the swath with range and incidence angle. In addition to the SAR data, we collected photogrammetric imagery from a DSS-439, scanning lidar from a Riegl Q560 and surface brightness temperatures from a KT-19. However, since all of these sensors are nadir pointing\n\nA Quality Assessment Method Based on Common Distributed Targets for GF-3 Polarimetric SAR Data.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Sha; Qiu, Xiaolan; Han, Bing; Hu, Wenlong\n\n2018-03-07\n\nThe GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite, launched on 10 August 2016, is the first C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) satellite in China. The PolSAR system of GF-3 can collect a significant wealth of information for geophysical research and applications. Being used for related applications, GF-3 PolSAR images must be of good quality. It is necessary to evaluate the quality of polarimetric data and achieve the normalized quality monitoring during 8-year designed life of GF-3. In this study, a new quality assessment method of PolSAR data based on common distributed targets is proposed, and the performance of the method is analyzed by simulations and GF-3 experiments. We evaluate the quality of GF-3 PolSAR data by this method. Results suggest that GF-3 antenna is highly isolated, and the quality of calibrated data satisfies the requests of quantitative applications.\n\nMAX-91: Polarimetric SAR results on Montespertoli site\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBaronti, S.; Luciani, S.; Moretti, S.; Paloscia, S.; Schiavon, G.; Sigismondi, S.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a powerful sensor for high resolution ocean and land mapping and particularly for monitoring hydrological parameters in large watersheds. There is currently much research in progress to assess the SAR operational capability as well as to estimate the accuracy achievable in the measurements of geophysical parameters with the presently available airborne and spaceborne sensors. An important goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the basic mechanisms that control the interaction of electro-magnetic waves with soil and vegetation. This can be done both by developing electromagnetic models and by analyzing statistical relations between backscattering and ground truth data. A systematic investigation, which aims at a better understanding of the information obtainable from the multi-frequency polarimetric SAR to be used in agro-hydrology, is in progress by our groups within the framework of SIR-C/X-SAR Project and has achieved a most significant milestone with the NASA/JPL Aircraft Campaign named MAC-91. Indeed this experiment allowed us to collect a large and meaningful data set including multi-temporal multi-frequency polarimetric SAR measurements and ground truth. This paper presents some significant results obtained over an agricultural flat area within the Montespertoli site, where intensive ground measurements were carried out. The results are critically discussed with special regard to the information associated with polarimetric data.\n\nAssessment of Full and Compact Polarimetric SAR Observations for Land-Cover and Crop Classification\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNafari, Nima Fallah; Homayouni, Saeid; Safari, Abdolreza; Akbari, Vahid\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe recently developed compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data tend to confer a valuable source of information -comparable to full polarimetric (FP) data- in many applications. However, this assertion still needs confirmation in practice. This paper evaluates the potential of FP and CP data in land- cover and crop classification and determines the prospects of CP data in such applications. To this end, two data sets including full polarimetric L-band data from UAVSAR, acquired over an agricultural area in Winnipeg (Canada), and full polarimetric C-band data acquired by RADARSAT-2 over San Francisco are used. CP data are simulated from the FP data of the both datasets and classified by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Based on the results, CP system with a simpler design compared to FP system still has the potential to be used as an alternative when a larger swath width is required.\n\nThe use of multifrequency and polarimetric SIR-C/X-SAR data in geologic studies of Bir Safsaf, Egypt\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSchaber, G.G.; McCauley, J.F.; Breed, C.S.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nBir Safsaf, within the hyperarid 'core' of the Sahara in the Western Desert of Egypt, was recognized following the SIR-A and SIR-B missions in the 1980s as one of the key localities in northeast Africa, where penetration of dry sand by radar signals delineates previously unknown, sand-buried paleodrainage valleys ('radar-rivers') of middle Tertiary to Quaternary age. The Bir Safsaf area was targeted as a focal point for further research in sand penetration and geologic mapping using the multifrequency and polarimetric SIR-C/X-SAR sensors. Analysis of the SIR-C/X-SAR data from Bir Safsaf provides important new information on the roles of multiple SAR frequency and polarimetry in portraying specific types of geologic units, materials, and structures mostly hidden from view on the ground and on Landsat TM images by a relatively thin, but extensive blanket of blow sand. Basement rock units (granitoids and gneisses) and the fractures associated with them at Bir Safsaf are shown here for the first time to be clearly delineated using C- and L-band SAR images. The detectability of most geologic features is dependent primarily on radar frequency, as shown for wind erosion patterns in bedrock at X-band (3 cm wavelength), and for geologic units and sand and clay-filled fractures in weathered crystal-line basement rocks at C-band (6 cm) and L-band (24 cm). By contrast, Quaternary paleodrainage channels are detectable at all three radar frequencies owing, among other things, to an usually thin cover of blow sand. The SIR-C/X-SAR data investigated to date enable us to make specific recommendations about the utility of certain radar sensor configurations for geologic and paleoenvironmental reconnaissance in desert regions.Analysis of the shuttle imaging radar-C/X-synthetic aperture radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) data from Bir Safsaf provides important new information on the roles of multiple SAR frequency and polarimetry in portraying specific types of geologic units, materials, and\n\nSegmentation Of Polarimetric SAR Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRignot, Eric J.

S.; Vandenbroek, A. C.\n\n1992-03-01\n\nIn August 1989, a single day measurement campaign was conducted with two airborne imaging radars, the Dutch X band Side Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) and the P/L/C band polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Test sites were the Flevopolder and the Veluwe (agricultural and forested areas, respectively) in the Netherlands. Ground activities included the deployment of several calibration devices like different sized trihedrals, dihedrals, and PARC's (active calibrators). An extensive experiment description is presented. Relevant details of the two radar systems and the calibration devices used are given. The calibration of the SLAR and SAR data is described. The calibrated data is used to investigate its potential for the classification of agricultural crop types. Several quantities are extracted from the data, which are used to do this. Examples are the copolarization phase difference distribution, the degree of polarization, and copolarized signatures. It appears to be quite possible to discriminate bare soil fields from vegetated fields using polarimetric quantities like the HH/VV (Horizontal Horizontal/Vertical Vertical) phase difference distribution and the degree of polarization. However, discrimination between fields with different crop types is much more difficult probably due to interference of features not related to the crop type, such as soil moisture, soil roughness, lodging, etc.\n\nA particle swarm optimized kernel-based clustering method for crop mapping from multi-temporal polarimetric L-band SAR observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTamiminia, Haifa; Homayouni, Saeid; McNairn, Heather; Safari, Abdoreza\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPolarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data, thanks to their specific characteristics such as high resolution, weather and daylight independence, have become a valuable source of information for environment monitoring and management. The discrimination capability of observations acquired by these sensors can be used for land cover classification and mapping. The aim of this paper is to propose an optimized kernel-based C-means clustering algorithm for agriculture crop mapping from multi-temporal PolSAR data. Firstly, several polarimetric features are extracted from preprocessed data. These features are linear polarization intensities, and several statistical and physical based decompositions such as Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi techniques. Then, the kernelized version of hard and fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms are applied to these polarimetric features in order to identify crop types. The kernel function, unlike the conventional partitioning clustering algorithms, simplifies the non-spherical and non-linearly patterns of data structure, to be clustered easily. In addition, in order to enhance the results, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to tune the kernel parameters, cluster centers and to optimize features selection. The efficiency of this method was evaluated by using multi-temporal UAVSAR L-band images acquired over an agricultural area near Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, during June and July in 2012. The results demonstrate more accurate crop maps using the proposed method when compared to the classical approaches, (e.g. 12% improvement in general). In addition, when the optimization technique is used, greater improvement is observed in crop classification, e.g. 5% in overall. Furthermore, a strong relationship between Freeman-Durden volume scattering component, which is related to canopy structure, and phenological growth stages is observed.\n\nPolarimetric SAR calibration experiment using active radar calibrators\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFreeman, Anthony; Shen, Yuhsyen; Werner, Charles L.\n\n1990-03-01\n\nActive radar calibrators are used to derive both the amplitude and phase characteristics of a multichannel polarimetric SAR from the complex image data.

H.; Gerland, Sebastian\n\n2017-03-01\n\nIn this paper we investigate the potential of melt pond fraction retrieval from X-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on drifting first-year sea ice. Melt pond fractions retrieved from a helicopter-borne camera system were compared to polarimetric features extracted from four dual-polarimetric X-band SAR scenes, revealing significant relationships. The correlations were strongly dependent on wind speed and SAR incidence angle. Co-polarisation ratio was found to be the most promising SAR feature for melt pond fraction estimation at intermediate wind speeds (6. 2 m s-1), with a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0. 46. At low wind speeds (0. 6 m s-1), this relation disappeared due to low backscatter from the melt ponds, and backscatter VV-polarisation intensity had the strongest relationship to melt pond fraction with a correlation coefficient of -0. 53. To further investigate these relations, regression fits were made both for the intermediate (R2fit = 0. 21) and low (R2fit = 0. 26) wind case, and the fits were tested on the satellite scenes in the study. The regression fits gave good estimates of mean melt pond fraction for the full satellite scenes, with less than 4 % from a similar statistics derived from analysis of low-altitude imagery captured during helicopter ice-survey flights in the study area. A smoothing window of 51 Ã 51 pixels gave the best reproduction of the width of the melt pond fraction distribution. A considerable part of the backscatter signal was below the noise floor at SAR incidence angles above Ë 40Â°, restricting the information gain from polarimetric features above this threshold. Compared to previous studies in C-band, limitations concerning wind speed and noise floor set stricter constraints on melt pond fraction retrieval in X-band. Despite this, our findings suggest new possibilities in melt pond fraction estimation from X-band SAR, opening for expanded monitoring of melt ponds during melt season in the future.\n\nCalibration of a polarimetric imaging SAR\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSarabandi, K.; Pierce, L. E.; Ulaby, F. T.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nCalibration of polarimetric imaging Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR's) using point calibration targets is discussed. The four-port network calibration technique is used to describe the radar error model. The polarimetric ambiguity function of the SAR is then found using a single point target, namely a trihedral corner reflector. Based on this, an estimate for the backscattering coefficient of the terrain is found by a deconvolution process. A radar image taken by the JPL Airborne SAR (AIRSAR) is used for verification of the deconvolution calibration method. The calibrated responses of point targets in the image are compared both with theory and the POLCAL technique. Also, response of a distributed target are compared using the deconvolution and POLCAL techniques.\n\nPolarimetric SAR Interferometry to Monitor Land Subsidence in Tehran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSadeghi, Zahra; Valadan Zoej, Mohammad Javad; Muller, Jan-Peter\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThis letter uses a combination of ADInSAR with a coherence optimization method. Polarimetric DInSAR is able to enhance pixel phase quality and thus coherent pixel density. The coherence optimization method is a search-based approach to find the optimized scattering mechanism introduced by Navarro-Sanchez [1]. The case study is southwest of Tehran basin located in the North of Iran. It suffers from a high-rate of land subsidence and is covered by agricultural fields. Usually such an area would significantly decorrelate but applying polarimetric ADInSAR it is possible to obtain a more coherent pixel coverage. A set of dual-pol TerraSAR-X images was ordered for polarimetric ADInSAR procedure. The coherence optimization method is shown to have increased the density and phase quality of coherent pixels significantly.\n\nClassification Comparisons Between Compact Polarimetric and Quad-Pol SAR Imagery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSouissi, Boularbah; Doulgeris, Anthony P.; Eltoft, TorbjÃ¸rn\n\n2015-04-01\n\nRecent interest in dual-pol SAR systems has lead to a novel approach, the so-called compact polarimetric imaging mode (CP) which attempts to reconstruct fully polarimetric information based on a few simple assumptions. In this work, the CP image is simulated from the full quad-pol (QP) image. We present here the initial comparison of polarimetric information content between QP and CP imaging modes. The analysis of multi-look polarimetric covariance matrix data uses an automated statistical clustering method based upon the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for finite mixture modeling, using the complex Wishart probability density function. Our results showed that there are some different characteristics between the QP and CP modes. The classification is demonstrated using a E-SAR and Radarsat2 polarimetric SAR images acquired over DLR Oberpfaffenhofen in Germany and Algiers in Algeria respectively.\n\nExtracting DEM from airborne X-band data based on PolInSAR\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHou, X. X.; Huang, G. M.; Zhao, Z.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nPolarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) is a new trend of SAR remote sensing technology which combined polarized multichannel information and Interferometric information. It is of great significance for extracting DEM in some regions with low precision of DEM such as vegetation coverage area and building concentrated area. In this paper we describe our experiments with high-resolution X-band full Polarimetric SAR data acquired by a dual-baseline interferometric airborne SAR system over an area of Danling in southern China. Pauli algorithm is used to generate the double polarimetric interferometry data, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Numerical Radius (NR) and Phase diversity (PD) methods are used to generate the full polarimetric interferometry data. Then we can make use of the polarimetric interferometric information to extract DEM with processing of pre filtering , image registration, image resampling, coherence optimization, multilook processing, flat-earth removal, interferogram filtering, phase unwrapping, parameter calibration, height derivation and geo-coding. The processing system named SARPlore has been exploited based on VC++ led by Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping. Finally compared optimization results with the single polarimetric interferometry, it has been observed that optimization ways can reduce the interferometric noise and the phase unwrapping residuals, and improve the precision of DEM. The result of full polarimetric interferometry is better than double polarimetric interferometry. Meanwhile, in different terrain, the result of full polarimetric interferometry will have a different degree of increase.\n\nLate summer sea ice segmentation with multi-polarisation SAR features in C- and X-band\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFors, A. S.; Brekke, C.; Doulgeris, A. P.; Eltoft, T.; Renner, A. H. H.; Gerland, S.\n\n2015-09-01\n\nIn this study we investigate the potential of sea ice segmentation by C- and X-band multi-polarisation synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features during late summer. Five high-resolution satellite SAR scenes were recorded in the Fram Strait covering iceberg-fast first-year and old sea ice during a week with air temperatures varying around zero degrees Celsius. In situ data consisting of sea ice thickness, surface roughness and aerial photographs were collected during a helicopter flight at the site. Six polarimetric SAR features were extracted for each of the scenes. The ability of the individual SAR features to discriminate between sea ice types and their temporally consistency were examined. All SAR features were found to add value to sea ice type discrimination. Relative kurtosis, geometric brightness, cross-polarisation ratio and co-polarisation correlation angle were found to be temporally consistent in the investigated period, while co-polarisation ratio and co-polarisation correlation magnitude were found to be temporally inconsistent. An automatic feature-based segmentation algorithm was tested both for a full SAR feature set, and for a reduced SAR feature set limited to temporally consistent features. In general, the algorithm produces a good late summer sea ice segmentation. Excluding temporally inconsistent SAR features improved the segmentation at air temperatures above zero degrees Celcius.\n\nValidation of Distributed Soil Moisture: Airborne Polarimetric SAR vs. Ground-based Sensor Networks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJagdhuber, T.; Kohling, M.; Hajnsek, I.; Montzka, C.; Papathanassiou, K. P.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe knowledge of spatially distributed soil moisture is highly desirable for an enhanced hydrological modeling in terms of flood prevention and for yield optimization in combination with precision farming. Especially in mid-latitudes, the growing agricultural vegetation results in an increasing soil coverage along the crop cycle. For a remote sensing approach, this vegetation influence has to be separated from the soil contribution within the resolution cell to extract the actual soil moisture. Therefore a hybrid decomposition was developed for estimation of soil moisture under vegetation cover using fully polarimetric SAR data. The novel polarimetric decomposition combines a model-based decomposition, separating the volume component from the ground components, with an eigen-based decomposition of the two ground components into a surface and a dihedral scattering contribution. Hence, this hybrid decomposition, which is based on [1,2], establishes an innovative way to retrieve soil moisture under vegetation. The developed inversion algorithm for soil moisture under vegetation cover is applied on fully polarimetric data of the TERENO campaign, conducted in May and June 2011 for the Rur catchment within the Eifel/Lower Rhine Valley Observatory. The fully polarimetric SAR data were acquired in high spatial resolution (range: 1.92m, azimuth: 0.6m) by DLR's novel F-SAR sensor at L-band. The inverted soil moisture product from the airborne SAR data is validated with corresponding distributed ground measurements for a quality assessment of the developed algorithm. The in situ measurements were obtained on the one hand by mobile FDR probes from agricultural fields near the towns of Merzenhausen and Selhausen incorporating different crop types and on the other hand by distributed wireless sensor networks (SoilNet clusters) from a grassland test site (near the town of Rollesbroich) and from a forest stand (within the WÃ¼stebach sub-catchment). Each SoilNet cluster\n\nCanopy Height and Vertical Structure from Multibaseline Polarimetric InSAR: First Results of the 2016 NASA/ESA AfriSAR Campaign\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLavalle, M.; Hensley, S.; Lou, Y.; Saatchi, S. S.; Pinto, N.; Simard, M.; Fatoyinbo, T. E.; Duncanson, L.; Dubayah, R.; Hofton, M. A.; Blair, J. B.; Armston, J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn this paper we explore the derivation of canopy height and vertical structure from polarimetric-interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) data collected during the 2016 AfriSAR campaign in Gabon. AfriSAR is a joint effort between NASA and ESA to acquire multi-baseline L- and P-band radar data, lidar data and field data over tropical forests and savannah sites to support calibration, validation and algorithm development in preparation for the NISAR, GEDI and BIOMASS missions. Here we focus on the L-band UAVSAR dataset acquired over the Lope National Park in Central Gabon to demonstrate mapping of canopy height and vertical structure using PolInSAR and tomographic techniques. The Lope site features a natural gradient of forest biomass from the forest-savanna boundary (< 100 Mg/ha) to dense undisturbed humid tropical forests (> 400 Mg/ha). Our dataset includes 9 long-baseline, full-polarimetric UAVSAR acquisitions along with field and lidar data from the Laser Vegetation Ice Sensor (LVIS). We first present a brief theoretical background of the PolInSAR and tomographic techniques. We then show the results of our PolInSAR algorithms to create maps of canopy height generated via inversion of the random-volume-over-ground (RVOG) and random-motion-over-ground (RVoG) models. In our approach multiple interferometric baselines are merged incoherently to maximize the interferometric sensitivity over a broad range of tree heights. Finally we show how traditional tomographic algorithms are used for the retrieval of the full vertical canopy profile. We compare our results from the different PolInSAR/tomographic algorithms to validation data derived from lidar and field data.\n\nAdvanced Unsupervised Classification Methods to Detect Anomalies on Earthen Levees Using Polarimetric SAR Imagery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMarapareddy, Ramakalavathi; Aanstoos, James V.; Younan, Nicolas H.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFully polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (polSAR) data analysis has wide applications for terrain and ground cover classification. The dynamics of surface and subsurface water events can lead to slope instability resulting in slough slides on earthen levees. Early detection of these anomalies by a remote sensing approach could save time versus direct assessment. We used L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to screen levees for anomalies. SAR technology, due to its high spatial resolution and soil penetration capability, is a good choice for identifying problematic areas on earthen levees. Using the parameters entropy (H), anisotropy (A), alpha (Î±), and eigenvalues (Î», Î»1, Î»2, and Î»3), we implemented several unsupervised classification algorithms for the identification of anomalies on the levee. The classification techniques applied are H/Î±, H/A, A/Î±, Wishart H/Î±, Wishart H/A/Î±, and H/Î±/Î» classification algorithms. In this work, the effectiveness of the algorithms was demonstrated using quad-polarimetric L-band SAR imagery from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratoryâs (JPLâs) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR). The study area is a section of the lower Mississippi River valley in the Southern USA, where earthen flood control levees are maintained by the US Army Corps of Engineers.

Our model is supposed to learn powerful and informative representations to improve the generalization ability for the complex scene classification tasks. Given the influence of speckle noise in Polarimetric SAR image, wavelet polarization decomposition is applied first to obtain basic and discriminative texture features which are then embedded into a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in order to compose multi-layer higher representations. We demonstrate that the model can produce a powerful representation which can capture some untraceable information from Polarimetric SAR images and show a promising achievement in comparison with other traditional SAR image classification methods for the SAR image dataset.\n\nC-band polarimetric scatterometer for soil studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nD'Alessio, Angelo C.; Mongelli, Antonio; Notarnicola, Claudia; Paparella, Giuseppina; Posa, Francesco; Sabatelli, Vincenzo\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the performances of a polarimetric scatterometer. This sensor can measure the module of the electromagnetic backscattering matrix elements. The knowledge of this matrix permits the computation of all the possible polarisation combinations of transmitted and received signals through a Polarisation Synthesis approach. Scatterometer data are useful for monitoring a large number of soil physical parameters. In particular, the sensitivity of a C-band radar to different growing conditions of vegetation depends on the wave polarisation. As consequences, the possibility of acquiringi both polarisation components presents a great advantage in the vegetarian studies. In addition, this type of ground sensor can permit a fast coverage of the areas of interest. A first test of the polarimetric scatterometer has been performed over an asphalt surface, which has a well-known electromagnetic response. Moreover, a calibration procedure has been tested using both passive (Trihedral Corner Reflector, TCR) and active (Active Radar Calibrator, ARC) radar calibrator.\n\nChange detection in a time series of polarimetric SAR data by an omnibus test statistic and its factorization (Conference Presentation)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNielsen, Allan A.; Conradsen, Knut; Skriver, Henning\n\n2016-10-01\n\n., Skriver, H., Nielsen, A.

Forest structure retrievals require the measurement related to the vertical dimension, for which several techniques have been developed over the years. These techniques use polarimetric and interferometric aspects of the SAR data, which can be collected using EcoSAR. In this paper we describe EcoSAR system in light of its interferometric capabilities and investigate forest structure retrieval techniques.\n\nTropical forest tree stands characterization with L-band polarimetric radar\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWu, Shih-Tseng\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe effectiveness of using L-band polarimetric data to determine tropical tree-stand parameters is discussed with specific attention given to the correction of the radar data. Tree-parameter data from ground studies is compared to L-band polarimetric data (in both uncorrected and topographically corrected forms) for two test areas. The test sites are at two different elevations but both include 81 test plots with topographic data and tree-characteristic data given. Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data are found to be related to bole volume and tree volume, and the topographically corrected data show results similar to the uncorrected data. Similar r-values are given for both data sets because the data with incidence-angle values below 35 and above 55 are removed. Topographical correction is important when local incidence angles exceed the limits.\n\nEvaluating suitability of Pol-SAR (TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-2) for automated sea ice classification\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRessel, Rudolf; Singha, Suman; Lehner, Susanne\n\n2016-05-01\n\nSatellite borne SAR imagery has become an invaluable tool in the field of sea ice monitoring. Previously, single polarimetric imagery were employed in supervised and unsupervised classification schemes for sea ice investigation, which was preceded by image processing techniques such as segmentation and textural features. Recently, through the advent of polarimetric SAR sensors, investigation of polarimetric features in sea ice has attracted increased attention. While dual-polarimetric data has already been investigated in a number of works, full-polarimetric data has so far not been a major scientific focus. To explore the possibilities of full-polarimetric data and compare the differences in C- and X-bands, we endeavor to analyze in detail an array of datasets, simultaneously acquired, in C-band (RADARSAT-2) and X-band (TerraSAR-X) over ice infested areas. First, we propose an array of polarimetric features (Pauli and lexicographic based). Ancillary data from national ice services, SMOS data and expert judgement were utilized to identify the governing ice regimes. Based on these observations, we then extracted mentioned features. The subsequent supervised classification approach was based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). To gain quantitative insight into the quality of the features themselves (and reduce a possible impact of the Hughes phenomenon), we employed mutual information to unearth the relevance and redundancy of features. The results of this information theoretic analysis guided a pruning process regarding the optimal subset of features. In the last step we compared the classified results of all sensors and images, stated respective accuracies and discussed output discrepancies in the cases of simultaneous acquisitions.\n\nOn the Retrieval of Phenological Stages of Agricultural Crops by Means of C-Band Polarimetric SAR Data in Barrax, Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMascolo, Lucio; Lopez-Sanchez, Juan M.; Vicente-Guijalba, Fernando; Nunziata, Ferdinando; Migliaccio, Maurizio; Mazzarela, Giuseppe\n\n2015-04-01\n\nPolarimetric observables derived from RADARSAT-2 fine quad-pol data collected over the Barrax region, Spain, during the AgriSAR 2009 fields campaign, are exploited to estimate the phenological stages of agricultural crops, in particular of oat fields.The estimation is carried out by means of a supervised classification procedure applied both at the parcel and pixel level. Comparison with available ground truth results in high estimation accuracies.\n\nEstimation of Bridge Height over Water from Polarimetric SAR Image Data Using Mapping and Projection Algorithm and De-Orientation Theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Haipeng; Xu, Feng; Jin, Ya-Qiu; Ouchi, Kazuo\n\nAn inversion method of bridge height over water by polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is developed. A geometric ray description to illustrate scattering mechanism of a bridge over water surface is identified by polarimetric image analysis. Using the mapping and projecting algorithm, a polarimetric SAR image of a bridge model is first simulated and shows that scattering from a bridge over water can be identified by three strip lines corresponding to single-, double-, and triple-order scattering, respectively. A set of polarimetric parameters based on the de-orientation theory is applied to analysis of three types scattering, and the thinning-clustering algorithm and Hough transform are then employed to locate the image positions of these strip lines. These lines are used to invert the bridge height. Fully polarimetric image data of airborne Pi-SAR at X-band are applied to inversion of the height and width of the Naruto Bridge in Japan. Based on the same principle, this approach is also applicable to spaceborne ALOSPALSAR single-polarization data of the Eastern Ocean Bridge in China. The results show good feasibility to realize the bridge height inversion.\n\nA novel framework for change detection in bi-temporal polarimetric SAR images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPirrone, Davide; Bovolo, Francesca; Bruzzone, Lorenzo\n\n2016-10-01\n\nLast years have seen relevant increase of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data availability, thanks to satellite sensors like Sentinel-1 or ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The augmented information lying in the additional polarimetric channels represents a possibility for better discriminate different classes of changes in change detection (CD) applications. This work aims at proposing a framework for CD in multi-temporal multi-polarization SAR data. The framework includes both a tool for an effective visual representation of the change information and a method for extracting the multiple-change information. Both components are designed to effectively handle the multi-dimensionality of polarimetric data. In the novel representation, multi-temporal intensity SAR data are employed to compute a polarimetric log-ratio. The multitemporal information of the polarimetric log-ratio image is represented in a multi-dimensional features space, where changes are highlighted in terms of magnitude and direction. This representation is employed to design a novel unsupervised multi-class CD approach. This approach considers a sequential two-step analysis of the magnitude and the direction information for separating non-changed and changed samples. The proposed approach has been validated on a pair of Sentinel-1 data acquired before and after the flood in Tamil-Nadu in 2015. Preliminary results demonstrate that the representation tool is effective and that the use of polarimetric SAR data is promising in multi-class change detection applications.\n\nC- and L-band space-borne SAR incidence angle normalization for efficient Arctic sea ice monitoring\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahmud, M. S.; Geldsetzer, T.; Howell, S.; Yackel, J.; Nandan, V.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nC-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used effectively for operational sea ice monitoring, owing to its greater seperability between snow-covered first-year (FYI) and multi-year (MYI) ice types, during winter. However, during the melt season, C-band SAR backscatter contrast reduces between FYI and MYI. To overcome the limitations of C-band, several studies have recommended utlizing L-band SAR, as it has the potential to significantly improve sea ice classification. Given its longer wavelength, L-band can efficiently separate FYI and MYI types, especially during melt season. Therefore, the combination of C- and L-band SAR is an optimal solution for efficient seasonal sea ice monitoring. As SAR acquires images over a range of incidence angles from near-range to far-range, SAR backscatter varies substantially. To compensate this variation in SAR backscatter, incidence angle dependency of C- and L-band SAR backscatter for different FYI and MYI types is crucial to quantify, which is the objective of this study. Time-series SAR imagery from C-band RADARSAT-2 and L-band ALOS PALSAR during winter months of 2010 across 60 sites over the Canadian Arctic was acquired. Utilizing 15 images for each sites during February-March for both C- and L-band SAR, incidence angle dependency was calculated. Our study reveals that L- and C-band backscatter from FYI and MYI decreases with increasing incidence angle. The mean incidence angle dependency for FYI and MYI were estimated to be -0.21 dB/1Â° and -0.30 dB/1Â° respectively from L-band SAR, and -0.22 dB/1Â° and -0.16 dB/1Â° from C-band SAR, respectively. While the incidence angle dependency for FYI was found to be similar in both frequencies, it doubled in case of MYI from L-band, compared to C-band. After applying the incidence angle normalization method to both C- and L-band SAR images, preliminary results indicate improved sea ice type seperability between FYI and MYI types, with substantially lower number of mixed\n\nIntegrating polarimetric synthetic aperture radar and imaging spectrometry for wildland fuel mapping in southern California\n\nTreesearch\n\nP.E.

Such evidences have been studied by means of aerial photographs and of historical II World War acquisitions first, and of very high spatial resolution of optical satellites later. This work aims to exploit the technique of SAR Polarimetry for the detection of surface and subsurface archaeological structures, comparing ALOS P ALSAR L-band (central frequency 1.27 GHz), with RADARSAT-2 C-band sensor (central frequency 5.405 GHz). The great potential of the two polarimetric sensors with different frequency for the detection of archaeological remains has been demonstrated thanks to the sand penetration capability of both C-band and L- band sensors. The choice to analyze radar sensors is based on their 24-hour observations, independent from Sun illumination and meteorological conditions and on the electromagnetic properties of the target they could provide, information not derivable from optical images.\n\nPolarimetric SAR Interferometry based modeling for tree height and aboveground biomass retrieval in a tropical deciduous forest\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKumar, Shashi; Khati, Unmesh G.; Chandola, Shreya; Agrawal, Shefali; Kushwaha, Satya P. S.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe regulation of the carbon cycle is a critical ecosystem service provided by forests globally. It is, therefore, necessary to have robust techniques for speedy assessment of forest biophysical parameters at the landscape level. It is arduous and time taking to monitor the status of vast forest landscapes using traditional field methods. Remote sensing and GIS techniques are efficient tools that can monitor the health of forests regularly. Biomass estimation is a key parameter in the assessment of forest health. Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) remote sensing has already shown its potential for forest biophysical parameter retrieval. The current research work focuses on the retrieval of forest biophysical parameters of tropical deciduous forest, using fully polarimetric spaceborne C-band data with Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) techniques. PolSAR based Interferometric Water Cloud Model (IWCM) has been used to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB). Input parameters to the IWCM have been extracted from the decomposition modeling of SAR data as well as PolInSAR coherence estimation. The technique of forest tree height retrieval utilized PolInSAR coherence based modeling approach. Two techniques - Coherence Amplitude Inversion (CAI) and Three Stage Inversion (TSI) - for forest height estimation are discussed, compared and validated. These techniques allow estimation of forest stand height and true ground topography. The accuracy of the forest height estimated is assessed using ground-based measurements. PolInSAR based forest height models showed enervation in the identification of forest vegetation and as a result height values were obtained in river channels and plain areas. Overestimation in forest height was also noticed at several patches of the forest. To overcome this problem, coherence and backscatter based threshold technique is introduced for forest area identification and accurate height estimation in non-forested regions. IWCM based modeling for forest\n\nLarge Scale Assessment of Radio Frequency Interference Signatures in L-band SAR Data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeyer, F. J.; Nicoll, J.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nImagery of L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems such as the PALSAR sensor on board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) has proven to be a valuable tool for observing environmental changes around the globe. Besides offering 24/7 operability, the L-band frequency provides improved interferometric coherence, and L-band polarimetric data has shown great potential for vegetation monitoring, sea ice classification, and the observation of glaciers and ice sheets. To maximize the benefit of missions such as ALOS PALSAR for environmental monitoring, data consistency and calibration are vital. Unfortunately, radio frequency interference (RFI) signatures from ground-based radar systems regularly impair L-band SAR data quality and consistency. With this study we present a large-scale analysis of typical RFI signatures that are regularly observed in L-band SAR data over the Americas. Through a study of the vast archive of L-band SAR data in the US Government Research Consortium (USGRC) data pool at the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) we were able to address the following research goals: 1. Assessment of RFI Signatures in L-band SAR data and their Effects on SAR Data Quality: An analysis of time-frequency properties of RFI signatures in L-band SAR data of the USGRC data pool is presented. It is shown that RFI-filtering algorithms implemented in the operational ALOS PALSAR processor are not sufficient to remove all RFI-related artifacts. In examples, the deleterious effects of RFI on SAR image quality, polarimetric signature, SAR phase, and interferometric coherence are presented. 2. Large-Scale Assessment of Severity, Spatial Distribution, and Temporal Variation of RFI Signatures in L-band SAR data: L-band SAR data in the USGRC data pool were screened for RFI using a custom algorithm. Per SAR frame, the algorithm creates geocoded frame bounding boxes that are color-coded according to RFI intensity and converted to KML files for analysis in Google Earth.

H.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nEnormous scientific and technical developments have been carried out to further improve the remote sensing for decades, particularly Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar(PolSAR) technique, so classification method based on PolSAR images has getted much more attention from scholars and related department around the world. The multilook polarmetric G0-Wishart model is a more flexible model which describe homogeneous, heterogeneous and extremely heterogeneous regions in the image. Moreover, the polarmetric G0-Wishart distribution dose not include the modified Bessel function of the second kind. It is a kind of simple statistical distribution model with less parameter. To prove its feasibility, a process of classification has been tested with the full-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image by the method. First, apply multilook polarimetric SAR data process and speckle filter to reduce speckle influence for classification result. Initially classify the image into sixteen classes by H/A/Î± decomposition. Using the ICM algorithm to classify feature based on the G0-Wshart distance. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed method can classify polaimetric SAR data effectively and efficiently.\n\nEstimation of the Above Ground Biomass of Tropical Forests using Polarimetric and Tomographic SAR Data Acquired at P Band and 3-D Imaging Techniques\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFerro-Famil, L.; El Hajj Chehade, B.; Ho Tong Minh, D.; Tebaldini, S.; LE Toan, T.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nDeveloping and improving methods to monitor forest biomass in space and time is a timely challenge, especially for tropical forests, for which SAR imaging at larger wavelength presents an interesting potential. Nevertheless, directly estimating tropical forest biomass from classical 2-D SAR images may reveal a very complex and ill-conditioned problem, since a SAR echo is composed of numerous contributions, whose features and importance depend on many geophysical parameters, such has ground humidity, roughness, topographyâ¦ that are not related to biomass. Recent studies showed that SAR modes of diversity, i.e. polarimetric intensity ratios or interferometric phase centers, do not fully resolve this under-determined problem, whereas Pol-InSAR tree height estimates may be related to biomass through allometric relationships, with, in general over tropical forests, significant levels of uncertainty and lack of robustness. In this context, 3-D imaging using SAR tomography represents an appealing solution at larger wavelengths, for which wave penetration properties ensures a high quality mapping of a tropical forest reflectivity in the vertical direction. This paper presents a series of studies led, in the frame of the preparation of the next ESA mission BIOMASS, on the estimation of biomass over a tropical forest in French Guiana, using Polarimetric SAR Tomographic (Pol-TomSAR) data acquired at P band by ONERA. It is then shown that Pol-TomoSAR significantly improves the retrieval of forest above ground biomass (AGB) in a high biomass forest (200 up to 500 t/ha), with an error of only 10% at 1.5-ha resolution using a reflectivity estimates sampled at a predetermined elevation. The robustness of this technique is tested by applying the same approach over another site, and results show a similar relationship between AGB and tomographic reflectivity over both sites. The excellent ability of Pol-TomSAR to retrieve both canopy top heights and ground topography with an error\n\nPolarimetric Interferometry - Remote Sensing Applications\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThis lecture is mainly based on the work of S.R.

Newfoundland is among the richest Canadian province in terms of different wetland classes. Herbaceous wetlands cover extensive areas of the Avalon Peninsula, which are the habitat of a number of animal and plant species. In this study, a novel hierarchical object-based Random Forest (RF) classification approach is proposed for discriminating between different wetland classes in a sub-region located in the north eastern portion of the Avalon Peninsula. Particularly, multi-polarization and multi-frequency SAR data, including X-band TerraSAR-X single polarized (HH), L-band ALOS-2 dual polarized (HH/HV), and C-band RADARSAT-2 fully polarized images, were applied in different classification levels. First, a SAR backscatter analysis of different land cover types was performed by training data and used in Level-I classification to separate water from non-water classes. This was followed by Level-II classification, wherein the water class was further divided into shallow- and deep-water classes, and the non-water class was partitioned into herbaceous and non-herbaceous classes. In Level-III classification, the herbaceous class was further divided into bog, fen, and marsh classes, while the non-herbaceous class was subsequently partitioned into urban, upland, and swamp classes. In Level-II and -III classifications, different polarimetric decomposition approaches, including Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi decompositions, and Kennaugh matrix elements were extracted to aid the RF classifier. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were determined in each classification level for evaluating the classification results. The importance of input features was also determined using the variable importance obtained by RF. It was found that the Kennaugh matrix elements, Yamaguchi, and Freeman-Durden decompositions were the most important parameters\n\nAgricultural crop harvest progress monitoring by fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar imagery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Hao; Zhao, Chunjiang; Yang, Guijun; Li, Zengyuan; Chen, Erxue; Yuan, Lin; Yang, Xiaodong; Xu, Xingang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDynamic mapping and monitoring of crop harvest on a large spatial scale will provide critical information for the formulation of optimal harvesting strategies. This study evaluates the feasibility of C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) for monitoring the harvesting progress of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields. Five multitemporal, quad-pol Radarsat-2 images and one optical ZY-1 02C image were acquired over a farmland area in China during the 2013 growing season. Typical polarimetric signatures were obtained relying on polarimetric decomposition methods. Temporal evolutions of these signatures of harvested fields were compared with the ones of unharvested fields in the context of the entire growing cycle. Significant sensitivity was observed between the specific polarimetric parameters and the harvest status of oilseed rape fields. Based on this sensitivity, a new method that integrates two polarimetric features was devised to detect the harvest status of oilseed rape fields using a single image. The validation results are encouraging even for the harvested fields covered with high residues. This research demonstrates the capability of PolSAR remote sensing in crop harvest monitoring, which is a step toward more complex applications of PolSAR data in precision agriculture.\n\nShips and Maritime Targets Observation Campaigns Using Available C- and X-Band SAR Satellite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVelotto, Domenico; Bentes, Carlos; Lehner, Susanne\n\n2015-04-01\n\nObviously, radar resolution and swath width are two very important factors when it comes to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) maritime targets detections. The dilemma of using single polarization SAR imagery with higher resolution and coverage or quad- (or dual- polarimetric) imagery with its richness of information, is still unsolved when it comes to this application.In the framework of ESA project MARISS and EU project DOLPHIN, in situ campaigns aimed at solving this dilemma have been carried out. Single and multi- polarimetric SAR data acquired by TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed have been acquired with close time gaps and partial coverage overlap. In this way several moving and non-moving maritime targets have been imaged with different polarization, geometry and working frequency. Available ground truth reports provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, nautical chart and wind farm location are used to validate the different types of maritime targets.\n\nAn L-band SAR for repeat pass deformation measurements on a UAV platform\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWheeler, Kevin; Hensley, Scott; Lou, Yunling\n\n2004-01-01\n\nWe are proposing to develop a miniaturized polarimetric L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for repeatpass differential interferometric measurements of deformation for rapidly deforming surfaces of geophysical interest such as volcanoes or earthquakes that is to be flown on a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or minimally piloted vehicle (MPV).\n\nSpeckle Filtering of GF-3 Polarimetric SAR Data with Joint Restriction Principle.\n\nPubMed\n\nXie, Jinwei; Li, Zhenfang; Zhou, Chaowei; Fang, Yuyuan; Zhang, Qingjun\n\n2018-05-12\n\nPolarimetric SAR (PolSAR) scattering characteristics of imagery are always obtained from the second order moments estimation of multi-polarization data, that is, the estimation of covariance or coherency matrices. Due to the extra-paths that signal reflected from separate scatterers within the resolution cell has to travel, speckle noise always exists in SAR images and has a severe impact on the scattering performance, especially on single look complex images. In order to achieve high accuracy in estimating covariance or coherency matrices, three aspects are taken into consideration: (1) the edges and texture of the scene are distinct after speckle filtering; (2) the statistical characteristic should be similar to the object pixel; and (3) the polarimetric scattering signature should be preserved, in addition to speckle reduction. In this paper, a joint restriction principle is proposed to meet the requirement. Three different restriction principles are introduced to the processing of speckle filtering. First, a new template, which is more suitable for the point or line targets, is designed to ensure the morphological consistency. Then, the extent sigma filter is used to restrict the pixels in the template aforementioned to have an identical statistic characteristic. At last, a polarimetric similarity factor is applied to the same pixels above, to guarantee the similar polarimetric features amongst the optional pixels. This processing procedure is named as speckle filtering with joint restriction principle and the approach is applied to GF-3 polarimetric SAR data acquired in San Francisco, CA, USA. Its effectiveness of keeping the image sharpness and preserving the scattering mechanism as well as speckle reduction is validated by the comparison with boxcar filters and refined Lee filter.\n\nPolarimetric and Structural Properties of a Boreal Forest at P-Band and L-Band\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTebaldini, S.; Rocca, F.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nWith this paper we investigate the structural and polarimetric of the boreal forest within the Krycklan river catchment, Northern Sweden, basing on multi-polarimetric and multi-baseline SAR surveys at P-Band and L-Band collected in the framework of the ESA campaign BioSAR 2008. The analysis has been carried out by applying the Algebraic Synthesis (AS) technique, recently introduced in literature, which provides a theoretical framework for the decomposition of the backscattered signal into ground-only and volume-only contributions, basing on both baseline and polarization diversity. The availability of multiple baselines allows the formation of a synthetic aperture not only along the azimuth direction but also in elevation. Accordingly, the backscattered echoes can be focused not only in the slant range, azimuth plane, but in the whole 3D space. This is the rationale of the SAR Tomography (T-SAR) concept, which has been widely considered in the literature of the last years. It follows that, as long as the penetration in the scattering volume is guaranteed, the vertical profile of the vegetation layer is retrieved by separating backscatter contributions along the vertical direction, which is the main reason for the exploitation of Tomographic techniques at longer wavelengths. Still, the capabilities of T-SAR are limited to imaging the global vertical structure of the electromagnetic scattering in a certain polarization. It then becomes important to develop methodologies for the investigation of the vertical structure of different Scattering Mechanisms (SMs), such as ground and volume scattering, in such a way as to derive information that can be delivered also outside the field of Radar processing. This is an issue that may become relevant at longer wavelengths, such as P-Band, where the presence of multiple scattering arising from the interaction with terrain could hinder the correct reconstruction of the forest structure. The availability of multiple polarizations\n\nComparing the Behavior of Polarimetric SAR Imagery (TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2) for Automated Sea Ice Classification\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRessel, Rudolf; Singha, Suman; Lehner, Susanne\n\n2016-08-01\n\nArctic Sea ice monitoring has attracted increasing attention over the last few decades. Besides the scientific interest in sea ice, the operational aspect of ice charting is becoming more important due to growing navigational possibilities in an increasingly ice free Arctic. For this purpose, satellite borne SAR imagery has become an invaluable tool. In past, mostly single polarimetric datasets were investigated with supervised or unsupervised classification schemes for sea ice investigation. Despite proven sea ice classification achievements on single polarimetric data, a fully automatic, general purpose classifier for single-pol data has not been established due to large variation of sea ice manifestations and incidence angle impact. Recently, through the advent of polarimetric SAR sensors, polarimetric features have moved into the focus of ice classification research. The higher information content four polarimetric channels promises to offer greater insight into sea ice scattering mechanism and overcome some of the shortcomings of single- polarimetric classifiers. Two spatially and temporally coincident pairs of fully polarimetric acquisitions from the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X and RADARSAT-2 satellites are investigated. Proposed supervised classification algorithm consists of two steps: The first step comprises a feature extraction, the results of which are ingested into"
