In the 2010-2011 Academic Year, we hosted 51 conferences, meetings and symposia. Center faculty and visiting faculty offer courses on Islam and the history of Muslim-Christian relations for undergraduate and graduate students. In the 2010-2011 Academic Year, ACMCU offered 20 courses comprised of 310 students, and advised or mentored 47 independent studies and theses. In addition, Center faculty members serve as consultants to government leaders, diplomats, policymakers, corporate executives, and members of the media."
