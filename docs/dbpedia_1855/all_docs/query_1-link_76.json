        "text": "In this paper, we try to explain the use of knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising firms by applying the knowledge-based view of the firm that integrates results from the information richness theory. Starting from the information richness theory we argue that the degree of tacitness of system-specific knowledge determines the information richness of the knowledge transfer mechanisms of franchising firms. We examine the following hypotheses: (1) the franchisor uses more knowledge transfer mechanisms with a lower degree of information richness (such as email, intra- and internet), if the tacitness of system-specific knowledge is low, and (2) the franchisor uses more knowledge transfer mechanisms with a higher degree of information richness (such as training, seminar, meetings, visits), if the tacitness of system-specific knowledge is high. We test these hypotheses by using data from 83 franchising firms in the Austrian franchise sector. The data provide partial support for the hypotheses. Copyright Â© 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nPurposeThe purpose of this paper is to identify barriers that hinder tacit knowledge transfer in a franchise environment and offer a compendium of solutions that encourage franchisees and franchisors to leverage tacit knowledge as a resource for competitive advantage.Design/methodology/approachDrawing from the research on franchise organizations there are five barriers to tacit knowledge transfer that present a challenge to both vertical and horizontal information flow in a franchise environment. It is suggested that when specific behaviors and processes are adopted to encourage sharing tacit knowledge it is possible to reduce tension and promote collaboration in the franchise relationship.FindingsBarriers to tacit knowledge transfer in franchise organizations include: Trust, Maturation, Communication, Competition, and Culture. Ideas for fostering knowledge sharing are offered.Research limitations/implicationsThe factors identified only partially explain why there may be resistance ...\n\nIn the era of emerging knowledge economy, many companies strive to constantly update/develop intangible resources by participating in knowledge networks. An MNC is an example of a network which provides access to a large knowledge base. Within such a network inter-unit knowledge flows are facilitated by multiple mechanisms, including international assignments (IAs). An increasing variety and availability of less expensive IA forms can encourage small entities to adopt practices applied by larger organizations. This study endeavours to find out how small-, medium-sized subsidiaries use IAs in knowledge flow within corporate networks, identify emerging patterns, and compare these to large companies on empirical results obtained from companies with 100% foreign ownership. Four clusters representing different patterns of IA usage in cross-border knowledge flow by smalland medium-sized organizations were revealed.\n\nThis article offers a summary of the foundations of the knowledge management literature referring to subsidiaries of multinational companies. We look at the way in which the literature on managing knowledge has evolved, and investigate how the streams have built upon each other. We also examine the literature in the light of different management fields, revealing similarities and differences between the distinct research areas. Based on 98 reviewed articles, we build a theoretical framework for a better organization and understanding of MNC related knowledge management literature. Finally, using this framework, we look into the potential future research directions of the field."
