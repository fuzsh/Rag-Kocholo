        "text": "Fatigue - determination of a more realistic usage factor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLang, H.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe ability to use a suitable counting method for determining the stress range spectrum in elastic and simplified elastic-plastic fatigue analyses is of crucial importance for enabling determination of a realistic usage factor. Determination of elastic-plastic strain range using the K e factor from fictitious elastically calculated loads is also important in the event of elastic behaviour being exceeded. This paper thus examines both points in detail. A fatigue module with additional options, which functions on this basis is presented. The much more realistic determination of usage factor presented here offers various economic benefits depending on the application\n\nFatigue approach for addressing environmental effects in fatigue usage calculation\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWilhelm, Paul; Rudolph, Juergen [AREVA GmbH, Erlangen (Germany); Steinmann, Paul [Erlangen-Nuremberg Univ., erlangen (Germany).

However, actual plant components are characterized by complex loading patterns and periods of holds. Fatigue tests in water environment show, that the damage from a realistic strain variation or the presence of hold-times within cyclic loading results in an environmental reduction factor (Fen) only half that of a simple waveform. This study proposes a new fatigue approach for addressing environmental effects in fatigue usage calculation for class 1 boiler and pressure vessel reactor components. The currently accepted method of fatigue assessment has been used as a base model and all cycles, which have been comparable with realistic fatigue tests, have been excluded from the code-based fatigue calculation and evaluated directly with the test data.

In order to extend qualification (life) of components which have reached the Code design usage limit of unity, improved criteria are needed which address crack initiation and propagation separately such that safe operation of these components is ensured. The fatigue initiation phase is composed of two processes: initial microcracking of internal particles or accumulation of local strain (cyclic slip) creating discontinuities which form microcracks, and the growth of the microcracks in a noncontinuum manner. The microcracks which initiate will eventually grow to a size in which continuum mechanics apply, and fracture mechanics concepts have been employed. The later propagation to failure of a component is also composed of two parts, continuum crack growth in a stable manner and eventual unstable fracture of the remaining ligament of material. This paper reviews the current status of technology in assessing initiation and propagation relative to the current design Code and suggests areas of improvement to cover extended life of high usage factor components. To illustrate some of these considerations, a case study for a small manufacturing defect was reviewed. A realistic component was analyzed to investigate the interrelationship between the ASME Code Section III design life and crack propagation behavior of a small manufacturing defect. A pressurized water reactor (PWR) primary coolant system was used in the analysis, and the terminal end of the hot-leg pipe at the safe end weld was selected since usage factors as high as 0.95 had been reported. The particular plant chosen was Zion-1 because the necessary information on loading, including thermal transients, was available in the open literature. 11 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab\n\nKeep fatigue usage low for LTO. Benefits of load monitoring and related fatigue evaluations for long term operation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRothenhoefer, H.; Koenig, G.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDesign fatigue calculations normally cover a service life of 40 years. Based on design transients with a specified number of cycles the evaluations have to prove that the fatigue usage after 40 years will stay below 1. In 40+ years of operation real loads can differ much from design loads so that premature ageing can occur. For long term operation, monitoring of real loads and detailed fatigue analysis for selected locations can be used to optimize operational modes in order to reduce the loads causing fatigue. As a result fatigue usage can be kept below 1 even for 60+ years.

As a rule, operational load levels will exclude the purely elastic fatigue check. The application of the code procedure of the simplified elastic-plastic fatigue check is common practice. Nevertheless, resulting cumulative usage factors may be overly conservative mainly due to high code based plastification penalty factors Ke. As a consequence, the more complex and still code conforming general elastic-plastic fatigue analysis methodology based on non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) is applied for fatigue design as an alternative. The requirements of the FEA and the material law to be applied have to be clarified in a first step. Current design codes only give rough guidelines on these relevant items. While the procedure for the simplified elastic-plastic fatigue analysis and the associated code passages are based on stress related cycle counting and the determination of pseudo elastic equivalent stress ranges, an adaptation to elastic-plastic strains and strain ranges is required for the elastic-plastic fatigue check. The associated requirements are explained in detail in the paper. If the established and implemented evaluation mechanism (cycle counting according to the peak and valley respectively the rainflow method, calculation of stress ranges from arbitrary load-time histories and determination of cumulative usage factors based on all load events) is to be retained, a conversion of elastic-plastic strains and strain ranges into pseudo elastic stress ranges is required. The algorithm to be applied is described in the paper. It has to be implemented in the sense of an extended post processing operation of FEA e.g. by APDL scripts in ANSYS registered . Variations of principal stress (strain) directions during the loading\n\nFatigue Analysis of Tubesheet/Shell Juncture Applying the Mitigation Factor for Over-conservatism\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKang, Deog Ji; Kim, Kyu Hyoung; Lee, Jae Gon\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIf the environmental fatigue requirements are applied to the primary components of a nuclear power plant, to which the present ASME Code fatigue curves are applied, some locations with high level CUF (Cumulative Usage Factor) are anticipated not to meet the code criteria. The application of environmental fatigue damage is still particularly controversial for plants with 60-year design lives. Therefore, it is need to develop a detailed fatigue analysis procedure to identify the conservatisms in the procedure and to lower the cumulative usage factor. Several factors are being considered to mitigate the conservatism such as three-dimensional finite element modeling. In the present analysis, actual pressure transient data instead of conservative maximum and minimum pressure data was applied as one of mitigation factors. Unlike in the general method, individual transient events were considered instead of the grouped transient events. The tubesheet/shell juncture in the steam generator assembly is the one of the weak locations and was, therefore, selected as a target to evaluate the mitigation factor in the present analysis\n\nAreva fatigue concept. Fast fatigue evaluation, a new method for fatigue analysis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHeinz, Benedikt; Bergholz, Steffen; Rudolph, Juergen\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWithin the discussions on the long term operation (LTO) of nuclear power plants the ageing management is on the focus of that analysis. The knowledge of the operational thermal cyclic load data on components of the power plants and their evaluation in the fatigue analysis is a central concern. The changes in fatigue requirements (e.g. the consideration of environmentally assisted fatigue - EAF) recently discussed and LTO efforts are a strong motivation for the identification of margins in the existing fatigue analysis approaches. These margins should be considered within new approaches in order to obtain realistic (or more accurate) analysis results. Of course, these new analysis approaches have to be manageable and efficient. The Areva Fatigue Concept (AFC) offers the comprehensive conceptual basis for the consideration of fatigue on different levels and depths. The combination of data logging and automated fatigue evaluation are important modules of the AFC. Besides the established simplified stress based fatigue estimation Areva develops a further automated fatigue analysis method called Fast Fatigue Evaluation (FFE). This method comprises highly automated stress analyses at the fatigue relevant locations of the component. Hence, a component specific course of stress as a function of time is determined based on FAMOS or similar temperature measurement systems. The subsequent application of the rain flow cycle counting algorithm allows for the determination of the usage factor following the rules of the design code requirements. The new FFE approach constitutes a cycle counting method based on the real stresses in the component, and determined as result a rule-conformity cumulative usage factor. (orig.)\n\nA methodology for on line fatigue life monitoring : rainflow cycle counting method\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMukhopadhyay, N.K.; Dutta, B.K.; Kushwaha, H.S.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nGreen's function technique is used in on line fatigue life monitoring to convert plant data to stress versus time data. This technique converts plant data most efficiently to stress versus time data. To compute the fatigue usage factor the actual number of cycles experienced by the component is to be found out from stress versus time data. Using material fatigue properties the fatigue usage factor is to be computed from the number of cycles. Generally the stress response is very irregular in nature. To convert an irregular stress history to stress frequency spectra rainflow cycle counting method is used. This method is proved to be superior to other counting methods and yields best fatigue estimates. A code has been developed which computes the number of cycles experienced by the component from stress time history using rainflow cycle counting method. This postprocessor also computes the accumulated fatigue usage factor from material fatigue properties. The present report describes the development of a code to compute fatigue usage factor using rainflow cycle counting technique and presents a real life case study.

It is the opinion of the authors, that the mentioned best estimate procedures should be used in the course of fatigue assessment to fulfill e.g. the demands of the KTA code with regard to environmental assisted fatigue.

Using the example of the low alloy fine grain structural steel 20 Mn Mo Ni 5 5 (annealed structure), the relationship between micro-structure and the number of load cycles is shown in the form of a calibration curve. By high resolution structural investigation, the usage factor can be determined to n = N/N B â 0.5 under given vibration stress. Only a small volume sample is required for the electron microscope examination.

Current Argonne and Japanese research efforts are reviewed and an approach to calculate an environmental correction factor is described. A description of how the proposed approach can be implemented in section III, NB-3600 and NB-3200-type fatigue evaluations is presented along with examples of applying the approach to piping (NB-3600) and safe end fatigue evaluations. These procedures were applied to several BWR and pressurized water reactor (PWR) example cases. The results of these case studies indicated that there is a modest increase in calculated fatigue usage, which is considerably less than the results obtained when the NUREG/CR-5999 curves are applied directly.

The fatigue analysis of HANARO primary cooling system (PCS) piping was performed. The PCS piping had been designed in accordance with ASME Class 3 for service conditions. However fatigue analysis is not required in Class 3. In this study the quantitative fatigue analysis was carried out according to ASME Class 1. The highest stress points which have the largest possibility of ASME class 1. The highest stress points which have the largest possibility of the fatigue were determined from the piping stress analysis for each subsection piping. The fatigue analysis was performed for 3 highest stress points, i.e., branch connection, anchor point and butt welding joint. After calculating the peak stress intensity range the fatigue usage factors were evaluated considering operating cycles and S-N curve. The cumulative usage factors for 3 highest stress points were much less than 1. The results show that the possibility of fatigue failure for PCS piping subjected to thermal expansion and seismic loads is very small. The structural integrity of the HANARO PCS piping for fatigue failure was proved to apply the LBB.

This procedure is known to be overly conservative for some conditions due to the applied plastification (penalty) factor K e . As a consequence, less conservative fully elastic plastic fatigue analyses based on non-linear finite element analyses (FEA) or simplified elastic plastic analysis based on more realistic K e factors have to be used for fatigue design. The demand for more realistic K e factors is covered as a requirement of practical fatigue analysis. Different code-based K e procedures are reviewed in this paper with special regard to performance under thermal cyclic loading conditions. Other approximation formulae such as those by Neuber, Seeger/Beste or Kuehnapfel are not evaluated in this context because of their applicability to mechanical loading excluding thermal cyclic loading conditions typical for power plant operation. Besides the current code-based K e corrections, the ASME Code Case N-779 (e.g. Adam's proposal) and its modification in ASME Section VIII is considered. Comparison of elastic plastic results and results from the Rules for Nuclear Facility Components and Rules for Pressure Vessels reveals a considerable overestimation of usage factor in the case of ASME III and KTA 3201.2 for the examined examples. Usage factors according to RCC-M, Adams (ASME Code Case N-779), ASME VIII (alternative) and EN 13445-3 are essentially comparable and less conservative for these examples. The K v correction as well as the applied yield criterion (Tresca or von Mises) essentially influence the quality of the more advanced plasticity corrections (e.g. ASME Code Case N-779 and RCC-M). Hence, new proposals are based on a refined K v correction.\n\nFatigue Reliability and Calibration of Fatigue Design Factors for Offshore Wind Turbines\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSergio MÃ¡rquez-DomÃ­nguez\n\n2012-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Consequences of failure of offshore wind turbines (OWTs is in general lower than consequences of failure of, e.g., oil & gas platforms. It is reasonable that lower fatigue design factors can be applied for fatigue design of OWTs when compared to other fixed offshore structures. Calibration of appropriate partial safety factors/Fatigue Design Factors (FDF for steel substructures for OWTs is the scope of this paper. A reliability-based approach is used and a probabilistic model has been developed, where design and limit state equations are established for fatigue failure. The strength and load uncertainties are described by stochastic variables. SN and fracture mechanics approaches are considered for to model the fatigue life. Further, both linear and bi-linear SN-curves are formulated and various approximations are investigated. The acceptable reliability level for fatigue failure of OWTs is discussed and results are presented for calibrated optimal fatigue design factors. Further, the influence of inspections is considered in order to extend and maintain a given target safety level.\n\nSI:FatiguePro 4 Advanced Approach for Fatigue Monitoring\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEvon, Keith; Gilman, Tim; Carney, Curt\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMany nuclear plants are making commitments to implement fatigue monitoring systems in support of license renewal. Current fatigue monitoring systems use the methodology of ASME Code Subarticle NB-3200, which is a design code intended to compute a bounding cumulative usage factor (CUF). The first generation of fatigue monitoring software utilized a simplified, single stress term assumption and classical stress cycle-counting methods that take order into account such as Rainflow or Ordered Overall Range counting. Recently, the NRC has indicated in Regulatory Issue Summary 2008-30 that any fatigue analyses in support of License Renewal should use ASME Code Section III methodologies considering all six stress components. In addition, fatigue calculations for the license renewal term are required to consider the effects of environment. The implementation of a six stress term NB-3200 fatigue calculation to a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) feedwater nozzle, including environmental effects, is the topic of this paper. Differences in results between the advanced methodology and the simplified methodology are discussed.

The paper present the procedure, the background of the methodology and few R and D work that support this procedure. The procedure is based on: screening criteria on maximum DT and minimum duration. screening criteria without any duration consideration, only DT and material. a simplified and conservative estimation of a usage factor. a detailed analysis of usage factor and crack growth rate, based on specific data collection of operating transients. Around that procedure EDF launched an R and D program on fatigue curves and fatigue reduction factors for high cycle fatigue. The procedure is compared with field experience and recent R and D fatigue tests.

Especially for cyclic stress evaluation the different codes and standards provide different fatigue analyses procedures to be performed considering the various mechanical and thermal loading histories and geometric complexities of the components. To consider effects of light water reactor coolant environments, new design curves included in report NUREG/CR-6909 for austenitic stainless steels and for low alloy steels have been presented. For the usage of these new design curves an environmental fatigue correction factor for incorporating environmental effects has to be calculated and used. The application of this environmental correction factor to a fatigue analysis of a nozzle with transient stratification loads, derived by in-service monitoring, has been performed. The results are used to compare with calculated usage factors, based on design curves without taking environmental effects particularly into account. - Highlights: âº We model an nozzle for fatigue analysis und mechanical and thermal loading conditions. âº A simplified as well as a general elasticâplastic fatigue analysis considering environmental effects is performed. âº The influence of different factors calculating the environmental factor F en are shown. âº The presented numerical evaluation methodology allows the consideration of all relevant parameters to assess lifetime.\n\nAn environmental factor approach to account for reactor water effects in light water reactor pressure vessel and piping fatigue evaluations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMehta, H.S.; Gosselin, S.R.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThis paper summarizes past and current studies of the environmental fatigue effects in LWR applications.

Quantification of the microstructural changes and allocation of the microstructural condition to the corresponding point on the fatigue curve for the component material allows the usage factor to be derived. Taking the low-alloy, fine-grained structural steel 20MnMoNi55 (quenched and tempered structure) as an example, the relationship between microstructure and number of load cycles can be represented in the form of a reference curve. High-resolution examination allows the usage factor to be determined up to Î·=N/N f â 0.5 under the given cyclic loading. Only a small specimen volume is required for examination using a transmission electron microscope. It can be taken from the component without affecting the required minimum wall thickness. The location of the specimen must, however, be stipulated, e.g. the location of highest loading according to calculations. When removing the specimen, care must be taken to ensure that the micro-structure is not affected. If these requirements are observed, high-resolution microstructural examination provides a method for checking the usage factor of a component.

After review of numerous Class 1 stress reports, it is apparent that there is a substantial amount of conservatism present in many existing component fatigue evaluations. With little effort, existing evaluations could be modified to reduce the overall predicted fatigue usage. Areas of conservatism include design transients considerably more severe than those experienced during service, conservative grouping of transients, conservatisms that have been removed in later editions of Section 3, bounding heat transfer and stress analysis, and use of the ''elastic-plastic penalty factor'' (K 3 ). Environmental effects were evaluated for two typical components that experience severe transient thermal cycling during service, based on both design transients and actual plant data. For all reasonable values of actual operating parameters, environmental effects reduced predicted margins, but fatigue usage was still bounded by the ASME Section 3 fatigue design curves. It was concluded that the potential increase in predicted fatigue usage due to environmental effects should be more than offset by decreases in predicted fatigue usage if re-analysis were conducted to reduce the conservatisms that are present in existing component fatigue evaluations\n\nPower factor regulation for household usage\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDaud, Nik Ghazali Nik; Hashim, Fakroul Ridzuan; Tarmizi, Muhammad Haziq Ahmad\n\n2018-02-01\n\nPower factor regulator technology has recently drawn attention to the consumer and to power generation company in order for consumers to use electricity efficiently. Controlling of power factor for efficient usage can reduce the production of power in fulfilment demands hence reducing the greenhouse effect. This paper presents the design method of power factor controller for household usage. There are several methods to improve the power factor. The power factor controller used by this method is by using capacitors.

Cancer-related fatigue causes disruption in all aspects of quality of life and might be a risk factor of reduced survival. The prevalence and course of fatigue in patients with cancer have been well characterized and there is growing understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Inflammation seems to have a key role in fatigue before, during, and after cancer-treatment. However, there is a considerable variability in the presentation of cancer-related fatigue, much of which is not explained by disease-related or treatment-related characteristics, suggesting that host factors might be important in the development and persistence of this symptom. Indeed, longitudinal studies have identified genetic, biological, psychosocial, and behavioural risk factors associated with cancer-related fatigue. Although no current gold-standard treatment for fatigue is available, a variety of intervention approaches have shown beneficial effects in randomized controlled trials, including physical activity, psychosocial, mind-body, and pharmacological treatments.

Cancer-related fatigue causes disruption in all aspects of quality of life and may be a risk factor for reduced survival. The prevalence and course of fatigue in cancer patients has been well characterized, and there is growing understanding of underlying biological mechanisms. Inflammation has emerged as a key biological pathway for cancer-related fatigue, with studies documenting links between markers of inflammation and fatigue before, during, and particularly after treatment. There is considerable variability in the experience of cancer-related fatigue that is not explained by disease- or treatment-related characteristics, suggesting that host factors may play an important role in the development and persistence of this symptom. Indeed, longitudinal studies have begun to identify genetic, biological, psychosocial, and behavioral risk factors for cancer-related fatigue. Given the multi-factorial nature of cancer-related fatigue, a variety of intervention approaches have been examined in randomized controlled trials, including physical activity, psychosocial, mind-body, and pharmacological treatments. Although there is currently no gold standard for treating fatigue, several of these approaches have shown beneficial effects and can be recommended to patients. This report provides a state of the science review of mechanisms, risk factors, and interventions for cancer-related fatigue, with a focus on recent longitudinal studies and randomized trials that have targeted fatigued patients.

The results show that the structure with thicker seal ring behaves more safely than the other one except in the second condition. Meanwhile, the amplify of the primary and secondary stress as well as fatigue usage factor can be reduced by regrouping the transients. The precision of fatigue usage factor can be elevated using modified K e when the amplify of the primary and secondary stress is large to some extent produced by both thermal and mechanical loads.

The aim of this study is to evaluate fatigue status and find related factors of fatigue among students ranged from 13-26 years from Wuhu, China. This is a case-control, cross-sectional observational study. The students from six middle schools (high school? 26 years old?) in Wuhu city were recruited, Self-Rating Fatigue Scale (SFS) was used to measure the fatigue status among students ranged from 13-26 years, and some demographic characteristics of students also was determined. A total of 726 students are included in our study. A significant difference was observed between fatigue status and grade, a balanced diet, the partial eclipse, picky for food, lack of sleep, excessive fatigue, drinking (P sleep, drinking; grade while a balanced diet is the protective factor of fatigue. Therefore, the school should pay more attention to the fatigue among students in middle school in China, and take some properly measures to reduce the fatigue.\n\nFatigue in Intensive Care Nurses and Related Factors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nÃelik, Sevim; TaÅdemir, Nurten; Kurt, Aylin; Ä°lgezdi, Ebru; Kubalas, Ãzge\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFatigue negatively affects the performance of intensive care nurses. Factors contributing to the fatigue experienced by nurses include lifestyle, psychological status, work organization and sleep problems. To determine the level of fatigue among nurses working in intensive care units and the related factors. This descriptive study was conducted with 102 nurses working in intensive care units in the West Black Sea Region of Turkey. Data were collected between February and May 2014 using a personal information form, the Visual Analogue Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. The intensive care nurses in the study were found to be experiencing fatigue. Significant correlations were observed between scores on the VAS-F Fatigue and anxiety (p=0.01), depression (p=0.002), and sleep quality (pnurses' levels of fatigue. These results can be of benefit in taking measures which may be used to reduce fatigue in nurses, especially the fatigue related to work organization and social life.\n\nFretting fatigue life estimation using fatigue damage gradient correction factor in various contact configurations\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHwang, Dong Hyeon; Cho, Sung-San [Hongik University, Seoul (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2017-03-15\n\nA fretting fatigue life estimation method that takes into account the stress gradient effect was developed by the authors [Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology, 28 (2014) 2153-2159]. In the developed method, fatigue damage value at the cracking location is corrected with fatigue damage gradient and the corrected value is compared directly with the plain fatigue data for life estimation. In other words, the correction factor is the ratio of plain fatigue damage to fretting fatigue damage at the same life and a function of fatigue damage gradient. Since reliability of the method was verified only for cylinder-on-flat contact configuration in the previous study, the present study extends application of the method to flat-on-flat contact configurations by developing the correction factor for both the contact configuration. Fretting fatigue experiments were conducted to obtain fatigue life data for various fretting pads. Finite element analyses were conducted to evaluate the Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) fatigue damage parameter in the cracking region. It is revealed that the SWT parameter in fat-on-flat contact configuration decreases exponentially away from the surface as in cylinder-on-flat contact configuration, and thus the SWT gradient at the surface can be evaluated reliably. Moreover, it is found that decrease in the SWT parameter around the cracking location can be expressed by piecewise exponential curves. If the gradient of SWT at the surface is used as a representative value of SWT gradient, it is impossible to establish functional relationship between the SWT gradient and the correction factor for both the contact configurations although it was possible for cylinder-on-flat contact configuration. However, if weighted average of the SWT gradient values obtained from each exponential curve in the piecewise exponential curve is used as a representative value, the correction factor for both the contact configurations becomes a function of the SWT gradient\n\nConcept of a new method for fatigue monitoring of nuclear power plant components\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZafosnik, M.; Cizelj, L.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFatigue is one of the well-understood aging mechanisms affecting mechanical components in many industrial facilities including nuclear power plants. Operational experience of nuclear power plants worldwide to date confirmed adequate design of safety related components against fatigue. In some cases however, for example when the plant life extension is envisioned, it may be very useful to monitor the remaining fatigue life of safety related components. Nuclear power plants components are classified into safety classes regarding their importance in mitigating the consequences of hypothetic accidents. Service life of components subjected to fatigue loading can be estimated with Usage Factor uk. A concept of the new method aiming both at monitoring the current state of the component and predicting its remaining lifetime in the life-extension conditions is presented. The method is based on determination of partial Usage Factor of components in which operating transients will be considered and compared to design transients.

Especially for cyclic stress evaluation the different codes and standards provide different fatigue analyses procedures to be performed considering the various (specified or measured) loading histories which are of mechanical and/or thermal origin and the geometric complexities of the components. In order to fully understand the background of the fatigue analysis included in the codes and standards as well as of the fatigue design curves used as a limiting criteria (to determine the fatigue life usage factor), it is important to understand the history, background as well as the methodologies which are important for the design engineers to get reliable results. The design rules according to the technical codes and standards provide for explicit consideration of cyclic operation, using design fatigue curves of allowable alternating loads (allowable stress or strain amplitudes) vs. number of loading cycles (S/N-curves), specific rules for assessing the cumulative fatigue damage (cumulative fatigue life usage factor) caused by different specified or monitored load cycles. The influence of different factors like welds, environment, surface finish, temperature, mean stress and size must be taken into consideration. In the paper parameters influencing the S/N-curves used within a fatigue analysis, like different type of material, the surface finish, the temperature, the difference between unwelded and welded areas, the strain rate as well as the influences of notches are verified on the basis of experimental results obtained by specimens testing in the LCF regime for high strain amplitudes. Thus safety margins relevant for the assessment of fatigue life depending on the different influencing parameters are\n\nA survey of fatigue monitoring in the nuclear power industry\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWare, A.G.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe original design of nuclear power plants addressed fatigue concerns by including calculations of projected fatigue usage for specific components; the calculations were based on estimates of the number and severity of expected transients over the 40-year design life of the plants. In some cases, the transients occurring in the plants are not as severe as was anticipated in the original design analyses, while in other cases events have occurred that were not anticipated in the design basis documents. Field failures caused by fatigue have identified some of those cases. In response, several organizations in the United States and overseas have developed fatigue monitoring programs to more accurately estimate the fatigue usage. One basic approach consists of reconstructing the fatigue usage to date based on the transients recorded in the operating history instead of those projected in the design documents. Another approach includes monitoring the plant instrumentation to determine actual values for parameters such as temperature and pressure and using the measured values in the fatigue usage calculations instead of the values projected in the design documents. The use of existing plant instrumentation to measure temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc., along with the incorporation of conservative assumptions, had generally proven adequate for estimating fatigue usage; however, in some cases additional instrumentation installed for local monitoring can provide a more accurate estimate, especially where thermal stratification is known to occur. Fatigue monitoring can aid in identifying fatigue concerns not anticipated in the original design and for reducing the excessive conservatism in some of the original design calculations so that the fatigue lives of these components can be justified as they age. Fatigue monitoring can also assist efforts to reduce ongoing fatigue usage through design modifications and operating procedure changes\n\nRMS fatigue curves for random vibrations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrenneman, B.; Talley, J.G.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nFatigue usage factors for deterministic or constant amplitude vibration stresses may be calculated with well known procedures and fatigue curves given in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. However, some phenomena produce nondeterministic cyclic stresses which can only be described and analyzed with statistical concepts and methods. Such stresses may be caused by turbulent fluid flow over a structure. Previous methods for solving this statistical fatigue problem are often difficult to use and may yield inaccurate results. Two such methods examined herein are Crandall's method and the ''3sigma'' method. The objective of this paper is to provide a method for creating ''RMS fatigue curves'' which accurately incorporate the requisite statistical information. These curves are given and may be used by analysts with the same ease and in the same manner as the ASME fatigue curves\n\nConsideration of the environmental effects on fatigue behavior of austenitic components. Calculation methods and practical application\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSeichter, Johannes; Reese, Sven H.; Klucke, Dietmar\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDuring the last years environmental effects on the fatigue behavior of nuclear power plant components has worldwide been discussed controversial with respect to the transferability of laboratory data on real components. A publication from Argonne National Laboratory on experimental results concerning environmental effects (air and LWR coolant) on fatigue of austenitic steels included a proposal on calculation methods concerning the lifetime reduction due to environmental effects. This calculation method, i.e. multiplication of the usage factor by a F(en), has been included into the ASME Code, Section III, Division I, as Code Case N-792 (fatigue evaluations including environmental effects). The presented contribution evaluates the practical application of this calculation procedure and demonstrates the determination of the usage factor of an austenitic component under environmental exposure.\n\nA fatigue analysis including environmental effects for a pipe system in a Swedish BWR\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSteingrimsdottir, Kristin; Dahlberg, Magnus\n\n2011-10-01\n\nA BWR feed water piping system (austenitic steel) has been analyzed with two different fatigue curves and environmental factors. Original fatigue curve from ASME is compared to a new fatigue curve; ANL. The influence of environmental correction factors (Fen) is studied further for the piping system. It is noted that the results apply for this particular system, and general conclusions should be cautiously drawn. Typical for this system is that all dominant loads are within the low-cycle regime. This implies that the change of fatigue curve only leads to limited increases in usage factors. Larger changes can occur if larger number of cycles is within the high-cycle regime\n\nFatigue Reliability and Calibration of Fatigue Design Factors for Offshore Wind Turbines\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nDominguez, Sergio Marquez; SÃ¸rensen, John Dalsgaard\n\n2012-01-01\n\nConsequences of failure of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are in general lower than consequences of failure of, e.g., oil & gas platforms.

The system uses the influence function approach and determines component stresses using temperature, pressure, and flow rate data that are made available via signal taps from previously existing plant sensors. Using plant unique influence functions developed specifically for the feedwater nozzle location, the system calculates stresses as a function of time and computed fatigue usage. The analysis method used to compute fatigue usage complies with MITI Code Notification No.501. Fatigue usage results for an entire fuel cycle are presented and compared to assumed design basis events to confirm that actual plant thermal duty is significantly less severe than originally estimated in the design basis stress report. As a result, the system provides the technical basis to more accurately evaluate actual reactor conditions as well as the justification for plant life extension.

Postpartum fatigue can lead to serious negative effects on the mother's health and the newborn's development and interfere with mother-infant interaction. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify predictive factors of postpartum fatigue and to document the magnitude of their effects using effect sizes. We used two search engines, PubMed and Google Scholar, to identify studies that met three inclusion criteria: (a) the article was written in English, (b) the article studied the predictive factors of postpartum fatigue, and (c) the article included information about the validity and reliability of the instruments used in the research. Nine articles met these inclusion criteria. The direction and strength of correlation coefficients between predictive factors and postpartum fatigue were examined across the studies to determine their effect sizes. Measurement of predictor variables occurred from 3days to 6months postpartum. Correlations reported between predictive factors and postpartum fatigue were as follows: small effect size (r range =0.10 to 0.29) for education level, age, postpartum hemorrhage, infection, and child care difficulties; medium effect size (r range =0.30 to 0.49) for physiological illness, low ferritin level, low hemoglobin level, sleeping problems, stress and anxiety, and breastfeeding problems; and large effect size (r range =0.50+) for depression. Postpartum fatigue is a common condition that can lead to serious health problems for a new mother and her newborn. Therefore, increased knowledge concerning factors that influence the onset of postpartum fatigue is needed for early identification of new mothers who may be at risk. Appropriate treatments, interventions, information, and support can then be initiated to prevent or minimize the postpartum fatigue.

The study population consisted of 502 pilots who participated in the MORE Energy study. Included risk factors were either measured through an online questionnaire or provided by the company. The outcome of this study, fatigue, was assessed using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), and was defined as scoring more than 76 points on this questionnaire. The association of the risk factors with fatigue was determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Of the participating pilots, 29.5Â % scored more than 76 points on the CIS and were classified as being fatigued. The fully adjusted regression model showed that person-, work-, health-, and lifestyle-related characteristics were associated with fatigue. Pilots who were aged 31 to 40 (OR 3.36, 95Â % CI 1.32-8.53) or 41 to 50 (OR 4.19, 95Â % CI 1.40-12.47), an evening type (OR 2.40, 95Â % CI 1.38-4.16), scored higher on work-life balance disturbance (OR 1.22, 95Â % CI 1.10-1.36), scored higher on need for recovery (OR 1.02, 95Â % CI 1.01-1.04), scored lower on general health perception (OR 0.31, 95Â % CI 0.20-0.47), were less physically active (OR 0.77, 95Â % CI 0.66-0.89), and had a moderate alcohol consumption (OR 3.88, 95Â % CI 1.21-12.43), were at higher risk for fatigue. Higher age, being an evening type, disturbance of the work-life balance, more need for recovery, a lower perceived health, less physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption were shown to be risk factors for fatigue. Further longitudinal research is needed to elucidate the direction of the associations found and to evaluate the effects of possible countermeasures in airline pilots.\n\nFatigue life evaluation method of austenitic stainless steel in PWR water\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSakaguchi, Katsumi; Nomura, Yuichiro; Suzuki, Shigeki; Kanasaki, Hiroshi; Higuchi, Makoto\n\n2006-09-01\n\nIt is known that the fatigue life in elevated temperature water is substantially reduced compared with that in the air. The fatigue life reduction has been investigated experimentally in EFT project of Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization (JNES) to evaluate the environmental effect on fatigue life. Many tests have been done for carbon, low alloy, stainless steels and nickel-based alloy under the various conditions. In this paper, the results of the stainless steel in simulated PWR water environments were reported. Fatigue life tests in simulated PWR environments were carried out and the effect of key parameters on fatigue life reduction was examined. The materials used in this study were base and weld metal of austenitic stainless steel SS316, weld metal of SS304 and the base and aged metal of the duplex stainless steel SCS14A. In order to evaluate the effects of stain amplitude, strain rate, strain ratio, temperature, aging, water flow rate and strain holding time, many fatigue tests were examined. In transient condition in an actual plant, however, such parameters as temperature and strain rate are not constant. In order to evaluate fatigue damage in actual plant on the basis of experimental results under constant temperature and strain rate condition, the modified rate approach method was developed. Various kinds of transient have to be taken into account of in actual plant fatigue evaluation, and stress cycle of several ranges of amplitude has to be considered in assessing damage from fatigue. Generally, cumulative usage factor is applied in this type of evaluation. In this study, in order to confirm the applicability of modified rate approach method together with cumulative usage factor, fatigue tests were carried out by combining stress cycle blocks of different strain amplitude levels, in which strain rate changes in response to temperature in a simulated PWR water environment. Consequently, fatigue life could be evaluated with an accuracy of factor of 3\n\nCreep-fatigue rules in the RCC-MR code\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDrubay, B.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nIn 1978, CEA, Electricite de France (EDF) and NOVATOME decided to draw up a complete set of design and construction rules for LMFBR components. This RCC-MR code issued in June 1985 and completed in November 1987 was chosen as a sound basis for the next European Fast Reactor (EFR). The purpose of this paper is to describe the present RCC-MR creep-fatigue design rules to be applied with elastic analysis including the modifications adopted in the first addenda. This method is based on a separate evaluation of a fatigue usage fraction V and creep rupture usage fraction W with the common linear summation rule. The fatigue usage fraction is obtained from continuous fatigue curves (without hold times) and from total strain ranges (elastic + plastic + creep). The creep rupture usage fraction W is obtained from stress to rupture curves and a stress Ïk evaluating the stress generated during the cycle.

The materials selected in this study were austenitic steel (SUS316NG) and ferritic steel (SFVQ1A, STS410: JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards). The low cycle fatigue tests at RT and middle high temperature (300 degrees C) were carried out using cyclic plastic pre-strained materials. The results obtained here show that the damage by the cyclic plastic pre-strain, which is equivalent to usage factor UF=0.2, does not affect the fatigue lives of the materials. In addition, it is confirmed that the estimation based on the usage factor UF can also be useful for the life prediction at 300 degrees C as well as RT.

Cross-sectional study conducted on all emergency and critical care nurses across Brunei public hospitals from February to April 2016. 201 nurses participated in the study (82% response rate). A total of 36% of the variance of chronic fatigue was explained by stress, trust in management, decision latitude, self-rated health, and work-family conflict. Burnout, self-rated health, commitment to workplace, and trust in management explained 30% of the variance of acute fatigue. Stress, work-family conflict and reward explained 28% of the variance of intershift recovery after controlling for significant sociodemographic variables. Smoking was identified as an important sociodemographic factor for work-related fatigue. Psychosocial factors were good predictors of work-related fatigue. A range of psychosocial factors were established, however more research is required to determine all possible causation factors of nurses' work-related fatigue.\n\nRisk factors for fatigue in patients with epilepsy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYan, Song; Wu, Yuanbin; Deng, Yanchun; Liu, Yonghong; Zhao, Jingjing; Ma, Lei\n\n2016-11-01\n\nFatigue is highly prevalent in patients with epilepsy and has a major impact on quality of life, but little data is available on its effects and management in epilepsy. To identify the incidence and risk factors of fatigue in patients with epilepsy, 105 epilepsy patients (45 women and 60 men) were enrolled in our study. Demographic and clinical data were collected and psychological variables including fatigue, sleep quality, excess daytime sleepiness, anxiety, and depression were measured by Fatigue Severity Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively. Of 105 patients, 29.5% exhibited fatigue (FSS score â©¾4). We found no correlation between the occurrence of fatigue and any of our demographic or clinical variables. Fatigue is correlated with low sleep quality, anxiety, and depression, but not with excess daytime sleepiness. Thus, we concluded that fatigue is highly prevalent in patients with epilepsy, and that low sleep quality, anxiety, and depression are significantly correlated with fatigue in epileptics, while excess daytime sleepiness not.

Live demonstration\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBergholz, Steffen; Rudolph, Juergen; Bruckmueller, Florian; Heinz, Benedikt; Jouan, Benoit\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe fatigue assessment of power plant components based on local fatigue monitoring approaches is an essential part of the integrity concept and modern lifetime management. An integral approach like the AREVA Fatigue Concept (AFC) basically consists of two essential modules: realistic determination of occurring operational thermal loads by means of a high end fatigue monitoring system and related highly qualified fatigue assessment methods and tools. The fatigue monitoring system delivers continuously realistic load data at the fatigue relevant locations. Consequently, realistic operational load sequences are available as input data for all ensuing fatigue analyses. This way, realistic load data are available and qualified fatigue usage factors can be determined. The mode of operation of the fatigue monitoring system will be explained in the framework of a live demonstration by means of the FAMOSi (i = integrated) demonstration wall. The workflow starts with the continuous online measurement of outer wall temperatures transients on a pipe. Visualization is implemented within the FAMOSi viewer software. In a second step, inner wall temperatures are directly calculated. In a third step, the resulting linearly elastic stress history will be calculated as the basis for subsequent code conforming fatigue assessment. Subsequently, the related advanced fatigue assessment methods of the three staged AFC-approach are addressed.\n\nEffect of cyclic plastic pre-strain on low cycle fatigue life\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKanno, Satoshi; Nakane, Motoki; Yorikawa, Morio; Takagi, Yoshio\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn order to evaluate structural integrity of nuclear components subjected large seismic load which produce locally plastic strain, low cycle fatigue life was examined using cyclic plastic pre-strained materials of austenitic steel (SUS316, SUS316L, SUS304TP: JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards)) and ferritic steel (SFVQ1A, STS480, STPT410, SFVC2B, SS400: JIS).

S.; Youm, H. K.; Jin, T. E.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe fatigue lifetime of principal components in nuclear power plant is evaluated by using the design fatigue curves in ASME B and PV code during design process. However, it is inadequate to evaluate fatigue lifetime considering the LWR environmental effect by these design fatigue curves because these are presented only under atmosphere environment. Therefore, many studies are recently performed for the design fatigue curves considering LWR environmental effect and are presented that the design fatigue curves in ASME B and PV code can be non-conservative. In present paper, the limits and differences of the design fatigue curves considering environmental effect are presented. To investigate the change of fatigue lifetime according to each design fatigue curve, the CUFs for the pressurizer spray nozzle partly composed of austenitic stainless steel are calculated according to each one. Finally, if the evaluation result can not be satisfied with fatigue design requirement, the alternatives to reduce design cumulative usage factor are discussed.

However, no studies have addressed how fatigue is understood by paramedics. The present study addresses this shortcoming by exploring factors paramedics recognise as contributors to fatigue. Forty-nine (12F; 38 years Â± 9.7 years) Australian paramedics completed a survey on perceived causes of performance impairing fatigue. A total of 107 responses were systematically coded following principles common to qualitative data analysis: data immersion, coding, categorisation and theme generation. Six themes emerged: working time, sleep, workload, health and well-being, work-life balance and environment. Consistent with a scientific understanding of fatigue, prior sleep and wake, time of day and task-related factors were often identified as contributing to fatigue. In other cases, paramedics' attributions deviated from a scientific understanding of direct causes of fatigue. These findings demonstrate that paramedics have a broad understanding of fatigue. It is critical to take this into account when discussing fatigue with paramedics, particularly in the case of fatigue education or wellness programmes. These data highlight areas for intervention and education to minimise the experience of paramedic fatigue and the negative health and safety outcomes for paramedics and patients as a result.

Design stress analysis sometimes reports very high fatigue usage factors for such portions of RPVs as stud bolt, feedwater nozzle and support skirt.In order to evaluate design margin and to eliminate excessive conservatism in this design analysis to pave the way for PLEX, Japanese BWR utilities jointly with BWR manufacturers in Japan established a programme (1) to acquire plant operational data on line for specific parameters used in stress analysis, (2) to evaluate margin in the design using measured plant data best estimate boundary conditions for stress analysis, and (3) to establish a simplified fatigue analysis method for BWR RPV.A plant data acquisition system, named OPEDAS, has been developed and installed in Tokyo Electric Power Company's 1100MWe BWR at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant. Best estimate stress analysis using measured in-plant data has been carried out and the results show considerable margin in fatigue usage factor over the design. A simplified fatigue analysis method using in-plant data has been developed with the Green's function, although some limitations have been identified for its use.

Health-related quality of life (QOL is an important outcome in cancer management, the authors sought to better understand its determinants. Aim: This study aims to identify quality of life and fatigue levels and the affecting factors in gynaecologic cancer patients. Method: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with 154 volunteer women with gynaecologic cancer. The data were collected through the interview form, functional assessment of cancer therapy-general (FACT-G Quality of Life Scale, and Piper Fatigue Scale. Results: The mean score of total quality of life in gynaecologic cancer patients was low, 53.4 Â± 15.4. Physical and emotional states were found to be the mostly affected states in the quality of life. According to the Piper Fatigue Scale, the total fatigue score was mild, 3.5 Â± 2.4. Total fatigue scores were found to be high in metastatic cancers. Multivariate analyses indicate that the most important factor affecting the quality of life is economic condition, and the most important variables affecting fatigue are the level of activity and use of medicine. Conclusion: This study found that quality of life dimensions in women with gynaecologic cancer was affected by factors such as cancer type, time of diagnosis, and stage and spread of the cancer.\n\nDepressive symptoms and inflammation are independent risk factors of fatigue in breast cancer survivors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXiao, C; Miller, A H; Felger, J; Mister, D; Liu, T; Torres, M A\n\n2017-07-01\n\nPsychosocial and inflammatory factors have been associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors. Nevertheless, the relative contribution and/or interaction of these factors with cancer-related fatigue have not been well documented. This cross-sectional study enrolled 111 stage 0-III breast cancer patients treated with breast surgery followed by whole breast radiotherapy. Fatigue was measured by the total score of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20. Potential risk factors included inflammatory markers (plasma cytokines and their receptors and C-reactive protein; CRP), depressive symptoms (as assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Reported), sleep (as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and perceived stress (as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale) as well as age, race, marital status, smoking history, menopause status, endocrine treatment, chemotherapy and cancer stage. Linear regression modeling was employed to examine risk factors of fatigue. Only risk factors with a significance level fatigue. At 1 year post-radiotherapy, depressive symptoms (pfatigue. Mediation analysis showed that depressive symptoms also mediated the associations of fatigue with sleep and stress. Depressive symptoms and inflammation were independent risk factors for cancer-related fatigue at 1 year post-radiotherapy, and thus represent independent treatment targets for this debilitating symptom.\n\n[Factors related to subjective fatigue symptoms of adolescent girls].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIkeda, Junko; Fukuda, Sayuri; Murakami, Toshio; Kawamoto, Naoki\n\n2011-09-01\n\nTo assess changes in subjective fatigue symptoms of adolescent girls over a 15-year period and investigate factors related to these symptoms. A total of 86 items on physical health (including subjective fatigue symptoms), dietary life, and daily living were investigated and five items on physical activity were measured for approximately 100 female first-year dietetic students at a junior college each October over the 15-year period from 1994 to 2008. A total of 1,547 students (mean age, 19.2 +/- 0.3 years) were studied. Subjects were first divided into two groups using the median subjective fatigue score as the cutoff point, and annual changes in the proportion of students in the high subjective fatigue group were investigated by simple regression analysis. In addition, relationships between the two subjective fatigue groups and each item were investigated. 1) The proportion of students with many subjective fatigue symptoms showed a significantly increasing trend over the 15-year period. 2) Investigation of relationships between subjective fatigue symptoms and each factor revealed significance for many items, including dietary habits, life satisfaction, amount of sleep, and desire for a positive body image. 3) In order to determine which of the items were most strongly related to subjective fatigue symptoms, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for the 15-year period as well as three 5-year periods into which it was divided. The results showed that the dietary habits score (an indicator of dietary habits) and life satisfaction were related to subjective fatigue symptoms during all four periods. As for other items, relationships were observed for amount of sleep in three, diet and salt intake score in two, and liking for coffee/tea, juice drinks, and oily food, bedtime snack, desire for body image, self-assessment of body type, and health consciousness in one. These findings indicate that perspectives in education for promoting the health of\n\nImplementing factors on finance information systems: How do they influence usage?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDavid Kiwana\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Finance information systems (FISs store and provide timely, accurate and consistent financial data for management and decision-making. Many organizations especially in developing world however fail to attain desired success during implementation and usage of the FISs despite the fact that many success factors for implementation have been suggested. This study thus investigated the usage of FISs with the aim of finding out how factors presumed to influence implementation impact usage. The presumed factors included; top management support, effective communication, evaluation of staff performance, technical support, project management, change management program, effectiveness of IT unit and flexibility of consultants. The study focused on universities in Uganda, which is a developing country. Out of the nine factors that were investigated only top management support, technical training and flexibility of consultants exhibited a positive impact with only top management support being significant. The rest of the factors exhibited negative impact and only effective IT unit being significant.\n\nFactors Influencing Facebook Usage and Facebook Addictive Tendency in University Students: The Role of Online Psychological Privacy and Facebook Usage Motivation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHong, Fu-Yuan; Chiu, Su-Lin\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThere are few studies analysing the influence of personal traits and motivation factors on Facebook usage and Facebook addictive tendency as seen in university students. In this study, 225 Taiwanese university students completed a questionnaire to determine their online psychological privacy scale, Facebook usage motivation scale, Facebook usage scale and Facebook addictive tendency scale, in order to evaluate the items that can be conceptualized as the effect of university students' online psychological privacy personal trait and motive factors, and Facebook usage motivation with respect to Facebook usage and Facebook addictive tendency. The study found that a desire for more online psychological privacy correlates with a stronger motivation to use Facebook and more Facebook usage behaviour among university students who may become high-risk groups for Facebook addictive tendency. The study found that a desire for or an acceptance of a lower online psychological privacy correlates with a stronger motivation to use Facebook among university students who may have more Facebook usage behaviour. This study can help understand university students' Facebook usage and Facebook addictive tendency and provide feature indicators for those who may become high-risk groups for Facebook addictive tendency. Finally, this study conducts discussion and proposes relevant suggestions for future study.

Verifying operability with these settings imposes higher stem loads during periodic inservice testing. These higher test loads increase stresses in the various valve internal parts which may in turn increase the fatigue usage factors. This increased fatigue is judged to be a concern primarily in the valve disks, seats, yokes, stems, and stem nuts. Although the motor operators may also have significantly increased loading, they are being evaluated by the manufacturers and are beyond the scope of this study. Two gate valves representative of both relatively weak and strong valves commonly used in commercial nuclear applications were selected for fatigue analyses. Detailed dimensional and test data were available for both valves from previous studies at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Finite element models were developed to estimate maximum stresses in the internal parts of the valves and to identity the critical areas within the valves where fatigue may be a concern. Loads were estimated using industry standard equations for calculating torque switch settings prior and subsequent to the testing requirements of USNRC Generic Letter 89--10. Test data were used to determine both; (1) the overshoot load between torque switch trip and final seating of the disk during valve closing and (2) the stem thrust required to open the valves. The ranges of peak stresses thus determined were then used to estimate the increase in the fatigue usage factors due to the higher stem thrust loads. The usages that would be accumulated by 100 base cycles plus one or eight test cycles per year over 40 and 60 years of operation were calculated\n\nFatigue cycles evaluation of 500 MWe PHWR coolant channel sealdisc\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChawla, D.S.; Vaze, K.K.; Kushwaha, H.S.; Gupta, K.S.; Bhambra, H.S.\n\n1998-07-01\n\nAt each end of coolant channel there is one sealing plug assembly. The sealdisc is a part of sealing plug assembly. The sealdisc is used to avoid leakage of heavy water. The importance of sealdisc can be understood by the fact that there are 784 sealdiscs in one 500 MWe PHWR unit. During the life time of reactor the sealdisc will be subjected to cyclic loads due to reactor startup, shutdown, power setback and also due to refuelling operations. Excessive reversal of stresses may lead to fatigue failure. The sealdisc failure may cause loss of coolant accidents. Since sealdisc is safety class 1 component, it has to be qualified according to ASME Section III Division 1 NB. For cyclic loads, the fatigue analysis is essential to assess the allowable number of cycles and also to check the total usage factor due to different cyclic loads. To evaluate the allowable fatigue cycles, the analysis is carried out using finite element method. The present report deals with the fatigue cycles evaluation of 500 MWe PHWR sealdisc. The finite element model having eight noded axisymmetric elements is used for the analysis. The various loads considered in the analysis are mechanical loads arising due to refuelling operations and number of temperature-pressure transients. During refuelling, the sealdisc is removed and reinstalled back by use of fuelling machine ram which applies load at centre as well as at rocker point of sealdisc. The stress analysis is carried out for each stage of loading during refuelling and fatigue cycles are evaluated. For temperature transient, decoupled thermal analysis is carried out. At various instants of time, the stresses are computed using temperatures calculated in thermal analysis. The pressure variation is also considered along with temperature variation. The fatigue cycles are evaluated for each transient using maximum alternating stress intensities. The usage factors are calculated for various temperature/pressure transients and refuelling loads\n\nBiopsychosocial risk factors of persistent fatigue after acute infection: A systematic review to inform interventions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHulme, Katrin; Hudson, Joanna L; Rojczyk, Philine; Little, Paul; Moss-Morris, Rona\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFatigue is a prevalent and debilitating symptom, preceded by an acute infectious episode in some patients. This systematic review aimed to identify risk factors for the development of persistent fatigue after an acute infection, to develop an evidence-based working model of post-infectious fatigue. Electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE) were searched, from inception to March 2016, for studies which investigated biopsychosocial risk factors of on-going fatigue after an acute infection. Inclusion criteria were: prospective design; biological, psychological or social risk factors; standardised measure of post-infectious fatigue (self-report scales or clinical diagnosis). Studies were excluded if the sample had a pre-existing medical condition, infection was conceptualised as 'vaccination' or they were intervention trials. A narrative synthesis was performed. Eighty-one full texts were screened, of which seventeen were included in the review. Over half included glandular fever populations. Other infections included dengue fever, 'general'/'viral' and Q-fever. Risk factors were summarised under biological, social, behavioural, cognitive and emotional subthemes. Patients' cognitive and behavioural responses to the acute illness, and pre-infection or baseline distress and fatigue were the most consistent risk factors for post-infectious fatigue. An empirical summary model is provided, highlighting the risk factors most consistently associated with persistent fatigue. The components of the model, the possible interaction of risk factors and implications for understanding the fatigue trajectory and informing preventative treatments are discussed. Copyright Â© 2017.

However, museum fatigue has a negative impact on interest. Museum fatigue has been described as physical tiredness or a decrease in visitors' interest in a museum. The learning experience of students in science centres is also influenced by museum fatigue. The purpose of this study is to identify the phenomena of museum fatigue in science centres and to identity how it is manifested. First, we identified the factors causing museum fatigue in science centres using the data from an open-ended questionnaire which was given to 597 primary, middle and high school students in South Korea. From the responses to the questionnaire, 50 factors causing museum fatigue in science centres were identified. A second Likert-type questionnaire with the 50 factors of museum fatigue in science centres was administered to 610 primary, middle and high school students in South Korea. Using reliability and factor analyses, we developed a framework of the factors causing museum fatigue in science centres, which consists of three contexts, 12 categories and 50 factors. Secondly, through statistical analyses including T test and ANOVA analysis, the features of students' museum fatigue in science centres were analysed and compared regarding student gender, school level, interest in science, grade of school science, the number of visits, and type of visit. The results, which were found to be statistically significant, are reported and discussed. The findings of this study are intended to serve for a deeper understanding and practical improvement of science learning in science centres.\n\nSelf-Reported Fatigue and Associated Factors Six Years after Stroke.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarie Elf\n\nFull Text Available Several studies have found that fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms after stroke and the most difficult to cope with. The present study aimed to investigate the presence and severity of self-reported fatigue six years after stroke onset and associated factors. The cohort \"Life After Stroke Phase I\" (n = 349 persons was invited at six years to report fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale 7-item version, perceived impact of stroke and global recovery after stroke (Stroke Impact Scale, anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, life satisfaction (Life Satisfaction Checklist and participation in everyday social activities (Frenchay Activities Index. At six years 37% of the 102 participants in this cross-sectional study reported fatigue. The results showed that in nearly all SIS domains the odds for post-stroke fatigue were higher in persons with a higher perceived impact. Furthermore, the odds for post-stroke fatigue were higher in those who had experienced a moderate/severe stroke and had signs of depression and anxiety. Fatigue is still present in one-third of persons as long as six years after stroke onset and is perceived to hinder many aspects of functioning in everyday life. There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate interventions to reduce fatigue.\n\nUse of on-line fatigue monitoring of nuclear reactor components as a tool for plant life extension\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStevens, G.L.; Ranganath, S.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nIn this paper the application of an on-line fatigue monitoring system for tracking fatigue usage in operating power plants is described. The system, like several others which have been developed, uses the influence function approach, operates on a microcomputer, and determines component stresses using temperature, pressure, and flow rate data that are typically available from plant computers. Using plant-unique influence functions developed specifically for each component location, the system calculates stresses as a function of time and computes the fatigue usage. Stress values are calculated at time internals defined by the user and the fatigue values are saved on files for use at a later time. The application of the GE Fatigue Monitoring System (GEFMS) to calculate fatigue usage in the feedwater nozzle of a GE boiling Water Reactor is described in this paper\n\nThe Association between Job-Related Psychosocial Factors and Prolonged Fatigue among Industrial Employees in Taiwan.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFeng-Cheng Tang\n\nFull Text Available Prolonged fatigue is common among employees, but the relationship between prolonged fatigue and job-related psychosocial factors is seldom studied. This study aimed (1 to assess the individual relations of physical condition, psychological condition, and job-related psychosocial factors to prolonged fatigue among employees, and (2 to clarify the associations between job-related psychosocial factors and prolonged fatigue using hierarchical regression when demographic characteristics, physical condition, and psychological condition were controlled.A cross-sectional study was employed. A questionnaire was used to obtain information pertaining to demographic characteristics, physical condition (perceived physical health and exercise routine, psychological condition (perceived mental health and psychological distress, job-related psychosocial factors (job demand, job control, and workplace social support, and prolonged fatigue.A total of 3,109 employees were recruited. Using multiple regression with controlled demographic characteristics, psychological condition explained 52.0% of the variance in prolonged fatigue. Physical condition and job-related psychosocial factors had an adjusted R2 of 0.370 and 0.251, respectively. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that, among job-related psychosocial factors, job demand and job control showed significant associations with fatigue.Our findings highlight the role of job demand and job control, in addition to the role of perceived physical health, perceived mental health, and psychological distress, in workers' prolonged fatigue. However, more research is required to verify the causation among all the variables.\n\nFatigue check of nuclear safety class 1 reactor coolant pipe\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang Qing; Fang Yonggang; Chu Qibao; Xu Yu; Li Hailong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFatigue and thermal ratcheting analyses of nuclear safety Class 1 reactor coolant pipe in a nuclear power plant were independently carried out in this paper. The software used for calculation is ROCOCO, which is based on RCC-M code. The difference of nuclear safety Class 1 pipe fatigue evaluation between RCC-M code and ASME code was compared. The main aspects of comparison include the calculation scoping of fatigue design, the calculation method of primary plus secondary stress intensity, the elastic-plastic correction coefficient calculation, and the dynamic load combination method etc. By correcting inconsistent algorithm of ASME code within ROCOCO, the fatigue usage factor and thermal ratcheting design margin of 65 mm and 55 mm wall thickness of the pipe were obtained. The results show that the minimum wall thickness of the pipe must exceed 55 mm and the design value of the thermal ratcheting of 55 mm wall thickness reaches 95% of the allowable value.

Lushkin Alexander\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The main priority of any air company activity and the main condition for its development is the achievement of the highest flight safety level. Significant positive results in this area have been recently achieved, hence, the relative stagna- tion of indexes, reflecting the flight safety as a condition of air transport system, has been revealed. It has become evident that the present accident prevention philosophy seems to be exhausted, and at the current stage of development it doesnât allow to make a breakthrough in the solution of all the problems, which air companies face in this respect. In the perspec- tive to find new ways to solve the existing tasks, in 2011, International Civil Aviation Organization Council adopted fatigue risk management international standards as an alternative for the traditional approach to managing crewmember fatigue by prescribing limits on maximum daily, monthly and yearly flight and duty hours. Itâs a well-known fact that state of fatigue has a special place among the functional states, which are professionally significant for airmen work and which are the key link in âman-aircraft-environmentâ system.In this article, fatigue is considered to be a risk factor that contributes to the formation and development of crew violations and errors in the process of piloting the aircraft. We have analyzed the characteristics and reasons leading to in- flight fatigue and estimated its influence on crew performance, considering the interrelation between them. The article specifies the methods and techniques to measure pilots fatigue; besides it has been substantiated the necessity of fatigue risk management system development in airlines to effectively ensure the flight safety.\n\nRisk factors and visual fatigue of baggage X-ray security screeners: a structural equation modelling analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYu, Rui-Feng; Yang, Lin-Dong; Wu, Xin\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis study identified the risk factors influencing visual fatigue in baggage X-ray security screeners and estimated the strength of correlations between those factors and visual fatigue using structural equation modelling approach. Two hundred and five X-ray security screeners participated in a questionnaire survey. The result showed that satisfaction with the VDT's physical features and the work environment conditions were negatively correlated with the intensity of visual fatigue, whereas job stress and job burnout had direct positive influences. The path coefficient between the image quality of VDT and visual fatigue was not significant. The total effects of job burnout, job stress, the VDT's physical features and the work environment conditions on visual fatigue were 0.471, 0.469, -0.268 and -0.251 respectively. These findings indicated that both extrinsic factors relating to VDT and workplace environment and psychological factors including job burnout and job stress should be considered in the workplace design and work organisation of security screening tasks to reduce screeners' visual fatigue. Practitioner Summary: This study identified the risk factors influencing visual fatigue in baggage X-ray security screeners and estimated the strength of correlations between those factors and visual fatigue. The findings were of great importance to the workplace design and the work organisation of security screening tasks to reduce screeners' visual fatigue.\n\nFatigue in out-patients with inflammatory bowel disease: Prevalence and predictive factors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVilloria, Albert; GarcÃ­a, VÃ­ctor; Dosal, Angelina"
