Based on the Anglo-American system, a two-cycle degree program (Bachelor and Master) has been introduced. Subjects culminating in a state examination, such as Medicine and Dentistry, were excluded from this reform. Since the state examination is already comparable in its caliber to a Master's degree in Medicine or Dentistry, only advanced Master's degree programs with post-graduate specializations come into consideration for these subjects. In the field of dentistry numerous post-graduate study programs are increasingly coming into existence. Many different models and approaches are being pursued. Since the 2004-2005 winter semester, the University of Greifswald has offered the Master's degree program in Dental Functional Analysis and Therapy. Two and a half years in duration, this program is structured to allow program participation while working and targets licensed dentists who wish to attain certified skills for the future in state-of-the-art functional analysis and therapy. The design of this post-graduate program and the initial results of the evaluation by alumni are presented here. Our experiences show that the conceptual idea of an advanced Master's program has proved successful. The program covers a specialty which leads to increased confidence in handling challenging patient cases. The sharing of experiences among colleagues was evaluated as being especially important.\n\nStructural conceptualization of learning experiences in nursing master's degree programs utilized in occupational health nursing activities.\n\nPubMed\n\nAoyama, Wakako; Tatsumi, Asami\n\n2017-01-31\n\nIn this study, concepts were constructed that express learning experiences in nursing master's degree programs utilized in occupational health nursing activities with the aim of clarifying those characteristics. This was based on the idea that elucidation of the characteristics of learning experiences in nursing master's degree programs used in occupational health nursing activities would be meaningful in providing high-quality occupational health services that respond to the needs of society. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 people who fulfilled the three conditions of having completed a master's degree programs, working as an occupational health nurse after completion of the program, and not continuing on to a doctoral program. The nursing conceptualization method of Naomi Funashima was used. From the obtained data, 512 code items expressing learning experiences in master's degree programs utilized in occupational health nursing activities were identified. These items included five core categories (concepts), 34 categories, and 69 subcategories. The five concepts constructed were \"Pursuit of expertise and self-evaluation,\" \"Mutual understanding of various people that leads to human resources utilization,\" \"Theoretical and academic learning that influences changes in activities,\" \"Research learning that lead to activities based on scientific evidence,\" and \"Learning that leads to high-quality activities making use of expertise.\" It was found that various learning experiences in the master's program to pursue the specialty of occupational health nurses in order to recognize their roles as well as the experiences to take the initiative in learning had been integrated in their activities after completion of the course and had contributed to their high-quality occupational health nursing activities. It was suggested that the learning experiences in the master's program, which had been revealed in this study, were the experiences necessary for\n\nStudent-Retention and Career-Placement Rates Between Bachelor's and Master's Degree Professional Athletic Training Programs.\n\nPubMed\n\nBowman, Thomas G; Mazerolle, Stephanie M; Pitney, William A; Dodge, Thomas M; Hertel, Jay\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe debate over what the entry-level degree should be for athletic training has heightened. A comparison of retention and career-placement rates between bachelor's and master's degree professional athletic training programs may inform the debate. To compare the retention rates and career-placement rates of students in bachelor's and master's degree professional programs. Cross-sectional study. Web-based survey. A total of 192 program directors (PDs) from bachelor's degree (n = 177) and master's degree (n = 15) professional programs. The PDs completed a Web-based survey. We instructed the PDs to provide a retention rate and career-placement rate for the students in the programs they lead for each of the past 5 years. We also asked the PDs if they thought retention of students was a problem currently facing athletic training education. We used independent t tests to compare the responses between bachelor's and master's degree professional programs. We found a higher retention rate for professional master's degree students (88.70% Â± 9.02%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.71, 93.69) than bachelor's degree students (80.98% Â± 17.86%, 95% CI = 78.30, 83.66) (t25 = -2.86, P = .008, d = 0.55). Similarly, PDs from professional master's degree programs reported higher career-placement percentages (88.50% Â± 10.68%, 95% CI = 82.33, 94.67) than bachelor's degree professional PDs (71.32% Â± 18.47%, 95% CI = 68.54, 74.10) (t20 = -5.40, P < .001, d = 1.14). Finally, we observed no difference between groups regarding whether retention is a problem facing athletic training (Ï(2)1 = 0.720, P = .40, Î¦ = .061). Professional master's degree education appears to facilitate higher retention rates and greater career-placement rates in athletic training than bachelor's degree education.

ITMO University represented by Applied and Computer Optics Department and Optical Design and Testing Laboratory jointly with Warsaw University of Technology represented by the Institute of Micromechanics and Photonics at The Faculty of Mechatronics have developed a novel international master double-degree program \"Optical Design\" accumulating the expertise of both universities including experienced teaching staff, educational technologies, and experimental resources. The program presents studies targeting research and professional activities in high-tech fields connected with optical and optoelectronics devices, optical engineering, numerical methods and computer technologies. This master program deals with the design of optical systems of various types, assemblies and layouts using computer modeling means; investigation of light distribution phenomena; image modeling and formation; development of optical methods for image analysis and optical metrology including optical testing, materials characterization, NDT and industrial control and monitoring. The goal of this program is training a graduate capable to solve a wide range of research and engineering tasks in optical design and metrology leading to modern manufacturing and innovation. Variability of the program structure provides its flexibility and adoption according to current job market demands and personal learning paths for each student. In addition considerable proportion of internship and research expands practical skills. Some special features of the \"Optical Design\" program which implements the best practices of both Universities, the challenges and lessons learnt during its realization are presented in the paper.\n\nDesigning post-graduate Master's degree programs: the advanced training program in Dental Functional Analysis and Therapy as one example\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRatzmann, Anja; Ruge, Sebastian; Ostendorf, Kristin; KordaÃ, Bernd\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction: The decision to consolidate European higher education was reached by the Bologna Conference.

In 2004, the authors proposed that, by educating medical students in physician leadership and integrating this with a business management or public health degree program, graduates, health care organizations, and communities would benefit sooner. Given the lack of program models to guide program integration and development, the authors began a one-year inquiry to build a model leadership curriculum and integrate leadership education across degree programs. The qualitative inquiry resulted in several linked tasks. First, the authors identified a feasible method for concurrently delivering all three program components (MD degree, Leadership Curriculum, and MBA or MPH degree) during a five-year plan. Second, the authors chose a competency-based educational framework for leadership and then identified, adapted, and validated existing leadership competencies to their context. Third, the authors performed an extensive program alignment to identify existing overlaps and opportunities for integration within and across program components. Fourth, the authors performed a needs analysis to identify educational gaps, subsequently leading to redesigning two courses and to designing three new courses. A description of the Leadership Curriculum is also provided. This inquiry has led to the development of the Boonshoft Physician Leadership Development Program, which provides physician leadership education integrated with medical education and education in business management or public heath. Future program initiatives include developing leadership student assessment tools and testing the link between program activities and short- and long-term outcome measures of program success.\n\n38 CFR 21.7672 - Measurement of courses not leading to a standard college degree.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... not leading to a standard college degree. 21.7672 Section 21.7672 Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (CONTINUED) VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION AND EDUCATION Educational... to a standard college degree.

An associate degree nursing program at a large community college used a three-year grant from the US Department of Labor to create a program to improve retention of nursing students. Seven retention interventions (stipends, learning communities, comprehensive orientation, individualized academic planning, counseling, peer tutoring, and community nurse mentoring) were provided to participants. Correlational analyses were conducted between demographic variables and degree completion and between individual intervention program participation and degree completion. The program produced a statistically significant improvement in retention, but no specific intervention or mixture of interventions was significantly correlated with retention.

A degree in bioethics enhances the care physicians provide to patients and prepares physicians to serve on ethics committees and consult services. Additionally, they may work on institutional and public policy issues related to ethics. Several physician assistant (PA) programs currently offer a master of public health (MPH) dual degree for PAs. A degree in public health prepares PAs for leadership roles in meeting community health needs. With the success of PA/MPH dual degree programs, we argue here that a PA/bioethics dual degree would be another opportunity to advance the PA profession and consider how such a program might be implemented. The article includes the individual perspectives of the authors, one of whom completed a graduate-level certificate in bioethics concurrently with his 2-year PA program, while the other served as a bioethics program director.\n\nMarketing and Retention Strategies for Adult Degree Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrown, Joann A.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFour marketing strategies are critical to the success of adult degree programs: integrating marketing, knowing your students (research), shaping programs and services for adults, and staying the course (retention).\n\nProposed Accreditation Standards for Degree-Granting Correspondence Programs Offered by Accredited Institutions.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMcGraw-Hill Continuing Education Center, Washington, DC.\n\nA study on proposed accreditation standards grew out of a need to (1) stimulate the growth of quality correspondence degree programs; and (2) provide a policy for accreditation of correspondence degree programs so that graduates would be encouraged to pursue advanced degree programs offered elsewhere by educational institutions.

In order to provide information that would facilitate pharmacology curricula to be refined and developed, and approaches to teaching to be updated, a national survey was undertaken in Australia that investigated pharmacology course content, teaching and summative assessment methods. Twenty-two institutions participated in a purpose-built online questionnaire, which enabled an evaluation of 147 courses taught in 10 different degrees. To enable comparison, degrees were grouped into four major degree programs, namely science, pharmacy, medicine and nursing. The pharmacology content was then classified into 16 lecture themes, with 2-21 lecture topics identified per theme. The resultant data were analysed for similarities and differences in pharmacology curricula across the degree programs. While all lecture themes were taught across degree programs, curriculum content differed with respect to the breadth and hours of coverage. Overall, lecture themes were taught most broadly in medicine and with greatest coverage in pharmacy. Reflecting a more traditional approach, lectures were a dominant teaching method (at least 90% of courses). Sixty-three percent of science courses provided practical classes but such sessions occurred much less frequently in other degree programs, while tutorials were much more common in pharmacy degree programs (70%). Notably, problem-based learning was common across medical programs. Considerable diversity was found in the types of summative assessment tasks employed. In science courses the most common form of in-semester assessment was practical reports, whereas in other programs pen-and-paper quizzes predominated. End-of-semester assessment contributed 50-80% to overall assessment across degree programs. The similarity in lecture themes taught across the four different degree programs shows that common knowledge- and competency-based learning\n\nEnterpreneurship/Small Business Degree Programs at Community Colleges\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMaidment, Fred\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAssociate degree programs at community colleges in small business/entrepreneurship were examined in this article.

Based upon the findings from those conferences, several initiatives emerged that support RTs earning a baccalaureate (or bachelor's) degree. The objective of this study was to identify the ways that associate degree programs communicate career pathways toward a baccalaureate degree through their Web sites. This cross-sectional observational study used a random sample of 100 of the 362 associate degree programs approved by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care. Data were collected from 3 specific categories: demographic data, baccalaureate completion information, and the Web page location for the program. The presence of statements related to any pathway toward a bachelor's degree, transfer credits, articulation agreements, and links for baccalaureate completion were recorded. The descriptive statistics in this study were reported as total numbers and percentages. Of the 100 programs in the random sample, only 89 were included in the study. Only 39 (44%) programs had links on their program Web site that had any content related to bachelor's degrees, 16 (18%) identified college transfer courses toward a bachelor's degree, and 26 (29%) programs included baccalaureate articulation agreements on their Web site. A minority of associate degree programs communicated career pathway information to their prospective and current students through program Web sites. An informative Web site would make the path more transparent for entry-level students to meet their future educational needs as their careers progress.

Based on a perceived and documented need, a collaborative education and research program was established with George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, to begin building a community of new scholars to assist in the advancement of professional nursing in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Four cohorts of Saudi citizens from three institutions (King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Saudi Arabia National Guard Hospital, and Ministry of Aviation and Defense Hospital), who held a degree in science or a related field, were enrolled in an accelerated baccalaureate program leading to a bachelor of science in nursing degree. This project was funded by Saudi Arabian sources. A descriptive research study was conducted to identify predictors of success in the program. Results indicated a rate of program completion that was higher than expected. Some of the first graduates went on for a doctor of philosophy degree, but not all enrolled completed the program. Many countries around the world are seeking ways to upgrade and increase the supply of qualified nurses within their own borders. This study identified those factors that were predictors of success for Saudi Arabian students who completed a baccalaureate degree in nursing program in the United States.\n\nStudent retention practices in associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolt, Marianne P\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe main purpose of this study was to investigate student retention strategies and practices implemented in associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs. Included are student attrition issues, academic standards, re-entry policies, and clinical remediation strategies. A survey consisting of forced choice and open-ended questions was mailed to 31 randomly selected associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs. Surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics and frequency distributions. Open-ended questions were analyzed using the constant comparative qualitative method to identify recurring themes. There was an 80% (n=25) return response to the survey. The findings of this study determined that dental hygiene programs are graduating, on average, a higher percentage (83%) of students when compared to two-year, associate degree programs in general (46%). The primary reasons reported by respondents for student attrition included: academic difficulties (88%), dissatisfaction with career choice (76%), family/personal responsibilities (72%), and clinical skill difficulties (56%). A wide variety of retention strategies were reported. Those most often cited were academic remediation (92%), clinical skill development/remediation (84%), academic advising (84%), financial aid assistance (84%), and tutoring (80%). Participating programs also reported setting high academic and ethical standards. Specific criteria for student re-entry were discussed. The findings of this study suggest that associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs are committed to student retention and make considerable efforts to help students succeed. Student retention efforts could be enhanced for those student groups identified as possibly being at high risk for attrition. The findings and recommendations in this investigation may assist associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs in their efforts to retain a higher percentage of students.\n\nHuman Service Administrator Perceptions of Online MSW Degree Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCurran, Laura; Sanchez Mayers, Ray; Fulghum, Fontaine\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOnline programs have proliferated rapidly in higher education, and this reality holds true for social work education as well.

R.; Manduca, C. A.; Larsen, K.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nOver the decade 2002-12, the percentage of students from underrepresented minorities (URM) graduating with geoscience degrees has increased by 50%. In 2012, of the nearly 6,000 geoscience Bachelor's degrees, 8% were awarded to students from URM. But that same year across all of STEM, 18% of Bachelors went to these students, and URM made up 30% of the US population overall. Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) play an important role in increasing the diversity of geoscience graduates where there are appropriate degree programs or pathways to programs. To better understand opportunities at these institutions, the InTeGrate project collected information on degree programs at MSIs. A summer 2013 survey of websites for three types of MSIs confirmed that, while stand-alone Geology, Geoscience, or Environmental Science departments are present, there are a larger number of degree programs that include elements of geoscience or related disciplines (geography, GIS, etc.) offered in interdisciplinary departments (e.g. Natural Sciences and Math) or cognate science departments (Physics, Engineering, etc.). Approximately one-third of Hispanic Serving Institutions and Tribal Colleges and one-fifth of Historically Black Colleges and Universities offer at least one degree that includes elements of geoscience. The most common programs were Geology and Environmental Science (94 and 88 degrees respectively), but 21 other types of program were also found. To better profile the nature of these programs, 11 interviews were conducted focusing on strategies for attracting, supporting, and preparing minority students for the workforce. In conjunction with the February 2014 Broadening Access to the Earth and Environmental Sciences workshop, an additional 6 MSI profiles were obtained as well as 22 profiles from non-MSIs. Several common strategies emerge: Proactive marketing and outreach to local high schools and two-year colleges Community building, mentoring and advising, academic support\n\nThe Doctor of Philosophy Degree.

Learning experiences, assessment methods, and baccalaureate institutional partnerships were assessed. Of the sixty dental hygiene programs that offer a degree completion program, the forty-two that met the inclusion criteria (including having operated for at least three years) were invited to participate in a thirty-eight item online survey. A 62 percent (n=26) response rate was obtained. Learning experiences in responding programs included core dental hygiene courses, general education courses, and elective dental hygiene courses. Emphasis areas offered by various programs were in the specialty areas of education, public or community health, and research. Respondents reported that their graduates were employed in multiple settings (65 percent; n=17), with 19 percent (n=5) reporting employment in the combined grouping of private practice, education, and public health. Institutional partnerships included articulation agreements (88 percent; n=21), community college baccalaureate (8 percent; n=2), and university extension (4 percent; n=1) models. The findings of this study provide a baseline for assessing the educational composition and design of U.S. dental hygiene degree completion programs. However, results of this study showed inconsistencies among learning experiences that might raise concerns when considering students' level of preparation for graduate education and future leadership roles in the profession.\n\nCompetencies for Graduate Culinary Management Degree Programs: Stakeholders' Perspectives\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGeorge, Annette A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAvailable literature on graduate hospitality education was highly focused on required competencies for hospitality management degree programs but not on culinary management.

As a result of the evolving change and increasing complexity, a more educated nursing workforce is needed (Dracup K. Master's nursing programs. American Association of Colleges of Nursing. 2015; Institute of Medicine. The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health. 2010). It is now becoming necessary for registered nurses to earn an advanced degree to work at the highest level of their practice authority (Dracup K. Master's nursing programs. American Association of Colleges of Nursing. 2015; Institute of Medicine. The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health. 2010.). Preparing to reenter college may be an overwhelming prospect for some registered nurses seeking an advanced degree. However, there are some simple strategies that may help sort out the many degree options, financial obligations, decisions about brick and mortar versus online learning, commitment to degree completion, and changing career paths.

The Bachelor of Science degree program in Astronautics combines basic science and engineering classes with specialized astronautics classes. The Master of Science degree program in Astronautics offers classes in various areas of space technology. The Certificate in Astronautics targets practicing engineers and scientists who enter space-related fields and/or who want to obtain training in specific space-related areas. Many specialized graduate classes are taught by adjunct faculty working at the leading space companies. The Master of Science degree and Certificate are available through the USC Distance Education Network (DEN). Today, the Internet allows us to reach students anywhere in the world through webcasting. The majority of our graduate students, as well as those pursuing the Certificate, work full time as engineers in the space industry and government research and development centers. The new world of distance learning presents new challenges and opens new opportunities. We show how the transformation of distance learning and particularly the introduction of webcasting transform organization of the program and class delivery. We will describe in detail the academic focus of the program, student reach, and structure of program components.

Cross-sectional descriptive study. Course descriptions available for online access during June and July of 2012 were reviewed for the 114 centers in Spain that offer a nursing degree, according to the official Registry of Universities, Centers, and Titles. Of the 114 centers with degree programs, 95 (83.3%) post course content online, which make it possible to analyze 2,258 courses. In 60 (63.1%) of these centers, none of the courses included the concept of pressure ulcer prevention, and the course content posted by 36 (37.9%) centers made no mention of their treatment. None of the course descriptions contained any reference to pain management in patients with chronic wounds. Of the 728 elective courses analyzed, only one was related to chronic wounds. This review of available information about nursing degree programs in Spain indicates that pain management in patients with chronic wounds is not addressed in any course, and more courses consider the treatment of pressure ulcers than their prevention. Degree programs responsible for the training of future nurses should be reviewed and revised as needed to ensure that graduates have acquired minimum basic competencies in the prevention and treatment of chronic wounds that help to decrease the theory-practice gap in this field.

To describe the status of diagnostic and procedural imaging curricula within United States physical therapist professional degree programs. As patient direct access to physical therapy services increases, the ability to refer patients directly for diagnostic imaging could promote more efficient delivery of care. Appropriate patient referral is contingent on physical therapists having the requisite knowledge base and skills. While evidence describing imaging competence of physical therapists with advanced training in military institutions exists, evidence is lacking for other physical therapists, including new graduates of physical therapist professional degree programs. Faculty members teaching imaging at 206 United States physical therapist professional degree programs recognized by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education were recruited via e-mail correspondence. An e-mail attachment included the survey on which faculty reported imaging curricula and faculty qualifications, attitudes, and experiences. Faculty from 155 (75.2%) programs responded to the survey, with imaging being included in the curriculum of 152 programs. Content was integrated by required standalone courses or clinical science track courses, and/or through elective courses. The average reported estimate of imaging contact hours was 24.4 hours (range, 2-75 hours). Emphasis was on the musculoskeletal system, including 76.3% of the required standalone course content. Student competence was assessed in 147 (96.7%) programs, primarily by written (66.7%) and practical (19.7%) examinations. Faculty rated student competence on a scale of 1 (not competent) to 5 (competent), with ratings ranging from a high of 4.0 (identifying normal anatomy on plain-film radiography) to a low of 1.9 (identifying common tissue pathological processes/injuries on ultrasound).

Unfortunately, this phenomenon is largely unexplored in Italy. An observational study was conducted at the University of Pavia, with the aim to investigate the reasons underpinning the students' choice to enter a Nursing Degree Program. A semi-structured, self-administrated questionnaire was used for this single-center cross-sectional study. The questionnaire was aimed to investigate the reasons underpinning the students' choice to enter a Nursing Degree Program, using both open-ended and close-ended multiple choice questions. Descriptive statistics have been used to describe collected data. Open-ended response analysis was conducted through an exploratory and qualitative analysis of language. Response rate was 71% (196/275). Our study results highlighted a variety of reasons that encourage students to begin a Nursing Degree Program: the feeling of usefulness (80%), the desire to help and to care people (78%), the interest in the sciences (71%), the compassion to the suffering people (66%). We also identified 4 categories that describe which characteristics a nurse should have according to the students' point of view: expertise; personal characteristics; to experience the professional life as a social function and to have interest in the health field. Students' answers indicate that often the choice to enter a Nursing Degree Program is not supported by clear ideas and strong motivations. We consider it crucial to provide a realistic image of the nursing role and opportunities for career development, so that students can have the right elements to make a conscious choice. There is a need for more qualitative research to explore the reasons why students choose the Nursing Degree Program; moreover, to identify, from the beginning of the course, those students who are in crisis of motivation, in order to adopt support strategies that could\n\nJoint MS Degree Program between the Korea University of Technology and Education and the University of Kansas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDougherty, R.

Issues addressed during the development of this Joint MS Program included: joint versus dual degrees, institutional acceptance of the transfer of fifteen hours of credit for an MS degree, different admissions requirements and procedures for the two institutions, financial support of the students, faculty advisors at each institution, Graduate Directors at each institution, transcript acknowledgement of the Joint Degree, residency requirements, English speaking requirements/abilities, thesis publication allowances/requirements, and time zone differences for virtual meetings. These issues have been addressed, and the Joint MS Degree Program is functioning with a small number of students having taken advantage of the opportunity since the Programâ s inception. Future considerations are: growing the number of students in the Program, expansion to other Departments besides KU-Mechanical Engineering and KUTMechatronics, including other universities in the Program, expansion to a Joint PhD Degree Program, and stronger funding resources.\n\nPreparation of the Professional Athletic Trainer: A Descriptive Study of Undergraduate and Graduate Degree Programs.\n\nPubMed\n\nCavallario, Julie M; Van Lunen, Bonnie L\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe examination of the appropriate professional degree for preparation as an athletic trainer is of interest to the profession. Descriptive information concerning universal outcomes is needed to understand the effect of a degree change. To obtain and compare descriptive information related to professional athletic training programs and a potential degree change and to determine if any of these factors contribute to success on existing universal outcome measures. Cross-sectional study. Web-based survey. We contacted 364 program directors; 178 (48.9%; 163 undergraduate, 15 postbaccalaureate) responded. The survey consisted of 46 questions: 45 questions that dealt with 5 themes (institutional demographics [n = 13], program admissions [n = 6], program outcomes [n = 10], program design [n = 9], faculty and staff [n = 7]) and 1 optional question. Descriptive statistics for all programs were calculated. We compared undergraduate and postbaccalaureate programs by examining universal outcome variables. Descriptive statistics demonstrated that 33 programs could not support postbaccalaureate degrees, and a substantial loss of faculty could occur if the degree requirement changed (553 graduate assistants, 642 potentially underqualified instructors). Postbaccalaureate professional programs had higher 2011-2012 first-time Board of Certification (BOC) passing rates (U = 464.5, P = .001), 3-year aggregate first-time BOC passing rates (U = 451.5, P = .001), and employment rates for 2011-2012 graduates employed within athletic training (U = 614.0, P = .01). Linear multiple-regression models demonstrated that program and institution type contributed to the variance of the first-time BOC passing rates and the 3-year aggregate first-time BOC passing rates (P < .05). Students in postbaccalaureate athletic training programs performed better in universal outcome measures. Our data supported the concerns that this transition could result in the loss of some programs and an additional\n\nUsing \"Kaizen\" to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEmiliani, M.

The first Meeting of the Forum of University Teaching Staff in Pharmacy Degrees was held at the Faculty of Medicine in the Complutense University, Madrid, Spain on the 19(th) and 20(th) of November 2013. The meeting was attended by 17 lecturers. Participants brought their own teaching programs and were given two previous studies on public health competencies for analysis of public health contents and competencies in pharmacy degrees. Working groups were formed and the results were shared. The highest number of core competencies was identified in the following functions: \"Assessment of the population's health needs\" and \"Developing health policies\". The final program included basic contents organized into 8 units: Concept of Public Health, Demography, Epidemiological Method, Environment and Health, Food Safety, Epidemiology of Major Health Problems, Health Promotion and Education, and Health Planning and Management. Representation of almost all the Spanish Pharmacy Faculties and the consensus reached in the description of competences and program contents will greatly improve the quality of teaching in this area.

Management and leadership positions in federal and state healthcare agencies, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, retail pharmacies, academia and managed care organizations increasingly require the pharmaceutical knowledge obtained through a doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) degree combined with financial, organizational, and management skills. In these innovative positions, pharmacists are being called upon to assume responsibilities as executives and administrators in systems providing pharmacist care services to patients. To endow students with knowledge and skills required to perform the duties required in these decision-making positions, the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy has established 3 joint degree programs: the PharmD/Master of Business Administration (PharmD/MBA), PharmD/Master of Public Administration (PharmD/MPA), and PharmD/Master of Science in Economics (PharmD/MS). This paper describes these joint degree programs.

It is part of a folio of maps of the Richfield 1Â° x 2Â° quadrangle, Utah, prepared under the Conterminuous United States Mineral Assessment Program. Other published geochemical maps in this folio are listed in the references (this publication). The Richfield quadrangle is located in west-central Utah and includes the eastern part of the Pioche-Marysvale igneous and mineral belt, which extends from the vicinity of Pioche in southeastern Nevada, east-northeastward for 155 miles into central Utah. The western two-thirds of the Richfield quadrangle is part of the Basin and Range province, whereas the eastern third is part of the High Plateaus of Utah, a subprovince of the Colorado Plateau. Bedrock in the northern part of the Richfield quadrangle consists predominantly of Late Proterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary strata that were thrust eastward during the Sevier orogeny in Cretaceous time onto an autochthon of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks located in the eastern part of the quadrangle. The southern part of the quadrangle is largely underlain by Oligocene and younger volcanic rocks and related intrusions. Extensional tectonism in late Cenozoic time broke the bedrock terrain into a series of north-trending fault blocks; the uplifted mountain areas were eroded to various degrees and the resulting debris was deposited in adjacent basins. Most of the mineral deposits in the Pioche-Marysvale mineral belt were formed as a result of igneous activity in the middle and late Cenozoic time. A more complete description of the geology and a mineral-resource appraisal of the Richfield quadrangle appears in Steven and Morris (1984 and 1987). The regional sampling program was designed to define broad geochemical patterns and trends that can be utilized along with geological and geophysical data to assess the mineral\n\nDiversity of Graduates from Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral Degree Neuroscience Programs in the United States.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamos, Raddy L; AlviÃ±a, Karina; Martinez, Luis R\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe demography of United States graduates from science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) degree programs is well-understood; however, data particularly describing the gender and ethnic diversity of graduates of neuroscience programs has not been analyzed, limiting our knowledge of specific areas where diversity and fair representation are lacking. Using over 30 years of data from the National Center for Education Statistics, we documented the demography of neuroscience graduates from bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs. Recent graduation trends indicate greater numbers of female graduates from bachelor's and graduate degree programs. White (non-Hispanic) males and females represent the largest group of graduates while Asian/Pacific Islanders represent the largest non-White group of graduates. Although the number of underrepresented minorities graduating from neuroscience degree programs at every level has increased in recent years, they still lag compared to White (non-Hispanic) and Asian/Pacific Islanders. These data provide valuable information that can be used to promote greater diversity among neuroscience graduates by higher education faculty and administrators and federal funding agencies.\n\nLaw-Based Degree Programs in Business and Their Departments: What's in a Name?

To help fill this growing demand, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) aims to offer a unique pre-pharmacy degree program and has developed a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences to help achieve this goal. In this commentary, we share our experience with our curriculum and highlight its features in an effort to encourage other institutions to enhance the learning experience of their pre-pharmacy students. The efforts of the UCI Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences has resulted in UCI being consistently ranked as one of the top feeder institutions by the Pharmacy College Application Service (PharmCAS) in recent years. The UCI Pharmaceutical Sciences Bachelor of Science offers a unique pre-pharmacy educational experience in an effort to better prepare undergraduates for the rigors of the doctorate of pharmacy curriculum.

Despite this growth there is little information or direction from the physical therapy education accreditation body or professional association to guide academic programs on the interest or necessity of this type of practice content in physical therapy professional degree programs. The purpose of this survey study is to report on the prevalence, attitudes, barriers, resources, and faculty expertise in providing required or elective sports physical therapy course work. Cross-sectional descriptive survey. A 57-item questionnaire with branching logic was distributed via a web-based electronic data capture tool to survey all Commission on Accreditation for Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) accredited and candidate schools in the United States. Response data was analyzed to describe typical educational program profiles, faculty demographics, and correlational factors consistent with the presence or absence of specific sports physical therapy curricular content. Thirty one percent of the schools responded to the survey and the program demographics were consistent with all currently accredited schools in regards to their geography, Carnegie classification, and faculty and student size. Forty three percent of programs offered a required or elective course distinct to the practice of sports physical therapy. Descriptive information regarding the sequencing, curricular make-up, resources, and assessment of content competence is reported. The odds of providing this content nearly doubles for programs that have faculty with sports clinical specialist credentials, accredited sports residency curriculums, or state practice acts that allow sports venue coverage. This survey provides an initial overview of sports physical therapy educational efforts in professional physical therapy degree programs. The data can used to spur further discussion on the necessity, structure, and\n\nTransnational Degree Program Franchising and the Challenge of Commercial Franchisees\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJuusola, Katariina; Rensimer, Lee\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the interrelationship of branding practices and legitimacy-building of commercial degree program franchising within transnational higher education (TNHE).

This is unfortunate because many university graduates who are interested specifically in biomedical rather than pure science fields need further education before making decisions on whether to enter clinical, research, education, or business careers. Training for these students is done best in a medical school, rather than a graduate university, environment and by faculty who are engaged in research in the biomedical sciences. Students benefit from these programs by exploring career options they might not have previously considered while learning about disease-related subjects at the graduate level. Graduate faculty can also benefit by being compensated for their teaching with a portion of the tuition revenue, funds that can help run their laboratories and support other academic expenses. Faculty also may attract talented students to their labs and to their PhD programs by exposing them to a passion for research. The graduate school also benefits by collecting masters tuition revenue that can be used toward supporting PhD stipends. Six-year outcome data from the program at Newark show that, on completion of the program, most students enter educational, clinical, or research careers and that the graduate school has established a new and significant stream of revenue. Thus, the establishment of a master's program in biomedical sciences that helps students match their academic abilities with their career goals significantly benefits students as well as the graduate school and its faculty.\n\nThird Space Strategists: International Students Negotiating the Transition from Pathway Program to Postgraduate Coursework Degree\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBenzie, Helen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPathway programs exist to prepare students for progression into university degrees but the transition experience for many students may not be as smooth as is suggested by the notion of the pathway.

We attempted to assess the effectiveness of this program based on data available from children screening and follow-up. Indicators of effectiveness included the evolution of blood lead levels at screening and the frequency of secondary increases in blood lead levels. Buildings inclusion dates were used to control for the increasing selection of less exposed children. A total of 3,660 children were screened between 1992 and 2000. We observed a regular decrease in blood lead levels at screening, in the highest blood lead levels obtained for each child and in the proportion of children whose blood lead levels increased after screening: the proportion of children with initial blood lead levels >=15 micro g/dl fell from 17.4% in the 1992-1996 period to 4.1% in the 1997-2000 period. A multivariate analysis taking into account the first year that children were screened in a given building showed that less exposed children were included over time, but found also an additional independent decrease in blood lead levels that can be related to the effectiveness of prevention efforts. A \"building by building\" analysis of 30 buildings where more than 20 children were located over the whole study period confirmed that the incidence of lead poisoning decreased within most of these buildings. Taking into account buildings'inclusion dates makes it possible to distinguish program effectiveness from the consequences of including less exposed children The effectiveness of preventive actions is associated with several interacting factors, including the participation of families and the active involvement of local technical s"
