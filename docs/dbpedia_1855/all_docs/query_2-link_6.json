        "text": "Version 2020-1 Updates: 1) chronological divisions - Pre-Historic Old Arabic 2) broken plurals and agreement 3) mythologies of Arabic 4) sound changes, Old Higazi and Tamimi 5) new texts 6) some typos removed, new ones surely generated. I first compiled this manual in 2014 to teach the Historical Grammar of Arabic at the Leiden Linguistics Summer School. I have since continued to update it with new material and insights, and have used various iterations to teach my classes at Leiden University and again at the Leiden Linguistics Summer School, the second time with Dr. Marijn van Putten. The book as it stands now is incomplete; future iterations will cover subjects not treated here, such as the plurals, the morphology of the infinitives and participles, and syntax. The bibliography is not fully formatted and the appendix of texts contains mostly Old Arabic inscriptions but will soon be expanded to include texts from all periods. This text has not been copy edited so please forgive any typos and other infelicities. It is my intention to keep this book open access and free for all to use for research purposes and instruction. Please feel free to cite this text but be sure to include the version number. I will archive the versions at H-Commons so that previous versions are available even though the main text will continue to be updated. Visit my academida.edu (https://leidenuniv.academia.edu/AhmadAlJallad) page to comment a permanent “session”. Users are encouraged to send me suggestions and improvements to better the overall text; I will acknowledge these contributions in the notes. I would like to thank Marijn van Putten for his corrections on this draft while using this manual in his courses and privately.\n\nOn March 5-6, 1993, the Seventh Annual Symposium on Arabic Linguistics was held at the University of Texas at Austin. The symposium was sponsored by the Arabic Linguistic Society, The University of Texas College of Liberal Arts, its Middle East Center, and its Departments of Linguistics and Oriental and African Languages and Literatures, and by the University of Utah's College of Humanities and the Department of Languages and Literature. A total of eighteen papers were presented at the symposium; of these, eight are published in this volume. Two other papers (Safi & Broselow et. al) were presented at the Eighth Annual Symposium but are included here for thematic reasons. The papers presented at the symposium were selected on the basis of an anonymous review of abstracts submitted to the Program Committee. The papers included in the volume were further reviewed by the editor before their final acceptance for publication.\n\nINTRODUCTION The Arabic language developed through the early centuries in the Arabian Peninsula in the era immediately preceding the appearance of Islam, when it acquired the form in which it is known today. Arab poets of the pre-Islamic period had developed a language of amazing richness and flexibility. For the most part, their poetry was transmitted and preserved orally. The Arabic language was then, as it is now, easily capable of creating new words and terminology in order to adapt to the demand of new scientific and artistic discoveries. As the new believers in the seventh century spread out from the Peninsula to create a vast empire, first with its capital in Damascus and later in Baghdad, Arabic became the administrative language of vast section of the Mediterranean world. It drew upon Byzantine and Persian terms and its own immense inner resources of vocabulary and grammatical flexibility."
