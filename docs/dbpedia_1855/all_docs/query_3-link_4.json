The purpose of this study was to compare potential predictors of NCLEX outcomes in graduates of first-degree accelerated (FDA; n=62) and second-degree accelerated (SDA; n=173) BSN programs sharing a common nursing curriculum. In this retrospective study, bivariate analyses and multiple logistic regression assessed significance of selected demographic and academic characteristics as predictors of NCLEX-RN outcomes. FDA graduates were more likely than SDA graduates to fail the NCLEX-RN (P=.0013). FDA graduates were more likely to speak English as a second or additional language (P<.0001), have lower end-of-program GPA and HESI Exit Exam scores (both P<.0001), and have a higher proportions of grades â¤ C (P=.0023). All four variables were significant predictors of NCLEX-RN outcomes within both FDA and SDA programs. The only significant predictors in adjusted logistic regression of NCLEX-RN outcome for the pooled FDA+SDA graduate sample were proportion of grades â¤ C (a predictor of NCLEX-RN failure) and HESI Exit Exam score (a predictor of passing NCLEX-RN). Grades of C or lower on any course may indicate inadequate mastery of critical NCLEX-RN content and increased risk of NCLEX-RN failure. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Scholars have described students and programs, but research examining the faculty experience is limited. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences and emotions of faculty teaching students in ASBSN programs. Using a descriptive qualitative survey design, faculty (N = 138) from 25 randomly selected programs in 11 midwestern states were surveyed using an instrument developed for this study and distributed online. Ten themes emerged, including (a) Engaging With Motivated, Mature, and Diverse Students, (b) Students Choosing Nursing for the \"Wrong Reasons,\" (c) Too Much Work, Too Little Time for Students and Faculty, (d) Amazement, (e) Pride, and (f) Frustration. These findings will help novice and seasoned ASBSN faculty interpret their experiences, strengthen precepting and mentoring activities, and support administrators in determining staffing plans and designing ASBSN programs.

Based on a perceived and documented need, a collaborative education and research program was established with George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, to begin building a community of new scholars to assist in the advancement of professional nursing in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Four cohorts of Saudi citizens from three institutions (King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Saudi Arabia National Guard Hospital, and Ministry of Aviation and Defense Hospital), who held a degree in science or a related field, were enrolled in an accelerated baccalaureate program leading to a bachelor of science in nursing degree. This project was funded by Saudi Arabian sources. A descriptive research study was conducted to identify predictors of success in the program. Results indicated a rate of program completion that was higher than expected. Some of the first graduates went on for a doctor of philosophy degree, but not all enrolled completed the program. Many countries around the world are seeking ways to upgrade and increase the supply of qualified nurses within their own borders. This study identified those factors that were predictors of success for Saudi Arabian students who completed a baccalaureate degree in nursing program in the United States.\n\nFaculty to faculty: advice for educators new to teaching in accelerated second baccalaureate degree nursing programs.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoellaard, Melissa R; Brandt, Cheryl L; Zorn, CeCelia R\n\n2015-06-01\n\nDespite a growing faculty shortage, accelerated second baccalaureate degree nursing programs (ASBSN) proliferate. To prepare faculty for this teaching role, guide their development, and enhance recruitment and retention, ASBSN faculty in this descriptive study offered advice to new ASBSN educators. Data were collected online from ASBSN faculty (N = 93) across the midwestern United States. Six themes emerged: (a) Plan for Program Intensity That Stresses Students and Faculty, (b) Be Available, Flexible, Open-Minded, and Patient, (c) Uphold Early-Established Expectations and Rigorous Standards, (d) Be Prepared for Challenging Questions: Know Your Material and Be Organized, (e) Integrate Students' Diversity Into Teaching and Learning, and (f) Adapt Content and Teaching Strategies to Align With Student and Program Characteristics. Consistency with the Suplee and Gardner new faculty orientation model was explored. Respondents viewed new ASBSN faculty as active agents who can influence their own effectiveness and success.

This study examined the relationships among self-esteem, motivation, learning strategies, demographic characteristics, and academic achievement. The results indicated that all of the students had good self-esteem; some demographic characteristics influenced the type of motivation and learning strategies they endorsed but did not influence their current academic performance.\n\nGreat expectations: points of congruencies and discrepancies between incoming accelerated second-degree nursing students and faculty.\n\nPubMed\n\nD'Antonio, Patricia; Beal, Margaret W; Underwood, Patricia W; Ward, Frances Rieth; McKelvey, Michele; Guthrie, Barbara; Lindell, Deborah\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThis study analyzes the expectations that incoming students and faculty bring to accelerated pre-licensure education programs for second-degree students. Although research supports the congruence of expectations between students and faculty as essential to learning, anecdotal evidence and single case reports suggest there may be important discrepancies in expectations of second-degree students and their faculty. Data are intended to support curriculum review, refinement, and innovation in these programs.

The applicant pool is approximately three to four times larger now than in the earlier years, with classes averaging 50 students. Academic qualifications (high-school class rank and Scholastic Aptitude Test and College Board Achievement Test results) of the entering classes have been at a consistently high level. Fifty percent or more of the graduates receive the BA degree with honors; 10% or more receive the MD degree with honors. The degree of flexibility in the liberal arts component of the program has increased and currently exceeds that of the traditional four-year premedical curriculum. These data, together with additional information concerning postgraduate professional activities, indicate that the combined accelerated program has been successful.\n\nUsing student satisfaction data to evaluate a new online accelerated nursing education program.\n\nPubMed\n\nGazza, Elizabeth A; Matthias, April\n\n2016-10-01\n\nAs increasing numbers of students enroll in online education, institutions of higher education are responsible for delivering quality online courses and programs. Agencies that accredit institutions and programs require evidence of program quality, including student satisfaction. A large state university in the Southeastern United States transitioned an online nursing education degree completion, or Registered Nurse-to-Bachelor of Science in Nursing, program to an online accelerated format in order to meet the needs of working nurses and ultimately, increase the number of nurses prepared at the baccalaureate level. This article describes a descriptive, cross-sectional study that evaluated the effectiveness of the new online accelerated program using the quality indicator of student satisfaction. Ninety-one (32%) of the 284 students who were enrolled or had been enrolled in a course within the online accelerated degree completion program between fall 2013 session 1 and summer 2014 session participated in the study. The electronic Noel-Levitz Priorities Survey for Online Learnersâ¢ was used to measure student satisfaction with the program and associated services. Results provided insight into the students' satisfaction with the new program format and served as the basis for an interdepartmental program enhancement plan aimed at maintaining and enhancing student satisfaction and overall program quality. Findings indicated that measuring and evaluating student satisfaction can provide valuable information about the effectiveness of an online program. Recommendations for using the measurement tool in online program planning and studying student satisfaction in relation to retention and program completion were identified.

Many authors propose that CT in nursing should be viewed as a developmental process that increases as students' experiences with it change. However, there is a dearth of literature that describes basic-BSN and ASD students' CT skills from an evolutionary perspective. The study design was exploratory descriptive. The results indicated thatASD students had higher CT scores on a quantitative critical thinking assessment at program entry than basic-BSN students. CT data are needed across the nursing curriculum from basic-BSN and ASD students in order for nurse educators to develop cohort-specific pedagogical approaches that facilitate critical thinking in nursing and produce nurses with good CT skills for the future.\n\nCharacteristics and Postsecondary Pathways of Students Who Participate in Acceleration Programs in Minnesota.

These programs are designed to educate students with prior degrees in increasingly shorter periods of time than they have traditionally been educated. As a result, nurse educators and administrators in these programs need to tailor their approaches to best meet the educational needs of this unique cohort. This qualitative study sought to elicit best practices from nursing faculty across the United States. Previous investigators primarily examined a limited number of programs from the same region. In this study, a roughly equal number of participants experienced in teaching ASD students from across the United States were recruited. Initially focus groups were conducted to form a semistructured interview guideline, which was then was used to guide participant interviews. Results of the interview data were analyzed using standard qualitative research techniques of concept analyses. Themes that emerged were (a) extreme organization, (b) engage students through active listening, (c) mutual respect, (d) engage via life/work experience, (e) effective pedagogy adaptations, and (f) early immersion. The specifics of these themes will be useful in guiding faculty and program directors involved with ASD nursing students.

This work focuses on four aspects of the curriculum and course development and evaluation research. First, the context of, and impetus for, what was formerly called vocational education, now referred to as technical or workforce education, is provided. Second, the research that was undertaken to design and evaluate an associate degree-level STEM workforce education program is described. Third, the adaptation of a student self-assessment of learning gains instrument is reviewed, and an analysis of the resulting data using an adapted logic model is provided, to evaluate the extent to which instructional approaches, in two process control/improvement-focused courses, were effective in meeting course-level intended learning outcomes. Finally, eight integrative multiscale exercises were designed from two example process systems, wastewater treatment and fast pyrolysis. The integrative exercises are intended for use as tools to accelerate the formation of an operator-technician's multiscale vision of systems, unit operations, underlying processes, and fundamental reactions relevant to multiple industries. Community and technical colleges serve a vital function in STEM education by training workers for medium- and high-skilled technical careers and providing employers the labor necessary to operate and maintain thriving business ventures. Through development of the curricular, course, and assessment-related instruments and tools, this research helps ensure associate degree-level technical education programs can engage in a continual process of program evaluation and improvement.\n\nIdentification and Comparison of Academic Self Regulatory Learning Strategy Use of Students Enrolled in Traditional and Accelerated Baccalaureate Degree Nursing Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMullen, Patricia A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nObjective: To explore and compare the use of metacognitive, cognitive, and environmental resource management self regulatory learning (SRL) strategies used by a national sample of students enrolled in traditional and accelerated baccalaureate nursing programs.

An associate degree nursing program at a large community college used a three-year grant from the US Department of Labor to create a program to improve retention of nursing students. Seven retention interventions (stipends, learning communities, comprehensive orientation, individualized academic planning, counseling, peer tutoring, and community nurse mentoring) were provided to participants. Correlational analyses were conducted between demographic variables and degree completion and between individual intervention program participation and degree completion. The program produced a statistically significant improvement in retention, but no specific intervention or mixture of interventions was significantly correlated with retention. Retention programs must be comprehensive, integrated efforts in order to increase the degree completion rate.\n\nAccelerated bridge paint test program.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2011-07-06\n\nThe accelerated bridge paint (AB-Paint) program evaluated a new Sherwin-Williams two-coat, : fast-curing paint system.

This objective of this project was to identify whether a prelicensure nursing program that is both accelerated and on-line is as effective as a traditional face-to-face program, in terms of graduation rates and National Council Licensure Exam pass rates. This analysis of 1,064 students compared demographic and outcomes data between students in a state university's college of nursing who were enrolled in an accelerated, fully on-line bachelors of science in nursing (BSN) program and the traditional on-campus BSN program. Students significantly differed in their ethnicity, level of prior education, and graduation rates (95% vs. 89.3%). First-time National Council Licensure Exam pass rates for both groups did not significantly differ (92.5% vs. 94.5%). Results indicate that an accelerated on-line BSN program can overcome factors known to limit capacity expansion in schools of nursing and produce high-quality student outcomes.

A degree in bioethics enhances the care physicians provide to patients and prepares physicians to serve on ethics committees and consult services. Additionally, they may work on institutional and public policy issues related to ethics. Several physician assistant (PA) programs currently offer a master of public health (MPH) dual degree for PAs. A degree in public health prepares PAs for leadership roles in meeting community health needs. With the success of PA/MPH dual degree programs, we argue here that a PA/bioethics dual degree would be another opportunity to advance the PA profession and consider how such a program might be implemented. The article includes the individual perspectives of the authors, one of whom completed a graduate-level certificate in bioethics concurrently with his 2-year PA program, while the other served as a bioethics program director.\n\nMarketing and Retention Strategies for Adult Degree Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrown, Joann A.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFour marketing strategies are critical to the success of adult degree programs: integrating marketing, knowing your students (research), shaping programs and services for adults, and staying the course (retention).\n\nThe accelerated residency program: the Marshall University family practice 9-year experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetrany, Stephen M; Crespo, Richard\n\n2002-10-01\n\nIn 1989, the American Board of Family Practice (ABFP) approved the first of 12 accelerated residency programs in family practice. These experimental programs provide a 1-year experience for select medical students that combines the requirements of the fourth year of medical school with those of the first year of residency, reducing the total training time by 1 year. This paper reports on the achievements and limitations of the Marshall University accelerated residency program over a 9-year period that began in 1992. Several parameters have been monitored since the inception of the accelerated program and provide the basis for comparison of accelerated and traditional residents. These include initial resident characteristics, performance outcomes, and practice choices. A total of 16 students were accepted into the accelerated track from 1992 through 1998. During the same time period, 44 residents entered the traditional residency program. Accelerated resident tended to be older and had more career experience than their traditional counterparts. As a group, the accelerated residents scored an average of 30 points higher on the final in-training exams provided by the ABFP. All residents in both groups remained at Marshall to complete the full residency training experience, and all those who have taken the ABFP certifying exam have passed. Accelerated residents were more likely to practice in West Virginia, consistent with one of the initial goals for the program. In addition, accelerated residents were more likely to be elected chief resident and choose an academic career than those in the traditional group. Both groups opted for small town or rural practice equally. The Marshall University family practice 9-year experience with the accelerated residency track demonstrates that for carefully selected candidates, the program can provide an overall shortened path to board certification and attract students who excel academically and have high leadership potential\n\nCommnity Petascale Project for Accelerator Science And Simulation: Advancing Computational Science for Future Accelerators And Accelerator Technologies\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSpentzouris, Panagiotis; /Fermilab; Cary, John\n\nThe design and performance optimization of particle accelerators are essential for the success of the DOE scientific program in the next decade. Particle accelerators are very complex systems whose accurate description involves a large number of degrees of freedom and requires the inclusion of many physics processes. Building on the success of the SciDAC-1 Accelerator Science and Technology project, the SciDAC-2 Community Petascale Project for Accelerator Science and Simulation (ComPASS) is developing a comprehensive set of interoperable components for beam dynamics, electromagnetics, electron cooling, and laser/plasma acceleration modelling. ComPASS is providing accelerator scientists the tools required to enable the necessarymoreÂ Â» accelerator simulation paradigm shift from high-fidelity single physics process modeling (covered under SciDAC1) to high-fidelity multiphysics modeling. Our computational frameworks have been used to model the behavior of a large number of accelerators and accelerator R&D experiments, assisting both their design and performance optimization. As parallel computational applications, the ComPASS codes have been shown to make effective use of thousands of processors.Â«Â less\n\nIncorporating a built environment module into an accelerated second-degree community health nursing course.\n\nPubMed\n\nHays, Judith C; Davis, Jeffrey A; Miranda, Marie Lynn\n\n2006-01-01\n\nEnvironmental quality is a leading indicator of population health. Environmental health content has been integrated into the curriculum of an Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing program for second-degree students through development of an environmental health nursing module for the final-semester community health nursing course. The module was developed through collaboration between two professional schools at Duke University (the School of Nursing and the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences). It focused on the role of the built environment in community health and featured a mix of teaching strategies, including five components: (1) classroom lecture with associated readings, (2) two rounds of online small-group student discussions, (3) assessment of the built environment in local neighborhoods by student teams, (4) team presentation of the neighborhood assessments, and (5) individual student papers synthesizing the conclusions from all team presentations. The goal of the module was to provide nursing students with an organizing framework for integrating environmental health into clinical practice and an innovative tool for understanding community-level components of public health.\n\nThe Impact of Prematriculation Admission Characteristics on Graduation Rates in an Accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy Program.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteinberg, Michael; Morin, Anna K\n\n2015-10-25\n\nObjective. To evaluate the impact of admission characteristics on graduation in an accelerated doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) program. Methods. Selected prematriculation characteristics of students entering the graduation class years of 2009-2012 on the Worcester and Manchester campuses of MCPHS University were analyzed and compared for on-time graduation. Results. Eighty-two percent of evaluated students (699 of 852) graduated on time. Students who were most likely to graduate on-time attended a 4-year school, previously earned a bachelor's degree, had an overall prematriculation grade point average (GPA) greater than or equal to 3.6, and graduated in the spring just prior to matriculating to the university. Factors that reduced the likelihood of graduating on time were also identified. Work experience had a marginal impact on graduating on time. Conclusion. Although there is no certainty in college admission decisions, prematriculation characteristics can help predict the likelihood for academic success of students in an accelerated PharmD program.\n\nThe Impact of Prematriculation Admission Characteristics on Graduation Rates in an Accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy Program\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMorin, Anna K.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective.

In order to provide information that would facilitate pharmacology curricula to be refined and developed, and approaches to teaching to be updated, a national survey was undertaken in Australia that investigated pharmacology course content, teaching and summative assessment methods. Twenty-two institutions participated in a purpose-built online questionnaire, which enabled an evaluation of 147 courses taught in 10 different degrees. To enable comparison, degrees were grouped into four major degree programs, namely science, pharmacy, medicine and nursing. The pharmacology content was then classified into 16 lecture themes, with 2-21 lecture topics identified per theme. The resultant data were analysed for similarities and differences in pharmacology curricula across the degree programs. While all lecture themes were taught across degree programs, curriculum content differed with respect to the breadth and hours of coverage. Overall, lecture themes were taught most broadly in medicine and with greatest coverage in pharmacy. Reflecting a more traditional approach, lectures were a dominant teaching method (at least 90% of courses). Sixty-three percent of science courses provided practical classes but such sessions occurred much less frequently in other degree programs, while tutorials were much more common in pharmacy degree programs (70%). Notably, problem-based learning was common across medical programs. Considerable diversity was found in the types of summative assessment tasks employed. In science courses the most common form of in-semester assessment was practical reports, whereas in other programs pen-and-paper quizzes predominated. End-of-semester assessment contributed 50-80% to overall assessment across degree programs. The similarity in lecture themes taught across the four different degree programs shows that common knowledge- and competency-based learning\n\nEnterpreneurship/Small Business Degree Programs at Community Colleges\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMaidment, Fred\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAssociate degree programs at community colleges in small business/entrepreneurship were examined in this article.

Based upon the findings from those conferences, several initiatives emerged that support RTs earning a baccalaureate (or bachelor's) degree. The objective of this study was to identify the ways that associate degree programs communicate career pathways toward a baccalaureate degree through their Web sites. This cross-sectional observational study used a random sample of 100 of the 362 associate degree programs approved by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care. Data were collected from 3 specific categories: demographic data, baccalaureate completion information, and the Web page location for the program. The presence of statements related to any pathway toward a bachelor's degree, transfer credits, articulation agreements, and links for baccalaureate completion were recorded. The descriptive statistics in this study were reported as total numbers and percentages. Of the 100 programs in the random sample, only 89 were included in the study. Only 39 (44%) programs had links on their program Web site that had any content related to bachelor's degrees, 16 (18%) identified college transfer courses toward a bachelor's degree, and 26 (29%) programs included baccalaureate articulation agreements on their Web site. A minority of associate degree programs communicated career pathway information to their prospective and current students through program Web sites. An informative Web site would make the path more transparent for entry-level students to meet their future educational needs as their careers progress.

A wide variety of retention strategies were reported. Those most often cited were academic remediation (92%), clinical skill development/remediation (84%), academic advising (84%), financial aid assistance (84%), and tutoring (80%). Participating programs also reported setting high academic and ethical standards. Specific criteria for student re-entry were discussed. The findings of this study suggest that associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs are committed to student retention and make considerable efforts to help students succeed. Student retention efforts could be enhanced for those student groups identified as possibly being at high risk for attrition. The findings and recommendations in this investigation may assist associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs in their efforts to retain a higher percentage of students.\n\nHuman Service Administrator Perceptions of Online MSW Degree Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCurran, Laura; Sanchez Mayers, Ray; Fulghum, Fontaine\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOnline programs have proliferated rapidly in higher education, and this reality holds true for social work education as well.

Understanding the factors that attract these individuals to the study and practice of nursing is important for nursing recruitment and retention. In this article the author describes how she analyzed the stories of the first two cohorts of students (N=66) admitted to an accelerated, second degree program in the Southeastern United States. These stories, written by prospective students, described the factors that influenced their decision to pursue the study of nursing as a second career. A content analysis identified three themes: What I bring to nursing; Seeking satisfying work; and The missing piece. The findings provide insight into the factors that attract the second degree/career changing learner to the study of nursing. The author begins with a review of literature related to the reasons for choosing nursing as a profession and a description of the method used to analyze the stories written by the prospective students. This is followed by her presentation of findings, along with a discussion of the findings and the implications of the findings for educators and employers.\n\nCase Study: Creation of a Degree Program in Computer Security.

R.; Manduca, C. A.; Larsen, K.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nOver the decade 2002-12, the percentage of students from underrepresented minorities (URM) graduating with geoscience degrees has increased by 50%. In 2012, of the nearly 6,000 geoscience Bachelor's degrees, 8% were awarded to students from URM. But that same year across all of STEM, 18% of Bachelors went to these students, and URM made up 30% of the US population overall. Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) play an important role in increasing the diversity of geoscience graduates where there are appropriate degree programs or pathways to programs. To better understand opportunities at these institutions, the InTeGrate project collected information on degree programs at MSIs. A summer 2013 survey of websites for three types of MSIs confirmed that, while stand-alone Geology, Geoscience, or Environmental Science departments are present, there are a larger number of degree programs that include elements of geoscience or related disciplines (geography, GIS, etc.) offered in interdisciplinary departments (e.g. Natural Sciences and Math) or cognate science departments (Physics, Engineering, etc.). Approximately one-third of Hispanic Serving Institutions and Tribal Colleges and one-fifth of Historically Black Colleges and Universities offer at least one degree that includes elements of geoscience. The most common programs were Geology and Environmental Science (94 and 88 degrees respectively), but 21 other types of program were also found. To better profile the nature of these programs, 11 interviews were conducted focusing on strategies for attracting, supporting, and preparing minority students for the workforce. In conjunction with the February 2014 Broadening Access to the Earth and Environmental Sciences workshop, an additional 6 MSI profiles were obtained as well as 22 profiles from non-MSIs. Several common strategies emerge: Proactive marketing and outreach to local high schools and two-year colleges Community building, mentoring and advising, academic support\n\nThree Accelerated Developmental Education Programs: Features, Student Outcomes, and Implications\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJaggars, Shanna Smith; Hodara, Michelle; Cho, Sung-Woo; Xu, Di\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo support the long-term success of underprepared students, many community colleges are experimenting with accelerated developmental education models, which allow students to complete remediation and enroll in college-level math and English within a shorter time frame.

Experts have called for a nursing workforce that mirrors the population it serves. Students in nursing programs in the United States do not reflect our country's diverse population; therefore, much work is needed before that goal can be reached. Diversity cannot be successfully achieved in nursing education without inclusion and attention to quality. The Inclusive Excellence framework can be used by nurse educators to promote inclusion, diversity, and excellence. In this framework, excellence and diversity are linked in an intentional metric-driven process. Accelerated programs offer a possible venue to promote diversity, and one accelerated program is examined using a set of metrics and a dashboard approach commonly used in business settings. Several recommendations were made for future assessment, interventions, and monitoring. Nurse educators are called to examine and adopt a diversity dashboard in all nursing programs.

Evidenced by Microsoft's FPGA deployment in its Bing search engine and Intel's 16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, integrating FPGAs into datacenters is considered one of the most promising approaches to sustain future datacenter growth. However, it is quite challenging for existing big data computing systems-like Apache Spark and Hadoop-to access the performance and energy benefits of FPGA accelerators. In this paper we design and implement Blaze to provide programming and runtime support for enabling easy and efficient deployments of FPGA accelerators in datacenters. In particular, Blaze abstracts FPGA accelerators as a service (FaaS) and provides a set of clean programming APIs for big data processing applications to easily utilize those accelerators. Our Blaze runtime implements an FaaS framework to efficiently share FPGA accelerators among multiple heterogeneous threads on a single node, and extends Hadoop YARN with accelerator-centric scheduling to efficiently share them among multiple computing tasks in the cluster. Experimental results using four representative big data applications demonstrate that Blaze greatly reduces the programming efforts to access FPGA accelerators in systems like Apache Spark and YARN, and improves the system throughput by 1.7 Ã to 3Ã (and energy efficiency by 1.5Ã to 2.7Ã) compared to a conventional CPU-only cluster.\n\nA survey of degree completion programs in dental hygiene education.\n\nPubMed\n\nPortillo, Karen M; Rogo, Ellen J; Calley, Kristin H; Cellucci, Leigh W\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe purpose of this descriptive study was to identify specific information related to U.S. dental hygiene baccalaureate degree completion programs. Learning experiences, assessment methods, and baccalaureate institutional partnerships were assessed. Of the sixty dental hygiene programs that offer a degree completion program, the forty-two that met the inclusion criteria (including having operated for at least three years) were invited to participate in a thirty-eight item online survey. A 62 percent (n=26) response rate was obtained. Learning experiences in responding programs included core dental hygiene courses, general education courses, and elective dental hygiene courses. Emphasis areas offered by various programs were in the specialty areas of education, public or community health, and research. Respondents reported that their graduates were employed in multiple settings (65 percent; n=17), with 19 percent (n=5) reporting employment in the combined grouping of private practice, education, and public health. Institutional partnerships included articulation agreements (88 percent; n=21), community college baccalaureate (8 percent; n=2), and university extension (4 percent; n=1) models. The findings of this study provide a baseline for assessing the educational composition and design of U.S. dental hygiene degree completion programs. However, results of this study showed inconsistencies among learning experiences that might raise concerns when considering students' level of preparation for graduate education and future leadership roles in the profession.\n\nCompetencies for Graduate Culinary Management Degree Programs: Stakeholders' Perspectives\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGeorge, Annette A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAvailable literature on graduate hospitality education was highly focused on required competencies for hospitality management degree programs but not on culinary management.

A comparison of retention and career-placement rates between bachelor's and master's degree professional athletic training programs may inform the debate. To compare the retention rates and career-placement rates of students in bachelor's and master's degree professional programs. Cross-sectional study. Web-based survey. A total of 192 program directors (PDs) from bachelor's degree (n = 177) and master's degree (n = 15) professional programs. The PDs completed a Web-based survey. We instructed the PDs to provide a retention rate and career-placement rate for the students in the programs they lead for each of the past 5 years. We also asked the PDs if they thought retention of students was a problem currently facing athletic training education. We used independent t tests to compare the responses between bachelor's and master's degree professional programs. We found a higher retention rate for professional master's degree students (88.70% Â± 9.02%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.71, 93.69) than bachelor's degree students (80.98% Â± 17.86%, 95% CI = 78.30, 83.66) (t25 = -2.86, P = .008, d = 0.55). Similarly, PDs from professional master's degree programs reported higher career-placement percentages (88.50% Â± 10.68%, 95% CI = 82.33, 94.67) than bachelor's degree professional PDs (71.32% Â± 18.47%, 95% CI = 68.54, 74.10) (t20 = -5.40, P < .001, d = 1.14). Finally, we observed no difference between groups regarding whether retention is a problem facing athletic training (Ï(2)1 = 0.720, P = .40, Î¦ = .061). Professional master's degree education appears to facilitate higher retention rates and greater career-placement rates in athletic training than bachelor's degree education.
