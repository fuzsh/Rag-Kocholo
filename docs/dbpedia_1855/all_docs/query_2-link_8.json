        "text": "The AAS Visiting Professor Programs: Three Anniversaries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPhilip, A. G. Davis\n\n2003-05-01\n\nThe AAS Program of Visiting Professors was started in 1958 with three astronomers as lecturers. They were Paul Merrill (Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories), Seth Nicholson (Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories) and Harlow Shapley (Harvard College Observatory). The program was run by a Committee on Visiting Professors from 1958 through 1963. The program was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation. The Executive Officer of the AAS, Paul Routley headed the program from the 1963 - 64 academic year through the 1968 - 69 academic year. Larry Fredrick headed the program for 1969 - 70 and then Hank Gurin headed it through 1973 -74, the last year of the program. At the end of this summer meeting, the combined Visiting Professors Program and the Shapley Program will be starting their 47th year. The Shapley Visiting Lectureships in Astronomy Program was started in the 1974 - 75 academic year under the leadership of Hank Gurin. The original funding came from the Perkin Fund and a three year grant from the Research Corporation. In 1975 the Shapley Endowment fund was set up to help pay the expenses of the program. In 1976 there was support from the Slipher fund which lasted through the 1978 - 79 academic year. From 1979 to the present the program is financed by the Shapley Endowment Fund and by the contributions made by institutions which host the visits. In the fall of 1998 the fee that Institutions pay to the AAS in support of their Shapley visits was reduced from 300 to 250 to make it easier for them to apply for visits. Members of the AAS have made contributions to the program over the years and we are very appreciative of this support. In 1974 there were 42 lecturers in the program, of whom four are still active giving lectures (George Carruthers, Larry Fredrick, Arlo Landolt and Davis Philip). After the summer meeting, the Shapley Program will be embarking on its 30th year. Now there are 82 astronomers in the program and we get from 40 to 60 requests a year\n\nThe Effectiveness of the AAS REU Program\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHemenway, M. K.; Boyce, P. B.; Milkey, R. W.\n\n1996-05-01\n\nIn an attempt to address the particular needs of astronomy faculty and undergraduate students, in 1991 the Education Office of the American Astronomical Society approached the National Science Foundation with a unique proposal for funding through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. The goals of the AAS program were to \"slow the hemorrhage of students out of science...\", extend the REU program to non-NSF-funded scientists, to reach under-represented women and minority students particularly in small educational institutions, and to encourage research scientists there to mentor students. As this grant has now expired, the AAS has surveyed the 44 mentors and their students to assess the program's effect on the mentor and the mentor's career; the educational institution; and the student's education and career choices. More than half the mentors responded by the abstract deadline. The program clearly had an effect upon the individuals involved. The greatest effect (in 85% of the cases) was to develop more interest in the mentor's research project both among the students and among the mentor's faculty colleagues. The mentors rated the grant to be a medium or strong factor in their student's decision to pursue graduate study, which 90% of them did. All but one of the AAS-REU students attended an AAS meeting and 3/4 of those gave a paper on their project research. Over 90% of the mentors felt that the research experience strongly promoted a greater interest in science, a greater understanding of science and a desire to continue in science. According to the mentors, this was a very positive and beneficial program for the students as well as for themselves.\n\nArticulation to and from the Applied Associate Degree: Challenges and Opportunities\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nIgnash, Jan M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis chapter discusses the \"tangled knot\" of articulating associate degrees in applied fields and reviews sample programs from applied associate (A.A.S.) to baccalaureate degrees using three distinct pathways, comparing the resulting A.A.S. to baccalaureate degree pathways to similar B.A. or B.S. programs.

In order to understand the exposure degree of the important arthropod species to Cry proteins in Bt rice fields, and to select the appropriate non-target arthropods in the risk assessment of insect-resistant GM crops, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure the Cry2Aa protein concentration in the arthropods collected from the cry2Aa rice fields at different rice growth stages. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the Cry2Aa content protein concentration in different arthropod species. Some species did not contain Cry2Aa protein, while some species contained larger amounts of Cry2Aa protein. Relative to the arthropods colleted after rice anthesis, the arthropods colleted in rice anthesis contained relative higher concentrations of Cry2Aa protein, especially for the predacious arthropods. No Cry proteins were detected in parasitic arthropods. This study provided references for the laboratory assessment of the effects of GM rice on nontarget arthropods.\n\nA Status Report on the AAS Astronomy Ambassadors Program\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFienberg, Richard Tresch; Fraknoi, Andrew; Gurton, Suzanne; Hurst, Anna; Schatz, Dennis L.\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe American Astronomical Society, in partnership with the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP), has launched a series of professional-development workshops and a community of practice designed to improve early-career astronomersâ ability to communicate effectively with students and the public. Called AAS Astronomy Ambassadors, the program provides training and mentoring for young astronomers, from advanced undergraduates to beginning faculty; it also provides them access to resources and a network of contacts within the astronomy education and public outreach (EPO) community. Ambassadors are provided with a library of outreach activities and resource materials suitable for a range of venues and audiences. For much of this library we are using resources developed by organizations such as the ASP, the Pacific Science Center, and the Center for Astronomy Education for other outreach programs, though some resources have been created by one of us (AF) specifically for this program. After a period of evaluation and revision, the programâs âMenu of Outreach Opportunities for Science Educationâ (MOOSE) is now posted on the AAS website at http://aas.org/outreach/moose-menu-outreach-opportunities-science-education.The first two Astronomy Ambassadors workshops were held at AAS meetings in January 2013 and January 2014; each served 30 young astronomers chosen from about twice that many applicants. Web-based follow-up activities are being provided through a website at the ASP designed to keep cohorts of educators trained in their programs in touch with one another. The AAS is exploring ways to fund additional workshops at future winter meetings; suggestions are most welcome. Meanwhile, the Astronomy Ambassadors trained to date have logged more than 150 outreach events, reaching many thousands of children and adults across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIntroducing the AAS Astronomy Ambassadors Program\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGurton, S.; Fienberg, R. T.; Fraknoi, A.; Prather, E. E.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nNewly established by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), the Astronomy Ambassadors program is designed to support early-career AAS members with training in resources and techniques for effective outreach to students and/or the public. A pilot Astronomy Ambassadors workshop will be held at the January 2013 AAS meeting. Workshop participants will learn to communicate effectively with public and school audiences; find outreach opportunities and establish ongoing partnerships with local schools, science centers, museums, parks, and/or community centers; reach audiences with personal stories, hands-on activities, and jargon-free language; identify strategies and techniques to improve their presentation skills; gain access to a menu of outreach resources that work in a variety of settings; and become part of an active community of astronomers who do outreach. Applications are welcome from advanced undergraduates (those doing research and committed to continuing in astronomy), graduate students, and postdocs and new faculty in their first two years after receipt of the PhD. We especially encourage applications from members of groups that are presently underrepresented in science.\n\nTech-Prep/Associate Degree Program Guide: Tech Prep Associate Degree Program, Business Administration Associate Degree Program, Office Administration Associate Degree Program, Allied Health Associate Degree Program.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMarmaras, Judy; Neri, Pat\n\nThe Tech-Prep Associate Degree Program (TPAD) at the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) in Warwick, is a high school/community college partnership providing high school students with an alternative program of study focused on goal setting, basic academic skills development, and the skills needed to pursue a career in a technical, business orâ¦\n\nTwo Universities, Two Degrees: A Dual Degree Program for Pharmacists.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMilio, Frank\n\n2001-01-01\n\nDescribes a dual degree program between Towson University and the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, which allows a student to receive both a B.S. degree in Medicinal Chemistry and a Doctor of Pharmacy degree in a combined 7-year program.

E.; Hurst, A.; Schatz, D. L.\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe American Astronomical Society, partnering with organizations active in science education and public outreach (EPO), has launched a series of professional-development workshops and a community of practice designed to help improve early-career astronomersâ ability to effectively communicate with students and the public. Called Astronomy Ambassadors, the program provides mentoring and training experiences for young astronomers, from advanced undergraduates to beginning faculty; it also provides access to resources and a network of contacts within the astronomy EPO community. By learning how to implement effective education and outreach strategies, Astronomy Ambassadors become better teachers, better presenters at meetings, and better representatives of our science to the public and to government. And because young astronomers are a more diverse group than those who currently do the majority of outreach, they help the astronomical community present a more multicultural and gender-balanced face to the public, enabling members of underserved groups to see themselves as scientists. Ambassadors are provided with a large library of outreach activities and materials that are suitable for a range of venues and audiences and that will grow with time. For much of this library we are using resources developed by organizations such as the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the Pacific Science Center, and the Center for Astronomy Education for other outreach programs, though some resources have been created by one of us (AF) specifically for this program. The first Astronomy Ambassadors workshop was held at the 221st meeting of the AAS in January 2013 and served 30 young astronomers chosen from more than 75 applicants. Incorporating feedback from workshop participants and lessons learned from the reports theyâve submitted after conducting their own outreach events, we are now planning the second annual workshop to be held 4-5 January 2014 at the 223rd AAS meeting in\n\nThe AAS to BAS Pathway: Heating Up the Educational Aspiration of CTE Students\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKujawa, Tricia A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe enrollment and transfer behaviors of college students are diverse.

M.; Williger, G. M.; Grady, C. A.; Woodgate, B.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThe microjet of AA Tau A.W. Cox (Atholton High School, Columbia MD), G.M. Hilton (SSAI and GSFC), G.M. Williger (JHU and U. Louisville), C.A. Grady (Eureka Scientific and GSFC) B.Woodgate (NASA's GSFC) AA Tau is a classical T Tauri star with a spatially resolved disk viewed at approximately 70 degrees from pole-on. Photo-polarimetric variability of the star has been interpreted as being caused by the stellar magnetic field being inclined at 30 degrees with respect to the stellar rotation axis, producing a warp in the inner disk. Under these conditions, any jet should be less collimated than typical of T Tauri microjets, and should show signs of the jet axis precessing around the stellar rotation axis. When compared with the microjets imaged in the HST/STIS coronagraphic imaging survey, the AA Tau jet has an opening half-angle of approximately 10-15 degrees rather than the 3-5 degrees typical of the other T Tauri stars which have been coronagraphically imaged by HST/STIS. Using the HST data with ultra-narrowband imagery and long slit spectroscopy obtained with the Goddard Fabry-Perot and the Dual Imaging Spectrograph at the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m telescope, we derive the jet inclination, knot ejection epochs, and ejection frequency. We also compare the jet opening angle with model predictions. Apache Point Observatory observations with the Goddard Fabry-Perot were made through a grant of Director's Discretionary Time. Apache Point Observatory is operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium. The GFP was supported under NASA RTOP 51-188-01-22 to GSFC. Grady is supported under NASA contract NNH05CD30C to Eureka Scientific.\n\nChanges in depression mediate the effects of AA attendance on alcohol use outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilcox, Claire E; Tonigan, J Scott\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDepression may contribute to increased drinking in individuals with alcohol use disorder. Although Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance predicts drinking reductions, there is conflicting information regarding the intermediary role played by reductions in depression. We explored whether AA attendance reduces depressive symptoms, the degree to which improvement in depression results in reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these effects occur. 253 early AA affiliates (63% male) were recruited and assessed at baseline 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and was administered at baseline 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. AA attendance and alcohol use outcomes were obtained with the Form 90. Mediation analyses were performed at early (3, 6, and 9 months) and late (12, 18, and 24 months) follow-up to investigate the degree to which reductions in depression mediated the effect of AA attendance on drinking, controlling for concurrent drinking. In addition, a series of moderated mediation analyses were performed using baseline depression severity as a moderator. At early follow-up, reductions in depression (6 months) mediated the effects of AA attendance (3 months) on later drinking (drinks per drinking day) (9 months) (b = -0.02, boot CI [-0.055, -0.0004]), controlling for drinking at 6 months. Baseline depression severity did not moderate the degree to which BDI mediated the effects of AA attendance on alcohol use (ps > .05). These findings provide further evidence that depression reduction is a mechanism by which AA attendance leads to reductions in alcohol use. Improving depression may help reduce alcohol use in individuals with AUD, and AA attendance may be an effective way to achieve that goal.\n\nEffects of a retention intervention program for associate degree nursing students.\n\nPubMed\n\nFontaine, Karen\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the effects of a retention intervention program on nursing students' persistence in obtaining an associate's degree. An associate degree nursing program at a large community college used a three-year grant from the US Department of Labor to create a program to improve retention of nursing students. Seven retention interventions (stipends, learning communities, comprehensive orientation, individualized academic planning, counseling, peer tutoring, and community nurse mentoring) were provided to participants. Correlational analyses were conducted between demographic variables and degree completion and between individual intervention program participation and degree completion. The program produced a statistically significant improvement in retention, but no specific intervention or mixture of interventions was significantly correlated with retention. Retention programs must be comprehensive, integrated efforts in order to increase the degree completion rate.\n\nAn Existential Approach: An Alternative to the AA Model of Recovery\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRogers, Maria A.; Cobia, Debra\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the most widely used organization for the treatment of alcoholism.

A degree in bioethics enhances the care physicians provide to patients and prepares physicians to serve on ethics committees and consult services. Additionally, they may work on institutional and public policy issues related to ethics. Several physician assistant (PA) programs currently offer a master of public health (MPH) dual degree for PAs. A degree in public health prepares PAs for leadership roles in meeting community health needs. With the success of PA/MPH dual degree programs, we argue here that a PA/bioethics dual degree would be another opportunity to advance the PA profession and consider how such a program might be implemented. The article includes the individual perspectives of the authors, one of whom completed a graduate-level certificate in bioethics concurrently with his 2-year PA program, while the other served as a bioethics program director.\n\nMarketing and Retention Strategies for Adult Degree Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrown, Joann A.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFour marketing strategies are critical to the success of adult degree programs: integrating marketing, knowing your students (research), shaping programs and services for adults, and staying the course (retention).\n\nThe Evaluation of an Early Childhood Teacher Preparation Program: An Action Research Project\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRagno, Kerry Sullivan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this dissertation was to evaluate the effectiveness of an Early Childhood Development Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree program at one community college as part of an ongoing action research project.

In order to provide information that would facilitate pharmacology curricula to be refined and developed, and approaches to teaching to be updated, a national survey was undertaken in Australia that investigated pharmacology course content, teaching and summative assessment methods. Twenty-two institutions participated in a purpose-built online questionnaire, which enabled an evaluation of 147 courses taught in 10 different degrees. To enable comparison, degrees were grouped into four major degree programs, namely science, pharmacy, medicine and nursing. The pharmacology content was then classified into 16 lecture themes, with 2-21 lecture topics identified per theme. The resultant data were analysed for similarities and differences in pharmacology curricula across the degree programs. While all lecture themes were taught across degree programs, curriculum content differed with respect to the breadth and hours of coverage. Overall, lecture themes were taught most broadly in medicine and with greatest coverage in pharmacy. Reflecting a more traditional approach, lectures were a dominant teaching method (at least 90% of courses). Sixty-three percent of science courses provided practical classes but such sessions occurred much less frequently in other degree programs, while tutorials were much more common in pharmacy degree programs (70%). Notably, problem-based learning was common across medical programs. Considerable diversity was found in the types of summative assessment tasks employed. In science courses the most common form of in-semester assessment was practical reports, whereas in other programs pen-and-paper quizzes predominated. End-of-semester assessment contributed 50-80% to overall assessment across degree programs. The similarity in lecture themes taught across the four different degree programs shows that common knowledge- and competency-based learning\n\nEnterpreneurship/Small Business Degree Programs at Community Colleges\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMaidment, Fred\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAssociate degree programs at community colleges in small business/entrepreneurship were examined in this article.

Based upon the findings from those conferences, several initiatives emerged that support RTs earning a baccalaureate (or bachelor's) degree. The objective of this study was to identify the ways that associate degree programs communicate career pathways toward a baccalaureate degree through their Web sites. This cross-sectional observational study used a random sample of 100 of the 362 associate degree programs approved by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care. Data were collected from 3 specific categories: demographic data, baccalaureate completion information, and the Web page location for the program. The presence of statements related to any pathway toward a bachelor's degree, transfer credits, articulation agreements, and links for baccalaureate completion were recorded. The descriptive statistics in this study were reported as total numbers and percentages. Of the 100 programs in the random sample, only 89 were included in the study. Only 39 (44%) programs had links on their program Web site that had any content related to bachelor's degrees, 16 (18%) identified college transfer courses toward a bachelor's degree, and 26 (29%) programs included baccalaureate articulation agreements on their Web site. A minority of associate degree programs communicated career pathway information to their prospective and current students through program Web sites. An informative Web site would make the path more transparent for entry-level students to meet their future educational needs as their careers progress.

The microstructure evolution of AA5083, AA6082 and AA7075 aluminium alloys is characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Metallurgical investigations and mechanical tests are also performed to correlate the results of the TEM investigations with the mechanical properties of the produced diffusion bonded joints. It is observed that the bonding and shear strength of the alloys increase with the increase in bonding temperature, due to the diffusion of micro-constituents in the interface. High temperature enhances the uniform distribution of secondary phase particles and reduces pore formation/defects in the bonded joints.\n\nCooperative Program and Facilities Planning, Southern Maine Vocational Technical Institute--University of Maine at Portland-Gorham.

Included are student attrition issues, academic standards, re-entry policies, and clinical remediation strategies. A survey consisting of forced choice and open-ended questions was mailed to 31 randomly selected associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs. Surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics and frequency distributions. Open-ended questions were analyzed using the constant comparative qualitative method to identify recurring themes. There was an 80% (n=25) return response to the survey. The findings of this study determined that dental hygiene programs are graduating, on average, a higher percentage (83%) of students when compared to two-year, associate degree programs in general (46%). The primary reasons reported by respondents for student attrition included: academic difficulties (88%), dissatisfaction with career choice (76%), family/personal responsibilities (72%), and clinical skill difficulties (56%). A wide variety of retention strategies were reported. Those most often cited were academic remediation (92%), clinical skill development/remediation (84%), academic advising (84%), financial aid assistance (84%), and tutoring (80%). Participating programs also reported setting high academic and ethical standards. Specific criteria for student re-entry were discussed. The findings of this study suggest that associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs are committed to student retention and make considerable efforts to help students succeed. Student retention efforts could be enhanced for those student groups identified as possibly being at high risk for attrition. The findings and recommendations in this investigation may assist associate degree, entry-level dental hygiene programs in their efforts to retain a higher percentage of students.\n\nHuman Service Administrator Perceptions of Online MSW Degree Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCurran, Laura; Sanchez Mayers, Ray; Fulghum, Fontaine\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOnline programs have proliferated rapidly in higher education, and this reality holds true for social work education as well.

R.; Manduca, C. A.; Larsen, K.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nOver the decade 2002-12, the percentage of students from underrepresented minorities (URM) graduating with geoscience degrees has increased by 50%. In 2012, of the nearly 6,000 geoscience Bachelor's degrees, 8% were awarded to students from URM. But that same year across all of STEM, 18% of Bachelors went to these students, and URM made up 30% of the US population overall. Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) play an important role in increasing the diversity of geoscience graduates where there are appropriate degree programs or pathways to programs. To better understand opportunities at these institutions, the InTeGrate project collected information on degree programs at MSIs. A summer 2013 survey of websites for three types of MSIs confirmed that, while stand-alone Geology, Geoscience, or Environmental Science departments are present, there are a larger number of degree programs that include elements of geoscience or related disciplines (geography, GIS, etc.) offered in interdisciplinary departments (e.g. Natural Sciences and Math) or cognate science departments (Physics, Engineering, etc.). Approximately one-third of Hispanic Serving Institutions and Tribal Colleges and one-fifth of Historically Black Colleges and Universities offer at least one degree that includes elements of geoscience. The most common programs were Geology and Environmental Science (94 and 88 degrees respectively), but 21 other types of program were also found. To better profile the nature of these programs, 11 interviews were conducted focusing on strategies for attracting, supporting, and preparing minority students for the workforce. In conjunction with the February 2014 Broadening Access to the Earth and Environmental Sciences workshop, an additional 6 MSI profiles were obtained as well as 22 profiles from non-MSIs. Several common strategies emerge: Proactive marketing and outreach to local high schools and two-year colleges Community building, mentoring and advising, academic support\n\nAAS Oral History Project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBuxner, Sanlyn; Holbrook, Jarita; AAS Oral History Team\n\n2016-06-01\n\nNow in its fourth year, the AAS Oral History Project has interviewed over 80 astronomers from all over the world. Led by the AAS Historical Astronomy Division (HAD) and partially funded by the American Institute of Physics Niels Bohr Library and ongoing support from the AAS, volunteers have collected oral histories from astronomers at professional meetings starting in 2015, including AAS, DPS, and the IAU general assembly. Each interview lasts one and a half to two hours and focuses on intervieweesâ personal and professional lives. Questions include those about oneâs family, childhood, strong influences on oneâs scientific career, career path, successes and challenges, perspectives on how astronomy is changing as a field, and advice to the next generation. Each interview is audio recorded and transcribed, the content of which is checked with each interviewee. Once complete, interview transcripts are posted online as part of a larger oral history library at https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories. Future analysis will reveal a rich story of astronomers and will help the community address issues of diversity, controversies, and the changing landscape of science. We are still recruiting individuals to be interviewed from all stages of career from undergraduate students to retired and emeritus astronomers. Contact Jarita Holbrook to schedule an interview or to find out more information about the project (astroholbrook@gmail.com).

Learning experiences, assessment methods, and baccalaureate institutional partnerships were assessed. Of the sixty dental hygiene programs that offer a degree completion program, the forty-two that met the inclusion criteria (including having operated for at least three years) were invited to participate in a thirty-eight item online survey. A 62 percent (n=26) response rate was obtained. Learning experiences in responding programs included core dental hygiene courses, general education courses, and elective dental hygiene courses. Emphasis areas offered by various programs were in the specialty areas of education, public or community health, and research. Respondents reported that their graduates were employed in multiple settings (65 percent; n=17), with 19 percent (n=5) reporting employment in the combined grouping of private practice, education, and public health. Institutional partnerships included articulation agreements (88 percent; n=21), community college baccalaureate (8 percent; n=2), and university extension (4 percent; n=1) models. The findings of this study provide a baseline for assessing the educational composition and design of U.S. dental hygiene degree completion programs. However, results of this study showed inconsistencies among learning experiences that might raise concerns when considering students' level of preparation for graduate education and future leadership roles in the profession.\n\nCompetencies for Graduate Culinary Management Degree Programs: Stakeholders' Perspectives\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGeorge, Annette A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAvailable literature on graduate hospitality education was highly focused on required competencies for hospitality management degree programs but not on culinary management.

A comparison of retention and career-placement rates between bachelor's and master's degree professional athletic training programs may inform the debate. To compare the retention rates and career-placement rates of students in bachelor's and master's degree professional programs. Cross-sectional study. Web-based survey. A total of 192 program directors (PDs) from bachelor's degree (n = 177) and master's degree (n = 15) professional programs. The PDs completed a Web-based survey. We instructed the PDs to provide a retention rate and career-placement rate for the students in the programs they lead for each of the past 5 years. We also asked the PDs if they thought retention of students was a problem currently facing athletic training education. We used independent t tests to compare the responses between bachelor's and master's degree professional programs. We found a higher retention rate for professional master's degree students (88.70% Â± 9.02%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.71, 93.69) than bachelor's degree students (80.98% Â± 17.86%, 95% CI = 78.30, 83.66) (t25 = -2.86, P = .008, d = 0.55). Similarly, PDs from professional master's degree programs reported higher career-placement percentages (88.50% Â± 10.68%, 95% CI = 82.33, 94.67) than bachelor's degree professional PDs (71.32% Â± 18.47%, 95% CI = 68.54, 74.10) (t20 = -5.40, P < .001, d = 1.14). Finally, we observed no difference between groups regarding whether retention is a problem facing athletic training (Ï(2)1 = 0.720, P = .40, Î¦ = .061). Professional master's degree education appears to facilitate higher retention rates and greater career-placement rates in athletic training than bachelor's degree education.

ITMO University represented by Applied and Computer Optics Department and Optical Design and Testing Laboratory jointly with Warsaw University of Technology represented by the Institute of Micromechanics and Photonics at The Faculty of Mechatronics have developed a novel international master double-degree program \"Optical Design\" accumulating the expertise of both universities including experienced teaching staff, educational technologies, and experimental resources. The program presents studies targeting research and professional activities in high-tech fields connected with optical and optoelectronics devices, optical engineering, numerical methods and computer technologies. This master program deals with the design of optical systems of various types, assemblies and layouts using computer modeling means; investigation of light distribution phenomena; image modeling and formation; development of optical methods for image analysis and optical metrology including optical testing, materials characterization, NDT and industrial control and monitoring. The goal of this program is training a graduate capable to solve a wide range of research and engineering tasks in optical design and metrology leading to modern manufacturing and innovation. Variability of the program structure provides its flexibility and adoption according to current job market demands and personal learning paths for each student. In addition considerable proportion of internship and research expands practical skills.

Cross-sectional descriptive study. Course descriptions available for online access during June and July of 2012 were reviewed for the 114 centers in Spain that offer a nursing degree, according to the official Registry of Universities, Centers, and Titles. Of the 114 centers with degree programs, 95 (83.3%) post course content online, which make it possible to analyze 2,258 courses. In 60 (63.1%) of these centers, none of the courses included the concept of pressure ulcer prevention, and the course content posted by 36 (37.9%) centers made no mention of their treatment. None of the course descriptions contained any reference to pain management in patients with chronic wounds. Of the 728 elective courses analyzed, only one was related to chronic wounds. This review of available information about nursing degree programs in Spain indicates that pain management in patients with chronic wounds is not addressed in any course, and more courses consider the treatment of pressure ulcers than their prevention. Degree programs responsible for the training of future nurses should be reviewed and revised as needed to ensure that graduates have acquired minimum basic competencies in the prevention and treatment of chronic wounds that help to decrease the theory-practice gap in this field.

To describe the status of diagnostic and procedural imaging curricula within United States physical therapist professional degree programs. As patient direct access to physical therapy services increases, the ability to refer patients directly for diagnostic imaging could promote more efficient delivery of care. Appropriate patient referral is contingent on physical therapists having the requisite knowledge base and skills. While evidence describing imaging competence of physical therapists with advanced training in military institutions exists, evidence is lacking for other physical therapists, including new graduates of physical therapist professional degree programs. Faculty members teaching imaging at 206 United States physical therapist professional degree programs recognized by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education were recruited via e-mail correspondence. An e-mail attachment included the survey on which faculty reported imaging curricula and faculty qualifications, attitudes, and experiences. Faculty from 155 (75.2%) programs responded to the survey, with imaging being included in the curriculum of 152 programs. Content was integrated by required standalone courses or clinical science track courses, and/or through elective courses.

In 2004, the authors proposed that, by educating medical students in physician leadership and integrating this with a business management or public health degree program, graduates, health care organizations, and communities would benefit sooner. Given the lack of program models to guide program integration and development, the authors began a one-year inquiry to build a model leadership curriculum and integrate leadership education across degree programs. The qualitative inquiry resulted in several linked tasks. First, the authors identified a feasible method for concurrently delivering all three program components (MD degree, Leadership Curriculum, and MBA or MPH degree) during a five-year plan. Second, the authors chose a competency-based educational framework for leadership and then identified, adapted, and validated existing leadership competencies to their context. Third, the authors performed an extensive program alignment to identify existing overlaps and opportunities for integration within and across program components. Fourth, the authors performed a needs analysis to identify educational gaps, subsequently leading to redesigning two courses and to designing three new courses. A description of the Leadership Curriculum is also provided. This inquiry has led to the development of the Boonshoft Physician Leadership Development Program, which provides physician leadership education integrated with medical education and education in business management or public heath. Future program initiatives include developing leadership student assessment tools and testing the link between program activities and short- and long-term outcome measures of program success.\n\nCurrent Trends in Communication Graduate Degrees: Survey of Communications, Advertising, PR, and IMC Graduate Programs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nQuesenberry, Keith A.; Coolsen, Michael K.; Wilkerson, Kristen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA survey of 61 master's degree advertising programs reveals significant trends in program titles, curriculum design, course delivery, and students served.

Unfortunately, this phenomenon is largely unexplored in Italy. An observational study was conducted at the University of Pavia, with the aim to investigate the reasons underpinning the students' choice to enter a Nursing Degree Program. A semi-structured, self-administrated questionnaire was used for this single-center cross-sectional study. The questionnaire was aimed to investigate the reasons underpinning the students' choice to enter a Nursing Degree Program, using both open-ended and close-ended multiple choice questions. Descriptive statistics have been used to describe collected data. Open-ended response analysis was conducted through an exploratory and qualitative analysis of language. Response rate was 71% (196/275). Our study results highlighted a variety of reasons that encourage students to begin a Nursing Degree Program: the feeling of usefulness (80%), the desire to help and to care people (78%), the interest in the sciences (71%), the compassion to the suffering people (66%). We also identified 4 categories that describe which characteristics a nurse should have according to the students' point of view: expertise; personal characteristics; to experience the professional life as a social function and to have interest in the health field. Students' answers indicate that often the choice to enter a Nursing Degree Program is not supported by clear ideas and strong motivations. We consider it crucial to provide a realistic image of the nursing role and opportunities for career development, so that students can have the right elements to make a conscious choice. There is a need for more qualitative research to explore the reasons why students choose the Nursing Degree Program; moreover, to identify, from the beginning of the course, those students who are in crisis of motivation, in order to adopt support strategies that could\n\nJoint MS Degree Program between the Korea University of Technology and Education and the University of Kansas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDougherty, R. L.; Kim, Kwang Su\n\nThis paper provides an overview of the Joint MS Degree Program between Korea University of Technology and Educationâ s (KUT) Mechatronics Department and Kansas Universityâ s (KU) Mechanical Engineering Department. Discussions were initiated in early 2005 which resulted in a formal agreement being approved by both parties in mid-2007. The Joint MS Degree Program is composed of 30 semester credit hours, equally split between the two universities, with the actual degree being awarded by the institution at which the thesis work is performed. Issues addressed during the development of this Joint MS Program included: joint versus dual degrees, institutional acceptance of the transfer of fifteen hours of credit for an MS degree, different admissions requirements and procedures for the two institutions, financial support of the students, faculty advisors at each institution, Graduate Directors at each institution, transcript acknowledgement of the Joint Degree, residency requirements, English speaking requirements/abilities, thesis publication allowances/requirements, and time zone differences for virtual meetings. These issues have been addressed, and the Joint MS Degree Program is functioning with a small number of students having taken advantage of the opportunity since the Programâ s inception. Future considerations are: growing the number of students in the Program, expansion to other Departments besides KU-Mechanical Engineering and KUTMechatronics, including other universities in the Program, expansion to a Joint PhD Degree Program, and stronger funding resources.\n\nThe twelve-step recovery model of AA: a voluntary mutual help association.\n\nPubMed\n\nBorkman, Thomasina\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAlcoholism treatment has evolved to mean professionalized, scientifically based rehabilitation. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is not a treatment method; it is far better understood as a Twelve-Step Recovery Program within a voluntary self-help/mutual aid organization of self-defined alcoholics. The Twelve-Step Recovery Model is elaborated in three sections, patterned on the AA logo (a triangle within a circle): The triangle's legs represent recovery, service, and unity; the circle represents the reinforcing effect of the three legs upon each other as well as the \"technology\" of the sharing circle and the fellowship. The first leg of the triangle, recovery, refers to the journey of individuals to abstinence and a new \"way of living.\" The second leg, service, refers to helping other alcoholics which also connects the participants into a fellowship. The third leg, unity, refers to the fellowship of recovering alcoholics, their groups, and organizations. The distinctive AA organizational structure of an inverted pyramid is one in which the members in autonomous local groups direct input to the national service bodies creating a democratic, egalitarian organization maximizing recovery. Analysts describe the AA recovery program as complex, implicitly grounded in sound psychological principles, and more sophisticated than is typically understood. AA provides a nonmedicalized and anonymous \"way of living\" in the community and should probably be referred to as the Twelve-Step/Twelve Tradition Recovery Model in order to clearly differentiate it from professionally based twelve-step treatments. There are additional self-help/mutual aid groups for alcoholics who prefer philosophies other than AA.\n\nConstitutive behavior of as-cast AA1050, AA3104, and AA5182\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan Haaften, W. M.; Magnin, B.; Kool, W. H.; Katgerman, L.\n\n2002-07-01\n\nRecent thermomechanical modeling to calculate the stress field in industrially direct-chill (DC) cast-aluminum slabs has been successful, but lack of material data limits the accuracy of these calculations. Therefore, the constitutive behavior of three aluminum alloys (AA1050, AA3104, and AA5182) was determined in the as-cast condition using tensile tests at low strain rates and from room temperature to solidus temperature. The parameters of two constitutive equations, the extended Ludwik equation and a combination of the Sellars-Tegart equation with a hardening law, were determined. In order to study the effect of recovery, the constitutive behavior after prestraining at higher temperatures was also investigated. To evaluate the quantified constitutive equations, tensile tests were performed simulating the deformation and cooling history experienced by the material during casting. It is concluded that both constitutive equations perform well, but the combined hardening-Sellars-Tegart (HST) equation has temperature-independent parameters, which makes it easier to implement in a DC casting model. Further, the deformation history of the ingot should be taken into account for accurate stress calculations.\n\nPreparation of the Professional Athletic Trainer: A Descriptive Study of Undergraduate and Graduate Degree Programs.\n\nPubMed\n\nCavallario, Julie M; Van Lunen, Bonnie L\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe examination of the appropriate professional degree for preparation as an athletic trainer is of interest to the profession. Descriptive information concerning universal outcomes is needed to understand the effect of a degree change. To obtain and compare descriptive information related to professional athletic training programs and a potential degree change and to determine if any of these factors contribute to success on existing universal outcome measures. Cross-sectional study. Web-based survey. We contacted 364 program directors; 178 (48.9%; 163 undergraduate, 15 postbaccalaureate) responded. The survey consisted of 46 questions: 45 questions that dealt with 5 themes (institutional demographics [n = 13], program admissions [n = 6], program outcomes [n = 10], program design [n = 9], faculty and staff [n = 7]) and 1 optional question. Descriptive statistics for all programs were calculated. We compared undergraduate and postbaccalaureate programs by examining universal outcome variables. Descriptive statistics demonstrated that 33 programs could not support postbaccalaureate degrees, and a substantial loss of faculty could occur if the degree requirement changed (553 graduate assistants, 642 potentially underqualified instructors). Postbaccalaureate professional programs had higher 2011-2012 first-time Board of Certification (BOC) passing rates (U = 464.5, P = .001), 3-year aggregate first-time BOC passing rates (U = 451.5, P = .001), and employment rates for 2011-2012 graduates employed within athletic training (U = 614.0, P = .01). Linear multiple-regression models demonstrated that program and institution type contributed to the variance of the first-time BOC passing rates and the 3-year aggregate first-time BOC passing rates (P < .05). Students in postbaccalaureate athletic training programs performed better in universal outcome measures. Our data supported the concerns that this transition could result in the loss of some programs and an additional\n\nNegative Affect, Relapse, and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA): Does AA Work by Reducing Anger?*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKelly, John F.; Stout, Robert L.; Tonigan, J. Scott; Magill, Molly; Pagano, Maria E.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective: Anger and other indices of negative affect have been implicated in a stress-induced pathway to relapse. The Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) literature states that reduction of anger is critical to recovery, yet this proposed mechanism has rarely been investigated. Using lagged, controlled hierarchical linear modeling analyses, this study investigated whether AA attendance mobilized changes in anger and whether such changes explained AA-related benefit. Method: Alcohol-dependent adults (N = 1,706) receiving treatment as part of a clinical trial were assessed at intake and at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months. Results: Findings revealed substantially elevated levels of anger compared with the general population (98th percentile) that decreased over 15-month follow-up but remained high (89th percentile). AA attendance was associated with better drinking outcomes, and higher levels of anger were associated with heavier drinking. However, AA attendance was unrelated to changes in anger. Conclusions: Although support was not found for anger as a mediator, there was strong convergence between AA's explicit emphasis on anger and the present findings: Anger appears to be a serious, enduring problem related to relapse and heavy alcohol consumption. Methodological factors may have contributed to the lack of association between AA and anger, but results suggest that AA attendance alone may be insufficient to alleviate the suffering and alcohol-related risks specifically associated with anger.

The first Meeting of the Forum of University Teaching Staff in Pharmacy Degrees was held at the Faculty of Medicine in the Complutense University, Madrid, Spain on the 19(th) and 20(th) of November 2013. The meeting was attended by 17 lecturers. Participants brought their own teaching programs and were given two previous studies on public health competencies for analysis of public health contents and competencies in pharmacy degrees. Working groups were formed and the results were shared. The highest number of core competencies was identified in the following functions: \"Assessment of the population's health needs\" and \"Developing health policies\". The final program included basic contents organized into 8 units: Concept of Public Health, Demography, Epidemiological Method, Environment and Health, Food Safety, Epidemiology of Major Health Problems, Health Promotion and Education, and Health Planning and Management. Representation of almost all the Spanish Pharmacy Faculties and the consensus reached in the description of competences and program contents will greatly improve the quality of teaching in this area.

Management and leadership positions in federal and state healthcare agencies, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, retail pharmacies, academia and managed care organizations increasingly require the pharmaceutical knowledge obtained through a doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) degree combined with financial, organizational, and management skills. In these innovative positions, pharmacists are being called upon to assume responsibilities as executives and administrators in systems providing pharmacist care services to patients. To endow students with knowledge and skills required to perform the duties required in these decision-making positions, the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy has established 3 joint degree programs: the PharmD/Master of Business Administration (PharmD/MBA), PharmD/Master of Public Administration (PharmD/MPA), and PharmD/Master of Science in Economics (PharmD/MS).

In zebrafish, we have identified 10 genes in a new subfamily, CYP2AA, which does not show orthology to any human or other mammalian CYP genes. Here we report evolutionary and structural relationships of the 10 CYP2AA genes and expression of the first two genes, CYP2AA1 and CYP2AA2. Parsimony reconstruction of the tandem duplication pattern for the CYP2AA cluster suggests that CYP2AA1, CYP2AA2 and CYP2AA3 likely arose in the earlier duplication events and thus are most diverged in function from the other CYP2AAs.moreÂ Â» On the other hand, CYP2AA8 and CYP2AA9 are genes that arose in the latest duplication event, implying functional similarity between these two CYPs. A molecular model of CYP2AA1 showing the sequence conservation across the CYP2AA cluster reveals that the regions with the highest variability within the cluster map onto CYP2AA1 near the substrate access channels, suggesting differing substrate specificities. Zebrafish CYP2AA1 transcript was expressed predominantly in the intestine, while CYP2AA2 was most highly expressed in the kidney, suggesting differing roles in physiology. In the liver CYP2AA2 expression but not that of CYP2AA1, was increased by 1,4-bis [2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) and, to a lesser extent, by phenobarbital (PB). In contrast, pregnenolone 16Î±-carbonitrile (PCN) increased CYP2AA1 expression, but not CYP2AA2 in the liver. The results identify a CYP2 subfamily in zebrafish that includes genes apparently induced by PB-type chemicals and PXR agonists, the first concrete in vivo evidence for a PB-type response in fish. - Highlights: â¢ A tandemly duplicated cluster of ten CYP2AA genes was described in zebrafish. â¢ Parsimony and duplication analyses suggest pathways to CYP2AA diversity. â¢ Homology models reveal amino acid positions possibly related to functional diversity. â¢ The CYP2AA locus does not share\n\nDiversity of Graduates from Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral Degree Neuroscience Programs in the United States.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamos, Raddy L; AlviÃ±a, Karina; Martinez, Luis R\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe demography of United States graduates from science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) degree programs is well-understood; however, data particularly describing the gender and ethnic diversity of graduates of neuroscience programs has not been analyzed, limiting our knowledge of specific areas where diversity and fair representation are lacking. Using over 30 years of data from the National Center for Education Statistics, we documented the demography of neuroscience graduates from bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs. Recent graduation trends indicate greater numbers of female graduates from bachelor's and graduate degree programs. White (non-Hispanic) males and females represent the largest group of graduates while Asian/Pacific Islanders represent the largest non-White group of graduates. Although the number of underrepresented minorities graduating from neuroscience degree programs at every level has increased in recent years, they still lag compared to White (non-Hispanic) and Asian/Pacific Islanders. These data provide valuable information that can be used to promote greater diversity among neuroscience graduates by higher education faculty and administrators and federal funding agencies.\n\nLaw-Based Degree Programs in Business and Their Departments: What's in a Name?
