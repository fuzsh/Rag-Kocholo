These products—resorts, information technology cam¬ puses, retail chains, golf courses, ports, and other enclave formations—are fa¬ miliar commercial formulas that index the world by marketing or scheduling protocols, thus presumably avoiding the political inconveniences of location. They are generally considered to be the Teflon formats of neoliberal enter¬ prises. Architects often treat them as banal or unresponsive to recognized sys¬ tems of architectural language, and indeed, architecture is, for these formats, often only a by-product of data and logistics. Yet, when adopted by rogue na¬ tions, cults, diplomats, and other impresarios, even the most perfunctory spa¬ tial products are imbued with myths, desires, and symbolic capital. They may gain entry into any situation. Freighted with desires, sporting their global cur¬ rency and their duty-free legalities, they can slither through jurisdictional shal¬ lows. They can become political pawns, as objects of desire and contention in negotiations between warring countries, messy democracies, and violent dis¬ tended conflict. Effective as a solvent of differences, the hilarious and danger¬ ous masquerades of retail, business, or trade often mix quite easily with the cunning of political platforms. Moreover, their recipes for organization are also recipes for political constitution, and the disposition of that organization em¬ bodies a capacity for collusion, persuasion, and aggression. Architecture presumably has more to learn than to teach in the study of global politics. As the warm pools for new urban contagions, however, these real estate cocktails are also critical materializations of digital capitalism. A special kind of architectural research may contribute to global studies some vivid evidence of another set of mechanisms, perhaps as telling as financial\n\nIntroduction\n\nand political indicators in characterizing the market’s weakness, resilience, or violence. This book collects six stories of spatial products and their political mis¬ adventures. For instance, one of its segments visits tourism in North Korea, while another visits high-tech agricultural formations in Spain that have re¬ ignited labor wars and piracy in the Mediterranean. A third segment compares fantastic forms of sovereignty in commercial and spiritual organizations, and a fourth looks at automated global ports. The shape of microwave urbanism in IT enclaves in South Asia and the Middle East, and the global industry of sub¬ tracting buildings, are two more subjects.\n\nSpatial Products\n\nDifferent from the deliberately authored building envelope, spatial products substitute spin, logistics, and management styles for considerations of loca¬ tion, geometry, or enclosure. The architect and salesman of such things as golf resorts or container ports is a new orgman.1 Fie designs the software for new games of spatial production to be played the same way whether in Texas or Taiwan. The coordinates of this software are measured not in latitude and lon¬ gitude but in the orgman argot of acronyms and stats—in annual days of sun¬ shine, ocean temperatures, flight distances, runway noise restrictions, the time needed for a round of golf, time needed for a shopping spree, TEUs, layovers, numbers of passengers, bandwidth, time zones, and labor costs.2 Data streams are the levers of spatial manipulation, and the orgman has a frontier enthusi¬ asm for this abstract territory. He derives a pioneering sense of creation from matching a labor cost, a time zone, and a desire to generate distinct forms of urban space, even distinct species of global city. Logistical spatial products make vivid the fact that architecture is a the¬ ater of activity, as that word is used in the military to express the consequential sequencing of organizations, activities, claims, and exchanges. Manuel Castells claimed that the “culture that matters ior the constitution and development of a given economic system is the one that materializes in organizational logics”— what Felix Guattari might have called the “techno-scientific semiotics” that are stored in the operational strata of organization and practice.3 Architecture is a technology—the medium ol an open platform storing both structure and con-\n\nIntroduction\n\ntent. The information it stores, as both data and persuasion, is literally a prod¬ uct, property, or currency. Yet global familiars such as resorts, enclaves, and repetitive commercial formats are made no less hyperbolic, volatile, and extravagant by abstraction. Elaborate costumes and stylistic affectations are often treated as the window dressing for a product that supposedly achieves neutrality by operating as a rev¬ enue envelope. Fiction and myth are, in this case, especially slippery, dispos¬ able, and comedic for the very reason that absolute meaning may finally be measured only in revenues or the techniques of “market science.” Charged with no responsibility for historical or political reconciliation, the product’s ersatz myths may be even more extreme. However familiar these spaces may be, the mixology between cocktails and cultural attributes may create territory that is at once strange and intimate, exposed and in disguise, real and fictional. As lubricating agents of a market, spatial products are usually presumed to be innocent of involvement in the extreme spaces of war. Yet even the most banal space has been a military target, acting as an apparatus or a provocation of aggression. Moreover, the architecture of warfare evident in detention camps, military bases, and border crossings is eerily similar to our own famil¬ iar offshore real estate cocktails, with their devices for security and territorial conquest. Like any camp or zone of conflict, the next free trade zone, data haven, tax shelter, or residential golf development seeks immunity as an ex¬ ceptional condition, a legal lacuna or island entitled to special sovereignty and exemption from law. Giorgio Agamben’s argument that the camp is a place of legal exception or lawlessness becomes all the more compelling when he also argues that this condition can be naturalized or stabilized as a political para¬ digm that reappears in the “zones d’attentes of our airports and certain out¬ skirts of our cities.”4 A strange political content harbors in the world’s familiar cyberpoles, technopoles, and agripoles—air-conditioned Dubais and Jebel Alls of the architectural soul. The classic indicators of political contention may not be effective in exposing their disguises. They ideally exist in a self-reflexive politi¬ cal quarantine. Yet attempts to secure political exemption may, paradoxically, land an organization in the crosshairs of the conflict they thought they had banished.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\nWorlds\n\nSpatial products aspire to establish worlds or global regimes—domains of logic that are given franchise to expand their territory with nonnational sovereignty. Marc Auge writes about “contemporaneous worlds” as the “tightly woven, complex fabric of contemporaneity”—a global cultural current, expertise, or habit such as the fashion world or the sports world. The “worlds” we create, as Auge writes, are constantly “recomposed,” expressing “all at once the singu¬ larity that constitutes them and the universality that relativizes them.” Arjun Appadurai writes about “imagined worlds” as “the multiple worlds that are constituted by the historically situated imaginations of persons and groups spread around the globe.” The mixtures of worlds, as Appadurai describes them, create variegated “scapes,” such as “mediascapes” and “ethnoscapes.”5 Natural¬ izing the migration and negotiation of traveling cultural forms allows these thinkers to avoid impossible constructs about an authentic locality. The stories in this book build on such intelligence to discuss, among other things, the worlds of tourism, high-tech agriculture, shipping, or retail, but they offer a less genial view of these regimes, focusing not on their blending but on their fierce segregation. The orgmen viceroys of individual worlds conquer both ephemeral and stable territories on land, on the ocean, and in the air, with classic intentions to accumulate wealth. For instance, the spatial products of tourism territorialize a belt of median air and water temperatures. Those of high-tech agriculture oc¬ cupy a sea of photosynthesis, annexing locations with abundant sunshine and wind direction. Pools of satellite microwaves or resources including water, oil, and natural gas are also coveted or embattled territories. These belts of special conditions constitute volatile, nonnational spaces that move around the world like weather fronts on airborne, landed, or maritime currents. In a sense, each world sails its own sea. Its boundaries are taut and strong, but also elastic and [see Seas]\n\nfluid to facilitate the quiet acquisition of yet more territory. World is a plural condition. There is no one world—only many worlds. Worlds share no single logic, but proliferate as multiple monotheisms of retail or trade in a totemic market.6 They maintain their logics, fictions, and bound¬ aries by limiting and excluding information—remaining righteous and pure. Worlds aspire to be perfect utopias, singular domains attempting to coerce\n\nIntroduction\n\ncompliance and compatibility from anything foreign to them. With either evangelism or subterfuge, the orgman must expand into new territory by re¬ formatting its bytes, containers, ships, and infrastructures for compatibility. The boundaries expand and exclude, extend and tighten, allowing the world to increase in size but not necessarily in diversity or intelligence. Whatever the claims of globalizing connectivity, these stories find more traction in the territory where multiple worlds collide. This is the space of mobile stretchy firewalls and insulation—the space of uneven developments, fences, and stratification, or the space of friction and logical fallout between segregated regimes.7\n\nBelievers and Cheaters\n\nRegimes or worlds of righteous belief are easy to find. Righteousness is a form of violence that most people cultivate. In marriages, families, professions, na¬ tions, and other consortiums of power, we are often in the process of recoding worrisome contradictory information to conform to our own story, our theo¬ retical beliefs, the operational lore of our profession. The Bill Gates of our own milieu, we require all other things to be compatible to our format. We respin a little fragment of gossip, secrete or limit information to make ourselves whole. Regimes and domains on all scales decide what will constitute infor¬ mation and what contradictions will simply be eliminated. They change the law that protects someone’s dwelling or put a population in a microwave shadow. Bristling with security systems and intelligence-gathering devices, the regime is hungry for information, but it prefers to recognize only compatible information that reinforces its innocence and righteousness. In this solipsistic lockdown, information-rich becomes information-poor. To desire a state of monism and purity: this is the violence of remaining intact. Nevertheless, the more righteous and innocent the regime, the more necessary it is to cheat. Although it is trying to maintain only its own infor¬ mation, its own traditions, and its own security, the organization often needs additional help. A world requires both an evil enemy to make it appear just, and an unacknowledged “extra” to keep it alive. Husbands and wives feel en¬ titled to an extra wife or husband. The European Union needs younger people to counter its aging population. Banks need another, more pliable currency\n\n4\n\n5\n\nIntroduction\n\nthan the regulated one they have. Corporations need an offshore shelter for their money. And everyone needs cheap labor. The righteousness of the believer, the confidence games of the cheater, or any oscillation between the two are all successful strategies. All can elude their day of reckoning. For the believer there is only the tautology of belief— a fairy tale, uncluttered by details. The believer fights only “just” and righteous wars. For the cheater, there are so many lies that the reckoning can find no place to begin. Ironically, the continual proliferation of masquerades and fictions is essential to the life and refreshment of the originally attractive myth. Of course, the cheater’s repertoire of masquerades and shifting stories often in¬ cludes several versions of the believer himself. The stone-cold bluff of the liar and the sunny elegiac aphorism of the believer are both more successful than measure or reason—for as long as they can fill the air and use political consen¬ sus or decree to evade consequences.\n\nDisposition\n\nIn the entrenched wars between righteous worlds, the submission of one world to another, or the aggression of lawlessness and cheating, constitute an agency that is reflected in organizational structure. Market data and organizational protocol attend not just functionalist endeavors and economic imperatives, but also behaviors or postures. Just as one might evaluate the reactivity or volatility of a chemical mixture, one might evaluate the disposition embedded in an or¬ ganization’s arrangement. The spatial cocktails in these stories mix, in peculiar and sometimes ef¬ fortless ways, with political protocols and politicized economic agendas, as what Pierre Bourdieu has called “symbolic capital.”8 Bourdieu identified cul¬ tural practices in which special gestures or disguises were used to enhance the value or status of exchanges and rituals in culture. Similarly, Scott Lash’s dis¬ tinction between the “lighter symbols” of semiotics and the “heavy symbols” embedded in practices identifies heavy symbols as components of an elaborate cultural language that exists in an active condition.9 Spatial products act not only as glyph or monument to an overt political text, but as heavy information that becomes a nuanced, unexpressed subtext of action or practice. Just as an expression in dialogue is a trace of an action, and nothing like the sentence one\n\nIntroduction\n\nwould find in prose, so the heavy symbol has the cultural responsibilities of lan¬ guage in another register. It is not langue but parole, or, following Giorgio Agamben, we might understand it as “face”—word on the threshold of action. It communicates not as noun but as verb, as gesture or glyph of action.10 It is about—taking Gilbert Ryle’s distinction—“knowing how rather than know¬ ing that.”11 Spatial products perhaps resist semiotics but offer other precise ex¬ pressions of value and exchange stored in arrangement and presence. The organization of these spaces also possesses disposition. One test of organizational disposition is a willingness to accept error or contradictory in¬ formation. The stories in this book speculate about organizations that are more robust and resilient when they are information-rich and more weak, rigid, or explosive when they are information-poor. They borrow some additional terms from Gregory Bateson to make further distinctions. Bateson often used the terms symmetrical, complementary, and reciprocal to characterize organiza¬ tion, and to link organizational architecture and behavior. For Bateson, a sym¬ metrical relationship described an escalating rivalry and mimicry between two parties: twins fighting for supremacy. A complementary relationship described submission and recognition of hierarchies between parties: a beta dog kneeling before an alpha dog. Both symmetrical and complementary relationships could generate a fragile stability, but both also excluded information to maintain their order, and so could also sponsor rivalry, insurgency, or violence. A reciprocal relationship, on the other hand, neutralized an escalating symmetry or a hier¬ archical submission by surrendering interest in the fight, multiplying both enemies and friends, and entering into a more complex web of cooperative en¬ gagements.12 Reciprocal relations could counter symmetrical entrenchment with cooperative structures, avoiding warfare that would arrest a vital flow of exchanges. In Bateson’s terms, the believer would assume a symmetrical en¬ trenchment, and the cheater would often oscillate between symmetrical and reciprocal dispositions. If organization, as reflected in architecture and urbanism, possesses disposition, the means to aggress or collude, it may also be an adversary or a competitor. It may be brittle or stretchy. Its software or hardware is capable of political manipulation or violence, and also capable of storing or unleashing this agency in its inception, planning, and building as well as its occupation.\n\n6\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs it mixes with overt or covert lawlessness, architecture possesses the means to war.\n\nResistance\n\nGiven the sweetness and sentimentality that often accompany power, whether that of the believer or the cheater, the stories that comprise this book assume that motives, however different, may use similar devices and disguises, and that effective activism will now rarely look like classic resistance. Rather resistance may come cloaked in its opposite, just as capital can be cloaked in the cos¬ tumes of resistance. Within the intractable logics of tautological worlds and the games they play to extend their currency, the masquerades of market, state, and resistance alternately blur and resolve into crisp masks. Capital’s contra¬ dictions are not the ultimate details that initiate a new utopia. Rather, they are the ingredients that make capital more robust or more lithe by providing either new information or fresh masquerades. Similarly, the various masquerades of resistance need not correspond to those of a tragic counterculture with its prin¬ cipled self-valorizations—righteous dispositions they share with war. Instead, resistance may find another set of switches and toggles with the potential for political manipulation. A consideration of segregated worlds resists the monism lurking in many theories of global politics, those of the radical as well as those of the neolib¬ eral. The totalizing theories of Marx seem to induce mimicry—epic world sys¬ tem organums portraying a monolithic spectacle, market, or empire. Hardt and Negri’s Empire is only one, recent text that demonstrates this philo¬ sophical habit of mind, suggesting, at times, the possibility of something approaching univocal, although not classically Marxist, political upheaval. The Debordian spectacle is taken to its logical ultimate. Yet however nourish¬ ing these critiques of the pervasive market spectacle may be, the stories in this book do not focus on the market’s monolithic holism. Nor do they portray a resistance that can heroically match the purity of modernism. They explore instead the backstage networks that Bruno Latour has called “the un¬ conscious of the moderns”—the space of mediation rather than the space of the singular or pure.13 They join Arjun Appadurai in finding world system epics to be “inadequately quirky” theories of global development.14 They\n\nThe stories collected here resist several forms of monism that have attracted archi¬\n\nOnly the Many\n\ntecture culture. Monism certainly attends the search for the one transcendent Godgiven idea or, in the absence of God, the attempt to reason toward the unifying theory or the true mechanics of nature. Yet a secret desire for the one and only may also ap¬ pear in the competition between immanent ideas. In the fabled profile of the avantgarde, for instance, intelligence must be successive rather than coexistent. Identifying the tendency to purification that attends transcendent modernism, Bruno Latour de¬ scribes those avant-garde campaigns which are \"obsessed with the construction of one immanence or the destruction of another.\"15 Each manifesto must kill the previ¬ ous manifesto, project the new utopia, and pose for a group photo. It must be the one. Architects perhaps secretly long for monism, for the chance to gather the world onto a single sheet of paper and control it with geometry, be that geometry epigenetic or Euclidean. Architecture has often adopted those cybernetic scripts that focus on recursivity and predictability in complexity, as well as those Deleuzian scripts that, drained of their politics, reinforce the preexisting attraction to geometry. As it deploys digital tools, the discipline has often not focused on the active network of which these digital tools are a part—a network that has embedded itself into our bodies and mar¬ kets, and all the other places in the world where people are dying, fighting, and mak¬ ing money. These territories would never provide demonstrations of connectedness and synergistic feedback. Rather, the discipline has focused on the imaging that ap¬ pears on the screen. The screen dramatizes our geometric manipulations and software domains. In a sense, the discipline has privileged the front of the computer rather than the back of the computer—the screen rather than the network. The stories collected here investigate the backstage of digital capital that materializes on the network side of the computer. They look at the germs, errors, pirates, and exceptions that make holisms, homologies, and universal impossible. Be¬ lief in their existence or nonexistence is irrelevant to a potentially productive focus, not on purification and refinement but on translation and multiplication. This focus favors the partial and incremental, exceeding the strictly formal or semiotic to enter the organizational and political strata of space-making. The stories and contempla¬ tions are about the many-not the one, or the one and the many, but only the many. They multiply worlds. Multiply logics. No Empire, but empires. No global village, but global villages. No one world, but many segregated worlds.\n\n8\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\npresent no singular logic, but rather the evidence of rich contradictions and multiple logics. Spatial products provide evidence of what Lash and Urry have called “disorganized capitalism”: capitalism disaggregated or disorganized from its modernist or anticipated alignments.16 The stories are curious about another degree of deviance, duplicity, or cheating present in the mix. Attracted, as they are, to things epic, architectural discourses on global¬ ization have also remained inadequately quirky, embracing the dream of “one world” of globally legible boutique hotels and entertainments. Too often, the discussion still circles around questions of center and periphery, looking for ev¬ idence of a domineering modernism or postmodernism pushing its ecumeni¬ cal sign on an authentic locality that must be preserved. Equally conservative is the portrayal of a ro/tworld of connectivity that constantly, but only gently, learns and adjusts, providing the illusion of differentiation in recursivity, nat¬ uralizing the market with a redemptive overlay of complexity. In this portrayal, architecture is often only a servant to worlds where catastrophes, errors, or negations are in the family of the whole, where corporate contrition kills with a masquerade of kindness, and where we are all drops of water in globalization’s many maritime metaphors. The material collected here should, then, nourish a special kind of polit¬ ical imagination and ingenuity. Political practices often gravitate to one of several well-rehearsed roles: the earnest public servant, the political theorist, or the strident activist. Given the failures of some of these principled political stances to engage with more disorganized or elusive forms of political sub¬ terfuge, this book describes not only the classic political stance that declares its name in a democratic process, but also other politics that rely on fiction or corruption. Relinquishing the architect’s monologue of sincerity and inno¬ cence, it studies the ethical masquerades ol the double agent or nonbeliever who uses multiple personae to engage the market’s confidence games and pat¬ terns of cheating. The orgman’s territorial parameters reinforce a belief in the possibility of optimization and error elimination. Spatial products that attempt to avoid po¬ litical entanglements also attempt to avoid error. Yet that belief often results in a much more massive failure or error. This space of naturally occurring er¬ rors and loopholes is political territory. Error is mined in the areas of intoler-\n\nIntroduction\n\nance, logical exception, and organizational fallout that result from the collisions of worlds. In this discussion, the word “error” refers specifically to the naturally occurring extrinsic information. Error is the germ that adds additional mate¬ rial to the pool, or mutates an existing sequence of instructions. It provides the additional information, the learning that extends the intelligence of the or¬ ganization. As extrinsic information, error might be a means of penetration or resistance—the means of altering an organization by remote or ricochet.\n\n[see Error]\n\nPiracy is a useful construct here—one that yields a continuum of char¬ acters from the privateer and military entrepreneur to the terrorist and mur¬ derer: enough variations on the confidence game to provide reflections of diplomats, viceroys, orgmen, and elected officials. This book proffers a pro¬ ductive piracy in which an additional set of regulators, wild cards, and fictions, loaded with unorthodox powers, become tools for practitioners sensitive to the political composition of an urban landscape. Architecture articulates these complex mixtures of latent political postures and economic agendas. Finally, carte blanche relies on a collection of guises or masquerades, any one of which can be used to suit an episode in the confidence game. The multiplication of fiction that manages to mask or neutralize a sense of consequences may also identify a condition that is susceptible to comedy and mischief, or penetrable to another masquerade.\n\n[see Pirate]\n\nStories Hoping to model its premise in its own organization, this book avoids the structure of a litigious, corrective proof, an exercise in academic ventriloquy, or a three-part Presbyterian sermon on the logics of a political theology. The jour¬ nalistic travelogue or the encyclopedic compendium of discoveries are not ap¬ propriate templates either.17 The six stories collected here offer not a totalizing theory about world systems but, rather, critical evidence arranged with the help of storytelling techniques. Emphasizing the political instrumentality of fic¬ tion, spin, and error in culture, this “footnoted fiction,” or “faction,” persuades and theorizes by sequencing facts and orchestrating voices so that supposition meets its contradiction, gravity and frivolity share space, and piety appears next to a broad gaffe.\n\n10\n\n11\n\niratical Architecture\n\nArchitecture-the discipline often assumes-is innocent, and therefore not an activ¬ ity like that of all the other pirates of both Empire and counter-Empire. Yet it is typi¬ cally considered to be a conservative profession, involved in fortifying the very worlds under discussion here. It even seeks the same political immunity. Architects are not trained to pirate, except in the service of their own careers. Multiple voices, tactics, and political craft are deployed in self-promotion. When typecast in its customary tragicomic roles, the discipline often reinforces the boundaries of its own world-its own autonomy as an art form within which to write monologues that preserve its integrity. Architecture has well-developed techniques for parsing the lighter glyphs of ar¬ chitectural semiotics cast in geometry and idiom. The discipline is, however, less ac¬ customed to parsing the \"heavy symbols\" of activity and disposition. With what seems like self-parody, an architect might even work to reify the datastreams of the orgman with geometric constructions that make it possible to represent these landscapes with an enclosure. Beyond the light language of appearance is a heavy language stored in the operational strata of the assembly. The discipline not only employs information technology, it is information technology with political affect independent of enclo¬ sure. Relinquishing the guise of sincerity or applying the duplicitous craft of career¬ ism to the actual business of making space requires an expertise that insists on never knowing enough. Responsibility for Empire's often grisly atrocities may not necessar¬ ily be an act of righteousness, but only another seduction. This book considers archi¬ tects to be seafaring, satellite-faring, data-faring organizers of territory who might be at least as effective as orgmen in manipulating the comedies and fictions of the mar¬ ketplace. A piratical architecture does not evaluate the integrity of expression or the regrettable urge to reform. It intervenes in the patterns of believers and cheaters, eval¬ uating the ability of masquerades to leverage change.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn addition to the stories, three contemplations, titled Seas, Error, and Pirate, provide a more speculative substrate for the spatial and political phe¬ nomena encountered in the stories. While they are interspersed with the sto¬ ries, they may be read in any order, alone or in an alternating sequence with the stories. Each examines agency and mechanism in organization, and each is in some way another side of the other—with similar but ramifying philosophical intersections. Just as organizations share compatibilities, such as the dimen¬ sions of a container, an annual temperature, or a labor cost, so these stories are cross-referenced, often by means of a stray detail. For these indexed moments, the material resists the micro-regime of the narrative, and may continue into another story or contemplation with an echo or a repetition. Each story, each tale of a political island, also has its own island, its own offshore subplot that appears as a parallel text. The evidence comes not from texts that track the project of architecture for and within the discipline, but rather from more unusual, often ephemeral sources. Internal debate within any discipline—whether in architecture, cul¬ tural studies, or politics—can nurture new theories and terms. Yet these terms can also hibernate there, unchallenged by the extremes of the ordinary, by worlds far more hyperbolic than any of the ordained fictions of logical think¬ ing. Not the literature of our own society but a wire service for the Korea Times, statistical tallies for port organizations, global TV, or the orgman’s office jokes and market-tracking softwares are the architectural texts for mil¬ lions of acres of buildings and infrastructures around the world. The stories look at the anatomy of organizations, their self-promotion, global web chatter, and collision with political events. However contemporary the material, it is usually an echo of common, sometimes ancient, swindles and fantasies. The accounts provide emotional and hilarious evidence of architectural aspirations that only eventually involve the discipline. Space is undoubtedly a pawn in this fragile divide between war and piracy. The stories suggest that architecture may find its opportunity, its gravity, and even its seduction not in the style pages, but in the runaway fictions of the news wires and international pages. Archi¬ tecture may have no choice but to find its politics—to counter innocence with ingenuity.\n\n12\n\n13\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe camp as dislocating localization is the hidden matrix of the politics in which we are still living, and it is this structure of the camp that we must learn to recognize in all its metamorphoses into the zones d’attentes of our airports and certain outskirts of our cities. —Giorgio Agamben18\n\nIf you turn round suddenly, as in the childrens game “Mother, may II, ’’they will freeze, looking innocent, as if they hadn’t budged; here, on the left, are things themselves; there, on the right, is the free society of speaking, thinking subjects, values and of signs.

It is the unthinkable, the unconscious of the moderns. —Bruno Latourlc>\n\nDPRK\n\nOn board the love boat.

Tourism maintains a Vatican-like state-within-a-state offering political asylum, internal escape, and immunity to all those converts who recognize and endorse its images. Whatever their location, resort formulas will deliver a profit in territories with abundant sunshine, pale sand, and an average temperature of nineteen degrees Celsius. The cruise ship is tourism’s paramilitary enforcer. Sailing on a sea of favorable conditions, the fleet of conquest looks for sover¬ eignty over a mobile market share that is much more valuable than solid turf. Spatial products of tourism are designed to freely conquer territory that is un¬ encumbered by the inconveniences of politics. Yet the same fantasies and fic¬ tions they deploy possess an ancient political instrumentality. Tourism, arriving late to the world’s last remaining Cold War sites, pro¬ vides a broad cartoon of this political instrumentality. In countries like Viet¬ nam and Cuba, tourism has landed even on the very battle lines of previous conflicts. Perhaps the most extreme of these stories surrounds the I Love Cruise and the Kumgang resort in North Korea. The first reports about the I Love Cruise in newspapers and websites in 1998 told a tale both vaguely familiar and hyperbolically fictional, filled with the circumstantial detail and non sequiturs that often become predestined events\n\n[see Seas]\n\nDPRK\n\nin fairy stories. According to these reports, Hyundai’s cruise ship departed from the South Korean port of Tonghae and traveled through international waters toward the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea)—the northern half of the peninsula that is black in nighttime satellite photographs, its shape perfectly outlined by the lights of adjacent countries that possess adequate electricity. Sometime before dawn, when the on-board karaoke and Siberian dancing girls shut down for the night, North Korean warships escorted the vessel into the military port of Changjon, just north of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Changjon is the closest port to Mount Kumgang, Korea’s spiritual equivalent of Mount Fuji, unseen by South Koreans since 1945.2 Passengers, dressed in outdoor gear, then disembarked for four days to consume a package of hiking tours, spa treatments, and shopping in a newly erected resort. From the windows of the tour buses that ferried them around, they could just see over the walls and barbed-wire fences lining the compound to the failing agricultural villages and prefabricated houses beyond. A complex of buildings—including a domed theater where the Pyongyang circus per¬ forms, and a shopping center—offered the tourists a new line of North Korean products, including an ant liquor designed to cure impotence. The floating Hotel Haekumgang, moored near the cruise ship, accommodated guests in the evening. To prevent North Koreans from seeing the resort, all of the workers serving the tourists, except for a few guides, were ethnic Koreans from China. Hiking tours in the mountains visited spectacular falls, peaks, and seascapes. Tour guides and military personnel were stationed at two-kilometer intervals along the walls and hiking routes, their hairdos frozen in mid-century.3 The I Love Cruise was just the first step in an ongoing negotiation of tourism between North and South Korea. Kim Jong II, “Respected and Beloved General’ of North Korea’s oxymoronic communist dynasty, and Chung Ju Yung, head of the South’s Hyundai chaebol initiated this tourist enterprise in 1998 under the auspices of the South’s Sunshine Policy for reunification. (The Tongil Group, a company controlled by the Moonies of the Unification Church, initially wanted to establish a ski resort in the North and was an early competitor with Hyundai.)4 More telling details of the fairy tale: In a special proviso of the initial Kumgang deal, Kim Jong 11 and his top officials requested from Hyundai thirty thousand 25-inch color television sets, newly branded with a “Kumgansan-\n\nDPRK\n\nMt. Kumgang” label, thus disguising their identity as South Korean products.5 Among the fleet of cruise ships was the original Island Princess that appeared in the Love Boat television series.6 By 2005, ski resorts, golf courses, conference centers, sports facilities, and IT campuses mixed with theme parks, and a Sea World-style aquarium, were to stretch from Mount Kumgang all along the eastern seaboard to Mount Paektu, and were to attract 1,500,000 tourist per year.7 All of these programs were to be supported by airports, roads, and rail lines. Hyundai’s strangely laconic architectural renderings evoked not contemporary Las Vegas-style resorts, but Disneyland or world’s fair expositions populated by Cold War Hilton-style hotels and corporate high-rises. Hyundai was to pay the DPRK $942 million over a period of six years for the exclusive rights to develop the tourist project—money that would be¬ come the North’s single largest source of income.8 The money was ostensibly to prop up the depleted economy, but some have speculated that it went to a Hong Kong bank account for a party organization called “Bureau 39,” making North Korea’s ruling elite the chief beneficiaries.9 Like the special economic zone at Rajin-Sonbong north of Mount Paektu near Russia, and the casinos in the capital, Pyongyang, the cruise would be considered a cash cow for the state. Gambling deliriously with enormous losses, Hyundai ran it for three years until finally negotiating a shorter and less expensive overland route through the Demilitarized Zone, a route that finally replaced the cruise. It now projects the same ambitious plans onto a new agree¬ ment with the North that establishes Mount Kumgang as a special tourist zone permitting, among other things, casinos.10 All along the hiking routes, carved into the mountain and written into the scripts of the tour guides, are the poems of Kim Jong II and the aphorisms of Juche, North Korea’s philosophy of self-reliance. Juche combines the polit¬ ical dictates of Stalinism with Confucian traditions and the general outlines of missionary Christianity. Kim Jong IPs father, Kim II Sung, received some of his education from missionary Christians, and Juche served as his substitute for Stalinist-Leninist dogma when, as a rebel in the north, he was allied with the Soviets. Juche is the philosophy of an zz^tr-utopia, an absolute condition, a political tautology. Its perfection inspires both agitated joy and righteous¬ ness. While many analysts have characterized Juche as a kind of cult, it may be\n\n16\n\n17\n\nDPRK\n\n1.1 The Island Princess, once featured on the\n\nLove Boat television series, joined Hyundai's fleet of cruise ships for the / Love Cruise.

The tenor of the devotion shared by citizens of the DPRK has been likened to that of fundamentalist Christianity.11 Containing violent content in a gentle pious cadence, Juche’s motivational aphorisms coached the North Koreans through their recent episodes of grinding poverty and famine, encouraging limited rations and even suicide as a means of supporting the military and the ruling elite.12 In the years since the tour began, four thousand large plaques com¬ memorating such things as a poem by Kim Jong II or a Juche aphorism have been installed on the mountain. Hyundai has renovated the old tourist hotel, and the tourist compound now includes Gucci and Prada stores.13 The Mount Kumgang website used to feature a cruise ship. Now it features images of hip older tourists wearing credentials around their necks, a young woman in resort gear expressing wonder, a shoreline filling with colorful inflatables, and a set of Mount Kumgang scenic bankcards.14 New additions to the tour include danc¬ ing bears in fuzzy costumes, as well as polystyrene tigers placed in the moun¬ tains and polystyrene bears that appear to fish in ponds. As a recent group completed their tour, the staff expressed its farewells by singing along to a loud¬ speaker broadcast of the Everly Brothers song “Bye Bye Love.”15\n\nProduce one bullet for our guns by sacrificing one chicken. —Juche aphorism16\n\nSelf-detonating explosion demands a resolute and pathetic decision.

Image cour¬ tesy Hyundai-Asan.\n\nDPRK\n\nThe I Love Cruise and the plans for tourist projects it sponsored are global hand¬ shakes synchronizing the disparate logics of shamanism, communism, Confu¬ cianism, neo-Christian mythology, Juche, and capitalism. A country in need of food, roads, electricity, telephones, or up-to-date factories has, in this deal, skipped over the great body of free-market practices to a peculiarly comfort¬ able recognition of the most familiar spectacles of global commerce. Bargain¬ ing with the extrapolitical territory of the free trade zones, casinos, airports, and cruise ships is now within the repertoire of rogue nations as well as transna¬ tional corporations. North Korea now uses not only nuclear weapons as pawns of extortion and brinkmanship but also a special pirate space with its own tem¬ porary amnesties from socialist principles. Although they may still dramatize production with the mid-twentieth century heroics of the industrial or agri¬ cultural worker, both Koreas have transferred their faith to the tourist, the gam¬ bler, and the information specialist. They have discovered the resort and the IT campus as new factories of production. This comfort with laundered identities and forbidden desires is due not simply to the fact that Kim Jong II watches a lot of TV and video, although he does. He has a satellite dish that allows him access to Japanese, American, and South Korean TV shows, like MTV or CNN, and cartoons including Donald Duck, Tom and Jerry, and Bugs Bunny. Super Mario Brothers is a favorite video game, and Paul Anka a favorite among many musicians.20 Yet the phenomenon of the Mount Kumgang tour may have less to do with neoliberal naturalizing of the spectacle and more to do with compatibility, even attraction, between fictions, delusions, and fetishes in the fairy tales of both communism and cap¬ italism—fairy tales in which tourism and landscape are active solvents.\n\nThe more I examined my data, the more inescapable became my conclusion that tourist attractions are an unplanned typology of structure that provides direct access to the mod¬ ern consciousness or “world view, ” that tourist attractions are precisely analogous to the religious symbolism of primitive peoples. —Dean MacCannell1'1\n\nBiographical sketches of Kim Jong II and Chung Ju Yung contribute more fic¬ tions to the mix—not only vestigial Cold War legends of competition between\n\n20\n\n21\n\nDPRK\n\ncapitalist and socialist logics of production, but new mystical content tran¬ scending those anachronistic cults of modernity. As if designed for the con¬ venience of this collaboration, the tourist area under consideration in Kongwon Province, and the range of mountains from Mount Kumgang to Mount Paektu in the northernmost part of the country, constitute sacred ter¬ ritory for both Kim Jong II and Chung Ju Yung. Both rely on persuasive narra¬ tives about a larger enveloping nature with the spiritual power to overcome political differences. Kim Jong II was chosen “by acclamation” to succeed his father Kim II Sung, whose birth in 1912 marked the beginning of the “Juche era.” There are several versions of the legend, but as one version goes, when Kim Jong II was born, a swallow appeared to an elderly man to tell him of the birth of a great general, and three stars led the world to a cabin at Mount Paektu, where the in¬ fant was discovered.22 Kim Jong II was really born in a Soviet camp in the north, where his father was fighting against the Japanese. Kim II Sung joined forces with other Chinese guerillas and Russian rebels. His bravery and charismatic leadership later prompted the Soviets to name him a leader in Pvonyang. His son, Kim Jong II, is called a “contemporary God.”23 Yet, for all of the official North Korean reports of his heroic feats and brilliant books, there are also re¬ ports of an eccentric reclusive life, often spent in pajamas, playing with his col¬ lection of music boxes or attending to the children who live in his house.24 The Kumgang tour guides, however, typically refer to the beatific presence of their leader, the “Sun of the Twenty-first Century” and successor to the “Eternal President,” who is forced to stand alone against countries like the United States and Japan.25 The north is also the hallowed birthplace of Hyundai’s Chung Ju Yung. Often cast as a Horatio Alger of sorts, he grew up in poverty in northern Ko¬ rea, and then assumed the role of the quintessential self-made opportunist in postwar Korea. The kinds of industries and organizations that Chung planned for the North reflect both old and new notions of globalization. Like a mid¬ century capitalist, he developed successful automobile enterprises, but as a new orgman of globalization logistics he also led Hyundai into the twenty-first cen¬ tury with ship-building ventures aimed at a global container trade. When he led five hundred head of cattle across the Demilitarized Zone during the famine, it seemed that his proprietary attitude toward the North mixed phi-\n\nDPRK\n\nlanthropy and statesmanship with capitalist ambitions of colonizing the sister state, and exploiting its resources and cheap labor. A new biographical on-line museum displays two thousand items collected from Chung’s frugal life, in¬ cluding several pairs of shoes (with holes) that he wore for fifteen years.26 Hyundai has many unrealized plans for infrastructure and manufactur¬ ing that will exploit cheap North Korean labor and resources. For instance, part of the initial Kumgang deal would have permitted Hyundai to drill for oil in the North, bottle and sell mineral water from the region, and build a power plant in Pyongyang.27 Hyundai also proposed another special economic zone in Haeju for eight hundred firms, among them manufacturing firms that would increase North Korea’s exports twenty-fold.28 When Chung died in the spring of 2001, Hyundai was in line to receive infrastructure contracts like an ex¬ pressway from Taegu to Pusan, and other business deals related to unification.29 The cruise remained open during Chung’s lifetime, in part because of his per¬ sistent belief in a capitalist logic that was dramatized by a mixture of autobi¬ ography and emblematic imagery at the Kumgang site.\n\nWith Dynasty, the black sedan that he [Chung Ju Yung] was in, as the leading vehicle, several tens of trucks full of “Unification Cows” came over the military demarcation line that attracted great response from all people at home and abroad.30\n\nSee Mount Kumgang and die.31\n\nI am fond of going among the people and soldiers and spending time among them. I find my life worth living and feel my best pleasure when I learn how they live and work, and take care of them, talking with them and sharing their feelings. —Kim Jong ID2\n\nAll these myths join the stories, habits, and even cults associated with the cruise resort. The name I Love Cruisewns a calculated reference. When the Love Boat television series, associated with Princess cruise lines, began in 1977, it gave the then dormant cruising enterprise an entirely new life. During the next twentyfive years, cruising outpaced any other tourist industry.33 After The Love Boat,\n\n22\n\n23\n\nDPRK\n\ncruise ships became floating TV spaces—not only because TV images created and nurtured its market, but also because the ships themselves translated the image on the screen to the physical environment, usually through spaces that signaled formality with abundant luxury appointments. Fresh from schools of hotel management, the orgmen from Princess, Carnival, and Disney also logistically transposed cruising from a luxury to a mass-market spatial product, making it more responsive to economic volatility, and giving it the power to steal a segment of the market from landed resorts. However ephemeral or abstract the market data may be, these variables are often the determinants of building footprints. The elaborate time-share di¬ agrams of Cancun developers, for instance, chart visitor rotations in a way that makes palpable the mining of time as property. Synchronizing the time it takes the wife to shop with the time it takes the husband to play a round of golf, the resort planner may develop the formula for a new leisure conglomerate with golfing, specialty shopping, spas, and accommodations. Renovations under¬ taken to the rhythms of time-sharing may require an entirely new, usually much larger, building. The strip of beach in Cancun, like the strip in Las Vegas, develops larger and larger megaresorts to contain the expansive choreography of leisure. Mixed with other cultural scripts, these conglomerates of pleasure and entertainment have great vitality, as they propagate, hybridize, and differ¬ entiate faster than we can characterize them as the offspring of Disney, Jerde, or Portman.34 On the ship itself, cruising is an elastic assemblage of programs and ser¬ vices styled, scheduled, and accessorized with the signature techniques of a tourist brand. Management can reliably forecast the number of veal parmigianas needed on “Italian Night,” and provide a choice of scheduled activities including everything from bingo and exercise class to art auctions and nightclubbing. Like the landed resort, cruising is an enclosure of familiarity. It is a libidinous hyperdomesticity in which the children are safe, and someone else is cooking within a ship that is a dream of cleanliness. The cruise schedules activities in ports of call, but travelers often choose to take a taxi into town and shop with cruise-mates so that the experience of a new space seems more familiar. An amnesty from the politics and responsibilities of domestic life recenters life around the needs and desires of the body: sunning, eating, drink¬ ing, spa treatments, and romance. The Love Boat and the I Love Cruise are accurately named, since part of the allure of cruising is sex. In a poll conducted\n\nDPRK\n\nby Cosmopolitan magazine and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, 80 percent of the vacationers said they “felt more amorous at sea,” and 48 percent said they had more sex, most shortly after boarding. The formula seems to work, since most passengers are repeat customers.35 Increasingly familiar are several new species of cruise ship that explore cruising’s own expanded ambitions of territorial autonomy. Two such ships— the World of ResidenSea and the Freedom Ship—are essentially kinetic islands with permanent residents that travel slowly and continuously around the world, completing one rotation every three years. Purportedly still in the plan¬ ning phases, the Freedom Ship—City at Sea is to be 4,320 feet by 725 feet by 340 feet high. Commercial and residential lots are available for purchase. The ship’s educational system is to provide field trips in locations all around, as well as sponsor a global soccer league. A cartoon of the special sovereignty of non¬ national commercial territory, the ship fully collapses domestic life with the duty-free desires of cruising.36\n\nWe’ve been on forty cruises, one every two months. We’re addicted. We have 40,000 miles on Flolland America—they gave us a special emblem. We like other ships, too. The Costa Riviera was fun. They had a man with a monkey going around the ship and served pizza all day long. We also love Carnival’s Jubilee. It’s a beautiful ship.3\n\nEnvision an ideal place to live or run a business—a friendly, safe and secure commu¬ nity with large areas of open space and extensive entertainment and recreational facil¬ ities.

Finally, picture this community con¬ tinually moving around the world. You are beginning to understand Freedom Ship, a soon to be constructed, massive ocean-going vessel. With a length of4,320feet, a width of725feet, and a height of340feet, Freedom Ship will be one of the wonders of the world—a mobile modern city featuring luxurious living, a major world trade center, and an extensive duty-free international shopping mall.38\n\nthe society of the spectacle. . . in which language not only constitutes itself as an au¬ tonomous sphere, but also no longer reveals anything at all\n\nor better yet, it reveals the\n\nnothingness of all things. —Giorgio Agamben39\n\n24\n\n25\n\nDPRK\n\nTourism’s supposed activity and event inevitably sponsors speculation about the laughable goal of authenticity. Dean MacCannell’s early, durable argument in The Tourist analyzes the impossibility of the search. Still, the question occupies many careful thinkers in parsing tourism’s symbolic references and its relevance as a cultural artifact or a commercial product. The repertoire of tourist adventures continually expands to include such things as industrial pro¬ cesses, scripted heritage, explorations of the body, and extreme forms of exer¬ tion. Critical commentary also expands beyond the identification of perceived discrepancies in the accurate depiction of historical or contemporary culture. Analysis also dissects the marketing techniques, urban scripts, and elastic pro¬ grammatic envelopes of tourism. Architecture, even as the featured attraction or most iconic object of desire in the tourist installation, is still only the acces¬ sory to a larger active substrate—-what Debord might have called “another facet of money.”40 The mutual attraction between the DPRK and tourism exposes political disposition in both worlds. Fiction, the cheerful friend of politics and tourism, generates symbolic capital not because the comedy of its fake crests, seals, and epaulets actually means something, but precisely because there is a tacit agree¬ ment that it means nothing. Absurdist gestures and cultural gibberish are tech¬ niques in tourism’s sleight of hand, the means by which it floats irreconcilable motives over a revenue stream. Filled with so much elaborate fiction, it provides the perfect opportunity for playacting, for loudly chanting beliefs while look¬ ing the other way as they are unenforced. At Mount Kumgang, both sides pre¬ tend to be what the other wants just long enough to make the deal. The totalizing formulas shared by the spectacle of tourism and the uto¬ pia of Juche offer a special political instrumentality. Debord’s dystopia portrays the pervasive spectacle as an all-encompassing, tragic and righteous story of “lost unity” within which tourism’s ephemeral experience-as-revenue would be nothing more than “pseudo-use” value.41 Stalinism’s utopia is the story of an ultimate, permanent revolution. The fundamental confidence game of both totalitarianism and the total spectacle must maintain faith in the transcendent and unknowable whole; the eternal dynastic leader or final critique of capital. Yet utopias or self-reflexive worlds of belief also require shifting stories and multiple masquerades to continually refresh the original myth or brand. With¬ out them, the smokescreen lifts, and faith falls away. Not only do tourism and\n\nDPRK\n\ntotalitarianism utilize the same tools of mental vacuity, they become each other’s next masquerade. The fact that both masquerades require the obfusca¬ tion of meaning is not a tragedy of meaninglessness. Rather, this meaningless¬ ness is the meaning as well as the opportunity for political leverage. The reclusive leaders of the DPRK, with their Kumgansan television sets, are the perfect tourists. The staging of power in the DPRK shares tech¬ niques with tourism. At Kumgang, the choreographed activities of tourism merge miraculously with the choreography of a communist state. Mount Kumgang and the DPRK’s capital city of Pyongyang are both communist theme parks of sorts. In fact, Pyongyang has often been called a “Stalinist theme park.”42 In Pyongyang, the military and ruling elite go to restaurants, nightclubs, and casinos, even though a few miles outside the city there is widespread and extreme malnutrition.43 Kim Jong II treats his cronies to shop¬ ping sprees in special stores that sell Western products. Pyongyang is a theater, a Potemkin village, and as many as a thousand people may be called upon to play shoppers and pedestrians when Kim Jong II stages urbanism for visiting dignitaries. The military particularly appreciate this assignment, since it per¬ mits them to wear civilian clothes.44\n\nLet’s consider the Najin-Sonbong area as a pigsty. Build a fence around it, put in karaoke, and capitalists will invest. We need only to collect earnings from the pigs.45\n\nThe Kumgangsan Hotel was excellent in the past, but has been spoilt since Hyundai abandoned it soon after renting it. —DPRK official46\n\nDifferent from the placeless destinations that so neatly organize most touring, the I Love Cruise initiated a resort that was less like The Love Boat and more like reality TV.

Reports circulated that in one case the military authorities had detained the ship to search passenger luggage for a short skirt and unau¬ thorized photographs.

Immigration officials routinely extracted fines for small inconsistencies or omissions on the forms.48 During the early days of the cruise, Hyundai regularly paid an extra $ 100 to $300 for these infractions over and above the $300 per passenger it was al¬ ready paying.49 Hyundai spent hundreds of millions on buildings, docks, and electrical infrastructure. By early 2001, Hyundai estimated its loss at $20 mil¬ lion, and had paid only $342 million of the $942 million promised to the DPRK.S0 In spring 2002, Hyundai was handling approximately four thousand tourists a month, claiming that the project would never be profitable without an overland route, golf course, duty-free shopping, and winter skiing.51 Yet the South Korean chaebols, with their concentrations of money, power, and state subsidy, are caricatures of hypercapitalism capable of natural¬ izing fiscal recklessness. Designed as nation-building organizations, the chae¬ bols were initially orchestrated to create a competitive selection of exports. Arguably, their hierarchical structure and resistance to labor organization is a reflection not of Confucianism but of the military climate within which the chaebols were originally formed.52 (Hyundai built barracks and roads for the United States military during the Korean War.) Today, however, Hyundai pur¬ sues a twenty-first-century script of global exchange. It has developed a ubiq¬ uitous presence in an increasingly diversified range of industries, pursuing global territory in order to avoid domestic restrictions. With more favorable in¬ terest rates abroad, the chaebolczn borrow money at outrageous debt-to-equity ratios, sometimes as high as 92 percent.53 Yet the delusions or irrationalities that sometime accompany symbolic capital also led the South Korean government to bail out Hyundai in 2001. President Kim Dae Jung was even facing an 85 percent disapproval rating in the South in part because of a general impatience with the North’s unpredictability. The previous year, however, he had won the Nobel Peace Prize for unification efforts like the Kumgang tour. Saying that tourism could not “be differentiated from politics and the economy,” the\n\n28\n\n29\n\nDPRK\n\nSouth’s Korea National Tourism Organization (KNTO) entered into partner¬ ship with Hyundai in order to continue the tour.54 One of the chilling consequences of these financial deals was the death of Chung Mong Hun in the summer of 2003. He was Chung Ju Yung’s fifth son, and the designated liaison to the Kumgang project after his father’s death. The administration that succeeded Kim Dae Jung accused the younger Chung of funneling 100 million dollars to the North in 2000, just in time for the his¬ toric summit in June of that year. The payments may have ensured the con¬ tinuation of the negotiations that secured the Peace Prize for Jung, as well as the continuation of the Kumgang project so dear to Chung Ju Yung. Return¬ ing from a trip to the North, and preparing to announce a daily bus service between the North and South in September, Chung Mong Hun learned of a tightening investigation and additional allegations against him. He jumped from the twelfth story of the Hyundai-Asan Building, where his office was decorated with pictures commemorating the negotiations in Pyongyang and Kumgang.55 While North Korea has sometimes alienated the golden goose with too many restrictions, it has also permitted significant intrusions. Kumgang has hosted May Day celebrations between North and South trade unionists, good¬ will sporting events like table tennis and motorcycle or car races, family re¬ unions, and fashion shoots.56 Reunions are now streamlined with an on-line visa-processing site.57 Even Japanese tourists were permitted to visit the site, playing out a historical coda of the conqueror returned as tourist.58 In Sep¬ tember 2002, work began on a rail line linking Seoul and Sinuiju, as well as a rail line between Onjong-ri (at the foot of Mount Kumgang) and Chojin. Restaurants and convenience stores have appeared in the resort.59 In addition to renovating the hotel, Hyundai has been given permission to build temporary tourist bungalows around the newly built spa. The company is also to begin [see Franchise]\n\nwork on two golf courses, a ski lift, and a bungee jump.60 The DPRK claims to favor the entry of technological innovation while filtering out other bad habits of the market, yet it continues to embark on far stranger adventures with capitalism. North Korea’s partial economic recovery has given the country some relief from the period of famine they now call the arduous march.” There is still no television or Internet connection with the\n\nDPRK\n\noutside world for most of the country, but the opening of three hundred large markets, forty of which are in Pyongyang, has been widely publicized.61 The Unification Church, which had originally made a bid for the Kumgang proj¬ ect, has entered into an agreement with Fiat to build an automobile factory in the North, the Peace Motor Company, that will produce a jeep as the first affordable, \"middle-class” car. Hyundai is also slated to build sixteen automo¬ bile factories in the North, as well as a technology park just north of the De¬ militarized Zone for which the proposed name is “Mount Kumgang Valley.”62 In September 2002, North Korea legislated an additional special eco¬ nomic zone in Sinuiju, 132 square miles on the western border with China and across the Yalu River from Dadong. Like Rajin-Sonbong or the Kaesong In¬ dustrial development, the zone would have no visa restrictions, and would op¬ erate free from government involvement for fifty years. North Korea granted management of the Zone to a thirty-nine-year-old manufacturing and agri¬ cultural entrepreneur, Yang Bin, named by Forbes magazine as the secondrichest man in China. As if reverse-casting the roles in historical epics of global trade, Yang, although born in Nanjing, acquired Dutch citizenship and re¬ turned to the rust belt of Shenyang to build a 220-hectare development called Holland Village. Housing, offices, retail, and recreational space were fashioned in the style of a Dutch architectural confection complete with windmills, a re¬ construction of the Amsterdam railway station, and an artificial beach and wave pool. Yang’s company, Euro-Asia Agricultural, sold orchids, among other things, and planned to build 100,000 greenhouses in the North Korean Spe¬ cial Economic Zone. The agreement with North Korea was signed on Septem¬ ber 23, but by October 4 the Chinese government had already cracked down on Yang for alleged tax evasion and corruption.63\n\n[see\n\nEl Ejido]\n\nGeorge W.

Now, over a period of three years this is palatable, but to kill a few people to stop this from happening—a lot of people can’t stomach it. —General Curtis LeMay describing the use of napalm in the Korean War66\n\nThe cheerleaders dispense their smiles politically. At Thursday night’s opening cere¬ monies, they halted when the American and Japanese delegations arrived. —Description of North Korean cheerleaders at the 2003 World University Games6\n\nNorth Korea maintains self-respect by sampling a culture that is more intensely opposed to it—alienating or denigrating that culture even while accepting profits from it. The husband can more easily have an affair with the Other, an interloper or a femme fatale, than with the neighbor’s wife. Righteousness needs to cheat, but it also needs a monstrous evil enemy. Perhaps nothing raises the polish of Juche’s perfection like the evils of capitalism. Likewise, the capi¬ talist must also choose opportune moments to declare the DPRK evil and itself pure. Americas belligerent stance toward North Korea, characterizing it as part of an “axis of evil,” galvanizes the DPRK’s most violent military programs, and places the two countries back in the Cold War architecture of symmetrical mimicry, fragility, and innocence. This, together with the neoliberal belief in a slow inculcation of capital’s superior logics, constitutes a military-market containment of sorts. Yet beyond these hard-boiled logics are wildcards, secret handshakes, and surprise endings that may also be successful in diverting a political theater. The / Love Cruise replaces the homeostasis of a Cold War game theory situation such as “Prisoner’s Dilemma” with the unpredictability of the confidence game. As if to serve as a mascot for the maritime metaphors that populate globaliza¬ tion theories, it was a cruise ship, after all, with all of its promiscuity and lux¬ ury, that was able to penetrate the North. Able to slip through jurisdictions and political boundaries, this true pirate space was better equipped to gain both ac¬ cess and immunity—the Mata Hari that made a space for political negotiations.\n\nDPRK\n\nSimilarly, change may ride on excess, corruption, and exploitation, and the most elaborate desires may provide resistances or incentives that either leverage this change or exacerbate human rights problems. The more absurd and slippery the market script, the greater likelihood that it can maintain an effective disguise. Connoisseurs of the world’s curiosities will pay to sample the North’s various forms of sporting exertion or see its sheltered animal species. One inevitability: the North’s cheap labor will find its way into the spas, golf courses, factories, and oil wells of the larger coastal development. A political imagination spots details of the bargain that may reasonably possess tactical powers to influence labor, economy, or environment. For instance, if it is de¬ signed to do so, a building component produced in large quantities po¬ tentially translates to both jobs and domestic industries in the North. The buildings that house reunions and goodwill sports, the only events North Ko¬ reans are permitted to attend, will necessarily be used for other programs, and so will introduce new cultural material to the North. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11,2001, the North, pleading concerns about security, requested that many diplomatic sessions be held at Mount Kumgang. Consequently the resort has become the home base for summits between North and South, as\n\n[see Error]\n\nwell as the headquarters for the Red Cross and for family reunions.68\n\n[see Pirate]\n\nOccasionally, through some rapprochement between disguises, a sudden loosening of dogma, a sudden amnesia about conflict, appears when everyone is ready to make the deal. While the market runs on logic, it also runs on risks and comedies, ridiculous products and ephemeral desires. In the vacuity and amnesty of tourism’s pirate space are powerful political mechanisms. An ethi¬ cal swindle can enhance an ethical stance. Some sleight of hand with program, market, or materials, some counterpiracy, might add into the mix alternative choices that make many human rights undeniable by unusual means. Extreme dangers also mingle with these indirect political consequences. A number of incidents, including the bombing of resorts in Bali in October 2002, may have been opening volleys in a war on tourism. Given their associ¬ ation with nature and peaceful cultural exchange or, their lack of overt politi¬ cal text, they may be attractive sites for summits or peace negotiations. Still, tourist installations are not politically neutral, “third-way” revenue streams but, rather, tantalizing signals of an arrogant belief in political immunity and superiority. For the terrorist, the destruction of tourism provides the perfect\n\n32\n\n33\n\nDPRK\n\n1.4 Hyundai's floating Hotel Haekumgang at Mount Kumgang.

In excess of a Marxist historiography is an ancient history of piracy and confidence games that uses whatever it likes as a disguise (perhaps even classic forms of political resistance). Global tourism is rich with both conciliatory and inflammatory signals. Still, since a capacity for masquerade currently protects the fairy tales of communism and capitalism at Mount Kumgang, both sides are gambling on the possibility that capitalism’s contradictions and shifting sto¬ ries will cause it not to perish but to flourish. Indeed, fiction and masquerade have even succeeded in generating political meaning through lack of meaning, thus tripping the lock on an all-pervasive spectacle considered to be capital’s ultimate critique.\n\n34\n\n35\n\ncc\n\nQ_ Q\n\nOffshore\n\nJeju's utopia, leodo, is a mystic, uncharted island of the imagination, its beauty and a tribute passed on from one generation to the next from a time immemorial. Today, that concept well lends itself to the strivings of the islanders to make Jeju the vacation hub of Northeast Asia in the AsiaPacific era of the twenty-first century. -Woo, Keun-Min, Governor, Jeju Province69\n\nSammu is the term meaning there's no thief, gate or beggar in Jeju. From the old days, Islanders have made \"diligence, thrift, interdependence\" their virtue in order to pioneer rough and harsh surroundings. So they didn't steal or beg, which led to the condition of no use for the gate. Also, all the houses were the descendants of Tamna or of scholars who were banished due to their great will to keep their principles. Therefore they all valued their honor highly. They also knew everything about each other, which prohibited them from doing anything bad or dishonorable.70\n\nIn 2002, a North Korean delegation, gathering information about cap¬ italist business practices in the South, visited Jeju, an island off the southwest coast of the Korean peninsula that calls itself the \"Hawaii and Las Vegas of Asia.\" These are just two of the identities it claims.71 The island is also currently planning to become the Singapore of Korea, a center of business, tourism, and international trade. Jeju locates itself not solely in relation to the Korean peninsula, but rather, like Cancun, in relation to flight times to major cities on the Eastern rim. It hopes to attract nine million tourists and industries, including information¬ processing, computer management, fish farming, and tree nurseries. The Korean government intends to contribute $3.6 billion to this effort in the next ten years. The Jeju stadium hosted World Cup Tournament events in 2002 as a debut of the tourist infrastructure it has been building for years. Like Kumgang, it has become a sister tourist space of diplomacy through tourism, sporting events, and summits-one that is also devel¬ oping new models of eco-tourism and agricultural tourism.72 Fifty per¬ cent of the island's 1,845 square kilometers is forest and another 30 percent is agricultural, with the chief source of income from tangerines.\n\nDPRK\n\nMount Halla, at the center of the island, displaces most of the settled ar¬ eas to the coast.73 As the storage places for cultural exceptions and secrets, ocean is¬ lands are like the inland island of Mount Kumgang. Not only refugees and criminals but also hidden business practices are exiled to or stored on islands. Islands are the place where the doppelganger lives, and where extra desires and fantasies flourish. They are the sites of stories, other wives, confidence men, and pirates. Islands are the world's mythomaniacs, not only sidestepping reality with a fabled existence, but also de¬ claring exemptions from the laws that govern behavior on the continent. Islands also harbor the ingredients of culture that fall outside permissi¬ ble boundaries or between cultural indices. Consequently, they are often penal colonies or, during war, stationary battleships. Jeju has been both. It was a penal colony before modern times, and for a hundred years af¬ ter that a military headquarters for both the Japanese and the Ameri¬ cans. Many Jeju families also suffered losses in a revolt that the mainland Korean army squelched in 1948. American soldiers, having determined that it was a \"Red Island,\" brought over Korean police and army members who massacred 30,000 people, some of them children.74 Islands off the coast of both Koreas remain the storage places of bitter fights that most recently surfaced in the world wars of the twen¬ tieth century. The United Nations' new Laws of the Sea (1982) exacer¬ bate this latent conflict. They establish, for any nation, an exclusive economic zone 200 nautical miles off the shore. For archipelagos of the South China Sea, this new law creates not only many overlapping bound¬ ary lines, but a rush to lay ancient claim to islands or rocks that extend, for instance, national property rights to fishing or offshore oil.75 Yet Jeju has developed a very cagey amnesia for conflict. The is¬ land offers offshore exemptions such as casinos, duty-free shops, tax shelters, free-trade zones, visa waivers for 173 countries, and luxury re¬ sorts and tourist installations. The island hopes to be a capital of golf, providing a golfer's amnesty in the form of 50 percent reductions in greens fees. It promotes itself as a honeymooners' paradise and is a fre¬ quent location for shooting Korean movies.76 Jeju is also writing several public-relations scripts based on its an¬ cient traditions. They refer, for instance, to \"Jeju’s utopia, leodo.. .a mys¬ tic, uncharted island of the imagination.\" The Tamna ancestry is rendered\n\n36\n\n37\n\nDPRK\n\nequally mystical and heroic.77 Referencing a history of \"overcoming tri¬ als with patience and prudence,\" Jeju projects an image of strength through virtuous behavior. It publishes messages of healing and psychol¬ ogized care for its own citizens. The island also offers an emotional mes¬ sage about a global family of citizens. While there are a half million citizens living on Jeju, they claim a population of one million by main¬ taining a relationship with anyone who has ever lived there. Many of these efforts are intended to provide a home for those who fled or were exiled from Jeju during its many conflicts. Not only does the island wel¬ come these citizens, but it treats them as part of an extended source of intelligence for solving problems, a \"Think Tank Network of brains from Jeju Island.\"78 As the finale to a conference of the Pacific Asian Tourist Associa¬ tion (PATA), Jeju offered a special tour of Mount Kumgang that quickly sold out. The association issued a homily about tourism's ability to \"bring peace, harmony, and prosperity to the people of the Korean Peninsula.”79\n\nEl Ejido\n\n“These are what New Yorkers like, ” he says. He turns and pulls a plastic covered pack¬ age of small, green tomatoes from a pile. “Swedes like their tomatoes small, green and packaged in plastic. Whatever they want, I give them. Here, the consumer is king.”1\n\nHow do you stay open to business and closed to people? Easy—first you expand the perimeter, then you lock down. —Naomi Klein 2\n\nHigh-tech agriculture, like tourism, indexes the globe according to selected cli¬ matic attributes. It favors territories with large annual amounts of sunshine combined with cooling winds, water, cheap labor, and relaxed trade agree¬ ments. The tilted planet reveals luxuriant veins of sunshine bleeding across the Mediterranean and the Southern Hemisphere—a sea of photosynthesis. For the tourist industry, the cruise ship facilitates the conquest of these abstract ter¬ ritories by eliminating some of the necessary attachments and inconveniences of a single culture-laden location, and delivering the selected audience to any of the appropriate climates or attractions in accommodations to which they are accustomed. In the agricultural industry, greenhouses are the equivalent. By regulating and optimizing water, growth medium, temperature, and genetic constitution, greenhouses deliver horticultural necessities as abstracted vari¬ ables independent of the complexities of the land. The greenhouse is a germ of agricultural urbanism that intensifies not only production but also labor and waste in agripoles the size of a city. No longer used only when land or sunshine is sparse, as a structure within a field, greenhouses themselves are also propagated by the square mile in gigantic\n\n[see Seas]\n\nEl Ejido\n\nfields as a massive three-dimensional construction. An agricultural landscape is typically considered to be a cultivated form of exurban countryside, a selfcleansing counterbalancing organization of overlapping ecologies between animals, atmosphere, and vegetation. A landscape of greenhouses, however, is a continuous field of twelve-to-twenty-foot structures. Since most greenhouse formations cultivate flowers, fruits, and vegetables for export, they are also international formations. Since the 1970s, the substitution of plastic sheeting for glass has made greenhouse construction a less expensive proposition, thus transforming a few horticultural techniques into a boom industry in Spain, Italy, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Cyprus, the Canary Islands, New Zea¬ land, Japan, China, and South Korea.3 Asia has the largest total area of green¬ houses, with approximately 1,800 square miles, but the Mediterranean also has approximately 400 square miles. A global network of plasticulture urbanism is gradually conquering areas of peak sunshine around the world.4 This new colonization of photosynthesis joins the long-standing impe¬ rial practice of importing out-of-season vegetables from the colonies. Yet in the networks of international agripoles, national and private powers crisscross the oceans in a contraseasonal exchange as mobile territories, sometimes seceding from their local conditions. The autonomous world of high-tech agriculture has elastic boundaries that extend and tighten with a flexibility that allows them to continually close around the next optimal condition with the cheapest labor. Plasticulture urbanism encounters climatic and environmental issues, conflicts over labor and immigration, and economic wars over food.\n\n“Thousands and thousands of immigrants work in this zone where, it must not be for¬ gotten, they did not appear by magic but because we needed them from an economic point of view, ’’ declared Andalusia’s regional president Manuel Chaves. “If they left, El Ejido’s economic activity would collapse. ”5\n\nOne international agripole that is the Rome or Alexandria of this sea of pho¬ tosynthesis is the province of Almeria in southern Spain. In the 1970s, when greenhouse technology surfaced as a technique for growing more than cut flow¬ ers, southern Spain, with its three thousand annual hours of sunshine, aver¬ age temperature of 67 degrees Fahrenheit, and underground aquifer, became\n\nEl Ejido\n\npotential photosynthesis\n\n(average in grams per square meter per year)\n\n2.1 Global map of average photosynthesis per year. Image prepared by Shane Curnyn for\n\nPraxis4, Landscape Issue, 2002.\n\n40\n\n41\n\nE! Ejido\n\na laboratory for the technology—a giant horticultural experiment called the “Almerian miracle.”6 The Spanish developed a technique of stretching plastic over structures previously used in vineyards. Landsat images of the area show the entire Almerian region, from the sea to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, literally coated white with this type of greenhouse. In 1970, there were only 300 hectares of greenhouses in Spain, near Barcelona.\n\nIn 1971,\n\nthere were 7.72 square miles in Almeria alone, and by 2001 there were over 177 square miles concentrated there, half the size of all five boroughs of New York City.8 Farmers recycle only 6,000 of the 20,000 tons of plastic they use per year.9 This billion-dollar industry, likened to the discovery of oil, has turned one of the poorest regions of Spain into one of the wealthiest.10 The small town of El Ejido in the Almerian province is completely engulfed in plastic, a white landscape visible at the end of every street. The population and income of the city exploded in thirty years: from 17,000 people in 1970 to 50,000 in 2000.11 During a good year, a farmer with just 10 acres can make $500,000.12 New banks, SUV dealerships, luxury stores, and unifamiliares, or single-family subdivisions, appear around the town. There have always been brothels in Almeria. The contemporary brothels, however, resemble a compound of self¬ storage units arranged in a jagged stepped configuration like individual minia¬ ture condominiums, with roll-up doors and their own parking place. The women working there migrate from Africa, or are trafficked from Eastern Eu¬ rope. The golf courses and artificial lakes of the tourist industry that has always flourished on the Costa del Sol continues to expand to serve northern Euro¬ peans, intermingling with the greenhouses in a planimetric soup of devel¬ opment patterns. Just a mile from the greenhouse fields, one can dine, not on greenhouse vegetables, but on Wiener schnitzel. A few miles drive to the northeast, where the greenhouses abruptly end, the landscape presents another anomaly. The soil in Almeria is the poorest in the whole of Europe. In fact, the Tabernas area just east of Almeria is Europe’s only real desert. During the 1960s, the profitable industry was not tomatoes by the millions of tons, but film-making. Dr. Zhivago, Cleopatra, and Lawrence of Arabia used the landscape for location shooting, and Sergio Leone used it to simulate the deserts of the American west for “spaghetti westerns” like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, A Fistful of Dollars, and A Few Dollars More with\n\nEl Ejido\n\n2.2 Aerial photograph showing the Almerian Peninsula coated in greenhouses.

Mini-Hollywood, a theme park near El Ejido, has a western main street, performances by cowboy cast members, and a zoo for African an¬ imals such as zebras, monkeys, and tigers.13 Emblazoned on the flag of this sovereign world of photosynthesis, ap¬ pearing in every feature of its crest is the dearest object of plasticulture desire: the tomato. Nurturing tomatoes in plastic greenhouses is an extremely complex game of cheating the seasons, requiring the manipulation of environmental factors, mechanisms of international finance, and the juridical pacts of inter¬ national diplomacy. The tomato is the most durable player in this game. In the horticultural nursery cum stock market, the actual growth of a tomato signals growth in profits. Trade bargains, the differentials of labor costs, and the lust for enhanced and stylized vegetables can transform this fruit into a semi¬ precious nugget and an object of international piracy. In this laboratory landscape, every possible need or desire of a tomato is completely optimized. Plastics factories standing within the complex of fields manufacture the necessary tons of plastic sheeting. Distribution stations, also within the fields, quickly absorb and deliver the vegetables to Malaga for ship¬ ping to the rest of the European Community, or air-freighting to other parts of the world. Growers can, by remote control, inject fluids rich with various chemicals and nutrients into the hydroponic IVs. Many of the roads between the greenhouses are paved to prevent the spread of disease. The pattern of de¬ velopment in this agro-industrial area is oriented in a wavy north-south pattern that permits cross breezes and prevents lingering shadows during the day. A growth medium provides the soil in this desert. It lies atop a layer of clay and sand, both of which are in abundant supply in the area. A comedy of intense control and endless research accompanies the quest for the perfect tomato. Multinational seed companies are headquartered in the El Ejido-Almeria area, on the highway with the plastics factories and other essential ingredients of a greenhouse agripole. These companies continually merge and change names, only occasionally revealing their affiliation with larger biotech or drug companies. They act as private versions of a state or uni¬ versity extension agency, often developing laboratories in areas of greenhouse concentration around the world. In their installations one can see, in minia¬ ture, the factors of global competition. They test the performance of com¬ peting glass and plastic, arched or flat-roofed greenhouse types. Breeding for\n\nEl Ejido\n\na myriad of genetic factors is best controlled by hormonally stressing female plants into a hermaphroditic state within which they can be milked for seeds. In the most high-tech greenhouses the plants grow in linear bags of growth medium punctured with tubes that deliver fluids and nutrients. The entire en¬ closure is computer-controlled, buzzing, burping, and opening flaps in re¬ sponse to a shift in wind or a moment when the sun temporarily slips behind a cloud. Plastics are even manufactured to block the visible wavelengths of flies and mosquitoes, making it impossible for the blind insects to infect the plants. Seeds that produce over twenty kilos of vegetables per square meter per grow¬ ing season can even be dated for planting during a specific week of the year.14 Plasticulture surrounds itself with the aura of intelligent responsiveness that attends most contemporary high-tech endeavors. Yet flexibility and re¬ sponsiveness do not necessary describe a disposition of openness. Rather, the responsive organization is often one that is able to simultaneously extend and exclude. Optimizing the cheapest low-tech construction to deliver high-tech results with maximum profits relies on the continual perfection of the formula and the vigilant elimination of failure. Still, perfectly engineered worlds are also the most susceptible to failures resulting from attempts at complete control. Among industrial managers, a control error is one in which it is hoped that the denial of information will pre¬ vail. In blinkered entrenchment, contradictory evidence is banished as false knowledge so that a bloated market can continue to grow or siphon resources from its host site. In the case of El Ejido, the lurking difficulty surrounds the need for labor cheaper than any that can be found in Spain. El Ejido is one of the most remarkable landscape formations on earth— one that is visible from space. Still, it might have remained invisible, like so many distended or secessionary spaces within which collective democratic de¬ mands are overlooked or unenforced. Yet, however perfectly engineered they may be, Spain’s greenhouse agripoles need something extra to stay alive. They need to tighten the boundaries of their world while also cheating selectively outside of those boundaries. Labor, as the secret requirement for perfection and control in Almerfa, eventually exposed a complex ethnoscape in the region. North Africa supplied an inexpensive but illegal labor force, and when Spain covertly accepted that labor, it reignited a centuries-old conflict in this part of the Mediterranean.\n\n[see Error]\n\n44\n\n45\n\nEl Ejido\n\nLast week’s attacks were triggered by the stabbing death of a 26-year-old Spanish woman, Encarnacion Lopez, on Saturday February 5, allegedly by a mentally ill Moroccan man who tried to snatch her purse in a flea market. The stabbing came on the heels ofthe murder of two Spanish farmers by a 22-year-old Moroccan worker, who reportedly slit one mans throat and bludgeoned the other man’s skull. The night before Lopez’s funeral, some 10,000people gathered in El Ejido and chanted anti-immigrant slogans. Gangs organized a “punishment mission” and made plans to carry out Ku Klux Klan-style nighttime attacks, but were stopped by authorities before reaching the part of El Ejido inhabited by immigrants. . . . Twenty-five years after the death of the nation¬ alist military leader-Francisco Franco, Spain is facing a resurgence in far-right fascist activity by youths seeking a return to the “racial purity” and “moral order”preached by the Generalissimo. Fascist groups, whose symbol is the old Francista flag, featuring a black eagle in place of the shield on todays Spanish flag, propagate their hatred via rock music and the Internet. (In fact, authorities in El Ejido say the recent violence was or¬ ganized through a neo-Nazi Internet campaign.)15\n\nIn the larger cartographic landscape, the two opposing European and African shores mirror each other symmetrically and competitively across the Mediter¬ ranean. Like rival twins, they share the same calendar of sunshine. Responding to swings of prosperity and poverty, they have traded alternating rhythms of occupation, resistance, warfare, and expulsion over hundreds of years. Sited in a pivotal location, this theater of the tomato war is a translocal valve of labor, race, and migration problems in Europe. Yet currently, given the great differential between Spain’s relatively suc¬ cessful economy and that of Morocco, for instance, North Africa is expected to remain in a complementary and submissive relationship. The North African immigrants, providing the approximately 20,000 workers required to maintain the greenhouses, work eight hours per day for approximately $25 per day in temperatures of over one hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Since most have open-ended contracts, these can be terminated any time for any complaint or insurgency, even if they are asked to perform extra work. Most of the $300500 that a picker makes—half what a Spanish worker would expect to be paid—will be sent home, since Spanish wages are five times those in most of North Africa.16 The $3,000 fine for hiring an illegal worker seems not to be strictly enforced.17 If workers are given work visas, the employers must then\n\n2.3 Aerial photograph of the symmetrical shores of Spain and Morocco. Source: .\n\n46\n\n47\n\nEl Ejido\n\npay their social security, a sum of money that, for both parties, seems only to disappear. The Spanish are also concerned that providing papers for these workers will make Almeria and El Ejido entry points for immigrants seeking work elsewhere in Spain or Europe. Typically, the workers do not rent permanent housing, and landlords complain that when they do, too many people share the apartment. They live in charbolas or temporary shelters in fields that have become cities of both people and vegetables. El Ejido’s Plan of Rural Hygiene and Plan of Rural Reg¬ ulation read like a scheme for urban reform. For instance, the plans e"
