This study aimed to investigate the relative humidity (RH)-dependent viability of airborne respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in simulated respiratory particles suspended in various indoor air conditions. We tested airborne RSV viability in three static indoor air conditions, including sub-hysteresis (RH < 39%), hysteresis (39% < RH < 65%), and super-hysteresis (RH > 65%) air as well as in three dynamic indoor air conditions, including the transitions between the static conditions. The dynamic conditions were hysteresis → super-hysteresis → hysteresis, sub-hysteresis → hysteresis, and super-hysteresis → hysteresis. We found that after 45 min of particle aging in static conditions, the viability of RSV in sub-hysteresis, hysteresis, and super-hysteresis air was 0.72% ± 0.06%, 0.03% ± 0.006%, and 0.27% ± 0.008%, respectively. After 45 min of aging in dynamic conditions, the RSV viability decreased for particles that remained in a liquid (deliquesced) state during aging when compared with particles in a solid (effloresced) state. The decreased viability of airborne RSV for deliquesced particles is consistent with prolonged exposure to elevated aqueous solutes. These results represent the first measurements of the survival of airborne RSV over particle aging time, with equal viability in low, intermediate, and high RHs at 5 and 15 min and a V-shaped curve after 45 min.\n\nPrashant Kumar, Lidia Morawska (2020)Could Fighting Airborne Transmission be the Next Line of Defence against COVID-19 Spread?, In: City and Environment Interactions4100033 Elsevier\n\nThe World Health Organisation declared the infectious spread of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) an epidemic during its initial outbreak in Wuhan (China) and has since declared it a pandemic and, more recently, an endemic infection that may remain in our communities. A vaccine for COVID-19 is expected to take several months, meaning that the spread may continue in future, in the absence of the most effective measures of social distancing and self-isolation. While these measures have worked well under lockdowns, the potential of airborne transmission of COVID-19 under the eased restrictions has not been considered important enough. We discuss the need to acknowledge the airborne spread of COVID-19 inside built spaces under eased movement restrictions and the potential steps that can be taken to control it.\n\nPrashant Kumar, Angela Druckman, John Gallagher, Birgitta Gatersleben, Sarah Allison, Theodore S.

Rapid urbanization and the ever-growing need for housing have turned large areas of many cities into concrete landscapes that lack greenery. Green infrastructure can support human health, provide socio-economic and environmental benefits, and bring color to an otherwise grey urban landscape. Sometimes, benefits come with downsides in relation to its impact on air quality and human health, requiring suitable data and guidelines to implement effective greening strategies. Air pollution and human health, as well as green infrastructure and human health, are often studied together. Linking green infrastructure with air quality and human health together is a unique aspect of this article. A holistic understanding of these links is key to enabling policymakers and urban planners to make informed decisions. By critically evaluating the link between green infrastructure and human health via air pollution mitigation, we also discuss if our existing understanding of such interventions is enabling their uptake in practice. Both the natural science and epidemiology approach the topic of green infrastructure and human health very differently. The pathways linking health benefits to pollution reduction by urban vegetation remain unclear and that the mode of green infrastructure deployment is critical to avoid unintended consequences. Strategic deployment of green infrastructure may reduce downwind pollution exposure. However, the development of bespoke design guidelines is vital to promote and optimize greening benefits and measuring green infrastructure’s socio-economic and health benefits are key for their uptake. Greening cities to mitigate pollution effects is on the rise and these needs to be matched by scientific evidence and appropriate guidelines. We conclude that urban vegetation can facilitate broad health benefits, but there is little empirical evidence linking these benefits to air pollution reduction by urban vegetation, and appreciable efforts are needed to establish the underlying policies, design and engineering guidelines governing its deployment.\n\nP.

This is the first global assessment on air pollution exposure in cars across ten cities: Dhaka (Bangladesh); Chennai (India); Guangzhou (China); Medellín (Colombia); São Paulo (Brazil); Cairo (Egypt); Sulaymaniyah (Iraq); Addis Ababa (Ethiopia); Blantyre (Malawi); and Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania). Portable laser particle counters were used to develop a proxy of car-user exposure profiles and analyse the factors affecting particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5; fine fraction) and ≤10 μm (PM2.5–10; coarse fraction). Measurements were carried out during morning, off- and evening-peak hours under windows-open and windows-closed (fan-on and recirculation) conditions on predefined routes. For all cities, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were highest during windows-open, followed by fan-on and recirculation. Compared with recirculation, PM2.5 and PM10 were higher by up to 589% (Blantyre) and 1020% (São Paulo), during windows-open and higher by up to 385% (São Paulo) and 390% (São Paulo) during fan-on, respectively. Coarse particles dominated the PM fraction during windows-open while fine particles dominated during fan-on and recirculation, indicating filter effectiveness in removing coarse particles and a need for filters that limit the ingress of fine particles. Spatial variation analysis during windows-open showed that pollution hotspots make up to a third of the total route-length. PM2.5 exposure for windows-open during off-peak hours was 91% and 40% less than morning and evening peak hours, respectively. Across cities, determinants of relatively high personal exposure doses included lower car speeds, temporally longer journeys, and higher in-car concentrations. It was also concluded that car-users in the least affluent cities experienced disproportionately higher in-car PM2.5 exposures. Cities were classified into three groups according to low, intermediate and high levels of PM exposure to car commuters, allowing to draw similarities and highlight best practices.\n\nAlex Mikszewski, Luca Stabile, Giorgio Buonanno, Lidia Morawska (2022)The airborne contagiousness of respiratory viruses: A comparative analysis and implications for mitigation, In: Di xue qian yuan13(6) Elsevier B.V\n\n[Display omitted] •Predictive estimation approach improves airborne infection risk assessment methods.•SARS-CoV-2 estimated to be nearly as contagious as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.•SARS-CoV-2 much more transmissible through indoor air than seasonal influenza.•Current ventilation standards in public buildings are unlikely to control SARS-CoV-2. The infectious emission rate is a fundamental input parameter for airborne transmission risk assessment, but data are limited due to reliance on estimates from chance superspreading events. This study assesses the strength of a predictive estimation approach developed by the authors for SARS-CoV-2 and uses novel estimates to compare the contagiousness of respiratory pathogens. We applied the approach to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, measles virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coxsackievirus, seasonal influenza virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and compared quanta emission rate (ERq) estimates to literature values. We calculated infection risk in a prototypical classroom and barracks to assess the relative ability of ventilation to mitigate airborne transmission. Our median standing and speaking ERq estimate for SARS-CoV-2 (2.7 quanta h−1) is similar to active, untreated TB (3.1 quanta h−1), higher than seasonal influenza (0.17 quanta h−1), and lower than measles virus (15 quanta h−1). We calculated event reproduction numbers above 1 for SARS-CoV-2, measles virus, and untreated TB in both the classroom and barracks for an activity level of standing and speaking at low, medium and high ventilation rates of 2.3, 6.6 and 14 L per second per person (L s–1 p–1), respectively. Our predictive ERq estimates are consistent with the range of values reported over decades of research. In congregate settings, current ventilation standards are unlikely to control the spread of viruses with upper quartile ERq values above 10 quanta h−1, such as SARS-CoV-2, indicating the need for additional control measures.\n\nAlex Mikszewski, Luca Stabile, Giorgio Buonanno, Lidia Morawska (2022)Increased close proximity airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, In: The Science of the total environment816pp. 151499-151499 Elsevier B.V\n\nThe Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 causes higher viral loads in infected hosts, increasing the risk of close proximity airborne transmission through breathing, speaking and coughing. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation using a social contact network and exponential dose-response model to quantify the close proximity reproduction number of both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant. We estimate more than twice as many Delta variant cases will reproduce infection in their close proximity contacts (64%) versus the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (29%). Occupational health guidelines must consider close proximity airborne transmission and recommend improved personal respiratory protection for high-risk workers. [Display omitted] •Close proximity airborne transmission may predominate for SARS-CoV-2.•A majority of Delta variant cases will infect someone else, unlike wild-type virus.•The Delta variant overdispersion parameter (k) and R0 are consistent with smallpox.•Room-scale airborne transmission is a significant factor and requires mitigation.•Workers in close proximity to COVID-19 cases require fit-tested respirators.\n\nLidia Morawska, Wei Huang (2022)WHO Health Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality and National Recommendations/ Standards, In: Handbook of Indoor Air Qualitypp. 1491-1510 Springer Nature Singapore\n\nThis chapter reviews and discusses the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines related to indoor air quality (IAQ). The WHO IAQ health guidelines are developed and published after systematic reviews of evidence from medical and public health studies, and through extensive panel discussion and expert consultation, which provide an important basis for countries to develop your national indoor air standards. First, a general background is provided for establishing health-based air quality guidelines, followed by a summary of the criteria for the inclusion and exclusion of specific pollutants in these documents and a summary of the values of the numerical guidelines for IAQ. The following is a summary of existing or planned national standards or guidelines for IAQ management, including monitoring, in countries around the world, and discussed in the context of the WHO IAQ guidelines. Globally, only several countries have enacted national indoor air quality standards or health guidelines. The importance of developing a national standard or guideline for indoor air quality based on health evidence is discussed as a measure to reduce indoor exposure.\n\nXiaopu Lyu, Ke Li, Hai Guo, Lidia Morawska, Beining Zhou, Yangzong Zeren, Fei Jiang, Changhong Chen, Allen H.

Blake (2023)A synergistic ozone-climate control to address emerging ozone pollution challenges, In: One Earth6(8)pp. 964-977\n\nTropospheric ozone threatens human health and crop yields, exacerbates global warming, and fundamentally changes atmospheric chemistry. Evidence has pointed toward widespread ozone increases in the troposphere, and particularly surface ozone is chemically complex and difficult to abate. Despite past successes in some regions, a solution to new challenges of ozone pollution in a warming climate remains unexplored. In this perspective, by compiling surface measurements at ∼4,300 sites worldwide between 2014 and 2019, we show the emerging global challenge of ozone pollution, featuring the unintentional rise in ozone due to the uncoordinated emissions reduction and increasing climate penalty. On the basis of shared emission sources, interactive chemical mechanisms, and synergistic health effects between ozone pollution and climate warming, we propose a synergistic ozone-climate control strategy incorporating joint control of ozone and fine particulate matter. This new solution presents an opportunity to alleviate tropospheric ozone pollution in the forthcoming low-carbon transition.\n\nBasant Pradhan, Rohan Jayaratne, Helen Thompson, Giorgio Buonanno, Mandana Mazaheri, Mawutorli Nyarku, Weiwei Lin, Marcelo Luiz Pereira, Josef Cyrys, Annette Peters, Lidia Morawska (2023)Utility of outdoor central site monitoring in assessing exposure of school children to ultrafine particles, In: The Science of the total environment859(Pt 1)pp. 160162-160162 Elsevier B.V\n\nEpidemiological studies investigating the association between daily particle exposure and health effects are frequently based on a single monitoring site located in an urban background. Using a central site in epidemiological time-series studies has been established based on the premises of low spatial variability of particles within the areas of interest and hence the adequacy of the central sites to monitor the exposure. This is true to a large extent in relation to larger particles (PM2.5, PM10) that are typically monitored and regulated. However, the distribution of ultrafine particles (UFP), which in cities predominantly originate from traffic, is heterogeneous. With increasing pressure to improve the epidemiology of UFP, an important question to ask is, whether central site monitoring is representative of community exposure to this size fraction of particulate matter; addressing this question is the aim of this paper. To achieve this aim, we measured personal exposure to UFP, expressed as particle number concentration (PNC), using Philips Aerasense Nanotracers (NT) carried by the participants of the study, and condensation particle counters (CPC) or scanning mobility particle sizers (SMPS) at central fixed-site monitoring stations. The measurements were conducted at three locations in Brisbane (Australia), Cassino (Italy) and Accra (Ghana). We then used paired t-tests to compare the average personal and average fixed-site PNC measured over the same 24-h, and hourly, periods. We found that, at all three locations, the 24-h average fixed-site PNC was no different to the personal PNC, when averaged over the study period and all the participants. However, the corresponding hourly averages were significantly different at certain times of the day. These were generally times spent commuting and during cooking and eating at home. Our analysis of the data obtained in Brisbane, showed that maximum personal exposure occurred in the home microenvironment during morning breakfast and evening dinner time. The main source of PNC for personal exposure was from the home-microenvironment. We conclude that the 24-h average PNC from the central-site can be used to estimate the 24-h average personal exposure for a community. However, the hourly average PNC from the central site cannot consistently be used to estimate hourly average personal exposure, mainly because they are affected by very different sources. [Display omitted] •Particle number concentrations were monitored in three widely separated cities.•Data from personal sampling and fixed station measurements were compared.•Agreement was good over long averaging periods such as 24 h.•Agreement was poor over short periods such as hourly.•Reasons for the differences are presented and discussed.\n\nPRASHANT KUMAR, HAMID OMIDVARBORNA, ARVIND TIWARI, LIDIA HALINA MORAWSKA (2021)The nexus between in-car aerosol concentrations, ventilation and the risk of respiratory infection, In: Environment International157106814 Elsevier\n\nWe examined the trade-offs between in-car aerosol concentrations, ventilation and respiratory infection transmission under three ventilation settings: windows open (WO); windows closed with air-conditioning on ambient air mode (WC-AA); and windows closed with air-conditioning on recirculation (WC-RC). Forty-five runs, covering a total of 324 km distance on a 7.2-km looped route, were carried out three times a day (morning, afternoon, evening) to monitor aerosols (PM2.5; particulate matter WC-AA>WC-RC) due to the ingress of polluted outdoor air on urban routes. A clear trade-off, therefore, exists for the in-car air quality (icAQ) versus ventilation, where WC-RC showed the least aerosol concentrations (i.e. four-times lower compared with WO), but corresponded to elevated CO2 levels (i.e. five-times higher compared with WO) in 20 mins. We considered COVID-19 as an example of respiratory infection transmission. The probability of its transmission from an infected occupant in a five-seater car was estimated during different quanta generation rates (2-60.5 quanta hr-1) using the Wells-Riley model. In WO, the probability with 50%-efficient and without facemasks under normal speaking (9.4 quanta hr-1) varied only by upto 0.5%. It increased by 2-fold in WC-AA (\n\nLIDIA HALINA MORAWSKA, Tong Zhu, Nairui Liu, Mehdi Amouei Torkmahalleh, Maria de Fátima Andrade, Benjamin Barratt, Parya Broomandi, Giorgio Buonanno, Luis Carlos Belalcazar Ceron, Jianmin Chen, Yan Cheng, Greg Evans, Mario Gavidia, Hai Guo, Ivan Hanigan, Min Hu, Cheol H.

We compiled daily fine particle (PM2.5) data from 100 cities in five continents, investigated the trends of number, frequency, and duration of pollution episodes, and compared these with the baseline trend in air pollution. We showed that the factors contributing to these events are complex; however, long-term measures to abate emissions from all anthropogenic sources at all times is also the most efficient way to reduce the occurrence of severe air pollution events. In the short term, accurate forecasting systems of such events based on the meteorological conditions favouring their occurrence, together with effective emergency mitigation of anthropogenic sources, may lessen their magnitude and/or duration. However, there is no clear way of preventing events caused by natural sources affected by climate change, such as wildfires and desert dust outbreaks.\n\nA. Mikszewski, L. Stabile, G. Buonanno, L. Morawska (2021)The vaccination threshold for SARS-CoV-2 depends on the indoor setting and room ventilation, In: BMC infectious diseases21(1)pp. 1-1193 Springer Nature\n\nBackground Effective vaccines are now available for SARS-CoV-2 in the 2nd year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the necessary vaccination rate to safely lift occupancy controls in public buildings and return to pre-pandemic norms. The aim of this paper is to estimate setting-specific vaccination thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 to prevent sustained community transmission using classical principles of airborne contagion modeling. We calculated the airborne infection risk in three settings, a classroom, prison cell block, and restaurant, at typical ventilation rates, and then the expected number of infections resulting from this risk at varying percentages of occupant immunity. Results We estimate the setting-specific immunity threshold for control of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 to range from a low of 40% for a mechanically ventilation classroom to a high of 85% for a naturally ventilated restaurant. Conclusions If vaccination rates are limited to a theoretical minimum of approximately two-thirds of the population, enhanced ventilation above minimum standards for acceptable air quality is needed to reduce the frequency and severity of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events in high-risk indoor environments.\n\nGavin Pereira, Michelle L. Bell, Yasushi Honda, Jong-Tae Lee, Lidia Morawska, Bin Jalaludin (2021)Energy transitions, air quality and health, In: Environmental research letters16(2) IOP Publishing Ltd\n\nThe way we produce and use energy is transforming. Policy in this area intersects decisions that affect climate change, air quality, and the economy. The exponential increase in use of fossil fuel and nuclear energy has now essentially replaced human and animal energy (McKinney 2019 Curr. Pollut. Rep. 5 394-406; Solomon and Krishna 2011 Energy Policy 39 7422-31). These transitions have contributed to notable gains, such as improvements in mortality rates attributable to improved heating, water quality and transportation (Rayner 2012 Ecological Public Health : Reshaping the Conditions for Good health/Geof Rayner and Tim Lang (Abingdon, Oxon: Earthscan); Rosen 2015 A History of Public Health (Jhu Press); Pain 2017 Nature 551 S134-7; Cutler and Miller 2005 Demography 42 1-22). However, such transitions have also been accompanied by health detriments. Improvements in transportation and occupational efficiencies have promoted lifestyle transitions that have contributed to the chronic disease epidemic (Heath 2009 Am. J. Lifestyle Med. 3 27S-31S). Certain energy-related accidents and waste products have been long-established as carcinogenic (Guizard et al 2001 J. Epidemiol. Community Health 55 469; Cardis and Hatch 2011 Clin. Oncol. 23 251-60) and potential precursors to genetic mutations (Beir 1990 Health Effects of Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation (Washington, DC: National Academy of Sciences); Desouky et al 2015 J. Radiat. Res. Appl. Sci. 8 247-54). Moreover, air pollution emissions are increasingly becoming recognised as a major contributor the global burden of disease, particularly cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (Cohen et al 2017 Lancet 389 1907-18). Although renewable energies can be perceived as 'clean', the shift to renewables has been relatively more recent and consequently, less is known about associated health impacts. The life course of renewable energy begins with the process of manufacturing renewable technologies, includes the means of transportation for the distribution and collection of these technologies as well as the disposal of their waste products and subsequent contamination. All of these stages have potential to involve direct chemical exposures through the groundwater, soil or air; and have potential to affect health through indirect pathways. A relatively understudied area, and the topic of this Focus Issue on Energy Transitions, Air Quality and Health, is the relevance of energy transitions and their associated environmental factors in a contemporary setting, how such factors affect health now, and will affect health in future.\n\nJarek Kurnitski, Martin Kiil, Pawel Wargocki, Atze Boerstra, Olli Seppänen, Bjarne Olesen, Lidia Morawska (2021)Respiratory infection risk-based ventilation design method, In: Building and environment206pp. 108387-108387 Elsevier Ltd\n\nA new design method is proposed to calculate outdoor air ventilation rates to control respiratory infection risk in indoor spaces. We propose to use this method in future ventilation standards to complement existing ventilation criteria based on the perceived air quality and pollutant removal. The proposed method makes it possible to calculate the required ventilation rate at a given probability of infection and quanta emission rate. Present work used quanta emission rates for SARS-CoV-2 and consequently the method can be applied for other respiratory viruses with available quanta data. The method was applied to case studies representing typical rooms in public buildings. To reduce the probability of infection, the total airflow rate per infectious person revealed to be the most important parameter to reduce the infection risk. Category I ventilation rate prescribed in the EN 16798-1 standard satisfied many but not all type of spaces examined. The required ventilation rates started from about 80 L/s per room. Large variations between the results for the selected case studies made it impossible to provide a simple rule for estimating the required ventilation rates. Consequently, we conclude that to design rooms with a low infection risk the newly developed ventilation design method must be used. •New design method for respiratory infection risk-based ventilation rates•Provides the required ventilation rate at a given probability and quanta emission•Estimates a low-risk ventilation rate from the event reproduction number•Case studies show ventilation rates starting from about 80 L/s per room•Is proposed for ventilation standards to complement existing ventilation criteria\n\nParya Broomandi, Andrés Rodríguez-Seijo, Nasime Janatian, Aram Fathian, Aidana Tleuken, Kaveh Mohammadpour, David Galán-Madruga, Ali Jahanbakhshi, Jong Ryeol Kim, Alfrendo Satyanaga, Mehdi Bagheri, Lidia Morawska (2023)Health risk assessment of the European inhabitants exposed to contaminated ambient particulate matter by potentially toxic elements, In: Environmental pollution (1987)323pp. 121232-121232 Elsevier Ltd\n\nPM10-associated potential toxic elements (PTEs) can enter the respiratory system and cause health problems.

The Mann–Kendall trend test examined PM10's increasing or decreasing trend. Random Forest analysis was also used to analyse meteorological factors affecting PM10 in Europe. Hazard quotient and cancer risk were estimated using PM10-associated PTEs. Our results showed a decline in continental PM10 concentrations. The correlation between PM10 concentrations and temperature (−0.40), PBLH (−0.39), and precipitation were statistically strong (−0.21). The estimated Pearson correlation coefficients showed a statistically strong positive correlation between As & Pb, As & Cd, and Cd & Pb during 2013–2019, indicating a similar origin. PTEs with hazard quotients below one, regardless of subpopulation type, posed no noncancerous risk to Europeans. The hazard quotient values positively correlated with time, possibly due to elevated PTE levels. In our study on carcinogen pollution in Europe between 2013 and 2019, we found unacceptable levels of As, Cd, Ni, and Pb among adults, children, and infants. Carcinogenic risk rates were highest for children, followed by infants, adult women, and adult men. Therefore, besides monitoring and mitigating PM concentrations, effective control of PM sources is also needed.

Marks, Prachi Garnawat, PRASHANT KUMAR, Marie Thynell (2021)How to build Urbanome, the genome of the city?, In: Science of the Total Environment Elsevier\n\nThe world’s population is shifting to the cities, and consequently, cities worldwide are growing in number and in size. Cities are complex systems, making it extremely difficult to build and run cities in a way that all the elements of the system operate in harmony. Recently a concept of urbanome, the genome of the city was proposed to address this complexity. Here we first explore this concept and analogy, taking advantage of the potential of other ‘omics, modern data collection techniques, Big Data analysis methods and a transdisciplinary approach. Then, we propose a theoretical approach to build the urbanome as a means of quantifying and qualifying population outcomes, being a function of the form of an urban area including the built environment, the physical and social services it provides, and the population density.\n\nMamatha Tomson, PRASHANT KUMAR, Yendle Barwise, Pascal Perez, Hugh Forehead, Kristine French, Lidia Morawska, John F Watts (2021)Green infrastructure for air quality improvement in street canyons, In: Environment International146pp. 106288-106288 Elsevier Ltd\n\nStreet canyons are generally highly polluted urban environments due to high traffic emissions and impeded dispersion. Green infrastructure (GI) is one potential passive control system for air pollution in street canyons, yet optimum GI design is currently unclear. This review consolidates findings from previous research on GI in street canyons and assesses the suitability of different GI forms in terms of local air quality improvement. Studies on the effects of various GI options (trees, hedges, green walls, green screens and green roofs) are critically evaluated, findings are synthesised, and possible recommendations are summarised. In addition, various measurement methods used for quantifying the effectiveness of street greening for air pollution reduction are analysed. Finally, we explore the findings of studies that have compared plant species for pollution mitigation. We conclude that the influences of different GI options on air quality in street canyons depend on street canyon geometry, meteorological conditions and vegetation characteristics. Green walls, green screens and green roofs are potentially viable GI options in existing street canyons, where there is typically a lack of available planting space. Particle deposition to leaves is usually quantified by leaf washing experiments or by microscopy imaging techniques, the latter of which indicates size distribution and is more accurate. The pollutant reduction capacity of a plant species largely depends on its macromorphology in relation to the physical environment. Certain micromorphological leaf traits also positively correlate with deposition, including grooves, ridges, trichomes, stomatal density and epicuticular wax amount. The complexity of street canyon environments and the limited number of previous studies on novel forms of GI in street canyons mean that offering specific recommendations is currently unfeasible. This review highlights a need for further research, particularly on green walls and green screens, to substantiate their efficacy and investigate technical considerations.\n\nMeng Xiu, Rohan Jayaratne, Phong Thai, Bryce Christensen, Isak Zing, Xiaoting Liu, Lidia Morawska (2022)Evaluating the applicability of the ratio of PM2.5 and carbon monoxide as source signatures, In: Environmental pollution (1987)306 Elsevier\n\nAir pollution is among the top risk faced by people around the world, and therefore combating it is among the top priorities. It begins with identifying the sources that contribute the most to local air pollution to prioritize their control. There are advanced methods for source identification and apportionment, but such methods are not available in many low-income countries and not everywhere in all high-income countries. We propose a simplified method by using source the signatures to help obtain information about the local source contribution if no other methods are available. Using low-cost monitors, particle mass (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were measured and the ratio of CO/PM2.5 was determined. We investigated outdoor and indoor sources, including vehicular exhaust, combustion of biomass, incense and mosquito coil burning, and cigarette smoking. The results show that the ratios differed significantly between certain pollutant sources. Compressed natural gas (CNG) engines have a high ratio (mean value of 972 +/- 419), which is attributed to relatively low PM2.5 emissions, while ship emissions and cigarette smoke recorded a relatively low ratio. Most traffic emissions recorded higher ratios than those of bushfire emissions, and ratios of most outdoor pollutant sources were much higher than those of indoor pollutant sources. There is a clear trend for ratios to decrease from high to low for CNG, petrol, diesel for buses, and fuel for ships. Our results suggest that the ratio of CO/PM2.5 can be used as an effective method to identify pollution sources.\n\nHmwe Hmwe Kyu, Degu Abate, Kalkidan Hassen Abate, Solomon M.

Murray (2018)Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 359 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, In: The Lancet (British edition)392(10159)pp. 1859-1922 Elsevier\n\nBackground How long one lives, how many years of life are spent in good and poor health, and how the population's state of health and leading causes of disability change over time all have implications for policy, planning, and provision of services. We comparatively assessed the patterns and trends of healthy life expectancy (HALE), which quantifies the number of years of life expected to be lived in good health, and the complementary measure of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a composite measure of disease burden capturing both premature mortality and prevalence and severity of ill health, for 359 diseases and injuries for 195 countries and territories over the past 28 years. Methods We used data for age-specific mortality rates, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality, and years lived with disability (YLDs) from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to calculate HALE and DALYs from 1990 to 2017. We calculated HALE using age-specific mortality rates and YLDs per capita for each location, age, sex, and year. We calculated DALYs for 359 causes as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We assessed how observed HALE and DALYs differed by country and sex from expected trends based on Sociodemographic Index (SDI). We also analysed HALE by decomposing years of life gained into years spent in good health and in poor health, between 1990 and 2017, and extra years lived by females compared with males. Findings Globally, from 1990 to 2017, life expectancy at birth increased by 7.4 years (95% uncertainty interval 74-7.8), from 65.6 years (65.3-65- 8) in 1990 to 73.0 years (72.7-73.3) in 2017. The increase in years of life varied from 5.1 years (5.0-5.3) in high SDI countries to 12.0 years (11.3-12.8) in low SDI countries. Of the additional years of life expected at birth, 26.3% (20.1-33.1) were expected to be spent in poor health in high SDI countries compared with 11.7% (8.8-15.1) in low-middle SDI countries. HALE at birth increased by 6.3 years (5.9-6.7), from 57.0 years (54.6-59.1) in 1990 to 63.3 years (60.5-65.7) in 2017. The increase varied from 3.8 years (3.4-4.1) in high SDI countries to 10.5 years (9.8-11.2) in low SDI countries. Even larger variations in HALE than these were observed between countries, ranging from 1.0 year (0.4-1.7) in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (62.4 years [59.9-64.7] in 1990 to 63.5 years [60.9-65.8] in 2017) to 23.7 years (21.9-25.6) in Eritrea (30.7 years [28.9-32.2] in 1990 to 54.4 years [51.5-57.1] in 2017). In most countries, the increase in HALE was smaller than the increase in overall life expectancy, indicating more years lived in poor health. In 180 of 195 countries and territories, females were expected to live longer than males in 2017, with extra years lived varying from 1.4 years (0.6-2.3) in Algeria to 11.9 years (10.9-12.9) in Ukraine. Of the extra years gained, the proportion spent in poor health varied largely across countries, with less than 20% of additional years spent in poor health in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, and Slovakia, whereas in Bahrain all the extra years were spent in poor health. In 2017, the highest estimate of HALE at birth was in Singapore for both females (75.8 years [72.4-78.7]) and males (72.6 years [69 \" 8-75.0]) and the lowest estimates were in Central African Republic (47.0 years [43.7-50.2] for females and 42.8 years [40.1-45.6] for males). Globally, in 2017, the five leading causes of DALYs were neonatal disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 41.3% (38.8-43.5) for communicable diseases and by 49\"8% (47.9-51.6) for neonatal disorders. For non-communicable diseases, global DALYs increased by 40.1% (36.8-43.0), although age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 18.1% (16.0-20.2). Interpretation With increasing life expectancy in most countries, the question of whether the additional years of life gained are spent in good health or poor health has been increasingly relevant because of the potential policy implications, such as health-care provisions and extending retirement ages. In some locations, a large proportion of those additional years are spent in poor health. Large inequalities in HALE and disease burden exist across countries in different SDI quintiles and between sexes. The burden of disabling conditions has serious implications for health system planning and health-related expenditures. Despite the progress made in reducing the burden of communicable diseases and neonatal disorders in low S DI countries, the speed of this progress could be increased by scaling up proven interventions. The global trends among non-communicable diseases indicate that more effort is needed to maximise HALE, such as risk prevention and attention to upstream determinants of health.

Laboratory experiments typically involve investigating the effects of environmental parameters on the viability or infectivity of a target airborne virus. However, conflicting results among studies are common. Herein, the results of 34 aerovirology studies were compared to identify links between environmental and compositional effects on the viability of airborne viruses. While the specific experimental apparatus was not a factor in variability between reported results, it was determined that the experimental procedure was a major factor that contributed to discrepancies in results. The most significant contributor to variability between studies was poorly defined initial viable virus concentration in the aerosol phase, causing many studies to not measure the rapid inactivation, which occurs quickly after particle generation, leading to conflicting results. Consistently, studies that measured their reference airborne viability minutes after aerosolization reported higher viability at subsequent times, which indicates that there is an initial loss of viability which is not captured in these studies. The composition of the particles which carry the viruses was also found to be important in the viability of airborne viruses; however, the mechanisms for this effect are unknown. Temperature was found to be important for aerosol-phase viability, but there is a lack of experiments that directly compare the effects of temperature in the aerosol phase and the bulk phase. There is a need for repeated measurements between different research groups under identical conditions both to assess the degree of variability between studies and also to attempt to better understand already published data. Lack of experimental standardization has hindered the ability to quantify the differences between studies, for which we provide recommendations for future studies. These recommendations are as follows: measuring the reference airborne viability using the \"direct method\"; use equipment which maximizes time resolution; quantify all losses appropriately; perform, at least, a 5- and 10-min sample, if possible; report clearly the composition of the virus suspension; measure the composition of the gas throughout the experiment. Implementing these recommendations will address the most significant oversights in the existing literature and produce data which can more easily be quantitatively compared.\n\nPengju Liu, Longyi Shao, Yaxing Zhang, Ville Silvonen, Henry Oswin, Yaxin Cao, Ziyu Guo, Xuying Ma, Lidia Morawska (2023)Comparative study on physicochemical characteristics of atmospheric microplastics in winter in inland and coastal megacities: A case of Beijing and Shanghai, China, In: The Science of the total environment169308 Elsevier\n\nAtmospheric microplastics (MPs) have received global attention across various sectors of society due to their potential negative impacts. This study aims to understand the physicochemical characteristics of MPs in inland and coastal megacities for raising awareness about the urgent need to reduce plastic pollution. Laser Direct Infrared Imaging (LDIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) techniques were employed to characterize atmospheric MPs in megacities (inland megacity Beijing and coastal megacity Shanghai) in China, focusing on their physicochemical characteristics, including compositional types, number concentration, morphology, size, possible sources, and potential health risks. The LDIR analysis identified sixteen different types of MPs present in the atmospheres of Beijing and Shanghai. The number concentration of atmospheric MPs in Beijing (3.0 items/m ) is 1.8 times that of Shanghai (1.7 items/m ). The study found that the variations in MP pollution between Beijing and Shanghai are influenced by the urban industrial structure and geographical location. Morphological analysis indicates that fragment MPs have the highest relative abundance in Beijing, while fibrous MPs dominate the atmosphere of Shanghai. Additionally, the study assessed the potential health risks of atmospheric MPs to urban residents. The results suggest that residents of Beijing face more severe health risks from atmospheric MPs compared to those in Shanghai. These findings underscore the urgency to address the issue of atmospheric MPs and provide crucial evidence for the formulation of relevant environmental and health policies.\n\nLina Wang, Wen Wen, Yu Gu, Jianwen Mao, Xiao Tong, Boyue Jia, Jiaqian Yan, Ke Zhu, Zhe Bai, Wei Zhang, Longbo Shi, Yingjun Chen, Lidia Morawska, Jianmin Chen, Li-Hao Huang (2023)Characterization of Biodiesel and Diesel Combustion Particles: Chemical Composition, Lipid Metabolism, and Implications for Health and Environment, In: Environmental science & technology57(49)pp. 20460-20469 American Chemical Society\n\nBiodiesel, derived from alkyl esters of vegetable oils or animal fats, has gained prominence as a greener alternative to diesel due to its reduced particle mass. However, it remains debatable whether biodiesel exposure has more severe health issues than diesel. This study performed high-resolution mass spectrometry to examine the detailed particle chemical compositions and lipidomics analysis of human lung epithelial cells treated with emissions from biodiesel and diesel fuels. Results show the presence of the peak substances of CHO compounds in biodiesel combustion that contain a phthalate ester (PAEs) structure (e.g., n-amyl isoamyl phthalate and diisobutyl phthalate). PAEs have emerged as persistent organic pollutants across various environmental media and are known to possess endocrine-disrupting properties in the environment. We further observed that biodiesel prevents triglyceride storage compared to diesel and inhibits triglycerides from becoming phospholipids, particularly with increased phosphatidylglycerols (PGs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), which potentially could lead to a higher probability of cancer metastasis.\n\nLidia Morawska, Joseph Allen, William Bahnfleth, Belinda Bennett, Philomena M Bluyssen, Atze Boerstra, Giorgio Buonanno, Junji Cao, Stephanie J Dancer, Andres Floto, Francesco Franchimon, Trish Greenhalgh, Charles Haworth, Jaap Hogeling, Christina Isaxon, Jose L Jimenez, Amanda Kennedy, Prashant Kumar, Jarek Kurnitski, Yuguo Li, Marcel Loomans, Guy Marks, Linsey C Marr, Livio Mazzarella, Arsen Krikor Melikov, Shelly L Miller, Donald K Milton, Jason Monty, Peter V Nielsen, Catherine Noakes, Jordan Peccia, Kimberly A Prather, Xavier Querol, Tunga Salthammer, Chandra Sekhar, Olli Seppänen, Shin-Ichi Tanabe, Julian W Tang, Raymond Tellier, Kwok Wai Tham, Pawel Wargocki, Aneta Wierzbicka, Maosheng Yao (2024)Mandating indoor air quality for public buildings, In: Science383(6690)pp. 1418-1420 American Association for the Advancement of Science\n\nPeople living in urban and industrialized societies, which are expanding globally, spend more than 90% of their time in the indoor environment, breathing indoor air (IA). Despite decades of research and advocacy, most countries do not have legislated indoor air quality (IAQ) performance standards for public spaces that address concentration levels of IA pollutants (1). Few building codes address operation, maintenance, and retrofitting, and most do not focus on airborne disease transmission. But the COVID-19 pandemic has made all levels of society, from community members to decision-makers, realize the importance of IAQ for human health, wellbeing, productivity, and learning. We propose that IAQ standards be mandatory for public spaces. Although enforcement of IAQ performance standards in homes is not possible, homes must be designed and equipped so that they could meet the standards.\n\nPrashant Kumar, Sisay Debele, Soheila Khalili, Christos H.

Yet, the risk of urban overheating can be mitigated by urban green-blue-grey infrastructures (GBGI), such as parks, wetlands, and engineered greening, which have the potential to effectively reduce summer air temperatures. Despite many reviews, the evidence bases on quantified GBGI cooling benefits remains partial and the practical recommendations for implementation are unclear. This systematic literature review synthesises the evidence base for heat mitigation and related co-benefits, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes recommendations for their implementation to maximise their benefits. After screening 27,486 papers, 202 were reviewed, based on 51 GBGI types categorised under 10 main divisions. Certain GBGI (green walls, parks, street trees) have been well-researched for their urban cooling capabilities. However, several other GBGI have received negligible (zoological garden, golf course, estuary) or minimal (private garden, allotment) attention. The most efficient air cooling was observed in botanical gardens (5.0±3.5°C), wetlands (4.9±3.2°C), green walls (4.1±4.2°C), street trees (3.8±3.1°C), and vegetated balconies (3.8±2.7°C). Under changing climate conditions (2070-2100) with consideration of RCP8.5, there is a shift in climate subtypes, either within the same climate zone (e.g., Dfa to Dfb and Cfb to Cfa) or across other climate zones (e.g., Dfb (continental warm-summer humid) to BSk (dry, cold semi-arid) and Cwa (temperate) to Am (tropical)). These shifts may result in lower efficiency for the current GBGI in the future. Given the importance of multiple services, it is crucial to balance their functionality, cooling performance, and other related co-benefits when planning for the future GBGI. This global GBGI heat mitigation inventory can assist policymakers and urban planners in prioritising effective interventions to reduce the risk of urban overheating, filling research gaps, and promoting community resilience.

As this will lead to a worsening of air quality, we have to look intensively at the matter of how we can create healthy living environments in areas with extreme air conditions. In order to serve primarily the efficient use of energy and the optimization of ventilation technology connected with new ways of constructing buildings (low energy and passive houses), “smart home technology” was introduced also in private homes. Facing demographic change, higher demands on a comfortable life and advancing mechanization of everyday life, sensor technology is increasingly implemented in order to create acceptable and improved living conditions. Thus, the term “smart home” is also linked today with the networking of home automation systems, home appliances and communications and entertainment electronics. In general, low-energy houses, which as a rule have a system of artificial ventilation, require special technologies to achieve good indoor air quality. Using modern sensor technology, it is possible to monitor not only the climatic parameters, but also the concentrations of air polluting substances, such e.g. carbon dioxide, sum parameters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particles and record them in Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS). Indoor air quality and air hygiene are taken now as important aspects of smart home technology. Nevertheless, living in a smart home often puts demands on the occupants who are required to change some of their living habits. Due to the significant impact of smart home technology on everyday life in the near future, the authors have summarized the actual state-of-the-art of housing technology on indoor air quality, individual thermal comfort and living behaviour for the temperate climate zone. The main findings will be presented at the conference.\n\nElisa Caracci, Luca Stabile, Andrea R.

Information on respiratory particle emission rates is mostly available for adults (few studies have investigated adolescents and children) and generally involves a limited number of subjects. In the present paper we attempted to reduce this knowledge gap by conducting an extensive experimental campaign to measure the emission of respiratory particles of more than 400 children aged 6 to 12 years while they pronounced a phonetically balanced word list at two different voice intensity levels (“speaking” and “loudly speaking”). Respiratory particle concentrations, particle distributions, and exhaled air flow rates were measured to estimate the respiratory particle emission rate. Sound pressure levels were also simultaneously measured. We found out that median respiratory particle emission rates for speaking and loudly speaking were 26 particles s −1 (range 7.1–93 particles s −1 ) and 41 particles s −1 (range 10–146 particles s −1 ), respectively. Children sex was significant for emission rates, with higher emission rates for males during both speaking and loudly speaking. No effect of age on the emission rates was identified.

Air pollution from landscape fires can negatively affect human health 4 – 6 , but human exposure to landscape fire-sourced (LFS) air pollution has not been well characterized at the global scale 7 – 23 . Here, we estimate global daily LFS outdoor fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and surface ozone concentrations at 0.25° × 0.25° resolution during the period 2000–2019 with the help of machine learning and chemical transport models. We found that overall population-weighted average LFS PM 2.5 and ozone concentrations were 2.5 µg m −3 (6.1% of all-source PM 2.5 ) and 3.2 µg m −3 (3.6% of all-source ozone), respectively, in 2010–2019, with a slight increase for PM 2.5 , but not for ozone, compared with 2000–2009. Central Africa, Southeast Asia, South America and Siberia experienced the highest LFS PM 2.5 and ozone concentrations. The concentrations of LFS PM 2.5 and ozone were about four times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. During the period 2010–2019, 2.18 billion people were exposed to at least 1 day of substantial LFS air pollution per year, with each person in the world having, on average, 9.9 days of exposure per year. These two metrics increased by 6.8% and 2.1%, respectively, compared with 2000–2009. Overall, we find that the global population is increasingly exposed to LFS air pollution, with socioeconomic disparities. The global population is increasingly exposed to daily landscape fire-sourced air pollution but there are socioeconomic disparities, with this pollution four times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries during the period 2000–2019.\n\nChristina Higgins, Prashant Kumar, Lídia Morawska (2024)Indoor Air Quality Monitoring and Source Apportionment Using Low-Cost Sensors, In: Environmental Research Communications IOP Publishing\n\nUnderstanding of the various sources of indoor air pollution requires indoor air quality (IAQ) data that is usually lacking. Such data can be obtained using unobtrusive, low-cost sensors (LCS). The aim of this review is to examine the recent literature published on LCS for IAQ measurements and to determine whether these studies employed any methods to identify or quantify sources of indoor air pollution. Studies were reviewed in terms of whether any methods of source apportionment were employed, as well as the microenvironment type, geographical location, and several metrics relating to the contribution of outdoor pollutant ingress versus potential indoor pollutant sources. We found that out of 60 relevant studies, just four employed methods for source apportionment, all of which utilised receptor models. Most studies were undertaken in residential or educational environments. There is a lack of data on IAQ in other types of microenvironments and in locations outside of Europe and North America. There are inherent limitations with LCS in terms of producing data which can be utilised in source apportionment models. This applies to external pollution data, however IAQ can be even more challenging to measure due to its characteristics. The indoor environment is heterogeneous, with significant variability within the space as well as between different microenvironments and locations. Sensor placement, occupancy, and activity reports, as well as measurements in different microenvironments and locations, can contribute to understanding this variability. Outdoor pollutants can ingress into the space via the building envelope, however measurement of external pollution and environmental conditions, as well as recording details on the building fabric and ventilation conditions, can help apportion external contributions. Whether or not source apportionment models are employed on indoor data from LCS, there are parameters which, if carefully considered during measurement campaigns, can aid in source identification of pollutants.\n\nXiang Xiao, Ruixia Liu, Yunjiang Yu, Zheng Zhang, Luke D Knibbs, Bin Jalaludin, Lidia Morawska, Shyamali C Dharmage, Joachim Heinrich, Stefania Papatheodorou, Yuming Guo, Yangyang Xu, Ling Jin, Yike Guo, Wentao Yue, Jilong Yao, Yue Zhang, Chengrong Wang, Shen Gao, Enjie Zhang, Shaofei Su, Tong Zhu, Guang-Hui Dong, Meng Gao, Chenghong Yin (2023)Evidence of interactive effects of late-pregnancy exposure to air pollution and extreme temperature on preterm birth in China: a nationwide study, In: Environmental research letters18(9) IOP Publishing\n\nMahesh Senarathna, Sajith Priyankara, Rohan Jayaratne, Rohan Weerasooriya, Lidia Morawska, Gayan Bowatte (2022)Measuring TrafficRelated Air Pollution Using Smart Sensors In Sri Lanka: Before And During A New Traffic Plan, In: Geography, environment, sustainability15(3)pp. 27-36\n\nMotor vehicle emissions are the primary air pollution source in cities worldwide. Changes in traffic flow in a city can drastically change overall levels of air pollution. The level of air pollution may vary significantly in some street segments compared to others, and a small number of stationary ambient air pollution monitors may not capture this variation. This study aimed to evaluate air pollution before and during a new traffic plan established in March 2019 in the city of Kandy, Sri Lanka, using smart sensor technology. Street level air pollution data (PM2.5 and NO2 ) was acquired using a mobile air quality sensor unit before and during the implementation of the new traffic plan. The sensor unit was mounted on a police traffic motorcycle that travelled through the city four times per day. Air pollution in selected road segments was compared before and during the new traffic plan, and the trends at different times of the day were compared using data from a stationary smart sensor. Both PM2.5 and NO2 levels were well above the World Health Organization (WHO) 24-hour guidelines during the monitoring period, regardless of the traffic plan period. Most of the road segments had comparatively higher air pollution levels during compared to before the new traffic plan. For any given time (morning, midday, afternoon, evening), day of the week, and period (before or during the new traffic plan), the highest PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were observed at the road segment from Girls High School to Kandy Railway Station. The mobile air pollution monitoring data provided evidence that the mean concentration of PM2.5 during the new traffic plan (116.7 µg m-3) was significantly higher than before the new traffic plan (92.3 µg m-3) (p < 0.007). Increasing spatial coverage can provide much better information on human exposure to air pollutants, which is essential to control traffic related air pollution. Before implementing a new traffic plan, careful planning and improvement of road network infrastructure could reduce air pollution in urban areas.\n\nBackground: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3·9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1-4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7·2% (6·0-8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9% (6·6-9·2) for males and 6·5% (5·4-7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Interpretation: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.\n\nGBD Risk Factor Collaborators, Lidia Halina Morawska (2019)Department of error Elsevier\n\nWenzhong Huang, Yang Zhou, Xi Chen, Xiaowen Zeng, Luke D.

Western Pacific Elsevier Ltd\n\nEvidence on the associations between long-term exposure to multiple air pollutants and cardiopulmonary mortality is limited, especially for developing regions with higher pollutant levels. We aimed to characterise the individual and joint (multi-pollutant) associations of long-term exposure to air pollutants with cardiopulmonary mortality, and to identify air pollutant that primarily contributes to the mortality risk. We followed 37,442 participants with a mean age of 43.5 years in four cities in northern China (Tianjin, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and Rizhao) from January 1998 to December 2019. Annual particulate matter (PM) with diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), ≤10 μm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were estimated using daily average values from satellite-derived machine learning models and monitoring stations. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the individual association between air pollutants and mortality from non-accidental causes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), non-malignant respiratory diseases (RDs) and lung cancer, accounting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. Effect modifications by age, sex, income and education level were also examined. Quantile-based g-Computation integrated with time-to-event data was additionally applied to evaluate the co-effects and the relative weight of contributions for air pollutants. During 785,807 person-years of follow-up, 5812 (15.5%) died from non-accidental causes, among which 2932 (7.8%) were from all CVDs, 479 (1.3%) from non-malignant RDs, and 552 (1.4%) from lung cancer. Long-term exposure to PM10 (mean [baseline]: 136.5 μg/m3), PM2.5 (mean [baseline]: 70.2 μg/m3), SO2 (mean [baseline]: 113.0 μg/m3) and NO2 (mean [baseline]: 39.2 μg/m3) were adversely and consistently associated with all mortality outcomes. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with higher mortality from non-accidental causes (hazard ratio 1.20; 95% confidence interval 1.17–1.23), CVDs (1.23; 1.19–1.28), non-malignant RDs (1.37; 1.25–1.49) and lung cancer (1.14; 1.05–1.23). A monotonically increasing curve with linear or supra-linear shape with no evidence of a threshold was observed for the exposure-response relationship of mortality with individual or joint exposure to air pollutants. PM2.5 consistently contributed most to the elevated mortality risks related to air pollutant mixture, followed by SO2 or PM10. There was a strong and positive association of long-term individual and joint exposure to PM10, PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 with mortalities from non-accidental causes, CVDs, non-malignant RDs and lung cancer in high-exposure settings, with PM2.5 potentially being the main contributor. The shapes of associations were consistent with a linear or supra-linear exposure-response relationship, with no lower threshold observed within the range of concentrations in this study.

Outdoor data were retrieved from a station located within the urban area of Lisbon and simulations were performed involving school children. Two scenarios were applied: one where only outdoor data were used assuming an outdoor exposure scenario, and a second one where an actual exposure scenario was adopted using the actual microenvironment during typical school days. Personal PM and PM dose (actual exposure scenario) was 23.4% and 20.2% higher than the ambient (outdoor exposure scenario) PM and PM doses, respectively. The incorporation of the hygroscopic growth in the calculations increased the ambient dose of PM and PM by 8.8% and 21.7%, respectively. Regression analysis between the ambient and personal dose showed no linearity with R at 0.07 for PM and 0.22 for PM . On the other hand, linear regression between the ambient and school indoor dose showed no linearity (R = 0.01) for PM but moderate (R = 0.48) for PM . These results demonstrate that ambient data must be used with caution for the representativeness of a realistic personal dose of PM while for PM the ambient data cannot be used as a surrogate of a realistic personal dose of school children.\n\nLidia Morawska, Congrong He (2018)Indoor Particles, Combustion Products and Fibres, In: Indoor Air Pollutionpp. 37-68 Springer Berlin Heidelberg\n\nPollutants in the indoor environment are a complex mixture of gases, vapours and particles in either liquid or solid phase, suspended in the air, settled or adsorbed on or attached to indoor surfaces. The pollutants originate from a multiplicity of indoor and outdoor sources. The pollutant mixture is dynamic, involved in numerous physical and chemical processes and changing its characteristics with time. Its composition and concentration depend on the strengths of indoor sources, pollutants’ concentration outside and the properties of heating ventilation and air conditioning systems. The spatial distribution of pollutant concentration within the indoor environment is often inhomogeneous. Particulate matter in the indoor environment includes particles, which are airborne as well as those which are settled on indoor surfaces, dust. The particles vary in chemical properties, which depend on the origin of the particles and differ for particles in different size ranges. The particles can, for example, be combustion or nucleation products, dust or bioaerosols and can act as carriers of adsorbed chemicals, bio-contaminants or condensed gases. Particles are a key component of emissions from all the combustion sources. In particular, a significant indoor combustion product, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a mixture of particle and gaseous products of smoke exhaled to the air by smokers and mixed with the smoke resulting from smouldering of a cigarette between the puffs. This chapter is focused on particulate matter, its origin, characteristics and behaviour in the indoor environment. In addition, several important classes of indoor pollutants are discussed, those which are entirely or partially composed of particulate matter. These include ETS and combustion products from other sources, such as wood smoke or vehicle emissions, and also fibres, in particular, asbestos.\n\nSheikh Mohammed Shariful Islam, Ralph Maddison, Riaz Uddin, Kylie Ball, Katherine M Livingstone, Asaduzzaman Khan, Jo Salmon, Ilana N Ackerman, Tim Adair, Oyelola A Adegboye, Zanfina Ademi, Ripon Kumar Adhikary, Bright Opoku Ahinkorah, Khurshid Alam, Kefyalew Addis Alene, Sheikh Mohammad Alif, Azmeraw T Amare, Edward Kwabena Ameyaw, Leopold N Aminde, Deanna Anderlini, Blake Angell, Adnan Ansar, Benny Antony, Anayochukwu Edward Anyasodor, Victoria Kiriaki Arnet, Thomas Astell-Burt, Prince Atorkey, Mamaru Ayenew Awoke, Beatriz Paulina Ayala Quintanilla, Getinet Ayano, Nasser Bagheri, Anthony Barnett, Bernhard T Baune, Dinesh Bhandari, Sonu Bhaskar, Raaj Kishore Biswas, Rohan Borschmann, Soufiane Boufous, Andrew M Briggs, Rachelle Buchbinder, Norma B Bulamu, Richard A Burns, Andre F Carvalho, Ester Cerin, Nicolas Cherbuin, Enayet Karim Chowdhury, Liliana G Ciobanu, Scott Richard Clark, Marita Cross, Abel Fekadu Dadi, Barbora de Courten, Diego De Leo, Katie de Luca, Kerrie E Doyle, David Edvardsson, Kristina Edvardsson, Ferry Efendi, Aklilu Endalamaw, Nelsensius Klau Fauk, Xiaoqi Feng, Bernadette Mary Fitzgibbon, Joanne Flavel, Eyob Alemayehu Alemayehu Gebreyohannes, Hailay Abrha Gesesew, Tiffany K Gill, Myron Anthony Godinho, Bhawna Gupta, Vivek Kumar Gupta, Mitiku Teshome Hambisa, Mohammad Hamiduzzaman, Graeme J Hankey, Hossein Hassanian-Moghaddam, Simon I Hay, Jeffrey J Hebert, M Mamun Huda, Tanvir M Huda, M Mofizul Islam, Mohammad Saidul Islam, Rakibul M Islam, Billingsley Kaambwa, Himal Kandel, Gizat M Kassie, Jaimon Terence Kelly, Jessica A Kerr, Girmay Tsegay Kiross, Luke D Knibbs, Vishnutheertha Vishnutheertha Kulkarni, Ratilal Lalloo, Long Khanh Dao Le, James Leigh, Janni Leung, Shanshan Li, Rashidul Alam Mahumud, Abdullah A Mamun, Melvin Barrientos Marzan, John J McGrath, Max L Mehlman, Atte Meretoja, Amanual Getnet Mersha, Ted R Miller, Philip B Mitchell, Ali H Mokdad, Lidia Morawska, Christine Mpundu-Kaambwa, William Mude, Christopher J L Murray, Sandhya Neupane Kandel, Tafadzwa Nyanhanda, Kehinde O Obamiro, Amy E Peden, Konrad Pesudovs, Kevan R Polkinghorne, Azizur Rahman, Muhammad Aziz Rahman, Zubair Ahmed Ratan, Lal Rawal, Lennart Reifels, Andre M N Renzaho, Stephen R Robinson, Danial Roshandel, Susan Fred Rumisha, Paul A Saunders, Susan M Sawyer, Markus P Schlaich, Aletta Elisabeth Schutte, Abdul-Aziz Seidu, Saurab Sharma, Seyed Afshin Shorofi, Soraya Siabani, Ambrish Singh, Balbir Bagicha Singh, Helen Slater, Jacqueline H Stephens, Mark A Stokes, Narayan Subedi Subedi, Chandra Datta Sumi, Jing Sun, Johan Sundström, Cassandra E I Szoeke, Santosh Kumar Tadakamadla, Ken Takahashi, Jo Taylor, Melkamu B Tessema Tessema, Amanda G Thrift, Quyen G To, Daniel Nigusse Tollosa, Mai Thi Ngoc Tran, Corneel Vandelanotte, Blesson Mathew Varghese, Lennert J Veerman, Ning Wang, Paul Ward, Mark Woodward, Befikadu Legesse Wubishet, Xiaoyue Xu, Pengpeng Ye, Sojib Bin Zaman, Amin Zarghami, Jianrong Zhang, David A Crawford, (2023)The burden and trend of diseases and their risk factors in Australia, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, In: The Lancet.
