        "text": "During the heated debate leading up to the Senate's ratification of the Clinton administration's decision to enlarge NATO, opponents predicted that expansion would alienate Russia, with dire consequences for world peace. Nevertheless, by a vote of 80 to 19, the Senate endorsed the policy on 30 April 1998. One by one, over the ensuing months, parliaments in other NATO member countries ratified the expansion decision as well. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic became the newest members of NATO in a ceremony held in Independence, Missouri, on 12 March 1999. The crisis in Kosovo that occasioned NATO military action against the Russian-favored Yugoslavian government and its president, Slobodan Milosevic, has ended. However, the issues of NATO expansion and Kosovo will no doubt figure prominently in the Russian presidential election in June 2000. The time is right to take stock and ask: Have recent NATO decisions discredited the liberal Rus- sian political parties and strengthened the conservative ultranationalist and Com- munist parties? In this article I will provide a framework for assessing the impact of the NATO expansion policy on internal Russian politics and public opinion after 1999, using the positions and motivations of the Russian political parties. After a brief discussion of the Boris Yeltsin administration's viewpoint, I will summarize the views of each of the other key parties across the political spectrum at that time and will show that, while most Russian political parties opposed the expansion policy, they did so for different reasons.\n\nWithin five years of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, ethnic conflicts spilled throughout its territory, most of them in the Russian Federation. An analysis of scope and intensity of a conflict with one of Russia’s two hundred ethnic minorities is the focus of this book. The conflict in Chechnya erupted into two full-scale wars, fought during the decade of Russia’s turbulent transition from communism toward democracy. Using a variety of sources–governmental documents, monographs, diaries of military and political leaders, reports, and contemporary periodicals–the author examines the roots of the conflict and responses to the wars from the media, political parties, and diplomatic circles in Russia and the United States. The Chechen wars have demonstrated the limits of the concept of self-determination for an abused minority population. The military operation in Chechnya has eroded Russian democracy and strengthened those within the military and security forces who call for a return to the old ways. For many in today’s Russian elite, the restoration of the lost Soviet empire might be the ultimate objective. The developments in the future deserve the world's attention."
