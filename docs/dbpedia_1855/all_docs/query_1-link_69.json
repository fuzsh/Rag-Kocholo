        "text": "Ramadān/Shawwā1429\n\nWHY?…CREED DOES MATTER\n\nThe Lord over all revealed to us,\n\nToday, I have completed your religion, perfected My favour on you and am pleased for you to have Islam as a religion.[1]\n\nWhen the believers hear such words, their hearts enliven to the truth and the good that is in what Allah has revealed to His Slaves.\n\nThis is the very Islam that has been revealed one time in the Book and the Sunnah, understood, codified and amplified by the first three generations and passed down infallibly generation to generation. Allah said of this very Islam,\n\nAnd whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter, he will be one of the losers.[2]\n\nThere is no mistake in that this is the true faith. This is what has been given to us and we earnestly desire that others should know the goodness that we have when they are unbelievers. We want for these unbelievers, whether it be a family member, neighbour or work colleague, to know this truth.\n\nThere are even some people who have rejected this faith and then come back home after such a long time away in the wilderness. Others may have been in the faith, but were weak, then grew in strength and Allah favoured them with further guidance.\n\nRegardless of all these categories, these people face the same challenges when coming back to or entering the faith. We read the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and we hear, reflect on and apprehend the truth of Islam.\n\nBut there is a problem comprehending it. While it is true that there is one Islam, there have also been ‘islams’ introduced into the discourse of faith, doing nothing but adding more dizzying confusion to the already weary common Muslim.\n\nThese ‘little islams’ each have their own tenets, aspects of religious devotion and foundational beliefs. Previously, they had been contemptuous of one another until they came to places such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and so on.\n\nNow the various islams, while holding their own peculiar world view, recognise one another’s existence, calling for ‘tolerance, acceptance and mutual understanding.’ Perhaps what can be viewed as theological pragmatism has forced them together.\n\nIn the Muslim heartlands, where some of them festered and grew from strength to strength, they took for granted their followers’ acceptance of their tenets. But touching down in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco (California), Corvalis, Astoria, Ashland (Oregon) or Seattle (Washington) opened a whole new chapter in their history. They could no longer take for granted that they would exist in perpetuity. And this is what caused the ‘islams’ to reach out to one another.\n\nIn an age of religious relativism, the slogan ‘love for all, hatred for none’ rings in our ears frequently. ‘The Muslim is whoever says or feels he is Muslim,’ the oft cited statement of the claimant to Islam, can be heard from the metropolis to the small town.\n\nSo in cases where someone should seek a baseline, a foundation, a principle to try to reach the original kernel of Islam, they find opposition. Sincere common believers, who take absolute truth seriously, find it distressing to be told, ‘Listen, if someone believes different to you, just let him develop.\n\nIt’s a growing process. People grow in their Islam and they may use this as a stepping stone. But it’s not for us to condemn. We don’t know who has the truth.’\n\nYou might be nodding your head in affirmation at this point. All of us have heard this before, the well meaning brother or sister that simply must tell us to be on guard against zealotry. We are reminded frequently of,\n\nYou have your religion and I have mine, but never the beginning of the surah, Say, Unbelievers! I do not worship what you worship.[3] These ‘little islams’ whether they be cults or divergent Orthodox teachers and preachers, pose the great threat to common believers today in that they espouse that Islam has no authority, no central structure that is decisively known.\n\nMuch ado is made about Islam being ‘devoid of priesthood’ and Islam being a universal brotherhood ‘without hierarchies.’ The words are true, but the intent behind them is false from many directions.\n\nWe are led to believe that as Islam has no central body, such as in the case of the Catholic Church’s Magisterium that clearly delineates doctrine, morals and other values. There is no such priesthood that would have authority over the whole Ummah in the same way the Pope does over his followers. The believer is free to follow his heart, read the Qur’an and the Sunnah for himself and be convinced by the evidences as he goes.\n\nBefore addressing the main point of this article, the writer would like to examine this way of thinking, which is also common to Protestant Christianity.\n\nWhen the Protestant Revolution occurred, this same reasoning was used to break free from the Catholic Church’s control and authority over the lives of Christians. When quizzed on how they would know truth without a central authority, Protestant officials remarked that they could read the Bible and be lead by the Holy Spirit, who would assist them.\n\nAnd as Reformed Theology grew, so did the confusion. It seems the Holy Spirit led them to change and dispute the Biblical canon, fundamentals of Christian doctrine, legalise usury, popularise divorce and also secularise society although much of this may have been inadvertent. All of this was to save Christians from the long arm of Rome. Both organisations, although idolatrous, have very clear lines of argument.\n\nWe then return to the Muslim using the same reasoning, only there is no supposed Holy Spirit to guide him. He likens any centralising authority in Orthodox Islam to that of the Roman Church and scholars to Pontiffs, Prelates and Patriarchs in the event that they are ‘blind followed.’\n\nThis reasoning is flawed from as many as three ways. The first is to compare Orthodox Islam to the idolatry of Roman Catholicism. This smacks of the underlying hatred of Islam that a fraction of people who think in this way may possess. And further to that, while it is true the Revelation is infallible, understanding them is not. And thirdly, knowing the Arabic, commentary and how to apply revelation is not a matter of guess work. This has already been made clear to those who were witnesses to the truth.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, already left us the truth when he said, “The best generation is my generation, then those who come next, then those who come next.” And this is collected by Imams al-Bukhari and Muslim and classed by them as authentic. We can see from this that there is a baseline, a foundation for understanding the faith.\n\nThere is a responsible source, a canon, a fountainhead of knowledge that we can return to in times of stress and tribulation. The importance of this cannot be underestimated and cannot be overstated. We should take an example, a case in point so that we can understand what is on the line with regarding to knowing which Islam is the true Islam.\n\nThe writer had met a Muslim brother on the West Coast of the United States and after giving the greeting, was trading pleasantries and other good speech with him. We both were of the same mind when we had expressed that preaching to the unbelievers is necessary and that we have to resist the missionary onslaught.\n\nHe mentioned how he had been making wonderful inroads in recent years with the project and the writer wanted to know how to increase his own success. The explanation could not have been more ominous. The Muslim brother, after taking a short breathe, described how he and other brothers owned a shop selling liquors and spirits exclusively. In addition to this, some were engaged in selling unbelievers crack cocaine and using their women for prostitution.\n\nIf the author were to say he was stunned at such a delivery, the word stunned would be understated. The Muslim brother had counted on an objection to his methods. Perhaps he had spoken to someone prior to the writer and had already codified his arguments with his teachers and made sure they were cogent to him.\n\n“Listen, akhi,” he began, smiling with benevolence. “Allah has told us the truth in this matter. Listen to His Speech,” the brother then quoted a serious of passages. I want the reader to just read the texts without contextualising.\n\nFight them so that Allah will punish them with your hands.[4]\n\n“Then he said,\n\nSo prepare for them what you are able to from chariots of war and steeds so that you might strike terror in the enemies of Allah and your enemy and others besides them that you do not know, but Allah knows them.[5]\n\n“And these people are nothing. They deserve whatever comes to them,” he spat as he eyed some unbelievers saunter by.\n\nThey are like cattle. On the contrary, they are more astray.[6]\n\n“Besides that, Ibn Taymiyyah has already shown us the way. Once, he saw one of the drunken Tatars and they were inching towards them. One person went to get rid of the alcohol and the Tatars, but Ibn Taymiyyah stopped them. He told him, ‘Leave them.’\n\nFrom that, we learn it is permissible to destroy the kuffar using any means necessary, whether it’s alcohol, heroin, crack, and their women can be used as well.”\n\nAt the conclusion of this impromptu lesson in the finer elements of Islamic etiquette with the unsaved, the writer attempted to engage him in the understanding of the texts and also supporting points, but was rebuffed halfway through.\n\n“Listen, akhi. I understand what you are saying, but I don’t blind follow anyone. I take what the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said and his companions and that is it. I don’t blind follow any shaikhs or anything like that. These texts are clear cut. And look at what happened with Ibn Taymiyyah! So how much more clarity do you need?”\n\nI would respectfully part ways with this brother and would hear nothing of him until I read of this Muslim brother’s death in a failed bank robbery, which he and some others had organised for the sole purpose of building a masjid, going on jihad and also sending off donations to orphans.[7]\n\nThe point of narrating this whole incident is that we can see that there is no baseline. He has quoted the texts. The writer quoted texts. Now that the texts have been quoted, how do we find who is telling the truth?\n\nWe could examine the Arabic, but this would render nothing other than the etymology of the words. We can refer to some of the commentary literature, but he could raise an objection that these were scholars and they can be right and wrong. But the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, he could never be wrong with what he told his companions. And the Book of Allah is the same.\n\nBoth people in the conversation have infallible words. Then what is the dispute? The dispute returns to this point. Who has the authority and final word in understanding, interpreting and ruling on the revelation? In the age of making Islam plural, one would say that it is based on deliberation, debate and then a set of conclusions or one solution is reached after this time. Whatever is best for the time or society then this course of action is adopted.\n\nBut if what the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said is true about the first three generations, this should be the final court of arbitration. When we both differ over a passage and we read a modern commentary, translation or rendering, our eyes should look through the corridors of time.\n\nThey should settle on the companions, then their students, such as Muhammad ibn Sirin[8] and his sister, Hafsah,[9] al-Hasan al-Basri,[10] Az-Zuhri,[11] Sufyan ath-Thawri.[12] Then there is the third age, those being Ahmad ibn Hanbal[13] at the forefront, Sufyan ibn `Uyainah[14] and others. These are the foundational people that represent what real Islam was, is and should be when looking for the truth.\n\nAnd no matter is more pressing than what we believe. It is what we believe that influences or actions, moods and results in our eternal destination. If what you believe is wrong, it won’t matter how much effort you expend if you are deceived. You are deceived and doomed and there is no escape. Allah has revealed,\n\nThose who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in the desert. The thirsty person thinks it to be water until he comes to it and finds nothing present. But he finds Allah, who will pay him his due. And Allah is swift in taking to account. [15]\n\nAnd those Muslims who are wayward, either by innovating or joining a cult, a similar threat awaits them. Allah revealed,\n\nOn the day when some faces will be brightened, then some faces darkened. Those with darkened faces, it will be said to them: Did you reject faith after you believed? So taste the punishment for what you disbelieved. Those who have brightened faces will be in the mercy of Allah forever.[16]\n\nAbu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said this is referring to the Khawarij. These are people who said the testimony of faith, discharged the five pillars. Yet they were still deserving of divine retribution.[17]\n\nYet conventional wisdom-or “hikmah,” as proponents like to call this treacherous deception-would have us believe that as long as an organisation, leader or person proclaims Islam that this is enough and they are immune from rebuke, enquiries of clarification or responsibility for propagating beliefs and actions that can be idolatry or lead people into folly.\n\nHowever, such reasoning leaves the common Muslim in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and so on wondering how to tell a true jewel from a fake. The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, advised us,\n\nThe Jews split into 71 sects, while the Christians split into 72 sects. Indeed this Ummah of mine will split into seventy three sects, all in the Fire except the Jama`ah.[18]\n\nThe common Muslims know very well the concern they should have, being acquainted with the fact that there are some 72 counterfeit diamonds amongst the believers and only one has the authentic lustre, shine and purity that Islam represents.\n\nOne need not become a scholar and linguist in order to flesh out what the Islam that was revealed so many millennia ago is to resemble. Again, one must compare by using the first three generations or perhaps to put it more tersely: we are to judge the living by the dead. Those people who came before us, they are already promised their reward and their effort. Allah has said of the companions, both emigrants and helpers,\n\nAnd there is a share of the spoils of war for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and property, seeking the Bounty from Allah and to please Him, and helping Allah and His Messenger. Indeed these are the truthful ones.\n\nAnd there is also a share for those who before them had homes and had adopted the faith, love those who emigrate to them, and have no jealousy in their hearts for that which they have been given and they give the emigrants preference over themselves even though they were in need of that. And whoever is saved from his own covetous behaviour, they are the successful ones.[19]\n\nAllah says of the generations to come,\n\nAnd those who come after them say, Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who preceded us in faith and do not put any hatred in our hearts towards those who believed. Lord! Indeed You are the Most Kind, the Most Merciful. [20]\n\nThese are the people of the Paradise without any mistake. Anything purporting to be authentic Islam must match with the previous blueprint and paradigm. We should have an absolute method for judging all organisations today and in this way our hearts should stay pure from doubt and confusion.\n\nLet us then begin to separate the gold from the lead so that the writer, the reader and all those who may hear or come to know this message, may rejoice but also take heed.\n\nBashir ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad,[21] the second successor to Ghulam Ahmad[22] and head of the Ahmadiyyah Community, calls the masses of Muslims to his organisation begun by his father,\n\n“The claim of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (upon whom be peace) is that God has raised him for the guidance and direction of mankind; that he is the Messiah foretold in the Traditions of our Holy Prophet and the Mahdi promised in his sayings; that the prophecies contained in the different religious books about the advent of a Divine Messenger in the latter days have also been fulfilled in his person.” [23]\n\nThe truth in this claim can be tested by the following criteria:\n\na) Who is the Messiah and what is his identity?\n\nWe are told by Allah the name of the Messiah when He gave the glad tidings to the mother of the Messiah, Maryam, peace be upon her,\n\nIndeed Allah gives you the glad tidings of a word from Him. His name shall be the Messiah, `Isa, the son of Maryam. [24]\n\nThis is the same Messiah, born of Hebrew stock from family of Aaronic background. Ghulam Ahmad was a Punjabi living in India and no genetic or lineal evidence has ever been brought that he was a Hebrew in stock. Further to this, this same Messiah ascended at the command of Allah,\n\n`Isa! I am gathering you to Me and I will have you ascend to Me. I will purify you from those who disbelieve. I am going to make those who follow you above those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. [25]\n\nAllah has also said,\n\nIndeed Allah raised him to Himself.[26]\n\nGhulam Ahmad has never brought any evidence that he has ascended and come back to Earth or any such thing. And how are his followers above those who do not believe? Ahmadiyyah are still a tiny group compared with the rest of the Muslims and even the rest of the population around the globe and they have never been in any position to rule.\n\nFurther, even if this point was ceded, what about before Ahmadiyyah was declared? At that point, the believers were not uppermost? So it is either the Lord who is not telling the truth or Ghulam Ahmad.\n\nTruly the Messiah shall return again, but under the same name. Allah has revealed to us,\n\nAnd he is a sign of the Hour.[27]\n\nNone in the early generations doubt this fact. Imam Abu Hanifah,[28] may Allah be pleased with him, mentioned this doctrine, “And among the signs of the Day of Resurrection is the appearance of Ya’juj and Ma’juj, the sun rising from the West and the descent of `Isa, peace be upon him, from the sky.”[29]\n\nImam Abu Ja`far at-Tahawi,[30] may Allah be pleased with him, observed, “And we believe in the signs of the Hour and from amongst them is the appearance of the False Messiah and the descent of `Isa, son of Maryam, from the sky.” [31]\n\nb) Was it the understanding of the Muslims in the first three generations that the Messiah and the Mahdi are one and the same person?\n\nThe Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, told us, “How will you be when `Isa, the son of Maryam descends amongst you whilst your Imam is amongst you?” [32]\n\nThis is also further embarrassment for the Ahmadiyyah organisation as the Mahdi is actually from the lineage of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, which means he has Arab lineage. The Messiah is a Hebrew.\n\nAlthough both Semites, these are two different branches, with noticeable differences. Once again, Ghulam Ahmad and his organisation never had and still have no evidence of him being of any lineage other than the Indo-Aryan stock that most Punjabis belong to phenotypically.\n\nc) Are there to be any other messengers or prophets?\n\nAllah, Glorified and Exalted, has already revealed,\n\nMuhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets.[33]\n\nIn closing, this would show Ghulam Ahmad to be a false prophet and his organisation to be a cult, not of the saved way of the first three generations. They may thus be discarded as a valid path.\n\nSome Muslims often meet people who claim to represent the authentic teachings of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. Although they will use titles and names such as Isma`ili, Ithna `Ashari, Akhbari, Usuli, Dawoodi Bohra or what have you, they have the same Shi`ah basis. They are all Shi`ah.\n\nLet us quote some accepted figures within the ranks of the majority of the Shi`ah. Ayatullah Muhammad Shirazi,[34] made the claim, “To be able to see God is impossible as He is not a substance, nor will he ever be seen; not in this world and not in the Hereafter.” [35]\n\nAnother well respected Shi`ah theologian, Jalal ud-Din al-Hilli,[36] gave the following unequivocal ruling, “The vision (or seeing) of God is impossible.” [37]\n\nThis flies right in the face of passages so unequivocal in this regard, such as,\n\nFaces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord. [38]\n\nImam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, said, “Indeed Allah will be seen in the Hereafter by his pious slaves, who will see Him with their very eyes.”[39]\n\nImam Abu Ja`far at-Tahawi, may Allah be pleased with him, said the following, “So seeing Allah is true for the people of the Paradise without their encompassing Him or any modality just as has been spoken of in the Book of Our Lord.” [40]\n\nImam Abul Hasan al-Ash`ari,[41] may Allah be pleased with him, gave 15 pages of evidence in favour of this crucial moment for the believers.[42]\n\nThe Salafiyyah organisation (known to style themselves as the Safe Sect, the Salafi Call, the People of Hadith, the People of Tawhid) is also a false claim to truth, doing little more than leading adherents by the hand into a cult of blind following that has its terminus in the Fire.\n\nOne of the most well respected leaders of Salafiyyah, `Abdul `Aziz ibn `Abdullah Ibn Baz,[43] made the following disturbing remark, “He is above limits that people know, but He knows his limit. So the intent of the limit is that Allah knows it and the slaves don’t know it.’ [44]\n\nThus from its’ very inception, Salafiyyah knows a god totally different from that of the early Muslims. Let us first look at what Allah has said,\n\nThere is no thing like Him. He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.[45]\n\nImam Abu Hanifah, a student of the companion Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with both of them, had this to say, “So His being affirmed is without need of a body, being a substance, matter or possessing a limit or opponent for Him.” [46]\n\nImam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, had this to say, “And we do not describe Allah with more than what He described Himself with, as He is without limit and without boundary.” [47]\n\nImam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, also said, “And Allah, Mighty and Majestic, has an `Arsh and the `Arsh has angels who bear it and Allah, Mighty and Majestic is above His `Arsh without any limit for Him. And Allah knows best its’ limit.” [48]\n\nImam Abu Ja`far at-Tahawi, may Allah be pleased with him, gave the creed of Imams Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaibani on the subject, “And whoever describes Allah with any of the ways one would describe a creature, then he has committed unbelief. So let him refrain.” [49]\n\nHe also said, “Allah is exalted from being in need of limits, boundaries, implements and limbs and the six created directions do not encompass him as they do the creations.” [50]\n\nImam Abul Hasan al-Ash`ari, may Allah be pleased with him, remarked at the beginning of his text, “He, Allah, is not in need of any form spoken of, nor any limit made for Him.” [51]\n\nThis should be enough to tell us that the god of Salafiyyah is definitely not the One that was revealed in the Qur’an. And we praise Allah who saved us from the cults and guided us aright.\n\nLet the reader beware of the evil that exists in these organisations, but let him rejoice as well in the truth of Muslim Orthodoxy that have passed this religion to us without fail. We must hold on to their way, adhere to their understanding and cling to it stubbornly under all circumstances.\n\nThis is not a time for the disingenuous and inauthentic call for the ‘unity of the Ummah.’ This is the time for knowing the truth. Didn’t the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, tell us that the cults would arise? Let us return to his words,\n\nThe Jews split into 71 sects, while the Christians split into 72 sects. Indeed this Ummah of mine will split into seventy three sects, all in the Fire except the Jama`ah.[52]\n\nGlory be to Allah! This is not the time for unity. We have not been commanded to unify with the cults. No! To be sure, we have been told to stay away from them and resist them, as Allah commanded us to do,\n\nIndeed those who divide their religion and break into sects, you are to have nothing to do with them. Their affair rests with Allah, who will inform them of what they used to do.[53]\n\nTo the Muslim leaders who have spearheaded unity with cults:\n\nBreak ties with the cults, resist them and fight them with the revelation that you have been given. Do not risk the Wrath of Allah under a false banner of unity that will only take you to the Fire for distorting the Religion of Allah.\n\nStand up and do not allow yourselves to be used as tools by Shaitan, who you presently have made your master as you have called innovation revelation and revelation innovation.\n\nYour punishment is greater than the laity if you waver. You are people of knowledge. You are the inheritors of the prophets, peace be upon them. And if you slip, you will slip hard indeed. Repent, rise and renew.\n\nTo the laymen of Muslim Orthodoxy: Some of you are confused, but this is not the time to ignore the truth of what Islam truly stands for and represents. Think carefully about your spouse, what schools you will attend, your companionship with others and how you will learn your knowledge.\n\nThe same wars in the Muslim heartlands will soon ravage you here. Do not be like those in Michigan (United States) who decided to ‘put Shi`ah and Sunni’ behind them from Iraq, Egypt and the like. These same Shi`ah and Sunnis are fighting in the street as gang members and drug dealers.\n\nYou cannot escape the fact that this situation is here. Be proud of your faith. You must hold your leadership accountable. Do it for your faith, for your children, for your elders and for Allah. You will be brought to account and will not be excused regarding the very foundation of religion. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, spoke to us in clear language when he revealed,\n\n“Let every people judge according to what their scholars have ruled upon.”[54]\n\nSo you are not only to look at the example of the scholars, but in such matters as these, you must be sure. Do not let yourselves be caught unaware. Beware and be careful.\n\nLaymen are the bulk of the Ummah and it is you who are the bedrock. Be careful what well you drink from when looking for role models. Dear common believer, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, loved you enough to warn you. He said,\n\n“Most of the hypocrites of my Ummah are its’ scholars.”[55]\n\nAnd even if we were to say this is the minor and not major form of nifaq, we still must take heed and warning. Look to the scholars and see those who are Orthodox from those who are not.\n\nExamine not just pedigree but principle. How consistent have they been in encouraging you and fighting for your needs? You deserve to be taught, warned, admonished, advised, loved and they and their students are responsible. And we ask Allah that he protect all the rightly guided scholars of fiqh, creed, ihsan, tafsir, tajwid and all sciences of this lofty religion and protect us from those who are a harm and danger. And with Allah is every success.\n\nWas-Salaam,\n\nbrother in Islam,\n\nAl-Hajj Abu Ja`far al-Hanbali\n\n[1] Surat ul-Ma’idah (5), ayah 3\n\n[2] Surah Ali `Imran (3), ayah 85\n\n[3] Surat ul-Kafirun (109), ayat 1-6\n\n[4] Surat ut-Tawbah (9), ayah 14\n\n[5] Surat ul-Anfal (8), ayah 60\n\n[6] Surat ul-Furqan (25), ayah 44\n\n[7] I could say further about a Muslim brother that I knew by the name of Ghalib who had nine wives and stated, “The evidence for this is what Allah said in His Book,” And marry two, three or four.

Attacks on Islam have been brought about by numerous factors. Some of these attacks were due to the vindictive nature of researchers, Orientalists, newspaper writers and the like.\n\nBut still other aggressive malcontents had previously given Muslims a fair shake. But upon viewing our behaviour and unwillingness to explain or defend our faith in the face of opposition, these neutral observers have come off the fence and joined the revilers of Islam.\n\nThose claiming or hand picked to ‘represent Islam’ have done little to remedy the problem, but rather have turned up the volume on the ‘Islam means peace’ propaganda machine. [i] The tune, although catchy and easy to hum by schoolchild and adult alike, has fallen out of the top twenty greatest hits for the unbelievers in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThey have seen very little of the peace that Islam is supposed to offer. Sceptics tend to see that some Muslims, while espousing peace, are at times speaking with two tongues. [ii] This anomaly does us no end of harm in attempting to present a saving faith to a lost world.\n\nThe present battle in our midst revolves around the person of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. Since his first being prophesied up until the day he died and after, he has been a constant source of study, along with the revelation that he received. [iii]\n\nThe struggle in presenting him to the world continues along with the realisation that most of the world has been given a circus mirror perception of him. At times, polemicists against Islam have made attacks so fanciful it is astonishing that someone could take them as ‘gospel truth.’ [iv]\n\nAlthough the attacks levelled against the character, essence and person of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, are a myriad, it is possible to distil them to as little as three in number which, depending on the century, vie with one another for prominence in the mind of scoffers towards Islam.\n\nThe first of these is that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was a renegade priest of the Arian[v] heresy that built Islam on this peculiar belief. [vi] The first recorded documentation for this allegation can be traced to a figure known as St. John of Damascus, [vii] who perceived the link between the heresy of Islam and Christianity as resting in the rise of Arianism.\n\nThe link came, John of Damascus posited, by his coming into contact with Arianism in Arabia and/or perhaps in a more limited form from Bahīrah the monk. After this encounter, he then began to take these doctrines, shaping and Arabising them into something palatable to the Arabs. The outcome of this was Islam. [viii]\n\nBut the problems for John of Damascus and those who support this are many in number when attempting to find evidence.\n\nWe find no definite evidence of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, having access to Arian literature before, during or after revelation.\n\nAttempting to use Bahīrah the monk as an evidence would further complicate matters for the hypothesis as we neither have material sources proving Bahīrah’s Arian pretensions nor the site where he lived being known for or familiar with such doctrines. And further to this, Bahīrah had abandoned his Christian faith and admitted its’ falsehood and was pleased to find the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, when he was a young boy with his uncle on a business trip to Syria.\n\nThis hardly sounds like the description of an Arian apologist, who would also hold strong Christian views, although major doctrinal variances would abound. Then there is the problem of finding Arian beliefs in either the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, or Bahīrah the monk. Arian beliefs would include things such as the Lord and Christ being of like substance, the Holy Spirit being a force, Christ being eternal and the creator of all things although created in time.\n\nExamination of the Qur’ān, the Sunnah and the texts of the first three generations will turn up no such beliefs. Orthodox Muslims have also never believed that the soul is extinguished at death, as Arius and his followers then and now espouse. Those who amend their statement and call the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, a Catholic cardinal or renegade also trouble themselves more than anyone else.\n\nAgain the issue of material sources for these assertions enters the conversation. Then there are foundational things necessarily unique to Catholicism that would have to be found in Islam in order for the hypothesis to transform into a fact.\n\nCatholic doctrines such as purgatory, salvation by with the sacraments of the Church, veneration of images, the Pope as logical successor the Christ and expositor of doctrine and second part of the trinity on Earth while the son is in heaven, the Lord having a triune essence while being one in description and other doctrines are not found in the Qur’ān, Sunnah or first three generations.\n\nIn the faith of Allah, salvation by faith alone-which is from the Mercy of Allah and not deeds-is why and how one enters the Paradise. The Lord is Unique and One, displaying or depicting animal or human life is blameworthy, Allah neither resembles the creation nor vice versa, there is no purgatory and no one scholar or layman is the final authority on revelation or its’ application.\n\nThose attempting to present the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, in this light damage themselves more than anyone else with the scant resources and material sources at their disposal to prove such outstanding claims.\n\nThe second theory is more direct without any pleasantries or even an attempt at being conciliatory. This theory is mainly that Satan led him astray and that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not know who the True God was from the false one.\n\nBut this brings more questions than it solves as there are numerous references in the Qur’ān to resisting Satan and the Word of Allah never being influenced by Satan. [ix]\n\nThat being said, it is also known that Satan and his allies call people to idolatry and pushes them to commit it,[x] yet we find a constant campaign against idolatry and the insistence on One True Lord and Salvation by faith alone, the building blocks of faith and the primordial covenant from the beginning of time.\n\nStill another problem with saying that Satan is the source of revelation is that the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, from all available data, never took part in any idolatry or evil in which one would hand themselves over to Satan, be it in worship, belief or deed.\n\nThere is just no source material for this at all. If such a thing did not exist, there is no way to accuse him of succumbing when he remained like this his entire life. He was known among his people for not taking part in evil things in society, be it religion or other things.\n\nStill others assert that he was neither a priest, cardinal, sincerely deceived nor a false prophet led by the devil, but simply a profligate man searching for political gains and power among his people. According to those looking at him, he wallowed in the sins and excesses of his time, devising solutions that would only insinuate him into political power and put him as head of state over his people.\n\nThis could only be done if he pursued power relentlessly. Keeping this belief in mind, there are startling realities that emerge with regards to holding such an assumption. If the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, was seeking political power, he took the long and arduous rather than the short way to do it.\n\nHe and some 500 other Muslims in Makkah for 13 years were tortured, beaten in the streets like public spectacles, crucified, raped, left for dead, burned under the heat of the sun, starved until they ate the leather from their own shoes, shunned by their families, stripped of all assets and their accounts frozen.\n\nThe solution to these maladies could have been realised when the senators of the Quraish came to him and stated that they would give him kingship, women and wealth if he desired it, but to just desist from this mission. His reply was less than unifying, “If you put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand so I would stop my mission, I wouldn’t stop unless I was victorious or killed in the process.” [xi]\n\nWhy do something like this when the offer was on hand? So he continued going through several more years of torture until he had to flee the city with the 500 or more Muslims. He was even offered a treaty in which both the Muslims and idol worshippers could worship their gods freely, one year being delegated to each religious group.\n\nAt the end, if either group was convinced of the other’s religious claims, they could always convert to their religion of choice. But again, rather than take such a worldly and profane course of action, he chose to repeat what had been given as revelation,\n\nUnbelievers! I do not worship what you worship and you will not worship what I worship. I will not worship what you are worshipping nor will you worship what I am worship. You have your religion and I have mine. [xii]\n\nHad he been seeking the pleasures of this life in the 13 years of austerity he was subjected to in Makkah, now would have been the time to come to the table for negotiations. But rather than do that, he refused on principled grounds that he was preaching an infallible faith.\n\nThis again leaves cracks in the argument for his being worldly and addicted to this life. Even arguments for his being mentally unstable, a child molester and the like are weakened due to lack of material evidence and also the blemishless record he had held in front of his own people and all others that came in contact to visit him.\n\nIn forty years of living amongst his people, had something been unfavourable or capable of lowering his status or challenging his claims to prophethood, it would have seen the light of day.\n\nBut the fact is that no such thing has happened. Much of the modern arguments surrounding the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, gush forward from a long ago depleted spring that first existed at his coming.\n\nBut what is disturbing is not that idol worshippers and unbelievers have and are continually attacking him. This is to be expected, as exercising of their job description as unbelievers includes things such as these in reality.\n\nBut what is worrying is that Muslims who are supposed to be in the field of apologetics have faltered when faced with these glaring accusations. Leaders in the English speaking countries by and large side step them, attempt to get those who publish such material banned or legally stopped from publishing.\n\nSome picket offices that publish or release these attacks, some Muslims have even resulted to pie throwing and smear campaigns, the cyberspace realm being full with junk mail petitions and sign up fees for different committees and think tanks.\n\nThen there are those who just cut to the chase and kill people, in broad daylight while out shopping with their family or in the park. In this way, other people will learn that, “Islam means peace,” but only those saying it is peace possess it.\n\nAll of these people listed above have done everything but respond to the reality of what is being stated about the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. In between burning things and killing people not involved or who could easily be refuted, the skill and know how to defeat falsehood is no longer extent, but in the absence of this skill, blind violence is used.\n\nThis is when their normal two ways of apologetics fail. Once someone has received ‘the truth,’ then they still don’t subscribe, the only option left is to use your hands or trigger finger to speak.\n\nLet us examine the methods of apologetics used by the bankrupt organisations in the United States, United Kingdom and so on, so perhaps we can understand why in the face of scrutiny some Muslims are resorting to violence.\n\nA method that is currently taking shape in circles of debate is to mythologise the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. In an attempt to preserve his status and the rank he holds in the hearts of Muslims, he has been taken and divorced from the reality of prophecy and his mission, but in a way that seemingly complements him.\n\nHe is the ‘Beloved of Allah,’ the ‘Chosen One,’ a ‘Light’ and other titles. While these titles are indeed true and he has been given them, these descriptions are being used with a purpose in mind.\n\nPeople are interested in the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, of mythology, in which we live our lives as best we can according to our own means and motives.\n\nWhether in the office, acting as a mortgage consultant at a realty agency or as a fighter pilot in the military dropping bombs on the homes of non-combatants, each one of these ‘lovers of the Prophet’ loves the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in a special way.\n\nThey do not overburden themselves with things of the outward such as prayer, pilgrimage, fasting, salvation and other subjects. [xiii]\n\nRather, they are concerned with the essence of things, the personage of the one that is ‘the Beloved.’ Thus at the time when the month of Rabi` al-Awwal comes, the pageantry of the event is in evidence on the day the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, was born.\n\nFamilies will arrive at the masjid early in the morning or the afternoon, sitting in while fattening foods of all shapes, colours and sizes are prepared so that the congregants might engorge themselves.\n\nLecture after lecture goes ahead, sometimes singing, chanting and swaying to commemorate the day. For that day, the people seem awestruck. Some sing or dedicate poetic tributes to the Beloved and sing his praises, as their time for fifteen minutes of fame and to shine in the spotlight has come.\n\nScholars, dignitaries and other elders come from across the country to be greeted like popes and vicars for this once in a year extravaganza. Upon arrival, these dignitaries scream, roar like camels, sing poetry and quatrains of various lengths, all to put ‘love of the Prophet in the hearts of the people.’\n\nUpon completion of the day’s festivities, the food is either kept in the masjid kitchen to rot or sent home with some congregants to rot in their refrigerators. And where do the participants return to?\n\nHome, to the house where upon entrance they are greeted with the ornately designed Qur’ān wrapped in white linen, [xiv] sitting high on the shelf away from the people. It beckons to ears that will not listen.\n\nThe house remains conspicuously silent from prayer, the rattling of noise and cheer being for various entertainments but the graveyard referred to as home stays dank, the souls of those creatures rotting, awaiting the same process to overtake the body.\n\nEach day while they roll in their metal coffins on the way to work, they remain woefully and tragically ignorant of the reality of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him; the commands, the prohibitions, the prophecies, the warnings, the advice that he brought lost in the mists of mythology.\n\nThe exalted status of his remains unrealised while children are sexual abused in Qur’ān classes, wives beaten at home, daughters sexually abused by their fathers, uncles and or family friends and other horrors so severe as to shed doubt on the Islam of those involved. [xv]\n\nWith all of these events taking place in front of the Qur’ān, one wonders how the life changing message can pierce the heart when the light has been covered, the truth muted and the sweetness of faith having nothing remaining but a bitter swig, to be taken every so often when the Qur’ān is taken out of exile, chanted with longing and then replaced to its’ cell, incarcerated until the next event where its’ jailer summons it.\n\nIt is many of these that have succumbed to the cults, in which using violence to defend truth in any circumstance, is the most feasible way to show one loves Islam. But in reality, they are just as filled with doubt and guilt as they were before joining the cult.\n\nBut the cult attempts to offer uniformity, certainty, discipline and clear guidelines, something that the mythologisers of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, fail to do. [xvi]\n\nJust as those who mythologise the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, into becoming the Logos, [xvii]so others as a reaction to the behaviour displayed, swing the pendulum in the other direction. This leads to the crass lowering of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, from the greatest man who ever lived, to ‘just another prophet, like all the rest.’\n\nIn the estimation of those involved, the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, becomes the quirky post man, delivering the Qur’ān to humanity’s mail box as if a delightful little sprit and quietly striding into the sunset to await death.\n\nAfter all, the Qur’ān has been revealed. The Sunnah is with us. We don’t need him, do we? One can repeatedly hear them mouth in dialogue with unbelievers, almost as if under hypnosis, “You see, all the prophets came, from the first to the last. Muhammad is just the last, that’s it. He’s the last prophet, just the same as all of them. ”\n\nWhen pressed by Christian missionaries, the Muslim apologist of this ilk will often concede that the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, ‘made mistakes,’ ‘fell short’ and even ‘committed sins,’ as after all he was a human being and so are the rest of us. We all make mistakes. [xviii]\n\nThey are aware of all of what the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, forbid, abstained from, but they know nothing of what he gave back, contributed or restored to the souls of men that for ages had been lost in the clutches of idolatry. What did this man physically look like? What was the salvation that he brought? How were hearts edified with his message? How was the divine order restored and what place did he hold in prophecy?\n\nQuestions such as these and more remain unanswered along with the questions of how to reconcile sin to a Just God, how the relationship between man and Creator is repaired, how one can be sure they are saved and numerous other matters that are neglected.\n\nThis is the Muhammad of those who preach the lawgiver prophet. This Muhammad being preached is cold, calculated, a law spewing machine, but with no substance, no context, no hope for humanity. It’s all fear, loathing, removing a limb or taking a life.\n\nAnd it is with great consternation that these people see unbelievers turn away from the faith after they have offered them a truck load of laws, political views on the Middle East and uncertainty regarding salvation, restoration of a relationship with their Creator, an opportunity to feel loved by the one who made them.\n\nThose in this dilemma are able to hold the seething militancy required for this type of apologetic for only some time. But then, they may revert to previous manners and some may be lost to false religions. Some may die violently, out of desperation. [xix]\n\nWhat other option would there be for a people who are believing in a prophet in which they suppress, explain away or remove his miracles for fear of committing idolatry by venerating a human being in any way, shape or form but to withdraw from their faith, confused and bewildered?\n\nNot long after, if still in the faith, these apologists begin to see the Prophet Muhammad as just Muhammad. He becomes no different than your uncle, cousin, green grocer or local bartender. This is an utter failure and shame.\n\nThe fact of the matter is the two methods of religious apologetics in these countries are bankrupt and without direction or a way to go forward because their apologetics were faulty from the start.\n\nWhen the method of defense wasn’t sufficient, desperation becomes the only key to ‘winning.’ Both groups even slip in their presentation of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, hiding that shining light from the people by ignoring him. [xx]\n\nBut to present the light, we need to know what it is for ourselves. Out of the two groups of callers to Islam, if they were asked to give a physical description of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, then the core of his message, how would they perform?\n\nWould they flunk on their Last Prophet 101 exam? Could they even answer the questions? This is something that needs to be foremost in our mind. When we proceed to this lost world, we need to be clear on what and who we are presenting. Who was the recipient of this revelation?\n\nHe was the Messenger of Allah,[xxi] the Prophet,[xxii] the enfolded one,[xxiii] the one wrapped up,[xxiv] the slave[xxv] and more than eighty other names. He was that very one. He was promised before the ages. He said about himself, “I am the first prophet created and the last one sent.” [xxvi]\n\nHe is more than just, ‘another prophet in the beginning of the line,’ he is the line, the beginning and the end. He is not like other prophets. He does not imitate other prophets. They are like him. They are imitating him. He is the prism while they are the rays of light coming through it. [xxvii]\n\nThis man we are referring to is not just, ‘Muhammad,’ he is ‘the Prophet Muhammad.’ His stature is such that in the revelation, Allah does not call or summon him by his full name. Compare this with the prophets Ādam, Nūh, Ibrāhīm, Lūt, Mūsā, Īsā and others whom Allah called by their first names when summoning them to his presence.\n\nIn fact, Allah has told believers not to do this and to always affix his prophetic title before his name. He, Allah, says of this,\n\nDo not summon or call the Messenger as you would call one another. [xxviii]\n\nOther prophets, we have been told by Allah that after their name we are to say, ‘peace be upon him.’ But after the name of the last prophet, the primordial one, we are told something else,\n\nIndeed Allah and His Angels send peace and blessings upon the Prophet. You who believe! Send peace and blessings upon him! [xxix]\n\nIt is due to this verse that after his name, we affix the phrase, ‘peace and blessings be upon him,’ and not, ‘peace be upon him,’ as with other prophets.\n\nWe must return to the historical Prophet, the one of history, promised to humanity. He is the one that illuminates the hearts, the explainer of revelation, the bringer of truth, the caller, the lamp, the illuminated, the Prophet, the Messenger, the Chosen One.\n\nAll of these and more are his titles that fit him. He is the Seal of the Prophets, the final brick in the structure, the ender of the chain, the primordial one. It is long over due that we present him to the world as he was and is, both illumination and man. He is not the logos, but neither is he the post man. He is both light and man, illumination and awesome human being.\n\nHe is everything a believer seeks to be when striving and seeking to obey Allah. He is the best adviser and role model when considering a business venture or important matter.\n\nThe best way to know more of him is to read the revelation given to him, examine his life as told by those who knew him and to look at how he actualised the Qur’ān, namely in his Sunnah, his conduct. Let us give him his due and believe in him, his status, his rank, but also obey him in what he left behind. Will we heed the words he brought as revelation?\n\nWhatever the Messenger gives you, then take it. And whatever he forbids you from, abstain. [xxx]\n\nMay Allah make us of those that obey this command, in deed and action, rightly moving forward and presenting the Word of Allah along with the recipient of that truth.\n\nWas-Salaam,\n\nAl-Hajj Abū Ja`far al-Hanbalī\n\n[i] Such chanting and sloganeering has done little good to answer some of the more piecing questions that unbelievers have asked with regards to faith. These questions as of yet remain unanswered and are still met with reflected questions or hyperbole designed to shift the topic of the conversation to the foreign policy of English speaking countries rather than answering some valid concerns that are held by people in the US and the UK.\n\nThis is no more obvious than on live interviews in which ‘moderate-Muslim spokesman’ are put on the spot.\n\nThe writer remembers an interview in which it was asked to the spokesman why some Muslims, scholar and layman alike, have called for armed revolt against the Americans in Iraq while during Saddam’s reign (in which we are still finding mass graves that have yet to be equalled by the American forces in over all ferocity) such calls were by and large silent. The question was further asked why Muslims have yet to have satisfactorily dealt with violent forces amongst their own ranks.\n\nRather than answer the question directly, the queried began going into long winded response on the evil of the war, the atrocities of the Americans, foreign policy being a direct contributor to terrorism and any and everything else that was not germane to the question.\n\nThese little vignettes consistently lead some unbelievers to hold the position that Muslims (or at least those claiming to speak on their behalf) have something to hide regarding these seeming contradictions or perhaps have no answers.\n\n[ii] One of these ambassadors was caught red handed by famous Jewish polemicist Melanie Philips. She presented him with speeches he had made in Arabic, calling Jews donkeys, swine, sons of pigs and other racist terms (none of which had any basis in revelation) while drawing attention to the fact that in English he seemed very conciliatory.\n\nThe ambassador, caught in his contradiction, resorted to the only refuge he had, that the one in question was ‘Islamaphobic’ and that this was part of the conspiracy to denigrate Islam. This is just one example of many where supposedly ‘level headed voices’ have had lectures brought to light showing them as anything but what they espouse to be on the world stage.\n\nThey would have us believe that lying squarely in the face of unbelievers in this manner is ‘hikmah (wisdom),’ but it is clear deception. Although unsaved, those who do not believe are not without intelligence. And they will come to judge us by what fruits we reveal to them.\n\n[iii] In fact, one may read an excerpt in the Encyclopaedia Americana, p. 494, under the letter ‘K’ about the revelation that he received,\n\n‘There is probably no other book in history, including the Bible, that has been so much studied and commented upon’\n\nThis studying over the revelation has of course triggered study of its’ recipient. Figures such as St. John of Damascus, RVC Bodley, W.J. Thackston, Alfred Guillaume, Sir William Muir, Joseph Schact, Bishop Kenneth Craig, Rev Coplestone, John Hagee, Dr. Walter Martin and scores of others have been compelled to mention something about this most important of historical figures in their writings or speeches passed down to us for posterity.\n\nAlthough much of it might have been negative, the fact that they felt duty bound to make reference to this greatest of human beings shows a concern and interest in him as a subject.\n\n[iv] One could refer to Pensées by Blaise Pascal (1623-1662 AD) or a collection of the speeches of Martin Luther (1483-1546 AD), known as What Luther Says. The ignorance of Islam displayed within the books of the two authors aforementioned is palpably absurd, considering these two historical figures are touted to be the most reformative and egalitarian voices of Christian Western thinking.\n\nThis woeful ignorance is especially shameful in the case of Martin Luther, who was exposed to Muslims for extended periods of time when he left Germany on evangelism missions to other countries, including Spain, where he was given an audience by then Holy Roman Emperor and Catholic Monarch, Charles V.\n\nAt that time, numerous theological inquests between Muslims and Christians were still taking place in the Iberian Peninsula as well as in Western Europe, so one wonders how being men of such stature-especially Luther-they could show themselves to be so obtuse regarding essentials of Islamic faith.\n\n[v] 256-336 AD. Born in Libya of Berber parents, he was a leading Christian theologian who held the position that the son was not eternally God, subject to the will of the father and not of the same substance.\n\nIn addition, he posited that the Holy Spirit was the interface of revelation between God, the Son and man. Thus it was not strictly a person, but more accurately described-according to Arius-as the power of the Lord. The argument, although well put by Arius, was branded heresy by Athanasius and was later ratified as such at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD.\n\nThe Council, which was supposed to have a solidifying effect on the Christian doctrine and to isolate Arius, only achieved these objectives in part.\n\nAlthough now marked as a dangerous heretic, the persuasive force of his arguments and the seeming inability of opposing Christian theologians to satisfactorily rout him in debate, his status was increased to that of a celebrity and Arianism did indeed spread to reach such people as the Visigoths, Ostrogoths as well as others, even after his death which Athanasians declared a miracle while supporters of Arius asserted foul play at hand.\n\nThe doctrine continues to be held, albeit in a limited form by Jehovah’s Witnesses, the NOI as well as the Christadelphians.\n\n[vi] Those who are Greek, Syrian or Russian Orthodox and Coptic members have in recent centuries amended their charge to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, being a renegade Catholic priest or cardinal. To the writers knowledge, this position is still hold by most Greek Orthodox theologians, including the head of the Greek Orthodox in England and their representatives, who the author has met and had the opportunity to try to preach the faith. Much of their insistence on his being a renegade Catholic has to do with the deep animosity and wide gulf that permeates till this day the relationship between Catholics and the Orthodox and Coptic Churches.\n\n[vii] 676-749 AD. Considered by Christians of all orientations to be a defender of the faith, John of Damascus or in Latin Johannes Damascenus Chrysorrhoas, John of Damascus, the Golden Speaker, was born in Damascus a generation after the Muslims under Ummayad rule had secured Syria under their authority.\n\nHis father was a Christian scholar and tax collector under the governance of the ruler of Syria and educated his son with the best Christian education possible after the Melkite rite of Christianity. John of Damascus was known for his piety and his unflinching defense of his religion, even debating with Muslim theologians, many of the remnants of these dialogues being written down in his works.\n\nHe died in his monastery a few miles from the city of Jerusalem, where he had made his home in his final years. Most of his works are now extent in the English language for those who desire to read how Christians in the early ages dealt with encounters with Muslim laity and their elite.\n\n[viii] A vocal few of the Muslim preachers in the United States and United Kingdom have not helped in the last two decades by their claiming that Arius was a ‘pre-Muhammad Muslim’ and that this was the reason for the Christian persecution of Arianism. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe writer has repeatedly attempted to warn these ‘reformers’ and ‘renewers’ of Islam to verify such claims before charging into the battlefield with Satan and his army but by and large these suggestions have fallen upon deaf ears. Upon crowning Arius and his ideas as proto-Islamic, Christian accusations of heresy and Islam being a slavish copy work of Christianity and Judaism were more easily founded, as Muslims did their work for them.\n\nThe oversight of these Orthodox Muslims (in their well meaning zeal) not doing sufficient research into the issue at hand caused them to be lumped in with groups such as the Mormons (LDS Church), Jehovah’s Witnesses, NOI and the Christadelphians as just another poor Xerox copy of Christianity.\n\nThose claiming Arius and his teachings to be compatible with Islam have also themselves fallen into theological problems, or at least shown their ignorance of the faith of Islam, Arius, his ideas or all three.\n\nArius claiming that there was one god is not sufficient proof to crown him a Muslim and to pray for him as some Muslims have, for the Egyptians who worshipped Aton also believed him to be ONE. The Hindus who worship Brahma believe him to be ONE.\n\nThe Sikhs believe their deity to be ONE. The mere statement that one believes their god is one does not then infer that it is the One True Lord over all. If one is worshipping ONE god, what if it is the wrong ONE and you are lost and without a relationship with the true ONE who spoke at Mt. Sinai and down through the ages to 124,000 prophets? The consequence is clear.\n\nAnd what is more, the fact of Allah being ONE was not all Arius said. He also stated that he believed that although Jesus Christ was created at one point in time, he was and is still the creator of all the worlds before time and before being begotten.\n\nArius also maintained that there was no trinity, but actually a monarch. At the top of the monarchy was God the Father, below him was the Son and then the active mover of revelation was the Holy Spirit. Thus although rejecting the trinity, he asserted monarchism in faith, in addition to affirming that although God the Father and the Son were not of the same substance, they were of like substance.\n\nA careful read of these and other statements will prove that from the standpoint of a Muslim, Arius and his counterparts are just as idolatrous as other Christians, although more intellectually defended and explained. And it is due to our ignorance of these and other works that we have been led to believe by some Muslim apologists that Christadelphians and Jehovah’s Witnesses are closer to faith when they are just as much in the wilderness of idolatry as the rest of their companions in the world. Fortunately, Arius’s works and research on them have been translated into many languages and can be accessed by any student to verify the claims made by the writer.\n\n[ix] Please see sūrahs al-Isrā (17), āyah 88;al-Hajj (22), āyah 52; Takwīr (81), āyah 25\n\n[x] cf. Sūrahs Al-An`ām (6), āyah 112; Saba (34), āyāt 40-41; Al-Jinn (72), āyāt 1-5; Maryam (19), āyāt 44-45; Al-Hajj (22), āyāt 3-4; Yā Sīn (36), āyāt 60-62; Ibrāhīm (14), āyah 22\n\n[xi] Sirah Ibn Hishām, V. 1, pp. 260-266\n\n[xii] Sūrat ul-Kāfirūn (109), āyāt 1-6\n\n[xiii] ‘We may be non-practicing, but you can’t judge us,’ they rage at the common Muslim when he or she attempts to call them to righteousness and a relationship with Allah.\n\n[xiv] Perhaps most disturbing is the striking similarity between the burial shroud that Muslims are buried in and the clean white linen many Muslims wrap the Qur’an in when placing it on the shelf. What does this say about how we feel about the Speech of Allah?\n\n[xv] The things that the writer mentions are eye witness accounts that he has dealt with in the capacity of counselling or while preaching to Muslims who have become Christians and cite these as part of their impetus for leaving the faith. Statistics by independent and verifiable sources are available in libraries and other places for those who might consider a thorough research of the subject at hand.\n\n[xvi] The writer has found that the vision that the mythologisers and their family have of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, is already severely out of proportion, to the point where he becomes the Logos. At times, segments of their ranks become offended when someone refers to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, as a human being.\n\nThis has been witnessed by the writer and other eye witnesses along with the fact that when someone seems to offer some sort of substance to what is being given, children of these individuals jump at the chance. And it is with this that some of the most cold blooded killers from our ranks, from the Dar ul-Islam movement all the way to the July 7, 2005 bombers have had some that came from this background.\n\nThey searched for some truth outside of the King Arthur legends surrounding the greatest man who ever lived and stepped forward into falsehood. Rather than foreign policy faux pas, it has been the Muslim domestic family policy that has produced some of the worst theological sociopaths the world has seen in this decade.\n\n[xvii] The Logos in Christian theology refers to the doctrine that the pre-incarnate Christ before being on Earth was the Word of God literally, “god from god, light from light, true god from true god,” as the Creeds of Christendom run. It is he whom the Christians ask for forgiveness of sins, rain, food, salvation and the like.\n\nThe reason why the author mentions this is that some Muslims come dangerously close to this when mythologising the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. The language and imagery begin to sound similar to a point where when one reads the Athanasian Creed and listens to such speech, care has to be taken to differentiate.\n\nThe writer is in no way saying that those involved are no longer believers and unbelievers, but rather that what they have done is blameworthy and does nothing for the rank of the Last Prophet.\n\n[xviii] It may be they did not realise, but they walked right into the plan of the People of the Book, which is to impute sin to prophets. The Christians especially would readily agree with such sentiment as they believe that Jesus is God and not a prophet, thus all fall short of the glory of god. ‘So if Muhammad made mistakes,’ they query, ‘how can you depend on him when you’re in just as much error?’\n\n[xix] It may be of note that Wafa Idris, a female suicide bomber, was described by her brother on the BBC in an interview after the events as ‘not being very religious, never being known to be religious.\n\nShe did her job and came home.’ He went on to describe that she never showed any signs of religiosity, not even prayer, even up until her death. She was often depressed and spent time in isolation. It is cases like these where we want to take people who dread and fear Allah and also give them hope in Him as well.\n\n[xx] This is particular disturbing as his name is actually in the Testimony of Faith, the statement being, “There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.” In many instances one can witness people talking to people about Allah and His Magnitude and greatness, as well as the prophets, peace be upon them, how they have come in a chain one after the other down through the ages.\n\nThey usually end their presentation with, “So you see, Muhammad is no different than them, he is just the last one, that’s all.” It is this jaded and terribly untrue statement that leads many astray. If he was the same or of equal value as the rest of the prophets, there would be no point in him being created first, sent last and his being given gifts that other prophets never possessed.\n\nPrimarily, this type of speech is connected with an attitude of desiring to avoid revealing the rank of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, to the people.\n\nSome are afraid of the questions it will bring while others may not be sure who it is they are presenting in explaining the faith. Should it not be strange to any bystander that they preach belief in a Book and a Lord that was preached by a certain man and then say little or nothing of that man?\n\nAll of this rests on the singular and pivotal influence of one man, yet we so capriciously hide him and conceal his identify. Why? Are we ashamed of him by hiding him in the mists of mythology? Could it be that those claiming the most zeal and love for him really don’t know him at all, but just about him?\n\n[xxi] Sūrat ul-A`raf (7), āyāt 157-158\n\n[xxii] Sūrat ul-Ahzab (33), āyah 59\n\n[xxiii] Sūrat ul-Muzzammil (73), āyah 1\n\n[xxiv] Sūrat ul-Muddath-thir (74), āyah 1\n\n[xxv] Sūrat un-Najm (53), āyah 10\n\n[xxvi] Collected by Imam at-Tirmidhi in his Sunan and classified as sahih. This statement was actually made in conjunction with Sūrahs Ali Imran (3), āyah 81, Sūrat ul-Ahzab (33), āyah 7 where two of the five prophets mentioned were in chronological order but he was referred to before them.\n\nWhen asked why this was the case, he replied with the statement quoted previously. Although the last prophet, he was created first, prophesied and looked forward to from the beginning of the ages down until the very day that he appeared.\n\n[xxvii] It is at this point that someone may start to believe that the writer, by stating the level of the Messengerof Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, is actually denigrating other prophets, due to the Words of Allah, “We make no distinction between any one of the messengers.” Sūrat ul-Baqarah (2), āyah 285.\n\nHowever the writer is not denigrating any of the other prophets, but stating the fact that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, is greater than the other prophets, the first of them and the last sent. As far as the āyah mentioned above and others like it, if read in context the reader will find that the text is in reference to acceptance of all the prophets and messengers, without denying one and then accepting others.\n\nAs far as preferring some over others, the Lord Himself stated that some are preferred or better than others when he said, Of the Messengers, some We preferred over others. Some of them Allah spoke to directly while some of them He raised in degrees. Sūrat ul-Baqarah (2), āyah 254. When reading the context of this passage, one can see that Allah has made some Messengers greater than others. We accept this without denying or denigrating the others.\n\n[xxix] Sūrat ul-Ahzab (33), āyah 56\n\n[xxx] Surat ul-Hashr (59), ayah 7.\n\nSafar 1427\n\nIt has been for the past one hundred years that Orthodox Muslims have been under continuous theological bombardment without a civilisation (thus the bombardment was not only military in nature. Years before any such military conquest was possible, there had to first be a weakness in the preaching and understanding of the Orthodox faith).\n\nOne of the harmful aspects in our failure to address a society that is at war with itself and in the clutches of darkness has been a heightened reactionary element.[1] Those who do care for Islam obviously want to defend it and the truth that is therein, but in lacking the tools, evidences and/or ability to defend it have resorted to violent means to defend Islam.\n\nIn defence of the faith in the face of intellectual opposition from external enemies,[2] those that have used violence as a means of apologetics have actually given Christian missionaries and academics ample fuel for their arguments and suppositions that Islam can only be defended by the sword when its’ foundations and sources are called into question.\n\nThese critics of Islam have also went further to say that there is no defence of Islam that is cogent as Islam stands on nothing but military conquests and past achievements that have been negligible at best.\n\nWhen some Muslims in the United Kingdom, United States and France, estranged from the principles of salvation and a direct relationship with Allah, have weighed the evidence from these polemics along with the Islam that is on display in the spiritually dilapidated Islamic centres and masjids throughout these countries, there can be little wonder why a contingent of them would opt out of Islam either as a way of action or as a way of faith altogether.\n\nThe first category, who have left Islam in terms of action, can be spotted throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. They are the spiritual orphans long neglected. They attempt to learn Islam at their own pace, but not without great frustration and feelings of alienation from a wider community that is sometimes racially or culturally different to them. The second category have found other options to gain meaning in life.\n\nThis group of people are actually of two types. As a growing number of individuals from Muslim families delve into scientific fields, those who are indeterminate in their faith have sought science and the data obtained from inquiry as a way of answering fundamental questions about life and the nature of it.\n\nThey have been content to believe that life in many instances does not have a meaning that is connected to the worship of Allah, being in a relationship with Him or having salvation. But rather, the mechanics of life as viewed under the microscope or in the laboratories of their choice are a series of functions and attitudes.\n\nThose functions end in death, which equally does not bear any full meaning for the confused member of a family that may have been culturally Muslim. Thus their attitudes are shaped by ‘empirical findings,’ whether this has to do with decisions they make in relationships, day-to-day activities or other matters.\n\nStill others choose to search and upon finding nothing but a husk of Islam and dry rituals, turn to something that they find to be more substantial, which gives them a sense of belonging and truth.\n\nIt is for this reason that some Muslims, never tasting the word of truth or the joy that emanates from it, have chosen to try to find meaning in Christianity and other counterfeit forms of Islam. This has been the case with some 200,000 Muslims throughout the United Kingdom [3] as well as countless others in the Muslim world.\n\nThe writer was once met by three Jehovah’s Witnesses women in his home as they attempted to subject him to a Bible study. One of the women stood out, her Asian looks and shalwar kameez outfit with scarf being unmistakable. At first glance, this girl appeared as if she would be from Karachi, Islamabad or maybe some Muslim hamlet on the East Coast of the United States or in Yorkshire, England.\n\nBut her accent advertised her being raised in England. When asked why she had left Islam and become an ardent Jehovah’s Witness, her response was that she had never been taught anything or mentored by anyone in the community.\n\nWhen someone came to her and showed her what she believed to be love, compassion and a sense of belonging, she took it. This was in addition to her actually having her questions answered, something that was seldom done from her days at ‘the mosque with the local moulvi.’\n\nShe also was able to learn about the tenets of her religion in a systematic and comfortable way. Some Muslims in that situation, as a knee jerk reaction, when in the absence of the tools of Orthodoxy, would have replied angrily with shouts of, ‘You kāfir! Filthy whore! You should be killed. Get out of my house now!’[4]\n\nBut the writer sought further clarification and began to take notes on her situation. Once the note taking was complete, the writer attempted to deliver the Orthodox faith. He would have like to have said that the woman changed her mind and returned to faith, but in many instances the dye is cast and those lost choose to stay as they are, lost.\n\nBut the case, rather than being surprising, was more sobering. She, as to her own admission, was one of a growing number of those coming from families that were culturally Muslim but spiritually dead. Unsaved and out of ideas, they reached out for anything and took hold of whatever seemed to be a life saving faith.\n\nBut let us understand clearly when the companion Jābir ibn `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, came weeping one day. Other Muslims were shocked and asked him regarding his affair. He informed them thusly, “The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ‘People will come into Islam in great crowds and leave it in great crowds.’ ” [5]\n\nAlthough this prophecy is referring mainly to the great apostasy that occurred after the death of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, we can still understand the import of the statement, that being that the loss of believers to the Devil’s camp is something that should sadden us. In addition to this, we must also do as the earlier generations and take responsible action.\n\nInternal problems\n\nThe explosion of the cults on our doorstep has also brought a new challenge to those attempting to follow the Orthodox faith. Aware of the US, UK and other countries and the fact that a sizable number of Muslims have not been exposed to the cults that were present in the Muslims lands, these organisations have sought to take advantage of this situation and bring in a new age of counterfeit revival, preaching a deeds based salvation and a universalist theology that has found attraction among Muslims who find themselves in a society that espouses universal values.\n\nIt can be evidenced that if one takes one cult, the Salafīyyah, as evidence of the rising phenomenon, the end result is alarming. This tiny organisation, only in the millions in contrast to the 1.5 billion Orthodox believers, prints more periodicals and journals in one month than all of the Orthodox organisations in a year. One may very well cite their petrol wealth and control of Saudi Arabia’s economy as a reason for this flourishing wealth.\n\nBut this over simplistic explanation is not all. If indeed this was to be the only reason for their success, what of the Shī`a? They are some 165 million, who have an oil giant as an ally in Iran. They are not growing at the same meteoric rate, although they have resources of the same calibre.\n\nThe fact is that the Salafī movement, as well as other cults to a lesser extent, take their mission seriously and act on it. This is something that Orthodox institutions have failed to do as of yet in the United States, United Kingdom and other countries with Muslim communities in the minority. But cults are able to now, more than ever, take advantage of the ignorance of some Orthodox Muslims with regard to faith.\n\nOur lack of knowledge of our faith and the ‘why’ and ‘evidence’ or our understanding has made some of us a stationary target for the Devil and his agents of darkness. One example came recently when a believer explained to me that he had read all of Muhammad ibn `Abdul Wahhāb’s books and didn’t find anything objectionable to creed within them.\n\nI had asked him if he had read the books in his native language, to which he replied in the affirmative. I then asked if he had read them all the way through, to which he again replied in the affirmative. I finally asked him if he had cross referenced all of the verses as well as checking the Orthodox understanding of these texts, to which he replied in the negative.\n\nThis is a standard problem, one which anyone attempting to preach the Orthodox faith will find. The question of terminology is always at fault. Cults will adapt the same terminology as the Orthodox but pour vastly differing meanings into the same words.\n\nThis then requires a definition of terms. Similar incidents have occurred when some unknowing Orthodox Muslims have delved into materials by the Ahmadīyyah, Shī`a or Submitter cults. They as well would claim that everything ‘seemed to be just fine.’\n\nBut the problems were there, although they had no idea how to look for them. When someone should read works by the cults and still find them palatable (or Orthodox for that matter), there are three possibilities,\n\na. The person presenting the cult literature has no grounding in his subject.\n\nb. The person reading the cult literature or dialoguing with a cult has no grounding in the subject.\n\nc. Neither the cultist nor the unwitting Orthodox believer has any grounding in the subject at hand.\n\nThe confusion over terminology usually falls into one of these three issues. Thus the use of words such as Allah, Qur’ān, Salvation, Tawhīd and the like have classical meanings in one sense and another sense that cults may pour into them. This must be understood by anyone seeking to do cult outreach or anyone even desiring to know what they believe and why they believe it.\n\nSomeone not knowing the reason why they believe something in revelation is open to the mind bending mental traps of those who would seek to recruit them to an organisation claiming to represent pure faith.[6]\n\nUniversalist approach by supposedly Orthodox institutions\n\nIt cannot be ignored that the great bulk of institutions in the countries where Muslims reside as a minority, have also involved themselves in the ways of the world, courting earthly rulers and involving themselves in the impurity of religious relativism.\n\nOne can witness masjids, ‘Islamic’ centres, ‘Muslim’ prayers halls being used as recruiting grounds for political parties,[7] staging grounds for inter-faith dialogue[8] (which poisons the minds of our children) as well as banks for the collection of money for the organisation leader and his family. [9] In the shadow of all of this, the following things have taken root,\n\na. Earthly governments have become involved in Islamic institutions and used them as mouthpieces to justify political activities either throughout the world or on a local level.\n\nb. The message of salvation has not been preached to the wider community. [10] It is for this reason that many of these institutions find rocks thrown through their windows and such hostility from wider indigenous communities, whose only exposure to Islam has been the length of the robes or the largeness of the hats of those dashing into these buildings.\n\nThere have been no open house contacts, wider programmes to bring about inclusion and preach the faith or even to explain their long term methodology.\n\nc. The buildings supposedly representing Islam have been left as nothing but fossils, representing little but cultural vestiges of a failed age long gone. They have been built without a community to fill them or families to frequent them. [11] This is actually backwards to the way of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, who didn’t build his first masjid with his bare hands until some 13 years later.\n\nPrior to then, he had been engaged in teaching the adults and perfecting them (at Dar ul-Arqam, a mostly adult centred institution in Makkah). [12] For if adults are educated, the children will be educated, then the existence of a community becomes reality.\n\nWhat has occurred instead in countries where Muslims are the minority is the opposite. Masjids, centres and even ramshackle schools have been built, without adult education being given priority.[13] A body has been constructed with no skeleton, the collapse then being imminent and sudden. Only Allah knows when exactly this collapse will come, but it is indeed imminent.\n\nd. The result of the above three has rendered Islam a persona non-grata amongst the society. It can then confidently be put forward that Orthodox Islam has yet to have been proclaimed in the English speaking countries, much less expressed.\n\nThis glaring reality has not been faced, as more and more, daily masjid attendance dwindles and Friday becomes the ‘Muslim Sabbath,’ hawkers telling congregants to plunk their change in the collection box that is collected before the Imām delivers the final lecture preceding the prayer. These actions and ceremonies now disturbingly resemble in some way the Eucharist of the Christian church in some aspects. [14]\n\ne. And the fifth result has been these organisations speaking with the tongue of apostasy. [15] Although composed of some Orthodox attendees and maybe funded with the money of Orthodox Muslims, these same institutions have flouted the noble intentions that many of them have been built for and have become lobby groups.\n\nThese tentacled, multi-faceted corporations have become the ‘ears, eyes and heart’ of the Ummah, the ‘authentic representatives for the Muslims’ as well as taking on other blameworthy titles. Yet these same organisations operate in the same way as the despots that many immigrant Muslims have sought escape from in these countries where they now reside as a minority.\n\nThe ‘representatives’ of the Muslims have set themselves up without consulting the rest of the Muslim community, taken decisions, made programmes, enacted constitutions and preached and taught in areas where they were completely unqualified while at the same time espousing that they represent Islam.\n\nIn rapid response, the Devil has held them up and used them through smoke and mirror tactics in the media, again obscuring Orthodox Islam, reducing it yet again to something of a ‘personal faith’ or a ‘nice religion’ without the dynamism and active participation that it is known for in revelation.\n\nFor a surety they are guilty of the same heavy handed tactics as the despots they denounce for human rights violations.\n\nThey as well label authentic and reasoned opposition to their oligarchy of power extremism and their proponents extremists while moulding themselves as ‘moderate, pragmatic and enlightened.’\n\nThe need for action could have never been greater. In giving all of this news that seems negative, we are faced with the prospect of now searching for solutions.\n\nThe need for Orthodox values\n\nThe solutions that exist are fortunately not complex, but will require great sacrifice due to the neglect of over one hundred years that has been allowed to take root at the time of and since the collapse of Islam as a civilisation.\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough the need to know what we believe, but also why we believe it. No longer is it sufficient to give a facile dismissal to other religions, such as Christianity, by merely a curt, ‘Well, they’re kuffar,’ without knowing why and how.\n\nThe subjects that have been neglected when preaching the faith during these tumultuous times have been Salvation and its’ meaning, spiritual enrichment or personal devotion (Ihsān) and prophecy and its’ place in revelation (this comes from the lack of knowledge of cross referencing).\n\nThis ignorance has led to our own downfall in countless lectures, presentations and even debates when Christian missionaries were actually more knowledgeable about certain tenets of Islam than the ‘Islamic expert’ chosen out of medley of other ‘spokesmen’ for the Muslims.\n\nThe emphasis must be taken off of children’s schools with a broader outline being laid out for young parents in particular and adults as a whole. If an adult has no time to learn about the revelation and the basic tenets of faith, why should there be any time to teach their children?\n\nSome have thought that, ‘Well, my children will teach me whatever they know,’ but the majority of the time, this simply does not happen. To be successful in life, children need to be imparted knowledge and then see practical application of it.\n\nIf the house is dead, but at their ‘Islamic school,’ the faith is alive, you have zombies, plain and simple. And it is when they reach their adolescent years that they become confused about being told and pulverised at school with gun boat Islam and then living as if they are unsaved while at home. Adult education must be the priority for us, while lifting the gas pedal from the rush for building the medley of poorly run children’s schools for Muslims. [16]\n\nWhen learning the faith, one will understand what their obligation is and the children will likewise be able to see that example in the home and follow likewise, even if the lessons are small but frequent. It is best to have small snacks than overpowering meals that leave you sickened. The same holds true for teaching and preaching the faith.\n\nBefore any Muslim chooses a career or interest in higher education, he or she should already know the basics of his/her faith in terms of creed, everyday practical matters and growth in the area of personal devotion. If this is lacking, there needn’t be anything else, for such a person is already dead, but is unaware of it.\n\nThere has to be a realisation by sincere Islamic organisations upholding the flag of Orthodoxy that more books have to be printed regarding the faith of the believer. Islam is indeed more than wudu, salah, jinn and demons. Islam is far more vast and materials must be varied, not cut and pasted. Original and thoughtful delivering of the message must return.\n\nThere are also many confrontational publishing houses of the Muslims that will not print materials that need to be extant, fearing either reprisals or the loss of their coveted position. Orthodox Muslims and whatever organisations to stand in this generation must sidestep them and build up their own resources, even if with great financial difficulty.\n\nTherefore, when Orthodox Muslims control their own printing, they can relay what needs to be said, without sugar-coating or diluting truth (this is one of the objectives of HTS Publications in trying to bring you these types of works translated and we ask that you pray for our success).\n\nIn printing independent translated works, you put in the hands of the common believer the knowledge that is imperative for them from the first three generations. Sincere organisations must avoid begging for money, common Muslims have been robbed enough by organisations ravaging their pockets.\n\nIf you or any other organisation is sincere, get working and Allah will send people to support you and you will be sustained in your affair. There is no need to pan handle the Muslim community as can be witnessed in so many masjids.\n\nAt times, one can scarcely tell the difference between the drunk on the corner holding out his hand and the masjid staff, jutting out their hands as well in the same vein, complete with quoting of verses to endorse guilt trips. If any organisation does work that is sincere and the common believers can see you are doing so, they will help you. The writer has witnessed this time and time again.\n\nThe cults cannot be ignored and seminars and presentations must be held on that topic to alert people of the eternal danger of following them. These should be professional, without ranting or ad hominem attacks, but discussing the organisation in question and its’ departure from Orthodoxy. These points should especially be stressed for young adults, who may be considering marriage with a member with a cult. A return to the values of discernment is imperative.\n\nThe writer and other concerned believers have been observing the ‘masjid phenomenon’ in English speaking countries for some time and have realised the situation, after having being told so many times about the reality of it. In the absence of community, the masjids are breeding grounds for the old guard, making renewal far more difficult when having to address myriads of committees, trustees and deputies.\n\nThe feasible options to bring about general grass roots revival is to side step these organisations and teach from a non-masjid (community centre) or hall or home environment. Classes done in houses with believers encircling one another in love cannot be banned, mediated or even given unapproving glances by masjid staff, who is concerned with overhead.\n\nReturning to the way of the first three generations in a Dar al-Arqam stage may be useful as we learn to organise and become more flexible. When you do exceed a certain number and you are ready to build a community, you always have the ability to build a masjid. But until then, you begin with a Dar ul-Arqam and move from there.\n\nNever mind slogans and fancy names for what you are doing, in fact it doesn’t always require a name if you know your objective and that Orthodoxy is the way of practice. Your job will be clear and the objectives reachable if divided into short and long term goals. Every time a set of short term goals are reached, this will complete one long term goal.\n\nBe not estranged from your mission by the criticism and taunts of some common believers who may not understand the full picture of what you are doing. They are the ones you are trying to reach, but they are confused. You must understand this and be loving with them in spite of their discouraging statements.\n\nWomen must be involved, which will mean that any gathering of believers must contain a contingent of women that can raise their hands and voice their concerns clearly. A greater emphasis must be put on their education more than the men with regard to adult teaching. [17] They have been the worst affected by the collapse of Islam as a civilisation.\n\nAnd it tends to be our sisters who are wooed into the cults more quickly, due to the social construct of the organisations and our pitiable state. More of them are more committed in their faith than men by far in most English speaking countries. [18] Our sisters must know that some men are not prepared for them to lead organisations or preaching work and some men stand in their way.\n\nAgain, I advise them sincerely to sidestep these organisations and to form their own without any worry and continue the mission. Now is not the time to worry about criticism from men whose minds are not grounded in the first three generations but in feudal Europe.\n\nSisters have to be selective who they marry and far more probing in their questions regarding the creed, madhhab and understanding of the spiritual devotion of a spouse. If it seems too good to be true, it probably indeed is that way.\n\nMuslims as a whole must avoid sitting on platforms with cults or false religions, as we have been commanded to preach the faith and not dilute it. [19] This must be done singly or in pairs as we have already been commanded. Our job is to present and preach the faith, not compromise it. The Lord told us about this matter,\n\nSo do not obey the rejecters. They would you to compromise so that they might compromise as well. [20]\n\nPreach the faith and be frank, no matter the consequence. This is what is required of you while compromise is your murderer. A world in the grip of the Devil wants you to compromise, to become settled into a routine of worthless sloganeering.[21]\n\nYou have to realise this deception from your enemy and stand above it. Indeed, Islam is a personal faith, but it has public consequences on the Day of the Resurrection if you reject it and consequently salvation.\n\nThese indeed are not all of the solutions, but are the main headings. All other solutions could loosely be filed under these and discussed at length. But what must happen now is that we must,\n\na. Learn and know our faith, not in a cursory way.\n\nb. Preach the faith, boldly and without shame, working hard to present salvation to a world that is lost. Never mind the ‘da`awa stall.’ Rent out a city block or area in your downtown or city centre every summer or season, get some audio equipment with microphone jacks and give out free food while presenting the faith with question and answer.\n\nc. Oppose cults and resist them, as it is resisting the Devil. Use the revelation and admonish them with it, seeking to help them from darkness to light. This will sometimes involve you publicly warning against their organisations, events, books and even scholars. Youth seminars should be a constant preserve and a library of books to deal with these matters is essential.\n\nd. Get involved with the grassroots. Wherever you are teaching and what you are teaching should be open to the unsaved and unreached, so that they might come and ask questions and have them answered.\n\nYou need to understand people need salvation and know how to explain it without sounding like a public service announcement or some ghastly Islamic debate tape. Engage people honestly and with sincerity. Don’t talk to them unless you can do so with sincerity and listen to their queries.\n\ne. Getting involved with the grassroots means you must have something to offer to the vulnerable. Choose a colleague at work or a school chum and begin to present the truth to them, walking with them slowly on the road to salvation. Don’t waste their time with pamphlets and debates, give them the Qur’an outright and let them ask their questions.\n\nf. Hold events in your local area that invite the unsaved, in which you offer food and light ref"
