        "text": "I remember my first job interviews. I ‚Äúwinged it‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt prepare. I don‚Äôt think I was lazy ‚Ä¶. I just didn‚Äôt know where to start. Yesterday Tiffany Edwards of ABCN plus the students and teachers from Belridge Secondary College worked with team Accenture Australia on exactly this problem. Anuradha Bhowmick and the Accenture team have been working with ABCN at mentoring High School students to help prepare them for the future. Yesterday we had a half day workshop that had some fun activities and real interview techniques for students. They: üòÄ Role played introducing themselves; üò¨ Practiced talking about themselves in a professional (and positive) way; and üòÅ Prepared and practiced behavioural interview questions. None of these are easy. It is awkward talking about who we are, and why we are great. But if you don‚Äôt tell your potential employer .. who will? The students of Belridge were excellent and really engaged. This was great information and practice I wish I had ‚Ä¶ something something .. years ago. Thanks Anu for your leadership and our mentors Hafeezur Rahman Shaik, Meng How Y. , Erwin Bauernschmitt, Dipankar Saha and Alexander de Boer. Thank you Ashley Mourtiz and Andrew and all the students from Belridge, and Tiffany Edwards of ABCN for making a difference.\n\nAre Digital Twins having a moment? I‚Äôve seen a lot of interest in large scale digital twins lately https://lnkd.in/dpKg7cQ4 From the usual big industrials to retail twins, state wide digital twins to country wide digital twins. https://lnkd.in/d2kpAUJd Digital Twins go back to NASA. https://lnkd.in/dFB5rudd During the 1970 Apollo 13 mission, NASA simulated solutions to get their Astronauts safely back to earth. Simulating solutions to complex problems from 300,000km away is a great example of a Digital Twin. I don‚Äôt go back that far, but I‚Äôve delivered Digital Twins from Titanium Dioxide plants, to Iron Ore supply chains, to state wide power grids. With the number of recent Digital Twin projects, it has made me think: what have I learnt in the last two decades? üí¨ Start with the stakeholders: We often focus on technical and engineering users. It‚Äôs important to include the funders, regulators, the JV owners etc. At the start I like to create personas for each of the main groups. What do they need? What is their involvement? What are their motivations? üí¨ Start with the decisions people need to be able to make: What specific decisions will they make? What information do they need initially and how will they be updated? How will it be supported by UI? It‚Äôs simple advice, but start with wireframes. Use these to engage and design your solution. There is nothing worse than finishing the ‚Äúplatform‚Äù and realising you can‚Äôt support your decisions makers' needs. üí¨ Don‚Äôt forget the simulations: Data and platform work needs to be done, but your models should be a priority. Start your models early, there is nothing worse than staring at a big pile of data and little insight and no budget left (I know, I‚Äôve been there). Some of this is simple. But, we often forget the basics in the complexities (and excitement) of new technology. I‚Äôve made these mistakes, and seen the power of making them work. Are you seeing Digital Twins appearing more often? What lessons have you got to share? Matti Seikkula, Christophe Bourdeau, Davinia Simon, Theresa Eyssens ‚òÅÔ∏è , Fay Cranmer\n\nWhat is your potential as a leader? Yesterday we had the pleasure of spending time with Jenny Steadman and Jo Klap of Potential Project. The focus was leadership, engagement and some of the normal human pieces of us that make it hard sometimes. I walked away thinking that we as leaders are all ongoing renovation projects. Nothing is off-the-shelf. So we have to renovate that, fix this, throw that out. Jen and Jo made this fact and activity based ... and also fun. It was great to get together with our peers face to face, as half of the learning is from each other. #leadership #accentureaustralia\n\nWant to learn some secrets on better Executive Summaries? I have a plan. To democratise some of the skills new managers and consultants need. Writing impactful powerpoint decks is where I'm starting. My original plan was to get to a solid \"Version 1.0\" and share it widely .. but I was reading Sally Pedlow post on speed trumps perfection... and I thought \"I agree .. but why aren't I applying that?\" So here you go. It's a work in progress. The deck has 90-ish slides I've re-created from 30 years of doing this. There's a .pptx version and a .pdf version if you want to browse on mobile. I've also got several posts documenting some of the thinking behind it all. I hope you find it useful. https://lnkd.in/g65NXnkC #highimpactdocuments #management #leadership #managementconsulting\n\nConstruction has begun on one of Australia's biggest batteries. This Collie WA battery energy storage system (BESS) is expected to be complete by end of 2025. It will provide 500MW to the grid and 2,000MWh storage capacity. It was designed for short duration storage in peak times to ease pressure on the grid. Synergy has said that it could be expanded to 1 GW / 4 GWh in future. What does this mean? A few things jump out to me: üîã Support of renewables with storage to soak up additional solar energy generated during our hot sunny days (and there has been a few lately); üîã Once constructed, this battery system will be one of the top 3-5 biggest batteries in the world (but note ... many more are being constructed and planned, many in Australia ‚òÄÔ∏è); üîã More high tech future focused jobs in the south west as the state plans to retire the coal-fired Collie Power Station in 2027. Looks like a great investment in the energy future of WA. #energytransformation #energytransition #WA #bess https://lnkd.in/g-_ucgKw"
