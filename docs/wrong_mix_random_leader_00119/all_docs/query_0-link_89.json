        "text": "Ethan Hynes\n\nENLS 120 – Tolkien and Lewis\n\nPaul Siewers\n\nSeptember 25th, 2020\n\nEverything is Not What it Seems\n\nA riot erupts, citizens are enraged and the quell the demonstrations, here come the N.I.C.E police. Newspapers gloat of the heroic actions of the National Institute of Co-Ordinated Experiments (N.I.C.E) police force, yet the citizens of C.S. Lewis’ third book in his Space Trilogy, That Hideous Strength, are left questioning what is truly going on in their quaint little farm town. N.I.C.E. directs its public image to be portrayed and viewed in a certain light, whether that be done through articles, word of mouth or the overall company presentation, they propagate the inhabitants of Edgestowne therefore, to see them not as the monsters they are, but rather as their savior. N.I.C.E educates through propaganda – much like the idea that C.S. Lewis in his book The Abolition of Man references for when educators are outside the Tao – making the people of Edgestowne view them as not only decent and beneficial, but necessary. Acting as a semi-totalitarian ruler of Edgestowne – not unlike Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s portrayal of Stalin and the U.S.S.R. in The Gulag Archipelago – N.I.C.E plays on fears of the public and institutes itself as the only viable option to continue moving forward. Like politics nowadays, the bias and propaganda represented in elections mirrors the way the N.I.C.E. attempts to portray its actions as beneficial and the way its opposition attempts to portray it as detrimental.\n\nMark Studock rides as a passenger in a car, stupefied by his companion and driver, Lord Feverstone, as well as the vehicle in which he finds himself, as the two men make their way towards N.I.C.E.’s Blood Transfusion Office at Belbury. The way in which Lord Feverstone and the car present themselves to Mark, issues unto him an impression of power and importance, therefore propagating Mark into initially thinking only the best. The first glance that Mark gets of the car leaves him bewildered. “The very size and style of the car had made a favorable impression on [Mark] the moment he saw it. The upholstery was of such fine quality that one felt it ought to be good to eat.” (Lewis 47) This initial impression that Mark develops of N.I.C.E. is crucial. While at this point in the novel, not many people are quite positive what the purpose of the corporation is, everyone wants to be a part of it. Mark is heading in to see if he will be accepted for a job position at N.I.C.E. Feverstone is accompanying him to what at this point in the story is declared the “nucleus” (Lewis 47) of N.I.C.E. It is always important to have an aesthetically pleasing presence when giving someone new, a first look into you and your company. The difference when it comes to N.I.C.E. is that the appearance they give off has malintent behind it. They are consciously attempting to ensure that those who see the exterior presence of the company, think about it in a more than positive light. They want no questions being asked and when it comes to riding around in luxury who is going to think twice that anything suspicious is going behind the scenes.\n\nMark, riding in the car, takes note on the appearance of his driver. The way that Mark describes him “And what fine, male energy (Mark felt sick of women at the moment) revealed itself in the very gestures with which Feverstone settled himself at the wheel and put his elbow on the horn, and clasped his pipe firmly between his teeth!” (Lewis 47) Feverstone – the face of N.I.C.E. represents a man of power. He is someone that Mark wants to be. He carries himself well and asserts his presence even merely while driving a car. While this is not out right propaganda, it gives the impression of importance and something that is good. Mark even continues on later on page 47 to comment on that fact. He says, “The long, straight nose and the clenched teeth, the hard bony outlines beneath the face, the very way he wore his clothes, all spoke of a big man driving a big car to somewhere where they would find big stuff going on.” The appearance of Feverstone himself is enough to convince Mark that this is a man of importance and power. While that may not seem like anything serious, people often look at those who carry themselves well and present themselves as stated above, as good. Not that they are overall good people, but someone who dresses, talks, walks and acts the way that Feverstone does, would lead Mark not to assume the worst, but rather the best. Through this method of presentation, N.I.C.E. is propagating its future employees and the people of Edgestowne to make them see power and importance – something we all strive for – rather than a Nazi-esque eugenics lab that has seriously bad intentions.\n\nIn the next 48 hours a massive riot will erupt, but for the time being two members of N.I.C.E. – Mark and Fairy – are already writing newspaper articles to recount the tales of the riot: why it started, who started it and why only N.I.C.E. police could have handled it. N.I.C.E. engineers riots and then writes tales of how they were so successful in ensuring peace was brought back to order because they are trying to use this propaganda to demonstrate to the citizens of Edgestowne as well as the government that they are necessary for the safety and survival of the people. The newspaper article is the perfect example of how N.I.C.E. is using propaganda to not only skew the view of the people but solidify themselves as an institution of absolute necessity. Mark writes two articles for them to release regarding the incidents of the riot (that hasn’t actually happened yet). In his second article he talks to how the riots were engineered – not by N.I.C.E. but rather citizens of the town attempting to sabotage the institution and its name. “There are traitors in the camp…I don’t care who they are, but I have one thing to tell them. Take care. The people of England are not going to stand this. We are not going to have the institute sabotaged.” (Lewis 131) Here Mark goes so far as to even make the people believe that only did N.I.C.E. not have anything to do with this riot, but that in fact there are people in the town that are trying to sabotage the institute by starting these riots. One important thing to note here is the word “traitor”. This article is propagating the rest of the population to view those that “started” this riot as traitors. In doing this they create a fear and stigma. People don’t want to be caught up in the fact that they may be called a traitor so rather they pledge their full support to the institute. Something very similar happens in The Gulag Archipelago. At a dinner party they are referencing Stalin and everyone begins to clap. The clapping goes on and on and on because no one wants to be the first to stop. Now, if someone were to stop it does not mean that they do not support their country or their leader, but there has been so much propaganda flowing that people don’t want to stop in the fear that they may be called a traitor.\n\nMark’s article reads on and towards the end, he gives his opinion on how these situations should be handled in the future. Mark suggests that the whole town be placed under Institutional Police because they have proved themselves the only solution and imperative to keeping the peace in Edgestowne. “I say, put the whole place under the Institutional Police…It doesn’t make sense to expect these poor old Bobbies to deal with an ENGINEERED RIOT. Last night the N.I.C.E. police showed that they could.” (Lewis 131) The article in itself was entirely propaganda from N.I.C.E. They are creating a false sense of truth surrounding the events of the riot. They want to show the people of Edgestowne that the police that exist already are not qualified or prepared enough to handle serious situations such as riots. To connect to other writings of C.S. Lewis, specifically, The Abolition of Man, the idea that when those in power are educating outside of the Tao, they end up propagating. In this part of the article, Mark is making an attempt to educate the people of Edgestowne who will be reading the article on the shortcomings of the local police, and how great and powerful the institutional police are. They are taking reason away from the people and rather incanting into them the idea that these problems (riots) are natural and there must be a force that can adequately handle them. The reasonable thought that would come to most is that there was not problems in the quiet, countryside town of Edgestowne until N.I.C.E. arrived. Similarly, this can be connected to The Gulag Archipelago. In Solzhenitsyn’s book, it is seen that the people of the Soviet Union recognize that there are problems, but they are convinced that all the problems that exist are a result of outside forces that want to eradicate the Soviet Union. They are propagated into believing that the Soviet Union is the answer not the problem, same as the fact that the inhabitants of Edgestowne are told N.I.C.E is the solution not the problem.\n\nAs Mark’s article is coming to an end he leaves readers with one final warning – those who are not with us are against us. Mark institutes the idea that everyone supports N.I.C.E. and what they are doing therefore using propaganda to create a false sense of total support for N.I.C.E. and a creation of enemies in those who are against it. “I’ve one bit of advice. If you hear anyone backbiting the N.I.C.E. police, tell him where he gets off…If you hear anyone talking about the liberties of England (by which he means the liberties of the obscurantists, the Mrs. Grundies, the Bishops, and the capitalists), watch that man. He’s the enemy.” (Lewis 131) Mark has eluded to the fact that those who are not in support of the institution are against it, but in this portion of the article he makes clear and definitive statements. He says that those people that out right dissent against the Institution or anything that it stands for, are the enemy of the institution itself. This is very similar to the Soviet era ideals outlined by Solzhenitsyn. He talks of how those who were not necessarily enemies of the state, were perceived as such based on the sole fact that they were not in full support. The totalitarian aspects of N.I.C.E. are truly illuminated in this article that Mark has written. Not only have they themselves engineered a riot in order to be able to establish their necessity to the people and the state, but they blame others for engineering it and deem those who oppose them as enemies. They use this propaganda to a scarily effective extent and ensure that not only are people not going to try and second guess them, but they are so terrified of the perception they will have if they are not in full support.\n\nN.I.C.E. is an evil organization that uses differing forms of propaganda to convince the people of Edgestowne that there is no malice in their actions, but rather they represent the best for the town, now and in the future. Using propaganda techniques such as the way they present to the outside world and engineered riots followed by false newspaper articles, initially solidifies them into the community. Looking at these actions, we can truly see the totalitarian aspects that N.I.C.E. has. And that is not unreasonable. At the time that C.S. Lewis was writing the novel, he was living in the time of Stalin ruled, Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. We notice a lot of the same similarities between the two: falsifying information, creating panic and paranoia and naming any opposers as enemies. However, it is important to note one final similarity. No matter how much propaganda you shove into the face of your people and how many of those people are willing to fight tooth and nail for your totalitarian regime, they all come to an end. Just as the N.I.C.E. corporation falters and decays after a while, so did all those during WWII. Propoganda is still ever present in the world today and it is often hard to determine the difference between real and fake information. The important thing is actively trying to look past what things appear to be and what you read in the newspapers or see on TV and truly try and find the real purpose behind what is going on.\n\nBibliography\n\nLewis, C. S. THAT HIDEOUS STRENGHT. Scribner , 1945.\n\nLewis, C. S. The Abolition of Man. Exciting Classics, 2013.\n\nSolženicyn Aleksandr, and H. T. Willetts. The Gulag Archipelago. Harper & Row, 1978.\n\nThe Gulag Archipelago foreword, outlines the struggle between trying to voice the truth while the country you are a citizen to, is working to silence you. Chapter 7 of That Hideous Strength is about the struggle that Jane faces between wondering whether her husband is working for the enemy and if she should stay loyal or follow the path the Director wants for her. The difficulty of deciding between doing what is right and the cost that comes with it is present in both writings. This theme perpetuates through the foreword and chapter 7, therefore we can understand that what both writers are trying to demonstrate is that there are times when we face the harshness of reality and we must choose between doing what is the right thing and living with your decision to do so.\n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn spoke out about what it was like to live in the Soviet Union. He was the voice trying to expose the corruptness and terrible conditions plaguing his home country. From military service to imprisonment and banishment, Solzhenitsyn suffered the ultimate consequence for speaking his truth about the country that he lived in. He chose to be the one to bare the weight of his countries short comings in an effort to make it right for those who would follow him. He knew that writing such volumes of literature would land him in the negative eye of his country’s leaders, but he chose the reap the consequences and brunt the force of speaking out. “I am indeed thrown arbitrarily into history. I therefore choose to voluntarily shoulder the responsibility of my advantages and the burden of my disadvantages – like every other individual.” (Foreword) Solzhenitsyn did not view himself special, rather he understood that same as every other man, he had a duty to his comrades, friends and countrymen to denounce the atrocities occurring in his country for the betterment of all. Solzhenitsyn was willing to pay the price for choosing to do the right thing and bring to light the faults of the world he existed in.\n\nSimilar to Solzhenitsyn, Jane is faced with a difficult decision in chapter 7. Jane is brought to the manor so that she can be interrogated of sorts and confirm the identity of the man that she saw in her dreams. Following that she is introduced to the director – man she initially mistakes for being very young. During her conversation with the Director, he thanks her for the help she has provided and and then proceeds to say, “We had hoped you would be able to join us – to become a part of our army.” (142) Jane slightly puzzled by the comment, inquires as to why she would not be able to. In turn, the Director responds “it would be hard for the same person to be the wife of an official in the N.I.C.E and also a member of my company.” (142) In this era, women are supposed to obey their husbands. Jane wants to become a part of the company, but they are unsure. Jane says, “Is it fair that my whole life should be spoiled just because he’s got mixed up with some horrible people? You don’t think a woman is to have no life of her own just because she’s married?” (143) Jane here is struggling in the same situation that Solzhenitsyn found himself in. She wants to ability to fight back against what is wrong and to do so she has to denounce the man that she vowed her life to. He is her “master” and by working for the company she would be betraying him. After leaving the manor and getting on the train home, Jane found herself – by some less than intelligent actions – being questioned by police to see where she had been and why she had been there.\n\nThe idea that people choose to stand up for what is right, consequences be damned, is overarching in these two chosen literary passages. Both Solzhenitsyn and Jane recognize the danger of their decisions and yet, they act upon them anyways."
