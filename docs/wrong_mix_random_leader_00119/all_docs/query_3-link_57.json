        "text": "Just press the top right little circle to get a red marker placed at the present pressure/dial needle location. What would be really useful, and I would pay for a small sum, is if the dial could be set to record what pressure there was, every hour perhaps? A holding of that for about a monthâs worth of data points, or even a fortnight, would do. Iâd just want a fwd/bkwd arrow then, to cycle through the pressures/needle positions, that the barometer had experienced every hour (for example), up to the present point. My main gripe, is niggly, which is that when you first get it, you have no way of knowing what previous pressures wereâ¦but then again, if you bought a barometer and hung it on your wall, that would be the same issue!\n\nSo, just the ability to retain and cycle through, the last week or fortnight of hourly pressures the barometer experienced, would be good - as the whole value of a barometer, is the general drift, not the actual pressure reading at any instant necessarily. I got it for the ipad and the iphone. Donât even know if the ipad has a barometer?! Itâs also sideways, on the ipad, but thatâs not terrible either. Thanks, great app, these are just my âidealâ improvements, it does what I neededâ¦and hey, as soon as I got it, weâre getting the hottest, most beautiful two September weeks since I canât remember when."
