        "text": "Happy new year all! To kick start the year, a blog, jointly written by Feargus O’Raghallaigh and I, on economic and business trends. This is the first of a series of blogs under this topic. We hope you find it interesting. Mark\n\n\"The old year, a tear in the eye of time;\n\nfrost on the blackthorn, the ditches glamorous\n\nwith rime\";\n\nCarol Ann Duffy, The Wren Boys\n\nThe diurnal, seasonal and annual marking of time is a human ritual. The change of year has its own importance – a moment of looking back and to the future. Making predictions in this (or any) context though is a mug's game. There is always the unexpected. Many events and non-events through 2016 have acquired status as proof of this proposition.\n\nEven with all of the opinion polling and sampling so many people got it wrong on Brexit and the US presidential and general elections. No one counted Brexit a possibility, saw Cameron's fall or, once that had happened, the rise of Theresa May. Everyone expected a series of increases in US interest rates staged through the year: they did not happen. Most people (who were aware of it) hoped for a 'yes' in the Italian referendum, which Prime Minister Renzi kept postponing (because he knew the ground level reality). There are many other examples. And there is the Big One: The Donald's triumph.\n\nBut was it all 'the unexpected' or was it as much evidence of a delusioned illusion in the higher reaches of political and business circles in the West? Was it that the 'liberal-global consensus' as it is called that binds together so many governing establishments and elites in the western hemisphere was believed to be so deeply entrenched in wider society as to be unbeatable and uncontestable? Was it to a degree a replay of the Fall of the Wall and its consequences?\n\nBack in 1989 famously, Francis Fukuyama formulated a thesis, 'The end of history?' He asked whether the defeat of the Soviet system represented the global triumph of the liberal Western model, “the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\" To be fair to Fukuyama he did include the question mark (which not many noticed). So the rise, spread and appeal of Islamism including in its most violently anti-Western forms, in a post-Soviet world came as a shock. Equally shocking was the refusal to adopt full-fledged open market policy in many emerging market economies in Asia. Maybe 2016 should be seen as a fresh reminder that we don't have a global triumph of the liberal model – not even in the West itself apparently.\n\nAnyway, political philosophy aside what of the coming year even (and especially) keeping in mind the proposition with which this blog opened? The answer has to be 'caution', extreme caution actually.\n\nEconomics and politics – and commerce – are always deeply interwoven. However this might be one of those moments when it is, as it were, all change at the station – when balances between forces shift dramatically. This might be the moment when the particular balance of forces that since the early 1970s drove development and shaped the West (and much of the rest of the world economy of today) are reordering.\n\nFrom the perspective of the big sweeps of economic and political history we can suggest that broadly since the 1971 collapse by the US of the Bretton Woods world of politically managed national economies and currencies there has been a certain tide behind events. What happened in 1971 was the realisation by the US that its dollar was hugely overvalued in the context of being both pegged to gold and functioning as de facto the world's currency for trade and settlement purposes. First the US abandoned the gold standard and a few years later (1974) cast capital controls aside – thus officially leaving the dollar to find its private market price. The British followed suit with sterling in 1979 also left to find its rate in the market and the Germans a few years later. 1979 was also the year of launch for the EMU in an attempt to manage currency fluctuations among the non-sterling members of the EU (including Ireland). It was not plain sailing – in Europe or globally. By 1985 with the so-called Plaza Accord governments were back in the business of trying to manage currencies though the Plaza episode was over by the mid-1990s.\n\nSecond alongside this choppy voyage to private market-determined currency rates and increasing unrestricted capital flows there was the emergence of truly global and enormous international financial services based on unfettered markets in currencies, real assets and their financial derivatives. Third, international trade in manufactures was ever more free and in the (expanding) EU economic integration was rapidly introduced through the single market programme. Fourth, the national social protection regimes that so featured in the first thirty or so years after WWII were variably reduced with also erosions in the workplace collective bargaining power of employees.\n\nCould it be that this 'order' either has come to an end or could begin to unravel over the next and coming years? Obviously unhedged forecasting is folly but nonetheless change is in the air.\n\nBy mid-January the US will have a president and government and a congressional majority consumed by a particular economic narrative of America-in-the-world. The storyline is that some 'real America' – call it 'Main Street' – has for at least twenty years been sacked and sapped by a coalition of US Big Business – call it 'Wall Street' – and the rest of the world from Dublin to Beijing. The Obama years are the apogee of this sorry saga. The new dispensation is intent on unpicking as far as possible as quickly as it can much of what has been done both domestically and internationally by the Obama administration. Exports are 'in'; imports are 'out'; and big global deals like TPP and TTIP are to be 'non grata'. In addition the new administration will (with whatever success is uncertain) set out to rebalance the relationship between corporate America and Washington: the emphasis is to be on companies prioritising 'jobs at home' and profit repatriation; and big government investment. It is about corporate America accepting the new regime, the carrot being lower taxes at home and a radical new framework for corporate taxation generally. This is about 'Making America Great Again', a world in which in DC politics 'Main Street' counts more than 'Wall Street'.\n\nThis intended shift in policy direction is enormous although it also contains echoes of previous big shifts. There is significant resistance to it, not only politically and not confined to the US. There is likely to be little change in the instability that has characterised Washington politics over the last eight years (only the naysayers have changed). And the next elections are but two years away.\n\nSome aspects of the new regime were coming anyway, for example the enlarged role for public spending – fiscal policy; also globalism in the sense of big trade deals and some aspects of corporate taxation and Big Business behaviour (such as inversions).\n\nThere is though lack of clarity on some important questions. What it means for monetary and exchange rate policy pillars of public policy is unclear. Also the interplay between foreign policy and economics, critically with respect to Russia.\n\nWe have no conception of what view will be taken in Washington on the dollar – except that it will be political; the currency will not be left to market forces. Second, trade is not dead though the focus will likely be on bilateral and plurilateral dealings with focus on key Pacific players (such as China, Japan, South Korea) and a tying of trade rules with exchange rate policy. Expect bumpy rides on FX markets and lots of politics (added to by Brexit). We have no idea what the new corporate tax framework will entail – or how long it will take to legislate and implement. That though makes for more uncertainties from an Irish perspective. Again however this has been a long time coming – and transparently so.\n\nEurope apart from Russia is unlikely to rate high on the Trump agenda. If he wins at home politically on his Russia gambit the trade embargo should collapse, without a tear shed in the EU and possibly some good prospects by the way-side for the Irish food industry and farmers. One thing is clear. It is that US politics is going to be important for world business (and economic politics) in ways that we have not seen for decades.\n\nHaving said that speculation is a mug’s game, business planning, of course – or at least thinking about planning – is necessary. In times of volatility, we tend to keep the big, long-term picture blurred, and focus on the identifiable knowns and unknowns in the short-term. What then might seem sensible to focus on in that front?\n\nWell, first we are looking at a reasonably stable first half of the year in terms of major exchange rates and interest rates. Scanning the various pundits and forecasts there are trends – gradually increasing interest rates in the U.S., Europe and U.K., the Euro strengthening somewhat against sterling, and relatively little inflation change, with the exception of the U.K. – but the signals are weak, and the uncertainty factor must be read to be high. The building – and unpicking – of trade arrangements take a lot of time – and so the short-term indicators for changes in trade environment are relatively benign, but again the longer term trends are hard to read. More than anything, we have a scenario where something that we believed gone from the western world at least - political risk - seems to be the shadow that we cannot quite penetrate. Individual risks and decisions will be judged against that backdrop, and so length of exposures may need to be considered very carefully.\n\nOne piece of advice, acknowledging a factoid. The opening day of trading saw over USD30bn of bond issuance in New York. This is notable because we haven’t seen volume of this magnitude, even relatively, for many years – and where we have it has been a reaction to Central Bank economic stimulus. Countries have also been going long in their borrowing in the early days of the year. It tells us all something we should heed – the big guys believe interest rates will rise sooner rather than later. Get your balance sheet in order is the message – manage leverage and lock in at the right rates.\n\nAnd so much for setting the scene. Next week, a closer look at Europe and Ireland in particular."
