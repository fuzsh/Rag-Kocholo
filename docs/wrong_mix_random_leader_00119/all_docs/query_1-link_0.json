I was happy to recently get 3200 points in 3dmark03\n\nI tested the same system twice there was 2000 difference between the scores. I did no updates of anykind. wierd!\n\nAnd why is everybody talking about there scores off there actuall score. The scoring system with bench mark is different. Of coarse they look low. It just like when we went from 3dmark05 to 3dmark06. But we also upgraded too.\n\nAnd why is everybody talking about there scores off there actuall score.

Its essentially a virtual 3DMark 06. This can be proved by looking at the Fastest System that it throws up of 32513 from TeamItaly. It analyses actual 3DMark 06 scores for various components/systems to come up with your virtual score. The results do seem a bit variable though - mine was only 128 off, but others are a few thousand.\n\nHahahahahahaha!!!! I don't know what it thinks I have, but it gives me 29800 pts. I ran it twice in FF, and twice in IE with the same results. lol\n\nHahahahahahaha!!!! I don't know what it thinks I have, but it gives me 29800 pts.

I don't know what it thinks I have, but it gives me 29800 pts. I ran it twice in FF, and twice in IE with the same results. lol\n\nI know that feeling. I tried virtualmark a month ago and got my score of 28000... I don't know how both of us got extreme score! Watering time??"
