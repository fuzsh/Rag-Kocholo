        "text": "Update 07/12/24 at 4:00 p.m.: Gizmodo communicated with Microsoft about an issue with the PC’s battery settings, and after a fix we redid our battery tests. The score was updated to reflect the increase in battery life after initial tests.\n\nAfter several weeks with the Copilot+-ified version of the Microsoft Surface Pro in hand, Iâm at a loss for words other than annoyed. My 11th-generation Surface Pro consistently set my blood to a lukewarm temperature throughout my use. On occasion, this laptop made my blood hot enough to boil over.\n\nItâs one of the few times a product has me ranting to some nonplussed friends who probably didnât want to hear about âAI PCsâ over evening drinks. I didnât buy into the Copilot+ PC hype, yet I was still largely disappointed with my experience despite the promises about performance and AI capabilities. The Surface Proâs new chipâin my case, the Snapdragon X Eliteâis good enough for most tasks, though its versatility is overstated. The prophesied AI capabilities are currently pointless.\n\nThereâs plenty to like. I enjoyed typing on it with the keyboard on my lap and the screen on my desk. The bright OLED screen makes it easy to last long in the chair. Itâs fast enough for any task I could throw at it (at least compatible).\n\nBut the biggest issue is its price. The Surface Pro starts at $1,000, but thatâs stretching the truth. With the newly redesigned Flex Keyboard sold separately, youâll at least have to pay around $1,500 for the all-new PC with minimum specs and the Snapdragon X Plus chip. My review unit costs $1,950 for a system with 16 GB of RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and the more powerful Snapdragon X Elite chip. Thatâs a lot for any PC, but does the convertible versatility make up for it? Considering its varying limitationsâno, it doesnât.\n\nThe Surface Pro looks like a tablet. It has the same power and volume controls as a tablet, but itâs not a tablet. Microsoft calls it a âflexible laptop,â orâin other wordsâitâs a convertible that doesnât function well without the keyboard.\n\nWindows 11 has no tablet mode, though the display will still reorient itself if you hang it lengthwise. Microsoft hasnât sold a keyboard in the box of past yearsâ Surface Pros as well, but the lack of one feels considerable in 2024. Thatâs a high price for some decent specs and the separate $450 Surface Pro Flex Keyboard and Slim Pen bundle that Microsoft is promoting next to its latest not-tablet. Itâs an excellent keyboard, to be sure. Itâs not worth the cost of a solid Chromebook just by itself.\n\nAll Copilot+ PCs are billed as productivity-only devices. Theyâre not meant for gaming. Fair enough, but youâll also have to remember the ARM-based chips are still new for the Windows ecosystem. Microsoft tried this before in 2019, but there were so few supporting apps that the company has dialed back its ARM ambitions until now. In 2024, youâll find that a fair few of your regularly used apps work natively with the new chips, and some donât run well on the new Prism x64-x86 emulation layer. Eventually, youâll find that one app you regularly use, like Blender, doesnât have an ARM version. Occasionally, youâll find apps like Apple Music donât support Windows on ARM at all.\n\nSo itâs not horrible, but itâs far from perfect. We originally experienced very poor battery life considering the PC’s original promise of a full day when browsing. Our PC was using battery settings that were not native to other Surface laptops, despite being on the latest patch. After updates, the battery settings returned to normal and we experienced a lifespan much closer to what was originally promised. If anything, the confusion points to the rushed nature of the first generation of Copilot+ PCs, though new buyers should expect pretty consistent experiences a few weeks after release.\n\nI wouldnât be so harsh if the Surface Pro and Copilot+ were merely an average Windows experience. In its current iteration, itâs worse than what you can get on other PCs. ARM is still up and coming, and maybe it truly is the architecture of the future, but for now, itâs inherently limiting. And yet, even if I consider what this âflexible laptopâ would be without the ARM chip, I still think itâs an overpriced piece of hardware that doesnât know what it is.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro Design and Usability\n\nWhy Canât Microsoft Abandon the Surface Connect Port?\n\nThe review unit sent to me by Microsoft is a fine-looking laptop. The blue color is as comforting as an empty sky on a clear day. The machine feels solid, if a bit weighty, for what you get at just under 2 pounds. With the new haptic touchpad, the keyboard offers a solid and surprisingly clicky typing experience. The material used is comfortable for my palms, and I didnât have more than the occasional issue with palm rejection.\n\nAnd yet, I canât help feeling Microsoft has an antiquated sense of what users want. The Surface Connect port remains. The supplied cable slots in easily enough but takes up much more room than practically any other proprietary port on the market. Sure, you can charge with Thunderbolt 4 USB, but why not exchange that port for something useful, like an SD card slot?\n\nAs with any older Surface Pro, itâs an awkward laptop that doesnât feel comfortable on your lap. Sticking the screen on the table and using the keyboard separately if you want to get cozy is better. The Flex Keyboard comes off easily enough, but if you lay the keyboard aside, there are very few reasons to use a Windows 11 PC as a pseudo tablet. The S Pen helps a bit, making scrolling easier with nice, haptic feedback built in. I tried using the stylus in Paint to try out the AI Cocreator mode, but the cursor lacked precision and speed.\n\nMicrosoft could have modified its design to make it better and easier to use. The Slim Pen doesnât have the versatility of the Apple Pencil Pro, let alone unique features like Barrel Roll. The keyboard and trackpad do the job well enough, but everything else is basically unchanged from previous generations. Now, it costs more than ever, and new specs or promised AI features donât necessarily justify the price increase.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro Performance\n\nStrong CPU Capabilities, but Not All That Was Promised\n\nThe Surface Pro promises youâll see some of the best performance for the size of its PCs. That ratio is, of course, whatâs promised by Appleâs Mac products with its M-series chips. I benchmarked the new PC directly against the M3 MacBook Air. Not to spoil anything, itâs not as dramatic as what was promised.\n\nThe Surface Pro is better than a base M3 on Appleâs latest Macs, but itâs not 58% more powerful, as Microsoft promised. In some of the most common PC benchmarks, like Geekbench 6, I saw 15% better scores in multi-core settings, but it did lose out under single-core settings. The same can be said for Cinebench 2024âs CPU benchmarks. The Surface Pro was also beating the XPS 14âs Intel Core Ultra 7 155Hâthe chip that originally promised the advent of âAI PCsââin all our CPU benchmarks by a pretty wide degree, and it held up relatively well even against machines with more powerful Intel chips. It wonât beat out a high-powered gaming laptop CPU, but for small-scale portable computers, itâs a solid CPU with some staying power compared to Appleâs latest.\n\nBut thatâs not the whole story. We usually perform a test using the video encoding software Handbrake, where we time how long it takes to transcode a copy of the 4K movie Tears of Steel to 1080p. This was using the ARM64 version of Handbrake, not the Prism emulation, and yet it took the Surface Pro a bit longer than MacBook Air 13 with M3.\n\nThe Snapdragon X Elite isnât meant to be a graphics chip, and it shows. I can compare the ARM-based chips with 3D Markâs Wild Life Extreme. The Snapdragon X Elite scored 6160, while the base M3 chip on the MacBook Air scored 7561.\n\nDoes any of this matter if all you want is a zippy, small productivity PC? Not necessarily, no. I was happy with the speed of Microsoftâs latest convertible. The bigger question is whether any of this power justifies the price increases from previous generations of Surface Pros or even your regular laptop PC. That will depend on how well it supports current software.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro Software and Compatibility\n\nThe AI Features are Dull and Pointless\n\nThe whole rigmarole of figuring out if your app is working on ARM should be hands-off for the average user. Microsoft promises customers wonât know when their favorite app or program runs on the Prism emulator. Thatâs true for the most part unless you depend on PC performance for the app to run well.\n\nSo the next question is, how much support will you get from the range of apps that work fine on x64/x86? Browsers from Chrome to Firefox and even Opera or Brave will work fine. The Windows version of Arc, however, wonât. It wonât install from the executable, let alone work on the Prism emulator.\n\nAll your Microsoft 365 apps are rejiggered for ARM, and Slack works just as well as regular Windows for annoying you with message popups. I downloaded Photoshop and found that it worked completely fine, though the cloud fully handles the appâs art generator capabilities. I have a feeling these PCs might not have enough NPU to handle Photoshopâs AI model.\n\nSo itâs mostly good news, right? Well, itâs a good experience until you look for that one app that isnât on ARM and Copilot+, and thereâs a chance they may never come. Try searching for Apple Music for Windows or on the Windows Store, and you will not find it. Appleâs music app does not support Windows on Arm; as we know, the company doesnât plan to.\n\nMost apps that do run on Prism work perfectly fine. I use DisplayCal for brightness tests, and the legacy program ran on the ARM processor without any noticeable hiccups. However, youâll still find apps hampered by that lack of support. We usually run a Blender benchmark test for our PCs and Macs, but Blender doesnât have a native ARM64 version. The program took about 5 minutes to render a scene through Prism emulation, whereas other modern PCs take three or less on average. As good as it is for most applications, Prism is a nonstarter for programs that require extra juice.\n\nThis also means that Microsoft has tried to position the ARM Copilot+ PCs as far away from gaming as possible. And yet, Microsoft, in all its wisdom, preloads the Xbox app on Windows 11. Do you pay for Xbox Game Pass on PC? Microsoft restricts you from downloading your titles on the native Xbox app. Instead, itâs relegated to cloud gaming only. Remember how Microsoft owns Minecraft? Well, the game wonât even download from the Microsoft Store. Hitting the âInstallâ button leaves you with a blue spinning wheel of death.\n\nThat being said, nothing is stopping you from downloading your game clients and trying it anyway. I played games like Baldurâs Gate III on my Surface Pro, and I found you could get relatively stable framerates but only on the lowest settings. The folks at Forbes did a pretty good rundown of which games did or didnât work on ARM. Itâs far more fiddly and annoying to game on Copilot+ than any modern PC, even those without any discrete GPU.\n\nWhat you get from the Surface Pro is up to you, but donât expect anything life-changing from the much-hyped AI. Recall isnât available on any of the new Copilot+ PCs at launch. This is, overall, a good thing. The glaring security flaws in the software made it clear there needed more effort to make sure usersâ data was safe. Plus, itâs being made completely optional.\n\nThe rest of the new AI features exclusive to Copilot+ are largely pointless. You can go into Photos, click on an image, and then use the new AI restyle to fool around with some images, but beyond making the backgrounds of your photos murkier or sticking a horrendous facsimile of a walrus into the foreground of your image, itâs not doing much. Image Creator in the Photos app and Cocreator in Microsoft Paint are dull, pointless toys that might give you an hour of distraction at most.\n\nThere are also some new Live Captions features that automatically translate audio and video in near real-time. The translated text appears as a big transparent window. I tried to watch some Spanish-language videos, and I found the translations relatively slow and inaccurate if the speaker talks quickly or urgently.\n\nThis AI image generation is happening on-device. You can tell by how the NPU gets maxed out during generation. Compare those AI images to the same prompt done on Windows Copilot, which is the cloud-centric model based on OpenAIâs DALL-E, and thereâs no comparison. These PCs may boast the best NPU capabilities of any consumer-grade chip, but their outing on Copilot+ doesnât seem to hold a candle to what you can get on the cloud.\n\nIn addition, some new apps leverage the NPU, like CapCut, Davinci Resolve, and the WhatsApp public beta for Windows Studio Effects. I havenât used all of these, but letâs be honest: The background blur effect on video calls wasnât that taxing on our GPUs to begin with. The NPU is nice for taking the onus off the CPU and GPU, but it wonât sell most people on a PC.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro Display and Webcam\n\nNice, Bright OLED and Solid Webcam\n\nA big benefit of the Surface Pro is the display. Itâs bright and colorful, which is the best way a 13-inch screen can be. You canât do much better if you want a small, relatively lightweight laptop to watch YouTube or Netflix on.\n\nI registered a peak full-screen brightness of 495 nits, which is pretty damn good for an OLED screen. Itâs about the same full-screen brightness on the iPad Pro 2024 with its tandem-OLED display. Some others who have used the Surface Pro noted issues with text legibility and graininess with whites on the OLED screen, but I didnât experience any hint of that over several weeks of use.\n\nThereâs also a surprising benefit to the Surface Pro with its webcam. Itâs not something I put much stock in for a PC nowadays (do my coworkers need to see the bags under my eyes in hi-def?). Yet, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the picture coming through, even under the murky fluorescent lights of our office.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro Battery Life\n\nA Pretty Solid Battery Life for Such a Thin PC\n\nMicrosoft promised 14 hours of battery life, which the company meant included 14 hours of video playback and 10 hours of web usage. Either way, itâs supposed to be an âall-day batteryâ with a 53 Whr capacity.\n\nOur initial video playback tests indicate this convertible can do 14 hours of endless YouTube video. That was done with the computer running in “Best power efficiency” mode, which is normally not available on Surface PCs. After going back and forth with Microsoft, our Surface Pro reverted back to the slate of settings including the “Recommended” Power & battery mode that’s best used for daily tasks. We redid the video playback test, and again found the Surface was safe doing upwards of 14.5 hours of video playback on low brightness.\n\nI’ve used the PC over the past week, and found I could easily get the promised 8 hours of battery life during regular browsing and work tasks. On a day when I did two lengthy video calls, the battery lasted about 7 hours before I needed to plug it back in. Overall, the Surface Pro should last you a full workday. If you start seeing odd battery dips, my advice is you should check your Power & Battery settings to make sure they include the slate of “Recommended,” “Better Performance,” and “Best Performance” settings.\n\nGood Performance Canât Overcome all the Shortcomings\n\nIt doesnât seem viable at $450 for a keyboard and pen. You could use a different keyboard with the Surface Pro, but without the magnetic attachment points, they wouldnât protect your screen during transport. It seems like Microsoft is taking a page from Appleâs playbook, or at least itâs learning all the wrong lessons from its biggest tech competitor. At least with the iPad Pro 2024, it will still work as a tablet if you donât pay $300 for the Magic Keyboard."
