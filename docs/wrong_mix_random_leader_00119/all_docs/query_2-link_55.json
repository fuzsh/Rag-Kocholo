I was disappointed very much (please see my specs below to see why I was disappointed).\n\nThe Second problem:\n\nWhen I first set up the computer, whenever I would turn it off, it would beep continuously (just one continuous beep like your boiling water was ready) and it would not turn off, just sits there beeping that one continuous beep.\n\nThen after a while it started only doing that when I exit and save from the setup that comes up at startup (is that called the bios?), it does save my changes and everything, it just doesn't turn off or restart, and sits there beeping until i either hold the power button long enough to turn it off or click the PSU power button.\n\nWhat is described in the last paragraph is what is happening now.\n\nI hope someone could decipher what that the beep means, and what if anything I am doing wrong such that my computer(which should just completely rock if I understand what the words 8800GTX and 6400+ mean correctly) is not doing so well on that one test (or maybe that test is not even testing for frame rate? I don't know.

It is a CPU load test, basically \"turns off\" the Graphics card and gets the CPu to render everything and work out where all those little things are going. I only get 0.83FPS for test 1 and 1.33FPS for test 2. (the CPu tests).\n\nA really long beep usually means a serious hardware failure. I have only ever seen it twice. Once when I was OCing this machine, I went too far and got that continous beep after saving myover optimistic setting.\n\nThen on my dad's machine (see sig) I got it when I had forgotten to plug in one of the PCI-E power connectors into his GFX card.\n\nFinally, Your system should perform okay, its definetly not a beast, no offence, cus the Graphics card is way underpowered. I used to have that one, but got sick of not handling the latest games at the settings I wanted to use, even now I want to more, so I'm hopefully getting another 3870 to crossifre soon. As for the rest of your system it seems good, although I don't know too much about AMD cpu's. But the Graphics card I would say is the definate bottleneck in the system.\n\nBack to the beeping. Have you OC'd ur system. Something like that should be taken very serious, you could be damaging your hardware. Have a good look, make sure everything is properly connected, and try running on stocks, if your not already."
