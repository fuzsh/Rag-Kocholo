        "text": "A Message for Fathers\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark has a message for fathers that everyone should hear. It's to encourage men to step up and live a life of integrity and stand firm in how God has called you to lead or mentor other people.\n\nWhat Is the Church About?\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark talks about what the church is. The church is about everyone coming together and contending for the faith. It is not just about a building and attending a service on Sundays. We all play a part in what God has called each of us to do.\n\nGod at Work in You\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark talks about when everything was all about you. Mark wants you to recognize God being at work in your life now. It will change your attitude to what Mark calls an \"upside down attitude.\"\n\nWho Is Jesus?\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark talks about who Jesus is. Mark explains that Jesus is not a created being. Jesus has always been God, will always be God and forever into the future He is God almighty.\n\nThe Sin Nature\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark reminds you that man is from the seed of Adam and therefore has a sin nature. Jesus was not from the seed of man, therefore had no sin nature. He is from the seed of God so that He could pay the price for humanity by dying on the cross and rising from the grave.\n\nBold Steps Is Pro-Life\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark talks about how every unborn child has a spirit and that God has given every unborn child a destiny and a purpose. This is why Pastor Mark does not believe in abortion.\n\nThe Gap\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark talks about when you call out to God, but it doesn't seem like God is answering. Mark wants you to be encouraged to know that God does hear you and you may be experiencing what Mark refers to as \"the gap.\" You are in the waiting room of God.\n\nWaiting in Expectation\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark talks about shopping with his wife and how he waits for her with expectation until she comes out of the store. Mark does not know exactly when she will come out, but he knows she will and he is ready in his car to pick her up. This is how you should be waiting in expectation for God.\n\nKeep Looking Towards God\n\nPsalm chapter 5 verse 3 says, \"O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.\"\n\nToday on Bold Steps Minute, Pastor Mark talks about how you should take heart in waiting for the Lord, watching and staying faithful in all that you do.\n\nTrinkets\n\nSome trinkets simply must go."
