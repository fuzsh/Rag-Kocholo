        "text": "An ambitious growth plan for building a digital, sustainable and innovative economy\n\nA report from the Industry Strategy Council\n\nA time for ambition and bold action\n\nMessage from the chair\n\nThe year 2020 will be a turning point in history. The COVID-19 crisis has hit hard. Our personal and professional lives have been shaken, as have our routines and our presumptions. To protect human life, governments have had to take exceptional measures, such as imposing lockdowns and closing borders, significantly impacting the economy. The downturn in the global economy has led to a sharp drop in GDP. In the early months of the pandemic, Canada's GDP fell by an unprecedented 18%.\n\nGovernments and central banks around the world took sweeping action to contain the devastating effects of the crisis. The Government of Canada acted, releasing record amounts of capital in a short period to limit the impacts on individuals, families and businesses. It was against this unprecedented backdrop that the Industry Strategy Council began its work in June 2020 with a mandate to identify the scope and depth of COVID-19's impact on industry, inform government's understanding of specific sectoral pressures, and serve as a means to receive the business communities' input on the impact of the pandemic.\n\nI would like to thank the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry and the Government of Canada for their confidence. I would also like to extend my warmest compliments to our nine members for their tremendous commitment and thank the Council's Secretariat in Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, and the public officials that we consulted for their dedicated cooperation and support. Our mandate is broad and demanding.\n\nWe began our work with a sense of urgency and an eagerness to consult Canadians from across the country and from all economic sectors to gain a clear understanding of the situation. I had the privilege of participating in nearly 100 meetings with a large number of leaders from businesses, academia, associations, regions, Indigenous communities, community organizations and youth groups. All were candid and generous in expressing their needs—and sometimes their distress—but also their determination to do their part to get Canada back on its feet.\n\nYou have inspired us. You have motivated us. Your hopes and concerns shaped our thinking and our recommendations; we have grasped the urgency of the situation. Beginning in July and on an ongoing basis, we shared the content of our exchanges with government decision-makers, and in the following weeks, we witnessed several announcements and commitments from the Government echoing your concerns.\n\nWe set clear objectives from the outset: we wanted to be ambitious, bold and action-oriented. This approach inspired a three-phase action plan— Restart, Recover, Reimagine—which includes five primary recommendations.\n\nIn the Restart phase, we respond directly to the concerns expressed during our consultations. The urgency of supporting families, protecting jobs and sustaining businesses is about safeguarding the economic and social fabric of the country, standing firm while future waves of the pandemic loom and restoring confidence among Canadians.\n\nBy protecting our economic and social fabric, we put ourselves in a position to help the economy Recover. The Council is putting forward a bold set of recommendations that, if accepted, will rebuild our strengths and address the gaps that we are facing and that have been exposed by the crisis. We recommend taking the most effective government programs and stepping up efforts to develop our workforce, improve our infrastructure, strengthen our innovation ecosystems and facilitate access to capital. These are the basic attributes of successful economies. At the same time, we have the opportunity to modernize burdensome regulations to make them more agile, and use the Government's procurement capabilities strategically to strengthen key sectors, provide opportunities for innovative SMEs, and showcase homegrown know-how.\n\nWith these structuring and cross-cutting actions, we will create momentum to Reimagine our economy and set new bold ambitions. The crisis is transforming the world. Trends such as the fight against climate change, digitization, and artificial intelligence (AI) are accelerating, while others will emerge from the new geopolitics of the post-COVID-19 world. There will be new challenges and opportunities. Canada must prepare, capitalize on its core strengths, and aim for the top of the podium in promising areas such as digital and data; resources, clean energy, and clean technology; innovative high-value manufacturing and agri-food. Canada must develop a true post-pandemic industrial strategy and this strategy has to be implemented through an ambitious growth investment plan. This would set a precedent. But given the magnitude of the crisis, we strongly believe that this is the appropriate response. We need Canadian companies to be global leaders where we can succeed.\n\nThis investment and growth plan seeks to address our competitiveness, productivity and sustainability issues and to position ourselves as leaders for the world of tomorrow. The plan must be based on a solid and rigorous financial framework, with appropriate parameters to reassure Canadians and markets of the Government's plan for long-run fiscal discipline. This plan embodies an ambition—as well as an attitude. It's a way of acting. We want Canadian companies to be known for their ethical awareness and their values. They must embrace ESG principles and demonstrate their environmental, social, and governance responsibilities.\n\nWe will implement this plan by working together. The three phases— Restart, Recover, Reimagine— call for new public–private partnerships to pool resources and leverage investments between the various orders of government in Canada, while respecting each other's jurisdictions, to combine our efforts and maximize the impact.\n\n\"Working together in a renewed partnership across Canada\" was the most frequently expressed goal among participants in our consultations. The situation is too serious for best intentions alone. The impact is too great not to take action together. This crisis calls for Canadians to stand together. Let's build a promising future for the prosperity of all.\n\nMonique F. Leroux\n\nChair, Industry Strategy Council\n\nOctober 2020\n\nAbout the Industry Strategy Council (the Council)\n\nEstablished on May 8, 2020, by the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, the Industry Strategy Council is a forum that brought together experienced business leaders to work in partnership with the Government of Canada. The Council endeavoured to deepen a collective understanding of the scope and depth of COVID-19's impact on industries and inform the Government's understanding of specific sectoral pressures.\n\nThe Council is built on the foundation established by the Economic Strategy Tables, supported by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, a new model for collaboration between industry and government, launched in October 2017 to help turn Canadian economic strengths into global advantages. The Tables represented six sectors (Advanced Manufacturing, Agri-Food, Clean Technology, Digital Industries, Health/ Bio-sciences and Resources of the Future) identified by the Advisory Council on Economic Growth as having an outsized impact on Canada's economic growth potential. The report from the Economic Strategy Tables was published in September 2018, which included recommendations specific to tax competitiveness, regulatory reform, and export support. These were actioned in concrete policy announcements in the November 2018 Fall Economic Statement. Budget 2019 reinforced support for the Economic Strategy Tables and added a seventh table for Tourism and Hospitality.\n\nIn response to the challenges and particular pressures introduced by COVID-19, the Government launched the Industry Strategy Council with an additional two new tables representing the Retail and Transportation sectors in May 2020. Collectively, the nine economic sectors represented by the Industry Strategy Council account for about half of Canada's GDP.\n\nThe Council is chaired by Monique F. Leroux, former Chair, President and CEO of the Desjardins Group and Vice-Chair of Fiera Holdings Inc., and its membership is composed of the nine chairs of the Economic Strategy Tables—Advanced Manufacturing (Rhonda Barnet), Agri-Food (Murad Al-Katib), Clean Technologies (Karen Hamberg), Digital Industries (John Baker), Health/ Bio-sciences (Karimah Es Sabar), Resources of the Future (Mark Little), Retail (Paviter Binning), Tourism and Hospitality (Ben Cowan-Dewar), and Transportation (Sylvie Vachon). Ex-officio members include Dr. Mona Nemer, Chief Science Advisor, and Simon Kennedy, Deputy Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. A full list of Council members and their organizations is included in Annex E.\n\nAs Canadians and business leaders, it is an honour to have the opportunity to serve our country and represent our respective economic sectors. We have been inspired through our national consultations by the vision and thoughtful ideas that Canadians have offered to shape our economic recovery. It is a great privilege to share our insights and offer advice on how to best respond.\n\nOur response to this historic pandemic requires immediate, targeted and risk-based actions and we firmly believe we have a unique opportunity to take urgent action to build back better. Each of us can unequivocally say that the private sector is eager to collaborate with government to execute on transformative initiatives that can position Canada for economic success and improve the long-term quality of life for all Canadians.\n\nQuote from the Council\n\nAbout our report\n\nThis report begins with the context for our work—our assessment of Canada's current economic landscape based on the events that unfolded throughout the pandemic. In the context of this current crisis, we challenged ourselves to think about the most important problems that we could solve in order to have the biggest impact on growing our economy and improving the lives of Canadians.\n\nWe spoke with hundreds of key industry leaders and thought leaders across sectors and regions of Canada, including leaders of businesses, academia, associations, Indigenous communities, community organizations, and youth groups, to help us understand the impacts of COVID-19. We were touched by how Canadians have been affected and have struggled amid this pandemic. Throughout our consultations, we heard some great ideas—big ideas with transformative potential—that warranted further discussion. We share those in this report.\n\nWe also developed scenarios for recovery and then from there, built a framework to impact and change the economic outcomes of our country with the right strategic investments and policy changes. We became convinced Canada needed a renewed industrial strategy. As we worked together, across sectors, to formulate our recommendations, it became clear that there are areas where each sector can leverage the work of others to recover faster (e.g., the cross-cutting impact of digital, skills and innovation). We have outlined those in this report as well.\n\nThe result of the challenge that we gave ourselves is a comprehensive plan with recommendations in five key areas for building a digital, sustainable and innovative economy for all Canadians. It is a bold and ambitious plan aimed at accelerating our recovery and growth. It is also a responsible plan that leverages both private and public sector partnership and investments. The plan seeks to bring together the actions we need to take as a country, not just in solidarity but cohesively, because we cannot afford to take a piecemeal approach.\n\nThe spirit of our recommendations is built on the conviction that this crisis is the opportunity for transformative change. While Canada was in a certain position of strength, we were already facing challenges, in areas as diverse as productivity, capital investments and R&D, commercialization, digitization and trade. The world around us is moving quickly and in so many different ways—geopolitical changes, technological advancements, shifting demographics and climate change. With these pressures, we need to act quickly and anchor ourselves in areas that position us for the future.\n\nThe Council believes that implementing these recommendations will transform the country, placing Canada in a position of leadership on the world stage. If we rally together with a relentless conviction to do greater things, we could supply the world with Canadian innovations, and build prosperity and wealth for all Canadians.\n\nIndustry Strategy Council Members\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe Council would like to recognize Ex-Officio Members, Chief Science Advisor, Dr. Mona Nemer, and Deputy Minister, Simon Kennedy, for their valued contributions and insights throughout the span of the Council's work. We are also grateful for the tireless efforts of the Secretariat at Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThe Council\n\nThe Industry Strategy Council was created to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Canada's economy and identify the scope and depth of its impact on industry, inform government's understanding of specific sectoral pressures, and serve as a means to receive the business communities' input on the pandemic's impact. We challenged ourselves to go beyond this mandate to examine ways to enhance wealth and prosperity for Canadians. The work was based on extensive consultations with stakeholders representing over a thousand businesses, academic institutions, associations, community organizations, Indigenous communities and youth groups across sectors and across Canada. Our report is filled with their suggestions, concerns and hopes. We would like to thank them for their valuable contributions.\n\nThe Council also worked to assess the economic situation around the world. We provide recommendations that are grounded in Canadian reality and that anticipate a new post-COVID-19 geopolitical landscape. Together, they propose an ambitious vision of the opportunities that Canada could pursue to become a leader in some of the world's most promising sectors.\n\nThe shock\n\nIn the decade following the last recession, Canada's economic growth was among the highest in the G7. Despite this enviable performance, the Canadian economy was operating below its real potential. Canada faced persistent historical challenges, particularly in terms of productivity, private investment, trade and physical and digital infrastructure.\n\nWhen the health crisis erupted, the Government took the necessary steps to protect human life, bringing a significant portion of the economy to a halt. Known weaknesses in the economy contributed to the magnitude of the shock. But some of Canada's largest and best-managed companies were also hit hard by the outright collapse of their operations. In the early months of the pandemic, Canada's real GDP suffered its largest and sharpest contraction since data were first compiled in 1961, with a steep decline of 18%.\n\nKey findings\n\nThe crisis has affected the economy unevenly. The hardest-hit sectors (tourism and hospitality, airlines, retail, aerospace, oil and gas) are also the most difficult to rebuild. Certain groups of businesses have been hit harder, women- and minority-owned businesses in particular. The recovery will also be uneven and will take time. GDP is not expected to return to its pre-pandemic level before 2022, or even 2024 in some sectors.\n\nIn the meantime, the recovery will depend on effectively managing public health risks and our ability to counter the next waves of the pandemic until a vaccine is developed and administered.\n\nSeveral recent announcements align with the Council's vision, including changes in the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (formerly the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance) and the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (transitioned to Employment Insurance). The shock of the pandemic will bring new global priorities, and Canada must prepare for them.\n\nThree-phase action plan and five recommendations\n\nThe Council is proposing an ambitious and transformative three-phase action plan: Restart, Recover, Reimagine. These phases are interconnected and are presented as a response continuum that enables us to deal with the emergency, rebuild our strengths and look to the future to bring long-term prosperity for all Canadians.\n\nGiven our current context these need to be implemented alongside other key areas of investment, namely in the Health/Bio-sciences sector.\n\nRestart\n\nRestore confidence among Canadians by continuing employment and income assistance and managing health risks so that we can safely restart business to the greatest extent possible. Canadian business and consumer confidence remains lower than pre-COVID-19 levels, which is itself a barrier to the recovery. The pandemic has created a new normal that we must learn to live with until a vaccine is developed and administered. The Government must seek to bolster Canadian business and consumer confidence.\n\nStabilize the hardest-hit sectors and provide assistance that meets the needs of the various sectors to preserve hundreds of thousands of jobs and thousands of businesses. The Council is convinced that the investment required to protect the hardest-hit sectors is considerably less than the financial and human costs impacting the economic and social fabric of entire regions and sectors in Canada.\n\nRecover\n\nBy protecting the country's economic and social fabric, Canada is positioning itself for recovery. It will take some work, since every country in the world is preparing for what comes next. Canada's priorities are well known.\n\nInvest in Canada's strengths to address the weaknesses in the economy that have been exacerbated by the crisis. Over the years, a number of reports have highlighted both opportunities and some structural weaknesses in Canada's economy.\n\nThe Council is recommending that the Government streamline its programs, eliminate those that are ineffective and expand and bolster those that do work to strengthen four key factors of economic success. Canada must train and attract the best talent, strengthen its ecosystem, accelerate digitization and \"de-risk\" innovation projects. Gaps in the financing pipeline need to be addressed, while the roles of financial Crown corporations need to be adapted where necessary.\n\nMoreover, Canada must move quickly to address its physical and technological infrastructure deficit. At the same time, the Council recommends that the Government modernize regulations to make them more agile, leverage its purchasing power to strategically strengthen key sectors and provide opportunities for innovative Canadian companies, including small and medium-sized firms, to showcase homegrown know-how.\n\nThese suggestions are nothing new, but they are more relevant than ever.\n\nReimagine\n\nBy protecting its economic and social fabric and strengthening the foundations of its economy, Canada is building momentum to reimagine the way it creates wealth and the place it seeks to occupy in the world. The COVID-19 shock is accelerating certain trends and triggering new global geopolitics. Numerous opportunities will emerge, but competition will be fierce. Canada must build on its core strengths and set new ambitions.\n\nDevelop a made-in-Canada industrial strategy to ensure that our leading industries will help Canadians prosper in the new post-COVID-19 world. The Council recommends that the Government develop an ambitious industrial strategy that brings together all of the country's leaders in new partnerships. The Council believes that the severity of the crisis, which has affected all regions, sectors and communities, calls for a multi-level, coordinated response.\n\nAround the world, many countries, including France, Germany, and South Korea, as well as the European Union are preparing large-scale strategies for how they will thrive in a new world. Canada cannot lag and tackle this unprecedented crisis with conventional approaches.\n\nAn ambitious industrial strategy for Canada should include four main pillars:\n\nPillar 1: Become a digital and data-driven economy\n\nPillar 2: Be the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) world leader in resources, clean energy, and clean technology\n\nPillar 3: Build innovative and high-value manufacturing where we can lead globally\n\nPillar 4: Leverage our agri-food advantage to feed the planet\n\nThis industrial strategy would pull virtually all economic sectors into its orbit and could pave the way for a generation of prosperity across Canada in a renewed leadership position globally. The new industrial strategy should also establish renewed private sector partnerships and investments anchored in a sound and rigorous fiscal framework.\n\nImplementing this action plan will require cooperation.\n\nUse the challenge posed by the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to build solidarity and create new partnerships between the public and private sectors (to leverage investments) and between governments within the federation to pool our strengths, while respecting the jurisdiction of all parties.\n\nPromising economic impacts\n\nOur analysis suggests that with public and private investments in our Restart, Recover, Reimagine approach, Canada's rebound could be strong.\n\nAccording to the Council's high-level and preliminary estimates, $110 to $140B of private capital by 2030, combined with $105 to $145B of public investment, could result in additional long-term annual GDP growth of 0.8% to 1.1% by 2030 and beyond.\n\nThe Restart and Recover components of our plan have the potential to add $100 to $155B to our GDP by 2030\n\nThe Reimagine component, i.e., the new industrial strategy, could add $235 to $310B to our GDP in 2030\n\nThis comprehensive action plan will have to be based on a solid and rigorous financial framework with appropriate parameters to reassure Canadians and markets of the Government's plan for long-run fiscal discipline. This plan embodies both an ambition and an attitude. In short, it is a way of acting.\n\nAn implementation mechanism\n\nThis three-phase plan, which is focused on investment and growth, and defined by clear ambition, will bring about profound changes. Implementing it will require broad support and close cooperation. This work will have to be carried out within an implementation mechanism that will monitor the progress of the projects, follow up on the rollout of investments and adapt actions as necessary, based on feedback from the field. The Council and the Economic Strategy Tables could be the focal point for implementing the plan.\n\nInspiring ESG principles\n\nOur plan embodies values and principles of action. We believe in the role of Government as a strategic economic player, and we believe in the role of business as an active and involved member of the community. This notion of shared responsibility is reflected in companies' commitment to ESG principles, which call for them to act ethically with regard to environmental, social and governance issues. We want Canadian companies to be known for their ethical awareness and their values. This ethical stance should inform the way we do business and create wealth in Canada for the benefit of all Canadians.\n\nAccelerating digital transformation\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated a digital transformation that was already underway. We need to invest now to build world-leading companies and to inspire traditional sectors to become digitally transformed.\n\nBuilding prosperity for all\n\nCanada is an exceptional country. The members of the Council are convinced that Canada has the resources, talent, knowledge and ingenuity to succeed in the post-COVID-19 world. This crisis must bring us together and mobilize us so we can build prosperity and leadership in this new world.\n\n1. An unprecedented time for Canada's economy\n\nCOVID-19 prompted a national response\n\nThe pandemic has had a devastating impact on our day-to-day life, our health and our communities. Canadians were asked to stay home, and many non-essential businesses were required to close. Governments at all levels implemented physical distancing measures which required many businesses to reduce operations, close, and/or transition their business online. It prompted a necessary, and costly, response. Industry and government responded together to the public health challenge in a wartime fashion. To cushion the blow for Canadians and industry, the Government of Canada rolled out essential financial aid programs and liquidity support at unprecedented speed.\n\nHowever, these response measures, coupled with the severe deterioration in the economic outlook, have been costly. In the spring of 2020, Canada's real GDP faced the largest and most sudden economic contraction since quarterly data were first recorded in 1961—down by 18% compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. The country is projecting a deficit of $343.2B in 2020–2021, well above pre-pandemic projections of $34.4B. Total debt to GDP is forecasted to rise to 48% in 2021–2022, up from 31% in 2019–2020.Footnote 1\n\nPre-pandemic: Canada was in a position of strength but facing some challenges\n\nWe are an incredible country with exceptional strengths. Canada's economic prosperity is built on strong and active sectors, global connections, deep roots in research and cutting-edge technological capabilities and rich natural resource endowments.\n\nOver the years, Canada's economy has proven its resilience in the face of uncertainty. Since the 2009 recession, Canada's economic growth rate was among the highest of G7 economiesFootnote 3 and had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio. With almost a million new jobs created since 2015, the national unemployment rate fell to a record low of 5.5%.Footnote 4 This, combined with the highest wage growth in more than a decade (4.5%),Footnote 5 helped bring the poverty rate to its lowest level (9.5%) in 2019.Footnote 6\n\nHowever, as a result of COVID-19 and the global response that it prompted, we find ourselves having to accept a new normal, both in Canada and abroad. The pandemic came at a time when change was already upon us: it changed geo-political dynamics, digitization, and climate change, and has accelerated socio-economic trends—a rising inequality, shifting consumer demands, and disruptions to our trade and supply. Even throughout the term of our discussions, our meetings took place against a backdrop of added societal upheaval and a revolutionary movement to combat systemic racism and inequality. This context demands deeper consideration and must influence our actions.\n\nCanada's economic outlook remains uncertain\n\nTo better understand COVID-19's impact on our economy and our future, we conducted scenario-based modelling. This factored in potential public health and economic conditions, as well as deep sectoral analysis across the nine sectors represented by the Council. These include the six high-growth sectors covered by the original Economic Strategy Tables and the Tourism and Hospitality, Retail, and Transportation sectors, which have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.\n\nWe considered nine different scenarios ranging from broad failure of public health interventions to rapid and effective control of the virus, as well as the knock-on effects and economic policy responses. The results show that our most likely economic outlook will entail localized virus resurgence and slow long-term growth. Until a safe and effective vaccine is broadly available to Canadians, there will be no return to what we once knew as normal. Globally, and in Canada, we are seeing unprecedented efforts and cooperation to develop a vaccine, though there is significant uncertainty about its timing and availability.\n\nFigure 1: Modeling of economic scenarios\n\n(2020, % shows scenario that executive believe are most likely)\n\nSector recovery will be uneven\n\nEconomic recovery is expected to be uneven across sectors and demographic groups, and it is expected to come in waves. If we look to GDP as an indicator, a return to pre-COVID-19 levels is unlikely before 2022. COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on sectors partly due to the impact of containment measures and the adaptability of their business operations.\n\nAs businesses started to reopen over the summer months, the economy showed some signs of recovery. Certain sectors started to bridge the gap, while others remained heavily impacted. The service industries have been among the most resilient during previous economic disruptions, but this pandemic has hit them the hardest. Sectors such as tourism and hospitality, aerospace and air transportation, and oil and gas have endured the most negative impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. Without a strong recovery in our resources sector, Canada's economic recovery will be impaired. In addition, while retail has shown signs of recovery, it was also heavily affected by containment measures and remains highly sensitive should there be further implementation of such measures.\n\nThe economic impact we have seen in these sectors has been—and remains—greater than that of the 2009 recession. People, investments, and technology have been critically affected. We are seeing knock-on effects across industries, with negative multiplier effects on GDP. Not all parts of the economy will re-emerge the same as they were before the pandemic and opinions about the pace of recovery vary across industries. The further out we look, the greater the uncertainty that lies ahead.\n\nFigure 2: GDP impacts for hardest-hit sectors\n\n(June 2020, year-over-year % change)\n\nCanadian populations are being left behind\n\nWomen, youth, Indigenous peoples and new Canadians were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. They are overrepresented in the retail and tourism sectors, which were among the most severely hit. Limited telework capacity and ability to work remotely in these sectors has restricted options for ongoing labour activity. School and daycare closures have also put increased childcare burdens on parents, but more so on women, negatively impacting their participation in the workforce. Indigenous-owned businesses have also been disproportionately affected. This reality reminds us that actions taken to Restart, Recover and Reimagine our economy must be inclusive, providing opportunities for all Canadians to thrive in this new normal.\n\nWe would love for Canada to accept this country isn't built yet and there is still structural infrastructure missing to ensure all Canadians have access to health care, education, air service, economic development opportunities and digital connectivity. Money always seems to be readily available, but we can't get the projects done.\n\nPresident, National Indigenous Association\n\nFigure 3: Impact of COVID-19 by demographic groups\n\n(March – August 2020, % of individuals unemployed or working less than half of their usual hours, 2020, relative to same month in 2019)\n\nFigure 4: Self-reported employment and financial impact of COVID-19 on Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants\n\n(May 26–June 8, 2020, % of respondents)\n\n2. Reimagining Canada's future\n\nA vision for a digital, sustainable and innovative economy\n\nCanada has the opportunity to build back better with a stronger economy and a faster rate of growth than we saw before the onset of COVID-19. We see this crisis as an opportunity to reimagine our position on the global stage as an innovation leader, but we need to move quickly. Both the private sector and governments are ready to act. Our recovery will require a concerted action in building toward a shared vision for Canada. Together, as members of the Industry Strategy Council, we drew heavily on the experience and insights of a broad range of stakeholders to shape this vision.\n\nThe Council undertook a rigorous consultation process, engaging stakeholders from across Canada. We sought perspectives about national and regional impacts of COVID-19 on individual sectors; the impact of government support programs (what has worked, what has not, and where the unfulfilled gaps are); and forward-looking plans for resuming commercial operations in the short and medium term.\n\nWe heard that Canadian businesses have each experienced this pandemic differently. However, regardless of the impact, there is strong consensus that now is the time to recover from setbacks, limit the further deterioration of our hardest-hit sectors and boost investment in areas where we can benefit from accelerated growth.\n\nMore precisely, our efforts need to focus, not just on recovering from the devastating economic impact of the pandemic, but on a future for Canada where we are Building a Digital, Sustainable and Innovative Economy for all Canadians. In particular, one that is stronger than our pre-COVID-19 economy.\n\nIt is time to increase our competitiveness, innovation and productivity by investing in foundational areas that will build synergies across economic sectors. Take our digital footprint and investments in e-commerce and information and communications technology (ICT), for example. We need to be further ahead than we are now. We believe that investments in value-added manufacturing and processing, sustainable clean technologies, and digital connectivity are key to ensuring prosperity and jobs, all while enhancing the overall performance of the Canadian economy. Our rich natural resource endowments allow us to be the global ESG leader in resources, while exploring new opportunities for cleaner products (e.g., raw materials to support electric propulsion) with new clean technologies.\n\nAcross our sectors, we need to attract and incentivize investment, to equip people with the knowledge they need for new and value-added jobs, to leverage our trade relationships in newly reshaped supply chains, and to ensure an enabling environment for action and innovation. Our success will result in a Canada that is more resilient and self-sufficient, creating more domestic and global champions, and increased wealth for Canadians.\n\nWe cannot do this without working with the public sector on policies that maximize the benefits for the economy, and without a robust industrial strategy with a long-term action plan for the country. Our economic game plan charts a path for how to accomplish this— one that is bold, ambitious and actionable.\n\nAs we worked to set out a new future for Canada, we developed a set of key principles to guide our work. Our recommendations set a foundation for Canadian leadership, but there is more work we can do to pivot Canadian strengths into economic engines for growth. (See next page for principles, strengths, challenges and key global trends).\n\nThe Council recognizes that these principles are not all-encompassing. There are other areas of important work.\n\nGiven our current context, these actions need to be implemented alongside other key areas of investment, namely in health care and the related bio-sciences sector. The importance of these sectors has never been more critical as we continue to prioritize the health and safety of Canadians in confronting the pandemic. Intrinsic to these sectors are innovation activities, which are key to growing the intangibles economy (e.g., discoveries and related patents). We can pivot health care, our single biggest investment, and the strengths of Canadian bio-sciences into an economic engine.\n\nIf we nurture a \"Team Canada\" mindset and apply our strengths to the world's challenges, we will create a larger global footprint for Canadian ingenuity and increase our prosperity in the process.\n\nConsultations, dialogue and surveys\n\nOur engagement process included nearly 100 consultations, representing more than 1,000 businesses, business associations, academic institutions, labour groups, Indigenous organizations, community organizations and youth groups. We held continuous discussions with thought leaders who are deeply engaged in Canada's economy; one-on-one discussions with leaders from Canada's banks, financial institutions, academia and industry; and extensive engagement with industry groups and associations (national and regional/sector specific) representing the broader economic interests of Canadians. We also received more than 100 written submissions to the Chair directly or via Departmental channels, including the Council's website; and we conducted a survey with around 700 SMEs across sectors, provinces and territories.\n\nThe Council's recommendations are guided by key global trends, strengths and challenges unique to Canada and guiding principles\n\nKey themes and recommendations\n\n3. An economic game plan for Canadians to rise together\n\nStemming from our consultations and our own deliberations over the past four months, the Council has identified five key areas for action to guide Canada in building a digital, sustainable and innovative economy. To guide our recommendations, we developed a framework to help Restart, Recover and Reimagine Canada's economy for long-term success.\n\nA framework for action and guiding principles\n\nIn Restart, we must be mindful of safely restoring Canadian confidence and commerce by increasing predictability and stability as we navigate through this pandemic. As we Recover, we can set a trajectory of inclusive growth by doubling down on a future-oriented investment plan. With those actions taken, we will be well positioned to head to a Reimagined future economy that catalyzes GDP growth, even beyond pre-COVID-19 levels, through an industrial strategy that supports innovation and sustainability. Along the way, the basis for successful implementation of this ambitious plan will be modernizing our public–private sector partnerships and maximizing our investments.\n\nThe Council has identified two key recommendation areas that it believes will be central to supporting our Restart phase. These recommendations seek to address the immediate and pressing issues resulting from COVID-19.\n\nFigure 5: Summary of recommendations\n\nRestart: Safely restore confidence and commerce\n\nAs part of the path to Restart the economy, the Council proposes a two-tiered approach to address immediate and pressing challenges arising from COVID-19: restoring Canadian confidence and stabilizing the hardest-hit sectors. We begin by addressing the first.\n\nRecommendation A: Boost the confidence of Canadian businesses and consumers to navigate the new normal and adjust the economic response plan to better support a safe reopening of the economy\n\nCanada must be relentless and aggressive in combatting a resurgence of COVID-19, and equally driven in our collective efforts to Restart and Reimagine our economy. A key component to restarting economic activity is building up Canadian consumer confidence. Canadians must feel confident in the effectiveness of public health measures as they look to return to the workplace and to the activities that help drive the consumer economy. Leading economists have identified prolonged uncertainty as one of the most dangerous impediments to economic recovery. Measures that can increase predictability are among the most powerful policy tools to enable stable recovery with no setbacks.\n\nCanadian consumers have made it clear that the types of safety precautions and protective measures in place are critical to their willingness to resume pre-COVID-19 consumer behaviour. The messaging on safe consumer activities becomes less clear with each rollback of economic reopening. Getting this right early matters.\n\nBy adopting a clear risk-based framework across Canada, Canadians can feel better equipped with the information to understand the risks. We must lean in on education and help Canadian business and communities put in place safe protocols to tackle COVID-19 in our workplaces and regions.\n\nConsumer confidence fell dramatically in April following the COVID-19 shutdowns. While July saw a significant increase, which has been maintained in recent months, indicators are still below pre-COVID-19 levels and concerns are increasing about a resurgence now and into the winter. The effort to rebuild Canadians' confidence can be enhanced and accelerated if industry and government move in lockstep to carefully manage risk.\n\nOur consultations with business leaders have emphasized the need for a cohesive action plan that provides a safe path forward into the next stage of recovery. There is widespread appreciation among stakeholders for how quickly the government responded. We have seen that there are ways to adapt to the new reality, working closely with the provinces and territories in getting Canadians back to work and allowing Canadian business activity to safely resume with appropriate public health measures in place to ensure that virus transmission remains manageable.\n\nHealth messaging often blames restaurants; however, this is unwarranted. Restaurants have some of the strictest health measures in place (contact tracing, distancing, etc.— more than other sectors of the economy), and there is very little data to suggest people are being exposed to danger at restaurants.\n\nAssociation of Hospitality Sector Leaders\n\nTesting and contact tracing capacity need to be increased to contain localized resurgences of the virus. To date, most of the testing has been coordinated and carried out through health care systems and points-of-care. Engaging with the private sector can expand the opportunities for test deployment and increase capacity. Doing so will allow us to increase our efforts to reduce the risk of transmission while accelerating economic activity. This can be done through increased and coordinated testing between the health system and industry to reduce the risk to workers.\n\nBusinesses can support a risk management framework and directly contribute to confidence-building. For example, rapid testing by airlines could reduce our reliance on quarantining as the predominant method of limiting contagion. Governments should also continue to focus on rolling out the national COVID-19 Alert app to ensure that Canadians' can get the information they need to make better decisions and protect themselves. As of October 14, 2020, over 4.38 million Canadians had downloaded the app;Footnote 9 we need to strive for millions more and ensure it is available in all provinces and territories.\n\nAs consumer confidence improves with containment measures and better communications, boosting the business confidence of firms is also important. Businesses need to see a positive outlook that will influence their desire to invest. Ensuring that businesses have the right kind of support and at the right stages is crucial to emerging from this pandemic in a strong position. This is about more than financial support; it is also about strengthening the sense of engagement Canadians have already displayed to support local businesses.\n\nA final component of boosting confidence is a focus on workers. Canadians will find themselves having to seek new work, change jobs or adapt to new workplace operations. To adapt, they will need different forms of supports, including upskilling and access to training that will better position them in the job market and/or in their jobs. There is more on this in Recommendation C.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified specific actions to increase confidence and set the stage for a strong, foundational restart, some of which the Government has already committed to in its Speech from the Throne.\n\nFigure 6: Canada Consumer Confidence Index\n\n(August 2019–September 2020, Index = 0-100)\n\nTaking action:\n\nFurther strengthen coordination and best practices with the provinces and territories and advance a risk management approach, recognizing that COVID-19 will be with us for some time (e.g., a coordinated approach to reopen borders based on sound risk management principles, launching pilot projects to test innovative approaches to risk management).\n\nFully engage the private sector to ensure public health measures and innovation are in place to support a safe restart (e.g., partner with industry consortia to increase viral testing capacity and decrease time to results, expand contact tracing to accelerate economic activity and eventually roll out vaccination at scale).\n\nDevelop, in collaboration with Canadian financial institutions and federal financial Crown corporations, mechanisms to facilitate restructuring and refinancing for otherwise profitable firms that face extended recovery periods, allowing business to emerge with more sustainable business models.\n\nFurther encourage workforce participation and smarter reskilling as emergency programs are phased out, building on recently announced changes (e.g., complement the transition from CERB to EI with innovation skills programming to reskill disrupted workers—women and racialized Canadians in particular—and revisit structure of EI training model).\n\nLeverage and promote the \"Canada\" brand domestically and internationally, emphasizing value addition and innovation (e.g., encourage local spending and support for local businesses, launch public health messaging campaigns abroad to instill confidence in potential international students).\n\nRecommendation B: Stabilize and secure the hardest-hit sectors through targeted measures\n\nThe broad-based measures rolled out by Government early in the pandemic were instrumental in restarting key sectors across the economy. Although the pandemic affected the Canadian economy in its entirety, certain industry sectors were particularly disrupted. Detailed sectoral analysis of COVID-19's impact in all nine sectors represented by the Industry Strategy Council is included in our Feature Section: Deep Sector Insights. Going forward, targeted action is urgently needed to support the hardest hit sectors of the Canadian economy— airlines, airports and aerospace, resources of the future (particularly oil and gas), and tourism, hospitality, and culture. Timely and flexible support to these sectors will help stabilize them, prevent long-lasting impacts and position them for eventual recovery.\n\nAirlines, airports, and aerospace\n\nCanada's air sector is critical to building our nation and connecting our communities given our country's vast geographical size. Over 130 remote communities rely entirely on air transport to receive essential goods and services, including food and health care.Footnote 14 Air travel is also critical for business competitiveness. A functioning air transportation sector is vital for sectors as diverse as tourism and hospitality, professional services, mining, fishing and manufacturing. Prior to COVID-19, the air transportation sector was healthy and doing well. However, the pandemic has led to a sharp decline in air travel with the closing of borders and new travel protocols. Although some level of domestic air travel has continued, traffic in August 2020 was down by an average 66% when compared to 2019 levels.Footnote 15\n\nThe catastrophic drop in air travel worldwide has created ripple effects on Canadian airports and the country's aerospace sector. Aviation and aerospace are highly inter-reliant as travellers affect aviation demand, which in turn drives demand for aerospace products and services. Both are in urgent need of targeted assistance to avoid collapse, especially in Canada, where our aviation industry relies on one of the few user-pay systems in the world. The current situation is placing the entire system at risk. Despite cost-reduction efforts that have involved mass shut-downs and lay-offs, many airports and air carriers have reported an inability to meet financial obligations.\n\nAir travel will be heavily dependent on the reopening of borders and enhanced consumer willingness to travel. Some efforts are already underway to restore travellers' confidence and ensure safety with new approaches to maintain physical distancing on planes. We heard from airports that have already made significant investments in health and sanitation, including autonomous floor cleaners, disinfectant tunnels for luggage, air quality monitoring stations, and digital platforms to monitor disease risks. Further investment in the adoption of digital technology and testing/screening systems for airports can help control the spread of COVID-19 and prepare facilities for future infectious diseases while increasing traffic.\n\nWith growing recognition of the need for government involvement and industrial strategy to support aviation and aerospace manufacturing, leading countries in the sector have taken different approaches to offer support. Many foreign governments have announced massive support and bridge financing initiatives for their air sectors. France was one of the first countries to unveil a major support package for aviation and aerospace manufacturing in the face of COVID-19.Footnote 16 Government investments will not only impact the ability of their national carriers to weather the economic impact of the pandemic, but will also shape the global competitive landscape in the air transportation industry for decades to come.\n\nAbsent decisive action, Canada's air transport system could emerge from COVID-19 in a much weaker state. Canadian air travellers could see reduced service, higher prices, diminished competition and a loss of connectivity. Higher ticket prices and reduced connectivity would place Canadian businesses that rely on air travel at a disadvantage compared to their foreign competitors. We heard from stakeholders in the sector that international air carriers that have been supported by their governments have increased their flight capacity to and from Canada, while the presence of Canadian carriers has fallen.Footnote 17 Canada's small domestic market also means that the growth prospects of top Canadian carriers are limited without an active presence in the highly competitive international markets.\n\nThe sector will also need investments in environmentally sustainable aviation and aerospace technologies to remain competitive. A mix of policy tools, including support for airlines, renewed innovation funding and procurement could reinvigorate the Canadian aerospace sector and supply chain. Canada boasts a diverse base of manufacturing firms in the industry. The Government could help position the Canadian aerospace sector for future long-term growth by investing in sustainable aviation and technology areas, such as hybrid electric propulsion and advanced biofuels.\n\nCanadian carriers are losing their competitive footing\n\nInternal analysis shared by an industry organization during the Council's consultations suggested that the share of international flight capacity to/from Canada for international carriers who received sector-specific state support grew from 4% in 2019 to 55% in 2020, while Canadian carriers fell by 20% over the same period.\n\nTaking action:\n\nProvide longer-term support (e.g., until return to pre-COVID-19 levels of activity) to allow firms that are particularly impacted or of national strategic interest to meet fixed costs and allow for greening of fleets in line with other competitive jurisdictions (complementary and/or in replacement of existing programs).\n\nAccelerate Restart of domestic and international travel by adopting innovative ways to manage risks and rebuild confidence (e.g., rapid testing for international visitors from low-risk jurisdictions with significantly reduced quarantine times).\n\nResources of the future\n\nThe resources of the future include forestry, mining and oil and gas—natural endowments that add to the richness of our country. These industries represent a key pillar of our current economy, as well as an immense growth opportunity. As we focus on addressing the impacts of COVID-19, we have an opportunity to take actions to ensure that the full potential of these sectors can be leveraged to benefit the Canadian economy now and in the future. This is why we have proposed actions to tackle immediate challenges facing the sectors and have proposed further actions toward reimagining our economy.\n\nOf Canada's resources of the future, oil and gas have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19. This sub-sector, which is responsible for 11% of GDP (excluding impacts of capital investment), was already facing issues related to reduced investor confidence in Canada prior to the onset of the pandemic. While investment in upstream oil and gas activities (e.g., exploring, drilling, extraction) had been increasing globally, it was declining in Canada. The pandemic exacerbated investment declines. Oil producers responded to the current situation by cutting capital spending budgets, including for green house gas (GHG) reducing projects, cancelling future investment, project development, curtailing production, and shutting down facilities. Oil and gas job losses are expected to be high and to continue to 2021.Footnote 26 This is expected to impact the broader economy as the sector has the highest multiplier effect on broader employment.Footnote 27\n\nOil and gas is the largest contributor to Canada's trade.Footnote 28 Given this, recovery in the sector is a crucial component of the nation's overall economic recovery. Government liquidity and credit measures will be required to help the sector survive and stabilize in the short term. It will also need support for the sustainable transformation required for the industry's long-term viability and global competitiveness. Prior to COVID-19, the sector was positioned to play a critical role in the transition to a low-carbon energy future both through R&D in low-carbon solutions, and by providing significant revenues to the Government for reinvestment in the transition towards net-zero emission targets. According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the oil and gas sector accounts for 75% of all clean technology investment in Canada.Footnote 29\n\nRecovery in the sector will depend on the industry's ability to de-risk and incentivize capital investments to generate activity, which has a ripple effect on other Canadian industries. This means providing incentives to reignite spending for large scale projects that stimulate growth, reduce GHG emissions and lay the groundwork for energy and resource efforts. These projects include sustaining production, diversification into petrochemicals, hydrogen, liquified natural gas (LNG), and environmental technologies (e.g., carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)).\n\nThe sector will also require liquidity support until activity resumes. This is especially important for some, like oilfield service firms, who may be unable to access existing support due to lower revenue profiles and high debt levels. Other recovery factors for oil and gas include the continuity of supply chains, market access, agile and effective regulations, global competitiveness and investment, and adoption of innovations to drive environmental performance.\n\nTaking action:\n\nProvide additional incentives for upstream operators to sustain long-term viable operations and to reignite their capital expenditures with consideration to long-term ESG/resource objectives and ensure existing business credit programs provide bridge funding to long-term viable producers and service operators until investments resume.\n\nTourism, hospitality, and culture\n\nThe tourism sector was performing well pre-pandemic with three consecutive years of record-breaking growth and high expectations for 2020.Footnote 31 The pandemic immediately affected businesses of all sizes in this sector due to the closure of borders to non-essential travel and a steep decline in air transit. Public health restrictions also limited options for large gatherings. The summer season, representing 60% of annual tourism revenues was mostly lost, paralyzing operators, businesses, hotels and festivals across the country. As a result, 80% of businesses in the sector are considered at risk.Footnote 32\n\nWhile some local and domestic consumer spending is expected to return as the economy reopens, continued restrictions on travel and large gatherings are anticipated to impact short-term revenue and employment. Some of these firms may be successful in transitioning to new operating models (e.g., online sales, increased proportion of local clientele). However, extended restrictions and resurgences of COVID-19 will pose ongoing challenges for most firms, particularly those that are heavily dependent on seasonal travellers and large in-person gatherings for revenue, or those that offer niche products or services that cannot be delivered through alternative mechanisms.\n\nGiven this trajectory, at-risk businesses will need to have supports for restructuring and transformational changes. While the Government has set up broad-based programs of general application that have provided some support to the sector (e.g., the Canada Emergency Business Account loan, Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy and payment deferrals for commercial leases and operating licences in national parks, historic sites and marine conservation areas), these general programs alone will not be sufficient. Tourism-dependent local economies and regional and community tourism/hospitality anchors would also benefit from upticks in domestic travel and efforts to encourage activity in these communities.\n\nA tough year and a long road ahead\n\nBusinesses in the tourism industry, and other sectoral SMEs alike, noted the struggle of keeping their doors open. They spoke to the challenge that the CERB presents; the CEWS being a good program but needing to be extended to address ongoing financial costs; and the rent program not being accessible due to the eligibility issues and the involvement of landlords. Given the urgency of necessary support, these views were shared as the Council conducted its work.\n\nRecent announcements made by the government, highlight some of the changes made to improve these supports—CERB transition to EI, CEWS being extended, and changes to the rent program (now Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy).\n\nOf course, the tourism industry is uniquely affected during COVID-19, which is why we have noted the need for more immediate attention to bridge to recovery.\n\nTaking action:\n\nProvide patient capital to allow anchor firms with high brand-value and long-term business models (who have challenges accessing capital) to weather subdued demand and overcapacity in the medium term, particularly where smaller communities are disproportionately impacted.\n\nCollaborate with the private sector to ensure sufficient restructuring and transformation funding is available—crowding in private capital at attractive rates and ensuring that entrepreneurs have the opportunity to transform their businesses in the wake of COVID-19.\n\nRecover: Set a trajectory of inclusive growth\n\nAs part of the Recover stage, we see an opportunity to tackle pre-existing challenges laid bare by the pandemic. While these challenges are not new, they are pressing for Canada's growth now ever more. As part of its work, the Council considered many of the recommendations previously put forward to the Government, as well as existing federal programming currently in place to support industrial growth. Through building on these efforts, we see significant potential to accelerate our recovery.\n\nRecommendation C: Reignite growth by doubling down on a future-oriented investment plan\n\nCanada can unlock its potential and build a digital, sustainable and innovative economy by investing strategically and significantly in core foundations that benefit the economy as a whole. Key to Canada's competitiveness and future growth is our talent, technology and trade as well as an enabling environment that promotes innovation and ingenuity.\n\nAs such, we propose the following sector-agnostic measures: upskilling the workforce; driving innovation, commercialization, digitization and intellectual property (IP); improving access to capital so high growth firms can achieve scale; investing in strategic trade infrastructure for efficient global market access; investing in digital infrastructure, including high-speed Internet for rural small to medium enterprises (SMEs); eliminating regulatory barriers to unlock economic growth and investment; and leveraging procurement as a powerful tool to create demand and support priority areas.\n\nThese themes emerged in all our conversations with industry leaders about Canada's path to recovery and long-term growth. They are understood to be mutually reinforcing and interdependent and are essential to drive recovery and reignite growth. Previous private sector councils, mandated by the federal government, have also made recommendations related to these cross-cutting themes. Therefore, efforts already underway can be leveraged. Our consultations have also underlined the significance of doubling down on these horizontal themes.\n\nDiversity, talent, and workforce innovation\n\nDuring our engagement sessions with employers, unions and universities, it was clear that the pandemic has accelerated some employment trends and has led to a new set of workforce challenges. While some businesses struggle to keep workers employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, others are still working to fill vacancies and/or develop new skills within their workforce, as a result of adaptations such as changing business models and technology adoption.\n\nThis accelerated pace of change has made it clear that Canadians need opportunities to continuously access the latest training in support of new skills demands. To facilitate this, it would be beneficial to compare workers' current skill sets to the skill sets required for jobs in sectors with higher demand. Reskilling programs could then be targeted to providing the required skill sets. Where there are limits to what reskilling and training can achieve, positions may need to be filled through recruitment of global talent.\n\nSectoral crosswalk: Talent/skills strategy\n\nCOVID-19 has forever changed our view of \"essential workers\". Transit operators, grocery store cashiers, retail clerks, truck drivers, farmers and many others, joined health care workers and first responders on the front line to keep our economy moving and to keep Canadians safe. Despite a few noted and unique distinctions, the need for a cross-cutting talent and skills strategy and an economy-wide labour market response was identified across all sectors. The pace of change has highlighted the continued importance of bringing international talent to Canada, exacerbated current talent and labour gaps and has reinforced the need for reskilling and upskilling to meet demands in high-growth sectors.\n\nDiversity\n\nThe Council was also cautioned about the growing social inequities and disproportionate impact that the pandemic is having on underrepresented groups (e.g., women, youth, new Canadians and Indigenous peoples). Given that our hardest-hit sectors employ these groups disproportionately (e.g., youth in tourism and service sectors), a slower recovery could leave underrepresented groups even further behind. For example, COVID-19 saw women's participation in the workforce drop to 55% in April, for the first time in over 30 years, threatening to wipe out decades of progress on gender equality.Footnote 37 Although this has improved since April, women, youth and new Canadians are still lagging in their employment.\n\nFor Canada's recovery to be inclusive, we need to improve the potential for all workers to participate in the economy. Inclusiveness is not only a good thing for workers; it helps employers thrive. Ethnic and gender diversity are correlated with profitability, yet women and visible minorities remain underrepresented.Footnote 38 Going forward, Canada's workforce innovation strategy must place a strong focus on closing these gaps, and redeploy displaced and underemployed Canadians into industrial areas with strong growth trajectories and high demand for talent. By removing barriers and advancing gender equality in work, Canada could see an additional $150B in incremental GDP in 2026.Footnote 39\n\nSectoral crosswalk: Inclusive economic growth\n\nCOVID-19 has had a significant adverse impact on Indigenous businesses and communities. The pandemic has reinforced gaps in food security, health care, air service to remote areas, and digital connectivity. The resources and tourism and hospitality sectors are among the largest private sector employers of Indigenous peoples in Canada, and both have been hard-hit by COVID-19. Stronger partnerships with clean technology, digital, and health/bio-sciences and associated investments will drive economic development and public health outcomes.\n\nWorkforce innovation\n\nBroader access to training and opportunities for employment in high-demand areas is one important approach to facilitating redeployment. Yet despite significant improvements in recent years, Canada continues to lag behind other OECD countries in upskilling its existing workforce. For example, Canadian organizations spend an average of 81 cents for every dollar spent by American organizations on learning and development.Footnote 40 In addition, the Advisory Council on Economic Growth indicated that the average amount an organization spent on investments in worker training fell by more than 40% between 1990 and 2010.Footnote 41 Additional training can provide employees with skills to build and scale the companies of the future, for example in the clean technology sector.\n\nHistorically, the largest training interventions have been implemented by provinces and territories, enabled in part by federal transfer programs. Federal leadership, in close partnership with provinces and territories and with industry, could help achieve improved coordination in the delivery of reskilling and employment opportunities that align with industry needs while meeting shared provincial and national priorities. Collaboration must also lead to smarter training infrastructure and digital learning models that make navigating career pathways and talent pipelines easier for employers and employees.\n\nLabour market programming must provide Canadians the necessary support; however, it must also support and garner input from employers. When skills development measures are not developed in collaboration with employers, there is a risk that training solutions will not match their needs. Working closely with industry and demonstrating federal leadership will decrease this risk. Additionally, knowing that training is relevant to employers gives workers the confidence that investments in their own training will pay off and position them for good quality job opportunities.\n\nGlobal talent\n\nFinally, firms still struggling to access the talent required to support their growth spoke to the ongoing importance of bringing international talent to Canada. Canada tripled its international student population over the last decadeFootnote 42 and, prior to COVID-19, ranked third in international student attraction.Footnote 43 Our consultations highlighted the benefits of international students studying in Canadian post-secondary institutions, as well as the ongoing importance of onboarding experienced global talent. Figures from 2018 show that the majority of these students (60%) plan to apply to become new Canadians.Footnote 44 Those that do become permanent residents often pursue employment in areas critical to Canada's innovation capacity.\n\nIn addition to implementing programs announced in the Speech from the Throne, we should continue to leverage the Global Skills Strategy and the International Student Program, to attract the best and brightest in key areas where we face shortages, like engineers, software developers and C-suite executives. While COVID-19 has created some uncertainty about the future of economic immigration, now is not the time for Canada to forego its momentum in the fierce competition for global talent. Canada should continue to capitalize on the opportunity to retain and attract highly skilled workers, especially as other nations consider or implement new measures that prevent the entry of top talent.\n\nTaking action:\n\nExpand scope and increase funding of reskilling programs in partnership with provinces and territories to drive smarter digital learning models and infrastructure for future demands (e.g., supporting upskilling and reskilling to fill labour gaps).\n\nCapitalize on the opportunity to retain and attract highly skilled global talent, particularly in digital and data areas, as other countries close/ reduce access to work permits (e.g., retain recent STEM graduates, displaced H-1B visa holders, assist job placement for accompanying spouses).\n\nDevelop a National Workforce Innovation Strategy to develop a system of lifelong learning that is aligned with commercial needs, ensuring graduates are well positioned for jobs of the future, while closing the gender gap and advancing inclusion and diversity in the workforce (e.g., skills needed for Manufacturing 4.0, internships and dual programs, micro-credentials, and flexibility with online learning).\n\nInnovation ecosystem and R&D funding\n\nCanada's business sector has long faced an innovation challenge, particularly in exploiting R&D and our ability to capture value from our intellectual property. This is consistent with our need to enhance our commercialization capacity in Canada. In recent years, the federal government has introduced a new suite of industrial tools and supports for businesses to enhance their growth and innovation capacity. Many of these are centred on a partnership approach, between government and private sector, or among stakeholders, to maximize resources and knowledge transfer, market expansion and commercialization.\n\nIn speaking with Canadian businesses, we heard about the success of many of these programs, as signaled by their over subscription in several regions of the country, prompting calls to expand programs such as the National Research Council's Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP). In other cases, we heard specific limitations and gaps in the existing programs that can be amended to better support innovation. For example, there were requests to remove existing employment caps, which prevent some medium-to-large-sized businesses from participating in programs such as IRAP.\n\nMore generally, businesses are also looking for more flexible support to enhance investments in areas such as intellectual property, digitization, and technology adoption. Existing programming could be reviewed, where necessary, to encourage and incentivize Canadian businesses to invest in the \"intangibles\", which have the potential to generate better long-term value (e.g., in R&D, data and computing, digital services and operations, new designs and brands, and in workforce upskilling). Incentives for investments in these areas can be integrated into the existing suite of innovation programs, particularly as work advances on Canada's Intellectual Property Strategy and Digital Charter.\n\nFederal programs provide early support to firms\n\nThe government offers early support to firms at the pre-commercialization stages via the National Research Council's Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP); support for companies to scale up via the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), the Accelerated Growth Service and the Trade Commissioner Service; and additional funding and knowledge transfer driven by the Strategic Innovation Fund and the Innovation Superclusters Initiative, and the large-scale partnerships that they support.\n\nCanada's innovation performance: An age-old tale\n\nOn the Conference Board of Canada's last Innovation Scorecard (2018), Canada fell from 9th to 12th place of 16 peer countries, as a result of stronger performance by a number of international peers, as well as our decline in R&D. Canada also continues to fall significantly behind in developing and capturing value from intellectual property, ranking 17th on both the World Intellectual Property Organization's Global Innovation Index and on ICT-related patents among the OECD (down from 8th from 2000–2012). Other indices also point to Canada lagging its OECD peers in innovation areas such as adoption of robotics (20th) and e-commerce (21st).\n\nTaking action:\n\nDe-risk and encourage industries to digitize, automate, and drive productivity for SMEs and upper-middle companies (e.g., build on technology access centres; explore giving superclusters a mandate on technology adoption with increased focus on upper-middle companies; incentivize the private sector to invest in intangible assets and technology such as Manufacturing 4.0; improve digital adoption and service delivery within health care and education with an acute demand post-COVID-19; invest in software infrastructure projects).\n\nContinue to strengthen Canada's Digital Charter and IP Strategy, and build a modern digital regulatory system to better manage, safeguard—which includes added enforcement capabilities to reduce data infringement—and commercialize our assets (e.g., guidelines on drone use, IP education, IP filing costs for SR&ED-eligible Canadian companies, micro-patent pools).\n\nRecapitalize, expand, and modernize key government programs to stimulate immediate and longer-term private investments in innovation and R&D (e.g., the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC), SR&ED, incorporate technology adoption into the IRAP mandate).\n\nAccess to capital to accelerate growth of Canadian firms\n\nTo support businesses facing more protracted and slow recoveries, the federal government responded in record speed with unprecedented liquidity and capital supports (e.g., Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA), Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF)). In its Speech from the Throne, the Government has committed to continuing the CEBA program and improving the Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP).\n\nThroughout the pandemic, these measures have been critical to the survival of Canada's hardest-hit businesses. However, beyond survival, firms also need access to capital so they can invest in innovation and sustainable technologies, in new growth opportunities and in training to reskill their workers for the new digital economy.\n\nContinued access to patient capital remains important for competitive firms with strong growth trajectories. Expanding programs offered through Crown corporations—Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), Export Development Canada (EDC), and Farm Credit Canada (FCC) can help Canadian business not only survive, but also thrive in this changing environment.\n\nAccess to capital is a pre-condition to growth for all firms, regardless of size. Additional support is required to grow our high-performing SMEs and upper-middle companies that have the potential to become the next global leaders in their field. History has shown that when these companies are not able to access capital within Canada, they look to international investors. Leaders in the financial sector have suggested that leveraging private sector capital by creating patient capital growth funds, building up our venture capital industry and incenting investment in Canadian firms, and infrastructure projects will help companies scale up. Each of these measures will boost our economy's productivity and drive GDP growth and were echoed throughout our consultations. While improvements have been made in the venture capital industry, an extension of the BCAP program would allow further growth.\n\nFinally, we know that the pandemic has had disproportionate impacts on some segments of the Canadian population. It is important that support reaches businesses owned by members of underrepresented groups, who have been more negatively affected by the pandemic. For instance, 91% of Indigenous-owned businesses reported being adversely impacted by COVID-19.Footnote 48 Women entrepreneurs, who are more likely to own newer and smaller businesses, had to lay off their employees (80%+) at higher rates than male-owned businesses.Footnote 49 For inclusive recovery that works for all Canadians, dedicated funds should be established to support entrepreneurship from diverse groups.\n\nSectoral crosswalk: Access to Capital\n\nEach sector identified specific capital requirements to either stabilize, recover or grow the hardest-hit or highest-potential firms. These recommendations include, but are not limited to, targeted liquidity supports, patient capital, new financing models and the greater mobilization of private sector investment. Given the current uncertainty of the duration of COVID-19, access to capital will continue to shape our economic recovery, as well as our ability to seize new growth opportunities across all nine sectors.\n\nTaking action:\n\nConsider an expanded role for the financial Crown corporations—BDC, EDC and FCC— to support the relaunch of the economy in partnership with the private sector and in alignment with the overarching strategy to boost productivity and innovation:\n\nDirect the financial Crown corporations to move up the risk curve and to provide significant additional growth and scale-up capital to Canadian businesses.\n\nEstablish new special purpose funds to support business scale-up, including financing of the larger venture capital (VC) rounds that have proven elusive in Canada.\n\nDirect these institutions to increase support to Canada's larger and most competitive businesses to help them \"own the podium\" (e.g., R&D investment in digital product innovation, investment to adopt latest technologies).\n\nCultivate sector-specific capabilities through strategic areas aligned with key industrial strategy priorities.\n\nEnsure capital gaps (e.g., women entrepreneurship funds, Indigenous community development funds, bio-science research funds) are addressed in partnership with the private sector\n\nExpand on existing diversity-oriented growth funds to increase access to capital and stimulate inclusive growth.\n\nExpand proven partnership models on growth capital, including incentives to crowd in private capital and deepen investment expertise domestically (e.g., Venture Capital Catalyst Initiative (VCCI)).\n\nStrategic infrastructure – Digital and physical\n\nDigital infrastructure\n\nThe pandemic has underscored the importance of reliable, secure and affordable digital infrastructure, as well as the risks associated with a growing digital divide in Canada. Approximately 60% of rural communities still do not have access to reliable, high-speed Internet, leaving businesses, consumers and important service providers behind.Footnote 50 Canada has a proud history of building great infrastructure—including completing what was at the time the world's longest railway across a sparsely populated country in 1885. Now, we can enhance Canadian success in the digital economy by accelerating access to high-quality Internet for all Canadians. In its Speech from the Throne, the Government committed to improving Canadians' access to virtual health care and to using digital technologies to make government services more accessible. Investing in digital infrastructure will improve our chances of connectivity for all Canadians and better access to these services. Digital infrastructure is much bigger than broadband, and we discuss this further in Recommendation D.\n\nA $10B-infrastructure plan to create jobs and grow the economy\n\nOn October 1, 2020, the Government of Canada announced the three-year Canadian Infrastructure Bank Growth Plan, including $10B in infrastructure initiatives designed to help Canadians get back to work by creating approximately 60,000 jobs across the country. The plan will connect more Canadian households and businesses to high-speed Internet, strengthen Canadian agriculture, and help build a low carbon economy though five initiatives:\n\n$2.5B for clean power to support renewable generation and storage and to transmit clean electricity between provinces, territories, and regions, including to northern and Indigenous communities.\n\n$2B to connect approximately 750,000 homes and small businesses to broadband in underserved communities.\n\n$2B to invest in large-scale building retrofits to increase energy efficiency and help make communities more sustainable\n\n$1.5B for agriculture irrigation projects to help the agriculture sector enhance production, strengthen Canada's food security, and expand export opportunities.\n\n$1.5B to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission buses and charging infrastructure.\n\nThe plan is part of the Government's campaign, launched in the Speech from the Throne, to create over one million jobs to rebuild from the pandemic.\n\nTaking action:\n\nAccelerate plan to ensure coverage and access to high-quality Internet for 100% of Canadians by 2026, in collaboration with the private sector and other levels of government.\n\nPhysical Infrastructure\n\nDuring our conversations with Canadian business leaders, we heard about the future dividends of investing in physical infrastructure for our long-term growth. Canada could obtain higher market value for its resource endowment and be a more competitive supplier of innovative products to world markets, by strengthening our trade-enabling infrastructure. This includes our ports, railways, and world-class air hubs, which connect millions of people around the globe, move goods efficiently, and can support new jobs for Canadians, including underrepresented groups. We also heard about opportunities to expand our view on public–private partnership models and on the types of infrastructure projects that support Canada's industrial competitiveness and efforts to reduce GHG emissions, such as public transit, digital transportation networks, CCUS, and large-scale irrigation. Yet, Canada does not invest sufficiently in such strategic assets.\n\nWhile large infrastructure project commitments have been made across all transportation modes, it has been estimated that Canada has a $150B-infrastructure gap.Footnote 51 Canada ranks 20th out of 36 OECD countries on the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (2018).Footnote 52 This is an area of huge potential for Canada's recovery and reimagined future. With investments in infrastructure, we could reduce congestion, increase intermodality and improve trade flows. For example, Canada boasts access to deep water ports in three oceans, as well as the important St. Lawrence/Great Lakes corridor, which could be further leveraged with the right investments in infrastructure.\n\nTransforming the future food economy requires intermodal global trade flows for bulk commodities and infrastructure that can support surge capacities in those flows for certain products (e.g., crops). Our current infrastructure creates bottlenecks and cannot effectively support surge capacity. By strategically investing in passenger/freight infrastructure and trade corridors, Canada can better position itself to attract private sector investment and compete in the economy of the future. This is something the Government has been working to address.\n\nThe Council also heard about opportunities to further develop Canada's trade network in the energy sector. This network (e.g., east-west electricity transmission and pipelines) would allow provinces to provide ESG-leading energy, including green energy.\n\nFigure 7: World Bank Logistics Performance Index\n\n(2018, Index = 1-5)\n\nTaking action:\n\nWith the support of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, drive nation-building projects by:\n\nDeveloping a strategic perspective on the highest productivity-enhancing infrastructure priorities for the country.\n\nUnlocking a pipeline of investable infrastructure projects by increasing the acceptability of user-pay models.\n\nMore proactively incentivizing these projects to happen, including non-traditional asset classes (e.g., digital and green infrastructure, including CCUS and small modular reactors (SMRs)).Footnote 56\n\nCreating fast-track approval processes across all levels of government to increase the scale and velocity of investment.\n\nInvest in strategic trade infrastructure that addresses critical bottlenecks (e.g., create gateways and corridors strategy for bulk commodities and containers). Infrastructure needs to be trade-focused. Rail, road, ports, airports, pipelines and tech capacity are priorities, and we have well-known infrastructure deficits in these areas. We will not be able to keep pace with demand in fast-growing markets if we do not ramp up infrastructure investments significantly.\n\nAgile regulation\n\nA regulatory ecosystem that encourages and facilitates innovation is an important tool for the Government to facilitate recovery. In Budget 2018, the Government announced that it would pursue a regulatory reform agenda focused on supporting innovation and business investment and make Canada's regulatory system more agile, transparent and responsive in order to stimulate opportunity. For example, duplication in federal/provincial regulatory requirements create bottlenecks by increasing costs for businesses and encouraging investment outside of Canada. Targeted regulatory reviews to remove such barriers to economic growth are being conducted on high-growth sectors and strategic areas. These include clean technologies (to grow the sector and support the adoption of new technologies across sectors), digitization and technology neutrality (by simplifying regulatory approvals and making regulations more adaptable to technology changes), and international standards (harmonization through incorporating international standards in our regulations).\n\nThe Council strongly supports these efforts and encourages accelerated activity where the Government can leverage these vehicles for change to ensure a regulatory system that supports a vision of innovation, sustainability and growth. We can simplify the existing system and provide new areas of growth, namely by harmonizing, codifying, and setting new industry standards. In addition, continued efforts to cut red tape on commercial operations and marketplace exchanges, and to digitize and automate approval processes and client service interactions, will help businesses reduce time spent on activities that distract from value creation.\n\nWe note that our call to action in this area echoes what has been put forward by previous councils and advisory committees to the Government. If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it is the art of the possible. When needed, we can move very quickly, in a coordinated manner with governments and the private sector, to find our way through red tape that prevents action and agility. As a Council, we want to reiterate the importance of action here, especially in key areas for accelerating our growth.\n\nSectoral crosswalk: Regulations\n\nThe speed and responsiveness of the Government and its ability to mobilize quickly to deliver a range of emergency benefits and relief measures was on full display in the early days of the pandemic. A comparable degree of urgency is required to streamline and modernize our regulatory system to support innovation and encourage investment.\n\nThe need for an agile, transparent and responsive regulatory framework was reinforced in five sectors including Resources for the Future, Digital Industries, Clean Technology, Transportation and Health/Bio-sciences, with stakeholders signaling their support for a new collaborative relationship between industry and regulators. COVID-19 should be the impetus to accelerate critical work on regulatory reform.\n\nTaking action:\n\nFast-track regulatory reviews in sectors where delays have a disproportionate financial and societal impact (e.g., clean technology, resources), conduct targeted regulatory reviews to support most impacted sectors (e.g., oil and gas, aerospace), and build on ongoing regulatory reform efforts to eliminate areas of federal and provincial overlap.\n\nStrategic use of procurement\n\nPrevious studies including the Advisory Council on Economic Growth (2016)Footnote 57 and Jenkins Report (2013)Footnote 58 have highlighted the importance of the strategic use of procurement to support Canadian business. During our engagement sessions and deliberations, we heard frequent reminders of the key role that the purchasing power of federal, provincial, and municipal government play to stimulate demand and create markets for new products. Strategic procurement could be used to accelerate and support innovation, help small- and medium-sized companies scale up and gain the experience and credibility to become fully integrated in global supply chains, as well as provide economic support to Indigenous communities.\n\nGovernment procurement can accelerate the development of technologies directly and generate \"investment credits\" that incentivize the behaviour of large private sector actors (e.g., Industrial and Technological Benefits). We encourage the Government to use these powers judiciously to achieve strategic goals—including support for priority sectors, high-growth potential firms, and future-focused technologies, like digital, clean technology, and health/ bio-sciences. Strategic procurement can help Indigenous-led business grow and can contribute to reconciliation by encouraging business development and socio-economic outcomes that support the path to self-determination.\n\nCOVID-19 has served as a stark reminder of the value of domestic resilience, and domestic supply chains. We should follow the examples of our peer countries and apply a national security lens more broadly to drive domestic procurement in areas critical to the well-being of Canadians, such as transportation, energy, bio-technology and life sciences. When the Government is the first buyer of innovative technologies in these spaces, it enables our firms to scale more quickly, create more jobs and adopt an export orientation. Moreover, strategic procurement can be used to unlock economic benefits throughout the entire innovation ecosystem.\n\nCrosswalks between procurement and strategic sectoral activity\n\nOur clean technology, digital, and health/bio-sciences sector-specific recommendations are included in our Feature Section: Deep Sector Insights. They include a call for the strategic use of procurement to accelerate demand of made-in-Canada technology, incentivize industrial deployment, and ensure the resilience of our domestic supply chains and capabilities.\n\nA targeted approach could better support domestic innovation, increase export potential, create meaningful jobs in high-growth sectors and ensure Canadian competitiveness.\n\nTaking action:\n\nImprove supply chain resiliency through strategic domestic procurement, particularly in strategic sectors impacted by COVID-19 and/or where there is opportunity to create scale in health care, clean technology, education and Indigenous-led businesses. The recommendations of previous reports on procurement should be fully implemented.\n\nReimagine: Catalyze GDP growth beyond pre-COVID-19 levels\n\nAs we Reimagine Canada, we can further build on our areas of strength to position us for success in the years to come.\n\nRecommendation D: Canada needs an industrial strategy with four key pillars for a digital, sustainable, and innovative economy for all Canadians\n\nCOVID-19 has highlighted the need to strengthen and build a competitive and resilient economy. Without a clear, overarching industrial strategy to help Canadian sectors excel in an increasingly innovative global landscape, Canada risks being left behind.Footnote 63 Canada's recovery and our competitive edge will depend on us developing an industrial strategy to address our challenges. This includes identifying the areas and sectors in which we are best set to compete and lead globally. As a start, we are rightly focused on the parts of our economy that are struggling or have been hit hard by COVID-19, but we also need to expand that focus to strategic sectors where we can double down investment, scale businesses and go global.\n\nWe need to bear in mind the shifts in global demand and the need to aim the Canadian economy more in that direction. Put another way, if we are going to grow, it is going to be on the global trade front and in non-traditional markets. Long before COVID-19, Canada's current account balance was in a deficit. This position reflects Canada's trade and investment relationships with the rest of the world.Footnote 64 Combined with the effects of the pandemic, policy makers are forced to address two challenges in tandem: the pre-COVID-19 current account deficit and new fiscal and global market pressures. These are the two mountains we now need to climb. To describe the issue more clearly, Canada is facing a need to double down on our abilities domestically and on how we approach trading relationships globally.\n\nWe recognize that a call for an industrial strategy might be contentious. However, the economy-wide damage caused by COVID-19 amplifies the need for an agile and targeted approach, focused on leveraging our competitive advantages and maximizing economic and social outcomes. This is not about the Government \"picking winners\". Throughout our consultations, we heard about Canada's competitive strengths and the economic benefits that could be realized if we had a targeted strategy to promote specific sectors and their productivity. The overriding goal should be to cultivate innovative firms and new technologies that can compete globally and in turn boost economy-wide productivity.Footnote 65\n\nWe had the opportunity to meet with many of the best and brightest of Canadian business, labour, academia, and civil society over the summer, and we were inspired by their vision for Canada. An industrial strategy would serve to rally Canadians around our economic future long after the threat of COVID-19 has passed.\n\nThrough an industrial strategy rooted in evidence-based policy and strategic investments, we can build the capacity that is required to support a resilient recovery. Such a strategy can improve Canada's productivity, competitiveness and future attractiveness on the global stage through investments in our comparative advantages and where there is global demand.\n\nWe have identified four interconnected pillars, which could form the cornerstone of an industrial strategy and would have real economic impact across Canada's provinces and territories, industrial sectors, and population. These include: becoming a digital and data-driven economy; being the ESG world leader in resources, clean energy technology; building innovative and high-value manufacturing where we can lead globally; and leveraging our agri-food advantage to feed the planet.\n\nThe interconnectedness between these four pillars is a key strength. Our ability to identify and invest in elements that cross-cut industrial sectors to create value, will enable us to fully leverage the associated economic benefits and yield economic growth. The sectoral diversity represented on our Council has provided a unique lens through which to identify these crosswalks.\n\nImplementing an industrial strategy is no easy task. There are important steps to consider to ensure success. To implement Canada's industrial strategy, the Council recommends:\n\nThe signal for its implementation be given at the highest level of government to ensure the involvement of all departments, and that some level of funding be secured to meet industrial strategy objectives (an Industry Growth Fund);\n\nThe coordination and oversight of the implementation be led by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada;\n\nA public–private partnership component requiring the involvement of an organization that is both \"in the state and in the market,\" such as BDC; and\n\nIn this context, a new mandate could be given to BDC and/or others to develop and implement new partnerships with the private sector, driven by increased investment, the development of strategic sectors, and the idea of a shared responsibility for the success of the country and the well-being of Canadians.\n\nCanada's peer countries are making bold strategic choices and investments to build their industries for the future. They are investing heavily in stimulus measures and deploying sector-specific support to drive productivity. Countries such as Italy and Germany have implemented aggressive fiscal responses. Other countries including the US, UK, China, France, Israel, India, as well as the EU are significantly increasing support for innovation in the face of an accelerated move to a digital, data-driven and decarbonized global economy, particularly as a result of the pandemic.Footnote 66\n\nIn this new context, we need to ensure a stronger position for Canada on the global stage—one that supports more Canadian firms to become global leaders and that creates wealth and prosperity for all Canadians. By implementing the proposed industrial strategy, which focuses on leveraging our strengths to compete globally, we are laying the groundwork for success.\n\nPillar 1: Become a digital and data-driven economy\n\nEstablish Canada as a leader in digital through purposeful R&D and connectivity investments in order to create world-leading digital native companies, transform traditional sectors, retain Canadian talent, and prepare Canadians for the future.\n\nWhile digital disruption was well underway long before the onset of COVID-19, the pandemic has dramatically accelerated the global shift to digital. In mere months, segments of Canada's economy, including e-commerce and education, have been propelled forward upwards of ten years in their digital adoption. Given this new reality, governments around the world are taking appropriate action (investing in essential and strategic industries, next generation digital platforms, legal frameworks, data, privacy, and IP) recognizing that their firms must embrace digital or be rendered obsolete in the global marketplace.\n\nThe pandemic showed the extent to which operational resiliency depends on the ability of firms to adopt and deploy modern digital technologies and to leverage the data that come with it. Globally, digital and data-transformed companies are projected to increase from approximately $12T in GDP production to $50T over the next four years.Footnote 74 To capitalize on these global opportunities, Canada will need to drive toward robust digital infrastructure that provides the platform upon which all firms can build up their digital footprint. As noted earlier, Canada's future prosperity is linked to our ability to eliminate the digital divide and enable all Canadians to participate in a digitally connected future.\n\nCanada conducts world-leading R&D and does well at creating promising tech start-ups; however, few of our digital native firms grow to scale within Canada. Fortunately, the Government has many tools at its disposal. In addition to strategic procurement and eliminating regulatory barriers, current innovation support programs (e.g., IRAP, SIF, SR&ED) can be adapted to fill the gap that currently exists to support firms scaling from SMEs to upper-middle or large firms. Countries like Germany, France, China and the United States, have focused on scaling upper-middle companies to become world leaders. In our context, this would entail identifying Canadian-controlled companies (public or private) with greater than $75M per year in revenue, and supporting their growth to $1.5B in revenue.\n\nThe most important asset of any leading firm is its people, and Canada cannot build a digital and datadriven economy without sufficient talent. Canada has long been an attractive destination for globally mobile talent and has the opportunity to build on its reputation as a welcoming c"
