        "text": "President Of India Visits Sathya Sai Baba At Prasanthi Nilayam\n\nThis day happens to be a special day in the annals of Prasanthi Nilayam as Her Excellency The President of India, Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil visited Prasanthi Nilayam. The President who came by a chartered Indian Air Force Aircraft was received at the Sri Sathya Sai Airport by the Collector of Anantapur, Secretary of Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust, Sri K. Chakravarthi, Vice Chancellor of Sri Sathya Sai University Sri Vishwanath Pandit, Former Vice Chancellor Prof. G. Venkataraman and other dignitaries.\n\nThe President who came into the Sai Kulwant Hall at 4:35 p.m. for His Divine Darshan was blessed by Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba with a half an hour audience. At the end of the interview Bhagawan blessed the Presidential support staff with Vibhuti Prasad. After the President and her entourage left the Nilayam, the three students who had performed Burra Katha on the previous day on the life of Mother Easwaramma gave another performance on the life of Shirdi Sai Baba.\n\nAs is the custom, the artistes began their performance by offering their salutations to Lord Ganesh. As they were offering their salutations to Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, the traditional garlanding took place. The students began their interesting narration on the life of Shirdi Sai Baba supplementing it with songs and humour. Delineating on the birth of Shirdi Sai Baba, the artistes said that He was born to Hindu parents Devagiriamma and Gangabhavadia. The Divine couple Parvati-Parameswara appeared before Devagiriamma and Gangabhavadia and foretold that He would be born to them as their third child. The couple who were childless till then gave birth to a daughter and son. On 28th September 1835, Shirdi Sai Baba was born in the village of Patri. Though born to Hindu parents, Shirdi Sai Baba was brought by a Muslim couple. As a child, He used to go to a Hindu temple and proclaim about Allah and speak about Rama in a Mosque. He advocated the concept “Sabka Malik Ek Hai” (One God governs all).\n\nFrom the year 1858, Baba lived in Shirdi. He spent his early days under a neem tree and later lived in the Masjid which he named as Dwarakamai or Mother Dwaraka. Baba used to feed the fakirs and devotees and even cook for them. Baba had a profound love and compassion for suffering humanity. The master used to personally attend to the needs of the sick as a physician and a nurse. Baba distributed the holy ‘Udi’ – the panacea for all troubles to his devotees. ‘Udi’ is the ash from the perpetual sacred fire – Dhuni lit by Baba. The Udi is the token of His divine grace to all who come to Him for help. He begged for alms and shared what he got with his devotees and all the creatures around him.\n\nOnce during the festival of lights, Deepavali, Baba wanted to light lamps in Dwarakamai. As the shopkeepers refused to give Him oil, Baba just poured water on the lamps and lighted them. One can call it was only a tip of the iceberg. Baba performed many such miracles in His lifetime. He lived for 83 years and attained Samadhi in the year 1918.\n\nThus ended another beautiful narration by the three artistes. Bhagawan blessed the Prasadam to be distributed to all the devotees. Arati was offered to Bhagawan at 6.00 p.m. before He retired to His Abode.\n\nReference\n\nPrez Has Darshan Of SaiBaba\n\nPresident Pratibha Patil being given a warm welcome on arrival at Puttaparthi on Thursday.\n\nExpress News Service\n\nFirst Published : 08 May 2009 09:30:29 AM IST\n\nLast Updated : 08 May 2009 11:42:41 AM IST\n\nPUTTAPARTI: President Pratibha Patil today had a darshan of Sri Satya Saibaba and later had a private audience with the Holy man for over 30 minutes at the Prashantha Nilayam here.\n\nThe President arrived here at the Satya Sai Airport from Banagalore at 4.10 p.m. and straight away drove to Srinivasa Guest House in the Prashanthi Nilayam. After spending some time at the Guest house, Pratibha Patil drove down to Sai Kulvant Hall.\n\nShe first had the darshan of the Swamy and later went inside the green room and had a personal talk with Satya Saibaba for about half hour.

Mr. Tigrett’s keen insights into trends and social/cultural movements, together with expansive creative capabilities, fuel his visionary approach to creating experiences and environments that entertain and educate customers and participants.\n\nIn his early career, Mr. Tigrett’s focus was on the evolution of music and pop culture and their impact on society. In 1971, at the age of 22, he created the world famous Hard Rock Café in London with his 50/50 partner Peter Morton (23). Tigrett was the concept creator and named the venture HARD ROCK CAFÉ. Morton was from a distinguished restaurant family in Chicago USA. He supplied the food and catering know-how. Eric Crisman, an early manager, describes the two young entrepreneurs.\n\n“Tigrett and Morton couldn’t have been more dissimilar! Like oil and water! Tigrett was a revolutionary hippie activist with long hair, dressed in King’s Road “blue velvets” and snake skin boots. Morton sported Saveille Row tailored blue blazers, Turnbull & Asher shirts, blue jeans and Gucci shoes (See Newsweek photo shoot 1971). While Tigrett’s musical tastes were Jimmy Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Led Zeppelin; Morton’s brand music was the group Bread, Cat Steven’s and Roxy Music. Tigrett’s crowd consisted of hippies, artists, and musicians while Morton hung out with models and fashion designers.”\n\nTigrett and Morton held together their shaky partnership until 1981. Tigrett then bought out Morton’s interest in the only existing Hard Rock Café on London’s Hyde Park Corner and all World Rights to the name Hard Rock Café. Morton retained rights to develop the Hard Rock Café’s in the USA states West of the Mississippi River and three foreign countries; Israel, Colombia and Australia. Tigrett controlled all the USA States East of the Mississippi, and all other countries “world wide”. Morton opened the 1st Hard Rock Café outside the original in London, in Los Angeles Calif. in 1983, with its original 1971 Americana décor.\n\nTigrett re-launched The Hard Rock Brand in 1984 in New York City with long-time friend and partner Dan Akyroyd. Tigrett wowed the music world and its fans with his creation of The World’s First “authentic” Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Musicians World Wide rushed to donate their Rock Memorabilia to Tigrett’s Rock Museum for “time immemorial”. A week later he re-launched the original London Hard Rock Café as Europe’s First Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Morton quickly copied Tigrett’s creations in London and New York keeping the “new” HRC brand consistent.\n\nTigrett went on to develop the Hard Rock Hall of Fame in Stockholm, Sweden; Tokyo Japan; Dallas Texas, Reykjavik Iceland; Boston Massachusetts; Orlando Florida; Cancun Mexico; Washington DC; Jackson Tennessee (Tigrett’s home town) based on his “Original” HRC in London, and began to develop franchise opportunities “world wide”. Tigrett took the Hard Rock though three Public offerings in the United States and Europe.\n\nMorton went on to develop Hard Rock Café’s in San Francisco CA; Chicago; Denver Colorado; New Orleans Louisiana and other sub markets in his territories, West of the Mississippi River. Morton developed the 1st Hard Rock Café Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Nevada, using original designs created by Tigrett and “the world renowned” Graphic Artist – for their “Royal Majesties,” The Beatles – Alan Aldridge.\n\nTigrett and Morton sold their perspective Hard Rock Café companies which eventually went to England’s Rank Origination PLC. Rank went on to expand the Hard Rock Café Brand in 40 countries; 124 HRC’s 4 Hard Rock Hotels and 2 additional HRC Casinos. Rank sold the Hard Rack Café Brand to the Seminole Indian Nation of the USA in 2007.\n\nFollowing the sale of his interest in the Hard Rock Café, Mr. Tigrett was involved in numerous charitable activities. Prominent among those was his role as a founding trustee of the Rama Foundation of Zurich, Switzerland; and principal sponsor of the creation of the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medicine, a free 500-bed advanced surgical hospital that serves the rural poor in Anantapur, India.\n\nFollowing the opening of the Medical Institute, Mr. Tigrett turned his attention to his next venture. Using the skills that he has demonstrated in building the Hard Rock Café “Brand”, he again wowed the music community with his “new creation,” the famous HOUSE OF BLUES, again with long time friend and “Blues Brother” Dan Akyroyd. Mr.Tigrett’s vision for The House of Blues grew from his belief that popular tastes were evolving from rock’n’roll to alternative original music art forms such as Blues, Jazz, Latin, Country & Western, Urban, Rhythm & Blues and Rap.\n\nTigrett’s new HOUSE OF BLUES “cultural creation” consisted of a dynamic Live Music Venue for 2000 people plus, an exclusive Private Club and gourmet restaurant called The Foundation Room, and a 350 seat “New Orleans Restaurant” filled with previously unseen Original American “Out Sider Art.” He extended the HOUSE OF BLUES brand into other media including a record company (with BMG), radio shows (with CBS), television production (with Time Warner), and the Internet’s First Live Music Address, LiveConcert.com (in partnership with Real Audio). House of Blues also launched the now famous music tours “Smoking Grooves” (Urban&Rap) and “Barn Burner” (Heavy Blues).\n\nTigrett founded the much-heralded HOUSE OF BLUES venues in Harvard Square, Cambridge Massachusetts; New Orleans, Louisiana, Los Angeles CA, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Orlando, Florida; and Chicago Ill. Including the HOB Hotel, (340 Rooms) in Chicago.\n\nTigrett left HOUSE OF BLUES in 1998 after a “Board Room” power grab by directors Chase Bank, The Disney Company, The Aeneus Banking Group and Goldbury Ventures.\n\nTigrett went on to form The Word Foundation with the Interfaith Center of New York, which broadcasted on the Worldwide Web. Some of those video and Internet broadcasts included: The Parliament of the World Religions from Cape Town, South Africa 1998; His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s “A Global Quest for Union”; World Sacred Music Festival 12/8-10/1999 in Cape Town, South Africa; His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s World Sacred Music Festival, April 2000 in Bangalore, India; The Sixth Annual Alternative Therapies Symposium & Exhibition on 4/25-29/2000 in Kohala Coast, Hawaii; The Fez Festival of World Sacred Music, under the patronage of His Majesty Mohammad, King of Morocco, 5/31-6/8/2000 in Fez, Morocco; and “Wisdom Sharing: Community, Ritual and Healing”, The Association for Transpersonal Psychology 8/4-6/2000 in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nTigrett returned to his native home town Jackson Tennessee in 2001 to attend to his ailing mother, Frances, until her death and in 2005. Tigrett now lives in Prasanthi Nilayam in South India at the Ashram of his Master Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Tigrett is currently launching his next venture, a Spiritual Retreat in the “rain forest” of S. India – at the behest of his Master, “THE MYSTIC INN OF THE 7TH RAY.”\n\nHONORS AND ASSOCIATIONS\n\nThe Ark Trust of Great Britain\n\nIn 1988, after selling the Hard Rock Cafes, Mr. Tigrett became CEO of the non-profit environmental group with fellow supporters Chrise Hyne, Peter Gabriel, Kevin Godley Sting and others which, under his leadership, launched the first “environmentally friendly” Household Products in the U.K.\n\nThe Rama Foundation of Zurich, Switzerland\n\nMr. Tigrett is a founding trustee of the Foundation, which funded the creation of a Free (500 bed) Advanced Surgical Hospital for the rural poor in Anantapur, India.\n\nCathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City\n\nMr. Tigrett served as Trustee & Regent of the Cathedral, and on the Executive Board of Directors.\n\nThe House of Blues Foundation\n\nTigrett founded The HOB Foundation which promotes the teaching of Music and Art in American Public Schools.

Na, na, na, na, na . . .\n\nJake and Zee, who jumped into the crowd and aggressively belly-bumped hefty fiftysomething fans, were mighty winded after their hour-plus set and a long encore.\n\nBut after the gig, they got their chow on at Sonsie with a posse that included Shaffer and funnyman Tom Davis (original “SNL” members); Dan’s wife, Donna Dixon, and John Belushi’s widow, Judy Belushi Pisano; “Trader” Fred Mascolo from the Vineyard and Hub entertainment lawyer George Tobia.\n\nBut we’re getting ahead of ourselves . . . .\n\nThe party got under way just after 7 p.m. when a looooong line of revelers wound down Lansdowne Street to check in for the evening’s festivities. Inside the new hotspot, the cavernous Music Hall was slowly filling up with media, guests and Live Nation suits while most of the VIPs made a beeline for the second-floor Foundation Room .\n\nA fixture in every House of Blues, the Boston Foundation Room is a warren of private enclaves gussied up like an upscale hookah lounge – an homage to original HOB founder Isaac Tigrett’s guru Sathya Sai Baba.\n\nMingling near the mountain of shrimp cocktail, we spied Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer and his posse; Summer Shack chef Jasper White; Foundation Lounge lizard George Lewis; radio marketing gurus Mary Menna and Bev Tilden and their S.O.s, Peter Darveau and Steven Riley; Suffolk County Register of Deeds Richard Iannella and his bride Arlene; fashionista Alan Bilzerian and his bro, Vineyard fixture Larry Bilzerian; PR guru George Regan; Nauticus naughty boy Sandy Tennant; chiropractor to the stars Richard Greene; City Hall gadabout Tony Nunziante; social scribe Lisa Pierpont; and Red Sox [team stats] shareholder David Ginsburg.\n\nWhile the VIPs sweated it up (literally) upstairs, the rest of the revelers filled the Music Hall and two upper-level balconies to take in opening acts that included a gospel choir and blues guitarist Ronnie Earl and his band, as well as Reverend Lee.\n\nGroovin’ to the tunes we spied House of Blues honchos Don Law and Debbie Eybers; Mass.

The atmosphere was totally Divine and why not – it was the day to thank the DIVINE for coming to His world, and witnessing 1000 full moons in this BODY.\n\nPeople started coming in as early as 5am into the stadium. The security staff were all alert and everyone wanted this DREAM day to be a very grand one in typical Swami’s style.\n\nAll the VVIPS one could think of were present in Puttaparthi apart from many other dignitaries. And while we all were waiting for Swami, Prof.Anil Kumar and Nagaphani Sharma rendered some beautiful poems praising our beloved Swami’s compassion and love.\n\nIt was around 9am when Sri Jayendra Saraswathi from Kanchi Peetham arrived into the stadium followed by Swami Shivakumara from Sri Siddaganga muth, Karnataka, followed Sri Sakthiamma Swami from Sri Narayani Pitham and others\n\nAt 9:45 am the most auspicious time, a profoundly memorable moment in our lives, that moment which is undoubtedly a result of years and years of sadhana, that moment of glory, which made every one jump in joy and that moment of joy which took us to Samadhi state came when the Lord of the Lords clad in bright golden yellow robe, seated in the golden coloured Mobile Throne appeared.\n\nHe sat in Supreme Bliss looking at all of us majestically from His Golden Chariot as it entered into the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View stadium amidst veda chantings with 3 huge elephants leading the procession followed by students chanting vedas. The priests and all the Swamiji’s on the dais watched the Greatest Avatar the man kind has every witnessed. Thousands in the stadium were wiping their eyes, to take away the tears of joy and have a good view of the MATCHLESS Lord whom we very rarely see in His Golden Chariot.\n\nSwami’s chariot which had small tyres was pulled by Sevadals, (they might have done lot of meritorious deeds in their past lives to be chosen for this once in a life time chance), and the chariot took its time and it was just beautiful to watch Swami in His golden chariot seated all alone, blessing all the devotees seated on either side, watching all the arrangements in the stadium and a sweet smile in appreciation.\n\nThe Chariot slowly came closer to the dias, all the primary school kids seated right across the dais were in full swing with their characteristic full throated veda chanting. Swami sweetly looked at them appreciating their devotion and blessed them from the Golden Chariot. As the Golden Chariot came closer to the dais, He was slowly wheeled on to the dais and all the Spiritual heads looked at Him, some of them were here for the first time and we could see the bliss on their faces and a first hand experience of what our Swami is and what we devotees mean to Swami and the love He has for us.\n\nThe Chariot stopped in front of the dais and Swami transferred on to the dais. He then proceeded to see the vedic activities taking place by the priests and Swami visited each and every Yagna Kunda and blessed the rituals while witnessing the poornahuthi thus ending the Most memorable Event which the Man kind has ever witnessed so far.Swami then came forward and all the Swamiji’s were seated on either side of Swami. It was a treat to watch this particular scene where the Avatar of this Kali age with Swamijis from distinguished Spiritual organisations (Muths) in India on either side. Sri ShivaKumara Swami from Sri Siddaganga Muth Spoke in kannada thanking Swami for this opportunity and asked the humanity to uphold the Indian culture and Dharma. The Swamiji who is a centurion was seated next to our beloved Swami and Swami had a sweet smile when He exchanged words with Him.\n\nIt was around 10:45am and Arathi was given to Swami and taking leave from all the blessed souls, Swami left to His Physical Abode in His usual Porte car thus marking the end of a magnificient, never before SAI morning and there were smiles and just smiles on every one’s faces… and any particular reason for that broad smile??? Its the reflection of Love we have for Swami and if you are smiling or there are any tears in your eyes while reading this report.. its all Swami and His love being reflected on you…..Will we have another holy day like this.. probably yes if Swami blesses us…\n\nPrasadam was distributed to all the approximate 150,000 devotees (the chosen souls) and we all left for our homes with our familes hoping to come back again at 5pm for a cultural programme by Ms.Mahalakshmi Iyer and Troupe and hopefully a divine discourse from the 1000 full moon Swami… while others headed to the Bangalore International Airport to get back to their countries after their 3 or 4 day after having witnessed one of the most important days in the history of the universe.\n\nAlso see:\n\n– Yagnam Video From RadioSai\n\nFiled under: 83rd Birthday Celebrations Of Sathya Sai Baba, Gurus, India, Prashanti Nilayam, Sahasra Poorna Chandra Darshana Shanthi Mahotsavam, Sai Baba, sathya sai baba, Sathya Sai Baba Birthday Celebrations, sathya sai baba news, Yagnam | Tagged: Birthday, Breaking News, Famous People, Golden Chariot, Humanitarians, Puttaparthi, Religious Leaders, Saints, Spiritual Masters | 6 Comments »\n\nWhy Is Robert Priddy Citing A Channeler & Medium Against Sathya Sai Baba?\n\nRobert Priddy (an ex-devotee who worshipped Sathya Sai Baba as God Incarnate for 17-26 years) has been widely promoting, citing and endorsing the Anti-Sai Activist Conny Larsson on his Anti-Sai websites and Anti-Sai WordPress blog (even as recently as October 14th 2008).\n\nThe widely dispersed core allegations against Sathya Sai Baba can be directly traced to two highly questionable characters in the Anti-Sai Movement, i.e., Conny Larsson and Tal Brooke. Although a separate article has been devoted to Tal Brooke, his religious fundamentalism, Christian extremism, experimentation with LSD and his defection from the Sai Movement due to an “out of body demonic encounter” (more than likely a drug-induced bad trip), this article will focus more on Robert Priddy and his psychic friend and co-conspirator Conny Larsson.\n\nIn Robert Priddy’s Pro-Sai Book Source Of The Dream, he talked several times about Conny Larsson and there is little doubt that Conny Larsson’s defection from the Sai Movement was the primary reason for his defection as well. Robert Priddy even attended a meeting at Stockholm Royal in Sweden and sat next to multi-millionaire Conny Larsson as a panelist member speaking against Sathya Sai Baba (Ref). Within the last few years, Conny Larsson has developed from a vocal ex-devotee to an “internationally renowned” psychic trance medium for the spirit of Maharshi Vyasa (amusingly, a claim that Christian Tal Brooke would argue to be demonic and Satanic in nature).\n\nDuring Conny Larsson’s metamorphosis into a psychic channeler and spirit medium, Robert Priddy purposely suppressed and avoided all discussion of Conny Larsson’s psychic claims on his Anti-Sai websites (obviously fearing the repercussions that one of the founding members to the Anti-Sai Movement would be perceived to be a loon, charlatan and possible schizophrenic who hears “spirit voices” in his head). Even more amusing is Robert Priddy’s ceaseless trashing and bashing of psychics, channelers and mediums as con-men, liars, frauds, “true believers” and “absurd charlatans” belonging to the lunatic fringe seen in cults, ashrams and religious movements (see Priddy’s WordPress article entitled “SATHYA SAI BABA ‘CHANNELERS’ AND MEDIUMS”).\n\nRobert Priddy can often be seen siding with Indian rationalists, skeptics and atheists and demands “scientific investigation” into Sathya Sai Baba’s purported miracles and world-wide manifestations. However, when it comes to Psychic Conny Larsson, Robert Priddy puts aside his pseudo-rationalistic, pseudo-skeptic and pseudo-scientific beliefs and openly praises, endorses and cites Psychic Conny Larsson as a man of integrity and honesty! This type of hilarious public posturing is dishonest and blatantly hypocritical. Needless to say, Robert Priddy is unable to make a sober or consistent argument against Sathya Sai Baba without shooting himself in the very same foot he so often sticks into his mouth.\n\nFurther adding to the overwhelming hypocrisy of it all, is the fact that Robert Priddy once professed belief in “elementals, elves, fairies, leprechauns, gnomes, trolls, water spirits, animal and plant spirits or ‘devas’ , angels, invisible helpers, shaman ‘spirits’, ‘allies’, UFOs, extra-terrestrials, possessive demons, Satan, Pan-figures and other demi-gods” (Ref).\n\nRobert Priddy also attributed his most profound spiritual experiences to LSD-Induced hallucinations, which he has been praising for well over 30+ years. Even Robert Priddy’s son, Kai Nicolai Priddy, is a “true believer” in Astrology and is the webmaster and registrant for the Abacus Astrology Domain (Ref). Robert Priddy refuses to say one word about his own son’s “superstitious” beliefs although he trashes and bashes others for their “lunatic fringe” beliefs on his Anti-Sai WordPress blog.\n\nRobert Priddy ceaselessly attempts to portray himself as an intelligent, scientific and rational individual even though his current friendship, association and Anti-Sai Activism with Psychic Trace Medium Conny Larsson speaks for him to the contrary.\n\nThese are the typical types of questionable characters who are attempting to smear, defame and ridicule Sathya Sai Baba. The truth is now out and there is no stopping it.\n\nReference\n\nFiled under: Conny Larsson, Cultism, Guru Cult, Gurus, India, Psychics, Robert Priddy, Sai Controversy, sathya sai baba, sathya sai baba news | Tagged: Advaita Vedanta, Behind The Mask Of The Clown, Channelers, Cults, Famous People, Mediums, Mind Control, New Age, Personality Cult | Comments Off on Why Is Robert Priddy Citing A Channeler & Medium Against Sathya Sai Baba?"
