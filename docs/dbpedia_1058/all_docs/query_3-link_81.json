        "text": "DISCLAIMER: The ills that befall Manali are \"human\" and \"human-inspired\". The hills, the valleys, the streams, the rivers, the trees, the forests, the birds, the dogs, the plants and the flowers of Manali are exceptionally beautiful and completely welcoming, exactly as Nature had intended. All locals and foreigners (goras) too, are not alike. There are some things and some people who are genuinely good here. But most of what's not finds mention below.\n\nMANALI: CRUELLA De VIL LAND\n\nIf you know of Cruella De Vil (a character in the movie 101 Dalmatians, she makes fur coats out of Dalmatian puppies), if you are observant and live in Manali long enough to observe, you will agree that Manali, especially Old Manali village, is Cruella De Vil Land.\n\nCruelty to animals is part of the \"culture\" here. It would not be an exaggeration to say that children are \"conditioned\" to be cruel towards all animals, especially towards dogs.\n\nHere's why. When news of a litter having been delivered spreads in this village, pre-teenaged boys go around asking people, \"Kutti ne bacche daale hain..! Kidar hain?! Dekhaa?\" (A bitch has delivered a fresh litter! Do you know where?) These \"innocent\", \"cherubic\" kids then go on to \"select\" healthy male pups and leave the female pups behind.\n\nOf these, many are then \"stoned\", yes, \"stoned\" to death, sometimes using a slingshot, hand catapult or \"gulail\" and at others by simply throwing large pieces of stone at the tiny puppies.\n\nThe strange thing is that all grown men and women and young boys in Manali nurture a pathological aversion towards dogs and complain non-stop about dogs spoiling their standing crop (wheat, corn, vegetables), dogs crapping/urinating in their \"gardens\", dogs \"biting\" their kids, dogs causing nuisance for tourists (who are mostly drug addicts, adulterers, you get the drift...) by barking all day and so on.\n\nMost locals, like their offspring, leave no stone unturned, literally, in keeping stray dogs away. They freely, fiercely pelt these dogs with stones. Some locals even use sickles to cause severe injuries to these hapless creatures. Several strays in Old Manali village have hideous, painful wounds. Some have a missing leg, others have a painful limp, some have bleeding rectums and others have whole chunks of flesh missing from the neck or near the ears.\n\nYet these same locals think nothing of \"picking and choosing\" these very same nuisance dogs (MALE dogs) and taking them home to stand watch over their much-treasured fields, gardens, houses etc. No one blinks twice before snatching the puppies from their mothers, who are left wondering if there's ever a good place to be born a dog!\n\nTHE COWS WON'T COME HOME\n\nManali hills are home to several hundred cows; 4 kms from Manali lies a village called Goshal, a truncated form of the word Goshala or cowshed, with a long tradition of caring for cows. Most local families own a pair of milch cows and milk them to the limit. Yet, these bovines are fed a poisonous, carcinogenic fern called ‘bracken fern’. Much like Malana Cream, this variety of fern grows free and wild in the hills around Manali. When fed to cows, it causes internal bleeding and slow, painful death.\n\nOn a visit to the local veterinarian, I saw a poster warning against feeding cows bracken fern. But because it’s free and buying cow feed is a hassle (especially for the penny-wise), Manali cows are force-fed a poisonous weed. Nobody complains, except the cows, of course. But who will heed their pain?\n\nTHE HILLS HAVE 'GREEN' EYES\n\nOn my first summer staying in Manali, I went to a maidan, as it’s called, just above Old Manali village. By now many would have guessed that I did, unfortunately, stay on in this village for the longest time..! While heading toward this clearing in the middle of thick pine forests, about 2kms of a vertical climb away, I was quite kicked at having the first real encounter with nature in a long time. Well, it turned out to be an encounter alright, just too close to certain catastrophe for comfort.\n\nThat June day, I had planned to reach the maidan by 2 pm, pitch a brand-new tent in my landlord’s orchard nearby, feast on some Maggi noodles and a flask-full of instant coffee made over wood fire and then be lulled to sleep in Nature’s lap. Ah the romance of it..! As it turned out, on reaching the maidan well after 3 pm, the 13-year-old son of my landlord, who had earlier led me to believe that I’ll camp in their orchard near the clearing, later backed out and said I’d now have to pitch the tent in the middle of the clearing.\n\nAfter spending nearly 40 minutes in the upper maidan, I headed back towards my tent and stopped in my tracks when I saw the flap at its entrance appear slightly misshapen. Not the way I remembered having left it. Weird.\n\nPushing that thought away, again, I said goodbye to the hyperactive son of the landlord, who advised me to “Stay safe..!” quite cryptically in retrospect. With the sun setting behind tall trees and the tourist town of Manali glowing in the far distance to the south, I set about getting a tiny bonfire going, just outside the tent. Again, though, that creepy, hair-raising, indefinite, impossible, sick feeling of someone watching from somewhere, much closer now. Ten minutes into the bonfire and I got increasingly uncomfortable. It was as if the “catastrophe” was closer now than ever before. And then came that sound -- a woman’s piercing, frantic, desperate shriek, with words that sounded like, “Maar dungiiiiii..!” (I’ll kill you), it resonated above the maidan.\n\nI entered the tent, looking for some solace and to gather my wits, may be, and found a 10-inch-long piece of ribbon, in green, lying near my daypack..! And it DID NOT belong to me. This perplexed me, to say the least and then I remembered the wonky flap of the tent, the feeling that someone was watching and it sort of made sense. Then, without a second thought, I dunked into my daypack the essentials – my camera, my mobile, some water, the house keys, a torch (and left behind the sleeping bag, the utensils, the brand new green tent) and hurried on back the way I had come into the clearing.\n\nThere was just one problem!\n\nWhile the climb up had been almost-vertical and so, tiring, the climb down was precipitous and one missed step would have meant a fall down the abyss that was the path. Just then, a full moon rose over the hills above Vashisht and helped light up part of the hazardous way down to Old Manali village.\n\nIt was the weirdest, most frightening, near-fatal incident I’ve ever had. The wonky tent flap, the landlord’s son saying “Stay safe”, the woman’s scream, the green ribbon, the full moon, the hills with eyes – I’ve not ventured that way again. Who can blame me?\n\nBut Manali isn’t.\n\nManali is just a sub-division, part of Kullu District, which itself is just one of 12 districts in HP. But ask anyone in the Independent Marijuana Republic of Manali and they’ll huff and puff about “Mahra Muluk” (Our Land) and lead you into believing you’ve somehow landed in India’s non-existent 30th state! And you didn’t even fall down the rabbit hole. Didn’t so much as peep into it. No, Sir..!\n\nBLOW HORN...! YOU ARE IN MANALI\n\nIn Mahra Muluk Manali, you -- any citizen of India -- cannot purchase, in your name, either a piece of land or a motor vehicle. You can’t get a voter ID card, or a ration card, or a government telephone connection. You can purchase land and vehicles only if they are “in the name” of a resident of Himachal Pradesh or a Himachali, as they like to say. Now, the Constitution of India does provide for “reasonable/protective discrimination” but mainly as actions of an affirmative nature. Himachal Pradesh, Manali sub-division in particular, has twisted the logic on its head. Even residents of Himachal Pradesh born outside the Independent Marijuana Republic of Manali cannot or are not allowed to buy or even operate tourist taxis in its vicinity. Given the fiercely independent outlook of this picturesque sub-division in a land-locked alpine state and the anarchist tendencies of the dogged denizens of Mahra Muluk Manali, I wonder how long before our friends! to the east come across to say “Ni Hao..!” and colour Manali red. Comrade Kurum Dutt and Comrade Rakesh Thakur (two very common local names) sound so pleasant to the ears, now don't they, Maharaj?\n\nZANK YOU VERY MUSCH FOR LIVING ON DOLE\n\nOne reason why Manali locals feel so secure about their bank balance (despite their perplexing self-destructive behaviour with tourists) is the large population of foreign nationals living here long-term. By 2010-11, Manali had a floating tourist population of about 1,33,707 foreigners. Of these, many stay from March to October and then move south (to Goa, Pondicherry, Thiruvannamalai) for the winter.\n\nThese foreigners would pay from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 as monthly home rent, in 2014. They also engage in wink wink \"transcendental meditation through the oral and nasal cavity\" wink wink, consume a \"natural, herbal\" fad called MMS -- Miracle Mineral Solution -- and basically live it up in \"poor\" India among fawning dark-skinned natives (that's a gora perspective).\n\nThey also do not have any known sources of income. So, how do they do it? Put crudely, they live on dole. Claiming unemployment benefits, child care benefits, housing allowance, medical allowance, among other benefits from their governments, these expats live very comfortably at very little expense, here in India.\n\nThere's a reason why there is a hierarchy of nations in the world. First you bleed dry some nations, exploit their natural wealth and basically work hard to keep them poor. That's Third World countries for you. Then you keep some other countries in a not-so-bad, not-so-good state, neither here nor there, in suspended motion, hanging in balance and call them the Second World. Of course, the rest of the world, the money-lenders, the oil giants, the energy majors, the greedy industrialists, the ruthless capitalists, the hand-on-heart charity-espousing celebrities, the very people who divided things, nations, people into Third and Second Worlds inhabit the First World.\n\nThere's a reason why there is a hierarchy of nations in the world. It's to enable our 'friends' from Europe to get the best unreal (but they do) value for their money in the Third World among (to them) 3rd class residents. A 2014 report claimed that Swiss nationals were demanding more than 2500 Euros per month as unemployment \"benefits\" from the state. To tour the world at their exchequer's expense?! Wowee!\n\nHOUSE PROUD? NOT YET. HOME IN THE HILLS VAERY TOUGH TO GET MY FRAENDDD...\n\nSo, armed with atleast Rs 85,000 and nearly Rs 1,50,000 to \"blow\" each month (not counting \"underhand\", \"shady\", \"under-the-table, beneath-the-chair\"! deals), expats in Manali live sweet. They also enter into incredibly stupid land deals with the locals. For instance, when I was there, a gora would agree to lease a 1200 sq ft plot at anything from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh a year for 20 years or till he/she drops dead, whichever is earlier. The foreign tourist will then construct a well-equipped house on this plot, furnish the house with all modern amenities and re-furbish it every 5 years. At the end of the duration of the lease, the house passes on to the land owner, who also got between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh each year for 20 years. There are several such houses around Manali, a cluster of them in \"Shanti Valley\" above Old Manali Village, off the path toward the Manalsu river. Spoiled by the goras so much and for so long, no wonder the locals don't enter into deals with \"Indians\" and if they do, it's at astoundingly exorbitant lease amounts, impossible for most (including the ranter, me) to cough up.\n\nAlso, many foreign tourists stay on in Manali after \"marrying\" local men and women. While this might seem like a personal matter, it is not. These marriages are convenient quid pro quo deals, with land-owning locals enabling Euro and Dollar rich goras invest in real estate and conduct a profit-making tourist operation, in both India and from abroad. When I was living in Manali, a Swiss-German couple was overheard talking about a German friend of theirs \"looking for a local girl to marry\" (much like \"looking for fresh local charas\"), so that he could \"finally settle\" in India. There are several examples of this informal international conjugal alliance.\n\nOk, no naming names but guess it right if you can.\n\nThe eye of the largest cat species: The stocky owner of this very popular guest house in Old Manali has \"married\" a Dutch lady. They've actually gone Dutch here, ha!\n\nA Sports Club in a village: This Austrian man \"wedded\" a local girl years ago and now wines and dines with the expat crowd and minor royals\n\nSprawling resort meets moolah: This French guy married a local girl and now owns a resort nestled in a sprawling compound en route Naggar from Manali\n\nGaon ki gori from Russia: A local guy, famous for leching equally at Indians and foreigners (women, yeah, women) married a Russian girl some years ago and has now turned her completely local, in both attire and spirit\n\nINCREDIBLE TOURISM: FATAL ATTRACTION?\n\nOn June 4, 2013, a foreign tourist was gang-raped in Manali. The incident was covered widely in the press, with the Indian media quickly apportioning blame on “Nepalis”. Nepalis is a generic term used for bad characters, repeat offenders, hardened criminals, who may or MAY NOT be Nepalese. More often than not they are LOCALS."
