        "text": "OTEGO - William K. Davis, of Otego, passed away Feb. 16, 2023, in Davenport, Florida, following after a very brief illness.\n\nBill was born in Binghamton, to Horace and Margaret Kruger White.\n\nHe grew up in upstate NY with his adoptive parents, Charles Davis and Amelia Parker Davis.\n\nBill was a graduate of Sidney High School.\n\nHe enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps during WWII and served as a radio communications operator on B-17s and B-29s in the Pacific theater. After the war, Bill was assigned to Lt. Gen. Patrick Timberlake's personal command, which carried him to Singapore and points in between.\n\nUpon returning home, Bill attended Hartwick College and graduated in 1949 with a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting.\n\nIn 1948 he married the love of his life Alma Welcher in Sidney.\n\nBill and Alma raised three children while he began his career in the automobile business with Hotaling Sales and Service. Bill and his business partner Paul Donowick became auto dealers in Sidney, Walton, and Oneonta, eventually owning and operating Country Club Chevrolet and Otsego Automotive, which became the Country Club Automotive Group, along with his son Scott Davis and Tom Armao.\n\nHe received numerous awards, including the Time Magazine Quality Dealer Award, SUNY Delhi College Meritorious Service Award, and Otsego County Chamber of Commerce Distinguished Citizen Award.\n\nBill and Alma were fortunate to travel to many parts of the world, courtesy of General Motors.\n\nThey were often seen on the dance floor and enjoyed many rounds of golf as members of the Oneonta Country Club and Grenelefe golf courses in Haines City, Florida. He was fortunate to play golf up until the time of his illness.\n\nBill also enjoyed taking his daughters to compete in horse shows locally and once at Madison Square Garden. He became quite an equestrian himself, winning many trophies, ribbons and awards.\n\nBill was also an avid hunter and outdoorsman.\n\nWith a passion for his property's upkeep, Bill often was seen raking his lawn, riding his lawn mower, and driving his tractor with a manure spreader in tow on his horse farm in Otego.\n\nA faithful community servant, Bill was past president of the Oneonta Rotary Club and a member of many boards, including the SUNY at Delhi Technology Board, Saint James' Episcopal Church Vestry, NYS Automobile Dealers Board, and the Board of Directors of Wilber Bank.\n\nIn 2019 Bill was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from Hartwick College by then President Margaret Drugovitch.\n\nBill was preceded in death by his wife, Alma; sister, Thelma Murburg; and brothers, David, Lynne and Charles White.\n\nBill is survived by his sister, Carol Sue Dingman of Salt Springs, Flordia; his children, Christine (Joshua) Chase of Gainesville, Florida, Jennifer (James) Fotiades of Charlestown, Massachusetts, and Scott (Kathy) Davis of Otego; granddaughters, Erin (Logan) Pondolfino of Oneonta and Heather (Darren) Seid of New York City; plus great-grandchildren; several nieces and nephews; and special friend, Elaine Baird.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of The Lester R. Grummons Funeral Home, 14 Grand St., Oneonta. Calling hours will be held at the funeral home from 4 to 7 p.m., Friday, April 21.\n\nFriends are invited to attend a celebration of Bill's life at Saint James' Episcopal Church, 305 Main St., Oneonta, at 11 a.m., Saturday, April 22.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family suggests donating in Bill's memory to the Commemorative Air Force or the charity of one's choice."
