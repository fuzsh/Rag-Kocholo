        "text": "The rain in Shimla has been falling for eight hours.\n\nAs it drips off the eaves of the restored English-style cottages on to the wild pink primroses dotting the town high up in the Himalayan foothills, it is a reminder that even in matters of epic historic importance, sometimes the weather has a disproportionate impact.\n\nAs depicted in Channel 4’s new series Indian Summers, Shimla (or Simla, as it was called by the British during the days of the Raj), once affectionately known as Chhota Vilayat or Little England, was, in Rudyard Kipling’s words, a “centre of power as well as pleasure”.\n\nA hotbed of political, social and romantic intrigue set amid rolling hills, no place encapsulates the global ambitions as well as the parochial desires of the Raj better than Shimla.\n\nBut the imperial summer capital of India, from where one-fifth of humanity was once ruled, only exists because the British couldn’t cope with the heat. In yearning for cooler climes where they could enjoy pursuits such as riding, racing and croquet, Shimla became their idyll. By 1864, when Shimla was officially confirmed as summer capital, the mass migration of viceroys, military attachés and nearly 5,000 imperial clerks and staff, not to mention wives, children and servants, had already been taking place for decades. And it was no holiday jaunt. The bone-rattling journey of 1,200 miles by horse, elephant, bullock cart and sedan chair from Calcutta took five arduous days.\n\nRailways made the journey easier by the turn of the century. But governing from afar, even with the advent of the telegraph, had far-reaching consequences. “Shimla saw some of the most pivotal moments of colonial history,” said Raaja Bhasin, one of the historical consultants for Indian Summers.\n\nIt was the setting for some of the most important – sometimes disastrous – decisions taken by the colonial super-power, including planning for the Anglo-Afghan wars and the drawing of the Durand Line demarcating Afghanistan’s border.\n\nUltimately, it was the physical distance and aloofness that governing from Shimla encouraged which helped fuel the British empire’s demise, as Bhasin chronicles in his book, Simla, the summer capital of British India.\n\nStill, for a century, the viceroy of India directly ruled a larger population than the British monarch. Modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka were governed from Shimla amid a whirl of colonial picnics, garden fetes, balls, plays, hunts, cocktail parties, races, polo games and cricket tournaments. “Shimla combined the idyll of England with the entire resources of the Indian subcontinent,” said Bhasin. “This tiny little village was solely for the elite and their servants, and it had a steamy social life.”\n\nKipling, who visited Shimla frequently in the 1880s, wrote of the intense flirtation, trysts and debauchery for which it was infamous. Scores of young British girls, in search of husbands, turned up in Shimla ready to impress, only to find they had stiff competition from the “grass widows”, more experienced ladies in their 40s visiting without spouses, and often more popular with the bachelors.\n\nKipling wrote:\n\nThe young men come, the young men go, Each pink and white and neat\n\nShe’s older than their mothers, but They grovel at Her feet.\n\nThey walk beside Her rickshaw-wheels\n\nNone ever walk by mine;\n\nAnd that’s because I’m seventeen And she is forty-nine.\n\nEven the ugliest government officer in Shimla had his hill mistress. Many a cuckold was outed, attacked and divorced due to shenanigans uncovered here. But if the British were overly amorous with their own, they did their best to shun everyone else, as Indian Summers also accurately portrays.\n\n“Simla provided an escape not only from the heat, but also from the native culture,” writes Pamela Kanwar in Imperial Simla. “If social interaction between races was scorned in the plains, it was despised at Simla.”\n\nShimla’s neighbourhoods reflected these stark divisions. At the top, on the Ridge with views to both sides, lived the Viceroy, senior British officers and other wealthy, distinguished residents. “Domiciled” Britons – those who permanently resided in India – and mixed-race Anglo-Indians lived a tier below, around the Mall and its arteries.\n\nFinally, down in the Lower Bazaar, which stank of the sewage runoff from above, lived the Indian coolies, labourers, rickshaw pullers, maids and dhobis – washer women – on whose backs Shimla was built, their inferior status reinforced by the undesirable location of their homes.\n\nToday, that legacy is still alive, though not just in Shimla, but throughout post-colonial India where economic liberalisation has meant that – in theory – anyone can compete. But in practice, those who already have an advantage are winning. India’s wealth gap is today one of the world’s worst.\n\nInside Shimla’s “Mule Tunnel” built by the British to divert porters underneath the Mall, grey-haired migrants from Ladakh and Kashmir still ferry massive loads strapped to their backs for pennies. But now, their paymasters are fellow Indians. The government and the wealthy still colonise the Ridge. However, for the first time in Shimla’s history, a new generation of young Indians born and brought up here consider the town not a temporary or exclusive summer retreat, but a permanent home they are proud of and want to preserve.\n\nIn the Wake and Bake cafe, over an order of masala chicken crepes, Digvijay Singh, 26, points to the broken windows in the town hall opposite. “I love Shimla, but I think our government should invest more in its history if they want people to value it,” said Singh. “I also think more young people would be interested if they put all the historical information on an app.”\n\n“Today, heritage is Shimla’s core economic asset,” said Bhasin. “Without these hills and buildings, what would tourists come to see? Young people recognise that.”\n\nTourism is the most visible legacy of Shimla’s colonial past. The diminutive, narrow-gauge train completed in 1891 still chugs in from the plains below full of newly married Indian couples on honeymoon as well as groups of British tourists. They roam the Mall, a charming, pedestrianised shopping district where once ladies and gentlemen took the evening air, past antiquarian bookshops, handloom shawl emporiums and the odd neon-lit Nike shop.\n\nThey tour the Gaiety Theatre, which still puts on amateur plays, though no longer with lords and ladies as actors. And they take off their shoes before entering Christ Church, whose pale lemon facade still overlooks the town.\n\n“For me, the history is fascinating,” said Paul Godwin, 66, from Birmingham. “I’ve read an account of a British soldier during the 1857 Mutiny and boy they had a rough time, marching straight off a ship into the hot temperatures in their buttoned collars.”\n\nInside the imposing, extravagant Viceregal Lodge, which housed a succession of British rulers, including Lords Elgin, Canning, Curzon and Mountbatten, Madhulika Singh, 49, sees things rather differently.\n\nAmid the Burma teak walls and carved Kashmiri walnut ceilings, she carefully examines photos showing Mahatma Gandhi and other Indian freedom fighters negotiating independence in 1947. Those scenes, she said, make her feel “victorious”.\n\n“We Indians were their slaves and they lived a lavish life. That’s painful to see,” said Singh. “But we’re free now and they left us some beautiful architecture and infrastructure.”"
