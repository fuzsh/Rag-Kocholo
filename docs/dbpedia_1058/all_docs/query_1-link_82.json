Assuming he meant 100 years 8 months, if you subtract that age from his death date of October 1841 and you get 1740 or 1741. If he was born in late 1740, he would have not turned 101 until after October 1841, so this means he was probably born October, Nov, or Dec 1740. This doesn't quite work with his ages in 1830 and 1840 but is close.\n\nHowever, this could be off a little if \"100.8\" actually meant \"108\" instead. That puts his birth at ca 1733 instead, which also works with the records we have, and works a little better than ca 1740/1741.\n\nUncle Jake was only about 8 when his uncle William Davis died, but he is a much better witness than those who later reported that William was 117 or 127 years old when he died! The record does not support those ages. We can assume Jake got his information from his parents or others who were contempories with William Davis.;\n\n!BIRTH PLACE:There are conflicting family traditions about where William Davis was born. One legend has him born in England and another in Wales. One story has him stowing away on a ship and coming to America while still young. One published source has him born in Pennsylvania. I believe all of these are incorrect.\n\nWilliam Davis was born in Virginia without a doubt. He didn't live long enough to be listed on a census that included the birth place, but the 1880 census did have a column for where a person's parents were born. William's daughter Elizabeth Davis Vaughn Vance (1796-1883) was listed on that census. She reported that her father was born in Virginia. William's oldest son John Davis (1798-1881) was also listed on the 1880 census, and he also reported his father's birth place as Virginia. William's son Thomas Davis (c1805) was also listed in 1880, and just like the others, he listed his father's birth place as Virginia. The only contrary evidence is William's daughter Frances Davis Burleson (1808-1892). Her 1880 census entry lists her father's birth place as North Carolina. Those four were William Davis's only children to survive to 1880, and 3 of the 4 report his birth as Virginia. This is reasonably conclusive. It doesn't answer the question of *where* in Virginia though.;\n\n!PARENTS:Unknown, no clue, no idea where to start.;\n\n!NOTES:Some say that William Davis had brothers John, Richard and Thomas. This seems to be based on the biography of Gen. Daniel Morgan that mentioned them in the Frederick Co., VA area and being neighbors of his. This probably isn't the same William Davis, so those brothers aren't our William's brothers. However, our William did serve with Daniel Morgan during the Revolutionary War, so that is probably the source of the mixup.;\n\n!FRENCH and INDIAN WAR:(1754-1763) Tradition says that William Davis served along with Col. George Washington and was at Braddock's defeat. No evidence of this has been located so far, but records from that war are scarce.;\n\n!AMERICAN REVOLUTION:(1775-1783). Tradition says that William Davis served in this war and that he was at the Battle of Kings Mountain where he was shot in the thigh. Someone long ago concluded that he was the same William Davis who was a Corporal in the 2nd North Carolina Regiment, Continental Line. Indeed there was a Cpl. William Davis in that unit. However, thanks to the meticulous research of Mike Davis, it is now known that that couldn't be our William as that unit was never at Kings Moutain and spent most of the war as prisoners. Mike has found evidence that seems to show that our William Davis was a resident of Fairfax Co., VA during the war and served from there. This book is worth having:\n\nhttp://www.martygrant.com/books/davis/mike-davis-book.html\n\n!NOTES:According to his Will, William Davis lived in Mecklenburg County [NC] prior to moving to Burke. It isn't known when he was in Mecklenburg, but it was probably just after (or during) the war as it isn't far from Kings Moutain where he was injured.\n\n!CENSUS:1790 Burke Co., NC (two) -\n\np. 97 7th Company Wm Davis 2-2-2-0-0\n\np. 100 9th Company Wm Davis 2-0-2-0-0\n\n*It isn't clear which of these is our William Davis, perhaps neither. Can't really determine based on household members or neighbors. Neither are a real good fit. Perhaps he wasn't living in Burke at this time, or was missed by the census taker.;\n\n!NOTES:William married Frances Carpenter in the early 1790's, probably in what is now Ashe Co., NC but was then part of Wilkes. It isn't known if he ever lived there, or how or where he became acquainted with her. She was born in Surry Co., NC in 1771 and lived there with her family until they left in the 1790's for what is now Ashe.;\n\n!CENSUS:1800 Burke Co., NC (three) -\n\np. 740 William Davis age 26-44 (1755/74) 21110-50100-0-0\n\np. 742 William Davis age 45+ (bef 1755) 10001-21110-0-0\n\np. 743 William Davis Senr age 45+ (bef 1755) 31012-20100-0-0\n\n*Only the one on page 742 fits, and it fits very well.

Richmond: Everett Waddey Co. 1915.\n\np. 67\n\nWilliam Davis.--What?-- Hero: Patriot: Let us see. His grave is near the road in front of the Gen. Albertus Childs' house on Three Mile Creek, now owned and occupied by Robert Moseley. Two common \"mountain rocks\" mark the place of his burial. Two other graves beside his are similarly designated. No munificent government, proud of his record, has \"sought his frailties: or his virtues \"to disclose.\" Why? For he was a soldier of the Revolutionary War as well as those over whose ashes grave-stones have been erected. Who knows? Probably a bit of red-tape was missing somewhere. maybe his name does not appear on any roster or muster roll. Yet, in the congressional Library, at the nation's capital, is an allegorical painting called \"History.\" It represents a gray-haired sire telling the story of the past to his son, and this son selling the same story with additions to his son, and so on down the line till the printed page is reached. The name of that oral story is \"Tradition.\" Well, tradition says that William Davis was not only a brave soldier, but a mighty hunter as well, when the wilderness was to be conquered and weaklings stayed at home and sneered at the illiterate and lowly. Davis came to America with William Wiseman and William Penley long before the Revolution. He settled first in Virginia and afterwards came to Ashe County, where he married Frances Carpenter, sister of the first Jacob Carpenter. Then he moved to what is still called Davis Mountain, near Crossnore, on the upper waters of Linville River. When the game was exhausted there, he moved to Three Mile Creek and built four log houses \"all in a row,\" with communicating doors between and a chimney at each end. Standing before a blazing fire in one end of the house, with the three intervening doors open, one looks through four large, low-ceiled comfortable rooms to cherry-red flames leaping up the chimney at the father end--one of the \"fairest pictures of calm content that mortal ever saw.\" The date of the building of this old structure is recorded on one of the inside logs, but it has been ceiled over and cannot now be seen. But it was made there many, many years ago. The present Jacob Carpenter, his grand-nephew, of Altamont, knows the date of his birth and death, but they would cost the United States some \"good money\" to have them carved on a 12 X 24 inch stone. Davis died November 18, 1841, when 114 years of age. Still, as he had no middle name, it does seem that the Government, with a big G, might \"sort of look after\" uncle Billy, who fought his battles for him before Uncle Sam was born, he having been shot through the hips at King's Mountain. His wife, who sleeps beside him, was certainly a heroine, whether Uncle Billy was a hero or not, for on one occasion, in February, while in a sugar camp on Davis Mountain, he had to be away from her on a cold night. One of her cows found a calf that night, and Mrs. Davis brought it to camp with her and fought off the wolves with fire-brands till morning.\n\np. 225\n\nWilliam Davis, a soldier of the Revolution, stole his wife, a Carpenter, from Ashe, and settled at what is still called the Davis Mountain, now the Monroe Franklin place, and which Warsaw Clark now owns, one mile and a half above the Crossnore place, where Kate, the five year old daughter of Davis, is buried under an apple tree. It is said that he first gave the name of the Cow Camp to a creek of that name which runs into the Toe River because of the fact, that, having no feed for his cattle, he camped near them on that creek and supplied them with lin tree limbs, called laps, from the time the buds began to swell till the grass came.;"
