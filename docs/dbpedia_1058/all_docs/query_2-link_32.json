        "text": "Navy Rugby u23s turned over the RAF at Havant RFC with a dominant second half display. Trailing at half-time they soon discovered their rhythm and have become realistic Inter Services champions in waiting.\n\nAs a good size crowd enjoyed the music of the Band Service of the Royal Marines, the stand at Fraser Road began to fill. To the backdrop of Hearts of Oak, the players from both sides tested the fast surface of Havant’s artificial pitch. The RN, having played on the DESSO pitch at Sandy Park, would have the rub of the green as the RAF had had to cope with the torrential and heavy conditions at Aldershot.\n\nThe RAF kick off went dead allowing the Navy an opportunity to see where their lineout stood. Several firsts quickly followed and were ticked off successfully: lineout, maul, pick and go and box kick. Both teams soon came to realise that the ball could travel a long way on the Havant playing surface. Cleverley with a trademark midfield dart created an opportunity that tempted Kieren Manson at 10 to kick deep. He wanted territory but the ball went the wrong side of the corner flag. An almost mirror image play followed with the RAF kicking dead. Stalemate in midfield!\n\nThe game hinted at opening up when a strong run by Lucas Cann earned the team a glimpse at space out wide; Prentice playing at 12 sent his opposite number the wrong way with a show and go. This gave left wing, Penrose-Toms, a chance at crossing the whitewash but the defence was there in numbers to deny him the first score in the corner.\n\nIn the swirling conditions, the crowd was treated to some solid back of the lineout work from Harrison Utton-Smith; arriving back down on terra firma, he earned impressive yardage. Manson with a step off his right was tackled 5m short. Momentum and dominance were beginning to build.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter the Navy side must have been kicking themselves. Having gone through multiple phases, they had gained no tangible territory. Where and when was the decisive moment going to happen!? The Hawks had a vote in that by finding themselves on the wrong side of the tackle. Captain Cleverley fancied the posts, the distance was good, but the direction was not.\n\nOn the half hour (and potentially against the run of play) the light blues scored under the posts with a simple conversion. 0 - 7. The coaches could look back at this as one of those rugby moments or forensically question how the team was not set up correctly to clear their lines. What didn’t happen though was a drop in heads - strong leadership and character ensured that.\n\nWithin 5 minutes, a dominant scrum in the 22 must have fully restored confidence. A penalty, a kick to touch, a lineout, a try. The RN responded well with Tighthead Harry Wright scoring. Navy Rugby 5 - 7 RAF u23s.\n\nQuickly finding themselves back on their own try line, some thunderous tackling was required from the RN after they decided not to compete at the lineout. Number 8 and vice-captain, Jack Mills uncomfortably got back to his feet after one enormous hit as the RAF tried to play close to the breakdown. The Navy did well to keep the RAF and half time was signalled.\n\nAt the restart, an errant RAF kick after they stole a Navy lineout allowed Penrose-Toms to bump, step and dance around players. Steinberg came close but was held up over the line. Chances were coming in quick succession, so would the RN rue this missed chance!?\n\nIt’s a brave hooker (Harry Wright) and lineout caller who keeps choosing to go to the tail, but the RN recognised its productivity and kept going with the winning formula. Back of the lineout equals quick ball for the half-backs to play with. A strong rolling maul, a harassing kick chase by Jack Davis resulted in a penalty in the 22.\n\nThe lineout was always going to lead to success. Another break off the tail by Utton-Smith allowed him to attack the 10 channel and score. Manson converted and the Navy was in the lead.\n\nBen Raivalitia came on for Jack Davis who has credit in the bank following a very steady performance on the right wing both in defence and attack. Whether the change was the catalyst it is difficult to say, but out on the other wing Penrose-Toms found some space; Freddie Elliot angled his run between the two defenders and scored under the posts. Manson duly converted. Navy 19 – 7 RAF.\n\nAfter the restart a towering spiral bomb challenged the RAF deep defenders, and Raivalitia made his presence felt as he squeezed between them as he won the aerial duel. A clean gather from replacement Charlie Davis allowed him to glide over unopposed.\n\nThe last 10 minutes looked daunting for the RAF. At 24 – 7 they looked out of it, but they stoically continued emphasised by their full back, Lewis Bovington, who managed to halt a certain try when he disrupted an RN 4-on-one. Some post-match analysis will be required to determine how that should never happen again.\n\nAs the seconds counted down, the crowd was calling for the final whistle. As per the end of the first half the medical staff were dealing with an on-field injury to a RAF player. After patiently waiting for time to be back on the RN held solid in the scrum, kicked to touch and richly deserved the accolades.\n\nRNRU u23s: Dom Cleverly (C), Jack Wright, Harry Wright; Andrew Hussell, Charlie Kerr; Harrison Utton-Smith, Lucas Cann, Jack Mills (VC); Eli Steinberg, Kieran Manson; Charlie Penrose-Toms, George Prentice, Jack Bartlett, Jack Davis, Freddie Elliott.\n\nReplacements: Ben Rees, James Wales, Oscar Sanders-Mortimer, Brodie Paterson, Charlie Davis, Lewis Clayton, Ryan Scott, Ben Raivalitia.\n\nImages by Mark Deller"
