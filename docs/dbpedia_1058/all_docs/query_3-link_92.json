        "text": "The Judiciary is a distinct and independent arm of Government entrusted with judicial authority, and mandated to administer and deliver justice to the people of India. It plays a fundamental role in the promotion of law and order, human rights, social justice, morality and good governance.\n\nThe independence of the Judiciary is guaranteed by the constitution in a number of its provisions regarding among others, the appointment, removal, salary and other conditions of service of judicial officers. The core of the Judiciary's independence is the absence of any interference for the Executive or the Legislature in judicial decisions.\n\nThe mandate of the Judiciary is to establish and facilitate effective and efficient machinery capable of functioning as an adjudicating authority in India and of quickly administering and delivering justice and related services to the people of India. The key function of the Judiciary is therefore, the adjudication of civil and criminal cases. In addition, it interprets the constitution and gives effect to its provisions, as well as providing the expertise in interpreting of the laws. Further, the Judiciary performs other related duties in promotion of human rights, social justice and morality."
