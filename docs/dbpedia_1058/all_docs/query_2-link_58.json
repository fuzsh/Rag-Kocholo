        "text": "When I think of naval aviation in the Second World War, the cinema of the mind projects grainy black and white images of gargantuan fleet carriers, streaked with rust, heaving mightily in heavy seas, white foaming water streaming from gun tubs, signal flags snapping at the halyards, the silent wink of the Aldis lamp speaking like the eye of Sauron from lofty black heights. I see the burning list of USS Franklin as she faces the death she would eventually cheat. I see a kamikaze roaring like a wounded bull through the flak to drive deep into USS Essex. I see a heavy black plume of smoke rising from HMS Formidable and in front of it a white geyser of steam as she vents her system to prevent her boilers exploding.\n\nAs a young boy growing up in the shadow of the Second World War, my life was permeated with the stories and painted with the images of that massive global conflict. Our childhood games were centred on its looming presence and our drawings, readings and dreams were filled with its dark and dramatic persona. It was inescapable, but we did not wish to escape it for it was not only a world of obscenity and evil, it was a world of heroes, of pilots and gunners and captains and tank drivers—men and women who now lived in our neighbourhoods, called us home to lunch, and drove us to cub scouts.\n\nFor me, it was the imagery of warships and airplanes that seared its powerful technological brand onto my boyish imagination. When these two realms—sea and sky—came together on the windswept expanse of an aircraft carrier’s flight deck, I was gob-smacked by the spectacle of it all—the steel, the smoke, the sailors bending into the wind, the saw blade shimmer of propeller arcs, the endless bright sparkling expanse of the Pacific, the unmitigated danger of it all.\n\nSome were relegated to the drudgery of aircraft ferrying and one or two never even launched a single aircraft, but most saw some combat activity either in the high arctic waters off Norway, in the swelter of the Indian Ocean or with the Royal Navy’s Pacific Fleet.\n\nUnlike fleet carriers, escort carriers of both the United States and Great Britain had lives after their fighting careers were over. Nearly all of them sold to commercial shipbuilders after the war and were stripped down to their base mercantile hulls, then rebuilt as cargo vessels, many of which, at nearly 500 feet long, were the largest of their day. A few of them even became luxury ocean liners. These often-beautiful merchant vessels continued on for another 20–25 years or more, with most going to the breakers in the 1970s.\n\nA year ago, I decided that I would do a story on these escort carriers and their role in the expedition of the war. I chose to write a story on one particular class—the Ruler Class of the Royal Navy, named not for the first ship of the same design, but rather for the naming convention from which most of these ships took their titles. Ruler-class carriers all carried short names of royal title or perhaps political leadership—Ameer, Arbiter, Atheling, Begum, Emperor, Empress, Khedive, Nabob, Premier, Queen, Rajah, Ranee, Ruler, Shah and Thane. I thought this was the entirety of the class, but I was wrong. Included in this group are also Patroller, Puncher, Ravager, Reaper, Searcher, Slinger, Smiter, Speaker, Trouncer and Trumpeter—25 carriers in all.\n\nOnce I started into this, I sort of regretted it, for it soon turned into a massive project—about five times the size of an average story put out on this site. But I kept working on it over many months and despite its 33,000 word length, I think it offers, through photographs and words, a broad glimpse into the role of the escort carrier in the Second World War as well as the lives of the sailors and aircrews that laboured on their steel decks. I offer it here; this homage to the oft-forgotten escort carrier, for your edification and enjoyment, so very grateful that it is over. If you just view half the images, you will have learned much.\n\nIn writing their stories and collecting their images, I used many websites on the internet, but particularly four outstanding websites, run by passionate naval historians whose collected works now represent a window on that world to anyone who might want to look through it. Every time I come across sites like these, I am humbled by the scope of their knowledge and the depth of their commitment to building this knowledge base and sharing it with the world.\n\nThe first is the RoyalNavyResearchArchive.org.uk—a broad and deep website dedicated to telling the stories of the Royal Navy and its ships. Their website claims that “The Royal Navy Research Archive aims to provide a virtual museum, giving access to a range of web materials related to RN ships, establishments, units, and personnel, primarily from the start of World War One through into the 21st century. Content includes articles, short histories and the reminiscences of the men and women who served in the Royal Navy, WRNS, and Royal Marines.” This belies the depth of the passion found in its many pages, and the access to story and image offered the visitor.\n\nThe second site is the brief-yet-informative logs of individual ship movements and assignments found in the pages of Naval-History.net. This wonderful site is an excellent resource to corroborate movements and tasks of each of the Ruler-class carriers. The site makes it very easy to understand the chronology of events from a ship’s launch to its breaking. As well, the photo galleries of Nav-Source.org, which outlines the history of all American ships, were a superb place to find descriptive images. Since all of the Royal Navy’s escort carriers were at one time American ships (albeit very briefly), their stories and images are included in the site’s pages. Lastly, one of my go-to sites is that of the Imperial War Museum in Great Britain. Though their photos have only brief descriptions accompanying the photos, the sheer volume of photographs on their site guarantees that you will find something interesting for every ship.\n\nHere now are the brief histories of each of the Ruler-class escort carriers. Please enjoy what you will of these images and texts. I’m going to bed.—Dave O’Malley\n\nHMS Arbiter (Pennant Number D31)\n\nWhen HMS Arbiter was first launched, she did not come down the ways as Arbiter or even as a Ruler-class carrier in the service of the Royal Navy, but rather as USS St. Simon (CVE-51), an American Prince William-class escort carrier. While nearly all the ships of the Ruler Class were named after cultural heads-of-state (a Scottish Thane, an Arabic Ameer, and an Egyptian Khedive), her name was more a synonym than a title, referring to someone with the power to make a decision or judgment. I suppose that if she was launched in the time of President George W. Bush, she might have been named HMS Decider! She was launched at the Seattle–Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation on 9 September 1943 and went straight away to the Portland Iron Works for completion. While there she was transferred to the Royal Navy on the last day of 1943, under the command of R.C. Harry. Following this work, Arbiter sailed for Vancouver for modifications to Royal Navy standard. While awaiting her turn in the Burrard Dry Dock Co., Ltd. yard, she was in the company of sister ships Queen, Speaker, Ruler, Nabob and Premier, all at various stages of completion.\n\nDuring this first replenishment voyage she issued her aircraft as required and took on board five flyable Corsairs in need of repair. This was not without incident however, as she lost one new Corsair on takeoff and two of the Seafires were rendered unserviceable after a collision on deck. Another Seafire coming aboard was heavily damaged when it struck the island superstructure. After supplying stores to several escort ships, she withdrew to Manus to replenish her stock of aircraft.\n\nOn her second replenishment voyage in August, she dispersed 10 Seafires, 6 Corsairs, one Avenger and one Firefly while landing on an Avenger and 2 Seafires in need of maintenance that could not be carried out on fleet carriers. On this mission, Arbiter also carried out at-sea oiling duties. When her supplies were dispensed, she withdrew from the area and made course for Sydney, Australia.\n\nEn route to Sydney, Arbiter spent a month off the coast of Brisbane carrying out flying training for No. 2 Seafire Conversion Course—with 899 Squadron pilots practicing landing on Arbiter and operating from her deck. This training began on 15 August, the same day that the war against the Japanese ended. After this period she continued on south to Sydney. She remained in Sydney Harbour for a few days and after resupply left for Hong Kong to bring much needed humanitarian stores and medical supplies. After a short stay there, Arbiter boarded both military and civilian Australian prisoners of war, slipped her moorings and brought them safely home to Sydney.\n\nArbiter returned to Hong Kong with more relief supplies on 3 December 1945. She left Hong Kong with former POWs, military personnel and civilians, and began her long journey back to Great Britain via the Suez Canal. She finally dropped anchor at the Tail o’ the Bank moorage on 10 January 1946 and offloaded her passengers. Her war career ended thus.\n\nBy the end of February 1946, Arbiter was back in Norfolk where she was decommissioned and handed back to the US Navy. By April, she was struck off charge and sold to a civilian shipyard where she had her flight deck stripped off and her guts redesigned as a cargo ship called Coracero for an Argentinean shipping company. She would pass through two more shipping companies before she was scrapped in 1973 in Taiwan.\n\nThe name Ameer is but one of many spellings of the word we now spell Emir, as in the United Arab Emirates. This is the traditional name of the tribal or royal head of state in one of several Arab city-states, such as Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Quwain, Abu Dhabi, Al Fujairah and Ras al-Khaimah or the traditional leader of Afghanistan.\n\nThere were two aircraft carriers named HMS Ameer that were built on the West Coast of Washington in the Second World War. The first was built on the template of a Casablanca-class escort carrier in Vancouver, Washington and launched in April 1942. Originally intended for Lend-Lease service with the Royal Navy, the US Navy decided to keep her to meet their own requirements and renamed her USS Liscome Bay. As Liscome Bay, she was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine near the Gilbert Islands the following November with the loss of 644 men.\n\nThe second HMS Ameer fared much better. She was built in Seattle on the Bogue-class standard and was launched in October 1942 and, after completion in the yard, was commissioned the following June for US Navy service as USS Baffins. Baffins’ only voyage was to Vancouver, British Columbia, where she was handed over to the Royal Navy and commissioned immediately as HMS Ameer.\n\nAs with most future West Coast-built escort carriers, Ameer was heavily modified in Vancouver to meet Royal Navy requirements. There was a list of 150 mods that needed to be carried out including the lengthening of the flight deck, safety measures for oil and fuel storage.\n\nFollowing her modification, Ameer worked up her new crew, made a quick voyage to Bremerton, Washington to ammunition the ship and then spent a trials period on the Strait of Georgia, practicing steaming, gunnery, radar, ASDIC and other systems.\n\nIn November of 1943, Ameer left for the Panama Canal, stopping in San Diego for stores and more equipment. After transiting the canal, Ameer dropped anchor at the Port of Cristóbal in the city of Colón, awaiting her sister carrier HMS Atheling, before journeying together to Norfolk, Virginia. Here, both carriers embarked a large number of Lend-Lease aircraft and then sailed for New York to await an eastbound fast convoy. Both carriers sailed on 29 December 1943, Ameer arriving without incident at Greenock.\n\nMost of the escort carriers of the United States and Royal Navies of the Second World War were built in America’s Northwest Coast. There were a number of shipyards participating in keel-up construction as well as post-launch fit up and finishing. Most of the meant-for-US Navy carriers that were then assigned to the Royal Navy through the Lend-Lease programs were further modified for Fleet Air Arm requirements in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nOne of the major shipbuilding enterprises in Washington was the city of Vancouver, across the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon, about 80 miles from the Pacific Ocean. In January of 1943, Vancouver’s Kaiser Shipyard laid down the keel for a Casablanca-class escort carrier, to be named HMS Chastiser. After her launch in April, her name was changed to HMS Begum, a Ruler-class carrier named for a Muslim female royal or aristocratic title from Central or South Asia—the wife of a “Bey” or “Beg”. At the last minute, the US Navy determined that Begum would remain in their service and she was commissioned as USS Natoma Bay.\n\nInstead, the name Begum was transferred to an already completed Bogue-class escort carrier named USS Bolinas. On 2 August 1943, the day she was transferred to the Royal Navy, Bolinas was commissioned as HMS Begum, Royal Navy.\n\nUpon completion of her acceptance trial, Begum made for Esquimalt, British Columbia for modifications for Royal Navy service. These were a large number of alterations, the largest of which was the lengthening of her flight deck. In late December of 1943, work was completed and she made revolutions for Panama, the Canal and eventually Norfolk, Virginia, where she took on a cargo of Lend-Lease Corsairs belonging to 1837 and 1838 Naval Air Squadrons. In addition, she embarked the pilots, other personnel and equipment of said squadrons, both of which had recently completed their work-ups at Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine. From Norfolk, Begum made New York on 16 January 1944.\n\nIn New York, Begum embarked more stores and 194 military passengers as well as 45 civilians, including a group of British school children who had previously been evacuated to Canada for safety reasons and who were now going home. Begum crossed the Atlantic safely in the company of HMS Trumpeter and, after disembarking her passengers in Liverpool, sailed for Greenock, Scotland, dropping anchor in the Clyde, having flown off the aircraft of 1837 and 1838 Squadrons en route.\n\nBy the end of February, she was at Royal Naval Air Repair Yard in Belfast, Northern Ireland loading aircraft. Here she took aboard the aircraft of four squadrons—the Hellcats of 1839 and 1844 Squadrons and Fairey Barracudas of 815 and 817 Squadrons. While the pilots and personnel of these squadrons took passage aboard separate troopships, Begum set sail on 3 March 1944 for Trincomalee to join the swelling air ranks of the Eastern Fleet. She travelled in company with the escort carrier HMS Atheling, heavily escorted in convoy to Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nBy mid-month, after another minelaying operation named GRATIS, they were back in Scapa Flow’s deep protected harbour. Here Premier, in company with the escort carrier Campania, conducted flying training in preparation for Operation WINDED, a night attack on shipping followed by more minelaying off the coast of Norway. Throughout the next month, Premier participated in a series of similar anti-shipping or minelaying operations along the northern coast of Norway. These included Operations WINDED II, SELENIUM I and II, SHRED, GROUNDSHEET, and CUPOLA. This busy period of combat operations took her to late March when she entered the yards at Greenock for repair damage from continuous operations. By mid-April, Premier was anchored again in Scapa.\n\nImmediately she was assigned escort duty as part of Operation ROUNDEL with the escort carrier Vindex shepherding Russia-bound convoy JW66 over the Kola Peninsula and then covering the returning Convoy RA66. Premier was back at the Home Fleet Anchorage on 7 May. 856 Squadron, which had been with Premier since the outset, disembarked their Wildcats and Avengers which flew to RNAS Hatson where, within weeks, they were disbanded, the war in Europe having ended. At the end of May, Premier entered repair dockyards at Greenock where she was to spend five weeks.\n\nFor the next six months following her repair work, Premier carried out deck landing training duties in waters near the Clyde. This period ended in February of 1946.\n\nPremier’s last duty was to repatriate 460 Canadian officers, enlisted men and civilians on her way to Norfolk, Virginia after all of her Royal Navy equipment had been removed. Also on board were 60 damaged airframes destined to be dumped overboard at sea. Had this been wartime, the metal would have been precious, but the fastest way to dispose of unwanted aircraft at that time was disposal at sea. She heaved them overside a day out of the Clyde en route to Halifax. After disembarking her passengers at Halifax, Premier steamed south along the coast, arriving at Norfolk on 3 April 1946.\n\nIt seems that every Royal Navy escort carrier of the Second World War began with at least two identities before becoming a Ruler-class carrier of His Majesty’s Royal Navy. This was so in the case of HMS Queen, built on the keel that was laid down as a C3 mercantile freighter hull in March of 1943 at the Seattle–Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation. As this C3 hull was being built, her future changed when the United States Navy purchased the hull for conversion to a Bogue-class escort carrier to be named USS St. Andrews. Her hull was launched on 31 July, and completed dockside and delivered to the US Navy on 7 December 1943, the second anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. On the same day, she was handed over to the Royal Navy and became HMS Queen.\n\nFollowing her sea trials, she left for Vancouver and the Burrard Dry Dock to receive further modifications to meet Royal Standards for strike carriers. Following this work, Queen made for the Panama Canal, arriving at Miami for a two week visit before sailing for Norfolk where she embarked Avenger aircraft from 855 Squadron. She sailed for the UK, arriving in the Clyde on 23 May 1944. After offloading her cargo of Avengers, she was assigned a return trip to New York where she picked up American aircraft for delivery to Casablanca. These were delivered on 27 June, after which Queen steamed to Freetown, Sierra Leone and then back home to the Clyde via Gibraltar, arriving there at the beginning of August. It was then decided she needed some repair and rectification work done, so she shaped course around Scotland to Dundee where she entered the yard for work.\n\nShe remained in the yard until close to Christmas 1944, then put to sea for trials and shook down en route to Rosyth on the Firth of Forth. Queen was assigned duty with the Home Fleet and sailed back around Scotland to the Clyde to embark the Avengers and Wildcats of 853, a composite Naval Air Squadron. Over the next month, in the relative safety of the Clyde, the crew of Queen worked the pilots of 853 up to operational readiness before departing for Scapa Flow.\n\nOn crossing the Atlantic, she met with severe storms and suffered damage to her flight and hangar decks and her crew suffered from heavy rolling as she proceeded down the East Coast to the Caribbean Sea. Once through the Panama Canal, Ranee headed north to San Diego to load aircraft for the Pacific—but only after repairing the damage she suffered in the Atlantic crossing. In the last week of February, she raised anchor and shaped a course across the Pacific to Hawaii and then Guam. After delivering her aircraft she returned to Hawaii, after which she made another trip back to Guam and the big moorage at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. After all these sea miles, she was ordered back to the United Kingdom via San Diego and then the Panama Canal.\n\nArriving in New York with a ferry load of aircraft that she had picked up in Norfolk, Ranee took on board many passengers—service men as well as women and children returning to Great Britain. Joining the 22 cargo ships of the eastbound Convoy CU-72, she made Glasgow, Scotland on the 4th of June 1945, with the war now over in Europe.\n\nRanee was then nominated for duty as a fleet replenishment carrier with the British Pacific Fleet and began conversion and tropicalization work on the Tyne. This work was underway when, in August, Ranee’s duties were changed to that of a trooping ship. This was considerable more work which required her stay in the yard until November of 1945. The work entailed providing accommodations, toilets and messing for up to 1,000 passengers in addition to her now reduced crew.\n\nFor the next year, Ranee sailed to the South Asia and Australasia three times before ending her Royal Navy career at Norfolk in November of 1946 where she was handed back to the US Navy. She was sold in the summer of 1947 for conversion to a merchantman in Mobile, Alabama and was relaunched as the rather beautiful SS Friesland of the Rotterdam Lloyd Line. She sailed on for twenty years before being resold to a Panamanian concern and renamed SS Pacific Breeze. She went to the scrappers’ yard in 1974.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Ranee carried out trooping duties then was sold for conversion to a cargo ship. She was renamed S.S Friesland (pictured top) and sailed with the Dutch shipping company Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd. She was a fine looking ship. Later, she was sold to a Panamanian concern called the Orient Overseas Line under the name S.S. Pacific Breeze (pictured bottom) and still quite handsome. She went for scrap in 1974 in Taiwan.

War was hell and business was brisk. On 25 March 1943, a new C3 keel being laid down was claimed by the US Navy and work began to convert it from freighter to an escort carrier with the proposed name of USS St. Joseph.\n\nThe newly completed hull was launched five months later, and after completion work was done dockside, she was handed over to the Royal Navy four months later on 22 December. She was commissioned as HMS Ruler and, following sea trials off the coast of Washington, steamed for Vancouver where she underwent the standard modifications to bring her up to the standards then in use by the Royal Navy.\n\nNormally, a new class of ship is named after the first completed example, such as the ships of the Iowa-class battleships of the US Navy. Iowa was first, so her sister ships (New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Missouri) were grouped under her name. I had assumed that Ruler was the first of the many escort carriers with names of royal title… but it was only one of many examples and not the first by any means.\n\nWith her work completed and her crew just beginning to be comfortable, she sailed for the Panama Canal and eventually Norfolk, Virginia, arriving there on 8 April 1944. Here she craned on a full load of Lend-Lease Hellcats, Avengers and Corsairs for Great Britain. Ruler weighed anchor and sailed for New York to await the assembly of eastbound Convoy CU-22, a 31-ship armada of mostly general cargo and tankers. They departed on 22 April and arrived in Liverpool twelve days later.\n\nHaving just crossed the Atlantic, she was sent back three days later to collect more aircraft in New York, this time Hellcats and Avengers. She awaited the assembly of the 34 ships of Convoy CU-26, finally departing again for Liverpool on 31 May and completing the crossing in the typical 12 days. Arriving at Liverpool, she was taken into the yard for a refit. Following this, Ruler re-crossed the Atlantic and arrived at Norfolk in the middle of October to collect yet another load of Hellcats and Corsairs, bound for the UK. She joined the ships of Convoy CU-46, arriving in Liverpool on 18 November 1943. She had crossed the Atlantic six times, but had yet to launch an aircraft or join the shootin’ fight.\n\nFinally, in December of 1944, she got the long-awaited nomination for combat service with the British Pacific Fleet and commenced a period of training with her deck crews and the Hellcats and Avengers of 885 Naval Air Squadron in the Clyde area. This period took her until late January when she provisioned and weighed anchor, bound for Sydney, Australia to take up a new role as a replenishment carrier for the Pacific Fleet. This meant that she would carry spare aircraft in her hangar deck to replace losses in the fleet due to operational activities. These aircraft would be flown off Ruler by her pilot to the carrier needing new airframes. This would mean she would carry aircraft of every type flown in theatre—Corsairs, Hellcats, Avengers and Barracudas. She would also be required to refuel escort vessels from her reserves.\n\nRuler took with her to Australia her 885 Squadron aircraft as well as the Fairey Fireflys of 1772 Naval Air Squadron, arriving in Sydney’s picturesque harbour in the middle of March, flying off the aircraft of both squadrons to Royal Naval Air Station Schofields on the outskirts of Sydney.\n\nHMS Shah (Pennant Number D21)\n\nSailors and naval officers are a superstitious lot if there ever was one, yet, on Friday, 13 November 1942, cranes at the Seattle–Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, swung steel over the launching ways and lowered to the timber cradle, thus beginning the keel of a new C3 merchant hull that was to be requisitioned by the United States Navy for conversion in situ to a Prince William-class escort carrier to be named USS Jamaica. Five months later, her sponsor, Mrs. C.T. Simard cracked a bottle of champagne on her prow and below, yard workers with sledges knocked out the last chocks as she slid down the greased ways and into the water. After launch, she was towed dockside for completion, and when this was finished five months later, she was handed over to the Royal Navy and commissioned as HMS Shah, named for the title given kings and princes in Iran.\n\nFollowing her completion and sea trials, Shah’s new Royal Navy crew took her to Vancouver for the standard modifications to make her suitable for service with Fleet Air Arm aircraft. It was a busy time at the Burrard Dry Dock Co. with Shah sharing the various dock positions with Ameer, Atheling, Begum and Empress. This must have been a dramatic sight along the north shore of Burrard Inlet. The modifications were many. The Royal Navy Research Archive states: “… this work totalled 150 separate modifications and included lengthening of the flight deck, fitting redesigned flying controls and fighter direction layout, modifications to hangar, accommodation and store rooms, installing extra safety measures including major changes to the aviation fuel stowage and oiling at sea arrangements, modifying gunnery and other internal communications, adding extra W/T and R/T sets, and improved darken ship arrangements.” This work would take two months.\n\nThe following two weeks were spent shaking down the ship, its systems and crews. Unlike most of the Royal Navy escort carriers built on the West Coast, Shah did not make a maiden voyage to Norfolk on the East Coast, but rather was impressed into immediate service as a ferry carrier. She sailed for San Francisco where she loaded the 12 Avengers of 851 Naval Air Squadron, as well as a large ferry load of airframes destined for the East Indies—32 Wildcats and 22 P-40 Warhawks. This long first voyage would take her to Cochin, India via Melbourne, Australia. She left San Francisco on 15 January and reached Cochin on 15 February, making Cochin on the 23rd of February.\n\nHMS Thane (Pennant Number D83)\n\nOf all the names of the Ruler-class escort carriers of the Royal Navy, it is the name of His Majesty’s Ship Thane that made me smile the most, bringing to mind the lines spoken by the three witches over their cauldron “All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Glamis! … All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! … All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!” Thane was the title given to a local royal official in medieval eastern Scotland, equivalent in rank to the son of an earl, who was at the head of an administrative and socio-economic unit known as a shire or thanage.\n\nAs did all carriers of this class, Thane rose from the launching ways cradle (starting in February 1943) as a C3-class merchant hull that was requisitioned by the United States Navy and set on a course of conversion to a Bogue-class escort carrier with the rather gentle name of USS Sunset. Less than five months later, Sunset slid smoothly into the waters of Commencement Bay, and was towed to a dock for completion. It took another four months to complete her and, never commissioned in the United States Navy, Sunset was transferred to the Royal Navy under Lend-Lease on 19 November 1943 and renamed the more regal Thane.\n\nFollowing sea trials and a shakedown cruise, Thane then steamed with a small crew to Vancouver for further Royal Navy tweaks to her systems and structure, arriving there in the first week of December. While in Vancouver, her full crew began arriving and she was moved to the Burrard terminal to act as an accommodation ship—rows and stacks of bunks lining her hangar deck, accommodating arriving sailors for three other carriers (Arbiter, Queen and Speaker) that were undergoing the modification process. She carried out this duty for four months. Finally, in early April, Thane moved to a berth where her own modification work could begin.\n\nAt the beginning of November, Thane sailed with Convoy KMF.36, a massive troop convoy heading to Gibraltar, the Mediterranean and Alexandria with 18 troopships carrying a total of nearly 42,000 men. After reaching Alexandria, Thane detached from the convoy and continued on to Port Said, where she offloaded her cargo of Hellcats and Avengers then took aboard the personnel and aircraft from 831 and 834 Squadrons for the voyage back to the Clyde. She was back in the Firth of Clyde by the end of the first week of December 1944. Ten days later, she was crossing the Atlantic again to pick up the men and aircraft of the newly formed 1851 Squadron, whose 18 Corsairs came with them.\n\nAt the end of December in Norfolk, Thane took delivery of aircraft to be ferried including nine Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly helicopters, the first for the Royal Navy. These were flown on board and stowed in the hangar spaces. In all, Thane carried 84 aircraft and left for New York on New Year’s Eve, arriving there the following day and joining the assembly of Convoy CU-53, a 33-ship group with general cargo and troopships, bound for Le Havre and destinations in Great Britain. With her in the crossing was the carrier HMS Trouncer. It was a particularly rough passage, and the entire convoy spent some time hove to. As the convoy approached Great Britain, Thane detached and moved on to Belfast to offload her cargo of aircraft and squadron personnel, then on to the Clyde where she was to repair damage from the crossing.\n\nOn the short voyage from Belfast, across the North Channel to the Firth of Clyde, Thane was torpedoed by U-1172 under the command of Kaptainleutnant Jürgen Kehlmann. She was in the swept channel at the time, just approaching the Clyde Light Ship, an area where she would have felt very safe. The torpedo hit her starboard aft quarter, just below the gun sponson. The explosion tore the sponson and perhaps its crew clean off the side of the ship and damaged the hull severely. Ten men were killed as well as 25 injured. She was dead in the water and had to be towed inside the submarine nets by the frigate HMS Loring.\n\nHer aircraft were craned off (except most of the helicopters which were flown off), her ammunition removed (a huge and dangerous task), sailors given shore leave and marine engineers came to assess the damage after she was put in dry dock. Thane was deemed too damaged to be worthwhile repairing and was towed to Faslane at the top of the Gare Loch where she was stored awaiting her future. She never flew off or landed a single aircraft during her service life, unless the helicopters are included.\n\nBy the end of 1945, HMS Thane had been handed back to the United States Navy and then sold for the scrap value of her steel. It was not a sublime sunset for the carrier that once carried that name.\n\nHMS Smiter was a Ruler-class escort carrier built originally as a type C3 cargo vessel hull as were most of the Bogue/Ruler-class escort carriers. The Type C3 hull is described by Wikipedia as follows: “Type C3-class ships were the third type of cargo ship designed by the United States Maritime Commission (MARCOM) in the late 1930s. As it had done with the Type C1 ships and Type C2 ships, MARCOM circulated preliminary plans for comment. The design presented was not specific to any service or trade route, but was a general purpose ship that could be modified for specific uses.” She was converted to a Bogue-class carrier during her build and was launched in September of 1943 as USS Vermillion, named for Vermillion Bay, Louisiana on the Gulf of Mexico. She was transferred to the Royal Navy in mid-January 1944 and renamed HMS Smiter—one of my favourite names! An interesting bit of trivia—there are 133 instances of the word smite in the Bible (e.g.: “Vex the Midianites, and smite them!” (Book of Numbers)). After arriving in Great Britain, she was selected for ferry carrier duties. She made only one more crossing before she was taken in hand for repairs. This lasted until October 1944 when she was nominated for aircraft landing training duties in the Clyde, which she carried out until December, when she went in for more repair work and refit for convoy escort duty and sent to South East Asia, arriving at Trincomalee at war’s end. In April 1946, she was back in Norfolk and in the hands of the US Navy. She was sold and converted to commercial use as SS Artillero (bottom photo). In 1965 she was sold again and became SS President Garcia with the Philippine President Line. In 1967, she ran aground at Saints Bay on the Isle of Guernsey, and was heavily damaged structurally, written off and salvaged for scrap. Photos: Top: NavSource.org; Bottom: ShipSpotting.com"
