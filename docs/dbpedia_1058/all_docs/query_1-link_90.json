        "text": "William “Mike” Michael Davis\n\nJanuary 2, 1956 ~ January 24, 2018\n\nWilliam “Mike” Michael Davis, 62, passed away unexpectedly on Wednesday, January 24, 2018, following a brief illness.\n\nHe was born January 2, 1956 in Gardena, California, the son of William Coleman and Joy Ann Proctor Davis.\n\nMike served our country honorably in the U.S. Air Force, retiring as a Master Sargeant after 20 years of distinguished service.\n\nHe married the love of his life, Peggy Sue Johns on February 12, 1977 in East Tawas, Michigan, and they raised two children together, whom they could count on for anything. Mike and Peggy made their home in many places while he served in the military and settled in North Ogden, which they love.\n\nMike worked for Ogden City as a building inspector for many years and made close friends while he was there who will remember him for his integrity and kindness, as well as his friendly banter.\n\nMike was a quick witted, lovingly sarcastic, hard working man with a great sense of humor - he did all his teasing in a positive way. He also loved woodworking, fishing, occasionally actually catching fish, and spending memorable weekends at Flaming Gorge. Most of all, Mike enjoyed spending time with his five grandchildren, Hailey, Bethany, Jacob, Alexander, and Hayden.\n\nMike is survived by his wife of nearly 41 years, Peggy Davis of North Ogden; son, Jesse R. (Casandra Brown) Davis, Franklin, IN; daughter, Heather (Tyson) Larsen, Roy; brothers, Lennie Davis, Roy; and Greg (Lori) Davis, Norwalk, CA; and his Maui family, Trisha Davis and Jovie and Edgard Martin. He was preceded in death by his father, William and mother, Joy Henry and her husband, Willard Henry, who was a wonderful dad to him; as well as by his brother, Steve Davis and sister-in-law, Dorothy Davis.\n\nThe family thanks the doctors, surgeons, and expert support staff of McKay-Dee Hospital for all their care. A very special thank you to Jeremy Gillen, RN, for his unwavering compassion and care throughout this difficult time.\n\nAt Mike’s request, private services are being held by the family.\n\nArrangements entrusted to Lindquist's Ogden Mortuary."
