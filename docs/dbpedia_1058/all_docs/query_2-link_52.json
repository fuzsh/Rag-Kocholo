Remove this notice when finished.\n\nThe Spanish Royal Navy, also known as the Spanish Navy or the Spanish Armada, was the naval armed force of the Spanish Empire and one of the oldest active naval forces in the world. Most notably under the reign of King Ferdinand, the Spanish Armada was responsible for a number of major historic achievements in navigation. For several centuries, it played a crucial logistical role in the expansion and consolidation of the Spanish Empire, and defended a vast trade network across the Atlantic Ocean between the Americas and Europe, and across the Pacific Ocean between Asia and the Americas. The Spanish Navy was one of the most powerful maritime forces in the world from the 16th century to the 18th century. Reform under the Bourbon dynasty improved its logistical and military capacity in the 18th century, for most of which Spain possessed the world's third largest navy.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigin and early history[]\n\nThe Spanish Royal Navy was organized immediately after the Spanish discovery of the New World in 1492. When other nations of Europe started to make colonies in the Americas, a Spanish Treasure Fleet was organized to safely transport silver and gold from the Caribbean to Spain.\n\nIn 1588, the Spanish King Philip II attempted to invade England, but his fleet, called the Invincible Armada, was defeated by the English Navy squadron led by several notorious English sea rovers, Francis Drake among them.\n\nIn the 1630s, the Spanish Royal Navy in the Caribbean was lead by admiral Joaquin Da Saldanha.[4] Twenty years later, sensing the decline of Spanish power, the English dictator, Oliver Cromwell, initiated the Anglo-Spanish War (1654). The English Royal Navy inflicted several defeats on the Spanish Armada in the Caribbean, and helped England seize the island of Jamaica. This was to be the beginning of minor losses of islands to other powers in the Caribbean, that were used as bases for attacks on Spanish New World towns and shipping by English, French and Dutch pirates and privateers.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, a prominent member of the Spanish Royal Navy was Admiral Maldonado, who led the armada of a hundred ships and mercilessly hunted pirates in the Caribbean. However, his ruthless campaign gave rise to one of the most notorious pirates in the Caribbean, Captain James Sterling.[3]\n\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), Spain was an ally of France, but that didn't stop British privateers led by Benjamin Hornigold and Edward Teach to capture Spanish merchant ships in the Caribbean. The Franco-Spanish alliance was dissolved a few years after the war. In 1720, during the War of the Quadruple Alliance, the Spanish Royal Navy attempted to capture New Providence, the seat of the British power in the Bahamas. However, the attack was repelled by local militia, which was composed mainly of former pirates.\n\nAt one point during his pirate career, Captain Jack Sparrow impersonated an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, which eventually became one of the notorious pirate's many crimes listed in his death sentence.[10]\n\nThe Salazars[]\n\nOne of the leaders of the Spanish Navy in the Caribbean was Admiral Salazar, a corrupt officer who let the pirates evade justice as long as they gave him gold and silver in exchange. One day he was arrested for treason and imprisoned. He was released from prison a year after his wife's death, but when the disgraced admiral returned home he was killed by his own son, Armando Salazar.[11]\n\nThe young Spaniard swore vengeance on pirates who had destroyed his family and joined the Spanish Navy, eventually becoming the most feared pirate hunter in the history of Spain. Commanding a loyal crew aboard the mighty galleon, the Silent Mary, Armando Salazar destroyed dozens of pirate ships. Salazar became known as \"El Matador del Mar\", the Butcher of the Sea as he successfully brought piracy in the Caribbean to the brink of extinction until young Jack the Sparrow defeated Salazar.[7][8]\n\nQuest for the Shadow Gold[]\n\nIn the late 1710s, the Spanish Navy made a deal with the Spanish Pirate Lord, Eduardo Villanueva, who promised them that he'll drive out the English and the French from the Caribbean forever. He also promised that he'll sink every pirate ship in the Caribbean.[5] But that plan was ruined by another Pirate Lord, Jack Sparrow, who stole the gold with which the Spanish intended to pay Villanueva.\n\nA few months later, the Spanish Royal Navy participated in the battle for the Shadow Gold, controlled by the alchemist known as the Shadow Lord. The Shadow Lord was defeated, and so was the Spanish fleet. After the battle, the Spanish princess Carolina took one of the Spanish ships for herself and named it the Sparrow, in honor of her former captain, the Pirate Lord Jack Sparrow.[12]\n\nThe Condenados[]\n\nA pair of identical warships was built for the Spanish Navy, the San Pablo and the San Miguel. The two ships were the pride of Spanish Navy, but during the night of the full moon, both ships disappeared without a trace. However, according to legends, the vanished ships would reappear from time to time, pursuing other ships, and every pursuit would end with the sinking of every captured vessel. Because of these legends, the San Pablo and the San Miguel became known as the Condenados, the Damned.[13]\n\nThreat of a sea god[]\n\nAt some point during Hector Barbossa's quest to lift the Aztec curse, the Spanish Armada managed to capture Palaimon, the Greek sea god who fed on human souls. Trapped and shackled, Palaimon was taken aboard the fishing vessel Delfin. However, he managed to devour the souls of the ship's crewmen, and the rest of the ships in the fleet opened fire on the Delfin, destroying it completely.[14]\n\nWar of Garcia and Pierre[]\n\nIn the 1720s, a privateer war erupted between the French colony of Ille D'Etable De Porc and Isla De La Avaricia, a war which cost the Spanish Royal Navy many of its ships. The sunken ships were later raised from their watery graves by an undead pirate captain Jolly Roger. They were later organized into the Spanish Ghost Fleet, commanded by Roger's minions.[15] However, despite these losses, the Spanish Royal Navy remained a powerful force in the Caribbean.\n\nQuest for the Fountain of Youth[]\n\nIn 1750, upon gaining possession of the ship's log of Ponce de León, King Ferdinand VI sent The Spaniard and his loyal crew of the Spanish Armada in a quest for the Fountain of Youth. Throughout the quest, The Spaniard's fleet sailed past the HMS Providence, captained by privateer Hector Barbossa, and made camp in the abandoned Fort San Miguel, where they examined the Chalices of Cartagena and dealt with Barbossa and pirate Jack Sparrow. Ultimately, the quest was successful for the Spanish, who managed to destroy the Fountain.[2]\n\nSymbols[]\n\nThe most prominent symbol of the Spanish Royal Navy was the Flag of Spain, which was usually flown from the mainmasts of the Spanish ships. Another flag, known as the Cross of Burgundy, was used in the time of war. The ships also flew pennants of different colors. Aside from that, the sails of the Spanish Navy ships were often decorated with the coat of arms of the Spanish Monarchy, or with the great Catholic cross and the lion from the coat of arms of León.[2]\n\nNotable vessels[]\n\nSilent Mary[8]\n\nSantiago[citation needed]\n\nCarrera de la Vega's ship[6]\n\nSpaniard's ship[2]\n\nUnnamed Spanish galleon[citation needed]\n\nCenturion[9]\n\nMaldonado's ship[3]\n\nSpanish Blood Scourge[citation needed]\n\nSpanish Cerberus[citation needed]\n\nSpanish Shadow Crow[citation needed]\n\nProwler[citation needed]\n\nNuestra Señora de la Inspiración Divina[citation needed]\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThe Spanish Royal Navy first appeared in the 2003 video game Pirates of the Caribbean.[citation needed] In Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, the Town Clerk mentioned the Spanish Royal Navy during Jack Sparrow's hanging.[10] The name \"Spanish Armada\" was first used in the 2006 video game Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow.[6] \"Spanish navy\" was first used in Legends of the Brethren Court: The Caribbean.[16]\n\nIn Pirates of the Caribbean Online, Spanish privateer ships are easily recognizable by their red and yellow sails.\n\nThe Spanish Navy was meant to appear in the video game Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned and at least be mentioned in the graphic novel Six Sea Shanties, which were both scheduled to be released in 2011.[3][14] But since both were cancelled, it is unknown if their appearances are canon or not.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nPirates of the Caribbean (2003 video game) (First appearance)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned\n\nThe Price of Freedom (Indirect mention only)\n\nLegends of the Brethren Court: The Caribbean\n\nLegends of the Brethren Court: Rising in the East (Mentioned only)\n\nLegends of the Brethren Court: Wild Waters (Mentioned only)\n\nLegends of the Brethren Court: Day of the Shadow\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (video game)\n\nSix Sea Shanties: Strangers Bearing Gifts (Mentioned only)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (First mentioned) (First identified as Spanish Royal Navy)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow (First identified as Spanish Armada)\n\nGoing Overboard!\n\nPirates of the Caribbean Online\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (junior novelization)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Novelization\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales: Movie Graphic Novel\n\nLEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game (Non-canonical appearance)\n\nSources[]\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides: The Visual Guide\n\n[]\n\nSpanish Navy on Wikipedia"
