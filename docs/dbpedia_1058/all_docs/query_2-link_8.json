        "text": "Davis History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nFrance\n\nIreland\n\nIsrael\n\nWales\n\nThe Welsh Davis surname is a patronymic, meaning \"son of David.\" Ultimately derived from the Hebrew name \"David,\" meaning \"beloved,\" the name became a popular given name throughout Medieval Europe due to the biblical King David of Israel. The popularity of the name was further increased in Britain due to it being the name of the Patron Saint of Wales. Little is known about Saint David, but he is thought to have been a 6th century monk and bishop. The name came to be used as a patronymic name by the Brythonic people of Wales. One of the most famous bearers of this personal name in Wales was David ap Gruffydd, the last Prince of North Wales, who was executed in 1276 by King Edward I of England.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Davis family\n\nThe surname Davis was first found in Flintshire (Welsh: Sir y Fflint), a historic county, created after the defeat of the Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd in 1284, and located in north-east Wales, where the distinguished Davis family held a family seat from very ancient times.\n\nThey were descended from Cynrig Efell, Lord of Eglwysegle, the twin son of Madog ab Maredadd, the great grandson of Bleddyn ap Cynvin, Prince of Powys, head of the honorable and worthy third Royal Tribe of Wales, who was traitorously murdered in 1073 by the men of Ystrad Tywi, after he had governed all of Wales for 13 years.\n\nDirectly descended from this line was John ap Davydd (John Davies of Gwasanau in the county of Flint).\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Davis family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Davis research. Another 65 words (5 lines of text) covering the years 1550, 1575, 1600, 1605, 1623, 1625, 1633, 1646, 1648, 1667, 1670, 1672, 1675, 1680, 1687, 1688, 1689, 1690, 1692, 1693, 1715, 1716, 1718, 1719, 1722, 1739, 1760 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Davis History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nDavis Spelling Variations\n\nThe Welsh have an extremely large amount of spelling variations of their native surnames to their credit. It was up to the priest or the scribe taking the official records to determine how the spoken name was to be made literal. As time progressed, the old Brythonic names of Wales were recorded in English, which was especially problematic since the English language had extreme difficulty recording the highly inflected sounds of Cymraeg. Spelling variations were, however, also carried out according to an individual's design: a branch loyalty within the family, a religious adherence, or even patriotic affiliations could be indicated by spelling variations of one's name. The spelling variations of the name Davis have included Davies, Davis, Divis and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Davis family\n\nProminent amongst the family during the late Middle Ages was\n\nJohn Davis (1550-1605), an English navigator who discovered the Falkland Islands and what is now known as the Davis Strait\n\nJames Davis (c. 1575-c. 1623) an English ship captain and author who was part of the expedition of the Virginia Company of Plymouth which established Popham Colony, also called \"Northern Virginia\"\n\nEdward Davis or Davies (fl. c. 1680-1688) was an English buccaneer active in the Caribbean during the 1680's\n\nJoseph Davis, (fl. 1692-1715), a Welsh captain in the Hudson's Bay Company who was dismissed because he was unable to deliver a year's worth of goods due to an ice jam\n\nDavis World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Davis is the 6th most popular surname with an estimated 1,193,760 people with that name. 1 However, in Canada, the name Davis is ranked the 58th most popular surname with an estimated 35,809 people with that name. 2 And in Quebec, Canada, the name Davis is the 863rd popular surname. 3 Newfoundland, Canada ranks Davis as 60th with 429 people. 4 Australia ranks Davis as 23rd with 51,740 people. 5 New Zealand ranks Davis as 21st with 6,052 people. 6 The United Kingdom ranks Davis as 52nd with 78,574 people. 7 South Africa ranks Davis as 723rd with 9,461 people. 8\n\nMigration of the Davis family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Davis family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 201 words (14 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nDavis migration to the United States +\n\nDuring the latter half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the people of Wales journeyed to North America to find a new life.

The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 17\n\nDavis Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nEdward Davis, who landed in Barbados in 1671 9\n\nHenery Davis, aged 18, who arrived in Barbados in 1682 9\n\nDavis Settlers in West Indies in the 18th Century\n\nAnthony Davis, who arrived in Jamaica in 1757 9\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Davis (post 1700) +\n\nSpencer David Nelson Davis (1939-2020), Welsh musician and founder of the 1960s beat band the Spencer Davis Group\n\nDavid Brion Davis (1927-2018), American authority on slavery and abolition in the Western world and is the Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University, he was awarded the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction\n\nBarry Davis (1943-2024), Australian rules footballer who played in the Victorian Football League (1961-1975)\n\nCalvin Davis (1972-2023), American athlete who won the bronze medal in the men's 400 meter hurdles at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia\n\nRomay Davis (1919-2024), née Johnson, an American Congressional Gold Medal recipient known for her service in the first all-female, all-black unit in the United States Army that was deployed overseas during World War II\n\nSir Andrew Frank Davis CBE (1944-2024), English chief conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\nVontae Ottis Davis (1988-2024), American professional NFL football player who played as a cornerback for the Miami Dolphins, Indianapolis Colts and Buffalo Bills\n\nNatalie Zemon Davis CC (1928-2023), Canadian-American historian of the early modern period\n\nWalter Pearl Davis (1954-2023), American professional NBA basketball player\n\nShaun Davis (1966-2023), British bodybuilder, Mr. Universe in 1996\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Heb Dhuw heb ddym, Dhuw a digon\n\nMotto Translation: Without God without anything, God is enough.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Davis +\n\nFrom the Rhondda Valley to the Clinch River Valley and Beyond: A Genealogy of the Descendants of John Davies (also Daivis) by Billie Ruth McNamara.\n\nAmos Williams Davis: Family History, Including His Ancestors and Descendants by Eunice Freese Payne.\n\nCitations +\n\n\"What are the 5,000 Most Common Last Names in the U.S.?\".
