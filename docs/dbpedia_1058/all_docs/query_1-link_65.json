        "text": "On April 22, 2023, Bill Davis, age 94, completed his mortal journey. Bill was born November 21, 1928, to William (Bill) Vernon Davis and Allie Mae (Wallace) Davis in Picher, Oklahoma. The family moved several times over a 20-year period from Arkansas to California and back again, finally settling in Southern California in the early 1950s. Bill was the oldest of 4 children and grew up with a strong work ethic. He had two paper routes before school and worked in his aunt’s restaurant after school. Summers, he would also work on a ranch preparing chickens for market. At age 14, he helped purchase property in Colton, California which was later sold to build homes. Bill met Ruby Jolley in London, Arkansas and were married on July 31, 1950, in Russellville, Arkansas. Shortly after marrying, they moved to Chula Vista, California.\n\nBill worked with his family as a painter for two years, eventually obtaining his general contractor license in 1953. Bill and Ruby moved to Oxnard, California where Bill became a sub-contractor for the military. In 1957, they were relocated to Oklahoma City and Bill would travel throughout Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico overseeing the construction of military housing. In 1960, they returned to California, settling in Loma Linda. Bill would continue to work throughout Southern California as a contractor, a sub-contractor for large track home developments and continuing his work for the military.\n\nBill was the hardest working man his family had ever known. He was always willing to help others get their start in the construction field. He also helped his neighbors and family with home projects and loved to teach everyone he met how to play dice games. Bill had an amazing sense of humor and would always say “laughter is like medicine”. Bill was a faithful man, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who loved Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ deeply. He enjoyed spending time with his family, working in the garden, watching Westerns or WWII movies and shopping for good deals.\n\nBill was proceeded in death by his wife Ruby Davis; his parents; brother Paul Davis; sister Helen Joyce Edelman; and 2 nieces and 2 nephews. He is survived by his daughter Jan Finch (Robert) of Clovis; brother Joe Davis (Jeanece) of Austin Texas; sister-in-law Ruth Lem of Ozark Arkansas. His grandchildren Kyle Finch (Vanessa); Jared Finch (Taylor); and Sara Avery (Jeffrey Westra). Great granddaughter Riley Finch; 12 nieces and 7 nephews; and his loving dog Paco.\n\nServices are Saturday October 21, 2023 at 1:30 PM PDT at Montecito Memorial Park"
