His breadth of serving experience has given him a vast understanding through personal lived experience from corporal to senior officer. He has had exposure to senior leadership, both at station level and Air Force Board gaining an understanding of the thought process of senior leaders.\n\nHe is also a specialized Exercise Rehabilitation Instructor, having served at DMRC Headley Court on three occasions and he is currently serving at DMRC Stanford Hall as Officer Commanding the Joint Services School of Exercise Rehabilitation Instructors, giving him an understanding of those that are injured and the concerns and issues that they face.

She completed all her medical training through the Service and has been a qualified General Practitioner (GP) for 10 years. Until recently she has been in clinical roles, rotating around RAF stations at Brize Norton, Benson and Odiham. Her current staff role encompasses being the Medical Officer Profession Advisor, trainee line manager, appraisal & revalidation lead for RAF Doctors as well as supporting doctors in difficulty. Although not in a practice role, Sophie continues with clinical work to maintain currency. She is passionate about being a Service Doctor, in particular the opportunity to offer plenty of time to patients, develop mutual understanding and the wider holistic care that extends to loved ones.\n\nWith each assignment she has volunteered to be the practice Welfare lead Doctor, regularly referring to, and meeting with the Station Welfare Committee to see what further support could be offered for each case to help make a difference. This role introduced her to the breadth of support available through the RAF Benevolent Fund. Many on the welfare register were long-term sick or awaiting medical discharge and she works closely with Transition Support Flight to help these personnel through uncertainty, ensuring continuity of care and providing seamless transition of care at the most appropriate time to NHS Services.\n\nAs she has progressed through Deputy and Senior Medical Officer roles, Sophie has also assumed the practice Safeguarding Lead role, assisting with case management should any child or vulnerable adult safeguarding concerns arise. Sophie Allen is the Welfare & Safeguarding Trustee.\n\nRachel Prendergast\n\nRachel’s spouse has served in the Royal Air Force for over twenty years and this has given her the opportunity to gain lived experience as a family member. Over this time, she has embraced the opportunities and challenges of service life and has learnt to be able to change and adapt in ways that many outside of the Service find hard to comprehend.\n\nAs her family expanded and moved overseas to the USA, she used her personal and professional experience to support others in their transition into and out of postings in America. Upon their return, she used this knowledge to feed back via a number of forums and focus groups to help inform the work to improve the experience for families returning to the UK.\n\nThroughout her time as a spouse of a serving member of the RAF, Rachel and her family have benefitted from the work of the Fund. Her children have played in play parks provided by the Fund and attended Ben Club and Airplay sessions at three different Stations. She has also used the wellbeing and counselling services. Having access to these has directly improved her family’s lived experience of the Royal Air Force.\n\nRachel also has experience as a senior communications professional (Lloyds Banking Group, Thomas Cook Group, Citigroup Inc) and has also been a volunteer RAF representative for the British Embassy Support Association in Washington DC during her spouse’s posting to the Pentagon, where she supported RAF families already in or arriving to the USA. Rachel Prendergast is a trustee with lived RAF experience.\n\nLady Meri Mayhew\n\nLady Mayhew previously served at several RAF Stations as an Air Traffic Control Officer between 1989 and 2003, which included overseas detachments to operational theatres such as Kabul International Airport.\n\nShe also accompanied her husband on an overseas posting to the USA, and on postings in the UK. This enabled her to gain lived experience of life in the RAF as a serving person and continuing today as the spouse of a serving person.\n\nHer first charity sector role was the Chief Executive of a local independent charity, and she has remained in the third sector since, both in paid and unpaid roles. She passionately believes in the value that the third sector brings to society and the vital importance it has in supporting peoples’ lives. She has worked at the Forces in Mind Trust and was seconded into the Ministry of Defence as the Charity Adviser on the Veterans Strategy, ensuring that the role of the charity sector was represented accurately in the Veterans Strategy and that it was based on robust evidence.\n\nLady Mayhew now has her own consultancy and has been a member of the Fund’s Main Grants Committee since 2019. Whilst this will be her first trustee role she feels ready and keen to become a trustee, contributing fully and developing her learning and skills in this area. Lady Meri Mayhew is a trustee with lived RAF experience."
