        "text": "Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth has said farewell to its Volunteer Band Instructor.\n\nSimon 'Sid' Davis, who is retiring after three years conducting the group, has motor neurone disease and is relocating to Scotland with his wife Maggie.\n\nHis highlights as leader include picking up 'Best Band' at the Royal Naval Volunteer Band Association Festival in 2018 and producing an acclaimed performance at the 'Proms in the Park' concert for Dartmouth Regatta in 2019, the Royal Navy said.\n\nCurrent band members contributed to a cheque for £860, presented to Mr Davis in recognition of his \"commitment, friendship, leadership and musicianship\".\n\nThe Royal Navy said Mr Davis will be \"sorely missed\" not only by the band but also as an active member of the Dartmouth community where \"he has contributed greatly, in his role as manager, to the success of the Flavel Arts Centre\".\n\nAttending the farewell on Thursday 1 April were Commanding Officer, Captain Roger Readwin RN, the college's Executive Officer, Commander William Peters RN and Graham Holman – who has temporarily taken over leadership of the band.\n\nThe Volunteer Band says it is looking forward to its return later this year, with its first outing scheduled for 27 August – a repeat performance at 'Proms in the Park' at Dartmouth Regatta.\n\nMotor neurone disease describes a group of diseases that affect the nerves – motor neurones – in the brain and spinal cord that tell the muscles what to do."
