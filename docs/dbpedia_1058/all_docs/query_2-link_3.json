        "text": "A heroin addict who bludgeoned a 92-year-old war veteran to death in his home has been jailed for at least 20 years.\n\nJurors at Wolverhampton crown court took four hours to unanimously convict Charlotte Frazier-Doody of the murder of Dunkirk hero Bill Davis, who served in the Royal Navy throughout the second world war.\n\nJailing the mother-of-three for life, Judge John Warner described the killing in Willenhall, near Walsall, as a savage, ferocious and harrowing attack on a frail and vulnerable victim.\n\nDavis, a great-grandfather who lived independently despite his age, was beaten to death a few days after his 92nd birthday at his home in Willenhall in April.\n\nFrazier-Doody, who lived in the same street, told the trial she had played no role in Davis's death and had instead cooked him a meal.\n\nThe 36-year-old, who was also addicted to crack cocaine, used a heavy weapon – possibly a saucepan – to kill Davis, who was awarded nine medals during the war.\n\nJurors heard he rose to the rank of petty officer as he served on Arctic convoys, took part in the relief of Malta and fought against the Japanese in the Pacific.\n\nPassing sentence on Frazier-Doody, Warner said Davis had been \"savagely beaten to death\" with a substantial object in what should have been the safety of his own home.\n\nHe had either been attacked while on the floor, the judge said, or the attack had continued after he was knocked to the ground.\n\nForensic evidence proved Davis, who died from multiple head and brain injuries, had grabbed a clump of Frazier-Doody's hair as he tried to defend himself.\n\nThe two-week trial also heard that investigators recovered \"billion-to-one\" DNA evidence from the scene, including a mixed bloodstain matching both Frazier-Doody and Davis.\n\nThe judge told Frazier-Doody: \"In my judgment, the motive for this frenzied attack remains a mystery. There are no signs that any of the easily available money was taken.\n\n\"Only two people know the true circumstances of what happened on that day – one of them is no longer with us and you have not provided any information.\"\n\nDetective Sergeant Rob Bastin, the senior investigating officer, said: \"How tragic that after he fought for many years to ensure the safety of every person in this country, he died in his own home, a place where he should have been safe.\"\n\nThomas Davis, the victim's son, said: \"My father was a well-respected and likable man who never did anyone any harm.\""
