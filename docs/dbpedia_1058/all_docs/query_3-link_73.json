On behalf of the boy’s father, a priest or a relative takes a few ornaments and rupees to the girl’s parents.

A girl is forcibly dragged away from a fair ground of a festival meeting. Immediately the boy’s father deputes two men to see the girl’s father. To seek their apology for the outrage committed by his son. He then ask them to make amends in terms of money known as ‘Izzat’, it varies from Rs 100 to Rs. 500.\n\nDam Chalshish: lovers elope together. But after settlement, a normal marriage follows.

His head must point to the north as soon as death occurs and conch shells are blown, which signals for the relatives to burst out crying & reach the house of the deceased.\n\nWhile carrying body to cremation ground, after reaching the halfway a ceremony known as Ardhmargi is performed. There the body is laid down for few minutes.\n\nClose relatives observe Patak during this period the use of things like meat, Fish, Garlic, Onions is\n\nBefore consigning the body to the flames a Pind Dan (ritual feeding of balls made of Cooked Rice, Sesame Seeds and curds to the birds).\n\nIt is considered favorable to add fuel wood (Lakri Pana) to the pyre.\n\nOn 10th day clothes are washed (kapad-Dhulai) & Holy Garud Purana is recited by a Purohit.\n\nIf one dies an untimely death, a special ritual called Sapindi is performed.\n\nIt is only in Kinnaur where three forms of customs were performed regarding death of a person.\n\nDubant : Drowning the dead body in a river.\n\nBhakhant: Throwing the dead body in open field and let it be eaten by vultures and birds.\n\nPhukant: Burning the dead body.\n\nIn Kinnaur, when someone dies, all villagers get together at his house at night this custom is known at “Drum Rating”. The dead body is then bathed in a large vessel called “Lam kunyal”. Gautam sharma Vyathit has made elaborate discussion on these ceremonies in his book ‘Folklore of himachal pradesh’.\n\nWhile carrying body to cremation ground, the legs of the body are turned behind at the knees with the help of wooden pegs. It is believed that if the legs are straight, an evil spirit might enter the body.\n\nIn the cremation ground, lama holds the head of the body by the hair and recites prayer (Foa) in his ears.\n\nOn 3rd day after death, the Chholya ceremony and on 13th day Dam kochang ceremony like kriya ceremony is performed.\n\nA year after the death, lama performs the Fulayach (or the Dalhyang) ceremony.\n\nIn Lahaul valley if an old man dies, no one touches the body till lama arrives.
