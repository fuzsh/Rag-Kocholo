        "text": "When in Himachal Pradesh, do as the Himachalis do and feast on the dham or live to regret it. The dham is in essence a saatvik vegetarian thali, that borrows from the history and traditions of the region. Its offerings are varied across regions and it forms an integral part of weddings and other celebrations. And now, the dham is moving out of its local context to find a place on tables across India.\n\n“For us Himachalis, food is an emotion and the dham is the best of that”\n\nThe beginnings of the Himachali dham are storied and go back over a millennia to the time of King Jaistambh of Chamba. Legend has it that he was so enamoured by the wazwaan feast in Kashmir that he asked his botis or cooks to prepare a similar spread back home, but without meat. Their endeavours resulted in a sacred meal called the dham—seven to eight dishes, made sans onion or garlic and served on a pattal or leaf plate. Today, it has gone from being temple fare to finding its way into banquets and other celebratory tables. In fact, on a wedding day in Himachal, it is a common sight to see botis cooking the dham in large brass charotis or cauldrons, sometimes as early as 4 am!\n\nSherry Mehta, a chef who runs a food delivery service called Kanak by Sherry, whose pioneering efforts have taken the dham across the country, shares, “For us Himachalis, food is an emotion and the dham is the best of that. Every dish has meaning—take for example the madra, a yoghurt-based rajma dish that has local resonance as Chamba is famous for its milk and lentils. Then there is chana dal made with saunf, mah or maash ki dal (slow-cooked black dal), khatta (black chana gravy prepared with amchoor), kadhi and a meetha bhaat (sweet rice), mithdee, boondi.” The repast ends with a buttermilk called jhol. No breads are served in the dham as it is rice-based and chefs rely on curd and dried mango powder as souring agents. These dishes escape seasonal changes as the ingredients are available all year round.\n\nEvery region in Himachal Pradesh has its own dham\n\nThe dham is influenced by the different parts of the state, so you find a regional difference in the dishes served in Kangra, Mandi, Chamba and Shimla. Home chef and blogger Divya Kanwar specialises in Himachali food and also chronicles the recipes on The Flavour Trail by Divya. She says that the dham across Himachal is “different but equally delicious.”\n\n“The Chamba madra is simmered for long till the rajma-ghee mix is rich and thick, while in Kangra, the madra is made with chana aloo. The Mandiyali dham leans towards spinach so the popular dish is sepu vadi or split urad dal dumplings. And telia mah (black lentil dal) is a highlight of the Kangri dham. Also, the lower Himachali dham is tangy and sour and made in mustard oil with very robust flavours and is vegetarian, while the dham in upper Himachal uses a lot of pahadi ghee, whole spices and fewer condiments. Here meat dishes are added to the mix owing to the colder climate,\" says Kanwar. Geographical influence also plays a role here, so places like Lahaul and Spiti see more millet and barley dishes owing to the Tibetan influence there.\n\nThe dham pops up across India\n\nToday, the dham has travelled into metros, courtesy chefs and Himachali food lovers like Sherry. “I’ve done dham pop-ups at the Marriott in Hyderabad and people in Mumbai just loved it! I have had to put thought into making it as the dishes do not have onion or garlic. Many ask why I don’t serve it as a regular dish on the menu, but I tell them I’m very particular about following the rules and rituals of making dham. Since it’s considered temple food, one has to be barefoot and cover one’s head while cooking.”\n\nNitika Kuthiala, a home chef who runs the Pahadi Pattal kitchen, has done dham pop-ups in Delhi and delivers it across NCR. “The dham is auspicious, ceremonial food; it's about a feast and inviting people to relish it, so people order it for anniversaries, birthdays, house-warming parties. You can have six to even 30 dishes and more, in a dham. But whatever size of it, the dham takes hours to cook, there’s no shortcut in its making. I also do not change the dishes to it as this must be relished in its original style,” she says.\n\nHere is where you can eat the dham on your next trip to Himachal Pradesh\n\nHimachali Rasoi 54, Mall Rd, Middle Bazar, The Mall, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh 171001.
