        "text": "Bridgeport\n\nWorld · Featured in:\n\nThe Sims Wiki's Featured Article for May 16–31, 2012.\n\nBridgeport Founded by Ebenezer Alto at the turn of the century, Bridgeport was once a busy shipping town inhabited by sailors and smugglers. However, when the film industry came to the city, celebrities, Simoleons, and the sparkling lights of fame took over. Now a vibrant city with an energetic night life and bustling club scene, Bridgeport has made its mark on the map. With all the lights on, will its past ever resurface? Name Bridgeport Game The Sims 3: Late Night Housed residents 72 Onomatology\n\nBridgeport is a world that was originally shipped with The Sims 3: Late Night. It is the first urban city of its kind to be featured in The Sims series games as most past neighborhoods and worlds were either towns or suburbs.\n\nBridgeport was founded by Ebenezer Alto, as stated in the town's description. In the past, Bridgeport was once a shipping town that was full of sailors and smugglers, where the only beach in Bridgeport is named the Smuggler's Cove, situated on a small coastline facing the bridge and the bay. Some time later, Bridgeport has turned into a nightlife city when the film industry came to the city, changing the small town into a bustling downtown with high-rise buildings.\n\nOverview[]\n\nBridgeport is designed to focus on late night activities, and is similar in many respects to the Downtown sub-neighborhoods in The Sims: Hot Date and The Sims 2: Nightlife. Bridgeport consists of two sections connected with a large bridge. The urban city center is where all the bars, clubs, lounges, and penthouses are located. The other section is an exclusive neighborhood for the wealthy, where most high-star celebrities live in their mansions. There are other celebrities who live in the urban area as well, and the city center has a film studio for Sims who are employed as actors and actresses. The urban city center faces the ocean, while the wealthy neighborhood is located further to the east.\n\nBridgeport is a special late night town, which differs from the other worlds in The Sims 3. In Bridgeport, fake taxi cabs will appear across the town to simulate a bustling downtown feeling. Some wildlife animals, i.e. wild horses, deer, and raccoons, will also not appear in Bridgeport. Bridgeport also has different work hours than the other worlds, which mostly occur around the afternoon and evening. Bridgeport is a suitable place for single young adults and older to have fun and party. Most residents are also on average richer than other families in different worlds.\n\nLots[]\n\nCommunity Lots[]\n\nAJV Wellness Center (gym)\n\nAquarius (poolside club)\n\nBanzai Lounge (fusion lounge)\n\nBogaard Overlook (small park)\n\nBridgeport Acres (big park or festival grounds[TS3:S])\n\nBridgeport Public Library (library)\n\nBridgeport Eternal Rest Cemetery (graveyard)\n\nBridgeport Sports Zone (sports bar)\n\nBuena Vista Resort (small park)\n\nButterfly Esplanade (big park)\n\nCivic Plaza (visitors allowed)\n\nEugi's (local watering hole)\n\nMarina Field (big park)\n\nOverlook Point Subway (no visitors allowed)\n\nPlasma 501 (vampire lounge)\n\nSmuggler's Cove (beach)\n\nThe Brightmore (disco club)\n\nThe Grind (dance club)\n\nThe Prosper Room (exclusive lounge)\n\nThe True Modern Art Gallery (art gallery)\n\nWaylon's Haunt (dive bar)\n\nRabbit Holes\n\nEast Tradewinds Shipping Co.

Firstly, EA has managed to build two identical roads directly on top of one another in one particular area. This mistake confuses the routing system, slowing down performance and forcing cars and Sims to move about the world in sometimes strange ways. Secondly, there are small patches of routable terrain in the hills near the radio towers. NPCs and townies get stuck in these patches. These trapped Sims constantly try to walk somewhere, and this can cause slowness and lag. Eventually these trapped Sims are stuck forever until reset using cheats (they cannot die from starvation because they are outside of lot areas). The third issue is the routing when traveling in groups. The leader of the group will use the subway, though the others might choose to walk, even if the destination is very far. For these reasons, Bridgeport's performance will always be substandard unless the town is fixed in a patch, or via mods.[1]\n\nCannot create SimBot[]\n\nAnother problem has been reported by some players that they can't build a SimBot in Bridgeport, because the option menu to \"Create a mystery invention\" or \"Create a SimBot\" at the workbench isn't available. This makes Sims who already have a lifecore in their inventory unable to complete the opportunity even if they are moved to another world like Twinbrook, because the lifecore is still stuck there and can't be removed normally. A game mod has been created to fix this problem, it will make the \"Create a mystery invention\" or \"Create a SimBot\" option will be available again.[2]\n\nMulti-Rabbit Holes Glitch[]\n\nDue to multi-rabbit holes in this town, some opportunities (such as this one from professional sports) are not able to be completed despite the appropriate building (e.g. City Hall) being there. This is because the game assumes that the lot is invalid and therefore there are no options. This glitch can be resolved if the building from The Sims 3 base game or Ambitions is used (e.g. the Sunset Valley City Hall).\n\nA fix for this glitch is included in the NRaas Overwatch as of version 122 of the mod.[3]\n\nUnplayable sims with wrong body shape[]\n\nAll of unplayable permade sims, such as townie, NPC and deceased sims (different from playable ghosts) have the same weight and muscle tone value when they first appeared, no matter what they were actually like. The solution to this bug is to enter the CAS (can be done with Nraas), do nothing, and then press OK. However, it may cause changes in the default number of days of age.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe overall geography, climate and shape of the city is similar to Seattle and Vancouver.\n\nThere are roads on the edges of the peninsula that has borders with signs with an Interstate Highway shield with number 99 on it. It has 2 parts that goes parallel to the peninsula.\n\nBridgeport is the name of many cities in the United States,[4] most notably Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nMany players believe Bridgeport has a similar appearance to New York City, Detroit, and other major American cities. The bridge bears a faint resemblance to the Brooklyn Bridge. However, EA has stated it is not based upon New York City.[5] Graham Nardone stated that Bridgeport is loosely based on Pittsburgh as inspiration.[6] Rebecca Shearin notes that the overall location is based in the Pacific Northwest.[7]\n\nThe Brightmore's sign is based on Big Al's in San Francisco.\n\nThe Movie Cineplex's signs, and its general shape, is based on those found on the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nThe three radio towers resemble the radio towers found in the Queen Anne neighborhood in Seattle.\n\nThe players can see pigeons hanging around the front of town hall during the day.\n\nSmuggler's Cove may have a connection to Barnacle Bay.[confirmation needed]\n\nSome townies are family members of playable Sims, such as Flo-Flo Chique and Ryan Atkins.\n\nSeveral urns and gravestones are scattered about the city's alleyways. Also, similar to Twinbrook's and Barnacle Bay's green-colored deceased Sims, the deceased Sims have a grey color scheme.\n\nThere is a \"small city\" behind Bridgeport. The player can see it by using cameraman mode and following the road that leads outskirts of the city.\n\nBridgeport generates decorative fake taxis on the road to make it look bustling.\n\nAround Bridgeport are many roads which sink into the sea and one of the roads leading out of the city is cut off by a landslide. This hints towards a possible earthquake that occurred before the game's start, a possible reference to the 1989 San Francisco Earthquake.\n\nBridgeport's biography, the community lot \"Smuggler's Cove\" and the old red building near the City Hall are the only three solid proofs that smugglers were once the dwellers of Bridgeport.\n\nAccording to the description of the building where the \"Mixture of Good and Bad\" household lives, the Off Ramp Building is the only apartment that was spared during the bridge construction at the time. The last building to be demolished was the building beside the Off Ramp which was used to be favored by tourists before the demolition.\n\nBridgeport features no pregnant Sims when the game is started.\n\nThe Bogaard Overlook and Overlook Point Subway could possibly be a reference to The Overlook Hotel from the Stephen King book The Shining and it's film adaptation of the same name, as both the Bogaard Overlook and the hotel from the book and movie share a similar name, have stunning views, are on high mountains and are in areas with lots of woodland around. Additionally, there is also a place called Buena Vista Resort nearby. While sims can't sleep there, the word resort is usually affiliated with a luxurious hotel, which is what The Overlook Hotel is.\n\nGallery[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nThe Sims 3: Late Night/twitter interview\n\nReferences[]"
