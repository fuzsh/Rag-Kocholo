So, it was natural that romance and love should flourish in Shimla’s beautiful and lavish green surroundings. The hub of social life, the Scandal Point, is located near the General Post Office and is constructed from Spartan bricks and timber frames. Scandal Point is the highest point in Shimla on the Mall Road. There’s a popular story behind the name of this place. This was where a British Viceroy’s daughter eloped with the Maharaja of Patiala.

The name arose from the commotion caused by the supposed elopement of a British lady with an Indian Maharaja. The story goes that the Maharaja of Patiala had eloped with the daughter of the British Viceroy. The story behind the Scandal Point has been in the talks of many for years, and many seem to understand the story differently. For example, many tourist guides say that the Viceroy’s daughter didn’t elope with Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, but in fact, the Maharaja kidnapped Kitchener’s impressionable daughter from Scandal Point.\n\nThis point is a mountain lover’s haven because it enjoys a picturesque and unobstructed view of gigantic mountains covered in a blanket of dense fir and spruce. It is a year-round magnet where people relax and rejuvenate amidst the view of the soaring mountains. One can opt for a horse ride at this point, enjoy some hill station Maggi and play some arcade games in the small shops surrounding this point.\n\nMust Read: Offbeat Places Near Shimla\n\nBest Time To Visit Scandal Point\n\nImage Credit: Biswarup Ganguly for Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe best time to visit the Scandal Point would be between March and June.
