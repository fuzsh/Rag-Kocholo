        "text": "Former Royal Marine JJ Chalmers had a chance encounter at the Army v Navy rugby match with a Royal Marines Bandsman who had aided his family when he was wounded 12 years ago.\n\nThe TV and radio presenter was injured by an IED blast in Afghanistan in 2011.\n\nDuring anchoring commentary on the match for BFBS at Twickenham, he happened to meet Major Ian Davis, who had been the one who informed his family that he had been hurt.\n\nChalmers, who starred in the BBC dance contest show Strictly Come Dancing in 2020, said on Instagram: \"In another profound turn of events at the Army/Navy Match.\n\n\"Just as I was complementing the Royal Marines Band to my RAF colleagues.\n\n\"And just as I went to tell the story about how it was in fact a Royal Marines Bandsman who had the difficult task of knocking on my front door and informing my family of my wounding 12 years ago.\n\n\"This gentleman, Major Ian Davis, approached me saying he was that bandsman!\"\n\n\"I've literally never met him and we only had the chance to talk for a minute… but I made sure we exchanged details… and I will make sure I buy him a beer ASAP.\"\n\nIn a blast that killed two of his comrades, Chalmers broke his neck, lost two fingers and shattered his right elbow.\n\nHe suffered numerous holes in his leg as well as a crushed eye socket and burst eardrums, living with leftover shrapnel in his body for years."
