        "text": "The Himalayas run like a scar across South Asia’s many human-drawn borders. But unlike a scar, on which nothing grows, this greatest of barriers has, for thousands of years, nurtured and nourished the masses that have taken shelter along its length and breadth. Some of these people work tirelessly in service of the mighty mountain range and its diverse flora and fauna, while others are exploring new and sustainable ways of sharing its wonders with the world. Some have been chiselled and moulded by its harsh terrain and climate, while others have been inspired enough to give up their city life and high-paying jobs for a simpler (but in many ways more difficult) life. Meet our Himalayan heroes.\n\nBirinder ‘Billy’ Singh\n\nOwner, Aira Holme Retreat, Himachal Pradesh\n\nWhen Birinder ‘Billy’ Singh and his wife, Sanjiv, gave up farming in Uttar Pradesh to live at her family home in Shimla, their plan was to read books, listen to music and paint. In 2012, they opened two rooms of their home to travellers. Sanjiv passed away last year, but the fragrance of her garden blooms permeates the sprawling property. Billy also helped set up an INTACH chapter in Shimla, for which he documented the myths of over 1,000 temples in Shimla and Kinnaur. “The mythic ambience of the Himalayas is unique. It’s good to have legends. They add so much life to otherwise barren mountains.” SAUMYA ANCHERI\n\nRoshan Singh\n\nYoga instructor, Rishikesh Yog Peeth, Uttarakhand\n\nThe banks of the Ganga in the Ram Jhula area of Rishikesh is exactly where he is supposed to be, says Singh. “Life doesn’t exist outside of Rishikesh. Spiritually, I can grow here naturally.” Would you ever move elsewhere? “The Himalayas are the peak of spirituality in the physical world. If I had to move, I’d go further uphill, closer to the source of the Ganga.” What is yoga to you? “It is all about self-sustainability. Many people unknowingly practise yoga every day. A farmer, tending to his land, using organic methods, not harming nature at all, is a yogi to me.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nRaja Jigmed Wangchuk Namgyal\n\nKing of Ladakh & owner, Stok Palace Heritage Hotel, Jammu & Kashmir\n\nWhen he’s not busy running his palace turned-hotel, this king pursues his main passion—conservation. As a founding member and secretary of the Namgyal Institute for Research in Ladakhi Art & Culture (NIRLAC), Jigmed has facilitated heritage conservation projects across Ladakh. With the Stok Palace Heritage Initiative, he’s restoring stupas and documenting the revamping of a community monastery. What would you be if not the king? “A wanderer. I love taking road trips and photographing new destinations.” SMITHA MENON\n\nSonam Wangchuk\n\nSocial entrepreneur & education reformist, Jammu & Kashmir\n\nWangchuk set up SECMOL (Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh), which runs teacher training programmes, uses interactive learning methods and, thanks to student participation in setting the syllabus, has incorporated locally relevant material into the public school curriculum. He also popularised the Ice Stupa technique that creates artifi cial glaciers in winter to tide over water problems. Wangchuk’s now focusing on a project to divert tourism from Leh and into the villages of Ladakh, via farmstays. “Leh is exploding while the rest of Ladakh is imploding,” he says. Running a pilot project in Phyang, a village 19km from Leh, he and his team teach locals how to host tourists. They also build village resources such as bus stops and wells, and are introducing eco-friendly paddle-assisted electric bicycles to help travellers explore the region. SMITHA MENON\n\nThinlas Chorol\n\nFounder, Ladakhi Women’s Travel Company, Jammu & Kashmir\n\nTired of being rejected by a number of travel agencies despite being skilled and educated in the field, Chorol decided to start her own business in 2009. “The industry was run by men who thought women aren’t capable of guiding travellers through the mountains. I now train only female guides and have established a homestay network across the region, which gives trekkers a place to stay, and locals a way to earn revenue.” SMITHA MENON\n\nHimanshu Sud\n\nRestaurateur & TEDX HOST, Himachal Pradesh\n\nHaving grown up in Shimla, Sud worried that he’d never find like-minded people there. But in 2011, when he was about to leave the country to work as a computer programmer, he decided to ask colleagues abroad if they were happy. “I never got a clear answer,” said the 31-year-old. “So I chose to stay back here.” In 2012, he set up Wake and Bake Café, “a space where young people could just be, where we could encourage creativity.” It turned out to be the key to meeting like-minded people. He hosted Shimla’s first TEDx event in 2013. Two years ago, he opened Himachali Rasoi, which offers the cuisine served at a dhaam or festive communal meal. He also plans to create a model for sustainable farming in the region. SAUMYA ANCHERI\n\nShantanu Moitra music composer\n\n& Dhritiman Mukherjee wildlife photographer\n\nFar from the mountains, in the Andamans, these two friends made a pact to embark on a 100-day adventure to explore the Himalayas. Moitra, a music director for Hindi films, recalls he’d been feeling a distinct lack of inspiration. “The Himalayas had always been very important to me and my family, but over time, as I got busy with work, I stopped visiting,” he says. “I knew I needed to call time on work and reconnect with the place that meant so much to me. Besides, we wanted to see how two different people—a composer and a wildlife photographer—would perceive this experience.” The idea was to discover the mountains’ secrets, places that are inaccessible, from Jammu & Kashmir to Tibet to Arunachal Pradesh. Mukherjee, one of India’s pre-eminent wildlife photographers, was in charge of curating their itinerary of all the interesting things to do wherever they went, because he knows the Himalayas like the back of his hand [he can even give you tips on where and how to spot snow leopards]. “Despite that,” he says, “the Himalayas never cease to surprise. And as a photographer, I want to be blown away every day, whether by the view or the wildlife. And the Himalayan range is such a wide canvas—after spending almost all of my adult life visiting it, it continues to astound me.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nJoshua Hishey & Richa Ghansiyal\n\nOwners, Alaya Design Studio, Uttarakhand\n\n“They started by tearing down beautiful old houses to build ugly apartment blocks. Then they paved over the original cobbled streets,” says Hishey (pictured). But rather than despair over the changes overtaking the Rajpur neighbourhood of Dehradun, he and Ghansiyal decided to lead by example and invest in the area. “We are very proud of being from here, so we wanted to show people that you can breathe new life into an old neighbourhood without destroying its character,” Ghansiyal says. The duo set up their custom design furniture business here, and trained locals in the art of woodworking. They taught them to work with solid and live edge wood, bamboo and fibre. In the last 10 years, the couple and their band of carpenters have established a thriving business supplying furniture to a number of boutique hotels and eco-lodges across the hill state. RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nTsewang Namgail\n\nDirector, Snow Leopard Conservancy, Jammu & Kashmir\n\nSnow leopard tourism has really taken off lately. What are the initiatives SLC has undertaken? “We’ve helped make it a community effort—with incentives for locals and homestays for tourists, and by building civic amenities for things like waste management. We are trying to teach locals about the intrinsic value of wildlife, not just the economic value. People are excited about snow leopards, but we need to have checks and balances in place as well. It’s not about fast progress, but responsible tourism.” SMITHA MENON\n\nShikha Tripathi & Sindhu Gangola\n\nOwners, Grand Oak Manor; cofounders, One Planet Foundation, Uttarakhand\n\n“Tourism in the hills is a double-edged sword,” say these hospitality and education entrepreneurs. “Whoever decides to enter the field must do so with more than personal benefit in mind. The onus is on those in the industry to ensure the wellbeing of the Himalayas and its people. ‘Go local’ goes a long way in generating economy and goodwill.” A secret from the Himalayas? “This herb called ‘jumboo’, a wild variety of a high-altitude chive available only in certain local shops, especially those owned by Kumaoni Bhotias. It’s the secret ingredient in our dals and potatoes.” What’s next? “Personally, as a mountaineer and writer, I want to explore more of the higher Himalayas, and to write fiction set in the mountains,” says Tripathi. “Collectively, we aim to promote the region and involve our community by linking it with our tourism business.” RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nMukesh Dhiman\n\nOwner, Jungle Vibes, Uttarakhand\n\nThe instrument Dhiman plays might seem out of place in Muni Ki Reti, a little town close to Rishikesh. Called the didgeridoo, it is an Australian aboriginal acoustic tool that looks like a big pipe with uneven surfaces. It looks fairly rudimentary, but the sounds he coaxes out of that bit of wood, his chest heaving and falling as he channels air through its hollow column, are a music unlike any other. “I learnt the art of playing the didgeridoo from a visiting Australian many years ago, and over time, I taught myself to make it from termite-hollowed pieces of eucalyptus logs,” says the 50-year-old. Now, he even teaches people how to play and make it, right here in his studio, Jungle Vibes, in a back alley near Dayanand Ashram. RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nPeter Smetacek\n\nThe Butterfly Research Centre, Uttarakhand\n\n“I’ve been fascinated with butterflies since I was born, I suppose. We have records of me chasing butterflies when I was two-and-a-half years old. The Butterfly Research Centre published the first catalogue of Indian butterflies—there are about 1,318 types in India. Insects, butterflies and moths are indicators of the health of a forest, and the forest cover also affects the rivers and water systems. Billions of rupees have been taken to ‘plant’ forests that exist only on paper—a forest is self-planted. We need to protect, not intervene. At the centre, we exposed malpractices, which resulted in fewer forest fires this year. And by studying the health of the forests, we are working on flood control and fixing up water systems.” RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nNishat Mohi\n\nDirector, The Himalayan, Himachal Pradesh\n\n“As a boy, everyone wants to be king of the hill, everyone wants a castle,” says Nishat Mohi. Such lofty dreams don’t often come true, but he was determined to make it happen when he returned to Manali in 2002, after studying hotel management in Switzerland and working at the Hyatt in the Florida Keys. It took Mohi and his brother Bobby a decade to build their medieval Gothic-style castle hotel. The Himalayan comes with a bar in the dungeon, battlements, even banners featuring the brand’s logo, the Himalayan ibex. “Guests often say, ‘Oh this is so Game of Thrones’ or ‘This is so Harry Potter.’” SAUMYA ANCHERI\n\nVijay Parmar\n\nPresident, Himalayan Motorsport, Himachal Pradesh\n\n“Tourism brings economic growth, but takes away natural beauty as soon as the hordes descend. An unhappy situation, in India at least, where lack of basic tourist-handling infrastructure causes havoc,” says the Shimla-based entrepreneur. The Raid de Himalaya rally takes place in October, when winter is on its way and most tourists have left. “The best part of rallying in this pristine terrain is that there is not even a five-second break. No meal stops—no littering! We leave nothing but tyre prints, which the wind blows away.” SAUMYA ANCHERI\n\nDivya Chowfin\n\nOwner, Marrora Farm, Uttarakhand\n\nAfter her father’s death, Chowfin and her South African husband, Stephen, together with Chowfin’s mother, took over the running of her family farm in Pauri Garhwal, 180km from Dehradun. Using the freshest fruit and herbs from the farm, they started making preserves, sauces, concentrates, vinegars, herbal infusions and salts. They sell these small-batch products under their two-year-old brand, Himalayan Haat. “We employ and train local village women and help them earn a living. They are involved in the harvesting, cutting, chopping, canning and packaging of the products.” A local food secret? “Kaafal is a much-loved sweet-sour red berry that grows wild in the month of May. Local kids climb trees to pluck the berries and then sell them on the roadsides. The best way to eat kaafal is mixed with raw mustard oil and a dash of salt, red chilli powder and cumin powder.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nSonam Wangmo Jhalani\n\nWriter, development specialist & advisor, Mountain Echoes Literary Festival, Bhutan\n\n“I am primarily a fiction writer, so I see stories in the dramatic vistas, in the distinctive local sayings, in the unique history of Bhutan and in our people. As a teenager, I wanted to run away to the West—which I did—but as an adult I’ve come running back. It’s in the blood, I suppose. I am made of Himalayan air, spirit and earth.” How has the literary scene evolved in Bhutan? “There has always been a literary scene in the local Dzongkha and Choeki languages, but what Mountain Echoes has done and continues to do is to provide the buzz, the momentum and the platform for budding as well as published authors in the English language, locally and globally. There are many more local authors publishing their books and young bloggers popping up. Local publishing houses have emerged, as have bookstores like Junction, which feature local poets in creative and interesting ways.” What is the lit fest’s best-kept secret? “There’s an after-after-party at Mojo Park!” A book on Bhutan that is a must-read? “Her Majesty The Royal Queen Mother’s book, Treasures of the Thunder Dragon: A Portrait of Bhutan, and Jamie Zeppa’s endearing memoir, Beyond The Sky and The Earth: A Journey Into Bhutan.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nMuzammil & Tafazzul Hussain\n\nCo-founders, Roots Collective, Jammu & Kashmir\n\nHaving worked and studied in Delhi and Pune, the Hussain brothers returned to Kargil four years ago, with the aim of driving revenue back to the region. “We realised that people associate Kargil with war and we wanted to change that,” says Muzammil (pictured). Aided by anthropology and archaeology experts, Roots Collective has adopted the border village of Hunderman, where it conducts art residencies, heritage walks and cultural documentation projects. It also helped set up Unlock Hunderman—Museum of Memories, to document the history of the area. SMITHA MENON\n\nUdayan Mukherjee\n\nHospitality entrepreneur, Jammu & Kashmir\n\n“It was always my plan to move to the mountains.” Soon after his 40th birthday, Mukherjee, then one of the most influential business journalists in India, quit his job to live the dream. He set up Shey Bhumi, a boutique hotel outside Leh, as well as Himalayan Glamping Retreat, a resort, and Pancheshwar Fishing Retreat, both in Uttarakhand. His aim is to create Himalayan experience holidays. “I am not a rich man, but with the mountains, I have enough.” SMITHA MENON\n\nGanesh Saili\n\nAuthor, Uttarakhand\n\n“My family has been here for five generations now. And I have no plans to leave—where else would I find a lifestyle like this? It’s laid-back and it’s easy,” says Saili. He has an uncanny ability to rattle off the history of the area, no matter the period, on cue. “I was born and raised here and that’s quite a long time to get to know the mountains.” Together with Ruskin Bond and Stephen Alter, Saili forms the original literary trio of Landour, a little town at the foothills of the Himalayas, a short distance from Mussoorie. Of the many books he has written over the years, several are set in Landour. “I am not one of those people who pines for the old days. I love new people moving to Landour. This town has always been quite diverse, thanks to the schools, and with more people moving here, I find more material to write about. I never have to scrape the bottom of the barrel,” he says. His favourite place to visit is Jabarkhet Nature Reserve, not far from his house. The reason? Cars can’t go up there, of course. RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nSameer & Dr Kavita Shukla\n\nOwners, Soham The Himalayan Museum, Uttarakhand\n\n“We get a lot of tourists in places like Mussoorie and Nainital, but not in the interiors of the state. As a result, a lot of the arts and crafts of these regions are dying out because of a lack of patronage. And each valley here has a very distinct art form that needs to be appreciated,” says Mussoorie-based Sameer. He and his wife travel the region identifying such endangered art forms. They try to reproduce the art and bring it to a wider audience by displaying it at their museum. “We photograph the work and try to get artisans to recreate it. Or we paint it. And if we can, we buy it,” Kavita says. Their museum is a mish-mash of different art styles and even media, most of which the couple themselves have created. And they always welcome guests with a ready smile and a cup of hot tea. RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nLiz & Tim Sebastian\n\nOwners, iHeart Café, Uttarakhand\n\nOriginally from the US, Liz and Tim first came to India several years ago to broaden their world views and explore different cultures. “We didn’t expect to make our lives here, but we fell in love with the country.” They moved to Bhimtal in 2009, and today, run iHeart Café, a buzzing place serving what they call “the best espresso in Kumaon”. You speak fluent Hindi and your kids attend a local school. Does this feel like home? “It’s really the only home we’ve known after getting married and it’s the only home our kids know.” How would you describe the people of the Himalayas? “There’s a Kumaoni blessing one often hears: Ji reya, jobe reya, bach reya, aun reya. It means ‘Keep living, keep conscious, keep safe and keep coming’. I really think that this sums up the people of the hills very well.” What are your plans for the future? “Once the boys take off to live their lives, we will pick up our backpacks and head off deeper into the Himalayas.” RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nGulzar Hussain\n\nEthnographer, researcher & mountaineer, Jammu & Kashmir\n\n“The beauty of the Ladakhi mountains is that there are people up here. They are what bring the mountains alive.” Between working with the nomads of the Changthang region to help preserve the original pashmina tradition, running expeditions that include spotting the snow leopard via his company, Frozen Himalayas, organising photo exhibitions to raise funds for his several research projects and conducting heritage walks in the old town of Leh, it’s a miracle Hussain gets any sleep. He does—we checked—the multitasker survives on just three hours a day. SMITHA MENON\n\nRaaja Bhasin\n\nAuthor & guide, Himachal Pradesh\n\nAuthor, lecturer and INTACH’s co-convenor for Himachal Pradesh, Bhasin is an eminent authority on Shimla’s history—but he almost missed the bus. He was preparing to leave Shimla to study business in the US, when an aunt commented that all the young people were leaving. On an impulse, Bhasin decided to stay back, finding work at a construction company. “I loathed every minute of it, and almost to keep my sanity, I started writing,” he recalls. Now, 13 books later, he is a local icon, known for his painstaking research and gentle demeanour. His books take travellers through Shimla’s past as well as on walking trails and driving holidays; his Experience Himachal: On the Road received the National Tourism Award in 2015. SAUMYA ANCHERI\n\nAni Choying Drolma\n\nFounder, Nun’s Welfare Foundation of Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal\n\nThe things most people notice about Drolma aren’t important to her. The motorbike-riding, rock star nun with multiple studio albums to her name doesn’t care about any of those things. “They are all a means to a higher end,” says the only nun with a driver’s licence in Nepal. “But the goal was self-empowerment. When I ride my wheels, I have control over my own destiny.” The music, similarly, is a means to empowering her “children”. She is the founder of the Nun’s Welfare Foundation of Nepal, a Kathmandu-based NGO that educates young nuns. “I never hoped to become a singer, but when a visiting American musician heard me perform the monastery ritual ceremony, he recorded my voice and things moved fast and now I have more than 10 albums. I realised that this was the way I could actually fund my bigger dream of empowering women in Nepal,” she says. RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nMira Rai\n\nDistance runner, Nepal\n\nThe mountains made her who she is. On a fundamental, biological level. How else could you explain a young girl from the little village of Bhojpur, east of Kathmandu, winning the first competitive trail run she participated in? “I thought I was going to a training camp and before I realised what was happening, I was signed up to run,” Rai says. And run she did. For more than seven hours, in pouring rain. Since that race in 2014, her athletic prowess has seen her run competitively all over the world including Italy, Hong Kong and France. “There aren’t a lot of opportunities for women in Nepal. I almost gave up and moved abroad for work when my karate teacher, whom I met when I was part of a Maoist camp, encouraged me to stay and try to be an athlete. I hope I can inspire young girls in Nepal not to give up.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nJigmat Norbu & Jigmat Wangmo\n\nOwners, Jigmat Couture, Jammu & Kashmir\n\nWas it difficult setting up a fashion brand in Ladakh? “We don’t think of ourselves as fashion designers, but as art revivers. Our designs are 100 percent made in Ladakh—from the wool to the handloom. Our work draws on traditional techniques and is interpreted in a modern manner. Our clients had seen nothing like it.” Tell us about the textile museum you are setting up. “We want to create a resource centre to document and study traditional Ladakhi design. We already have many heirlooms and artefacts to that end, and the space will be fully set up by 2018.” SMITHA MENON\n\nLokesh Ohri\n\nFounder, Been There, Doon That, Uttarakhand\n\nWhat is the idea behind this initiative? “I am an anthropologist and the idea was to set up a citizens’ group to help people discover the best of our city and build a sense of pride so that people preserve our cultural landscape and environment. It started in Dehradun, where we do about 40 themed trails, but we now have initiatives in Nainital, Almora, Ranikhet, Mussoorie, Rishikesh and Haridwar as well.” What are some of the things you can discover on these trails? “A lot of locals are not aware of the Khalanga War Memorial that was built to commemorate the clash between the Nepali Gurkhas and the British. Or that Ruskin Bond spent his childhood in Dehradun and in a lot of his tales, the city is the hero. We do a Ruskin Bond childhood walk in which we take people to the places mentioned in his books.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nMeghann Sandhu Rolston\n\nCoordinator, Due North, Uttarakhand\n\n“I’ve always said that I want to settle down in the Himalayas. They are a source of peace for me,” says Sandhu Rolston. She works for Due North, an eco-tourism initiative with a development component based in Saur, a little village not far from Tehri Dam and Dehradun. “It is this little hamlet with tall pine trees, beautiful lakes, terraced hills covered in lush green with the beautiful, majestic mountains watching over it,” she says. Due North runs a heritage cottage to host guests, staffed by locals. “The goal is to provide sustainable employment in this village. We cater to people who want an honest experience of what life in the rural areas of Uttarakhand is like,” she explains. As part of Due North, Sandhu Rolston, who has a background in fabrics and design, teaches women in surrounding villages the art of making beautifully intricate handicrafts out of pine needles—and how to make a living out of this. RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nOmi Gurung\n\nFounder, Oh My India & Green Gangtok, Sikkim\n\nThe fashion designer and social entrepreneur’s mantra is “The Himalayas may change you, but please do not change the Himalayas.” With this in mind, the Gangtok-raised Gurung moved back from Bengaluru, where he had been a student, and set up Oh My India (OMI), an initiative to raise awareness about environmental issues in the region. Even his label, Green Gangtok, which is showcased in his Forest Colony Road boutique, offers fashion with an eye on sustainability. He upcycles materials and uses natural dyes and ingredients to make a variety of apparel, accessories and artefacts. If where you live were a film set, which film would it be? “Priyanka Chopra’s Pahuna, shot in Sikkim.” Your favourite product from the Himalayas? “Chhurpi! This wonder cheese is usually made from yak milk and is a high-energy food.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nNayantara Gurung\n\nFounder, photo.circle, Nepal\n\nGurung picked up a camera to document the torrential period when Nepal was transitioning to a republic. She set up photo.circle in 2007 in Kathmandu, to work with photographers and film-makers who were similarly inclined. The multimedia collective documents current events and archives photographs from the past. It also hosts educational seminars and exhibitions, like the biannual international photo festival called Photo Kathmandu. Your favourite place in the mountains? “I love Patlekhet, 100km from Pokhara. It isn’t touristy and there are a number of organic farmstays and the food is amazingly fresh.” Your favourite place to shop? “One Tree Stop, a cool store that sells Nepali-made trinkets and apparel.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUHDURI\n\nSonali & Bharat Bisht\n\nFounders, INHERE (Institute of Himalayan Environmental Research and Education), Uttarakhand\n\nAlmora-born Bharat (pictured) returned to Uttarakhand in 1982, after studying in Delhi, to start INHERE with his wife, Sonali. Fresh out of college, they were passionate about the Himalayas—while Bharat wanted to improve life for the mountain communities, Sonali, a trekker, loved the hills and wanted to give back in whatever way she could. INHERE is a primarily community-based organisation in Chinoni village in Almora, working at the grassroots level to provide clean drinking water, reforest degraded areas, restore watersheds, revive springs and plant indigenous varieties of trees and fruit. “What has given us the greatest satisfaction is the change in people, especially women, their growing confi dence and ability to articulate their views and take a stand in public life.” RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nHusna-Tara & Anshuman Prakash\n\nOwner & director, Glenburn Tea Estate, West Bengal\n\nHusna-Tara always gets asked the same tired old question: “How do you keep busy in the Himalayas, given the isolation?” Never mind that she and her husband, Anshuman, have their hands full running a tea estate and hotel just outside Darjeeling. The couple’s love affair with the mountains started when they were in school, in Dehradun. “We went on many treks—the most memorable one was up to 18,000ft near Kalindi Khal pass,” recalls Husna-Tara. What would be your advice for running a business in the Himalayas? “Keep things local. Rely on what you can find and source from your immediate neighbourhood. Empower the local people. They have so much more to offer.” Would you ever think of moving away from the mountains? “Never for too long. I feel my soul belongs in the mountains,” says Anshuman, emphatically. And your favourite product from the mountains in West Bengal? “Darjeeling tea! It only comes from 87 designated estates up in the Himalayas,” exclaims Husna-Tara. “Edible chestnuts. I don’t know where else in India you find them,” says Anshuman. RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nMonisha Ahmed\n\nCo-founder, LAMO (Ladakh Arts and Media Organisation), Jammu & Kashmir\n\n“There has to be a recognition of the importance of heritage in Ladakh—20 years from now, children are going to ask their parents, why did you allow the old town to just fall apart?” laments Ahmed. Enter LAMO, a space focused on the arts, media and local culture. Set in two 17th-century buildings in Leh, LAMO organises workshops and exhibitions to highlight local issues, runs a community library and hosts art residencies to encourage Ladakhis to adapt to the world around them. SMITHA MENON\n\nBobby Hano\n\nCo-founder, Ziro Festival of Music, Arunachal Pradesh\n\n“There’s no place like home,” says Hano. And given that his home is the unbelievably scenic Ziro Valley, we agree. Hano, who used to live in Delhi, returned to Ziro Valley where he runs an event management company called Phoenix Rising. But what he is famous for is the Ziro Festival of Music, the first of its kind in Arunachal. Started in 2012, it celebrates indie music from across India and has marked the state out as a destination for music lovers across the country. “It’s not just the beauty, the amazing nature of the Himalayas or the fresh air. It is like a mother, always giving, and it has afforded me tremendous opportunities. And the mountains hold fantastic potential for the state.” The only thing he misses about life in the big city? “Internet.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nHis Holiness Dalai Lama\n\nSpiritual leader, Himachal Pradesh\n\n“Right now, more than ever, countries must come together,” says the world leader over lunch in Ladakh. “Our economies and futures depend on each other. With our population growing and global warming becoming a greater concern, we need a oneness among seven billion human beings. Nationality, religious faith—these are secondary. In the name of nationality, people act out. It’s unnecessary. First, we have to think of each other as human beings.” SMITHA MENON\n\nNoor Jahan\n\nLadakh Women Ice Hockey foundation, team goalkeeper & art conservationist, Jammu & Kashmir\n\n“It is difficult playing a sport that is not really recognised. I never imagined myself doing this, and it’s a huge responsibility. We are always thinking about how we can make it easy for the rest of the girls. A woman is no less than anybody. If there’s something you want to do, the time is now.” SMITHA MENON\n\nRenu Sharma\n\nEducational consultant, Uttarakhand\n\n“Life in the Himalayas is extraordinary. It’s truly nature’s miracle. The trees, the wild flowers, the grass we walk on, the fresh air, the mesmerising birdsong and the majestic snow-capped mountains—everything is special, most of all the silence. The weather is obviously gorgeous, including the harsh winters. But more than anything, the Himalayas have given me the space and opportunity to go back to simpler things. I have fallen in love with hidden plants, secret herbs, that little mysterious flower that grows near the swamp, wild asparagus in the dense fern shrubs, dandelions growing randomly. It feels like I’m on a completely new journey and there is so much to learn. It is no less than the wonderland Lewis Carroll wrote about.” RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nRahul Chaudhary\n\nExecutive director, CG Corp Global, Nepal\n\nAt the helm of a conglomerate with business interests in 40 countries, Chaudhary has to travel a fair bit for work. His empire encompasses everything from financial services to biotechnology and telecommunications to hospitality. “We have almost 100 hotels in 70 cities and destinations, and work takes me all over the world. But then I get to come back to the lofty Himalayas and there is no place like home,” he says. “I love the brisk, unadulterated air and the way the clouds part on a cold winter morning to give a glimpse of the majestic mountains. It is awe-inspiring.” And where does he escape to, when he’s had enough of the mountains? “I head to our luxury escape called Meghauli Serai in Chitwan, or the Taj Exotica in Maldives or The Farm in the Philippines.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nNazia Izuddin\n\nChairperson, WIC (World Integrity Center), Uttarakhand\n\n“Dehradun district is one of the oldest centres of education in the country. While a school may have a great music teacher or music centre, usually locals can’t participate,” explains Izuddin, who is all about sharing resources. This is the idea behind WIC Dehradun, a social and cultural hub that hosts community events through the year, including the flagship WIC India Dehradun Community Literature Festival. All events are open to the general public. At the same time, WIC is also a members’-only recreational centre with a host of restaurants, bars, work spaces and game rooms. The idea is to give this charming city in the foothills of the Himalayas another dimension. “Increasingly, young locals who had moved elsewhere are coming back. So now, not only do you have the beauty of the hills and pretty landscapes, but also a lively, interesting social scene.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nSange Tsering\n\nHoliday Scout, Arunachal Pradesh\n\nThe 27-year-old set up a travel company that designs custom tours, to share the state’s treasures with visitors. “Arunachal Pradesh is an unexplored paradise and a melting pot of ethnic groups with distinct cultures,” he says. What’s your take on tourism in the state? “It is still in its infancy. However, it is also the industry with the best potential to improve the fortunes of the state. Within the next decade, tourism will be the number one industry here. And the Himalayas have a huge role to play in this. The climate and topography of the range gave rise to the diversity of flora and fauna found here. Moreover, the mighty frontier has helped preserve the indigenous tribal culture of the people.” A must-visit place in Arunachal Pradesh? “Travellers must spend a night in Dirang Dzong, an ancient, fortified village which provides a window into our history and culture and also has scenic views.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nRabi Thapa\n\nEditor, La.Lit, Nepal\n\nBased in the historic town of Lalitpur (Patan), just south of Kathmandu, La.Lit is an independent literary magazine. “The best of Nepal’s literature doesn’t get global exposure, due to language constraints. We publish fiction, non-fiction, poetry, art, reviews, interviews and translations in print. The idea is to stir it up and provide a platform for literary exchange.” A book or movie that comes closest to describing where you live? “Thamel: Dark Star of Kathmandu, by me. It’s about growing up more or less sane in a place that has become more or less insane.” What is Nepal’s best-kept secret? “The lanes off Lalitpur’s tourist beat and the villages off the trekking trails, not yet invaded by mountain highways.” Your favourite thing from the Himalayas? “Chhyang, a fermented, cloudy, sour brew. It’s Himalayan craft beer, if you will.” RAJ ADITYA CHAUDHURI\n\nChewang Motup & Yangdu Gombu\n\nCo-founders, Ladakh Marathon; Rimo Expeditions, Jammu & Kashmir\n\nWhat inspired you to start the marathon? “When you’re born at such a high altitude, your body has a natural advantage in endurance sports. So, all the locals need to excel is proper coaching and an opportunity. Plus, after the floods, we had to show people that Ladakh was once again open for business.” Tell us about the challenges you faced. “The authorities said, ‘Do you want to kill people?’ It’s tough for regular tourists to come here, so having a marathon [held in September; the last one saw almost 6,000 participants across four races, from 7km to the 72km Ultra] at these altitudes at Khardung-La—required major logistics and expertise.” SMITHA MENON\n\nRatanjit Singh\n\nOwner, Chapslee, Himachal Pradesh\n\nRatanjit ‘Reggie’ Singh is the founder of the Chapslee School and the co-founder of INTACH in Shimla, but he is best known as the owner of Chapslee. Built in 1830 by an Englishman, it is one of Shimla’s first colonial homes. (It was the Secretariat when Lord Auckland was Governor-General.) It saw the British sign the Simla Manifesto in 1838 to reinstate the deposed king of Kabul. A century later, Reggie’s grandfather, Raja Charanjit Singh of Kapurthala, bought and refurbished Chapslee as his summer home. “There has been no renovation since,” said Reggie, who opened his home to travellers in 1976. The historic property is a glamorous time machine, with Murano chandeliers, vintage powder rooms, gleaming fireplaces and antique four-poster beds. Elegant meals are prepared from carefully guarded family recipes and served by the ever-attentive liveried staff. “If it hadn’t been for the Himalayas, we would have been in a desert,” said Reggie, “I think the Himalayas are God’s greatest gift to India.” SAUMYA ANCHERI\n\nSujata Sahu\n\nCo-Founder, 17000 ft Foundation, Jammu & Kashmir\n\nGeo-mapping remote parts of Ladakh, training over 1,000 teachers, building 200 libraries, improving local schools—17000ft Foundation is literally going where no one has before. “Ladakhi kids move to the city to study, live alone in monasteries or hostels. Many drop out. We don’t want children to have to leave home, so we’re trying to improve existing education systems,” says Sahu. “We come from such a position of privilege. But the real privilege is being here, being so content with so little.” SMITHA MENON\n\nVaneet Jishtu\n\nField botanist, Himachal Pradesh\n\n“There are lots of tree species that people have just heard about and never seen,” explains the field botanist at Shimla’s Himalayan Forest Research Institute. On a mission to collect a sample of every tree native to Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir, Jishtu set up the Western Himalayan Temperate Arboretum with specimens he collected over the past eight years. It has more than 100 of the 160-odd native tree species documented by a British army colonel in 1902. Several are now rare, and traditional knowledge of their uses is often lost. Among the Arboretum’s blocks of oak, maple, conifer, orchid and medicinal plants are the eight herbs or ‘ashtavarga’ that constitute the ayurvedic elixir Chyawanprash. “They are written about in the scriptures, but you don’t find them in the wild; the habitat is gone. We don’t realise we’re heading towards doomsday.” Jishtu has also begun collecting data on local temperature and humidity to enable research on climate change. SAUMYA ANCHERI\n\nShubha & Pradeep Gupta\n\nHosts, Dak Bungalow, Uttarakhand\n\n“We had moved to the Kumaon hills from Delhi in 2003. I had taken early voluntary retirement, and the primary purpose behind our move was to live among the local community and work towards rural development—despite immense resistance from family and friends,” recalls Pradeep. He began to work with Aarohi, an NGO, where he focused on livelihood and education, and the couple shifted to Satkhol, a village next to its headquarters. “A midwife from the UK was volunteering there at the time and her husband, who was involved with renovating old houses in London, saw the Dak Bungalow and suggested that we renovate it, to create a living space for ourselves and to save a heritage building from being ruined. It took two years, and eventually, we started running it as a homestay in April 2007. We love the natural beauty of the Himalayas—the simple, friendly people, the weather, the fruit and flowers, the song and dance, the lovely, smiling faces of beautiful children and the peace and quiet. We’ve lived in these parts for over 14 years now, and the Dak Bungalow and surrounding villages are very much our home. We don’t foresee living anyplace else… Jeena yahaan marna yahaan…” RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nPadmini Smetacek\n\nBook editor & homestay host – The Retreat, Uttarakhand\n\nLucknow-born, Delhi-raised Smetacek came to Bhimtal when she was 16, and has called it home ever since. Now 53, she runs The Retreat, a homestay staffed largely by local women. Aside from sourcing local produce for meals, she has also tied up with locals to host her guests for lunches at their homes so they get an authentic experience. With her daughter Ela, she also educates farmers on how to market their naturally grown, organic produce, saving them from the clutches of builders and timber merchants. “The best way to encourage forest cover is to leave it alone as far as possible—we deliberately keep our grounds in a state of wilderness.” And the strip of forest around the property is home to indigenous flora and fauna such as hares, deer and leopards. RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nNishant Singh\n\nOwner, The Birdcage, Uttarakhand\n\nWhat should one keep in mind when setting up a boutique resort in the hills? “Infrastructure—it’s a deal-maker or breaker. You might find great land only to realise that it’ll cost you a bomb to bring electricity and that the roads are not motorable. Or there’s no water supply and sewage disposal system in place—things you take for granted in a city.” Where do you like to escape to? “Binsar Forest Retreat run by Pallavi Singh and Preetam Reddy. It’s a great place to switch off: hardly any phone connectivity, just enough electricity—and wild boar and deer sightings from your balcony.” RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nJan Mohammed\n\nPashmina shawl weaver, Jammu & Kashmir\n\n“Kashmir is benazir jannat; no other place in India can compare to this land. I find peace here,” says the Srinagar-based artisan. “Sadly, the fake pashmina market is now much larger than the authentic one and most tourists don’t know what they are buying. The life of a real pashmina shawl is 300 years, and it is made by hand from the wool of the Changthangi goat found in Ladakh. To tell the difference, have the shawl washed. A fake will instantly show wear and tear in its finishing.” The most clichéd question you get asked? “Is it safe to visit Kashmir?” Do you ever think of leaving Kashmir? “Never. There is insaniyat in Kashmir. You know, my artisans live in a remote village where a tourist bus was attacked by terrorists. Locals rescued all the victims, brought them food, bedding, took them to hospitals and donated blood.” JASREEN MAYAL KHANNA\n\nDr Sushil Sharma\n\nCo-founder advisor – Health, Aarohi, & Owner, Sukoon Homestead, Uttarakhand\n\n“I moved to the Himalayas in March 1988, driven by a deep desire to serve the rural population of the mountains as a doctor,” recalls Sharma, who studied anaesthesiology and worked in the Army and private hospitals in Pune and Delhi. He joined Chirag, a rural development organisation, before co-founding Aarohi with his late wife, Oona. Today, Aarohi is one of Uttarakhand’s largest non-profit organisations, working in health, education, livelihood and youth empowerment. He now works in an advisory capacity with Aarohi, and continues his medical practice. And then there is Sukoon, his home, near Nainital, which he also runs as a homestay. “Living in Sukoon in the middle of a forest, with a stupendous view of the Central Himalayas, is extremely gratifying.” RASHMI SHANKAR\n\nEnjoyed reading this article?
