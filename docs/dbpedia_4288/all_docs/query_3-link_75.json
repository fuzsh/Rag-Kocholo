Many thousands of years ago, when mankind was still primitive, men must have looked out of caves and wondered about what they saw. What made the lightning flash? Where did the wind come from? Why would winter start soon and why would all the green things die? And then why did they all come back to life\n\nthe next spring?\n\nMan sick ally?\n\nwondered about himself,\n\nsometimes?\n\nWho\n\nfirst\n\ntoo.\n\nWhy\n\ndid\n\nmen\n\nget\n\nWhy\n\ndid all men get old and die eventutaught men how to use fire and how to\n\nweave cloth? There were any number of questions but there were no answers. These were the days before science; before men had learned to experiment in order to determine the hows and whys of the universe. What early man had to do was to invent what seemed to be the most logical answers. The raging wind was like the blowing of an angry man. The wind, however, was 9\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n10\n\nmuch\n\nstronger than the breath of any ordinary man and it had been blowing ever since man could remember. Therefore, the wind must be created by a tremendously huge\n\nand powerful man, one who never died. Such a superhuman being was a “god” or “demon.”\n\nThe\n\nlightning seemed, perhaps, the huge, deadly spear\n\nof another god. Then, since arrows killed men, disease could be the result of invisible arrows fired by still another god. Since men and women married and had children, perhaps the green plants of the world were the children of the sky (a god) and the earth (a goddess). The gentle rain which made the plants grow was the marriage between\n\nthem. Perhaps a goddess was in charge of the plants of the world and grew angry because of some misfortune. She might have refused to let plants grow until things had been straightened out. That was why the green things died and winter came and that’s why the world grew green again when winter was over and spring came.\n\nEvery group of human beings made up such stories; and some groups were more interesting and clever at it than others. Foremost in excellence were the ancient Greeks. They were a lively, imaginative people with great literary talents, and they made up some of the most fas-\n\nThey called such stories “mythos” which is a Greek word that simply means “tale” or “story.” We use the word “myth” nowadays to mean a cinating tales of this sort.\n\nparticular kind of story; one which contains fanciful or supernatural incidents intended to explain nature, or one\n\nwhich deals with the gods and demons that were invented by early man. The Greeks took their myths very seriously. Since the gods controlled natural forces, it was wise to treat them with careful consideration. They had to be bribed to send rain when it was needed, and pleaded with not to send disease or misfortune. For that reason, animals were sacrificed to them, beautiful temples were built for them, songs were composed to praise them. Thus, a religion grew up about the myths.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nyears, the people of the ancient inherit our civilization) believed in\n\nFor over a thousand world (from\n\nwhom we\n\nThe great literature which they produced was filled with it. They named the stars and planets after characters in the myths. They told stories of dimly remembered ancestors whom they made the sons of the various gods and goddesses. They named their children this religion.\n\nafter these\n\ngod-descended “heroes.”\n\nAfter Christianity was established, the old religion died out and Europeans no longer believed in the old Greek and Roman gods. Those gods and the myths about them lived on in memory, however. The old literature did not die; it was too great to be allowed to die. We read Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey even today. We read the great plays written by the Greek dramatists. We read Aesop’s fables and the historical and philosophical works of the Greeks and Romans. All are full of the gods and the myths. In fact, the old Greek stories were so fascinating that even after Christianity was established, men did not consider themselves really educated unless and until they had learned those stories. Educated men introduced words from the myths into their speaking and some of those words remained in the language. For that reason, traces of the Greek myths are to be found today in every European tongue, including English. For instance, a police car’s signal is a siren and a sea cow is a sirenian. circus organ is a calliope; a jelly-fish is a medusa; and an Australian anteater is an echidna. We call out in a stentorian voice; listen to a kindly mentor or a bearded nestor; despise a hectoring bully. In every case mentioned, we are drawing upon the Greek stories, where a Siren was a death trap, Calliope a goddess, Medusa and Echidna horrible monsters, and Stentor, Mentor, Nestor, and Hector were men. Scientists, particularly, drew upon the old myths. Until quite recently, Latin and Greek were the common languages of learned men of all nations. When some new animal or planet or chemical or phenomenon needed to be named, it would have been inconvenient if scientists of\n\nA\n\neach nationality used names drawn from their\n\nown\n\nlan-\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n12\n\nguage.\n\nwhich\n\nThe\n\nhabit arose of giving a Latin or\n\nall nationalities\n\nGreek name\n\ncould use.\n\nSince the Greek myths are so well known it was natural to take words from those myths whenever they seemed to fit the situation. For instance, when uranium was first being broken down by fission during World War II, a new element was found amid the deadly radioactive heat. It was named “promethium” after Prometheus, a character in the Greek myths who dared the deadly radioactive heat of the sun to bring fire to mankind. Most of us are introduced to Greek myths in childhood but are taught to think of them only as interesting fairy tales and adventure stories. However, as you see, they are more than that. They are part of our culture, and much of our language, particularly our scientific language, is derived from them. What I would like to do, then, in this book, is to go over some of the Greek myths once again and see how they gave rise to words and expressions we use today. I want to show the manner in which these old, old stories, which have been living now for three thousand years, still penetrate our daily lives. By understanding the myths, we will understand ourselves better. For instance, let’s begin, as the Greeks did, with the beginning.\n\n1 THE BEGINNING\n\nthe Greeks imagined that, to begin with, the universe was composed of completely mixed and confused matter. Nothing had any particular shape or form. The universe was merely a raw material out of which nothing had yet been made. The Greeks called this raw material Chaos. The word “chaos” means, in Greek, an open gulf. The word “chasm,” which means that also, comes from the same root as does chaos. The original chaos can be pictured, then, as something like outer space, but with\n\nnone\n\nof the stars and planets\n\nformed yet. Everything existed merely as a kind of swirling and transparent vapor. Only emptiness, only a vast open gulf, would then seem to exist.\n\n(Actually,\n\nmodem\n\nscientists think that is\n\nhow\n\nthe\n\nuniverse really did exist to begin with.) still use the word “chaos” today to express anything that is in hopeless confusion and disorder, even if it’s just a room with its contents scattered all about.\n\nWe\n\nThe word has come down\n\nto us in another\n\nand more 13\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n14\n\nfamiliar form, but\n\none which\n\nis practically\n\nnever recog-\n\nnized.\n\nAbout 1600, a Flemish chemist named Jan Baptista van Helmont was studying the vapors that were produced when charcoal was burned. He was interested also in the airlike bubbles formed when fruit juice was allowed to stand.\n\nThese vapors and\n\ndifferent kinds of “airs”\n\nwere not\n\nlike\n\nA\n\nthe ordinary liquids and solids that chemists deal with. vapor has no shape of its own. When it is inside a container, the container seems empty. Such a substance, without shape or form, is an example of chaos. Van Helmont decided to use a name for it that was suggested by the word. His language was Flemish (a dialect of Dutch) and he spelled “chaos” according to the Flemish pronunciation “gas.” Now the fuel that is used in automobiles today is liquid as it is pumped into the fuel tank. In the engine, however, it vaporizes and turns into a gas. It is only a gas that can combine with air to drive the pistons and run the engine. Because the liquid turns into gas so easily, it is named “gasoline.” Americans usually call it “gas” for short. So when we “step on the gas” we are using a word that traces all the way back to the Greek word for the original state of the universe. And when, during a morning rush hour, too many motorists are stepping on the gas at the\n\n—\n\nsame\n\nchaos indeed. When things with form and shape were created out of Chaos, the result was Cosmos. This is a Greek word meaning “order” and “good arrangement” and is therefore just the opposite of Chaos. It is quite common, nowadays, to refer to the universe as the “cosmos.” The word comes into play in other ways, too. For instance, in 1911, a new type of radiation was time, the result\n\nis\n\ndiscovered, which seemed to be bombarding the earth from all sides. The radiation seemed to be coming from everywhere in the universe, from the whole cosmos, in fact. Therefore, the American physicist Robert A. Millikan suggested in 1925 that they be called “cosmic rays” and that is what they are now known as. “Cosmic” also means vast and all-important, like the universe itself and a\n\nTHE BEGINNING\n\n15\n\n“cosmopolitan” is one who considers himself to be part of the whole world rather than part of but one small section of it. On the other hand, a small world, such as an anthill is a “microcosm,” “micro” meaning “small.” There is an even better-known trace of “cosmos.” Since cosmos means good arrangement, the powder, rouge, lipstick, mascara and other means of putting a face into better arrangement are “cosmetics.” And, sure enough, to see some beauticians at work does indeed make it look as though they are using make up to form a Cosmos out of a Chaos. In most systems of myths, the first beings to be formed out of the original chaos are not men, but gods. Gods are usually pictured as having the appearance of men, though sometimes they are partly or entirely animal in appearance. They differ from men in that they are much more powerful. They can control the forces of nature. They can direct the sun, or hurl lightning, or lash the sea with hurricanes, or make the plants grow, or let loose plague. Usually, they are pictured as immortal. In the most familiar form of the Greek myths, the first beings to come out of chaos were Gaia and Ouranos. Now “gaia” is the Greek word for “earth,” and “ouranos” is the Greek word for “sky,” so this is like saying that out of the original Chaos, Earth and Sky were formed. The Greeks pictured the earth as female (we ourselves speak of “mother Earth”) and so Gaia was not only the physical earth itself, but also a female god (a “goddess”) that symbolized the earth. She was the “goddess of the earth.” In the same way, Ouranos was the “god of the sky.” Eventually, when the Latin-speaking Romans conquered Greece, they were fascinated by the Greek way of life and adopted as much of it as they could. They were very interested in the Greek gods and goddesses, for instance. However, in writing of these gods and goddesses, they spelled the names according to a system of their own. The Latin alphabet was different from that of the Greeks and to keep the correct pronunciation, they had to change the letter combinations. For instance, there is no “k” in the Latin alphabet so\n\n16\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\nwherever the Greeks used a “k,” as in “kosmos,” the Romans used a “c” as in “cosmos.” Where the Greeks used “ou” and “ai,” the Romans usually substituted “u” and “ae.” The Greeks often ended names with “os,” but the Romans almost always changed that to “us.”\n\nThus the Roman\n\nspelling of the\n\nname\n\nof the\n\nGreek\n\ngoddess of the earth is Gaea, and for the Greek god of the sky, Uranus. Our modem English names generally follow the Roman spelling rather than the Greek, because our alphabet is almost the same as the Latin alphabet. Often, however, we simplify the names by dropping the final “us,” or changing a final “ius” to a final “y.” In this book, I will use the English versions of the Latin spellings. However, our pronunciation of letter combinations is not the same as die Roman pronunciation. For instance, “Gaia” in Greek and “Gaea” in Latin are both pronounced “Gay'yuh.” We, however, pronounce it “Jee'uh.” Again the Greek “Ouranos” and the Latin “Uranus” are both pronounced “Oo'-ruh-nus” but we pronounce it “You'ruh-nus.” In this book, I will give the English pronunciation of the names when that seems necessary, but we must remember that this is not always the way the ancients pronounced the word. The Romans further identified their own gods and goddesses with those of the Greeks. That is, they would suppose one of their gods or goddesses was the same as a particular Greek god or goddess. Then they would substitute their own name for the Greek one. Since many modem European languages developed out of Latin, the Latin names ended up more familiar to us than the Greek names. For instance, the Roman goddess of the earth had two names, Terra and Tellus. Both of these were identified with Gaea, and both are more often used in English than Gaea is. Thus, in science-fiction stories, a human being may be called an “Earthling,” a “Terrestrial” or a “Tellurian,” but never a “Gaean.” Again, a being from another planet is almost always called an “extra-terrestrial,” where “extra” is the Latin word for “outside.” raised Terra appears in more familiar words, too.\n\nA\n\nTHE BEGINNING\n\nbank\n\nof earth\n\nabout us\n\nis\n\nis\n\n17\n\nand the shape of the landscape The tract of land over which a\n\na “terrace”\n\nthe “terrain.”\n\nnation exists is its “territory.” Tellus has not left as many traces, but one important one is to be found in chemistry. In 1798, a German chemist named Martin Heinrich Klaproth suggested a name for a new element that had been discovered fifteen years earlier. He had already named an element for the sky, and he felt he ought to give the earth similar credit. He chose Tellus to symbolize the earth and he named the element “tellurium.” However, Gaea is not entirely forgotten. There are a number of English words that have the prefix “geo-” to remind us of that ancient goddess. The most familiar of these are “geography” (“description of the earth”), “geology” (“science of the earth”), and “geometry” (“measurement of the earth”). The first use of geometry was, in fact, the surveying or measuring of the earth, in order that the boundaries of farms might be determined. Again, the Greek theory that the earth was at the center of the universe and that the sun, moon and planets revolve about it is called the “geocentric theory.” The study of the physical processes on and within the earth, such as its heat or magnetism or the movement of currents in the sea or winds in the air, is “geophysics.” Thus, the “International Geophysical Year” which ran from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958, and during which the first man-made satellites were launched, contains a reference to Gaea. Similar words are based on Uranus. “Uranography” is the description of the constellations of the sky and “uranology” is the science of the sky (for which the more com-\n\nmon\n\nword, however, is “astronomy”). Uranus, however, gained a fame in modem science that none of the Earth goddesses could match. In 1781, a German-bom English astronomer, William Herschel, discovered a new planet more distant than any that were\n\nknown before. Until that known were bright objects\n\ndate, all the planets that\n\nin the sky that\n\nand that had been recognized\n\nwere\n\nwere\n\neasily seen\n\nin prehistoric times.\n\nThe\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n18\n\nnew\n\nplanet was a very faint object, however, barely visible to the naked eye. Herschel wanted to call the new planet “Georgium Sidus” (which is Latin for “George’s star”) after George III, who was then King of England. Other astronomers suggested it be named “Herschel” after the discoverer. Neither suggestion was adopted. All the other planets had been named after ancient gods and goddesses and the custom was kept. The new planet was named Uranus at the suggestion of a German astronomer named Johann\n\nBode. of the new planet created quite a sensation and Uranus thus gained a new fame that brought his name to the lips of many men who had never heard, or who had forgotten, the Greek myth. However, something happened a few years after the discovery of Uranus which, eventually, made the god’s name even more sensa-\n\nThe discovery\n\ntional.\n\nIn 1789, Klaproth (the chemist I mentioned a bit earlier) discovered a new metal. Now it had been an oldfashioned habit of the chemists of the Middle Ages to name metals after the planets in the sky. Klaproth felt he ought to name his new metal after the new planet, so he called the metal “uranium” (and later named another element tellurium, to balance matters, as I said above). Nowadays, as the result of the development of the atomic bomb, the word uranium is famous indeed. The oldest of the Greek gods still lives in a word connected with the newest and most dreadful of scientific weapons. Uranus and Gaea were considered by the ancient Greeks as man and wife, giving birth to children. Picture the rain falling from the sky (Uranus) to the earth (Gaea) and bringing about the growth of plants, and you can see that the Greeks were symbolizing this when they talked of marriage and children. Many of the children of this ancient couple were ferocious beings of tremendous size and power, called Gigantes, or, in English, “giants.” These probably represented the destructive forces of nature. From these giants, we get the word “gigantic” for anything of very large size. person who grows to unusual\n\nA\n\nTHE BEGINNING\n\n19\n\nheights because of hormone troubles is said, by doctors, to suffer from “gigantism.” Circus giants are usually sufferers\n\nof this disease. Many of the giants were monstrous as well as large. Some were pictured as having a hundred arms. Others possessed a single, staring eye in the middle of the forehead. These were called Cyclops, which in Greek means “round-eyed.” They were supposed to work in forges in volcanoes, from whence mysterious rumblings could often be heard and from which molten rock and ashes occasionally shot out when, the Greeks supposed, the fires of the forge grew too high. The Cyclops might well symbolize volcanoes altogether, since the volcano has a crater at the top, like a single eye, staring at heaven. The Cyclops were also supposed to manufacture the lightning bolts, so that they eventually came to symbolize that form of destructive power as well. In fact, the first three Cyclops bom of Uranus and Gaea, were named Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, which are the Greek words for “thunder,” “lightning,” and “brightness.” This is one way of saying that when rain descends from Uranus to\n\nGaea, thunder and lightning are sometimes bom of the process and a brightness results. Brontes is sometimes used as a term for a blacksmith. The Cyclops were supposed to have built the walls of Mycenae and Tiryns, two cities that were the most powerful of all in the very early days of Greece. When Greece was at its height, however, those two cities were merely mined villages and the Greeks then wondered how they came to have such huge walls made of tremendous rocks fitted together without mortar. They decided that only giant beings, like the Cyclops, could have piled those rocks. As a result, even today, walls made of large rocks without mortar are called “cyclopean.” In fact, the word is a less familiar synonym of “gigantic.” Yet Cyclops is a name given to a tiny water flea not more than a twentieth of an inch long. The name isn’t given it because of its size of course, but because it seems to have a single eye in the middle of its head. (Actually, though, the eye is double.) >\n\n2 the titans\n\nthe most important of the gigantic offspring of Uranus and Gaea were a group of creatures, both male and female, who were called Titans and Titanesses. Since the Greeks presented these usually (but not always) as\n\nmendous\n\ngiants, the\n\nword\n\n“titan” has\n\ntre-\n\nbecome synonymous\n\nwith “giant.” Something which is described as “gigantic” may also be described as “titanic.” In 1911, a giant ship, the largest in existence at that time, was launched. To express its size, it was named the Titanic. It was thought to be so large and so advanced as to be unsinkable. In fact, so certain were the builders and owners of its unsinkability that they didn’t bother very much with such things as lifeboats, life preservers, emergency drills and so on. On April 14, 1912, on its very first voyage, it struck an iceberg. The supposedly unsinkable ship sank in less than three hours. Of the 2206 passengers, over 1500 drowned.\n\nwas the\n\nIt\n\nPerhaps 20\n\ngreatest ship disaster in if\n\nthe owners\n\nall\n\nhistory.\n\nhad known mythology and been\n\nTHE TITANS\n\nmore\n\n21\n\nhave avoided such a boastful name. That was the kind of pride which the Greeks believed was sure to be followed by destruction, as I shall explain later in the book. Besides, the Titans themselves underwent complete destruction in the myths, so to use their name may have been a bad omen, superstitious people might think. Turning to chemistry again, Klaproth, who had introduced the names of Uranus and of Tellus (the Roman superstitious they might\n\nof elements, did the same for their sons, the Titans. In 1791, a new metal had been discovered by an English clergyman named William Gregor. Klaproth’s suggestion that it be named “titanium” was accepted. As a matter of fact, that name turns out, quite by coincidence, to be a good one. When titanium is impure it is rather brittle and useless. Recently, however, chemists have succeeded in preparing titanium in quite pure form, and it then turns out to be the strongest metal known. The name titanium fits its titanic strength.\n\nGaea)\n\ninto the\n\nSome\n\nlist\n\nprehistoric animals of great size are also\n\nnamed\n\nfor these giants of mythology. There is a type of dinosaur called “titanosaurus” (“titanic lizard”) and, for that mat-\n\none called “gigantosaurus” (“giant lizard”) and another called “brontosaurus” (“thunder lizard”) which recalls Brontes, one of the Cyclops I mentioned earlier. There is also an ancient species of giant rhinoceros called “titanotherium” (“titanic beast”). ter,\n\nof the Titans was Cronus. He led a revolt of the Titans against their father, Uranus. Gaea had grown tired of giving birth to giants and monsters. Consequently, she armed Cronus with a scythe and with this he attacked Uranus and drove him away.\n\nThe most powerful\n\nmanner, the Greeks may have symbolized their belief that originally earth and sky were close together. Cronus and his brother Titans symbolized the sun, moon and planets which drove earth and sky apart and took over the vast space between. In this way, the universe was In\n\nthis\n\nput into\n\nits final\n\nshape.\n\nThe word Cronus\n\nis\n\nnot Greek in\n\nits\n\norigin\n\nand\n\nis\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n22\n\nprobably a hangover from those who inhabited Greece before the Greeks themselves arrived. It was easy to suppose that the unfamiliar word, Cronus, was actually the familiar Greek word “Chronos,” meaning “time.” For that reason, Cronus was frequently considered to be the “god of time.” Even today, “Father Time” is usually pictured as an old man carrying a scythe, the weapon with which Cronus defeated Uranus. That is the\n\nmost familiar way in which Cronus lingers on into modem times and it is a wrong one. (An old woman is sometimes called a “crone” but this has no connection with Cronus. It comes from an old Danish word and the similarity is a coincidence.) To the people who preceded the Greeks, Cronus was probably a god of agriculture. The scythe with which he was supposed to have attacked his father, Uranus, was originally a tool for harvesting grain, nothing more deadly than that. The Romans had a god of agriculture called Saturn, and they identified him with Cronus. The Romans honored Saturn during a week-long celebration from the 19th to the 26th of December. This celebration was called the “Saturnalia.” There was great jollity, much feasting, and an exchange of presents. Some of the atmosphere lingers on into our modem celebration of Christmas at the same *\n\ntime of year.\n\nHowever, so much wildness and drunkenness developed during the celebration that nowadays the word “saturnalia” means a wild, drunken party. The Greeks associated Cronus with the sixth planet (counting our earth as one of the planets, the third). This may be because, of the planets known to the Greeks, the sixth planet was farthest from the earth and therefore the nearest to the outer limits of the sky. Could it be that it seemed to be leading the attack against the god of the sky (Uranus) and was therefore rightly named Cronus? Another possibility is this. The sixth planet is also the farthest planet from the sun of all the planets known to the Greeks. The sun’s gravitation is weak at that distance and the sixth planet moves more slowly than any other planet the Greeks knew. It moves so slowly that it takes\n\nTHE TITANS\n\n23\n\n29 V2 years to make a complete circuit of the sky against the background of the stars. With such a slow and majestic movement, it might have seemed to the Greeks that it ought to be symbolized by an old, old god. Cronus seemed the natural choice. The Romans naturally called the planet “Saturn” that\n\nis\n\nthe\n\nname that has come down to\n\nus.\n\nSaturn has a thin set of rings encircling equator.

This satellite was this,\n\nnumber six (counting outward from Saturn) and was named “Titan.” This is a poor name, really, because it isn’t the name of a god, but of a whole group of gods. Most of the remaining satellites of Saturn were named after individual Titans\n\nto associate\n\nand Titanesses, for\n\nthem with Saturn\n\nit\n\nseemed\n\nfitting\n\nin the heavens.

Of all the Titanesses memorialized among Saturn’s satellites, Rhea was the most important. She was the wife of Cronus and since she was also associated with agriculanother version of the earth goddess. She was the mother, as I shall explain later, of the chief gods and goddesses actually worshiped by the Greeks, so she was called “The Mother of the Gods” and was held in high honor. (For some reason, her name has been given to a group of ostrichlike birds, the “rheas,” who are to be found in South America.) About 200 B.c. the Romans took over a goddess named Cybele (si'bi-lee) who was originally worshiped in Asia Minor as a goddess of agriculture. The Romans identified her with Rhea and worshiped her as “Magna Mater” ture originally, she\n\nis\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n24\n\n(“Great Mother”) or “Alma Mater” (“Fostering Mother”). That phrase “alma mater” is now applied to a man’s college, which has been a fostering mother, one that feeds and protects, to his mind. Not all the Titans and Titanesses are memorialized\n\namong\n\nthe satellites of Saturn.

The Greeks oldest of the Titans\n\nweren’t sure that water encircled all the land, of course. They were only familiar with the Mediterranean Sea and the land about it. That means southern Europe, northern Africa and western Asia. In three of the four directions, they knew only of continuous land (which is why Europe, Asia and Africa, and any large stretch of land is called a “continent”). However, the Mediterranean Sea stretched off westward until it came to what we call today the Strait of Gibraltar. There, Europe and Africa almost meet, but not quite.

Of course as men grew to know the world better, it was found that the world-river was not a river at all, but a vast stretch of open salt water like the Mediterranean but\n\nmuch for of\n\nThe name of the Titan course we call such a large\n\nlarger.\n\nlingers on, however,\n\nstretch of water\n\nan\n\n“ocean.”\n\nThe Greeks turned out to be right in one respect about the world-river.

Because New Guinea and thousands of smaller islands are surrounded by the largest of the oceans, the Pacific Ocean, they are lumped together under the name of “Oceania.” Thus, land the Greeks never saw is named after the Titan of their imagination. As for Tethys, the wife of Oceanus, she has received her memorial (aside from being a satellite of Saturn) in a less common way. Scientists, tracing the past history of the earth, have learned that the pattern of land and sea was not always the same. Some hundreds of millions of years ago, there was a large stretch of water, running\n\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean across Asia. The Mediterranean Sea is a modern remnant of that ancient stretch of water. The Austrian geologist named it the “Tethys Sea.”\n\nEduard Suess\n\nPerhaps the best known of all the Titans is Atlas. He may or may not have been a second-generation Titan. That is, some of the ancient Greek writers describe him as a son of Uranus and a brother of Cronus, Oceanus, Iapetus and the other Titans. Others describe him as the son of Iapetus and the grandson of Uranus, so that he would be the nephew of Cronus and Oceanus. This is not very important except that it shows there is nothing certain in mythology. Each Greek writer felt free to tell the myths in his own way and the information you get depends on the one read. In any case, Atlas joined the other Titans in a war against younger and more powerful gods. He may even have been the Titan general. He and the other Titans were defeated and, as punishment, Atlas was condemned to support the heavens on his shoulders. (In fact, the name “Atlas” comes from a Greek word meaning “to support.”) The Greeks pictured Atlas as standing in the far west near the straits of Gibraltar, their usual misty region of wonders. When the western region was better explored, they naturally found no Atlas there, but they did find a region of mountains, so they decided that at some time in the past, Atlas had been turned to stone. The range of\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n26\n\nmountains in Morocco and Algeria are still called the “Atlas Mountains.” Atlas was supposed to have been the father of various groups of young goddesses called the Atlantides (Atlan'ti-deez). They were also called the Hesperides (Hesper'i-deez) from a Greek word meaning “west” because, like their father, they were pictured as dwelling in the far west.\n\nTo\n\nthe ancient Greeks, by the way, any minor goddess pictured as a young girl was a nymph, which was the Greek word for “young girl.” In zoology, the young forms of certain insects are called “nymphs,” for this reason. The Greeks pictured the nymphs as symbolizing the various objects of nature. There were nymphs living in trees, in rocks and mountains, in lakes and rivers. They were what we might call the “spirit” of a particular tree or a particular brook. The Atlantides were nymphs associated with the sea. Other such nymphs were the Oceanids, the daughters of Oceanus, of course, and the Nereids, the daughters of an old god of the sea named Nereus. The Atlantides were associated with the far western waters of Oceanus, so that those waters were called “Atlantic” as well as “Ocean” and today we call it “Atlantic Ocean.” Thus both Atlas and Oceanus leave their traces on the name of the second largest ocean, to say nothing of such cities as Atlanta, Georgia, and Atlantic City and Ocean City in New Jersey. In 355 B.C., when the Greek philosopher Plato made up a story about a great land in the western Ocean which sank beneath the waters after an earthquake, he called it “Atlantis.” It was pure fiction, of course, but there have been people ever since who have insisted that Atlantis really existed.\n\nAs\n\ntime went on, it became difficult to picture Atlas as holding up the sky. The Greeks learned more about astronomy and decided that the sky had to be at least millions of miles from the earth. Besides, they decided, the sky has no tendency to fall and need not be held up. So the notion arose of Atlas supporting the earth rather than the sky. In fact, when Atlas is pictured these days it\n\nTHE TITANS\n\n27\n\nweary figure with the great globe of the earth weighing down on one shoulder while he steadies it with one tremendous arm. There is a bone in the human body which seems to do the job of Atlas. The globe of the head rests on the spine, which is made up of a series of bones running down the length of the back. The topmost one of these bones, which supports the head, is naturally called the “atlas.” Now when the early geographers began to make books of maps of various regions of the earth, they used to put on the cover a picture of Atlas holding up the earth. In the 1500’s, the Flemish geographer Gerhardus Mercator drew up the first modern maps, and he called his book of such maps an “atlas” from the picture on the cover. Ever since, a book of maps and, indeed, any book of is\n\nas a gigantic,\n\n—\n\ndrawings or pictures illustrating some subject, such as the anatomy of a human being is called an atlas. In zoology, Atlas, like Titan, can be used to indicate tremendous size. An ancient dinosaur that is supposed to have been the largest of all, stretching a hundred feet from the tip of its head to the end of its long tail, is called “Atlantosaurus” (the “Atlas-like lizard”). Similarly, the “Atlas beetle” is a very large beetle and the “Atlas moth” a very large moth. And very modern examples are two powerful ballistic missiles being built by the United States, the “Atlas” and the “Titan.” An even more powerful missile is the “Sat-\n\n—\n\nurn.”\n\nThe Titan Hyperion, who is included as one of the satellites of Saturn, was originally considered the god of the sun. However, as time went on, this became the function of Hyperion’s son, Helios (Hee'-lee-os). Perhaps the most important trace of Helios in modern English is the result of an eclipse of the sun that took place in India in 1868. The light of the sun’s glowing\n\natmosphere was allowed to pass through an instrument called a spectroscope. In doing so, the light was split up into a series of bright lines of different colors.\n\nEach\n\nline\n\nwas the mark of a particular element in the sun’s atmosphere and could be duplicated in the light of elements\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n28\n\nknown on\n\nwhen\n\nthese were heated to a white-hot glow. There was but one exception. One line in the sun’s light was not like the line produced by any known element on the earth. earth\n\nastronomer Norman Lockyer decided it must be produced by an element that occurred only in the sun. He named that element “helium.” Twenty-seven years later, that element was discovered on the earth, too, but by then the name was firmly stuck. The element is still called helium, the “element of the\n\nThe\n\nBritish\n\nsun.”\n\nThe to\n\nprefix “helio-”\n\nis\n\ndo with the sun.

The first was goddess of the moon, the second, goddess of the dawn. Thus, the three children of Hyperion symbolized the three important sources of light on the earth; the sun, the moon, and the light of dawn that spreads over the earth before the sun rises. (Of course, the light of dawn is caused by the sun shining on the upper atmosphere before its light reaches the ground itself, but the mythmakers either didn’t know this or didn’t care.) Like Helios, Selene leaves traces in the table of chemical elements. In 1818, a Swedish chemist, Jons Jacob Berzelius, discovered an element very like tellurium; a kind of twin sister, so to speak. Since tellurium had been named after a goddess of the earth (as I explained earlier in the book), Berzelius decided to balance matters by naming the new element after a goddess of the moon. He less\n\nis\n\nchose Selene and named the new element “selenium.” Eos, the third source of light, does not enter the list of elements, but she is not forgotten. Eos symbolized not only the dawn to the Greeks, but also the direction in\n\nTHE TITANS\n\n29\n\nappeared. The English word for that direction is “east” which, as you see, is similar. The prefix “eo-” is used in words meaning anything which occurs at the very beginning, the dawn, of something. For instance, after the dinosaurs died out, a period\n\nwhich\n\nit\n\nbegan in which the birds and mammals were most important. This is the “Cenozoic” period from Greek words meaning “new animals.” Well, the first part of the Cenozoic period is called the “Eocene” (“dawn of the new”). Then, again, scientists have studied the bones of very in earth’s history\n\nancient horselike animals. The oldest ern horse which they could find was than a fox, with four toes on each “Eohippus” (“dawn horse”). Finally, primitive tools are found\n\nwere\n\nleft\n\nbehind by ancient\n\nancestor of the\n\nmod-\n\nan animal no larger foot.

The oldest of all are so primitive, scientists can’t be quite sure whether they were formed by men or whether they just took on crude tool-like shapes by the accidental action of wind and water. Those most primitive tools are called “eoliths” (“dawn stones”). The Romans had their own gods and goddesses of these various forms of light. They identified their god Sol with Helios, their goddess Luna with Selene, and their goddess Aurora (Aw-ro'ruh) with Eos. In each case, it is the\n\nRoman name\n\nthat\n\nis\n\nbetter\n\nknown\n\nin English.\n\na common adjective in English to describe anything pertaining to the sun, and “lunar” serves the same purpose in connection with the moon. For instance, the sun, and the planets circling it, are called the “solar system.” The period of time in which the earth circles the sun just once is the “solar year.” On the other hand, the period of time in which the moon circles the earth just once is a “lunar month.” Twelve lunar months is a “lunar year,” which is eleven days shorter than a solar year. There are other traces too. room open to the sun for sun-bathing purposes is a “solarium.” small sunshade is a “parasol,” a word which comes from Italian words meaning “to guard against the sun.” As for the moon, its\n\nThe word\n\n“solar”\n\nis\n\nA\n\nA\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n30\n\nmost dramatic shape\n\nof course, the crescent, and to say something is “lunate” is to say it is crescent-shaped. The Roman goddess Aurora leaves her name on a very beautiful phenomenon indeed. Tiny particles called electrons are fired out from the sun and collect in the space around the earth because they are trapped there by the is,\n\nmagnetism. There\n\nalways a slow leakage of these electrons down into the earth’s atmosphere in the far north and far south. There, the earth’s magnetism is strongest. When the electrons strike the atoms of the upper atmosphere, they cause them to glow in faint colors. As seen from the surface of the earth, colored sheets and streamers appear in the sky. This is very common in the polar regions, but is only occasionally seen as far south as London or New York. When it is, there is always amazement that light like the light of dawn should appear in the north rather than in the east. We call this phenomenon the “Northern Lights” in plain English. The French astronomer, Pierre Gassendi, called it the “Aurora Borealis” (“northern dawn”) in 1621. Then, in 1773, the English explorer, James Cook, sailed far enough south to see the “Southern Lights” and these he called “Aurora Australis” (“southern dawn”). earth’s\n\nis\n\nThere were daughters of Uranus and Gaea who were neither giants nor Titans. Some of them, however, represented terrors that were more frightful than mere monstrous size and shape could be. For instance, there were the three Erinnyes (Uh-rin'i-eez). These sisters punished those who were guilty of particularly horrible crimes. They pursued them, gave them no rest and drove them mad. Probably they symbolized conscience and remorse, those feelings inside a man which can indeed bring him lifelong misery over a wrong he regrets having committed. The Greeks often called these sisters the Eumenides (Yoo-men'i-deez), meaning the “kindly ones,” in order to keep them kindly by telling them that was what they were. (This habit of calling something unpleasant by a pleasant\n\nname\n\nin order to avoid unpleasantness is called\n\n“euphemism” from Greek words meaning “To speak well.”)\n\nTHE TITANS\n\n31\n\ncalled these avenging women Furia (“Furies” in English) and we inherit the word “fury” as a result. Originally, this meant a kind of raging madness of\n\nThe Romans\n\nFuries, one in which a person woman, in particular, was not responsible for his deeds. behaving in this fashion, is called a Fury. With time, the the sort brought\n\non by the\n\nA\n\nword weakened, and now\n\nto be “furious”\n\nmeans only\n\nto\n\nbe very angry.\n\nAnother set of three ancient sisters are the Moirae. These may be the daughters, or the nieces of Uranus. They controlled the course of the universe. The Greeks felt\n\nthat the entire course\n\nand could not be\n\naltered.\n\nwas Even\n\nout at the beginning the gods were helpless to\n\nlaid\n\ninterfere.\n\nThe\n\nthree Moirae were\n\nnamed Clotho\n\n(kloh'thoh),\n\nLachesis (lak'is-is), and Atropos (at'ro-pos). Clotho is pictured as spinning all the threads that represent life for all the individuals alive. In fact the name means “the spinner” in Greek. In ordinary life, threads that are spun are usually woven into “cloth” out of which, most often, “clothes” are made. These English words come from the Anglo-Saxon, but they must be related to Clotho. The word “lachesis” means “lot” in Greek. They imagined each child as drawing some lot when he was bom which decided what his life would be like. Lachesis controls the nature of this lot by guiding and measuring the length of thread spun by Clotho. Of course, Lachesis doesn’t work by chance. Some Greeks thought that a person’s lot was what he deserved, or what he “merited” and the word “merit” is related to “Moirae.” It is possible to merit either good or evil but naturally everyone wants to merit good and the word has been slanted in that direction. To say someone or something “has merit” implies that it is good or worthwhile. Finally, at the point indicated by Lachesis, Atropos, who is usually pictured with a pair of shears, cuts the cord. That meant death. “Atropos” in Greek means “not turning.” Atropos was not to be turned away from her purpose by anyone or anything. There was no way of stopping her.\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n32\n\nAtropos leaves a trace of herself in modem chemistry. There is a plant called “belladonna” (Italian for “beautiful lady”) from which a juice can be obtained for use as eyedrops. Such eyedrops cause the pupils of the eye to enlarge. Women using these drops felt that this gave their eyes a beautiful dark appearance, which is why the plant received its name. The belladonna juice, however, is very poisonous, if swallowed. When the Swedish botanist, Carolus Linnaeus, was classifying plants in the late 1700’s, he gave the belladonna group the general name “Atropa.” The belladonna plant, in other words, could cut the thread of life as surely as Atropos ever could. Then, in 1831, the poisonous chemical in belladonna juice was located and\n\nnamed “atropine.” The Romans also visualized three sisters determining the lot of men. They called them the Parcae (par'see) from a Latin word meaning “to bring forth” because the actions of these sisters brought forth the future. The Romans (and the Greeks, too) believed that they didn’t always have\n\nthe end to see what future would bring forth. They felt the future could be revealed in advance by the gods. Systems for revealing the future were called “oracles,” from a Latin word meaning “to speak,” because a common way of receiving an oracle was to have a priestess go into a trance and speak what were supto wait\n\ntill\n\nposedly the words of the god.\n\nThe\n\npriestesses\n\nwere usually careful to pronounce\n\noracles that didn’t predict the future too clearly but could be interpreted in at least two different ways. Thus, they\n\nFor\n\nan “oracular” statement is one which does not have a straightforward meaning but can be taken either way. The most famous oracle of all was at a Greek town named Delphi, so such a confusing statement can also be said to be “delphic.” Another word for oracle was “fatum,” from another Latin word meaning “to speak.” Since oracles dealt with the future, which was, after all, decided by the three Parcae (or Moirae), the Romans called the three sisters played\n\nit\n\nsafe.\n\nthat reason,\n\n“Fata” also. In English, we therefore speak of the “Three Fates”\n\nTHE TITANS\n\n33\n\nand also of “fate” as meaning a future which cannot be changed. A person who believes that nothing in the future can be changed, that all is decided upon in advance, is a “fatalist.”\n\nby the way, whom the Romans identified with Atropos is Morta, from a Latin word meaning “death.” She is what we would call the “Angel of\n\nThe\n\nthird of the Parcae,\n\nDeath.” We use the word often enough. Man is “mortal” because he is fated to die; the gods are “immortal” (“not wound is “mortal” if it brings death and a dying”). “mortician” is an undertaker. The Greeks recognized a softer side to death. After a long and weary life, death might even come as a rest. For that reason, they considered Thamtos, the god of death, to be a brother of Hypnos, the god of sleep. Thanatos has not left any well-kn own traces, but he\n\nA\n\nAmerican\n\nenters the history of\n\nliterature.\n\nThe\n\nfirst\n\ngreat\n\nAmerican poem was written in 1817 by William Cullen Bryant who was then twenty-three years old.

An artificial sleep brought on by drugs or by suggestion is “hypnosis,” and a sleeping\n\npill is\n\na “hypnotic.”\n\nThe Roman god of sleep is Somnus. When we are sleepy, we are “somnolent.” Sleepwalking is “somnambulism” which in Latin means exactly that, “sleepwalking.” The son of Somnus is Morpheus (mor'fyoos), the god of dreams.

Consequently a large sum of money is described as a “fortune”; a happy or lucky person is said to be “fortunate,” while a sad or unlucky one is “unfortunate.” Fortuna is the name of one of the planetoids, by the way; that of the nineteenth to be discovered.\n\nbe\n\n3 THE OLYMPIANS\n\nthe rule of the Titans under Cronus did not endure. After Uranus had been defeated and driven off by Cronus, the old god of the sky predicted that Cronus would be treated in the same way by one of his own sons. Therefore, every time Rhea bore a child, Cronus would swallow it. This picture of Cronus swallowing his children had an odd follow-up in the history of astronomy. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first to use a telescope to view the heavens. When he turned it on distant Saturn (the Roman name for Cronus, remember) he just barely\n\nmade\n\nout the rings. Unfortunately, his telescope was too weak to let him make them out clearly. He could only see what looked like two bulges, one on each side of Saturn. Galileo said it was as though old Saturn needed two young sons, one on each side, to help his faltering steps through space. However, the rings are seen at different angles, depending on the positions of Saturn and the earth in their\n\n35\n\n36\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\njourneys about the sun. Occasionally, we see the rings edge-on and they are so thin that at such a time they seem to disappear. When Galileo came to look at Saturn again, that happened to be the situation and he found the two bulges gone. Puzzled and disappointed he exclaimed, “What! Does Saturn still swallow his children?” He did not look at Saturn again and it was left to Huyghens to see the rings as they actually were about half a century later. Cronus did not, however, save himself by swallowing his children. Rhea, annoyed by this habit of her husband’s, dressed a stone in baby clothes and fed it to him in place of her sixth and last child. This last child was Zeus (Zoos). Zeus was secretly raised on the island of Crete, south of Greece. There he was fed on milk supplied by a goat named Amaltheia (am'al-thee'uh). When he had grown to manhood, his mother Rhea helped him trick Cronus into taking a drink that caused the Titan to throw up Zeus’s five brothers and sisters. Since they were immortal gods, they were all alive and well. Zeus, his brothers and sisters and their descendants were called the “Olympians” because the Greeks pictured them as dwelling on Mount Olympus. This mountain, the highest mountain in Greece, nearly ten thousand feet high, stands near the northern boundary of the country. (Of course, later on, the Greeks came to realize that there weren’t really any signs of gods on Mount Olympus and they decided that the real Olympus was high in heaven. In the region of Elis, in southwestern Greece, there were special games every four years in honor of Zeus. The valley in which they were celebrated was called “Olympia” in honor of Mount Olympus, and in later years Phidias, Greece’s greatest sculptor, carved a statue of\n\n“Olympian Zeus” for the site of the games. This statue was considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The first of these “Olympian games” of which there is a record were conducted in 776 b.c. These games were the great event of the Greek world. Winners at the competitions were heaped with honors and the Greeks even counted the years by these games. Every four years was\n\nTHE OLYMPIANS\n\n37\n\nan “Olympiad” and each Olympiad was numbered. With the coming of Christianity, the games were frowned upon as a pagan festival. The Roman Emperor Theodosius put an end to them in a.d. 394 after nearly 300 Olympiads. In 1896, they were revived and the first of the modem version of the games, called the “Olympic games” rather than the Olympian games, was conducted in Greece. Since then, they have been held in various countries, including, several times, in the United States. Except for interruptions during World War I and World War II, they have been continued every four years, as in ancient times. And so we still honor Olympian Zeus, at least in the name we give these games.\n\nTo\n\nreturn to the myths\n\n—The Olympians, having been\n\nrescued from Cronus, accepted the leadership of Zeus, and rebelled against the Titans. The Titans were the stronger as far as brute force was concerned. Zeus, however, took as allies the Cyclops whom, earlier, the Titans had imprisoned. The Cyclops forged lightning bolts for Zeus and by use of the lightning, Zeus defeated the Titans. He imprisoned some of them underground and condemned Atlas, their leader, to hold up the heavens. Some Titans, such as Oceanus, who had remained neutral or even joined the Olympians, were left in peace. This battle between the Titans and the Olympians may have been a symbolic description of the invasion of the land now called Greece by the first Greeks. These brought their gods with them, including Zeus, to displace or absorb the gods of the pre-Greek inhabitants.\n\nThe conquered population, who found themselves under the rule of the Greek strangers, gradually adopted the Greek language and Greek ways. However, they must have remembered their old life with some sorrow, for the exaggerated legend grew up that there had been a “Golden Age” under the rule of Cronus. Then everyone had been happy, eating nuts and fruits and drinking milk. There had been no misery or sickness, and death came easily, like his brother, sleep. history\n\nwhen\n\nit\n\nWe was\n\nstill\n\nspeak of any time in a nation’s\n\nparticularly powerful, or particularly\n\nprosperous, as a “golden age” or a “Saturnian age.”\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n38\n\nThe two brothers of Zeus were Poseidon (poh-sigh'don) and Hades (hay’deez). After the victory over the was agreed\n\nwas to remain the ruler of the Olympians, but the brothers cast lots to see what parts of the universe would be their special care. Zeus received the air, Poseidon the sea and Hades the underworld. As Hades received the underworld, he was considered the god of the dead, for the underworld has always been Titans,\n\nit\n\nthat Zeus\n\nassociated with death. This is perhaps because of the habit of burying the dead underground. (The Greeks themselves in later times burned their dead, but in earlier times, when the myths were first made up, they buried their dead.) As a result, the place where the shades of the dead dwelt was called “Hades” after the god. The word “hades” comes\n\nfrom Greek words meaning “invisible” since the underground world cannot be seen. Hades was thus not really an Olympian, for he did not live in Olympus. Rather he became one of the “chthonian gods” (tho'nee-an); that is, a “god of the underworld.” The Greeks had other chthonian gods and they were usually pictured as frightening and monstrous. They were thought of as having originated from Chaos by a line of birth that did not involve Uranus and Gaea. Chaos gave rise to Nox, the goddess of the darkness of night, and Erebus, the god of the darkness of the underground.\n\nWe\n\nare referring to the goddess of night when we refer to things of the night as “nocturnal.” Similarly, a musical composition meant to be played in the evening is a “nocturne.” As for Erebus, there is a volcano of that name in Antarctica. It is a good name, too, if you think of the long, frigid Antarctic night and the grim crater of the still\n\nvolcano leading down into the further darkness of the underworld. Erebus and Night are considered to be the parents of the Moirae, or Fates. They are also the parents of Tartarus, who was probably the god of the underworld before the invasion of the Greeks brought in the Olympians. Hades displaced Tartarus as Zeus displaced Cronus. Some of the Greek mythmakers, however, kept both Hades and Tartarus. Hades was considered a place where the dead were not particularly mistreated. Beneath it,\n\nTHE OLYMPIANS\n\n39\n\nhowever, was Tartarus, where particularly evil men and gods were sent for punishment. It is Tartarus that probably gave rise to many of the Christian notions\n\nSower\n\nstill,\n\nof Hell.\n\nTartarus\n\nleft its\n\ntrace in a tragic episode in history. In\n\nunder Genghis Khan spread out of their central Asian homeland. They invaded China, Persia, Russia and Poland, killing and destroying. It was probably the most disastrous barbarian invasion in histhe 1200’s, the\n\nMongol\n\ntribes\n\ntory.\n\nThe Mongols\n\nSo dreadful was their invasion, though, that they seemed to convert the earth into Tartarus, and it was a natural mistake to call them “Tartars” instead. As for Hades, the Greek mythmakers had much to say of it. For instance, Hades was described as being bounded by the river Styx. Anything pertaining to the Styx, and therefore to the underworld, is said to be “Stygian.” This word is particularly used in the phrase “Stygian darkness” meaning a great darkness, the darkness of the underworld. For some reason the Styx was considered to be particularly holy in oath-making. An oath by the river Styx dare called themselves “Tatars.”\n\nnot be broken. To enter Hades, one had to be ferried across the Styx by a grim old ferryman named Charon (kay’-ron), another son of Erebus and Nox. This name can be humorously applied to any ferryman. On the other side of the Styx, the entrance to Hades itself is guarded by a three-headed monstrous dog, named Cerberus (sur’buh-rus). Again the name can be applied jokingly to any guardian. Cerberus allowed no one to pass who did not first throw him a ransom in the form of a piece of bread. For that reason, the phrase “to throw a sop to Cerberus” means to pay a bribe to some official in order to get something done. Once within Hades, the spirits of the dead drink from a river\n\nnamed Lethe\n\n“forgetfulness.”\n\nIn\n\n(lee'thee),\n\na\n\nGreek word meaning\n\nthey forget about their former life and become listless, gibbering ghosts. We still speak of anything which causes forgetfulness as “Lethean.” You are liable to be forgetful if you are sleepy drinking,\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n40\n\nor sluggish, and you are then said to be “lethargic.” And since complete forgetfulness comes only with death, we speak of anything deadly as “lethal.” The spirits of the dead need not undergo only gloom and horror. Worthy spirits might go to a special section of Hades where all was blissful and happy. That section was supposed to be ruled over by Cronus rather than Hades, an echo of the legend of the Golden Age. This happy place was called Elysium (ee-li'zhee-um) or the “Elysian Fields .” We still speak of Elysium as a place or time of great happiness and even use it as another word for “heaven.” The French words for Elysian Fields are “Champs Elysees” and that is the name given to a beautiful boule-\n\nvard in Paris.\n\nSome mythmakers\n\nthe Elysian Fields couldn’t be in Hades, and placed them in the far west along with other marvels. They were then called “Islands of the Blessed” or the “Fortunate Isles.” Of course, the underground isn’t only an abode of the dead. It is also the source of metals, especially gold and felt that\n\nof wealth is Plutus, from which we get our word “plutocracy” to mean a government run by the wealthy. silver.\n\nAs\n\nThe god\n\nunderground regions from which wealth came, the god Hades was also given a form of that name, and was called Pluto. a master of the\n\nThe Romans identified two of these brothers with gods of their own. They had a god of the sky called Jupiter,\n\nwhom\n\nthey identified with Zeus; and a god of springs and rivers named Neptune, whom they identified with Poseidon. Both ended among the planets. The Greeks named the fifth planet after Zeus. This was a logical choice because the fifth planet was the brightest except for the evening and morning star. The evening star, however, only appeared for a few hours after sunset and the morning star only for a few hours before dawn, while the fifth planet often shines the whole night through. The Romans, of course, used their own version of the\n\nname and it\n\nis\n\nas “Jupiter” that the planet\n\nis\n\nknown\n\nto us.\n\nTHE OLYMPIANS\n\n41\n\nThe Romans had a second name for Jupiter, and that was Jove. It is not used much by itself except in the old-fashioned exclamation, “by Jove.” However, when an adjective is needed, Jove rather than Jupiter is used. For one never says the “Jupiterian satellites” but always the “Jovian satellites.” Neptune had to wait until modem times for a similar planetary honor. In the early 1800’s, astronomers carefully observed the planet Uranus in order to determine its exact orbit around the sun. They found, to their surprise, that its actual movement lagged a bit behind what their calculations were predicting. Some believed there might be instance,\n\nanother planet beyond Uranus whose gravitational pull was slowing it slightly. An English astronomer, John Couch Adams, and a French astronomer, Urbain J. J. Leverrier, unknown to each other, both calculated where such a planet must be to account for the effect on Uranus. They both came out with the same answer. Leverrier was the first to announce his results and in 1846 an astronomer in Berlin looked at the spot indicated by Leverrier and, behold, there was the eighth planet.\n\nwas named “Neptune,” not for any particular reason, but because Neptune was one important god who lacked a It\n\nplanet.\n\nEven allowing\n\nmotion of Uranus still The American astronomer Percival\n\nfor Neptune, the\n\nlagged a tiny bit. Lowell, in the first years of the twentieth century, therefore searched for another still more distant planet. He failed, but his successors found the ninth planet in 1931. The ninth planet moves farthest from the light of the sun and farthest into the darkness of the space between the stars, so it was named “Pluto.” The first two letters of the name happened to be the initials of Percival Lowell. Pluto is the only important planet to have a Greek name, rather than a Roman one. The Romans had a god of the underworld named Dis and sometimes said “Dis pater” (“Father Dis”) when they meant Hades, but for\n\nsome reason this did not make the impression on the Western World that the other Latin names of gods did. The discovery of Neptune and Pluto had an echo in\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n42\n\nchemistry during World War II. Uranium was the most complicated element known in 1940. All the elements were listed in a chart called a “periodic table” in the order of increasing complexity. The elements went from number 1 to number 92 and uranium was number 92. In 1940, however, chemists at the University of California learned how to manufacture small quantities of new elements which fitted into the period table in places 93 and 94. These new elements were beyond uranium in the table and were therefore named for the planets beyond Uranus. Consequently, element number 93 is known as “neptunium” and element number 94 as “plutonium.” planet Jupiter, as befits one named after the ruler of the gods, has the largest family of satellites in the Solar system. It has twelve. Four of these were discovered by Galileo in 1610. They were the first objects in the solar system to be discovered by the telescope and all are large satellites. Two are larger than our moon and the other two are only slightly smaller. Each of the satellites was named after some person closely connected with Zeus in the\n\nThe\n\nmyths.\n\nFor\n\nZeus was\n\none time in love with a river nymph named Io (eye'oh). However, Zeus was married to Hera (hee'ruh), one of the daughters of Cronus and Rhea, and Hera was a jealous woman. Zeus turned Io into a white cow in order to hide her, but Hera suspected the cow. She sent a giant named Argus to watch her. Now Argus had a hundred eyes and some eyes were always open and watching. For that reason, any watchful, wakeful person is said to be “Argus-eyed.” Zeus, however, had Argus charmed to sleep, all hundred eyes of him, and then killed. Hera set the eyes of Argus in the tail of the peacock, which was her special bird. As a result, a bird closely related to the peacock is called the “Argus pheasinstance,\n\nat\n\nant.”\n\nBut Hera’s suspicions of Io were now confirmed, so she sent a stinging fly to drive her from place to place, never letting her rest. The myth-makers now had Io wander all over the known world. At one point, she crossed the straits separating Europe and Asia at the point where\n\nTHE OLYMPIANS\n\n43\n\nlocated and the straits received the name “Bosporus” meaning “cow crossing.” (Another English equivalent would be “ox ford,” and a very famous town and University has that name though not through any connection with Io.) At another time she swam across the strip of the Mediterranean that separates Greece from southern Italy, and that was therefore named the “Ionian Sea.” Finally, she was allowed to find peace in Egypt. similar story is told of the Nymph CaUisto (Kalis'toe). Zeus turned her into a bear to hide her from Hera. Or, perhaps, Hera did it to punish the nymph. case where it was Zeus him self that was turned into an animal involves a girl (not a nymph, but a human being) named Europa (Yoo-ro'puh). She lived in Phoenicia on the Asiatic coast of the Mediterranean. Zeus changed himself into a white bull that swam out of the sea when she was with her maids at the seashore. The bull seemed so beautiful and tame that Europa climbed on its back. At that point the bull seized its opportunity, plunged into the sea and swam to the island of Crete. Europa was the first human being to arrive in that part of the world, according to the mythmakers, so the continent of which Greece is a part was named “Europe” in her honor. It was a young man who was involved in still another case. This was Ganymede (Gan'i-meed), a handsome young man who was carried off to Olympus by Zeus in the form of an eagle. There Ganymede served as cupbearer, passing out the drinks at the banquets. As a result of these stories, the four Jovian satellites discovered by Galileo were named “Io,” “Europa,” “Ganymede,” and “Callisto” in order of their distance from the planet. The third satellite, Ganymede, is the largest in the solar system. It is 3200 miles in diameter and more massive even than Titan. It was not until 1892 that a fifth Jovian satellite was discovered, by an American astronomer, Edward Emerson Barnard. It was a small satellite, only 100 miles in diameter, circling Jupiter at a distance less than that of even the nearest of the large satellites. This is sometimes called “Barnard’s satellite,” after its Istanbul\n\nA\n\nA\n\nis\n\n44 discoverer,\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS and sometimes “Jupiter\n\nV”\n\nbecause\n\nit\n\nwas the\n\nJovian satellite to be discovered. Its semi-official name, however, is “Amaltheia” after the goat that nursed the infant Zeus. It seems logical that the nurse of his childhood should be closer to him in the heavens than any of the companions of his adulthood. In the 1900’s seven more Jovian satellites were discovered. All of them are very small and quite distant from Jupiter. None have as yet received any names. Passing on to the planet Neptune, it has two satellites and both are related to it in mythology. Thus Poseidon has a son named Triton, who is half man and half fish (a common Greek way of picturing the gods and goddesses of the sea). After Poseidon had brought on a storm, it was Triton’s job to come to the surface and blow a blast on a horn made out of a large sea shell. At the sound of Triton’s horn, the waves were calmed. Only a month after the planet Neptune was discovered, a British astronomer, William Lassell, discovered it had a large satellite, one that was nearly as large as Titan or fifth\n\nGanymede. It was eventually named “Triton.” (To come back to earth, there is a kind of snail that is also called\n\n“Triton” because\n\nits\n\nlarge sea\n\nshell is like\n\nwhich Triton was supposed to have used.) In 1950, the American astronomer G. P. Kuiper discovered a second satellite of Neptune’s, one that was much smaller than Triton. He named it “Nereid” after the fifty sea nymphs that attended Poseidon on his travels through\n\nthat\n\nthe sea.\n\nPluto has no known satellites. Uranus, on the other hand, has five. However, the Uranian satellites are the only ones in the solar system that do not get their names from Greek or Roman mythology, so there is no need to\n\nmention them further. In addition to the planets, the heavens also contain thousands of stars; These are “fixed stars” since, unlike the planets, they do not change position with respect to one another. They form patterns that do not change, night after night and year after year.\n\nTHE OLYMPIANS\n\n45\n\nShepherds and farmers, in prehistoric days, studied these patterns because they served as a calendar. The sun\n\nmoves against the background of the\n\nstars\n\nand\n\ndifferent\n\nstars are visible at night at different times of the year.\n\nThe\n\nway\n\nwas to divide the stars into convenient groups which are nowadays called “constellations” (from Latin words meaning “with stars”). Then one could say that when one constellation rose in the east at sunset, it was harvest; the rising of another at sunset would indicate planting time and so on. The most important constellations in this connection would be those through which the sun actually passed on its path across the sky. There are twelve of these. The reason for the twelve is that the phases of the moon were also used to keep time. The moon went through its phases easiest\n\nto handle the situation\n\ntwelve times while the sun traveled through the constellations once. In other words, there are twelve months to the year and the sun spent one month in each of twelve constellations.\n\nThe er\n\nis\n\nway\n\nof telling one constellation from anothto notice the pattern of stars in each one.

In fact the circle of twelve constellations through\n\nso\n\nwhich the sun passes\n\nmany imaginary animals\n\nthat\n\nit\n\nin its travels contains is\n\ncalled the “zodiac”\n\nfrom Greek words meaning “circle of animals.” The Greeks inherited most of these constellationpictures from the Babylonians. What they then did was either to change the pictures to fit their own myths, or else invent myths to explain the pictures. For instance, there is a constellation in the zodiac that is now known by its Latin name of Capricornus (kap-ri kor'nus) from Latin words meaning “homed goat.” The Greeks stated that this goat was actually Amaltheia which was placed in the skies by Zeus out of gratitude for\n\n46\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\nthe nourishment she gave\n\nhim\n\nas\n\nan infant. If geography as\n\nthis is so,\n\nthen Amaltheia leaves her traces in well. On December 21, the sun is as far south as it ever gets. It is then shining directly down on a line that passes through northern Argentina, southern Africa and central Australia. That line is called the “Tropic of Capricorn” because at that time of year the sun, in its travels, is in the constellation of Capricornus. The constellations of the zodiac are traditionally numbered from the one in which (in Greek times) the sun is at the time of the spring equinox. By that count, Capricornus is the tenth “sign of the Zodiac.” Still another trace of Amaltheia exists in the language. Zeus took one of her horns and gave it the power of being forever filled with food and drink. This is the “horn of plenty” which is more often known by the Latin version of that phrase, the “cornucopia.” The brighter stars of Capricorn (none of which are very bright) are shaped something like a cornucopia. That may be what gave the Greeks the notion in the first place of saying that it represented Amaltheia. Another constellation connected with Zeus involves the nymph, Callisto, whom I have already mentioned. When she was in the shape of a bear, her son, Areas, came upon her. Not knowing she was his mother, he raised his spear to kill her. Zeus, to prevent this, changed him into a bear also and then placed both in the heavens. Callisto is now the constellation of Ursa Major, or “the Great Bear,” while Areas is Ursa Minor or the “Little Bear.” The North Star is one of the stars in the constellation Ursa Minor. The Greeks knew that if one traveled northward, the North Star rose higher and higher in the skies. With it rose the two constellations of the bears. The Greek word for “bear” is “arktos” so they called the northern regions “arktikos.” We therefore speak of the area around the North Pole as the “arctic zone,” and have it bounded by an imaginary line called the “arctic circle.” The body of water in the arctic zone, which is frozen over with ice, is, of course, the “Arctic Ocean.” Around the South Pole is the “antarctic zone” bounded\n\nTHE OLYMPIANS\n\n47\n\nby the “antarctic circle.” The prefix “ant-” means “opposite” and the antarctic is, indeed, on the opposite side of the earth from the arctic. The frozen continent within the antarctic zone is “Antarctica,” and the water about it is the “Antarctic Ocean.” There is still another trace of the Callisto myth in the sky. There is a bright star near the two bear constellations which seems forever to be watching them (sent by Hera, perhaps). This star is called “Arcturus” from Greek words meaning “to guard the bears.” On occasion, Zeus honored the animals into which he himself turned. For instance, the bull into which he turned himself to kidnap Europa was placed in the sky as “Taurus,” the Latin word for “the bull.” This is the second sign of the zodiac.\n\nOf\n\npurely practical.\n\nand\n\nmeaning of the bull might be The sun enters Taurus in early spring\n\ncourse, the original\n\nmay be\n\ntaken to symbolize the time of plowing. In ancient days, oxen and bullocks were used for plowing, this\n\nso you see the connection. It may also be that the eagle, in the form of which Zeus carried off Ganymede, is honored as the constellation “Aquila” (ak'wi-luh), which is Latin for “eagle.” It might seem to you that the individual stars in these constellations might also be used to memorialize myths. Actually, most of them do not. Most stars carry Arabic names given them in the Middle Ages. Those which, like Arcturus, have names dating back to Greek and Roman times, are in the minority.\n\nCronus and Rhea had three daughters as well as three sons. Of these, I have mentioned Hera, who was Zeus’s wife as well as his sister. She was the goddess of marriage, childbirth and women’s affairs generally. The other two were Demeter (de-mee'-ter), the goddess of agriculture, and Hestia (hes'-tee-uh), the goddess of the fireplace; that is, of the home. The daughters of Cronus are not as famous in myth as are the sons. Hera is important mainly as the wife of Zeus and Hestia is hardly ever mentioned. Demeter, as the goddess of agriculture,\n\nis\n\ninvolved with the older religions\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n48\n\nof the days before the Greeks came.\n\nOne famous myth\n\nabout her remained familiar. Demeter had a daughter, Persephone (per-sef'-o-nee), who, while playing in the fields of Sicily, was carried off by Hades, who had fallen in love with her. Demeter searched for her without success for a long time and in her sorrow refused to let the ground bear grain. Mankind was faced with starvation. Zeus then persuaded Hades to let Persephone return provided she had eaten none of the food in the underground kingdom. At the last moment, though, Hades tricked Persephone into eating four pomegranate seeds. As a result, Demeter had to allow Persephone to remain underground with Hades four months of every year, one for each seed.\n\nWhile Persephone was underground, the earth bore no grain, the trees lost their leaves and even the sun scarcely shone. Only with Persephone’s return, did the goddess of agriculture allow the earth to return to\n\nThis myth each year.\n\nis\n\nintended to explain\n\nlife.\n\nwhy\n\nwinter comes\n\nDemeter was especially worshiped at a district near Athens called Eleusis (e-lyoo'sis). The myth explained it by saying that Demeter had passed through Eleusis while looking for Persephone and had been kindly treated there so that she taught them certain rites in exchange. Actually, though, the ceremonies probably existed before the Greeks invaded the land. The Eleusinian ceremonies were not like the ordinary Olympian ones. The Olympian rites were celebrated openly and anyone who liked could join in. The Eleusinian ceremonies were secret and no one could join until he had been specially initiated Furthermore, one who was initiated had to swear never to reveal the rites (and no one ever did). Someone who had taken such an oath was called “mystes” from a Greek\n\nword meaning “close-mouthed.” As a\n\nresult,\n\nsuch secret\n\nwere called “mysteries.” There were a number of such “mystery religions” in ancient Greece, but of them all, the Eleusinian mysteries were the most famous. Of course, the word “mystery” gradually weakened and came to mean anything that was secret or hidden. The rites\n\nTHE OLYMPIANS most\n\ncommon\n\n49\n\nnowadays, is for a book about a puzzling crime to which someone must find an ingeniously hidden solution. use,\n\nThe Romans\n\nidentified three of their\n\nown\n\ngoddesses with the three daughters of Cronus and in every case it is the Roman name that is more familiar to us today. With Hera, the Romans identified Juno, the wife of their Jupiter. With Demeter, they identified their goddess of agriculture, Ceres (see'reez). And with Hestia, they identified their goddess of the fireplace, Vesta. (In addition, their version of the name Persephone is Proserpine (pros'urpine) and that, too, is the more familiar version now.) Some of the traces these goddesses have left are very familiar indeed. The sixth month was sacred to Juno and it is called “June” to this day. Juno (Hera) is the goddess of marriage and June is still considered the traditional month for marriage. Many girls dream of being not just a bride but a “June bride.” Ceres (Demeter) is the goddess of agriculture and particularly of grains, such as wheat, com, rice, barley and oats. These are the most important foods in a farming society and they are called “cereals” after Ceres. Vesta’s trace is a little old-fashioned now. She was the goddess of the fireplace and when matches were first invented they seemed miniature fireplaces so, for a while, they were called “vestas.” None of these daughters of Cronus were honored among the planets known to the ancient Greeks. An opportunity to correct the situation arose in 1801, however, when a Sicilian astronomer, Giuseppi Piazzi, discovered a small planet which followed an orbit between Mars and Jupiter. It was far smaller than any planet previously known, being only 485 miles in diameter. Ceres had always been particularly connected with Sic-\n\nwhich was an important grain-growing area in Greek and Roman times. It was from Sicily that Persephone was carried away.

Actually, Ceres proved to be only the first of a large number of tiny objects located between Jupiter and Mars. These are known as “asteroids” or “planetoids” or “minor planets.” In 1802, a second planetoid was found; in 1804, a third; and in 1807, a fourth. No more were found for nearly forty years and then better telescopes and, eventually, the use of photography resulted in the discovery of thousands. The use of the name Ceres originated the custom of naming all the planetoids (with certain exceptions I’ll mention later) after goddesses. This gave astronomers a chance to honor all sorts of minor goddesses and nymphs. Among the first to be honored were the daughters of Cronus. The name of Ceres was given to the first planetoid, as I’ve said. The third to be discovered was named “Juno” and the fourth was named “Vesta.” Although Vesta is not the largest planetoid (Ceres is), it is the brightest. It is the only planetoid that can sometimes, just barely, be made out with the naked eye, so it is well named after the goddess of the fireplace. As for Proserpina, her name is that of the twenty-sixth\n\nplanetoid to be discovered.\n\n4\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF ZEUS\n\nthe GREEK myths,\n\nthere were no further dethronements after Zeus established his power. The various Olympians had children but none rose in successful revolt. Instead they were peacefully allowed to enter the Olympian family and become gods and goddesses on an equal footing with the rest (although all remained under the rule\n\nin\n\nof Zeus).\n\nProbably the various children of the Olympians were originally local gods and goddesses of various native tribes who entered into alliance with the invading Greeks. Indeed several gods or goddesses may have been combined under one name. For that reason, different stories that do not fit together may be told about a particular god or goddess.\n\nFor\n\ninstance, there are\n\ntwo\n\nentirely separate\n\nstories\n\nabout the birth of the goddess Aphrodite (a-fro-die'-tee). In one version, she is supposed to have been the daughter of Uranus and Gaea. She rose from the sea foam on a scallop shell, a sister of the Titans and far older than the Olympians.\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n52\n\nThis is probably a myth about a goddess worshiped by the people who preceded the Greeks. When the Greeks arrived, they adopted Aphrodite into the Olympian family by making her the daughter of Zeus and of the Titaness Dione. Regardless of her origin, the Greeks considered Aphro-\n\nmost beautiful of the goddesses. She was the goddess of beauty and love. The Romans identified their own goddess of beauty, Venus, with Aphrodite, and Venus is more familiar to us. Under either name, the goddess is the prototype of beauty; that is, the original model to which everything since then must be compared. That is why when we wish to pay a high compliment to the good looks of some girl, we may call her a Venus. The Romans paid such honor to Venus that “venerate” has come to mean to honor and respect. Then, since age is respected, or should be, old dite the\n\nmen\n\nare said to be “venerable.”\n\nVenus (or Aphrodite) wore a girdle or belt, called the “cestus,” which was supposed to increase her attractions and make her irresistible. A beautiful and charming\n\nwoman\n\nis\n\nsometimes said to wear “Aphrodite’s girdle.”\n\nZoologists spoil the poetry of that by giving the\n\nname\n\n“Venus-girdle” or “cestus” to certain fiatworms living in the sea that are about a foot long and shaped just like a belt.\n\nVenus\n\nis\n\nthe one goddess\n\nwhose name was given\n\nto an\n\nimportant planet. This is the planet commonly called the “evening star” or the “morning star” (depending on which side of the sun it happens to be). It is the brightest and most beautiful object in the heavens next to the sun and moon, and is far brighter than any star. Originally the Greeks thought they were two different\n\nPhosphorus (“lightbringer” in Greek) because once it appeared in the eastern skies, the light of dawn would soon come. The evening star was called Hesperus (“west” in Greek) because it planets.\n\nThey\n\ncalled the\n\nmorning\n\nstar\n\nalways shone in the western sky after sunset. Once the Greeks learned that Phosphorus and Hesperus were really the same planet, they named it Aphrodite as\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF ZEUS befitted its beauty.\n\nThe Romans\n\ncalled\n\nit\n\n53\n\nVenus and so do\n\nwe.\n\nAnother daughter of Zeus by a Titaness is Athena. The myth has Zeus swallowing Metis, a Titaness who was considered his first wife. He married Hera only afterward. Metis had a daughter within Zeus, and Zeus discovered this only after he found him self suffering from a bad headache. It was so bad that he had to have his head split open and when this was done, out sprang the goddess Athena (a-thee'nuh), full grown and fully armed. This seems like a rather silly myth, but “metis” is the Greek word for “wisdom” and Athena was considered the goddess of knowledge and of the arts of both war and peace. The myth is therefore a way of saying that after Zeus came to power he absorbed wisdom, and out of the thoughts in his head arose the knowledge out of which the arts developed.\n\nAthena\n\nwas considered the goddess in particular charge of a Greek city which was named “Athenai” in her honor. In English, this city\n\nknown\n\nas “Athens.”\n\nAt\n\nthe peak of Greek civilization, Athens was the most powerful, richest and civilized of all the Greek cities. No city has is\n\nbeen as greatly admired by as\n\nmany\n\npeople as has Athens. It is still the capital of modern Greece. Because of the reputation of Athens as a chief center of civilization, cities that consider themselves to be a center of learning still call themselves after that Greek city. Boston considers itself the “Athens of America” for instance.\n\nOne\n\nof the alternate names (pal'us). One of the stories as to •\n\nof\n\nhow\n\nAthena she\n\nis\n\ncame\n\nPallas to have\n\nname was that at one time Athena killed a giant named Pallas and adopted his name. Probably what really happened is that a tribe worshiping a goddess named this\n\nPallas joined the\n\nAthena.\n\nAnyway,\n\nGreeks and Pallas was in\n\npoetry,\n\nidentified with\n\nAthena was\n\nfrequently\n\nreferred to as “Pallas Athena.” In the list of the planetoids, the second one discovered (in 1802) was named Pallas. With a diameter of 304 miles, it is the second largest of the asteroids. (The ninth\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n54\n\nasteroid discovered\n\n—\n\nin\n\n1848\n\n—was named Metis\n\nafter the\n\nmother of Athena.) Pallas entered the table of elements almost at once. In 1803, the English chemist, William Hyde Wollaston, dis-\n\ncovered a\n\nnew\n\nafter the first\n\nelement. Klaproth had just named cerium planetoid, Ceres, and Wollaston followed\n\nnew element “palladium” after Pallas. Palladium has a second meaning, too. The city of Troy\n\nsuit\n\nby naming\n\nhis\n\nabout later in the book) had a statue of Pallas Athena which was called a “palladium.” There was a tradition that Troy could not be taken as long as the palladium was inside the city. (They eventually lost the statue and Troy fell.) Nowadays, any object or tradition which is supposed to guard a nation or some cherished way of life is called a “palladium.” The American constitution, for instance, can be considered the palladium of our\n\n(which I\n\nwill talk\n\nliberties.\n\nSome people\n\nmodem\n\ntimes have thought, from the sound of the word, that a palladium was an ancient circus or theater, like the Colosseum. It sometimes happens, therefore, that a movie house may be given the name. Athena is associated with the name of an actual building, though; perhaps the most beautiful building ever erected. Since Athena never married nor had any love affairs, the Greeks often called her “Athena Parthenos” (“Athena the Virgin”). When the Athenians built her a beautiful temple, completed in 437 b.c., they called it the “Parthenon.” Its ruins still stand to remind us of the most glorious days of Greece. The Romans identified their own goddess of practical arts, Minerva (from a Latin word meaning “mind”), with Athena. However, probably because of the fame of the city of Athens, this was one case in which the Greek name in\n\nremained more familiar in\n\nmodem times.\n\nof the sons of Zeus was Hermes (her'meez). His mother was Maia, one of the daughters of Atlas. In particular she was one of seven daughters called the Pleiades (plee'uh-deez.) The Pleiades were at one time pursued by a giant hunter. To rescue them, the gods changed them into doves and then set them in the sides, where they are\n\nOne\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF ZEUS\n\n55\n\nseen as a small and pretty cluster of stars in the constellation of Taurus. One of those stars still has the name “Maia.” Another is “Atlas,” after the father of the Pleiades. Although there are seven Pleiades, most people can only see six. The seventh, say the Greeks, dimmed her light in shame and grief because she fell in love with a mortal man instead of with a god. She is referred to as the “lost Pleiad.” Actually, the Pleiades are a group of stars that are far more than seven in number. only see the very brightest with the naked eye. field glass shows dozens and a telescope will show hundreds. Despite that, any group of exactly seven famous people is called a “Pleiad.”\n\nWe\n\nA\n\nThere\n\nRoman\n\ngoddess called Maia also. She had nothing to do with the Greek Maia, but there is often confusion between the two. The most important thing about the\n\nis\n\na\n\nRoman Maia\n\nis\n\nthat the\n\nmonth\n\nof\n\n“May”\n\nis\n\nnamed\n\nafter her.\n\nAs\n\nHermes, the son of the Greek Maia, he was considered the messenger of the gods and so was naturally for\n\nimagined as very swift. He is usually pictured with wings on his sandals and on his cap. He was also the god of commerce, c unnin g and invention. In later years, the Greeks adopted an Egyptian god of learning and identified him with Hermes. They called the combination “Hermes Trismegistus” (“Hermes the thricegreat”). Hermes Trismegistus was considered the god of chemical knowledge in particular, for the Egyptians had a great reputation as chemists in ancient days. (In fact, the very word “chemistry” may have come from an ancient name for Egypt.) As a result, an old-fashioned name for chemistry is the “hermetic art.” more familiar use of the term arises from the fact that chemists often pinched closed the glass neck of a vessel to keep the contents from exposure to air. Anything that is airtight is still said to be “hermetically sealed.” In ancient times, messages from one ruler to another or between armies were carried by “heralds.” These had to be treated with respect and could not be harmed. They car-\n\nA\n\nried a special staff as the sign of their office\n\ncalled a\n\nand\n\nthis\n\nwas\n\n“caduceus” (ka-doo'syoos). Since Hermes acted\n\nWORDS FROM THE MYTHS\n\n56\n\nwhen he carried messages, he carried such a Because Hermes moved so quickly, the staff, as well\n\nas a herald staff.\n\nas his cap and sandals, carried wings. Later, when he became Hermes Trismegistus, there was an addition to the staff. Chemistry is associated with medicine and therefore so was Hermes. (A mythical powder supposed to be capable of curing wounds when applied to them was called a “hermetic powder.”) in ancient times, doctors were associated with snakes. This may have\n\nNow\n\nbeen because snakes had the ability to shed their skins, and seemed, to the Greeks, to be renewing their youth when they did so. This youth-renewal was what they expected or hoped for from doctors. Because of this, the caduceus of Hermes (which may have been wreathed with olive branches to begin with) gained two snakes which coiled about it. The caduceus, complete with wings and snakes, has symbolized doctors and the profession of medicine ever since. It still forms the insignia of the United States Army Medical Corps. Now of all the planets in the sky, the one that moves most quickly against the background of the stars was naturally named after the swift-footed Hermes. The Romans identified their own god of commerce, Mercury, with Hermes, and so we know the planet as Mercury. Zeus had twin children of whom still another Titaness, Leto (lee'toe), was the mother. The Romans called her Latona (la-toe'nuh) and she is better known by that name. The jealous Hera refused to allow Leto rest on any land in order to have the children. However, Leto fled to Delos, the smallest island in the Aegean Sea. This was a floating island so it didn’t count as land. After the birth of the twins, Apollo (a-pol'-o) and Artemis (ar'te-mis), Delos was fixed to the sea bottom and floated no more. Because they were bom on Mount Cynthus on the island, the twins were occasionally called Cynthius and Cynthia Both are pictured as youthful archers. Apollo is the .\n\nmanly beauty, so that a very handsome man might be called an “Apollo.” He is also the god of poetry ideal of\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF ZEUS\n\n57\n\nand music. The Romans had no equivalent for Apollo and they adopted him under that name. Artemis is the goddess of the hunt. The Romans identified a forest goddess, Diana, with Artemis, and it is as Diana that she is most familiar to us.\n\nNow the mother of Leto was\n\nthe Titaness Phoebe (who was honored as the eighth satellite of Saturn). Phoebe, whose name in Greek means “the shining one,” was probably a goddess of either the moon or the sun in the days before the Greeks. The Greeks forced this into their own system of myths by making Apollo and Artemis the grandchildren of Phoebe and letting them rule the sun and\n\nmoon. Apollo was considered the god of the sun and even took aver a masculine version of Phoebe’s name. He was frequently called “Phoebus Apollo” or just “Phoebus” (fee'dus). Artemis (and, therefore, the Roman Diana as well) was the goddess of the moon. This is another example in which the Olymp"
