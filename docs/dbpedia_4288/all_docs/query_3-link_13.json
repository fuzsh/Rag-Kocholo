This was a\n\ntime considered critical in the evolutionary development of\n\nmulti-celled animals and therefore the most important interval for\n\nbiological evolution in general.\n\nIn a paper to be published in the May 25 edition of Nature, U of T\n\nphysics professor Richard Peltier and Texas A&M oceanographers William\n\nHyde, Thomas Crowley and Steven Baum note that the late Proterozoic era\n\n(600-800 million years ago) was the most important period of evolution\n\nfor multi-cellular creatures. However, this period was also a time in\n\nEarth's history that has come to be referred to as the Snowball Earth.\n\nAt that time, the planet was thought to be completely ice-covered.\n\nGeological and paleomagnetic evidence indicates that for alternating\n\nperiods, the Earth was completely covered by ice sheets over the\n\ncontinents and sea ice over the oceans, followed by sudden warming\n\ntrends that melted the ice.\n\n\"If the suface of the planet was covered by ice, the question arises as\n\nto how early life managed to survive under such environmental stress,\"\n\nsays Peltier. To find an answer, the scientists employed several\n\ndifferent models of the climate systems and ran detailed computer\n\nsimulations of the climate thought to have been characteristic of that\n\ntime. To simulate the Snowball Earth, they reduced the amount of\n\nsunlight reaching the Earth -- to account for the fact that the sun was\n\nabout six per cent less luminous than it is now -- and varied the\n\nconcentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide within the range expected\n\nfor that time.\n\nIn most of the simulations, their analysis revealed the presence of a\n\nbelt of open water near the equator when the general circulation of the\n\nocean was taken into account. \"It is this open water that may have\n\nprovided a refuge for multi-celled animals when the rest of the Earth\n\nwas covered by ice and snow,\" Peltier explains.\n\nThe findings of this research are critical to understanding how early\n\nlife evolved, he states. \"This could help clarify how multi-celled\n\nanimals managed not only stay alive, but to thrive given the Earth's\n\nharsh conditions. The extreme climates may even have exerted pressure\n\non these animals to evolve and adapt, possibly leading to the rapid\n\ndevelopment of new forms of animals and their movement into new,\n\nunpopulated habitats when the Earth exited the snowball state. It was\n\nduring the warm Cambrian era -- immediately following the late\n\nProterozoic -- in which life proliferated.\"\n\nThe late Proterozoic period was also a time when the supercontinents\n\nRodinia and Pannotia formed and subsequently rifted and disassembled.\n\nLocated over the south rotational pole in the position of present-day\n\nAntarctica, these supercontinents were made up of the current land\n\nmasses of Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia, Greenland,\n\nLaurentia and parts of Asia. According to Peltier, the entry of the\n\nEarth into the snowball state required not only the weak sun and\n\natmospheric carbon dioxide levels not significantly higher than\n\npresent-day, but also this high degree of polar continentality.\n\nFunding for this research came from the Natural Sciences and\n\nEngineering Research Council of Canada and the National Science\n\nFoundation in the U.S.\n\n[Janet Wong is a news services officer with the Department of Public\n\nAffairs.]\n\n===============\n\n(2) THERSITES: A JUMPING TROJAN?\n\nK.

ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS, 2000, Vol.354, No.3, pp.1091-1100\n\n*) UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI,DEPT PHYS,SECT ASTROPHYS ASTRON &\n\nIn this paper, we examine the dynamical evolution of the asteroid\n\n(1868) Thersites(1), a member of the Trojan belt. Thersites is\n\nlibrating around the Lagrangian point L-4, following, however, a\n\nchaotic orbit. The equations of motion for Thersites as well as for a\n\ndistribution of neighboring initial conditions are integrated\n\nnumerically for 50 million years in the Outer Solar System model (OSS),\n\nwhich consists of the Sun and the four giant planets. Our results\n\nindicate that the probability that this asteroid will eventually escape\n\nfrom the Trojan swarm is rather high. In fact, 20% from our initial\n\ndistribution escaped within the integration time. Many of the remaining\n\nones also show characteristic 'jumps' in the orbital elements,\n\nespecially the inclination. Secular resonances involving the nodes of\n\nthe outer planets are found to be responsible for this chaotic\n\nbehavior. The width of libration and eccentricity values that lead to\n\ngrossly unstable orbits are calculated and compared with previously\n\nknown results on the stability of the Trojans. Finally, a very\n\ninteresting behavior has been observed for one of the escaping\n\nasteroids as he 'jumped' from L-4 to L-5 where he remained performing a\n\nhighly inclined libration for similar to 2 Myrs before escaping from\n\nthe Trojan swarm.

ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL, 2000, Vol.119, No.4,\n\npp.1978-1984\n\n*) YORK UNIVERSITY,DEPT PHYS & ASTRON,N YORK,ON M3J 1P3,CANADA\n\nQuasi satellites are bodies in a particular configuration of a 1:1 mean\n\nmotion resonance, one in which they librate about the longitude of\n\ntheir associated planet. We investigate numerically the stability of\n\nsuch orbits around the giant planets of our solar system. We find that\n\ntest particles can remain on quasi-satellite orbits around Uranus and\n\nNeptune for times up to 10(9) yr in some cases, though only at low\n\ninclinations relative to their accompanying planet and over a\n\nrestricted range of heliocentric eccentricities. These stable areas are\n\nwell outside the traditional satellite region. Based on these results,\n\nwe conclude that a primordial population of such objects may still\n\nexist in our solar system.

The most\n\nprimitive (least altered) meteorites contain a few parts per million of\n\nmicrometre-sized dust which formed in the atmospheres of giant\n\nstars(1). Some meteorites(2) have elevated D/H and N-15/N-14 ratios\n\nthat are attributed to surviving interstellar organic molecules which\n\nhave probably been strongly diluted and altered by parent-body\n\nprocesses(2). Most IDPs are chemically, mineralogically, and texturally\n\nprimitive in comparison to meteorites(3,4). Here I show that H and N\n\nisotopic anomalies among fragile 'cluster' IDPs are far larger, more\n\ncommon, and less equilibrated than those previously observed in other\n\nIDPs or meteorites. In some cases, the D/H ratios that we measure reach\n\nthe values of interstellar molecules, suggesting that molecular-cloud\n\nmaterial has survived intact. These observations indicate that cluster\n\nIDPs are the most primitive class of Solar System materials currently\n\navailable for laboratory analysis.

Lecar: On the transport of bodies within and from\n\nthe asteroid belt. METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE, 2000, Vol.35, No.2,\n\npp.331-340\n\n*) HARVARD SMITHSONIAN CTR ASTROPHYS,60 GARDEN ST,CAMBRIDGE,MA,02138\n\nThis paper explores two processes, sweeping secular resonance (Ward,\n\n1981) and gas drag (Lecar and Franklin, 1997), at work during the\n\ndispersal of the solar nebula. We have two aims not previously\n\nconsidered for the two mechanisms: (1) to explain the likely depletion,\n\nby a factor of 1000 or so, of the rocky material in the inner belt (2.0\n\n< a < 3.2 AU); (2) to introduce a means for providing-or contributing\n\nto-the dispersion in semimajor axis of the various asteroidal taxonomic\n\nclasses. We suggest that large asteroids with birthplaces separated by\n\nan astronomical unit or more can be finally deposited, owing to drag,\n\nat the same semimajor axis. For example, we find that bodies with radii\n\nup to 100 km can be transferred by gas drag from the outer belt (a >\n\n3.3 AU) well into the inner one, and that an object already in the\n\ninner belt as large or even larger than Vesta (r = 250 km)-thought to\n\nbe the parent body of many meteorites-can be inwardly displaced by as\n\nmuch as an astronomical unit if the nebula dispersal times lie close to\n\n10(5) years. For such times, a large fraction of the inner belt's\n\nprimordial mass can be ejected, with most of it passing into the inner\n\nsolar system.

The Jupiter family\n\ncomet P/Gehrels 3 moves on a particular orbit, with a very high\n\nTisserand invariant with respect to Jupiter, that makes the encounters\n\nwith the planet very effective. This implies that the comet spends part\n\nof its life as a temporary satellite of Jupiter, on an orbit that shows\n\nsimilarity with those of Trojans. This comet has been observed when it\n\nwas far from the Sun, with the aim to acquire data on the nucleus\n\nstatus. In order to study from a theoretical point of view the possible\n\nstatus and evolution of a body on this orbit we have developed\n\ndifferent nucleus models using a numerical code for the thermal\n\nevolution of the nucleus.

As\n\nTony Reichhardt points out in Nature today, this instrument is widely\n\napplicable to all sorts of surveys (it has a 3 degree field)\n\nincluding earth crossers down to 300 metres. An analysis of various\n\nreal and potential survey instruments by Alain Maury\n\n(http://wwwrc.obs-azur.fr/schmidt/general/NEOsurvey.html) seems to\n\nrate LSST (then known as DMT) far higher than any other project.\n\nWhile originally conceived as a way of looking for dark matter effects\n\n(hence the original name dark matter telescope) LSST's interests have\n\nbeen broadened recently (concievably as a way of broadening its\n\nsupporting constituency) to include, among a couple of other things,\n\nNEO searches. Given this, if built it will presumably have to serve\n\nthese new constituents (the website points to support from Carolyn\n\nShoemaker). I suppose its possible that all this looks good on paper\n\nbut that those in the know know that, in practice, this is not great\n\nnews for NEO watchers. If so let them speak up. At first blush it looks\n\npretty good.\n\nYou could argue -- I might argue -- that LSST should be higher up the\n\nlist, above the new X ray telescopes and the expansion to the VLA. But\n\nlists like this have to balance the interests of the different\n\nspectrum-communities. The fact that this survey instrument, with\n\ngreat potential use for NEO searches, is the second most highly rated\n\noptical project seems a pretty high endorsement to me.\n\nMore at http://www.dmtelescope.org/\n\nbest, o\n\n---------------\n\nMODERATOR'S NOTE: I share Olivers hope that one of the telescopes\n\nmentioned on the $3.7 billion U.S. wish-list might, sometime in the\n\nfuture, be also used for NEO searches. But that's not the point. What I\n\n(and others) have criticised is the assertion by some that additional\n\ntelescopes are actually unnecessary to achieve the current Spaceguard\n\ngoals. As was pointed out on CCNet (14 March 2000), the U.S. Congress\n\nand NASA have adopted the goal of the Spaceguard Survey (i.e. finding\n\n90% of NEAs larger than 1 km diameter in the next 10 years). It follows\n\nthat if \"a modest extension\" of the current search programmes can\n\nactually meet this goal, there is no reason why tight-fisted funding\n\nagencies (not just those in the U.S.) should contribute to *additional*\n\nsearch programmes that would appear entirely superfluous in this light.\n\nIn the past, many observers have lamented that the number of\n\nprofessional NEO searchers around the world are \"less than the staff at\n\na typical McDonalds\". As far as the Spaceguard goals are concerned, it\n\nwould appear that this is all it takes to manage the impact hazard. Or\n\nis it?\n\n=============\n\n(12) GLOBAL URANIUM SUPPLY\n\nFrom Steve Zoraster <szoraster@zycor.lgc.com>\n\nRE: GLOBAL URANIUM SUPPLY\n\nFrom Joel Gunn <jdgunn@mindspring.com>\n\n> The summation of the program seemed to be that the world culture is\n\n> headed for an energy crisis >regardless of any disturbances caused\n\n> by global warming.

Well, nearly\n\nall fertilizer is made from petroleum products, and if most of us\n\nwill die of starvation long before the next major impact event, then\n\nmoney spent on Spaceguard may be irrelevant.\n\nBy the way, I count myself as an optimist on this particular issue.\n\nSteven Zoraster\n\n================\n\n(13) 50 YEARS AGO - WORLDS IN COLLISION\n\nFrom Michael Paine <mpaine@tpgi.com.au>\n\nDear Benny,\n\nThe June issue of Scientific American has the following in its historical\n\nsection from June 1950:\n\nCONSPIRACY OF THE CREDULOUS--\"Review: 'Worlds in Collision,' by Immanuel\n\nVelikovsky.

In the\n\nconventional view, civilization was thought to begin solely in the\n\nsouth and then move north through trade and colonization.\n\nIn an announcement of the new finds, Dr. McGuire Gibson, an\n\narchaeologist at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago,\n\nsaid, \"We need to reconsider our ideas about the beginnings of\n\ncivilization, pushing the time further back.\"\n\nOther archaeologists familiar with the research agreed in interviews\n\nlast week that the Tell Hamoukar excavations confirmed and should\n\nelaborate on a consensus that has emerged among scholars in the last\n\ndecade about the role of northern settlements in Syria and Iraq and in\n\nsoutheastern Turkey in the development of civilization. These\n\nsettlements exhibited many of the attributes of civilization --\n\nmonumental architecture, division of labor, social stratification --\n\napparently before they had any significant contact with people in the\n\nlower valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\n\n\"It's a very important excavation,\" said Dr. Gil J. Stein, an\n\narchaeologist at Northwestern University. \"It fits in really nicely\n\nwith a picture that's been emerging, based on several other excavation\n\nsites.\"\n\nEven Dr. Guillermo Algaze, an archaeologist at the University of\n\nCalifornia at San Diego, who had argued for a south-to-north\n\ntransplantation of early civilization, said that he now generally\n\nagreed with the new interpretation. \"I've been eating a lot of crow\n\nlately,\" he said.\n\nExcavations at Tell Hamoukar were started last summer by a joint\n\nexpedition of the Oriental Institute and the Syrian Directorate General\n\nof Antiquities. Work will resume next month and will probably continue\n\nfor many years. The site promises an abundance of artifacts,\n\narchaeologists said, not only because of its large size but also\n\nbecause most of the material seems to be close to the surface.\n\nDigging into the oldest layer of ruins uncovered so far, archaeologists\n\nfound traces of people living in villages at the site as early as 4000\n\nB.C.\n\nWithin 300 years, the settlement had grown into a prosperous town of at\n\nleast 32 acres with ample evidence of a well-organized society of the\n\nkind associated with the early stages of civilization.\n\nFULL STORY at\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/052300sci-archaeo-syria.html\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTHE CAMBRIDGE-CONFERENCE NETWORK (CCNet)\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe CCNet is a scholarly electronic network.
