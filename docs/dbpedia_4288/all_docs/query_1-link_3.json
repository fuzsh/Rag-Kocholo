        "text": "Thersites\n\nAsteroid 1868, Thersites, a Jupiter Trojan, was discovered on September 24, 1960, by C. J. van Houten and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld at Palomar Observatory near Pauma Valley, California. It has a period of 12 years, 78 days.\n\nThersites was named after a Greek warrior who wanted to stop the siege of Troy and go homeÂ—fittingly, it is believed by some, for this asteroid which was found farthest from the Trojan libration point. The warrior Thersites was also known for his carping criticism.\n\nThersites, astrologically, indicates to complain about, criticize, dissent or rail against.\n\nRosie O'Donnell, the so-called Queen of Nice, who has displayed a sharp tongue, a volatile temper and a tendency to be pugnacious on occasion, has Thersites sextile Hidalgo (assertion).\n\nRush Limbaugh has Thersites in the fifth house of entertainment, trine the East Point (as the world sees you), biquintile the Sun (to shine) and sesquiquadrate the Ascendant (personal interests).\n\nFellow talk-radio ranter Michael Savage (born March 31, 1942, in New York), who was fired for wishing AIDS upon a caller and uttering homophobic slurs, has Thersites quintile Juno (relations, the disenfranchised), quincunx the Sun and quindecile Venus (values, indignation).\n\nLaura Schlessinger, who sells harsh, even venomous or bigoted, words as nurturance, has Thersites conjunct the Sun, semisextile Ceres and quindecile Pluto (ugly, pathological, psychology).\n\nTori Spelling, reportedly a determinedly sweet and generous person who is one of Hollywood's most disparaged stars, has Thersites in the third house of the media, square Jupiter (prosperity).\n\nBill Clinton has Thersites in the third house, on the IC, square the Ascendant and quindecile the North Node (giving out, connections, transcending).\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton has Thersites semisquare Juno (marriage), square Chiron (the door-opener, the maverick) and opposite Mars (testosterone-laden) and Pluto.\n\nMadalyn Murray O'Hair, who in life both railed and protested against the influence of organized religion and was railed against by its supporters, had Thersites in the third house of the media and public speaking, opposite Ceres (nurturance).\n\nGloria Steinem, who has endeavored to encourage women to insist on equal treatment with men as fellow human beings, has Thersites in the second house, square Pallas (fighting for one's beliefs, ideals and values of civilization).\n\nRalph Nader, who has devoted his life to protecting the consumer against the avaricious amorality and negligence of manufacturers, landed in the doghouse with many Democrats after his failed 2000 presidential candidacy was blamed for contributing to the defeat of Al Gore. He has Thersites in the second house, quintile the Sun and trine Ceres.\n\nThe glyph for Thersites is mine and is intended to suggest a soapbox orator or public protester."
