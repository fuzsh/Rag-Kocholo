        "text": "Mesopause Jumps: Observations and Explanation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuebken, F. J.; Becker, E.; HÃ¶ffner, J.; Viehl, T. P.; Latteck, R.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nRecent high resolution temperature measurements by resonance lidar at Davis (69Â°S) occasionally showed a sudden mesopause altitude increase by 5km and an associated mesopause temperature decrease by 10K. We present further observations which are closely related to this `mesopause jump', namely the increase of mean height of polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) observed by a VHF radar, very strong westward winds in the upper mesosphere measured by an MF radar, and relatively large eastward winds in the stratosphere taken from reanalysis. We compare to similar observations in the Northern Hemisphere, namely at ALOMAR (69Â°N) where such mesopause jumps have never been observed. We present a detailed explanation of mesopause jumps. They occur only when stratospheric winds are moderately eastward and mesospheric winds are very large (westward). Under these conditions, gravity waves with comparatively large eastward phase speeds can pass the stratosphere and propagate to the lower thermosphere because their vertical wavelengths in the mesosphere are rather large which implies reduced dynamical stability. When finally breaking in the lower thermosphere, these waves drive an enhanced residual circulation that causes a cold and high-altitude mesopause. The conditions for a mesopause jump occur only in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and are associated with the late breakdown of the polar vortex.Mesopause jumps are primarily, but not only, observed prior and close to solstice. We also show that during the onset of PMSE in the SH, stratospheric zonal winds are still eastward (up to 30m/s), and that the onset is not closely related to the transition of the stratospheric circulation.\n\nRelationships Between Countermovement Jump Ground Reaction Forces and Jump Height, Reactive Strength Index, and Jump Time.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarker, Leland A; Harry, John R; Mercer, John A\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBarker, LA, Harry, JR, and Mercer, JA. Relationships between countermovement jump ground reaction forces and jump height, reactive strength index, and jump time. J Strength Cond Res 32(1): 248-254, 2018-The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between ground reaction force (GRF) variables to jump height, jump time, and the reactive strength index (RSI). Twenty-six, Division-I, male, soccer players performed 3 maximum effort countermovement jumps (CMJs) on a dual-force platform system that measured 3-dimensional kinetic data. The trial producing peak jump height was used for analysis. Vertical GRF (Fz) variables were divided into unloading, eccentric, amortization, and concentric phases and correlated with jump height, RSI (RSI = jump height/jump time), and jump time (from start to takeoff). Significant correlations were observed between jump height and RSI, concentric kinetic energy, peak power, concentric work, and concentric displacement. Significant correlations were observed between RSI and jump time, peak power, unload Fz, eccentric work, eccentric rate of force development (RFD), amortization Fz, amortization time, second Fz peak, average concentric Fz, and concentric displacement. Significant correlations were observed between jump time and unload Fz, eccentric work, eccentric RFD, amortization Fz, amortization time, average concentric Fz, and concentric work. In conclusion, jump height correlated with variables derived from the concentric phase only (work, power, and displacement), whereas Fz variables from the unloading, eccentric, amortization, and concentric phases correlated highly with RSI and jump time. These observations demonstrate the importance of countermovement Fz characteristics for time-sensitive CMJ performance measures. Researchers and practitioners should include RSI and jump time with jump height to improve their assessment of jump performance.\n\nObservation of quantum jumps in a superconducting quantum bit\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVijay, R.\n\n2011-03-01\n\nSuperconducting qubit technology has made great advances since the first demonstration of coherent oscillations more than 10 years ago. Coherence times have improved by several orders of magnitude and significant progress has been made in qubit state readout fidelity. However, a fast, high-fidelity, quantum non-demolition measurement scheme which is essential to implement quantum error correction has so far been missing. We demonstrate such a scheme for the first time where we continuously measure the state of a superconducting quantum bit using a fast, ultralow-noise parametric amplifier. This arrangement allows us to observe quantum jumps between the qubit states in real time. The key development enabling this experiment is the use of a low quality factor (Q), nonlinear resonator to implement a phase-sensitive parametric amplifier operating near the quantum limit. The nonlinear resonator was constructed using a two junction SQUID shunted with an on-chip capacitor. The SQUID allowed us to tune the operating band of the amplifier and the low Q provided us with a bandwidth greater than 10 MHz, sufficient to observe jumps in the qubit state in real time. I will briefly describe the operation of the parametric amplifier and discuss how it was used to measure the state of a transmon qubit in the circuit QED architecture. I will discuss measurement fidelity and the statistics of the quantum jumps. I will conclude by discussing the implications of this development for quantum information processing and further improvements to the measurement technique.

Thus, pressure-jump (P-jump)-induced protein refolding, if it could be made fast enough, would be ideally suited for comparison with MD. Although pressure denaturation perturbs secondary structure less than temperature denaturation, protein refolding after a fast P-jump is not necessarily faster than that after a temperature jump. Recent P-jump refolding experiments on the helix bundle Î»-repressor have shown evidence of a <3 Î¼s burst phase, but also of a â¼1.5 ms âslowâ phase of refolding, attributed to non-native helical structure frustrating microsecond refolding. Here we show that a Î»-repressor mutant is nonetheless capable of refolding in a single explicit solvent MD trajectory in about 19 Î¼s, indicating that the burst phase observed in experiments on the same mutant could produce native protein. The simulation reveals that after about 18.5 Î¼s of conformational sampling, the productive structural rearrangement to the native state does not occur in a single swift step but is spread out over a brief series of helix and loop rearrangements that take about 0.9 Î¼s. Our results support the molecular time scale inferred for Î»-repressor from near-downhill folding experiments, where transition-state population can be seen experimentally, and also agrees with the transition-state transit time observed in slower folding proteins by single-molecule spectroscopy.

As relatively 'young' activities, the investigation of injuries and deaths related in extreme sports such as bungee jumping and BASE jumping is relatively sparse. Studies evaluating risk in civilian and military skydiving activities have been reported over the past decades, but technique and equipment has changed. Risk with bungee jumping is only sporadically reported in the literature, most often in connection with eye injuries, but also rare events of serious, life-threatening injuries and even death. BASE is an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span, Earth, which represents the fixed objects from which jumps are made. Estimated risk in BASE jumping for any injury (independent of severity grade) is 0.4-0.5%, which as 5- to 8-fold higher than skydiving. Typically, men outnumber women in a ratio of 10:1 in both injuries and case fatality rates. Age is frequently reported to range from 30 to 40 years. Notably, differences in training and environmental locations exist between recreational skydiving and BASE jumping. As BASE jumps are made from lower altitudes than skydives, jumpers generally fall at lower speeds, have far less aerodynamic control, and may lose flying stability. Yet, typical injuries include a bruised or sprained ankle during landing. Protective gear including helmet and pads may help to prevent such injuries, while more complex knowledge of human factors, environment and training are needed to prevent fatal injuries.

Several types of equipment are available for this purpose. To compare the error of measurement of 2 jump-mat systems (Chronojump-Boscosystem and Globus Ergo Tester) with that of a motion-capture system as a criterion and to determine the modifying effect of foot length on jump height. Thirty-one young adult men alternated 4 countermovement jumps with 4 squat jumps. Mean jump height and standard deviations representing technical error of measurement arising from each device and variability arising from the subjects themselves were estimated with a novel mixed model and evaluated via standardization and magnitude-based inference. The jump-mat systems produced nearly identical measures of jump height (differences in means and in technical errors of measurement â¤1 mm). Countermovement and squat-jump height were both 13.6 cm higher with motion capture (90% confidence limits Â±0.3 cm), but this very large difference was reduced to small unclear differences when adjusted to a foot length of zero. Variability in countermovement and squat-jump height arising from the subjects was small (1.1 and 1.5 cm, respectively, 90% confidence limits Â±0.3 cm); technical error of motion capture was similar in magnitude (1.7 and 1.6 cm, Â±0.3 and Â±0.4 cm), and that of the jump mats was similar or smaller (1.2 and 0.3 cm, Â±0.5 and Â±0.9 cm). The jump-mat systems provide trustworthy measurements for monitoring changes in jump height. Foot length can explain the substantially higher jump height observed with motion capture.\n\nSaw-tooth pattern from flux jumps observed by high resolution M-H curves in MgB2 thin films\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Jae-Yeap; Lee, Hu-Jong; Jung, Myung-Hwa; Lee, Sung-Ik; Choi, Eun-Mi; Kang, W. N.\n\n2010-08-01\n\nWhile flux jumps have been observed in the magnetic hysteresis loops of superconductors, a saw-tooth pattern of the flux jump is known to appear only in a bulk superconductor. But in this study, we were able to observe the saw-tooth pattern in MgB2 thin film with the careful data acquisition method enhancing the data taking capability and report the details of the distribution of the field interval between jumps Bfj, and the size of the flux jump, Mfj. The theory based on Bean's model in the adiabatic approach was adapted and it was compared with experimental results. In addition, we observe the cross-over between the saw-tooth pattern and a rounded saw-tooth pattern, as a byproduct. A patterns diagram of the vortex jump was drawn on the H-T plane.\n\nKinematic and Microphysical Significance of Lightning Jumps versus Non-Jump Increases in Total Flash Rate\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchultz, Christopher J.; Carey, Lawrence D.; Schultz, Elise V.; Blakeslee, Richard J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThirty-nine thunderstorms are examined using multiple-Doppler, polarimetric and total lightning observations to understand the role of mixed phase kinematics and microphysics in the development of lightning jumps. This sample size is larger than those of previous studies on this topic. The principal result of this study is that lightning jumps are a result of mixed phase updraft intensification. Larger increases in intense updraft volume (â¥ 10 m sâ1) and larger changes in peak updraft speed are observed prior to lightning jump occurrence when compared to other non-jump increases in total flash rate. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Rank Sum testing yields p-values â¤0.05, indicating statistical independence between lightning jump and non-jump distributions for these two parameters. Similar changes in mixed phase graupel mass magnitude are observed prior to lightning jumps and non-jump increases in total flash rate. The p-value for graupel mass change is p=0.096, so jump and non-jump distributions for graupel mass change are not found statistically independent using the p=0.05 significance level. Timing of updraft volume, speed and graupel mass increases are found to be 4 to 13 minutes in advance of lightning jump occurrence. Also, severe storms without lightning jumps lack robust mixed phase updrafts, demonstrating that mixed phase updrafts are not always a requirement for severe weather occurrence. Therefore, the results of this study show that lightning jump occurrences are coincident with larger increases in intense mixed phase updraft volume and peak updraft speed than smaller non-jump increases in total flash rate.

The performed jumps should be similar to hill jumps, but a direct comparison of the kinetic and kinematic parameters has not been performed yet. Therefore, this study aimed to correlate 11 common parameters during hill jumps (Oberstdorf Germany), squat jumps (wearing indoor shoes), and various imitation jumps (rolling 4Â°, rolling flat, static; jumping equipment or indoor shoes) on a custom-built instrumented vehicle with a catch by the coach. During the performed jumps, force and video data of the take-off of 10 athletes were measured. The imitation and squat jumps were then ranked. The main difference between the hill jumps and the imitation and squat jumps is the higher maximal force loading rate during the hill jumps. Imitation jumps performed on a rolling platform, on flat ground were the most similar to hill jumps in terms of the force-time, and leg joint kinematic properties. Thus, non-hill jumps with a technical focus should be performed from a rolling platform with a flat inrun with normal indoor shoes or jumping equipment, and high normal force loading rates should be the main focus of imitation training.\n\nA 12-year National Study of Suicide by Jumping From Bridges in Norway.\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¦heim, Aleksandra; Hestetun, IngebjÃ¸rg; Mork, Erlend; Nrugham, Latha; Mehlum, Lars\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStudies from several countries suggest that erecting fences on bridges more commonly used for suicide by jumping may be an effective way of reducing the risk of suicide by jumping from these bridges. Distribution of suicides by jumping off bridges has not yet been studied on a national level in any country. This study included all suicides by jumping from high places registered in the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry (COD) in the period 1999-2010 (nÂ =Â 319). Combining data from the COD registry and information from police records, 71 cases of suicide by jumping off a bridge were identified involving 36 bridges. This form of suicide constituted approximately 1% of all suicides in Norway in the period 1999-2010. Almost half of these suicides were registered at only 6 bridges. Three Norwegian bridges were secured during the observation period of this study. Two bridges had barriers installed on the full length of the bridge with 11 suicides registered before barriers were installed, and none after. On the 1 bridge that was only partially secured, no change in numbers of suicides was observed after barriers were installed. One-third of jumps from bridges occurred over land. We found that although suicide by jumping off bridges was a relatively rare event, there is a potential for saving lives by installing physical barriers on bridges that are more commonly used for suicide by jumping.\n\nUse of video observation and motor imagery on jumping performance in national rhythmic gymnastics athletes.\n\nPubMed\n\nBattaglia, Claudia; D'Artibale, Emanuele; Fiorilli, Giovanni; Piazza, Marina; Tsopani, Despina; Giombini, Arrigo; Calcagno, Giuseppe; di Cagno, Alessandra\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate whether a mental training protocol could improve gymnastic jumping performance. Seventy-two rhythmic gymnasts were randomly divided into an experimental and control group. At baseline, experimental group completed the Movement Imagery Questionnaire Revised (MIQ-R) to assess the gymnast ability to generate movement imagery. A repeated measures design was used to compare two different types of training aimed at improving jumping performance: (a) video observation and PETTLEP mental training associated with physical practice, for the experimental group, and (b) physical practice alone for the control group. Before and after six weeks of training, their jumping performance was measured using the Hopping Test (HT), Drop Jump (DJ), and Counter Movement Jump (CMJ). Results revealed differences between jumping parameters F(1,71)=11.957; p<.01, and between groups F(1,71)=10.620; p<.01. In the experimental group there were significant correlations between imagery ability and the post-training Flight Time of the HT, r(34)=-.295, p<.05 and the DJ, r(34)=-.297, p<.05. The application of the protocol described herein was shown to improve jumping performance, thereby preserving the elite athlete's energy for other tasks. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We used a unique opportunity provided by a frog jumping contest to evaluate the validity of existing laboratory estimates of maximum jumping performance in bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana). We recorded video of 3124 bullfrog jumps over the course of the 4-day contest at the Calaveras County Jumping Frog Jubilee, and determined jump distance from these images and a calibration of the jump arena. Frogs were divided into two groups: 'rental' frogs collected by fair organizers and jumped by the general public, and frogs collected and jumped by experienced, 'professional' teams. A total of 58% of recorded jumps surpassed the maximum jump distance in the literature (1.295 m), and the longest jump was 2.2 m. Compared with rental frogs, professionally jumped frogs jumped farther, and the distribution of jump distances for this group was skewed towards long jumps. Calculated muscular work, historical records and the skewed distribution of jump distances all suggest that the longest jumps represent the true performance limit for this species. Using resampling, we estimated the probability of observing a given jump distance for various sample sizes, showing that large sample sizes are required to detect rare maximal jumps. These results show the importance of sample size, animal motivation and physiological conditions for accurate maximal performance estimates.\n\nLarge discrete jumps observed in the transition between Chern states in a ferromagnetic topological insulator\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Minhao; Wang, Wudi; Richardella, Anthony R.; Kandala, Abhinav; Li, Jian; Yazdani, Ali; Samarth, Nitin; Ong, N. Phuan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA striking prediction in topological insulators is the appearance of the quantized Hall resistance when the surface states are magnetized. The surface Dirac states become gapped everywhere on the surface, but chiral edge states remain on the edges. In an applied current, the edge states produce a quantized Hall resistance that equals the Chern number C = Â±1 (in natural units), even in zero magnetic field. This quantum anomalous Hall effect was observed by Chang et al. With reversal of the magnetic field, the system is trapped in a metastable state because of magnetic anisotropy. We investigate how the system escapes the metastable state at low temperatures (10 to 200 mK). When the dissipation (measured by the longitudinal resistance) is ultralow, we find that the system escapes by making a few very rapid transitions, as detected by large jumps in the Hall and longitudinal resistances. Using the field at which the initial jump occurs to estimate the escape rate, we find that raising the temperature strongly suppresses the rate. From a detailed map of the resistance versus gate voltage and temperature, we show that dissipation strongly affects the escape rate. We compare the observations with dissipative quantum tunneling predictions. In the ultralow dissipation regime, two temperature scales (T1 ~ 70 mK and T2 ~ 145 mK) exist, between which jumps can be observed. The jumps display a spatial correlation that extends over a large fraction of the sample. PMID:27482539\n\nDrop jumping. I. The influence of jumping technique on the biomechanics of jumping.\n\nPubMed\n\nBobbert, M F; Huijing, P A; van Ingen Schenau, G J\n\n1987-08-01\n\nIn the literature, drop jumping is advocated as an effective exercise for athletes who prepare themselves for explosive activities. When executing drop jumps, different jumping techniques can be used. In this study, the influence of jumping technique on the biomechanics of jumping is investigated. Ten subjects executed drop jumps from a height of 20 cm and counter-movement jumps. For the execution of the drop jumps, two different techniques were adopted. The first technique, referred to as bounce drop jump, required the subjects to reverse the downward velocity into an upward one as soon as possible after landing. The second technique, referred to as counter-movement drop jump, required them to do this more gradually by making a larger downward movement. During jumping, the subjects were filmed, ground reaction forces were registered, and electromyograms were recorded. The results of a biomechanical analysis show that moments and power output about knee and ankle joints reach larger values during the drop jumps than during counter-movement jumps. The largest values were attained during bounce drop jumps. Based on this finding, it was hypothesized that bounce drop jump is better suited than counter-movement drop jump for athletes who seek to improve the mechanical output of knee extensors and plantar flexors. Researchers are, therefore, advised to control jumping technique when investigating training effects of executing drop jumps.\n\nPlaying with inclined circular hydraulic jumps\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLebon, Luc; Saget, Beryl; Durand, Marc; Limat, Laurent; Couder, Yves; Receveur, Mathieu\n\n2008-11-01\n\nWe have investigated the structure of the circular hydraulic jump, when the jet impacts an inclined plate. At low plate slope, quasi-circular shapes, evolving towards elliptic shapes are observed. At moderate inclinations, the upper and lower jumps become markedly different, and the lower jump is even rejected to infinity when a critical inclination is reached. Above this critical inclination, the jump is coupled to an outer dewetting contact line to give a specific object (expanding impact sheet feeding a curved rim in which the liquid is flowing tangentially). In this regime, both the position and curvature of the upper jump follows unusual scalings with the flow rate that completely differ from those observed on horizontal plates. Finally we have looked to metastable drops trapped in the circular jump at very small inclinations. As reported in a previous APS, the lowest position in the jump can become unstable and the drops oscillate around the jump perimeter. We show that this behavior requires very specific conditions of surface tension and viscosity and propose simple interpretations for the instability mechanism.\n\nJumping on water\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Ho-Young\n\n2016-11-01\n\nWater striders can jump on water as high as they can jump on land. Quick jumps allow them to avoid sudden dangers such as predators' attacks, and therefore understanding how they make such a dramatic motion for survival can shed light on the ultimate level of semi-aquatic motility achievable through evolution. However, the mechanism of their vertical jumping from a water surface has eluded hydrodynamic explanations so far. By observing movements of water strider legs and theoretically analyzing their dynamic interactions with deforming liquid-air interface, we have recently found that different species of jumping striders always tune their leg rotation speed with a force just below that required to break the water surface to reach the maximum take-off velocity. Here, we start with discussing the fundamental theories of dynamics of floating and sinking of small objects. The theories then enable us to analyze forces acting on a water strider while it presses down the water surface to fully exploit the capillary force. We further introduce a 68-milligram at-scale robotic insect capable of jumping on water without splash, strikingly similar to the real strider, by utilizing the water surface just as a trampoline.\n\nDo Bilateral Vertical Jumps With Reactive Jump Landings Achieve Osteogenic Thresholds With and Without Instruction in Premenopausal Women?\n\nPubMed\n\nClissold, Tracey L; Winwood, Paul W; Cronin, John B; De Souza, Mary Jane\n\n2018-04-01\n\nJumps have been investigated as a stimulus for bone development; however, effects of instruction, jump type, and jump-landing techniques need investigation. This study sought to identify whether ground reaction forces (GRFs) for bilateral vertical jumps (countermovement jumps and drop jumps) with reactive jump-landings (ie, jumping immediately after initial jump-landing), with instruction and with instruction withdrawn, achieve magnitudes and rates of strain previously shown to improve bone mass among premenopausal women. Twenty-one women (MeanâÂ±âSD: 43.3âÂ±â5.9Â y; 69.4âÂ±â9.6Â kg; 167âÂ±â5.5Â cm; 27.5âÂ±â8.7% body fat) performed a testing session 'with instruction' followed by a testing session performed 1Â week later with 'instruction withdrawn.' The magnitudes (4.59 to 5.49 body weight [BW]) and rates of strain (263 to 359Â BWÂ·s -1 ) for the jump-landings, performed on an AMTI force plate, exceeded previously determined thresholds (>3Â BWs and >43Â BWÂ·s -1 ). Interestingly, significantly larger peak resultant forces, (â10%; Pâ=â.002) and peak rates of force development (â20%; Pâ<â.001) values (in relation to BW and BWÂ·s -1 , respectively) were observed for the second jump-landing (postreactive jump). Small increases (ESâ=â0.22-0.42) in all landing forces were observed in the second jump-landing with 'instruction withdrawn.' These jumps represent a unique training stimulus for premenopausal women and achieve osteogenic thresholds thought prerequisite for bone growth.\n\nEffects of timing of signal indicating jump directions on knee biomechanics in jump-landing-jump tasks.\n\nPubMed\n\nStephenson, Mitchell L; Hinshaw, Taylour J; Wadley, Haley A; Zhu, Qin; Wilson, Margaret A; Byra, Mark; Dai, Boyi\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA variety of the available time to react (ATR) has been utilised to study knee biomechanics during reactive jump-landing tasks. The purpose was to quantify knee kinematics and kinetics during a jump-land-jump task of three possible directions as the ATR was reduced. Thirty-four recreational athletes performed 45 trials of a jump-land-jump task, during which the direction of the second jump (lateral, medial or vertical) was indicated before they initiated the first jump, the instant they initiated the first jump, 300Â ms before landing, 150Â ms before landing or at the instant of landing. Knee joint angles and moments close to the instant of landing were significantly different when the ATR was equal to or more than 300Â ms before landing, but became similar when the ATR was 150Â ms or 0Â ms before landing. As the ATR was decreased, knee moments decreased for the medial jump direction, but increased for the lateral jump direction. When the ATR is shorter than an individual's reaction time, the movement pattern cannot be pre-planned before landing. Knee biomechanics are dependent on the timing of the signal and the subsequent jump direction. Precise control of timing and screening athletes with low ATR are suggested.\n\nBiomechanics of jumping in the flea.\n\nPubMed\n\nSutton, Gregory P; Burrows, Malcolm\n\n2011-03-01\n\nIt has long been established that fleas jump by storing and releasing energy in a cuticular spring, but it is not known how forces from that spring are transmitted to the ground. One hypothesis is that the recoil of the spring pushes the trochanter onto the ground, thereby generating the jump. A second hypothesis is that the recoil of the spring acts through a lever system to push the tibia and tarsus onto the ground. To decide which of these two hypotheses is correct, we built a kinetic model to simulate the different possible velocities and accelerations produced by each proposed process and compared those simulations with the kinematics measured from high-speed images of natural jumping. The in vivo velocity and acceleration kinematics are consistent with the model that directs ground forces through the tibia and tarsus. Moreover, in some natural jumps there was no contact between the trochanter and the ground. There were also no observable differences between the kinematics of jumps that began with the trochanter on the ground and jumps that did not. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the tibia and tarsus have spines appropriate for applying forces to the ground, whereas no such structures were seen on the trochanter. Based on these observations, we discount the hypothesis that fleas use their trochantera to apply forces to the ground and conclude that fleas jump by applying forces to the ground through the end of the tibiae.\n\nValidity of Hip-worn Inertial Measurement Unit Compared to Jump Mat for Jump Height Measurement in Adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nRantalainen, T; Hesketh, K D; Rodda, C; Duckham, R L\n\n2018-06-16\n\nJump tests assess lower body power production capacity, and can be used to evaluate athletic ability and development during growth. Wearable inertial measurement units (IMU) seem to offer a feasible alternative to laboratory-based equipment for jump height assessments. Concurrent validity of these devices for jump height assessments has only been established in adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the concurrent validity of IMU-based jump height estimate compared to contact mat-based jump height estimate in adolescents. Ninety-five adolescents (10-13 years-of-age; girls N=41, height = 154 (SD 9) cm, weight = 44 (11) kg; boys N=54, height=156 (10) cm, weight = 46 (13) kg) completed three counter-movement jumps for maximal jump height on a contact mat. Inertial recordings (accelerations, rotations) were concurrently recorded with a hip-worn IMU (sampling at 256 Hz). Jump height was evaluated based on flight time. The mean IMU-derived jump height was 27.1 (SD 3.8) cm, and the corresponding mean jump-mat-derived value was 21.5 (3.4) cm. While a significant 26% mean difference was observed between the methods (5.5 [95% limits of agreement 2.2 to 8.9] cm, p = 0.006), the correspondence between methods was excellent (ICC = 0.89). The difference between methods was weakly positively associated with jump height (r = 0.28, P = 0.007). Take-off velocity derived jump height was also explored but produced only fair congruence. In conclusion, IMU-derived jump height exhibited excellent congruence to contact mat-based jump height and therefore presents a feasible alternative for jump height assessments in adolescents.

It was reported recently that the jump of medium-sized water striders is a result of surface-tension-dominated interaction of thin cylindrical legs and water, with the leg movement speed nearly optimized to achieve the maximum takeoff velocity. Here we describe the mathematical theories to analyze this exquisite feat of nature by combining the review of existing models for floating and jumping and the introduction of the hitherto neglected capillary forces at the cylinder tips. The theoretically predicted dependence of body height on time is shown to match the observations of the jumps of the water striders and springtails regardless of the length of locomotory appendages. The theoretical framework can be used to understand the design principle of small jumping animals living on water and to develop biomimetic locomotion technology in semiaquatic environments.\n\nMobile Jump Assessment (mJump): A Descriptive and Inferential Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMateos-Angulo, Alvaro; GalÃ¡n-Mercant, Alejandro; Cuesta-Vargas, Antonio\n\n2015-08-26\n\nVertical jump tests are used in athletics and rehabilitation to measure physical performance in people of different age ranges and fitness. Jumping ability can be analyzed through different variables, and the most commonly used are fly time and jump height. They can be obtained by a variety of measuring devices, but most are limited to laboratory use only. The current generation of smartphones contains inertial sensors that are able to record kinematic variables for human motion analysis, since they are tools for easy access and portability for clinical use. The aim of this study was to describe and analyze the kinematics characteristics using the inertial sensor incorporated in the iPhone 4S, the lower limbs strength through a manual dynamometer, and the jump variables obtained with a contact mat in the squat jump and countermovement jump tests (fly time and jump height) from a cohort of healthy people. A cross sectional study was conducted on a population of healthy young adults. Twenty-seven participants performed three trials (n=81 jumps) of squat jump and countermovement jump tests. Acceleration variables were measured through a smartphone's inertial sensor. Additionally, jump variables from a contact mat and lower limbs dynamometry were collected. In the present study, the kinematic variables derived from acceleration through the inertial sensor of a smartphone iPhone 4S, dynamometry of lower limbs with a handheld dynamometer, and the height and flight time with a contact mat have been described in vertical jump tests from a cohort of young healthy subjects. The development of the execution has been described, examined and identified in a squat jump test and countermovement jump test under acceleration variables that were obtained with the smartphone. The built-in iPhone 4S inertial sensor is able to measure acceleration variables while performing vertical jump tests for the squat jump and countermovement jump in healthy young adults.

Farzad\n\nIt was recently discovered that condensation growing on a nanostructured superhydrophobic surface can spontaneously jump off the surface, triggered by naturally occurring coalescence events. Many reports have observed that droplets must grow to a size of order 10 Î¼m before jumping is enabled upon coalescence; however, it remains unknown how the critical jumping size relates to the topography of the underlying nanostructure. Here, we characterize the dynamic behavior of condensation growing on six different superhydrophobic nanostructures, where the topography of the nanopillars was systematically varied. The critical jumping diameter was observed to be highly dependent upon the height, diameter, andmoreÂ Â» pitch of the nanopillars: tall and slender nanopillars promoted 2 Î¼m jumping droplets while short and stout nanopillars increased the critical size to over 20 Î¼m. The topology of each surface is successfully correlated to the critical jumping diameter by constructing an energetic model that predicts how large a nucleating embryo needs to grow before it can inflate into the air with an apparent contact angle large enough for jumping. Furthermore, by extending our model to consider any possible surface, it is revealed that properly designed nanostructures should enable nanometric jumping droplets, which would further enhance jumping droplet condensers for heat transfer, anti-fogging, and anti-frosting applications.Â«Â less\n\nTuning Superhydrophobic Nanostructures To Enhance Jumping-Droplet Condensation\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMulroe, Megan D.; Srijanto, Bernadeta R.; Ahmadi, S.

We therefore analysed the jumping performance of froghoppers ( Philaenus spumarius, Aphrophoridae) and leafhoppers ( Aphrodes bicinctus/makarovi, Cicadellidae) taking off from smooth (glass) and rough (sandpaper, 30 Âµm asperity size) surfaces. On glass, the propulsive hind legs of Philaenus froghoppers slipped, resulting in uncontrolled jumps with a fast forward spin, a steeper angle and only a quarter of the velocity compared with jumps from rough surfaces. By contrast, Aphrodes leafhoppers took off without their propulsive hind legs slipping, and reached low take-off angles and high velocities on both substrates. This difference in jumping ability from smooth surfaces can be explained not only by the lower acceleration of the long-legged leafhoppers, but also by the presence of 2-9 soft pad-like structures (platellae) on their hind tarsi, which are absent in froghoppers. High-speed videos of jumping showed that platellae contact the surface briefly (approx. 3 ms) during the acceleration phase. Friction force measurements on individual hind tarsi on glass revealed that at low sliding speeds, both pushing and pulling forces were small, and insufficient to explain the recorded jumps. Only when the tarsi were pushed with higher velocities did the contact area of the platellae increase markedly, and high friction forces were produced, consistent with the observed jumps. Our findings show that leafhoppers have special adhesive footpads for jumping from smooth surfaces, which achieve firm grip and rapid control of attachment/detachment by combining anisotropic friction with velocity dependence.

However, ever since Leonardo da Vinci asked it for the first time, an important question has been left unanswered: How does a hydraulic jump form? We present an experimental and theoretical study of the formation of stationary hydraulic jumps in centimeter wide channels. Two starting situations are considered: The channel is, respectively, empty or filled with liquid, the liquid level being fixed by the wetting properties and the boundary conditions. We then change the flow-rate abruptly from zero to a constant value. In an empty channel, we observe the formation of a stationary hydraulic jump in a two-stage process: First, the channel fills by the advancing liquid front, which undergoes a transition from supercritical to subcritical at some position in the channel. Later the influence of the downstream boundary conditions makes the jump move slowly upstream to its final position. In the pre-filled channel, the hydraulic jump forms at the injector edge and then moves downstream to its final position.\n\nPopcorn: critical temperature, jump and sound\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVirot, Emmanuel; Ponomarenko, Alexandre\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPopcorn bursts open, jumps and emits a âpopâ sound in some hundredths of a second.

We compared a repeated jump power index in a 60 s repeated jump test to determine the relationship of repeated jump test to competitive rank and to measure 2D hip, knee, and ankle angles and angular velocities at 0, 20, 40, and 60 s. Eighteen National Team Pairs Figure Skaters performed a 60 s repeated jump test on a large switch-mat with timing of flight and ground durations and digital video recording. Each 60-s period was divided into 6, 10-s intervals, with power indexes (W/kg) calculated for each 10-s interval. Power index by 10-s interval repeated measures ANOVAs (RMANOVA) showed that males exceeded females at all intervals, and the highest power index interval was during 10 to 20 s for both sexes. RMANOVAs of angles and angular velocities showed main effects for time only. Power index and jumping techniques among figure skaters showed rapid and steady declines over the test duration. Power index can predict approximately 50% of competitive rank variance, and sex differences in jumping technique were rare. Key pointsThe repeated jumps test can account for about 50% of the variance in pairs ranks.Changes in technique are largely due to fatigue, but the athletes were able to maintain a maximum flexion knee angle very close to the desired 90 degrees. Changes in angular velocity and jump heights occurred as expected, again probably due to fatigue.As expected from metabolic information, the athletes' power indexes peak around 20s and decline thereafter. Coaches should be aware of this time as a boundary beyond which fatigue becomes more manifest, and use careful choreographic choices to provide rest periods that are disguised as less demanding skating elements to afford recovery.The repeated jumps test may be a helpful off-ice test of power-endurance for figure skaters.\n\nControl strategy of maximum vertical jumps: The preferred countermovement depth may not be fully optimized for jump height.\n\nPubMed\n\nMandic, Radivoj; Knezevic, Olivera M; Mirkov, Dragan M; Jaric, Slobodan\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the control strategy of maximum countermovement jumps regarding the preferred countermovement depth preceding the concentric jump phase. Elite basketball players and physically active non-athletes were tested on the jumps performed with and without an arm swing, while the countermovement depth was varied within the interval of almost 30 cm around its preferred value. The results consistently revealed 5.1-11.2 cm smaller countermovement depth than the optimum one, but the same difference was more prominent in non-athletes. In addition, although the same differences revealed a marked effect on the recorded force and power output, they reduced jump height for only 0.1-1.2 cm. Therefore, the studied control strategy may not be based solely on the countermovement depth that maximizes jump height. In addition, the comparison of the two groups does not support the concept of a dual-task strategy based on the trade-off between maximizing jump height and minimizing the jumping quickness that should be more prominent in the athletes that routinely need to jump quickly. Further research could explore whether the observed phenomenon is based on other optimization principles, such as the minimization of effort and energy expenditure. Nevertheless, future routine testing procedures should take into account that the control strategy of maximum countermovement jumps is not fully based on maximizing the jump height, while the countermovement depth markedly confound the relationship between the jump height and the assessed force and power output of leg muscles.\n\nInfluence of lumbar spine extension on vertical jump height during maximal squat jumping.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlache, Yoann; Monteil, Karine\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the influence of lumbar spine extension and erector spinae muscle activation on vertical jump height during maximal squat jumping. Eight male athletes performed maximal squat jumps. Electromyograms of the erector spinae were recorded during these jumps. A simulation model of the musculoskeletal system was used to simulate maximal squat jumping with and without spine extension. The effect on vertical jump height of changing erector spinae strength was also tested through the simulated jumps. Concerning the participant jumps, the kinematics indicated a spine extension and erector spinae activation. Concerning the simulated jumps, vertical jump height was about 5.4 cm lower during squat jump without trunk extension compared to squat jump. These results were explained by greater total muscle work during squat jump, more especially by the erector spinae work (+119.5 J). The erector spinae may contribute to spine extension during maximal squat jumping. The simulated jumps confirmed this hypothesis showing that vertical jumping was decreased if this muscle was not taken into consideration in the model. Therefore it is concluded that the erector spinae should be considered as a trunk extensor, which enables to enhance total muscle work and consequently vertical jump height.\n\nLeg stiffness and expertise in men jumping.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaffaye, Guillaume; Bardy, BenoÃ®t G; Durey, Alain\n\n2005-04-01\n\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate: a) the leg spring behavior in the one-leg vertical jump, b) the contribution of impulse parameters to this behavior, and c) the effect of jumping expertise on leg stiffness. Four categories of experts (handball, basketball, volleyball players, and Fosbury athletes), as well as novice subjects performed a run-and-jump test to touch a ball with the head. Five experimental conditions were tested from 55 to 95% of the maximum jump height. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using six cameras and a force plate. The mechanical behavior of the musculoskeleton component of the human body can be modeled as a simple mass-spring system, from which leg stiffness values can be extracted to better understand energy transfer during running or jumping. The results indicate that leg stiffness (mean value of 11.5 kN.m) decreased with jumping height. Leg shortening at takeoff also increased with jumping height, whereas contact time decreased (-18%). No difference was found between experts and novices for leg stiffness. However, a principal components analysis (PCA) indicated the contribution of two main factors to the performance. The first factor emerged out of vertical force, stiffness, and duration of impulse. The second factor included leg shortening and jumping height. Differences between experts and novices were observed in terms of the contribution of leg stiffness to jump height, and more importantly, clear differences existed between experts in jumping parameters. The analysis performed on the sport categories indeed revealed different jumping profiles, characterized by specific, sport-related impulse parameters.\n\nJumping to (fatal) conclusions? An analysis of video film on a social networking web site of recreational jumping from height into water.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoran, Kevin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn high-income countries, death as a consequence of recreational jumping into water from height has not been well investigated partly because it traditionally has been a covert activity within youth culture. An observational study of video recordings posted on the YouTube web site was used to gather data on the nature of jumping activity in New Zealand and Australia. An analytical framework was developed to identify site- participant- social characteristics (10 variables) and online feedback (4 variables). Of the 389 videos recorded in New Zealand (n = 210) and Australia (n = 179), 929 jumpers were observed, and rivers were the most frequently reported site of jumping activity (New Zealand 47%; Australia 35%). One fifth (20%) of the jumps in New Zealand and one third (33%) in Australia were from heights estimated to be more than 12 m. The YouTube website portraying jumps from height were visited almost half a million times (495,686 hits). Ways of reducing recreational jumping risk via targeted education interventions may be best directed at young male adults. Use of social network sites to foster safe behaviours may be an effective way to educate young people of the inherent risks of jumping from height into water.\n\nTesting jumps via false discovery rate control.\n\nPubMed\n\nYen, Yu-Min\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMany recently developed nonparametric jump tests can be viewed as multiple hypothesis testing problems. For such multiple hypothesis tests, it is well known that controlling type I error often makes a large proportion of erroneous rejections, and such situation becomes even worse when the jump occurrence is a rare event. To obtain more reliable results, we aim to control the false discovery rate (FDR), an efficient compound error measure for erroneous rejections in multiple testing problems. We perform the test via the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) test statistic, and control the FDR with the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure. We provide asymptotic results for the FDR control. From simulations, we examine relevant theoretical results and demonstrate the advantages of controlling the FDR. The hybrid approach is then applied to empirical analysis on two benchmark stock indices with high frequency data.\n\nElectrostatic potential jump across fast-mode collisionless shocks\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMandt, M. E.; Kan, J. R.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe electrostatic potential jump across fast-mode collisionless shocks is examined by comparing published observations, hybrid simulations, and a simple model, in order to better characterize its dependence on the various shock parameters. In all three, it is assumed that the electrons can be described by an isotropic power-law equation of state. The observations show that the cross-shock potential jump correlates well with the shock strength but shows very little correlation with other shock parameters. Assuming that the electrons obey an isotropic power law equation of state, the correlation of the potential jump with the shock strength follows naturally from the increased shock compression and an apparent dependence of the power law exponent on the Mach number which the observations indicate. It is found that including a Mach number dependence for the power law exponent in the electron equation of state in the simple model produces a potential jump which better fits the observations. On the basis of the simulation results and theoretical estimates of the cross-shock potential, it is discussed how the cross-shock potential might be expected to depend on the other shock parameters.\n\nAn efficient interpolation technique for jump proposals in reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFarr, W. M.; Mandel, I.; Stevens, D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSelection among alternative theoretical models given an observed dataset is an important challenge in many areas of physics and astronomy. Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is an extremely powerful technique for performing Bayesian model selection, but it suffers from a fundamental difficulty and it requires jumps between model parameter spaces, but cannot efficiently explore both parameter spaces at once. Thus, a naive jump between parameter spaces is unlikely to be accepted in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and convergence is correspondingly slow. Here, we demonstrate an interpolation technique that uses samples from single-model MCMCs to propose intermodel jumps from an approximation to the single-model posterior of the target parameter space. The interpolation technique, based on a kD-tree data structure, is adaptive and efficient in modest dimensionality. We show that our technique leads to improved convergence over naive jumps in an RJMCMC, and compare it to other proposals in the literature to improve the convergence of RJMCMCs. We also demonstrate the use of the same interpolation technique as a way to construct efficient âglobalâ proposal distributions for single-model MCMCs without prior knowledge of the structure of the posterior distribution, and discuss improvements that permit the method to be used in higher dimensional spaces efficiently.

Kinematics and kinetics of squats, drop jumps and imitation jumps of ski jumpers. J Strength Cond Res 30(3): 643â652, 2016âSquats, drop jumps, and imitation jumps are commonly used training exercises in ski jumping to enhance maximum force, explosive force, and sport-specific skills. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the kinetics and kinematics of training exercises in ski jumping and to find objective parameters in training exercises that most correlate with the competition performance of ski jumpers. To this end, barbell squats, drop jumps, and imitation jumps were measured in a laboratory environment for 10 elite ski jumpers. Force and motion data were captured, and the influence of maximum vertical force, force difference, vertical take-off velocity, knee moments, knee joint power, and a knee valgus/varus index was evaluated and correlated with their season jump performance. The results indicate that, especially for the imitation jumps, a good correlation exists between the vertical take-off velocity and the personal jump performance on the hill (R = 0.718). Importantly, however, the more the athletes tended toward a valgus knee alignment during the measured movements, the worse their performance (R = 0.729 imitation jumps; R = 0.685 squats). Although an evaluation of the athletes' lower limb alignment during competitive jumping on the hill is still required, these preliminary data suggest that performance training should additionally concentrate on improving knee alignment to increase ski jumping performance.

FPV was defined as the velocity reached just before bar acceleration was lower than gravity (-9.81 mÂ·s(-2)). Vertical jump height was calculated from the take-off velocity (Vtake-off) provided by a force platform. Thirty swimmers belonging to the National Slovenian swimming team performed a jump squat incremental loading test, lifting 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of body weight in a Smith machine. Jump performance was simultaneously monitored using an AMTI portable force platform and a linear velocity transducer attached to the barbell. Simple linear regression was used to estimate jump height from the Vmax and FPV recorded by the linear velocity transducer. Vmax (y = 16.577x - 16.384) was able to explain 93% of jump height variance with a standard error of the estimate of 1.47 cm. FPV (y = 12.828x - 6.504) was able to explain 91% of jump height variance with a standard error of the estimate of 1.66 cm. Despite that both variables resulted to be good predictors, heteroscedasticity in the differences between FPV and Vtake-off was observed (r(2) = 0.307), while the differences between Vmax and Vtake-off were homogenously distributed (r(2) = 0.071). These results suggest that Vmax is a valid tool for estimating vertical jump height in a loaded jump squat test performed in a Smith machine.

Experimental observations show that the condensate droplet jumping is induced by coalescence of multiple droplets of different sizes, and that the coalesced droplet trajectories typically deviate from the surface normal. A depth-from-defocus image processing technique is developed to track the out-of-plane displacement of the jumping droplets, so as to accurately measure the droplet size and velocity. The results demonstrate that the highest jumping velocity is achieved when two droplets coalesce. The jumping velocity decreases gradually with an increase in the number of coalescing droplets, despite the greater potential surface energy released upon coalescence. A general theoretical model that accounts for viscous dissipation, surface adhesion, line tension, the initial droplet wetting states, and the number and sizes of the coalescing droplets is developed to explain the trends of droplet jumping velocity observed in the experiments.

In this study, center of mass displacement was calculated using the pelvic kinematic method and compared with center of mass displacement using the ground-reaction force-impulse method, in experienced athletes (n = 13) performing restricted countermovement vertical jumps. Maximal vertical jumps were performed in a biomechanics laboratory, with data collected using an 8-camera motion analysis system and two force platforms. The pelvis center of mass was reconstructed from retro-reflective markers placed on the pelvis. Jump height was determined from the peak height of the pelvis center of mass minus the standing height. Strong linear relationships were observed between the pelvic kinematic and impulse methods (RÂ² = .86; p < .01). The pelvic kinematic method underestimated jump height versus the impulse method, however, the difference was small (CV = 4.34%). This investigation demonstrates concurrent validity for the pelvic kinematic method to determine vertical jump height.\n\nPotential for Non-Contact ACL Injury Between Step-Close-Jump and Hop-Jump Tasks.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Li-I; Gu, Chin-Yi; Chen, Wei-Ling; Chang, Mu-San\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to compare the kinematics and kinetics during the landing of hop-jump and step-close-jump movements in order to provide further inferring that the potential risk of ACL injuries. Eleven elite male volleyball players were recruited to perform hop-jump and step-close-jump tasks. Lower extremity kinematics and ground reaction forces during landing in stop-jump tasks were recorded. Lower extremity kinetics was calculated by using an inverse dynamic process. Step-close-jump tasks demonstrated smaller peak proximal tibia anterior shear forces during the landing phase. In step-close-jump tasks, increasing hip joint angular velocity during initial foot-ground contact decreased peak posterior ground reaction force during the landing phase, which theoretically could reduce the risk of ACL injury. Key pointsThe different landing techniques required for these two stop-jump tasks do not necessarily affect the jump height.Hop-jump decreased the hip joint angular velocity at initial foot contact with ground, which could lead to an increasing peak posterior GRF during the landing phase.Hop-jump decreased hip and knee joint angular flexion displacement during the landing, which could increase the peak vertical loading rate during the landing phase.\n\nIntra-Personal and Inter-Personal Kinetic Synergies During Jumping.\n\nPubMed\n\nSlomka, Kajetan; Juras, Grzegorz; Sobota, Grzegorz; Furmanek, Mariusz; Rzepko, Marian; Latash, Mark L\n\n2015-12-22\n\nWe explored synergies between two legs and two subjects during preparation for a long jump into a target. Synergies were expected during one-person jumping. No such synergies were expected between two persons jumping in parallel without additional contact, while synergies were expected to emerge with haptic contact and become stronger with strong mechanical contact. Subjects performed jumps either alone (each foot standing on a separate force platform) or in dyads (parallel to each other, each person standing on a separate force platform) without any contact, with haptic contact, and with strong coupling. Strong negative correlations between pairs of force variables (strong synergies) were seen in the vertical force in one-person jumps and weaker synergies in two-person jumps with the strong contact. For other force variables, only weak synergies were present in one-person jumps and no negative correlations between pairs of force variable for two-person jumps. Pairs of moment variables from the two force platforms at steady state showed positive correlations, which were strong in one-person jumps and weaker, but still significant, in two-person jumps with the haptic and strong contact. Anticipatory synergy adjustments prior to action initiation were observed in one-person trials only. We interpret the different results for the force and moment variables at steady state as reflections of postural sway.\n\nIntra-Personal and Inter-Personal Kinetic Synergies During Jumping\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSlomka, Kajetan; Juras, Grzegorz; Sobota, Grzegorz; Furmanek, Mariusz; Rzepko, Marian; Latash, Mark L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe explored synergies between two legs and two subjects during preparation for a long jump into a target.

However, whether the coalescence-induced jumping would occur for smaller, particularly nanoscale droplets, is an open question. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that in spite of the large internal viscous dissipation, coalescence of two nanoscale droplets on a super-hydrophobic surface can result in a jumping of the coalesced droplet from the surface with a speed of a few m/s. Similar to the coalescence-induced jumping of microscale droplets, we observe that the bridge between the coalescing nano-droplets expands and impacts the solid surface, which leads to an acceleration of the coalesced droplet by the pressure force from the solid surface. We observe that the jumping velocity decreases with the droplet size and its ratio to the inertial-capillary velocity is a constant of about 0.126, which is close to the minimum value of 0.111 predicted by continuum-level modeling of Enright et al.

We analysed blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood glucose, lactate and creatinkinase, leg strength, isometric hand strength, cortical arousal, specific fine motor skills, self-confidence and cognition, and somatic and state anxiety, before and after four different parachute jumps: a sport parachute jump, a manual tactical parachute jump, tandem pilots, and tandem passengers. Independently of the parachute jump, the psychophysiological responses of experienced paratroopers were not affected by the jumps, except for an increase in anaerobic metabolism. Novice parachute jumpers presented a higher psychophysiological stress response than the experienced jumpers, together with a large anticipatory anxiety response before the jump; however, this decreased after the jump, although the high physiological activation was maintained. This information could be used by civil and military paratroopers' instructors to improve their training programmes. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

As the Froude number becomes higher than one, the flow super criticality induces an instability which yields the emergence of a steep structure at the fluid surface. Strongly deformed liquid-air interface can be observed as a jet of viscous fluid impinges a flat boundary at high enough velocity. In this experimental setup, the location of the jump depends on the viscosity of the liquid, as shown by T. Bohr et al. in 1997. In 2014, A. Duchesne et al. have established the constancy of the Froude number at jump. Hence, it remains a contradiction, in which the radial hydraulic jump location might be explained through inviscid theory, but is also viscosity dependent. We present a model based on the 2011 Rojas et al. PRL, which solves this paradox. The agreement with experimental measurements is excellent not only for the prediction of the position of the hydraulic jump, but also for the determination of the fluid thickness profile. We predict theoretically the critical value of the Froude number, which matches perfectly to that measured by Duchesne et al.

Eighteen male college athletes performed 3 bilateral countermovement jumps (CMJs) on 2 JJSs (alternative method) that were placed on top of a force platform (criterion method). Two JJSs were used to establish consistency between systems. Jump height was calculated from flight time obtained from the JJS and force platform. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) demonstrated excellent within-session reliability of the CMJ height measurement derived from both the JJS (ICC = .96, P < .001) and the force platform (ICC = .96, P < .001). Dependent t tests revealed that the JJS yielded a significantly greater CMJ jump height (0.46 Â± 0.09 m vs 0.33 Â± 0.08 m) than the force platform (P < .001, Cohen d = 1.39, power = 1.00). There was, however, an excellent relationship between CMJ heights derived from the JJS and force platform (r = .998, P < .001, power = 1.00), with a coefficient of determination (R2) of .995. Therefore, the following correction equation was produced: Criterion jump height = (0.8747 Ã alternative jump height) - 0.0666. The JJS provides a reliable but overestimated measure of jump height. It is suggested, therefore, that practitioners who use the JJS as part of future work apply the correction equation presented in this study to resultant jump-height values.\n\nIntersession and Intrasession Reliability and Validity of the My Jump App for Measuring Different Jump Actions in Trained Male and Female Athletes.\n\nPubMed\n\nGallardo-Fuentes, Francisco; Gallardo-Fuentes, Jorge; RamÃ­rez-Campillo, Rodrigo; Balsalobre-FernÃ¡ndez, Carlos; MartÃ­nez, Cristian; Caniuqueo, Alexis; CaÃ±as, Rodrigo; Banzer, Winfried; Loturco, Irineu; Nakamura, Fabio Y; Izquierdo, Mikel\n\n2016-07-01\n\nGallardo-Fuentes, F, Gallardo-Fuentes, J, RamÃ­rez-Campillo, R, Balsalobre-FernÃ¡ndez, C, MartÃ­nez, C, Caniuqueo, A, CaÃ±as, R, Banzer, W, Loturco, I, Nakamura, FY, and Izquierdo, M.

J Strength Cond Res 30(7): 2049-2056, 2016-The purpose of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of the iPhone app named My Jump for measuring jump height in 40-cm drop jumps (DJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), and squat jumps (SJs). To do this, 21 male and female athletes (age, 22.1 Â± 3.6 years) completed 5 maximal DJs, CMJs, and SJs on 2 separate days, which were evaluated using a contact platform and the app My Jump, developed to calculate jump height from flight time using the high-speed video recording facility on the iPhone. A total of 630 jumps were compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plots, Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient (r), Cronbach's alpha (Î±), and coefficient of variation (CV). There was almost perfect agreement between the measurement instruments for all jump height values (ICC = 0.97-0.99), with no differences between the instruments (p > 0.05; mean difference of 0.2 cm). Almost perfect correlation was observed between the measurement instruments for SJs, CMJs, and DJs (r = 0.96-0.99). My Jump showed very good within-subject reliability (Î± = 0.94-0.99; CV = 3.8-7.6) and interday reliability (r = 0.86-0.95) for SJs, CMJs, and DJs in all subjects. Therefore, the iPhone app named My Jump provides reliable intersession and intrasession data, as well as valid measurements for maximal jump height during fast (i.e., DJs) and slow (i.e., CMJs) stretch-shortening cycle muscle actions, and during concentric-only explosive muscle actions (i.e., SJs), in both male and female athletes in comparison with a professional contact platform.\n\nAcute effects of a resisted dynamic warm-up protocol on jumping performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nCilli, M; Gelen, E; Yildiz, S; Saglam, T; Camur, Mh\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the kinematic and kinetic changes when resistance is applied in horizontal and vertical directions, produced by using different percentages of body weight, caused by jumping movements during a dynamic warm-up.

A dynamic warm-up protocol containing seven specific resistance movements with specific resistance corresponding to different percentages of body weight (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%) was applied randomly on non consecutive days. Effects of different warm-up protocols were assessed by pre-/post- exercise changes in jump height in the countermovement jump (CMJ) and the squat jump (SJ) measured using a force platform and changes in hip and knee joint angles at the end of the eccentric phase measured using a video camera. A significant increase in jump height was observed in the dynamic resistance warm-up conducted with different percentages of body weight (p < 0.05). On the other hand, no significant difference in different percentages of body weight states was observed (p > 0.05). In jump movements before and after the warm-up, while no significant difference between the vertical ground reaction forces applied by athletes was observed (p > 0.05), in some cases of resistance, a significant reduction was observed in hip and knee joint angles (p < 0.05). The dynamic resistance warm-up method was found to cause changes in the kinematics of jumping movements, as well as an increase in jump height values. As a result, dynamic warm-up exercises could be applicable in cases of resistance corresponding to 6-10% of body weight applied in horizontal and vertical directions in order to increase the jump performance\n\nACUTE EFFECTS OF A RESISTED DYNAMIC WARM-UP PROTOCOL ON JUMPING PERFORMANCE\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCilli, M; Yildiz, S; Saglam, T; Camur, MH\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the kinematic and kinetic changes when resistance is applied in horizontal and vertical directions, produced by using different percentages of body weight, caused by jumping movements during a dynamic warm-up.

It has been suggested that reactive jumps inducing high forces in the muscles-consequently exposing the bones to high strains-help to counteract these degradations. In a previous study, a new sledge jump system (SJS) was found to allow fairly natural reactive jumps. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if training in the SJS would further reduce the differences between jumps in the SJS and normal jumps, particularly with respect to ground reaction forces (GRF) and rate of force development (RFD). Sixteen participants in a training group (TG) and 16 in a control group (CON) were tested before and after the TGs four-week hopping training in the SJS. During the tests, kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic data were compared between hops on the ground and in the SJS. After the training period, the GRF, the RFD and the leg stiffness in the SJS significantly increased for the TG (but not for CON) by 10, 35 and 38%, respectively. The kinematic and electromyographic data showed no significant changes. A short training regimen in the SJS reduced the differences between jumps in the SJS and normal jumps. Considering that a natural movement that exposes the muscles and thus also the bones to high loads is regarded as important for the preservation of muscle and bone, the SJS seems to be a promising countermeasure.\n\nOptimal compliant-surface jumping: a multi-segment model of springboard standing jumps.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, Kuangyou B; Hubbard, Mont\n\n2005-09-01\n\nA multi-segment model is used to investigate optimal compliant-surface jumping strategies and is applied to springboard standing jumps. The human model has four segments representing the feet, shanks, thighs, and trunk-head-arms. A rigid bar with a rotational spring on one end and a point mass on the other end (the tip) models the springboard. Board tip mass, length, and stiffness are functions of the fulcrum setting. Body segments and board tip are connected by frictionless hinge joints and are driven by joint torque actuators at the ankle, knee, and hip. One constant (maximum isometric torque) and three variable functions (of instantaneous joint angle, angular velocity, and activation level) determine each joint torque. Movement from a nearly straight motionless initial posture to jump takeoff is simulated. The objective is to find joint torque activation patterns during board contact so that jump height can be maximized. Minimum and maximum joint angles, rates of change of normalized activation levels, and contact duration are constrained. Optimal springboard jumping simulations can reasonably predict jumper vertical velocity and jump height. Qualitatively similar joint torque activation patterns are found over different fulcrum settings. Different from rigid-surface jumping where maximal activation is maintained until takeoff, joint activation decreases near takeoff in compliant-surface jumping. The fulcrum-height relations in experimental data were predicted by the models. However, lack of practice at non-preferred fulcrum settings might have caused less jump height than the models' prediction. Larger fulcrum numbers are beneficial for taller/heavier jumpers because they need more time to extend joints.\n\nMeasurements of K shell absorption jump factors and jump ratios using EDXRF technique\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKacal, Mustafa Recep; Han, Ä°brahim; Akman, Ferdi\n\n2015-04-01\n\nIn the present work, the K-shell absorption jump factors and jump ratios for 30 elements between Ti ( Z = 22) and Er ( Z = 68) were measured by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) technique.
