Currently the mission architecture comprises 25 spacecraft, 24 as optics modules and one as the detector, which will form sparse sub-apertures of a grazing incidence X-ray interferometer covering the 0.3-10 keV bandpass. This formation must allow for long duration continuous science observations and also for reconfiguration that permits re-pointing of the formation. To achieve these mission goals, the formation is required to cooperatively point at desired targets. Once pointed, the individual elements of the MAXIM formation must remain stable, maintaining their relative positions and attitudes below a critical threshold. These pointing and formation stability requirements impact the control and design of the formation. In this paper, we provide analysis of control efforts that are dependent upon the stability and the configuration and dimensions of the MAXIM formation. We emphasize the utilization of natural motions in the Lagrangian regions to minimize the control efforts and we address continuous control via input feedback linearization (IFL). Results provide control cost, configuration options, and capabilities as guidelines for the development of this complex mission.\n\nMinimum Propellant Low-Thrust Maneuvers near the Libration Points\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMarinescu, A.; Dumitrache, M.\n\nThe impulse technique certainly can bring the vehicle on orbits around the libration points or close to them. The question that aries is, by what means can the vehicle arrive in such cases at the libration points? A first investigation carried out in this paper can give an answer: the use of the technique of low-thrust, which, in addition, can bring the vehicle from the libration points near to or into orbits around these points. This aspect is considered in this present paper where for the applications we have considered the transfer for orbits of the equidistant point L4 and of the collinear point L2, from Earth-moon system. This transfer maneuver can be used to insertion one satellite on libration points orbits. In Earth- moon system the points L 4 and L 5 because an vehicle in on of the equidistant points in quite stable and remains in its vicinity of perturbed, have potential interest for the establishment of transporder satellite for interplanetary tracking. In contrast an vehicle in one of the collinear points is quite instable and it will oscillate along the Earth-moon-axis at increasing amplitude and gradually escape from the libration point. Let use assume that a space vehicle equipped with a low-thrust propulsion is near a libration point L. We consider the planar motion in the restricted frame of the three bodies in the rotating system L, where the Earth-moon distance D=l. The unit of time T is period of the moon's orbit divided by 2 and multiplied by the square root of the quantity one plus the moon/Earth mass ratio, and the unit of mass is the Earth's mass. With these predictions the motion equatios of the vehicle equiped with a low-thrust propulsion installation in the linear approximation near the libration point, have been established. The parameters of the motion at the beginning and the end of these maneuvers are known, the variational problem has been formulated as a Lagrange type problem with fixed extremities. On established the differential\n\nFlights between a neighborhoods of unstable libration points of Sun-Earth system\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSurkova, Valerya; Shmyrov, Vasily\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn this paper we study the problem of constructing impulse flights between neighborhoods of unstable collinear libration points of the Sun-Earth system [1]. Such maneuvering in near-Earth space may prove to be in demand in modern space navigation. For example, such a maneuvering was done by the space vehicle GENESIS. Three test points are chosen for the implementation of the impulse control, in order to move to a neighborhood of the libration point L2. It is shown that the earlier on the exit from the vicinity of the libration point L1 impulse control was realized, the sooner the neighborhood L2 was achieved. Separated from this problem, the problem of optimal control in the neighborhood of L2 was considered and a form of stabilizing control is presented.\n\nUse of libration-point orbits for space observatories\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFarquhar, Robert W.; Dunham, David W.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe sun-earth libration points, L1 and L2, are located 1.5 million kilometers from the earth toward and away from the sun. Halo orbits about these points have significant advantages for space observatories in terms of viewing geometry, thermal and radiation environment, and delta-V expediture.\n\nInclined asymmetric librations in exterior resonances\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVoyatzis, G.; Tsiganis, K.; Antoniadou, K. I.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nLibrational motion in Celestial Mechanics is generally associated with the existence of stable resonant configurations and signified by the existence of stable periodic solutions and oscillation of critical (resonant) angles. When such an oscillation takes place around a value different than 0 or Ï , the libration is called asymmetric. In the context of the planar circular restricted three-body problem, asymmetric librations have been identified for the exterior mean motion resonances (MMRs) 1:2, 1:3, etc., as well as for co-orbital motion (1:1). In exterior MMRs the massless body is the outer one. In this paper, we study asymmetric librations in the three-dimensional space. We employ the computational approach of Markellos (Mon Not R Astron Soc 184:273-281, https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/184.2.273, 1978) and compute families of asymmetric periodic orbits and their stability. Stable asymmetric periodic orbits are surrounded in phase space by domains of initial conditions which correspond to stable evolution and librating resonant angles. Our computations were focused on the spatial circular restricted three-body model of the Sun-Neptune-TNO system (TNO = trans-Neptunian object). We compare our results with numerical integrations of observed TNOs, which reveal that some of them perform 1:2 resonant, inclined asymmetric librations. For the stable 1:2 TNO librators, we find that their libration seems to be related to the vertically stable planar asymmetric orbits of our model, rather than the three-dimensional ones found in the present study.\n\nThe research of the coupled orbital-attitude controlled motion of celestial body in the neighborhood of the collinear libration point L1\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShmyrov, A.; Shmyrov, V.; Shymanchuk, D.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThis article considers the motion of a celestial body within the restricted three-body problem of the Sun-Earth system. The equations of controlled coupled attitude-orbit motion in the neighborhood of collinear libration point L1 are investigated. The translational orbital motion of a celestial body is described using Hill's equations of circular restricted three-body problem of the Sun-Earth system. Rotational orbital motion is described using Euler's dynamic equations and quaternion kinematic equation. We investigate the problem of stability of celestial body rotational orbital motion in relative equilibrium positions and stabilization of celestial body rotational orbital motion with proposed control laws in the neighborhood of collinear libration point L1. To study stabilization problem, Lyapunov function is constructed in the form of the sum of the kinetic energy and special \"kinematic function\" of the Rodriguez-Hamiltonian parameters. Numerical modeling of the controlled rotational motion of a celestial body at libration point L1 is carried out. The numerical characteristics of the control parameters and rotational motion are given.\n\nLibration-driven flows in ellipsoidal shells\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLemasquerier, D.; Grannan, A. M.; Vidal, J.; CÃ©bron, D.; Favier, B.; Le Bars, M.; Aurnou, J. M.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nPlanets and satellites can undergo physical librations, which consist of forced periodic variations in their rotation rate induced by gravitational interactions with nearby bodies. This mechanical forcing may drive turbulence in interior fluid layers such as subsurface oceans and metallic liquid cores through a libration-driven elliptical instability (LDEI) that refers to the resonance of two inertial modes with the libration-induced base flow. LDEI has been studied in the case of a full ellipsoid. Here we address for the first time the question of the persistence of LDEI in the more geophysically relevant ellipsoidal shell geometries. In the experimental setup, an ellipsoidal container with spherical inner cores of different sizes is filled with water. Direct side view flow visualizations are made in the librating frame using Kalliroscope particles. A Fourier analysis of the light intensity fluctuations extracted from recorded movies shows that the presence of an inner core leads to spatial heterogeneities but does not prevent LDEI. Particle image velocimetry and direct numerical simulations are performed on selected cases to confirm our results. Additionally, our survey at a fixed forcing frequency and variable rotation period (i.e., variable Ekman number, E) shows that the libration amplitude at the instability threshold varies as ËE0.65. This scaling is explained by a competition between surface and bulk dissipation. When extrapolating to planetary interior conditions, this leads to the E1/2 scaling commonly considered. We argue that Enceladus' subsurface ocean and the core of the exoplanet 55 CnC e should both be unstable to LDEI.\n\nDesign of the stabilizing control of the orbital motion in the vicinity of the collinear libration point L1 using the analytical representation of the invariant manifold\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMaliavkin, G. P.; Shmyrov, A. S.; Shmyrov, V. A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nVicinities of collinear libration points of the Sun-Earth system are currently quite attractive for the space navigation. Today, various projects on placing of spacecrafts observing the Sun in the L1 libration point and telescopes in L2 have been implemented (e.g. spacecrafts \"WIND\", \"SOHO\", \"Herschel\", \"Planck\"). Collinear libration points being unstable leads to the problem of stabilization of a spacecraft's motion. Laws of stabilizing motion control in vicinity of L1 point can be constructed using the analytical representation of a stable invariant manifold. Efficiency of these control laws depends on the precision of the representation. Within the model of Hill's approximation of the circular restricted three-body problem in the rotating geocentric coordinate system one can obtain the analytical representation of an invariant manifold filled with bounded trajectories in a form of series in terms of powers of the phase variables. Approximate representations of the orders from the first to the fourth inclusive can be used to construct four laws of stabilizing feedback motion control under which trajectories approach the manifold. By virtue of numerical simulation the comparison can be made: how the precision of the representation of the invariant manifold influences the efficiency of the control, expressed by energy consumptions (characteristic velocity). It shows that using approximations of higher orders in constructing the control laws can significantly reduce the energy consumptions on implementing the control compared to the linear approximation.\n\nLibration-Driven Elliptical Instability Experiments in Ellipsoidal Shells\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrannan, A. M.; Lemasquerier, D. G.; Favier, B.; Cebron, D.; Le Bars, M.; Aurnou, J. M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nPlanets and satellites can be subjected to physical libration, which consists in forced periodic variations in their rotation rate induced by gravitational interactions with nearby bodies. These librations may mechanically drive turbulence in interior liquid layers such as subsurface oceans and metallic liquid cores. One possible driving-process is called the Libration-Driven Elliptical Instability (LDEI) and refers to the resonance of two inertial modes with the libration induced base flow. LDEI has been experimentally and numerically studied in the case of a full ellipsoid (e.g. CÃ©bron et al. [2012c], Grannan et al. [2014] and Favier et al. [2015]). In this study, we address the question of the persistence of the LDEI in the theoretically complex case of an ellipsoidal shell which is more geophysically relevant to model planetary liquid layers. We use an ellipsoidal acrylic container filled with water and add spherical inner cores of different sizes. We perform direct side-view visualizations of the flow in the librating frame using Kalliroscope particles. A Fourier analysis of the light intensity extracted from the recorded movies shows that LDEI persists in a shell geometry for a libration frequency which is 4 and 2.4 time the rotation rate, and allows an identification of the mode coupling. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is performed in vertical and horizontal planes on a selected case to confirm our light intensity results. Additionaly, our survey at a fixed forcing-frequency and variable Ekman number (E) allows a comparison with a local stability analysis, and shows that the libration amplitude at the threshold of the instability varies as â[E0.63, E0.72]. When extrapolating to planetary interiors conditions, such a scaling leads to an easier excitation of the elliptical instability than the E0.5 scaling commonly considered.\n\nDevelopment of analytical theory of the physical libration for a two-layer Moon\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPetrova, Natalia; Barkin, Yurii; Gusev, Alexander; Ivanova, Tamara\n\n2010-05-01\n\nInvestigation is being carried out in the frame of Russian-Japanese grant and directed onto providing of the future observations in the frame of the ILOM-project which is planned onto the end of the second decade. The analytical theory presents both scientific interest in its own right and can be useful as a base for the lunar annual in a future, as a clue to lunar interiors and to processes inside the lunar body. A comparison of the libration's analytical theory with new observations will allow to refine the parameters of lunar interiors: an existence or absence of a core, its size, composition and state of aggregation, Love numbers, qualitative parameter Q, etc. Contrary to the usual application of numerical libration models for analyses of observations, the analytical model is able to predict the new harmonics, early unknown and not observed (owing to the insufficient accuracy of observations) in libration's series of observations. As part of the investigation the following results were achieved. Development of the analytical theory of the Lunar Physical Libration (LPhL) were performed using the Poisson Series Processor (PSP). The base solution is realized for the 'main problem' of the LPhL in view of 4-th harmonic of selenopotential. Data on a dynamical figure of the Moon are incorporated in the theory on the basis of new observations of the Lunar gravitational field, received in a frame of space projects Clementine (1994, NASA), Lunar Prospector (1999, NASA) and the SELENE (2007 - 2009, Japan). On the basis of the constructed theory the following actions were done: 1) analyses of the present dynamical models; 2) modeling of stars trajectories in the field of view of the future optical telescope, which is planned to be placed on one of the Lunar poles in the second stage of the Japanese project SELENE-B - ILOM. Results of modeling have shown opportunities of determination of LPhL-parameters with the desirable accuracy 0.001 arc seconds planned in the ILOM\n\nEarly Mission Maneuver Operations for the Deep Space Climate Observatory Sun-Earth L1 Libration Point Mission\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRoberts, Craig; Case, Sara; Reagoso, John; Webster, Cassandra\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Deep Space Climate Observatory mission launched on February 11, 2015, and inserted onto a transfer trajectory toward a Lissajous orbit around the Sun-Earth L1 libration point. This paper presents an overview of the baseline transfer orbit and early mission maneuver operations leading up to the start of nominal science orbit operations. In particular, the analysis and performance of the spacecraft insertion, mid-course correction maneuvers, and the deep-space Lissajous orbit insertion maneuvers are discussed, com-paring the baseline orbit with actual mission results and highlighting mission and operations constraints..\n\nUltrafast Librational Relaxation of H2O in Liquid Water\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPetersen, Jakob; MÃ¸ller, Klaus Braagaard; Rey, Rossend\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe ultrafast librational (hindered rotational) relaxation of a rotationally excited H2O molecule in pure liquid water is investigated by means of classical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and a power and work analysis. This analysis allows the mechanism of the energy transfer from...... the excited H2O to its water neighbors, which occurs on a sub-100 fs time scale, to be followed in molecular detail, i.e., to determine which water molecules receive the energy and in which degrees of freedom. It is found that the dominant energy flow is to the four hydrogen-bonded water partners in the first...\n\nOn fluid flow driven by topography in a librating body\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWu, C.; Roberts, P. H.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nCurrently considerable effort and resources are being devoted to studies of Mercury, the Moon and Europa. Measuring the libration of these bodies can provide significant knowledge about their internal structures and physical properties; see Williams et al., 2001, Peale et al., 2002, Wu et al., 2007. To interpret such observations, it is important to understand better how libration affects the motion of the fluid in their interiors. To this end, Noir et al. (2009) investigated, via laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, the flow in a fluid filling a rotating spherical cavity driven by an axial oscillation of the container about a diameter. More realistically, the cavity is better represented by a triaxial ellipsoid. We may then distinguish between topographic and axisymmetricli libration. The latter refers to libration about a symmetry axis of the container which is therefore only viscously coupled to the fluid. In topographic libration, pressure forces on the boundary also affect the fluid motions in the cavity. We describe results from preliminary studies of topographic libration obtained through numerical simulation of incompressible fluid motion in an oblate spheroidal cavity with a libration axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the container. The computer code is a modification of one recently developed to study precessionally-driven flows in a spheroidal body of fluid (Wu and Roberts, 2009). It advances the flow in time using finite differences on overlapping grids; in this way the numerical difficulty known as the pole problem, is completely avoided.\n\nDynamics and mission design near libration points\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGÃ³mez, G; Jorba, A; Masdemont, J\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe aim of this book is to explain, analyze and compute the kinds of motions that appear in an extended vicinity of the geometrically defined equilateral points of the Earth-Moon system, as a source of possible nominal orbits for future space missions. The methodology developed here is not specific to astrodynamics problems. The techniques are developed in such a way that they can be used to study problems that can be modeled by dynamical systems. Contents: Global Stability Zones Around the Triangular Libration Points; The Normal Form Around L 5 in the Three-dimensional RTBP; Normal Form of th\n\nTides in a body librating about a spin-orbit resonance: generalisation of the Darwin-Kaula theory\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFrouard, Julien; Efroimsky, Michael\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe Darwin-Kaula theory of bodily tides is intended for celestial bodies rotating without libration. We demonstrate that this theory, in its customary form, is inapplicable to a librating body. Specifically, in the presence of libration in longitude, the actual spectrum of Fourier tidal modes differs from the conventional spectrum rendered by the Darwin-Kaula theory for a nonlibrating celestial object. This necessitates derivation of formulae for the tidal torque and the tidal heating rate, that are applicable under libration. We derive the tidal spectrum for longitudinal forced libration with one and two main frequencies, generalisation to more main frequencies being straightforward. (By main frequencies we understand those emerging due to the triaxiality of the librating body.) Separately, we consider a case of free libration at one frequency (once again, generalisation to more frequencies being straightforward). We also calculate the tidal torque. This torque provides correction to the triaxiality-caused physical libration. Our theory is not self-consistent: we assume that the tidal torque is much smaller than the permanent-triaxiality-caused torque, so the additional libration due to tides is much weaker than the main libration due to the permanent triaxiality. Finally, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate in a body experiencing forced libration at the main mode, or free libration at one frequency, or superimposed forced and free librations.\n\nTwo-craft Coulomb formation study about circular orbits and libration points\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nInampudi, Ravi Kishore\n\nThis dissertation investigates the dynamics and control of a two-craft Coulomb formation in circular orbits and at libration points; it addresses relative equilibria, stability and optimal reconfigurations of such formations. The relative equilibria of a two-craft tether formation connected by line-of-sight elastic forces moving in circular orbits and at libration points are investigated. In circular Earth orbits and Earth-Moon libration points, the radial, along-track, and orbit normal great circle equilibria conditions are found. An example of modeling the tether force using Coulomb force is discussed. Furthermore, the non-great-circle equilibria conditions for a two-spacecraft tether structure in circular Earth orbit and at collinear libration points are developed. Then the linearized dynamics and stability analysis of a 2-craft Coulomb formation at Earth-Moon libration points are studied. For orbit-radial equilibrium, Coulomb forces control the relative distance between the two satellites. The gravity gradient torques on the formation due to the two planets help stabilize the formation. Similar analysis is performed for along-track and orbit-normal relative equilibrium configurations. Where necessary, the craft use a hybrid thrusting-electrostatic actuation system. The two-craft dynamics at the libration points provide a general framework with circular Earth orbit dynamics forming a special case. In the presence of differential solar drag perturbations, a Lyapunov feedback controller is designed to stabilize a radial equilibrium, two-craft Coulomb formation at collinear libration points. The second part of the thesis investigates optimal reconfigurations of two-craft Coulomb formations in circular Earth orbits by applying nonlinear optimal control techniques. The objective of these reconfigurations is to maneuver the two-craft formation between two charged equilibria configurations. The reconfiguration of spacecraft is posed as an optimization problem using the\n\nLow-temperature matrix effects on orientational motion of Methyl radical trapped in gas solids: Angular tunneling vs. libration\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDmitriev, Yurij A.; Zelenetckii, Ilia A.; Benetis, Nikolas P.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nEPR investigation of the lineshape of matrix -isolated methyl radical, CH3, spectra recorded in solid N2O and CO2 was carried out. Reversible temperature-dependent line width anisotropy was observed in both matrices. This effect is a fingerprint of the extra-slow radical rotation about the in-plane C2 axes. The rotation was found to be anisotropic and closely correlated to the orientational dynamics of the matrix molecules. It was suggested that a recently discovered \"hoping precession\" effect of matrix molecules in solid CO2 is a common feature of matrices of the linear molecules CO, N2O, and CO2. A new low-temperature matrix effect, referred to as \"libration trap\", was proposed which accounts for the changing CH3 reorientational motion about the radical C3-axis from rotation to libration. Temperature dependence of the intensity of the EPR satellites produced by these nonrotating-but librating methyls was presented. This allowed for a rough estimation of the rotation hindering potential due to correlation mismatch between the radical and the nearest matrix molecules' librations.\n\nInertial Waves and Steady Flows in a Liquid Filled Librating Cylinder\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSubbotin, Stanislav; Dyakova, Veronika\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe fluid flow in a non-uniformly rotating (librating) cylinder about a horizontal axis is experimentally studied. In the absence of librations the fluid performs a solid-body rotation together with the cavity. Librations lead to the appearance of steady zonal flow in the whole cylinder and the intensive steady toroidal flows near the cavity corners. If the frequency of librations is twice lower than the mean rotation rate the inertial waves are excited. The oscillating motion associated with the propagation of inertial wave in the fluid bulk leads to the appearance of an additional steady flow in the Stokes boundary layers on the cavity side wall. In this case the heavy particles of the visualizer are assembled on the side wall into ring structures. The patterns are determined by the structure of steady flow, which in turn depends on the number of reflections of inertial wave beams from the cavity side wall. For some frequencies, inertial waves experience spatial resonance, resulting in inertial modes, which are eigenmodes of the cavity geometry. The resonance of the inertial modes modifies the steady flow structure close to the boundary layer that is manifested in the direct rebuilding of patterns. It is shown that the intensity of zonal flow, as well as the intensity of steady flows excited by inertial waves, is proportional to the square of the amplitude of librations.\n\nComputer simulating observations of the Lunar physical libration for the Japanese Lunar project ILOM\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPetrova, Natalia; Hanada, Hideo\n\n2010-05-01\n\nIn the frame of the second stage of the Japanese space mission SELENE-2 (Hanada et al. 2009) the project ILOM (In-situ Lunar Orientation Measurement) planned after 2017years is a kind of instrument for positioning on the Moon. It will be set near the lunar pole and will determine parameters of lunar physical libration by positioning of several tens of stars in the field of view regularly for longer than one year. Presented work is dedicated to analyses of computer simulating future observations. It's proposed that for every star crossing lunar prime meridian its polar distance will be to measure. The methods of optimal star observation are being developed for the future experiment. The equations are constructed to determine libration angles ? (t),Ï(t),Ï(t)- on the basis of observed polar distances pobs: (| f1(?,Ï,IÏ,pobs) = 0 |{ f2(?,Ï,IÏ,pobs) = 0 | f3(?,Ï,IÏ,pobs) = 0 |( or f(X) = 0, where ; f = ? f1 ? | f2 | |? f3 |? X = ? ? ? | Ï | |? IÏ |? (1) At the present stage we have developed the software for selection of stars for these future polar observations. Stars were taken from various stellar catalogues, such as the UCAC2-BSS, Hipparcos, Tycho and FK6. The software reduces ICRS coordinates of star to selenographical system at the epoch of observation (Petrova et al., 2009). For example, to the epochs 2017 - 2018 more than 50 stars brighter than m = 12 were selected for the northern pole. In total, these stars give about 600 crossings of the prime meridian during one year. Nevertheless, only a few stars (2-5) may be observed in a vicinity of the one moment. This is not enough to have sufficient sample to exclude various kind of errors. The software includes programmes which can determine the moment of transition of star across the meridian and theoretical values of libration angles at this moments. A serious problem arises when we try to solve equations (1) with the purpose to determine libration angles on the basis of simulated pobs..

Hence, it is important to understand the transformation of water properties, such as hydrogen-bonding, intermolecular vibrational coupling, and librational freedom in the hydration shell of ions. We investigated these properties in the hydration shell of mono- (Cl(-) and I(-)) and bivalent (SO4(2-) and CO3(2-)) anions by using Raman multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR) spectroscopy in the OH stretch, HOH bend, and [bend+librational] combination bands of water. Raman-MCR of aqueous Na-salt (NaCl, NaI, Na2SO4, and Na2CO3) solutions provides ion-correlated spectra (IC-spectrum) which predominantly bear the vibrational characteristics of water in the hydration shell of respective anions. Comparison of these IC-spectra with the Raman spectrum of bulk water in different spectral regions reveals that the water is vibrationally decoupled with its neighbors in the hydration shell. Hydrogen-bond strength and librational freedom also vary with the nature of anion: hydrogen-bond strength, for example, decreases as CO3(2-) > SO4(2-) > bulk water â Cl(-) > I(-); and the librational freedom increases as CO3(2-) â SO4(2-) water water in the hydration shell of anions.\n\nUnderstanding the Sun-Earth Libration Point Orbit Formation Flying Challenges For WFIRST and Starshade\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWebster, Cassandra M.; Folta, David C.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn order to fly an occulter in formation with a telescope at the Sun-Earth L2 (SEL2) Libration Point, one must have a detailed understanding of the dy-namics that govern the restricted three body system. For initial purposes, a linear approximation is satisfactory, but operations will require a high-fidelity modeling tool along with strategic targeting methods in order to be successful. This paper focuses on the challenging dynamics of the transfer trajectories to achieve the relative positioning of two spacecraft to fly in formation at SEL2, in our case, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and a proposed Starshade. By modeling the formation transfers using a high fidelity tool, an accurate V approximation can be made to as-sist with the development of the subsystem design required for a WFIRST and Starshade formation flight mission.\n\nSolar radiation pressure application for orbital motion stabilization near the Sun-Earth collinear libration point\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPolyakhova, Elena; Shmyrov, Alexander; Shmyrov, Vasily\n\n2018-05-01\n\nOrbital maneuvering in a neighborhood of the collinear libration point L1 of Sun-Earth system has specific properties, primarily associated with the instability L1. For a long stay in this area of space the stabilization problem of orbital motion requires a solution. Numerical experiments have shown that for stabilization of motion it is requires very small control influence in comparison with the gravitational forces. On the other hand, the stabilization time is quite long - months, and possibly years. This makes it highly desirable to use solar pressure forces. In this paper we illustrate the solar sail possibilities for solving of stabilization problem in a neighborhood L1 with use of the model example.\n\nLarge longitude libration of Mercury reveals a molten core.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMargot, J L; Peale, S J; Jurgens, R F; Slade, M A; Holin, I V\n\n2007-05-04\n\nObservations of radar speckle patterns tied to the rotation of Mercury establish that the planet occupies a Cassini state with obliquity of 2.11 +/- 0.1 arc minutes. The measurements show that the planet exhibits librations in longitude that are forced at the 88-day orbital period, as predicted by theory. The large amplitude of the oscillations, 35.8 +/- 2 arc seconds, together with the Mariner 10 determination of the gravitational harmonic coefficient C22, indicates that the mantle of Mercury is decoupled from a core that is at least partially molten.\n\nEffect of catalogues coordinate errors of a star onto determination of the physical libration of the Moon from the observations of stars\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPetrova, Natalia; Kocoulin, Valerii; Nefediev, Yurii\n\n2016-07-01\n\nIn the Kazan University computer simulation is carried out for observation of lunar physical libration in projects planned installation of measuring equipment on the lunar surface. One such project is the project of ILOM (Japan), in which on the lunar pole an optical telescope with CCD will be equipped. As a result, the determining the selenographic coordinates (x and y) of a star with an accuracy of 1 ms of arc will be achieved. On the basis of the analytical theory of physical libration we developed a technique for solving the inverse problem of the libration. And we have already shown, for example, that the error in determining selenographic coordinates about É seconds does not lead to errors in the determination of the libration angles Ï and IÏ larger than the 1.414É. Libration in longitude is not determined from observations of the polar star (Petrova et al., 2012). The accuracy of the libration in the inverse problem depends on accuracy of the coordinates of the stars - Î± and Î´ - taken from the star catalogs. Checking this influence is the task of the present study. To do simulation we have developed that allows to choose the stars, falling in the field of view of the lunar telescope on observation period. Equatorial coordinates of stars were chosen by us from several fundamental catalogs: UCAC2-BSS, Hipparcos, Tycho, FK6 (part I, III) and the Astronomical Almanac. An analysis of these catalogues from the point of view accuracy of coordinates of stars represented in them was performed by Nefediev et al., 2013. The largest error, 20-70 ms, found in the catalogues UCAC2 and Tycho, the others have an error about a millisecond of arc. We simulated the observations with mentioned errors and got the following results. 1. The error in the declination ÎÎ´ of the star causes the same order error in libration parameters Ï and IÏ , while the sensitivity of libration to errors in ÎÎ± is ten time smaller. Fortunately, due to statistics (30 to 70, depending on\n\nApplying Dynamical Systems Theory to Optimize Libration Point Orbit Stationkeeping Maneuvers for WIND\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBrown, Jonathan M.; Petersen, Jeremy D.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nNASA's WIND mission has been operating in a large amplitude Lissajous orbit in the vicinity of the interior libration point of the Sun-Earth/Moon system since 2004. Regular stationkeeping maneuvers are required to maintain the orbit due to the instability around the collinear libration points. Historically these stationkeeping maneuvers have been performed by applying an incremental change in velocity, or (delta)v along the spacecraft-Sun vector as projected into the ecliptic plane. Previous studies have shown that the magnitude of libration point stationkeeping maneuvers can be minimized by applying the (delta)v in the direction of the local stable manifold found using dynamical systems theory. This paper presents the analysis of this new maneuver strategy which shows that the magnitude of stationkeeping maneuvers can be decreased by 5 to 25 percent, depending on the location in the orbit where the maneuver is performed. The implementation of the optimized maneuver method into operations is discussed and results are presented for the first two optimized stationkeeping maneuvers executed by WIND.\n\nModeling low-thrust transfers between periodic orbits about five libration points: Manifolds and hierarchical design\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZeng, Hao; Zhang, Jingrui\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe low-thrust version of the fuel-optimal transfers between periodic orbits with different energies in the vicinity of five libration points is exploited deeply in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. Indirect optimization technique incorporated with constraint gradients is employed to further improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm. The required optimal thrust magnitude and direction can be determined to create the bridging trajectory that connects the invariant manifolds. A hierarchical design strategy dividing the constraint set is proposed to seek the optimal solution when the problem cannot be solved directly. Meanwhile, the solution procedure and the value ranges of used variables are summarized. To highlight the effectivity of the transfer scheme and aim at different types of libration point orbits, transfer trajectories between some sample orbits, including Lyapunov orbits, planar orbits, halo orbits, axial orbits, vertical orbits and butterfly orbits for collinear and triangular libration points, are investigated with various time of flight. Numerical results show that the fuel consumption varies from a few kilograms to tens of kilograms, related to the locations and the types of mission orbits as well as the corresponding invariant manifold structures, and indicates that the low-thrust transfers may be a beneficial option for the extended science missions around different libration points.\n\nElectron spin control and spin-libration coupling of a levitated nanodiamond\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHoang, Thai; Ma, Yue; Ahn, Jonghoon; Bang, Jaehoon; Robicheaux, Francis; Gong, Ming; Yin, Zhang-Qi; Li, Tongcang\n\n2017-04-01\n\nHybrid spin-mechanical systems have great potentials in sensing, macroscopic quantum mechanics, and quantum information science. Recently, we optically levitated a nanodiamond and demonstrated electron spin control of its built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in vacuum. We also observed the libration (torsional vibration) of a nanodiamond trapped by a linearly polarized laser beam in vacuum. We propose to achieve strong coupling between the electron spin of a NV center and the libration of a levitated nanodiamond with a uniform magnetic field. With a uniform magnetic field, multiple spins can couple to the torsional vibration at the same time. We propose to use this strong coupling to realize the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model and generate rotational superposition states.

The main focus is on orbits near halo ones in the (Earth+Moon)-Sun system. Taking as starting point the restricted three-body problem, the motion in the full solar system is considered as a perturbation of this simplified model. All the study is done with enough generality to allow easy application to other primary-secondary systems as a simple extension of the analytical and numerical computations.

In 2009, two of the five THEMIS spacecraft were redeployed from Earth-centered orbits to arrive in Earth-Moon Lissajous orbits in late 2010. Starting in August 2010, the ARTEMIS P1 spacecraft executed numerous stationkeeping maneuvers, initially maintaining a lunar L2 Lissajous orbit before transitioning into a lunar L1 orbit. The ARTEMIS P2 spacecraft entered a L1 Lissajous orbit in October 2010. In April 2011, both ARTEMIS spacecraft will suspend Lissajous stationkeeping and will be maneuvered into lunar orbits. The success of the ARTEMIS mission has allowed the science team to gather unprecedented magnetospheric measurements in the lunar Lissajous regions. In order to effectively perform lunar Lissajous stationkeeping maneuvers, the ARTEMIS operations team has provided orbit determination solutions with typical accuracies on the order of 0.1 km in position and 0.1 cm/s in velocity. The ARTEMIS team utilizes the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS), using a batch least squares method, to process range and Doppler tracking measurements from the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN), Berkeley Ground Station (BGS), Merritt Island (MILA) station, and United Space Network (USN). The team has also investigated processing of the same tracking data measurements using the Orbit Determination Tool Kit (ODTK) software, which uses an extended Kalman filter and recursive smoother to estimate the orbit. The orbit determination results from each of these methods will be presented and we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages associated with using each method in the lunar Lissajous regions. Orbit determination accuracy is dependent on both the quality and quantity of tracking measurements, fidelity of the orbit force models, and the estimation techniques used. Prior to Lissajous operations, the team determined the appropriate quantity of tracking\n\nThe maximal U(1){sub L} inverse seesaw from d = 5 operator and oscillating asymmetric Sneutrino dark matter\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKang, Zhaofeng [Korea Institute for Advanced Study, School of Physics, Seoul (Korea, Republic of); Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Frontiers in Theoretical Physics, Beijing (China); Li, Jinmian [Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Frontiers in Theoretical Physics, Beijing (China); University of Adelaide, ARC Centre of Excellence for Particle Physics at the Terascale and CSSM, Department of Physics, Adelaide, SA (Australia); Li, Tianjun [Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Frontiers in Theoretical Physics, Beijing (China); University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, School of Physical Electronics, Chengdu (China); Liu, Tao [University of Alberta, Department of Physics, Edmonton, Alberta (Canada); Yang, Jin Min [Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Frontiers in Theoretical Physics, Beijing (China)\n\n2016-05-15\n\nThe maximal U(1){sub L} supersymmetric inverse seesaw mechanism (MLSIS) provides a natural way to relate asymmetric darkmatter (ADM)with neutrino physics. In this paper we point out that MLSIS is a natural outcome if one dynamically realizes the inverse seesaw mechanism in the next-to minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) via the dimension-five operator (N){sup 2}S{sup 2}/M{sub *}, with S the NMSSM singlet developing TeV scale VEV; it slightly violates lepton number due to the suppression by the fundamental scale M{sub *}, thus preserving U(1){sub L} maximally. The resulting sneutrino is a distinguishable ADM candidate, oscillating and favored to have weak scale mass. A fairly large annihilating cross section of such a heavy ADM is available due to the presence of singlet.

The shell globally rotates with angular velocity {Omega}. A further periodic oscillation with angular velocity 0 Less-Than-Or-Slanted-Equal-To {omega} Less-Than-Or-Slanted-Equal-To 2{Omega}, a so-called longitudinal libration, is added on the inner sphere's rotation. The primary response is inertial waves spawned at the critical latitudes on the inner sphere, and propagating throughout the shell along inclined characteristics. For sufficiently large libration amplitudes, the higher harmonics also become important. Those harmonics whose frequencies are still less than 2{Omega} behave as inertial waves themselves, propagating along their own characteristics. The steady component of the flow consists of a prograde zonal jet on the cylinder tangent to the inner sphere and parallel to the axis of rotation, and increases with decreasing Ekman number. The jet becomes unstable for larger forcing amplitudes as can be deduced from the preliminary particle image velocimetry observations. Finally, a wave attractor is experimentally detected in the spherical shell as the pattern of largest variance. These findings are reproduced in a two-dimensional numerical investigation of the flow, and certain aspects can be studied numerically in greater detail. One aspect is the scaling of the width of the inertial shear layers and the width of the steady jet. Another is the partitioning of the kinetic energy between the forced wave, its harmonics and the mean flow. Finally, the numerical simulations allow for an investigation of instabilities, too local to be found experimentally. For strong libration amplitudes, the boundary layer on the inner sphere becomes unstable, triggering localized Goertler vortices during the prograde phase of the forcing. This instability is important for the transition to turbulence of the spherical shell flow.

It demonstrates an interesting extension to existing communication methods to the Moon and beyond by combining innovative technology with a next frontier location and the commercial space communication sector. It is evident that all communication systems will rely on direct communication to Earth ground stations. In case of EML-2 missions around HALO orbits or bases on the far side of the Moon, it has to be extended by communication links via relay stations. The innovative approach is that TYCHO provides this relay communication to those out-of-sight lunar missions as a service. TYCHO will establish a new infrastructure for future missions and even create a new market for add-on relay services. The TMA-0 satellite is TYCHO's first phase and a proposed demonstrator mission to the Earth-Moon Libration point EML-4. It demonstrates relay services needed for automated exploratory and manned missions (Moon bases) on the rim (>90Â°E and >90Â°W) and far side surface, to lunar orbits and even to EML-2 halo orbits (satellites and space stations). Its main advantage is the permanent availability of communication coverage. This will provide full access to scientific and telemetry data and furthermore to crucial medical monitoring and safety. The communication subsystem is a platform for conventional communication but also a test-bed for optical communication with high data-rate LASER links to serve the future needs of manned bases and periodic burst data-transfer from lunar poles. The operational TMA-1 satellite is a stand-alone mission integrated into existing space communication networks to provide open communication service to external lunar missions. Therefore the long-time stable libration points EML-4 and -5 are selected to guarantee an\n\nDeveloping maximal neuromuscular power: part 2 - training considerations for improving maximal power production.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCormie, Prue; McGuigan, Michael R; Newton, Robert U\n\n2011-02-01\n\nThis series of reviews focuses on the most important neuromuscular function in many sport performances: the ability to generate maximal muscular power. Part 1, published in an earlier issue of Sports Medicine, focused on the factors that affect maximal power production while part 2 explores the practical application of these findings by reviewing the scientific literature relevant to the development of training programmes that most effectively enhance maximal power production. The ability to generate maximal power during complex motor skills is of paramount importance to successful athletic performance across many sports. A crucial issue faced by scientists and coaches is the development of effective and efficient training programmes that improve maximal power production in dynamic, multi-joint movements. Such training is referred to as 'power training' for the purposes of this review. Although further research is required in order to gain a deeper understanding of the optimal training techniques for maximizing power in complex, sports-specific movements and the precise mechanisms underlying adaptation, several key conclusions can be drawn from this review. First, a fundamental relationship exists between strength and power, which dictates that an individual cannot possess a high level of power without first being relatively strong. Thus, enhancing and maintaining maximal strength is essential when considering the long-term development of power. Second, consideration of movement pattern, load and velocity specificity is essential when designing power training programmes. Ballistic, plyometric and weightlifting exercises can be used effectively as primary exercises within a power training programme that enhances maximal power. The loads applied to these exercises will depend on the specific requirements of each particular sport and the type of movement being trained. The use of ballistic exercises with loads ranging from 0% to 50% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) and\n\nThe influence of large-amplitude librational motion on the hydrogen bond energy for alcoholâwater complexes\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAndersen, Jonas; Heimdal, J.; Larsen, RenÃ© Wugt\n\n2015-01-01\n\nis a superior hydrogen bond acceptor.

It is the basis of the physical working capacity. Value of the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max is the best indicator for the aerobic capacity evaluation.The purpose of this study was to check the possibility of using VO2max as the indicator of aerobic capacity in sportsmen and to check differences in VO2max values in regard to non-sportsmen.The goals were: 1.Analyses of the VO2max values in sportsmen of various sports 2. Comparison of values of sportsmen with the values of non-sportsmen.This study included 67 sportsmen (rowers, football players and judoists and 28 nonsportsmen.

The main aim of this study was to determine the maximal arm and leg muscle vascular conductances (VC) during leg and arm exercise, to find out if the maximal muscular vasodilatory response is restrained during maximal combined arm and leg exercise. Six Swedish elite cross-country skiers, age (mean Â± s.e.m.) 24 Â± 2 years, height 180 Â± 2 cm, weight 74 Â± 2 kg, and maximal oxygen uptake (VÌO2,max) 5.1 Â± 0.1 l minâ1 participated in the study. Femoral and subclavian vein blood flows, intra-arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, as well as blood gases in the femoral and subclavian vein, right atrium and femoral artery were determined during skiing (roller skis) at â¼76% of VÌO2,max and at VÌO2,max with different techniques: diagonal stride (combined arm and leg exercise), double poling (predominantly arm exercise) and leg skiing (predominantly leg exercise). During submaximal exercise cardiac output (26â27 l minâ1), mean blood pressure (MAP) (â¼87 mmHg), systemic VC, systemic oxygen delivery and pulmonary VÌO2 (â¼4 l minâ1) attained similar values regardless of exercise mode. The distribution of cardiac output was modified depending on the musculature engaged in the exercise. There was a close relationship between VC and VÌO2 in arms (r = 0.99, P arm VC (63.7 Â± 5.6 ml minâ1 mmHgâ1) was attained during double poling, while peak leg VC was reached at maximal exercise with the diagonal technique (109.8 Â± 11.5 ml minâ1 mmHgâ1) when arm VC was 38.8 Â± 5.7 ml minâ1 mmHgâ1. If during maximal exercise arms and legs had been vasodilated to the observed maximal levels then mean arterial pressure would have dropped at least to 75â77 mmHg in our experimental conditions.

We pay particular attention to an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with three right-handed neutrino singlets in which we require that the three lepton numbers L e , L Î¼ , and L Ï be separately conserved in the Yukawa couplings, but assume that they are softly broken by the Majorana mass matrix M R of the neutrino singlets. In this framework, where lepton-number breaking occurs at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale, deviations from family lepton number conservation are calculable, i.e., finite, and lepton mixing stems exclusively from M R . We show that in this framework either maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing or maximal solar neutrino mixing or both can be imposed by invoking symmetries. In this way those maximal mixings are stable against radiative corrections. The model which achieves maximal (or nearly maximal) solar neutrino mixing assumes that there are two different scales in M R and that the lepton number (dash)L=L e -L Î¼ -L Ï 1 is conserved in between them. We work out the difference between this model and the conventional scenario where (approximate) (dash)L invariance is imposed directly on the mass matrix of the light neutrinos.

In this paper, we work in the supersymmetric version of this mechanism, where the singlet-like sneutrino could be an asymmetric dark matter (ADM candidate in the maximally U(1L symmetric limit. However, even a tiny Î´m, the mass splitting between sneutrino and anti-sneutrino as a result of the tiny U(1L breaking effect, could lead to fast oscillation between sneutrino and anti-sneutrino and thus spoils the ADM scenario. We study the evolution of this oscillation and find that a weak scale sneutrino, which tolerates a relatively larger Î´mâ¼10â5Â eV, is strongly favored. We also investigate possible natural ways to realize that small Î´m in the model.\n\nSolution of the main problem of the lunar physical libration by a numerical method\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZagidullin, Arthur; Petrova, Natalia; Nefediev, Yurii\n\n2016-10-01\n\nSeries of the lunar programs requires highly accurate ephemeris of the Moon at any given time. In the light of the new requirements on the accuracy the requirements to the lunar physical libration theory increase.At the Kazan University there is the experience of constructing the lunar rotation theory in the analytical approach. Analytical theory is very informative in terms of the interpretation of the observed data, but inferior to the accuracy of numerical theories. The most accurate numerical ephemeris of the Moon is by far the ephemeris DE430 / 431 built in the USA. It takes into account a large number of subtle effects both in external perturbations of the Moon, and in its internal structure. Before the Russian scientists the task is to create its own numerical theory that would be consistent with the American ephemeris. On the other hand, even the practical application of the american ephemeris requires a deep understanding of the principles of their construction and the intelligent application.As the first step, we constructed a theory in the framework of the main problem. Because we compare our theory with the analytical theory of Petrova (1996), all the constants and the theory of orbital motion are taken identical to the analytical theory. The maximum precision, which the model can provide is 0.01 seconds of arc, which is insufficient to meet the accuracy of modern observations, but this model provides the necessary basis for further development.We have constructed the system of the libration equations, for which the numerical integrator was developed. The internal accuracy of the software integrator is several nanoseconds. When compared with the data of Petrova the differences of order of 1 second are observed at the resonant frequencies. The reason, we believe, in the inaccuracy of the analytical theory. We carried out a comparison with the Eroshkin's data [2], which gave satisfactory agreement, and with Rambaux data. In the latter case, as expected\n\nAntioxidant, anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective activity of Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim. and Filipendula vulgaris Moench.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSamardÅ¾iÄ, Stevan; ArsenijeviÄ, Jelena; BoÅ¾iÄ, Dragana; MilenkoviÄ, Marina; TeÅ¡eviÄ, Vele; MaksimoviÄ, Zoran\n\n2018-03-01\n\nMeadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim.) and dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris Moench) are herbaceous perennials employed in folk medicine for their antirheumatic, antipyretic and anti-ulcer properties. To assess ethnomedicinal claims through investigation of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective effects of F. ulmaria and F. vulgaris lyophilized flower infusions (LFIs) as well as the F. vulgaris isolated flavonoids spiraeoside, kaempferol 4'-O-glucoside, astragalin 2'-O-gallate, mixture of hyperoside 2'-O-gallate and isoquercitrin 2'-O-gallate, and a tannin tellimagrandin II. Free radical scavenging activity of the tested samples was determined by examining their ability to neutralize DPPH and OH radicals in vitro, whereas reducing properties were assessed in Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assay. Anti-inflammatory activity was studied ex vivo in human platelets by monitoring the effect on eicosanoid biosynthesis. Gastroprotective action was estimated in animal model of acute gastric injury induced by ethanol. LFIs and spiraeoside exerted activities comparable to those of positive control in DPPH-radical scavenging and FRAP antioxidant assays, whereas notable hydroxyl radical scavenging ability was demonstrated only for spiraeoside (IC 50 = 5.1Î¼g/mL). Among tested samples, astragalin 2â³-O-gallate (IC 50 = 141.1Î¼g/mL) and spiraeoside (IC 50 = 4.69Î¼g/mL) the most markedly inhibited production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E 2 and 12(S)-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid in human platelets, respectively. Examination of LFIs (100-300mg/kg, p.o.) gastroprotective action in rats revealed their capacity to preserve mucosal integrity. In addition, spiraeoside (50mg/kg, p.o.) and tellimagrandin II (40mg/kg, p.o.) showed ulcer preventive ability. Current study supports documented traditional use of investigated herbs and indicates that flavonoid and tannin components are partially responsible for the demonstrated pharmacological\n\nAspergillus niger PA2: a novel strain for extracellular biotransformation of L-tyrosine into L-DOPA.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAgarwal, Pragati; Pareek, Nidhi; Dubey, Swati; Singh, Jyoti; Singh, R P\n\n2016-05-01\n\nL-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine), an amino acid derivative is the most widely used drug of choice for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurologic injuries. The present study deals with the elevated biochemical transformation of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA by Aspergillus niger PA2, a potent tyrosinase producer, isolated from decomposed food wastes. This appears to be the first report on A. niger as a notable extracellular tyrosinase producer. The extracellular tyrosinase activity produced remarkably higher levels of L-DOPA, i.e. 2.44 mg mL(-1) when the media was supplemented with 5 mg mL(-1) L-tyrosine. The optimum pH for tyrosinase production was 6.0, with the maximal L-DOPA production at the same pH. The product thus produced was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, UV spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, that had denoted this to be L-DOPA. Kinetic parameters viz. Y p/s, Q s and Q p had further indicated the notable levels of production. Thus, Aspergillus niger PA2 could be a promising resource and may be further exploited for large-scale production of L-DOPA.\n\nSuitable configurations for triangular formation flying about collinear libration points under the circular and elliptic restricted three-body problems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFerrari, Fabio; Lavagna, MichÃ¨le\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe design of formations of spacecraft in a three-body environment represents one of the most promising challenges for future space missions. Two or more cooperating spacecraft can greatly answer some very complex mission goals, not achievable by a single spacecraft. The dynamical properties of a low acceleration environment such as the vicinity of libration points associated to a three-body system, can be effectively exploited to design spacecraft configurations able of satisfying tight relative position and velocity requirements. This work studies the evolution of an uncontrolled formation orbiting in the proximity of periodic orbits about collinear libration points under the Circular and Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problems. A three spacecraft triangularly-shaped formation is assumed as a representative geometry to be investigated. The study identifies initial configurations that provide good performance in terms of formation keeping, and investigates key parameters that control the relative dynamics between the spacecraft within the three-body system. Formation keeping performance is quantified by monitoring shape and size changes of the triangular formation. The analysis has been performed under five degrees of freedom to define the geometry, the orientation and the location of the triangle in the synodic rotating frame.\n\nAnalytical and numerical construction of vertical periodic orbits about triangular libration points based on polynomial expansion relations among directions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nQian, Ying-Jing; Yang, Xiao-Dong; Zhai, Guan-Qiao; Zhang, Wei\n\n2017-08-01\n\nInnovated by the nonlinear modes concept in the vibrational dynamics, the vertical periodic orbits around the triangular libration points are revisited for the Circular Restricted Three-body Problem. The Î¶ -component motion is treated as the dominant motion and the Î¾ and Î· -component motions are treated as the slave motions. The slave motions are in nature related to the dominant motion through the approximate nonlinear polynomial expansions with respect to the Î¶ -position and Î¶ -velocity during the one of the periodic orbital motions. By employing the relations among the three directions, the three-dimensional system can be transferred into one-dimensional problem. Then the approximate three-dimensional vertical periodic solution can be analytically obtained by solving the dominant motion only on Î¶ -direction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an accuracy study was carried out to validate the polynomial expansion (PE) method. As one of the applications, the invariant nonlinear relations in polynomial expansion form are used as constraints to obtain numerical solutions by differential correction. The nonlinear relations among the directions provide an alternative point of view to explore the overall dynamics of periodic orbits around libration points with general rules.\n\nPrinciples of maximally classical and maximally realistic quantum ...\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nPrinciples of maximally classical and maximally realistic quantum mechanics.

We investigated the neural overlap between L1 and L2 semantic representations of translation equivalents using a production task in which the participants had to name pictures in L1 and L2. Using a decoding approach, we tested whether brain activity during the production of individual nouns in one language allowed predicting the production of the same concepts in the other language. Because both languages only share the underlying semantic representation (sensory and lexical overlap was maximally avoided), this would offer very strong evidence for neural overlap in semantic representations of bilinguals. Based on the brain activation for the individual concepts in one language in the bilateral occipito-temporal cortex and the inferior and the middle temporal gyrus, we could accurately predict the equivalent individual concepts in the other language. This indicates that these regions share semantic representations across L1 and L2 word production. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

C.; Pavlak, T. A.; Howell, K. C.; Woodard, M. A.; Woodfork, D. W.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn the last few decades, several missions have successfully exploited trajectories near the.Sun-Earth L1 and L2 libration points. Recently, the collinear libration points in the Earth-Moon system have emerged as locations with immediate application. Most libration point orbits, in any system, are inherently unstable. and must be controlled. To this end, several stationkeeping strategies are considered for application to ARTEMIS. Two approaches are examined to investigate the stationkeeping problem in this regime and the specific options. available for ARTEMIS given the mission and vehicle constraints. (I) A baseline orbit-targeting approach controls the vehicle to remain near a nominal trajectory; a related global optimum search method searches all possible maneuver angles to determine an optimal angle and magnitude; and (2) an orbit continuation method, with various formulations determines maneuver locations and minimizes costs. Initial results indicate that consistent stationkeeping costs can be achieved with both approaches and the costs are reasonable. These methods are then applied to Lissajous trajectories representing a baseline ARTEMIS libration orbit trajectory.\n\nSub-maximal and maximal Yo-Yo intermittent endurance test level 2: heart rate response, reproducibility and application to elite soccer\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBradley, Paul S; Mohr, Magni; Bendiksen, Mads\n\n2011-01-01\n\nto detect test-retest changes and discriminate between performance for different playing standards and positions in elite soccer.

These finite transverse energy solutions are maximally symmetric p-dimensional topological defects where n = ( p + 1) + l. The radius of curvature of anti de Sitter space provides an extra length scale that allows us to study the equations of motion in a limit where the masses of the Higgs field and the massive vector bosons are both vanishing. We call this the double BPS limit. In anti de Sitter space, the equations of motion depend on both p and l. The exact analytical solutions are expressed in terms of standard special functions. The known exact analytical solutions are for kink-like defects ( p = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . ; l = 1), vortex-like defects ( p = 1 , 2 , 3; l = 2), and the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole ( p = 0; l = 3). A bonus is that the double BPS limit automatically gives a maximally symmetric classical glueball type solution. In certain cases where we did not find an analytic solution, we present numerical solutions to the equations of motion. The asymptotically exponentially increasing volume with distance of anti de Sitter space imposes different constraints than those found in the study of defects in Minkowski space.\n\nImproving the Accuracy of Predicting Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2pk)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDowns, Meghan E.; Lee, Stuart M. C.; Ploutz-Snyder, Lori; Feiveson, Alan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMaximal oxygen (VO2pk) is the maximum amount of oxygen that the body can use during intense exercise and is used for benchmarking endurance exercise capacity. The most accurate method to determineVO2pk requires continuous measurements of ventilation and gas exchange during an exercise test to maximal effort, which necessitates expensive equipment, a trained staff, and time to set-up the equipment. For astronauts, accurate VO2pk measures are important to assess mission critical task performance capabilities and to prescribe exercise intensities to optimize performance. Currently, astronauts perform submaximal exercise tests during flight to predict VO2pk; however, while submaximal VO2pk prediction equations provide reliable estimates of mean VO2pk for populations, they can be unacceptably inaccurate for a given individual. The error in current predictions and logistical limitations of measuring VO2pk, particularly during spaceflight, highlights the need for improved estimation methods.\n\nTri-maximal vs. bi-maximal neutrino mixing\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nScott, W.G\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIt is argued that data from atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments point strongly to tri-maximal or bi-maximal lepton mixing.

NMF aims to find two non-negative matrices whose product closely approximates the original matrix. Traditional NMF methods minimize either the l2 norm or the Kullback-Leibler distance between the product of the two matrices and the original matrix.

Maxim. root (AKE).An in vitro evaluation was performed by using rat intestinal Î±-glucosidase (maltase and sucrase), the key enzymes linked with type 2 diabetes. And an in vivo evaluation was also performed by loading maltose, sucrose, glucose to normal rats. As a result, AKE showed concentration-dependent inhibition effects on rat intestinal maltase and rat intestinal sucrase with IC(50) values of 1.83 and 1.03mg/mL, respectively. In normal rats, after loaded with maltose, sucrose and glucose, administration of AKE significantly reduced postprandial hyperglycemia, which is similar to acarbose used as an anti-diabetic drug. High contents of total phenolics (80.49 Â± 0.05mg GAE/g extract) and total flavonoids (430.69 Â± 0.91mg RE/g extract) were detected in AKE. In conclusion, AKE possessed anti-hyperglycemic effects and the possible mechanisms were associated with its inhibition on Î±-glucosidase and the improvement on insulin release and/or insulin sensitivity as well. The anti-hyperglycemic activity possessed by AKE maybe attributable to its high contents of phenolic and flavonoid compounds.\n\nEffect of Ramadan observance on maximal muscular performance of trained men.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBouhlel, Hatem; Shephard, Roy J; Gmada, Nebil; Aouichaoui, Chirine; Peres, Gilbert; Tabka, Zouhair; Bouhlel, Ezdine\n\n2013-05-01\n\nTo assess the influence of Ramadan fasting on maximal performance of moderately trained young men using various tests of muscle performance. Comparison of Ramadan fasting (n = 10) versus control group (n = 10) over 3 test sessions, before Ramadan (B), at the end of the first week of Ramadan (R-1), and during the fourth week of Ramadan (R-4). At each 2-day test session, 4 tests were performed in the same order: measurement of vertical jump height (VJH) and a force-velocity test using the arms on day 1, and measurement of handgrip force (HGF), and a force-velocity test using the legs on day 2. Twenty trained men. Maximal power of the arms and of the legs (force-velocity testing), vertical jump performance, HGF, anthropometric data, dietary intake, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Two-way analyses of variance (group Ã time) showed Ramadan fasters with decreased maximal anaerobic power of the arms (Wmax-A) and legs (Wmax-L) at R-1, with a partial return of arm data to initial values at R-4. Vertical jump height and HGF remained unchanged throughout. Other changes in Ramadan observers were a decreased energy intake and a decrease of plasma volume at R-1. These results suggest that Ramadan observance initially had detrimental effects on Wmax-A, and Wmax-L, with a tendency to recovery by week 4 of Ramadan. Reductions of total energy intake and intramuscular glycogen may contribute to the reduced Wmax-A and Wmax-L during Ramadan fasting.\n\nGeochemical features of the elemental composition of meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L).Maxim) in Kemerovo Oblast\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhdanov, V.

The content of 55 elements in the plant is determined by ICP-MS. Statistical analysis of the results allowed us to establish the effect of the soil mineral composition and the mining region specificity on the elemental composition of meadowsweet, to reveal significant positive correlations of the elements and to establish a statistically significant difference in the studied areas on the basis of the content of some elements. Sample reference to one of the clusters, followed by an assessment of their geochemical features is determined by the K-average method.\n\nMaximizing Entropy of Pickard Random Fields for 2x2 Binary Constraints\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nSÃ¸gaard, Jacob; Forchhammer, SÃ¸ren\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper considers the problem of maximizing the entropy of two-dimensional (2D) Pickard Random Fields (PRF) subject to constraints.

All possible binary 2x2 constraints are considered and all constraints are categorized into groups according to their properties. For constraints which can be modeled by a PRF approach and with positive entropy, we characterize and provide statistics...... of the maximum PRF entropy. As examples, we consider the well known hard square constraint along with a few other constraints....\n\nMaximal respiratory pressures and pulmonary function in male runners.\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCordain, L; Glisan, B J; Latin, R W; Tucker, A; Stager, J M\n\n1987-01-01\n\nTo determine the effects of long term exercise on respiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory (Pl max) and expiratory (PE max) pressures, pulmonary volumes and capacities and anthropometric parameters were measured in a group of 101 male runners aged 16 to 58 years.

It is confirmed that the rigid inner core has the eigenfrequency, (1-rhosub(t)/rhosub(r))esub(r)Î© 0 , of nutation (Î© 0 : the mean rotation rate of the Earth, esub(r): ellipticity of the rigid inner core, and rhosub(t), rhosub(r): the densities of the fluid outer and rigid inner cores, respectively), but it is concluded to be extremely difficult to interpret the 24-yr libration of the pole suggested by MARKOWITZ (1960, 1968) in terms of the nutation with this frequency.

Part 1 focuses on the factors that affect maximal power production, while part 2, which will follow in a forthcoming edition of Sports Medicine, explores the practical application of these findings by reviewing the scientific literature relevant to the development of training programmes that most effectively enhance maximal power production.
