It is an attempt to bring together and exhibit in historical sequence the main ideas that have challenged the claims of supernatural religions, or affirmed this-worldly concerns and human­ centered values. The selection of these pieces has been difficult. Some items thrust themselves forward. For example, it would be strange to construct a book on unbelief without some contribution from Hume, Marx, or Russell. But others, such as Collins and Palmer, could have been made to stand down in favor of . . . , and here each reader can submit his or her own particular preference. The choices I would, however, defend to the last are Epicurus himself and Lucretius. They stand at the fount of unbelief: the philosophical archetypes for looking at the world as a single natural system in which supernatural agents and bodiless spirits play no part. Rarity as well as philosophical interest also attach to three items. Two are the suppressed essays, \"Of the Immortality of the Soul\" and \"Of Suicide\" by David Hume. These are printed here for the first time with the short paragraphs sanctioned by Hume and include the final correc­ tions made in his own hand as preserved in the unique copy in the National Library of Scotland. The third is the splendid dialogue by the poet Shelley, A Refutation of Deism. This has always been difficult to find and is here reprinted for the first time in its original form in a collection of works of philosophical rather than literary importance. vii\n\nviii\n\nGASKIN\n\nAn apology: One or two of the points made in the Introduction are repeated- very sparingly - in comments made about particular au­ thors.

Walter Bagehot, 1879 Before accepting any belief one ought first to follow reason as a guide, for credulity without enquiry is a sure way to deceive oneself. We have plenty of deceivers in our own times. . . . Their favourite injunctions are. . . . \"Salvation is through faith\"; \"The wisdom of this world is wickedness. \" Celsus, c. 170 A.D.\n\nThere are five main varieties of unbelief: materialism, skepticism, aca­ demic or critical unbelief, social unbelief, and unbelief that is derived from the existence of natural explanations for the prevalent phenome­ non of religion. I return to these in the third section of this Introduc­ tion, but two prior matters require attention before any real under­ standing of the progress of unbelief is possible. The first of these concerns the exact meaning of unbelief and its relation to atheism, deism, and certain other traditional stances about the existence and nature of god(s) . The second concerns the difference between ancient and modern unbelief brought about by the intervening triumph of Christianity and Islam - what I have called the \"historical dialectic. \" Ancient unbelief is social, skeptical, and critical; but at best it is also positive; an autonomous, fre e inquiry into the nature o f the universe and the human relation to it. Modern unbelief is much of this, but it is also negative and reactive; a denial of the teaching of the religions which had for so long dominated the cultural, intellectual, and political life of the Western world. But first the mapwork of unbelief-the essential terminology of the subject.\n\n1 . The Mapwork of Unbelief and Atheism A common dictionary definition of unbeliefis \"absence or lack of belief; disbelief, incredulity: most frequently with reference to matters of 1\n\n2\n\nGASKIN\n\nreligion. \" The same source defines atheism as \"disbelief in the exis­ tence of God or gods; godlessness.\" In this book the word \"unbelief\" (or its cognates) is regularly used rather than \"atheism\" (or its cognates). \"Unbelief\" however needs a more precise definition than the one given, and atheism has variations of meaning as well as a propensity to be used as a term of abuse that must be clearly indicated: partly to justify preference for \"unbelief\"; and partly to discern the several variations of opinion that constitute atheism and which are identical with the essential aspect of unbelief as the term is defined in the follOWing section. Unbelief is (A) lack of belief in supernatural agents -God, gods, demons, or any abstraction intended as a substitute for these, e.g. Tillich's \"ground of our being\"; (B) lack of belief in miracles, interven­ tions in the natural order by supernatural agents; and (C) lack of belief in a future state, in the continuance of any individual person after that person's real bodily death. Let us refer to these as unbeliefs A, B, and C. If someone is an unbeliever in sense A, it follows that he or she will also be an unbeliever in sense B since no one could consistently believe in interventions by nonexistent agents. Unbeliefs A and C, on the other hand, may be, and on occasions have been (see p. 2 1 5), entertained independently of each other. But however one looks at it, the essential unbelief is A. It is what we would normally think of as atheism but for the historical confusions associated with that much older term; confu­ sions we must now examine. Originally the Greek work atheos meant simply \"without god\" or, because of the close association between particular gods and the integ­ rity of a state, \"without piety toward the civic god(s), \" i.e., to the god(s) of the state to which the \"atheist\" belonged. But even as early as Plato (c. 428 - 348 B.C. ) distinctions were being drawn between differ­ ent types of atheism. At the beginning of Book X of the Laws, Plato points out that anyone who deliberately performs an impious act must have supposed either that the gods do not exist, or that they take no care of man, or that they are easily appeased and turned aside from their purposes by sacrifices and prayers. The first possibility, if it extended to all gods and not merely to the civic gods of the locality where the atheist happened to reside, would be atheism in the sense of unbelief A. (To some ears \"atheism\" would still carry the nuance of denying the existence of gods, whereas \"unbe­ lief\" would convey the more neutral sense of lacking belief in gods. It is partly to avoid this nuance that I prefer the word unbelief) The third possibility is a species of religious absurdity; an \"impiety\" that does not concern unbelief at all. But the second possibility is a potent source of confusion. Is someone really an unbeliever in sense A if he or she thinks -as the Epicureans did- that there are gods who live inac-\n\nINTRODUCI10N\n\n3\n\ntively in perfect happiness knowing and caring nothing of humanity; or if one thinks -as Voltaire and Paine and many other eighteenth-cen­ tury deists did- that the deity brought into existence and designed the universe and all its processes, but takes no special care of men and women? The Epicurean position is the easier one to assess. The Epicurean gods are natural. They are a product of the material universe and it would be theoretically possible for empirical investigation to show that they do not exist. If it turned out that in fact the gods do not exist, nothing would be lacking in the Epicurean system except blissful beings perhaps worthy of our contemplation as the embodiment of perfect happiness. More significantly, if they do exist, the Epicurean gods are mere inactive centers of permanent well-being neither de­ manding nor justifying any religious activity on earth. They do not respond to prayers. They are insensitive to sacrifice. They neither know nor care about humanity in any way. In short, the Epicurean belief in gods is unbelief A. It is a complete lack of belief in all supernat­ ural agents since their \"gods\" were neither supernatural nor agents. When we remember that the Epicureans also had no recourse to divine interventions in natural events, and that they emphatically rejected belief in any sort of future state, the scale of their \"impiety\" (in Platonic or Christian terms) becomes evident: they were unbelievers in all three senses defined previously. For these reasons, the Epicureans play prominent roles in the first and last chapters of this book. Deism presents a more difficult picture. Some four hundred years after Plato, the Stoic philosopher Epictetus (c. 55- 1 35 A.D. ) set out (Discourses, I, xii) what are in effect five belief possibilities including deism (he did not have the word at his disposal) and what may be called \"attenuated deism\": Concerning the gods, there are some who say that no divine being exists [i.e., full atheism or unbelief A without qualification); and others that a divine being exists but is idle and uncaring and has no fore­ thought for anything [Epicureanism]; and a third class that there is such a being, and he takes forethought also, but only in respect of great and heavenly things, but of nothing that is on earth [attenuated deism); and a fourth class, that he takes thought of things both in heaven and earth, but only in general, and not of each particular individual [deism) . And there is a fifth class, whereof are Odysseus and Socrates, who say \"Nor can I move without thy knowledge. \" [Homer, Iliad X, 279. See also Xenophon, Memorabilia I, i, 19: \"Socrates thought that the gods know all things, our words and deeds and secret purposes; that they are present everywhere . . . . \" With the substitu­ tion of the singular for \"gods,\" this is also part of the Christian and Muslim view of things, Le. , it is part of theism: the other part being that this ever-present, all-seeing and caring supernatural agent is also creator and sustainer of all things).\n\n4\n\nGASKIN\n\nNeither deism nor attentuated deism amounts to atheism in the sense of unbelief A. Despite the fact that virtually all to whom the title \"deist\" could be attached entertain unbelief B (lack of belief in miracles) and that very many would profess unbelief C (lack of belief in a future state), the vestigial belief in a potent supernatural agent, although far from Christian theism and in many cases stridently opposed to Chris­ tianity, is not straight lack of belief in supernatural agents. Indeed deistic arguments have been employed as a step on the way to theism: for example, the arguments from design and from cosmic origins, which convince the diest, are also built into the foundations of any reasoned commitment to Christian or Islamic theism. Professed deists, Voltaire and Paine, for example, are included in this book, which is primarily concerned with unbelief A, because the ideo­ logical grip of Christian theism after the destruction of the ancient world was so complete and so tenacious that eighteenth-century deism represents, not the step toward a rationally based Christianity which it could have been, but a crucial historical step away from Christianity and toward modern unbelief. The variety of meanings rolled up in the word atheism apart, its use as an accurate and acceptable description is deeply prejudiced by its long-standing employment as a term of abuse. The ancient classical suspicions about the loyalty of anyone who denied the state gods have already been noted. in Judeo-Christian history the association of \"the fool\" with one who says \"there is no God\" is at least as old as Psalm XIV. But at the beginning of the eighteenth century, four influences still combined to make atheism both a serious criminal accusation and also a term of abuse for an imprecisely defined but loathed and dreaded minority persuasion (compare the present-day use of the terms \"sexist and \"racist\"). The four influences were the deep conviction that a denial of Christianity was wicked, the prolonged enthusiasm of the Roman Church for root­ ing out heresy, the prevalence of state laws in defense of Christianity (of whatever species), and the habit of designating as \"atheism\" any deviation from some other article of Christian faith taken to be crucial (belief in a future state for example). Atheism was even used to refer to something as contingently connected with belief A as antisocial behav­ ior. Thus the phrase \"practical atheist\" (used by Tillotson, Wollaston, and others) indicated those whose behavior was so bad that they denied God in their actions. Confronted with the pejorative associations of the term, its vague­ ness, and later the tendency of religious apologists to define atheism so that no one could be an atheist, it is not surprising to find in English freethinking literature of the second half of the nineteenth century an attempt to restore to the word atheism a clear and unemotive sense identical in content and nuance to what we have called unbelief A. Sir\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nJohn Lubbock in his much-reprinted book The Origins of Civilization (London, 1870) speaks of the prereligious phase of the development of humanity as \"Atheism; understanding by this term not a denial of the existence of a Deity, but an absence of any definite ideas on the sub­ ject\" (p. 1 36). A little later, Charles Bradlaugh, the eminent Victorian secularist, insists - for contemporary, not anthropological uses - in The Freethinkers' Text Book (London, 1 876) that: The Atheist does not say \"There is no God,\" but he says \"I know not what you mean by God; the word \"God\" is to me a sound conveying no clear or distinct affirmation. I do not deny God, because I cannot deny that of which I have no conception, and the conception of which, by its affirmer, is so imperfect that he is unable to define it to me. \" (p.\n\n118)\n\nPartly as a result of Bradlaugh's own activities and those of men and women who thought as he did, the word atheist still conveys mild disapproval, but of the sort now more adequately expressed by the phrase \"militant atheist\": one who cannot leave other people at peace with their own (harmless?) religious beliefs. In the title and elsewhere in this book the word unbelief (where necessary differentiated as definition A, B, or C) is used rather than any qualified use of the word atheism. When no differentiation is offered, at least unbelief sense A will be intended. The terms Epicurean, deist, and theist (or their cognates whenever useful) are also used in the senses explained in the quotation from Epictetus.\n\n2. The Historical Dialetic Unbelief has gone through three distinct historical phases: (a) In classi­ cal antiquity a period of relatively unfettered development that ended between 300 and 450 A.D. During this period Skeptical and Epicurean unbelief is definitively set out; (b) A long period during which these classical schools, and any substitute for them, are resolutely and all but successfully suppressed by Christian and Islamic monotheistic domin­ ion of the Western world; and (c) the modern period dating from the late sixteenth century in which initially Skeptical and Epicurean argu­ ments are rediscovered, then the biblical claims of Christianity are challenged in order to establish deistic positions, and finally the deistic position themselves are rejected in a welter of discussion which results in (successful) investigations of the social and psychological causes of the prevalent phenomenon of religion. (a) CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY At least two interesting questions are pre­ sented for this period. The first is why unbelief shows up in Greek and Roman antiquity despite the prevalence of religion but is so little evident in later centuries because of the prevalence of religion. The\n\n6\n\nGASKIN\n\nsecond is where, when, and what were the earliest manifestations of unbelief. The basic answer to the first question is that the multiple polytheisms of the classical world led to tolerance in matters of religion, and gener­ ally to tolerance concerning philosophical inquiry that resulted in lack of religion, provided that this lack did not extend to an unpatriotic defamation of the gods which protected the particular area where one happened to be. Thus (as Xenophon reports in Memorabilia, I, 3) when the Priestess of Delphi was asked such a question as \"What is my duty about offering sacrifices?\" she replied \"Follow the custom of the State: that is the way to act piously.\" But there were many states and many customs, and there was no unified priesthood to impose any one cus­ tom, nor any popular claim about there being only one true God to justify universal worship. Even under the vast hegemony of Rome, the government required no more than the observance of a minimal official religion on official occasions: much more like an oath of allegiance and an expression of national unity than a serious commitment to some supernatural belief which it would be sinful to reject or blasphemous to treat with insincerity. The difference between classical and Christian attitudes to atheism becomes clearer. The classical atheist - for example, the Christian in his dealings with the Roman state - is dangerous because his atheism puts in question his loyalty to the state. Thus Marcus Aurelius speaks about \"those . . . who do not believe in gods and who fail their coun­ try in its need\": almost certainly a reference (Meditations, III, 1 6) to Christians, and all the more noteworthy given the Emperor's known propensity to think rightly and act justly. On the other hand, the atheist who rejects Christian or Islamic beliefs is, from the point of view of those religions, dangerous because the atheist rejects an eternal truth and puts in jeopardy his own and perhaps other people's attainment of the Kingdom of Heaven. Hence under pagan Rome the Epicureans ­ real philosophical unbelievers -were left in peace, having no reason in conscience to reject customary observances. But the Christians had, or thought they had such reason, with the result, as Tacitus observes, that they were already universally despised (presumably as subversive) when the first of the occasional attempts at suppression of the sect began under Nero. So unbelief was, to a certain extent, countenanced in antiquity. It had three main manifestations: the two philosophical schools of Epicurean­ ism and Skepticism, and what one might call \"social unbelief\" or disillusion with the gods, first clearly evident in Athens of the sophists, i.e., c. 450 - 400 B.C . . We return to the philosophical schools in Chap­ ters 1 and 2, but social unbelief deserves separate attention. It is apparent, for example, in Aristophanes' Clouds (423 B.C. ) , where a stage Socrates (very unfair to the real Socrates) tells a prospective pupil\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nthat \"the gods are no longer current coin in my school,\" and again in several of Euripides tragedies where situations evolve that lead to skeptical comments about the nature or existence of the gods (see p. 87. For Schopenhauer on ancient religion see p. 1 42). More importantly, the first sustained account of the possible natural origins of religious belief dates from this period. It occurs in a long speech recorded by Sextus Empiricus (q. v., p. 27) and attributed by him to the sophist politician Critias (c. 460 - 407 B.C.). The account is of such considerable interest in the history of unbelief that it is here quoted in its entirety. Some of the lines are attributed by Aetius (sec­ ond century A.D. ) to a lost play by Euripides, but apart from the fact that Critias and Euripides are almost exact contemporaries in Athens so that the piece may be a compilation from both sources, it is the exis­ tence and currency of such an idea, not its attribution, which concerns us. There was a time when the life of men was disorderly, beastly and ruled by force, when there was no prize for the good and no penalty for the wicked. Then men, I think, framed primitive laws, in order that justice should be sovereign over all alike and should shackle wanton violence, and those who sinned were punished. But then, since men committed furtively the acts of violence which the laws restrained them from doing openly, some shrewd and clever man, it seems to me, invented the dread of gods for mortals, so that the wicked should be afraid, even if their deeds, or words, or thoughts were in secret. And so he introduced the supernatural, saying that there is a god blessed with unceasing life, who with his mind hears and sees, takes careful notice of and heeds such things, possessing a divine nature; who will hear all that is said among mortals, and will be able to see all that is done. Even if you plan some wicked deed in silence, that will not escape tH'e gods. For they take note of everything. By uttering these words he taught the happiest of lessons, conceal­ ing the truth with a falsehood. He said that the gods dwell in a place, the mention of which would strike most terror into men. From this place there came, he knew, the fears that mortals have and the things that benefit a wretched life: the vault of heaven above, where he saw the lightning to be and the dread rumblings of thunder, and the stormlit frame of the sky, the beautiful embroidery of that skilled craftsman, time; where the bright mass of the sun travels and from which the moist rain falls upon the earth. Such were the fears he surrounded men with, through which he both by his words gave the deity a fine dwelling and a suitable place, and quenched lawlessness with laws . In this way, I think, did someone first persuade mortal men to believe in the existence of the race of gods.\n\nA hint of another naturalistic account of the origin of religion survives in a paraphrase of an idea attributed to the sophist Prodicus: \"that things from which benefits to human life have been derived have come to be considered deities, such as Demeter [the corn-goddess, or co�n\n\n8\n\nGASKIN\n\nitself] and Dionysus [the god of wine, or wine itself]. \" Diagoras, who is always dubbed \"the Atheist\" (very little is known about him) lived at this time. Cicero's telling use of an anecdote concerning him can be found on p. 3 1 . Drawing attention to the existence of social unbelief i n the second half of the fifth century B.C. is not intended to give the impression of a world of unbelief or even of a world of Athenian unbelief. Religions were normal and everywhere encountered. Moreover, as already ex­ plained, atheism was associated with civic disloyalty. Atheism thus remained a largely unacceptable public position in the Greek city­ states and prosecutions could and did take place (the most celebrated and certainly the least deserved being that of Socrates himself) . But such prosecutions were rare, and were directed- sometimes with dis­ guised political motives -at isolated individuals, not at ideas as such or at philosophical systems that took no account of the gods. The differ­ ence between the classical toleration of ideas and the closed minds of Christianity to the same ideas may be illustrated by the following paraphrase (by Bp. Hippolytus, third century) of Democratus' account of an infinite universe in which our world is one among many, and has no special status as a divine creation: In some of these worlds there is no sun or moon, in some they are larger than our sun and moon, and in some there are several suns and moons. The intervals between these worlds are irregular, and in some directions they are more numerous, in others less. In one place they are being born, in another dying. Some of them are growing, some are in their prime, and some declining. When they collide, they destroy one another. There are some worlds which are devoid of plants and animals and are completely waterless.\n\nContrast the ideological freedoms of a civilization that could entertain without fuss or commotion philosophical views of this sort with the situation that obtained two thousand years after Democritus - at the end of the sixteenth century -when Giordano Bruno was imprisoned by the Holy Inquisition for seven years, repeatedly tortured and even­ tually burned alive for suggesting somewhat similar ideas to those of Democritus but, by the time of Bruno, contrary to the long-received and almost universally enforced picture of the world as unique, anthro­ pocentric, and expressing God's purposes for human life. The point is thus not only that unbelief existed in various forms in the ancient world (which is obvious), but that it existed independently (which is less obvious) as one of several exciting philosophical accounts of the way things could be, not merely as a negative reaction to a religious consensus about the way things are. No such consensus ex­ isted; nor could it exist before the establishment of a monotheistic religion claiming both universal allegiance and a revelation that ex­ cluded the truth of every view incompatible with itself. Such a revela­ tion was provided by Christianity; Islam followed with another.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\n(b) THE DOMINION OF MONOTHEISM In the second century A .D . the arguments for and against the existence of god(s) could still be pre­ sented on a more or less equal footing, for example, in the anthology of skepticism by Sextus Empiricus (see, in particular, Book I of the work usually called Against the Physicists). But the intellectual climate is changing. Not only is Christianity itself emerging as a serious force but there is a tone of righteous indignation against unbelief that is evident even among Stoic monotheists. Plutarch strongly denounces the Epicu­ reans, so does Epictetus: There are no gods [according to the Epicureans], or if there be, they have no care for men, nor we any communion with them; and thus religion and holiness, whereof the multitude babble, is the lying of imposters and sophists, or of legislators, for the frightening and re­ straining of evil-doers. By Zeus! What a monstrous impudence and imposture! [Discourses, II, xx)\n\nThe tone of intolerance can also be heard in St. Paul, but it is more emphatic, more precise, and of infinitely greater historical con­ sequence: But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed. [Galatians I; 8-9; see also, for example, Romans XVI; 1 7-20 and 2 John 10)\n\nWith injunctions of this sort at source, together with claims to be the exclusive and final revelation of the one and only true God, it is not surprising that almost as soon as Christianity achieved temporal power (at first, and somewhat precariously, under the Emperor Constantine in 3 1 3) it turned upon other religions and unsympathetic philosophies, and even upon variations of its own doctrines, with an ideological ferocity that was previously unknown in the world. For the Christian (and by the seventh century the Muslim as well) , the total exclusive character of the religious truth now accepted made unbelief not merely false as a matter of fact, not merely socially disruptive, but also wicked: something that damned the unbeliever, and perhaps those influenced by him, in this world and the next. Intolerance, the rational consequence of this position, was thus es­ tablished as a religious virtue. Temples were torn down or coerced into Christian use, heresy was identified and suppressed, literature critical of the new religion was physically destroyed (e.g., copies of the power­ ful work Against the Christians by Porphyry were burned in 448), and the non-Christian schools of ancient philosophy at Athens were finally closed in 529. For a thousand years the voices of unbelief were effec­ tively silenced by the, doubtlessly sincere, use of what can best be\n\n10\n\nGASKIN\n\ncalled the Principle of Intolerance: We know what is right and true, and for your sake it is our duty to see to it that you know nothing else. This does not mean that no persons cherished or circumspectly expressed thoughts that might provide obscure material for a scholarly history of unbelief in the period 500 to 1500. But the fact remains that no significant or influential literary unbelief can be identified in the Chris­ tian centuries that begin with Sextus Empiricus and end with Bruno and Vanini. When the religious monolith began to be chipped away, unbe­ lief was no longer the comparatively free and autonomous search for philosophical truth that was evident in the best of the ancient world. It was a reaction against religion and against the tyranny of religion\n\n(c) THE MODERN PERIOD Unless some of the main contributions to unbelief since about 1 600 are read in chronological order (as they are presented in this book) the marked groupings of arguments and tactics among them are not immediately obvious. At first, unbelief tends, for very understandable reasons of prudence, to be presented in a covert manner - as the \"real\" meaning of the gospels or as an illicit opinion quoted at length in order to show its \"obvious\" falsity by contrast with the \"truth\" of the Christian revela­ tion. One or another of these tactics can be seen in the work of Hobbes, Collins, Hume, Voltaire, and in numerous English critical deists in the first half of the eighteenth century. The level of philosophical argu­ ment is often very high indeed, but the object is attacked indirectly. In the same century, positive deistic positions (positions that affirm the creative and designing activity of God but not that being's concern with man now) are urged (e.g., by Voltaire and Paine) against both the superstition of revealed religion and the scandal of atheism. However, among writers who influenced or were influenced by the violent erup­ tion of anticlericalism that marked the French Revolution, new features of unbelief are discernible. The mask, where it was a mask, of deism can be removed in order to advocate full unbelief (e.g., D'Holbach), and the morality of Christianity can -still at some risk -be denounced (e.g., Paine and Palmer) not only as an aberration of institutionalized Christianity, but as flawed at its source. Shelley's learned and vigorous A Refutation of Deism stands both as a summary and culmination of all these movements toward unbelief. In the nineteenth century the most important representations of unbelief- mostly German -took on a new character. It is almost as if it were tacitly agreed that religious beliefs in general and those of Christianity in particular were false, but it was no longer worth the social odium incurred by saying so. Instead the question became what account of religion could be given that would explain its existence and continuance as a conspicuous phenomenon of human society irrespec­ tive of its truth-claims. The various answers given by Schopenhauer,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nFeuerback, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud can be found in Chapters 1 2 and 16. It is only in the final contributions from the present century that the sense of having to react against the demands of religion as a conscious preliminary to unbelief at last disappears. If not glad confident morning again, then at least the thing which made Hume so careful, which so appalled Nietzsche, which still angered Russell, and whose persistence so puzzled the thinkers of the nineteenth century, can be seen slipping away into relative unimportance while unbelief becomes an ordinary and more or less unemotive possibility among other possible points of view about the nature of things.\n\n3. The Philosophical Debate Whatever is said about the terminology and the history of unbelief, the same question remains at the end. It is: whether unbelief is the truth about the way things are, or nearer the truth, or at the very least more probably the truth than any of the more obvious religious accounts that it attempts to displace. A careful reading of the literature of unbelief shows that unbelief depends upon five main themes or argu­ ment-clusters. (a) MATERIALISM The only positive intellectual replacement for reli­ gion, as opposed to its mere rejection, is provided by accounts of the totality of things, with supporting arguments and evidence, whose truth would be incompatible with, in the old logic sense of \"contrary to,\" belief in supernatural agents. The earliest and most influential of such accounts is Epicurean Mate­ rialism. It is an anthropocentric value system (the Epicureans were the humanists of antiquity) combined with the thesis that the totality of things consists in void (empty space) and material entities (fundamental particles and their combinations) which exist and move in the void. This form of materialism holds that all processes and things in the universe, including all life and consciousness, must be explained if they are to be explained at all, in terms of material entities, their qualities, and their movements. It is evident that Epicurean Materialism is the precursor of the atomic theory in modern science, and that assumptions similar to those of Epicurean Materialism constitute the policy usually taken for granted in modern scientific research. Lucretius, Hobbes, D'Holbach, and Feuerbach, the many contemporary adherents of what is usually called the identity theory of mind, as well as some of the leading logical positivists, at least in their early days, are materialists in this sense. Epicurean materialism is not the only form of the doctrine. In partic­ ular there are more recent, more philosophically complex forms which maintain that everything that exists is either itself material or depends\n\n12\n\nGASKIN\n\non matter for its existence. Let us call these forms \"extended material­ ism.\" One of the most important results of such extension is that materialists in this sense are not committed to the view that conscious processes are identical with brain events or with publicly observable behavior. But they are committed to the view that consciousness cannot exist in the absence of a living brain. To put it another way: matter can exist without mind, but not mind without matter. Hume in his essay \"Of the Immortality of the Soul\" adopts extended materialism. So do Marx and Freud and many leading contemporary philosophers includ­ ing Russell and Ayer and various outspoken opponents of the identity theory of mind. Both Epicurean and extended materialists agree on what may be called the \"ontological priority\" or matter and in reject­ ing the dualist conception (typical of supernatural religions) that a supernatural world exists alongside of or, in some metaphorical sense that is difficult to explain, \"beyond\" the natural world. They also of course agree in rejecting the possibility of life after death as a disem­ bodied consciousness. It is perhaps worth noting that until the middle of the twentieth century the majority of academic philosophers repu­ diated materialism in both forms. In recent decades, however, the situation has been reversed. Philosophers who reject both kinds of materialism can still be found, but they are now a small minority among those who concern themselves with this topic. (b) SKEPTICISM A second but less obvious theme in unbelief is philo­ sophical skepticism in its various forms, but originally Pyrrhonian Skepticism (from Pyrrho of Elis, c. 365 - 275 B.C. ) . The main feature of this position was argument to show that no justified true belief about the god(s) or anything else can be attained by man. Hence only the appearances of things can be the basis of action or forbearance from action. Such skepticism has only to balance arguments for and against the existence of god(s) (as Sextus Empiricus tries to do) to show that no dogmatic religion is possible. Thus all religious beliefs are undermined. But so is everything else, and it is no historical accident that the first printing of Sextus -in a Latin translation in 1562- shortly preceded the appearance in European literature of a peculiar fideistic argument for religious belief. If no justified true belief is possible, then we have no better reason to believe in the existence of cats and dogs and other material things than to believe in the existence of gods and supernatu­ ral spirits; and if we believe in the former, why not the latter? This argument from equality of ignorance no more supports religion than it supports any other position. But its existence did mean that the skepti­ cism that is the strongest element in unbelief is not Pyrrhonian Skepti­ cism but a mitigated version that argues that there is something special about belief in god(s) and supernatural spirits which puts the content of such belief \"beyond our understanding\" or deprives it of any distinct\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nmeaning. Skepticism of this sort can be seen in a simple form in Hobbes, where it is a consequence of his materialist analysis of the universe; in a much more sophisticated form in Hume; and again, quite differently, in the writings of Sir Alfred Ayer. (c) ACADEMIC OR CRITICAL UNBELIEF Academic unbelief is the negative theme of unbelief that seeks to show ( or reluctantly concludes from the ubiquitous problem presented to the believer by random evil and mis­ fortune) that the view it rejects is incoherent, or lacks sound arguments and significant evidence to support itself. There is much of it in ancient Academic Skepticism - see, for example, Cicero's Cotta in Chapter 2. But Hume is the greatest single exponent of the position. He is followed by D'Holbach, Russell, and Ayer, and by virtually all modern philoso­ phers of religion who reject the fundamental dualist assumptions of supernatural religion, namely that it both makes sense, and is unavoid­ able in a true account of reality, to talk about the activity of divine agents or supernatural beings which are in another category from (\"in another order of being from\") the material universe. Clearly no overall comment is possible here. The arguments must speak ad hoc for themselves. (d) SOCIAL UNBELIEF OR DISILLUSION WITH GOD (S) , i.e., complete unbe­ lief A and B, or the halfway house of nonreligious deism, devolved from perception of the adverse personal, political, social, or moral conse­ quences of religious belief or from perception of the apparent useless­ ness of religious observances. In writing this book, I was surprised to notice how prominently and frequently this occasion for unbelief ap­ pears in the literature. The theme surfaces with Critias and recurs from Lucretius (with his concern to alleviate fear of death and fear of ever­ watching gods, and his affirmation of anthropocentric values) to Russell (with his concern about the moral inadequacies of Christianity) . Hume is profoundly critical of the frivolous merits and new crimes called into being by religion, and his History ofEngland is in part a chronicle of the dark and contorted actions justified by religious beliefs. Voltaire is a master at exposing the moral cruelty that results from religious devo­\n\ntion and dogmatic creeds. Palmer and Paine find specific humanistic fault with biblical morality and the example of Jesus bar-Joseph as it is usually understood. Shelley denounces Judeo-Christian morality. Marx and Lenin argue that the whole edifice of religion is used to divert attention from what the people can and one day will do for themselves. Nietzsche has the most bitter and pungent insights into some of the darkest and nastiest influences of religion on the free spirit of man, and so on. Now it may be asked firstly whether this condemnation of the effect of religion is justified; and secondly whether, if justified, the condem­ nation provides good grounds for rejecting religion in general.\n\n14\n\nGASKIN\n\nLet us assume the first question, at least in part, to have been an­ swered in the affirmative. If religion - Christianity and Islam in particular-has been responsible for some of the greatest artistic, literary, and idealistic achievements of humanity, it has also, by the common consent of historians and the witness of those still living, been responsible for horrific and protracted cruelty (e.g. , upon countless poor creatures categorized as witches), for dreadful wars and other conflicts that would otherwise have had no occasion or less intensity (e.g. , all the Crusades, the Thirty Years' War, and present conflicts in the Middle East and Ireland), and for individual guilt and misery about imagined sin. But does this provide in itself grounds for unbelief? May not a belief about the nature of things be true and sometimes result in dreadful actions by those who know about its truth, or suffering for those persuaded of its truth? If so, then the unbeliever may reply that in human terms it is better to deny or not to know about some truths. For example, if it could be shown decisively that some now existing race of men is vastly inferior in intelligence, emotional sensitivity, and ability to feel pain, weariness, or discomfort, to the rest of humanity, one could argue that it might well not be a good thing for this to become widely known. Thus, it could be argued that, even if some religion were true, it would be best denied or forgotten, given the consequences we can all perceive. But the unbeliever is not in fact forced into such a heroic or Promethean defiance of real gods. The arguments of academic unbelief coupled with materialist accounts of the nature of things are also parts of his or her total persuasion that supernatural religion is not true, or at least very unlikely to be true. Hence we do not have to suffer the consequences of religion so that truth might prevail. The believer will contest the academic critic in order to maintain that his or her religion does indeed have arguments and evidence in its favor, or that it is part of an autonomous way of looking at things which needs no arguments or evidence. But the believer is also likely to say that all the old evils of religion are past. They were the results of two thousand years of misunderstandings, misuses, or mistranslations of the original sources and intentions: all is now social conscience and humani­ tarian light. Then we notice Iran; or we think what a pity God found so much difficulty in conveying his message clearly; or we wonder whether the new liberal-humanitarian religion is religion at all; or we ask how much free thought or happiness would remain in a society cherished by Marxist-Catholic priests given the past conduct of both ideologies. (e) UNBELIEF FROM NATURAL EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENON OF RELI­ GION There is strong evidence for unbelief of this sort in fifth-century Athens (p.7) and hints elsewhere, for example in Machiavelli (p. 1 53).\n\nINTRODUCI10N\n\n15\n\nHobbes traces religious belief t o the need for ultimate explanations that no explanation from within the natural universe can give. Hume ac­ counts for the original and sustaining cause of religious belief as the fear of the unknown causes of events upon which our life and expecta­ tions depend. But it is the nineteenth century that overflows with natural explanations of the phenomenon of religion. It is the metaphy­ sic of the people that gives men and women external objectives and assures them that life means something (Schopenhauer). It is human­ ity's projection of itself onto an alien universe (Feuerbach). It is the superstition cherished by the ruling classes as the opium of the people (Marx). It is the projection onto the hostile universe of our need for a father figure (Freud) . But does an account - even if it is correct - of the causes of a set of beliefs absolve the believer (or anyone else) from taking seriously the truth claims of the beliefs? Evidently not. An account of what causes men to believe X (even if a true and sufficient account) says nothing about whether X itself is true or probably true or false. But the unbe­ liever's position is that in the case of religion the truth claims of X are at the very least highly questionable, and yet religion is unaffected. Reli­ gion is thus usually entertained independently of what are alleged to be the reasons and evidence in its favor. In that circumstance an account of causal origins - \"a natual history\" - is both needed, and all that is needed, in order to understand why the phenomenon persists. But, it will be said, in all this, and in the writings of the unbelievers represented in this book, one area of evidence that is vital to theistic religions has been ignored except in Shelley's Refutation. This is the evidence consisting of special revelations of the existence and activity of God, the historical books of the Bible and the allegedly divinely inspired dreams of Mahomet recorded in the Koran, for examples. Biblical scholarship has itself, however, dealt with the Christian revela­ tion without significant aid from unbelievers, at least since the eigh­ teenth century (for an account of which see Sir Leslie Stephen's splen­ did History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, particularly Chapter IV). It is thus not necessary to include among Varieties of Unbelief arguments about the literal accuracy of biblical texts which no informed believer, on his or her own showing, now has a right to treat as literally accurate or as containing claims that no reasonable person could reject. On the other hand, allegedly inspired dreams recorded in �he Koran present both an easier and a more difficult target for the unbeliever. They are an easier target inasmuch as dreams do not for the most part seek to pass the test of historicity in any ordinary sense. They are a more difficult target inasmuch as what is inspired will be in certain respects incorrigible. The pertinent questions that must remain are whether something is indeed inspired and how anyone is supposed to know that it is.\n\n16\n\nGASKIN\n\nThe overall stance of unbelief is thus very powerful. There is the possibility of a positive materialist/humanist account of the total nature of things. There are arguments for special skepticism about claims to justified true belief about supernatural agents or categories of being other than the natural. There is much academic doubt about the sound­ ness of the arguments and the effectiveness of the evidence adduced for religious beliefs. There is vast historical and some contemporary evidence to show that the social and personal consequences of religion have at the very least involved much gratuitous misery in the world. Finally there are very good natural explanations for the phenomenon of religion that make no reference to its truth claims.\n\n1 TH E FO U NT OF U N B E L I EF: E P I C U RU S AN D L U C RETI U S O N C LASSICAL . MATE RIAL ISM\n\nThe Fourfold Epicurean Prescription There is nothing to fear from gods, nothing awaiting us in death; good can be attained, evil fortune can be endured. Philodemus (c. 110 - 35 B.C')\n\nBiographical Note Epicurus (34 1 - 270 B.C. ) grew up on the island of Samos. He came to Athens at the age of eighteen, probably in order to attend the Academy (the school of philosophy founded by Plato). After teaching for several years at Mytilene and Lampsacus, he returned to Athens in about 306, purchased a garden, and there established the school of philosophy whose location has ever since given an alternative name to Epicurean­ ism: the Philosophy of the Garden. He remained in this community, quietly teaching his pupils, until his death in 270. He was the first philosopher to admit women to an organized school. A vast collection of writings was attributed to him in antiquity, but the great majority of them were lost: their loss being facilitated by the zealous hostility of Christianity to his philosophy. Lucretius (c. 94 - 55 B.C. ) was a Roman, a contemporary of Cicero's, and a faithful exponent for Latin readers of the Epicurean philosophy. His one work, which in translation takes up about two hundred modern printed pages, is the great didactic poem De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things) . This work survives more or less intact, although its survival can be traced to the existence of a single manuscript of the fifth century. Of the details of Lucretius' life nothing is known. Jerome's story about Lucretius' insanity and suicide has no evidence to support it and may well tell us more abut the taboos and fears of Christians than about the life of the pagan unbeliever. 17\n\n18\n\nGASKIN\n\nPhilosophical Note Epicureanism is the archetype for almost all materialist unbelief. It differs from many of its modern counterparts by offering not only what it claims is a true account of the nature of the universe but also a prescription for human's happiness in such a universe. No supernatural agents of any kind are active in nature or interfere in human life; hence there is no Providence to be feared or divine powers to be propitiated. There is no more survival of the person after death than there was life before birth; hence there is nothing to be feared or hoped for in a future state. The universe consists in material things and void (i.e., the emptiness in which the material things exist and move) . The ultimate constituents of things of all kinds are tiny, indestructible particles of which an infinite number are distributed in the void. The universe is infinite in extent, has no beginning, and will have no end. The earth and all living things are merely ephemera in the ever-changing configura­ tions of particles in the void. The universe was not created by divine power, nor was the earth designed for our convenience. We evolved with it out of the primordial supply of matter, and will disappear with the earth's decay. Hence life can be lived without fear of death, or gods, or any supernatural powers. Life is best lived in quiet friendship with those about you. Nothing a person can do is evil or forbidden per se, but many things are not to be done because they hurt others, and many things are not to be done except in moderation because they hurt oneself. The Epicurean acceptance of the evidence of the senses, its dismissal of metaphysical abstractions, and its rejection of Providence and im­ mortality in favor of what we might now call \"scientific materialism\" are not positions merely asserted as beneficial credos. They are sup­ ported by observation and argued for in detail. But in this detail we should try to guard against at least two misconceptions. The first concerns the Greek word atomos used by Epicurus and regularly translated as \"atom. \" To the Greek, atomos conveyed the literal sense \"uncuttable\" and hence \"indestructible,\" and that is what Epicurus meant: the ultimate building blocks of things were indestructi­ ble. But to us atoms are not indestructible; only too evidently they can be broken up into lesser entities. Lucretius too had problems with atomos. No readily available Latin word existed, and Lucretius had to resort to such phrases as \"primary bodies,\" \"first things,\" \"primordial particle. \" In the following extracts we therefore followed Lucretius rather than Epicurus in order to avoid the now misleading connotations of \"atom.\" The second possible misconception concerns Epicurus' and Lucre­ tius' references to, and naming of, gods. It may be that the Epicureans did not feel strong enough to deny the existence of gods, especially when these were so closely identified with the integrity of the state, or\n\nTHE FOUNT OF UNBELIEF: EPICURUS AND LUCRETIUS\n\n19\n\nthey may have genuinely concurred i n this matter with the vox populi. But it is the account they give of gods, not any denial of their existence, which makes their system fundamentally atheistical not only from the viewpoint of most ancient cults but emphatically from the Christian or Muslim point of view. The Epicurean gods are not creators of the universe or of anything in it; they are a creation ofthe material universe having some sort of permanent body. Moreover these gods do not concern themselves with us. They exist in \"complete tranquility, aloof and detached from our affairs . . . exempt from any need of us, indif­ ferent to our merits and immune from anger\" (Lucretius, II, 646 - 5 1 ) . In short, the verbal appearance o f gods remains i n the Epicurean phi­ losophy, but the appearance is only used for the purposes of poetic conceit or to instantiate an ideal of happiness which it may be useful for us to contemplate. The account of physical nature that was adopted and made famous by Epicurus was not in fact originated by him, but by the little-known Leucippus and his younger contemporary Democritus (c. 460 - 370 B.C.). Only fragments by and short paraphrases of Democritus survive. But for our present purposes it is not necessary to distinguish his thought from that of Epicurus, nor that of Epicurus from his apparently faithful exponent Lucretius. We are concerned with the system as a whole and as a whole Epicureanism (or \"Greek Atomism\" or \"Classical Materialism\") is the principal representation of unbelief in the ancient world. The Epicurean account of the universe and of humanity's place in it was all but extinguished by the religious \"sickness\" (the word is used by Diogenes of Oenoanda, one of the last of the ancient Epicureans) which overwhelmed free thought in the third to fifth centuries of our era. As republished in the sixteenth century, this account infused the revolutionary ideas of Giordano Bruno, Hobbes, Gassendi, and others, not only to give a tremendous ideological boost to the development of modern science, but also to suggest again the possibility of a totality in which the fear of death and concern with supernatural agencies need play no part. One final point: The reader may feel that what follows - a sequence of passages from Epicurus followed in some cases with Lucretius' am­ plification of the same ideas - is not a real contribution to unbelief because it does not explicitly refute the religious beliefs that have been dominant since antiquity. That is precisely its significance. The Epicu­ reans did not have to react against a monolithic religion which almost everyone had accepted as true. Theirs was a comparatively unfettered attempt to understand the nature of things without reference to super­ natural agents: an attempt which no one would ever be able to make again in the same terms after the triumph of monotheism. But it is the attempt that provides the fundamental alternative to monotheism rather than merely a critical refutation of it.\n\n20\n\nGASKIN\n\nClassical Materialism From Epicurus' \"Letter to Herodotus\" and Lucretius' De Rerum Na­ tura. The complete \"Letter\" is only about twenty pages long. 1 . Matter cannot be created or destroyed. Epicurus: Now that this [to use our senses as the foundation of all our investigations] has been established we must consider the phenomena that cannot be perceived by the senses. The first principle is that nothing can be created from the non-existent: for otherwise any thing would be formed from any thing without the need of seed. If all that disappears were destroyed into the non-existent, all matter would be destroyed, since that into which it would be dissolved has no existence. Truly this universe has always been such as it now is, and so it shall always be; for there is nothing into which it can change, and there is nothing outside the universe that can enter into it and bring about a change. Lucretius I, 146- 58, 215 - 6: This dread and darkness of the mind cannot be dispelled by the sunbeams, the shining shafts of day, but only by an understanding of the outward form and inner workings of nature. In tackling this theme, our starting point will be this principle: Nothing can ever be created by divine power out of nothing. The reason why all mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening on the earth and in the sky with no discernible cause, and these they attribute to the will of a god. Accordingly, when we have seen that nothing can be created out of nothing, we shall then have a clearer picture of the path ahead, the problem of how things are created and occasioned without the aid of the gods. . . . The second great principle is this: nature resolves everything into its component particles and never reduces anything to nothing. 2. The universe consists of matter and void. Matter is composed of indestructible particles. Epicurus: Moveover, the universe consists of material bodies and void. That the bodies exist is made clear to all by sensation itself, on which reason must base its judgment in regard to what is impercepti­ ble, as I have said above. If that which we call \"void\" and \"space\" and \"the untouchable\" did not exist, the particles of matter would have no place in which to exist or through which to move, as it is clear they do move. In addition to these two, there is nothing that we can grasp in the mind, either through concepts or through analogy with concepts, that has real existence and is not referred to merely as a property or an accident of material things or of the void. Of material things, some are compounds, others are the simple parti­ cles from which the compounds are formed. The particles are indivisi­ ble and unchangeable, as is necessary if all is not to be dissolved to\n\nTHE FOUNT OF UNBELIEF: EPICURUS AND LUCRETIUS\n\n21\n\nnothing, but something strong is to remain after the dissolution of the compounds, something solid, which cannot be destroyed in any way. Therefore, it is necessary that the first beginnings be indivisible parti­ cles of matter. 3. The universe is infinite. Epicurus: Moreover, the universe as a whole is infinite, for whatever is limited has an outermost edge to limit it, and such an edge is defined by something beyond. Since the universe does not have an edge, it has no limit; and since it lacks a limit, it is infinite and unbounded. More­ over, the universe is infinite both in the number of its indestructible particles and in the extent of its void. If, on the one hand, the void were infinite and matter finite, the particles would not remain anywhere but would be carried away and scattered through the infinite void, since there would be no atoms from without to support them and hold them together by striking them. If, on the other hand, the void were finite, there would not be room in it for an infinite number of atoms. Lucretius I, 958 - 83: Learn, therefore, that the universe is not bounded in any direction. If it were, it would necessarily have a limit somewhere. But clearly a thing cannot have a limit unless there is something outside to limit it, so that the eye can follow it up to a certain point but not beyond. Since you must admit that there is nothing outside the universe, it can have no limit and is accordingly without end or measure. It makes no odds in which part of it you may take your stand: whatever spot anyone may occupy, the universe stretches away from him just the same in all directions without limit. Suppose for a moment that the whole of space were bounded and that someone made his way to its uttermost boundary and threw a flying dart. Do you choose to suppose that the missile, hurled with might and main, would speed along the course on which it was aimed? Or do you think some­ thing would block the way and stop it? You must assume one alterna­ tive or the other. But neither of them leaves you a loophole. Both force you to admit that the universe continues without end. Whether there is some obstacle lying on the boundary line that prevents the dart from going farther on its course or whether it flies on beyond, it cannot in fact have started from the boundary. With this argument I will pursue you. Wherever you may place the ultimate limit of things, I will ask you: \"Well then, what does happen to the dart?\" The upshot is that the boundary cannot stand firm anywhere, and final escape from this con­ clusion is precluded by the limitless possibility of running away from it. 4. Particle types are limited; the number of particles of each type is infinite. Epicurus: In addition, the indivisible, solid particles of matter, from which composite bodies are formed and into which such bodies are dissolved, exist in so many different shapes that the mind cannot grasp\n\nl\n\n22\n\nGASKIN\n\ntheir number; for it would not be possible for visible objects to exhibit such great variation in form and quality if they were made by repeated use of particles of conceivable variety. The number of particles of each shape is infinite; but the number of varieties cannot be infinite, only inconceivably great. Lucretius II, 4 78 - 499: To the foregoing demonstration I will link on another fact which will gain credence from this context: the number of different forms ofprimordial particles is finite. If it were not so, some of them would have to be of infinite magnitude. Within the narrow limits of any single particle, there can be only a limited range of forms. Suppose that particles consist of three minimum parts, or enlarge them by a few more. When by fitting on parts at top or bottom and transpos­ ing left and right you have exhausted every shape that can be given to the whole body by all possible arrangements of the parts, you are obviously left with no means of varying its form further except by adding other parts. Thence it will follow, if you wish to vary its form still further, that the arrangement will demand still other parts in exactly the same way. Variation in shape goes with increase in size. You cannot believe, therefore, that the particles are distinguished by an infinity of forms; or you will compel some of them to be of enormous magnitude, which I have already proved to be demonstrably impossible. 5. The particles which compose matter move continuously and without a beginning of motion. Epicurus: Indestructible particles move without interruption through all time. Some of them fall in a straight line; some swerve from their courses; and others move back and forth as the result of collisions. These last make up the objects that our senses recognize. Some of those that move in this way after collisions separate far from each other; the others maintain a vibrating motion, either closely entangled with each other or confined by other atoms that have become entangled. There are two reasons for this continued vibration. The nature of the void that separates each of the particles from the next permits it, for the void is not able to offer any resistance; and the elasticity that is characteristic of the particles causes them to rebound after each collision. The de­ gree of entanglement of the particles determines the extent of the recoil from the collision. These motions had no beginning, for the primordial particles and the void have always existed. If all these things are remembered, a statement as brief as this pro­ vides a sufficient outline for our understanding of the nature of that which exists. 6. The number of worlds like or unlike our own is infinite. Epicurus: Finally, the number of worlds, some like ours and some unlike, is also infinite. For the particles are infinite in number, as has\n\nTHE FOUNT OF UNBELIEF: EPICURUS AND LUCRETIUS\n\n23\n\nbeen shown above, and they move through the greatest distances. The particles suited for the creation and maintenance of a world have not been used up in the formation of a single world or of a limited number of them, whether like our world or different from it. There is nothing therefore that will stand in the way of there being an infinite number of worlds. Lucretius II, 1 052 - 1 076: Granted, then, that empty space extends without limit in every direction and that seeds innumerable in number are rushing on countless courses through an unfathomable universe under the impulse of perpetual motion, it is in the highest degree unlikely that this earth and sky is the only one to have been created and that all those particles of matter outside are accomplishing nothing. This follows from the fact that our world has been made by nature through the spontaneous and casual collision and the multifarious, accidental, random and purposeless congregation and coalescence of particles whose suddenly formed combinations could serve on each occasion as the starting-point of substantial fabrics - earth and sea and sky and the races of living creatures. On every ground, therefore, you must admit that there exists elsewhere other congeries of matter similar to this one which the ether clasps in ardent embrace. When there is plenty of matter in readiness, when space is available and no cause or circumstance impedes, then surely things must be wrought and effected. You have a store of particles that could not be reckoned in full by the whole succession of living creatures. You have the same natural force to congregate them in any place precisely as they have been congregated here. You are bound therefore to acknowl­ edge that in other regions there are other earths and various tribes of men and breeds of beasts. 7. Our sense perceptions are physical emissions from material things striking our sense organs. Thought itself is a species of particle movement. [Epicurus' account of sense perception is here omitted as being too technical and not directly relevant to the theme of the present work.) 8. The primary particles that compose matter themselves possess only the characteristics of size, mass, shape and motion. Matter is not infinitely divisible. [omitted] 9. The soul, or that which distinguishes a living thingfrom a dead thing, is a material entity of a refined sort. The possibility of sensation depends upon its union with the body. Death is the dissolution of that union and is therefore nothing to us . Epicurus: Next, referring to the sensations and the feelings as the most certain foundation for belief, we must see that, in general terms,\n\n24\n\nGASKIN\n\nthe soul is a finely divided, material thing, scattered through the whole aggregation of particles that make up the body, most similar to breath with a certain admixture of heat, in some ways resembling the one, in some ways the other. But there is also a part of the soul that goes beyond even these two in fineness, and for this reason it is more ready to share in the feelings of the body. All this is made evident to us by the powers of the soul, that is, by its feelings, its rapidity of action, its rational faculties, and its possession of those things whose loss brings death to us. N ext, we must conclude that the primary cause of sensation is in the soul; yet it would not have acquired sensation if it had not been in some way enclosed by the rest of the body. But the rest of the body, having given the soul the proper setting for experiencing sensation, has itself also gained from the soul a certain share in this capacity. Yet it does not fully share with the soul, and for this reason when the soul departs, the body no longer experiences sensation; for the body did not have this capacity in itself but made sensation possible for that other that had come into existence along with it, namely the soul. The soul, thanks to the power perfected in it by the motions of the body, at once bringing to completion its own power to experience sensation, returned a share of this power to the body because of their close contact and common feelings, as I have said. For this reason, sensation is never lost while the soul remains, even though the other parts of the body have been destroyed. Indeed, even if a portion of the soul is lost with the loss in whole or in part of that portion of the body that enclosed it, if any part at all of the soul survives, it will still experience sensation; but when the rest of the body survives both as a whole and part by part, it has no sensation if that collection of particles, small though it be, that makes up the soul has been lost. However, if the whole body is destroyed, the soul is scattered and no longer enjoys the same powers and motions; and as a result, it no longer possesses sensation. Whenever that in which the soul has existed is no longer able to confine and hold it in, we cannot think of the soul as still enjoying sensation, since it would no longer be within its proper system and would no longer have the use of the appropriate motions. Moreover, we must clearly observe this also, that the word \"incor­ poreal\" in its common use is applied only to that which we can think of as existing by itself. Now there is no incorporeal thing that we can think of as existing by itself except the void. The void can neither act nor be acted upon; it only gives to corporeal things a space though which to move. Therefore, those who say that the soul is incorporeal are talking nonsense; for in that case the soul would be unable to act or be acted upon, and we clearly see that the soul is capable of both. Lucretius III, 94 - 7, 1 61 - 1 76, 445 - 58: First, I maintain that the mind, which we often call the intellect, the seat of the guidance and\n\nTHE FOUNT OF UNBELIEF: EPICURUS AND LUCRETIUS\n\n25\n\ncontrol of life, is part of a man, no less than hand or foot or eyes are parts of a whole living creature . . . . The same reasoning proves that mind and spirit are both composed of matter. We see them propelling the limbs, rousing the body from sleep, changing the expression of the face and guiding and steering the whole man -activities that all clearly involve touch, as touch in turn involves matter. How then can we deny their material nature? You see the mind sharing in the body's experiences and sympathizing with it. When the nerve-racking impact of a spear gashes bones and sinews, even if it does not penetrate to the seat of life, there ensues faintness and a tempting inclination earthwards and on the ground a turmoil in the mind and an intermittent faltering impulse to stand up again. The substance of the mind must therefore be material, since it is affected by the impact of material weapons. . . . Again, we are conscious that mind and body are born together, grow up together and together decay. With the weak and delicate frame of wavering childhood goes a like infirmity of judgment. The robust vigor of ripening years is accompanied by a steadier resolve and a maturer strength of mind. Later, when the body is palsied by the potent forces of age and the limbs begin to droop with blunted vigor, the under­ standing limps, the tongue falters and the mind totters: everything weakens and gives way at the same time. It is thus natural that the vital spirits should all evaporate like smoke, soaring into the gusty air, and we have seen that it shares the body's birth and growth and wearies with the weariness of age. [There follow about four hundred lines of concentrated argument to show that a person does not survive bodily death. Book III concludes with Lucretius' eloquent and justly famous plea to accept our mortality and free ourselves from fear of death. See a translation in the concluding section of this book.] 10. No supernatural agent directs or is identical with any heavenly body or earthly event. Epicurus: Now as to celestial phenomena, we must believe that these motions, periods, eclipses, risings, settings, and the like do not take place because there is some divinity in charge of them, who so arranges them in order and will maintain them in that order, and who at the same time enjoys both perfect happiness and immortality; for activity and anxiety, anger and kindness are not in harmony with blessedness, but are found along with weakness, fear, and dependence on one's neigh­ bors. We must also avoid the belief that masses of concentrated fire have attained a state of divine blessedness and undertaken these mo­ tions of their own free will. . . . In addition to these general matters, we must observe this also, that there are three things that account for the major disturbances in men's minds. First, they assume that the celestial bodies are blessed and\n\nI\n\nl\n\n26\n\nGASKIN\n\neternal yet have impulses, actions, and purposes quite inconsistent with divinity. Next, they anticipate and foresee eternal suffering as depicted in the myths, or even fear the very lack of consciousness that come with death as if this could be of concern to them. Finally, they suffer all this, not as a result of reasonable conjecture, but through some sort of unreasoning imagination; and since in imagination they set no limit to suffering, they are beset by turmoil as great as if there were a reason­ able basis for their dread, or even greater. But it is peace of mind to have been freed from all this and to have constantly in memory the essential principles of the whole system of belief. We must therefore turn our minds to immediate feelings and sensations - in matters of general concern to the common feelings and sensations of mankind, in personal matters, to our own -and to every immediate evidence from each of the means of judgment. If we heed these, we shall rightly track down the sources of disturbance and fear, and when we have learned the causes of celestial phenomena and of the other occasional happen­ ings, we shall be free from what other men most dread. Lucretius V, 64 - 90, 1 95 - 99: The next stage in the argument is this. I must first demonstrate that the world also was born and is composed of a mortal body. Then I must deal with the concourse of matter that laid the foundation of land, sea and sky, stars and sun and globe of the moon. I must show what living things have existed on earth, and which have never been born; how the human race began to employ various utterances among themselves for denoting various things; and how there crept into their minds that fear of the gods which, all the world over, sanctifies temples and lakes, groves and altars and images of the gods. After that, I will explain by what forces nature steers the courses of the sun and the journeyings of the moon, so that we shall not suppose that they run their yearly races between heaven and earth of their own free will with the amiable intention of promoting the growth of crops and animals, or that they are rolled round in furtherance of some divine plan. For it may happen that men who have learnt the truth about the carefree existence of the gods fall to wondering by what power the universe is kept going, especially those movements that are seen over­ head in the borderland of ether. Then the poor creatures are plunged back into their old superstitions and saddle themselves with cruel mas­ ters whom they believe to be all-powerful. All this because they do not know what can be and what cannot: how a limit is fixed to the power of everything and an immovable frontier post. . . . Even if I knew nothing of primordial particles, I would venture to assert on the evidence of the celestial phenomena themselves, sup­ ported by many other arguments, that the universe was certainly not created for us by divine power: so great are the faults with which it stands endowed.\n\n2 CLASS ICAL S K E PTI C I S M : C I C E RO A N D S EXTU S EM P I RI C U S AGA I N ST K N OWLEDGE OF T H E GODS\n\nIt is overwhelmingly necessary to investigate our own capacity for knowledge. For if we are so constituted that we can know nothing, there is no call to enquire further into particular things. Eusebius (c. A.D. 260- 340) quoting a skeptic\n\nBiographical Note Cicero (106 - 43 B.C. ) , Roman aristocrat, politician, orator, and author of some of the best Latin prose ever written, was educated by talented teachers who represent all the main schools of philosophy, law and oratory, in Rome and Athens. His somewhat precarious public career spanned the last turbulent years of the Roman Republic. Because of the chance survival of over 800 of his private letters (rediscovered by Petrarch in 1 345), perhaps more is known about Cicero as a person than about any other human being who lived before the seventeenth century. His contribution to philosophy was made in the last three years of his life, when in rural retirement he composed a number of treatises (several in dialogue form) to make Greek philosophy accessi­ ble to Latin audiences. One of these was Concerning the Nature of the Gods from which the following passages are t ake n . Of the life of Sextus Empiricus, next to nothing is known except that he must have lived about A.D. 200 and that he was a physician, possibly of the empirical school as his name suggests. Three of his works survive: Outlines of Pyrrhonism (i.e. skepticism) from whose third Book the excerpt is taken, and two much longer and more detailed works gener­ ally grouped together under the title Adversus Mathematicos which, as R.G. Bury suggests, might be rendered Against the Professors ofall Arts and Sciences. The value of Sextus' writings is that he records a great bulk of skeptical argument which would otherwise have been lost in antiquity. 27\n\n28\n\nGASKIN\n\nPhilosophical Note Ancient skepticism has a long and complicated history going back to Pyrrho of Elis (c. 360 - 275 B . C . ) or earlier. The philosophical thrust of skepticism was a rejection of all claims to knowledge that exceed a simple statement of each fact as it appears to us. The psychological thesis of skepticism was that \" quietude\" could only be achieved by not embracing positive opinions which inevitably conflict with other posi­ tive opinions. The opinions that were mainly criticized were the \"dog­ matisms\" (Le., positive beliefs) of the Epicureans and Stoics. But when the Outlines resurfaced in Western Europe - in print in a Latin trans­ lation in 1 562 -its arguments were to provide ammunition against another dogmatism. The old skepticism also reappeared in the writings of Montaigne in the claim that Christian belief depends upon faith, not upon reason and evidence. In the extracts from Cicero, skepticism appears as philosophically acute criticisms of the monotheistic dispositions of the Stoic philoso­ phers. The criticisms almost certainly come from Carneades (c. 2 1 4 129 B . C . ) via Clitomachus. They are, as it were, academic criticisms of theology in the ancient world. They reappear, for example, in Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. The chapter quoted from Sextus does not attempt to argue against the common opinion that there are gods since that would itself involve the illegitimate positive affirmation that there are not. It simply seeks to oppose arguments that there are gods in order to lead to the typical skeptical suspense of judgment on the subject. Within three centuries of Sextus, and then for more than a thousand years, such a suspense of judgment would at best be regarded as a catastrophic misfortune for the unbeliever, and at worst as an evil to be eradicated by all the cruelty that human ingenuity could devise. Sections 1 and 2 that follow are taken from Cicero's De Natura Deorum (Concerning the Nature of the Gods) Book III, Chapters 1 0 - 1 1 and 35 - 39, respectively. Both are from speeches by Cotta, who repre­ sents the skeptical critic. The Epicurean and Stoic views are put by other speakers. Section 3 is from Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrr­ honism, Book I, Chapter 6 and Book III, Chapter 3 .\n\n1.\n\nThe Natural Origin of Order\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum, III, Chapters 10- 1 1 1 0 I f the world as a whole i s not god, neither are the stars, which in all their countless numbers you wanted to reckon as gods, enlarging with delight upon their uniform and everlasting movements. And I protest you do this with good reason, for they display a marvelous and\n\nCLASSICAL SKEPTICISM: CICERO AND SEXTUS EMPIRICUS\n\n29\n\nextraordinary regularity. But not all things, Balbus, that have fixed and regular courses are to be accredited to a god rather than to nature. What occurrence do you think could possibly be more regular than the repeated alternation of flow in the Euripus at Chalcis? or in the Straits of Messina? or than the eddying ocean-currents in the region where Europe and Libya by the hurrying wave Are sundered? Cannot the tides on the coasts of Spain or Britain ebb and flow at fixed intervals of time without a god's intervention? Why, if all motions and all occurrences that preserve a constant periodic regularity are de­ clared to be divine, pray shall we not be obliged to say that tertian and quartan agues are divine too, for nothing can be more regular than the process of their recurrence? But all such phenomena call for a rational explanation; and in your inability to give such an explanation you fly for refuge to a god. Also you admired the cleverness of an argument of Chrysippus, who was undoubtedly an adroit and hardy thinker (I apply the adjective \"adroit\" to persons of nimble wit, and \"hardy\" to those whose minds have grown hard with use as the hand is hardened by work); well, Chrysippus argues thus: \"If anything exists that man is not capable of creating, he that creates that thing is superior to man; but man is not capable of creating the objects that we see in the world; therefore he that was capable of so doing surpasses man; but who could surpass man save god? therefore god exists. \" The whole o f this i s involved i n the same mistake as the argument of Zeno; no definition is given of the meaning of \"superior\" and \"more excellent,\" or of the distinction between nature and reason. Chrysippus furthermore declares that, if there be no gods, the natural universe contains nothing superior to man; but for any man to think that there is nothing superior to man he deems to be the height of arrogance. Let us grant that it is a mark of arrogance to value oneself more highly than the world; but not merely is it not a mark of arrogance, rather is it a mark of wisdom, to realize that one is a conscious and rational being, and that Orion and Canicula are not. Again, he says \"If we saw a handsome mansion, we should infer that it was built for its masters and not for mice; so therefore we must deem the world to be the mansion of the gods.\" Assuredly I should so deem it if I thought it had been built like a house, and not constructed by nature, as I shall show that it was. 1 1 But then you tell me that Socrates, in Xenophon's account, asks the question, if the world contains no rational soul, where did we pick up ours? And I too ask the question, where did we get the faculty of speech, the knowledge of numbers, the art of music? unless indeed we suppose that the sun holds conversation with the moon when their\n\n30\n\nGASKIN\n\ncourses approximate, or that the world makes a harmonious music, as Pythagoras believes. These faculties, Balbus, are the gifts of nature ­ not nature \"walking craftsmanlike manner\" as Zeno says (and what this means we will consider in a moment), but nature by its own motions and mutations imparting motion and activity to all things. And so I fully agreed with the part of your discourse that dealt with nature's punctual regularity, and what you termed its concordant interconnexion and correlation; but I could not accept your assertion that this could not have come about were it not held together by a single divine breath. On the contrary, the system's coherence and persistence is due to nature's forces and not to divine power; she does possess that \"con­ cord\" (the Greek term is sympatheia) of which you spoke, but the greater this is as a spontaneous growth, the less possible is it to suppose that it was created by divine reason.\n\n2. The Indifference of the Gods Cicero, De Natura Deorum, III, Chapters 35 - 39 Now let us consider the next topics - first whether the world is ruled by divine providence, and then whether the gods have regard for the affairs of mankind. For these are the two that I have left of the heads into which you divided the subject; and if you gentlemen approve, I feel that they require a somewhat detailed discussion. . . 35 Well, Dionysius was not struck dead with a thunderbolt by Olympian Jupiter, nor did Aesculapius cause him to waste away and perish of some painful and lingering disease. He died in his bed and was laid upon a royal pyre, and the power which he had himself secured by crime he handed on as an inheritance to his son as a just and lawful sovereignty. It is with reluctance that I enlarge upon this topic, since you may think that my discourse lends authority to sin; and you would be justified in so thinking, were not an innocent or guilty conscience so powerful a force in itself, without the assumption of any divine design. Destroy this, and everything collapses; for just as a household or a state appears to lack all rational system and order if in it there are no rewards for right conduct and no punishments for transgression, so there is no such thing at all as the divine governance of the world if that govern­ ance makes no distinction between the good and the wicked. \"But,\" it may be objected, \"the gods disregard smaller matters, and do not pay attention to the petty farms and paltry vines of individuals, and any trifling damage done by blight or hail cannot have been a matter for the notice of Jupiter; even kings do not attend to all the petty affairs in their kingdom\": this is how you argue. As if forsooth it was Publius Rutilius's estate at Formiae about which I complained a little time ago, and not his loss of all security! .\n\nCLASSICAL SKEPTICISM: CICERO AND SEXTUS EMPIRICUS\n\n31\n\n36 But this is the way with all mortals: their external goods, their vineyards, cornfields and olive-yards, with their abundant harvests and fruits, and in short all the comfort and prosperity of their lives, they think of as coming to them from the gods; but virtue no one ever imputed to a god's bounty. And doubtless with good reason; for our virtue is a just ground for others' praise and a right reason for our own pride, and this would not be so if the gift of virtue came to us from a god and not from ourselves. On the other hand when we achieve some honor or some accession to our estate, or obtain any other of the goods or avoid any of the evils of fortune, it is then that we render thanks to the gods, and do not think that our own credit has been enhanced. Did anyone ever render thanks to the gods because he was a good man? No, but because he was rich, honored, secure. The reason why men give to Jupiter the titles of Best and Greatest is not that they think that he makes us just, temperate or wise, but safe, secure, wealthy, and opu­ lent. Nor did anyone ever vow to pay a tithe to Hercules if he became a wise man! It is true there is a story that Pythagoras used to sacrifice an ox to the Muses when he had made a new discovery in geometry! but I don't believe it, since Pythagoras refused even to sacrifice a victim to Apollo of Delos, for fear of sprinkling the altar with blood. However, to return to my point, it is the considered belief of all mankind that they must pray to god for fortune but obtain wisdom for themselves. Let us dedicate temples as we will to Intellect, Virtue and Faith, yet we perceive that these things are within ourselves; hope, safety, wealth, victory are blessings which we must seek from the gods. Accordingly the prosperity and good fortune of the wicked, as Diogenes used to say, disprove the might and power of the gods entirely. 37 \"But sometimes good men come to good ends.\" Yes, and we seize upon these cases and impute them with no reason to the immortal gods. Diagoras, named the Atheist, once came to Samothrace, and a certain friend said to him, \"You who think that the gods disregard men's affairs, do you not remark all the votive pictures that prove how many persons have escaped the violence of the storm, and come safe to port, by dint of vows to the gods? \"That is so,\" replied Diagoras; \"it is because there are nowhere any pictures of those who have been shipwrecked and drowned at sea.\" On another voyage he encountered a storm which threw the crew of the vessel into a panic, and in their terror they told him that they had brought it on themselves by having taken him on board their ship. He pointed out to them a number of other vessels making heavy weather on the same course, and inquired whether they supposed that those ships also had a Diagoras on board. The fact really is that your character and past life make no difference whatever as regards your fortune good or bad. \"The gods do not take notice of everything, any more than do human rulers,\" says our friend. Where is the parallel? If human rulers know-\n\n32\n\nGASKIN\n\ningly overlook a fault they are greatly to blame, but as for god, he cannot even offer the excuse of ignorance. And how remarkably you champion his cause, when you declare that the divine power is such that even if a person has escaped punishment by dying, the punishment is visited on his children and grandchildren and their descendantsl What a remarkable instance of the divine justicel Would any state tolerate a lawgiver who should enact that a son or grandson was to be sentenced for the transgression of a father or grandfather? Where shall the Tantalids' vendetta end? What penalty for Myrtilus's murder Shall ever glut the appetite of vengeance? Whether the Stoic philosophers were led astray by the poets, or the poets relied on the authority of the Stoics, I should find it hard to say; for both tell some monstrous and outrageous tales. For the victim lashed by the lampoons of Hipponax or the verses of Archilochus nursed a wound not inHicted by a god but received from himself; and we do not look for any heaven-sent cause when we view the licentious­ ness of Aegisthus or of Paris, since their guilt almost cries aloud in our ears; and the bestowal of health upon many sick persons I ascribe to Hippocrates rather than to Aesculapius; and I will never allow that Sparta received the Lacedaemonian rule of life from Apollo rather than from Lycurgus. It was Critolaus, I aver, who overthrew Corinth, and Hasdrubal Carthage: those two glories of the sea-coast were extin­ guished by these mortals, not be some angry god - who according to your school is entirely incapable of anger. But at all events a god could have come to the aid of those great and splendid cities and have preserved them. 39 For you yourselves are fond of saying that there is nothing that a god cannot accomplish, and that without any toil; as a man's limbs are effortlessly moved merely by his mind and will, so, as you say, the gods' power can mould and move and alter all things. Nor do you say this as some superstitious fable or old wives' tale, but you give a scientific and systematic account of it: you allege that matter, which constitutes and contains all things, is in its entirety Hexible and subject to change, so that there is nothing that cannot be molded and transmuted out of it however suddenly, but the moulder and manipulator of this universal substance is divine providence, and therefore providence, whither­ soever it moves, is able to perform whatever it will. Accordingly either providence does not know its own powers, or it does not regard human affairs, or it lacks power of judgment to discern what is the best. \"It does not care for individuals. \" This is no wonder; no mo"
