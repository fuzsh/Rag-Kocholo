        "text": "<strong>THE</strong> <strong>MINOR</strong> <strong>PLANET</strong> <strong>BULLETIN</strong> <strong>BULLETIN</strong> OF <strong>THE</strong> <strong>MINOR</strong> <strong>PLANET</strong>S SECTION OF <strong>THE</strong> ASSOCIATION OF LUNAR AND <strong>PLANET</strong>ARY OBSERVERS VOLUME 36, NUMBER 3, A.D. 2009 JULY-SEPTEMBER 77. PHOTOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF 343 OSTARA AND O<strong>THE</strong>R ASTEROIDS AT HOBBS OBSERVATORY Lyle Ford, George Stecher, Kayla Lorenzen, and Cole Cook Department of Physics and Astronomy University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Eau Claire, WI 54702-4004 fordla@uwec.edu (Received: 2009 Feb 11) We observed 343 Ostara on 2008 October 4 and obtained R and V standard magnitudes. The period was found to be significantly greater than the previously reported value of 6.42 hours. Measurements of 2660 Wasserman and (17010) 1999 CQ72 made on 2008 March 25 are also reported. We made R band and V band photometric measurements of 343 Ostara on 2008 October 4 using the 0.6 m “Air Force” Telescope located at Hobbs Observatory (MPC code 750) near Fall Creek, Wisconsin. Sixty second 2x2 binned exposures were taken with an Apogee Alta U55 camera. Additional details on the telescope can be found in Stecher et al. (1999). Images were dark-subtracted and flat-fielded. Photometric transforms were found using Landolt standard stars from the LONEOS catalog and first order extinction coefficients were determined using the modified Hardie method as described in Warner (2006). Data were analyzed using MPO Canopus version 9.3.1.0 (Warner 2007). Our data can be obtained from http://www.uwec.edu/physics/ asteroid/.

Warner, B.D. (2007). MPO Software, Canopus version 9.3.1.0, Bdw Publishing, http://minorplanetobserver.com/ The V data for 343 Ostara are shown in Figure 1. The R data are similar but with larger errors. The magnitude of 343 Ostara varied between about 13.67 and 13.87 in V and 13.22 and 13.43 in R. No extrema were evident in the lightcurve, indicating that its period is significantly longer than the 8.4 hours of our observing run. This finding is in contradiction with the period of 6.42 hours reported by Binzel (1987). We also report measurements of 2660 Wasserman and (17010) 1999 CQ72 made on 2008 March 25. Measurements of 2660 Wasserman indicated an average R magnitude of 15.05 and an average V magnitude of 14.47. The variation was small compared to the scatter in the data, which was about 0.1 magnitudes. Over a 2.6 hour stretch, (17010) 1999 CQ72 exhibited a 0.5 magnitude variation in both V and R, with average values of 15.62 in V and 15.07 in R. Figure 1.
