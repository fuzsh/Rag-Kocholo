        "text": "Exploration\n\nIn 1851, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society, Burton completed the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage of Muslims to Mecca and Medina, disguised as a sheikh. Having made sketches and extensive notes throughout his journey, his subsequent publication on the expedition became hugely popular, and made him a household name.\n\nBurton went on to visit Harar, in modern-day Ethiopia, considered the fourth holiest city of Islam, Burton himself noted a local belief that, “with the entrance of the first Christian, Harar with fall’. He also visited Berbera, in Somalia, where he learnt about the ‘inland sea’ spoken about by the local traders. Burton believed that this might be the source of the Nile, which had eluded generations of travellers and explorers.\n\nWith further support from the RGS, Burton set off from the Zanzibar coast with John Hanning Speke, who had joined him on his expedition to Harar and Berbera, and a retinue of 132 porters. One of the number in the search of the source of the River Nile was Sidi Mubarak Bombay, a waYao explorer from the border of Tanzania and Mozambique. Bombay was enslaved at 12 years old and taken to Gujarat. Freed after the death of his enslaver, Bombay returned to East Africa where he met Speke. Bombay went on to participate in many expeditions across Africa with many leading European explorers such as Burton, Henry Morton Stanley. Burton described him as “the gem of the party”.\n\nIt was a torturous three-year journey and both Burton and Speke fell dangerously ill. However they made it to Lake Tanganyika – the largest of the African Great Lakes – the first westerners to do so. En route, they had been made aware of another lake, and with Burton too ill to continue, Speke took a small party north. He came across the southern shore of a great expanse of water that he identified as the source of the Nile and named Lake Victoria, after the Queen. However, Burton disagreed with Speke’s conclusion and on return to the UK the debate escalated into a public and very personal argument that played out in newspapers and academic journals. Despite both being awarded the RGS Gold Medal for their achievements, the disagreement would go onto haunt Burton and mar his reputation. In 1864 a debate was organised between the two explorers in Bath. But it never went ahead – Speke was killed in a hunting accident on his uncle’s nearby estate the afternoon before the debate. Rumours quickly circulated that Burton was to blame, which, although false, followed him throughout his subsequent career as a diplomat.\n\nThe Mausoleum\n\nShaped like a tent the couple had designed for expeditions into the Syrian desert, the cloth has been beautifully carved from sandstone to look like it ripples in the breeze. A scalloped pelmet that runs around the building is decorated with the reversed Islamic star-and-crescent motif embossed with gold. At the very top of the tent is a gold leaf coated Star of Bethlehem. Inside, are a collection of lanterns from Syria. Camel bells have been strung from the ceiling and would have jingled when the door opened.\n\nBurton is recorded as having said to Isabel, ‘I should like us both to be in a tent, side by side’ and so it is fitting that the mausoleum holds them both – the ornately carved and gilded coffin belongs to Sir Richard Burton, and the plainer mahogany one belongs to Isabel.\n\nHabitats & Heritage are fundraising carry out essential repairs to the mausoleum and create an outreach programme to better understand Burton and his legacy.
