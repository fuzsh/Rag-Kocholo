        "text": "COLONIAL DISCOURSES\n\nSeries Two: Imperial Adventurers and Explorers\n\nPart 1: The Papers of Sir Richard Burton (1821-1890) from the Wiltshire and Swindon Record Office\n\nDetailed Listing\n\nThis listing is based on three separate sources. Firstly, the brief catalogue of the Arundell Collection at the Wiltshire and Swindon Record Office; secondly, on the notes made by Mary S Lovell in 1995, during the work that she undertook for her biography of Burton (which was published in 1998); thirdly, on our own detailed examination of the manuscripts at the time of filming. We are grateful to WSRO and Mary Lovell for permission to make use of their listings.\n\nPAPERS OF SIR RICHARD BURTON, EXPLORER, DIPLOMAT AND HUSBAND OF ISABEL ARUNDELL\n\nArundel Collection [date of accession by WRO 14/7/93]\n\nBurton 2667/26 (7 boxes)\n\nREEL 1\n\nBox 1: “Scrapbooks/Genealogy” - containing 7 Scrapbooks\n\n2667 26/1/1 Late 19 cent.\n\nA volume of notes on the genealogy of Sir Richard Burton.\n\n1. Large Scrapbook (brown) with handwritten note on front:\n\nNotes on Burton Genealogy collected at different times by Isabel Burton (signed)\n\nContains particulars of Richard Burton’s family and ancestry, mainly in Tuam (or Galway)\n\n2667 26/1/2 1893 Copies of reviews of Isabel Burton’s book ‘Life of Richard Burton’.\n\n2. Hardbound scrapbook entitled by hand:\n\nRomeikes and Curtice cuttings on ‘Life’ 1893 (nb: Romeikes and Curtice is a press cuttings agent)\n\nContents are several hundred reviews of IB’s 'Life of Richard Burton'.\n\nA few selected at random:\n\nScottish Leader 9/5/1893 “Literary Notes” -\n\n“In his lifetime he was known with somewhat dubious reputation, chiefly as the translator of ‘Arabian Nights’, a work filled with as little for the Boarding school as the edifying memoirs of M, de Casanova. But the books in which he has related many of his adventures in foreign lands are full of interest and excitement, with as much romance as falls to the lot of nineteenth century travellers…”\n\nTalk 2/8/1893 p.843 -\n\n“…On the whole, having read all she has to day in his defence, I incline to think that Lady Burton was justified in her action in the matter of the Scented Garden. And I fancy that the outcry would not have been heard, indeed that it would never have been made, had the loss by fire been merely to scholars and not to the dealers in, and lovers of, pornography…however, it does seem a pity that it never occurred to Lady Burton to hand the manuscript over to the authorities of the British Museum where it might have been accessible to scholars. [goes on to speak of IB’s righteous feminine scorn of those who condemn her action]: . . . If her work will not rank besides that of the great biographies of great men, she may at least congratulate herself that she has produced a book which will be read and returned to with great pleasure and interest. High as the reputation of Sir Richard Burton stood before . . . it stands higher than ever now . . . ”\n\nEvening News 29/7/1893 -\n\n[cutting saying that IB had returned to ‘Our Cottage’ at Mortlake where she was ill].\n\nDaily Graphic 14/7/1893 Reviews of “the Life” -\n\n“ . . . she should have felt less and written better . . .”\n\n[most reviewers appear to feel that her admitted ‘idolatry’ of RFB was not a good base for a biographer. It makes her, said one ‘unfit for the venture’ (Glasgow Evening News 20/7/1893)]\n\nCommerce 9/8/1893 p258 -\n\nPicture of IB ‘as a bride’ ‘Burton’s room at Trieste’\n\nSt James Budget 4/8/1893\n\n“Decidedly, the book of the hour.”\n\nBlack & White 19/8/1893 n.p.\n\nPicture of Burton’s Smoking Divan at Trieste\n\nSpectator 19/8/1893\n\nContradiction by W.A. Greenhill of RFB’s memory that he met Arnold\n\n[note that there are many overseas reviews indicating that the book found its way to America, Australia and New Zealand very quickly]\n\n2667 26/1/3 1894-1895 Copies of reviews of Arabian Nights.\n\n3. Another Press Cuttings Book, written in IB’s hand:\n\nArabian Nights - Cuttings date from Oct 1894 - Feb 1895.\n\nSome excerpts:\n\nMorning Post [date?]\n\n“A new edition is to be edited by Mr Leonard C. Smithers who purposes to restore 4/5ths of the matter annulled in the edition prepared for the press by (if we remember rightly) Mr Justin McCarthy, and known as ‘Lady Burton’s Edition . . .’”\n\nWestminster Gazette [undated]\n\n“A new and elaborate limited edition of Sir RFB’s translation of A Thousand and One Nights, and Supplemental Nights will be shortly announced by H.S.Nicholls and Sons. It will be in 12 vols, royal octavo (like the original) and bound in black and gold. The text is taken from Sir Richard’s own copy and will have all his latest additions improvements and corrections, and it is edited by Leonard C. Smithers. The price of the 12 volumes is 6 guineas net, the date of the publication is fixed for November 30th.\n\nAs to expurgation, Lady Burton’s edition was a repeat of 10 volumes only of the first issue, 215 pages were omitted. In the forthcoming edition, which comprises the complete work, only about 50 pages will be excised. One reason for this seems to be the promise given by Sir RB to his subscribers that no cheap edition of the entire work would be produced . . .”\n\n[The Smither’s edition seems to have only left out the most contentious parts of the Terminal Essay, called by one reviewer ‘the most disgusting appendix ...’]\n\n2667 26/1/4 c1895 Cuttings of reviews of Arabian Nights and sundry events of interest to Isabel Burton.\n\n4. Unbound scrapbook of cuttings regarding ‘the Arabian Nights’ and sundry events of interest to Isabel in general (animals, hospitals, Africa, people they’ve known, etc).

Discussions on female franchise.\n\n2667 26/1/5 c1890 Scrapbook of papers and letters about Burton’s death.\n\n5. Scrapbook entitled “General Comments, Death etc”\n\n[Letters addressed to IB at “Our Cottage” 2 Worple Road, Mortlake, London SW.] Obits [thousands]: ‘He was a man who delighted to shock and frighten prudish and timid people . . . ’\n\n“… a man of large literary attainments and ability, a man of untiring energy and restless activity, and one whose travels probably covered a wider range than those of any explorer of his time.”\n\nWashington Post\n\n2667 26/1/6 1886 A sketch of the career of Burton by Bates Richards, Wilson and St Clair Baddeley.\n\n6. 1886.

Some of the letters are very faint.\n\n1. F.O. ‘Blue Book’: Case of Captain Burton at Damascus.\n\n2. RFB to Sir Henry Elliott, June 9 1871 (re Bedouin raids in N. Syria). [Secretary’s hand copy]\n\n3. RFB to Sir Henry Elliott, November 21, 1870. (re: protection for British nationals resident in Syria).\n\n4.
