And— one wishes the names could be recalled!— the bodyguards in Somalia who kept an enraged nomad from disemboweling me and the UN representative who persuaded a Bedawin chief in the Arabian desert not to execute me for innocently violating tribal laws. Most of all I must thank relatives and friends who did a lot of hard work in helping the book progress, among them Edward Rice III, who located some rare works on Sufism and was responsible for much of the photo laboratory work, Christopher and Liza Rice, who generously made photocopies of the many versions of the book\n\nxiv Acknowledgments and gave editorial suggestions, Jan Elizabeth Strance, who helped pre­ pare the manuscript, and most of all, Susanna Franklin, who was an invaluable friend and confidante in many ways. Special thanks are due Constanza Clarke, Joan Ford, and the staff of the Hampton Library (Bridgehampton, New York) and the staff of the Suffolk County, New York, Library Association for locating a variety of works 'dealing with Burton and his age; Peter White for the use of an original edition of Burton’s Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night; Frances Colley for material on the British in Ceylon; and Frank Monaco and Lavinia Jones in London for unlimited help in finding books and photographs.\n\nA Note\n\non Sources\n\nThe sources drawn upon for this biography are many— a full list is given in the bibliography— but the most important must be identified here. The primary source for any book about Burton is, of course, Burton himself. His works are amazing in their range, detail, insight, erudition, complexity, and caustic humor. There is much biographical information buried in unexpected places and often disguised as an anecdote about “ an officer of my acquaintance” or in dialogues with imaginary people— “ Mr. John Bull,” for example— all ways in which Burton gives the reader information about himself or reveals states of mind or at­ titudes, telling stories about men who in the end are no other than Lieutenant Burton himself. The reader is referred to the bibliography for a complete list of Burton’s books. The next major source is Isabel Burton’s biography of her husband, the work upon which all others, for good or bad, must draw, The Life of Captain Sir RichJ F. Burton, K .C .M .G ., F .R .G .S., published in 1893. Lady Burton’s work is huge, rambling, and disorganized, and she re­ peatedly fails to give sources and dates. (“ Lady Burton was not a suitable person to write her husband’s biography,” snapped Norman Penzer,\n\nxv\n\nxvi A N o te on Sources Burton’s bibliographer.) But the book is a gold mine for those who would dig. Lady Burton has not only included three short autobio­ graphical chapters by Burton himself but almost “everything” else— not only the “ true” facts but the facts as she saw them, somewhat askew, and also personal opinions, observations, irrelevant anecdotes, stray thoughts and afterthoughts, letters, newspaper cuttings— what­ ever was on her desk at the moment and seemed appropriate. Burton’s three autobiographical fragments are unfortunately a skimpy source for what is known of his early years. The first and longest was dictated by Burton to his wife in the languid days aboard ship on their trip to India in 1876; it covers the period from his birth in 1821 to the end of his Indian years in 1849. Isabel claims to have reproduced it exactly as dictated, but one might question not only her accuracy (she seems to have erred on certain Indian and Persian names, which leads the reader to suspect other material) but also her reliability, for she was known to delete or rewrite what she disliked of her husband’s work. However, much of this material in the autobiographical fragments is barely more than an outline. Burton’s account of his initiation into the Nagar Brahmins needs fleshing out from other sources, as does his involvement with the renegade Persian nobleman the Agha Khan Mahallatl, his joining the Isma’llls, his initiation into the Qadiri broth­ erhood, the practice of the ecstatic Sufi sword dances, and the accounts of brothel life in various ports of call in India. The second section is a summary of the same material written for a friend, Francis Hitchman, who did the first full-length (but uncritical) biography of Burton. The third is a self-portrait of Burton (in the third person) as a secret service agent in western India. (This material originally appeared as an ap­ pendix in Burton’s Falconry in the Valley of the Indus, 1852.) From the period 1843 onward there is a profusion of autobiographical material in Burton’s own works, from his mystical searches to his addictions and obsessions. Burton’s niece, Georgiana Stisted, the daughter of his only sister, Lady Maria Stisted, gave the world a brief but still significant biography, The True Life of Capt. Sir Richard F. Burton [etc.], published in 1896. This work is rather short and is in part a refutation of Isabel Burton, whom she disliked intensely. Miss Stisted was able to draw upon her mother’s recollection of Burton as a child and young man, and she writes openly of the great passion in her uncle’s life, the mysterious\n\nA Note on Sources\n\nxvii\n\n“ Persian girl,” whom Isabel ignored. Miss Stisted has other material that Lady Burton also ignored, or saw differently, primarily on the matter of Burton’s religion. As a Roman Catholic, Isabel liked to think her husband was one, too, though of erratic sincerity. Miss Stisted was certain her uncle was a staunch but nonpracticing member of the Church of England. (His close friends believed he was either an agnostic or an atheist.) Thomas Wright’s The Life of Sir Richard Burton (1906), written after both Lady Burton and Miss Stisted had died, contains anecdotes and information lacking in the previous biographies and is useful in filling out otherwise blank episodes in Burton’s life, although one must watch for possible errors. Wright interviewed many of Burton’s friends and had access to letters and other unpublished material. However, unlike his subject, Wright was a prude: “ As regards Burton’s letters I have ruthlessly struck out every sentence that might give offense.” Today, many of Burton’s letters (and much other material) are sequestered in private or government collections and remain unread and unexamined. Isabel Burton had begun her own autobiography in collaboration with W. H. Wilkins but died before it was completed. Wilkins pub­ lished the book in 1897 as The Romance of Isabel Burton. Norman Penzer, always critical, states that “Wilkins’ participation . . . was not due to genuine admiration for Lady Burton but for reasons more personal” — he was apparently hoping to gain control of Burton’s literary estate. The nineteenth-century biographers deserve much credit for what they said of this amazing man, although they have their faults. How­ ever, all present a whitewashed version of Burton, the kind of man Victorian mothers would like their daughters to marry. Isabel and Georgiana passed over what might have been truly embarrassing— not only sexual episodes but political opinions as well. The first objective work about Burton was not a biography but a bibliography, Norman Penzer’s An Annotated Bibliography of Sir Richard Francis Burtcm, K .C .M .G . (19 2 1), with not only descriptions and prices of Burton’s works but much incidental information. Penzer’s comments and opinions and the fact that he could draw upon the memories of people who knew Burton, such as his personal physician, Dr. Frederick Grenville Baker, are of particular interest. During this and the next few decades, biographies of Burton tended\n\nxviii A Note on Sources to the “ that Blackguard Burton” type and are not to be considered seriously. Fawn Brodie’s The Devil Drives (1967) stands as the first attempt at a scholarly biography of Burton. Mrs. Brodie has unearthed material previously unpublished, lost, or unknown. The book can be seriously criticized for applying twentieth-century Freudian analysis to an individual of another century whose world was not West Coast suburban and academic America but revolutionary Europe, colonial Asia, unknown black Africa, and a Muslim Levant in turmoil. Lastly come the two volumes by Burton’s associate in the exploration of East and Central Africa, John Hanning Speke, who began as a friend and companion in danger and ended as an unyielding enemy. Speke’s two books, Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile and What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile, cover the same ground as Burton’s works on the same expedition but sound as if they were written about another part of Africa and about a different venture. Yet for all their anger, misjudgments, and errors, they are an essential commentary on a part of Burton’s life.\n\nAlphabets and Currencies\n\nThe transliteration of words and phrases from other alphabets— Arabic, Hindustani, Persian, etc.— is a problem that has baffled scholars for centuries. Burton’s contemporary, E. B. Eastwick, pointed out that in English there were thirteen ways in which to spell Muhammad (Mo­ hammed, Mohamet, Mahammad, etc.). Burton spelled by ear, and, one suspects, by whim. Thus, in his writings, the Indian province where he served appears as Scinde, Sindh, Scind, and Sind. He was as likely to write Paunjaub as Punjab or Panjab. He was also as likely to use a Persianized version of a word as the Arabic— tvuzu for wudu (properly wudu), and so on. The simplest method in quoting seems to be to use the spelling of the original writer but to follow contemporary academic spelling elsewhere. Thus, Burton’s Takiyyah is otherwise written taqiya, etc. So far as pronunciation is concerned, scholarly rules are complicated and tongue twisting. The simplest is an approximation. In any tran­ scription in this work, short a is “ uh” and long a is “ ah” ; short i as in “ it” and long i as in “ ee.” Short u as in “ uh” and long u as in “ oo.” Finally, o as in of and long o as in “ good.”\n\nxix\n\nxx A lphabets and C urrencies The transposing of nineteenth-century currency into late-twentiethcentury terms is also a problem. In the 1840s— Burton’s period in India— the rupee was worth 47^ U .S ., and the British pound was equivalent to $4.48 U .S. Burton often put money into terms of the Spanish dollar, a coin roughly equivalent to the American dollar. In the 1840s cotton weavers in the Manchester area of England earned an average wage of 9s. 6d. per week, about $2.28 U .S. In the United States, $1.0 0 per day was a good wage for “ common laborers.” The influx of work-hungry immigrants soon reduced that figure by about one-fifth. In the 1980s an unskilled laborer in the Texas oil fields earned $4.00 per hour for a ten-hour day. Is multiplying wages, prices, and money by a factor of forty a satisfactory way in which to figure? In some cases the ratio should probably be more like eighty to a hundred. Burton’s father paid £500 for his son’s army commission: $25,000 on today’s scales might be a fair though not necessarily accurate guess, and $100,000 (a factor of forty) seems exorbitant but possible. Burton es­ timated that the gold-wrapped cannons of the ruler of Baroda were worth £100,000 each, a figure almost beyond computation. Modem writers dealing with Burton’s time are usually content to leave figures as they were then reported. But this begs the issue to the detriment of the reader. When necessary, 1 have tried to make informed guesses, with, I hope, some degree of accuracy.\n\nCAP TAI N SI R R I C H A R D FRANCI S BURTON\n\nIntroduction\n\nI\n\nf a Victorian novelist o f the most romantic type had invented Capt. Sir Richard Francis Burton, the character might have been dismissed by both the public and critics in that most rational age as too extrem e, too unlikely. Burton was the paradigm o f the scholar-adventurer, a man who towered above others phys­ ically and intellectually, a soldier, scientist, explorer, and writer who for much o f his life also engaged in that most romantic o f careers, undercover agent. Burton was born in 1 8 2 1 and died in 1890, a crucial period in the history o f his country. Q ueen V ictoria was his sovereign and Karl M arx a fellow searcher in the reading rooms o f the great institutions o f London. T h e Industrial Revolution was in full bloom, turning the verdant countryside o f the English poets into slag heaps o f human misery; the European powers had divided the world rather raggedly into colonies, protectorates, and spheres o f influence; inventions that daily changed the tenor o f ordinary life arrived in an avalanche, and as literacy became\n\n2\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nwidespread, ideas o f all sorts— revolutionary, intellectual, sci­ entific, and political— percolated throughout the world with the force o f an epidemic. Burton was unique in any gathering except when he was de­ liberately working in disguise as an agent among the peoples o f the lands being absorbed by his country. A n impressive six feet tall, broad chested and wiry, “ gypsy-eyed,” darkly handsome, he was fiercely imposing, his face scarred by a savage spear wound received in a battle with Som ali marauders. He spoke twentynine languages and many dialects and when necessary could pass as a n ative o f several Eastern lands— as an A fghan when he made his famous pilgrimage to M ecca, as a Gypsy laborer among the work gangs on the canals o f the Indus R iver, and as a nondescript peddler o f trinkets and as a dervish, a wandering holy man, when exploring the wilder parts o f Sind, Baluchistan, and the Punjab for his general. He was the first European to enter Harar, a sacred city in East A frica, though some thirty whites had earlier been driven o ff or killed. H e was also the first European to lead an expedition into Central A frica to search for the sources o f the N ile , a venture as daring and romantic then as going to outer space a century and a h alf later. Such exploits reflect only the “ surface” Burton and obscure the inner m an, a man o f extraordinary com plexity, sensitivity, and intelligence. A lthough he was one o f the best-known in­ dividuals o f his age and was especially popular with the public, there were times when he was almost an outcast among his own people. His opinions on various subjects— English “ misrule” o f the new colonies, the low quality and stodginess o f university education, the need for the sexual em ancipation o f the English w om an, the failure on the part o f G overnm ent to see that the conquered peoples o f the empire were perpetually on the edge o f revolt— were not likely to make him popular at home. N or did his condem nation o f infanticide and the slave trade endear him to O rientals and Africans. His scholarly interests often in­\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nfuriated the V ictorians, for he wrote openly about sexual matters they thought better left unm entioned— aphrodisiacs, circum ci­ sion, infibulation, eunuchism, and hom osexuality. He had some private opinions that angered his wife, Isabel, norm ally a tolerant person, for he passionately believed in polygamy as a means o f reinforcing fam ily stability, alleviating the household burdens on a single wife, and lessening the evils o f prostitution. In India, because o f his odd beliefs and strange practices, his fellow officers o f the army o f the Honourable East India Com pany called him the “ W hite N igger” and “ that D evil Burton.” (His own description o f him self was “ Am ateur Barbarian.” ) He learned early to keep certain opinions and interests to him self and became a master o f the S h i’a Muslim practice known as taqiya— dissimulation or concealm ent— in w hich one’s private religious beliefs are kept hidden. A n d he had his unpleasant side, unfortunately all too public— he could be harshly intolerant of other men and brutally sarcastic, reflecting to an extrem e the popular prejudices o f the age against blacks, Jew s, and Asians. Y et he understood the evil effects o f W esternization on native people and warned against its threat, and he had a great sympathy for the A rab race in general as well as for the desert peoples loosely called Bedawin. There was also a strong touch o f snobbery in his remarks about fellow Englishm en, when class consciousness was an open and cruel fact. Burton’s adult life was passed in a ceaseless quest for the kind o f secret knowledge he labeled broadly as “ G n o sis,” by w hich he hoped to uncover the very source of existence and the m eaning o f his role on earth. T h is search led him to investigate the Kabbalah, alchem y, Rom an Catholicism , a Hindu snake caste o f the most archaic type, and the erotic W ay called T antra, after w hich he looked into Sikhism and passed through several forms o f Islam before settling on Sufism, a mystical discipline that defies simple labels. He remained a more or less faithful practitioner o f Sufi teachings the rest o f his life, seeking the mystical heights\n\n4\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\ndenied all but the elect, what certain Muslims define as Insani K am il, the Perfect M an, who has attained the most profound spiritual goals. Burton erected such a formidable barrier around him self with taqiya that his religious interests have been virtually ignored. He passed several years among a S h i’a sect, the Isma’llls, a onceform idable messianic m ovem ent whose excesses in the past gave the world the term “ assassin.” But it was his more sensible lifelong com m itm ent to Sufism that deserves acknowledgm ent and study. Judging by the bibliographies o f scholarly works dealing with Islam, Burton was the first W esterner to write popularly but as an insider about Sufism, yet this com m itm ent remains a blank in biographies o f both this and the previous century. Islam dom ­ inated his writings in the last fifteen years o f his life, and he made several elegiac statements about what he called “ the Saving Faith” that cannot be ignored today. E ven then he found other esoteric interests to investigate: spiritualism , Theosophy, the doctrines o f Hermes Trismegistus, and extrasensory perception. (Burton was the first to use the term “ E S P .” ) Despite his private searches, however, he was often a scoffer and skeptic, particularly o f organized religion, and wres­ tled constantly with the problem o f “ G od and N o -G o d .” Beyond this, there were his investigations o f the mores and customs o f prim itive and semibarbarous peoples, who in some cases have already disappeared from the earth, and his vast com ­ prehension o f native life. He was a pioneer in ethnological studies and m ight be ranked with the great Am erican Lewis Henry M or­ gan (League o f the Iroquois, 1 8 5 1 ) , although Burton’s contribution to the science has only recently been recognized. Perhaps as im portant as any other preoccupation was his role in what was later called the “ G reat G a m e ,” a phrase Rudyard Kipling pop­ ularized in Kim. T h e G rea t G am e absorbed much o f England’s energies in the nineteenth century. T h e com petition between the European powers for control o f A sia and the Levant— the reasons were\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nprimarily econom ic— narrowed down to a struggle between Brit­ ain and Russia, mostly undercover, sometimes military, for the dom ination o f large areas o f the world east o f Suez. Burton’s role in his country’s colonial policies was important but ill defined. He never wrote openly about it but left clues scattered throughout his works— notably in his cryptic references to the use o f “ Secret Service funds” in the overthrow o f certain native princes and to the “ shady side” o f great military victories. Som e o f his exploits had major im plications at the time, such as his involvem ent in the 1 840s in a plot to overthrow the Shah o f Persia. A n d he was one o f the agents who helped put the Indian provinces o f Sind, Baluchistan, and the western Punjab firmly under British control. (They now form the modern state o f Pakistan.) U nder the pretense o f amateur archaeological in­ vestigation, he explored areas o f Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria that his governm ent considered worthy o f expropriation. There were other areas that, sometimes virtually alone, he scouted out for England and then suggested taking. In his somewhat acerbic entry under “ Burton” in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (eleventh edition, 1 9 1 1 ) , Stanley Lane-Poole, one o f Burton’s most en ­ ergetic “ unfriends,” tried to point out without actually revealing state secrets that Burton’s “ East A frican pioneering coincided with areas which have since become peculiarly interesting to the British Empire” and that his later explorations “ on the opposite side o f A frica, at Dahomey, Benin, and the G old Coast . . . have also entered among the imperial ‘questions’ o f the d ay.” In the East, religion and sex are not incompatible, as they have been so often in the W est. In his writings, Burton opened sexual vistas that Victorian England dared not enter. He was adamant that women enjoy sex as well as men, this at a time when V ictorian brides were told at marriage, “ Lie still and think o f the Em pire.” Burton translated a number o f books that today stand as classics in their field and helped bring about new atti­ tudes toward sex in the W estern world. His versions, given sub­\n\n6\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nstance by his own opinions and experience and heavily annotated, o f erotic works like the A nanga Ranga, the Kama Sutra (w hich he discovered), The Perfumed Garden, and even his Arabian Nights lead the reader to see that in Burton’s view sex, for wom en as well as m en, was not an uncomfortable duty for the propagation o f the race but a pleasure to be enjoyed with enthusiasm and vivacity. U nderlying Burton’s relentless physical and intellectual energy was an inner turmoil. He suffered frequently from severe bouts o f depression, and he was a drug addict. Cannabis and opium were his principal escapes, and he experim ented with rare nar­ cotics like khat, which is said to have a priapic effect. During his early middle age he became such an alcoholic that his career was threatened. He worked his way out o f his addictions and dependencies and was able to pass the last years o f his life free o f narcotics and alcohol, though by this time his health had deteriorated seriously. His interest in sex was at one point vir­ tually an uncontrollable obsession, yet when he married, he seems to have remained faithful to his wife. His marriage is another matter that has not been studied fully. A t a time in England when Rom an C atholics were considered second-class citizens, even though laws had been passed for their em ancipation, he married an English C ath olic, Isabel Arundell. T o his fam ily and his contemporaries, he might as well have married a wom an from tribal A frica. His marriage was thus the forcing o f barriers more formidable than the deserts and Bedawin nomads he encountered on the way to M ecca or the miasmic swamps he crossed in Central A frica. Victorian England was scathing about Lady Burton, and the prejudices that surrounded her then echo still in some o f today’s writings about her husband. But this marriage, seemingly so perilous to both Burtons, was happy and solid and needs to be considered afresh. Burton was a great raconteur but wrote very little about him self except in cryptic terms and in a curiously detached way— he was in actuality a very “ private” person— as if the very intense ad­\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nventures he had undergone were to remain in oral tradition and not to be written down for the public. Sadly, very few o f these stories were collected and put on paper by his friends. Isabel Burton remarked that she wished her husband had written a novel about his life, but he never did. “ First he thought that [it] would never suit Mrs Grundy [the m ythical censor o f British morals], and though he could retain a crowd o f friends around him till the small hours o f the morning, to listen to his delightful experiences, in print he could never be got to talk about himself. ” Despite this, Burton has been a popular biographical subject and also the basis for fictional characters. Rudyard Kipling used him at least twice, once as Strickland in the short story “ Miss Youghal’s Sais” and rather vaguely as C olon el C reighton, the mysterious unattached British agent in Kim; there are also shades o f Burton in the strange shopkeeper Lurgan. Kim is filled with anecdotes that sound as if Kipling had heard them directly from Burton or from Burton’s friends, and his description o f Strickland in the short story is Burton down to the last characteristic and is based on a portrait o f “ a young English officer” (as Burton often referred to him self) in Burton’s travel book Goa, and the Blue Mountains, from notes he had made in India in the 1840s.\n\nKipling’s description of Strickland is virtually Burton in his Indian days— “ a quiet, dark young fellow— spare, black-eyed— and when he was not thinking of something else, a very inter­ esting companion.” Strickland “ held the extraordinary theory” that an officer in India “should try to know as much about the natives as the natives themselves.” Following out his absurd theory he dabbled in unsavory places no respectable man would think of exploring— all among the native riff-raff. He educated himself in this peculiar way for seven years and people could not appreciate it. He was perpetually “going Fantee” among natives, which, of course, no man with any sense believes in. He was initiated into the Sat Bhai [the Seven Brothers, a Hindi and Tantric cult] at Allahabad, when he was on leave; he knew the Lizzard Song of the Sansis, and the HSlli-Hukh dance, which is a\n\n8\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nreligious can-can of a startling kind. When a man knows who dance the Hcilli-Hukh, and how, and when, and where, he knows some­ thing to be proud of. He has gone deeper than the skin. . . . He had helped once, at Jagadhri, at the Painting of the Death Bull which no Englishman must even look upon; had mastered the thieves’ patter of the chdngars, had taken a Eusufzai horse-thief alone near Attock; and had stood under the sounding board of a border mosque and conducted services in the manner of a Sunni Mollah. His crowning achievement was spending eleven days as a faquir or priest in the gardens of Baba Atal at Amritsar, and there picking up the threads of the great Nasiban Murder Case. . . . The Nasiban murder case did him no good departmentally; but after his first feeling of wrath, he returned to his outlandish custom of prying into native life. When a man once acquires a taste for this particular amusement, it abides with him all his days. It is the most fascinating thing in the world. . . . Where other men took ten days to the Hills, Strick­ land took leave for what he called shikar [the hunt], put on the disguise that appealed to him at the moment, stepped down into the brown crowd, and was swallowed up for a while. A n d in summary, “ N atives hated Strickland; but they were afraid o f him. He knew too m uch.”\n\n1 The Gypsy Child\n\nR\n\nichard Burton’s father, Joseph N etterville Burton, was a gentlem an in an age when being a gentleman was a proper calling. By rank he was a lieutenant colonel in the British army, with several years o f active service to his credit. Though English by ancestry, he was bom in Ireland, where his father, the R e v ­ erend Edward Burton, was rector o f the A n glican church at Tuam and a landholder. Th is led to R ichard’s often being called Irish, but in fact he lacked any traces o f Irish blood. Th e Reverend Burton married M aria Margaretta Cam pbell, who, if the romantic stories o f the family are true, was descended from an illegitim ate son o f the French Bourbon king Louis X IV , through his mistress, the beautiful Com tesse “ La Belle” Montmorency. T h e Burton family tree included a bishop and an admiral. For some years there was also a baronetcy, but the title fell into abeyance and could not be revived. Though the name Burton was common in England, it was also a Gypsy or Rom any name, and everyone agreed that Richard Burton had the general ap­\n\n9\n\nIO\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\npearance associated with Gypsies. His endless wanderings were taken by admirers, who would not have tolerated the presence o f a true G ypsy for a moment, as a sign o f his G ypsy blood. Joseph Burton’s m ilitary career was passed in relatively pleasant and uneventful surroundings. He entered the army as a teenager, w hen volunteers were called to fight N apoleon; those who brought w ith them a certain number o f men for the ranks received commissions. “ Thus my father found him self an officer at the age o f seventeen, when he ought to have been at school,” said Burton. T h e young officer was sent to Sicily, where from 1806 to 1 8 1 4 ; m uch against the wishes o f the local people, a British garrison kept a tottering Bourbon dynasty alive by subsidies and its own dom inating presence. In 1 8 1 4 the British moved on to the mainland, invading Leg­ horn w ith the aid o f Sicilian troops, and continued on to G enoa. H ere C o lo n el Burton was made town mayor. He entered w hole­ heartedly into the city’s social life. O ne o f the stars around whom the British officers gathered was the unfortunate Princess C a r­ oline, wife o f the Prince o f W ales, later George IV , infamously profligate and known as “ the most accomplished blackguard in Europe.” T h e marriage was not a happy one, and Caroline was sent to Italy, to become the star o f a group o f society people whose behavior was said to be “ scandalous.” Caroline herself was rumored to be adulterously involved with one Bartolomeo Bergami. In G en oa, as Burton wrote, “ her kindness to the officers greatly prepossessed them in her favo r.” W hen George succeeded to the throne in 18 20 , he gave orders that Caroline was not to be accepted as queen and initiated divorce proceedings against her in the House o f Lords, the charge being adultery. C olon el Burton was called as a witness against the queen, but he refused to testify. T h is act of gallantry was costly to Joseph Burton. He was rem oved from active service by the Prime M inister, the Duke o f W ellington, and placed on half pay. T h e C o lo n el’s refusal to com prom ise a wom an’s honor affected even his sons: Richard com plained later that he had to begin life as a lowly East India\n\nThe Gypsy Child\n\n11\n\nCom pany cadet, and his brother, Edward, could get a marching regiment only, while their cousins were taken into the more fashionable Guards and other crack corps o f the queen’s army. During the proceedings against Caroline, C olon el Burton had gone to Ireland to check on the family estates. He found them in a frightful condition. He called the tenants together and, after being duly blarneyed, as his son put it, told them that from then on the rents would have to be paid more regularly. T h e only regular result was that he was shot at frequently. W ith that, the C olon el decided to give up the game and let matters take their own course. But the C o lo n el’s return to England was not a total loss. He found a bride for himself. Her name was M artha Baker, and the rites were duly celebrated. “ A s handsome men generally d o ,” said Richard Burton o f his father’s marriage, “ he married a plain w om an,” and “ the children favoured, as the saying is, the m other.” It was not merely filial reticence, this modesty about his mother. Som eone else said she was “ accomplished but p lain .” A n oth er view was that she was “ a thin, delicate woman o f good fam ily.” W hatever the ancestry and looks o f M artha Baker, her family had money. She brought to her marriage a dowry o f £30 ,0 0 0 , an extrem ely large sum at the time, but her father had tied up the money so that it was paid out in installments. Th is proved to be a fortunate move, for the C olonel was a heavy but careless speculator in various risky ventures. Th e marriage produced a child within the expected time. T h e baby was christened Richard Francis Burton after M artha’s father and her husband’s brother. T h e date o f the child’s birth was M arch 19 , 1 8 2 1 — “ Feast o f St. Jo seph ,” noted Richard Burton later. T h e baby had red hair, blue eyes, and a fair com plexion, but as he grew older, these traces o f A nglo-Saxonism disappeared into the famous “ gypsy looks, gypsy eyes.” Life in England did not appeal to the C olon el after his troubles with the Irish tenants and reduction in pay. Since his wife had\n\n12\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\na regular income and there was not much to do except dabble in chem istry as a way o f passing the time, the C olon el, who was an asthm atic, decided to m ove abroad shortly after the birth o f his first child. T h e clear, dry air o f France was tremendously appealing. Packing up his household, C o lon el Burton moved w ith his w ife and baby to the Loire V alley and took an old chateau at Tours, where there was a small English colony and an English school. T h e city was picturesque and attractive, as Richard Bur­ ton recalled later, the clim ate healthy, the hunting good, the livin g cheap, and the local people, despite N apoleon’s loss at W aterloo, friendly. In Tours, Joseph Burton’s lungs improved rapidly. T w o more children were born to the Burtons, M aria Catherine Eliza in A ugust 18 2 3 and Edward Joseph N etterville in August 18 24 . For Edward’s birth the family returned to England, and both he and M aria were baptized at Elstree parish church. Life for the Burton children in France was at first all play and plenty o f childhood pleasures: apple puffs (“ adm irable,” recalled Burton) at Madame Fisterre’s pastry shop; grapes from the garden; in warm w eather, play with N o ah ’s ark animals under the box hedges; clim bing the tails o f horses, collecting snail shells and cowslips in the lanes, playing with three black pointer dogs, Ju n o , Jupiter, and Ponto. T h e children were left more or less to the servants while their parents enjoyed the society o f the English colony. There were no snobs then, Burton recalled in later years, but the Tours com m unity was intensely and patriotically English. Besides being strongly Protestant in a C ath olic country, the English were very nationalistic. “ A n y Englishman in those days who refused to fight a duel w ith a Frenchm an was ostracized,” said Burton. “ English girls who flirted with foreigners, were looked down upon by those English who have lived in black countries. W hite wom en who do these things lose their caste.” Education cam e haphazardly. C olon el Burton had but a smat­ tering o f this and that, and though he expected more for his\n\nThe Gypsy Child\n\n13\n\nchildren, learning was never so diligently pursued as parents in later generations would have demanded. However, little Richard was started on the fundamentals o f Latin at three. A t four he was given a G reek grammar. (He thought he was intended to be “ that wretched being, the infant phenom enon.” ) T h en the pleas­ ant years o f play ended abruptly. O ne morning the children saw their schoolbooks fastened with little straps. Richard and Edward were bundled into a carriage, and off they went to a school in town run by an expatriate Irishman named Clough. It seems to have been a very small school, with English and French boys at hacked, ink-spotted desks and a schoolmaster who was pleasant only when parents were on hand. O ne day Mr. Clough ran away because o f his debts, to be replaced by his sister, and this was all the formal schooling the Burton boys were to experience abroad. N ext came a tutor, Jo h n G ilchrist, who was adept at caning, to teach drawing, dancing, French, and music, all nec­ essary accomplishments for nineteenth-century English gentle­ men and women. But the favorite study for both boys was arms, almost from the time they could walk, when they were given popguns and spring pistols and tin and wooden swords. Richard early showed a streak o f violence. A t five he wanted to kill the porter for making fun o f his toy weapons. T h e C olon el hired various young men and women to keep discipline among his children, a thankless job. “ W e boys became perfect devilets, and practiced every kind o f trick despite the rattan. W e boys beat our bonnes, generally by running at their petticoats and upsetting them .” W hen one newly hired nursemaid took the young Burtons for a walk, they knocked her down and jumped on her with their tiny boots. There was an air o f violence everywhere. A t times, G ilchrist beat their hands with a ruler. Fighting among children was for­ bidden, but the English children and the French children, usually the sons o f peasants, fought constantly. T h e Burtons fought the French gutter boys with sticks and stones, fists and snowballs. “ Our father and mother had not much o f an idea o f managing\n\n14\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\ntheir ch ild ren ,” said Burton. Richard had a vile temper; he was rough in manner, and, said his niece Georgiana Stisted, “ mis­ chievous as a m onkey,” but, “ he adored his m other.” Despite his roughness, “ there was a gentle side to his nature. He loved pets o f all kinds and would try to rescue the maimed and the dyin g.” In short, wrote his niece, his relatives often thought him “ most troublesome and disagreeable” but “ one o f the most warm­ hearted boys that ever breathed.” G ilch rist was not without a streak o f sadism. One day he took his three young pupils to witness the guillotining o f a woman who had poisoned her children. He told the Burtons to cover their eyes when the blade fell. N aturally, no one did, and at first the image o f the severed head produced not nightmares but play guillotining. But nightmares there were to be. Burton was haunted by sev­ eral, w hich continued into adulthood. In Sind, in the wild coun­ try near the Beloch hills, he came across a spot haunted by a G ia n t Face, “ the remains o f some pagan magician whose head was spared whilst his form was consigned to the flames below ,” and this reminded him o f the persistent nightmares o f his child­ hood. Did you ever . . . when abandoned by your nurse to the horrors of a big black bedroom, see a grinning face advance towards you from the distant apex of a huge cone which lay before your closed eyes— advance gradually, but unavoidably, till in spite of your struggles, its monstrous features were so close to yours that you could feel them; then, almost suddenly, start back from you, flit away, diminish till nothing but the dark eyeballs remain in sight, and disappear presently to return with all its terrors? If you did, you may understand what I mean by calling this [the Giant Face] a strong superstition. A n d even later, when he was fifty-nine, in his elegy, The Kasidah, he spoke of the “ Black phantom o f our baby-fears.”\n\nThe Gypsy Child\n\n15\n\nA s a child, Burton prided him self on his stoicism. He could endure a toothache without com plaint, the problem being no­ ticed only by the swelling o f his face. He had ambiguous ideas about self-restraint. C ould he stare at sugar and cream and not eat them? How strong was his self-control? He would look at the food for minutes, asking himself, H ave I the courage not to touch them? He had, but with greed conquered, the experim ent was finished, and down went the objects o f the test. T h e young Burtons were liars, too, not ordinary run-of-themill liars trying to avoid unpleasant situations like beatings but liars for the sheer pleasure o f lying. “ Resolute and unblushing,” said Burton o f him self as a child liar. I used to ridicule the idea of my honour being in any way attached to telling the truth. I considered it an impertinence being questioned. I could never understand what moral turpitude there could be in a lie, unless it was told for fear of the consequence of telling the truth, or that one would attach blame to another person. That feeling continued for many a year, and at last, as very often happens, as soon as I realized that a lie was contemptible, it ran into the other extreme, a disagreeable habit of scrupulously telling the truth whether it was time or not. By the age o f nine Richard was virtually a hard-core delin­ quent. H aving filched his father’s gun, he used old monuments in the graveyard for targets and shot out stained-glass windows in the church. W ith others his age (“ all Anglo-French boys were remarkable young ruffians” ), he stole from shops and made ob­ scene remarks to the French girls. A t last, the C olon el reached the breaking point. Early in 18 30 he came to the conclusion that other English children in this foreign atmosphere had turned out badly, and with mounting evidence o f delinquencies staring at him, he feared for the future o f his own. M oreover, by 18 30 anti-British feeling was rampant. “ Things began to look b lack ,” said Burton. A n ti-English remarks\n\nl6\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nwere heard on the streets, and incidents took place. “ A French officer o f the line who . . . associated with English girls, was insulted and killed in a dastardly duel by a pastrycook.” It was tim e for the Burtons to return to England. T h e household was dissolved, and the family set o ff by coach to Dieppe to embark for “ the cold plunge into English life.”\n\n2 Dark and Sooty England, Sunny France\n\n“T anding in England was dolorous,” said Burton. T o the J u children, the air o f Brighton, full o f smoke and soot, was unfit for breathing. T h e cold gray skies made them shudder. “ In the town everything appeared so small, so prim, so mean, the little one-fam ilied houses contrasting in such a m elancholy way with the big buildings o f Tours and Paris.” T h e children revolted against the coarse and half-cooked food; accustomed to the wines o f France, they found port, sherry, and beer “ like strong medi­ c in e .” W orse was the bread, “ all crumb and no crust.” T h e milk seemed to be chalk and water. “ T h e large joints o f meat made us think o f Robinson Crusoe, and the vegetables cuite a I’eau, especially the potatoes, which never heard o f ‘maitre d ’hotel,’ suggested the roots o f prim itive m an.” N ow ten, Richard could see the crevices and cracks o f En­ glish life. Later, in his fragment o f autobiography, he con ­ demned\n\n17\n\nl8\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nthe whole lower class society which seemed to be governed by the fist. The national temper, fierce and surly, was a curious contrast to the light-hearted French. The little children punched one another’s heads on the sands, the boys punched one another’s heads in the streets, and in those days a stand-up fight between men was not uncommon. A n d the men beat their wives. C o lo n el Burton planned university educations for his sons. A lth ou gh Eton was the ideal preparation for O xford and C am ­ bridge, a friend Burton described as “ blundering” suggested in­ stead a school run by one Reverend Charles Detafosse. A heavyset, bluff man who took a prodigious amount o f snuff, Delafosse seemed like a character from a nineteenth-century n ovel— perhaps, Burton thought, from Dickens. “ He was no more fit to be a schoolmaster than the G rand C ham o f T artary.” Delafosse had some redeeming qualities: he spared the rod and at times returned from dining half-tipsy. T h e school was run in a tightfisted manner by the thin-lipped Mrs. Delafosse, who skimped on meals. Richard would sometimes scrape the butter from several slices o f bread until he had enough on one com er to make a decent mouthful. Lean and bruised from constant fighting— he found him self in daily battles— he went to bed hungry night after night. Fighting was inevitable. Richard had a short temper, he was sensitive and proud, and he received enough slights, he recalled later, that at one point he had thirty-two affairs o f honor to settle. T h e fights were held daily after classes among the hacked, scarred benches and ink-stained desks o f the schoolroom , with the older boys as referees. Edward, less inclined to take offense, had few er fights. A t Delafosse’s the Burtons’ principal acquisi­ tions were “ a certain facility o f using our fists, and a general developm ent o f ruffianism .” More than their bodies suffered at the school. Instead of learning anything, the brothers lost much o f w hat they already knew, especially French. Burton’s memory o f the period at the school was so painful\n\nDark and Sooty England, Sunny France\n\n19\n\nthat he could not recognize a school chum whom he met in India years later. In fact, the school and college years, which Burton believed most boys liked to recall with the greatest pleasure, were “ a nightmare to us.” Before the term was finished, measles broke out, several boys died, and the school was closed. Richard came down with the measles but recovered. T h e C o lon el could easily persuade him self that education in England was a failure. Besides, he longed for the shooting and boar hunting o f the French forests. It was time to return to the C ontin en t. A s was common among many wellto-do English families, the Burtons hired tutors, a Miss Ruxton, red-faced and stout, for M aria, and for the boys, a Mr. H. R. Du Pre, a clergym an’s son and an O xford graduate. Later, Burton had halfhearted regrets about this rejection o f his m other coun­ try, for he felt that families raised abroad lost all the friends who might be useful in the future. “ In consequence o f being brought up abroad, we never thoroughly understood English society, nor did society understand us.” T h e man brought up outside his country and especially outside his village and parish was “ a waif, a stray . . . a blaze o f light without a focus.” T h e question was where to live. C olon el Burton had been very happy at Tours but for reasons his son never revealed was reluctant to return. He now dragged his family in a wandering search for the perfect place to settle. T h ey passed through O r­ leans, but everything seemed to smell o f “ goose and gutter.” T h ey drifted to Blois, where there was a substantial British col­ ony. “ W hen one describes one colony, one describes them a ll,” said Burton, leaving the details blank. A t Blois, Miss R uxton, with no reluctance, resigned her post, leaving the burden o f teaching to Mr. Du Pre. He set up a small school with a staff to aid him — a professor o f Latin and G reek, a French master, a dancing master, and best o f all, a fencing master who had lost a thumb in the N apoleonic Wars. Fencing became the favorite subject o f both boys, and they used real, not wooden, foils and swords.\n\n20\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nA n d so life ambled along, filled with activity but with no m ajor demands, with no stresses, but becoming boring. M eanw hile, the parents were “ im perceptibly lapsing into the category o f professional in valids,” like people living a negative, neurotic existence w ho have no business in life “ except to be sick .” Restless and asthm atic, the C olon el yearned for Italy and its sun. “ Y ou ’ll kill your wife, sir,” said Grandm am m a Baker, who had com e to care for her daughter. She was sent home, and the Burtons packed and left to wander through Provence. Years later, Burton could still remember the impression the landscape made on him . Everything “ seemed to fall into a picture . . . like a sun that burst upon the rocks. . . . It was quite a sensation.” From M arseilles they sailed to Leghorn, a city swarming with bandits and verm in— even the washerwoman’s head appeared to be w alking o ff her shoulders with lice— and “ utterly unfit to in h ab it.” T h e C olonel moved the family to Pisa, where he found lodgings on the shady— wrong— side o f the A m o . “ T h e dullness o f the place was something preternatural,” and the climate was “ detestable.” T h e discomforts were considerable. In the chill (“ Icelan dic” ) the only heat came from a brazier in the center of the room. “ T h e servants were perfect savages.” T h e job o f education continued, with an Italian teacher added to the staff, and to teach a hated instrument, a violin master, w ho pushed his oldest pupil too far by saying that the other children were beasts but Richard was an archbeast. “ In a fury o f rage I broke the violin upon my master’s head.” T h e wandering never stopped. C olon el Burton, in a frantic search for some kind o f peace, was now m oving without reason, hoping that over the horizon there might be a city more hospitable, w ith a better clim ate, a more congenial English colony. A t S ien a, “ almost all the English . . . were fugitives from justice, social or crim in al.” T h e family passed through Perugia, then on to Florence, where Burton had his now fam iliar mixed recollec­ tion o f the city: “ Colonies go on as they began, and the Anglo-\n\nDark and Sooty England, Sunny France\n\n21\n\nFlorentine flock certainly contained, contains, and ever will con ­ tain some very black sheep. ” However, old C olon el de Courcey had “ some charm ing daughters.” In Rom e for the Holy W eek, the C olon el took apartments in the Piazza di Spagna, where the English colony was centered. T h e children ran wild in the ancient city, then still an unex­ cavated, unrestored ruin. Th ey found unexpected treasures, going from V atican to C apitol, from church to palazzo, from ruin to ruin. T h ey haunted the coin and curio shops, saw the old Forum and the ruined Colosseum , all unrestored and unretouched, and took excursions into the countryside. T h en came two weeks at Naples. A t Sorrento the boys prac­ ticed pistol shooting and delighted in cockfighting with unarmed birds. T h ey drank furtively, then openly. “ W e were getting too old to be manageable, and Mr. Du Pre, taking high grounds on one occasion, very nearly received a good thrashing.” T h e C o lo ­ nel returned to his chem ical experiments, filling the house with “ abom inations o f all kinds.” A u n t G . arrived with a friend, Miss M organ, who was “ the only one who ever spoke to us children as if we were reasonable beings, instead o f scolding and threat­ en in g.” T h e kindly “ Miss M organ could do with the juniors what all the rest o f the house com pletely failed in doin g.” T h ey left Sorrento and settled in N aples (“ perhaps the most dissolute city on the continent” ). O f the English visitors, Burton recalled: “ T h eir morals were unspeakable,” but “ the girls were beautiful.” T h en cholera broke out. T h e Burtons had seen it before, in France and at Siena and Rom e. “ A t N aples it only excited our curiosity.” W ith the help o f the fam ily’s Italian m anservant, Richard and Edward got the necessary clothing, “ and when the dead-carts passed round in the dead o f night, we went the rounds with them as some o f the croquem orts,” helping rem ove the bodies from the pauper houses and taking them to the pits outside the city. “ Into these flesh-pots were thrown the unfortunate bodies o f the poor, after being stripped o f the rags\n\n22\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nw hich acted as their w inding sheets. Black and rigid, they were thrown down apertures like so much rubbish, into the festering heap b elow .” A n d then there were the prostitutes in a house on the next street. R ichard and Edward signaled to one o f the girls from their balcony, and a party was planned. “ Being abundant in pocket m oney . . . the orgie was tremendous, and we were only too lucky to get home unhurt, before morning, when the Italian servant let us in. ” But Mrs. Burton discovered letters “ o f extrem e debauchery” from the girls. “ A tremendous com m otion was the result.” T h e C olon el and Du Pre tried to horsewhip the boys, who took to the roof until they were pardoned. Because his army service had interrupted his own education, C o lo n el Burton was determined that neither son would enter the m ilitary. “ Som e evil spirit, probably Mr Du P re,” suggested that the boys be sent to O xford, an idea both detested. However, in order to crush their pride, they were told that they would enter O xford as “ sizars, poor gentlem en who are supported by the alms o f others. O ur feelings may be im agined.” But the C olon el was determ ined that his fencing, shooting, whoring, delinquent sons would becom e clergymen and carry on the fam ily tradition that only he had broken. V isions o f his sons enjoying a luxurious life in fat country parishes filled his head. Both boys protested. Each had repeatedly expressed a desire to enter the m ilitary. But the C o lo n el was adamant. There were also practical reasons: It cost money to buy a commission, and the pay was not good; army men were not noted for their brains, and the Burton boys clearly had outstanding talents. W ith his mind made up, the C olon el told his sons that they were to attend those two ancient centers o f religious learning, Richard at O xford and Edward at C am ­ bridge. It was time to move again. C olon el Burton decided to return to France. T h e usual mountain o f baggage was packed in the enormous boxes o f the period, and the family boarded one o f the English coastal steamers that, as Burton said in a disparaging\n\nDark and Sooty England, Sunny France\n\n23\n\ntone, “ infested the M editerranean” and in due time reached M arseilles. T h ey wandered through Provence, where antiEnglish feelings were rife, to the Pyrenees and took up an ex ­ tended residence in Pau. Here the boys were tempted to join a party o f smugglers, but now Burton’s mind was centered more on women than on high adventure, remembering the L ’Estranges (“ one o f the daughters was a very handsome wom an” ) and old C aptain Sheridan, with “ two good-looking daughters.” H owever, the children’s studies were kept at with unremitting attention. A n emphasis was placed not only on the classics but on drawing and painting. “ It was lucky for me that I did. I have been able to make my own drawings, and to illustrate my own books,” Burton recalled. He added a thought that, fulfilled, would have been o f benefit to the world: “ A n d I never ceased to regret that I had not practiced sufficiently to be able to write down music at hearing. Had I been able to do so, I might have collected some two thousand m otives from Europe, A sia, A frica and A m er­ ica, and have produced a musical note-book which would have been useful to a Bellini, or Donizetti, or a B o ito .” T h e brothers were now young men, and tensions mounted in the home. T h e C olon el moved the family, both sons unruly, to the Baths o f Lucca, where the inevitable breakup o f the family began. T h e boys were impossible to manage. “ I do th in k,” said Burton, “ that we were not pleasant inmates o f a household.” T h e C o lo n el’s temper had permanently soured. He could no longer beat his sons, but he could make him self very unpleasant with his tongue. Du Pre was thoroughly cowed. T h e boys threw their books out the window if he attempted lessons in G reek or Latin and went off to the countryside to shoot pistols and fence. “ W e made experiments o f everything imaginable, including swal­ lowing and smoking opium .” In the middle o f the summer o f 1840 the final breakup came. “ It was com paratively tam e,” said Burton. Instead o f the w on­ derfully em otional partings o f Italian families, which he seemed to admire, “ the British m other,” after the habits o f fifteen years,\n\n24\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\ncan “ easily part with her children at the cost o f a lachrymose last em brace.” Mrs. Burton and M aria were left at Lucca, while the C olon el and his sons made their way to England. “ W e lads cast longing eyes at the charm ing country w hich we were not destined to see for another ten years. . . . How m elancholy we felt when on our way to the chill and dolorous N o rth !”\n\n3 Among\n\ntheGrocers\n\nC\n\nolonel Burton and his sons arrived in England during O xford’s long vacation. Edward was placed in the care o f a country parson, a Dr. Havergal, for a year o f tutoring before going on to Cam bridge. Havergal wrote to the C o lon el that “ Richard must not correspond with his brother.” Richard was sent to one Dr. Sholefield, a professor o f classics, and put through his paces. He was “ lamentably deficient” in V irgil and Homer. W orse still it was found that I, who spoke French and Italian and their dialects like a native, who had a considerable smattering of Beamais, Spanish and Provengale, barely knew the Lord’s Prayer, broke down on the Apostle’s Creed, and had never heard of the Thirty-Nine Articles — a terrible revelation! T h e man who was to tutor him to repair his deficiencies was Dr. W illiam A lexan d er G reenhill, who had just married Laura W ard, a member o f a prominent intellectual family. “ M r Du Pre\n\n25\n\n26\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nvanished and was never seen again ,” said Burton with relief. G reen h ill was one o f h alf a dozen men who were to have a profound influence on Burton’s life and help steer him , then unknowingly, into his interest in the O rient. G reenh ill was not only proficient in Latin and G reek but knew A rabic as well. He was then involved in a study o f A rabic and G reek medical works and a few years later published an English translation o f an A rabic work on sm allpox; he was also a specialist on Sir Thom as Browne; his edition o f Religio Medici was for decades the standard version. H e wrote biographies o f several individuals long forgotten, trans­ lated various spiritual works, was a member o f the O xford M ove­ m ent, in w hich issues that had long ago lost the attention o f the A n g lican church were being reexam ined, and was a close friend o f Dr. Jo h n Henry N ew m an’s, to whom he introduced Burton. Though only seven years older than Burton, G reenh ill was the first genuine scholar he had ever met. G reenh ill not only got his unpromising student tutored in Latin and G reek but filled out the gap in his religious background and introduced him to a noted A rabist, Don Pascual de Gayangos, a Spaniard. But aside from meeting G reenh ill and his circle, Burton’s in­ troduction to O xford was not happy. ‘‘T h e first sight o f Oxford struck me with a sense o f appal. ” A s he passed through the portals o f the university a couple o f collegians laughed in his face for his foreign appearance. H aving been insulted, and accustomed to C o n tin en tal decorum, Burton handed the taller boy his card, expecting a duel. Instead, nervous explanations were given, “ and I w ent my way sadly, and felt that I had fallen among epiciers,” said Burton, using the French term for grocers. O xford would get no better. His college porter warned him o f practical jokes played by upperclassmen and told him to keep his door locked. Burton left the door open but kept a red-hot poker in the fireplace. “ Th is was part and parcel o f that unhappy education abroad.” Expecting serious studies, he was confronted w ith practical jokes, drunkards and gamblers, hazing by his elders, and w ithdrawn, nervous dons.\n\nAmong the Grocers\n\n27\n\nA lo n e for the first time in his life since his short year at Delafosse’s school (and then Edward was with him ), Burton felt pangs o f abandonment. He missed even his father, stem though the C o lon el had been about his son’s educational lapses. He was, he confessed later, too lonely and miserable to get into trouble. H e quickly made up his deficiencies with G reen h ill’s help, and thanks to his inquiring mind, excellent memory, and uncanny ability to learn, he was soon on a level with the majority o f the other students. But he had no enthusiasm for college life. In contrast to the riches o f his boyhood and youth on the C ontin en t, O xford offered little to attract him. He described even his rooms as a “ couple o f dog holes.” C hapel, which was compulsory, was a bore, and the lectures that formed the core o f his education were either incomprehensible or useless. O xford in the 1840s, Burton believed, was undergoing great changes. It had once been a Benedictine monastery, and the older fellows retained a kind o f monklike innocence. T h eir scholarship was o f the most prim itive sort. O ne remark, which must have annoyed Burton, for he referred to it several times (notably in Vikram and the Vampire), was that o f the university fellows, who, seriously, as a matter o f philosophical inquiry, “ were capable o f asking you if ‘cats let loose in the woods would turn into tigers.’ ” A m ong a student body o f mediocrities, Burton’s special talents had no challenges. T h e university was, with a few exceptions, “ a hotbed o f toadyism and flunkeyism .” There was more than the sons o f grocers, dull gray walls, boring hours in chapel, and unedifying lectures to annoy him. T h e first day at T rin ity brought him face-to-face with another o f his favorite abominations, bad food. His “ foreign stom ach” began to revolt. He com plained o f stodgy puddings, malt liquor in place o f wine, heavy beers and ales, and the endless drinking at table after meals. A side from his own varied intellectual pursuits, Burton found that he was leading “ a dull and monotonous life.” He had a few classes in the morning; then his day was free. He could not afford\n\n28\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nto keep horses, so his amusements were “ walking, rowing and the school-at-arms. ” His walks had a purpose. There was an encam pm ent o f Gypsies in the dense forests o f nearby Bagley W ood, where they found a sanctuary from the general prejudices against them. Here Burton met an attractive G ypsy girl named S elin a, who, “ dressed in silks and satins, sat in state to receive the shillings and the hom age o f the undergraduates.” From this time on Burton had an intense attraction to Gypsies. O ne can surmise that these encounters with Selin a have sexual conno­ tations, but Burton in later years spoke several times o f “ the rigid chastity o f the Gypsy girls in England and Spain. Indeed in Europe generally, where a lapse would lead to certain d eath .” From the Indus to G ibraltar corporal chastity “ has ever been a distinctive characteristic.” W hatever the relationship with S e ­ lina, Burton picked up some o f the type o f Rom any spoken among the Bagley W ood G ypsies, for when he was stationed in India, he was able to connect it with various tongues common in Sind and the Punjab. O ne o f the few fortuitous experiences o f the year for Burton cam e when Dr. G reenh ill introduced him to Don Pascual de G ayangos, the Spanish Arabist. W eary o f a concentrated study o f Latin and G reek, Burton had “ attacked A rab ic” and tried to teach him self the alphabet, using the famous A rabic grammar o f Thom as Erpenius, a sixteenth-century Dutch O rientalist. But Burton had failed to pick up one o f the most basic points o f A rabic: in his ignorance he wrote the characters o f the alphabet from left to right, though the words were read from right to left. “ G ayangos, when witnessing this proceeding, burst out laughing, and showed me how to copy the alphabet.” Burton hoped to be able to attend regular classes in A rabic, but “ in those days learn­ ing A ra b ic at O xford was not easy.” T h e one professor who might have taught Burton would not work with a single student, so Burton was forced to continue his struggle alone. His frustrations with O xford were echoed in later years when he com plained that the richest university in the world was too poor to afford the\n\nAmong the Grocers\n\n29\n\nhost o f professors needed for proper instruction: moreover, O x ­ ford could not even teach Cornish, G aelic, W elsh, and Irish, the original languages o f the islands. A fter the fall term ended (“ and very long it seemed” ), he went down to London to stay with Grandm am m a Baker and his aunts. T h e household was not lively— “ a household full o f women only, rarely is” — so he and Edward took other lodgings and passed the winter vacation enjoying themselves. Th en it came time to return to the university. Burton was decidedly unhappy at T rin ­ ity. He felt the general run o f collegians “ highly disapproved o f my foreign ways, and my expressed dislike to school and college, over which I ought to w ax sentim ental, tender and aesthetic; it appeared little short o f blasphem y.” But this seems to have been an extrem e opinion from later life, contradicted by his closest friend at O xford, A lfred Bate Richards, who wrote long afterward that he thought Burton was “ brilliant, rather wild, and very popular,” but “ none o f us foresaw his future greatness.” However, he wanted to be educated according to his own standards. He stirred the bile o f the dons by speaking real— that is, Rom an— Latin instead o f the artificial type peculiar to E n ­ gland, and he spoke G reek Rom aically, with the accent o f A t h ­ ens, as he had learned it from a G reek merchant at Marseilles, as well as the classical forms. Such a linguistic feat was a tribute to Burton’s remarkable ear and memory, for he was only a teen­ ager when he was in Italy and southern France. N ot only languages but philosophy and mysticism attracted him in the turmoil o f this year at Oxford. He began to investigate what he called “ odd by-ways o f learning,” seeking out some kind o f arcane knowledge, what he was to call “ G n o sis,” w hich he was to search for passionately in India and the M iddle East in later years. In London during his winter vacation he had met a man named Jo h n V arley, a practitioner of occult sciences. V arley was an artist by profession but, “ miserably poor,” had taken up “ practical astrology” and made it a second profession. W hen Burton met him, he had just published a curious work called\n\n30\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nZodiacal Physiognomy, w hich stated that after a fashion every man resembled the astrological sign under w hich he had been bom . V arley cast Burton’s horoscope and “ prognosticated that I was to be a great astrologer.” T h is set Burton o ff on a study o f occult works, and he retained a lifelong interest in astrology and related subjects. A n oth er occult interest as Burton defined it was “ Falconry” — the falcon was a symbol in Muslim mysticism o f the “ soul exiled among ravens,” as Burton thought he was among the epiciers o f Oxford. V arley seems to have been the instigator o f Burton’s in volve­ m ent in the Kabbalah, a m edieval Jew ish esoteric discipline. Proper study o f the Kabbalah requires a teacher, or “ guru,” and V arley may have played that role for Burton. O ne o f the key figures in Burton’s readings o f Kabbalistic texts was the famous C h ristian Kabbalist H einrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim , a sixteenth-century Germ anic counterpart o f the Portu­ guese soldier-poet Cam oes, who later became a literary preoccupation o f Burton’s. Cornelius Agrippa was not only a Kabbalist but by repute a m agician, a man o f “ wonderful and varied genius” — a wanderer and ex-m ercenary who never lacked for em ploym ent in the best courts o f Europe. A lth ou gh he was a firm, lifelong C ath olic, his outspoken views earned him the enm ity o f the Inquisition; at Metz he defied the C h u rch by defending a woman accused o f witchcraft; at Pavia he taught the doctrines o f Hermes Trismegistus (“ the ThriceBlessed Herm es” ), a legendary Egyptian sage whose disciples, the Herm etists o f the first three Christian centuries, followed his teachings in a secret quest for mystical experience. Years later, in one o f those spasmodic inquiries that he hoped would bring him to the mysterious “ G nosis” he sought, Burton turned briefly to Herm etism . Burton apparently also read Cornelius A grippa’s most famous and controversial work, De occulta phibsophia, kept from publication for twenty-one years by the Inquisition, a de­ fense o f magic “ by means o f which man may come to the knowl­ edge o f nature and o f G o d .”\n\nAmong the Grocers 31 T h e Kabbalah probed hidden and obscure meanings in the sacred Hebrew writings, exploring layer upon layer o f text for em anations o f the H oly Presence through the mystical interpre­ tations o f words, letters, numerals, and sounds. But more than Hebrew texts was drawn upon. A pivotal figure in the study o f mystical works was the early-thirteenth-century Provencal scholar Isaac the Blind, who studied not only Jew ish but early G reek and Christian G nostic writings and certain works by a mysterious Sufi brotherhood at Basra, the Brethren o f Sincerity, whose “ Epistles” were also indirectly to influence Burton shortly in India. O ne o f the most articulate exponents o f Kabbalistic doctrines whose works were in manuscript form at O xford was the four­ teenth-century Spanish scholar Abraham Abulafia o f Saragossa, a mystic o f messianic pretensions, who had traveled to the M iddle East and N orth A frica and had returned with certain Hindu yogic techniques o f sitting, breathing, and rhythm ic prayer that he and his disciples introduced into Kabbalistic ritual. Although Burton probably could not read Hebrew at the time, the O xford library had at least one o f A bulafia’s works in m an­ uscript. Th is was the She’eloth hd'Zaken (“ Questions o f the Old M an ” ), in which detailed instructions were given for the creation o f a golem, an artificial clay creature that, although it could not speak, served as a kind o f house servant and helpmate until it grew so large that it had to be destroyed, lest it overwhelm its creator. More than Hinduism influenced Kabbalistic ritual, and thus subtly Burton. There were themes o f the secret meanings o f words, names, and letters derived from the Sufis, the undefined mystics o f Islam, and even more complicated numerologies, for­ mulas, and incantations that supposedly, for the initiates, re­ moved the veils that shielded the “ G reat F ace,” the image o f G od denied all but the elect. O ne o f the important influences on Kabbalistic numerology was the strange Islamic sect the Isma’llls, who were known as “ Seveners” because they not only followed a line o f seven sacred imams, or leaders, but made the\n\n32\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nnumber seven the key to their ritual and beliefs. T w o years later, in western India, Burton was to come across the long-obscure Ism a’lll imam and be drawn into the sect. T h e Kabbalah was perhaps the most important intellectual influence in Burton’s early life and was his introduction to works that m ight lead him to a secret knowledge. A t this point he was m erely a dilettante, a curiosity seeker, but the little he learned served to prepare him for deeper, more com plex forms o f esoteric inquiry in India and the M iddle East. Spring term passed without notable events but for Burton’s realization that he had no interest at all in continuing at Oxford: “ T h e fellows at Trin ity were nice gentlem anly men, but I had by no means wished to become one o f their num bers.” Burton’s parents and sister were now in Germ any, his mother ill with a heart com plaint, his father wheezing and puffing as usual. T h e summer holidays commenced, Richard and Edward went to join them , and the inevitable wandering began, from one pleasant little town to another. “ Bonn, somehow or other always managed to show at least one very pretty girl, with blue porcelain eyes and ginger coloured hair. ” T h e young Burtons danced endlessly, and R ichard and Edward tried but failed to enlist in one o f the student fencing brigades at Heidelberg. But there was more press­ ing business at hand, a traditional encounter between genera­ tions. Both boys approached the C olon el on the matter o f their future. T h ey were not quite suited for the C hurch, each could argue, and all their current interests pointed to careers in the army. R ichard pleaded for permission to enter the m ilitary— “ the A ustrian service, the Swiss Guards at Naples, even the Legion 6trangere.” Or he could emigrate to C anada or Australia. Edward, too, having finished his tutoring under Dr. Havergal, said he would prefer the lowest rank in the army to entering Cam bridge. But the C olon el stood firm, visualizing luxuriant livings as clergymen for his sons rather than his own ragged m ilitary career on half pay. Defeated by his father’s inability to\n\nAmong the Grocers\n\n33\n\nunderstand, Richard returned to England “ determined to leave O xford, coute que coute. ” “ O f course my action was one o f boyish thoughtlessness.” He got drunk, wrote parodies o f sacred subjects, did caricatures o f the heads o f houses, improvised obscene rhymes, and made up epigrams and epitaphs at wine and supper parties. His object was to be “ rusticated,” not expelled, to be sent down temporarily from the university as a punishment. For the present the au­ thorities ignored him. In London, over the winter holidays, Richard and Edward had what proved to be a memorable encounter. T h ey met the three sons o f a C olon el W hite o f the Third Dragoons. T h e W hites were preparing for service in India, and they stirred the Burtons’ interest in that country and the East. England had just experi­ enced a massive defeat in A fghanistan at the hands o f native forces— some sixteen thousand troops had been lost. Sin ce so many officers had perished in the unhappy war with the Afghans, it was, the young men agreed, a propitious time to gain rapid advancem ent in the Indian armies. However, C olon el Burton would hear nothing o f his sons’ latest wishes. He was still de­ termined to turn them into clergymen. T h e crisis came in the spring when a celebrated steeplechaser named O liver appeared at the local races at Oxford. Unwisely, the university authorities forbade the students to attend. Burton defied the ban and went to the races. T h e next day, he was called up before the college authorities. His companions were humble, but Burton argued that there was no moral turpitude in going to a race, that college men should not be treated as ch il­ dren, and that “ trust begets trust.” T h e other students were temporarily suspended, but Burton was expelled. W ith another rusticated student, he rode off atop a coach, blowing a yardlong trumpet, driving over flower beds, and kissing his hand to the pretty shop girls while the lines o f a poem ran through his head.\n\n34\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\n“ I leave thee, Oxford, and I loathe thee well, Thy saint, thy sinner, scholar, prig and swell.”\n\nIn London, Burton was received by Grandm am m a Baker and his wom en relatives, somewhat astonished by his sudden appearance, for they knew that the term was not finished. In order to have some peace before the inevitable reckoning with the family, Burton told his aunts that he had been given an extra vacation “ as a reward for w inning a double first.” A clergyman dropping by for dinner nailed down Burton’s evasions by saying, “ Rusti­ cated, eh?” Rusticated he was. A horrendous scene followed w hen the C olon el learned the truth. O n e gone, it seemed wise to give the other formal approval to go also. T h e C olon el wrote to Edward that he need not continue w ith an ecclesiastical career; not that his second son was dutifully plodding his way into the ministry. A sked what he now intended to do, Richard answered that he preferred to enter the army, but he favored the Indian service, as it would show him more o f the world and would give him a better chance of active duty. There were two choices in the military in India, one w ith the regular armed forces o f the English governm ent— the Q ueen’s service— the other with the armies o f the H onour­ able East India Com pany, the m ercantile venture that had ex­ clusive rights to trade in India and elsewhere in the Orient. It was not difficult for Burton’s family to arrange for the pur­ chase o f a commission in the C om pany’s army. “ M y co n victio n ,” said Burton, “ is that the commission cost £ 5 0 0 .” It seemed like a foolhardy and dangerous choice, to join the ranks o f this vast, octopuslike com m ercial organization, but C o lo n el Burton’s gallant refusal twenty-two years earlier to testify against Princess C aroline still cast a shadow on the possibility o f regular m ilitary careers for his sons. Edward, however, was more fortunate than his brother, receiving as a gift a commission in\n\nAmong the Grocers 35 the 37th Regim ent from Lord Fitzroy Somerset, afterward Lord Raglan o f Crim ea fame. It was arranged that Richard would sail in the late spring o f 18 4 2 . He had an opportunity to learn an Indian language from a “ dirty, smoky” Scotch linguist named Duncan Forbes. H in ­ dustani became so important to Burton that he gave up boxing and fencing for the while. He could not have found a better teacher to introduce him to both Hindustani and the cultural riches o f India. A s a young man, Forbes, who grew up speaking G aelic and was educated at Perse Academ y, had got a post in the newly founded C alcutta Academ y. Here he was introduced to the O riental language stud­ ies that the English were developing for the benefit o f their soldiers and clerks. T h e Eastern classics the English were trans­ lating from various native tongues were not pedantic dry-as-dust debris from the literary morgues o f India. T h e English were mostly young men with a keen eye and ear for the bawdy, the erotic, the picturesque, and the novel. Am ong the works they discovered were those known as “ Parrot Books,” an Indian forerunner o f the Arabian Nights (which are in part derived from Indian sources) and distantly similar to A eso p ’s Fables and other such apologues. T h ey also had come across some o f the openly erotic works o f the type that Burton was to translate later, such as the Ananga Ranga, a popular marriage manual. Ill health forced Forbes to return home after three years in C alcutta. He joined the faculty o f K ing’s College, London, and advanced rapidly in A rabic, Persian, and Bengali as well as H in ­ dustani. Forbes gave Burton long hours in the latter tongue, and soon it was time for formal acceptance in the army o f the East India Com pany. Burton was sworn in at the Com pany’s offices, “ a wonderful dull and smoky old p lace.” So great was the need for soldiers and officers after the A fghan disaster that the Com pany was willing to take almost anyone.\n\n36\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nThe excess of demand explained the curious appearance of the embryo cadets when they met to be sworn in at India House. They looked like raw country lads, mostly dressed in homemade clothes. . . . Colonel White’s son, who was entering the service the same day, and I looked at one another in blank dismay. We had fallen amongst young Yahoos. . . . T h en he got his outfit, com plaining that the cadets— or their parents— were always victimized by the outfitters in England who loaded them down with unnecessary uniforms, guns, pistols, swords, and saddles o f the most useless type, plus boots o f no value, dictionaries and grammars o f Hindustani, W ellington’s dispatches, army regulations, M ill’s ponderous History of India, and w hatever else the unwary could be sold. Burton also bought one item ignored by the others. Early in life, presumably during the hot days in Italy, he had learned the advantages o f shaving his head in order to keep cool. So he got a wig for times when a head o f hair was required. A n d he bought an O xford bull terrier bitch, a veteran o f many dog fights and tussles w ith rats. T h e animal was old when Burton got her, and why he did not select a younger dog he did not explain. A t last he was ready to set off for India, for a land he knew only by hearsay, rumor, and myth. He had no idea where he was to serve or w hat he was to do. H e expected to fight Afghans, but otherwise his future was a blank. W hen he sailed, he did not have a definite assignm ent, but while he was aboard ship, the commander in c h ie f’s office in Bombay assigned him to the 18 th Regim ent, Bom bay N ative Infantry. W hat he was to make o f his life during the com ing years would be in part dictated by military necessity and the vagaries o f history, but mostly determined by his very strong w ill and unlimited curiosity.\n\n4 The Great Game\n\nW\n\nhat Burton was heading for— unaware and naively— was a role in what came to be called “ the G reat G a m e ,” a game o f secret intelligence that was as deadly as it was sporting and was one phase o f the shadowy war between England and Russia over native territories in Central and W est A sia. By Bur­ ton’s time the Portuguese had long ago faded away as active competitors in the East, the Dutch had retreated to Indonesia, and the French, having lost the N apoleonic W ars, had also failed in India, though they held on to some very small, isolated ter­ ritories on the southern coasts. In British eyes the subcontinent was very well divided and ruled, but to the west lay great prizes o f inestimable worth. Although the English Parliament had said in its regulating act o f 178 4, “ T o pursue schemes o f conquest and extension o f dom inion in India are measures repugnant to the wish, honour and policy o f this n ation ,” half a century later the Court o f Directors o f the East India Com pany, forgetting previous hypocrisies, stated that its representatives in India\n\n37\n\n38\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nshould overlook “ no just and honourable accession o f territory.” T h e early nineteenth century revealed three great areas that dem anded immediate and concentrated attention: Sind, the Pun­ jab, and Afghanistan. Farther west was the very rich, war-loving land o f Persia, whose shahs had invaded and sacked India w ith ease in the past and w hich was a peripheral prize not to be ignored. In fact, at that very moment the British were financing and secretly aiding uprisings against the rule o f the Q ajar Shah. Beyond these lands lay the mountainous Him alayan states, the northwest frontier, and beyond all, the vast steppes o f Central A sia, still not under Russian dom ination but ruled by various princes o f unparalleled and legendary cruelty. For the moment a general unease pitted Sikhs, Sindhis, Baluchis, Afghans, Per­ sians, and a dozen other tribes, subtribes, and princely states against each other, a situation that the British sought to profit by* T h e Honourable East India Com pany— popularly known as Jo h n C om p any— was still at the height o f its powers when Burton was accepted into its armies, but decay was already rampant. T h e governm ent, alarmed at the excesses o f the Com pany and its m erchant employees (“ gentlem en” were specifically excluded as members), had for over h alf a century been forcing restraints upon it. In 1 8 1 3 the C om pany’s trading monopoly in India was abolished, though it would remain the “ ruler” o f India, working as the private agent o f the Crow n in both m ercantile and ad­ m inistrative fields, and it was allowed to retain the very profitable trading m onopoly with C h in a, the ch ief item o f w hich was opium , and the second, cotton. However, almost two and a half centuries o f exploitation o f the Indians, o f misrule and greed, corruption and chicanery, had so undermined the Com pany’s effectiveness that it had only fifteen years left when Burton signed on. T h e heart o f the Com pany’s success was opium, which was so im portant to its balance sheet that the directors were w illing to go to war to m aintain their markets, waging the so-called Opium\n\nThe Great Gam e\n\n39\n\nW ar with C h in a in 18 3 9 - 4 2 to force an open market despite the wishes o f the C hinese, with the result that “ at no period o f the history o f this article has the trade in it to C h in a been carried on so successfully and so extensively. . . . ” T h e port o f Bombay alone, in 18 44 , exported £ 1,8 0 0 ,0 0 0 o f M alwa opium, a leading variety, to C h in a and £50 0 ,0 0 0 o f Indian cotton— C h in a, after severe famines, had turned its cotton lands to food crops. In the same year the com bined total o f legal exports to and from England was only £2,0 0 0 ,0 0 0 . But more than com m ercial traffic concerned the Com pany. Russia was an unseen— and occasionally visible— enemy. By 18 3 2 the English were fully convinced, to the point o f para­ noia, that the major threat to W est A sia and their hold on India was no longer the faraway French or the native princes o f the Punjab and the surrounding territories— Sind and Persia in particular— but Russia alone. T h e wily hand o f the czar was seen behind every minor uprising, behind every rumor out o f a bazaar. T h e Russian thirst for India was sensed in C alcutta by the servants o f Jo h n Com pany and in London by the Crow n. Strange and irresponsible figures added to the specter. David Urquhart, who has been called a “ sort o f M essiah type” and who had made a career out o f promoting Turkish interests over Russia and served in both open and secret missions to the sultan, warned day in and day out o f the Russian threat and kept the people at home alert to the danger. Urquhart had a special credibility— was he not the man who introduced the hot-air Turkish bath to London and also kept a harem, Turkish style, o f women from various parts o f the sultan’s empire? In Persia the ch ief o f the English mission, Dr. Jo h n M ’N eill, thought it was in that country that “ the danger to British interests is greatest and most immi­ nent. . . . T h e Moscow Gazette threatens to dictate at Calcutta the next peace with England.” A n d so it went, with one voice after another raised against the threat. But the Russians saw it otherwise: C ount Nesselrode, the Russian Secretary o f State, com plained in October 18 38 to his ambassador in London o f the\n\n40\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\n“ indefatigable activity displayed by British travellers lagentsl in spreading disquiet among the peoples o f C entral A sia, and in carrying out agitation, even in the heart o f the countries bor­ dering our frontiers, w hile on our part we ask nothing but to be adm itted to share in the fair com petition in the commercial advantages o f A sia. ” In Afghanistan a dynastic battle between two brothers offered Jo h n C om pany an excuse for invasion and occupation, thereby thw arting the Russians, whose “ generals” had been active in directing the armies o f various native princes against each other or against the Persians; opposing armies were in many cases officered by English, French, or Italian mercenaries, often men w ho were veterans o f the N apoleonic Wars. T h e legitimate A f ­ ghan ruler, Sh ah Shuja, had been forced into exile by his younger brother, the very ferocious Dost Muhammad al-M ulk. A fter a temporary refuge at Lahore, where he was relieved o f a rare collection o f jewels, including the famous and much-traveled diam ond the Koh-i-noor, or “ M ountain o f L igh t,” by the wily S ik h leader R an jlt Singh, the Shah found protection under the East India Com pany at Peshawar, an old and rom antic city on the eastern side o f the Khyber Pass. T h e Com pany saw the exiled Sh u ja as a means o f gaining control o f Afghanistan. By now Dost M uham m ad was welcom ing Persians and Russians at his court in Kabul, and the Czar’s agents were operating openly. M ean­ w hile, the English were actively m oving about Sind at the lower end o f the Indus R iver and then upstream to the Punjab, where R a n jlt Sin gh assured them o f his support in an invasion o f A f ­ ghanistan. T h e key figure in these operations was the brilliant young political officer A lexan d er Burnes, who had violated treaties forced upon the Sindhis by going up the Indus to Lahore, where he worked out agreements with R an jlt Singh and the Sikh war­ lords. Burnes had then gone on to the great steppes o f Central A sia to spy out the khanate o f Bokhara and to look over other potential prizes, an act o f daring exploration that made him the\n\nThe Great Gam e\n\n41\n\nlion o f London society when he returned home, after w hich he rejoined his unit in western India. T h e warlike maneuvers o f the English, especially in Sind, despite ail the disclaimers about peaceful “ m ercantile” interests, had stirred the native courts into a state o f anxiety, and the presence o f so many English, openly and in disguise, on the plains and in the passes and valleys, in A fghanistan itself, and even as far as the C entral A sian khanates, was disquieting to the court at Kabul. But, “ my friend,” the English G o vern o r' G eneral o f India, Lord Auckland, told Dost M uhammad, “ you are aware that it is not the practice o f the British governm ent to interfere with the affairs o f other independent n ations.” However, the invasion o f A fghanistan took place in February 18 39 , when the British assembled an army o f several white and native contingents and marched up the Khyber Pass, taking K a­ bul, the major city, with considerable ease. T h e army was com ­ posed o f 9,50 0 British and some 6,000 native troops, many of them Punjabi Muslims raised by Shah Shuja, and the amazing number o f 38 ,0 0 0 camp followers. There was little resistance: Dost M uhammad did not oppose the invaders, and the defense o f Ghazni, one o f the legendary cities o f A sia, was, Burton wrote, conducted by a “ rabble.” Shuja was installed as ruler. U nexpectedly, down on the baking Punjab plain, R anjlt Singh began to fade away o f mysterious causes, possibly a series o f strokes exacerbated by his luxurious manner o f living, and soon died, leaving the British flank exposed, for all the supplies for the army in Afghanistan had to pass through the Punjab and now the many powerful and newly independent Punjabi chieftains who had been controlled by R anjlt Sin gh ’s iron will began to menace the British lines o f com m unication. T h e old Lion o f the Punjab was cremated in the ancient and traditional sacrificial rite known as sati, a term meaning “ faith­ fulness” and w hich denoted the devotion o f a m an’s women even in his death. R an jlt S in gh ’s four wives perished in the flames along with five favorite dancing girls, one o f whom was the\n\n42\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nbeauteous Lotus, a woman known throughout W est A sia for her grace and charm and an especial favorite o f the English officers at the court. “ T h ey are dead— nine living beings having perished together without a shriek or groan ,” lamented a young English officer, C ap tain W . G . Osborne, when he heard o f the crem a­ tion. T h a t the tragedy that followed might have been avoided is possible. It was not until 18 6 1 that it came to light that some o f A lexan d er Burnes’s dispatches from Kabul had been altered to con vey “ opinions opposite to h is.” But no matter. In N ovem ­ ber 18 4 1 Burnes and his brother Charles were cut down by a street mob near their home and their bodies hacked to pieces. T h e British commander, Sir W illiam M acnaghten, did nothing. M ore violen ce continued, with further English deaths. Shah Sh u ja, now a virtual prisoner o f the mob, “ lost all his selfpossession,” according to Lady Florentia Sale, wife o f one o f the ranking English officers, “ and told the 860 females o f his zenana [harem] that if the cantonm ent fell to the enemy, he would poison them a ll.” O n December twenty-third M acnaghten and three other officers went on horseback to meet A khbar Khan, son o f the now-exiled Dost Muhammad. M acnaghten and one officer were shot down, the other two taken prisoner. T h e heads o f the two murdered men were hung on hooks in a butcher shop in the bazaar. Soon uprisings began among the more outlying tribes, and by the end o f 18 4 1 the unrest had spread to Kabul. W ith total chaos now reigning and with armed gangs running through the streets, the rem aining British leaders decided that the only solution was to retreat. A handful o f officers were turned over as hostages, along w ith the wives o f the higher officers. Som e o f the wives o f the lower ranks of the British abandoned their husbands, put on A fg h an dress, and joined the enemy. A fter negotiating what they thought was a safe-conduct for leaving Afghanistan, the English set o ff on January 5, 18 4 2, for refuge on the warm plains o f India, some sixteen thousand people, English and native\n\nThe Great Gam e\n\n43\n\ntroops, and camp followers. T h e entire force— all sixteen thousand— was destroyed in that famous retreat through snowcovered passes under constant A fghan attack by tribesmen armed with knives and swords. There was one survivor, Dr. W illiam Brydon, whose name became a household word in England as a symbol o f V ictorian bravery. Such, in brief, were the tangled events and the great tragedy that brought young Richard Burton to India to play a role in the G reat G am e.\n\nt\n\n5 The G riff\n\nO\n\nn June 18 , 18 4 2, having been “ duly wept o ver,” Burton set sail from G reenw ich aboard the John K nox on a four-month voyage to India, leaving home “ with the scantiest regrets,” miss­ ing no one except his relatives, and looking forward to serving in the campaign that would retake Afghanistan and avenge the tragic defeat o f the army o f occupation. W ith him aboard ship were twenty other ensigns (they were commonly called griffs, or griffins, in the current military slang) as eager as he for active service. W hat pleased him most about the John K nox were the three native servants who spoke Hindustani. During the voyage Burton boxed with the captain, taught the art o f the sword to his fellow griffs, bathed alongside the ship in a sail to fend off sharks, and shot some “ unhappy birds.” T h e ch ief part o f his time, he said, was passed in working at Hindustani. He read all the Eastern books on board, but best o f all, he had the servants to talk to. T h e Jo h n K nox rounded the wintry C ape o f G ood Hope, “ and a wonderful scene it w as,” as “ waves measuring miles 45\n\n46\n\nCAPTAIN\n\nSIR\n\nRICHARD\n\nFRANCIS\n\nBURTON\n\nin length came up from the South P ole.” Four months passed in a dream like haze o f play and work, o f boredom and momentary flashes o f excitem ent. M eanw hile, events had changed radically in India, and great campaigns, w hich would affect Burton’s life, had already begun to roll ahead w ith the profound momentum o f armies at war. O n the night o f O ctober twenty-seventh the John Knox made its way through the nets and fishing stakes o f the shallows off the Bom bay coast and anchored among the pattymars and other native craft to await the dawn. For miles offshore the griffs had noted “ that faint spicy odour, as if there were curry in the a"
