Lady Burton's biography was published initially in 1893 as two volumes. Penzer was not impressed by her efforts, noting that she plaiarized Hitchman's work and lacked editing skills, insering many odd and irrelevant items - but not the letters and journals she had destroyed. This is a Very Good copy of a \"New Edition\" from five years later that has been compressed by Wilkins into one volume, no doubt improving the product greatly. This edition much less common than the First; not in Penzer (Casada #347). Decoratively bound in gray cloth with gilt titling. Blindstamped decoration to rear cover. The front cover features Burton as he appeared during his incognito visit to Mecca, rendered in colour. Clean text; xx, 548 pages. There is a frontis portrait of a fierce Burton; eleven other illustrations within. There is a gift inscription dated 1899 and a notation \"read through for 2nd time\" in February 1938. Light wear to the margins; spotting to the page edges and the endpapers. The spine has darkened, and is now a golden brown. A handsome book. First American Edition. Decorative Cloth.
