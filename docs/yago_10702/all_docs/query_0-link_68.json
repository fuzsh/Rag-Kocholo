        "text": "New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1898. Isabel brought out her two-volume pro-vita memoir in 1893; Penzer was not impressed by her efforts, noting that she plagiarized Hitchman's work and lacked editing skills, insering many odd and irrelevant items - but not the letters and journals she had destroyed. This is a Very Good copy of a \"New Edition\" from five years later that has been compressed by Wilkins into one volume, no doubt improving the product greatly. This edition much less common than the First; not in Penzer (Casada #347). Decoratively bound in gray cloth with gilt titling. Blindstamped decoration to rear cover. The front cover features Burton as he appeared during his incognito visit to Mecca, rendered in colour. Clean text; xx, 548 pages. There is a frontis portrait of a fierce Burton; eleven other illustrations within. Light soiling; rubbed at the margins of the spine, with two short splits at the head; spine slightly darkened. Quercus notes evidence of an interesting provenance: there is a small label on the FFEP from the \"Institute for Sex Research\" (Alfred Kinsey's Institute) and what appears to be a faint call number on the spine. Bookplate on the front paste-down and owner signature opposite. A solid and still-attractive volume. In an archival plastic protector,. First American Edition.. Decorative Cloth. Very Good/No Jacket. 8vo - over 7 \" - 9 \" tall. First Edition."
