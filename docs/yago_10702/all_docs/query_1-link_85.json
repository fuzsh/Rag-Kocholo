        "text": "After Burton’s death Lady Burton destroyed his notebooks, manuscripts and papers but most of his working library remained (his second, the first being destroyed in a fire shortly after his marriage in 1861) as well as some manuscript material and these form the present collection which was received by the Kensington Vestry, the fore runner of the Royal Borough of Kensington, through the executors of Lady Burton’s will. The RAI acquired the Burton Library from the Royal Borough in 1954. It was able to do so through the generosity of the United Africa Company and individual donors and to repair the collection and prepare the catalogue through grants from the Bollingen Foundation, the Leverhulme Trust, and the Esperanza Trust Fund. It received a bequest of items associated with Burton in 1974 from one of his descendants, R.H. Bury. The Library, but not the bequest, was sold to the Christensen Fund in 1986 which deposited it on permanent loan in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California. For the contents of the Library see A catalogue of the Library of Sir Richard Burton, KCMG held by the Royal Anthropological Institute, 1979 compiled by B.J. Kirkpatrick.\n\nSir Richard F. Burton (1821-90) joined the Ethnological Society in 1861 and in 1863 was a founder member of the Anthropological Society taking the Chair at the inaugural meeting at which he was elected Vice-President. He remained in that office until 1866; he was appointed President in 1867 retiring after one year. He was again Vice-President in 1870. He attended the Society’s meetings, read papers, and contributed to its journal. He was among those who formed the breakaway London Anthropological Society but re-established his connection with the Anthropological Institute (formed by the amalgamation of the Ethnological and Anthropological Societies) and was on its Council from 1872-3 and died in office as Vice-President; his obituary was published in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. 20, 1891, pp. 295-8 by E.W. Brabrook.\n\nThe papers in this archive have been selectively retained with categories relating to binding, insurance, and queries (apart from a few of interest) not retained.\n\nContents:\n\n1 Acquisition and installation. 1954-65\n\n2 Grants: United Africa Company\n\n3 Grants: Individual donors and plaque\n\n4 Grants: Bollingen Foundation\n\n5 Grants: Leverhulme Trust\n\n6 Grants: Esperanza Trust Fund\n\n7 Possible sale. 1973-6\n\n8-9 Robert Hugh Bury Bequest\n\n10 Publication of catalogue\n\n11-18 Sale of collection\n\n11 Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. 1981-2\n\n12 RAI Negotiating Committee\n\n13 Solicitors and Counsel. 1981-6\n\n14 Valuation\n\n15 Libraries approached\n\n16 Sotheby’s\n\n17 Press\n\n18 The Christensen Fund. 1985-9\n\n19 Signatures of visitors consulting the collection\n\n20 Biographers consulting the collection\n\n21-2 New editions of Burton’s books\n\n23 Micro publishing of collection\n\n24 Queries\n\n25 Other Burton collections\n\n26 Antiquarian book dealers, Sotheby’s, periodicals\n\n27 Newspaper clippings\n\n28 Miscellaneous\n\nAbbreviations\n\nJB Jonathan Benthall, RAI Director, 1973-2000\n\nDMB David M.
