        "text": "Sir Richard Francis Burton was born in the spring of 1821 in Torquay Devonshire England. He was of a mixed English, Irish and also, it is widely considered, even French ancestry. His father’s personal heritage and military career, though unsuccessful, seems to have been a significant factor in young Richard’s linguistic skills. Even well before he matriculated at Trinity College Oxford in 1840 he had already become fluent in French, Italian as well as in Greek and Latin. So diverse was his continental upbringing that many came to believe that Burton was not entirely dedicated to his national identity. Yet these same critics dared not to take their reservations a step further to brand him unpatriotic, as his diplomatic and intelligence career with the Government of the British Empire was so illustrious and of immeasurable contribution to its Imperial goals that his loyalty to the realm was deemed unquestionable.\n\nDespite his academic success he was expelled from Oxford in 1842 for breaching the disciplinary regime at this leading British University. The incident, which may have besmirched many a promising student did not have any lasting negative impact on Richard, for he next travelled to India as a Sub-altern Officer in 18th Regiment of the Bombay Native Infantry during England’s war with the Sindh. With Burton’s linguistic background it is little wonder that in addition to mastering both Arabic and Hindi , he also managed while in the north Indian subcontinent to gain a few more languages including Punjabi, Pashtu, Sindhi, Telugu, Marathi and Multani during his eight-year stay. His uncanny linguistic skills continued throughout his life to allow him to delve even further to amass not only the ability to converse in twenty-five languages but also forty separate dialects within those languages.\n\nMost people interested in ethnographic studies authored in the colonial days, seem to forget that the most prominent of European Orientalist Travellers not only had government careers but also had experiences as Government spies, and Richard Burton is in no way an exception to that little known fact. It is perhaps when he was the favoured intelligence Officer of Sir Charles James Napier, Commander of the English forces in the Sindh, that Burton first dabbled in dawning on disguises; he would wonder through Bazar’s in enemy territory as a Muslim Merchant to bring back detailed reports to his Superior’s in the British Army. Supporters of the LGBT movement will not be too happy to hear that Richard Burton, under the instructions of the British Empire’s rank and file, had provided enough information for the systematic destruction of homosexual brothels in Karachi in 1845. Even this seemingly straightforward episode of Imperial enforcement of order in their colonial holdings, became a matter of controversy for Burton early in his career when his detailed reports had been leaked to the British Government in Bombay. It seems that his rivals had who seized the opportunity of the end of Napier’s tenure, to ensure that rather than allow Burton’s accomplishment to bolster his future career as a spy, they would instead become a stigma upon his reputation. Needless to say, the incident irreparably damaged his military career. Unsurprisingly, Burton decided to return to Europe and spent three years with his mother and sister in Boulogne during which time he wrote four books including ‘Sindh, and the Races that inhabit the Valley of the Indus’ in 1851 , which is considered a pioneering ethnological study by Academics today.\n\nIt is not known exactly when Burton developed his fascination with the idea of becoming a European traveller to infiltrate deep Arabia and visit the holiest of holies, Mecca. However it would not be wrong to say that his learnings amongst Muslim communities in the North Indian subcontinent had ignited this passion to approach the heart of the Muslim world. Only two years after the publication of his study on the ‘Sindh’, Burton travelled to Cairo, Suez and Medina in 1853 and after disguising himself as a Patan, successfully travelled in and out of Mecca as a pilgrim without being detected; an achievement not to be taken lightly for a European as, both Holy sites (Mecca and Medina) were off limits to non-Muslims since the advent of Islam in the 7th Century AD. Burton was not the first non-Muslim to successfully visit Mecca, however he provided the most sophisticated observations leading him to publish his book ‘Pilgrimage to El Medinah and Mecca between 1855-1856’. The book’s success was owed not simply to classic commentary on Muslim life and manners and the annual greater pilgrimage ‘the Hajj’, but also to the fact that it came across as a great adventure narrative.\n\nHe did not hurry to return to England to revel and capitalize on what was bound to give him unprecedented fame and instead he decided to organise a new expedition to visit the East African city of Harar. This new journey allowed him to author yet another work entitled ‘First footsteps in East Africa’ (1856). Burton now had his eye on discovering the source of the white Nile and so embarked in 1855 as one of three officers of the British East India Company in order to travel through Somali land in order to personally stand at that most alluring of landmarks to European discoverers. One of the party was killed near Berbera and a hurled javelin injured Burton who was forced to return to England before arriving at their intended destination. After recovering in England Burton somehow felt he had not yet satisfied his need for adventure and so volunteered to join the British Army in 1855 in what has now become known as that most infamous war of the Crimea. Despite his need for adventure, he saw little action in the front as he was designated with the role of training Turkish irregulars throughout the war’s duration. Burton’s failed mission to stand at the source of the white Nile led him to co-ordinate with his co-survivor of the attack at Berbera, John Speke, to yet again embark on their African discovery. Then finally arrived on the shores of lake Tanganyika at immense personal physical expense; for Burton could hardly walk due to malaria and Speke was almost blind. To make his disappointment greater, Burton discovered that the lake was in fact not the source of the Nile and that the Rusizi river poured into the lake rather than out of it. Burton decided to call it quits and return to prepare for a new expedition while Speke recovered more quickly from his ailment and continued the journey to the northeast to finally discover Lake Victoria which he became convinced was the true source of the river Nile. Burton’s refusal to accept Speke’s theory without further exploration, inevitably led to a parting of ways of the two explorers. Speke’s newfound fame in England lead to his receiving backing for a return to Africa, but Burton’s attempts to attract sponsors for his own expedition failed and in the true spirit of Burton’s indomitable character, he went on to author a new work entitled ‘Lake Regions of Central Africa’ (1860), in which he criticised Speke’s claims.\n\nBurton’s notoriety did not stop him from yet a new adventure , not into Asia or Arabia or Africa, but this time to the United States of America, where he travelled by Stagecoach to another, yet albeit more recent holy site, the Mormon Capital of Salt Lake city, allowing him to author a new publication entitled ‘City of the Saints’ (1861). This work demonstrated that Burton’s expertise in sociological survey was not limited to non-English speaking cultures for he had composed an illustrious description of the leader of the Mormon Church, BrigHam Young, and the continued practice of polygamy by the Mormons, which was then a cause for outrage by most Americans. His experience studying the Mormons casual yet firm approach to the institution of marriage, may have led to his finally deciding after courting a young English lady her for five years to secretly marry Isabel Arundell in 1856.\n\nSo illustrious a publishing, exploring, spying and military career was Burton’s, that he didn’t find much difficulty in being offered a position with the British Foreign Office and was so appointed as a Consul in Fernando Po, a Spanish Island off the coast of west Africa. Never quite satisfied his appetite for exploration and writing only grew with age, producing yet another five books based on his short trips to west Africa, in which he provides descriptions of tribal rituals and bizarre practices. Though these works did not win him much favour with the Foreign Office at the time, they have been considered as invaluable anthropological and historical studies for generations since.\n\nReturning to London for a personal vacation in September 1864, Burton found himself invited by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to debate with non-other than his co-discoverer and now rival, Speke. The debates began in September but after the very first session Speke was found mysteriously shot while hunting. Though the coroners jury considered the death an accident, Burton insisted it was suicide, while others rumoured that it was Burton who had shot him. Somehow even this mysterious incident did not stop the Foreign Office from redeploying Burton once again and so he found himself spending 4 years, from 1865-1869 in Santos Brazil as British Consul to the country.\n\nOnce again, typical to Burton’s former history he goes yet on to author another book about the highlands of Brazil entitled; ‘Vikram the Vampire’ or ‘Tales of Hindu Devilry’ (1870). Burton did not limit his writing to his thoughts alone as he also translated the works of a Portuguese Explorer, Luis de Camoes. Despite his deep sense of association with de Camoes disposition, it did not assist him to overcome his growing detest for Brazil, and so increasingly took to alcoholic consumption and resorting finally to sending his wife to London to lobby for a better post for him. Isabel succeeded in persuading the Foreign Secretary to appoint Burton in the land he loved the most, not just any Muslim territory but Arabia itself as Consul in Damascus.\n\nDespite his contentment with this posting, did not go well at all for Burton, as his wife’s missionary zeal, as a Roman Catholic, resulted in a humiliating dismissal in 1871. Through this incident was detailed in Isabel’s own writing, ‘Inner life of Syria’ published in 1875, it was not totally unrelated to another controversial study he had conducted regarding the Sephardim Jews in Damascus. It wasn’t long after, that Burton returned to a new post with the Foreign Office in the Consulate at Trieste in 1872. Though he considered it to be a form of exile, it turned out to become his cherished home, where he resided until his death, publishing a host of books spanning matters from Iceland to Boulogne to the gold mines of Midian and the African gold coast and probably most popular of all his works put together the title ‘Book of the Sword’ (1884), which brought him the greatest financial success. Burton also translated Arabian Nights, which he is said to have embellished plentifully; and he also authored his best original poetry the ‘Kasidah’ which was patterned after Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, the famous Sufi poet. Other publications were considered highly risque for the times as he secretly printed books to introduce the sexual wisdom of the ancient east to the western readers, covering the ‘Kama Sutra’ (1883) and ‘The perfumed Garden of the Shaikh Nefzaoui’ (1886). Thus Richard Burton ended his legacy of undercover intelligence diplomacy and anthropology to have his name eternally stigmatized with a reputation of propagator of Eastern vice to English speaking Western intellectual circles which have eternally undermined centuries old Christian morality and decades of Victorian values."
