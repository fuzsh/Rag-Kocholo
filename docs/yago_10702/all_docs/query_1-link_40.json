I hope you will like the book, although perhaps you may disagree with part of it'.She continues, 'I have been very personal, and have sacrificed myself completely in the telling of it, and it was very painful raking up past life and old papers and journals and letters, but I have not come to the end of a quarter of my papers yet, half of which are not sorted and I shall have, if I live to do it, to bring out another two volumes [.] it seems to me as if the subject was so inexhaustible that I shall never be able to stop'.Alice ('Lallah') Bird, and her brother, Dr. George Bird, are mentioned within the work, and feature in the index. She describes Dr. George Bird as a 'pseudo-orientalist'.On page 342 of volume I, Isabel describes, following the marriage ceremony of her and Burton: 'After the ceremony was over, and the names signed, we went back to the house of our friend Dr. Bird, and his sister Alice, who have always been our best friends, where we had our wedding breakfast'.With three panel photographs loosely inserted: the first depicts a young Burton in a fencing pose, and is signed by him at the tail in both English and Arabic, and issigned on the reverse \"Alice Bird Dec 3 1875; the second depicts Burton in later life in top hat, with a presentation inscription to the reverse signed by 'Dick &amp; Isabel', in Isabel's hand, and the third depicting Lady Isabel Burton.The first edition, complete in two volumes.Volume I illustrated with a frontispiece, three colour plates, eight monochrome plates, and in-text illustrations, and volume II illustrated with a frontispiece, six monochrome plates, and in-text illustrations.
