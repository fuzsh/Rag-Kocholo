Publisher's blind-ruled black cloth, gilt-lettered spines, upper and lower covers illustrated in gilt, (very slightly frayed at head and foot of spines). Provenance: Kenneth Grahame (inscribed to him 'from the Publishers August 10th 1893' on Vol. I endpaper); Administrative staff college (stamp on verso of titles).\n\nPUBLISHERS PRESENTATION COPY OF AN UNRECORDED ISSUE ON HANDMADE VAN GELDER PAPER, a full 15mm taller than the trade issue, with top edges gilt, others uncut, with the publisher's gilt imprint on the spines above the date. As well the highly unusual association connected to this set, the edition is very complete with a new preface by Lady Burton, a reprinting of the First and Third Edition prefaces, the various appendices of all the past editions and a full index, with the chapter arrangement conforming to the second edition. Kenneth Grahame (1859-1932), author of 'The Wind in the Willows' 1908, began his career at the Bank of England in 1879, rising to Secretary in 1898. The year this set was presented to him he had just published his first work, 'Pagan Papers.' This issue is unknown to Penzer."
