        "text": "The blog has been very quiet during June and July as it’s been quite a couple of months! At the very end of June the sale of our house was completed. Since then Karin and I have been staying with family and friends, doing some house-sitting and living in Air BnBs as we completed work commitments, and traveled around the country seeing people, prior to our departure to Denmark.\n\nDuring a trip to London last week we managed to squeeze in a side trip to a place that I have longed to visit for over 30 years: the tomb of Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton and his wife Lady Isabel Burton. As I recounted in a post a few years ago, Burton’s life and exploits have long been a subject of fascination for me – see: Sex and drugs and the source of the Nile.\n\nThe couple’s burial place is in Mortlake – check out the Burtonia website for details. The mausoleum, designed by Lady Isabel, is in the form of an Arabian tent, and features both Christian and Islamic imagery – very fitting for a man who converted to Islam and was given Catholic last rights on his death bed at the insistence of his wife.\n\nAn unusual feature of the tomb is that there is a set of steel steps leading to a glass window at the rear, through which one can view the devoted couple’s coffins and grave goods. It’s a poignant and touching experience. Below are some photographs that we took on the day."
