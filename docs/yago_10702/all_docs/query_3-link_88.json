        "text": "Isabel Burton was born 20 March 1831 and died 22 March 1896.\n\nQuotes\n\nWhere I have seen good I shall speak of it with pleasure, and where I have seen the reverse, I shall try to be silent; for a book is meant to give pleasure, and pain that is inflicted in black and white lasts for ever.\n\nI must just think aloud, so as not to keep the public waiting.\n\nI have no leisure to think of style or of polish, or to select the best language, the best English – no time to shine as an authoress. I must just think aloud, so as not to keep the public waiting.\n\nLady Isabel Burton was an English writer. She was the wife and partner of explorer, adventurer, and writer Sir Richard Francis Burton. She is the author of The Romance of Isabel, Lady Burton: The Story of Her Life and The Life of Captain Sir Richd F. Burton.\n\nSource for quotes\n\nby Amanda Patterson\n\nPlease click here for our Literary Birthday Calendar\n\nPosted on: 20th March 2018\n\n(3,374 views)"
