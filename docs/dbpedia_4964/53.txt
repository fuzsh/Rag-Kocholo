Mya Byrne is a celebrated Americana singer-songwriter and firecracker guitarist, combining influences from countrypolitan to glam-pop, blues, and ghostly incantations into a singular voice and vision, with elements of John Prine’s whimsy, Leonard Cohen’s spiritual gravitas, Dylan’s wit, and Lucinda Williams’ aching sensuality. Like a crackling backyard fire outside of a city at dusk, stars on one side of the sky and light pollution on the other, Mya’s music is in the pocket of traditional country and Americana, yet firmly rooted in the modern world.

Mimi’s second solo album, “Rhinestone Tomboy”, produced by Grammy-nominated songwriter Aaron Lee Tasjan, is out now on Kill Rock Stars, praised by NPR, Rolling Stone, and No Depression, among others. Her appearance at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena for the Love Rising benefit in March was lauded by NPR’s Ann Powers as an event highlight. Her first two singles on RT were in constant rotation on CMT, and she is the first out queer trans woman to be an official Gibson Guitars artist.

Her work both on and offstage for social justice drives her passionate, fiery music, and she’s an absolute sweetheart who will make you cookies at midnight if you ask nicely.
