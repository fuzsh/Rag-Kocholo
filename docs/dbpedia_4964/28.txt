Singer/Songwriter

Recently relocated to San Francisco by way of NYC, Mya Byrne is a poet, award-winning performing songwriter, and activist. A proud trans woman, she established her solo folk-Americana career in 2012 after years of performing with roots-rock band, the Ramblers, opening for acts such as Levon Helm.

Myaâ€™s been featured on many great festival and club stages across the country. Her first solo record hit #31 on the roots charts, and the follow-up, As I Am, is out now. Recently chosen as an Emerging Artist at the legendary Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, her music and poetry have also been featured in such media as SingOut!, The Advocate, Village Voice, New York Magazine, MSNBC, and CBS/Radio.com, with public speaking at institutions including SUNY and the UU.
