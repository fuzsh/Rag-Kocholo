        "text": "By ROBERT PRICE\n\nbprice@njherald.com\n\nNerissa Nields remembers fondly the early '90s heyday of the female singer-songwriter. Suzanne Vega, Shawn Colvin, Sinead O'Connor, Ani DiFranco, Dar Williams, Tracy Chapman and many, many more, found their niche on concert stages and airwaves around the world with a new kind of intelligent, often emotional or introspective music.\n\n\"I've always felt a part of this sisterhood. It's exciting to see it still being celebrated,\" said Nields, who with her sister, Katryna, will headline the fourth annual Muses in the Vineyard festival.\n\n\"Surely those pioneering women paved the way for today's artists, like Adele, Sara Bareilles, Brandi Carlile, Ingrid Michaelson and even Taylor Swift,\" she said.\n\nBeyond folk, not quite rock, the music was almost always message-laden and melodic, with a soft yet strong beat ... like the women delivering it.\n\nThe Massachusetts-based Nields have been doing it since 1991. This, their second time at the Muses festival, finds them promoting their 17th album. What better place to share their longstanding musical inspiration.\n\n\"My sister is my muse,\" Nerissa said. \"Though I write the songs, she usually has come up with an idea for me to get me started. It's a wonderful thing for a songwriter to have a partner. Because we've been at this for so long, she's able to say ‘That's not your best work. Try something else' or ‘What if the song went in this other direction....'\"\n\nThe Muses in the Vineyard Festival, to be held at Four Sisters Winery May 16 and 17, is the brainchild of brothers Brian and Blair McCloskey, of Foul Rift Productions. The festival, built as a non-profit venture, will benefit the Animal Welfare Society of Monroe this year.\n\nThe McCloskeys developed a passion for \"women's music\" early on and that passion has turned into a weekend of \"music of the women, by the women and for everyone,\" as their motto states, at Four Sisters in White Township, between Belvidere and Hope.\n\n\"... I think that women in general write in a more honest and emotionally open and available prose. Vulnerability and strength are on display and create a vortex that we can't sidestep.... The joy and the sadness, the power and the beauty create a landscape and consciousness that we identify with and are drawn into,\" said Brian McCloskey, whose love for the genre began with the albums \"Blue\" by Joni Mitchell and \"Tapestry\" by Carole King in the 1970s.\n\nTret Fure, a self-described mother of women's music, may well have been an inspiration for some in the '90s crowd. Her career spans four decades, including an early gig with Welsh blues musician Spencer Davis.\n\nShe's happy to be performing (Saturday) at the Muses festival, where she'll undoubtedly break out some new music from her 15th album, due out this fall.\n\n\"I think it's fabulous. Coming from a 45-year history in music back to a time when labels only had one woman artist and also coming from a background of ‘women's music,' I see that there is still a need to feature women. We are still too often second class in the world of music. This gives us an opportunity to shine,\" Fure said.\n\nJordana Greenberg, fiddler for Harpeth Rising, agrees. \"This business is difficult for almost everyone, regardless of gender. That being said, there are certainly some unique struggles that come with the territory, particularly being both young and female. You have to make defying expectations your speciality,\" Greenberg said.\n\nHarpeth Rising is a genre-bending trio that also includes Rebecca Reed-Lunn (banjo) and Maria DiMeglio (cello). The harmony-rich group performs Sunday. Their upcoming album, \"Shifted,\" comes out July 1.\n\n\"There are so many amazing women making music right now, and it's nice to acknowledge that. The women in this lineup are all very unique as songwriters and musicians, so we are anticipating a pretty special weekend,\" Greenberg said.\n\nIn addition to Fure, Saturday's lineup includes Beth Sherby, Lori Diamond, Dina Hall, Mieka Pauley, 9 5ive 4our featuring Christine Havrilla, Gretchen Schultz and Christine Moll, Natalia Zukerman and Nalani & Sarina.\n\nHall, who recently released the vocally powerful folk-rock collection \"Logic and the Heart,\" has been a part of the festival since the beginning, either as a performer or emcee.\n\nPhiladelphia rocker Havrilla played last year with her band Gypsy Fuzz and is back with a new project.\n\nPop-soul youngsters Nalani and Sarina have been tearing up the local scene while also hitting some bigger stages like The Bitter End in New York and Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pa.\n\nSunday kicks off with a quartet from the NYC Songwriters Circle (Carolann Solebello, Karyn Oliver, Honor Finnegan, Mya Byrne), and continues with Jerzy Jung, Amanda Duncan, Grace Morrison, Harpeth Rising, Sloan Wainwright and The Nields.\n\nMusic festivals, by their very nature, involve a lot of musical cross-pollination, impromptu jams and socializing among performers, and the Muses festival is no exception.\n\n\"I applaud the organizers of Muses in the Vineyard for putting female performers front and center at a two-day festival,\" said Carolann Solebello, of the NYC Songwriters Circle. \"So many festivals don't feature nearly enough women onstage, so Muses is really a breath of fresh air, and surely unique in that way. One of the main reasons I love festival season is the chance to see, hear and sometimes even collaborate with performers I admire. We spend the rest of the year just passing each other on the highway on the way to our respective gigs, so I see festivals like this as a kind of gathering of the tribe.\"\n\nFans of the Americana group Red Molly will remember Solebello as an original member before she left for a solo career. With Karyn Oliver, Honor Finnegan, Mya Byrne, she is representing the NYC Songwriters Circle, a 30-year-old organization founded by the late, great Greenwich Village songwriter Jack Hardy.\n\n\"I love and admire the three women I'll be sharing the stage with with at Muses ... but we are as different from each other as the day is long,\" Solebello said. \"Jack was passionate about songwriting, and believed that if you wanted to get better at the craft, you must practice constantly, pursuing inspiration rather than waiting for it to strike out of the blue.\"\n\nSloan Wainwright is sure to present a high point Sunday with her amazing range and jazzy style. Part of a musical family, she's the younger sister of Loudon Wainwright III and aunt to Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright and Lucy Wainwright Roche, so she should have no shortage of muses.\n\nNo doubt each of the women performing has her own perception of a muse. But surely they would all agree with Tret Fure, the \"mother of women's music,\" who says, \"... there is always a need to see women shine in their own light. To me, the definition of ‘muse' is inspiration.\"\n\nIf you go ...\n\nWhat: Muses in the Vineyard festival\n\nWhen: May 16-17 from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Four Sisters Winery, 783 Route 519, Belvidere\n\nAdmission: $27.50 day, $45 weekend (ages 13-17, $12.50/$20); at gate $35 day, $55 weekend (ages 13-17, $15/$25); 12 and under free.\n\nInformation, tickets: www.musesinthevineyard.com, 570-801-1771\n\nLineup\n\nSaturday, May 16\n\nBeth Sherby, Lori Diamond, Dina Hall, Mieka Pauley, 9 5ive 4our (Christine Havrilla, Gretchen Schultz, Christine Moll), Nalani & Sarina, Natalia Zukerman, Tret Fure\n\nSunday, May 17\n\nNYC Songwriters Circle (Carolann Solebello, Karyn Oliver, Honor Finnegan, Mya Byrne), Jerzy Jung, Amanda Duncan, Grace Morrison, Harpeth Rising, Sloan Wainwright, The Nields"
