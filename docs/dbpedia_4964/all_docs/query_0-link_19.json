        "text": "WINNER: Congratulations to philbender!\n\nOutpost in the Burbs presents Joseph Arthur in concert on Friday night, December 12th and Baristanet has two tickets to give to one lucky reader!\n\nThis concert will bring Joseph Arthur back to the Outpost stage for the second time. His December 2013 show, in which Arthur set up a canvas and created a painting on the stage while singing, was an audience favorite. Arthur has been known to start working on a new album — or two — while simultaneously trying to finish another. It was amid this abundance of riches that the Brooklyn-by way of Ohio native began molding a collection of music for his 2013 album: The Ballad of Boogie Christ, described by Arthur as “a fictionalized character loosely based on my own journey.” It was followed by the The Ballad of Boogie Christ Act 2 which included contributors such as the Band’s legendary pianist Garth Hudson, bassist Catherine Popper and multi-instrumentalist Kraig Jarret Johnson.\n\nThis year, Arthur released an album in tribute to Lou Reed called “Lou, The Songs of Lou Reed,” a song and video in tribute to Robin\n\nWilliams, and most recently, a song entitled “Where Is Our Freedom” in response to the events in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nOpening for Joseph Arthur will be Maplewood, New Jersey native Mya Byrne.\n\nWant to see Joseph Arthur With Special Guest Mya Byrne at Outpost in the Burbs on Friday night? Tell us why and we’ll randomly choose a winner to see the show this Friday, December 12 at 8 pm.\n\nJoseph Arthur With Special Guest Mya Byrne\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Montclair, 67 Church Street, Montclair, NJ\n\nFriday, December 12 at 8 pm\n\nTickets are $22 in advance / $25 at the door and can be purchased online here.\n\nOutpost volunteers will be collecting donations of new, unwrapped toys for Toys for Tots at this concert to be delivered to under-privileged youth for the holidays."
