        "text": "874\n\nJersey-based singer-songwriter Spook Handy assembled an all-star folk-scene cast — including elder statesmen Noel Paul Stookey (of Peter, Paul & Mary) and Tom Paxton — for a virtual remake of his anthem, “Vote.”\n\nYou can watch it below.\n\nThe tone of the song is light but its message is serious. The chorus goes:\n\nVote! Don’t you never mind the weather.\n\nGet your butt in the booth and pull down the lever.\n\nVote! For worse or for better\n\nVote!\n\nOthers in the video include Christine Lavin, John McCutcheon, Guy Davis, Tret Fure, Emma’s Revolution, Friction Farm, Tom Florek, Dave Rimelis, Dennis Warner, Pat Lamanna, Ron Greenstein, Bob Harris & Cyndy Huang, Eric Lambert, Cheryl Prashker, Carla Ulbrich, Diane Perry, Debra Cowan, Carol Crittenden, Tommy Strazza, Lauren Mayer, Chris Birmingham, Shanna in a Dress, Mya Byrne, Rik Palieri, Carl Alderson, Gregg Cagno, Dave Sherman, Sharon & Greg Metz, and Tracy Colletto.\n\nAt the end of the video, as the credits roll, Lamanna sings a new verse and chorus she wrote for the tune, that goes, in part:\n\nYou can vote as early as the law allows\n\nAvoid the long lines, avoid the crowds\n\nAnd you won’t have worry ’bout COVID-19\n\nEven better yet put your ballot in the mail\n\nDon’t listen to no politician’s tale\n\nBut whatever you do, do it without fail"
