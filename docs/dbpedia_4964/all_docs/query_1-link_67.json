        "text": "In 2015, radio consultant Keith Hill provoked outrage by saying out loud what had long been an unwritten rule for much of country music radio: Women are like the tomatoes in a lettuce salad, they should be sprinkled in sparsely. Despite Hill’s comments and the country music industry's often restrictive and prescriptive attitudes, women are essential to the genre and its growth.\n\nFemale country singers have broken the rules and fought sexist expectations since the genre's inception. Just five years after the first country music recording, the Carter Family cut their first album — often considered country music’s \"Big Bang\" — at the 1927 Bristol Sessions. In 1952, Kitty Wells' \"It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" placed the blame for unfaithful women squarely on the shoulders of philandering men in a retort so resounding, hardly anyone remembers the song that inspired it.\n\nA decade later, Bobbie Gentry scored a No. 1 in 1967 and three GRAMMY Awards with a torpid ballad about apathy and suicide (\"Ode to Billie Joe\"). Loretta Lynn routinely took a defiantly feminist stance (although she rejected the label) in her music and had her song \"The Pill,\"about how birth control pills liberated women, banned from most radio play. Throughout her career, Dolly Parton's hit songs have dealt with gender-neutral gut-wrenching poverty and pretty much every aspect of womanhood.\n\nContemporary acts continue the work of their forebearers, pushing the genre toward inclusivity and demanding respect in the male-dominated genre. Stars like Shania Twain and Faith Hill followed by Margo Price, Kacey Musgraves, Micky Guyton and Maren Morris have deftly charted their own stories, rejecting the genre's rigid stereotypes. Allison Russell, Rhiannon Giddens, Brennen Leigh and Sierra Ferrell (and many other artists) have shifted country music sonically, bringing bluegrass, Western swing, blues, and traditional folk-inspired tunes back into broad circulation.\n\nTogether, they represent a new generation of female country singers who have cracked open the notoriously slow-to-change genre, nudging it toward aural, queer, gender and racial diversity. These musicians aren’t waiting for radio DJs to slot them in between male stars; they’re leveraging social media, YouTube and Spotify to reach an audience tired of hearing the same old sad and exploitive songs. Avoiding stereotypes and the neat niches country music carved for them, these women sing about motherhood, wifehood, womanhood, sex, hard work, struggle and loss and yes, love and heartbreak too — but on their terms.\n\nWhile it’s by no means a comprehensive list, here are five women essential to the future of country music who you may not have heard of, but should know.\n\nSummer Dean\n\nOn her 43rd birthday, the Ameripolitan Music Awards named Summer Dean 2023’s \"Honky Tonk Female.\"The best-known twangy, danceable honky tonk-style tracks go to men, but Dean flips their signature bravado on its head with brash songs about a single woman’s empowerment.\n\nSince her debut EP Unladylike, Dean’s drawn power and inspiration from her own experience, singing about both the joy and sadness in not following social expectations of womanhood. \"I’m all alone / Just a woman on her own / Writing songs with no baby and no vow,\" she sings, neatly skewering country music’s preconceived ideals of a woman’s path in life on \"Picket Fence,\" which opens her 2021 album Bad Romantic.\n\nDean, a seventh-generation Texan, started her country music career in her late 30s after years of teaching elementary school. Making up for lost time, she’s collected accolades fast: A wildly successful duet with Canadian Western music heavyweight Colter Wall; opening gigs for Nikki Lane, Marty Stuart, and Charley Crockett; and her own co-headlining tour this spring. This summer, Dean will release her second full-length album, The Biggest Life.\n\nJaime Wyatt\n\nSometimes Jaime Wyatt’s backstory sounds like any number of gritty, sad country songs — she served most a year in L.A. County jail for robbing her heroin dealer, struggled with addiction, and lost a best friend to drug overdose. Although her experiences feed her music, Wyatt uses them to illuminate relatable, meaningful stories that are anything but cliché.\n\nWyatt's 2017 debut EP, Felony Blues, draws heavily from her experiences with addiction and jail. Moving beyond those early experiences, she unpacks them, her sexuality and outlook on life in her Shooter Jennings-produced Neon Cross, released in 2020. Thriving on Wyatt’s smoky, intoxicating voice, the album’s title track ruminates on the hazy purgatory of nights lost in dim, alcohol-soaked bars; \"Rattlesnake Girl\" simultaneously celebrates gay joy and puts anyone who might mess with Wyatt on notice; and Wyatt owns her power as a woman in \"Just a Woman,\" a duet with Jessi Colter, Jennings’ mother, whose own outlaw country career was often overshadowed by her husband, Waylon Jennings.\n\nWyatt recently performed at Willie Nelson’s famous Luck Reunion, and this summer will hit other big stages, including the Stagecoach Music Festival and Red Rocks Amphitheater.\n\nMiko Marks\n\nMusicians of color, especially Black women, have been systematically sidelined by country music in spite of their foundational contributions to the genre. Fifteen years after her first run at country music success, Miko Marks is back and flourishing with a series of songs rooted both in her own experience and the genre’s history.\n\nWith a heady mixture of country, blues and gospel influences, Marks highlights Black contributions to country music. On 2021’s Our Country, her first album after returning to music, she reclaimed the genre; 2022's Feels Like Home hinted at a broader, inclusive future for the genre. In between, Marks reimagined a slice of country music history with her 2021 EP, Race Records, a compilation of some of country’s best-known songs, for which she borrowed the name given to music marketed to Black listeners by the companies that started branding country music for white people in the 1920s.\n\nMarks performed with the Black Opry, a collective of artists designed to lift up and highlight roots musicians of color. Last year, Marks made her Grand Ole Opry debut and was part of CMT’s Next Women of Country Class of 2022. On March 24, she released a single with Rissi Palmer, \"Still Here.\"\n\nThe Local Honeys\n\nIn pop culture and politics, Kentucky evokes strong associations for almost everyone — a fact of which country and folk duo The Local Honeys are acutely aware. With nuanced, closely-worded songs, they critique and dignify the complicated stories and history of their beloved Appalachia.\n\nTheir first album, 2017's Little Girls Acting Like Men, kicks off with \"Cigarette Trees,\" an anthemic takedown of the coal industry whose fiery message is accompanied by banjo and fiddle. The track planted Linda Jean Stokley and Montana Hobbs squarely in a long tradition of folk music that blends activism with oral history. Like their first album, the Honeys’ subsequent recordings, 2019’s This Gospel and The Local Honeys, released last year, feature a mixture of traditionally-inspired ballads and new folk songs that subvert and complicate typical Appalachian narratives.\n\nThe Honeys’ catchy songs and achingly-human, tragic and sometimes funny vignettes earned them tours with Colter Wall and Tyler Childers, a documentary about coal’s devastating effects and the region’s resilience for Patagonia and Pop-Up Magazine’s Working Knowledge series, and a record deal with La Honda Records.\n\nHannah Juanita\n\nSo often in country music, men get to do all the leavin'. Declaring themselves unable to resist the siren call of adventure, they’re gone in a cloud of dust and three chords and the truth. Women in country music rarely hit the road and when they do, they often aren’t the ones who get to tell the story. But Hannah Juanita wrote a whole album about leaving — and then did.\n\nFeeling stuck in a life that didn’t turn out the way she hoped, Juanita penned the songs for her debut album Hardliner as solace from a failing relationship and then moved to Nashville to sell it. Snappy and straightforward, with traditional country steel guitars, western swing and bluegrass’ sway, and a dash of conjunto, the album’s catchy sing-along lyrics sound like miles flying by on the road with one hand tapping a beat on the steering wheel.\n\nNow a mainstay of the local Nashville scene, Juanita released her new single \"Memory of You,\" on March 31.\n\nCountry & Western's New Generation Is Defiantly Of The Moment: Meet Charley Crockett, Colter Wall, Sierra Ferrell, Bella White & Others\n\nWhen country singer/songwriter Jaime Wyatt announced she was queer with the release of her second album, 2020's Neon Cross, she was convinced doing so would destroy her career. Instead, something shifted — not only was she more free to be herself and to date women openly, but many fans reacted positively, too.\n\n\"Several times on the road I've had fans come up to me with their same sex partner, and they're like, 'Hey, we feel safe here. It's so awesome because we both love country music, and we're not out of the closet, and we're not out to our families, but we can be here,'\" Wyatt says.\n\nModern country music is generally perceived as a conservative genre, and deep-rooted cultural and industry biases have long excluded LGBTQIA+ (and BIPOC) artists and stories from the genre. For example, in 2010, when successful mainstream country artist Chely Wright came out, her career stalled and record sales halved. Kacey Musgraves was criticized for lyrics supporting same-sex love in her beloved anthem, \"Follow Your Arrow.\" More recently, even, Wyatt walked out of a recording session after the owner of the space asked if she was singing \"'some gay s—.'\"\n\nBut Wyatt is also one of a growing number of country artists who, in recent years, have blazed a trail through country music and toward acceptance. Among them, Adeem the Artist, Mya Byrne, Brandi Carlile, Brandy Clark, Mary Gauthier, Lizzy No, Orville Peck, Lily Rose, and Allison Russell. Together, they're celebrating queerness alongside their love for the genre, and pushing it into diversity with patience, tenacity, and darn good country music.\n\n\"If you listen to popular music, or if you listen to hip-hop music, it feels like there's a broader diversity to a lot of subcultures as far as what you're able to access,\" nonbinary country singer/songwriter Adeem the Artist says. \"Whereas with country music, it's very linear, it's very myopic, and singular in its expression.\"\n\nBy way of broadening country's storytelling, Adeem plays a honky-tonk blend of classic and '90s country music that's sonically aligned with the deep musical traditions in Tennessee, where they now live. Lyrically, though, their propensity for gorgeous, frankly worded songs complicate stereotypical southern narratives in rare and provocative ways. On White Trash Revelry, their 2022 studio album, they grapple with racism, economic entrapment, gun violence, and family heritage. And their latest, Anniversary, released in May, includes songs about mental health, the poignance of parenthood, and the pain and fear of being a queer person in a world that threatens their existence.\n\nIndeed, some of the places in the U.S. with the strongest ties to country music remain the least hospitable to queer people. Just last year, Tennessee, home of Nashville, the country music capital of the world, passed a total of 10 bills aimed at LGBTQIA+ people, while Texas, perhaps country music's second-best known state, passed 20 percent of all anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation in the U.S. What's more, LGBTQIA+ people and culture have been targeted by numerous attacks around the world — including the Pulse nightclub and Club Q shootings stateside — in the last few years alone.\n\nFor many, the consequences of not coming out, of not sharing their full selves with the world, are risky, too. Growing up, Wyatt had no role model to show her it was okay to be queer. She struggled for years with mental health and substance abuse and was convicted of robbing her heroin dealer as a young adult. \"I needed to see someone who looked like me when I was a young child,\" Wyatt says. \"And maybe I wouldn't have been a dope fiend in jail.\"\n\nBut while straight white men comprise most of country music's standard slate of forebearers, women and people in the BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ communities have contributed to the genre since its beginning. Notably, it was Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a queer Black woman, who in the 1950s introduced reverb to gospel and rhythm and blues music — and in doing so, she forever changed guitar playing, and inspired some of country music's biggest trailblazers, from Elvis to Johnny Cash.\n\nIn 1973 — four years after the Stonewall uprising kickstarted a widespread gay liberation movement — Patrick Haggerty and his band Lavender Country released what is generally considered the first gay country album. But after it sold out its first pressing of 1000 copies, the album was mostly forgotten until 1999, when the Journal of Country Music published an article hailing Haggerty as \"the lost pioneer of out gay country music.\" Haggerty began performing again and in 2014, indie label Paradise of Bachelors reissued the Lavender Country album, securing Haggerty status as a grandfather figure to queer country.\n\nHaggerty's reissue landed in a different world than the album's original run. In the interim, a handful of artists released more queer country music, including Jeff Miller, aka \"John Deere Diva,\" known for his George Strait parody, \"Not Really Strait,\" as well as Doug Stevens and the Outband's When Love Is Right and Sid Spencer's Out-N-About Again, which put lyrically gay songs to country music.\n\nIn 2011, shortly before the Lavender Country reissue, queer country singer/songwriter and music scholar Karen Pittleman convened the first Gay Ole Opry in Brooklyn's now defunct Public Assembly performance space, launching more than a decade of queer country events, tours and a far-reaching network of performers and supporters. And in 2015, gay marriage became legal nationwide.\n\nAs progress has accelerated culturally in the near decade since, it has in country music, too. In 2018, Paisley Fields' debut album Glitter and Sawdust merged cowboy grit with queer raunch. In 2019, Lil Nas X's \"Old Town Road\" provoked country music to re-consider the nature and identity of country music. In 2021, T.J. Osborne of the Brothers Osborne became the first openly gay male artist signed to a major record label; a year later, the duo's song \"Younger Me\" — which was written in response to T.J.'s coming out — became the first country song with an LGBTQIA+ theme to win a GRAMMY. And this Pride Month, longtime LGBTQIA+ supporter (and GLAAD's 2023 Excellence in Media Award recipient) Maren Morris declared on Instagram, \"happy to be the B in LGBTQ+.\"\n\nRead More: 9 Times Queer Artists Made History At The GRAMMYs: From Elton John's Collab With BSB To Kim & Sam's \"Unholy\" Union\n\n\"We as queer fans deserve to have songs that speaks specifically to us,\" says Rachel Cholst, a queer writer and educator. \"And if that means putting in same gender pronouns, then we deserve that too. And if that makes a straight person uncomfortable, I don't know what to tell you. I've grown up my entire life having to internally change the pronouns to the love songs that really moved me.\"\n\nCholst started writing about music when she realized she couldn't be the only queer country fan out there. Her work aims to make queer country music accessible, and she has run the Adobe and Teardrops blog for more than a decade. In 2022, Cholst launched Rainbow Rodeo, a zine about queer country music, which appears bi-annually in print and regularly online.\n\n\"Everyone just assumed that country music is this one thing, and it never occurred to them to go look for it. That tells you a lot about how country music wants to present itself as an industry,\" Cholst says. \"If we erase anyone who's not straight, anyone who's not white, then what you're saying is, you want those people to be erased from the conversation, from the culture.\"\n\nBeyond using she/her pronouns in love songs (which she didn't get to do on her first album, Felony Blues), Wyatt's powerful, steely queer country music complicates social consciousness. Incisive and elegant in her delivery, she's equally compelling chronicling her conviction and jail time on Felony Blues, confronting demons and figuring out who she is on her Shooter Jennings-produced second album, Neon Cross, and outlining her hopes and frustrations for the world on her third album, 2023's sultry, groovy, Feel Good.\n\nWyatt's knack for catchy and advocacy-laced country bangers is clearest in \"Rattlesnake Girl,\" one of her most popular songs. In it, she offers an anthemic celebration of joy unfettered: \"I see my sweet friends out on the weekend/ They all look happy and gay,\" and a barbed warning to anyone who might impinge on that happiness: \"Thank you kindly, don't walk behind me/ I've seen people slip that way/ And if you try me, boot heels beside me/ I might have to make your day.\"\n\nQueer country music means something a little different to each artist. For many, it's about much more than simply being a queer person performing country music. Adeem the Artist considers queer country its own genre, complete with specific rules — many of which have nothing to do with sexual or gender orientation.\n\n\"It is explicitly political in nature. It is often kind of raunchy,\" they assert. \"There's an element to queer country that is confrontational, that is willing to create discomfort for the sake of a relief that leans towards some greater social awareness.\"\n\nTo some degree, raising awareness and representation — which is essential for inclusion and acceptance — requires a bit of self-tokenization, Adeem says. \"The very, very basic act of referring to me as a person who is queer, who is trans, who is nonbinary, who is whatever, those labels only do good as much as they illuminate the differences between us and the fact that I am more difficult for some people to relate with.\"\n\nAdeem and Wyatt both operate within the alt-country scene, which has been marginally more inclusive than mainstream country over the years. Recently, though, rising country musician Lily Rose cracked through with her viral breakup single, 2020's \"Villain.\" On her latest EP, Runnin' Outta Time (which she released in May), she sings a high-octane pop/country mix about her values and relationships. It's a well-worn country music landscape that has been almost exclusively dominated by heterosexual white men.\n\n\"To be one of the first to literally [and] figuratively, carry the flag... it makes me really proud. And it has its heavy moments for sure,\" Rose says. \"Night after night, when I get to meet fans and see comments on social media that they feel seen for the first time in the genre, it's really special and it makes every single second of hard work to get here worth it.\"\n\nThe day after Runnin' Out of Time dropped, Rose made her Grand Ole Opry debut with two songs from the album, \"Back Pew\" and \"Two Flowers\"; Adeem and Wyatt also played the Opry for the first time in the last year as well. The Opry, one of country music's oldest and most lauded tastemakers, has welcomed a number of queer artists in the last few years, signaling a subtle shift toward a more inclusive country music institution. (In addition, all three artists recently scored high-profile touring spots: Rose with Shania Twain and Sam Hunt, Adeem with Tyler Childers and Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit; and Wyatt wrapped up her first headlining tour.)\n\nFor Pittleman, an essential part of making music is ensuring space for anyone who wants to make music to do so, regardless of how they look or identify. \"Most people who like country music, they just want to hear country music,\" Pittleman says. \"I want to have a good time, too. But you have to ask at a certain point, 'Who is invited to the good time?'\"\n\nAs she insists, there's a long way to go. In a digital world, radio play doesn't offer a complete picture, but it remains a dominant force in country music. For decades, women have been played sparingly on country radio and artists of color and queer musicians featured far less, a shortcoming which SongData's principal investigator, Jada Watson, spent years studying. Her research concludes that women country artists are played roughly 29 percent of the time, Black artists 5 percent, and other artists of color 7 percent. Queer artists, Watson estimates, make up less than 1 percent of radio play.\n\n\"The real problem is who's making those decisions; who has the power and as a result, who has the power and the resources to record their music, to distribute their music, to get it out on a broader scale,\" Pittleman suggests. \"We have to make sure that everyone who's called to make the music has the resources and the power to make it and bring it into the world.\"\n\nAnd in spite of multitude setbacks and naysayers, queer artists are creating country music. As Pittleman wrote in a 2020 essay in the Journal of Popular Music Studies titled \"You're My Country Music,\" one of the joys of singing queer country music is making country music, plain and simple. \"The point is to mark the deepest moments of human connection, our truest hopes and heartbreaks, and turn them into a sound that gives us joy and strength,\" she says.\n\n\"Because sometimes you love a culture that doesn't love you back,\" Pittleman continues on the Gay Ole Opry's about page. \"We do it because we love the music and want to build a community to support queer country musicians. We do it because everybody needs a honky-tonk angel to hold them tight. We do it because we believe in country music for all.\"\n\nWhy 2024 Is The Year Women In Country Music Will Finally Have Their Moment\n\nPRIDE & Black Music Month: Celebrating LGBTQIA+ & Black Voices\n\nNow that the Coachella dust has settled at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif., it's time for country music to take over.\n\nSince 2007, the Stagecoach Festival has been bringing some of the biggest names in country music to the desert. This year is no different, with the festival featuring headliners Luke Bryan, Kane Brown and Chris Stapleton, along with some of country's newer hitmakers, including Bailey Zimmerman, Parker McCollum, Gabby Barrett, Lainey Wilson and Tyler Childers.\n\nIn addition to the always exciting headliners and stars, Stagecoach continues to be a showcase for up-and-coming talent. Several budding country and folk artists are on this year's roster, from a genre-bending New Jersey native to a bluegrass songstress with a powerful voice.\n\nFor fans who can't make the trip to catch the action in person, Stagecoach will be live streaming all weekend on Amazon Prime. No matter how you're enjoying the festival, get to know 12 acts to catch at Stagecoach 2023.\n\nNate Smith\n\nThe weekend will be a big one for Nate Smith all around: Not only will the California-born singer make his Stagecoach debut, but he will be releasing his self-titled debut album on the same day, Friday April 28.\n\nIt's been a long road to success for Smith, who first moved to Nashville in his early 20s. After things didn't take off, he returned home to Paradise, Calif.; in 2018, he lost everything he owned in the massive wildfire that ripped through his hometown.\n\nBut through it all, he found hope through music, and returned to Nashville to try again. Now, he has a No. 1 song — the gritty breakup romp \"Whiskey On You\" peaked in January — and a rejuvenated soul that is clearly resonating.\n\nTiera Kennedy\n\nTiera Kennedy's smooth voice and southern charm first caught the attention of Nashville in 2019, when she was signed as the flagship artist on Songs & Daughters, a publishing company founded by songwriter Nicolle Galyon. In 2020, she released her first single \"Found It In You\" to critical acclaim.\n\nSince then, Kennedy has independently released a self titled EP, giving fans a more full sense of who she is as an artist and songwriter. The release also led to a record deal with Big Machine Records in 2021.\n\nKennedy's bright personality has resonated just as much as her music, as the singer hosts her own show on Apple Music Country. Titled The Tiera Show, the program sees Kennedy sharing her take on what's on the rise in country music with a very personal touch.\n\nJackson Dean\n\nAnother artist making his Stagecoach debut this year, Jackson Dean has been winning over country music fans with his outlaw style and unique, gritty voice. He's already scored a top 5 hit with his debut single, \"Don't Come Lookin,'\" which reached No. 3 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart.\n\nDean's success has not been limited to just the charts, either: \"Don't Come Lookin'\" was featured on the TV show 'Yellowstone,' and he's been included on a number of artists to watch lists including Spotify's Hot Country Artists to Watch in 2023, Amazon Music's 2023 Breakthrough Artists to Watch: Country Class, and CMT's Listen Up class of 2023.\n\nAfter selling out his headlining debut in Nashville in January, Dean will spend the majority of the year headlining sold-out shows and supporting the likes of Luke Bryan, Eric Church, Parker McCullum, Lainey Wilson, and Jon Pardi.\n\nMackenzie Carpenter\n\nAfter first seeing success as a co-writer on Lily Rose's breakthrough song, \"Villain,\" Mackenzie Carpenter has since made a name for herself as an artist in her own right. The Georgia-born singer's down-home personality shines through in her fun country-pop tunes including the catchy cautionary tale \"Don't Mess With Exes\" and the heartbreaking ballad \"Jesus, I'm Jealous\" — all of which ultimately prove that she isn't afraid to be herself.\n\nIn less than a year since signing with Big Machine imprint Valory Music Co., Carpenter has enjoyed many career milestones, including a Grand Ole Opry debut and an invitation to CMT's Next Women of Country class of 2023. And just weeks before taking the Stagecoach stage, Carpenter released her debut self-titled EP.\n\nBreland\n\nSince the release of his debut single \"My Truck\" in 2019, Breland has been making waves in the industry by stretching the boundaries of country music. The New Jersey native's sound is derived from a mix of hip-hop, R&B and gospel, while still remaining recognizably country — he even titled his debut album Cross Country.\n\nBreland's feel-good, diverse sound has already helped him land collaborations with country superstars, including Sam Hunt, Keith Urban and Dierks Bentley. His single with the latter, \"Beers On Me\" (also featuring HARDY), scored Breland his first No. 1 on the Country Airplay chart, but he's proving to make an impact in his own right with more than 1 billion streams to date.\n\nThis year marks Breland's second year in a row on the Stagecoach stage, as he performed at the Late Night at Palomino after-party in 2022.\n\nBella White\n\nBella White brings a fresh perspective to an old-time sound. The Canadian artist serves audiences traditional bluegrass sounds with a clear, powerful voice.\n\nWhite's voice, however, is not her only strength. She's also a skilled instrumentalist, as she was raised in a musical household and was drawn to the mandolin and banjo early on in her life.\n\nFollowing the success of her debut album Just Like Leaving, White signed to Rounder Records in 2021. Just ahead of her Stagecoach performance, White released her second album, Among Other Things, on which she explores heartbreak and a wider breadth of sounds, weaving drums and electric guitars into her traditional-sounding strings.\n\nKameron Marlowe\n\nAfter a short stint on 'The Voice' in 2018, Kameron Marlowe began paving his own way in Nashville. The singer has made a name for himself with his signature smoky voice, while making sure his music is a true reflection of who he is.\n\nMarlowe gained traction with his first independent release, 2019's \"Giving You Up,\" which helped him land a record deal with Sony Music Nashville in 2020. He's since released his debut album, 2022's We Were Cowboys, and has sold out shows across the country — including his hometown of Charlotte, N.C.\n\nMarlowe nods to his home state in his latest release, \"Take Me Home,\" in which he grapples with the changes that come along with success: \"I hate feeling like I'm someone / That I've never been before / Take me home to Carolina / I don't wanna be here anymore,\" he sings.\n\nMorgan Wade\n\nA trailblazing country singer with an edge, Morgan Wade has captivated audiences with the striking vulnerability of her music. Wade takes her experiences with heartbreak, mental health and addiction and crafts them into songs that stick with listeners.\n\nWade's voice borders on the edge of country and rock, which makes her moving lyrics all the more affecting. That is particularly true on her breakout track, \"Wilder Days,\" which takes listeners through the raw emotion of finding the right person at the wrong time.\n\nSince the 2021 release of Wade's album Reckless, she has been touring nonstop, both in the U.S. and overseas. Wade's Stagecoach performance is one of over 65 tour dates for 2023, giving fans across the country and around the world a chance to experience her powerful music live.\n\nTre Burt\n\nFolk artist Tre Burt uses his storytelling prowess to tell the stories of the moment, amplified by his rootsy sound. Burt engages audiences with tracks like \"Under the Devil's Knee,\" a protest song written during the upheaval of 2020, a year during which he found musical inspiration in the chaos surrounding him.\n\nSince hitting the scene, Burt has performed with artists including Nathanial Ratecliff and Margo Price, and has become a staple at folk festivals around the country. Burt expanded on his deeply affecting sound with his second album, You, Yeah, You, which arrived in 2021; with his powerful delivery on stage and on record, he's been labeled a \"storyteller and musical philosopher,\" and a \"troubadour\" blazing his own path.\n\nJaime Wyatt\n\nJaime Wyatt's success has been long and hard-earned. The singer/songwriter entered the music business when she was just a teen, and the now 37-year-old has kept her nose to the grindstone ever since. Her years have been colored with late nights in honky tonks, addiction, and recovery, and she details it all in her traditional country music.\n\nWyatt's 2020 release, Neon Cross, challenged the genre, as the singer examined her identity as a queer woman, and positioned herself as a true outlaw in the landscape of the industry. In 2021, she released a merch line with a portion of the proceeds benefiting G.L.I.T.S, an organization that addresses systematic discrimination of LGBTQIA+ individuals. In being true to herself, Wyatt has provided a beacon of hope for queer artists and fans alike.\n\nKaitlin Butts\n\nKaitlin Butts has made a habit out of being a good listener, crafting the stories she hears into fun, innovative country songs. Like many of her Stagecoach cohorts, Butts has a versatile sound, drawing in influences from rock and 90's emo music — but the baseline is always undeniably country.\n\nWhile Butts has been releasing music since 2015's Same Hell, Different Devil, this past year has been a whirlwind for the budding star. Her second album, What Else Can She Do, landed in the top 10 of Billboard's Americana Albums chart; the title track earned a spot on Rolling Stone's \"100 Best Songs of 2022\" list.\n\nWithin a span of six months, Butts played the Ryman Auditorium and made her Grand Ole Opry debut, and has opened for fellow Stagecoacher Morgan Wade as well as playing several other festivals.\n\nAmerican Aquarium\n\nAmerican Aquarium, led by BJ Barham, incorporates elements of country, folk and rock music into their thought-provoking music.The group's lyrics wrestle with some of life's biggest problems and tell delicate, personal stories.\n\nThe band's latest record, Chicamacomico, is a journey through the lead singer's personal losses. The album is a departure from the band's previously harder, rock-leaning sound, presenting more stripped-down tracks that lean more on Barnham's stirring vocals. Even so, Chicamacomico has been hailed as their best album yet.\n\nOver the span of a 20-year career, American Aquarium has cycled through many members; Barnham being a mainstay on lead vocals. The band has proven their staying power in the industry, and their presence at Stagecoach proves that the festival is a celebration of country music in all its forms.\n\nBehind Shania Twain’s Hits: How A Hospital Stay, A Balmy Porch And A Hair Nightmare Inspired Her Biggest Hits & Videos\n\nA capacity crowd filled the Martha's Vineyard Performing Arts Center for a screening of Luther: Never Too Much, a new documentary chronicling the life and career of soul and R&B icon Luther Vandross. The event, held last week at the 2024 Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival and presented by the Recording Academy’s Black Music Collective and oc Limonata, was a celebration of Vandross' legacy in music and culture as well as the Academy's impact in underrepresented communities across the music industry.\n\nAward-winning filmmaker Dawn Porter, who directed the film, kicked off the screening with a heartfelt memory: \"When I first came here in 1998, never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that a film that is so special to me, I would be able to share with you on this island that I love.\"\n\nShe also gave the audience, former Chair and CEO of BET Networks Debra Lee and Universal Music Group executive Jeff Harleston, permission to release. \"You are free to sing, dance, and we will be back for you after this,\" she said.\n\nNot skipping a beat, Luther takes things all the way back to the beginning. It details Vandross' early influences including the Supremes, the Temptations and the Sweet Inspirations, as well as Dionne Warwick and Aretha Franklin, the latter of whom both became collaborators. As Vandross' many hits — \"Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now,\" \"Bad Boy/Having A Party,\" \"Stop To Love,\" \"Til My Baby Comes Home,\" title track \"Never Too Much,\" and more — weaved in and out of the comprehensive doc, the audience moved and grooved.\n\nVandross' decades-long career unfolds in full scope across Luther, highlighting his own group, Shades of Jade; the musical ensemble Listen My Brother, a one-time Apollo Theater fixture that also appeared in early \"Sesame Street\" episodes; his work on David Bowie's legendary Young Americans album, which boosted Vandross' solo career; his many jingles; his days as a backup singer for Bette Midler and Roberta Flack; and much more. The film's use of amazing archival footage tracing these eras wowed the audience.\n\nIn addition to penning his own hits like \"Give Me the Reason\" and other classics, such as \"Everybody Rejoice/A Brand New Day\" from the Broadway musical \"The Wiz\" and Aretha Franklin's Jump To It, Vandross was a vocal perfectionist and a showman, which Porter reflects in the film through rehearsal footage and sketches of the costumes he designed for his tours. Luther producer and fan Jamie Foxx even offers his own testimony to the vital assist Vandross gave his early romantic life.\n\ndoes not shy away from Vandross' dark points in Luther. At the height of his fame, for example, he was involved in a car accident that killed a friend. Insightful interviews with lifelong friends and music peers dating back to high school, including folks like Carlos Alomar, Fonzi Thornton, Robin Clark, Valerie Simpson, Dionne Warwick, Mariah Carey, Nile Rodgers, his niece Seveda Williams, and longtime assistant Max Szadek uncover Luther Vandross, the person. Some of the most heartbreaking personal revelations revolve around his weight and the emotional toll that media scrutiny took on him as well as persistent rumors about his sexuality, which his closest friends continue to guard, even in death.\n\nPatti LaBelle, to the dismay of Vandross' friend and writing partner Richard Marx, who considers such acts a betrayal, did speak publicly on the topic via a clip. Vandross' inability to find love, as detailed in \"Any Love,\" a song he once described to Oprah as his most autobiographical track, is most heartbreaking.\n\nIn a Q&A panel following the film, Porter shared how she pulled off such a wonderful tribute to Vandross in Luther.\n\n\"What really works for this movie is having all that music,\" she said. \"I watched this movie like a fan. I want to hear those songs. I want to sing those songs. So having the ability to let them play out, having the archive, having the estate images and rehearsal footage\" was invaluable, she stressed. \"When you have all those elements, you feel like you can do justice to a story. And if anybody deserves justice to his story being done, it's this man.\"\n\nThe panel — which also featured guest Ryan Butler, Vice President of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion for the Recording Academy, and author, professor and radio host Dr. Nii-Quartelai Quartey as moderator — also highlighted the notable steps and initiatives the Academy has launched to advance a diverse, inclusive music community.\n\n\"[Around the] last GRAMMYs, we launched Academy Proud, which is what we call a membership resource group for LGBTQ artists, creators, [and] professionals, so that they also have a safe space,\" , who is openly gay, reflected. \"I think that a lot of times, the Academy felt unapproachable. It felt like it was the castle on top of the hill behind the gate. So I think what I really do, as the leader of our diversity efforts, is come out of the castle and go into the communities where people are.\"\n\nPorter regretted that Vandross, whose health challenges as a diabetic and stroke survivor contributed to his early death in 2005 at the young age of 54, never got to experience today's industry. \"Don't we all wish Luther lived now?\" she lamented to the audience.\n\nVandross' fight to cross over and expand his audience features prominently in the film. He achieved some of that goal with his very personal, chart-topping single \"Dance with My Father,\" which he penned with Marx; the song won the GRAMMY for Song Of The Year at the 2004 GRAMMY Awards while he was recovering from a stroke he suffered in 2003. (Earlier, the crowd gasped upon learning that Vandross won his first GRAMMY after nine previous nominations.)\n\n\"In 2020, a group of us at the Recording Academy got together [and] we created the Black Music Collective, which is really about honoring and celebrating the contributions of Black creatives,\" Butler said in response.\n\n\"As soon as I saw the film,\" he continued, \"I thought, 'What if the Black Music Collective existed when Luther was here? Would he have been nominated nine times before he won? Or would he have enough Black voters in the [Recording Academy voting] membership?' When I arrived at the GRAMMYs, Black representation in voting membership was around 9%, which was indexing lower than U.S. census data. We set an aggressive goal of 33% and we're [now] at 22%,\" he announced to applause.\n\nPorter closed out the panel by announcing that Luther: Never Too Much would hit select theaters in October before its official premiere in 2025 on CNN, OWN and Max.\n\nAttendees at the *Luther: Never Too Much* private reception | Photo: Corey Fletcher\n\nElsewhere throughout the festival, the Recording Academy's DEI team participated in multiple panels and events, including the DEI is Alive panel, which discussed the impact and importance of DEI work in the entertainment industry; a screening of and conversation about Billy Preston: That’s The Way God Planned It, a new documentary celebrating GRAMMY-winning R&B, rock, soul, funk, and gospel legend Billy Preston, which Butler moderated; and a welcome and toast celebration for Oscar nominee Colman Domingo.\n\ne Luther: Never Too Much screening, conversation and private reception, has supported the Black Music Collective and the Academy's DEI initiatives on an ongoing basis.\n\nLearn more about the Recording Academy's Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, recent DEI achievements, and year-round work to support artists, creators and music professionals of all backgrounds.\n\nOn July 29, a diverse, talented group of over 200 Recording Academy New York Chapter members filled Brooklyn Brewery in Williamsburg to mingle, network, and talk shop.\n\nThe special occasion was the New York Chapter Member Celebration — its first summer event — and the attendees were eager to make new friends and connections, while embracing old ones over free food and drinks.\n\nHeld inside Brooklyn Brewery's spacious wooden tasting room, where guests could try any of the local brewer's beers on draft and bites from Shake Shack — the official burger partner of the New York Chapter Member Celebration As members milled about the space, New York-bredDJ Morsy — who's also a music producer, audio engineer and proud member of the Class of 2024 — provided upbeat grooves to make Monday feel like a full-on party.\n\nAn hour or so into the lively event, Nick Cucci, the Senior Executive Director of the New York Chapter, and Lee Dannay, the new NY Chapter President, briefly paused the music and conversation to share their gratitude for their community — which grew by 600 members to 3501 this year — and the many sponsors that made the evening possible. \"We can’t do this without our partners and our sponsors,\" Dannay said.\n\nThe Connect Lounge, located among large, shiny vats of beer still in the brewing process, provided opportunities to network with many of the event's community partners. Daniel's Music Foundation, GRAMMY Go, MusiCares, Music Managers Forum US, Platinum Academy, The Mechanical Licensing Collective, Sound Royalties, RAMPD, Queer Capita, and She Is The Music all had tables set up to showcase their important work and how to get involved.\n\nInside the Connect Lounge, attendees could watch clips fromGRAMMY Go — the Recording Academy's creator-to-creator learning platform —featuring useful courses on music production, songwriting and audience building from a star-studded cast of GRAMMY-winning and nominated artists including Victoria Monét, Janelle Monáe and Hit-Boy.\n\nThe Lounge also boasted more delicious treats; fresh, gooey cookies from Levain Bakery — the official cookie partner of the New York Chapter Member Celebration — and organic flavored green tea from Saint James.\n\nTowards the end of the evening, the music was briefly paused once again to reveal the lucky winner of a raffle. NYC-based, Nigerian-born Afrobeats artist Teemanay took home a brand newD'Angelico Premier Brighton electric guitar, donated by the craft NYC guitar company.\n\nEven after 10 p.m. when the event ended and brewery closed, many guests mingled outside to continue conversations, exchange information and introduce themselves to anyone they might not have had the chance to yet. Recording Academy New York Chapter members are not only talented and driven creators and music industry professionals, they are clearly committed to supporting each other and building community.\n\n\"We haven’t done an all-member celebration, nor have we ever done a program in Brooklyn during my tenure. All the stars aligned for this night. [It was a] great turnout from our members and an iconic New York City venue — Brooklyn Brewery! Perfect all around,\" Cucci says of the event.\n\nThe Chapter extends an extra special thanks to all their beloved partners, especially the Annual New York Chapter partners: Concord Theatricals, Sound Royalties, and the Mechanical Licensing Collective; the Official Burger of the New York Chapter Member Celebration, Shake Shack; and the Official Cookie Partner of the New York Chapter Member Celebration, Levain Bakery.\n\nNew York is the Recording Academy's second-biggest chapter.
