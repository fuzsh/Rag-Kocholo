Her playing has been featured in films screened at Sundance and Aspen Film Fest. www.ollellamusic.com\n\nTickled strings and floating vocals, hammered riffs and belted requests—Gillian Grogan’s music is untamed and untethered to any genre. She’s singing stories where Americana meets folk and steeps into soul, where fingerpicking builds and swells and gets slapped back to silence. www.gilliangrogan.com\n\nGrowing up around Santa Cruz, Elena Lambertson spent a lot of time echoing her tunes off of redwood canopies and sitting at the shores of the Pacific, crafting her inner reflections into storytelling songs reminiscent of the vintage, ramblin’ cowgirl style of Gillian Welch blended with a sparse, reverb-drenched angst like that of Cat Power. www.elenalambertson.com\n\nRecommended if you like: Feist, Haley Heynderickx, Cat Power, Brandi Carlile, Gillian Welch\n\nFriday, October 14th | Doors at 7:30 Show 8:15-10:30pm – MUSIC\n\nNick Gamer & The Midnight Angels (formerly of Japanese Breakfast) + Clementine Darling\n\nTICKETS\n\nOregon’s Nick Gamer writes dark, cinematic Americana songs that sound equally at home in the western cosmos of Lucinda Williams and The Byrd’s Sweetheart of the Rodeo. A former guitarist for Japanese Breakfast and frontman of Le Rev, Gamer has traded indie pop hooks for the high lonesome wail of the pedal steel and currently touring his debut solo album, Suburban Cowboy, where honky tonks, midnight angels, truck stops and bourbon loom large. www.nickgamermusic.com\n\nClementine Darling is a singer-songwriter making waves in San Francisco’s music scene, playing Americana folk songs and indie ballads with undertones of Seattle 90’s grunge. www.instagram.com/clementinedarlingmusic/\n\nRecommended if you like: Band of Horses, Ruston Kelly, Greg Cartwright, Big Thief, Tyler Childers\n\nSaturday, October 15th | Matinee.

Abney is rarely not on the road, maintaining a grueling tour schedule as a solo artist and as a sideman whose credits include years accompanying and recording with Samantha Crain and John Moreland, recent dates with up-and-comers Lizzie No and Margo Cilker, a 2022 solo performance at the Ryman Auditorium, and opening—with a full rock band in tow—a home state show for Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit. https://www.johncalvinabney.com/\n\nRecommended if you like: Jim James, Blake Mills, John Moreland, Elliot Smith\n\nThursday, October 13th | Doors at 7:30 Show 8:15-10:30pm – COMMUNITY CATHARSIS and OPEN MIC\n\nYou’re Going To Die: Poetry, Prose & Everything Goes\n\nTICKETS\n\nYou’re Going To Die: Poetry, Prose & Everything Goes is an open mic, communal offering for us to explore the conversation of death & dying, to embrace our losses & mortality, to grieve, bereave & honor those we’ve lost & love while all the while making room for simply being ALIVE. www.yg2d.com\n\nFeatured performer: Lila Nelson has toured internationally, playing with notable artists including Ben Folds and the late Richie Havens.

With elements of John Prine’s whimsy, Leonard Cohen’s spiritual gravitas, Dylan’s wit, and Lucinda Williams’ aching sensuality, and like a crackling backyard fire outside of a city at dusk, stars on one side of the sky and light pollution on the other, Mya’s music is in the pocket of traditional country and Americana, yet firmly rooted in the modern world. https://www.myabyrne.com\n\nThere aren’t many artists around who can transport you into a story the way Katie Anne Mitchell does. Her music is folky and sometimes dark, but always deep in a richness that will keep you listening to every syllable and inflection. https://www.instagram.com/katieannemitch/?hl=en\n\nRecommended if you like: Decemberists, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Thao, Neil Young, Lucinda Williams, Chris Stapleton, Sam Baker, Grant Peeples, Terry Hendrix, and Beth Hart\n\nThe Lost Church San Francisco is located at 988 Columbus Avenue at Chestnut Street in North Beach\n\n(26-min from Oakland, 33-min from San Rafael, 52-min from Vallejo, 1 hour and 6-min from Santa Rosa)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO\n\nFriday, November 11: Toby Dixon a one-woman show, with special guest Roger Oddcock\n\nSunday, November 13.

I know the staff. I’m very grateful to be a part of the team.” Espiritu is working closely with Director of Operations Michele Kappel, who recommended her for the job after knowing her well from The Lost Church music scene and radio station.\n\nIt was Kappel who asked Espiritu to bring her twice-performed live event The Color Coded Symphony Project, a curated and live musical piece which connects audiences’ ethnic origins to rhythms across the world, partly in the dark, to Lost Church Free Radio. Kappel took note of how expertly Espiritu handled PR for that project, as well as for her own music as a solo artist and in Aireene & the Itch, that when the TLC stand alone PR position needed to be created, she asked the full-time musician to help out the organization. “Aireene brings a deep commitment to community and the performing arts to Team TLC, along with laser sharp attention to detail and her well known warmth and soulful point of view. Plus she’s just so much fun! She fits right in with this group of seriously silly and hardworking advocates of the stage.” says Kappel.\n\nBorn in the Philippines and raised in New Jersey, New York, and California, Espiritu has been playing The Lost Church for over a decade, first at its original Capp Street location, and now at its new North Beach theater. “You can just tell there’s a lot of love and care, in every single detail. I just love playing The Lost Church. Everyone who works there is just so wonderful and you just feel the love from everyone and from the space. I always treasure playing there.” She was one of the first acts to play the new theater and was “blown away to tears. I already expected it to be amazing and have the same feel and aesthetics as the original theater, but it was even more incredible. And it’s huge. It’s so much bigger than the Capp Street one.”\n\nNow that it’s Espiritu’s job to promote the new TLC location in the print promotions, radio PSAs, online calendars, and press releases, she is confident that, “we can make a stamp in North Beach and people will go there if we create that stamp. It’s exciting! Let’s get the word out on The Lost Church. I really believe in that space and the space in Santa Rosa. I’ve always believed in The Lost Church.”\n\nEspiritu also greatly appreciates that The Lost Church is a non-profit because it “allows The Lost Church to provide a space for all performers, which is important. I’m a musician so I’m grateful for that. We have to fight to keep live performance spaces alive, like the motto says.”"
