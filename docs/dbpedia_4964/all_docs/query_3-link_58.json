Senior outfielder Victoria Smith led off with a single before freshman third baseman Holly Walter was hit by a pitch. After a sacrifice bunt, sophomore outfielder Mya Zettlemoyer ripped a two-RBI double to left center to bring in Smith and Walter to tie the game. Senior shortstop Maddisen Bieber connected on a two-out RBI double to chase in Zettlemoyer as the Blue and Grey took the lead for good\n\nThe Hounds plated four runs in the bottom of the fourth frame to extend their advantage to 7-2. Zettlemoyer got things started with a single, and she moved into scoring position on a single by Wehr. After the first out of the inning, freshman first baseman Lindsey Gawrys hit a two-RBI single through the left side to score Zettlmoyer and Wehr. Sophomore designated player Emily Silberman followed with an RBI single as Gawrys scored from second. Freshman pitcher Madi Cunningham ripped a double, and Smith followed with an RBI single to score both Silberman and Cunningham\n\nMoravian added one more run in the bottom of the fifth inning as Wehr connected on a solo home run to left field, her fourth homer of the season\n\nDelaware Valley finished off the scoring with a solo home run in the top of the seventh\n\nCunningham improved to 9-0 in the circle with the complete game in the opener that included seven strikeouts\n\nHow It Happened – Game #2\n\nMoravian opened the scoring in the second contest with a pair of runs in the bottom of the first frame. Bieber hit a one-out double and raced home on an RBI single from Gawrys. Silberman connected on an RBI sacrifice fly later in the inning as Gawrys trotted home\n\nThe Hounds stretched the lead to 8-0 with a six-run second inning. Freshman second baseman Ren Herschman singled with one out while freshman outfielder Sage Snyder and Zettlemoyer drew walks to load the bases. Wehr followed with a grand slam to left field for career hit 200 in just her 501st career at-bat, becoming the fifth player in program history to the milestone. After a pitching change, Bieber drew a walk before Gawrys connected on a two-run homer to right center off the scoreboard\n\nDelaware Valley scored its lone run of the contest in the top of the third inning\n\nThe Blue and Grey answered back with a 10-run third inning to make it an 18-1 contest. Zettlemoyer walked and Wehr singled to set Bieber up for an RBI double. Gawrys followed with a three-run homer to left center, her fifth home run of the season. Silberman then ripped a solo home run deep beyond the left field fence for her sixth homer of the spring. Herschman would connect on an RBI single to chase Walter across the plate while senior outfielder Cameron Cassidy added a pinch-hit RBI single as Herschman raced home. Wehr followed with a three-run homer to left center, her sixth round-tripper of the year, to tie Jenn Dalickas for the program record with her 35th career home run in 22 fewer games than Dalickas. The three RBIs also gave Wehr seven for the game, tying the single contest school record\n\nSophomore pitcher Madison Hummel improved to 7-1 on the season with the complete game win that saw her strikeout five batters\n\nInside the Numbers\n\nMoravian had 33 hits in the doubleheader with Gawrys going 6-for-7 with two homers, a double, four runs and seven RBIs. Gawrys had six RBIs in the second game, one shy of tying Wehr and the single game record\n\nWehr was 5-for-8 with three home runs, eight RBIs and five runs scored while Silberman was 4-for-4 with a homer, three RBIs and two runs. Wehr had seven RBIs in the second game to tie the school record. Bieber went 4-for-5 with three doubles, three runs and two RBIs\n\nSmith had a 3-for-6 afternoon with an RBI and a run while Zettlemoyer, Herschman, Snyder and freshman outfielder Jessica Gonzalez-Forder each had two hits with Zettlemoyer adding two runs, two RBIs and double, Herschman and Snyder both scoring twice and Herchman contributing an RBI\n\nFreshman pinch hitter Jenna Lenko earned her first collegiate hit\n\nQuotable From Head Coach John Byrne\n\n\"Brooke joining our 200-hit club as just the fifth member is an outstanding accomplishment, and it is fitting that she did it with a home run, a grand slam no less. She has put together one of the top careers in the history of our program, and is still no done with the rest of the regular season and hopefully a run in the postseason this spring.\"\n\nUp Next for the Greyhounds\n\nThursday, April 7 vs. New Jersey City University (DH), 3:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday, April 9 at The Catholic University of America (DH), 1:00 p.m."
