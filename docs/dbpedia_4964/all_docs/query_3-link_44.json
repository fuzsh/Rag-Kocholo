        "text": "Township in Essex County, New Jersey, US\n\nTownship in New Jersey, United States\n\nMaplewood is a township in Essex County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is an inner-ring suburban bedroom community of New York City in the New York metropolitan area.[19] As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 25,684,[9][10] an increase of 1,817 (+7.6%) from the 2010 census count of 23,867,[20][21] which in turn reflected a decline of one person from the 23,868 counted in the 2000 census.[22]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen surveying the area now known as Maplewood, Robert Treat found several trails used by Lenape tribes of Algonquian Native Americans, though there was only sparse pre-European settlement. These paths form the basis for what are the township's modern-day thoroughfares.[23]\n\nThe first European settlers arrived around 1675, primarily English, Dutch and French Puritans who had earlier settled Hempstead, Long Island (1643), New Haven, Connecticut (1638), and Stamford, Connecticut (1640), via Newark (1666) and Elizabeth (1664). They had acquired most of today's Essex County from the Native Americans through direct purchase upon first arrival and through royal assent. These early settlers then followed three trails that roughly correspond to South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue and Ridgewood Road into present-day Maplewood. These three routes resulted in the development of three separate communities that coalesced to become Maplewood and South Orange.[23] Those who came from Newark on the trail that now corresponds to South Orange Avenue settled the area that became South Orange village.[23]\n\nSix families (with last names of Smith, Brown, Pierson, Freeman, Ball and Gildersleeve) came up today's Ridgewood Road and established scattered farms around a center that became Jefferson Village, named after Thomas Jefferson. This settlement, which roughly corresponds to downtown Maplewood today, developed several mills and orchards. John Durand, the son of Hudson River School painter Asher Brown Durand (who was born in Maplewood in 1796), describes the place as a picturesque but slightly backward community with close ties to Springfield. The apple harvest was apparently quite impressive and included the \"Harrison\" and \"Canfield\" varieties. By 1815, there were approximately 30 families in the community. Although the residents of the area were predominantly Presbyterian, the first house of worship was a Baptist chapel in 1812. This was in use until 1846 and fell into disrepair until 1858, when it was taken into use as a Methodist Episcopal church.[23]\n\nThose who came up today's Springfield Avenue settled on a hill crest near today's intersection between Tuscan and Springfield Avenue and established a hamlet known as North Farms. Over time, this community became known as the Hilton section. It became a stagecoach stop between Newark, Jersey City (then Paulus Hook), and Morristown and thereby a center for trade and light manufacturing. The village changed its name from North Farms to Middleville in 1830, and then to Hilton in 1880 when it was granted a post office. In 1855, Seth Boyden settled in what was then Middleville to retire but innovated a number of agricultural products, especially berries. Boyden also built and put into operation the first steam engines to service the railroad through Maplewood.[24] The area became known for its orchards and related industries, including cider mills and rum distilleries, as well as honey and livestock.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1802, Jefferson Village and North Farms were named as districts within the Township of Newark.[25]\n\nThe three communities developed and functioned independently, each establishing their own school associations: South Orange established the Columbian School in 1814, which would form the basis of Columbia High School; North Farms established the North Farms Association in 1817; and Jefferson Village the Jefferson Association in 1818. In 1867, when the State of New Jersey established public education through the School Law, the newly appointed County Superintendent merged the three associations into one school district, which was formalized in 1894 as the South Orange-Maplewood School District. James Ricalton, a teacher born in New York of Scottish parents who became the school district's first permanent teacher, helped set the high standard of education that persists in the school district to this day.[26]\n\nMaplewood was originally formed as South Orange Township, which was created on April 1, 1861, from portions of Clinton Township and what was then the Town of Orange. Portions of the township were taken to form South Orange village (established May 4, 1869, within the township and became fully independent on March 4, 1904) and Vailsburg borough (formed March 28, 1894, and annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905) The name of the township was changed to Maplewood on November 7, 1922.[27]\n\nWhen the Morris and Essex Railroad from Newark was extended to the area in 1838, a land speculator by the name of John Shedden built a railroad station in Jefferson Village and named it Maplewood. This name came to comprise areas known as Hilton, Jefferson Village, and areas previously part of Springfield.[28] In 1868, farms were subdivided into parcels for residential housing and the area became a commuter suburb.[29]\n\nEdward Balch (1858–1934) was a homebuilder who envisioned Maplewood as a suburban community and starting around 1900 developed a total of 176 homes in the township, earning him recognition by The New York Times as the \"Father of Maplewood.\"[30][31]\n\nThe 1920s saw significant growth in new residents and structures.[citation needed]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 3.88 square miles (10.04 km2), including 3.87 square miles (10.03 km2) of land and <0.01 square miles (0.01 km2) of water (0.08%).[1][2] A pond is in Memorial Park, the Rahway River runs through the township and there is a municipal pool club with four man-made pools of water; the remainder of the area is land.\n\nThe township shares a border with West Orange and South Orange to the north, Newark and Irvington to the east, Union (in Union County) to the south, and Millburn to the west.[32][33][34]\n\nUnincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Hilton and Valley View.[35]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nMaplewood has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa).\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18702,963—18801,733*−41.5%18901,078*−37.8%19001,63051.2%19102,97982.8%19205,28377.3%193021,321303.6%194023,1398.5%195025,2018.9%196023,977−4.9%197024,9324.0%198022,950−7.9%199021,652−5.7%200023,86810.2%201023,8670.0%202025,6847.6%2023 (est.)25,321[9][11]−1.4%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nMaplewood township, Essex County, New Jersey – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

About 1.5% of families and 2.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.5% of those under age 18 and 3.1% of those age 65 or over.[51]\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2000 United States census[16] there were 23,868 people, 8,452 households, and 6,381 families residing in the township. The population density was 6,207.1 inhabitants per square mile (2,396.6/km2). There were 8,615 housing units at an average density of 2,240.4 per square mile (865.0/km2).

The Center, a former Christian Science Church, was donated to the town by Jean Burgdorff, a local real estate entrepreneur.[53] The building was transferred to the town on October 15, 1988.[54] In 2008, the township committed to a $130,000 plan to improve the building.[55]\n\nMaplewoodstock\n\n[edit]\n\nEvery year, on the weekend following the weekend closest to July 4, there is a concert in town called Maplewoodstock. The free concert consists of local and national bands performing alongside various stalls showcasing local businesses.[56]\n\nArchitecture and landscape\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of the more recognizable buildings and spaces were the work of famous architects and landscape designers. Most of the schools and the Municipal Building were the work of Guilbert & Betelle. The center of town is dominated by Memorial Park, a design of the Olmsted Brothers.[57] The Olmsted firm was also responsible for the landscaping at Ward Homestead, designed by John Russell Pope, and now known as Winchester Gardens, located on Elmwood Avenue. On the opposite side of town is another Olmsted work, South Mountain Reservation. The Maplewood Theater, designed by William E. Lehman, was where Cheryl Crawford first revived Porgy and Bess.[58]\n\nPopular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nUltimate Frisbee (now called simply \"Ultimate\") was invented in Maplewood in 1968 by students at Columbia High School. A plaque commemorating the birthplace of Ultimate Frisbee is located in the student parking lot.[59]\n\nMaplewood is the birthplace of the wooden golf tee, invented by William Lowell at the Maplewood Golf Club in 1921.[60]\n\nMaplewood has been the site for several films, including I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Garden State, Gracie, One True Thing, Stepmom, and A Good Person.\n\nZach Braff, a Columbia High School alumnus, filmed a scene in his 2004 film, Garden State, where he and Natalie Portman drive by the front of Columbia High School.\n\nIn the 2007 film Gracie, the plot is set in and partially filmed in Maplewood and Columbia High School. Producer Andrew Shue and actress Elisabeth Shue both attended Columbia, and the plot is loosely based on their lives during high school.[61]\n\nBullet For My Valentine filmed their music video for \"Waking the Demon\" in Maplewood.[citation needed]\n\nThe main character of the Robert Sheckley novel Dimension of Miracles, Thomas Carmody, is from Maplewood. He revisits the town, albeit one belonging in an alternate universe, late in the book.[citation needed]\n\nNovelist Philip Roth, who grew up in neighboring Newark refers to Maplewood in several of his novels, including Goodbye, Columbus.[62]\n\nStarFish, a rock band for children.[63]\n\nParks and recreation\n\n[edit]\n\nMemorial Park is a 25-acre (10 ha) park adjacent to the railway station, designed in the 1920s by landscape architects Brinley and Holbrook and the Olmsted Brothers that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[64] Other town parks include Maplecrest Park, DeHart Park and Milo S. Borden Park.\n\nThe town is bordered to the northwest by South Mountain Reservation, a 2,100-acre (850 ha) nature reserve on the Rahway River that is part of the Essex County Park System.[65]\n\nThe East Branch of the Rahway River travels through the township.[66]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal government\n\n[edit]\n\nMaplewood is governed under the Township form of government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form.[67] The governing body is a Township Committee, which is comprised of five members who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle.[7][68] At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor for a one-year term, and another to serve as Deputy Mayor. The Mayor has the responsibility of Chair for the Township Committee meetings with voice and vote. The Mayor is considered the head of the municipal government.[69]\n\nThe Township Committee is the legislative body of the municipality and is responsible for enacting the township's laws. The Township Committee is also an executive body. Under this form of government, the elected Township Committee sets policy and overall direction for the Township. The Township staff, under the direction of the Township Administrator, carries out Committee policy and provides day to day services. The Township Administrator serves as the chief administrative officer and is accountable to the Township Committee.[69]\n\nAs of 2023 , members of the Maplewood Township Committee are Mayor Dean Dafis (D, term on committee and as mayor ends December 31, 2023), Deputy Mayor Deborah Engel (D, term on committee ends 2025; term as deputy mayor ends 2023), Nancy J. Adams (D, 2024), Jamaine L. Cripe (D, 2024) and Victor De Luca (D, 2023).[3][70][71][72][73][74]\n\nFire protection in the township is provided by the South Essex Fire Department, which was formed in July 2022 as the successor to the former Maplewood Fire Department and South Orange Fire Department.[75]\n\nFederal, state, and county representation\n\n[edit]\n\nMaplewood is located in the 11th Congressional District[76] and is part of New Jersey's 27th state legislative district.[77][78][79]\n\nFor the 118th United States Congress, New Jersey's 11th congressional district is represented by Mikie Sherrill (D, Montclair).[80] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027)[81] and Bob Menendez (Englewood Cliffs, term ends 2025).[82][83]\n\nFor the 2024-2025 session, the 27th legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by John F.
