        "text": "J. Griffith Rollefson, University College Cork\n\nThis year’s early contender for banger of the summer started in an unlikely place, the idyllic rural community of Lisdoonvarna on the edge of the Burren, West Ireland. The viral hit, The Spark was a collaboration between a crew of pre-teens in Lisdoonvarna and Kabin Studio in Cork City — aka “the real capital of Ireland” — two hours south.\n\nWhile this collaboration has been widely reported as the track goes viral, what many people don’t know is that it started in an asylum seekers’ home.\n\nKabin Studio went to Lisdoonvarna with their Rhyme Island initiative, which seeks to make rap an accessible tool for expression, personal development and wellbeing. The Spark was made for the annual Cruinniú na nÓg (Youth Gathering) with local kids, many of whom live in the village’s Direct Provision centre.\n\nDirect Provision is shorthand for the system that provides accommodation, food, money and medical services for people waiting for international protection applications and asylum claims to be assessed.\n\nI spoke to Kabin Studio Director, Garry McCarthy, who explained: “The asylum process can be really isolating, so the Rhyme Island initiative gives young people a way to connect and create.\n\n“The Kabin has worked with young international protection seekers over the last decade now, to the point where we have had youth from Direct Provision develop into mature artists themselves and work as youth mentors at the Kabin.”\n\nAs a member of the Kabin’s Advisory Board and global hip hop researcher, I’ve seen how McCarthy (aka GMC Beats) has expertly connected and promoted hip hop arts expression around the world.\n\nHe has written and produced tracks for the United Nations’ World Food Day Youth Music project with young rappers from Armenia, Cameroon, Chile, China, Ireland and Lebanon. Even more notably, he helped launch the career of viral sensation MC Abdul – the young man who has documented the humanitarian crisis in Palestine through his raps since 2020.\n\nThis is all to say that The Spark didn’t come out of nowhere.\n\nAs I’ve written over the course of my last decade in Ireland, Irish hip hop is hitting its stride as it connects Ireland’s millennia-old poetic and musical storytelling heritage to a newly confident hip hop generation from diverse backgrounds. Just ask Denise Chaila and Raphael Olympio, two rappers that are putting a new global twist on the famed Irish “gift of the gab”.\n\nOlympio served as MC for a collaboration between The Kabin and the Cork Migrant Centre (CMC) in 2021, producing another youth-led arts production titled, UBUNTU: Local is Global. Hip hop music, art and dance brought Northside youth together with migrant youth from Direct Provision Centres across County Cork to create a beautiful afternoon of energy and expression that has spawned countless artistic connections.\n\nIndeed, Cork’s youth hip hop scene boasts a range of successes, from the women’s empowerment of Misneach (Irish for “courage”) and the proudly local swag of MC Tiny and Jamie the King to the Anti-Racist Youth Led Summit, now in its second year, and the recent launch of Sauti Studios — a new Cork Migrant Centre initiative.\n\nBut despite these amazing celebrations of youth creativity and diversity, some people still badly miss the point.\n\nIn the recent EU elections, the Irish Taoiseach (prime minister), Simon Harris, used the track to promote his centre-right party, Fine Gael, in the EU elections without credit. The video was quickly taken down and apologies issued, but the incident set off a feeding frenzy for far-right internet trolls and their bots, who used Harris’s bad look as a ruse to attack the government’s immigration policy.\n\nResponding to Fine Gael’s offending Tweet McCarthy suggested to me that lost in the middle of this political hullabaloo were the kids.\n\n“On one side was the Taoiseach and his political party using the track for their own purposes without contacting us, and on the other were these bigots trying to spin the Irish success story of “The Spark” for their own intolerant purposes.“\n\nIronically, the far-right trolls completely missed the fact that many of the young people in the video were those very same immigrants they were demonising. But as the kids say themselves:\n\n“Think you can stop what we do? I doubt it!”\n\nThis multicultural crew’s got the energy. And they’re telling the world all about it.\n\nJ. Griffith Rollefson, Professor of Music, University College Cork\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.\n\nThe veteran protest musician takes a break from concept albums with his latest release – although all the songs are united in protest.\n\nSince releasing his debut album, Slow Car Crash – a jungle album about financial markets- in 2017, Australian-based musician Mat Ward has been anything but lazy. He has released seven topical protest albums in that time, covering themes such as surveillance, the media, and the climate crisis. He also produced the G.O.D. EP by his friend and collaborator, Aboriginal rapper Provocalz. On July 26, Ward is set to release his new album, Take The Rad Pill.\n\nWhen I asked Ward about what set the new album apart from his previous releases, he told me that one of the main differences is that this is his first album that doesn’t revolve around a specific theme. However, although Take The Rad Pill is not a concept album, all the songs on it are bound together by one thing – protest.\n\nProtest music is something that is dear and close to Ward, not only through his music, but as a journalist. For the last decade or so, he’s been publishing a monthly column for an Australian media outlet, Green Left, in which he shares contemporary protest music while covering political news from around the world. He has also published a book about Aboriginal rappers that was called a “must-read” by Britain’s I Am Hip-Hop magazine.\n\nAnother big difference with the new album is how Ward is exploring new genres. He told me he was listening to a lot of Rancid while making the album “which resulted in a lot of catchy punk songs.”\n\n“I also had Happy Mondays on repeat, so that resulted in several songs that are like house music with indie vocals. One of these is about a notorious political staffer and tobacco lobbyist called Bruce Lehrmann. He has been making headlines in Australia for years for all the wrong reasons. It’s called ‘Bruce Is Snorting A Line’ and has been getting played on the radio, with the result that people have been ‘shazamming’ it – identifying the song with their phones.”\n\nI asked Ward about his extra curricular activity, i.e. his activism outside of his music or his passion for hiking, and he told me that he can regularly be found on the streets, using his voice in protest:\n\n“You can see me doing that in the video for one of the lead singles off the album, ‘Your Vote’s A Joke’, which has also been getting radio play. The idea behind this song is: If you live in a democracy, you’re lucky, right? But then why do so many people in democracies hate politics and politicians? I’d say a big reason is that they’re allowed to break their promises as soon as they’re elected.\n\n“[The song is] mainly inspired by an interview I did with an author about accountable democracy years ago: He said: ‘The commonly held notion of democracy is not the accountable version originally defined by the ancient Greeks – democratia comes from demos “the people” and kratia “power or rule”. Instead, it is more like the version defined by Harvard political scientist and sometime government adviser Samuel Huntington. His widely cited definition of democracy is profoundly unambitious. He defines it as a system whose most powerful decision-makers are chosen through fair, honest and periodic elections… Huntington’s democracy is nothing like what we could enjoy with truly accountable governance, something we deny ourselves by accepting his democracy-lite version.”\n\nIn terms of hiking, as with his music, there is no lack of productivity there for Ward. He is about to finish a 250 km long hike from Sydney to Newcastle which he describes as having been “incredible”. Prior to that, Ward walked 110 km from Barrenjoey lighthouse to Bondi beach during which time he came up with the lead song of the new album, “I Wanna Be Like Violet CoCo”. Ward explained to me how he uses an app that reduces webpages to text only so he can read heavy loads of news offline while out and about and without all the distractions the internet has to offer. For that reason, he’d read news about Violet CoCo, a rather famous activist in Australia, but he didn’t know what she looked like.\n\n“Violet CoCo was so inspiring to me because, like many protesters, I had been going to rallies for years, trudging the same tired streets, with seemingly little to show for it. This person was approaching protest in a whole new, innovative, creative way, that grabbed attention in ways less imaginative activists like me could only hope for. I wanted the song to capture the same emotion as one that had intrigued me in my childhood, The Jam’s cover of The Kinks’ ‘David Watts’. That song and its main lyric, ‘wish I could be like David Watts, conduct my life like David Watts’, left a big impression on me because it was such an unusual admission. Amid so many songs of braggadocio that boast of the writer’s greatness, here was a frank insight into a state most people feel but never share – the desire to be more like someone else.\n\n“When I got home from that day’s walk and began Googling Violet CoCo to flesh out my verses, I gazed in wonder at the screen. I was shocked to find that she was nothing like the person I had imagined. She was young, photogenic, charismatic. The soft edges of her quiet, sweet personality contrasted with her jagged, wonky, lopsided rock star haircut. I hadn’t even realised she was the protester who had set fire to a pram outside parliament in Canberra. That iconic image had seared itself into my mind for eternity the moment I saw it.\n\n“I was inspired and fascinated by one particular video of her outside court. Prodded by her interviewer, she admitted that, far from being hard as nails, she was ‘actually a very fearful person’.\n\n“This is our problem. We’re all too stupid to be scared. Violet CoCo is one of the few people with the fear we should all have. That’s why I wrote this song.”\n\nWe’re thrilled to be able to offer a platform for the premiere of Ward’s new album, Take The Rad Pill, which can be streamed exclusively below.\n\nTAKE THE RAD PILL\n\nOut July 26, 2024 Genre: EDM / Punk\n\nTRACKLISTING\n\n1.

I broadcast 2 hours of radical protest music of all genres and eras every Wednesday at 9 PM. Every quarter, I put together a radio show and playlist of my favorite new protest songs released that season, which I call “molotov hot tracks.” This Spring, saw the release of many great protest songs, most notably songs about the recent British parliamentary election and the upcoming US presidential election, songs against Israel’s ongoing war/genocide in Gaza, and songs of LGBTIA Pride. I aired most of these songs on my show this Wednesday (July 10th 2024), which you can listen to the archive of here. I’ve organized these 40 protest songs by genre below (and alphabetically within genre). You can also listen to all 40 songs on this Spotify Playlist.
