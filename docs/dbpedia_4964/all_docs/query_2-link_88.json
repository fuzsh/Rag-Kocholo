Here Byrne stands too. Americana has many champions, but there are scarce few like Byrne; a queer trans woman creating ripples that will find themselves born again and again as waves.\n\nOn Rhinestone Tomboy, Byrne’s forthcoming record and first release under the Kill Rock Stars Nashville imprint label, we are treated to a portrait painted with shades of Byrne’s youth, one spent listening to stacks of dusty 45s and 8-tracks blasting from blown speakers out the window of a Chevy. Songs that opened the trailhead to a lifelong journey that informed Byrne’s musical landscape."
