        "text": "My Top 6 Posts from 2017\n\nSpike Cook, Millville, NJ\n\nBlogging provides an excellent resource for reflection. As I thought about this year, I was able to look through my posts (on this blog and on other sites) and see how much I have grown. Over the course of the year, I learned a lot about balance and the power of gratitude. As I look into 2018, I am poised to continue to help other educators through my writing, podcasts and presentations.\n\nHere are my Top 6 posts/moments that I am grateful to have experienced. Please click on the links to help me travel through 2017!\n\nLakeside STEM Day (Written by Joseph Smith)\n\nThis was such a great experience for our students at Lakeside Middle School to see the many offerings at Millville High School.\n\nInnovate My School is an amazing resource for educators. The site is based in the UK but has a global reach because of the resources provided!\n\nWe took a much needed break to work on other projects and to truly understand the work/life balance. This podcast was very fun and we decided to continue podcasting in 2018.\n\nEdWeb.net is one of the best resources for educators through online learning. They provide relevant topics presented by practitioners who seek to make others better.\n\nAs I scanned the blog for the most clicked on post for 2017, this post on gratitude was at the top. I am very grateful for the support and it encouraged me to work on a follow up to be published very soon!\n\nI am big fan of Solution Tree and they continue to send me excellent resources for review. From Leading to Succeeding is a book that I was able to put right into action at my school!\n\nThank you so much for your support of Insights Into Learning. I am looking forward to more posts in 2018.\n\nWe All Float On: My First Float\n\nSpike Cook, Millville, NJ\n\nOne of things on my bucket list for the winter break was to do a “float.”\n\nFor those of you who have no idea what a float is or never heard of a sensory deprivation tank, here is the best description I can find:\n\nFloating is an experience of ultimate peace and relaxation in which you spend one hour in a private, specialized tank filled with ten inches of highly-saturated Epsom salt water causing one to float completely effortlessly atop the water at near zero-gravity.” Float Haven Spa, Pitman, NJ\n\nThere are many benefits from floating and it has been around since the 1950s. Recently, Float Tanks have become popular from celebrities such as Joe Rogan and Stephen Curry who use them on a regular basis.\n\nI wanted to give it a shot for a few reasons. First, I have never tried it and I believe in the statement, “When was the last time you tried something for the first time?” Secondly, I wanted to experience sensory deprivation in order to gauge my mindfulness practice. Lastly, I have had many people I respect in the yoga/mindfulness community highly recommend it.\n\nMy Takeaways\n\nAn hour isn’t enough – It does take some time to chill out once in the tank. For me this process took a while even though I was practicing my breathing.\n\nYou are going to bump the walls – I laid as still as I could be inevitably I gently bumped against the walls of the tank.\n\nEyes open and eyes shut – Throughout the experience I tried a few different techniques. I would keep my eyes shut for some time and open as well. Since there is literally no light in the space, it probably doesn’t matter.\n\nIt is salty – I could feel the salt crystals on my face and chest as I floated. This salt is what keeps you buoyant and provides restorative healing. After the float you can wash this salt off but I was instructed to let it stay. I sort of feel like I just got back from the beach.\n\nOne session isn’t enough – I plan to go back at least two more times. Now I have a better grasp on the experience, I feel there are things I can do in preparation to ensure that I get the most out of the float.\n\nVisuals – It is dark, very dark!\n\nOverall, I had a very positive experience during my first float. I wasn’t able to solve all the world’s problems, or invent a new form of technology, but I was able to get an hour of peace, disconnected from the world with literally nothing holding me back.\n\nWant to learn more about Float Tanks? Check out these Frequently Asked Questions courtesy of Float Haven in Pitman, NJ.\n\nBook Review – Transforming School Culture\n\nTransforming School Culture: How to Overcome Staff Division, Anthony Muhammad\n\nBook Review – Spike C. Cook, Millville, NJ\n\nAre you looking for a leadership book on school culture that integrates data, practical advice, and strategies tailored to your school’s unique needs? Honestly, anyone who is an administrator in a school is looking for such a book! In Transforming School Culture (2nd Edition) Anthony Muhammad provides a road map for aspiring and current school leaders who are interested in addressing the daunting task of improving school culture. For this new edition, Dr. Muhammad has updated the research, added a frequently asked questions section, and added further guidance to equip leaders to take their school’s culture to the next level.\n\nThroughout the first section of the book, Dr. Muhammad provides an overview of the current reform movement as well as a detailed analysis on the four types of educators he found in schools while doing his research. The four types of educators and their goals:\n\nThe Believers are focused on the core values of healthy school culture, feel that all students can learn and that they have a direct impact on student success.\n\nThe Tweeners are new to the culture and still experiencing the honeymoon phase.\n\nThe Survivors are a small group of educators who are burned out, overwhelmed and struggle to survive.\n\nThe Fundamentalists are vehemently opposed to change and through political power become a major obstacle in reform. They are usually against the Believers.\n\nAs you read the brief overview of the four types of educators, did these descriptions make you think about your faculty? If you had to group your faculty into the four groups, how long do you think it would take? According to Dr. Muhammad, identifying these four groups is essential in understanding the real culture of the school. The next step, and perhaps more difficult, is to take action so that you can transform your school culture. Through this work, you will learn how (and why) to transform the culture by developing the following:\n\nSystemic focus on learning\n\nCelebrating the success of all stakeholders\n\nCreating system of support for Tweeners\n\nRemoving the walls of isolation\n\nProviding intensive professional development\n\nImplementing skillful leadership and focus\n\nThese six steps may appear more difficult to implement because of the overwhelming tasks required to operate a school with the demands of the 21st century. Have no fear because Dr. Muhammad provides practical, easy to implement exercises to support you on your journey. All you will need to do is put the framework provided into practice!\n\nIn the final chapter, Dr. Muhammad includes the questions he has encountered from the emails, messages as well as the in-person discussions since the release of the first edition in 2009. These questions will resonate with you as you may have already penciled them into margins as you read the book. For instance, one of the questions could spark a much needed conversation on the four types of educators such as what if a Fundamentalist believes that he or she is a Believer? I can honestly say I thought the same thing!\n\nIn conclusion, Transforming School Culture: How to Overcome Staff Division 2nd Edition will be worth the read. Dr. Muhammad understands school culture not only as a researcher and author, but also as a former teacher, vice principal, and principal. He led a staff transformational process in a high poverty, high minority school with a toxic, low expectation school into a nationally recognized school and earned a Principal of the Year in Michigan for his efforts.\n\nSpike C.

There are many educators who thought about this time for the past week, month or maybe even since September, but no matter how long you have prepared yourself it is finally here. There seems to be a lot of preparation and planning about what to do over the break.\n\nI saw this quote on the Elephant Journal website and I thought I would share. I think it is powerful…\n\nStop waiting for Friday, for summer, for someone to fall in love with you, for life. Happiness is achieved when you stop waiting for it and make the most of the moment you are in now. Elephant Journal\n\nI am grateful that I saw that quote during the most stressful time for schools (which is clearly the week before Winter Break). The quote made me stop and think about the present moment. Most of us are always wishing for that time or person who will make it all better as opposed to seeing the beauty in the now.\n\nThis Winter Break I plan to do the following (not necessarily in any order) and these plans are not definite.\n\nRead Brene Brown’s Braving the Wilderness. I am intrigued by her work on vulnerability.\n\nFloat. I’ve heard about Float Tanks/Sensory Deprivation tanks for some time. Basically, you get into a tank for a few hours and become suspended in your thoughts, intentions without any distractions.\n\nHike. I love to get out into the woods and walk. Southern New Jersey is somewhat mild in the winters and there are plenty of trails near where I live.\n\nCouch time. Although I sometimes struggle with couch time, I feel it is essential practice to a balanced life. Whether I am watching a documentary, sporting event, movie or binge watching a television series, I find solitude on the couch!\n\nWrite. I am working on a few things and I could see myself spending time in a coffee shop typing away at something or nothing!\n\nFriends. I love hanging out with friends. There is always an adventure on the horizon.\n\nPodcast. We recorded a podcast this morning on the PrincipalPLN. Our goal is to get one more in before the new year.\n\nSo now is the time for the break. How are you going to spend your break?\n\nWhat is Reflective Practice?\n\nI had the pleasure of discussing my understanding of Reflective Practice with David Beegle, School Development Specialist for the MSE Instructional Leadership at Jacksonville State University on December 11, 2017.\n\nDavid and I worked together this summer as I spoke at the 2017 Back to School Core Workshop at Jacksonville State University. This discussion was a follow up from that talk.\n\nFor more archived posts on Reflective Practice, please click here.\n\nDo you have Financial Peace?\n\nRecently I had the pleasure of going through Dave Ramsey’s Financial Peace University through a local church in my area. I was very reluctant at first. In fact, I think the first time I was introduced to FPU was about 5 years ago. For some reason, though, this time it clicked. Who doesn’t want Financial Peace?\n\nPreconceived issues with money\n\nAt the beginning of the class we were asked to write and discuss our philosophy on money. This was an excellent exercise because I had a lot of issues with money and I wasn’t afraid to share. In my journal I wrote the following:\n\nMoney is the root of all evil\n\nPeople with a lot of money are not philanthropic\n\nSome debt is good especially for housing and education\n\nBalancing a budget is as easy as looking at your ATM statement\n\nIf you need more money then you need to work more\n\nIf you can’t afford something then just put it on a credit card and pay off later\n\nTruly religious or spiritual people do not care about money\n\nTrips to Starbucks are a necessity!\n\nIn Dave’s first session, Super Saving, he literally gets to the core of what money is and isn’t. He also uses Biblical references to support his claims. I was dumbfound because almost everything I wrote about (in regards to my preconceived notions about money) Dave addressed. I felt like he was talking directly to me! I can honestly admit that all my preconceived issues regarding money were wrong!\n\nThroughout the remaining 9 weeks we reviewed Dave’s videos, worked in our notebooks and discussed the concepts plaguing most people. We learned about the baby steps to Financial Peace as well as how to relate with money in our relationships, how actually plan and execute a budget, how to purchase big ticket items, how and why we need to save, and ultimately how to be more philanthropic.\n\nYou can take this course online or through a local church or organization. The curriculum was impressive. The videos are informative and easy to follow. The workbook severs as a guide to take notes and to further the understanding of the concepts. On Dave’s website there are countless additional resources and tutorials.\n\nBy the end of the class I was definitely sad. I really looked forward to Tuesday nights. I met some really cool people in the class who were in the same boat as I was in. Our facilitator was very open and honest with us, and did a great job of guiding us through the process.\n\nIf you live like no one else, later you can live and give like no one else ~ Dave Ramsey\n\nI will be honest that in order for FPU to work, you have to do a lot of work. I probably allocate at least 5 to 10 minutes a day on my personal budget. I spend at least an hour a month reflecting on the previous month of spending and planning the next month. Since beginning the class, I have only used my credit cards twice and both times I paid those purchases by the end of the month. I have an active savings account. I have a plan to pay down my existing debt and not to incur more debt. Starbucks visits are a treat, not an everyday occurrence. I now view my relationship with money so differently. I use the Financial Peace University philosophy as a grounding exercise and budgeting no longer causes anxiety.\n\nCheck out this video about Financial Peace University\n\nFinding the Young!\n\nSpike Cook, Millville, NJ\n\nAs a Middle School Principal of 1,100 students it is sometimes difficult to make individual connections. We are all busy but there are times when we have to stop in our tracks and listen to the youth, and find the young! Earlier this year, 11 year old Mya Reid, published her first book of poetry apply titled Finding The Young.\n\nWhen I talked with Mya about her passion for writing, she told me that she started in 4th grade when a teacher gave her a journal. Since that time she has written many poems, short stories and ideas in that journal. Fortunately, she connected with Mikey Wayward, a local Millville poet, who helped Mya to take her poems to the next level. She admits that life hasn’t always been easy but she finds solace in her writing.\n\nMya’s partnership with Mikey Wayward, known as Mr. Mike, has continued to flourish. He has helped her and encouraged her to continue writing and expand her language. They have a new, collaborative book of poetry due out this month.\n\nI highly recommend you check out Finding the Young. There are 44 poems in the book and you will be mesmerized by her words! Here is one of my favorites:\n\nFriendly Hollow\n\nI’ll be leader, you be the follower.\n\nI’ll show great leadership\n\nBecause my name is friendly hollow.\n\nI sleep in the night\n\nYou play in the day.\n\nWe’re totally different\n\nBut, we think the same way\n\nYour friendship I don’t borrow\n\nI keep\n\nI know because you sweep me off my feet\n\nI respect your expectations.\n\nSo you I follow.\n\nI hope you follow me, friendly hollow.\n\nBook Review – From Leading to Succeeding!\n\nFrom Leading to Succeeding: The Seven Elements of Effective Leadership in Education By Douglas Reeves\n\nReview – Spike C. Cook, Ed.D.\n\nSchool leaders are constantly searching for a practical book with realistic opportunities to improve teaching and learning. From Leading to Succeeding: The Seven Elements of Effective Leadership is a book that will exceed the expectations of the reader. Be prepared to be inspired and to enact a systemic process of change that will benefit teachers, students and the school community. In short, this book should be required reading for all school leaders!\n\nReeves outlines seven elements that will assist leaders. The seven elements are purpose, trust, focus, leverage, feedback, change and sustainability. These comprehensive elements provide a scaffolding for leaders to take their organization to the next level and beyond. Reeves doesn’t take this opportunity lightly to assist leaders seriously being concrete with the application of these elements and more importantly why they exist.\n\nHere is an overview of the seven elements:\n\nPurpose\n\nWhat is the purpose within your organization? For instance, as you approach tasks as a leader are you able to articulate why something is worth everyone’s time and energy? Do you know what the end results will be? These are questions that Reeves delves into providing applicable answers.\n\nTrust\n\nWhen you think about your relationship with your staff or community is there a level of trust? Reeves points out that people will not be able to follow a leader that they do not trust. In addition, Reeves is able to challenge even the most well intentioned school leader to revisit the organization’s mission statement and how decisions can support or detract trust.\n\nFocus\n\nWhen was the last time you examined the initiatives in your school? Are you trying to do too much at once? In this section, Reeves helps school leaders to avoid the initiative fatigue that plagues school districts. His practical advice will cause school leaders to take a step back from the next shiny toy and develop a “less is more approach.”\n\nLeverage\n\nIn this section, Reeves helps school leaders to understand how and when to use their influence to improve the organization. In addition, he points out that school districts need to assess their standardized assessments and curriculum to determine which issue requires the most attention to yield the best results.\n\nFeedback\n\nIf immediate and frequent feedback to teachers is not common place in your school, you are running the risk to stifle improvement. Reeves challenges school leaders to help teachers go beyond right and wrong answers to being specific with feedback. He also provides technique suggestions on how feedback improves performance when given in a timely manner.\n\nChange\n\nHave you ever wondered how you lead change? Do you have any idea whether you are effective in leading change? If you have, Reeves provides support and clear insight on how to not only manage but lead change in your school. Be ready to answer tough, reflective questions such as: what can you control, what will you change, and are you willing to be unpopular due to the change initiative?\n\nSustainability\n\nWill your legacy be short lived or will it be an opportunity for the organization to be poised for long term, effective growth? Reeves expresses the research pointing out that school leaders do not have longevity. Therefore, it needs to be understood that decisions need to be approached with a higher level of consideration, will have long lasting impact on the organization, and can be met with cynicism.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are ready to do the hard work required to improve your organization, Reeves’s book will be a helpful tool to assist your leadership because it combines theory and practice as well as structured activities that will take you from Leading to Succeeding.\n\nWhat is your 2.0?\n\nA few weeks ago I was on a hike with a good friend of mine. Throughout the conversation we talked about how people transition in life and work. She asked me a really tough question… What is your 2.0?\n\nWe are not computers, phones or even software but the analogy can certainly be made. As humans we evolve, transcend and we change. This is constantly happening whether we like it or not; sometimes life even forces you to change.\n\nThere are no rules or playbooks for change, of course there are countless books, podcasts and movies dedicated to the process of change. But, if you were to really dig down deep they only offer a few suggestions or ideas, and if you are fortunate one of those tools will help you with that change. Yet, isn’t personal change and personal developments just that… personal.\n\nBack in January 2012 I jumped in with two feet into the world of Social Media. I made so many connections and the tools helped me to grow as a leader and a learner. I was able to present at local, state and national conferences. Published two books and co-founded a successful podcast for aspiring and current administrators. I spent the better part of five years maintaining two blogs (one for school and this one) as well as writing for other publications. One year I actually blogged every day (365 new posts). Yet there has always been something missing. Many times, I felt like it was a chore, constantly searching for something that I could not capture or contain. I was glued to my phone, laptop and whatever social media app I could find.\n\nOver the past year I have benefited from the practice of mindfulness. Slowly developing a healthier work/life balance, being present and most importantly shutting devices off. I implemented a daily meditation and gratitude journal, practice yoga a few times a week and hike every chance I get. There are days that go by when I realize that I haven’t checked Twitter and weeks have gone by when I realize that I haven’t checked Voxer. I took my work email off of my smart phone, and find myself going through Facebook for the articles and events as opposed to trying to find out who has the latest and greatest application. I’ve even slowed down my personal blogging to only a post or two a month. I still read a lot but I am going back to buying real books. I’ve even considered going back to a flip phone!\n\nSo when I finally answered the question of “what is your 2.0?” I actually realized I had already started doing it over the last year. Slowly but surely I am developing the 2.0 of myself. This is what brings me to this post. Now I can actually articulate what my 2.0.\n\nThis is my 2.0:\n\nLess screen time, more outside time.\n\nRedesigned focus on my personal blog to reflect my new passion… hiking. I have even thought of a name “Take a hike with Spike.”\n\nMore focus and being present with my main job which is to be the best principal I can be for my staff and students.\n\nWorking with staff, students and others in the education world on mindfulness, meditation and gratitude.\n\nSo over the next few weeks I will be redesigning this site to focus more on what it can do to help others achieve a work/life balance. I will be evaluating the social media applications I use and more importantly, why.\n\nI ask you again, what is your 2.0 and how will you get there?\n\nAn Attitude of Gratitude\n\nOn October 4, 2016 I met with a Professional Development coach hired by the district to assist administrators with whatever they were struggling with as a leader. At the time I was stressed about a lot of things such as the beginning of the year challenges, there were a few initiatives that were not going so well, and personally I was drained.\n\nHer first question to me after I went through everything that was going wrong really threw me off… She asked, “So what are you grateful for?” I struggled to even remember what gratitude meant, much less what I was grateful for. I quickly replied, “I am grateful for my kids.” She validated my answer but challenged me to look more micro. She went on to talk about sunshine, trees, life, food, someone smiling, showers, etc. Then it hit me … there is so much to be grateful for.\n\nShe taught me how to make a gratitude list and how to incorporate it into a daily mediation that would be completed in the morning. She also recommended that I purchase The Magic by Rhonda Byrne. I highly recommend to get this book! I read it and applied each of the suggestions in the book for a month and it did wonders for my life and my school!\n\nEveryday (well I have missed a day or two here and there) since October 4, 2016 I wake up and complete a very basic Gratitude List. I focus on 5 things I was grateful for from the previous day. As I stated before, this was very difficult in the beginning because I was focusing on the wrong things. This journal has helped me overcome the stress, anxiety of being a father, and a principal.\n\nPractical Applications for Schools\n\nThose in the field of education can empathize with the stress, and demands of our profession. Whether it is federal, state or local initiatives, fights, bullying, curriculum, poverty, etc we are always facing some type of challenge. For instance, prior to doing the gratitude list I would be extremely disappointed when we had a fight in our school. It would be as if the entire day was ruined. Since doing the gratitude list I can put things in a better perspective. Now, although I am disappointed, I realize that there were 1,100 other students who came to school and did not fight. I realize that there were thousands upon thousands of interactions with students that did not result in a fight.\n\nSo as you can see the Gratitude List can make small, important changes in your perspective. As an educator you will be transformed through gratitude and pretty soon you may even have your students and teachers writing gratitude lists!"
