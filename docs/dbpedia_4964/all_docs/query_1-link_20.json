        "text": "CMA Fest got its start with fan club parties, but what does that look like for a new generation?\n\nFrom custom trucker hats to branded cocktails and selfie photos with singers, here’s what fans can expect from one up-and-coming duo.\n\nHip-hop artist Brian Brown has his own way of repping Nashville\n\nListen\n\nIt’s tradition for hip-hop artists to rep the places, people and scenes they come from with fierce displays of pride. But in Brown’s music, including his new album, “BBGonProfit,” released in December, he makes a subtler art of speaking to and for his city, watchful and witty from where he stands on the fringes of Nashville’s powerful music industry and booming economic growth.\n\nPodcast bonus: Behind the music of The Kids of Rutherford County\n\nListen\n\n“Minimalist classic country with maximalist tendencies.” That’s one way to describe the musical scoring of The Kids of Rutherford County.\n\nWhat Where When-sday: The 5 Spot\n\nThis week for What Where Whens-day our special guest is Travis Collinsworth, co-owner of The 5 Spot in East Nashville. The venue has been around since 2003. Collinsworth started as an employee for the original two owners before buying in with another staff member Todd Sherwood in 2006. The 5 Spot features a wide array […]\n\nListen: Inside Mitski’s surprise concert at the Belcourt Theatre\n\nListen\n\nPassionate Mitski fans flew in from all across the country to sit in a movie theater and listen to Mitski’s new album “The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We” a full week before its release on Sept. 15. The event read, “Listening Event and Film selected by Mitski – NOT A LIVE PERFORMANCE.”\n\nHow Mya Byrne paved her long, winding road to country music with grit and sparkle\n\nMya Byrne loved country music since her childhood in New Jersey. But it took years of searching and traveling to lead to the place where she could make her new album, “Rhinestone Tomboy.”\n\nAndréWolfe’s ‘Wolves Don’t Howl They Sing’ is WNXP’s Record of the Week\n\nListen\n\nFrom the title of AndréWolfe’s new album, “Wolves Don’t Howl They Sing,” to its tone of bruising disclosure and its cover image of a single wild canine turning from the pack to bellow at the sky, he plays out the radical reorientation that he’s undergone with his own musical expression.\n\nFrom Kendrick Lamar to Diarrhea Planet, Bonnaroo’s lineup blends national headliners and regional favorites\n\nKendrick Lamar, Foo Fighters, Zed’s Dead, Liquid Stranger and Odesza are the headliners for Bonnaroo this summer. The lineup for the festival in Manchester, Tennessee, came out Tuesday.\n\nThat’s a wrap: Listen to Nashville Public Radio’s top songs of 2022\n\nIt’s that time of year streaming services remind us all of the musical journey we’ve each been on for the last 365 days. Here are the songs that snagged the top spot for Nashville Public Radio staffers."
