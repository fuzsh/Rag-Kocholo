        "text": "The Impact of Daughter: Community Responses\n\nMy release for \"Daughter\" has been everything I have hoped for. I honestly, thought that I was going to get a lot of hate from inside the trans masculine community for the lyrical content of the song, but hey, that didn't happen. I think it was because so many people expressed how much they related and how much they understood the lyrics in their own way. I think the love scared the haters off! The video was released in Billboard Magazine, and TomboyX and Huffington Post also covered the story. It was also featured in one of my favorite magazines Accidental Bear, and also in several indie blogs like: Listen Here Reviews, Human.Co, RTP Music Blog, Yab Yum Music & Arts, and MySoCalledGayLife.UK. I feel so blessed for all the support I have gotten so far! The song has also been placed in 214 playlists on Spotify already (by people like you)! According to my Spotify stats, people have listened to the song an average of 6 times.\n\nBut press and stats aside, the response from the community has been incredible. Dozens of people have DM'd me on Instagram telling me that they finally came out to their parents because they finally had the words to express themselves. People told me that they have never fully related to a song until \"Daughter\" came out. People told me that they showed their parents the song and their parents finally get them. This is why I wanted to put this song out there. I wrote this song for my dad and it was totally for fun. Then I realized, this song could probably help someone's parents or help a trans person. And it has. And I'm so happy and amazed. I'm grateful. I'm so grateful because I was able to create something that was said simply enough that so many people could understand it. I was able to create something that has an impact on the community and family members of the community. I was able to create something that makes people's struggles so much easier.\n\nI have gathered some quotes from members of the community (mostly artists) for your reading.\n\nThe last few days have been amazing. @racheldoesstuff is a QUEEN, and @jazzjennings_ was so sweet. Thank you @glaad for a blast. And my love @mollyelizabethquinn for being my date. üíôüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüôåüèº Enjoy my awkward pics in weird light. #glaadawards\n\nwelcome to my world\n\nI've been in New Jersey a lot the past several weeks! Lots of photographers to train and babies to photograph! (Btw: this photo is actually for a training on \"what not to wear\" at work!) . . . . #newbornphotography #photographer\n\n\"Because writing music and performing it to millions of people around the world is my destiny, it is what I was born to do and I need that rush to live. Without it, I'd be miserable\"\n\n\"Live your life as though your every act were to become a universal law.\" - Immanuel Kant üì∏ by the lovely @renadkinzzz . . . . . . . #qotd #quoteoftheday #quotes #philosophy #wisdom #thoughts #thegoldenrule #sweaterweather #mensfashion #mensstyle #streetstyle #ftm #trans #transgender #transman #transboy #queer #nonbinary #nb #fuckgenderroles #lgbt #lgbtq #beyourself #emo #sadboy #sadboys #igers #igaddict #igdaily #photooftheday\n\nThe music video production was sponsored by TomboyX and was shot and edited by Maxine Bowen.\n\nDivided we stall‚úñÔ∏è// together we can move mountains.
