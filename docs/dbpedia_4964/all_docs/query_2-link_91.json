Reaching into the well of Americana influences, from countrypolitan to glam-pop, blues, folk-rock, and ghostly incantations, Mya combines them into a singular voice and vision. Her storytelling is rich, powerful, and poetic, with elements of John Prine’s whimsy, Leonard Cohen’s spiritual gravitas, Dylan’s wit, and Lucinda Williams’ aching sensuality.\n\nAn out and proud queer trans woman, Mya recently became an official Gibson artist, and signed with Kill Rock Stars as the first artist on its new Nashville/Americana imprint, releasing the single “Autumn Sun” from her upcoming LP produced in Nashville by Grammy-nominated Aaron Lee Tasjan to praise from Rolling Stone, Billboard, and No Depression, plus key adds to radio, Sirius XM, & official playlists on Spotify and Apple Music. She also created the music for Amazon Music’s Country Heat Weekly podcast and is featured on Reba’s top ten remix of \"I'm a Survivor\"."
