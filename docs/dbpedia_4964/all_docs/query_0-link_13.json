        "text": "The Alabama Shakes singer exploded preconceptions with her 2019 solo debut. On What Now, a follow-up born from a few years of life-quaking resets, she's ready to leave any remaining limits behind.\n\nLuke Combs' cover of Tracy Chapman's 1988 hit \"Fast Car\" won single of the year. Chapman got song of the year â€” making her the first Black songwriter to win in that category.\n\nTwo years ago, Allison Russell's breakthrough album took the roots music world by storm. Now nominated for the genre's highest honor, Russell has a new goal: to open Americana up even more.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Be Your Own Pet's frenetic punk sneered at the trappings of adulthood. The group returns after a 15-year hiatus with Mommy, an album that builds on its oppositional beginnings.\n\nIn Oladokun's new songs, facets of who she is and what she's lived, seen and imagined provide entry points to her homey pop music.\n\nMya Byrne loved country music since her childhood in New Jersey. But it took years of searching and traveling to lead to the place where she could make her new album, Rhinestone Tomboy.\n\nDue to a new Tennessee law limiting drag performances, many drag artists, as well as trans, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming musicians, worry about their prospects in Nashville and beyond."
