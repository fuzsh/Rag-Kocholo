        "text": "From September 2014 to September 2015, I wrote about one New Jersey-related song a day in NJArts.net’s 350 Jersey Songs project. The idea was to find one song a day that has to do with Jersey in some way: It was either recorded by a New Jerseyan, or in New Jersey, or has some Jersey content in it (or, in many cases, has two or three of these elements).\n\nOne other thing: It had to be a song I like, and thought people will enjoy hearing.\n\nHere is the list of the songs in the project, linked to the song pages. They are listed chronologically.
