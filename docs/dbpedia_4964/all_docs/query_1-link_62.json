        "text": "Lenox Principals attend the National Conference on School Leadership\n\nLenox— Superintendent William Collins is proud to share that Lenox Memorial Middle High School Principal Jeremiah Ames and Morris Elementary School Principal Brenda Kelley recently attended UNITED, the National Conference on School Leadership.\n\nElementary and secondary school leaders from around the nation gathered in Nashville for an unparalleled opportunity to collaborate and discuss the most pressing topics in education. The Lenox Principals joined a record number of Massachusetts principals attending this year’s conference.\n\n“It’s always nice to have an opportunity to think about school removed from the environment we’re in throughout the school year,” said Principal Ames. “It provides a valuable lens to think about and discuss issues we’re faced with all year long.”\n\n“This conference provided a fantastic platform for collaboration and discussion on current education topics. Networking with principals nationwide, including many from Massachusetts, was invaluable,” said Principal Kelley. “It was inspiring to exchange ideas and strategies. The expert-led sessions offered new insights and innovative approaches I am eager to bring back to Lenox.”\n\n“It is valuable for principals to network with instructional leaders from around the country and to share ideas, learn about the latest research, and hear firsthand about the current best approaches in teaching and learning,” Dr. Collins said. “I commend the commitment of Mrs. Kelley and Dr. Ames to stay current in educational leadership trends. LPS is fortunate to have such dedicated leaders.”\n\n***\n\n1Berkshire welcomes Youth Leadership Program class of 2025\n\nBerkshire— 1Berkshire is excited to welcome its 13th class into the Berkshire Youth Leadership Program.

Selected students have shown a significant capacity to grow their leadership skills and a strong desire to have a positive impact on their communities.\n\nOver the next nine months, these 29 students will convene at locations all around the region to participate in workshops, engage in meaningful group dialogues, learn from speakers and one another, and to develop and execute their selected collective impact project. With a focus on sustainability and diversity, equity, and inclusion, this year’s program will also aim to engage students in meaningful discussions that create critical reflection and new levels of self awareness as we seek to support qualities associated with global citizenry and cultural humility.\n\nKevin Pink, Deputy Director of Economic Development at 1Berkshire, and co-director of the Youth Leadership Program notes, “During this year’s kick-off retreat, our students began to build connections and think about how their individual learning and communication styles interact.” He adds, “We are thrilled to embark on another wonderful year in which our students will learn about career opportunities and resources available to them here in the Berkshires, as well as designing and executing a project to make a positive impact here in our region and in the world.”\n\nStudents in the Youth Leadership Program leave with a new group of friends from all around the county, a unique and deep understanding of career opportunities here in the Berkshires, and the pride of completing a project that has positively impacted their community.\n\nThe 2024-2025 Youth Leadership Class participants are:\n\nNatalie Aldrich – Wahconah Regional High School\n\nSophie Alsmaan – Wahconah Regional High School\n\nLauren Bridges – Lenox Memorial Middle and High School\n\nLilianna Choque – BART Charter Public School\n\nNyla Dion – Hoosac Valley Regional High School\n\nAthan Dungey – Wahconah Regional High School\n\nNyx Hall – BART Charter Public School\n\nAutumn Higa – Monument Mountain Regional High School\n\nCharlie Keator – Lenox Memorial Middle and High School\n\nIsla Kirchner – Pittsfield High School\n\nEllen Klepetar – Pittsfield High School\n\nMaddy Kotek – Lee High School\n\nKiera Kristensen – Mount Greylock Regional High School\n\nSophia LaMalfa – Pittsfield High School\n\nBrooklynn Lamke – Lenox Memorial Middle and High School\n\nSarah Leedham – BART Charter Public School\n\nConnor McCormack – Lenox Memorial Middle and High School\n\nAudrianna Pelkey – Mount Greylock Regional High School\n\nIsabella Pereira – Lenox Memorial Middle and High School\n\nMaddie Powell – Mount Greylock Regional High School\n\nKylah Rivard – BART Charter Public School\n\nJames Smith – Pittsfield High School\n\nFrancesca Stanmeyer – Monument Mountain Regional High School\n\nSadie Suters – Monument Mountain Regional High School\n\nJo Tessier – Lenox Memorial Middle and High School\n\nCharlotte Towler – Mount Greylock Regional High School\n\nBen Westlake – Lenox Memorial Middle and High School\n\nMateo Whalen-Loux – Mount Greylock Regional High School\n\nNina Wied – Mount Greylock Regional High School\n\n***\n\nBerkshire Community College announces spring dean’s list\n\nPittsfield— Berkshire Community College (BCC) is pleased to announce it has named 391 students to the spring 2024 dean’s list.\n\nTo be eligible for the dean’s list, students must achieve a GPA of 3.750 to 4.000 to earn high honors, while students with a GPA of 3.250 to 3.749 earn an honors designation.
