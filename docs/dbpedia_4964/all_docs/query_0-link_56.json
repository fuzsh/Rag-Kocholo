For the past several years, Four Sisters Winery in Belvidere, New Jersey has played host to Muses in the Vineyard, billed as a “Celebration of Music Of the Women, By the Women and For Everyone.” Now in its fourth year, the festival, set for May 16-17, will feature sets by 18 local, regional, national and international touring artists and groups.\n\nMuses in the Vineyard will extend from 11am-6pm each day. Slated to perform on Saturday, May 16, are Tret Fure, Natalia Zukerman, Nalani & Sarina, 9 5IVE 4OUR (featuring Christine Havrilla, Gretchen Schultz and Christine Moll), Mieka Pauley, Dina Hall, Lori Diamond, and Beth Sherby. Sunday opens with a song swap featuring New York City-based singer-songwriters Carolann Solebello, Karyn Oliver, Honor Finnegan and Mya Byrne, and continues with sets by Jerzy Jung, Amanda Duncan, Grace Morrison, Harpeth Rising, and Sloan Wainwright. The Nields (sisters Nerissa and Katryna) close out the musical festivities.\n\nAttendees are advised to bring lawn chairs or blankets to enjoy the music at the winery that is nestled in a valley amidst the rolling fields and picturesque hills of Warren County. Winery tours and tastings will be available, as will food and other beverages. Crafters and artisans, children’s activities and more are also slated.\n\nPresented by Foul Rift Productions, an offshoot of Folk on Foul Rift House Concerts, the festival will benefit the Animal Welfare Society of Monroe (A.W.S.O.M.), a shelter and adoption agency that aims to alleviate the plight of lost, homeless and helpless animals."
