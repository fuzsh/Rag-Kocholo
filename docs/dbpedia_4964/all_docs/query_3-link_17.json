        "text": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. – Head coach Nadalie Walsh has completed her roster for the 2025 season with the additions of Northern Illinois transfer Emmalise Nock and freshman Sydney Wilke. Nock and Wilke join six other Illini newcomers: Kennedy Brown, Chloe Cho, Ashlyn Doyle, Marly Esteves, Mya Gordon and Eden King.\n\nEMMALISE NOCK | ALL-AROUND | PREVIOUS SCHOOL: NORTHERN ILLINOIS\n\nAn incoming senior, Emmalise Nock is a seasoned veteran who competed in all 11 meets last year on bars, vault and floor for Northern Illinois.\n\nThe Rosemount, Minn., native made her NCAA postseason debut as an individual event specialist on floor exercise at the Denver Regional in 2023 and scored a 9.875 on floor, which tied the program's all-time best mark by a Huskie in NCAA competition.\n\n\"Welcoming Emmalise to our Illini family is a huge positive for us,\" said head coach Nadalie Walsh. \"Her experience and competitive success at Northern Illinois will translate very well into our program. I love her spunk, personality and drive to be the best. I anticipate her being able to be an all-around contender with a focus on leading the floor team.\"\n\nSYDNEY WILKE | ALL-AROUND | CLUB: US GYMNASTICS DEVELOPMENT CENTER II\n\n\"Sydney Wilke is going to be a hidden gem for this team,\" Nadalie Walsh said. \"She comes to us with great skills, incredible difficulty on vault and such a positive and welcoming attitude.\"\n\nThe Ridgewood, N.J., native is a three-time level 10 qualifier and placed third on floor and vault at the New Jersey state championships.\n\nWilke chose to join Illinois because of \"the amazing coaching staff and the girls on the team who made me feel right at home.\"\n\n\"We know that Sydney will contribute to the team in more ways than just her skills in the gym,\" Walsh added. \"She is a great student and hard worker, and I believe her potential is through the roof. We're excited to add her to the roster!\""
