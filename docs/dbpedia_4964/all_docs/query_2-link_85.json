        "text": "We’re really excited to host Mya Byrne for a special in-store performance and album signing at Grimey’s on Wednesday, September 20th as we launch a week of fun events centered around AmericanFest 2023. This spring Byrne released a new record via Kill Rock Stars Nashville and we’ve been looking forward to celebrating it with her ever since! She’ll be in town to perform & speak at AmericanaFest 2023—you can catch her official showcase at The Vinyl Lounge on Thursday, September 21st at 10:00 PM and her panels at Country Music Hall of Fame Ford Theatre on 9/20, and the Westin on 9/22. In addition to her showcase set, Byrne will be performing at the Kill Rock Stars Nashville & Bloodshot Records AmericanaFest Day party on 9/21 at Estelle.\n\nAt our event, Byrne will perform a short set of songs and then sign copies of Rhinestone Tomboy. The album is available on our site here and in the record store on ‘Deep Purple’ colored vinyl LP & CD. All copies purchased in person at the shop or for local / store pickup include a signing wristband. Wristbands are required for the signing for all 13+ Space is limited and wristbands guarantee event entrance.\n\nMya Byrne is a rich, powerful Americana storyteller, delivering a blend of country, glam-pop, blues and poetic folk songwriting. Out and proud, she is a leader for the presence of queer trans women in country and Americana, and is one of the first two trans artists to play AmericanaFest. Recently featured on Reba’s Top Ten remix of “I’m A Survivor” (on mandolin & lap steel), Byrne was named a 2022 Artist to Watch by Nashville Scene/CMT, and wrote and performed the theme song for Amazon Music’s Country Heat podcast hosted by Kelly Sutton. She’s recently released Rhinestone Tomboy, the first album to be released on the Kill Rock Stars Nashville imprint and it was produce by our pal Aaron Lee Tasjan (who also plays on the album.) You can read more about it on our webstore here, where you can also purchase a copy including a wristband for Byrne’s signing here after her in-store performance. Produced by Aaron Lee Tasjan, the album was recorded and mixed by Gregory Lattimer and mastered by Amy Dragon. All songs written by Mya Byrne, with co-writing credits going to Karen Dahlstrom and Linda McRae. Additional musicians on the album include Tasjan (electric, acoustic and 12-string guitars, organ, harmony vocals), Ellen Angelico (electric, 12-string, baritone and steel guitars), Tommy Scifres (bass, fuzz bass, harmony vocals), Megan Coleman (drums, percussion) and Scott Stein (organ)."
