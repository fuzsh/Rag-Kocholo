        "text": "Tennessee just passed the first U.S. law regulating generative AI in music. But the technology, adept at copying real artists' voices and styles, is moving too quickly for one law to keep up with.\n\nThe Alabama Shakes singer exploded preconceptions with her 2019 solo debut. On What Now, a follow-up born from a few years of life-quaking resets, she's ready to leave any remaining limits behind.\n\nLuke Combs' cover of Tracy Chapman's 1988 hit \"Fast Car\" won single of the year. Chapman got song of the year â€” making her the first Black songwriter to win in that category.\n\nTwo years ago, Allison Russell's breakthrough album took the roots music world by storm. Now nominated for the genre's highest honor, Russell has a new goal: to open Americana up even more.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Be Your Own Pet's frenetic punk sneered at the trappings of adulthood. The group returns after a 15-year hiatus with Mommy, an album that builds on its oppositional beginnings.\n\nIn Oladokun's new songs, facets of who she is and what she's lived, seen and imagined provide entry points to her homey pop music."
