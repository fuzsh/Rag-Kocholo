        "text": "John R. Augenblick\n\nPresident | MBA, CFP®\n\nJohn was born and raised in New Hope, PA and returned home as a founder of Rockwood Wealth Management. He cares deeply about his local community and serves as a board member of the New Hope-Solebury School District and the Mercer Museum in Doylestown, PA. John previously served his country as a naval officer in the submarine warfare community. A certified nuclear engineer, John supervised the operation of naval nuclear reactors and was responsible for nuclear weapons targeting – so yes, he is guilty of being a bit overly analytical at times. These days, however, he much prefers sailboats and sunshine to submarines and warfighting. John graduated from the United States Naval Academy with distinction, earning a degree in Systems Engineering. While teaching engineering at the United States Naval Academy, John earned his MBA at Johns Hopkins University where he focused his studies on portfolio development, investment analysis, and entrepreneurship. John still lives in New Hope, Pennsylvania with his wife, Elizabeth, and their two children. Outside the office, you can almost always find John on the soccer field. You might also catch him gardening, enjoying nature on a quiet trail in the Catskills with family, teaching his kids to snowboard, or sharing a hard-to-find craft tequila with his friends.\n\nMark T.

While he enjoys his urban lifestyle, he has come to appreciate the natural beauty of Bucks County and is looking forward to moving to the New Hope area with his wife Ellie in the coming years. Prior to his career in Financial Planning, Sam spent his college years obtaining a BA in Economics from Lafayette College, where, when not focusing on Economics or playing on the Varsity Soccer team, he was studying Psychology and its role in his favorite topic, personal finance. After Lafayette, Sam continued his formal education at Villanova University where he earned a Master’s Degree in Taxation. Here he gained an appreciation for the nuances of the federal taxation system and the roles, both obvious and overlooked, that it plays in our lives.\n\nMegan J.

He particularly appreciates working with many of the same client families for over 20 years, often alongside multiple family generations. He is known around the office for his expertise planning for corporate executives, clients in personal or employment transition, and the complexities of international planning.

Brian received his BA from Rutgers University where he focused on Political Science and Philosophy. He performed graduate work at Fordham and Boston University before receiving his Master’s of International Business from the Edinburgh Business School, UK. However, it may have been his study of philosophy that led him to start an independent firm, as he questioned why big banks often delivered financial services to the detriment of the very clients they were built to serve. Brian lives in Bucks County, and has one son in Boston College and another attending Holy Ghost Prep High School. When not biking as a family on the canal path or in LBI, Brian is an avid outdoorsman and has been an officer of the Union League’s Rod & Gun Club since its founding in 2000.
