        "text": "How to Write Coordinates of Latitude and Longitude\n\nHow to Write Coordinates\n\nBefore we plunge into writing GPS coordinates, it is essential that you know about Global Positioning System (GPS).\n\nWhat are the GPS Coordinates\n\nGPS coordinates are the part of GPS system, which means Global Positioning System. It is a worldwide navigation system and that people use for pinpointing an exact location on the globe. Besides this, GPS obtains the current time of any specific location.\n\nThe system works with the help of man-made satellites, known as GPS satellites. These geographical satellites orbit above our planet at a great speed and with high precision. The devices use low-powered waves to communicate with the other satellites to determine accurate locations on the Earth.\n\nIf you need any type of assignment, reach out to our reliable writing partners:\n\nLongitude and Latitude – GPS Coordinates\n\nRepresenting the coordinates of GPS, latitude, and longitude are the units of the coordinate system. Just like every house has a physical location with an address that includes street name, number, city, country, etc., every single place on the globe is searchable with longitude and latitude coordinates. Both the map coordinates are imaginary lines on the globe, specifying locations virtually to put it simply.\n\nLatitude vs. Longitude\n\nWhat is Latitude?\n\nLines of Latitude are imaginary and horizontal. They form an angle between equatorial planes. The Equator is the longest and central line of latitude. It marks as 0-degree latitude.\n\nWhat is Longitude?\n\nStretching from North to the South, lines of Longitude are imaginary and vertical. The main longitude line is called Prime Meridian that shows 0 – degrees longitude.\n\nWriting Map Coordinates – Latitude and Longitude\n\nMap coordinates are the standard form of specifying an accurate location on the globe. Writing longitude and latitude is not only different but also follows a specific format. It requires the use of the correct symbol and a clear understanding of how to read and write them.\n\nThere are a couple of ways you can write coordinates on the map. By using one latitude line and one longitude line, you can represent map coordinates. The other methods include identifying the lines of longitude and latitude on the map. Then, select an appropriate format to place the numbers, symbols, decimals, and degrees.\n\nTo help you learn the easiest format, we have described all four methods here.\n\nHow to Write Basic Longitude and Latitude\n\nIdentify Longitude Lines\n\nStretching from North to the South Pole, lines of longitude move across the globe vertically. The line ‘Prime Meridian’ is a central point and divides longitude lines. It has 0-degree mark “°” that you need to use while indicating the degrees.\n\nAs the lines of longitude move from east to west direction, each line increases by 1 degree. Use letter ‘S’ to show the longitude line falling within the east side of the prime meridian. For example, a longitude line can be 20° E.\n\nThe case is same when the lines of longitude fall within the west side of Prime Meridian. They also increase by 1 degree as you move onwards. You can indicate them by using the symbol ‘W’ such as 18° W.\n\nIdentify Latitude Lines\n\nStretching from East to West, lines of latitude move across the globe horizontally. The main line is equator here which has the same mark zero degrees as longitude lines. It has the same symbol “°” to show degrees.\n\nThis coordinate of location increases by 1 degree until it reaches 90 degrees when you go north of the equatorial line. The 90 degree marks the North Pole f the equatorial line. It uses symbol ‘N’ to indicate north. For example, 20°N.\n\nThe lines of latitude follow the same method when moving south of the equatorial line. Each line increases by a 1-degree mark until it reaches 90 degrees. Using ‘S’ as a symbol for South, you can indicate it like ‘14° S.\n\nConnect the Map Coordinates\n\nAt the third stage of this phase, you need to determine where both map coordinates connect on the map. For instance, your location may have 20° E longitude line and 20°N latitude line on the map. When writing the geographical lines, begin with the latitude line, put a comma and then write longitude such as 20° N, 20° E.\n\nWriting Coordinates with Minutes, Seconds and Degrees\n\nIdentify the Geographical Lines on the Map\n\nThis method tells you the locations with improved accuracy than just identifying the map coordinates. To determine the précised locations, you can break down geographical lines (longitude and latitude) in minutes and seconds. The first step is to identify the broad lines of map coordinates.\n\nFor example, your location can be 15°N and 20° E\n\nCount the Minutes between the Geographical Lines\n\nThis part is the most important step of this method. There is one-degree space between each longitude and latitude line. This degree is further broken into minutes. Let us suppose there are 70 even minutes between the lines of longitude and latitude. You need to pinpoint the exact line falling between the lines of longitude and latitude and showing the minutes. Use an apostrophe to indicate the minutes between geographical lines. You can use online maps to help you find the exact number of minutes.\n\nFor example, if there are 25 minutes between the lines, write “25”.\n\nFind the Second between the Geographical Lines\n\nThe next step is finding the seconds once you identify minutes between the geographical lines. Each minute has 60 seconds, and an online map can help you locate the exact interval between the minutes. Use a quotation mark to indicate them.\n\nFor example, if your longitude line has 20 seconds between the minutes, write 20”.\n\nPut Degrees, Minutes and Seconds in Order\n\nThe next step is to put the précised coordinates in order. You can follow this format\n\nLatitude line with the degree\n\nMinutes\n\nSeconds\n\nSymbol of directions N or S\n\nComma and longitude line with the degree\n\nMinutes\n\nSeconds\n\nSymbol of directions E or W\n\nThe geographical lines will be like, 15° 25’20”N, 20°15’4” E\n\nWriting Coordinates with Degree, Decimal Minutes\n\nIdentify the Geographical Lines\n\nThe third method uses a decimal point to indicate the minutes. However, it also starts with the same process of identifying the geographical lines of longitude and latitude. Find out the connecting points of broad lines on the map to pinpoint the location.\n\nLet us suppose your location is 25°N, 10°W.\n\nFind the Minutes, Using Decimal Points\n\nSome maps use decimals with the minutes instead of using seconds. Using the online map to identify decimals is a convenient way to find the decimal value for each longitude and latitude line.\n\nFor example, you may find a latitude line at 25.0534 minutes.\n\nDetermine the Positive and Negative Value of the Numbers\n\nThe method does not rely on identifying the directions like East, West, North or South. However, it requires you to use negative and positive numbers to find the locations falling on the map.\n\nThe important point is to remember the correct direction of the geographical line. The lines of latitude stretch from N to S on the equatorial line. The north includes the positive numbers and South includes negative numbers.\n\nAs Lines of longitude stretch across E to W of the Prime Meridian (PM), numbers that fall east of PM are positive and the numbers that fall west of PM are negative.\n\nFor example: 25.0534 fall east, and – 25.0534 fall west\n\nWrite out Map Coordinates with Positive and Negative Numbers\n\nTo write the full map locations, begin writing with the latitude line, add other coordinates like minutes and decimals. Put comma and then write longitude line with its minutes and decimals. Do not forget to indicate the coordinates with negative and positive numbers. This format does not include symbols for directions.\n\nAfter identifying geographical lines, minutes and decimals, you can write map coordinate like this 25 10.325, 30 – 25.0534.\n\n4. Decimal Degree\n\nFind the Geographical Lines\n\nYou can also represent degrees of longitude and latitude using decimals. One degree is divided into decimals to pinpoint the accurate location. To learn this format, first, you need to find the right degree of longitude and latitude. For example, 30°N, 15°W\n\nBreak down Lines into Decimal Points\n\nThe next step is to break down these lines into the decimal points. An online map can do this for you. Decimal points usually comprise of five digits.\n\nFor example: 25.326 North, 35.152 South\n\nIdentify the Negative and Positive Value\n\nFollowing the same pattern as method 3, you need to indicate whether the decimal digits are positive or negative. For example, 25.326 or -35.152 for latitude and 45.256 or -31.265 for longitude\n\nWrite Coordinates with Decimals\n\nYou write a line of latitude first. Then you add a decimal degree, comma and decimal degree of longitude. Positive and negative digits indicate directions.\n\nFor example: 30 25.326, 15 -31.265\n\nBottom Line\n\nOverall, there are many ways to represent the geographical lines. Understanding the concept of the Global Positioning System is the first step to learn how to read and write coordinates of longitude and latitude correctly."
