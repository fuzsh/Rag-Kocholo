        "text": "So let me guess: you’re planning an epic trip but are now left wondering when IS the best time to visit Pakistan?\n\nWell first off–congrats! Visiting Pakistan is an adventure like no other.\n\nThe people and landscapes are unmatched, and every single province and territory has something special to offer.\n\nWhile I know you were hoping for a basic and straightforward answer on when to come, the reality is that there isn’t one. Pakistan is a large country with diverse landscapes and climates.\n\nThe best time to visit Sindh in the south is absolutely NOT the best time to visit Hunza Valley in the north. You’ll also find dozens upon dozens of microclimates, especially once you get into the mountains.\n\nEven so, there definitely is a “best” time to travel to each region, and certainly, some months that should be avoided altogether.\n\nI live in Pakistan, and have now traveled to every province and territory in the country, experiencing all four seasons along the way! (Yes, parts of Pakistan do in fact have four seasons.)\n\nMy long-term experience in the country has shaped this guide, which gives a season-by-season AND a month-by-month breakdown of Pakistan’s weather.\n\nHopefully, by the end, you’ll know exactly when you should plan your trip based on your interests!\n\nUnderstanding the Climate in Pakistan\n\nWhen planning your Pakistan itinerary, always keep in mind that you will have to consider very different climates.\n\nWith such varied landscapes–from some of the highest mountains on Earth in Gilgit Baltistan to the deserts of Sindh–we absolutely need to break this down by province/territory.\n\nBut first: there is one universal month that might be the worst time to visit Pakistan, and that’s August. Monsoon rains affect the entire country, and have proven to be catastrophic in 2022.\n\nIf you take away one thing about Pakistan’s climate, remember that August=monsoon!\n\nTemperatures in Pakistan\n\nThe table below shows average temperatures in all of the parts of Pakistan that travelers typically go to.\n\nDoes it snow in Pakistan?\n\nYes! While you might be thinking Pakistan is a hot country, that’s only true for some areas.\n\nMany regions of Pakistan experience snow each winter, which lasts from around December-March, the same as in other countries in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nPlaces in Pakistan that receive snow are situated at higher elevations. Surprisingly, you don’t need to head all the way up to Gilgit Baltistan to see it either.\n\nThere are multiple places within 3 hours of the capital Islamabad that receive snow.\n\nTo experience the best of the winter season in Pakistan, head to:\n\nSwat Valley\n\nNathia Gali\n\nGaliyat\n\nAyubia\n\nGilgit Baltistan\n\nUpper Chitral\n\nMap of The Best Time to Visit Pakistan by Location\n\nSeasons in Pakistan\n\nWhile only a few places in Pakistan have four distinct seasons, every part of the country has seasonal fluctuations.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of Pakistan seasons and where to travel during them:\n\nSummer in Pakistan: High Season in the North (June-September)\n\nA trekker’s paradise\n\nAs the climate in Pakistan is so varied, summer means very different things depending on the region you’re talking about. In the mountainous north, it’s arguably the best time of the year. You’ll find plenty of sunshine, and tourism will be in full swing in places like Hunza Valley and Skardu.\n\nDo keep in mind that June and July are peak times for domestic tourism in Pakistan, which leads to massive amounts of commercial travel. It’s still a beautiful time in the region, and getting off the well-beaten tourist trail is not hard.\n\nPrices in hotels will typically be the highest at this time as well, though things change significantly in September when schools reopen.\n\nSummer is prime time for trekking in the mountains of Pakistan, with hundreds if not thousands of options in KPK and Gilgit Baltistan.\n\nThese mountainous regions are very cold and lack indoor heating, for the most part, so not only is summer the best time to visit Gilgit Baltistan, Chitral, and Swat Valley, but it’s really the only time to visit if you want to see the mountains at their best.\n\nIn South Pakistan (including parts of southern KPK), summer is the absolute worst time of the year. Temperatures regularly exceed 100 F, and the beaches of Sindh and Balochistan become too dangerous to swim in.\n\nIf you’re primarily interested in South Pakistan’s historical sites, avoid planning your trip in the summer.\n\nAutumn in Pakistan: Shoulder Season (October-November)\n\nNature on fire\n\nFall is undoubtedly one of the best seasons in Pakistan. The weather is bearable even in Sindh, and it’s when you’ll finally be able to enjoy the cities–such as the many places to visit in Lahore–without feeling like you’re going to pass out.\n\nWhile it might be too cold for some of the best treks, Autumn is the best time to visit Pakistan if the thought of incredible fall colors interests you.\n\nVirtually all of Gilgit Baltistan becomes an array of orange, yellow and red, with the incredible Hunza Valley and many districts of Skardu being the best places to experience them.\n\nThat being said, you can also see some epic foliage in both Phander (Ghizer District of GB) and Upper Chitral.\n\nWinter in Pakistan: High Season in the South (December-February)\n\nIt’s All About the South\n\nAs beautiful as it is, the winter season in Pakistan is an absolutely frigid time to head to the mountains. Most hotels and homes don’t have heating, and electricity is minimal.\n\nOn the flip side, these are the months of absolutely PERFECT weather throughout Southern Pakistan. It’s during this time that you can swim in Karachi’s beaches and attend local festivals in complete climate comfort.\n\nRain is rare, and most days bring low levels of humidity. I spent the winter of 2021/2022 traveling around Sindh, and it couldn’t have been better.\n\nWhile Sindh will give you sub-tropical vibes during a traditionally freezing season, winter weather in Punjab and southern KPK is significantly colder. You’re definitely going to want to travel with a jacket!\n\nSpring in Pakistan: Shoulder Season (March-May)\n\nFlowers, flowers and more flowers\n\nSpring in Pakistan is all about one thing: blossom season!\n\nFrom mid-March to mid-April, the Northern Areas become awash with cherry, apricot, and apple blossoms that blanket the valleys in light pink and white hues.\n\nThe apricots in particular are an important part of Hunza Valley cuisine – and the valley might be one of the best places to experience this short but magical season.\n\nThough Pakistan is one of the cheapest countries in Asia generally, prices are even more favorable during shoulder seasons.\n\nMarch and April in the mountains see many warm sunny days, though rain is more frequent, especially in April. As for May, the weather is less predictable, but usually will allow you to head out on some actual treks. Though keep in mind, even popular beginner treks like\n\nRakaposhi Basecamp seldom becomes clear until early June.\n\nWhile March is still a decent time to explore Sindh, Punjab and Lower KPK know that you should try to head north before April. Though technically still spring, April and May are often the hottest months of the year for most of the country.\n\nWhen is The Best Month to Visit Pakistan?\n\nNow that we’ve delved into Pakistan’s climate, let’s talk months.\n\nAfter spending well over a year in Pakistan and experiencing many of its climates, the reality is that there isn’t a single month that stands out as the best month to travel to PK.\n\nThe best month will depend a lot on what you want to see and do while in the country, so here’s a month-by-month breakdown to help you decide when to plan your trip for, including original photos that were actually taken in each month!\n\nJanuary in Pakistan\n\nJanuary is typically the coldest month of the year all throughout Pakistan. Even in Karachi, you won’t find temperatures exceeding 80 F, and a light jacket is a good idea everywhere.\n\nNevertheless, it’s a fantastic month to explore everything Punjab and Sindh have to offer with consistent pleasant weather and minimal humidity. If you’re looking to put your travel camera to use in urban centers, THIS is the time to do it!\n\nJanuary in Lahore is particularly unfavorable for exploring, as crop burning season makes the city’s air borderline unbreathable, plus it’s COLD. Islamabad typically hovers in the low 60s in January, making it a great time to travel to the city.\n\nUnless you particularly want to see snow in Pakistan, January is one of the worst months of the year to visit any of the country’s mountainous regions. While roads usually remain open, almost all hotels and homes lack central heating.\n\nFebruary in Pakistan\n\nFebruary is a bit warmer than January in Southern Pakistan, and is one of the best months of the year to enjoy Pakistan’s beaches.\n\nMajor cities like Islamabad, Lahore, and Peshawar will have warmed up a bit, but will still be comfortable to walk around in. It’s one of the only months you can check out all of the best restaurants in Lahore without needing an AC break.\n\nWhile winter will still have a firm grip on Northern Pakistan, you can find several local festivals taking place down south, like the Cholistan Jeep Rally.\n\nMarch in Pakistan\n\nA transition time for the country, March brings spring to frigid Gilgit Baltistan, and with it millions of spring flowers. Blossom season typically begins around March 15th, with many trees bearing apricots, an essential Hunza Valley food.\n\nWhile the beginning of March trends along “pleasant summer temperatures” in Pakistan’s major cities, blazing days in the 30s begin to make a resurgence as March moves along.\n\nMarch 23rd is an annual national celebration known as Pakistan Day, which marks the day the idea of Pakistan as a separate state came about.\n\nYou can also find numerous Sufi Urs festivals taking place at this time, particularly in Sindh and Punjab.\n\nApril in Pakistan\n\nApril marks a turn in Pakistan’s weather – the northern mountainous areas finally begin to thaw, while the entirety of Punjab and Sindh start to bake.\n\nUntil the middle of the month, many valleys in Gilgit Baltistan and Upper Chitral will still be filled with blossoms.\n\nAnd trust me, they’re worth planning a trip around! Hunza Valley’s sights seem just a bit more magical when blanketed in flowers.\n\nRain is common during April in the Northern Areas, but you can also experience the warmest and sunniest of days. Most treks and high-altitude road passes (like Babusar) will still be closed for general use.\n\nThe beginning of April should mark the end of any time spent in Southern Pakistan – temperatures settle in the high 90s and only go up from there.\n\nMay in Pakistan\n\nAhh May, the official beginning of Pakistan’s trekking season, and it’s overall a glorious time to start any Pakistan trip. Most schools are still in session, so you’ll be able to enjoy the mountains before the commercial trips fully begin.\n\nTemperatures in Northern Pakistan are typically sunny and around 70 degrees, though warmer or cooler days may occur. By the end of May, all motorable roads should be accessible, including the Babusar, Shandur, and Khunjerab Passes.\n\nFor the south, May usually means extreme and often record-breaking temperatures and heat waves. I had to spend a few days in Islamabad in May 2022, and it was literally 109 degrees.\n\nIn short, summer travel in Pakistan is all about the north’s incredible natural landmarks.\n\nJune in Pakistan\n\nAs far as tourism goes, June is one of the busiest months of the year for Northern Pakistan.\n\nTemperatures are well within the “summer” range, and the hiking and climbing season will have fully kicked off. Though many popular tourist destinations will be packed, it’s very easy to beat the crowds.\n\nFor example, June is perhaps the worst time of year to visit the ever-famous Fairy Meadows, but a perfect time to explore the raw and authentic Chapursan Valley.\n\nThe weather in mainland Pakistan’s cities will be truly unbearable throughout June. As the monsoon begins this month too, Karachi and other parts of Sindh and Balochistan have been known to experience severe rain and flooding.\n\nJuly in Pakistan\n\nJuly is the hottest month of the year in north Pakistan, with temperatures regularly exceeding 80 degrees.\n\nMany popular treks like the Shimshal Pass in Shimshal Valley and K2 Basecamp have their peak weather windows in July, and wildflowers are a common sight in almost any meadow.\n\nCamping will be at its most comfortable, and while still common, rain is less frequent in much of the Northern Areas.\n\nAugust in Pakistan\n\nVisiting Pakistan in August is unfortunately taking a gamble. The monsoon season finally reaches the Northern Areas, and can cause intense flooding and devastation. Rain in Pakistan is absolutely NO joke.\n\nIn August 2022, record-breaking monsoon rain in combination with melting glaciers wreaked havoc on the country. More than 33 million were displaced and many were killed. This effect was felt in EVERY province and territory, from Sindh to Gilgit Baltistan in varying degrees.\n\nThis doesn’t mean this will happen every year, but it’s definitely something to keep in mind when planning your Pakistan trip.\n\nAside from the monsoon, Pakistan’s cities will still be baking at around 40 C throughout August, as I experienced firsthand in 2019 when I spent the month in Lahore (rookie mistake).\n\nWhen it’s not raining, temperatures will be pleasant and warm throughout August up North. You’ll also find Independence Day celebrated all throughout the country on August 14th.\n\nSeptember in Pakistan\n\nSurprisingly, September just might be the best month to visit Northern Pakistan. Domestic commercial tourism slows significantly, and the vast majority of days are still warm and sunny.\n\nSeptember is also the last month to comfortably trek in the mountains, though nights will start to progressively get cooler as October approaches. Still, you can definitely get some solid high-altitude use out of your hiking backpack throughout the month!\n\nPersonally, the Septembers that I’ve spent traveling Pakistan have without question provided the most consistent sunny days. Towards the end of the month, you’ll be able to see some magical fall colors in Upper Hunza, parts of Skardu, and Upper Chitral.\n\nSeptember is still not a great time to explore the south-days still often exceed 100 degrees-though by the end of the month temperatures will get a bit comfier.\n\nOctober in Pakistan\n\nIf you love fall colors, then the best time to visit Pakistan is definitely in October. While it might be a bit chilly, the incredible foliage to be found all over Gilgit Baltistan is worth wearing an extra jacket for!\n\nNearly the entire GB territory experiences foliage in some shape or form, though I’m a bit partial to the magical regions of Central Hunza and Nagar.\n\nYou can also find incredible colors all over Skardu as well as in Phander, a bucolic village in the Ghizer District.\n\nOctober is also when you’ll find Pakistan’s major cities (Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi) finally become enjoyable from a temperature perspective, though the end of the month will be notably cooler than the beginning.\n\nThe Babusar Pass which is the best road connecting Gilgit Baltistan with the rest of Pakistan tends to close by mid-October. The longer Karakoram Highway route remains open for traffic year-round.\n\nNovember in Pakistan\n\nFoliage will be on display until roughly November 15th all throughout the northern areas, and temperatures will drop with the leaves.\n\nTemperatures regularly approach 0 degrees F at this time of year, though rest assured that plenty of extra winter gear is sold in local shops.\n\nMeanwhile, November is one of the best months of the year to visit South Pakistan. From Karachi to Peshawar, temperatures will be extremely pleasant and may even get a bit chilly at night as the month moves along.\n\nDecember in Pakistan\n\nDecember is one of the coolest months in Pakistan overall, but that just means it’s finally enjoyable in most of the country’s Southern areas.\n\nDecember is a fantastic time to explore Karachi, though you might even find it a bit chilly if you want to swim!\n\nIslamabad and Peshawar will be around 40-65 degrees during this month, as will Lahore.\n\nHowever, December is the WORST time to travel to Lahore as the entire city becomes choked with smog. Lahore is typically polluted but December is known as “burning season” when crops all over Punjab burn their harvested fields.\n\nThis typically puts pollution levels into an extremely hazardous zone – i.e API levels of 400-500 when 20-40 is optimal for health.\n\nThe Northern Areas will be extremely cold in December, and the vast, vast majority of hotels and homes do not have central indoor heating.\n\nFAQs About the Best Time to Travel to Pakistan\n\nA few questions people tend to ask about the best time to go to Pakistan:\n\nThe Best Time to Visit Pakistan: Final Thoughts!\n\nI hope you now have a better idea on when the best time to travel to Pakistan is! As I said earlier, the country’s complex climate can be summed up with: the summer is for the north and the winter is for the south!\n\nSo if you’re a mountain lover, plan your Pakistan trip between May-September (keeping in mind the August monsoon). And if you want to traipse around Pakistan’s historical sites in warm, humidity-free air? Book your tickets sometime between November-March.\n\nEven if you don’t get to visit in the ideal season, there’s no doubt you’re still in for the adventure of a lifetime. Hey, back in 2019 I fell in love with Pakistan and Lahore despite the August heat, after all."
