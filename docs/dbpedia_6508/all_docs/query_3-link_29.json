        "text": "Daniel Arrhakis - Visual Arts says:\n\nThe light of the Sun begins a new solar cycle at Winter Solstice. Winter Solstice 2022 in the Northern Hemisphere will be at 4:48pm Eastern Standard time and 10:47pm Central European time on Wednesday, December 21, marking the first day of winter.\n\nAt this time in the Northern Hemisphere we are experiencing the longest and darkest nights of the year and the shortest days with the least amount of daylight.\n\nn winter everything lies dormant in the silent earth, it is a sacred time of rest and reflection before the awakening and the slow build toward brighter days.\n\nThe energy of winter is that of going within. It's the fruitful darkness and silence out of which our soul's yearnings and new inspirations can eventually emerge.\n\nThe Winter season is characterized by several symbolic meanings all centered on cold, darkness, sadness, despair, dormancy, mystery, longing, loneliness but also survival, insight, resistance, contemplation, patience, hope and inner strength.\n\nWhile winter can be lonely and represent despair, it’s also the season before spring, a time of new beginnings, hope, joy.\n\nWinter is seen to symbolize a period of quiet reflection. This is the time to observe self – consciousness and ensure that your darkness does not overpower your growth potential. Winter is a period of self-reflection and preparation for new beginnings ahead.\n\nIn Norse mythology, a Yule or \"Juul\" log was burnt during the Winter Solstice in celebration of Thor the god of thunder. The Log was never allowed to burn completely and the ashes obtained from the burning were said give good luck, protect the people from lightning as well as bring fertility to the soil.\n\nAncient Celtic druids introduced the custom of hanging mistletoe in houses during the winter solstice. They believed that it had mystical powers which, if activated at that point in time, would bring love and good luck.\n\nItalian folklore tells of the famous winter witch called La Befana who flies around on her broom delivering presents to well-mannered children and giving coal to naughty children.\n\nJapanese mythology tells of the oshiroi baba, snow hags from the winter mountain who came down from mountains on very cold winters wearing tattered kimonos to bring reviving drinks to anyone in need of warmth.\n\nAncient Persians hold the festival of Yalda at the end of winter to celebrate the victory of light and darkness. This ceremony is characterized by the gathering of families, burning of candles, reading of poetry, and a feast of fruits.\n\nIn Northern Europe, the pagans believed the sun was a wheel that rolled away from the Earth during the winter, and decorated their homes with wheels festooned with greenery and lights to coax the sun back toward them during winter solstice. As they began to convert to Christianity, the wreaths took on new symbolism. The evergreens and unbroken circle reminded them of God's eternal love and the salvation that Jesus brought to the world.\n\nChristmas day is marked on the 25th of December which is within wintertime in the Northern hemisphere, an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\nWhile many different cultures have used evergreens to decorate during the long, cold winter, 16th-century Germany likely popularized the light-draped Christmas tree as we know it today. As the story goes, Martin Luther went walking in the woods one night and was struck by the beauty of the stars filtering through the evergreens. He cut one down, brought it home, and decorated it with candles to recreate the scene for his family. The idea spread, and now Christmas just wouldn't be the same without a tree.\n\nMany people top their Christmas trees with a shining star, and others incorporate the design into their decorations in other ways. The star may be one of the most directly biblical Christmas symbols that has made its way into even secular celebrations. It represents the star that appeared in the sky after Jesus was born, which then led the Three Wise Men to visit him in Bethlehem.\n\nIt also reminds Christians to follow Jesus like their own guiding light.\n\nHolly is another Christmas symbol - holly and berries\n\nWith its prickly leaves and red berries, the thorny plant reminds Christians of the crown of thorns that Jesus wore when he was crucified and the blood he shed during that event.\n\nThat may seem like a macabre reminder during a happy celebration, but the symbol has persisted throughout the ages. In fact, the word for holly in some Scandinavian languages even translates as \"Christ-thorn.\"\n\nChristmas Gifts another Christmas symbol - A picture of a wrapped Christmas gift\n\nThe Three Wise Men arrived with gifts for the baby Jesus: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. While we don't exchange quite the same presents in modern times, the spirit remains the same.\n\nCandles and fire are used in winter to symbolize the return of warmer and brighter days. The burning of candles and lighting of fire was originally practiced by Romans in the midwinter festival to celebrate their god Saturn but was later adopted by Christians who burn them during Advent and by Jews during Hanukkah.\n\nBut winter has also always been the season par excellence for telling fantastic and mysterious stories while enjoying the warmth of a fireplace. There are many Winter Solstice ghost stories and legends throughout History.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor of China made the Winter Solstice New Year Day. And then Yao Emperor, a legendary monarch in ancient China, ordered people to observe the activity of the sun specially.\n\nIn Finnish mythology, it’s told that Louhi, the “witch goddess of the North,” kidnapped the Sun and Moon and held them captive inside a mountain, causing the darkness of winter.\n\nThe Yupik peoples, indigenous to the Artic, tell the story of the Kogukhpak, subterranean monsters with bulbous bodies and frog-like legs who could only be killed by the sun. On the winter solstice, the Kogukhpak emerged to hunt and mammoth carcasses were said to be the corpses of the ones who stayed out too long and died when the sun returned.\n\nIn Greek Mythology, the Kallikantzaros were angry, hairy, gnome-like creatures who lived underground and tried to cut down the tree of life. Like the Kogukhpak, they could also be killed only by sunlight and emerged during the solstice to wreak havoc on homes and villages.\n\nDuring winter solstice, there were also stories about kinder beings, and a variety of gods and goddesses were worshipped, like Tonantzin in Mexico, Cailleach Bheru in Scotland, Horus in Egypt and Spider Grandmother by the Hopi.\n\nWinter solstice has also been known to celebrate Earth’s regeneration or rebirth, and the Scandinavian Goddess, Beiwe, is associated with health and fertility. It was believed that she travelled through the night sky in a structure made of reindeer bones with her daughter, Beiwe-Neia, to bring back the greenery on which the reindeer fed. For this reason she was worshipped during this time of year.\n\nWinter solstice is also a day that has been celebrated around the world for thousands of years in many different cultures. Some festivals include the Hopi Indian Festival of Soyal, the Polish celebration of Gody, Greece’s Brumalia celebration and the Hindu celebration of Makar Sankranti.\n\nTHE FEAST OF JUUL\n\nThis was a Pagan Scandinavian winter festival when Juul logs were burned and fires were lit to symbolize the heat and life-giving properties of the returning sun. It was believed that the yule log had the magical effect of helping the sun to shine more brightly.\n\nThe people who celebrated during this festival drank Meade around the bonfires while minstrel-poets sang of ancient legends.\n\nTHE FESTIVAL OF CHAOMOS (CHOIMUS)\n\nThe Festival of Chaomos was a Pakistani celebration in which a small number of Kalasha or Kalash Kafir people observed the ritual of baths as a part of a purification process.\n\nThere was also singing and chanting, dancing, bonfires, festive eating and a torchlight procession. This celebration lasted for at least 7 days and it is during this time the demi-god Balomain passed through the Kalash region. He is said to be collecting prayers as he goes and is worshipped during the festival.\n\nTHE DONGZHI FESTIVAL\n\nThis festival is a very important one for the Chinese and other East Asians. The Dongzhi Festival occurs on or around December 22 when the sun is at its weakest and the daylight is the shortest. This is the first day of the Dongzhi solar term.\n\nOrigins of this festival go back to the Yin and Yang philosophy of balance and harmony in the cosmos. With the hours of daylight increasing, there is an increase in positive energy flowing in.\n\nTraditionally this festival is a time for family gatherings. Families in southern China often make and eat Tangyuan (balls of glutinous rice) which symbolize reunion.\n\nSATURNALIA\n\nSaturnalia is an ancient Roman Pagan festival honoring Saturn, the god of agriculture and time. It started on December 17 and generally lasted 7 days.\n\nThis festival began with rituals and sacrifices at the Temple of Saturn at the end of which the crowd was dismissed with the cry of “Io, Saturnalia!,” a sign for the happy festivities of family parties and other private gatherings to begin.\n\nDuring this week of celebration, all work and business came to a halt. Schools and courts of law were closed, the army rested and no criminals were executed.\n\nInstead of all of that, Romans spent Saturnalia gambling, singing, playing music, feasting, socializing and giving gifts to one another. It was a time of role reversal where Roman masters feasted with slaves who were given the freedom to do and say what they liked.\n\nThe list of winter festivals and traditions is long, as well as the legends of world folklore, to which many stories of world literature are added that chose Winter as the setting for characters and legends, such as the famous Christmas Tales from Charles Dickens, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight from anonymous (late 14th century), Snegurochka, the Russian Snow Maiden, fairy tale from Alexander Afanasyev, Mary Foster’s 1901 book ‘Asgard Stories: Tales from Norse Mythology’, \"The Snow Queen\" (Danish: Snedronningen) an original fairy tale by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, etc...\n\nUsing your own photographies, compositions or stock images, we are sure that you will surprise us with your unique creations of Winter Mysteries! : )\n\nWe accept Photography, Art Photography with or without manipulation but must respect the main theme !\n\nIn the case of using stock images, in addition to providing the link, they must show obvious manipulation, editing or transformation, otherwise they will be refused.\n\nBe creative and have fun dear friends !! : )\n\nRules:\n\n1) You must be a member of this group.\n\n2) This contest will be open from December 5 to 31 of 2022.\n\nContest winners will be featured on the about page of the Mystic Challenge Group.\n\n3) You must vote to win .
