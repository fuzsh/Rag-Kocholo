        "text": "Ratha Saptami also known as Achala/Magha Saptami Falls on the seventh day of the bright half of the lunar month, Magha Maasa. This day is dedicated to Lord Suryanarayan. This festival is celebrated by the Hindus across India. The Sun begins its journey towards the northern hemisphere ( Uttarayan ) which according to Hindu astrological reckoning is called Makara Sankranti. After the culmination into Capricorn ,the sun starts gaining momentum on the seventh day. This celestial movement is known as Uttaryan and also as ‘Brahma Marga’ .This day is considered to be very auspicious and divine.\n\nThe Spiritual Insight and True Meaning of Ratha Saptami : Ratha means Chariot and is also symbolic of ‘Our Mind’. Our mind always wanders in different directions with innumerable thoughts just like different horses , so inorder to progress and attain peace, The Ratha should be pulled/ channelised towards ‘right direction’. All the right set of horses should pull in the right direction.\n\nIt is believed that Surya was born on this day to Sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, Arghyadana is offered to Sun God today which is offering water from a small Kalash in Namaskar Mudrav by chanting 12 diffferent names of Surya, Also worshipping Surya or Sun God today will bring you longevity, good health and success.Sweets made out of sesame seeds are offered to Surya as Naivedyam.\n\nHaldi kumkum is the most important part of this Festival for married women. Women organise Haldi kumkum sessions right from Makar Sankranti to this day of Ratha Saptami as per their convenience. Married women adorn themselves in Black Saree,exchange Haldi kumkum, scented flowers, betel leaves, Til Gul vadi ( Sesame seeds and also distribute utility gifts known as ‘vaan’ to other women in family and friends. (This year we are distributing rice & lentil mixture as vaan )"
