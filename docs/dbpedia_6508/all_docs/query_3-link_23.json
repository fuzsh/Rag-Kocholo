        "text": "The Moon is staring upon me like a frenzied lover, stars blush as the rose blooms in the cheek of a young fair maiden. The night is ticking by- tick tock tick tock- but sleep is far away from these swollen eyes.\n\nMy beginner’s mind is like the brook drinking in its first drop from the dew of Grace which falls eternally from heaven. It often runs ever forward towards the One Ocean, seeking and spilling, meandering along over rocks and down falls ever searching for the why and how of This Path. This time it is the rise of spring, the arrival of the journey’s naissance. The Message is in celebration of Diversity and Hope with a tinge of fullness in the lips of a lover showing that radiant face to me. There, in this rapt stillness, breathing down the stars with many young faces twinkling back to the Earth Mother I feel alive to be so included in this sacred dance. The fecund soil beneath my very feet breathes new life and life abundantly lifting me from earth to heaven and back again. For in this auspicious time when the Eternal Sun awakens all of nature around, under and through me, I stretch and throw off the cloak of winters work now completed and the Circle starts again.\n\nIn the mountains of Chitral, where I grew up, spring is usually overwhelming. A long chilly winter locally called ” Chillah” turns the whole valley grey with the chill of winter’s bone. At its depths when this dreary season wipes the mountains bare, hope is abandoned as the rays of the sun grow ever fainter in the shadows of the valley floor.\n\nYet when spring returns each year, with it comes Hope painting wide swathes across the valley in lush strokes of her paint brush, creating yet again, another canvas of Divine Reality. With this new landscape, the smell of spring is on the air, with every plant and animal and person beaming with new found awareness. The wind, once harsh and corrosive, now caresses each growing radiant molecule of life.\n\nWith the kiss of Spring not only in Chitral but the entire northern hemisphere of earth is awash in many shades and colors. The azure sky above is filled with sparkling wine sharing its dew with the meadow washed with its Divine Glance. The flowers, eyes open, the willow tree is clothed once again, hence winter bows to spring like an elephant to a king. The birds migrate to fill the sky with a tapestry of undulating color and shapes. Bees and other insects awaken from hibernation to extract pollen in every pregnant flower to sow for future generations. Looking around, it appears that the entirety of nature has returned to rejoice in unison singing “Celebrate” to all who have ears to hear this Divine Symphony in all its names, shapes and forms seen and unseen to the world.\n\nThe sheer breathtaking beauty of spring is now enjoyed by the entire Universe, bringing the reign of Unity once again. There are signs for those with eyes which can see within this divine tapestry, asNasir Khusraw alludes to in verse “If you are not in need of the proof, the proof is not in need of you”.\n\nSpring comes with the message of diversity and hope; it reminds us to celebrate and “raise us above the distinctions and differences which divide” (HIK); also to appreciate the colors, to rejoice in the strength and vitality felt all around, with flower blooms to shadow out the weakness of barren fields, weeds and darkness.\n\nI’m only student of the Cosmos, my eyes just started hatching out from the egg of breath brining Light to spheres of darkness and deception, I might be wrong, a so called genius. What have you done to the world and what enriches others to learn of this new found diversity as taught by the natural world? Didn’t you know that you are the vicegerent of Allah to spread your heart strings far and wide” no wider than the heart is wide??”\n\nO you Mullah/Rabbi/Priest- what have you done to the people of the earth except barking at them? Your force is supplication to your ego self, not the will of Allah The One.\n\nNow where should we seek thou hand O Allah?? A mixture of tulips, roses, daffodils and sun flower-all blend their colors with each other to give glory and a living, shining example of Your radiant face? But many humans bowing to their lower selves and lost the seed of the Soul- the direction of the blessed tree from where the oil lights the lamp of understanding.\n\nAccording to a key verse in the Holy Quran- this is the one important aspect of the purpose of human diversity:\n\n” O mankind, We have created you male and female, and We have made you into tribes and nations in order that you might come to know one another”- Al Hujurat ( 49:13)\n\nWe need to know that the real peace comes from accepting ” diversity as a source of nourishment rather than burden” (Imam Shah Karim al Husayni). Allah (SWT) does see colours. We need to understand that it was the idea of the Creator for the world to be a colourful place. So instead of being divided because of cast, creed and colours, we need to celebrate it like flowers. But first let’s seek out the very direction of the blessed tree for a continues guidance.\n\nIn service to the Real,\n\nNooruddin Jalal\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nRate this:\n\nCross posted from Sadaf Arshad’s blog\n\nAn honest answer to one simple question about your identity as a Pakistani or a Muslim explains the roots of extremism and an increasing intolerance among this society. I was asked this question many years ago, and my answer was not logical rather an abrupt and sudden gush of emotions. I said I am a Muslim first. The later years have weakened or killed that emotion and today I would like to answer in a different way.\n\nThe white patch in Pakistan’s flag which seems evaporating now, determines the answer. We are Pakistani first is a simple answer to this white patch. The difference in views of majority is stark. Majority now dreams of a homeland only for Muslims and the survival for rest depends on their submission to majority’s religion.\n\nA few months ago, my friend Saad Sarfraz Sheikh, went to Kalash, a beautiful valley in the northwest of Pakistan, to capture its exotic beauty and rich culture. A tiny tribe of total 4,500 people, which cannot be a considerate share of the total 180 million Pakistanis, is about to be nonexistent. He returned with breathtaking pictures, but seemed perturbed. In the middle of the Kalash fairytale, he mentioned his visit to a school which did not have pupils for some unknown and known reasons. The school’s timetable shows a class of Islamic studies for the students who do not believe in Islam. How would Muslims feel if they are forced to attend a class on Christianity? In my view, they will be marching on roads, burning tyres and property, and calling it a threat to Islam and a Jewish conspiracy against Muslims. My friend mentioned that how tremendously Kalash has changed due to the extremist elements forcing the people to convert to Islam. Some radical Muslims, bound to spread Islam by force, began building mosques in the valley for Kalashs, who claim descent from Alexander the Great’s army.\n\nThe valley runs along the border of Afghanistan and for centuries, they sacrificed animals and practiced polytheism without any interference from the Muslim community.\n\nSo what has changed now? The youth of this country, mainly inspired by Jihad against then Soviet Union, have grown up brandishing radicalized version of Islam. The concept of coexistence is at stake in this country, which has minimized the chances of survival for our minorities. Now the question arises that can all flee from this country in sheer despair and frustration? Will this country have space only for a particular sect of Islam? But we need to ask ourselves if we are humans or Pakistanis first or Muslims later? If the answer is Pakistanis first, I see hope.\n\nReuters Story:\n\nNestled among the valleys of Pakistan’s mountainous northwest, a tiny religious community that claims descent from Alexander the Great’s army is under increasing pressure from radicals bent on converting them to Islam.\n\nThe Kalash , who number just about 3,500 in Pakistan’s population of 180 million, are spread over three valleys along the border with Afghanistan. For centuries they practiced polytheism and animal sacrifice without interference from members of Pakistan’s Muslim majority.\n\nBut now they are under increasing danger from proselytizing Muslim militants just across the border, and a hardline interpretation of Islam creeping through mainstream society — as Pook Shireen discovered.\n\nAfter falling unconscious during a car accident , the mid-20s member of the paramilitary Chitral Scouts woke to find that people with him had converted him to Islam.\n\n“Some of the Muslim people here try to influence the Kalash or encourage them by reading certain verses to them from the Koran,” said his mother, Shingerai Bibi.\n\n“The men that were with him read verses of the Koran and then when he woke up they said to him, ‘You are a convert now to Islam’. So he converted.”\n\nThe conversion was a shock for his family. But they were lucky compared with other religious minorities under threat from growing religious conservatism that is destabilizing Pakistan, a nuclear-armed U.S. ally.\n\nIn May 2010, more than 80 Ahmadis, a minority who consider themselves Muslims but are regarded by Pakistan as non-Muslim, were killed in attacks on two mosques in Lahore.\n\nThen in March this year, the Christian minorities minister, Shahbaz Bhatti, whose job it was to protect groups like the Kalash, was assassinated outside his home in the capital, Islamabad, in an attack claimed by the Pakistani Taliban.\n\nSMOOTH CO-EXISTENCE\n\nThe lush green Kalash valleys, which sit below snow-capped peaks of the Hindu Kush, have been a magnet for tourists, both for the scenery and for the people, who are indigenous to the area.\n\nMost are fair and with light eyes, which they say proves their descent from the army of Alexander of Macedonia that passed through the area in the 4th century BC to invade India. The community brews its own wine and women are not veiled.\n\nBut the smooth co-existence between the Kalash and Muslims has been fading in recent months and the area is suffering from many of the religious tensions marring the rest of Pakistan.\n\nThe conversions are causing splits among the Kalash — converts become outcasts overnight, described by many as “dead to their families”.\n\n“When a Kalash converts we don’t live with them in our houses anymore,” said farmer Asil Khan, sitting on a neighbor’s balcony.\n\n“Our festivals and our culture are different. They can’t take part in the festivals or the way we live.”\n\nSome in the area are so concerned that they believe segregation is the only way to protect the Kalash.\n\n“We should move the Muslims out of the valley to make more room for the Kalash,” said Shohor Gul, a Kalash member of the border police who lives in Rumbur valley. “This area should be just for us. We dislike these conversions – it disturbs our culture and our festivals, and it reduces our numbers.”\n\nThe subject of Kalash festivals is raised often in these narrow valleys, where carefully cultivated corn crops cover what flat land exists, and the Kalash community’s distinctive wooden houses terrace the valley walls.\n\nHeld to usher in seasonal change or to pray for a good harvest, Kalash festivals include hypnotic dancing and animal sacrifice, fueled by the grape wine with which the Kalash lace their gatherings.\n\nConverts to Islam say, though, that these rituals quicken the decision to leave the Kalash.\n\n“The main thing wrong in the Kalash culture are these festivals,” said 29-year-old convert Rehmat Zar. “When someone dies the body is kept in that house for three days.”\n\nMuslims usually bury people the day they die.\n\nZar added of the Kalash: “They slaughter up to a hundred goats and the family are mourning – but those around them are celebrating, beating drums, drinking wine and dancing. Why are they celebrating this? That’s wrong.”\n\nNOT ALL MUSLIMS\n\nNot all of the area’s Muslims feel this way.\n\nQari Barhatullah is the imam, or priest, at the Jami Masjid in Bumboret valley’s Shikanandeh village.\n\nHe stresses that many of the valley’s Muslims value the Kalash’s contributions to the area’s tourism industry and contends that Kalash festivals run parallel to their own.\n\nHe admits though that there is tension between the two communities. Unveiled Kalash girls in colorful homemade skirts and head-dresses grow up alongside Muslim women covered by the all-enveloping burqas.\n\nThe Kalash girls are also free to marry who they chose, in a country where arranged marriages are common.\n\n“We do support the Kalash – Islam teaches us respect for other religions – but there are people here, maybe they are not as educated – who don’t like the Kalash because of their religion,” Barhatullah said.\n\nAkram Hussain oversees the Kalasha Dur, a cultural center devoted to promoting and protecting the Kalash culture, a stunning structure of elegantly crafted carved wooden beams and stone where Kalash children are educated. It also houses a library, clinic and museum, which are open to both the Kalash and Muslim communities.\n\n“Some of the Muslims here don’t want to educate the Kalash people. They don’t want us to have an education,” he said.\n\nWithout more schools that cater exclusively to the Kalash, though, Hussain worries his community and culture will be disappear.\n\n“There are few Kalash teachers and there aren’t schools for older children, so they go to the secondary schools and learn about Islam. The Muslim teachers are brainwashing them. They tell the children that Islam is the only right way and that we are going to hell,” he said.\n\nA provincial spokesman said the regional government is funding development projects for the Kalash and that Pakistan was committed to protecting their unique heritage.\n\n“We have set aside 15 million rupees ($173,210) over three years for projects such as improving roads, water supply systems and community centers,” said Ahmad Hassan. “Whatever the Kalash say they need.”\n\nOthers in the Kalash valleys though say development should cease and insist the adoption of Islam should continue, despite the impact on the Kalash culture.\n\nRehmat Zar, the Kalash convert, says his eventual aim is to convert his entire community to Islam.\n\n“I’m trying my best to convert many of the Kalash myself. I’m trying to convert as many as I can,” he said.\n\n“The people who are trying to preserve the Kalash culture are doing wrong. They are committing a mistake. The Kalash should convert to Islam because this is the real, and last, religion”. ($1 = 86.600 Pakistani rupees)\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nRate this:\n\n(He who seeks- shall find)- Sufi Proverb\n\nThe area of Badakhshan (Eastern Afghanistan, Southern Tajikistan and Northern Pakistan) is blessed with the highest mountain peaks: Lenin Peak, Tirichmir Peak, Pamir Peaks and so on but there is no Mountain high enough to praise Nasir khusraw’s personality, even writers find themselves dumb whilst praising him. Ocean too before his great wisdom shrinks into a single drop; his words are lamp of enlightenment for the heart. It’s hardly possible in such a brief introduction to deal with the facts of Khusraw’s thoughts as he deserves to be discussed, to be loved and to be infused in today’s knowledge society. His poetry is full of wisdom, of reason, of the right meaning and the right faith.\n\nNasir Khusraw famously known as “The Ruby Of Badakhshan,” and was born in Khurasan 1004 C.E. He ranked among the greatest mystic of Persia and was the early link in the chain of meta physical poetry, which was continued later by such figures as Rumi, Attar, Sa’di and Hafiz. Unlike others he was also a master of the science of the time and was a preacher of philosophical wisdom but unfortunately we have not given high accolade to this mystic poet in our school of thoughts.\n\nA Sufi proverb: “One who seeks shall find”- Nasir Khusraw’s wandering ceased after his search for wisdom amongst all school of thoughts culminated in his meeting with the Imam of the time Mustansir Bil’lah (a.s) the 18th Imam of Shi’a Ismaili Muslims and 8th Fatimid Caliph who ruled from (1035-1094) in Cairo Egypt. The meeting was similar as Rumi’s to Shams. The era of Fatimid’s was the golden era of inventions, scholars, thinkers, philosophers and scientists.\n\nIn praise of Fatimid’s He says:\n\n“The sun shines forth, like Fatimid’s as it ascends the slope from its winter exile, It’s rays as bright as Zulfiqar (Sword Of Ali) giving vigor to the rose as to the pearl-white steed of Ali “\n\nHe pours out his devotional songs to the Beloved of the time as Nightingale to the Rose. His poetry is based on intellect, which distinguishes human being from other animals. He enforces us to contemplate and to comprehend the manifestation of God through intellect and search.\n\n“The world is a deep ocean, its water is time;\n\nYour body is like a shell, your soul the pearl.\n\nIf you wish to have the value of a pearl,\n\nRaise up the pearl of your soul by learning.”\n\nAnd\n\n“What did God give us alone of all the other creatures?\n\nThe intellect, by which we lord o’er all the beasts.\n\nBut note, that virtue and intellect which makes us lords of donkeys,\n\nAre the very same trait which binds us as slaves of the Lord\n\nWith intellect, we can seek out all the hows and whys,\n\nWithout it, we are but trees without fruit.”\n\nHis teaching was not well received in his native land ‘Balkh’. His opponents incited a mob to sack his house and even attempted to assassinate him. Finding his native land uncomfortable he fled to remote valley of ‘Yamgan- now eastern part of Afganistan.\n\n“The wise man wastes no words on a horde of idiots-\n\nThey call me ‘unorthodox’-bah!-\n\nWhat do they know of Islam except the name? “\n\nDivan-e Khusraw is full of wisdom, each time when I open the Divan, it blossoms. Perhaps it is my intense curiosity and restless wandering heart that have instilled love of Khusraw’s theology. During the study of his Divan I acquired an almost physical picture of him and if I’m questioned, how Khusraw influenced me? Almost every time when I hear his Qasidas( devotional songs) I can imagine him singing and dancing to praise and please the beloved in the valley of Yamgan.\n\nNasir says:\n\n“O Beloved! When I proclaim your name\n\nRoses spring up from your blessings\n\nWhen your servant speaks your name\n\nThe vale of Yamgan feels with dancing stars”.\n\nFariduddin Attar wrote a six-line poem entitled, “The Tale of Nasir Khusraw and His Seclusion”\n\nThe cry of Nasir Khusraw when he dwelt in Yumgan,\n\nArched even past heaven’s nine-storied vault,\n\nA little corner he took to hide himself away\n\nHearing the Prophet himself had named that very spot,\n\nNot a man to enter into the fighting fields of dogs,\n\nLike a Ruby in Badakhshan he hid himself away\n\nMid the hidden hearts of mountain he chose the corner of Yumgan,\n\nSo as not to have to look upon the horrid faces of his foes,\n\nNow I, too, like that great Prince have found a little corner for myself,\n\nSince in the search for deeper meaning\n\nHe provided the provisions.\n\nKhusraw’s poetry reflects his rejection of orthodox hold of Mullahs over Islam. One consistent theme is his scorn for hypocritical religious leaders:\n\nFrom pulpit-tops they preach to the common folk,\n\nDazzling them about paradise and the food to be had there.\n\nThey crow and cry in hope of food;\n\nAsses always bray when you speak of barley.\n\nAnd\n\nBy day you fast and moan and finger your rosary,\n\nBy night you’re enjoying music and wine.\n\nYou’ve memorized the Book of con quite smoothly,\n\nSo now you’re grand mufti of Balkh, Nishapur and Herat.\n\nYour words are very heavy with fruits as a date palm\n\nBut when it comes to action your thorn appear.”\n\nIn the poems, he asks, if those who pledged their allegiance to Muhammad are assured a place in heaven, what is the justice for those who live at a later time, to whom should they stretch out their hand? He asks, have you not heard to whom Prophet entrusted his dominion of the sermon by the ditch? The one before whose courage the boldness of unbelievers faded like lantern held up to Sun?\n\nIn Praise of Ahle-Bait (Progeny of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) he says:\n\n“I choose the friendship of Ali, whose swords brings dark nights to his foes bright day to his partisans. Light is far superior to a smoke, even if both come from fire. Black smoke may arise high as clouds but gives no rain. Not every child whose father called him Noah owns an ark to ride out the Flood- Only prophet family has the power to decipher.”\n\nCommenting on Nasir Khusraw Imam Shāh Karīm al-Ḥusaynī (a.s) -The 49th Imam of Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims said at the inauguration ceremony of Ismaili Center Dushanbe Tajikistan.\n\nThe passage of a millennium has not diminished Nasir Khusraw’s relevance nor dulled the lustre of his poetry. It continues to uplift and inspire, reminding us that we are the authors of our own destiny. As he has said, we can be like a poplar tree which chooses to remain barren, or we can let our path be lit by the candle of wisdom, for only ‘with intellect, we can seek out all the hows and whys. Without it, we are but trees without fruit’.\n\nFor more on Khusraw’s poetry:\n\nhttps://nooruddinjalal.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/i-choose-the-deen-of-muhammad-by-hakim-nasir-khisraw/\n\n(http://www.amaana.org/khusraw/khusrawali.htm)\n\nhttp://www.amaana.org/ISWEB/ismpoet2.htm\n\nToday’s knowledge society needs someone like Khusraw to lit the fire of reason and to show the true spirit of Islam. We have to reclaim Khusraw and introduce the rich, plural heritage of Islam to the world. This age is the time for exploration of truth and confusion. Pick up guns and spread the message of Islam was never a motive of Muslims, Islam spread by the message of love by deeds, by the weight of the inks not the way Talibans enforce it or the ones who sees everything through blurred lens-practicing it.\n\nIn service to the Real\n\nNooruddin Jalal\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nRate this:\n\nNaw’roz comes when spring blossoms on Earth, when the trees are crowned with leaves, when you hear the nightingale pour out its song for the rose, when the orchards hang out its lanterns. It is a season to celebrate, to enjoy and an expression of elation for body’s soul. To experience this magnificent beauty of nature my soul goes on dancing and my thoughts turn towards Him who creates everything. You may not perceive Him but you can feel His presence there on the lips of the rose or in the song of the Nightingale- chanting out loudly “He is here, He is here”.\n\nNaw’roz or Navroz is a Persian word which means “New Day”/ “New Light”. It is the first day of Persian calendar which falls on 21st March of each year. The history of Nav’roz goes back to many hundreds of years ago. It is believed by some that it was the day of Nav’roz when Hazrat Adam(a.s) was bestowed with the soul. It was the day of Nav’roz when Hazrat Abrahim(a.s) destroyed the idols. It was the day of Nav’roz when Hazrat Noah (a.s)’s Ark got rescued. It was the day of Nav’roz when Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) received the first revelation. It was the day of Navroz when Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) revealed the final message at Ghadir-e-Khum.-(Imam Jafar Sadiq -6th Imam of Shia Muslims quoted in Bilhar al-Anwar). Further the significance of the day is also explained in many poems of Shams Tabriz (mentor and master of Rumi) which is also followed by his students in the now famous Mathnawi. Scholars, philosophers from different schools of thoughts have also penned down the beauty of Nav’roz on various stages.\n\nEvery community celebrates Nav’roz in their own unique ways. It is celebrated in various parts of the world. In Pakistan, it is celebrated by Shia school of thoughts particularly by Ismailis. I grew up in a very beautiful valley of Pakistan-Chitral, where inhabitants greet this festival with wild jubilation. The green season all around the landscape makes the village a true fairyland. Birds sing in spring, brightly colored flowers sprout up everywhere and give different look to the valley.\n\n(A Family is Celebrating Nav’roz in Tajikistan)\n\nNav’roz in local tongue called “Pathak” being the famous festival of Chitral among the Ismaili Muslims marks the arrival of spring. It is worth seeing and experiencing the day in Chitral especially the way the rituals are being carried out. I remember some memories of my childhood. At around dawn people clean their houses and get ready for the new day. They wear new clothes and visit each other’s homes to share the happiness. They believe that whatever they do on the first day will influence the rest of their year. The traditional foods of Chitral are must of the day to serve the guests. Boys and girls in separate groups go to each other’s homes to greet one another. Upon the arrival of the guests the host family members greet them in traditional way. A pinch of flour is showered on the right shoulder of the guests as mark of respect. Various games are also organized on this day.\n\nAnother reason to celebrate this season is to mark the successful conclusion of Sufi/Pir Nasir Khusraw’s 40 days of meditation. Khusraw was a Fatimid era Ismaili dai (mystic),poet and philosopher who was the first Sufi to seed Islam in Central Asia, Afghanistan and in north of Pakistan. With a little inquiry I’m honoured to come to understand the historically “Pathak” (Nav’roz) used to be common Chitrali festival celebrated as seed sowing ritual. Since 1980s when Gen. Zia ul Haq started sowing the seeds of terrorism and sectarianism; the festival became exclusively Ismaili. Pathak still remains a binding source among the Chitrali community. Let’s celebrate nav’roz day with the same jubilation as we used to before!\n\nE’ed Nav’roz (Nishat Afroz) Mubarak to all of you. ” Boombarako Boshad”\n\nNooruddin Jalal\n\nIt has been published in\n\nThe AsianUK\n\nAalmiakhbar\n\nChitral News\n\nChitral Today\n\nChitral Times\n\nand in Ismaili Mail.\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nRate this:\n\nChitral, the mythical landscape, one of the most natural famous wonders of Pakistan and one of the world’s most beautiful valley, lying in the midst of Hindukush Range. The land of fairytales is blessed naturally with luxuriantly green orchards, streams full of dancing waters, roaring rivers and meadows stretching in the quietude like that of heavens at a height which is unique feature of Chitral.\n\nThe blue of sky, the emerald of flora and the turquoise of water add to the palette, nature has used to paint this landscape full of mountains, trees and flowers with a divine composition of colors and the brightness of the rising sun, worshiped by the whiteness of the snow which, on some peaks, have never melted for millions of years.\n\nPhoto courtesy: VOI “Mastuj- Chitral”\n\nSpring in chitral has a myriad of coleus, shapes and hues. It is a season to enjoy, celebrate and experience the height of delight , an expression of elation for your body and soul. Birds sing in spring, plants ornate with new leaves, brightly colored flowers sprout up every where. This is a scene which can’t be described in words; it’s a scene which must be experienced.\n\nChitral lost its royal status in 1969 and joined Pakistan. General Yahya Khan made it a settled district of the newly created Malakand Division of Khyber Pukhtunkhaw. The valley also enjoys the neighborhood of China and Tajikistan to the north and Afghanistan to the northwest and surrounded by gigantic mountains. The terrain is full of variety peaks with diversity in the heights such as the world-famous Terich Mirr (7,708m) peak is one of them which, against the calm blue sky, shimmers to the maximum and creates an illusion to captivate the eye up to a level where time seems to be stopping for ever.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Afzal Aman (Terich Mirr view)\n\nThe valley has seen invasions of the horse ridden Greeks, the Persians , the British, and sturdy Afghans and many other hordes of attackers including the Muslims. Having seen and experienced many invaders, the Chitralvadis through their spirit never allowed the other dynasty to fully sway over their affairs, which is why the loam of this area has engrossed the aroma of different civilizations and the culture of various bordering nations but retained its distinct identity.\n\nThe people of Chitral, show traces of Persian and Turkish ancestry. They are known for their peaceful, uncomplicated character and unique cultural. It’s the place of simple trustworthy people whose friendship remains with visitor for a long time. They have no greed ,they respect their guests and despise cheating anyone. Chitral is more famous, however, for the Kalash people who inhabit the southwestern part of the region. There is a common belief that the people of Kalash are descendants of the soldiers from Alexander’s army, a belief which is subject to reservations by many scholars. The Kalash are colorful and fun loving people who love music and dancing.\n\nPolo, the “Game Of Kings” played here by skillful, daring participants which is held every year in July. Chitral has the highest Polo ground in the world “The Shandur Polo Ground” which is (4,000 meters) above sea level. There is a clear joy in watching Polo Game in the fresh air and high altitude; the atmosphere produce a marked change from the crowded cities.\n\nMusic and dance have flourished for millennia. Cultural music i.e. folksongs, folkdances, music of reed instrument and that of pure Chitrali Sitar makes the person lost in wonderland. The Peaks of Chitral appears intoxicated by taking heed to Chitrali Dhool.\n\n( Your comment is vital. Do not underestimate the power of your comment).\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nRate this:"
