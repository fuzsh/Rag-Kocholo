        "text": "The latitude longitude distance calculator will help you calculate the distance between two points on Earth's surface given their latitude/longitude coordinates.\n\nWith this tool, you can:\n\nFind the distance between two latitudes;\n\nFind the distance between coordinates; or\n\nObtain the distance between two points on Earth.\n\nWe will explain everything there is to know about using latitude/longitude to obtain the distance between two coordinates using the haversine formula or haversine distance.\n\nKeep reading to learn more!\n\nFirst of all, we need to properly explain what the latitude and longitude coordinates mean.\n\nLatitude, measured in degrees °, is the angle between a point on Earth and the Equator. Earth's Equator is an imaginary line which divides the planet horizontally exactly halfway between the South and North pole.\n\nThat way, a point's latitude coordinate must have a value between -90° (towards the South pole) and 90° (towards the North pole), with the zero coordinate being precisely on the equator line.\n\nLongitude, on the other hand, is the angle between a point and an arbitrary, imaginary line, called the prime meridian, which divides Earth vertically.\n\nThe prime meridian goes near the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London and acts as the zero longitude. This coordinate must lay between -180° (west of the prime meridian) and 180° (east of the prime meridian).\n\nCoordinates and heading\n\nAny coordinate pair will be expressed in the form of (latitude, longitude). Sometimes, coordinates are also represented using only positive degrees and a letter to indicate the orientation (E, W, N, S). To convert these to a number-only format, we just need to add a minus (-) sign if the orientation is west or south (you can read more about converting coordinates with our coordinates converter calculator).\n\nSo, for example, the Empire State building coordinates are: (40.7484°, -73.9857°), which means this famous place is located 40.7484° up north from the Equator (since it's a positive number), and -73.9857° west from the prime meridian (since this longitude is negative)."
