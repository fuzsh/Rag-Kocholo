        "text": "The Mobile Ad ID or Device ID is a unique 36-character identifier of smartphones. Mobile Ad IDs helps to identify, track and differentiate between mobile devices.\n\nThe Mobile Ad ID/Device ID is widely used across the marketing ecosystem, especially for targeting devices with ads through demand-side platforms (DSPs) and supply-side platforms (SSPs) in the app advertising supply chain.\n\nFor iOS devices the unique device ID is called Identifier For Advertising (IDFA). Apple customers can receive their mobile device ID numbers through iTunes or the Apple App Store. Before the rollout of iOS 6, this device ID was called a Unique Device Identifier (UDID) in the Apple ecosystem.\n\nFor Android devices the device ID is called Google Advertising ID (GAID). These mobile device IDs are randomly generated during the first activation of a mobile device and remain constant for the lifetime of the device unless reset by the user. Typically the IDs belonging to iOS devices will be in upper-case and those belonging to Android devices will be in lower-case.\n\nAs they are a unique identifier, they can be used to calculate aggregated metrics such as Daily Active Users (DAU), Monthly Active Users (MAU), etc. To learn more about the different queries you can run using the device ID please visit our Resources library.\n\nIn summary, if you were to conduct an experiment where you measure the location of a device over time, these two scenarios would describe the difference:\n\nScenario 1:\n\nHigh precision means you have low standard deviation from the mean of the distribution (seen on the second and fourth pictures).\n\nFor example, the points are measured a small distance apart from each other (all around the Empire State Building, 34th St). The true location of the device may be relatively far away from these points (Chrysler Building, 405 Lexington Ave). However, there is still high precision here because the points are all measured close to each other but low accuracy because they are far off from the true position of the device.\n\nScenario 2:\n\nHigh accuracy means that the points you collected are closer to the true location of the device (seen on the third and fourth pictures).\n\nFor example, the points are measured close to the true position of the device (Chrysler Building, 405 Lexington Ave), but are not necessarily close to each other (some points recorded at Grand Central Terminal and others at The Westin New York Grand Central, 212 E 42nd St). The precision of these points would be lower compared to the first scenario, but the accuracy would be higher because The Westin and Grand Central Terminal lie closer to the Chrysler building which is the true location of the device."
