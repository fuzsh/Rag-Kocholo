        "text": "Northern Pakistani maternal gene pool experienced substantial contributions from western Eurasians\n\nBased on the obtained mitogenome information, all 213 IE speakers in northern Pakistan could be allocated into haplogroups derived from non-African lineages M, N, and R. Most individuals in northern Pakistan (66.19%, 141/213) were affiliated to haplogroups HV, JT, and U (Table S8), which are reported to be prevalent in west Eurasians [40–42], at a much higher rate than that of other South Asian populations (24.9%) based on the 1KGP [27], Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) [43], and Bengali population data [13]. The distribution of unique diagnostic motifs of the haplogroups defined in our study is shared across Eurasia; however, some substitutions were more frequent in South Asians (Table S4), implying the consistent presence and de novo origination of these lineages in north Pakistan after differentiation from western Eurasian counterparts.\n\nTo further investigate the genetic relationship between the northern Pakistani populations and surroundings, a total of 19,757 samples from 294 population studies were analyzed covering IE and other language family-speaking populations from northern Pakistan and its surroundings, including Europe, the Middle East and Caucasus, Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia (Fig. ). The PCA plot based on haplogroup frequencies showed a general differentiation in IE-speaking populations between South Asia and Europe, with South Asian IE speakers distributed together with the Dravidians (Figs. and S1), consistent with the genetic admixture of these two linguistic groups observed in previous studies [14]. Haplogroups ubiquitous in present-day west Eurasians (e.g., mainly the descendants of haplogroups HV and JT) contributed most to PC1, whereas haplogroups prevalent in South Asia contributed to PC2 (Fig. ). The association of the western Eurasian components with present-day South Asians is further supported by the correspondence analysis (Fig. S2). Moreover, some components, e.g., U5a sub-haplogroups that were prevalent in the Steppe during the Bronze Age [10], also contributed to PC2, implying potential genetic contributions from the Steppe into South Asia, including northern Pakistan.\n\nIn comparison to IE speakers in India, populations residing in the northwestern regions of the subcontinent, including the Kho and Pashtuns in northern Pakistan, were more akin to populations from the west, especially those from the Central Asian Steppe, e.g., the Pamiris and Tajiks (Fig. ). This could be attributed to less deeply rooted Asian-specific lineages, such as macrohaplogroup “M” and its derivatives, in our northern Pakistani samples (18.3%) than in the southern subcontinent populations [27, 43] (47%), as well as substantial haplogroup sharing (e.g., HV and J) between northern Pakistanis and Central Asians (Fig. S3). These affinities would have been established since ancient times, as evident from archaeological studies documenting ancient population movements between west Eurasia and the Indus peripheral region [44]. Further evidence comes from the gradual decrease in west Eurasian component from north Pakistan to the southeastern Indian subcontinent based on admixture estimation (Table S9). Moreover, the diversity indices of those lineages in northern Pakistan, which are prevalent in western Eurasians, show higher nucleotide diversities in northern Pakistan than in the southern subcontinent, implying longer differentiation of these lineages in the northwestern subcontinent (Table S10). These results together suggest that the Indo-Iranian populations in northern Pakistan retained more genetic components from western Eurasia in comparison with the IE-speaking populations in the southern Indian subcontinent.\n\nEurasian Steppe legacy in South Asia is largely retained in Indo-Iranian-speaking northern Pakistani groups\n\nBased on phylogeographic analysis of all available mitogenome data, we updated the phylogeographic status of the western Eurasian lineages in South Asia (Table S4) and identified 29 haplogroups which are prevalent in South Asia, and would have differentiated independently with derived branches in this region (Fig. S4). Five of these haplogroups, which had been reported in our previous work [22] (i.e., H2a1a3, J2b1a7a, R0a5a, U2e1h1, and U4a1f) were also reassessed together with the new haplogroup branches. Age estimations utilizing different mtDNA mutation rates and different methods indicated that the ages of these 29 haplogroups ranged from 10.14 to 0.5 kya (Table S11), with most (20/29) <5 kya old in South Asia (Table S11 and Fig. S4), a time subsequent to the major Bronze Age processes occurring in the Eurasian Steppe, e.g., eastern extensions of IE and related cultures advancing from Yamnaya about 3000 bc [2]. Specifically, among the 20 haplogroups that can be traced back to the Bronze Age period, 12 were distributed exclusively in northern Pakistan and 4 were ubiquitous in both the north and southern mainland (Fig. S4), accounting for ~23% of our northern Pakistani samples. Considering the restrictive distribution of these haplogroups in north Pakistan and the surroundings, it is possible that these haplogroups differentiated independently in this area. Therefore, the ages of these haplogroups would reflect the upper bound of their arrival times into north Pakistan. These results thus suggest substantial genetic contributions to the northern Pakistani gene pool since the beginning of the Bronze Age. This finding was further supported by Bayesian-based analysis, which illustrated that the majority of these west Eurasian lineages coalesced 5 kya in north Pakistan (Fig. S5). Interestingly, this extensive genetic contributions from west Eurasia during the Bronze Age is in agreement with the substantial settlements evidenced by the increasing number of archaeological remains in northern Pakistan with 14C dates from the beginning of the Bronze Age (Table S3 and Fig. S6), which are broadly interpreted as remnants of Indo-Iranian speakers from the region [45].\n\nFurther analysis, together with ancient mitogenome data, was conducted to assess past genetic contact between northern Pakistan and western Eurasia. Some haplogroups were found to have ancestors or sister lineages predominantly in the Middle East and the Caucasus (i.e., R0a5a, T1a2c, R2e, U7a3b1, and J1b1b1d) (Table S7 and Fig. S4), reflecting a likely genetic connection between northern Pakistan and the Middle East [46]. Similarly, several lineages (i.e., W3b2, I4b1, J1d7, U7a6, U7a2c, U7a3a1, U7b3, T2o, and T2d1b3) showed even more complex branching, with siblings found in the Middle East as well as further north in the Steppe, but mostly lacking upstream branches from the southern subcontinent (Fig. S4). Given the existence of genetic introgression from Anatolian farmers into Yamnaya ancestries [5], and the lack of Anatolian ancestry in South Asians after ~6000 bc [10], it is likely that these lineages would have been introduced into north Pakistanis by Steppe pastoralists, who accepted genetic contributions from Anatolian farmers. However, the possibility that the bearers of those haplogroups were early Iranian farmers [46] who further mixed with pastoralists in the BMAC [10] cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the absence of haplogroup K1 in our data, which is often associated with Neolithic dispersals from Anatolia [47], further supports the above admixture scenarios. Other haplogroups that would have been transported with these past genetic contacts, e.g., H5a1r and especially J2b1a7a, with ancestor types and sibling lineages in Europe, would have moved from the Europe and reached the Hindu Kush region, probably during the Bronze Age onward [22].\n\nWe further focused on haplogroups displaying direct connections between northern Pakistan and the Steppe region. Results indicated that haplogroup U2e1h1 (age 7.06–9.55 kya), which had ancestor types distributed in the Steppe region, likely originated therein. One possible explanation for the prevalence in northern Pakistan with coalescent ages >7 kya could be its presence in this region for more than 7000 years, and advent to northern Pakistan before the early Bronze Age Yamnaya expansion [12]. However, whether this kind of haplogroups are part of the common Eurasian-shared ancestry and remain visible in north Pakistan through genetic drift or originated elsewhere ~7–9 kya and dispersed into this region during the Bronze Age cannot be ruled out. Given the uncertainty of their expansion time into northern Pakistan, it is difficult to speculate whether U2e1h1 expanded with the spread of IE languages during the Bronze Age.\n\nDifferently, other haplogroups, with coalescent ages estimated since about 5 kya, such as J1b1a1f (age 2.63–3.53 kya, one outlier 12.07 kya was disregarded), U4a1f (age 2.52–5.00 kya), and H2b1 (2.35–5.25 kya) (Table S11), have ancestor and sister lineages found in Europe and the Steppe region (Fig. S4). These haplogroups, especially J1b1a1f and U4a1f which showed independent differentiations in north Pakistan, thus would have been introduced into the northern Pakistani Indo-Iranian-speaker gene pool after 5 kya, consistent with the arrival of Indo-Iranian-speaking groups in northern South Asia during the Bronze Age (~2300–1200 bc) [12]. Thus, these haplogroups could be considered as genetic legacies of IEs from the Steppe region. Additional support comes from haplogroup U4a1f, whose ancestor type (U4a1) was found in Neolithic samples from Europe and, importantly, in Yamnaya samples from the western Steppe (Fig. S4). Similarly, haplogroup W3a1a4 (age 2.35–5.25 kya) and sub-haplogroups of W3a1b (e.g., W3a1b1, age 2.63–6 kya, distributed in both northern Pakistan and the southern subcontinent), with the sister type W3a1a found in ancient Yamnaya samples, could also have Yamnaya-related origination. Other haplogroups, e.g., H2a1a3 (age 0.88–3.00 kya) with ancestor node in the eastern and central Steppe, likely suggest dispersals into northern Pakistan along with the expansion of Bronze Age cultures such as the Andronovo (a late Bronze Age culture also associated with early Indo-Iranian groups) (Fig. ). These haplogroups, viz., J1b1a1f, U4a1f, H2a1a3, W3a1a4, and W3a1b subbranches, can therefore trace their ancestry to the Steppe region and would have descended from populations therein during the Bronze Age (Fig. ). As their coalescent ages in northern Pakistan and the radiocarbon dates of their ancient Eurasian counterparts (Fig. ) fit well with the timing of the spread of IE languages into South Asia, the most probable explanation would be that these lineages were introduced into the gene pool of northern Pakistani Indo-Iranian speakers from the Steppe region from the beginning of the Bronze Age, at least according to currently available evidence.\n\nSouthward dispersal of haplogroup W3a1 to Indian subcontinent\n\nInterestingly, the IE genetic legacy from the Steppe region, i.e., H2a1a3, J1b1a1f, U4a1f, and subbranch of W3a1, accounted for 8.4% of our northern Pakistani samples, which is much more pronounced than that in the southern subcontinent populations (~1.7%) in the 1KGP [27] and HGDP [43] data sets. This implies a greater genetic contribution from the Steppe region to the northern Pakistanis than to the southern South Asians. One explanation could be the influence of demographic processes (e.g., genetic drift or founder effect) resulting in the retention of a greater genetic legacy from IE speakers in northern Pakistanis. However, considering the closer genetic affinity between the southern subcontinent Indo-Iranian and Dravidian speakers (Fig. S1), it is more likely that this difference is due to the southward migration of IE speakers via northern Pakistan, during which they assimilated maternal genetic components from contemporary non-IE-speaking groups, consistent with substantial ancestry from the Steppe in present-day South Asians [10]. This scenario finds further support from the southward dispersals of Steppe legacy of IEs in northern Pakistan in our analysis. For example, W3a1b, with root types found in both modern individuals and individuals of prehistorical and early historical periods in the Swat Valley, northern Pakistan [10], had subbranches W3a1b1, W3a1b2, and W3a1b3 that arose in situ in the southern subcontinent, especially India (Table and Fig. ). The estimated ages of sub-haplogroups of W3a1b (W3a1b1: 3.53 kya, W3a1b2: 4.14 kya) were further confirmed with BEAST estimations (Table ) and echoed the arrival time of IE speakers in India in the late Bronze Age (~1500 bc). Therefore, the genetic legacy of IE speakers in northern Pakistan also contributed to the gene pools of the southern subcontinent populations along with IE language expansion, indicating that the southward IE language expansion was not simply mediated by cultural diffusion. These results highlight the corridor role of the Hindu Kush region of northern Pakistan in genetic introgression from the Steppe to South Asia during the Bronze Age, which would have been mediated by the southward expansion of IE speakers, consistent with views from archaeological and linguistic studies [17, 19, 44, 45].\n\nTable 1\n\nHaplogroupNComplete mtDNA genomeaSynonymous substitutionsaCoding regionaBEAST estimateaρ ± σAge\n\n(kya)ρ ± σAge\n\n(kya)ρ ± σAge\n\n(kya)Age\n\n(kya)W3a1212.81 ± 0.4410.17 ± 1.131 ± 0.267.88 ± 2.041.48 ± 0.335.21 ± 1.1615.7 (6.89–26.3) >W3a1a4 (Northern Pakistan)30.67 ± 0.672.41 ± 1.730.67 ± 0.675.25 ± 0.670.67 ± 0.672.35 ± 5.282.28 (0.0004–6.76) >W3a1b1 (Mainland South Asia)31.67 ± 0.756.03 ± 1.940.33 ± 0.332.63 ± 0.581.0 ± 0.583.53 ± 2.054.32 (0.089–10.51)\n\nImpact of Bronze Age Eurasian Steppe expansion on population dynamics of South Asia\n\nBSP analysis was carried out to elucidate the impact of Bronze Age Eurasian migrations on the population dynamics of South Asia. Results indicated an increase in the effective population size (Ne) for northern Pakistani populations from ~18 kya (Fig. ), although relatively flat, likely facilitated by the climatic improvements after the last glacial maximum. The Ne of northern Pakistanis remained stable during the postglacial period and even during the Neolithic, in agreement with recent reports on modern and ancient genomes from South Asia [9, 48]. In brief, our results indicated that the Neolithic expansion into South Asia from 8 kya did not strongly affect the population size in northern Pakistan, thus suggesting any major genetic influx from the Iranian plateau during the Neolithic into the region to be unlikely. Surprisingly, a population decrease was observed in the northern Pakistanis after 5 kya, which lasted until 1.02 kya (Fig. ). This differs from the signal observed from Bronze Age lineages and the genetic legacy of IE speakers from the Steppe, which displayed intensive growth from 5 kya (Fig. ) and likely reflected a rapid population expansion of pastoralist groups from the Steppe after their migration into northern Pakistan. These BSP trends were reevaluated utilizing a relaxed clock model using the same data sets, with highly similar results, but with less intense population decline trend in northern Pakistan since 5 kya (Fig. S7). To further avoid any potential artifacts arising in BSP methodology [49], we calculated Tajima’s D and obtained a positive value (0.63550), indicative of population shrinkage in this region (Table S10) and lending support to the BSP results. One explanation for this decline may be the depletion of natural resources or habitat in the region after the arrival of Steppe pastoralists ~5.5 kya, which may have led to a population decrease [44, 50]. However, the influence of other factors, such as social structure changes, population size fluctuations, natural selection, and quaternary climatic oscillations between the northern hemisphere and South Asian monsoon [44], should not be ignored. More studies should be carried out to confirm this population decrease.\n\nIn summary, based on available archeological and high-resolution mitogenome data from northwestern Pakistan, especially from Iranian and Dardic populations, who are suggested to be the surviving traces of early Indo-Iranian groups, we identified the genetic contributions of different dispersals from west Eurasia into northern Pakistan during the Bronze Age onward. Importantly, we identified five haplogroups as the genetic legacy of IE speakers from the Eurasian Steppe, likely dispersed along with the migration of IE-speaking populations during the Bronze Age into northern Pakistan, thus implying that IE language expansion into South Asia was not simply mediated by cultural diffusion. This migration contributed 8.4% of the gene pool of northern Pakistani IE speakers, suggesting this demographic connection, which is a possible source of IE language diffusion, could be one part of the complex demographic history of the region. Our results also provide implications on the two main hypotheses of IE language origination, viz. Anatolia and Steppe hypotheses. Considering that Steppe components were observed in all Indo-Iranian groups in northern Pakistan in our study, as well as in other regions in South Asia [10], while lineages possibly representing the genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers, e.g., R2e, K1, were either absent or not found in all of the IE-speaking groups in northern Pakistan, our results lend more support to the Steppe hypothesis, at least from a matrilineal perspective. Furthermore, these IE speakers, as evidenced by the genetic legacy identified here, also moved southward and contributed genetically, though to a rather limited extent, to the Indian subcontinent, suggesting northern Pakistan as a corridor in the spread of IE languages during the Bronze Age dispersals into South Asia. Since our study is only based on mtDNA data, which only reflect maternal histories of populations, more investigations based on genome-wide data are also needed to intensively dissect the expansion of IE speakers into South Asia."
