        "text": "We are often reliant on GPS co-ordinates being delivered to our devices for locating places. With a little practice it’s not hard to read a decimal latitude and longitude value to determine a rough position.\n\nBut first it’s important to understand some key concepts.\n\nThe Prime Meridian divides the globe into Eastern and Western hemispheres, just as the equator divides the globe into Northern and Southern hemispheres. In the diagram above:\n\nTop right quadrant: Northern latitudes, Eastern longitudes\n\nBottom right quadrant: Southern latitudes, Eastern longitudes\n\nBottom left quadrant: Southern latitudes, Western longitudes\n\nTop left quadrant: Northern latitudes, Western longitudes\n\nThe Prime Meridian is at 0 degrees longitude (neither East or West), just as the equator is at 0 degrees latitude (neither North or South).\n\nThe spot south of Ghana where the Prime Median and Equator intersect has the co-ordinates 0 degrees latitude and 0 degrees longitude.\n\nTo help understand where degrees come from, imagine there is an imaginary point in the center of the Earth. You are standing on it, facing Greenwich in London.\n\nBy facing the Prime Meridian line, you are facing 0 degrees longitude (neither East nor West). Now you need to look up to face Greenwich. It is that angle (the angle you need to look up by to face London) that represents its latitude, which is 51.5 degrees (North).\n\nLet’s now look to the other side of the world… almost… to Sydney, Australia. This time you need to turn to your left (East) by 151.2093 degrees (longitude) and look down (South) by 33.8688 degrees (latitude).\n\nAlthough it’s a little more abstract to visualise, you can turn a maximum of 180 degrees from the prime meridian (either East or West) and 90 degrees from the equator (North or South). Using a mix of the two, you will be facing some point on the earth from your imaginary point in the center.\n\nAbove, I reported Sydney as 33.8688° S (latitude), 151.2093° E (longitude).\n\nYou could have previously seen latitude and longitude positions reported with negative values (e.g. -33.8688,151.2093). This format is referred to as Decimal Degrees (DD) and is the most common format used today. It’s still in latitude,longitude format, but now instead of using North or South for latitude, and East and West for longitude, +/- values are used.\n\nNorthern latitudes and Eastern longitudes are positive. Southern latitudes and Western longitudes are negative.\n\nHere are some example of cities in each of the quadrants and their latitudes and longitudes reported in the two ways described above:\n\nTop right quadrant: Northern latitudes, Eastern longitudes\n\ne.g. Moscow = 55.7558° N, 37.6173° E (55.7558,37.6173)\n\nBottom right quadrant: Southern latitudes, Eastern longitudes\n\ne.g. Sydney = 33.8688° S, 151.2093° E (-33.8688,151.2093)\n\nBottom left quadrant: Southern latitudes, Western longitudes\n\ne.g. Sao Paulo = 23.5558° S, 46.6396° W (-23.5558,-46.6396)\n\nTop left quadrant: Northern latitudes, Western longitudes\n\ne.g San Francisco = 37.7749° N, 122.4194° W (37.7749,-122.4194)\n\nYou might have come across other systems reporting latitude and longitude including; Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds (DMS) – the oldest format for geographic coordinates (though still used extensively today (including in camera metadata).\n\nFor example, here’s a snippet of the metadata from a GoPro 360 photo reporting latitude and longitude in DMS:\n\nYou can see (after converting ASCII characters) the location reads 28 deg 17’ 55.14” North (latitude) and 16 deg 32’ 44.90” West (longitude).\n\nBreaking it down we have:\n\n28 deg 17’ 55.14” North (latitude)\n\n28 degrees\n\n17 minutes\n\n55.14 seconds\n\nNorth\n\n16 deg 32’ 44.90” West (longitude)\n\n16 degrees\n\n32 minutes\n\n44.90 seconds\n\nWest\n\nDegrees reported here are no different to the way previously described.\n\nMinutes and seconds are where it gets tricky.\n\nLet’s start with latitude. Try and imagine lines circling the globe in Northern latitudes from the equator to the North Pole each 1 degree apart.\n\nIn globe image above, you can see some of these lines circling the globe representing 10°, 30°, 50°, 70° latitude.\n\nBetween each of these degrees, there are 60 minutes (or 60 more lines), and between each minute is 60 seconds (or 60 minutes).\n\nDegrees for latitude range from 0-90, minutes between 0 to 59 as integers and seconds between 0 to 59.9999 (reported up to 8 decimal places – see note on accuracy below) with North or South value reported.\n\nThe same system is in place for latitude, the only difference being degrees range 0-180 with East or West values reported.\n\nConverting to Decimal Degrees from Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds we can use the following equation\n\nSo in my GoPro example (28 deg 17' 55.14\" North, 16 deg 32' 44.90\" West)\n\nWhich gives us a DD latitude,longitude = 28.29865,-16.5458055556.\n\nA note on accuracy\n\nThe number of decimal places reported in the latitude and longitude values is important, as it determines the precision of the location.\n\nIn a world without computers decimal places were a major consideration. As computerised GPS systems entered the market this became less of a concern because computers can now easily report location to many decimal places from GPS readings.\n\nThe biggest issue with GPS accuracy today is down to the device and conditions."
