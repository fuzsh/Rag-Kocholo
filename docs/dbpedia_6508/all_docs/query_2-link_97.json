        "text": "accuracy\n\nThe closeness of an estimated value (for example, measured or computed) to a standard or accepted (\"true\") value. Antonym: inaccuracy Compare error, bias, precision, false precision and uncertainty.\n\n\"The true value is not known, but only estimated, the accuracy of the measured quantity is also unknown. Therefore, accuracy of coordinate information can only be estimated.\" (Geodetic Survey Division 1996, FGDC 1998).\n\nbathymetry\n\nThe measure of depth of water in oceans, seas and lakes.\n\nThe shapes of underwater terrains, including underwater topography and sea floor mapping.\n\nboundary\n\nThe spatial divide between what is inside a location and what is outside of it.\n\nbounding box\n\nAn area defined by the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a polygon, where those two corners define the north-south and east-west extremes of the area contained within.\n\ncoordinate format\n\nThe format in which coordinates are encoded, such as \"decimal degrees\", \"degrees minutes seconds\", \"degrees decimal minutes\", or Universal Transverse Mercator UTM.\n\ncoordinate precision\n\nThe fraction of a degree corresponding to the number of significant digits in the source coordinates. For example, if the coordinates are reported to the nearest minute, the precision is 1/3600th (0.00027778) of a degree; if a decimal degree is reported to two decimal places, the precision is 0.01 of a degree.\n\ncoordinate reference system\n\n(also spatial reference system) A coordinate system defined in relation to a standard reference or datum.\n\ncoordinate system\n\nA geometric system that defines the nature and relationship of the coordinates it uses to uniquely define positions. Examples include the geographic coordinate system and the Universal Transverse Mercator UTM coordinate system.\n\ncoordinates\n\nA set of values that define a position within a coordinate system. Coordinates are used to represent locations in space relative to other locations.\n\ncorrected center\n\nThe point within a location, or on its boundary, that minimizes the geographic radial of the location. This point is obtained by making the smallest enclosing circle that contains the entire feature, and then taking the center of that circle. If that center does not fall inside the boundaries of the feature, make the smallest enclosing circle that has its center on the boundary of the feature. Note that in the second case, the new circle, and hence the radial, will always be larger than the uncorrected one (see Figure 1).\n\nDarwin Core\n\nA standard for exchanging information about biological diversity (see Darwin Core).\n\ndatum\n\nA set of one or more parameters that serve as a reference or basis for the calculation of other parameters ISO 19111. A datum defines the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of the axes of a coordinate system. For georeferencing purposes, a datum may be a geodetic datum or a vertical datum.\n\ndecimal degrees\n\nDegrees expressed as a single real number (e.g. −22.343456). Note that latitudes south of the equator are negative, as are longitudes west of the prime meridian to −180 degrees. See also decimal latitude and decimal longitude.\n\ndepth\n\nA measurement of the vertical distance below a vertical datum. In this document, we try to modify the term to signify the medium in which the measurement is made. Thus, \"water depth\" is the vertical distance below an air-water interface in a waterbody (ocean, lake, river, sinkhole, etc.). Compare distance above surface. Depth is always a non-negative number.\n\ndirection\n\nsee heading.\n\nDMS\n\nDegrees, minutes and seconds – one of the most common formats for expressing geographic coordinates on maps. A degree is divided into 60 minutes of arc and each minute is divided into 60 seconds of arc. Degrees, minutes and seconds are denoted by the symbols °, ′, ″. Degrees of latitude are integers between 0 and 90, and should be followed by an indicator for the hemisphere (e.g. N or S). Degrees of longitude are integers between 0 and 180, and should be followed by an indicator for the hemisphere (e.g. E or W).\n\neasting\n\nWithin a coordinate reference system (e.g. as provided by a GPS or a map grid reference system), the line representing eastward distance from a reference meridian on a map.\n\nelevation\n\nA measurement of the vertical distance of a land or water surface above a vertical datum. On maps, the reference datum is generally some interpretation of mean sea level or the geoid, while in devices using GPS/GNSS, the reference datum is the ellipsoid of the geodetic datum to which the GPS unit is configured, though the device may make corrections to report the elevation above mean sea level or the geoid. Elevations that are above a reference point should be expressed as positive numbers, while those below should be negative. Compare depth, distance above surface, and altitude.\n\nellipsoid\n\nA three-dimensional, closed geometric shape, all planar sections of which are ellipses or circles. An ellipsoid has three independent axes. If an ellipsoid is made by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes, then two axes of the ellipsoid are the same, and it is called an ellipsoid of revolution. When used to represent a model of the earth, the ellipsoid is an oblate ellipsoid of revolution made by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis.\n\nentry point\n\nThe entry point on the surface of the ocean or lake where a diver enters the water and from which all activities are measured. See illustration in Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020).\n\nerror\n\nThe difference between a computed, estimated, or measured value and the accepted true, specified, or theoretically correct value. It encompasses both the imprecision of a measurement and its inaccuracies. Error can be either random or systematic. If the error is systematic, it is called \"bias\". Compare accuracy, bias, precision, false precision and uncertainty.\n\nextent\n\nThe entire space within the boundary a location actually represents. The extent can be a volume, an area, or a distance.\n\nfeature\n\nAn object of observation, measurement, or reference that can be represented spatially. Often categorized into \"feature types\" (e.g. mountain, road, populated place, etc.) and given names for specific instances (e.g. \"Mount Everest\", \"Ruta 40\", \"Istanbul\"), which are also sometimes referred to as \"named places\", \"place names\" or \"toponyms\".\n\ngazetteer\n\nAn index of geographical features and their locations, often with geographic coordinates.\n\ngeocode\n\nThe process (verb) or product (noun) of determining the coordinates for a street address. It is also sometimes used as a synonym for georeference.\n\ngeographic boundary\n\nThe representation in geographic coordinates of a vertical projection of a boundary onto a model of the surface of the Earth.\n\ngeographic center\n\nThe midpoint of the extremes of latitude and longitude of a feature. Geographic centers are relatively easy to determine, but they generally do not correspond to the center obtained by a least circumscribing circle. For that reason it is not recommended to use a geographic center for any application in georeferencing. Compare corrected center.\n\ngeographic coordinates\n\nA measurement of a location on the Earth’s surface expressed as latitude and longitude.\n\ngeographic radial\n\nThe distance from the corrected center of a location to the furthest point on the geographic boundary of that location. The geographical radial is what contributes to calculations of the maximum uncertainty distance using the point-radius georeferencing method. The term geographic radial, as defined here, replaces its equivalent \"extent\" used in the early versions of this Quick Reference Guide and related documents.\n\ngeometry\n\nThe measures and properties of points, lines, and surfaces. Geometry is used to represent the geographic component of locations.\n\ngeoreference\n\nThe process (verb) or product (noun) of interpreting a locality description into a spatially mappable representation using a georeferencing method. Compare with geocode. The usage here is distinct from the concept of georeferencing satellite and other imagery (known as georectification).\n\ngeoreferencing method\n\nThe theory, including a set of rules, general procedures and expected outcomes, meant to produce a specific type of spatial representation of a locality.\n\ngeoreferencing protocol\n\nThe set of specific documented steps that can be applied to produce a spatial representation of a locality, following one or more georeferencing methods.\n\nGPS\n\nGlobal Positioning System, a satellite-based system used for determining positions on or near the Earth. Orbiting satellites transmit radio signals that allow a receiver to calculate its own location as coordinates and elevation, sometimes with accuracy estimates. See also GNSS of which GPS is one example. See also GPS (receiver).\n\nGPS (receiver)\n\nThe colloquial term used to refer to both GPS and GNSS receivers (including those in smartphones and cameras). A GPS or GNSS receiver is an instrument which, in combination with an inbuilt or separate antenna, is able to receive and interpret radio signals from GNSS satellites and translate them into geographic coordinates.\n\ngrid\n\nA network or array of evenly spaced orthogonal lines used to organize space into partitions. Often these are superimposed on a map and used for reference, such as Universal Transverse Mercator UTM grid.\n\nground zero\n\nThe location on the land surface directly above a radiolocation point in a cave where the magnetic radiation lines are vertical. See illustration in Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020).\n\nheading\n\nCompass direction such as east or northwest, or sometimes given as degrees clockwise from north. Usually used in conjunction with offset to give a distance and direction from a feature.\n\nlatitude\n\nThe angular distance of a point north or south of the equator.\n\nlocality\n\nThe verbal representation of a location, also sometimes called locality description.\n\nlocality clause\n\nA part of a locality description that can be categorized into one of the locality types, to which a specific georeferencing protocol can be applied.\n\nlocality type\n\nA category applied to a locality clause that determines the specific georeferencing protocol that should be used.\n\nlocation\n\nA physical space that can be positioned and oriented relative to a reference point, and potentially described in a natural language locality description. In georeferencing, a location can have distinct representations based on distinct rules of interpretation, each of which is embodied in a georeferencing method.\n\nlongitude\n\nThe angular distance of a point east or west of a prime meridian at a given latitude.\n\nmeridian\n\nA line on the surface of the Earth where all of the locations have the same longitude. Compare antimeridian and prime meridian.\n\nnorthing\n\nWithin a coordinate reference system (e.g. as provided by a GPS or a map grid reference system), the line representing northward distance from a reference latitude.\n\noffset\n\nA displacement from a reference location. Usually used in conjunction with heading to give a distance and direction from a feature.\n\npath\n\nA route or track between one place and another. In some cases the path may cross itself.\n\npoint-radius\n\nA representation of the geographic component of a location as geographic coordinates and a maximum uncertainty distance. The point-radius georeferencing method produces georeferences that include geographic coordinates, a coordinate reference system, and a maximum uncertainty distance that encompasses all of the possible geographic coordinates where a locality might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the geographical uncertainties within a circle. The point-radius method uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the location (elevation, depth, distance above surface).\n\nprecision\n\nThe closeness of a repeated set of observations of the same quantity to one another – a measure of control over random error.\n\nWith values, it describes the finest unit of measurement used to express that value (e.g. if a record is reported to the nearest second, the precision is 1/3600th of a degree; if a decimal degree is reported to two decimal places, the precision is 0.01 of a degree).\n\nAntonym: imprecision. Compare accuracy, error, bias, false precision, and uncertainty.\n\nprime meridian\n\nThe set of locations with longitude designated as 0 degrees east and west, to which all other longitudes are referenced. The Greenwich meridian is internationally recognized as the prime meridian for many popular and official purposes.\n\nradial\n\nThe distance from a center point (e.g. the corrected or geographic center) within a location to the furthest point on the outermost boundary of that location. See also geographic radial.\n\nshape\n\nsynonym of footprint. A representation of the geographic component of a location as a geometry. The result of a shape georeferencing method includes a shape as the geographic component of the georeference, which contains the set of all possible geographic coordinates where a location might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the geographical uncertainties within the geometry given. The shape method uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the location (elevation, depth, distance above surface).\n\nsmallest enclosing circle\n\nA circle with the smallest radius (radial) that contains all of a given set of points (or a given shape) on a surface (see Smallest-circle problem). This is seldom the same as the geographic center, nor the midpoint between two most distant geographic coordinates of a location.\n\ntransect\n\nA path along which observations, measurements, or samples are made. Transects are often recorded as a starting location and a terminating location.\n\nuncertainty\n\nA measure of the incompleteness of one’s knowledge or information about an unknown quantity whose true value could be established if complete knowledge and a perfect measuring device were available (Cullen & Frey 1999). Georeferencing methods codify how to incorporate uncertainties from a variety of sources (including accuracy and precision) in the interpretation of a location. Compare accuracy, error, bias, precision, and false precision.\n\nUniversal Transverse Mercator UTM\n\nA standardized coordinate system based on a metric rectangular grid system and a division of the Earth into sixty 6-degree longitudinal zones. The scope of UTM covers from 84° N to 80° S. (See Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Coordinates in Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020))."
