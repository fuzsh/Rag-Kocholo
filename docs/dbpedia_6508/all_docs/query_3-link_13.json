        "text": "The Northern Hemisphere of Earth experiences December Solstice starting from December 21 to December 22 depending on your time zone.\n\nWhat is exactly December Solstice?\n\nDecember Solstice is an astronomical phenomenon that happens when the Earth's axial tilt reaches an optimum position, where the Northern Hemisphere is the farthest from the Sun. The Northern Hemisphere experiences the shortest day of the year on this day or the longest night as some might say.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe same phenomenon takes place on June 23 in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nLet us take a look at some of the December Solstice celebrations from across the world:\n\nDongzhi Festival\n\nThe Dongzhi Festival is one of the most important occasions in China and other parts of East Asia. Chinese people celebrate the Yin and Yang philosophy of universal harmony and balance. They mark this day as an advent of longer days and the flow of positive energy. The Chinese and Taiwanese people pay homage to their ancestors on this day and attend family dinner with servings of Tangyuan, a traditional Dongzhi Festival food.\n\nImage source: Asian Bistro\n\nChaomos\n\nKalasha, also known as the Kalash Kaafir, is a tribe of people from the north-western region of Pakistan. The Kalash Kaafir tribe celebrate a festival named 'Chaomos' on the day of December Solstice. The Chaomos festival honours Balomian, a demi-god who used to live with the Kalasha and protect it. They believe that Balomian returns back to the Kalasha so as to listen the prayers and take them back to Dziam, the mystical land where the Kalasha was originated.\n\nImage source: Cultural Symbolism\n\nThe Feast of Juul or Yule\n\nThe Yule Festival or the Feast of Juul is a pagan festival celebrated in the Scandinavian regions. People from North Europe pay tribute to the Norse Gods by burning the 'Yule Log' and light fire to symbolise the prosperity of life. In many parts of England, Germany and France, the Yule Log would be burnt to ashes and then the ashes would be spread over farms as fertilizers until the Twelth Night from the Night of Juul.\n\nImage source: Top 5\n\nBrumalia\n\nBrumalia is an ancient Roman festival that marks the shortest day of the year. The festival honours Saturn, the God of generation, dissolution, plenty, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. The celebrations were prohibited in the sixth century by Emperor Justinian.\n\nImage source: Fromthedoghouse\n\nBurning the Clocks\n\nPeople in Brighton, England celebrate the Winter Solstice in a very unique way. They make lanterns and costumes from willow canes and white tissue papers and organise a procession till the seaside where they arrange bonfires and burst crackers. Founded in 1993, the ritual works as an antidote to the excess of commercialism during Christmas.\n\nBlue Christmas\n\nIn the Western Christian culture, December Solstice marks the day of Longest Night or Blue Christmas. On this day, many churches hold special services for those who have lost their loved ones.\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
