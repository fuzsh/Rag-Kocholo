        "text": "In geography, location is a fundamental concept that helps us understand where places are situated on the Earth’s surface. Geographers can describe the location of a place in one of two ways: absolute and relative.\n\nUnderstanding the differences and applications of these location concepts is essential for geographic literacy This article explores the definitions, examples, and significance of absolute and relative locations in geography.\n\nWhat is Absolute Location?\n\nAbsolute location describes the location of a place based on a fixed point on earth. The most common way is to identify the location using coordinates such as latitude and longitude or by the use of a street address when available.\n\nAbsolute location can also be the name of the city or region or postal code a point is located in although this is less precise than using coordinates or an address.\n\nWhat is latitude and longitude?\n\nLatitude is used to mark the north-south position of a location on the Earth’s surface and ranges from 0 degrees at the equator to 90 degrees at the North and South Poles. There are 180 degrees of latitude and the distance between each degree of latitude is roughly 69 miles (111 km).\n\nLongitude lines run north-south and indicate the location of a point east-west. Latitude is therefore the angular distance east or west of the Prime Meridian. There are 360 degrees of longitude (+180° eastward and −180° westward.).\n\nLines of longitude and latitude crisscross the Earth. A location that is being described using latitude and longitude will have a set of coordinates. Latitude is always written first and latitude and longitude are composed of degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS). Latitude and longitude coordinates can also be written as decimal degrees.\n\n(Watch an extended version of this video about absolute and relative location).\n\nAn Example of Absolute Location\n\nAn example of an absolute location using latitude and longitude is the United States Capitol in Washington D.C. which is located at 38° 53′ 35″ N, 77° 00′ 32″ W. In decimal degrees, the absolute location of the U.S. Capital Building is 38.89012259750874, -77.00907196001525.\n\nAbsolute location can also refer to an address, the street address of the US State Capitol is First St SE in Washington, DC 20004. In both instances, absolute location refers to a fixed point based on an abstract network of imaginary locations.\n\n(You might also be interested in reading about: Relative Direction Versus Compass Direction)\n\nWhat is Relative Location?\n\nRelative location refers to the position of a place or entity based on its location with respect to other locations. Relative location, unlike absolute location is not a fixed reference. Relative location will therefore change based on the secondary location.\n\nFor example, the United States is located south of Canada. If the location of the United States is described based on its relative location to Venezuela, then it would be described as being north of that country.\n\nIn the map below, a person would describe the relative location of Broad River, which flows through North Caroline and South Carolina, differently.\n\nA person living in Hickory, North Carolina would describe the location of Broad river as flowing south and slightly west of them. A person in Charlotte, North Carolina would describe the river as flowing west of them. A person living in Spartanburg, South Carolina would describe the river as being located north and east of them.\n\nRelative location can also be expressed in terms of distance, travel time, or cost.\n\nAn Example of Relative Location\n\nWe can again look at this map of the area around the U.S. Capitol. The north arrow in the upper right hand corner lets the user know the cardinal directions. As a relative location, the U.S. Capitol can be described as being due west of the U.S. Supreme Court or southwest from the Russell Senate Office Building.\n\nWhat is Relative Distance and Absolute Distance?\n\nThe location could also be desired in terms of how long it would take to travel to the U.S. Capitol Building along specific routes. For example, the U.S. Capital Building is a roughly six minute walk southwest from the Russell Senate Office Building using Constitution Avenue.\n\nAs with absolute location, absolute distance involves describing the distance from one point to another using units of measurements. For example, the U.S. Capitol is 0.3 miles from the The location could also be desired in terms of how long it would take to travel to the U.S. Capitol Building. For example, the U.S. Capital Building is a roughly six minute walk southwest from the Russel Senate Office Building walking along NE Constitution Avenue.\n\nWhat are Locator Maps?\n\nRelative location can also be used to provide geographic context. For example, overview or locator maps show the relative location of a place or entity based on a larger geographic view. For example, the inset map below, shows the relative location of the state of Texas within the United States.\n\nExamples of Absolute and Relative Location\n\nMore examples of absolute and relative location can be found here.\n\nQuick overview: Absolute Versus Relative Location\n\nAbsolute location refers to the exact geographical coordinates of a place, usually measured using latitude and longitude. Some facts about absolute location are:\n\nAbsolute location provides a precise description of where a place is located on the Earth’s surface.\n\nIt is commonly used in navigation and map-making.\n\nAbsolute location is unique to every place on Earth and cannot be duplicated.\n\nWith the help of GPS technology, absolute location can be determined with high accuracy.\n\nRelative location, on the other hand, describes the position of a place in relation to other places. It is based on the understanding of the surrounding environment and spatial relationships. Here are some facts about relative location:\n\nRelative location is a more subjective way of describing a place’s location, as it is based on people’s perceptions and experiences of the area.\n\nIt can be used to describe a place’s proximity to other important features, such as rivers, mountains, or cities.\n\nRelative location is important in geography and urban planning, as it helps to understand the relationships between different places and how they interact with each other.\n\nRelative location can change over time as the surrounding environment changes or as new places are developed.\n\nVideo: Absolute and Relative Location\n\nThis article was first written in 2016 and has since been updated.\n\nRelated"
