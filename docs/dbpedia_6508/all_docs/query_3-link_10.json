        "text": "Definition\n\nSolstice comes from Latin – “sol” for “sun” and “sisto” for “stop.” During the December solstice, the sun will stop moving southward, pause, and then begin to move northward. So the first day of winter in the Northern Hemisphere occurs when the North Pole is tilted the farthest away from the sun. Less sunlight reaches the Northern Hemisphere during the winter because of the planet’s tilt on its axis. This is also the day when the Southern Hemisphere observes summer solstice.\n\nThe December solstice is traditionally called the Winter Solstice in t Northern Hemisphere and the Summer Solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nCelebrations around the world related to the December solstice:\n\nChaumos/ Chaomos\n\nAt least seven days, including December 21, the winter solstice. Chaomos is the winter festival of the Kalasha (also known as Kalash Kafir) people, who live in valleys in the northwestern corner of Pakistan, about 20 miles north of Chitral. The festival honors Balomain, a demigod who once lived among the Kalasha and did heroic deeds. Every year, his spirit comes to the valleys to count the people, collect their prayers, and take them back to Tsiam, the mythical land where the Kalasha originated, and to Dezao, the omnipotent creator god. More\n\nChristmas\n\nChristmas Day is 25th December, but the celebrations begin before the day. There are many accounts of how Solstice and Christmas Day share a common history More\n\nNew Year – Bolivia\n\nhttp://www.northernstar.com.au/news/lighten-up-as-days-lengthen/1916119/\n\nThe Tiwanaka of Bolivia celebrate New Year on the December solstice.\n\nSt. Lucia’s Day\n\nThis Scandinavian tradition occurs on Dec. 13, the winter solstice according to the old Julian calendar. A young woman portrays St. Lucia and wears a wreath of candles. It is said that St. Lucia brings back the sun and chases winter away.\n\nYalda\n\nThis holiday is celebrated on the eve of the first day of winter on the Persian calendar. According to Iranian mythology, Mithra, the angel of light and truth, was born at the end of this night after defeating darkness.\n\nSt Thomas’ Day/ Feast of St. Thomas\n\nSt. Thomas was a disciple of Jesus Christ who spread Christianity to countries as far East as India. In some countries his day is now celebrated in June. More.\n\nYule/ Juul\n\nAlso known as midwinter, or Winter Solstice, the ancient celebration of Yule or Juul is the time when the Goddess gives birth to the new spark of hope; the light of the world which was conceived during the rites of Ostara.\n\nThe present-day custom of lighting a Yule log at Christmas is believed to have originated in the bonfires associated with the Feast of Juul.
