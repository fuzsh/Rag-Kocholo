        "text": "Coordinates are entered in the appropriate format for the coordinate system that is used by your organization. When sent to Google Earth, these coordinates are converted into the corresponding WGS84 latitude and longitude values.\n\nYou can enter coordinates for the following coordinate systems by using Analyst's Notebook:\n\nCoordinate system Format Description Example British National Grid (BNG) Grid reference (a two letter code), easting value (a three number code), northing value (a three number code). NZ346134 Or with a datum code prefix: OGB-7*NZ346134 British National Grid (Decimal) You can enter a pair of values up to six digits long. The values in the pair must have the same number of digits. You can also enter the grid letters. 500100 123099 Or, with a datum code prefix: OGB-A*500100 123099 Decimal Degrees (DD) Degrees north, degrees east. 13.34 90.76 Or, with a datum code prefix: WGE * 13.34 90.76 Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) DMS North, DMS East.\n\nYou can enter degrees, minutes, and seconds in any of these formats:\n\n35:54:15 14:31:8\n\n35/54/15 14/31/8\n\n35°54'15\", 14°31'8\"\n\n52°14'36.61”, 0°42'57.09”//\n\nWGE * 12°34'56\" 98°76'54\"\n\nNote: Do not leave spaces after the characters used for degrees, minutes, and seconds. Do not use 'd' for degrees or 'm' for minutes. For the minute and second symbols, use the plain quotation mark character (' or \") and the closing quotation mark character (' or ”).\n\n35:54:15 14:31:8\n\n35° 54'15\" 14° 31'8\"\n\nMilitary Grid Reference System (MGRS) Grid zone UTM zone Easting Northing\n\nNote: Eastings and northings can be up to five digits long. You can also enter the grid and UTM zones.\n\n4QFJ12345678 Or, with the datum code prefix: WGE*4QFJ12345678 Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) Hemisphere Easting Northing\n\nFor example:\n\nN 2500000 1850000\n\nN 2500000E 1850000N\n\nN 2500000 mE 1850000 mN\n\nThe northern hemisphere is assumed if no hemisphere is specified. For example, these two coordinates give locations in different hemispheres:\n\n2001125.58678e 1666857.45654668n\n\nS 2001125.58678e 1666857.45654668n\n\nN 2500000 1850000 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone number Hemisphere Easting Northing\n\nNote: There must be a space after the hemisphere.\n\n11U 465586 3973426"
