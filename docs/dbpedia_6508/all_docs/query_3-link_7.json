July 2024: Elevation added by WDS-Paleo using get_elev_point() from the elevatr R package with the AWS Terrain Tiles (aws) and WGS 84 reference frame.\n\nABSTRACT SUPPLIED BY ORIGINATOR: Past global climate changes had strong regional expression. To elucidate their spatio-temporal pattern, we reconstructed past temperatures for seven continental-scale regions during the past one to two millennia. The most coherent feature in nearly all of the regional temperature reconstructions is a long-term cooling trend, which ended late in the nineteenth century. At multi-decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them. There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic, Europe and Asia than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. Recent warming reversed the long-term cooling; during the period ad 1971-2000, the area-weighted average reconstructed temperature was higher than any other time in nearly 1,400 years.\n\nPurposeTree ring data from the International Tree Ring Data Bank and World Data Center for Paleoclimatology archives. Most data sets include raw treering measurements (most are annual ring width, with some collections of earlywood or latewood width or wood density), plus chronologies (standardized growth indices for a site compiled from multiple treering samples). Reconstructions of climate variables are included with some of these data sets. Each data type is stored in a separate data file; the data type is coded into the file name.
