        "text": "What are GPS (global positioning system) coordinates?\n\nGPS coordinates are a unique identifier of a precise geographic location on the earth, usually expressed in alphanumeric characters.\n\nCoordinates, in this context, are points of intersection in a grid system. GPS coordinates are usually expressed as the combination of latitude and longitude. Lines of latitude coordinates measure degrees of distance north and south from the equator, which is 0 degrees. The north pole and south pole are at 90 degrees in either direction. The prime meridian, located in Greenwich, UK, is 0 degrees longitude, and the lines of longitude coordinates are measured according to 90 degrees east and west from that point.\n\nGPS coordinates are expressed in two different formats. Below are the coordinates for the Empire State Building in New York City:\n\nN40° 44.9064', W073° 59.0735'\n\nThat same information can be expressed in a purely numeric format:\n\n40.748440, -73.984559 (decimal degrees)\n\nIn the numeric format, the minus sign before the second number indicates that the location is west of the prime meridian; a minus sign in front of the first number would indicate degrees south of the equator.\n\nHow GPS is deployed\n\nOrbiting above the earth's surface at precise positions is a satellite constellation of 24 GPS satellites. Each one is referred to as a bird and uses radio waves to communicate with other satellites to determine an exact location on the earth. These satellites use the World Geodetic System, known as WGS84, as its reference coordinate system. WGS84's coordinate origin is the center of the Earth.\n\nPosition data is transmitted via radio signals to ground-based devices, or transceivers, that receive position information from three or more satellites and convert that data, using specialized software, into visual information. This visual information can be displayed on a video screen, such as those used in automobiles and airplanes.\n\nThe software in these air-ground GPS transceivers converts the position data into visual maps or other geographical representations. GPS users can also obtain the actual map coordinates if they wish.\n\nGPS data and applications are accessible on watches and other handheld devices, laptop computers and any information system that can send and receive GPS data.\n\nThe U.S. government owns the GPS system, and the U.S. Department of Defense maintains it because its original purpose was for military applications. Nonmilitary users first got access to this data in the 1990s. Today, GPS is a resource available virtually anywhere on the planet."
