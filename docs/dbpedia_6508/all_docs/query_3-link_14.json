        "text": "The Great Banded Desert, sometimes known simply as the Great Desert or Banded Desert, was a large band of very hot, very sandy land that stretched from much of the North Hemisphere of Kharak down to the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe names of nearby places, like Cape Wraths and place description point than the Great Banded Desert was once a great seabed, or several little seas. As it was the flatest region, it was there where The Exile ships landed, like the Khar-Toba, founding cities. But when the region became uninhabitable, they were forced to migrate to the North Pole. Eventually, the Core caused more alien spaceship to malfunction on orbit and crash there, as the Kalash or the Taiidan (ship), turning the area into a real spaceships' graveyard.\n\nThe desert was a deadly zone, and the first ones to traverse it were the members of Kiith Paktu, in 490 KDS, to colonize the southern Polar Region, during the Heresy Wars. The wars also extended to the South Pole, when Kiith Gaalsien attempted to conquer the Paktu' without success. The first outpost on the desert was Saju-ka, the temple city which was eventually covered with sand in 717 KDS. The gaalsiens, the responsible ones, where declared a rogue Kiith and they self-exiled to the Great Banded Sea. There, they found the Exile's wreck ships and exploited them, managing to uncover most of their mysteries and technology.\n\nFor centuries, the Gaalsiens were the only known permanent residents of the desert, along with, it is implied, with the Khaanephs, their worst enemies.\n\nEventually, after the beginning of Project StormBreaker, the Gaalsiens began using attacking the other Kiiths, which eventually gave beginning to the Desert Wars. The Coalition of the Northern Kiithid, in 1106 KDS, located Khar-Toba, or \"the Primary Anomaly\", the first city, and sent an expedition, Operation Skaal Brii, to reach and secure it, but failed. In 1110, a second expedition there was made, Operation Khadiim. Hard conditions on desert forced the Kushan to use enviro suits in order to survive. The expedition triggered a total war against the Gaalsiens, but they were defeated and the expedition reach their destination, hilding it for years. Khar-Toba's technology allowed the Kuushan to return the stars.\n\nLocations[]\n\nKalash Site.\n\nCape Wrath.\n\nGaalsien Base.\n\nHell's Gate.\n\nBelladin Dune Sea.\n\nGaraaki Highlands.\n\nWhispering Galley.\n\nKashar Plateau.\n\nTorin Crater.\n\nPrimary Anomaly (Khar-Toba).\n\nSource[]"
