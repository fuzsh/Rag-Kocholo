        "text": "Dedicated to my good friend Bob McDonald War consists of long periods of seeming inactivity with, for some troops, intermittent phases of frenzied activity, perhaps even combat. Most of a soldier's time is taken up with the mundane day to day duties and routines so necessary to keep an army functioning and, of course, the men busy and out of mischief. The journal around which this article is centered is written from the point of view of a field officer commanding a regiment. As such it does not shed much light into the common soldiers' lives but does give the perspective of the field commanders who oversaw the breaking up of their battalions at the end of 1776, and then faced the responsibility of reenlisting and reorganizing their units company by company. Much of the narrative describes the whereabouts and activities of an average Continental regiment in spring and summer of 1777, including many days denoting the occurrence of \"nothing Extronary.\" The focal point of the journal as well as of Colonel Shreve's military experience up to 1777 is his account of the Battle of Short Hills. The impact of this action on Shreve can be seen by the description contained herein and by his devotion of six more pages to the battle in letters to friends. Finally, the journal contributes to a greater understanding of a little known but critical period of the War for American Independence.1 New Jersey's Continental battalions first served during 1776 but saw little fighting. Some of the state's troops reached Canada in time to participate in the closing stages of the siege of Quebec and the ignominious retreat into New York. The 1st and 2d Battalions took part in the affair at Trois Rivieres which at best was a confused and ignominious action. Following that the northern army took post at Fort Ticonderoga where Col. William Maxwell's 2d New Jersey Battalion spent the rest of their one year enlistment. In autumn 1776 Maxwell was promoted to brigadier general and Israel Shreve to colonel of the 2d Regiment in the army's new establishment. After the men's period of service expired he was faced with the task of organizing the unit anew. It is at this point that the colonel's journal begins.2\n\nIn August 1779 Continental army surgeon Jabez Campfield wrote, \"How hard is the soldier's lott who's least danger is in the field of action? Fighting happens seldom, but fatigue, hunger, cold & heat are constantly varying his distress.\" In the same vein, eighteenth century common soldiers spent much more time preparing meals, digging fortifications or latrines, chopping and hauling wood, and myriad other mundane tasks, than facing the enemy in battle. One of the lesser-known roles for a soldier was acting as servant to one or several officers.1 Officers of both sides during the War for American Independence were allowed one or more personal servants, also called waiters, but the practice was regulated. November 1776 Continental army orders stipulated, “No Boys (under the idea of Waiters, or otherwise) or old Men, to be inlisted …” Waiters (sometimes also called servant, batman, or “bowman”) accompanied their masters wherever they went. Directions for making unit field returns in March 1779 mentioned, ”Under Rank and File in the first column are to be inserted all men fit for duty, in which number are to be included all officers waiters belonging to the Army (who are ever to go on duty with their Masters, making part of the detail).” Furthermore, soldier-waiters were expected to carry arms during drill and in line of battle, though, in reality, this did not always occur. On May 4, 1779 General George Washington directed that the army’s brigades practice Maj. Gen. Friedrich Wilhelm de Steuben’s new manual of discipline and maneuver, “and as a single man's being ignorant of the principles will often cause disorder in a platoon and sometimes in a battalion, no waiter or other soldier is to be exempted from this exercise.” This was reiterated a week later, “The Commanding officers of regiments are to be answerable that no Waiter or other person absents himself from the Exercise on any pretence and the Generals and Inspectors of Brigades will visit the regiments and see that this order is strictly obeyed.” At month’s end, the commander-in-chief seemed to relent: “No Arms to be delivered to Waggoners, Waiters of the General Field or Staff officers but only to those men who are to appear in Action.” Thus far, no official allotment of servants to officers prior to 1782 is known. One early intimation dates from November 1778, to the commander of Sheldon’s 2nd Continental Light Dragoons, “A field officer is to be allowed forage for four horses only including his servants. A captain forage for 3 horses including his servants, and a subaltern forage for two horses including his servants.”2 This likely alludes to one servant per officer, with the additional mounts being pack horses for baggage.\n\nBackground. In 2007 a collection of 18th century drawings and documents were offered for sale by Sothebys. The images portrayed scenes from the early years of the War for American Independence, particularly the 1776 and 1777 summer/autumn campaigns. (Stephen Gilbert notes that the Germantown drawing was done during the artist’s convalescence following his wounding in that action, all the others were likely done while aboard ship enroute to the Chesapeake Bay in late July and August 1777.) Almost too good to be true, many at first thought them forgeries, but eventually they were confirmed to be as advertised. For some time the artist’s identity remained unknown, there being no signature or other identifying mark on any of the documents. Eventually, enough clues were gleaned to mark Richard St. George Mansergh St. George as the culprit. St. George was first an ensign in the 4th Regiment, dating from 15 April 1776, then lieutenant as of 23 December 1776 in the 52d Regiment, light infantry company (later captain, 31 January 1778). Fortunately, he was mentioned a number of times by his friend Lt. Martin Hunter, of the same regiment and company, in his journal (see The Journal of Gen. Sir Martin Hunter, Edinburgh, The Edinburgh Press, 1894). It was Hunter who wrote of St. George’s artistic abilities, as well as his character: St. George and I were great friends. He was a fine, high-spirited, gentleman-like young man, but uncommonly passionate. He had a little Irish servant, the most extraordinary creature that ever was. He had been a servant in the family a long time, and was the ugliest little fellow I ever beheld. He was very much marked with the smallpox, had a broad white face, little blue eyes, and lank long hair. St. George always called him the Irish priest. This little man was to the full as passionate as his master, and frequently provoked him to such a degree that I often expected he would have killed him. St. George was quite military mad, and the man copied the master in everything. When the man was fully equipped for action, he was a most laughable figure as was ever seen. He wore one of his master’s old regimental jackets, a set of American accoutrements, a long rifle and sword, with a brace of horse pistols, and was attended by two runaway Negroes equipped in the same way. On a shot being fired at any of the advanced posts, master and man set off immediately – the master attended by a man of the Company named [Corporal George] Peacock, who had been a great deal with the Indians in Canada, and a famous good soldier. I have often been surprised that they were not killed. St. George drew caricatures uncommonly well, and I prevailed on him one day to draw himself and man in a violent passion, which he did so well, and so like, that everybody knew it immediately. Bernard, his servant, was lying on his back, and St. George, with one foot on his breast, flourishing a sabre over his head, telling him to say a short prayer, for that he had not more than a minute to live. One of the drawings sold by Sothebys shows wounded British soldiers carried in a two-wheeled cart. At the bottom is written, ““My Triumphant entry into Philadelphia.” One of two narratives in the collection begins, “My Dear Friend West met me in ye Cart as he was marching with the Grenadiers to support us and took me by the Hand – and wept as I have been since told – The figure I intended for West is execrable I endeavoured to blot out his face but coud not the paper being too thin – General Washington attacked our Lines with a body of about Twelve to fourteen Thousand Men with all his field artillery at German Town the 4th of October at four in the morning 1777.”"
