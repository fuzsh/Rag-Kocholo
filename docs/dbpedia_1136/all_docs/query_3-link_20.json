        "text": "SUMMARY\n\nBrown seaweeds are keystone species of coastal ecosystems, often forming extensive underwater forests, that are under considerable threat from climate change. Despite their ecological and evolutionary importance, this phylogenetic group, which is very distantly related to animals and land plants, is still poorly characterised at the genome level. Here we analyse 60 new genomes that include species from all the major brown algal orders. Comparative analysis of these genomes indicated the occurrence of several major events coinciding approximately with the emergence of the brown algal lineage. These included marked gain of new orthologous gene families, enhanced protein domain rearrangement, horizontal gene transfer events and the acquisition of novel signalling molecules and metabolic pathways. The latter include enzymes implicated in processes emblematic of the brown algae such as biosynthesis of the alginate-based extracellular matrix, and halogen and phlorotannin biosynthesis. These early genomic innovations enabled the adaptation of brown algae to their intertidal habitats. The subsequent diversification of the brown algal orders tended to involve loss of gene families, and genomic features were identified that correlated with the emergence of differences in life cycle strategy, flagellar structure and halogen metabolism. We show that integration of large viral genomes has had a significant impact on brown algal genome content and propose that this process has persisted throughout the evolutionary history of the lineage. Finally, analysis of microevolutionary patterns within the genus Ectocarpus indicated that deep gene flow between species may be an important factor in genome evolution on more recent timescales.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBrown algae correspond to the class Phaeophyceae within the stramenopile lineage. Many of these organisms are key components of extensive coastal ecosystems that provide high value ecosystem services, including the sequestration of several megatons of carbon per year globally, comparable to values reported for terrestrial forests1. The important role of kelp ecosystems is threatened by climate-related declines in seaweed populations worldwide2. However, appropriate conservation measures, coupled with the development of seaweed mariculture as a highly sustainable and low impact approach to food and biomass production, could potentially reverse this trend, allowing seaweeds to emerge as a tool with a significant role in mitigating the effects of climate change3. To attain this objective, it will be necessary to address important gaps in our knowledge of the biology and evolutionary history of the brown algal lineage. For example, these seaweeds remain poorly described in terms of genome sequencing due, in part, to difficulties with extracting nucleic acids. The Phaeoexplorer project has generated 60 new genomes corresponding to 40 species of brown algae and four close sister species (Table S1). The 40 brown algal species include representatives of 16 families, spanning all the major orders of the Phaeophyceae4. The sequenced species include brown algae that occur at different levels of the intertidal and subtidal, and are representative of the broad diversity of this group of seaweeds in terms of size, levels of multicellular complexity and life cycle structure (Figure 1). This extensive genomic dataset has been analysed to study the origin and evolution of key genomic features during the emergence and diversification of this important group of marine organisms.\n\nRESULTS\n\n1) In-depth sequencing of the Phaeophyceae lineage\n\nSequencing the genomes of brown algae has been hampered by the significant challenges involved, including inherent problems with growing brown algae, the presence of molecules that interfere with sequencing reactions and complex associations with microbial symbionts. Consequently, despite their modest genome sizes and accessible haploid stages, complete genome sequences have only been obtained for nine species to date5‚Äì13. Here we report work that has significantly expanded the genomic data available by sequencing and assembling 60 new genomes for 40 brown algae and four closely related species, covering 16 Phaeophyceae families (Figure 2A, Table S1). The Phaeoexplorer dataset (which can be accessed at https://phaeoexplorer.sb-roscoff.fr) includes a set of good quality assemblies complemented with lower quality draft assemblies that have been used to sample additional strains from across the lineage (Figures 2A and S1A, Table S1). Seventeen of the new genomes were sequenced using long-read technology, primarily Oxford Nanopore (Table S1). The remainder were assembled using short-read data and, although these assemblies consist of shorter contigs, they provide a dense coverage of the Phaeophyceae lineage and have facilitated gene-level comparative analysis. Analyses of genome content and evolution have, however, focused principally on a set of 21 good quality reference genomes, which include four previously published genomes (Table S1). In addition to broadly sampling brown algal taxa, the study included extensive sampling of 12 species from the genus Ectocarpus, providing a detailed survey of diversity and microevolution events within this genus (Table S1). Finally, in addition to the nuclear genomes, the Phaeoexplorer data allowed the assembly and annotation of 34 sets of plastid and mitochondrial genomes (Table S2).\n\nThe brown algal genomes exhibit marked differences in assembly size and GC content (Figure S1B). Comparison of structural features across the set of nuclear genome assemblies indicated not only that that the cumulative lengths of intergenic regions and transposable elements were correlated with genome size but that there was also a correlation with cumulative intron size (Figures 2B and S1C, Table S1). An earlier analysis of the Ectocarpus species 7 (at that time classified as Ectocarpus siliculosus) genome found a strong tendency for adjacent genes to be located on opposite strands of the chromosome, a feature that is more typical of very small, compact genomes5. Analysis of the Phaeoexplorer genomes indicated that this characteristic is common to the whole FDI (Fucophycideae/Dictyotales/Ishigeales) clade but the tendency is strongest in the Ectocarpales, where the proportion of alternating gene pairs can be greater than 60% (Figure 2B). Another feature that is shared by all brown algae, plus some of the closely-related sister taxa, is that intergenic intervals between divergently transcribed gene pairs tend to be shorter than those between tandem gene pairs (Figure 2B). Again, this is a feature that was previously observed in Ectocarpus species 7 where it is associated with the presence of common nucleosome-depleted regions and histone modification peaks at the transcription start sites of the divergently transcribed genes14. Clusters of tandemly-repeated genes are more numerous in the Phaeophyceae than in sister clades (Figure 2B). These clusters only represent modest proportions of the total gene sets (around 6% for the Ectocarpales and 10-12% for the Fucales, for example) but the amplified families may have played important roles in brown algal adaptation and diversification.\n\nOn average, brown algal genes tend to be more intron-rich than those of the other stramenopile groups15, including closely-related sister species (Figure 2B), with the notable exception of Chrysoparadoxa australica, whose genes contain many short, C/T-rich introns (Figure 2B). The vast majority of splice sites in Phaeophyceae are of the canonical GT-AG type and no signatures of minor U12 introns were identified in intronic sequences, in accordance with a previous study16. Consistent with this observation, an analysis of spliceosome proteins using a recent reference dataset17 found that, with the exception of ZCRB1, none of the 12 minor spliceosome genes were present in brown algal genomes (Table S3), indicating that the minor intron spliceosomal associated machinery was lost in the Phaeophyceae. As far as the Sm/Lsm spliceosome is concerned, this analysis identified lineage-specific gene duplications and loss of some components18 (Figures S2A and S2B).\n\nAn analysis of intron conservation profiles using a set of single-copy orthologous proteins conserved across Phaeophyceae and close sister groups confirmed that a high proportion of C. australica introns are unique to that species, suggesting that a burst of intron gain occurred during its evolution (Figures 2C, S2C, S2D and S2E). In Phaeophyceae species, more than 90% of introns are shared with at least one of the sister clades, indicating that most introns are ancient. Very few of the introns that have been gained during Phaeophyceae evolution are unique to one order or species, with most being conserved across all brown algal lineages. This observation indicates that a phase of intron acquisition occurred at around the time of the emergence of the Phaeophyceae (principally before the divergence of the Phaeophyceae and Schizocladia ischiensis) followed by a period of intron stability up to the present day (Figure 2C). The phase of intron acquisition was possibly linked to increased multicellular complexity (Figure 1) and concomitant decreases in effective population sizes19. Increased intron density may have facilitated some of the genome-wide tendencies that will be described below, such as increased reorganisation of composite genes for example. Even if the mechanisms that initially led to an increased prevalence of introns are likely to have been neutral19, this increase will have provided scope for alternative splicing and domain reorganisation that may have played an important role in the acquisition of developmental complexity17,20‚Äì22.\n\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key regulatory roles in diverse eukaryotic taxa23,24. This class of gene has been characterised in Ectocarpus species 7 and Saccharina japonica and there is evidence that some of these genes may play regulatory roles during development and life cycle progression in brown algae25‚Äì27. Eleven transcriptomes (Table S4) were searched for lncRNAs using a meta-classifier, votingLNC, that integrates information from ten lncRNA-detection programs. This analysis indicated that brown algal genomes contain about twice as many lncRNA genes as protein-coding genes (Figure S2F). The lncRNA transcripts tend to be shorter than mRNAs and to be less GC-rich (Figure S2F).\n\n2) Evolutionary events at the origin of the brown algal lineage\n\nMarked gene gain and gene rearrangement during the emergence of the Phaeophyceae lineage\n\nThe brown algae are a lineage of complex multicellular organisms that emerged from within a group of stramenopile taxa that are either unicellular or have very simple filamentous multicellular thalli (Figure 1). To investigate events that occurred during the emergence of the brown algal lineage, we first carried out a series of genome-wide analyses aimed at identifying broad trends in genome evolution (Figure 3). This comparative analysis of the Phaeoexplorer dataset identified several marked changes in genome structure and content coinciding approximately with emergence of the Phaeophyceae. Dollo analysis of gain and loss of orthogroups (i.e. gene families) indicated marked gains during early brown algal evolution followed by a broad tendency to lose orthogroups later as the different brown algal orders diversified (Figures 3B and S3A). The orthogroups gained during early evolution of the brown algal lineage are enriched in genes related to signalling, transcription and carbohydrate metabolism (Figures 3B and S3B). Similarly, a phylostratigraphy analysis indicated that 29.6% of brown algal genes could not be traced back to ancestors outside the Phaeophyceae, with the majority of gene founder events occurring early during the emergence of the brown algae (Figure 3A, Table S5), again indicating a burst of gene birth during the emergence of this lineage. Interestingly, many of the genes acquired at the origin of the Phaeophyceae or later encode secreted or membrane proteins suggesting possible roles in cell-cell communication that may have been important for the emergence of complex multicellularity or perhaps as components of defence mechanisms (Figure 3A). In addition, comparison of the Phaeophyceae with the four close sister species identified 180 orthogroups that had significantly expanded in brown algae, with predicted functions predominantly related to metabolism, particularly carbohydrate metabolism, and signal transduction (Figure 3C, Table S6).\n\nAnalysis of composite genes (domain fusions and fissions) indicated that domain reorganisation was also prevalent during the early stages of brown algal emergence, with gene fusion events being slightly more common than gene fissions (Figure 3E), representing about 6% to 7% of brown algal gene complements. Composite genes tended to be retained at a higher frequency than non-composite genes during the most recent phase of brown algal evolution, but a larger proportion of these genes had unknown functions than for non-composite genes (Figure S4A). Functions enriched in the composite gene set include carbohydrate metabolism, transcription, cell wall biogenesis and signal transduction (Figure 3E). Figure S4B shows an example of a novel domain association that is predicted to have arisen just prior to the emergence of the brown algal lineage.\n\nA potential source of novel genetic information during the emergence of the brown algae could have been horizontal gene transfer. A phylogeny-based search for genes potentially derived from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events indicated that these genes constitute about 1% of brown algal gene catalogues and are predicted to have been principally acquired from bacterial genomes (Figures 3D and S4C). The proportion of class-specific HGT events compared to more ancient HGT events was greater for the brown algae (33.5%) than for the sister taxa Xanthophyceae (Tribonema minus) and Raphidophyceae (Heterosigma akashiwo; mean of 17.1% for the two sister taxa, Wilcoxon p-value 0.02105), indicating that higher levels of HGT occurred during the emergence of the brown algae than for the sister taxa (Figure 3D). This difference is consistent with the results of the phylostratigraphy analysis, which indicated a peak of gene founder events directly following the emergence of the Phaeophyceae lineage. Genes that are predicted to be derived from HGT exhibit different ranges of codon usage bias and gene feature lengths to non-HGT-derived genes (Figure S4D), and have diverse predicted functions, with carbohydrate transport and metabolism and cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis being the most prevalent (Figure S4E).\n\nAuCoMe28 was used to provide an overview of metabolic pathways across the brown algae by inferring genome-scale metabolic networks for all the species in the Phaeoexplorer dataset (https://gem-aureme.genouest.org/phaeogem/; Figures S5A and S5B) and also for a subset of long-read sequenced species (https://gem-aureme.genouest.org/16bestgem/; Figures S5C and S5D). Comparison of the brown algal metabolic networks with those of the sister taxa allowed the identification of enzymatic activities that have been gained or lost in the former compared with the latter (Figures S5E, S5F and S5G). The most robust set of core reactions found mainly in brown algae is a set of 23 reactions, including polyamine oxidases, carotenoid and indole-3-pyruvate oxygenases, a methyladenine demethylase, an endo-1,3-alpha-glucosidase, a xylosyl transferase, a ribulosamine kinase, several galactosylceramide sulfotransferases and phosphopentomutases (Table S7). This set of robust brown algal core reactions is consistent with the Dollo and phylostratigraphic analyses, which both indicated that genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and signalling were prevalent among the genes gained by the brown algal lineage.\n\nAcquisition of key metabolic pathways during the emergence of the Phaeophyceae lineage\n\nSeveral emblematic features of brown algae, such as their characteristic cell walls and their novel halogen and phlorotannin metabolisms, can be linked to genomic events that occurred during the early stages of brown algal emergence. For example, large complements of carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZYme) genes (237 genes on average) were found in all brown algal orders and in its sister taxon S. ischiensis but this class of gene was less abundant in the more distantly related unicellular alga H. akashiwo (Figures 4A, S6A and S6B, Tables S8 and S9). The evolutionary history of carbohydrate metabolism gene families was investigated by combining information from the genome-wide analyses of gene gain/loss, HGT and gene family amplification (Figure 4B). This analysis indicated that several key genes and gene families (ManC5-E, GT23 and PL41) were acquired by the common ancestor of brown algae and S. ischiensis, with strong evidence in some cases that this occurred via HGT (PL41). Moreover, marked amplifications were detected for several families (AA15, ManC5-E, GH114, GT23 and PL41), indicating that both gain and amplification of gene families played important roles in the emergence of the brown algal carbohydrate metabolism gene set. Alginate is a major component of brown algal cell walls and it plays an important role in conferring resistance to the biomechanical effect of wave action29. It is therefore interesting that mannuronan C5 epimerase (ManC5-E), an enzyme whose action modulates the rigidity of the alginate polymer, appears to have been acquired very early, by the common ancestor of brown algae and S. ischiensis (Figures 4B and 4C). The acquisition of ManC5-E, together with other alginate pathway enzymes such as PL41 (Figures 4A, 4B and 4D), was probably an important evolutionary step, enabling the emergence of large, resilient substrate-anchored multicellular organisms in the hostile coastal environment (Figure 1). The sulphatases that remove sulphate groups from sulphated polysaccharides30 appear to be of more ancient origin, with homologues being present in other stramenopile lineages (Table S10).\n\nBrown algae are able to produce a broad range of halogenated molecules and these molecules are thought to play important roles in multiple processes including defence, adhesion and cell wall modification31. Vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (vHPOs) are a central component of these reactions and all three classes of brown algal vHPO (algal types I and II and bacterial-type32‚Äì34) appear to have been acquired early during the emergence of the Phaeophyceae (Figures 4A, S6C and S6D, Tables S11 and S12). Closely-related sister species do not possess any of these three types of haloperoxidase, with the exception of the closest sister taxon, S. ischiensis, which possesses three algal-type haloperoxidase genes (Figure 4A). These sequences appear to be intermediate forms as they are equally distant, phylogenetically, from the class I and class II algal-types (Figures 4A, S6C and S6D). Algal type I and II vHPO genes probably diverged from an intermediate-type ancestral gene similar to the S. ischiensis genes early during Phaeophyceae evolution. It is likely that the initial acquisitions of algal- and bacterial-type vHPOs represented independent events although the presence of probable vestiges of bacterial-type vHPO genes in S. ischiensis means that it is not possible to rule out acquisition of both types of vHPO through a single event.\n\nPolyketides are a group of secondary metabolites that exhibit a wide range of bioactivities. Brown algae possess three classes of type III polyketide synthase (Figures 4A, 5A and S6E, Tables S13). The first class (PKS1) was acquired early in stramenopile evolution, after divergence from the oomycetes but before the divergence of Diatomista and Chrysista (Figure 5A). Acquisition of PKS1 probably involved horizontal transfer from a bacterium. Distance analysis of a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (Figure 5A) indicated that PKS1 was more likely to have been acquired from a cyanobacterium than from an actinobacterium, as was previously proposed35. The second class of type III polyketide synthase (PKS2) probably arose via a duplication of PKS1 just prior to the divergence of the brown algal lineage from the Phaeothamniophyceae (Figure 5A). Undaria pinnatifida is the only species where a duplication of PKS2 was observed. The PKS3 class appeared much more recently, within the Ectocarpales during the diversification of this brown algal order, again probably via a duplication of PKS1 (Figure 5A). PKS3 genes were only found in two families, the Ectocarpaceae and the Scytosiphonaceae. The enzymatic activities and functions of PKS2 and PKS3 remain to be determined but analyses of the functions of recombinant PKS1 proteins have indicated that different proteins may have different activities leading to the production of different metabolites35‚Äì37. For example, the Ectocarpus species 7 PKS1 enzyme produces phloroglucinol from malonyl-CoA alone or malonyl-CoA plus acetyl-CoA whereas the PKS1 enzymes of Sargassum binderi and Sargassum fusiforme generate 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone. It is therefore interesting that the PKS1 family has expanded in some members of the Sargassaceae, with a maximum of five PKS1 genes detected in S. fusiforme (Figures 4A and 5A). These expansions may be associated with diversification of PKS1 biochemical function. Many of the stramenopile PKS III genes encode proteins with signal peptides or signal anchors (Figure S6E). For the brown algae, this feature is consistent with the cellular production site of phlorotannins (which are derived from phloroglucinol) and the observed transport of these compounds by physodes, secretory vesicles characteristic of brown algae38. More specifically, polymerization of phloroglucinol gives rise to higher molecular weight compounds with C-C and/or C-O bonds, such as fucols, phloroethols or fucophloroethols, which constitute the phlorotannin family of compounds and are unique to brown algae. Phlorotannins are a common feature of all brown algae with the exception of a few Sargassaceae such as Cystoseira tamariscifolia and Ericaria selaginoides39,40. Cross-linking of phlorotannins, embedded within other brown algal cell wall compounds such as alginates, has been demonstrated in vitro through the action of vHPOs41‚Äì43 and indirectly suggested by in vivo observations colocalising vHPOs with physode fusions at the cell periphery44,45. Consequently, vHPOs are good candidates for the enzymes that cross-link phlorotannins and other compounds, perhaps even for the formation of covalent bonds between phloroglucinol monomers and oligomers, which could occur via activation of aromatic rings through halogenation. These observations suggest that the acquisition of vHPOs by the common ancestor of brown algae and S. ischiensis, together with existing PKS enzymes, triggered the emergence of new metabolic pathways leading to the production of the phlorotannin molecules characteristic of the Phaeophyceae lineage.\n\nIn brown algae, the output of the Calvin cycle is used to produce the carbon storage molecule mannitol via the mannitol cycle46. The genes that encode the four enzymes of the mannitol cycle are not only conserved in all brown algae but were also found in sister taxa as distant as H. akashiwo (Table S14), indicating that the mannitol cycle was acquired before brown algae diverged from closely-related stramenopile taxa. The mannitol cycle genes include a linked pair of M1PDH3 and M1Pase1 genes which may therefore represent the ancestral core of this metabolic cycle. These pairs of genes are head-to-head and adjacent in brown algae with an intergenic region ranging from about 500 bp (Ectocarpales) to 10 kbp (Fucus serratus). The organisation of this gene pair differs in sister groups with, for example, a tandem arrangement and an intervening gene in S. ischiensis and two M1PDH3 / M1Pase1 gene pairs in H. akashiwo with tail-to-head and head-to-tail arrangements and long (150-200 kbp) intergenic regions.\n\nEvolution of novel cellular and signalling components during the emergence of the Phaeophyceae lineage\n\nMost stramenopiles possess motile cells with two heteromorphic flagella, although there are some exceptions such as the male gametes of pennate diatoms. Searches for the presence of flagellar proteins, based on proteomic inventories of Colpomenia bullosa anterior and posterior flagella47, indicated that highly-conserved proteins such as the mastigoneme proteins MAS1, MAS2 and MAS3, a flagellar titin protein, which is thought to be involved in connecting mastigonemes to the flagellar axoneme, and flagellar creatine kinase are present in all brown algae and sister taxa (Figures 4A and 5B, Table S15). In contrast, the helmchrome protein, which is thought to be involved in light reception and zoid phototaxis47, was only found in brown algae and some closely-related sister taxa, the most distant being C. australica (Figure 4A).\n\nAn analysis of transcription-associated proteins indicated that the range of gene families and the relative sizes of each gene family are relatively constant across the brown algae and their close sister species (Figures 4A, 5C, S7A and S7B, Table S16), suggesting that the emergence of the brown algae did not involve major changes to the transcription machinery. For example, large families of C2H2, Zn_clus, GNAT and SWI_SNF_SNF2 genes are a common feature in both brown algal and sister taxa genomes.\n\nBrown algal genomes contain homologues of components of several phytohormone biosynthetic pathways, including indole-3-acetic acid (the auxin IAA), cytokinins, brassinosteroids, ethylene and gibberellins (Figure S7C, Table S17), with the exception of tryptophan aminotransferase (TAA; auxin biosynthesis) and copalyl diphosphate/ent-kaurene synthase and ent-kaurene oxidase (CPS/KO; gibberellin biosynthesis). The presence of these genes is consistent with the identification of the corresponding hormones48,49 and of brassinosteroid-like molecules50 in brown algae. As far as abscisic acid (ABA) is concerned, brown algae have the capacity to synthesise oxidised cleaved carotenoids, supporting the idea that they may generate ABA-like signalling molecules51. Similarly, OPDA, an intermediate of the jasmonic acid pathway, has been identified in brown algae, raising the possibility that this molecule itself may have a signalling role similar to OPDA-like molecules in hornworts52. The putative brown algal phytohormone biosynthetic genes are also present in the genomes of sister taxa and therefore appear to have been acquired well before the emergence of the brown algae. However, an expansion of the flavin monooxygenase (YUC) gene family (which mediates a rate limiting step in IAA production in land plants) appears to have occurred in the common ancestor of the Phaeophyceae, S. ischiensis, C. australica and T. minus (Figure S7C).\n\nMembrane-localised signalling proteins (Figures 4A and S7D) are of interest in brown algae not only as potential mediators of intercellular signalling in these complex multicellular organisms but also because of potential interactions with their elaborate extracellular matrices (cell walls)29,53. A detailed analysis of the brown algal receptor kinase (RK) gene family, revealed that it actually includes two types of receptor kinase, the previously reported leucine-rich repeat (LRR) RKs5 and a newly-discovered class of receptors with a beta-propeller extracellular domain (Figures 4A and S7D, Table S18). The phylogenetic distribution of RKs (Figures 4A and S7D) suggests that beta-propeller-type RKs may have originated before LRR RKs in the brown algae although the presence of both beta-propeller and LRR RKs in C. australica (but none of the other sister species analysed) raises questions about the timing of the emergence of the brown algal RK family. Note that oomycetes (distantly related stramenopiles) possess a phylogenetically distinct family of LRR RKs5 but not beta-propeller RKs. Diversification of receptor kinase families by the acquisition of different extracellular domains is therefore a characteristic that is so far unique to the three most complex multicellular lineages: animals, land plants and brown algae. Histidine kinases (HKs) are widespread in the stramenopiles but several classes of membrane-localised HK were either only found in brown algae (HKs with an extracellular domain resembling an ethylene binding motif54) or only in brown algae and close sister groups (CHASE and MASE1 domain HKs54) and appear to be absent from other stramenopile lineages (Figures 4A and S7D, Table S19). These classes of HK all exhibit a patchy pattern of distribution across the brown algae and are often monoexonic suggesting possible multiple acquisitions from viruses via HGT (Figures 4A and S7D). Brown algae have integrin-like molecules53, and this feature was found to be shared with several sister stramenopile lineages including pelagophytes. A single integrin-like gene was found in close sister groups but this gene was duplicated early in brown algal evolution, with a further recent duplication in Ectocarpus species 7 and U. pinnatifida and gene loss in several other brown algae (Figures 4A and S7D, Table S20). Proteins with an FG-GAP domain (a component of integrins) were found in several other stramenopile lineages but these proteins did not have the characteristic integrin domain structure and their evolutionary relationship to brown algal integrin-like proteins is uncertain (Figure S7D). Brown algae and closely-related sister groups also possess a single gene that is very similar to the land plant membrane-localised calpain domain protein DEK1 (Figures 4A and S7D, Table S21), which is thought to act as a mechanosensor in land plants by activating the RMA channel55. Fasciclin (FAS) domain proteins are found throughout the stramenopiles but only brown algae have membrane-localised proteins with four extracellular FAS domains analogous to the membrane-localised fasciclin proteins in animals that interact with the extracellular matrix (Figure S7D, Table S22)56. Finally, all stramenopiles, including brown algae, appear to have a single tetraspanin gene plus a gene that encodes a stramenopile-specific eight transmembrane domain tetraspanin-like protein (Figure S7D, Table S23).\n\nThe Phaeoexplorer dataset allowed the origins of the major families of brown algal ion channels to be traced (Table S24). Most classes of brown algal ion channel are also found in other stramenopile groups, such as IP3 receptors, which were earlier shown to mediate calcium signalling in Fucus57, and Nav/Cav four-domain voltage-gated calcium channels, which are associated with rapid signalling processes and the regulation of flagella motion58. Pennate diatoms and angiosperms, which both lack flagellated gametes, do not possess Nav/Cav channels59. Land plants and diatoms also lack IP3 receptors. All stramenopile lineages, including brown algae, have OSCAs, which are mechanosensitive channels that have been implicated in calcium signalling during osmoregulation60,61, and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (although the latter were not detected in H. akashiwo). In brown algae the only ubiquitous ligand-gated ion channels are the glutamate receptors (GLR). P2X receptors are absent and the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC, related to acetylcholine and GABA receptors in animals) was only found in D. mesarthrocarpum. EukCat, a novel class of single domain voltage-gated calcium channel recently discovered in diatoms62, appears to be absent from brown algae and other stramenopiles.\n\nThe EsV-1-7 domain is a short, cysteine-rich motif that may represent a novel class of zinc finger63. The EsV-1-7 domain protein IMMEDIATE UPRIGHT (IMM) has been shown to play a key role in the establishment of the elaborate basal filament system of Ectocarpus sporophytes63. The IMM gene is part of a gene family, which has just one member in oomycetes and eustigmatophytes but was shown to have expanded to over 90 members in the Ectocarpus species 7 genome63. Therefore, although EsV-1-7 domain proteins are completely absent from animal and land plant genomes, they are likely to be an important family of regulatory molecules in the brown algae. Analysis of the Phaeoexplorer data (Figure 4A, Table S25) indicated that the EsV-1-7 gene family had already started to expand in the common ancestor of the brown algae and the raphidophyte H. akashiwo, with 31-54 members in the sister taxa that shared this ancestor. Further expansion of the family then occurred in most brown algal orders, with the largest number of genes (335 members) being detected in Ascophyllum nodosum. EsV-1-7 domain genes tend to be clustered in tandem arrays in brown algal genomes (Table S6 and S25). The IMM gene was found in brown algal crown group taxa and in Dictyota dichotoma but not in D. mesarthrocarpum (Figure 4A, Table S25), indicating that this gene originated within the EsV-1-7 gene family as the first brown algal orders started to diverge. IMM is therefore conserved in most brown algal taxa but its function in species other than Ectocarpus remains to be determined.\n\nThe emergence of the brown algae also appears to have been associated with genomic events that may have had an important impact on the regulation of chromatin function. Most brown algal genomes code for about 20 histone proteins but the number of histone genes was correlated with genome size. For example, U. pinnatifida and A. nodosum, which have quite large genomes (634 and 1,253 Mbp, respectively) have 36 and 173 histone genes, respectively (Table S26). As in animal genomes64, the majority of brown algal histone genes occur in clusters. For example, Chordaria linearis and U. pinnatifida both have three contigs containing 80-90% of their histone genes, whereas Saccharina latissima and S. ischiensis each have a single contig which contains ‚àº40% of their histone genes. As in other eukaryotic lineages, histone H4 is highly conserved due to its structural role in binding H3, H2A and H2B, and no variants were found in brown algae. All Phaeophyceae possess H3.3 and CenH3 but additional H3 variants were only found in the Discosporangiales and Dictyotales and in sister taxa as distant as the raphidophytes (Figures 4A and S8A). The centromeric variant CenH3 is highly divergent across the brown algae, particularly in the N-terminal tail (Figure S8B), as reported in other lineages65. In contrast to what has been observed in humans and land plants66,67, H3.3 is encoded by a single gene in brown algae. H3.1 is encoded by several genes as in the majority of organisms. The brown algal H3.1 and H3.3 clades are distinct from those of animals and land plants indicating independent amplifications (Figure S8C). Linker H1 variants are highly divergent across the eukaryotes and this is also true for brown algae, with A. nodosum, for example, possessing 11 different H1 proteins (Figure S8D, Table S26). Brown algae with a genome of less than 1 Gbp possess ‚àº10 H2B-coding genes but F. serratus, A. nodosum and the sister taxon H. akashiwo have at least three times more. Finally, brown algae not only possess H2A variants such as the H2A.X but also three novel H2A variants that only exist in Phaeophyceae and the sister taxon Schizocladiophyceae (Rousselot et al, unpublished).\n\nAn analysis of eight histone post-translational modifications in Ectocarpus species 7 indicated that the majority had similar genomic and genic distributions to those observed in animals and land plants, indicating that they have similar functional roles14. However, dimethylation of lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79me2) has a very different distribution pattern in Ectocarpus compared to animals. In animals, H3K79me2 is associated with the 5‚Äô ends of transcribed genes68 whereas in Ectocarpus it occurs as extended blocks, which can span several genes and appears to be associated, at least indirectly, with down-regulation of gene expression14. The H3K79me2 mark is written by DOT1-class DNA methylases, which are encoded by multiple genes in brown algae. Dollo analysis identified gain of a new DOT1 orthogroup (OG0008134) in the common ancestor of the Phaeophyceae and the two close sister taxa S. ischiensis and Phaeothamnion wetherbeei, indicating a possible correlation between this unusual H3K79me2 distribution pattern and the appearance of a novel DOT1 protein.\n\nDNA methylation was not detected in the filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus5 but occurs at a low level in the kelp Saccharina japonica25. Both species lack the canonical DNA methylase DNMT1 and methylation is thought to be mediated by DNMT2 in S. japonica. Interestingly, analysis of the Phaeoexplorer dataset identified DNMT1 genes in Discosporangium mesarthrocarpum and two sister species S. ischiensis and C. australica indicating that the common ancestor of brown algae probably possessed DNMT1 but that this gene was lost after divergence of the Discosporangiales from other brown algal taxa (Figure 4A, Table S27). Consequently, most brown algae are expected to either lack DNA methylation or to exhibit very low levels of methylation.\n\nOverall, these analyses indicated that the emergence of the brown algal lineage coincided with several marked genomic changes including periodic bursts of the emergence of new gene families over evolutionary time, increased domain reorganisation and the appearance of several key families including haloperoxidases, membrane-localised signalling molecules and ion channels.\n\n3) Diversification and adaptation of the brown algae to intertidal ecosystems\n\nMorphological and life cycle diversification was correlated with changes in gene expression and gene evolution rates\n\nSince the establishment of the brown algal lineage, approximately 450 Mya69, the Phaeophyceae have diversified and adapted to multiple niches in predominantly coastal, marine environments. This diversification has resulted in organisms with a broad range of morphological complexity ranging from filamentous to complex parenchymatous thalli, with the more complex thalli containing a greater number of different cell types (Figures 1 and S9A). Additional highly variable characteristics of the brown algae include the structures of their life cycles, their diverse reproductive strategies and their metabolic pathways28,29,70,71. The Phaeoexplorer dataset was analysed to search for genomic features associated with these diverse phenotypic characteristics. Most brown algae have haploid-diploid life cycles involving alternation between sporophyte and gametophyte generations but the relative sizes of the two generations varies markedly across species with, for example, the sporophyte being much larger and more developmentally complex than the gametophyte in groups such as the kelps. Analysis of generation-biased gene (GBG) expression in ten species whose haploid-diploid life cycles ranged from sporophyte dominance, through sporophyte-gametophyte isomorphy to gametophyte dominance indicated, as expected72, that the number of GBGs was inversely correlated with the degree of intergenerational isomorphy (Figure S9B, Table S28). However, species with very heteromorphic life cycles had greater numbers of both sporophyte- and gametophyte-biased genes, indicating either that gene downregulation plays an important role in the establishment of heteromorphic generations or that there is also cryptic complexification of the more morphologically simple generation.\n\nWe also found indications that life cycle variation and the emergence of large, complex bodyplans in the brown algae may have impacted genome evolution through population genetic effects. The theoretical advantages of different types of life cycle have been discussed in detail73 and one proposed advantage of a life cycle with a haploid phase is that this allows effective purifying counter-selection of deleterious alleles. When the brown algae with haploid-diploid life cycles were compared with species from the Fucales (the only brown algal order with diploid life cycles) increased rates of both synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates were detected in the latter, consistent with the hypothesis that deleterious alleles are phenotypically masked in species where most genes function in a diploid context (Figure S9C). Comparison of non-synonymous substitution rates (dN) for genes in brown algae with different levels of morphological complexity, ranging from simple filamentous thalli though parenchymatous to morphologically complex, indicated significantly lower values of dN for filamentous species (Figure S9C). This observation suggests that the larger, more complex brown algae may have smaller effective population sizes and consequently weaker counter-selection of non-synonymous substitution rates19.\n\nDiversification of flagellated cells was correlated with changes in the flagellar proteome\n\nDiversification of brown algal reproductive systems has been associated with multiple changes to flagellated cells, including partial or complete loss of flagella from female gametes in oogamous species and more subtle modifications such as loss of the eyespot in several kelps or of the entire posterior flagella in D. dichotoma74,75. Interestingly, the latter modifications are correlated with loss of the helmchrome gene from these species (Figures 4A and 5B). An analysis of the presence of genes for 70 high-confidence flagellar proteins across eight species with different flagellar characteristics identified proteins that correlate with presence or absence of the eyespot or of the posterior flagellum (Figure 5B, Table S15).\n\nDiversification of brown algal metabolic and signalling pathways\n\nThe metabolic pathways of brown algae have diversified as different species have adapted to different niches. For example, the ManC5-E family, which is involved in alginate modification, markedly expanded in the Laminariales and Fucales (Figure 4C). ManC5-E converts Œ≤-D-mannuronate to Œ±-L-guluronate allowing the formation of a rigid gel in the presence of calcium. In addition, five different orthogroups containing proteins with the mechanosensor wall stress-responsive component (WSC) domain were identified as having increased in size during the emergence of the brown algal lineage (Table S6), indicating a complexification of carbohydrate metabolism and perhaps signalling pathways. Polysaccharide metabolism gene amplification events may reflect, at least in part, fine tuning to optimally adapt brown algal cell walls to specific features of their ecological niche and to modulate cell wall characteristics for different organs and cell types within a complex bodyplan. Similarly, several species within the Ectocarpales and Laminariales have acquired an additional M1PDH gene perhaps allowing greater capacity or finer regulation of carbon storage through the mannitol cycle (Table S14). Several gene families that are putatively associated with the biosynthesis of phytohormones such as ABA, brassinolide, ethylene, gibberellins, jasmonic acid and strigolactones have expanded in the Fucales (Figure S7C).\n\nIn diatoms, LHCX proteins play an important role in the photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus under conditions of excess light76. Chromosome six of the Ectocarpus species 7 genome is known to contain a cluster of 14 LHCX genes interspersed with genes coding for proteins unrelated to photosynthesis5,77. Analysis of the Phaeoexplorer genomes indicated that LHCX genes were present in this genomic context before the divergence of the Desmarestiales but that the expansion of the gene cluster only began in a common ancestor of the Laminariales and Ectocarpales (Figure S10A). The general features of the cluster are conserved in the genomes of Ectocarpus species 7, Ectocarpus crouaniorum, Ectocarpus fasciculatus, Scytosiphon promiscuus, Porterinema fluviatile and C. linearis but in C. linearis the cluster appears to have undergone a partial rearrangement and contains only three LHCX copies whereas the clusters in all other species include at least seven LHCX genes. In S. latissima, the genes of the cluster were found in three short contigs that may be adjacent on the same chromosome. LHCX gene clusters are also present in D. dichotoma (4 genes on contig 3024, 3 on contig 458 and 2 on contig 1592) of the early branching order Dictyotales and in S. ischiensis (4 plus 2 genes on contig 28 and 2 genes on contig 64), but the genomic context of these clusters differs from that of the cluster found in Ectocarpus spp., indicating independent expansions of the LHCX family in these taxa. LHCX sequences from S. ischiensis, D. dichotoma and the genus Ectocarpus grouped into independent, species/genus-specific clusters in a phylogenetic analysis (Figure S10B), further supporting independent expansions of the LHCX gene family in these taxa. The LHCX clusters probably evolved by gene duplication and ectopic gene conversion. The involvement of gene conversion is indicated by the higher intraspecific identity of LHCX sequences between paralogs than between putative orthologs (based on synteny) compared across species (Figure S10A and S10B). The large gene cluster that contains LHCX4 to LHCX7 commonly contains overlapping LHCX genes on opposite strands of the chromosome, with some or all of the exons of one gene being located within an intron of the other (Figure S10C). Changes in gene dosage in response to environmental selection (as observed, for example, in studies by78,79) may have been a driver of the LHCX gene family expansion.\n\nComparison of the plastid genomes generated by the Phaeoexplorer project (Table S2) identified gene loss events during the diversification of the brown algal orders that affected five different loci. Two of these genes have been lost more than once within the lineage (Figure S10D, Table S29). Gene losses have previously been reported80,81 for three of these genes (rpl32, rbcR and sylB). Phylogenetic trees based on either the plastid or mitochondrial gene sets were congruent with the phylogeny based on nuclear gene data82 at the ordinal level (Figure S10E). For the plastid genome, this congruency was also observed at the sub-ordinal level but, interestingly, a marked discordance was observed between the mitochondrial tree and the nuclear and plastid trees for the Ectocarpales, indicating possible mitochondrial introgression events between species within this order (Figure S10E), as has been observed in other eukaryotic lineages, for example Picea83 and chipmunks84.\n\nAn emblematic characteristic of brown algae is their capacity to accumulate halogens and their complex halogen metabolisms, particularly for groups like the Laminariales and Fucales31. Comparative analysis identified several instances of independent expansions of the haloperoxidase gene families within orders, with expansions being particularly marked in the Fucales and the Laminariales (Figures 4A and S6C). In contrast, with some rare exceptions, the Ectocarpales do not possess expanded vHPO gene families and there is evidence for multiple, independent gene losses leading to loss of one or two of the three vHPO classes in many species. In the Laminariales, the algal type I family are specialised for iodine rather than bromine85 and this may have been an innovation that occurred specifically within the Laminariales but further analysis of the enzymatic activities of proteins from other orders will be necessary to determine if substrate specialisation was concomitant with this specific gene family expansion.\n\nThe number of transcription-associated protein (TAP) genes has remained relatively stable during the diversification of the brown algae (Figures 4A, S7A and S7B). This contrasts with what has been observed for the green lineage, where size of TAP complement has been shown to be broadly correlated with morphological complexity86. Although the overall TAP complement has been stable, variations were detected in the sizes of some specific TAP families, including variations that correlated with the degree of morphological complexity. A broadly positive correlation was observed for the three-amino-acid length extension homeodomain (TALE HD) transcription factor (TF) families for example (Figure S11A, Table S16). These observations suggest that increased multicellular complexity in the brown algae may have required different combinations of TFs rather than simply increasing numbers. Two TALE HD TFs (OUROBOROS and SAMSARA) have been shown to be necessary for the deployment of the sporophyte developmental program in Ectocarpus species 787. The Ectocarpus species 7 TALE HD TF family consists of three genes which are conserved across the brown algae87 but we detected a modest expansion of the gene family in some members of the Fucales, which have acquired one or two additional paralogues of the third TALE HD TF (Figure S11B).\n\nThe Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU) plays an important role in the uptake of calcium into mitochondria and is highly conserved across the eukaryotes. It is therefore surprising that the Fucales, like diatoms88, have lost this transporter (Table S24) and it is unclear how Fucales and diatoms regulate mitochondrial calcium, as alternative mechanisms are not known. Cyclic nucleotide gated channels, which are only present at low copy number, also appear to have been lost from several brown algal lineages, including kelps. In contrast, TRP channels are found in all brown algal genomes and the gene family is massively expanded in some lineages (Table S24). In animals, TRP channels are primarily involved in sensory functions e.g. touch, temperature and ligand-based activation89, so the brown algal channels may play a role in sensing the environment. TRP channels have been lost in land plants, which show an expansion of CNGCs and GLRs90.\n\nFive orthogroups containing GTPases with a central Ras of complex proteins/C-terminal of Roc RocCOR domain tandem (ROCO GTPases) or nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by apoptotic protease-activating factor 1, R proteins and CED-4 tetratricopeptide repeat (NB-ARC-TPR) genes increased in size during brown algal evolution (Table S6). A role has been proposed for these gene families in biotic defence responses91 so the diversification of the gene families may have conferred important immunity characteristics.\n\nGenome changes associated with adaptation to freshwater environments\n\nA small number of brown algal species have adapted to freshwater habitats, with each adaptation event occurring independently. The Phaeoexplorer dataset includes genomes for four freshwater species in addition to the previously sequenced Ectocarpus subulatus9. Adaptation to a freshwater habitat was correlated with loss of orthogroups (Figure S3A) and clear reductions in the sizes of some key gene families such as haloperoxidases (Figures 4A and S6C). In terms of gene gain, 12 orthogroups were found to be consistently over-represented when the genomes of each of the five freshwater species were compared with those of related seawater species, including orthogroups with genes involved in membrane transport and signalling. A transcriptomic analysis of P. fluviatile grown in either seawater or freshwater conditions identified 1,328 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs), with the genes upregulated in freshwater being enriched in DNA replication regulation and transcription functions (Table S30). Comparison of the differentially regulated gene set with a similar set generated for E. subulatus indicated that both sets of DEGs were enriched in lineage-specific genes, suggesting that, to a large extent, each adaptation to freshwater involved lineage-specific innovations (Table S31). Furthermore, a focused comparative analysis of metabolic networks (https://gem-aureme.genouest.org/fwgem/; Figure S5G) indicated that both P. fluviatile and Pleurocladia lacustris have lost alginate lyases and a glycosyltransferase GT18, related to polysaccharide metabolism (Table S32). This is in line with previous work showing specific cell wall remodelling in E. subulatus92. P. fluviatile and P. lacustris have also lost genes encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and this may have impacted protein degradation and thus osmolarity, or be linked to the preferential activation of ubiquitin-independent regulatory mechanisms in situations of osmotic stress85. In addition to the shared gene losses, both species have independently lost genes. The strictly freshwater P. lacustris has lost several phosphatases, peptidases and aldolases, perhaps due to a reduced need to produce osmolytes, while the brackish water P. fluviatile has lost several enzymes related to phenol metabolism and a magnesium transporter. More surprisingly, the two species have lost different sets of enzymes involved in RNA modifications, which may either indicate convergent acquisition of different regulatory mechanisms, or may simply be markers of phylogenetic divergence.\n\nBrown algal genomes contain large amounts of inserted viral sequences\n\nFinally, we found evidence that the genetic content of brown algal genomes can be significantly impacted as a result of large DNA viruses of the Phaeovirus family integrating into the genomes as part of their lysogenic life cycles (Figure 6, Table S33). An analysis of 72 genomes in the Phaeoexplorer and associated public genome dataset identified a total of 792 viral regions (VRs) of Nucleocytoviricota (NCV) origin in 743 contigs, with a combined length of 32.3 Mbp. Individual VRs ranged in size from two to 705 kbp, but the majority (81.3 %) were between two and 50 kbp, whilst only 9% were longer than the expected minimum size (100 kbp) for an NCV genome. On average, VRs comprised 65% of their contig by length, and 72% of contigs with VRs were shorter than 100 kbp. Therefore, for most VRs, their true size and genomic context is unknown due to assembly gaps and short contig lengths. On average, each genome contained 469 kbp of VR (ranging from less than one to 5,614 kbp) and only two genomes contained no VRs (both from the Discosporangiales). There were a number of outlier genomes that contained more than 1,000 kbp of VRs (T. minus, S. latissima female, S. japonica, P. fluviatile and Myriotrichia clavaeformis male and female). The presence of key NCV marker genes was used to assess the completeness of inserted viral genomes. At least one partial provirus (a VR possessing several key NCV marker genes) was present in 39 genomes, 29 of which had at least one full provirus with a complete set of seven key NCV marker genes (Figure 6, Table S33). In addition to the previously known infections in Ectocarpales93 and Laminariales94, integrated NCV proviruses were found in all Phaeophyceae orders screened, except the Discosporangiales and Dictyotales, and were also detected in T. minus (Xanthophyceae). Moreover, NCV marker gene composition indicated that multiple integrated proviruses were present in 16 genomes from multiple Phaeophyceae orders (Ectocarpales, Desmarestiales, Sphacelariales, Tilopteridales, Laminariales), and the Xanthophyceae (Figure 6, Table S33). Phylogenetic analysis of the major coat protein (MCP) and DNA polymerase genes indicated that the majority of the integrated NCVs belonged to the genus Phaeovirus, the sole viral group known to infect brown algae. However, this analysis also revealed integrated sequences corresponding to other viral groups. Viral sequences in T. minus belonged to a putative novel genus closely related to Phaeovirus, for which we propose the name Xanthovirus. Finally, mimiviridae-related VRs were identified in S. latissima and Pelvetia canaliculata, but since they are partial proviruses and do not appear to possess integrase genes, they may have originated from ancient endogenization events, similar to those described in chlorophytes95. The identification of integrated NCV across almost all brown algal orders and in closely related sister taxa suggests that the lysogenic life cycle strategy of phaeoviruses is ancient and that giant viral genomes have been integrating into the genomes of brown algae throughout the latters‚Äô evolutionary history. This conclusion was supported by the phylostratigraphic analysis, which detected the appearance of many novel virus-related genes dating back to the origin of the Phaeophyceae (Figure 3A). Marked differences were detected in total VR size and NCV marker gene presence across the brown algal genome set, and large differences were even detected between strains from the same genus (between 24 and 992 kbp of VR in different Ectocarpus spp. for example; Figure 6, Table S33). These differences indicate dynamic changes in VR content over evolutionary time, presumably due, at least in part, to differences in rates of viral genome integration, a process that can involve multiple, separate insertion events96, and rates of VR loss due to meiotic segregation97. In addition, the abundant presence of partial proviruses and NCV fragments in brown algal genomes indicates that inserted VRs can degenerate and fragment, probably also leading to VR loss over time. It remains to be determined what mechanisms are responsible for eliminating and fragmenting inserted phaeoviruses. The identification of large-scale viral genome insertion events over such a long timescale (at least 450 My69) suggests that NCVs may have had a major impact on the evolution of brown algal genomes throughout the emergence of the lineage, making this a truly unique model system to investigate the impact of genomic exchanges on genome evolution.\n\nIn conclusion, changes in the gene content of brown algal genomes can be correlated with the diversification of the lineage and adaptation to diverse aquatic environments, a process that has involved changes in life cycle structure, the evolution of different levels of multicellular complexity and modifications to metabolic networks. There are also indications that the changes associated with adaptation have reciprocally impacted the evolution of the species‚Äô genomes via population genetic mechanisms. Finally, during the diversification of the brown algae, genome content has been significantly impacted by the insertion of phaeoviral sequences.\n\n4) Ongoing evolutionary processes: microevolution and speciation\n\nTo investigate short-term and ongoing evolutionary events in the brown algae, we sequenced 22 new strains from the genus Ectocarpus. Ectocarpus belongs to the order Ectocarpales, which emerged late in brown algal evolution but has become the most species-rich brown algal order, with over 750 species98. Therefore, although more morphologically complex organisms have evolved in other orders such as the Laminariales and the Fucales, the Ectocarpales are nonetheless of particular interest because they are a highly successful order in terms of species numbers. The genus Ectocarpus is a species complex in which 16 cryptic species have been identified99. Comparison of the high continuity Ectocarpus assemblies indicated that Ectocarpus spp. genomes share extensive synteny (Figure S12A, Table S34). In addition, intron sizes, phases and positions are strongly conserved across Ectocarpus species (Figure S12B). The Ectocarpales exhibited the same general phenomenon of orthogroup loss as the other Phaeophyceae orders. However, this trend was not uniform within the Ectocarpales and a period of orthogroup gain was predicted during the early emergence of the genus Ectocarpus (Figure 7A). The sets of both gained and conserved orthogroups were significantly enriched in transcription-related functions (Figure S12C). Analysis of the Ectocarpus species 7 reference genome orthologues indicated that rapidly-evolving, taxonomically-restricted genes (Group 5 based on the phylostratigraphy analysis: Table S5) are most abundant on the sex chromosome (Figure 7B), an observation that is consistent with other recent findings100. These Ectocarpus genus-specific genes exhibit higher dN and dS values than genes that the genus shares with other brown algae (Figure 7C, Table S35).\n\nA phylogenetic tree was constructed for 11 selected Ectocarpus species based on 257 high quality alignments of 1:1 orthologs (Figures 7D). This species tree is strongly supported, with all nodes displaying high posterior probabilities consistently reaching 0.99 or 1. The tree indicates substantial divergence between E. fasciculatus and two well-supported main clades, designated clade 1 and clade 2. Rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, based on alignments of genes in syntenic blocks between Ectocarpus species 7 and four other species correlated with relative divergence times as estimated from the phylogenetic tree (Table S35), supporting the tree topology. Incongruencies between the species tree and trees for individual genes indicated introgression events and/or incomplete lineage sorting across the Ectocarpus genus. This conclusion was supported by phylogenetic tree comparisons, Bayesian hierarchical clustering, phylogenetic network reconstructions and PCoA analysis (Figures 7D, S12D and S12E). D-statistic analysis, specifically ABBA-BABA tests, detected incongruities among species quartets, indicating potential gene flow at various times during the evolution of the Ectocarpus genus. Evidence for gene flow was particularly strong for clade 2 and there was also evidence for marked exchanges between the two main clades (Figure 7E), suggesting that gene flow has not been limited to closely-related species pairs. These findings suggest a complex evolutionary history involving rapid divergence, hybridization, and introgression among species within the Ectocarpus genus.\n\nIn conclusion, analysis of the genus Ectocarpus identified a number of evolutionary processes including gene gain and gene loss, emergence of new genes and gene flow within the genus underlining that genome evolution in the brown algae is an ongoing, dynamic process.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe genome resource presented in this study has provided an unprecedented overview of genomic diversity across the full scope of the brown algal lineage. Comparative analysis of these genomes has provided insights into brown algal genome evolution at multiple time-scales ranging from the early emergence of the lineage to recent evolutionary events at the genus level. These analyses identified a period of marked genome evolution concomitant with the emergence of the brown algal lineage involving enhanced levels of gene gain and the formation of genes with novel domain combinations. These early events were important in equipping the brown algal ancestor with key components of several metabolic pathways that were essential for their colonisation of intertidal and subtidal environments leading to the formation of the extensive underwater forests present worldwide today. These pathways notably include cell wall polysaccharide, phlorotannin and halogen metabolisms. The capacity to synthesise flexible and resilient alginate-based cell walls allows these organisms to resist the hydrodynamic forces of wave action101, whereas phlorotannins and halogen derivatives are thought to play important roles in defence102. There is also evidence that cell wall cross-linking by phlorotannins may be important for strong adhesion to substrata, another important characteristic in the dynamic intertidal and subtidal coastal environments103. The capacity to adhere strongly and resist both biotic and abiotic stress factors would have been essential for the success of large, sedentary multicellular organisms in these intertidal niches over evolutionary time.\n\nComparative analyses also identified changes in gene content and patterns of gene evolution associated with the diversification of the different brown algal orders that resulted in marked differences in life cycle structure, multicellular complexity and differences regarding specific biological features such as zoid flagellar structure. Notably, diversification of the brown algae was associated with modifications to the contents of several important gene families, including CAZYmes, LHCX, haloperoxidases, transcription factors and ion channels. Particularly marked changes were observed in the genomes of freshwater species, which have made a major transition from their ancestral marine habitats. Analysis of the genomes of multiple Ectocarpus species demonstrated that genomic modifications, including gene gain and gene loss have continued to occur up until the present time and indicated that these modifications can potentially be transmitted between species as a result of gene flow occurring within a genus due to incomplete reproductive boundaries and introgression.\n\nOverall, these analyses identified multiple processes that have contributed to brown algal genome evolution at different scales of evolutionary time. In addition to the evolution of taxonomically-restricted genes, we found evidence that genes have been acquired by HGT and also that domain shuffling has played an important role in the generation of genic novelty. Infection of brown algae by large DNA viruses of the Phaeovirus family has resulted in the introduction of a remarkable quantity of additional genetic material into brown algal genomes and this large quantity of integrated viral genes represents a considerable potential source for the evolution of novel genes through horizontal gene transfer.\n\nThe comparative genomic approaches used here have characterised changes in gene content and structure over the course of the evolutionary history of the brown algae and many of these changes have been correlated with the emergence of key biological characteristics of the lineage. With comprehensive tools and resources currently available for the model brown alga Ectocarpus104 plus the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9 methodology for brown algae105,106, it will now be possible to apply functional genomic approaches to validate and further investigate the roles of these genes in brown algal biological processes.\n\nIn addition, the Phaeoexplorer brown algal genome dataset represents an important new resource for brown algal research that will continue to be exploited using comparative genomic approaches coupled with gene function analyses. To facilitate future use of this genome resource, the annotated genomes have been made available through a website portal (https://phaeoexplorer.sb-roscoff.fr), which provides multiple additional resources including genome browsers, BLAST interfaces, transcriptomic data and metabolic networks.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nSoftware: L.B.G., R.D., A.L.B., X.L., D.N. and E.C.; Formal analysis: F.D., O.G., L.D., D.M., T.M., D.S., X.F., L.Ma., N.Te., J.B.R., R.P., L.R., S.W.C., J.J., K.U., K.B., C.Du., P.R., A.L., A.E.M., M.L., A.K., P.H.G., C.V., S.S.A., S.A., K.A., Y.B., T.Ba., A.Be., S.B., A.Bo., A.Cor., H.C.C., A.D., E.Di., S.D., E.Dr., J.G., L.G., A.G., M.L.G., L.H., B.H., A.J., E.K., C.B., R.L., P.J.L., E.M., S.M., G.M., C.N., S.A.R., E.R., D.Sch., A.S., L.T., T.T., K.V., H.V., G.W., H.K., A.F.P., H.S.Y., C.H., N.Y., E.B., M.V., G.V.M., E.C., S.M.C., J.M.A. and J.M.C; Investigation: C.C., S.H., Z.N., N.Ta., A.Cou., B.N., W.B., E.De., C.J., L.Me., S.R. and D.Sco.; Resources: O.G., A.Cou., L.B.G., T.Br., R.A.C., C.De., S.F., W.J.H., G.H., K.K., A.L.B., K.M., C.M., N.P., P.P., S.R., D.Sco., H.V., F.W., H.K., A.F.P., M.V., E.C. and J.M.A.; Data Curation: O.G., C.C., A.Cou., L.B.G., J.M.A. and J.M.C.; Writing-Original Draft: F.D., O.G., J.M.A. and J.M.C.; Writing-Review & Editing: all authors; Visualization: F.D., O.G., L.B.G., L.D., D.M., T.M., D.S., X.F., L.Ma., J.B.R., R.P., L.R., K.U., K.B., P.R., A.L., M.L., P.H.G., C.V., A.D., A.L.B., H.K., E.C. and J.M.C.; Supervision: O.G., N.Te., M.L., R.A.C., H.C.C., O.D.C., S.D., G.H., A.J., C.B., E.P., P.L., S.A.R., A.S., L.T., H.V., G.W., H.K., H.S.Y., C.H., N.Y., E.B., M.V., G.V.M., E.C., S.M.C., J.M.A. and J.M.C.; Project administration: F.D., E.B., M.V., G.V.M., E.C., S.M.C., P.W., J.M.A. and J.M.C.; Funding acquisition: H.C.C., C.B., P.P., C.H., N.Y., S.M.C. and J.M.C.; Conceptualization: J.M.C.\n\nSupplementary tables\n\nTable S1.

Mark Cock (cock@sb-roscoff.fr).\n\nMaterials availability\n\nAll the laboratory-cultivated strains grown to provide material for genome sequencing can be accessed via the Roscoff Culture Collection (https://www.roscoff-culture-collection.org).\n\nData and code availability\n\nAll sequence data, including DNA and RNA sequencing data, have been deposited in the EBI/ENA database under the following project PRJEB72149 and will be publicly available as of the date of publication.\n\nThis paper does not report original code.\n\nAny additional information required to reanalyse the data reported in this paper is available from the lead contact upon request.\n\nMETHOD DETAILS\n\nBiological material\n\nThe algal strains analysed in this study are listed in Table S1A. All strains except those belonging to the Fucales were grown under laboratory conditions. The latter cannot be maintained long-term in the laboratory so field material was harvested for extractions. The haploid gametophyte generation was grown in culture for species with characterised haploid-diploid life cycles, with the exception of Ectocarpus strains, for which haploid partheno-sporophytes or diploid sporophytes were cultivated. All cultures were grown either in 140 mm diameter Petri dishes or in 2‚Äì10 L bottles, the latter aerated by bubbling with sterile air. Most cultures were grown in Provosoli-enriched23 natural seawater (PES medium) under fluorescent white light (10‚Äì30 ŒºM photons/m2‚ãÖs) at 13¬∞C (or at 10¬∞C for Hapterophycus canaliculatus and Chordaria linearis or 20¬∞C for Sphacelaria rigidula, Dictyota dichotoma, Schizocladia ischiensis and Chrysoparadoxa australica). Exceptions included the freshwater species Pleurocladia lacustris, Porterinema fluviatile and Heribaudiella fluviatilis, which were grown in natural seawater that had been diluted to 5% with distilled water (i.e., 95% distilled water / 5% seawater) before addition of ES medium (http://sagdb.uni-goettingen.de/culture_media/01%20Basal%20Medium.pdf) micronutrients (at 20¬∞C for P. lacustris) and Phaeothamnion wetherbeei, which was grown in MIEB12 (medium 7 in81). Whole thallus was extracted for all species except the Fucales, where either dissected meristematic regions or released male gametes were extracted.\n\nDNA extraction\n\nDNA was extracted using either the OmniPrep Genomic DNA Purification Kit (G Biosciences, St. Louis, MO, USA) or the Nucleospin Plant II midi DNA Extraction Kit (Macherey-Nagel, D√ºren, Germany). DNA quality was assessed using a Qubit fluorometer (Themo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and fragment length was assessed by migration on a 1% agarose gel for some of the samples.\n\nIllumina library preparation and sequencing\n\nLibraries were prepared using the NEBNext DNA Modules Products (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) with an ‚Äòon bead‚Äô protocol developed by Genoscope, starting with 100 ng of genomic DNA. DNA was sonicated to a 100‚Äì800 bp size range using a Covaris E220 sonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA), end-repaired and 3‚Ä≤-adenylated. Illumina adapters (Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX, USA) were then added using the NEBNext Sample Reagent Set (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and purified using Ampure XP (Beckmann Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA, USA). Adapted fragments were amplified by 12 cycles of PCR using the Kapa Hifi Hotstart NGS library Amplification kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), followed by 0.8x AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA, USA) purification. Libraries were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq, HiSeq 4000 or NovaSeq 6000 instruments (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in paired-end mode, 150 base read-length.\n\nOxford Nanopore library preparation and sequencing\n\nSome samples were first purified using the Short Read Eliminator Kit (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). All libraries were prepared using the protocol ‚Äú1D Genomic DNA by Ligation‚Äù provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd, Oxford, UK). Most of the libraries were prepared with the SQK-LSK109 kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), a few with the SQK-LSK108 or SQK-LSK110 kits (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Three flow cells were loaded with barcoded samples. The samples were mainly sequenced on R9.4.1 MinION or PromethION flow cells.\n\nRNA extraction, Illumina RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing\n\nRNA was extracted using either the Qiagen RNeasy kit or the Macherey Nagel RNAplus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D√ºren, Germany). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep (Illumina) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol, starting with 500 ng to 1 ¬µg of total RNA, or using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep for Illumina (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol, starting with 100 ng of total RNA. The libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500, HiSeq 4000 or NovaSeq 6000 instruments (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), in paired-end mode, 150 base read-length.\n\nAssembly strategies\n\nTwo assembly strategies were employed (Figure S13): one was designed for genomes exclusively sequenced using short reads with Illumina technology, while the other was designed for genomes that underwent sequencing using a combination of long and short reads, using respectively the Nanopore and Illumina technologies.\n\nShort-read-based genome assembly\n\nWhen sequencing was performed exclusively using short reads, reads corresponding to bacterial contaminants were filtered out early in the assembly process (Figure S13A) because, typically, the initial datasets were too large to run assemblers like SPAdes. To remove bacterial contaminants, an assembly based on the initial illumina dataset was first generated for each strain using a fast and non-greedy algorithm, MEGAHIT1 version 1.1.1 with the parameters --k-min 101 --k-max 131 --k-step 10. Assigning taxonomy is easier when working with contigs than with reads. Contigs exceeding 500 bp in each preliminary assembly underwent taxonomic classification based on gene models predicted using the ab initio software MetaGene2 version 2008.8.19 with default parameters and then aligning proteins against UniprotKB using BLASTp (e-value <10e‚àí4). A superkingdom (Eukaryota, Archaea or Bacteria) was assigned to each gene based on the best alignment (selected using the BLASTp score). Contigs that contained more than 50% of their genes assigned to Bacteria and with at least one gene every 10 Kbp were classified as bacterial sequences. For each strain, the initial Illumina sequencing reads were aligned against the corresponding bacterial sequences using latest version of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner4 (BWA) with default parameters and mapped short-reads were labelled as contaminants, and assembled for the purpose of obtaining more contiguous contigs. These bacterial contigs were then used to build a contaminant sequence database. Finally, the clean subset of reads was obtained by aligning the whole Illumina dataset against this strain-specific bacterial contig database, using Bowtie25 version 2.2.9 with default parameters. A final assembly was then generated for each strain using the contaminant-free read datasets and the SPAdes6 assembler version 3.8.1 with the parameters -k 21,57,71,99,127 -m 2000 --only-assembler --careful. Genome assemblies based only on short-reads were more fragmented (N50 ranged from 3 Kbp to 31 Kbp) than assemblies that used long reads but the sizes of the former were consistent with expectations.\n\nLong-read-based genome assemblies\n\nA subset of the strains produced DNA of both adequate quality and quantity, enabling successful long-read sequencing. In these cases, long reads were assembled directly and the detection of possible bacterial contigs was carried out after the assembly step (Figure S13B). To produce long-read-based genome assemblies we generated three samples of reads i) all reads, ii) 30X coverage of the longest reads and iii) 30X coverage of the filtlong (https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong) highest-score reads. The three samples were used as input data for four different assemblers, Smartdenovo7, Redbean8, Flye9 and Necat10. Based on the cumulative size and contiguity, we selected the best assembly for each strain. This assembly was then polished three times using Racon11 with Nanopore reads, and twice with Hapo-G12 and Illumina PCR-free reads.\n\nAssembly decontamination\n\nContigs from the short- and long-read genome assemblies were then inspected for potential bacterial sequences. This process was carried out using a combination of several analysis and tools: GC composition, read coverage, Metabat 2 (for tetramer composition and clustering)13 and Metagene (for gene prediction and taxonomic identification, as described previously). Contigs were manually removed based on their characteristics.\n\nTranscriptome assembly\n\nRibosomal-RNA-like reads were detected using SortMeRNA14 and filtered out. The Illumina RNA-Seq short reads from each strain were assembled using Velvet15 version 1.2.07 and Oases16 version 0.2.08 with kmer sizes of 61, 63 and 65 bp. BUSCO74 analysis (v5, eukaryota_odb10) was then performed on the three resulting assemblies for each strain in order to select the best assembly, i.e. the most complete at the gene level. Reads were mapped back to the contigs with BWA-mem, and only consistent paired-end reads were retained. Uncovered regions were detected and used to identify chimeric contigs. In addition, open reading frames (ORF) and domains were identified using TransDecoder (Haas, B.J., https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder) and CDDsearch17, respectively. Contigs were broken into uncovered regions outside ORFs and domains. In addition, read strand information was used to correctly orient RNA-Seq contigs.\n\nDe novo transcriptomes\n\nThe RNA-seq data was also used to generate de novo transcriptomes. For each strain, all the RNA-seq data available was cleaned for sequencing quality and presence of adapter sequences using Trimmomatic18 v0.39 prior to being assembled using either Trinity19 version v2.6.5 or rnaSPAdes20 version v3.13.1. The strandness and Kmer-length parameters of the assemblers were adjusted to take into account RNA-seq read characteristics. The de novo transcriptomes represented an alternative source to identify and characterise genes if they were not detected in the genome assemblies.\n\nDetection and masking of repeated sequences and transposons\n\nPrior to gene annotation, each genome assembly was masked based on the repeat library from Ectocarpus species 7 (formerly Ectocarpus siliculosus)82 and using RepBase with RepeatMasker21 version v.4.1.0, default parameters. Tandem repeats finder (TRF)22 was also used to mask tandem repeat duplications. In addition, transposons were annotated in ten species using REPET23 and the transposons detected were used as a reference to mask all genomes with RepeatMasker21 version v4.1.0, default parameters.\n\nGene prediction\n\nFor each strain, gene prediction was performed using both homologous proteins and RNA-seq data. Proteins from Ectocarpus species 7 (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/overview/EctsiV2)83 and UniRef90 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniref/) were aligned against each genome assembly. First, BLAT24 with default parameters was used to quickly localise putative genes corresponding to the Ectocarpus species 7 proteins. The best match and matches with a score ‚â• 90% of the best match score were retained. Second, the alignments were refined using Genewise25 with default parameters, which is more precise for intron/exon boundary detection. Alignments were retained if more than 80% of the length of the protein was aligned to the genome. To detect conserved proteins and allow detection of horizontal gene transfer, UniRef90 proteins (without E. siliculosus sequences) were aligned with DIAMOND26 v0.9.30 with parameters --evalue 0.001 --more-sensitive to genomic regions lacking alignments with an Ectocarpus species 7 protein. Only the five best matches per locus were retained, based on their bitscore. Selected proteins from UniRef90 were aligned to the whole genome using Genewise as described previously, and alignments with at least 50% of the aligned protein length were retained. The assembled transcriptome for each strain was aligned to the strain‚Äôs genome assembly using BLAT24 with default parameters. For each transcript, the best match was selected based on the alignment score, with an identity greater or equal to 90%. Selected alignments were refined using Est2Genome27 in order to precisely detect intron boundaries. Alignments were retained if more than 80% of the length of the transcript was aligned to the genome with a minimal identity of 95%. Finally, the protein homologies and transcript mapping were integrated using a combiner called Gmove28. This tool can find coding sequences (CDSs) based on genome-located evidence without any calibration step. Briefly, putative exons and introns, extracted from the alignments, were used to build a simplified graph by removing redundancies. Then, Gmove extracted all paths from the graph and searched for open reading frames (ORFs) consistent with the protein evidence. Translated proteins of predicted genes were then aligned against NR prot (release 19/02/2019) and the Ectocarpus species 7 version v2 proteome83 (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/overview/EctsiV2) using DIAMOND BLASTp with parameters --evalue 10-5 --more-sensitive --unal 0. All predicted genes with significant matches (the smallest protein had to be aligned for at least 50% of its length) were retained. In addition to these genes, we also retained genes with CDS size greater than 300 bp and with a coding ratio (CDS size / mRNA size) greater or equal to 0.5.\n\nAnnotation decontamination\n\nAfter predicting the genes, an additional analysis was carried out to detect bacterial sequences. If a contig did not contain any genes, it was analysed with MetaGene and the predicted proteins added to the gene catalogue for the purpose of detecting bacterial sequences. Proteins generated from predicted genes (Gmove plus MetaGene) were then aligned against UniprotKB using BLASTp (e-value < 10e‚àí4) and superkingdom (Eukaryota, Archaea or Bacteria) was assigned to each gene based on the best alignment (selected using the BLASTp score). Contigs that contained more than 80% of their genes assigned to bacteria, Archaea or viruses were classified as bacterial sequences and removed from the final assembly file. Genes belonging to these contigs were also removed from the final gene catalogue. Finally, completeness of each predicted gene catalogue was assessed using BUSCO74 (v5.0.0; eukaryota_odb10).\n\nIn addition, the quality of the annotations was assessed by comparing the length of coding regions in pairs of orthologous proteins (best reciprocal hits) between each genome and Ectocarpus species 7, which was used as a reference because its high-quality annotation has been extensively curated83. The correlation between orthologous CDS lengths was higher for genomes sequenced with long reads than for genomes only sequenced with short reads (Figure S1A). This difference was probably principally due to a higher proportion of underestimated protein lengths in the latter (Table S1B) which likely corresponded to fragmented genes. The qualities of Ectocarpales genome annotations were very high (BUSCO and length of predicted CDS) even when the genomes were sequenced using only short reads, probably because their phylogenetic proximity to Ectocarpus species 7 facilitated the building of good quality gene models.\n\nAnalyses aimed at deducing functional characteristics of predicted proteins\n\nSeveral different analyses of the predicted proteomes of each species were carried out to provide information about the cellular functions of the encoded proteins. These included eggNOG-mapper41 analyses (v2.1.8 or v2.0.1, with emapperDB v5.0.2 or v4.5.1) to provide multiple functional annotations (Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes, Clusters of Orthologous Genes, Pfam), Interproscan50 analyses (versions v5.55-88.0, v5.51-85.0 or v5.36-75.0) to detect functional domains, Hectar72 (v1.3) predictions of protein subcellular localisation and various DIAMOND26 (v2.0.15 vs UniRef90 2022_03, with parameter ‚Äúevalue‚Äù set to 10e‚àí5) sequence similarity searches aimed at identifying homologous proteins with functional annotations.\n\nDetection of tandemly duplicated genes\n\nStarting with the protein alignments that had been constructed to build the orthogroups, matches between proteins within the same genome with an e-value of ‚â§10‚àí20 and which covered at least 80% of the smallest protein were extracted. Two genes were considered to be tandemly duplicated if they were localised on the same genomic contig separated by five or less intervening genes, regardless of their orientation. The tandemly-duplicated genes were clustered using a single linkage clustering approach. A binomial test was applied to compare the proportion of tandemly-duplicated genes in each orthogroup with the global proportion of tandemly-duplicated genes (p=0.0532792). The p-values are shown in table S6.\n\nRelative orientation of adjacent genes and lengths of intergenic regions\n\nFor each species, the proportion of pairs of adjacent genes localized on opposite strands was compared to the expected proportion of 0.5 using a binomial test (with p=0.5). The p-values are shown in Table S1 (p-values of <0.05 correspond to cases where the proportion is significantly higher than 0.5).\n\nThe lengths of intergenic regions between pairs of adjacent genes located on opposite strands (i.e. divergently or convergently transcribed) were compared with the lengths of intergenic regions between genes located on the same strand (i.e. transcribed in the same direction). Contingency tables were constructed for each species using a threshold of 1000 bp for the intergenic length and the number of intergenic regions in each of four categories were counted: 1) same strand genes, intergenic <1000 bp, 2) opposite strand genes, intergenic <1000 bp, 3) same strand genes, intergenic ‚â•1000 bp, 4) opposite strand genes, intergenic ‚â•1000 bp. Fisher exact tests were applied to the contingency tables (alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is greater than 1). The p-values are shown in Table S1. When p-values are <0.05, short intergenic lengths are significantly associated with pairs of genes on opposite strands. All calculations were performed with R91 (version 4.3.0).\n\nDetection of long non-coding RNAs\n\nTranscriptome data for 11 species (Table S36), including nine brown algal strains and two outgroup taxa, was analysed to identify lncRNAs. Any transcripts with invalid nucleotide DNA symbols were discarded and sequences shorter than 200 nucleotides were removed to avoid the detection of small RNA transcripts. The transcriptome sequences in Fasta format were analysed with votingLNC (https://gitlab.com/a.debit/votinglnc) to detect lncRNA transcripts and assign a confidence level for each transcript. A similar approach was used to detect lncRNAs in the lncPlankton database84. VotingLNC is a meta-classifier combining the predictions of the ten most commonly used coding potential tools. Based on a majority voting ensemble procedure, the meta-tool assigns the final coding potential class to a transcript as the class label predicted most frequently by the ten classification models included in the ensemble. Alongside the majority voting class, a reliability score was calculated for each transcript. A cut-off non-coding reliability score of p > 0.5 was chosen to treat a transcript as lncRNA and to decrease false-positive identification. The set of transcripts predicted as lncRNA by the majority-voting procedure and having an ORF(s) encoding peptide(s) with length ‚â• 100aa were discarded. lncRNA transcripts that had significant matches in either the Pfam79 (hmmscan e-value < 0.001) or SwissProt (BLASTp e-value < 1e‚àí5 and similarity ‚â• 90%) databases were removed from the dataset. Transcript length, GC content, and the length of the longest ORF were compared between lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs. The comparison was carried out using a Wilcoxon test. R version V.4.1.2 was used for all the analyses and ggplot2 (V.3.4.0) for plotting.\n\nPhylogenomic tree of the Phaeophyceae\n\nTo provide a phylogenetic framework for the analyses of the Phaeoexplorer genome dataset, the 41-species phylogenomic tree reported by Akita et al.85 was updated by adding 15 additional species using the same methodology. Briefly, for the additional species, amino acid sequences were recovered for the 32 single-copy orthologous genes used to construct the published tree and these were aligned manually with the existing sequences using the alignment software AliView29 v.1.26. The aligned sequences of the final 56 species were concatenated and maximum likelihood analysis was carried out with 10,000 rapid bootstraps using RAxML30 v.8.2.9 and the gamma model. The best-fit evolutionary model for each gene was determined using AIC.\n\nDetection of orthologous groups\n\nPredicted proteins from the 60 strains sequenced in Phaeoexplorer complemented with 16 public proteomes covering the Ochrophytina subphylum and the terrestrial oomycetes were clustered using OrthoFinder31 v2.5.2 with default parameters. This generated 56,340 orthogroups that contained 90.1% of the proteins (1,415,341 of the 1,571,648). Seventy-one of the 76 strains had more than 75% of their proteins in an orthogroup shared with at least one other strain. Those orthogroups contained between 2 and 6,220 proteins with a mean of 25.1 proteins and a median of three.\n\nDollo analysis of orthogroup gain and loss\n\nAn analysis of evolutionary events of gene family gain and loss was carried out on a selection of strains covering the brown algal phylogeny and sister groups as distant as the Raphidophyceae under the Dollo parsimony law using orthogroups as proxies for gene families. To limit possible problems due to the fragmentation of predicted proteins in some assemblies, we selected 24,410 orthogroups present in at least one of 17 strains that had both good quality genome assembly and good quality gene predictions. Dollo parsimony analysis was then run using Count32 version v9.1106 based on a cladogram of a subset of 24 species representative of the Phaeoexplorer project and excluding all public outgroups more distant than Heterosigma akashiwo. The cladogram was based on the topology of the brown algae phylogenetic tree published by Akita et al.85.\n\nIntron conservation\n\nIntron positions were compared in a set of single copy genes that are conserved across all the Phaeophyceae and the outgroup species. The analysis focused on the 21 reference genomes (Table S36) and on orthogroups that occurred exactly once in at least 20 of the 21 genomes, allowing the gene to be absent from only one of the 21 genomes. In addition, orthogroups were discarded if more than three copies had been annotated in the other Phaeophyceae genomes. These filters produced a set of 235 conserved (ancestral) orthogroups. Multiple alignments were carried out for each orthogroup using MUSCLE33 version 3.8.1551 with default parameters and conserved blocks were identified with Gblocks52 version 0.91b with the parameters -p=t -s=n -b5=a -b2=[nsp] -b1=[nsp] -b3=6, where ‚Äúnsp‚Äù is equal to 90% of the number of proteins aligned. A shell script was then used to compare intron positions in the alignments. For each intron in the multiple sequence alignment, we obtained a corresponding conservation profile listing which species contains an intron at that position. The profiles obtained for the 949 introns that are in conserved blocks of the multiple alignments are shown in Figure 2C. Both phase and length of ancestral introns (e.g. that were conserved in most Phaeophyceae and at least two sister clades) were compared to the phase and length of Ectocarpus species 7 introns as a reference. The same approach was used to compare intron positions across 11 Ectocarpus species, with Scytosiphon promiscuus as an outgroup, by selecting 831 conserved monocopy orthogroups.\n\nDetection of gene family amplifications\n\nA binomial test with a parameter of 17/21 was carried out to detect gene families (OGs) that had significantly expanded in 17 Phaeophyceae reference genomes compared with four outgroup species (Table S36). Expanded gene families deviated significantly from the expected proportion (17/21 under the null hypothesis where there are equal gene numbers in all species). Benjamini‚ÄìHochberg FDR correction for multiple testing was then applied and 233 candidate OGs with corrected p-values of < 0.001 were retained. All calculations were pe"
