        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nChild sex offending (CSO) has disastrous effects on children’s mental well-being and development that persist into adulthood [Reference Kessler, McLaughlin, Green, Gruber, Sampson and Zaslavsky1] and may lead to structural and functional changes in children’s brains [Reference Tomoda, Navalta, Polcari, Sadato and Teicher2, Reference Heim, Mayberg, Mletzko, Nemeroff and Pruessner3]. The average estimate of the prevalence of CSO is 12.7% in self-report studies, with female victims being more than twice as common as male victims [Reference Stoltenborgh, van Ijzendoorn, Euser and Bakermans-Kranenburg4]. Paedophilia and CSO must not be considered synonymous [Reference Seto5]; however paedophilic preference is a major contributing factor to CSO (present in about 50% of convicted offenders) [Reference Seto5, Reference Whitaker, Le, Karl Hanson, Baker, McMahon and Ryan6]. The ICD-10 defines paedophilia as “A sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of pre-pubertal or early pubertal age” that persists for at least six months [7, p. 171]. In the DSM-5, a diagnosis can only be made if a person with this preference has acted upon these urges or if they have caused ‘marked distress or interpersonal difficulty’ [Reference American Psychiatric Association8, p. 697]. The prevalence of paedophilia or paedophilic disorder in the sense of these definitions is not known. However, some sexual interest in children (in the form of more or less frequent, intense and persistent sexual fantasies or thoughts involving children) is not rare in the general population. Based on extrapolation from large Finish and German surveys of convenience samples Seto estimated the upper limit for the prevalence of paedophilia in this latter sense at around 1% [Reference Seto9].\n\nThis already points to the prime importance of clearly defining the matter at hand and leads to the starting point of our study: Findings on the aetiology of paedophilia and CSO may largely depend on the exact composition of experimental and control group and, more specifically, on the degree to which authors manage to isolate the effect of sexual preference from the effect of offender status. For example, the currently most popular theory on the origins of paedophilia, the so-called hypothesis of ‘early neurodevelopmental perturbations’ states that paedophilia is a “neurologic phenomenon with prenatal origin”’ and “an innate neurologically-mediated characteristic” [Reference Cantor, Lafaille, Hannah, Kucyi, Soh and Girard10, p. 1546]. This hypothesis has originally been based on findings regarding elevated rates of non-right-handedness, lower intelligence quotients, worse executive functioning, and higher incidence of childhood head injuries resulting in unconsciousness in paedophiles [Reference Blanchard, Christensen, Strong, Cantor, Kuban and Klassen11–Reference Cantor, Blanchard, Christensen, Dickey, Klassen and Beckstead13]. In the following, it has also been supported by many of the research it prompted in the area of structural and functional brain imaging (cf. [Reference Mohnke, Muller, Amelung, Krueger, Ponseti and Schiffer14] for an overview). However, the samples included in this research have been composed in large parts (and often even exclusively) of the subgroup of paedophiles who had already been involved with the criminal system, thereby mixing up factors associated with sexual preference and offender status cf. [Reference Gerwinn, Pohl, Granert, van Eimeren, Wolff and Jansen15]. In fact, virtually all studies on the characteristics of paedophilic men published before the emergence of preventive treatment efforts such as the “Don't offend” project [Reference Beier, Ahlers, Goecker, Neutze, Mundt and Hupp16] in Germany suffer from the confounding of these two factors [Reference Seto17].\n\nOnly recently, a growing body of studies able to control for the offender status puts these earlier findings into question and implies that it might not be paedophilia per se which is associated with cognitive and neurological deficits, but rather acting out sexually (cf. [Reference Joyal18] for an overview). Many of these studies stem from the “NeMUP” research collaboration. “NeMUP” is the acronym of a German research consortium funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research and stands for Neural Mechanisms Underlying Paedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children. The aim of the “NeMUP” research collaboration is to elucidate and distinguish between the clinical, neuropsychological, neurobiological, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of paedophilia and CSO by analysing a sample of more than 340 participants using a two-factor design incorporating four groups. In this paper, we provide a detailed clinical profile of the study sample and analyse factors associating with CSO and sexual preference separately. More specifically, we collected data relevant to recent questions and theories about the aetiology of paedophilia and CSO [Reference Seto5, Reference Mohnke, Muller, Amelung, Krueger, Ponseti and Schiffer14, Reference Tenbergen, Wittfoth, Frieling, Ponseti, Walter and Walter19] including (the above-mentioned) neurodevelopmental perturbations [Reference Blanchard, Christensen, Strong, Cantor, Kuban and Klassen11–Reference Cantor, Blanchard, Christensen, Dickey, Klassen and Beckstead13], adverse childhood experiences (relevant to the so-called ‘sexually abused – sexual abuser’ hypothesis) [Reference Garland, Dougher and Feierman20, Reference Jespersen, Lalumière and Seto21], personality traits, psychiatric comorbidities, familial risk factors, and sexual and behavioural problems such as higher sex drive or social deficits [Reference Whitaker, Le, Karl Hanson, Baker, McMahon and Ryan6]. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale clinical study to differentiate clearly between paedophilia and child sex offending in doing so. Earlier studies have often mixed up the factors sexual preference and offence status by either only including paedophiles with a history of CSO or by investigating child sex offenders regardless of their sexual preferences. Many of the factors reported as being related to paedophilia may therefore actually be associated with committing child sex offences and vice versa. We think that our study succeeded in disentangling both factors. In an exploratory approach in which a large set of variables was investigated, it thereby gives an overview of putative risk and protective factors linked to the aetiology of paedophilia and CSO, as well as of mechanism underlying both phenomena.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis is the first large scale clinical investigation to differentiate between paedophiles and non-paedophiles with and without a history of child sexual offending. This allowed us to identify factors associated specifically with sexual preference or offender status. However, our results have to be considered as being of preliminary nature only, as they are based on exploratory analyses (i.e. not corrected for multiple comparisons).\n\nComparisons of offenders and non-offenders revealed clear-cut group differences in age, intelligence, educational level and childhood history of sexual abuse, and most of these variables also helped differentiate between offenders and non-offenders in the regression analysis. Comparisons of paedophilic and non-paedophilic men (regardless of offender status) revealed small differences in a range of sexual characteristics (e.g., additional paraphilias, onset and current level of sexual activity) which also differentiated between paedophiles and non-paedophiles in the regression analysis. In many other theory-driven group comparisons (e.g., regarding intelligence or educational level), however, the differences between controls and non-paedophilic offenders were larger than those between either of these two (non-paedophilic) groups and either of the two paedophilic groups.\n\nAt least with respect to those characteristics assumingly associated with neurodevelopmental perturbations we examined in our study, the sexual preference factor (i.e., paedophilic or not) appears as less decisive than the currently most popular hypothesis on the origins of paedophilia might suggest. We were, for example, not able to replicate findings of significantly increased rates of non-right-handedness or childhood accidents resulting in unconsciousness in paedophiles [cf. Reference Blanchard, Christensen, Strong, Cantor, Kuban and Klassen11–Reference Cantor, Blanchard, Christensen, Dickey, Klassen and Beckstead13]. And significantly higher rates of childhood bed-wetting and maternal psychiatric burden were only found comparing paedophilic groups with the control group, not with the group of non-paedophilic child sex offenders.\n\nGroup comparisons of our study do, however, indicate an accumulation of sexual anomalies (cf. [Reference Crooks, Baur, Crooks and Baur46]) in both paedophilic groups: regardless of offender status, paedophiles reported higher rates of additional paraphilias and higher sexual desire than controls and non-paedophilic child sex offenders. Total number of sexual outlets per week, sexual excitation score and the rate of sexual sadism were significantly higher in the P-CSO group than in any other group and we also found trends towards differences between the P + CSO group and the two non-paedophilic groups with respect to the first two variables, while age at first masturbation and ejaculation was especially low in the P + CSO group. These results may be interpreted in the light of studies which report strong associations between paraphilic interests in general and sex drive or one of its proxy variables (e.g., number of sexual partners, rates of sexual behaviour, or sexual preoccupation [Reference Dawson, Bannerman and Lalumièrecf. 47]). However, none of the above-mentioned sexual characteristics examined in this study discriminated consistently between the paedophilic and non-paedophilic groups in post-hoc group comparisons, so these results are suggestive, rather than providing clear evidence that the sexual perturbations reported by paedophiles in this study are implicated in the aetiology of paedophilia.\n\nIf one nevertheless assumes a higher sex drive in the two paedophilic groups of this study, the question remains why one subgroup (P-CSO) is able to refrain from acting out sexually while the other (P + CSO) is not. There were some variables that clearly distinguished between offenders and non-offenders (regardless if paedophilic or not), including educational level, mean total intelligence score and verbal intelligence subscores. Other studies have reported lower intelligence and educational attainment in paedophiles in general and these findings have been linked to the hypothesis of neurodevelopmental perturbations [Reference Blanchard, Christensen, Strong, Cantor, Kuban and Klassen11–Reference Cantor, Blanchard, Christensen, Dickey, Klassen and Beckstead13, Reference Blanchard, Watson, Choy, Dickey, Klassen and Kuban48], but we were unable to replicate them. In fact, because we differentiated between offender status and sexual age preference, we were able to show that lower intelligence and lower educational level were associated with CSO rather than with paedophilia per se. Although the earlier studies had larger samples, these consisted mainly of offenders, making it difficult to disentangle sexual preference factors from those associating with offending [Reference Whitaker, Le, Karl Hanson, Baker, McMahon and Ryan6].\n\nIt is important to notice that these earlier studies on the hypothesis of neurodevelopmental perturbations are also different from the present study in that they used penile plethysmography for establishing study groups while we used subjective self-reports given in semi-structured interviews. One might therefore consider the group assignment of earlier studies as more objective and valid. However, we believe that self-reports also offer high validity if they are assessed outside the correctional setting and the climate of “panic and hysteria” [Reference Miller49, p. 507] fuelled by mandatory reporting laws. It would still be best if future studies used a combination of different data sources in establishing study groups in order to rule out possible confounding factors inherent to the current study design.\n\nAnother variable that distinguished between offenders and non-offenders was the sexual abuse subscale of the CTQ [Reference Bernstein and Fink36]. We endorse the argument that self-reported rates of childhood abuse may be artificially inflated in offenders [Reference Jespersen, Lalumière and Seto21, Reference Stirpe and Stermac50] due to e.g., an increased propensity to report a personal history of childhood sexual abuse after having committed CSO as a ‘quasi-excuse’ [Reference Freund, Watson and Dickey51, p. 567]. However, our result corroborates a recent internet study by Bailey, Bernhard and Hsu [Reference Bailey, Bernhard and Hsu52] which also found that men with a history of childhood sexual abuse reported significantly higher rates of child sexual offending than men without such experience. Bailey and colleagues only tested men who were sexually attracted to children, whereas we also included groups of non-paedophilic child sex offenders and non-offenders and so were able to differentiate between participants on the basis of both offender status and sexual preference in testing the ‘sexually abused – sexual abuser’ hypothesis. This differentiation indicates that a history of childhood sexual abuse may increase the propensity to engage in CSO, but not the likelihood of developing paedophilia. It thereby adds to former studies testing the ‘sexually abused – sexual abuser’ hypothesis in paedophilic men (e.g., [Reference Garland, Dougher and Feierman20, Reference Freund, Watson and Dickey51, Reference Freund and Kuban53]), which, to our knowledge, have so far only included offenders, but at least partly propagate a link between own child sexual abuse and paedophilia, thereby mixing up the factors sexual preference and offence status [Reference Whitaker, Le, Karl Hanson, Baker, McMahon and Ryan6, Reference Jespersen, Lalumière and Seto21].\n\nWhen it comes to other potential risk factors for CSO the picture is complex. Contrary to predictions derived from earlier studies [Reference Hall Ryan and Hall Richard54], we found no evidence of a lack of empathy in offenders. Offenders actually had higher scores on the empathetic concern subscale of the German adaption of the IRI [Reference Davis41] than the control group. Also, rather unexpectedly, the total number of sexual outlets per week was significantly lower in the CSO-P group than in any other group and was also lower in the P + CSO than in the P-CSO group. Taken together with the elevated rates of sexual desire disorders in both offending groups we may conclude from this that sex drive was lowest in the two offending groups in our sample. This contradicts existing theories about routes to CSO, especially CSO in non-paedophilic men [Reference Whitaker, Le, Karl Hanson, Baker, McMahon and Ryan6], but we cannot rule out the possibility that this result is due to a systematic bias in imprisonment status between the offending (P + CSO and CSO-P) and non-offending (P-CSO and HC) groups in our sample. Men who were in prison at the time of the study may have been more inclined to give socially desirable responses.\n\nThe significant differences in age between offenders and non-offenders may also have influenced the results. There was a difference of almost six years between the mean age of offending and non-offending paedophiles in our sample, which might encourage one to speculate that in paedophilic men offending behaviour is simply a matter of time and access to children. This interpretation is consistent with a study reporting significant correlations between child sexual offending and age, frequency of working with children, and frequency of falling in love with children [Reference Babchishin, Hanson and VanZuylen55]. In our sample the differences between offending and non-offending paedophiles however also included trait rather than state variables (e.g., intelligence, educational level, sexual excitability, several additional paraphilias and childhood history of sexual abuse) and the regression analyses indicated that some trait variables (namely educational level, sexual sadism and history of childhood sexual abuse) differentiated between offending and non-offending paedophiles (mean classification accuracy of 74%), as did impulsivity and history of childhood emotional and sexual abuse between offenders and non-offenders in general (76% mean classification accuracy). Overall these regression analyses therefore indicate that, at least in our sample, opportunity is not the only factor which differentiates non-offending (paedophilic) men from those who offend.\n\nOur finding that offending paedophiles reported more familial risk factors than non-offending paedophiles (e.g., higher rates of a maternal and paternal criminal history, emotional abuse and neglect, and physical abuse) accords well with theories of sexual offending against children [Reference Ward and Siegert56]. Offending paedophiles also reported lower rates of internalising behaviours (e.g., lower lifetime rates of mood disorders and Cluster C personality disorders) and higher rates of externalising behaviours (e.g., higher lifetime rates of psychoactive substance use disorders, Cluster B personality disorders and childhood conduct disorders; higher current BIS [Reference Patton, Stanford and Barratt40] impulsiveness and ADHS-SB [Reference Rösler, Retz-Junginger, Retz and Stieglitz38] hyperactivity) than non-offending paedophiles. However, we were not able to differentiate statistically between paedophiles with and without a history of CSO on the basis of any of these variables. Interestingly, however, values for most of the risk factors for CSO were higher in non-paedophilic than paedophilic offenders and post-hoc comparisons also revealed significant differences between these groups. More specifically, the CSO-P group reported significantly higher rates of childhood emotional abuse, neglect and physical abuse than any other group, as well as by far the greatest prevalence of paternal criminal history, and the lowest intelligence scores on the German WAIS [Reference Aster, Neubauer and Horn34]. Although overall rates of Cluster B personality disorders were similar in the CSO-P group and the other groups, at a descriptive level antisocial tendencies, Cluster A personality disorders (and more specifically paranoid personality disorder), lifetime history of axis I psychoactive substance use disorders and self-reported childhood sexual abuse and physical neglect were all more frequent in the CSO-P group than in any other group. These results suggest that a wide range of risk factors for CSO are more frequently found in non-paedophilic child sex offenders than in paedophilic child sex offenders or non-offenders [Reference Whitaker, Le, Karl Hanson, Baker, McMahon and Ryan6].\n\nMost relevant from a clinical point of view are the high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, cluster B and cluster C personality disorders and sexual dysfunctions among the clinical/offender groups. All three groups differed significantly from the control group with respect to these broad psychiatric disorder categories and many of the subcategories. Furthermore, self-reported childhood ADHD symptoms (based on the WURS-K [Reference Rösler, Retz-Junginger, Retz and Stieglitz38]) were significantly more pronounced in these groups than in the control group. These characteristics are not specifically linked to just one of the two factors we examined, offender status or paedophilic sexual preference; however, they stand out from the norm as defined by the group of healthy controls, and suggest that comorbid disorders may be involved in a unitary mechanism underlying both paedophilic sexual age preference and CSO. On the other hand, the finding that all the clinical/offender groups also reported significantly higher anxiety and discomfort in tense interpersonal settings than controls (on the personal distress subscale of the German adaption of the IRI [Reference Davis41]) suggests that many of the reported deficits in these three groups may be a consequence of the stigma associated with “coming out” as a paedophilic and/or being incarcerated for CSO, too. Due to the cross-sectional design of our study we have no evidence on the direction of the relationship. We do however want to emphasise that researchers should pay more attention to this latter possibility when studying groups of paedophiles and/or child sex offenders than they seem to have done up to now [Reference Jahnke and Hoyer57]. A small group of researchers has already started developing and test hypotheses about the ways in which stigmatisation of paedophiles and child sex offenders may actually increase the risk of offending or re-offending [Reference Jahnke, Schmitd, Geradt and Hoyer58, Reference Ward, Mann and Gannon59]. And health professionals (e.g., from the “Don't offend” project in Germany, or the Specialist Treatment Organisation for the Prevention of Sexual Offending in the United Kingdom) and non-professionals (e.g., self-help groups such as the online platform Virtuous Paedophiles, or the community-based reintegration initiative Circles of Support and Accountability in Canada) already try to interrupt the emerging vicious cycle by offering help and support to individuals who perceive themselves to be at risk of committing child sex offences and are struggling to refrain from doing so.\n\nIn summary, a combination of internal and external, psychological and developmental risk factors can be found in both paedophilic men and men with a history of CSO. Our results are essentially similar to those of earlier studies in that they suggest that paedophilia and CSO are multi-causal phenomena. However, in disentangling sexual preference factors from those associated with offending, our study additionally indicates that increasing age is linked to CSO, whether by paedophilic or by non-paedophilic men, that childhood trauma may underlie the phenomenon of CSO and that an accumulation of sexual anomalies may be a major influence on the pathogenesis of paedophilia.\n\nOur sample size may still have been too small and the number of tested variables too high in order to pinpoint specific associations. Future studies should focus on smaller subsets of the variables included within the exploratory approach of our study in order to provide statistically sound analyses including correction for multiple comparisons. Such studies could for example test for the relationship between the type of childhood traumatization experienced and the exact nature of risk factors found to be fulfilled in later (paedophilic or non-paedophilic) child sex offenders. Or, they could search for a possible link between age at first masturbation and exclusivity of the sexual age preference. In this sense, we hope that the results of our study may serve as a source of inspiration for the selection and combination of variables in forthcoming studies on the origins of paedophilia and child sex offending."
