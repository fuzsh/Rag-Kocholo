At its Wednesday, Nov. 17, meeting, the Mecklenburg <strong>Union</strong> Metropolitan Planning Organization voted to study the Rea Road extension but tabled the proposed Monroe Road widening along with five other <strong>Union</strong> projects that have no funding. As the group continues to shape a draft of its new five-year Transportation Improvement Program, members had to determine if currently delayed projects were to be included or left on hold. The regional planning agency agreed to collect more data about Rea Road and the proposed widening of U.S. 601 from the Monroe Bypass to Hwy 74 near Marshville. Other projects such as the Monroe Road widening fell short due to a lack of consensus. “It appears (Monroe Road) doesn’t mesh with our process because we have to move quickly,” agency Secretary Bob Cook said. “Perhaps we come back later www.unioncountyweekly.com Little relief for <strong>Union</strong> <strong>County</strong> roads Projects remain on hold; Monroe Road delayed by Brian Carlton brian@unioncountyweekly.com Dollars anD sense? on and look to see if it’s appropriate to shift monies to Old Monroe.” Over the last few months, Stallings and Indian Trail had considered moving the money currently allocated to widen Stallings and Indian Trail roads toward a single venue, widening Old Monroe Road from the county line to the intersection with Wesley Chapel- Stouts Road.

Indian Trail aims for future with recent projects by Brian Carlton brian@unioncountyweekly.com One movie theater can make the difference between keeping tax dollars in <strong>Union</strong> <strong>County</strong> or see them flood across the border to Charlotte, planning experts say. On Wednesday, Nov. 17, Indian Trail announced that Stone Theatres will open with 14 screens as part of the Sun Valley Commons Phase III project. “Today is one of those examples where one wants to use the cliche ‘bigger and better things yet to come’ ... however, this is about as big and better as it gets,” Indian Trail Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Goodall said. “This project sets the bar for quality economic development, which this council has been striving for over (see Projects on page 21) With both sides rejecting candidates submitted by the other, <strong>Carolina</strong>s Healthcare System and <strong>Union</strong> <strong>County</strong> will try to find common ground once again in December, when three new commissioners take office. The issue involves three open spots on the county’s Community Trustee Council, the group charged with examining any potential contract or change in the lease agreement for the hospital system to manage Monroe’s CMC-<strong>Union</strong> hospital. The problem is both county and <strong>Carolina</strong>s Healthcare officials have to sign off on the appointments, and they’ve spent a year disagreeing. That’s just something the council is used to by now, council chair Donnie Baucom said. “It’s not uncommon for one of our board members to have their term expire in December but serve until sometime in the first quarter of the next year,” Baucom said. “We’ll continue to function as a board with a quorum.
