        "text": "Copied from the Wittelsbach topic in which Sophie-Alexandra Evekink's, the new princess Sophie of Bavaria is discussed.\n\nYes, Evekink, van Voorst Evekink, Busger Evekink.\n\nA Jeanette van Voorst Evekink née Willet Holthuyzen lived in one of Amsterdam's finest mansions: https://www.amsterdammuseum.nl/locaties/huis-willet-holthuysen/2466 That is an indication of the Evekinks belonging to deftige families without being of nobility. Like Pieter van Vollenhoven, Annemarie Guáltherie van Weezel, Mabel Wisse Smit.\n\nAre you sure Mabel Los belongs to one of the patrician (or deftige) families in the Netherlands? I assume her stepfather does but the surnames 'Los' (her father) and 'Kooman' (her mother) don't seem to indicate any high-born family background for Mabel herself.\n\nIt remains rather rare to take on your stepfather's surname -especially when he only came into your life while a teenager, so I cannot help but think that the name itself had something to do with it (next to hopefully an excellent relationship with her stepfather).\n\nLuana van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg seems to study at Sevenoaks in Kent. Last year she won the Itchenor sailing event (a fleet racing event featuring 72 boats from 16 schools) for Sevenoaks, together with partner Martin Etilla.\n\nhttps://www.sevenoaksschool.org/new...detail&cHash=93739cdb62890da833c2d5f95d305bad\n\nDidn't Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium also study at Sevenoaks?\n\nN.B. Wikipedia indicates that also prince Amedeo, princess Elisabeth of Thurn und Taxis as well as Sir Timothy Laurence attended the school.\n\nLuana also participated in an Arts exhibition in 2021.\n\nCopied from the Wittelsbach topic in which Sophie-Alexandra Evekink's, the new princess Sophie of Bavaria is discussed.\n\nAre you sure Mabel Los belongs to one of the patrician (or deftige) families in the Netherlands? I assume her stepfather does but the surnames 'Los' (her father) and 'Kooman' (her mother) don't seem to indicate any high-born family background for Mabel herself.\n\nIt remains rather rare to take on your stepfather's surname -especially when he only came into your life while a teenager, so I cannot help but think that the name itself had something to do with it (next to hopefully an excellent relationship with her stepfather).\n\nYes, Wisse Smit. I did not realise Mabel has taken her stepfather's name. But the blue book indicates the Wisse Smits are \"not from the street\" however also patrician families can fall deep, of course.\n\nGiven that fathers now transmit membership of noble families to their adopted children, would it not be the same for a patriciate family?\n\nI am not sure whether Mabel and her sister were formally adopted. The website of the royal family only states that in 1984 Mabel took up her stepfather's surname.\n\nMabel Los was born on 11 August 1968.\n\nNicoline Los was born in 1970.\n\nTheir father Hendrik Los drowned on 18 February 1978, while trying to save his neighbor who had fallen through the ice while ice skating.\n\nTheir mother Florence Los-Kooman remarried to Peter Wisse Smit (sources differ on the date).\n\nEveline Wisse Smit was born in 1982.\n\nMabel Los and Nicoline Los changed their surnames to Wisse Smit (their stepfather's surname). Mabel was 15 or 16 at that time. Nicoline was 13 or 14.\n\nSeeing as Luana and Zaria have never lived in the Netherlands and realistically may not feel any particular attachment to the country, it is a good thing in my opinion that they are not Princesses of the Netherlands or in line to be queen of the Netherlands.\n\nI don't think it was ever in the cards for them to be princesses of the Netherlands. Princesses of Orange-Nassau probably; however, as a few years before their parent's marriage -upon the marriage of Constantijn & Laurentien- it was decided that the children of the siblings of the heir would be 'reduced' to counts instead of princes.\n\nMoreover, had Friso and Mabel's marriage been approved, they (later Mabel) might have made different choices later on. So, the decision to not grant them parliamentary approval might have influenced their decisions. For example, Constantijn and Laurentien returned from Belgium at the time their children were to go to secondary education. Mabel might have made a similar decision to further strengthen their bond to the Netherlands if they had been in line to the throne.\n\nNonetheless, it seems unlikely that they do not have any attachment to the country of their own nationality, where all of their close family members live and where their father is buried.\n\nThe Patriciate is not legally established and protected by law.\n\nIn the 19th C a publisher saw good trade in publishing all Nobility in a sort of encyclopedia, with an annual addendum, called Nederland's Adelsboek (the red book), see picture.\n\nThe same publisher saw another good trade in enlisting \"respectable families\" (read: families with generations of landowners, magistrates, bankers, major entrepreneurs, military officers, colonial authorities, etc.) in an equal sort of encyclopedia, with an annual addendum called Nederland's Patriciaat (the blue book), see picture.\n\nBut where the criteria for admission in the Red Book are 100% clear (one is noble or one is not noble, simple enough), these are very subjective in the Blue Book. After all who decides a family is deftig (genteel) enough to be admissed into that book?\n\nWhere Nobility is transferred via heirs of the body male, this is more fluïd in the Patricipate. That Eveline Wisse Smit belongs to the family Wisse Smit, might be clear. Her stepsisters Nicoline and Mabel Los became Wisse Smit. There is no title or predicate or bloodline needed, I think. Nicoline and Mabel are part of the family of their stepfather Peter Wisse Smit, a banker whose surname happens to be enlisted into Nederland's Patriciaat. Via that way they are part of a patrician family. Once again: a totally subjective understanding without any legal regulation or protection.\n\nBefore the Sixties, when there was still a clear division in classes, the term \"He is Red Book, she is Blue Book\" was widely known (meaning: he is a noble, she is from a patrician family). These days I doubt it has any importance anymore, except for Wiener Balls which are still organized here and there, where nobles and wanna-be-poshy folks hope to have the noses upwards in attempts to climb the social pyramid."
