During the following decade the lithographic business grew, with Currier and his artists issuing prints to cover a vast range of scenes to interest America. The images were all created for the rapidly growing and increasingly prosperous American public. In 1852, a young bookkeeper, James Meritt Ives (1824 - 1895) was hired by Currier. Five years later the legendary partnership of Currier and Ives was born.\n\nDay & Haghe: The most famous early Victorian firm of lithographic printing was by created William Day (1797 - 1845) and Louis Haghe (1806 - 1895) in London in 1829. Throughout their initial years, Day and Haghe printed lithographs dealing with a wide range of subjects, such as hunting scenes, topographical views and genre depictions. Their lithographs were so meticulously conceived and technically advanced that in 1838, Day and Haghe were appointed 'Lithographers to the Queen'. After William's death in 1845, the firm became known as 'Day & Son' and in the mid-Victorian era it led the way as a pioneer of the recently developed medium of the lithograph printed in colours.\n\nSociete des Aqua-Fortistes: The 'Societe des Aqua-Fortistes' was founded by Cadart in 1862. Until its demise in 1867, it was responsible for publishing some of the greatest French art of this important era.\n\nNote: The catalogue is set up in alphabetical order by artist's last name.

Artist: Coney, John (London, 1786 - Camberwell, 1833) Date: 1822 Medium: Original Graphite Drawing Size: 14 1/2 X 18 5/8 Framed Price: Sold Condition: Drawn upon early nineteenth century wove paper bearing the 'Whatman Turkey Mill 1821' watermark and with full margins. Signed, dated and titled by Coney in pencil along the top central margin. The drawing was received on its original and acidic black backing board and was glued on the verso around all four edges. Every conservationist is aware that the acidity of early nineteenth century papers and matting materials is among the worst. This drawing was thus extensively foxed, stained and browned. For restoration, the drawing was carefully removed from its black board backing (without any loss of paper) and then bathed in archival solutions and cleaned with distilled water. The browning and staining was completely eradicated and the foxing -- while still apparent (particularly in the sky) -- was greatly diminished. This original drawing is thus probably in better condition now than it was one hundred and fifty years ago. Buildwas Abbey, Shropshire, from the N. E thus represents both a premier work of historic significance and a prime example of the architectural art of John Coney.\n\nAuguste Aristide Fernand Constantin\n\nView Image: Title: Fantaisies (Fantasies) Artist: Constantin, Auguste-Aristide-Fernand 'Auguste Constantin' (Paris, 1824 - 1895) Date: 1863 Medium: Original Etching Publisher: Cadart & F.
