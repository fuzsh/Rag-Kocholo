        "text": "Turner Classic Movies (TCM) today announced additional talent and programming for this year’s 15th annual TCM Classic Film Festival running April 18 – 21, 2024 in Hollywood, including a closing night screening of 1987’s comedy Spaceballs presented by writer and director Mel Brooks. The lineup for the weekend will also include:\n\nSteven Spielberg in Q&A with UCLA Film School’s Howard Suber ahead of the director’s cut of Spielberg’s film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)\n\nA Little Romance (1979) with star Diane Lane in conversation with TCM Host Ben Mankiewicz\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption (1994) with stars Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in attendance\n\nFilmmaker Nancy Meyers introduces the world premiere restoration of one of her favorite movies, North By Northwest (1959), completed by Warner Bros. and The Film Foundation\n\nDirector David Fincher presenting a world premiere restoration IMAX® screening of his 1995 thriller Se7en\n\nA cast reunion for Little Women (1994) featuring Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis and Eric Stoltz\n\nA world premiere restoration of The Searchers (1956), completed by Warner Bros. and The Film Foundation, introduced by writer/director Alexander Payne\n\nJeopardy! host Ken Jennings introduces a U.S. premiere restoration of The Small Back Room (1949), restored by The Film Foundation and courtesy of Rialto Pictures\n\nIn addition, TCM and Warner Bros. will present That’s Vitaphone!: The Return of Sound-on-Disc. For the first time in more than 90 years, six hilarious, often outlandish, Vitaphone vaudeville shorts of the 1920s will be projected in 35mm, with sound played back from their original 16-inch discs on a turntable designed and engineered by Warner Bros. Post Production Engineering Department. In 1926, Warner Bros., with technology developed by Western Electric, introduced Vitaphone, a system of adding high fidelity synchronized sound to motion pictures, using discs mechanically coupled to the movie projector. Vitaphone would usher in the talking picture with the premiere of The Jazz Singer in October 1927. By the early 1930s, though, sound-on-disc would be replaced industry-wide by the less cumbersome sound on film. This replica of a Vitaphone machine, the only one in existence, marks the first time modern audiences will be able to experience these films as they did in the 1920s, using discs restored from the era. In attendance to provide context will be Bruce Goldstein, founder and co-president of Rialto Pictures, Warner Bros. post-production engineers Steve Levy and Bob Weitz, and Vitaphone expert Shane Fleming.\n\nFor more information, please visit http://tcm.com/festival.\n\nAbout the 2024 TCM Classic Film Festival\n\nMovie lovers from around the globe will descend upon Hollywood for the 15th edition of the TCM Classic Film Festival.
