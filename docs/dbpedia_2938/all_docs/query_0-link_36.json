        "text": "In New York City, on October 6th, 1927, Warner Brothers and the Vitaphone Corporation premiered their \"Supreme Triumph\", The Jazz Singer. The film is remembered as the first talking picture and the first movie musical. Neither of those claims are true.\n\nThe first known sound recordings were created in the 1850s by French printer and inventor Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. The first known piece of motion picture film was a revolving self-portrait of French cameraman Gaspard-Félix Tournachon (better known as Nadar) in 1865. It's incredible to think that it took over half a century of audio recording and motion picture capabilities coexisting to finally figure out how to synchronize film and audio together. Indeed, it hadn't.\n\nIn fact, in 1894, W.K.L. Dickson photographed The Dickson Experimental Sound Film at Thomas Edison's \"Black Maria\" studio in New Jersey. It depicts three men, two of them dancing together as the third man plays a violin in front of a massive phonograph. It was the earliest known experiment in synchronizing film with sound, three decades before the advent of Vitaphone. The film was created as part of Edison's \"Kinetophone\" project, which he would be developing on and off for the next couple of decades.\n\nIn the 1910s, Edison would produce a new series of short Kinetophone films, each running a few minutes in length. Naturally, the first thing to do after developing the technology to make talking pictures is to record a minstrel show.\n\nKinetophone films would also depict other acts which originated on the stage, on vaudeville. Such as the comedy sketch Jack's Joke, where Jack sets up a blind date where he tricks the man and woman into thinking the other is hard of hearing.\n\nDigging a little deeper, you'll find some earlier experiments in sound synchronization. The \"Cameraphone\" company produced a handful of sound films around 1908, but only two have been recovered. The sound meant to accompany the films has been lost, but newspaper ads of the time still exist, announcing the Cameraphone company and listing the films they produced.\n\nOf the two films that have been found, one depicts a number from the operetta The Merry Widow. The other is of (what else?) a minstrel show. It isn't the early 20th century without a minstrel show!\n\nIt can't be said exactly why none of these projects took off. Perhaps the money ran out, or they were dismissed as novelties, just as the cinema was dismissed as a novelty. Perhaps there was some grand conspiracy to stifle the development of sound films. Apparently, they invented an electric car in 1909, so anything's possible.\n\nIn the 1920s, Western Electric developed technology capable of producing sound on disc, and held private demonstrations. The brothers Warner attended these demonstrations and were impressed by the quality of the sound. In 1925, Warner Bros. acquired Western Electric's sound-on-disc company and branded it \"Vitaphone\".\n\nThe following year, Warner Bros. and Vitaphone premiered their film of Don Juan, the first feature film with a synchronized soundtrack and one musical number as the centerpiece, but no dialogue. At the premiere, the film was preceded by a series of shorts which showcased other musical acts, and a talking film introduction. Ironically, this great leap forward in the art of film was introduced by the man responsible for stifling motion picture art for the decades to come: Will Hays.\n\nOne year later, Warner Bros. premiered their second Vitaphone feature, The Jazz Singer, the first feature film to incorporate bits of spoken dialogue, as well as musical numbers. The film was a vehicle for singer Al Jolson, who was already a big star on Broadway at the time.\n\nHe had made his screen debut in one of the early Vitaphone shorts, titled A Plantation Act. Just like with the other sound film experiments, one of the first things they recorded with Vitaphone was a minstrel act. It goes to show you how prevalent and popular these acts were at the time.\n\nIn The Jazz Singer, Jolson plays Jakie Rabinowitz, the son of a Jewish Cantor, primed to take his father’s place. However, to his father’s dismay, Jakie instead pursues the life of a jazz singer, which creates a rift between father and son.\n\nThe Cantor is played by Swedish actor Warner Oland, who would soon become famous for playing Chinese characters in \"yellowface\" makeup, such as Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan, who he would portray in 16 films, up to 1937. Oland even studied Chinese language and calligraphy to get more into character.\n\nOland's Cantor in The Jazz Singer is a religious fanatic who cannot stand to see his son abandon the family's generational order of Cantors for a life of sin, as he sees it. So, Jakie runs away, and the Cantor disowns his son. This story is rather timeless, and can be applied to any religious sect and any musical trend that is considered transgressive, whether it be jazz, rock 'n' roll, hip-hop, and so on.\n\nWe then see Jakie all grown up, performing at a café in Los Angeles, under the name Jack Robin. This is where most of the world got to see and hear Al Jolson perform for the first time. He performs Dirty Hands, Dirty Face and Toot, Toot, Tootsie, and in between, we hear the original famous movie quote…\n\n\"Wait a minute! You ain’t heard nothing yet!\"\n\nJolson had originated this line on the stage, and actually debuted it on film the year prior in A Plantation Act.\n\nJolson was known as \"The Great Entertainer\", and you could sort of see him as the Elvis Presley of his day. The Jazz Singer was his Jailhouse Rock. Remember how people responded to Presley's gyrations on The Ed Sullivan Show? Well, go back and look at Jolson in The Jazz Singer, the way he moves his body in his performances. He was a rock star in his time.\n\nThe film also features a brief early appearance from the future Norah Charles, Myrna Loy, seen here appearing more like a vamp than ever.\n\nSPOILER ALERT. In the final act of the film, the Cantor is on his deathbed, and Jakie has to make a choice between performing in the big show that he's been working up to for years, or singing Kol Nidre in his father's place on the Day of Atonement. This conflict is shown in two back-to-back sequences, with his mother pleading to him in one ear, and his girlfriend and manager yelling at him in the other ear.\n\nThe conflict is all wrapped up rather conveniently, when Jakie decides to sing Kol Nidre. His father hears his voice and, after years of disowning him, forgives him as he lays dying. Then, one title card and establishing shot later, Jakie is on stage just in time for the show, where he performs the big closing number, an emotional ode to his Mammy, while caked in blackface.\n\nIt's easy to see this performance through a modern lens and assume that Jolson was a vicious racist, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. If you visit jolson.org, the official site of The International Al Jolson Society, you'll find a list of resources detailing Jolson's use of blackface, his intent, and how it was received by black audiences at the time.\n\nJolson was a strong ally with the black community, ever since he was a kid growing up in Washington, D.C., crossing over the color line to hang out with the black kids, making friends with future stars like Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson.\n\nDuring his Broadway career, he would spend decades promoting black artists like playwright Garland Anderson, whose play Appearances became the first black-authored work to hit Broadway in 1925, largely thanks to Jolson's support. For his 1925 comedy Big Boy, Jolson hired an all-black band to perform the music, and put them on stage instead of in the pit.\n\nJolson's use of blackface was his way of honoring black artists and showing solidarity. His plays and films were very well-received in the black community and earned rave reviews from the black press. By 1928, when almost all the high-end theaters were wired for sound, The Jazz Singer, and Jolson's follow-up The Singing Fool, would be screened continuously across the country, and black audiences showed up in record numbers.\n\nThis is not to say you shouldn't feel uncomfortable about blackface. Jolson has slowly fallen out of favor with black audiences and the general public over the decades because of his blackface routines. I do not condone nor condemn the use of blackface in a performance. I think it's important to understand context and intent in each instance, and to not view it solely through a modern revisionist lens.\n\nThere are few films in history that you can point to that singlehandedly sparked a revolution in the art form. The Jazz Singer is one of those films. Its massive success would lead to more Vitaphone productions and more talking pictures from competing studios. In just two short years, the industry was completely upended, and the sound film became the new standard.\n\nA handful of noted filmmakers, like Charlie Chaplin, tried their best to cling onto silent film as long as possible, but by the end of the 1930s, they no longer held out. The talkies had won.\n\nOver the coming years, I intend to trace the history of the early talkies as they slowly, but surely, fall into the public domain. By viewing early sound cinema, we can examine how the medium was able to evolve at such a rapid pace, and all the growing pains that came with it."
