        "text": "Spotlights scanned the night sky, a brass band performed and one thousand people showed up just to mill around West Federal Street, tying up traffic throughout downtown Youngstown. Untold thousands more listened to the May 14, 1931, party covered live on WKBN radio or read the special edition put out by the Youngstown Vindicator.\n\nInside, the invitation-only, capacity crowd of 2,500 included men in white tie and tails and women in furs — fitting attire given the opulence they were to see for the first time. The $1.5 million Warner Theatre was opening with a fashion show, organ recital and a screening of the new film “The Millionaire,” but it wasn’t just any theater opening. It was a celebration of how far the venue’s namesake brothers had come. Ben Warner once told his sons, “Together, you are invincible,” and together they proved it.\n\nLong before the Warner brothers were Hollywood players, Sam, Albert, Harry and Jack traveled across the Mahoning Valley showing movies. They opened their first theater just across the state line in New Castle, Pennsylvania, before setting off for Pittsburgh, New York and then, in 1917, California to make movies themselves.\n\nIn 1926, the brothers’ studio presented “Don Juan,” the first feature-length film with synchronized sound effects and music. A year later, it released “The Jazz Singer,” the first film with spoken dialogue.\n\n“They staked everything they possessed upon the success of the synchronization of picture and sound,” wrote Lawrence Manning Lawlor in Town Talk, a Youngstown-based magazine that devoted an entire issue to the Warner Theatre the week the movie house opened. “Many within the industry predicted utter failure for this venture.”\n\nInstead, the innovation vaulted Warner Bros. to the forefront of moviemaking, “combining good citizenship with good picture-making,” as the studio motto said. But the Warner brothers’ success was not without tragedy. The day before “The Jazz Singer” premiered, Sam Warner died at the age of 40. His brothers decided to memorialize him with an ornate movie theater in Youngstown. They spared no expense, building the foyer to resemble the Palace of Versailles and paying $75,000 for a Wurlitzer organ.\n\nMuch like the Warner brothers, at the time of the theater’s opening the city of Youngstown had seen enormous success in a brief period of time, going from the rough-and-tumble town where the brothers took their first steps in the movie business to a center of industry. Its population more than tripled between 1900 and 1930 — up to 170,000 — as scores of immigrants like the Warners and their parents arrived to work in the mills and factories along the Mahoning River.\n\n“With the opening of the new Warner Theatre, Warner Brothers realize a cherished ambition to provide Youngstown with a temple of entertainment comparable to the finest in the country,” wrote Harry Warner in the Youngstown Vindicator the day before the theater welcomed its first guests. “Its formal opening is both a fulfillment and a promise — evidence of our desire and willingness to keep abreast of a progressive city.”\n\n***\n\nBen Warner came to America because of a lie. A friend from what is now Poland described to the cobbler a land of wealth, so Warner journeyed to Baltimore himself in 1890. He found a hard life but one easier than in the old country, so Warner sent for his family and set up a shoe repair shop.\n\nHis oldest son, Harry, a cobbler like his father, ventured to Ohio in 1896, wanting to see William McKinley, who was waging a front-porch campaign for president from his Canton home. While there, Harry — all of 14 years old — was urged to go to Youngstown, then a booming steel and iron production center with many people who needed their shoes repaired. He set up a shop downtown and prospered enough that, eventually, his parents and nine siblings came to join him.\n\nBen branched out, operating a grocery store and butcher shop in Youngstown, and the brothers began to make good on their youthful promise to their mother, recalled 40 years later by family friend Myron Penner: “We’re gonna be millionaires some day.”\n\nAlbert, who was two years younger than Harry, sold soap through a company in Chicago, and then operated a downtown Youngstown bicycle shop with Harry. The duo also briefly ran a bowling alley.\n\nSam, four years younger than Harry and described later on by the Youngstown Vindicator as the idea man of the brothers, worked as a railroad fireman and brought ice cream cones to Youngstown after seeing them at the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904. Even young Jack, 11 years younger than Harry, was working as a carrier for the Youngstown Vindicator, a delivery boy for his father’s butcher shop, and then as a chaser at the Dome Theater, with the stage name Leon Zuardo. He was hired at $18 a week to sing poorly enough to keep audience members from hanging out too long in the theater and taking up real estate that could be used for more paying customers.\n\nJack wasn’t the only one to catch the show-business bug. Sam was working as a nickelodeon operator at Cedar Point in Sandusky and Youngstown’s own Idora Park. During a trip to Pittsburgh, Harry had seen lines around the block to watch a movie. He wasn’t interested in the films themselves, but he saw an opportunity to make money.\n\nA movie projector came up for sale in Youngstown, along with a copy of the 12-minute, 1903 silent short “The Great Train Robbery,” now heralded as a watershed moment in film history. The cost was $1,000, and Sam convinced his brothers it was an opportunity they couldn’t pass up.\n\nThey pooled their money, but were still short, so they looked to their father. Ben pawned the horse that pulled the delivery wagon for his business — as well as his gold watch and chain, one of a few possessions he’d brought with him from Europe. The Warner brothers were on their way.\n\n***\n\nThe brothers screened “The Great Train Robbery” wherever they felt like they could get an audience — Idora Park, Steubenville, Warren, Niles (Jack later said that their film empire began in Niles when they took in $300 in one week showing the movie) and into Pennsylvania. They opened their first theater in New Castle, Pennsylvania — calling it the Cascade — with 99 chairs (100 or more would have required a license) borrowed from a nearby funeral home. It was truly a family affair, with Harry handling the books, Sam selling tickets, Albert running the projector and Jack once again singing between showings to chase away the customers.\n\nEventually, the market for “The Great Train Robbery” dried up, so the brothers set up a film exchange in Pittsburgh where theater operators could share movies they’d bought. The Warners expanded into other film exchanges in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles and eventually decided to make their own movies. They had early success with “My Four Years in Germany,” a film based on a book written by James W. Gerard, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany during World War I, but were one of many companies that had to jockey for position in the movie business alongside the big three of Paramount, MGM and Universal.\n\nWarner Bros. Studios was incorporated in 1923, and two years later, it acquired Vitagraph Studios — a deal that was a testament to Harry’s business acumen and his bravery (he wrote a check for $100,000 before securing any of the needed $4 million in seed money, much of which came from Goldman Sachs)."
