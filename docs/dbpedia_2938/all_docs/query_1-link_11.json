Ron proposed just over 60 one and two reel Vitaphone shorts along with five Vitaphone scored or talkie features from the system's earliest days. The assignment quickly expanded when TCM asked Ron to join host Ben Mankiewicz in the Atlanta studios in order to tape eleven intros and outros for the prime time segment of the marathon.\n\nThe taping went smoothly, and it was very clear that Ben really got into some of the Vitaphone restorations. Shaw and Lee's 1928 short, THE BEAU BRUMMELS, was his personal favorite. Ben's lineage includes screenwriters Herman J. Mankiewicz (grandfather) and Joseph Mankiewicz (great uncle) who, between them wrote such classics as ALL ABOUT EVE, CITIZEN KANE, MANHATTAN MELODRAMA, and PRIDE OF THE YANKEES.\n\nThe Vitaphone marathon gave countless TCM viewers who had never seen a Vitaphone short or feature the opportunity to do so. Just prior to the December5th airing, Ron participated in a three day Q&A on Vitaphone on TCM's online Silver Screen Oasis in which viewer questions were posed and Ron answered them.\n\nHere's a rundown of the Vitaphone shorts and features shown. Because of schedule timing adjustments, TCM added about five more shorts into this schedule\n\n(Times shown are Eastern)\n\n6:00 AM - Before They Were Stars --\n\nParee, Paree (1934) (Bob Hope)\n\nAll Girl Revue (1939) (June Allyson)\n\nArt Trouble (1934) (James Stewart)\n\nSeeing Red (1939) (Red Skelton)\n\nSuccess (1931) (Jack Haley)\n\nUps and Downs (1937) (Phil Silvers, June Allyson & Hal LeRoy)\n\n8:15 AM - The Better 'Ole (1926) 10:15 AM - Vitaphone in Technicolor--\n\nGood Morning, Eve!

This year, for the first time, a restored Vitaphone short was chosen for that honor. The 1928 Vitaphone short SHAW AND LEE, THE BEAU BRUMMELS, joined Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, EAST OF EDEN, FUNNY GIRL and THE LION KING for this distinctive and important national honor. This vaudeville ï¿½Vitaphone Varietyï¿½ was restored about 15 years ago by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, with funding developed by The Vitaphone Project. This short became an immediate audience favorite due largely to Al Shaw and Sam Lee's dead pan delivery, so-bad-they're-good jokes, and eccentric dancing. The Project connected with the grandsons of both performers, who are thrilled about this recognition.\n\nDISC-OVERIES\n\nEarly soundtrack disks found since our last issue:\n\nDARKTOWN FOLLIES (Pathe/1930), reel 1 of a Buck & Bubbles 2 reel short)\n\nSINGING STARS (Pathe/ 1930) one reel short\n\nTHE SALESMAN (Pathe/1929) Frank Daviscomedy short\n\nSTOP THAT NOISE (Univ/1930) reel 2 of Sunny Jim short\n\nTHE ROYAL BLUFF (Univ/1931) disks for both reels of this Slim Summerville short\n\nDISCONTENTED COWBOYS (Univ/1930) disks for both reels of this Sidney/Murrayshort\n\nALASKA (Univ/1930) Oswald cartoon\n\nDisks for the following Terrytoon cartoons:\n\nCAVIAR (1930)\n\nSING SING SING (1931)\n\nTHE FIREMAN'S BRIDE (1931)\n\nJAZZ MAD (1931)\n\nBLUES (1931)\n\nCLOWNING (1931)\n\nQUACK, QUACK (1931)\n\nRAZZBERRIES (1931)\n\nA DAY TO LIVE (1931)\n\nGO WEST BIG BOY (1931)\n\nTHE EXPLORER (1931)\n\nAlso:\n\n4 disks for THE BACHELOR'S CLUB (Oscar Price Productions/1929) starring Richard Talmadge\n\nReel 2 for THE PAGAN (MGM/1929)\n\nReels 2 and 8 for WHOOPEE! (UA/1930)\n\nVITAPHONE BOOKSHELF\n\nJames Layton and David Pierce's sumptuous new book, KING OF JAZZ, PAUL WHITEMAN'S TECHICOLOR REVUE, was officially released at an event on November 14, 2016 at IGUANA, a mid-town Manhattan restaurant where Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks play each Monday and Tuesday night. The evening was filled with Whiteman tunes by the Nighthawks, including all of them used in the film, and one, ï¿½My Loverï¿½, which was cut before release. Vince even located and played an original 1930 orchestration of a KING OF JAZZ medley by British band leader Debroy Somers. Present at the book release event were relatives of the film's art director, Herman Rosse as well as film historian and Rutgers professor Richard Koszarski and his wife Diane who spent three decades researching KING OF JAZZ. The book may still be ordered at:\n\nhttp://kingofjazzbook.com\n\nThe previous month, both authors received the prestigious Theatre Library Book Award for their DAWN OF TECHNICOLOR 1915-1935.\n\nSCREENINGS\n\nUniversal's beautiful restoration of KING OF JAZZ ('30) continues to get many screenings worldwide. Since our last issue, audiences in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City (again), Cincinnati, Australia and England have enjoyed the Technicolor revue.\n\nFilm Forum in NYC held several Vitaphone programs this fall in NYC, each hosted by the Project's Ron Hutchinson. In September as part of FF's salute to vaudeville, Ron presented the best-of-the-best Vitaphone vaude shorts in ï¿½A Night At The Palaceï¿½. Later that same month, the first of two programs of recently restored 1928-29 Vitaphone shorts were shown. In October, a double feature of a second set of just-restore Vitaphone shorts was paired with the also recently restored 1928 Vitaphone scored Alice White feature SHOW GIRL. At this program, the grandkids of two of the Vitaphone shorts performers --- imitator Zelda Santley and musical comedian Herschel Henlere --- were in attendance. They got to hear the great audience reactions to their relatives' long forgotten acts.\n\nPEOPLE\n\nWe're saddened to report that Rich Conaty, host of WFUV-FM's THE BIG BROADCAST for over 43 years, passed away on December 30, 2016. Rich's program brought the enjoyment of 78s from the twenties and thirties the countless listeners, expanding that following worldwide when internet streaming of the program began a few years ago. Rich was a strong supporter of the Project, always plugging screenings of new restorations. He will be sorely missed!\n\nBryan Wright, who heads Rivermont Records and produces CDs of piano, vintage band, and the annual Big Broadcast compilation CDs of 78s, will be issuing volume 2 of his Irving Aaronson collection. Aaronson is best known for his 1928 Victor record of ï¿½Let's Misbehaveï¿½. Volume 2 boasts not one but both of the soundtrack disks for the band's 1928 MGM Movietone Act shorts. Sadly, the picture portion does not survive for either.\n\nNEW WARNER ARCHIVE DVD OF RESTORATION\n\nAs we go to press, we expect Warner Archive to issue Volume 3 of VITAPHONE VARIETIES on DVD soon. The announcement should be made before the end of March 2017. This set will include about twenty recent and previously unissued early Vitaphone shorts restorations from 1928-30. The previous two volumes contained over 70 early vaudeville, band, comedy and playlet shorts from 1927-31 and are must-haves for any fan of Vitaphone.\n\nTo order Volume 3, or any other Vitaphone DVD set, go to Warner Archive's site at:\n\nhttp://www.wbshop.com\n\nYou can also search the website with ï¿½vitaphoneï¿½. Again, the new volume may not be available until sometime in March, so check in regularly.\n\nAlso pre-order it on Amazon.com here.\n\nï¿½REDSKINï¿½ LOST DISKS FOUND, VITAPHONE TRACK NOW COMPLETE\n\nSix of the Vitaphone disks for REDSKIN (Par/'29) in Ron Hutchinson's collection. They will be made available to The Library of Congress for restoration of the full original synchronized soundtrack.\n\nParamount's last silent feature was REDSKIN ('29), starring Richard Dix and was mostly Technicolor production with a full synchronized score. This beautiful film, directed by Victor Schertzinger, had only surviving disks for reels 1, 3 and 8 when it was restored by The Library of Congress about 15 years ago. The missing score was replaced with a piano accompaniment. In 2011, the Project's Ron Hutchinson acquired nearly 80 disks in New Haven, CT. Included were REDSKIN disks for reels 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8. In November, 2016, Michael Cumella alerted Ron to yet another disk for the film, for reel 6. This was successfully acquired, and with the disk for reel 4 residing in the collection of a Delaware collector, all the disks for REDSKIN are now known.\n\nAs of this writing, the Project is working with Mike Mashon at The Library of Congress to best determine how an upgraded restoration with the full soundtrack may proceed.\n\nUCLA ï¿½MAMBAï¿½ RESTORATION DONE, SCREENING SET\n\nChris Horak, head of the UCLA Film and Television Archive, has announced that the restoration of MAMBA (Tiffany/1930) has finally been completed. The film is of great importance as the first non-musical, all Technicolor feature. The long lost 35mm (but mute) Technicolor nitrate print was found in Australia by Paul Brennan about 10 years ago. The Project connected Paul with UCLA which had all of the disks and the final reel of nitrate. A tentative synchronization of picture and sound had been done by Jonas Nordin, and screened at Cinefest in 2012. While needing some visual cleanup, the color of the surviving film was quite vibrant.\n\nThe restoration was supervised by longtime Vitaphone Project UCLA partners Todd Wiener and Scott MacQueen, with whom we work on Vitaphone shorts restorations.\n\nThe MAMBA restoration is to be included in UCLA's March 2017 ï¿½Festival of Preservationï¿½.\n\nVITAPHONE ADVERTISING\n\nVITAPHONE FAQ's ANSWERED\n\nCurrent cost to restore a sound-on-disk 10 minute one reel short at UCLA is $12 ï¿½ 14,000 (deductible)\n\nDonors receive their own personal copy of the restoration on DVD and on-screen credit.\n\nThe Project's soundtrack disk database currently contains over 6,000 disks, primarily held by private collectors.\n\nThere are over 250 Vitaphone shorts (plus over 75 MGM shorts) currently available on DVD through Warner Archive.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1930, there were approximately 1500 sound-on-disk Vitaphone shorts and features produced by Warner Bros and First National.\n\nThere are about 320 1926-30 Vitaphone shorts for which picture (film) survive but for which accompanying soundtrack disks are still missing.\n\nWarner Bros abandoned direct-to-disk sound recordings around March, 1930 and moved to the industry standard of optical sound recording and editing.\n\nTo date, the Project has not found soundtrack disks issued by Warner Bros after late 1932.\n\nVITAPHONE PROJECT ON FACEBOOK\n\nEven if you are not currently on Facebook, we strongly urge you to join (it's free) if only to be able to check in on the regular posts at our page.
