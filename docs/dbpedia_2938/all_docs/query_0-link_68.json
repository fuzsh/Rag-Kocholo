        "text": "I know what you’re thinking–God, doesn’t this chick talk about any movie besides The Wild Party?\n\nYeah, well, sorry. An Adrienne Doré fan like myself is bound to pick up on other obscure names in the cast of her best film, and one of those names is Jean Lorraine. No, not that one—unluckily, this particular actress picked out just a common enough French-sounding stage name that she shared it with two other performers.\n\nOn the surface, Miss Lorraine’s story reads like that of so many of her contemporaries (including Miss Dore’s): a beautiful young actress whose career was regrettably marked by a minute failure in attaining a certain degree of individuality that would set her apart from the scores of Hollywood hopefuls. Not like that’s entirely due to their own shortcomings; career highlights and film credits of both women are frequently spoiled by misspellings and mix-ups with other actresses.\n\nUltimately, fate is the only legitimate arbiter of stardom, and in a dog-eat-dog era rife with studio exploitation, it’s a given that myriads of talented performers had bad breaks or were simply forgotten—those who managed to make it without the aid of Lady Luck survived on pure resilience. Their work was rewarded with the degradation of nitrate, which delivered a one-two punch to those who were unlucky enough to start their careers in silents.\n\nOnce thoroughly excavated and pieced together, Jean Lorraine’s story (this time unlike that of her obscure Wild Party co-star) reads quite tragically. Readers expecting a quick and pleasant biography might want to sit this one out; once I delved into Miss Lorraine, I unlocked a series of seemingly never-ending discoveries that were both hard to digest and hard to discern. For one thing, IMDB has mixed up her vitals and filmography with those of the other Jean Lorraines. For another, I stumbled upon a heap of apocryphal anecdotes that took a long time to fully dissect–another warning for readers who haven’t had their coffee.\n\nJean Lorraine (not to be confused with silent child star and forties musical actress Jean O’Rourke, who also used this name) bobbed along in the mid-to-late twenties as one of the many Filmland flappers engaged in extra work.\n\nShe was born Frances Henrietta Munsell on May 18, 1906 in the desert town of Highland, California, which (as its name appropriately implies) is nestled just below the San Bernardino Mountains some sixty miles east of Los Angeles. The circumstances of her birth are extremely unfortunate–her mother, sixteen-year-old Laura Cornelia Hughes, had the child out of wedlock and only named its father when she felt close to death during childbirth. He was publicly revealed to be twenty-two-year-old Patton State Hospital employee James Munsell, an Illinois native whom the San Bernardino Sun referred to (in very nice terms) as leading the young Laura to “forbidden ways”.\n\nFrom here, Laura’s father insisted Munsell be taken into custody, which he was–until he hurriedly offered to marry the teenage girl, wherein the officer that arrested Munsell accompanied him to the Hughes family home to see out the shotgun ceremony just one day after Frances’ birth. To add to the confusion, reporters incorrectly surmised that baby Frances was a boy, referring to her as Munsell’s “infant son”.\n\nIn the following days, more articles are released that exploit a highly traumatic situation and reduce it to little more than something out of a B western. One fantastical situation published was a tale of Laura’s older brother holding her attacker at the mercy of a six-shooter if he didn’t marry her immediately. Others allude to another possible, albeit unnamed, mystery father that is only described as “well-known” and “much talked of”.\n\nIt gets worse. James Munsell hightailed it the following day after spending one night with his child-wife and newborn baby, having lost his job despite “vehement declarations that he is not responsible for the ruin of Laura Hughes”. Munsell was not without his supporters, even though his escape reads like a simple get-out-of-jail ruse. Whatever the truth was, he had no connection to Frances or her maternal family for the rest of his life, despite never actually leaving San Bernardino County for good.\n\nFrances, however, did.\n\nLaura Hughes found a husband soon after in one John Obear, and after a few short stints on ranches in rural locales near Barstow and Bakersfield, the little family landed in Los Angeles. In the 1920 census, thirteen-year-old Frances was living with her mother and stepfather (who was employed as a boxmaker for a fruit company) in the Mildred Apartments on West 11th near the very heart of the city.\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine young Frances developing an interest in pictures, having spent some of her childhood in such close proximity to clusters of movie palaces and the bigwigs who ran them—her home on West 11th was located just outside the perimeter of an area known today as LA’s Historic Core, but she wouldn’t get to enjoy it for very long.\n\nLaura and John Obear divorced almost immediately after the 1920 census, but not before another move to far-flung Piru in Ventura County, where he found work as a beekeeper. This part took me forever to unravel–a divorce and a move so soon after the census made tracing them mucky enough already, but just months later in April of 1921, Frances gained a second stepfather in the form of thirty-five-year-old William E. Peddycord. A resident of nearby Oxnard, he took out a marriage license with thirty-year-old “Cornelia L. Hughes”, who is a recently divorced Laura using her middle and maiden names.\n\nThis could be due to the fact that the marriage was quite possibly illegitimate. William Peddycord, a Kansan teacher and draft-dodger, was subject to more than one divorce suit by his first, legitimate wife in between reconciliations; while she filed one final time in 1919, no actual divorce record can be located by this researcher. This probability is further implicated by the first wife’s marital status remaining unchanged on the 1920 census (with no husband in sight) and her continued use of “Mrs. Peddycord” until her death.\n\nFollowing the newly branded Peddycord family from here leads us to even more tragedy. Peddycord ostensibly came to California soon after separating from his first wife to take part in the state’s burgeoning oil industry–after remarrying, he relocated his new family from coastal Oxnard to inland Corona, near the oil fields, where he swiftly became superintendent of the new Mahala Oil & Gas Company. Things seemed to be looking up for Frances and her mother, as they could now rely on the security a position like Peddycord’s provided—Mahala’s oil well proved to be productive by October 1921.\n\nBy mid-July 1922, Peddycord cut ties with Mahala to work for another oil company on Long Beach’s Signal Hill–he moved Laura and Frances to nearby Anaheim, where the trio took an apartment in one of the burgeoning Samuel Kraemer buildings (predecessors to the singular high-rise that retains the name today) on Center Street.\n\nOn July 28, 1922, Peddycord wrapped up a day’s work on Signal Hill and, apparently hoping to catch a late boxing match, began the drive home to Anaheim at what the local Gazette called a “terrific speed”. In the process, he tried to pass a Ford containing a family of five but instead crashed into it, causing both vehicles to overturn and eject their passengers. The family survived without major injury, but Peddycord was thrown from the windshield of his Studebaker and died from a fractured skull soon after impact.\n\nFrances and her mother were alone yet again, likely with no prospects in Anaheim. Laura’s nervous condition after the fact prevented her from acting as informant on Peddycord’s death certificate (which contains numerous discrepancies) or making funeral arrangements. One wonders how sixteen-year-old Frances dealt with all of this, but we lose track of mother and daughter until they reappear in Hollywood over two years later.\n\nThis, of course, opens the possibility that Frances turned to films in order to take a chance at better supporting herself and her mother. We can only assume. While her obscurity leaves us bereft of a proper fairytale origin story regarding her debut, we can ascertain that Frances entered pictures somewhere around late 1924 or the top of 1925, aged eighteen.\n\nWhile we’ll likely never know the full, detailed picture of her subsequent metamorphosis into Jean Lorraine, we do know (by her own account) that she got her start as an extra in Christie comedies, often getting the opportunity to emote in the far background of lavish feature films.\n\nThe first known mention of Frances in films appears in the May 1925 issue of The Standard, the industry’s foremost casting directory. The once-indispensable resource, a glorified phonebook dotted by stills and glamour shots of Hollywood players, delineated character actors from leading women and so forth. One doe-eyed hopeful being promoted in the ‘ingenue leads’ section was Frances, still using her birth name after creatively retooling ‘Munsell’ to the more feminine, upscale ‘Munzelle’.\n\nThe newly minted ‘Frances Munzelle’ and her list of achievements, which were all still in production at the time of printing. The usual brunette dons a blonde wig from Pretty Ladies (1925) in this photo, which was taken by the man she would marry.\n\nThis directory headshot is the only known instance of the actress using the upgraded moniker, as ‘Frances’ was discarded within the coming month and Jean Lorraine had taken its place entirely by June, when the auburn beauty had her photo published next to those of other up-and-coming comediennes in the LA Times.\n\nEither way, neither name appears in the credits for any of the films listed above. While the available viewing print of Pretty Ladies is too grainy to discern each individual face in the chorus, it’s a safe bet that Jean Lorraine (which our subject will be referred to for the rest of the article for the sake of transparency) was there due to her presence in this group publicity shot, just to the left of director Monta Bell.\n\nJean Lorraine (visible just to director Monta Bell ‘s left) with a bevy of other beauties, one of which (right above her and to our left) would become Joan Crawford.\n\nThere was one lucky catalyst that helped set Lorraine’s career in motion. Al Christie, namesake of the company she did extra work for, began assembling an “international trio of beauty” by way of a photographic contest; each of the girls that entered had a portrait shot by longtime Christie cameraman, Alex Phillips, a Romanian-Canadian immigrant and World War vet who would later become a legendary contributor to the world of Mexican cinema. Phillips’ photo of Lorraine won her the position as the Christie studio’s so-called “perfect American beauty”. It also helped win her better roles and, apparently, a husband (though Phillips had been taking her photo since before the contest).\n\nJean Lorraine photographed by Alexander Phillips, circa 1925. His blindstamp can be seen in the lower right corner.\n\nThe Pittsburgh-Post Gazette, July 1925\n\nLorraine and Phillips filed for a marriage license the very same day they exchanged their wedding vows on the Fourth of July, 1925—he was twenty-five and she was a fresh nineteen. She registered under her birth name, Frances Munsell, listed her occupation as a motion picture actress, and gave an address on Virginia Avenue, just up the street from today’s Hollywood Forever. Phillips listed his occupation as “cinematographer”—a true Tinseltown pairing. The couple would eventually settle just a stone’s throw from the Garden of Allah on the Sunset Strip, in a Crescent Heights apartment which is now the site of a Buddhist temple. Lorraine’s mother Laura would come to live with them for a few years thereafter (until marrying for a fourth time in 1928).\n\nMeanwhile, Lorraine (helped along by a little white lie of being a Cherokee chief’s granddaughter) carried out her duties as the ‘American’ in Christie’s international triad alongside France’s Yola D’Avril and England’s Doris Wynn.\n\nExhibitors Herald, September 19, 1925\n\nThe pretty trio were scheduled to appear as a “prominent attraction” in the Phillips-photographed Madame Behave (1925), a riotous Julian Eltinge vehicle which is surprisingly extant—any scene involving the three up close and visible, however, is not (cameraman husbands aside).\n\nJean Lorraine in the Standard Casting Directory, January 1926. Courtesy AMPAS.\n\nA steady flow of credits came Lorraine’s way after the publicity that accompanied the studio beauty contest—from here, she’d make mischief in two-reel slapstick shorts like the farcical Shore Shy (1926) with Billy Dooley, which would see her final outing in Christie comedies. She even graduated to a lead in the unfortunately lost Jules White-directed Fox short Dizzy Dancers (1926).\n\nJean Lorraine in a Christie publicity photo for Shore Shy (1926)\n\nExploring Lorraine’s credits requires a quick foray into the life of another up-and-coming performer; unfortunately, her nascent career was blooming at the same time as one of two similarly named actresses. Belgian beauty Jeanne Vanvliet, using the name Jeanne Lorraine, had just won a Screenland beauty contest in early 1925; her prize was a shot at doubling for Gloria Swanson. Though the two Lorraines looked markedly different, their career highlights were occasionally conflated, with Lorraine’s picture being published next to a story detailing Vanvliet’s lurid divorce in 1927.\n\nThough Vanvliet’s film career didn’t “stick” after the Screenland contest, making only one film thereafter (1927’s Ladies at Ease), her colorful personal life would continue to make headlines, some unnecessarily involving Lorraine, for years. More on this later.\n\nBack to the Jean Lorraine at hand; having forsaken Christie to freelance, next on her itinerary were invisible bit parts in cutting edge productions like Murnau’s Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927), and the comparatively underwhelming Ankles Preferred (1927), both at Fox. Husband Alex, still with Christie, continued to be her primary photographer during this more independent phase of her career.\n\nJean Lorraine promotes Hackleman and Long footwear in publicity for Ankles Preferred (1927)\n\nAn uncredited modeling role in Fashions for Women (1927), Dorothy Arzner’s directorial debut at Paramount, was next— Lorraine was personally selected by Arzner alongside fourteen other girls for their “symmetrical beauty”.\n\nA pair of Fourth of July themed publicity photos of Jean Lorraine taken by her husband, Alex Phillips, 1927—ironically, their anniversary. Photo from the LA Times, July 3, 1927.\n\nAfter this, Lorraine found herself at First National with a featured part in Colleen Moore’s Naughty but Nice (1927). However “featured” the role remains a mystery for now, apart from this singular photo of Lorraine and fellow extras lending a listening ear to Colleen. The film, apparently extant and unrestored somewhere, seems to be a victim of the prohibitive cost and red tape that prevents so many worthy silents from attaining the preservation they deserve.\n\nJean Lorraine (front, at right) in a scene from Naughty But Nice (1927). Kathryn McGuire and Colleen Moore are beside her, and a teenage Loretta Young looks down on them.\n\nHer time on the Naughty but Nice set at least resulted in one of the only interviews I’ve seen with her, published by Moving Picture World on May 21, 1927:\n\n“A few days after Jean Lorraine finished working with Colleen Moore in ‘Naughty but Nice’, the latter’s latest First National production, she dropped into the World’s west coast office for a little chat. She was more than enthusiastic with the opportunities afforded her in Colleen’s picture. On the picture value of the picture itself she waxed as eloquent as a studio publicity man.\n\nAfter posing for the Moving Picture World camera a light luncheon resulted in an insight into her picture career. Between the soup and sandwich she informed the writer that she was born in Hollywood. This in itself is unique as the majority of the girls seeking fame before the camera trek here from distant parts of the country.\n\nHer first screen work was in Christie comedies, first as an extra to later in leading roles. Since joining the free-lance ranks she has had important featured roles in a number of big productions. […] We found Jean the possessor of a pleasing personality that could do naught but register to advantage upon the screen. She makes many of the so-called Hollywood beauties, billed as stars, take a back seat when it comes to a question of beauty and charm. She has both in large gobs.”\n\nMoving Picture World, May 21, 1927\n\nQuite a hefty compliment to end on. From here, Lorraine returned to Fox and was cast as one of Charles Farrell’s harem in Howard Hawks’ Fazil (1928), which went into production over the summer of 1927.\n\nJean Lorraine in a publicity photo for Fazil (1928), from Film Fun magazine, June 1928.\n\nThough hardly given any screen time as one of many scantily clad extras kept by the titular Prince, and is difficult to confidently identify due to the low quality of the available print, Lorraine was officially on the up-and-up after Fazil. Fox took notice of her and signed her as the leading lady opposite Richard Walling in Twenty Legs Under the Sea (1927), a bathing beauty short from Fox’s Imperial Comedy series that would mark her return to two-reelers.\n\n“Miss Lorraine, who Fox officials now believe is well on her way to stardom, plays the feminine lead,” said the LA Times of Twenty Legs on July 31.\n\nUnfortunately, this short, which fittingly sees Lorraine as ‘Miss America’ in an international poolside beauty contest, seems to have disappeared into thin air without as much as an entry in silent film databases; the last known vestige is its presence at a 1979 film club showing.\n\nJean Lorraine (center, in headscarf) in a scene from Twenty Legs Under the Sea (1927). From Motion Picture News, September 30, 1927\n\nLorraine’s personal life at this time seems like a perfect picture of Jazz Age Hollywood from the outside looking in; a freelance actress married to a cinematographer, living on a star-studded block off the Sunset Strip with a social calendar full of dinners at the Montmartre and various Santa Monica beach clubs. This is all well and good, but undoubtedly, Lorraine’s past traumas followed her; latent psychological wounds don’t disappear after a soirée or two, and this would become apparent in due time. She was still only twenty-one.\n\nAfter being hospitalized for a brush with appendicitis in early October 1927, Lorraine was absent from the screen for months, which isn’t entirely surprising given the context of the period. The Jazz Singer premiered during her recuperation and threw the cinema world for a loop. The physical silent comedy which helped Lorraine find her footing was fast becoming obsolete, with studios scrambling to equip themselves for sound. The young actress hadn’t as much as an intertitle to her name thus far; staking a claim in talkies was to wrangle an entirely new beast.\n\nLorraine, not quite established, might have been perceptive enough to realize the impact of sound on her career and broaden her horizons. Her next appearance was on stage at the Hollywood Playhouse in the Joseph Schildkraut-produced From Hell Came a Lady, a salty tale concerning the spunky proprietress of a seaside San Franciscan funfair.\n\nIn the midst of rehearsals, eight days ahead of the premiere, Lorraine made headlines—though not for her imminent stage debut.\n\n“GIRL, ROBBED OF JEWELS, SHOES, IS THROWN FROM AUTOMOBILE,” was bolded in the Los Angeles Evening Express on April 5, 1928.\n\nThe article details the late night of April 4, when a married couple was roused from their bed on Oakwood Avenue by the “hysterical screams” of a woman on their front porch. An ambulance was called as they were unable to calm the girl, who was identified by the police at the hospital as the “exceptionally good looking and well dressed” twenty-one-year-old Jean Lorraine.\n\nLorraine (still married) had allegedly gone out with a man she refused to identify, whose residence was at an “exclusive Hollywood club” they dined in the same night. The two had “several drinks” before starting out for a ride, where they quarreled. Lorraine’s date consequently stole her shoes, coat, and purse, as well as a diamond pin, before chasing her out of the car and onto the couple’s porch. She sustained a “bruised body”, a cut lip, and “shock”.\n\nLorraine told the police she had been “thrown” from the speeding car, though one witness from inside the couple’s house said the car had actually stopped out front before Lorraine ran out, with her date giving chase to the porch where her screams scared him off. Whatever truly happened that night will forever remain obscure; the article exclusively refers to Lorraine’s attacker as her “escort” and doesn’t reference any romance between them. Perhaps it was simply a soured connection that fizzled after somebody wanted more than married Lorraine was willing to give—either way, she was well enough by April 13 to make her appearance in the premiere of From Hell Came a Lady.\n\nThe play was well-received; it was held over for four weeks and attracted positive reviews, but Lorraine wouldn’t find another project until the fall. She returned to the screen with another hellish title, the thoroughly bizarre Seven Footprints to Satan (1929), a mostly-silent First National production of the “old dark house” type that went in front of cameras in October 1928.\n\nLorraine is tasked with the small role of a partygoer in a mysterious mansion, presided over by a robed villain known as “Satan”, who chooses her as one of two women to receive the honor of “sacrifice” at his altar—the other being Thelma Todd. Lorraine gets over a minute of screen time with a breathtaking closeup of her happy acceptance of Satan’s decree:\n\nLorraine would see a shorter gap between jobs after landing a plum role as “Ann” in January 1929, one of Clara Bow’s top three “whoopee girls” in the latter’s highly publicized first talkie, The Wild Party (1929). An effervescent albeit clumsy picture hindered by rudimentary technique and Bow’s palpable nervousness surrounding the transition to sound (which resulted in the impromptu creation of a boom mike prototype), the nonetheless lovable film explores the airtight bond shared by a group of flirtatious flappers in the fictitious Winston College dormitories.\n\nLorraine unmistakably wears the same sweater she wore for her 1927 interview with Moving Picture World in this Wild Party publicity picture: “Slipover jumper of harmonizing colors contribute to the attractiveness of the outfit displayed above by Jean Lorraine, new Paramount player.”\n\nThis would be Lorraine’s second time working with Dorothy Arzner, having been previously hand-picked by the director to appear in Fashions for Women. While her name was excluded from the opening credits, she appears with Clara in nearly every group scene in the film (accompanied by a fair amount of short, interspersed dialogue) and even utters one of its opening lines, just before the long-awaited reveal of Clara’s brassy Brooklyn accent.\n\n“Meet any new ones?” Lorraine, in a piping Betty Boop tone, asks dormmate Babs (Adrienne Doré) of potential conquests on her recent vacation.\n\n“Couple of dozen candidates for the All-American wrestling team,” replies Babs smartly, “you know a girl’s got to be an athlete nowadays to hold her own.”\n\nLorraine was featured prominently in publicity portraits, donning her lightning-rod teddy from the film’s party sequence next to Clara and the other starlets in her charge.\n\nFrom left to right: Alice Adair, Adrienne Doré, Clara Bow, and Jean Lorraine for The Wild Party (1929)\n\nWhile The Wild Party was a box-office hit, Bow’s timorousness aside, it didn’t immediately lead to more opportunities for Lorraine. Instead, the film’s time in theaters coincided with tawdry publicity surrounding a drawn-out, debauched divorce case between California real estate mogul Herman Helbush and his wife, who filed a headline-making motion for “separate maintenance” the very day of The Wild Party’s release on April 6, 1929.\n\nWhile the sordid details of the couple’s trysts and tussles are plenty enough to warrant its own blog post (the divorce proceedings dragged on for over six years), Lorraine’s name was enmeshed in the suit by way of confusion over the “other woman” named in the separate maintenance motion. This other woman was none other than the aforementioned Jeanne Lorraine Vanvliet, the Belgian ex-screen hopeful with a nearly identical stage name. The LA Times tacked this matter-of-fact correction from Lorraine onto the end of a Helbush item published on April 7:\n\n“Mrs. Alec Phillips, known on the screen as Jean Lorraine, said last night she does not know Helbush and is not the woman mentioned in the case. She said another Hollywood actress used the name and has been confused with her before.”\n\nDespite the accidental adverse publicity, Lorraine’s next move was diving headlong into the musical craze of the new sound era with a chorus role in Words and Music (1929). Another collegian romp produced over the summer, the Fox film featured Lois Moran, a purported ‘one hundred campus cuties’, and a youthful Duke Morrison, who was on the cusp of becoming John Wayne.\n\nThough one exhibitor’s review in Motion Picture News declared Words and Music was “the Scandals, Follies and all other Broadway revues rolled into a college comedy”, we’re left to use our imaginations, as the entire film has been lost to time; just another of the countless sacrificial offerings made at the nitrate altar.\n\nAround the same time, Lorraine returned to First National for an uncredited yet fairly visible role as “Polly”, a member of Dorothy Mackaill’s extravagant entourage in The Great Divide (1929). Lorraine’s Polly was similar in caliber to her role as Ann in The Wild Party; both parts were dignified with names, yet were given only a handful of brief lines. Both roles received ample screen time, but mostly in group sequences where Lorraine’s face, usually just over someone’s shoulder, blends into the background unless the viewer intends to seek her out.\n\nLorraine, just over Dorothy Mackaill’s shoulder in a scene from The Great Divide (1929)\n\nTwo Jean L’s: Jean Laverty (misidentified as Dorothy) and Jean Lorraine in a publicity photo for The Great Divide (1929)\n\nIf the advent of sound, identity mixups, and scandalous newspaper items couldn’t collectively kill Jean Lorraine’s career, the dismal state of affairs during the latter half of 1929 probably helped deal another crushing blow. The last verifiable title in her filmography is, ironically, The Great Divide, metaphorically delineating this era of her life from the next.\n\nPicture-Play magazine tersely replied with the following to an inquiring fan in September 1929:\n\n“Jean Lorraine is–or has been–with Fox.”\n\nA whirlwind of change had happened to Lorraine on top of the imminent Depression, to add insult to injury. She and husband Alex Phillips quietly separated sometime between the spring of 1929, when they were last mentioned as a couple, and the 1930 census, where neither of them can be easily located.\n\nOver two years of scouring names and records until this writer’s eyes glazed over have, unfortunately, not resulted in conclusively locating Lorraine in said census. Despite repeated searches, which included stringing together different combinations of Lorraine’s various names as if trying to unlock a safe, only one entry in the 1930 census appears to line up with her.\n\nOver at the Aloha Apartment Hotel on Leland Way, just a short jaunt down Sunset from Lorraine’s former home on Crescent Heights, lived twenty-three-year-old hat-check girl Rose O’Brien. Lodging with her was fellow twenty-three-year-old California native “Jean Lavoe”, unemployed and single; she told the census enumerator she was eighteen at the time of her first marriage. No other records for any “Jean Lavoe” matching these details can be located, leading this researcher to believe the enumerator could have made a fairly simple yet severe error.\n\nPhillips, meanwhile, famously forsook America soon after to live and work in Mexico, arriving in 1931 to film Santa (1932), the country’s first all-talking picture. He wouldn’t return. Choosing to embrace Mexican culture with open arms, Phillips became an integral part of their cinematic Golden Age, and is still revered as a pioneer today. In 1933, Phillips and sixteen-year-old Alicia Bolaños were married in Mexico City; he remained with her until his death in 1977.\n\nMeanwhile, Lorraine’s film career crashed to a screeching halt. While her prospects were indeed rosy just the year before, her sudden drop from the ranks is disappointing but not unexpected given her hapless circumstances in a town as tough as Hollywood; a story as old as time, and a trite one at that. New economic strife was, of course, just an added variable.\n\nLorraine promptly slipped under the radar and remained there throughout the first half of the 1930s. Her unfortunately timed disappearance came right as one-time child actress, the dancer Jean O’Rourke, opted for a classier stage name by borrowing the “Lorraine” from her “Lorraine & Digby” vaudeville act, creating a third Jean Lorraine in the process.\n\nOne of these Lorraines—either O’Rourke or ours—is credited as one of twenty dancing girls in the 1934 Jules White short Love Detectives, per a Columbia cast sheet from AMPAS. The predictable combination of ‘hard-to-find media’ and ‘grainy surviving print’ unfortunately doesn’t help with identification, which is regrettable given this pivotal point in our Lorraine’s career. In all likelihood, it was Jean O’Rourke who appeared in the picture.\n\nJean O’Rourke (using the name Jean Lorraine) went on to appear in a bit role in Turn Off the Moon (1937), which appears on the two actress’ commingled IMDB. Our Lorraine, however, started 1937 off on a different note, showing things were rapidly beginning to unravel; this is the first known mention of her in several years.\n\nEarly on January 8, our Lorraine’s landlady, Estelle Jarvis, found the thirty-year-old actress collapsed on the floor of her apartment at 351 1/2 North Stanley Avenue. Jarvis had apparently discovered her just after an overdose attempt involving a nameless sleep medication, and luckily, before it had taken effect. She called the police, and Lorraine was whisked away to Hollywood Hospital on Vermont Avenue in “critical condition”.\n\nAlthough Lorraine’s unidentified roommate swore it was an accident, the police found a “rambling” suicide note addressed to Lorraine’s mother at the scene. Newspaper articles on the situation contain a number of discrepancies, putting her age at anywhere from twenty-two to thirty-one and claiming she was “William Powell’s leading lady”.\n\nMeanwhile, Jean O’Rourke (as Jean Lorraine) went on to lend her charms to the background of Wells Fargo (1937). Ironically, Dolly Jarvis, the chorus girl daughter of our Lorraine’s landlord, was another name on the Wells Fargo cast list, which doesn’t make anything less complicated.\n\nCoincidentally, our Lorraine was living at another Jarvis-owned property, 171 North Vista, when a second alarming incident made the local news just the next year.\n\nOn July 5, 1938—just one day after what would have been Lorraine’s wedding anniversary—she was arrested near Malibu and charged with misdemeanor drunk driving.\n\nThe actress made it as far as Budwood Beach, which sat between Malibu and Santa Monica, before deputies pulled her over; she was released on $150 bail, a tad over $3,000 today.\n\nHer whereabouts from the summer of 1938 onward are mysterious, but in September of 1940, she married motion picture projectionist Myron Bonner in Yuma, Arizona.\n\nLorraine may very well be on the 1940 census with him, taken on April 20. Myron is listed as living alone, but married. The enumerator left a note below his entry that read “misinformed as to the number of occupants. Space left in error.”\n\nMore barren mystery enters the picture—six entire years of it. Lorraine filed for divorce in September of 1946. In the interim, her identity remains obscured, palpable yet elusive. Myron’s voter registrations from the first half of the 1940s also imply he’s living alone; no women appear that share his surname or address.\n\nOne confusing event brought into the fold was another having to do with Jean O’Rourke, who was still using the stage name Jean Lorraine. In February 1943, O’Rourke was injured in a Lisbon plane crash which also killed her husband and dance partner, Roy Rognan. The presence of other notable musical names like Tamara Draisin and Jane Froman in the mix assured the tragedy saw heavy publicity; one indirect consequence was the further erasure of our Lorraine’s singularity.\n\nFrom here, our Lorraine can be followed to 1013 South Burlington, per the 1948 Los Angeles telephone directory, which lists her as Frances M. Bonner. This address was just down the street from her childhood home on West 11th; whether memories or lifestyle choices possibly influenced her next move is unknown, but by 1950, she’s put herself up in Apartment 12 at 1433 Miramar. We now know that the divorced forty-three year old Lorraine is working as a telephone operator for a local hotel, and that she’s living alone.\n\n1950 advert for Lorraine’s apartment at 1433 Miramar\n\nLorraine’s next years were presumably full of much of the same humdrum of unstable living patterns around Los Angeles; while she stayed put at her PBX job, she couldn’t seem to do the same at one apartment. Her birth father, James Munsell, died in 1956 in San Bernardino, presumably without ever knowing his daughter.\n\nAnother half-decade passes before we find Lorraine at another nearby address at 615 South Virgil. Unfortunately, neither we or the fire department locate her alive. She was only fifty-one.\n\nIn the wee hours just after midnight on January 25, 1958, firefighters were summoned to Lorraine’s unit, where a blaze had broken out; while three engines were able to confine the flames to her apartment and douse them within mere minutes, fifty of the complex’s residents were displaced for the night.\n\nLorraine’s body was found ‘collapsed’ in her small dressing room; Battalion Chief Henry Bright told the press that she had apparently tried to fight the flames with a bedsheet, only to collapse from smoke inhalation during the effort. Bright also asserted that the fire started on Lorraine’s davenport, probably as a result of ‘careless smoking’.\n\nWhile this already tragic version of the story was floated in the press, with most articles painting Lorraine as the simple hapless heroine of a deadly situation, her death certificate supplies us with its poignant details.\n\nThe real culprit behind her death wasn’t smoke inhalation; the coroner deduced it was actually acute barbiturate intoxication. The firefighters couldn’t have known, as she was gone by the time they found her—the coroner gave Lorraine’s time of death as 11:00 PM, well before the fire department arrived on the scene. Whether the overdose was suicidal or accidental was left undetermined. Given Lorraine’s erratic history, it could very well have been either.\n\nThe particular sequence of events that unfolded on that night can only be pieced together through conjecture. Perhaps Lorraine did resolve to end her life and thought to cover it up with a fire; perhaps she simply took too much, left her cigarette unattended (or was too careless), and succumbed to the dual effects of smoke and medication. We will never know. What we do know is this is the type of personal tragedy that is frequently exploited by the Babylonesque vultures of Hollywood history; Lorraine’s personal choices, despite the myriad ways we can read into them today, don’t have to negate or otherwise scandalize a nearly forgotten woman’s death.\n\nLorraine’s only survivor was her mother, Laura, who was by now sixty-eight and widowed after the death of her fourth husband, Emanuel Kaiser. She did well by her daughter; Lorraine was cremated and received a beautiful niche in the Mausoleum of the Golden West at Inglewood Park Cemetery, which had space for two. Laura also paid for Lorraine’s obituary, and for a small service at Utter-McKinley’s Viewpark Chapel on Slauson Avenue.\n\nLorraine’s service announcement, however, was horribly bungled by the Los Angeles Times; while they issued an apology and a correction the next day, the damage had been done. Our Jean Lorraine was again conflated with Jean O’Rourke; details of the latter’s plane crash were included where they shouldn’t be, further blending the two women together.\n\n“Apparently there were two Jean Lorraines in show business,” admitted the Times with characteristic indifference.\n\nJean Lorraine’s service announcement from the LA Times, January 29, 1958. While every other detail is correct, Jean O’Rourke’s plane crash is accidentally attributed to her.\n\n…and the Times’ correction from January 30, 1958. Little did they know the confusion would persist for over sixty years.\n\nLorraine’s mother followed her in death just over a year later, on March 1, 1959. While she had moved back to her native Inland Empire, she was returned to her daughter’s niche in Inglewood to be buried beside her. I’m extremely thankful and eternally grateful to the staff at Inglewood Park Cemetery for supplying me with this 2023 image of their final resting place:\n\nAs I’ve spent quite the chunk of time and energy (as well as blood, sweat, and tears, et cetera) researching this lady, it’s a bittersweet feeling to wrap up my time with her. Pieces of the lives I look into always find their way into my heart, and Lorraine is no exception. For someone as obscure as she, I still find it notable that her life quite literally began–and ended–with headlines. She bore the typical curse of having issues completely unsupported by their era; while our current understanding of alcoholism and mental illness is they are for the most part, twin beasts, resources for both were scarce in Lorraine’s day, and shame was rife.\n\nObviously, Lorraine had some heavy baggage that couldn’t exactly be sorted out in her time, either. While we’re extraordinarily lucky to have therapy and medication today, I can’t imagine trying to deal with mental illness in an era where the solutions are nearly limited to institutionalization or lobotomy. You really had to do what you had to do—and in Lorraine’s case, she tried to keep herself sane with the vices of the time. You can’t exactly blame her.\n\nAnd while we could focus on, dissect, draw comparisons, and mourn the strife she saw forever, I’d prefer to remember Miss Jean Lorraine in her heyday; a cheeky, pert brunette with a sense of humor and bit of wits about her. Al Christie saw something in her—I do too."
