        "text": "AS the snowballing box-office success of “Avatar” suggests a paradigm shift in film, it’s rewarding to contemplate the last time the movies assumed a new dimension, that of sound.\n\nThe gradual transition from silent films to talkies took place between 1926 and 1930 and included many small steps  both technological developments and adjustments to audience expectations  before it was complete. Many of these steps are vividly illustrated by a group of nine early musicals released last month by the Warner Archive Collection, the burn-on-demand division of Warner Home Video.\n\nThe limited scale of the Archive Collection makes sense for these titles, most of which are in imperfect condition and would not have been suitable for a mass-market home video release. Some were shot in two-color Technicolor and survive only as black-and-white prints that suffer from fuzzy definition and low contrast. Others have their Technicolor sequences intact but are marred by dirt and scratches. All of these films reflect the limitations on sound recording of the time; to modern ears they will seem hollow and tinny.\n\nThe transition to sound was carried on the backs of two genres, the gangster film and the musical. Gangster films were already in vogue, thanks to the success of Josef von Sternberg’s “Underworld” (1927), but they flourished when sound introduced the sensational elements of chattering machine guns, screaming tires and, most important, the varied timbres of contemporary American speech, bursting with vivid idioms (“Aw, go slip on the ice!”) and filtered through every accent known to man.\n\nEarly talkies seemed to revel in the range and diversity of American English, from the elocutionary exercises of transplanted Broadway stars like Conrad Nagel and Claudette Colbert to the creative manglings practiced by ethnic comedians like Benny Rubin, Stepin Fetchit, Leo Carrillo and Herman Bing. Here is what America sounded like before time and television made Nebraskans of us all.\n\nMusic, of course, was a key component of the Vitaphone short subjects that, as they began to appear in 1926, probably played the crucial role in establishing sound as an added value for audiences: “The Jazz Singer,” for example, was preceded by the 1926 Vitaphone short “A Plantation Act” in which Al Jolson performed three songs in blackface and employed his famous signature line, “You ain’t heard nothin’ yet.” Some of the early musical features resemble random collections of shorts strung together  isolated musical numbers and comedy bits introduced by masters of ceremonies.\n\nMost of the studios made revue films as a quick way to get their stars before the microphones  and to see who would survive the transition and who would not. The Warner Archive Collection batch includes two of them. MGM’s “Hollywood Revue of 1929” features many of that studio’s fabled roster of contract players  John Gilbert, Norma Shearer, Buster Keaton, Joan Crawford, William Haines  gamely singing, dancing and performing comedy bits; from Warner Brothers, “The Show of Shows” seems almost aggressive in the way it pits the studio’s biggest stars of the silent era, including John Barrymore and Rin Tin Tin, against peppy newcomers like Sally Eilers and Chester Morris.\n\nAnother strain of early musicals consisted of Broadway shows simply transplanted to Hollywood (or Astoria) sound stages and back lots. The Warner Archive Collection includes RKO’s 1929 “Rio Rita,” a Florenz Ziegfeld hit from 1927 with songs by Harry Tierney and Joseph McCarthy. An operetta with a western theme, the film is at its most awkward when it is straining to be cinematic, by staging the action on a back-lot ranchero; it recovers its fluidity in the final two reels  presented here in well-preserved red-and-green Technicolor  which take place on a highly stylized interior set representing a gambling ship.\n\nWarner Brothers persuaded the Broadway favorite Charlotte Greenwood (“Oklahoma!”) to recreate her 1916 Broadway hit “So Long Letty” (1929) for the Vitaphone cameras, with the play’s startling wife-swapping plot intact. (Enforcement of the Production Code was almost five years away.)\n\nThe oddest of this bunch is “Golden Dawn,” a transplant of a bizarre 1927 show by Oscar Hammerstein II, Otto Harbach and Emmerich Kalman. The film is set during World War I in a jungle encampment in German East Africa, where captured British officers look on in imperialist frustration as the local savages prepare to sacrifice a white virgin (Vivienne Segal) to their “grinning, wooden god,” and Noah Beery, in blackface as a Simon Legree-like overseer, croons a love song to his favorite whip. Filmed entirely in Technicolor, it survives only in black-and-white, which may be just as well.\n\nThe most fertile of the early forms, though, was the backstage musical. Direct inspiration may have come from the show business plotline of “The Jazz Singer” (and of that film’s more financially successful follow-up, “The Singing Fool”). But the father of all backstage musicals was probably “Broadway,” an enormously successful 1926 stage piece by George Abbott and Philip Dunning (brilliantly filmed by Paul Fejos for Universal in 1929, and a movie in dire need of restoration).\n\nBy cutting between the stylized performance space of the stage to the naturalistic drama unfolding in the wings, the backstage musical offered a way of integrating music and dialogue that did not disrupt the established tenets of movie realism. Audience members who may have been tempted to laugh when the jungle girl of “Golden Dawn” started crooning the love song “My Bwanna” had no trouble accepting show folk doing much the same thing.\n\n“On With the Show!,” directed by the Alan Crosland (“The Jazz Singer”) and released in 1929, establishes many of the themes that would soon become clichés: the bankrupt producer (Sam Hardy) hustling for money; the temperamental star (Betty Compson); the lovable stage doorman, Dad (Thomas Jefferson); the chorus girl (Sally O’Neil) who goes out there a nobody and comes back a star.\n\n“They Learned About Women” (1930) offers the forgotten vaudeville team of Joe Schenck and Gus Van as baseball players who work as song-and-dance men in the off-season. (A woman comes along and nearly breaks up their act.) “It’s a Great Life” (1929) presents the equally obscure Rosetta and Vivian Duncan as a pair of performing sisters. (A man comes along and nearly breaks up their act.) Mervyn LeRoy’s 1930 “Show Girl in Hollywood” is a backstage musical set in a movie studio that also functions as a documentary on early sound technology.\n\nAs glimpsed in LeRoy’s film that technology now seems outlandishly cumbersome. Noisy, clattering contraptions, cameras still had to be isolated in soundproof booths, from which they peered with fixed, telephoto lenses. Because sound mixing was still primitive, and the trick of performing to a recorded “playback” had not yet been discovered, live orchestras had to be present off screen to accompany the performers. Musical sequences were performed in continuity, with as many as six cameras (as we see at one point in “Show Girl”) positioned at different angles, to allow intercutting in the editing room.\n\nThe results could be visually flat and dramatically stiff, but because no one had yet laid down the rules, there was also a freedom to experiment in the air. For example, in “It’s a Great Life,” directed by the decidedly nonadventurous Sam Wood, one of the Duncan sisters suddenly “hears” the other calling her name from her sickbed in another city, a blatantly nonnaturalistic use of sound that would have been problematical just a year later.\n\nIntriguingly, as sound grew more naturalistic, the visual element was allowed to become more unreal. Gradually the static camera assuming the position of a spectator in the center of the auditorium unmoors itself and begins to float free, assuming “impossible” angles, like overhead shots of the chorus line. And where the production numbers of 1929 mostly respect the actual dimensions of a theater stage, by 1930 they had expanded into the non-Euclidean dream space that Busby Berkeley would soon be exploring so brilliantly. “It’s a Great Life” climaxes with a Technicolor production number, “Sailing on a Sunbeam,” that erases any sense of a proscenium, as giggling chorus girls glide down giant chutes in every direction.\n\nHollywood turned out too many musicals in those first years of sound, and audiences grew tired of them: it’s said that some theaters started advertising “Not a musical” to lure patrons back. Will Hollywood overproduce fantasies and space operas as the industry tries to recapture the 3-D magic of “Avatar,” or will it learn, as it did once before, to spread the new technology to other genres and other forms? The grace period will last about two years, or so history suggests.\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nCHE Steven Soderbergh’s ambitious, two-part, 261-minute biography of Che Guevara (Benicio Del Toro), presented as contrasting studies in success (the Cuban revolution of Part 1) and failure (the disastrous Bolivian campaign of Part 2). “In chronicling the deeds of their hero  and the heroism of Ernesto Guevara is not something ‘Che’ has any interest in questioning  Mr. Soderbergh and the screenwriter, Peter Buchman, restrict themselves to a narrow register of themes and effects,” A. O. Scott wrote of the film in The New York Times in December 2008. “Its motifs are facial hair, tobacco smoke and earnest militant bombast.” (Criterion, Blu-ray $49.95, standard definition $49.95, R)\n\nGAMER A new generation of video games allows players to use real-life prisoners as their avatars in gladiatorial duels to the death. With Gerard Butler, Michael C. Hall and Kyra Sedgwick; directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. “If you thought that Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (the brain trust behind the “Crank” franchise) had already plumbed the basement of bad taste, be prepared to discover the sub-basement,” Jeannette Catsoulis wrote of the movie in The Times in September, adding that the movie is “a futuristic vomitorium of bosoms and bullets.” (Lionsgate, Blu-ray $39.99, standard definition $29.95, R)\n\nTHE INVENTION OF LYING Ricky Gervais stars in and co-directed (with Matt Robinson) this comedy, set in a world where the concept of an untruth does not exist  until a failed screenwriter (Mr. Gervais) makes a signal discovery. With Jennifer Garner, Jonah Hill and Jeffrey Tambor. Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times in October that “while the movie is a conceptual pip filled with quotable laughs and gentle pokes at religious faith at its most literal, it also looks so shoddy that you yearn for the camerawork, lighting and polish of his shows, like the original ‘The Office,’ because, really, these days TV rarely looks this bad.” (Warner Home Video, Blu-ray $35.99, standard definition $28.98, PG-13)\n\nYOU, THE LIVING From Roy Andersson of Sweden (“Songs from the Second Floor”), a haunting black comedy constructed as a series of elaborately staged tableaus. “The film is slow, rigorously morose and often painful in its blunt reckoning of disappointment and failure,” Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in July. “It is also extremely funny.” (Tartan Video, $19.93, not rated)\n\n8 1/2 Federico Fellini’s influential fantasia, about a filmmaker (Marcello Mastroianni) who fears he has run out of ideas, gets a handsome Blu-ray upgrade. “Here is a piece of entertainment that will really make you sit up straight and think, a movie endowed with the challenge of a fascinating intellectual game,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The Times in 1963. (Criterion, $39.95, not rated)"
