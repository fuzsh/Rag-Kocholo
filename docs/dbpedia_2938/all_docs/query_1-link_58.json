        "text": "A sound film is a motion picture (or movie) with sound that has been synchronised with the image. Before sound films, there was only silent film, and dialogue was shown in words on the screen. The first known exhibition of sound movies took place in Paris in 1900. But sound movies were not widely made commercially until a long time later. The first commercial screening of a short sound movie took place in New York City in April 1923. They are now the standard kind of technology for movie making.\n\nImages for kids\n\nImage from The Dickson Experimental Sound Film (1894 or 1895), produced by W.K.L. Dickson as a test of the early version of the Edison Kinetophone, combining the Kinetoscope and phonograph.\n\nEric M. C. Tigerstedt (1887–1925) was one of pioneers of sound-on-film technology. Tigerstedt in 1915.\n\nNewspaper ad for a 1925 presentation of Phonofilm shorts, touting their technological distinction: no phonograph.\n\nPoster for Warner Bros.' Don Juan (1926), the first major motion picture to premiere with a full-length synchronized soundtrack. Audio recording engineer George Groves, the first in Hollywood to hold the job, would supervise sound on Woodstock, 44 years later.\n\nWestern Electric engineer E. B. Craft, at left, demonstrating the Vitaphone projection system. A Vitaphone disc had a running time of about 11 minutes, enough to match that of a 1,000-foot (300 m) reel of 35 mm film.\n\nNewspaper ad from a fully equipped theater in Tacoma, Washington, showing The Jazz Singer, on Vitaphone, and a Fox newsreel, on Movietone, together on the same bill.\n\nDorothy Mackaill and Milton Sills in The Barker, First National's inaugural talkie. The film was released in December 1928, two months after Warner Bros. acquired a controlling interest in the studio.\n\nThe first Soviet talkie, Putevka v zhizn (The Road to Life; 1931), concerns the issue of homeless youth. As Marcel Carné put it, \"in the unforgettable images of this spare and pure story we can discern the effort of an entire nation.\"\n\nDirector Heinosuke Gosho's Madamu to nyobo (The Neighbor's Wife and Mine; 1931), a production of the Shochiku studio, was the first major commercial and critical success of Japanese sound cinema.\n\nShow Girl in Hollywood (1930), one of the first sound films about sound filmmaking, depicts microphones dangling from the rafters and multiple cameras shooting simultaneously from soundproofed booths. The poster shows a camera unboothed and unblimped, as it might be when shooting a musical number with a prerecorded soundtrack.\n\nExample of a variable-area sound track—the width of the white area is proportional to the amplitude of the audio signal at each instant.\n\nThe unkind cover of Photoplay, December 1929, featuring Norma Talmadge. As movie historian David Thomson puts it, \"sound proved the incongruity of [her] salon prettiness and tenement voice.\"\n\nPremiering February 1, 1929, MGM's The Broadway Melody was the first smash-hit talkie from a studio other than Warner Bros. and the first sound film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nPoster for Acabaram-se os otários (1929), performed in Portuguese. The first Brazilian talkie was also the first anywhere in an Iberian language.\n\nWestfront 1918 (1930) was celebrated for its expressive re-creation of battlefield sounds, like the doomful whine of an unseen grenade in flight.\n\nSee also"
