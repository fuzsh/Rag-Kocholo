        "text": "For 25 years, Sofia Coppola’s films have served as a stylistic manual for how to be sad, or at least disaffected, in our modern age.\n\nHer films consistently put us at eye level with young women trapped in gilded cages — whether it’s in a luxury hotel in Tokyo, amid the hallowed columns of Graceland or in a comfortable two-story suburban home under the watch of overprotective parents. She’s taught us how to lie out endlessly, corpse-like, by the Chateau Marmont pool, blocking out the crassness of the Sunset Strip with designer shades. Her characters consistently retreat to the bathtub, pensively soaking while they consider their lot. Through her lens, Marie Antoinette’s private faux-rustic retreat on the grounds of Versailles — seen by Antoinette’s real-life contemporaries as a sign of the oblivious excess of the monarchy — becomes cottagecore inspo, some well-deserved grass to touch for a woman who just needs some Me Time.\n\nI’ve lost track of how many of my cinephile friends I’ve seen post their pilgrimages to the Park Hyatt Tokyo, where a hangdog Bill Murray sipped whisky and contemplated the meaninglessness of life in “Lost in Translation.” Even I have not been able to resist zipping up to the 52nd floor to smoke cigarettes and listen to smooth jazz over the twinkling lights of Shinjuku.\n\nMs. Coppola’s sense of good taste is undeniable and effortless, and her movies make you feel young, beautiful and sad. It’s an incredibly seductive proposition, one that has earned her outsize critical respect, a cult fan following and a distinctive place in the contemporary canon.\n\nShe’s also had an enormous influence on the iconography of feminine melancholy — as much as Martin Scorsese has had on the language of male insecurity and rage — manifested in all corners of the culture, whether it’s Fashion Week runways, the heroines of the writer Ottessa Moshfegh or even the odd Katy Perry or Shawn Mendes music video. At a time when real-life adolescent malaise is once again at the forefront of conversation, Ms. Coppola’s canon demonstrates that while she didn’t invent the idea of the sad girl, she’s elevated it to the status of icon: devising an intoxicatingly inert heroine who confers on sadness a kind of hypnotic allure.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
