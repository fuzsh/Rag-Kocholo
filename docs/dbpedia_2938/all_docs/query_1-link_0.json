        "text": "This film is lost. Yes, it is. I am sick and tired of reading \"F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre\" reviews on the IMDb of films that are completely and irrevocably lost like this one, and stating he has seen them recently. He does it constantly, one after the other. Since he's just reading about them in old Photoplay magazines and the like, and putting his own spin on them, knowing that no one can check his \"facts\" about films that have been lost for 70-80 years, he's obviously just flaunting himself falsely. Notice he never states where or how he gets to view these lost films. It's a joke!\n\nI know you probably won't print this review, IMBb, but sorry, this one made me break my silence.\n\nUpdate: Someone else complained about Gwynplaine's fake review and IMDb removed his review. (I wish they'd take more of them off)."
