        "text": "Vitaphone disc from a film Sunny (1930, USA), double sided 16-inch disc, in original sleeve.\n\nSide 1: No. 5, FA4580-2-55. A First National Production. Sunny score Reel no. 5 scratched onto disc\n\nSide 2: No. 7, FA4582-2-58. A First National Production. Sunny Score Reel no. 7 scratched onto disc.\n\nVitaphone was a sound film system used for feature films and nearly 1,000 short subjects made by Warner Bros. and its sister studio First National from 1926 to 1931. Vitaphone was the last major analog sound-on-disc system and the only one which was widely used and commercially successful. The soundtrack was not printed on the film itself, but issued separately on phonograph records. The discs, recorded at ​33 1⁄3 rpm (a speed first used for this system) and typically 16 inches (41 cm) in diameter, would be played on a turntable physically coupled to the projector motor while the film was being projected, achieving a frequency response of 4300 Hz.. Many early talkies, such as The Jazz Singer (1927), used the Vitaphone system. The name \"Vitaphone\" derived from the Latin and Greek words, respectively, for \"living\" and \"sound\"."
