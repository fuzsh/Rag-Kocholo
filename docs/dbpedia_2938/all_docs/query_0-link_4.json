        "text": "Egotist Withers, a one-time college football star, paid little attention to former coed Olmstead when both attended their alma mater. When they meet again as employees in an investment house, he begins to take notice of her. Better at passing a ball than he is at peddling a bond, he is about to be fired from his job when his boss notices that he has a way with the ladies. He is pressed into service selling bad bonds to flirtatious females, his boss planning to use him as the fall guy when the swindle is exposed. Olmstead apprises him of the plan, and Withers reimburses the gullible girls with money he gets by cozening his boss' own wife with the fake bonds. This pleasant musical play employed Western Electric's Vitaphone sound-on-disc system in its talkie release; it was simultaneously released in a shorter non-musical silent version for theaters which lacked the playback equipment. Songs include \"I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now\" (Frank Adams, Will Hough, Joe Howard), \"Collegiate\" (Mo Jaffe, Nat Bonx), \"Doin' the Raccoon\" (Raymond Klages, J. Fred Coots, Herb Magidson), \"Fashionette\" (Robert King, Jack Glogan), \"Jack and Jill\" (Larry Spier, Sam Coslow), \"How Many Times\" (Irving Berlin), \"Everything I Do I Do for You\" (Al Sherman), \"If You Could Care\" (E. Ray Goetz, Arthur Wimperis, Herman Darewski)."
