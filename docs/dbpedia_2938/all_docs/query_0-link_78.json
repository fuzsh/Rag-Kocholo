        "text": "Article content\n\nOn Oct. 6, 1927, The Jazz Singer had its premiere in New York City.\n\nToday, the Warner Brothers movie is often referred to as the first “talkie,” or motion picture with sound. It wasn’t, but Warner’s new “Vitaphone” sound technology allowed music and dialogue to be synchronized with the film, and it was a sensation.\n\nThat said, there was only two minutes of dialogue in the movie — it was mostly a silent film. The excitement came from the sound accompanying 11 musical numbers, which included the film’s star Al Jolson singing Toot, Toot, Tootsie and My Mammy.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nBut a sensation in 1927 didn’t go viral like today. Warner Brothers was a small studio, and the film rolled out surprisingly slowly.\n\nThe Los Angeles premiere wasn’t until Dec. 28, 1927, and the movie didn’t make it to Vancouver until Jan. 12, 1929, over 15 months after it made its debut at the Warner Theatre in New York.\n\nWarner must not have had a Canadian distributor — the movie played the Avalon Theatre in Bellingham March 7-16, 1928, 10 months before it came to B.C. Its Canadian debut was in Montreal on Dec. 1, 1928.\n\nIn any event, the masses loved it.\n\n“Its first performance in New York called forth such enthusiasm as I have never seen before in a film parlor,” wrote New York critic Robert Sherwood.\n\n“Everyone wept, including Al Jolson himself, who was called upon for a speech after the final fadeout. He was too overcome to tell the audience (his usual farewell), ‘Folks, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.’”\n\nThe movie was based upon a 1925 play by Samuel Raphaelson and was supposedly inspired by Jolson’s own life. Essentially it’s the story of a young Jewish Cantor singer who is being groomed “to carry on the old tradition and devote his life to the faith of his ancestors.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut young Jakie Rabinowitz had other ideas.\n\n“His heart beats in time to the pulse of America, and in that beat is the rhythm of jazz,” said Sherwood.\n\nHis father casts him out of the family and over time he becomes a jazz sensation. But he returns to his faith when his dying father requests he sing in the synagogue on the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur, a Jewish religious holiday.\n\nIt sounds schmaltzy, but the addition of sound sent the movie into a new realm for the cinema.\n\n“A mediocre picture, as mere pictures go, it is lifted by the sheer magic of Jolson’s voice to the levels of extraordinary entertainment,” said Sherwood.\n\n“Due to the excellence of the Vitaphone attachment, his marvellous voice, the clapping of his hands, the nervous shuffling of his feet, the very sobs with which he punctuates his high notes come out from the shadows on the screen with an amazing semblance of reality.”\n\nThe most bizarre aspect of the film by modern standards is that Jolson sings some songs in blackface, which white entertainers had been doing since the 1830s. Jolson had been performing in blackface since the early 1900s, and was one of vaudeville’s biggest stars.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Jazz Singer swept the U.S. when it achieved wide release. According to an article on the Library of Congress website, by March, 1928 it was showing in 235 theatres and by 1931 had earned $2 million, almost five times its $422,000 budget.\n\nFilm studios soon went whole hog into talkies, but movie legend Samuel Goldwyn was leery. Goldwyn told the New York Times that the success of The Jazz Singer was largely due to Al Jolson, and warned “that the industry is suffering from hysteria and that if producers were not careful it would go on the rocks.”\n\nThe irony of The Jazz Singer taking so long to get to Vancouver is that it wasn’t the first talkie in local theatres. That honour belonged to Mother Knows Best, which opened at The Capitol Theatre on Oct. 21, 1928. Oddly it featured the movie’s star, Madge Bellamy, singing Mammy in blackface.\n\nWhen The Jazz Singer did finally make it to town in 1929 it was a big success.\n\n“The capacity house at the Capitol Saturday evening paid Jolson just tribute and exemplified the hold that the picture takes on its viewers when it greeted its songs with salvos of applause,” the Sun reported Jan. 14, 1929.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\njmackie@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nEvery once in awhile, though, old streetcar ads made out of cardboard pop up in antique stores or on Craigslist or eBay. Not ads for the streetcar, but ads that ran on the streetcar, usually at the front.\n\nOne of the cool things about going through old newspapers is finding giant ads for movies you’ve never heard of. Case in point: Christmas Day 1921, when the William Fox spectacular Queen of Sheba hit the Allen Theatre.\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the news you need to know — add VancouverSun.com and TheProvince.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.\n\nYou can also support our journalism by becoming a digital subscriber: For just $14 a month, you can get unlimited, ad-lite access to The Vancouver Sun, The Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites.
