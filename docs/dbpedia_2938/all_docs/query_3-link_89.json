        "text": "Physical Description\n\nVitaphone discs (56), for synchronised playing with film, shellac composite, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, United States of America, 1928-1936. Collection of fifty-six vitaphone or audio disc records used with moving pictures. All of the records are recorded on one side only and bear either a gold or white label with information concerning the disc. The Vitaphone disks are a nototiously fragile medium - in physical composition, fidelity and handling. They are composed of shellac with fibre or board centres which was not a quiet surface for the elecro-mecanical pick-up of the time and became worn after each subsequent use. There is a ring of numbers on the centre of each label where the operator would cross out a number after each use up to 40. The synchronised starting point for the audio program is also clearly identified on the blank shellac at the centre (with the disks running at 33 & a 1/3 from centre to outside) - this start point coincided with a starting frame on the film component which would be lined up in the gate. The disks are also very large making handling and transport difficult."
