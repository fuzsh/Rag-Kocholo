        "text": "By 1926, Warner Bros. Entertainment was still in many ways an emerging entertainment company. Having come in to existence only three years earlier, the company looked to adopt sound film technology at a time when the innovation was still very much considered a passing fad in entertainment.\n\nVitaphone was originally maintained by Western Electric, one of two organizations which had a complete stranglehold on amplification equipment. In 1925, Warner Bros. purchased Vitaphone from Western Electric, impressed by the familiarity of the sound-on-disc system. The familiarity of Vitaphone made it relatively easy to use, but its reliance on a record to produce sound meant the synchronization was often off, which could lead to disastrous results such as the instance observed by Case Lab employee Dwight Eldred:\n\n”The gossip about town this morning is as follows: Last night at the Vitaphone show when Martinelli came out and opened his mouth to start singing, the audience was greeted with the delightful strains of Roy Smeck's banjo. It apparently ruined their show, but was amusing to all of us and thought you would like to know about it.\n\nThe observation by Dwight Eldred occurred while viewing Vitaphone’s debut feature, Don Juan, which included a series of shorts beforehand and a musical score played entirely on Vitaphone. While audiences predominantly enjoyed the experience, the entertainment industry remained cautious due to the difficulty of implementing a sound-on-disc system on a wide scale. As Fox debuted Movietone in 1927 with newsreels and its own feature length film, Warner Brothers released their blockbuster, The Jazz Singer. The film would create such a sensation with audiences that the company was catapulted to become a dominant force in the entertainment industry, rivalled only by Fox.\n\nOn the technological side, however, Warner Brothers’ early success was largely despite Vitaphone’s drawbacks rather than because of it. While the studio was able to negotiate near exclusive implementation of the system in movie theaters due to their contract with Western Electric, Vitaphone proved to be so cumbersome that it only briefly was capable of competing with Movietone and later sound-on-film systems. Warner Brothers would shortly adopt their own sound-on-film system and Vitaphone would be largely abandoned by the 30s, with Movietone proving to be commercially successful on a much wider scale."
