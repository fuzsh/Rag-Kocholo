        "text": "Vitaphone Varieties\n\nFans of Preston Sturges will probably recognize Jimmy Conlin, an impish little Irishman with wild hair and owlish glasses who turns up at one point or another in nearly all of Sturges’s great Paramount comedies of the 1940s.\n\nBut here he is, in one of the 60 short films that make up “Vitaphone Varieties,” a fascinating new four-disc set from the Warner Archive Collection, as a vaudeville star in 1928. Working with his wife, the blues-belting singer Myrtle Glass, Conlin goofs and grins his way through a comedy musical routine, the punch lines punctuated by an unseen chorus of kibitzers who holler “Whoa!” every time Jimmy lands a good one.\n\nMyrtle playfully roughs him up, as Jimmy struggles manfully to provide a piano accompaniment for her rendition of “Morning, Noon and Night,” a delightfully casual routine that the performers seem to be inventing on the spot, enjoying themselves tremendously as they do so, even though they’d probably been doing it five times a day for years on the vaudeville circuit. There is one new line, though, as they sing their way offstage: “We hate to leave you here alone/But we hope you liked Jimmy Conlin and Myrtle Glass/on the Vitaphone.”\n\nThat one short phrase — “on the Vitaphone” offered as an equivalent to “on the radio” or “on your record player,” to name the two other technologies that were reshaping popular entertainment in the 1920s — says a lot about the status of the talking film in the summer of 1928, when “Sharps and Flats,” as the Conlin and Glass short was titled, appeared in Warner Brothers’ flagship theaters. Despite the popular (and apparently unshakable) notion that the talkie revolution occurred overnight with the premiere of the Al Jolson feature “The Jazz Singer” on Oct. 6, 1927, the truth is far more complex and far more interesting.\n\nAs Donald Crafton demonstrated in his classic history “The Talkies” (University of California Press), “The Jazz Singer” was only a single step, and not one particularly well remarked at the time, in the gradual transition to sound that took place between 1926 and 1931. By the time Jolson improvised a few lines of dialogue in “The Jazz Singer,” audiences had already become accustomed to hearing actors speak and musicians perform from the screen.\n\nWarners had been turning out its “Vitaphone Varieties” — one, and later, two-reel recordings of comedians, jazz bands, classical musicians and even short plays — at a rapid pace since the summer of 1926, when the studio unveiled its new sound-on-disc process at the new Warners’ Theater in New York. Meanwhile the Fox Film Corporation was showing off its rival sound-on-film process, Movietone, with newsreels, including Charles A. Lindbergh’s historic 1927 takeoff from Roosevelt Field on Long Island that demonstrated Movietone’s lesser fidelity but greater portability. It’s a wonder that Jolson’s apparently prophetic line, “You ain’t heard nothin’ yet” (actually a stock phrase from his stage show) could be heard at all above the general din issuing from Broadway’s movie theaters.\n\nFew if any producers were thinking at the time of full-length talking features. The Vitaphone, first and foremost, was to be a way of bringing elite culture to the masses — like radio (but better). It would allow the benighted souls between the coasts to enjoy Marion Talley singing arias from the Metropolitan Opera or the New York Philharmonic playing snatches from “Tannhäuser.” But soon more popular acts began to appear.\n\nThe new Warner compilation begins with “The Revelers,” a male quartet harmonizing pleasantly on “Dinah” and a couple of other standards in a club setting. And although the technology of 1926 allows the performance to be recorded only as a single take from a fixed camera position, the effect is already more cinematic, more intimate, than a simple stage presentation.\n\nWarner released a large set of Vitaphone shorts last year (“Vitaphone Cavalcade of Musical Comedy Shorts”) that ranged up to 1938, when the studio discontinued the Vitaphone brand. This collection concentrates on earlier work, much of it uncovered through the untiring efforts of Ron Hutchinson of the nonprofit Vitaphone Project and restored by the U.C.L.A. Film & Television Archive and the Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation.\n\nThe surprise is the large number of nonsense comedians, specialists in crazy non sequiturs and bizarre visual gags, like the Mutt and Jeff comedy pair Born and Lawrence or the British brother act Val and Ernie Stanton, whose surreal riffs demonstrate that the Marx Brothers were far from alone in practicing this kind of anarchic humor.\n\nAs the collection, which is largely arranged chronologically, moves toward 1930 and the normalization of the talking feature, the form of the films becomes more sophisticated, with multiple camera angles and occasionally more than one set. The proscenium effect fades away, and the films seem less like fly-in-amber records of stage presentations than little movies in their own right. The musical short would continue to exist until it was finally killed off by television, where variety shows provided a final showcase for the kind of specialty performers seen here in their prime. We now live in a world without Surprising Fiddlers and are perhaps a bit worse for it. (Warner Archive Collection, $49.95, not rated)\n\nKukla, Fran and Ollie\n\nThe close resemblance of the Vitaphone shorts to early television is driven home by the irresistibly appealing “Kukla, Fran and Ollie: The First Episodes,” an independently produced and released two-disc set, available through Amazon. It gathers 20 black-and-white kinescopes of this pioneering show, created by Burr Tillstrom, first broadcast between 1949 and 1954. Like early sound, the technical limitations of early television mandated a distanced, theatrical approach: one camera, facing the stage, recording the performance in a single take broken only occasionally by close-up insert shots.\n\nAnd yet these shows could hardly seem more intimate. With Tillstrom, a gifted puppeteer, performing a cast of characters, the Kuklapolitan Players, from behind a puppet stage, and Fran Allison, an actress and singer, interacting with the puppets from out front, the program offered 30 minutes of improvised comedy every weeknight at 6 p.m. Central time, from the NBC affiliate in Chicago.\n\nThough aimed at children, the show soon attracted an adult following. (Fans included James Thurber and Orson Welles.) Partly this was because Tillstrom was able to allegorize some grown-up themes. One famous episode, “Lemonade,” becomes a satire on American business practices, as the financially naïve Kukla vainly tries to make a go of his lemonade stand.\n\nBut more likely the show’s success was due to the casual interplay among the calm, philosophical Kukla (a human figure with a big bald head and astonished eyebrows), the slightly sarcastic, more self-interested Ollie (a dragon, whose single, floppy tooth didn’t look terribly threatening), and Fran, a sisterly figure who offered just enough adult supervision.\n\nEven today the show’s relaxed tone, slow pacing and gentle humor seem deeply therapeutic. For an America recovering from a world war and sinking into a new and deeply unpopular conflict in Korea, the Kuklapolitans must have seemed like welcome emissaries from a world where violence was unknown, and tensions could be resolved with the nuzzle of a felt nose. They scarcely seem less so now. (The Burr Tillstrom Copyright Trust, $14.95, not rated)\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nNO STRINGS ATTACHED From the veteran director Ivan Reitman (“Ghostbusters”), a romantic comedy about two friends (Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher) who make a vow not to fall in love with each other. Good luck with that. With Cary Elwes, Greta Gerwig and Kevin Kline. “It is hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Reitman shot six or seven movies and then went into the editing room blindfolded to splice them all together,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in January. (DreamWorks, Blu-ray/DVD combo edition $39.99, DVD $29.99, R)\n\nBLUE VALENTINE The impulsive marriage and slow break-up of a couple in an indie drama directed by Derek Cianfrance. “Leonard Cohen has a song about being danced to the end of love, but Mr. Cianfrance’s characters, Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams), stumble and crawl in that direction, having forgotten the nimble, playful steps they once knew,” Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in December. (The Weinstein Company, Blu-ray $39.99, DVD $29.98, R)\n\nTHE ILLUSIONIST Sylvain Chomet’s hand-drawn animated feature is based on an unproduced screenplay by the French comedian Jacques Tati about a music hall magician who befriends a vulnerable teenage girl. “ ‘The Illusionist’ is both a modest homage to its writer and a melancholy look at a lost world,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times in December. (Sony Pictures Classics, Blu-ray/DVD combo edition $38.96, PG)"
