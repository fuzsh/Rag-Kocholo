All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.\n\nAN ALL-COLORED VITAPHONE SHOW at Film Forum (May 20, 6:20 p.m.). Instead of combining film frames with an optical soundtrack, Vitaphone, an early sound system, synchronized the moving image with a record. This program highlights a variety of shorts made with the system that were showcases for African-American artists, including Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway and Ethel Waters. The following week, on May 28, Film Forum will host a tribute to Ron Hutchinson, who died in February; he was a founder of the Vitaphone Project, a campaign to restore Vitaphone films.\n\n212-727-8110, filmforum.org\n\nDELANYMANIA at the Metrograph (May 17-19). The science fiction author Samuel R. Delany wrote the notes for this series, which consists of movies he saw early in life and considers to be influences. He was taken with the anti-ostracism moral of Joseph Losey’s “The Boy With Green Hair” (on Saturday and Sunday), for instance, because it spoke to the otherness he felt growing up gay. He remembers that “The Seventh Seal” (on Saturday) marked the end of his “paired moviegoing” with his father, “or any further appreciation on his part of why I liked movies or why I would want to occasionally make them,” Delany said in press materials. Also showing: a program of his own films (on Saturday), Jean Cocteau’s “Orpheus” (on Sunday) and Orson Welles’s “Touch of Evil” (on Sunday).\n\n212-660-0312, metrograph.com"
