Despite his knowledge, once he's there, MacWhite sees only a dichotomy between the U.S. and Communism. He can't accept that anti-American sentiment might be a longing for self-determination and nationalism. So, he breaks from his friend Deong, a local opposition leader, ignores a foreman's advice about slowing the building of a road, and tries to muscle ahead. What price must the country and his friends pay for him to get some sense?",

        "text": "“If you want to prove to him how right you are, you’re welcome to try.”\n\nEugene Burdick and William Lederer’s The Ugly American (1958) is one of those rare novels that directly — and significantly — influenced real-world politics. Its contention that the United States was on the verge of losing the Cold War due to its diplomats’ arrogance and unwillingness to understand Third-World countries on those countries’ own terms had a massive impact on politicians of the era. John F. Kennedy’s promise in his inaugural address that his approach to foreign policy would be to “pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of…\n\nI struggled over my rating here. I found this film maddening in that it at first seems to challenge and expose the real motives of American foreign policy during the Cold War. But then it winds up reinforcing a message about the evils of global Communism near the end.\n\nSet in a fictional Southeast Asian country Sarkhan, which is clearly a stand-in for Vietnam, Marlon Brando plays MacWhite, the new Ambassador. The country is riven with conflict, with the royal government allied with the US who sees it as a bulwark against encroaching Communism and a growing internal rebellion against reliance of US money and goals. A lot of the conflict centers on a highway the US is constructing called…\n\nBrando sweats! Marlon has put as much attention to the droplets on his brow and the damp stains on his shirts as to his acting in this Saigon-in-all-but-name political drama. Actually, mentioning those whiffs of humidity is unfair to his performance which has flashes of his habitual intensity. The problem is him acting opposite performers who don’t approach his talent. It’s like Gulliver among the Lilliputians.\n\nAll the way through, I was unsure if The Ugly American was going to defend or condemn Vietnam-style intervention. Brando’s Ambassador character certainly spouts some ugly ideology but the film seems critical of his once friend, now opponent, whom he brands a Communist. There is one long dialogue scene between the two which could have…\n\n\"Pretty soon, this country, Sarkhan, is going to end up just the way Cuba did.\"\n\n\"Cuba? Cuba is what you've made it.\"\n\nTHE UGLY AMERICAN is a film I’ve always felt is criminally underrated, to the point that I think it should have at least received a Best Picture nomination for 1963. It’s a very in-depth (for its time) look at the failures of US diplomacy.\n\nThe film is based on a 1958 novel that caused a lot of political scandal when published; in fact, the Peace Corps was established by the Kennedy administration partly as a result of the book. Though, from what I’ve read, the film is a very loose adaptation.\n\nHarrison MacWhite (Marlon Brando) is made the…\n\nThe ugliness of being so underrated ...\n\nLike other cinematic oddities as \"A Face in the Crowd\" or \"Johnny Guitar\", \"The Ugly American\" invites for several questionings. Why didn't the film get much more recognition? Why did it fail to reach the same status as a lesser movie like \"The Sound of Music\"? Why even those who pretend to be movie fans tend to overlook it or didn't even hear about the title? Is it because it's a Marlon Brando picture that is not from the 50's or the 70's? Is it the title? The unknown director: who ever heard of George Englund anyway? The exotic setting that makes it look like another mindless escapist movie?\n\nIn fact, the only…"
