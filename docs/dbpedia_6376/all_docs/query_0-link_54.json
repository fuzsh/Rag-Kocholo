        "text": "The heat of summer dwindles and expires, a burning wick extinguished by the howl of the autumn wind. Freed of the chatter of bright birds and the buzzing of the honey gatherers, the aged land itself murmurs to us in the click and clack of the bare tree branches above and the crunch of dead leaves beneath our feet, whispering the portents of All Hallow’s Eve. Yep, it’s my favorite time of the year again, and my favorite feature on this blog, where I make my way through as many first time horror movie watches as I can get my eyeballs on before my annual end of season Halloween III viewing Halloween night.\n\nSo let’s jump in, shall we?\n\n#1 – Older Gods – A man investigating the disappearance of his friend stumbles upon an ancient cult. I allowed myself to be duped into watching another ‘Lovecraftian’ movie that’s not Lovecraftian at all. This has some neat visuals scattered here and there but it’s too talky with trite dialogue and doesn’t capture the cosmic dread I was hoping for. All the more unenjoyable because I just realized I could have watched it for free on Tubi.\n\n#2 Terrifier 2 – Art The Clown (David Howard Thorn) inexplicably returns to wreak more high quality practical FX havoc on beautiful young women, this time setting his sights on a high school girl (the very lovely Lauren LaVera, playing much younger in true horror fashion) her mom (Sarah Voight), and Art-obsessed younger brother (Elliott Fullam), who have recently lost their father, a man plagued by strange visions of the killer clown. The first movie was simply relentless if creative brutality. This one veers into decidedly supernatural territory, very effectively capturing the bizarre, dream-like feel of a certain kind of 80’s slasher, something like Nightmare On Elm Street and Phantasm. There is a plucky heroine in Heavy Metal armor wielding a magic sword dancing with animated Berry Gordy Last Dragon energy, an impish sidekick for Art (Amelie McLain) that only some people can see, a musical fantasy sequence, and not much in the way of explanation as to how all this bizarre and incongruous stuff ties together….and I loved it. Don’t miss the revolting mid-end-credit sequence with a Chris Jericho cameo.\n\n#3 Saw X – Moralizing psychopath John Kramer (Tobin Bell) flies down to a yellow tinted Mexico to avail himself of an experimental treatment to remove his terminal brain tumor, gets conned, and forces the grifters to participate in a series of elaborate and bloody ‘tests of character’ in this prequel entry into the long running series. The sadistic mechanisms and credibility stretching plot twists are in full effect as ever. It takes a certain mentality to see the fun in these movies, which are basically violent cathartic fantasies, and my daughter and her friend and I are definitely of that mindset, but I was sort of miffed at the survival of the movies most heinous villain. Some nice cameos by series regulars, but I wondered what the point of this sidetrack was in the context of the greater series.\n\n#4 House of Darkness – Hap (Justin Long, playing yet another ‘hap’-less chauvinistic douchebag duped into visiting a big scary house – he’s almost a genre unto himself now) drives pretty Mina (Kate Bosworth) home from a bar to her remote, palatial estate, and takes about an hour and a half holding out hope that something awesome is going to happen. It’s very clear early on from the way she draws out and calls into question his numerous character defects that Mina has other, more sinister plans for him. Could not have been more by-the-numbers if it had come with a paint set.\n\n#5 Cat People (1942) Beautifully shot but not-so-wonderfully acted melodrama about a Serbian girl, Irena (Simone Simon) who believes she is descended from a race of accursed cat people, and will turn into a rampaging black panther if her passions are aroused. Nevertheless, she marries shortsighted engineer Oliver Reed (no, not that one – Kent Smith). When she refuses to consummate their marriage cad Oliver sets his sights on his more willing co-worker Alice (Jane Randolph) and enlists psychiatrist Dr. Judd (Tom Conway, sounding exactly like the city wolf from the Texas Avery Wolf ‘N Red cartoons) to have her declared insane so he can annul the marriage (nice guy). But Irena can’t be put on the shelf that easily. Interesting enough premise is bogged down by stiff acting and dialogue.\n\n#6 – The Pope’s Exorcist – When a boy (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) is possessed by an evil spirit inhabiting a cursed monastery his mother (Alex Essoe) has been engaged in restoring, the Pope (Franco ‘Django’ Nero) assigns the Vatican’s greatest exorcist, Father Amorth (Russell Crowe) and a local priest (Daniel Zovatto) to the case. As a horror fan, The Exorcist is the scariest movie I’ve ever seen. As a Catholic who, growing up, wanted to be a priest, I’m a sucker for priests as occult detectives. This is not a great movie, not scary, and pretty by the numbers as exorcism movies go, with a foul mouthed little kid throwing people across the room and scrawling disheartening messages on his own flesh mysteriously. Every trope gets rehashed. And yet, it has little flashes of pulpy goodness that remind me of why I like the Hellboy and St. George comics, and love Van Helsing as a character. Spitting up a cardinal, a monk’s esoteric map with 199 evil sites on earth where ‘God is not welcome,’ A king of Hell trying to infiltrate the church, dungeons of condemned rebel angels, heroic self-sacrificing friars, and an arm of the Vatican devoted to esoteric battle….yeah, that hit the right notes for me. Plus, the characters are extremely likeable. Crowe makes a quirky, humble, and engaging Amorth, his young assistant is flawed and relatable, and I even enjoy the family dynamic. I feel like I shouldn’t like this, but I do, and would be pleased to see more occult Amorth adventures.\n\n#7 – The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It – The Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) battle for the soul of young man (Ruairi O’Connor) literally caught red-handed murdering a co-worker, in order to convince a court that he was acting under demonic influence. The concept was so far out I was with it right from the start. I was very skeptical of the Conjure-verse from the outset but the weirder they get the more I enjoy them. Eugenie Bondurant is really creepy as a nefarious enemy occultist. Some imaginative sequences involving a waterbed, an animated autopsy subject, and some excruciating contortions (sounds sexier than it is, I realize) make for memorable watching.\n\n#8 – A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge – Vengeful child molesting dream killer Freddy (Robert Englund) attempts to inhabit sexually confused Jesse (Mark Patton) so that he can affect the real world. I’ve seen Nightmare 1, parts of 3, New Nightmare, and Freddy vs. Jason, so I’m making my way through the series for the first time. I had read somewhere that this movie had a possible gay subtext, but boy, if this is subtext, I can’t imagine what a blatantly gay Freddy movie would look like. LOTS of male on male gazing and overcompensation/posturing, but nary a bare female breast in sight. Sweaty Jesse’s attraction to girl next door Lisa (Kim Myers) feels pretty obligatory when he’s running laps and obediently hitting the showers for his intense, gum chewing, S&M bar haunting gym teacher (played with brooding intensity by Marshall Bell) in his dreams (Possibly?) and metaphorically running to the firm arms of his hunky best bud Grady (Robert Rusler) every chance he gets. The horror feels very personal and identity based, though there are some neat, if surpassingly weird FX (exploding canaries/hot dogs, Freddy memorably bursting out of a character’s skin). The whole thing has a feverish, appropriatel#9y dreamlike quality. I think it was shots of Freddy leaping from the pool to terrorize teenagers in an early TV ad that made me steer well clear of this series as a kid. I’m not the biggest Freddy fan because I can’t get past that he’s a child molester and I hated his wise cracking (later?) incarnations, but this was a very interesting flick.\n\n#9 Let’s Scare Jessica To Death\n\nRecently institutionalized Jessica (Zohra Lampert), her husband Duncan (Barton Heyman) and their hippie friend Woody (Kevin O’Connor) arrive to take possession of a newly acquired country house and are surprised to find a mysterious, attractive drifter, Emily (Mariclare Costello) already squatting there. Sensing that her friend is attracted to the drifter, she and her husband invite her to stay, but Emily is not content with Woody’s affections and her appetites prove voracious. Lampert effectively portrays a fragile psyche who doubts her perceptions of the increasingly strange occurrences around her until it’s too late. The whole thing has a very anxious, paranoid, delusional air, and I was doubting what was going on myself….and am still not 100% positive what happened at the end happened. Put me on edge. Very well done.\n\n#10 A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 The Dream Master – Dreamkiller Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund) gets revenge on the three ‘dream warriors’ from the last entry and then sets his sights on their friend circle, including Alice (Lisa Wilcox). A bit of a step down for me from the superior Dream Warriors, beginning with the recasting of Patricia Arquette. My daughter and I were kinda let down every time Kruger killed one of our beloved characters (at one point I turned to her and ordered her to stop saying she liked so and so). Good FX work, but I don’t know….something is missing I can’t put my finger on. MC Lyte raps on the Sinead O’Connor cut. Even Freddy raps over the end credits with the Fat Boys (I think).\n\n#11 – Significant Other – Ruth and Harry (Maika Monroe and Jake Lacy) take a hike through the Pacific Northwest. After Harry’s marriage proposal to Ruth goes over like a lead balloon, she wanders into a cave and encounters something that significantly changes the dynamics of their relationship. Tense, twisty beginning kept me guessing and really did surprise me, but once the box was opened, it didn’t have much to do or say. Lacy’s performance sorta wears thin.\n\n#12 – A Nightmare On Elm Street 5 The Dream Child – Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) gets his backstory filled out when he orchestrates his return through a victim’s unborn child. We learn about Freddy’s crazy conception (The Son of A Hundred Maniacs!) and get some pretty interesting kills (a guy merging with his motorcycle and a young woman with body dysmorphia dying of force feeding) but the FX are the biggest draw.\n\n#13 – Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare – Bonkers entry begins with an Escape From New York-like crawl stating that Freddy (Robert Englund) has killed every teenager in Springwood except one (Shon Greenblatt), who makes his way to a teen shelter where the dream killer’s long lost offspring is waiting to destroy him once and for all. A dream-logic plot involves an appealing cast of youngsters (Breckin Meyer, Ricky Dean Logan, and Lezlie Dean) following their impromptu guardian (Lisa Zane) through various illusions, plummeting houses, an apocalyptic Springwood, and Freddy’s tragic childhood, with cameo appearances by Johnny Depp, Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, and Alice Cooper along the way. I guess it’s not well regarded. Typically, I enjoyed it. I kept waiting for them to work in the Curtis Mayfield song. Missed opportunity.\n\n#14 – Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III – Michelle (Kate Hodge) and her boyfriend (William Butler) drive her father’s car from California through Texas and stop at a last-chance gas station, where they inevitably run into a succession of ever increasingly weird succession of Texas maniacs, apparently the extended family of Leatherface (R.A. Mihailoff/Kane Hodder). This had a pretty promising setup with Viggo Mortenson, Joe Unger, and Tom Everett turning in great, quirky performances, and even Ken Foree of Dawn of The Dead showing up, but it kinda devolved into a heavy metal neon terror clown haunted house ride with no truly memorable or affecting scares.\n\n#15 – When Evil Lurks – When Pedro (Ezequiel Rodriguez) discovers a bloated, diseased man being hidden by his mother in a rural shack, he knows a demon is about to be birthed and sets out to scour the countryside of the impending evil and protect his two sons. This has some truly horrific and mindbendingly gory FX work, but one of the most generic English titles ever. Seriously I couldn’t tell anybody about this movie because I could never get the title right. Anyway, lots of gotcha moments and intriguing word building (love that a demon gets befuddled and stuck in the labyrinth of an autistic child’s mind), but I dunno….something didn’t quite feel cohesive to me. Like there wasn’t a unifying coherence to the rules. Worth a watch though.\n\n#16 – The Fall of The House of Usher – Generationally rich family of influencers are miserable to each other. I look forward to Mike Flanagan’s horror miniseries on Netflix every Halloween, but this and The Midnight Club didn’t land with me at all. I barely made it through the first episode of both of them. I just didn’t care about any of the characters or proceedings, and if I had to hear one more rich a-hole lecture on how Ushers changed the world….well, it turns out I didn’t. DNF.\n\n#16 – Nanny – A Senegalese woman (Anna Diop) toils thanklessly as a nanny for a wealthy New York couple (Michele Monaghan and Morgan Spector) in the hopes of bringing her son over from Senegal in time for his birthday. Horror as metaphor with a telegraphed punch you might not see coming if you’ve never read an EC horror comic or seen an episode of the Twilight Zone. Well made, well acted, but cultural message aside, just nothing noteworthy.\n\n#17 Five Nights At Freddy’s – Mike Schmidt (Zathura’s Josh Hutcherson) takes a job as a nightwatchman at an old Showbiz-style pizza place to help support his little sister (Piper Rubio) and learns the horrific secret of the old animatronics characters still there collecting dust. I admit I took a long blink during a sizable chunk of this in the theater and I wound up with a lot of questions, some of which my kids assured me were answered in the extensive lore of the game this is based on, but others of a logical nature that left me dissatisfied (when did Mike’s parents have time to have a daughter and if they were Amidala-levels of sad at the loss of his little brother, why have a girl at all? Why was this place left standing at all given its history?). A lot of Youtuber cameos I guess. It honestly wasn’t bad and I’d like to give it another shot. A nice gateway horror movie for kids.\n\nI have to apologize to readers of this blog. I had a lot of earth shaking real life events this past October that prevented me from sitting on my butt and watching all the movies I hoped to watch. I didn’t even get my requisite viewing of Halloween 3 in. Next year I will make up the difference, God willing.\n\nMy top watches of these? Nothing really blew my top off honestly. I guess Terrifer 2, Pope’s Exorcist, and Let’s Scare Jessica To Death"
