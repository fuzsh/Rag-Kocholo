        "text": "THEY have stretched their imaginations a great deal further than they have stretched their intellects in making \"The World, the Flesh and the Devil,\" which came to the Capitol yesterday.In this Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer picture, made in black-and-white CinemaScope and directed by Ranald MacDougall, the initial assumption is that most of the people in the world have been destroyed—apparently disintegrated—by some sort of radioactive salt. There are only three evident survivors, two men and a beautiful girl, who eventually find themselves together and isolated in a completely deserted and dehumanized New York.Up to this point, the drama is graphic and interesting, presenting a science-fiction idea in good, vivid cinematic style. The arrival of the first man in the city to find the George Washington Bridge clogged with hundreds of empty and silent automobiles, the barren streets flecked with telltale litter, the buildings and apartment houses stark and still, stabs the imagination and gives the viewer the creeps. Mr. MacDougall has portrayed this awesome phenomenon with pictorial force and clarity.When he has Harry Belafonte as his lonely, intruding man shout his name and the fact that he is living from the bottom of the canyon of Wall Street, with his voice flung black in dying echoes, it is audio-visual imagery of the best. And when he has him meet up with Inger Stevens, a gaunt survivor, in an empty uptown street and puts the two to isolated, makeshift living in the great, dead city, it is fetching to perceive.All of this part of the picture has been done dramatically, with the shots of New York, the actual city, filmed in the dawn light, particularly superb. (These were made in the early hours of mornings, with the streets obligingly cleared by the invisible police.)But the fancy begins to crumble and the weird spell begins to break when the screen play of Ferdinand Reyher calls for the arrival of another man. For with this chap, who was apparently in a small boat out at sea when the Great Destruction occurred, is introduced a disappointingly unimaginative and, indeed, unreasonable conflict over the problem of race.Because the first man is a Negro (and, incidentally, steadfastly persists in refusing to dwell together with the white woman when they are alone, despite her evident wish), the arrival of the second man—a white man—played by Mel Ferrer, suddenly presents the banal question of who shall have the girl. Social distinctions and mating are considered in the most conventional terms, and a potentially fascinating contemplation of a unique sociological change is discarded in favor of a cliché: two men and a girl on a desert isle.To be sure, Mr. Reyher and Mr. MacDougall have attempted to suggest an ideal by having the three walk hand in hand down Wall Street at the end, after the men have had a fight. But this is such an obvious contrivance and so cozily theatrical that you wouldn't be surprised to see the windows of the buildings suddenly crowded with reintegrated people, cheering happily and flinging ticker tape.The evidence is that a good idea, good direction and good performances—at least by Mr. Belafonte and Miss Stevens, to a lesser degree—have been sacrificed here to the Hollywood caution of treating the question of race with continuing evasion of more delicate issues and in polite, beaming generalities.\n\nThe CastTHE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL, screen play by Ferdinand Reyher; suggested by a story by Mathew Phipps Shiel; directed by Ranald MacDougall; produced by George Englund; a Sol C.
