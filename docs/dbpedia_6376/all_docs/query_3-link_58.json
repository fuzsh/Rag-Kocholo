        "text": "The Ugly American is a 1963 film based on the novel of the same name and starred Marlon Brando as Ambassador Harrison Carter MacWhite. The Ugly American received mixed reviews and was completely overwhelmed by a number of better films that year. The film won no Golden Globes and neither won nor was nominated for an Oscar. It did poorly at the box office, not being among the year's top 25 grossing films of 1963.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Stewart Stern, and the film was produced and directed by George Englund. The film was shot mainly in Hollywood, with Thailand serving as the inspiration for the background sceneries. Parts of the film were also shot on locations in Bangkok, Thailand, including at Chulalongkorn University, one of the leading institutes of higher learning of the country. Upon release, the film garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 80% of critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.1/10. Kukrit Pramoj, a Thai politician and scholar, was hired as a cultural expert/advisor to the film and later played the role of Sarkhan's Prime Minister \"Kwen Sai\". Later on, in 1975, he, in fact, did become the 13th Prime Minister of Thailand. Probably because of this, the word \"Sarkhan\" has entered the Thai language as a nickname of Thailand itself, often with a slight self-deprecating or mocking tone."
