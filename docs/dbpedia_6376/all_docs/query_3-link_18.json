        "text": "Apparently, according to Robert Englund, there was supposed to be a scene that sort of explained what happened to him. I found this reference on the We Minored In Film site (scroll down to #7). According to the site, Robert Englund had this to say about what was originally in the script:\n\n“Robert Englund has a nightmare in his house in the Hollywood hills with my paint-stained apron over a chair I fall asleep and wake up in a giant web and a giant red and green Freddy spider comes down and cocoons me in an homage to The Fly. That was going to be why I disappear. I wake up from this nightmare in a sweat next to my beautiful wife, and the next thing you know in the film Wes tells Heather that Robert’s gone. They don’t know where he is.”\n\nAlso according to this site:\n\nThis scene was never filmed. They did, however, film but cut a scene in which Robert’s wife informs Heather over the phone they were heading out of town because Robert was kind of freaked out.\n\nAnother reference I found for this is #27 on this Lair of Horror page that describes the same basic dream from above:\n\nThere was a scene in the script that depicted a Freddy nightmare with him attacking Robert Englund. The nightmare had Robert stuck in a spider-like web and the new \"DEMON\" Freddy was a giant spider. This was dropped because it didn't fit with the film's overall tone.\n\nThis tidbit also appears on the IMDb trivia page for the movie.\n\nSo, there doesn't seem to be anything that definitively tells us what \"actually\" happened to Robert Englund (the character) after the phone conversation, but there were apparently at least some plans to tell us in the movie. I don't know... it's almost more fun to speculate in this instance.\n\nBTW, one other interesting thing I found on the Elm Street Wiki for this movie while looking all of this up was something that I had previously forgotten about regarding Robert's painting. In a conversation with Wes Craven, he tells her that:\n\nin the script he's been writing, pure evil can be temporarily defeated if its essence is effectively captured in a work of art that is able to allow evil to express itself.\n\n(emphasis mine) This may be the reason that Robert Englund was trying to paint Freddy's image in that scene.\n\nAnyway, I hope that helps.\n\nEDIT: After posting that last bit from the Elm Street Wiki about capturing the evil essence in a work of art, I decided to go look up the exact quote from the film. The quote isn't quite as vague as the Wiki would have you believe. Here's what's actually said (from WikiQuote):\n\nHeather Langenkamp: Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?\n\nWes Craven: It can be captured, sometimes.\n\nHeather Langenkamp: Captured? How?\n\nWes Craven: By storytellers, of all things. Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence. Then it's held prisoner for a while. In the story.\n\nHeather Langenkamp: Like the Genie in the bottle.\n\nJust wanted to clarify before someone beat me to the punch. However, while this conversation between Wes and Heather specifically identifies a story as the means of capturing the evil, I might argue that such a mystical means of entrapment could be extended to any form of art, including Robert Englund's painting... Just my thoughts, though."
