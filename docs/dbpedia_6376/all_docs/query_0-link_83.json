        "text": "It is already that time of the year again, Halloween is upon us and that means its time to talk about horror cinema. Last year I made a list of what I consider to be the best horror movies of all time, and while I have watched plenty of other films of the genre since then, both old and new, and the idea of making a revised version of the list was really tempting, I decided to go modern and focus on the great horror pieces that this new century has to offer. I’ve said before that mainstream american horror has found a sort of revival in the last few years, and beyond that there are plenty of gems from all over the world in the genre. The 21st century has a lot to offer with regards to the genre, and here we’re goinna discuss 10 of the very best. Of course there are still several worthy movies that I haven’t had the pleasure of watching yet, so probably some of the best may be missing. I’ve left out movies such as “Shaun of the Dead” (Edgar Wright, 2004) and “The Cabin in the Woods” (Drew Goddard, 2012) since I consider them to be more comedy than horror. I was also tempted to include Haneke’s “Funny Games” (2007), which is very well horror, but since I believe it not to be a remake but rather a companion piece to the 1997 one, even if its almost identical on a shot-for-shot level, I decided against it. Also I left out movies such as “Insidious” (2010) and “The Conjuring” (2013, both by James Wan), which are pretty decent horror movies but in all honesty I find them to be a tad overrated. And I would like a very special honorable mention to Takeshi Miike’s “Audition”, which premiered originally in Japan in 1999 but came to the west in 2000, placing the film on a limbo that makes it difficult to include in such a list.\n\nOther great movies that didn’t make the cut: “The Devil’s Backbone” (Guillermo del Toro, 2001), “The Others” (Alejandro Amenabar, 2001), “The Ring” (Gore Verbinsky, 2002), “The Descent” (Neil Marshall, 2005), “The Host” (Bong Joon-ho, 2006), “1408” (Mikael Hafström, 2007), “The Mist” (Frank Darabont, 2007), “The Orphanage” (Juan Antonio Bayona, 2007), “Drag Me to Hell” (Sam Raimi, 2009), “Sinister” (Scott Derickson, 2012), “Oculus” (Mike Flanagan, 2013), “It Follows” (David R. Mitchell, 2014), “The Invitation” (Karyn Kusama, 2015), “Hush” (Mike Flanagan, 2016), “It Comes at Night” (Terry Edward Schults, 2017), “Hereditary” (Ari Aster, 2018), “A Quiet Place” (John Krasinski, 2018).\n\nAnd now, these are the imo the 10 best horror films of the 21st century:\n\n10. Raw (Julia Doucournau, 2017)\n\nA movie that certainly indulges into its own appetite, this french-belgian co-production works as an allegorical coming-of-age tale about a girl’s sexual awakening as well as an effective horror about cannibalism. Justine, a lifelong vegetarian, begins her studies at veterinary school, where her older sister Alexia also studies. After basically being forced to eat meat for the first time in her life at a freshman ritual, she starts developing a craving for flesh that goes well beyond just the animals. there are some pretty gory and disturbing moments sprinkled throughout, but the film’s real strength lies in the twisted tenderness of the story. Garance Marillier delivers an excellent performance as the confused Justine, making her character one of the main reasons to watch this movie, and that’s saying a lot considering all the blood and sex to be found all over the place.\n\n9. REC (Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, 2007)\n\n“Paranormal Activity” might be the film that ushered a new era of found-footage films in the late 2000s, but the one that truly deserves the label of the scariest of the lot is 2007’s spanish film “REC”. A television reporter and her camera tag along with a group of firefighters as they get a call about an old woman being trapped in her apartment, but as they arrive the woman becomes aggresive and attacks them. Turns out she’s been infected by some sort of virus that soon starts turning everyone into zombies, and we as an audience are in for the ride through the subjective view of the camera man. I remember watching this as I was 14 or 15 and how it scared the hell out of me. The shaky cam effect really takes you into all the horror, achieving levels of claustrophobia and paranoia that wouldn’t have been possible if it’d been handled with a more traditional approach. As far as zombie-movies and found-footage-movies go, “REC” is definitely one of the best.\n\n8. Thirst (Park Chan-wook, 2009)\n\nBack in the late 2000s as vampires became popular in mainstream media again, korean auteur Park Chan-wook tried his hand at the (sub)genre and achieved great results. The movie follows a priest by the name of Sang-hyun, who volunteers for an experimental treatment against a disease knwon as the Emmanuel Virus. The experiment fails and he is infected fatally. However, he soon recovers in record time and becomes somewhat of a celebrity becase of this. As he’ll soon find out, he’s actually been turned into a vampire, what ultimately makes him lose what little remained of his faith and intensifies his feelings of existential loneliness, that is until he meets Tae-ju, the wife of a childhood friend of him with whom he quickly falls in love. The director’s mastery for brutal and bloody stories is in top form here, creating a modern vampire story that poses existential questions about faith and morality while always delivering on its blood-thirsty premise.\n\n7. Get Out (Jordan Peele, 2017)\n\nLast year hit-horror, filled with poignant social commentary, outstanding performances and a very well crafted screenplay, Peele’s directorial debut is without a doubt one for the ages. It follows Chris as he goes to his white girlfriend’s family house to meet her parents. Worried about what they’ll think when they find out he’s black, to his surprise they’re actually very thrilled upon his arrival. Nevertheless, as things start to unravel and all the farcical amability starts wearing thin, Chris realizes that his fears weren’t actually wrong at all and he would have probably been better off had he never accepted the invitation in the first place. Praised worldwide and flooded with awards, “Get Out” is one of those rare horror movies that’s commercially succesful, artistically accomplished and socially relevant.\n\n6. Goodnight Mommy (Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, 2014)\n\nAn austrian horror film that definitely doesn’t receive the credit it deserves, it tells the story of twin boys Elias and Lukas as their mother comes home after an operation. Her behaviour is somewhat weird and temperamental, what leads the boys to believe that she isn’t really their mother and is actually an impostor. The movie is tense and unsettling from start to finish, from the get go you simply know that there’s something twisted going on below the surface. It takes its time to establish and develop its quite simple story, and the payoff is huge when it all comes crashing down. It aptly delves into psychological territory and even has its moments of body/torture horror, never releasing the tension for the audience until the end when all the pieces fall together. It is a slow burner, but boy do I love it when a horror movie take sit time to set everything up and it pays off wickedly by the end.\n\n5. 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nThe movie that redefined the zombie genre for a generation, Danny Boyle’s vision of a post-apocalyptic Britain may look dated but its impact still lingers on. Cilian Murphy stars as Jim, who one day awakens from a coma in a hospital just to find everything in ruins. After exploring a little and being saved by two strangers he realizes that the world has been infected by a virus that turns people into zombies (who, for the first time in cinema history, are able to run!), thus signifying the fall of society. Boyle’s chosen aesthetic may be somewhat B-moviesh, but the struggles of its characters are extremely real and human and thematically the film is bolder than most zombie movies have ever been, before or since. Add to that great performances from its cast and the aforementioned small change to the zombie mythology that ultimately makes them way scarier and you have one horror movie for the ages.\n\n4. The Babadook (Jennifer Kent, 2014)\n\nJennifer Kent’s feature debut is one of the creepiest and tensest psychological horror films of the century. It tells the story of Amelia and her six year old son Samuel, who have recently experienced the loss of their husband and father, respectively. Samuel has a very active imagination and has a knack for getting into trouble, what is slowly withering down Amelia mentally. One night, when Samuel asks her to read him a bed time story, Amelia discovers a pop up children’s book that she hadn’t seen before. This book, however, is filled with disturbing content about a “spirit” called The Babadook. Soon the book starts taking a toll on both Amelia’s and Samuel’s psyche. The two main reasons why this movie is so great as it is are Jennifer Kent’s excellent, assured direction and Essie Davis tense and complex performance. Many viewers felt disappointed about this film because it was marketed as a traditional supernatural monster movie, instead what they got was a smart, extremely well crafted and unsettling psychological horror, that very well counts as one of the best this century has to offer.\n\n3. The Witch (Robert Eggers, 2015)\n\nAs far as period supernatural horror films go, Eggers’ 2015 “The VVitch” is without a doubt one of the best. It tells the story of a New England family as they’re cast out of their puritan community for a difference in believes and try to build a new life in a farm. When the youngest son Samuel disappears while being in the care of the eldest daughter Thomasin, the whole family spirals into a web of religious paranoia as they encounter forces that are seemingly out of this world. Another slow burner, one that keeps its focus on the characters (especially Thomasin) and masterfully plays with its horror elements, imbuing them with enough delicious ambiguity. Anna Taylor-Joy is a delight in the central role, as so are Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie as their parents. The film manages tension and suspense extremely well, all the time tackling real world issues that might be more relevant today than we’d wish to admit.\n\n2. Antichrist (Lars von Trier, 2009)\n\nLars von Trier might be one of the most gifted directors still working today, but he’s also one of the sickest. 2009’s “Antrichrist” tells the story of a husband and a wife, played by Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsborough, whose infant son dies when he falls out of a window while they were having sex. Afterwards she’s extremely depressed; he, being a psychiatrist, decides that the best treatment for his wife is for them both to retreat to the woods and deal with it together. Once they’re there, the behaviour of the woman starts to become ever more unsettling, culminating in one terrifyingly unforgettable final act. The film was controversial upon release because of its extreme graphic violence, though to say that a von Trier film is controversial is somewhat redundant. It is heavily astheticized and there’s some heavy use of symbolism that sometimes doesn’t quite fit, but still, “Antichrist” is without a doubt one of the most disturbing film experiences you’ll ever see.\n\n1. Let the Right One In (Tomas Alfredson, 2008)\n\nWithout a doubt one of my favourite vampire movies of all time, and most certainly the one that most aptly balances a tender coming-of-age story with chilling horror. Alfredson’s beautiful masterpiece tells the story of Oskar, a socially awkward 12 year old boy with an appetite for the macabre who lives in a Stockholm suburb with his mother. He faces constant bullying from classmates and has a tough time dealing with his parent’s divorce. It all changes when he meets Eli, a mysterious girl of apparently his same age that moved into their appartment complex. Shot with gorgeous cinematography of cold swedish landscapes, Alfredson knows where the heart of the story lies: not in the horror, though he does manage these elements outstandingly (unlike Matt Reeves in the american version, who does not only focus heavily on this but does so in an unsatisfying fashion), the true heart lies in the relationship between the two leads, two tormented souls that hate what they are but that ultimately find solace in each other. Beautifully bleak and extremely heart touching while at the same time managing to be very horrifying, “Let the Right One In” might very well be the very best horror movie the 21st century has to offer.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed it.

Until next time and happy Halloween!\n\nSo, now that we’re through with the top 20 films of last year (subject to revaluation in the coming weeks), its time to look towards this new year and find out, which are the most promising films coming out. Sure, there plenty alluring blockbusters on the horizon, Marvel’s Infinity War comes to mind, and its predecessor Black Panther; there’s also Solo: A Star Wars Story, Han Solo’s solo adventure (excuse the lame pun); Tom Hardy will debut as Venom later in the year, Ryan Reynolds dresses up once again as the merc with a mouth in Deadpool 2, and Spielberg takes the nostalgia route with Ready Player One. Still, there are other productions, with less flare but maybe even greater promise. Here are some of the films I am looking forward to the most in this new year:\n\nAnnhilation (Alex Garland)\n\nComing up already in February, Alex Garland brings his follow up to 2015’s great sci fi thriller Ex Machina with this promising sci fi thriller starring Natalie Portman. The plot concerns a biologist (Portman) who enlists herself on a dangerous expedition to a zone where the laws of nature don’t apply as we’d expect; her husband (Oscar Isaac) was previously on such expedition and returned deeply affected. The premise sounds intriguing, reminiscent somewhat to Tarkovsky’s masterpiece Stalker, and basing ourselves only on his debut film, Garland is a talent to keep an eye on.\n\nThe Incredibles 2 (Brad Bird)\n\nSure, a Pixar film is always gonna be high profile, but still, a sequel to the great original was teased already since the ending of that one, and now we’re finally getting one, almost thirteen years later. Details of the plot are scarce, but we can safely expect a lot of superhero fun in eye-popping CGI. And given that it takes place in an animated realm, fans shouldn’t be too concerned for the ageing of the actors. My only real worry is that it seems that Pixar hasn’t figured out the sequel game quite yet, the Toy Story films being the exception. Still, I keep my hopes up for this one.\n\nSunset (László Nemes)\n\nSon of Saul director is back, this time with a period piece set in Budapest just before the outbreak of World War I. There isn’t much known about the film yet, the cast consisting of mainly hungarian actors, and yet this looks to be one of the most promising films this year. Nemes directed a homerun a couple of years ago with his debut, winning the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. He directs his attention now to an earlier time period, and the potential is enormous. This could be his White Ribbon (Haneke). Without knowing much about the plot, production or cast, based solely on the talent the director displayed on his previous film this picture gladly enters my list.\n\nHalloween (David Gordon Green)\n\nFor many, a new Halloween film might be a bad idea, but the next installment in the franchise promises to be a direct sequel to the 1978 original, ignoring all the flicks that followed. The intent of rewriting the franchise’s much maligned history is already good to begin with, but the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle return as Laurie and Michael Myers makes it all the better. Sadly, Carpenter won’t be directing, but he’ll definitely be involved in the project. The man tasked to fill his shoes is David Gordon Green, director of stoner comedy Pineapple Express and last year’s emotional drama starring Jake Gyllenhaal Stronger (which I haven’t seen, but I’ve heard only good things about it). Sure, this might be one of those cases in which a a good idea horribly backfires, but until October we can remain hopeful.\n\nThe House that Jack Built (Lars von Trier)\n\nIdiosyncratic auteur and eternal provocateur Lars von Trier is back in the scene after a four year hiatus after his latest Nymphomaniac. This time around he’ll tell the story of 12 years in the life of a serial killer who operated in the state of Washington during the 70s and 80s. Matt Dillon stars in the main role. Now, to see von Trier tackle such a broody and bleak premise is almost too exquisite to resist. The dane is known for his violent and sexualized content, but also for the heavily aesthetic and profound thematic material. There is no release date just yet, so my guess is that we have to wait until the later stages of the year to be able to enjoy this mentally deranged potential masterpiece.\n\nAnd that’s that, the five films I am looking forward to the most in this 2018. There are many others that I haven’t mentioned, and I’m sure everyone has their own. Still, the most likely scenario is that by the end of the year the very best motion pictures were those that weren’t even in the radar of most people, myself included. We’ll have to wait and see. Here’s to another great year of cinema!\n\n“The moral of the [Medusa] myth is, of course, that we do not, and cannot, see\n\nactual horrors because they paralyze us with blinding fear; and that we\n\nshall know what they look like only by watching images of them which\n\nreproduce their true appearance.”\n\n-Sigfried Kracauer, The Redemption of the Physical Reality”\n\nHorror is one of the most popular film genres worldwide. It is no surprise that every year hundreds of horror features are produced, both backed by big studios and independent projects, many enjoying great success critically and commercially, others failing to live up to the expectations or simply fading away in an overcrowded market. The reasons for this may vary, but there are some recognizable traits and cycles, not to mention the machinations of the human psyche, that can help us shed a light on the subject. Like I said on my last post, it’s almost Halloween and what better time of the year to go into this highly interesting genre.\n\nThe Psychology of Horror Movies\n\nFirst, we must take into account that what follows is by no means the deepest and most comprehensive text on the matter, it is rather an attempt to summarize this subject in an understandable fashion. There are many reasons to why we are attracted to the genre as much as there are films and filmgoers, but many scholars have tried to shed a light on this question. The quote above by German film theorist Sigfried Kracauer applies to almost any genre and any film (why then would be watch war movies or films about poverty?), but it is probably nowhere truer than in horror. We watch a movie with the knowledge that what we are seeing is fake, this way we can experience certain situations that can be traumatizing or life threatening. Psychologist Glenn D. Walters attributes our fascination with he genre, among other things, to Aristotle’s Catharsis theory: through the portrayal of dramatic events can a human being cleanse itself from negative emotions. It is still debatable whether or not that is true, many arguing that being exposed to violent content makes a person more violent. On the psychoanalytic perspective, our attraction to horror may be linked to Freud’s theory of the “Uncanny”: “reoccurring thoughts and feelings that have been repressed by the ego but which seem vaguely familiar to the individual”. However, the problem with any psychoanalytic reading is the limited or almost non-existent possibility of proving this empirically.\n\nFilm scholar Noël Carroll cites in his book “The Philosophy of Horror or Paradoxes of the Heart” three factors for the popularity of horror: interest, fascination and curiosity. It may seem like common sense, but he then delves into how these factors and the genre in general are linked with the (political) ideologies of the culture and time in which a specific film is produced. In truth, many of the themes and subjects of horror movies are intrinsically connected with contemporary social fears: the many alien invasion films like “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (1956) during the cold war era, the mutated monsters liked Godzilla (Godzilla, 1954) after the explosions of the nuclear bomb, the rise of the zombie subgenre in the early 21st century due to our fear of global epidemics, and many other examples. And while this may touch on our fears as a society, it does not fully explain why some subgenres appeal more to some than to others. Also, many of those subgenres don’t seem to be connected to these issues at all: slasher films and torture porn, for example, are more about the natural fear for our lives and fear of physical pain, instead of a more widespread societal angst.\n\nWhile the reasons may vary and there is still lots to be learned of the subject, the truth is that we’ll always be attracted to horror stories, and we’ve always have been. With so many different styles, currents and subgenres it is hard to pinpoint what exactly is horror cinema. Let’s now have a look at the evolution of the genre through the years.\n\nThe Evolution of the Genre\n\nHorror film finds its roots in gothic literature. Authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley (the works of all three being adapted several times to the screen to varying levels of success) pioneered and made popular the genre within fiction, and this success would translate years later into the screen. During the early days of cinema, the period known as the “Cinema of Attractions”, the Lumiere Brothers did a kind of proto-horror film, an experiment on stop motion and surreal images called Le Squelette Joyeaux (1897) (which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knSXkvluA8o). Georges Melies followed with Le Manoir du Diable (1896) (can also be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw8bzC33CGY), widely considered the very first horror movie of all time. But the epitome of the silent era in all matters horror was the German Expressionism, with their fascination for unnatural shapes and creepy (and often hand drawn) shadows. Some of the most known examples of this era are “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” (1919, Robert Wiene) and “Nosferatu” (1922, F. W. Murnau), two of the most influential and (truth be told) best films of all time.\n\nMany of the German expressionists moved to Hollywood the following years, for political and economic reasons too complex to go into in this short essay, and brought their talents and visions into the mix. The studio that rose as the father of horror in Hollywood was Universal, with their line of Universal Monsters taking the spotlight. Films like “Dracula” (1931), “Frankenstein” (1931), “The Mummy” (1932), “Bride of Frankenstein” (1935) and “The Wolfsman” (1941) proved to be financial successes for Universal, and soon other studios followed. During this time the Production Code was implemented. Headed by Will Hayes, the Production Code was a mean of censorship that pretended to promote morally acceptable filmmaking, that means, films that adjusted to the church’s morality. Unsurprisingly, the horror genre suffered, being relegated to B-status in Hollywood.\n\nIn the 1950s we saw a rise of interest in “creature features”, a mash-up between horror and science fiction that depicted end-of-the-world-scenarios like huge monsters destroying entire cities. As stated before, these films showcased the fears at the time of atomic weapons and the invasion of communism, most notably in the already mentioned Godzilla, produced by the country victim of the atomic bomb, and The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which featured an alien invasion by a civilization that seeks to assimilate every person and make them all equal.\n\nIt was in the 1960s that horror films started to get psychological. With removal of Production Code in 1964, filmmakers were free to explore darker and touchier subjects, depict sexuality and violence, and delve deep into the human psyche. Of course, the master of this was Alfred Hitchcock, his 1960 film “Psycho” being the very best example of such filmmaking (interestingly, it was released before the Production Code was removed). The 60s saw many societal changes, from the Cuba missile crisis to the counterculture movements and the sexual revolution, it is understandable that film in general would go through changes as well. The world was more openminded, film productions had less restrictions and the horror panorama changed. It is from this point on that we began to see so many different subgenres popping around: the zombie subgenre, which started in 1968 with George A. Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead”; the so called “occult horror”, to which films like “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968, Polanski), “The Exorcist” (1973, Friedkin) and “The Omen” (1976, Donner) belong; the slasher subgenre, which started with Tobe Hopper’s “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974); the “splatter” horror, which includes Sam Raimi’s “The Evil Dead” series (starting in 1981); etc.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 21st century we saw the rise of two very popular subgenres: found footage films, which depict the final moments of victims of supernatural (or not) entities “recorded by themselves” (examples include “The Blair Witch Project” (1999) and “Paranormal Activity” (2007)) and torture porn, films focusing on the gore and pain inducing imagery (movies such as “Saw” (2004) and “Hostel” (2005). While the quality of the horror features of this period is debatable, their influence is undeniable. And now we’ve arrived at the true reason why I decided to make this essay: the revival of the genre in mainstream cinema in the second decade of the 21st century.\n\nToday: a modern revival?\n\nThe first decade of the new century brought not only the two aforementioned subgenres, but also tons of unoriginal remake, unnecessary sequels and hundreds of copycats. And while I’m not saying that this period was all bad, there were still many good horror movies released in these years, especially in the foreign and independent film industry, the mainstream American horror market saw a deep in quality. That is ‘til recent years. A wave of strong, smartly written and often with an awareness for many of today’s issues has surged in the last decade. “The Cabin in the Woods” (2012) effectively mixes horror with self-referential humour and mashes many of the genre’s classic tropes together in a fun and exhilarating ride; “It Follows” (2014) tells a sort of allegorical fairy tale about the dangers of promiscuity and venereal diseases; “The Witch” (2015) tells the story of a family’s downfall because of religious paranoia; “Get Out” (2017) deals with racism and stereotypes in a so called “post-racial” society. There are many other examples, many of which I’ve unfortunately not yet seen, but the trend is showing. It is also worth mentioning that this year, 2017, has seen the release of many great horror films, both from the independent scene, like the above mentioned “Get Out” and “It Comes at Night”, and bigger studio productions, like the new adaptation of Stephen King’s “It”, even Aronofksy’s new arthouse project “mother!” arguably falling under the category. Does this mean that the genre is finally back on track? Or is it just a cycle and we’ll see in a couple of years how it suffers from low quality on all fronts again? It may be too early to tell, but what’s for sure is that the genre is all but dead.\n\nConclusion\n\nHorror is a very rich, versatile and ever-changing genre. It does have many issues, but it is still one of the most popular movie categories all around the world. From a production standpoint is very easy to see why it is so popular, being relatively inexpensive to shoot a scary movie and being almost a guarantee that it’ll attract audiences. The reasons to why it is so popular are many: be it a cathartic feeling, the resurface of unconscious thoughts and desires, the reflection of our fears as a society, or simply humanity’s voyeuristic nature, there is no way of telling for sure. The evolution of the genre permits us a glance into all these topics, regardless of the current or subgenre. In recent years we’ve seen a kind of artistic and intellectual renaissance on the mainstream horror scene, but it is still hard to predict where the genre is going. One thing is for sure: horror is one of the most interesting film genres to explore and analyse.\n\nHappy Halloween!\n\nSources and further reading material:\n\n“Theory of Film: The Redemption of the Physical Reality”, Sigfried Kracauer (first published in 1960)\n\n“Understanding the Popular Appeal of Horror Cinema: An Integrated-Interactive Model”, Glenn D.

That means it is the time of the year to watch some of the spookiest, creepiest and best made horror films. There are thousands to choose from and the internet is full of lists like this, but I decided to do my own. Please take into account that many films may be missing from this list due to the fact that I haven’t seen them. Still, it is always a good idea to go with the classics.\n\nFirst, some honorable mentions that couldn’t quite make the cut: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919, Wiene), Nosferatu (1922, Murnau), Vampyr (1932, Dreyer), Repulsion (1965, Polanski), Night of the Living Dead (1968), The Omen (1976, Donner), Friday the 13th (1980, Cunningham), Possession (1981, Zulawski), The Thing (1982, Carpenter), Hellraiser (1987, Barker), Scream (1996, Craven), The Sixth Sense (1999, Shymalan), The Blair Witch Project (1999, Myrick and Sanchez), Audition (2000, Miike), 28 Days Later (2002, Boyle), The Descent (2005, Marshall), REC (2007, Belaguéro, Plaza) Let the Right One In (2008, Alfredson).\n\n10. Halloween (1978, John Carpenter)\n\nThe appropiate title for the ocassion, this classic slasher film introduced the now iconic Michael Myers to anxious audiences and his presence is still felt today. Although not the first slasher, he is certainly one of the most influential. In this first installment of the franchise, homicidal maniac Michael Myers breaks out from the psychiatric hospital he’s been for the last fifteen of his life and starts hunting down his younger sister Laurie. Unlike its many unfortunate sequels, the original 1978 Halloween was chilling and disturbing. Carpenter is another favorite of the genre, his mastery shown on how he builds up suspense and turns on the terror. Nick Castle is completely menacing as Michael Myers, the killer with the mask who still lives on today in the minds of many.\n\n9. Jaws (1975, Steven Spielberg)\n\nWe go from menacing human killers to unstoppable forces of nature. The mother of all blockbusters, Spielberg’s Jaws is a film that made a complete generation be afraid of water. It is certainly one of the most important films in film history, given how it opened the gates to the phenomenon of wide release. Spielberg shows how good he is at building tension, the shark famously not seen for large portions of the movie, and still keeping the audiences glued to edge of their seats. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw all give great performances as the three men in search for the killer shark. Meticulously planned and expertly executed, Jaws is a horror film for the ages.\n\n8. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984, Wes Craven)\n\nThe second Wes Craven film on this list, the feature that made him a horror legend deserved naturally a spot as well. The story of a group of kids who are being hunted in their dreams by this creepy guy with a burnt face and razors on his gloves named Freddy (Robert Englund), this film is nothing short of a classic. Breaking new ground on the slasher landscape, a genre which was already on swing for the past two decades, Craven did something truly scary: he made us afraid of even going to sleep. Freddy Kruger is one of the most famous and recognizable horror villains of all time, his appearance and signature weapon of choice, plus the fact that he can travel to dreams, make him one of the most terrifying monsters in the genre. His theme song, creepily sung by children, will stay with you even as you go to sleep.\n\n7. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974, Tobe Hopper)\n\nThe original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was one freaky film. It wasn’t as violent as the films that came after it (which were certainly over the top and ludicrous), but Hopper’s original was a great example of how to make horror. Basically the telling of a road trip gone horribly wrong, this is a film about just how far human depravation and sadism can go. Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) is another famously recognizable horror villain, his mask made of human skin and his characteristic chainsaw make him one of the most chilling and propably cruelest slashers. Hopper orchestrates the film in a way that makes the audience feel unease and despair, even though not much violence is seen on screen (a lot is left to our imagination) and huge portions of the film are on day time. The director’s mastery make this probably the best slasher film of all time.\n\n6. Alien (1979, Ridley Scott)\n\nThe franchise is still going on today, but none of the following installments could match the mastery of cosmic horror at display in Ridley Scott’s original Alien. The sense of claustrophobia developed from being trapped in a space shuttle with nowhere to go with a ruthless killing machine is transferred to the audience, making us feel trapped right there with the crew. Scott is at his best with this lovecraftian science fiction-horror hybrid, smearing the film with symbolism and sexual imagery, deeping the film’s layers. Sigourney Weaver stars as Lt. Ripley, the badass female protagonist per excellence. And of course we have to mention H. R. Giger’s excellent, menacing design for the unstoppable Xenomorph, a beast whose animalistic instinct and predatory skills make it the ultimate antagonist. One of the few films to effectively explore the idea of cosmic terror, Scott’s masterpiece couldn’t possibly miss this list.\n\n5. The Exorcist (1973, William Friedkin)\n\nFor many the quintessential horror film of all time, this spooky tale of demonic posession scared for years generation after generation. Ellen Burstyn plays Chris MacNeil, a mother trying to find answers to why is her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) acting the way she is. First through modern medicine and science and then, when none of that works, she seeks the help of father Karras (Jason Miller), who is struggling with his faith, and father Merrin. With many iconic moments, a creepy atmosphere, a chilling soundtrack, strong performances from the cast all around, and a surprisingly insightful study about the place of religion in modern society, The Exorcist is a very well accomplished piece of horror filmmaking and filmmaking in general. It’s main problem is that it hasn’t aged so well, many of its scares resulting somewhat silly in an age of realistic CGI, but that doens’t stop it from being one of the best horror films of all time.\n\n4. Rosemary’s Baby (1968, Roman Polanski)\n\nPolanski specialized in his early career on subjective/psychological horror realism, and it was nowhere as refined as in Rosemary’s Baby. The story of a naive and submisive housewife (Mia Farrow) who hast recently moved to New York with her husband Guy (John Cassavetes), becomes impregnated and soon starts to believe that a cult of devil worshippers are after her baby. The film delves deep into social issues that are still relevant today, like patriarchal oppression of women, loss of control of one’s one body, the alienation of big cities and, of course, religion. Mia Farrow is excellent as the naive and powerless Rosemary, we as the audience can’t help but sympathize with her. Polanski’s direction is top notch and his screenplay, based on the novel by Ira Levin, creates a world disturbingly similar to our own.\n\n3. Silence of the Lambs (1991, Jonathan Demme)\n\nJonathan Demme’s psychological thriller based on the famous novel by Thomas Harris starring Anthony Hopkins as the iconic Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster as his life long counterbalance FBI agent Clarice Starling won the top five Oscars at the 64th Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and (adapted) screenplay), being only the third film in history to achieve that. Demme constructs a compelling and complex thrillride that explores so many themes and facets of human nature, all the while through a carefully laid out and thrilling mystery. The dynamic between the two leads carries the film, thanks to legendary performances by both Hopkins and Foster, but the genius of the film also lies in the detailed and subtle complexities of Demme’s execution and the strong script by Ted Tally. Not only one of the best psychological horror films, but one of the best films of all time.\n\n2. Psycho (1960, Alfred Hitchcock)\n\nOf course, the master had to make an appearance on this list. Psycho is one of Hichcock’s masterpieces, an example of the finest horror filmmaking in history. The film follows Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who after making a bad decision and then tries to go back ends up spending the night at the Overlook Hotel, run by young Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who lives with his mother Norma. Hitchcock surprised audiences with that twist at the middle of the film, something that wasn’t accostumed at the time, made them afraid of using the shower, and then took the audience once again for a ride with that crazy mindf*ck at the end. Norman Bates is probably one of the most intriguing and complex characters in film, Perkins delivering an impeccable performance. Commonly referred as the mother of all slashers, sadly inspiring a subgenre which films with a few notable exceptions would be lacking in quality, Psycho is much more: an unsettling exploration into the territory of the uncanny, a jewel of a film.\n\nCould have easily topped this list, if it weren’t for our number one pick…\n\n1. The Shining (1980, Stanley Kubrick)\n\nWhat else was it going to be? The master Kubrick himself taking on Stephen King’s novel, but instead of making it a direct adaptation, Kubrick made the story his own, resulting in not only a superior work of fiction, but also the best horror film of all time. Deeply layered, open to thousands of interpretations, filled with subtleties that hint at the profounder thematics, carefully written, greatly performed and expertly directed, not to mention quite disturbing. The more you look into the film the more sinister it gets, with so many undertones and possibilities that there’s even a film about theories of this move, Room 237. The Overlook Hotel is a character in and out of itself, the most insidious of antagonists that could turn a regular man into a monster. With so many unforgettable images and moments and a narrative that slowly unfolds but entraps the audience into its darkest corners, a mysterious setting, an atmosphere that evokes the unnatural, and a treasure of carefully planned details worth of analysis, Kubrick’s effort on horror proved to be what I consider the very best of all time."
