After Dwight's fire safety seminar goes awry, he must make amends to the stressed-out office. Michael tries a number of ways to get his employees to relax before discovering that he is the number one stressor at work. So that people won't feel afraid of him, he insists on a no-holds-barred roast of himself.\n\nPilot\n\nWhen well-meaning 23-year-old Jimmy Chance has a one-night stand with a wanted felon (guest star Bijou Phillips), he ends up being a dad to a bouncing baby girl. Inspired to do the right thing by his daughter, he has to convince his less-than-enthusiastic parents and great-grandmother (guest star Cloris Leachman) to help him raise her."
