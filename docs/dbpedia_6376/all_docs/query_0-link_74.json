        "text": "Category Archives: Horror\n\nStage fright – Dame Susan Hill on ‘The Woman in Black’\n\nThe spine-chilling stage thriller The Woman in Black arrives at Cardiff’s New Theatre next week [September 19-23] as part of its UK Tour. And I’m pleased to share this interview with the acclaimed author of the original novel, Dame Susan Hill.

But how can you improve on Powertool Cheerleaders vs the Boyband of the Screeching Dead? It’s the best movie title I’ve come across for a long time. And the film is every bit as entertaining. It’s the latest … Continue reading →\n\nIt’s raining sharks – the joyfully bonkers world of Sharknado\n\nWhat could be more terrifying than combining extreme weather and a shark attack? That’s why those wonderful people at The Asylum and SyFy Films gave us the Sharknado movies – a gloriously outrageous series of horror-sci-fi-comedies, directed by Anthony C. Ferrante. The six Sharknado films have become modern cult classics. From their outrageous premises to … Continue reading →\n\nCrucible of the Vampire – now hear the horror\n\nBritish independent film company Ghost Dog Films, who have already branched into graphic novels and video games, have now produced a first ebook and audiobook. It’s based on Ghost Dog’s 2019 film Crucible of the Vampire, which also spawned the excellent graphic novel, which I featured previously. The story – set in a spooky old … Continue reading →\n\nA century of horror films – 12 of the best\n\nWondering which horror films to feast on this Halloween (or any other time)? Pete Appleyard, a film editor, horror enthusiast, and lecturer at London’s MetFilm School, has put together his recommendations spanning the last 100 years. See if you agree. Nosferatu – 1922This early, unofficial adaptation of Dracula by F.W Murnau still holds every bit … Continue reading →\n\nShort films project finds success in competitions\n\nA series of short screenplays, known as The Annalium Project (featured in this blog earlier this year), has been finding success in international competitions. The project’s creator (my pal) Robert Lancey had been hoping to have started filming the first film ‘Sssss’ by now, but the continuing COVID-19 pandemic has kept that on hold until … Continue reading →\n\nDragon Knight – ‘gritty fantasy epic’ from a house of horror\n\nA new film about medieval knights, the supernatural, and a dragon was always going to interest me. When it comes from a studio specialising in horror, then it interests me even more. And this is the case with Dragon Knight. Scottish genre house Hex Studios are the people behind the project, having previously given us … Continue reading →\n\nInteracting with horror: ‘I Saw Black Clouds’\n\nThe idea of ‘interacting’ with a horror film isn’t new – famous examples include the ‘punishment poll’ in William Castle’s Mr Sardonicus (1961) and the ‘werewolf break’ in The Beast Must Die (1974). But these days, things are much, much more sophisticated, as the forthcoming British horror I Saw Black Clouds shows. This latest offering … Continue reading →\n\nOver the forest and into adventure – Annalium goes online\n\nAn intriguing series of short, dialogue-free screenplays, has now gone online. Annalium is the work of Cardiff-based writer (and my pal) Robert Lancey, who has created a website to showcase the screenplays and their potential to be realised on screen. Each opens with a flight over a forest, and then a descent through the treetops … Continue reading →"
