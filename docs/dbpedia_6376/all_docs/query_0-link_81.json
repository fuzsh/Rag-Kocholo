        "text": "The 1990s was the dawn of a new age. The advent of the internet/World Wide Web greatly simplified everyday life, including how we access information, communicate, and conduct business. All of a sudden, a few keystrokes could send a signal across the globe. Tasks that took minutes, hours, or days to perform became instantaneous. You’d think mankind would be in a better place now, but we’re not, it’s actually much worse.\n\nOur planet is dying, racial tensions are just as high as they were during the L.A. riots, Columbine is a weekly occurrence, and instead of ribbing Slick Willie for sexing an intern, conservative nutjobs are mounting literal insurrections because they honestly believe a billionaire celebrity who got where he is by fucking over the working class has their best interest in mind. Why hasn’t anything changed?… We walk around with the sum total of human knowledge at our fingertips in the form of smartphones and use them to look at memes, such as this, while the world burns around us:\n\nI’d fix these problems if I could, but I’m only one man. Our elected officials need to get off their asses and turn this sinking ship around before it’s too late. Hell, it might be already. There’s a nonzero chance that Congress provides confirmation of extraterrestrial life and AI will kill us all anyway, so what does it matter? Learn to stop worrying and love the bomb, as Stanley Kubrick would say. For the next fifteen minutes, let’s talk horror movies. Then, we can vigorously masturbate till the stars fall from Heaven.\n\nWhile sitcoms and cartoons still dominated the ratings back when boy bands were topping the music charts, there was also a shift toward realty-based programming, even if much of it remained scripted. MTV’s The Real World, Cops, tabloid talk shows, primetime game shows, and coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial were hugely popular too. Around the same time, professional wrestling broke “kayfabe”, horror movies developed consciousness, and Fox aired that special, Magic’s Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed, exposing how tricks and illusions are done. Audiences across the board embraced real-life drama and found new ways to view the familiar.\n\nLast time on the Devil’s DVD Bin, I compared practical movie effects to feats of prestidigitation and complained about how ubiquitous CGI is. Computer-generated imagery in horror has left me longing for the believability of older films from my cinematic comfort zone, that being the 70s thru the mid 90s. Another reason I prefer horror films from this era to what they’re producing today is because they’re funny, but not overly meta.\n\n“Meta” (Greek, after, beyond) is a common term these days used in various contexts. Typically, it refers to creative works or fields of study that analyze themselves. Meta forum posts, for example, address the user experience, instead of the topic at hand. Metafiction is self-reflective, ironic work, displaying an awareness of its artificiality and the conventions of its genre. Meta horror almost always has a smug sense of humor. In general, I’m not a fan of the style. I mean, would you rather watch a movie or listen to a commentary track full of puns? Plus, its batting average is dire.\n\nExcepting Troma’s output and super-low-budget stuff, horror movies released before Scream took themselves pretty seriously. Once they stopped, this likewise affected my ability to suspend disbelief.\n\nSide note: Does anyone else find it weird that we call factual books “nonfiction”, meaning “non fake?”, and nonfactual books “fiction”, meaning fake? Seems backward to me.\n\nWith how successful Scream 5 & 6 were (I accidentally read a spoiler about the former and now I refuse to watch it 😥🤧), younger fans might assume that Wes Craven’s 1996 call-n-kill was the first meta horror. It wasn’t, though, it certainly catapulted that concept into the mainstream. Here are some titles that beat it to the punch. Bear in mind, I’m no film historian, just some asshole with access to the internet.\n\nThe deeply unfunny star-studded sketch comedy movie Imps (short for Immoral Minority Picture Show, filmed 1983, released 2009), which I discovered on Tubi, features a skit lampooning the slasher subgenre. Linda Blair (The Exorcist) interacts with a narrator listing all the mistakes her character has made.\n\n“In ‘Don’t Go in the House Alone’, she went in the house alone.” the narrator says. “In ‘Don’t Go in the Basement’, she went in the basement. In ‘Don’t Answer the Door’, she answered the door… That’s right, the Don’t Girl is back, the dumbest movie heroine in history is walking through a dark house alone once again.”\n\n“Don’t this and don’t that. Don’t you ever have anything positive to say?” Blair complains. Then teasingly, “In ‘Don’t You Ever Have Anything Positive to Say?’, he never had anything positive to say.” She tries to fake out the narrator by opening the door next to the door he warns her about, revealing an elderly hockey-masked killer named Chasin. Text appears on the screen advertising Friday the 13th Part 967. The funny thing is, there were only three of those at the time.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Blair told a TMZ reporter that Imps was the greatest (professional?) mistake of her life. Clicking the citation leads to an unrelated article about one of Blair’s rescue dogs attacking a pig.\n\nJason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI meets us halfway between the out-and-out mockery of Imps and Sean Cunningham’s original vision — “The most terrifying film ever made!” It was Paramount’s attept to course correct the series and continue making lots of $$$. Writer/director Tom McLoughlin was given the green light to inject it with humor, so long as Jason was not the butt of his jokes. That’s debatable. Jason’s resurrection is a blatant homage to Frankenstein while the opening credits spoof James Bond. Shortly after, a cemetery groundskeeper says right to the camera “Some folks have a strange idea of entertainment.” playfully casting judgment upon us. When Jason blocks a car from advancing down a backroad, McLoughlin’s wife comments “I’ve seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.” There are quite a few more winks and nudges for eagle-eyed viewers.\n\nReturn to Horror High (confusingly, a standalone film unrelated to 1973’s Horror High), concerns a film crew shooting a cheap horror film in a school where a series of unsolved murders occurred. Predictably, the killer returns and the murders resume. There are flashbacks to the first set of murders, staged murders, actual murders, and nightmares held together by silly wraparound segments of two cops investigating the crime scene that culminate in several nonsensical twists. This nonlinear approach makes it nearly impossible to keep track of what’s “real”. I couldn’t tell you what happens.\n\nAt one point, an actress who plays multiple roles objects to showing her breasts.\n\n“We gotta see some flesh!” the sleazeball producer insists.\n\n“Why are women always the ones to be exploited?” the actress demands. “What is it with you guys?”\n\n“Hey, I’m having a great time!” her costar interjects.\n\n“Oh, really? Well, would you care to walk around in the scene with your shlong hanging out? Only in your case, darling, it would be a shlort.”\n\n“It’s a movie.” the director reasons.\n\n“Bullshit. Do you know what happens to movies? People see them. It seeps into their minds. Everything we do plants a seed… [This shit] is degrading to women.”\n\n“It sells tickets!” the producer fires back.\n\n“Well, it shouldn’t!”\n\nLater, the writer laments how the filmmakers butchered his script and remarks “They always do sequels.” The end title theme contains the following lyrics:\n\nI love it when they walk down the hall when it’s late at night\n\nand the people start to disappear\n\nI love it when you can’t hear a sound, then suddenly\n\nscreams are all that you can hear\n\nI like scary movies\n\nThis overlooked chop-’em-up boasts an early performance by George Clooney, however, the standouts are Alex Rocco and Scott Jacoby (Dorothy’s son on The Golden Girls) as the producer and the director, respectively. Return to Horror High‘s alternate VHS/DVD artwork of that other skeletal cheerleader pumping her pompom is probably the best thing about it.\n\nThough it doesn’t overtly critique or poke fun at the genre, another title worth mentioning is Lamberto Bava’s Italian gorefest Demons. In that one, a woman is handed two passes by a masked stranger (Michele Soavi) to a special screening at the mysterious Metropol theatre. “You don’t think it’s gonna be a horror movie, do you?” the woman’s friend asks. “You know I just hate them.” Later, when shit hits the fan, that friend concludes: “The movie is to blame for all of this!”\n\nA third woman cuts herself on a mask in the lobby identical to the mask in the movie, transforming her into a slime-drooling ghoul. Her first victim rips through the screen, infecting more patrons, compelling them to commit their own acts of violence. I interpret this symbolism as a giant middle finger to parent groups and their tired criticism that violent art has a negative influence on kids. The movie within the movie even starts with a slight rewording of a Goya print title — “The sleep of reason gives birth to monsters.” — suggesting it’s superstition, repression, and ignorance that begets violence, not media.\n\nDemons is Evil Dead with a sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll attitude — in other words, an over-the-top, gross-out zombie movie masquerading as a possession movie, in which a recording unleashes the forces of Hell upon a confined setting.\n\nHighlights are the bountiful, gooey effects, hard rock soundtrack, and funky synth/drum machine score by Claudio Simonetti, a member of Goblin, whose opening theme excerpts Edvard Grieg’s “In the Hall of the Mountain King”. A favorite part is when four punks ride around snorting coke from a Coke can as Billy Idol’s “White Wedding” plays. The driver is a copy of a copy of Sylvester Stallone. The other three spill Stallone’s stash, invoking his wrath. A guy in back who’s supposed to be tough but comes off as gay collects powder from a girl’s nipple using a switchblade. Once he sees that it’s turning her on, he slashes her breast! This scene has nothing to do with the story, which makes no sense at it is, but I love it! The star of the show, though, our unquestioned lord and master, is Bobby Rhodes as Tony the pimp, an absolute badass wearing a white suit, handlebar mustache, and sideburns. His lines include “that’ll teach you to touch things”, “shut up, you stupid bitch”, and my personal favorite, “you ain’t worth shit”. When Tony takes charge, you listen or else!\n\nWes Craven’s New Nightmare (1994) pushes the censorship issue, examining why we watch movies like Demons, what function they serve, and how they affect their creators, while subtly jabbing the Elm Street sequels. It tells us straight away that all the previous entries are movies and Freddy Krueger is a character played by Robert Englund. Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, writer/director Wes Craven, and producer Bob Shaye also appear as themselves. History is fudged a bit so that Langenkamp is the star of the series and a bigtime celebrity, when in fact she was tied with Saxon, Ken Sagoes, Rodney Eastman, Lisa Wilcox, and Danny Hassel for most showings at two.\n\nThe opening scene is reframed as a movie shoot is reframed as a nightmare, disrupting our sense of reality. The premise is that the immensely popular Elm Street series captured an ancient evil — violence, misery, death, essentially — by giving the public a healthy outlet by which to confront it. This entity looks like Freddy, talks like Freddy, and acts like Freddy, but darker, only because that’s how we perceive it. New Line Cinema’s decision to kill Freddy off at the end of Freddy’s Dead released the evil, allowing it to enter the lives of the stars. Foreboding events such as earthquakes, nightmares, sinister phone calls, and psychotic episodes signal its imminence. Later, we learn that Craven is writing a script from his dreams and it all comes true, down to the letter.\n\n“Every so often, [an author] imagines a story good enough to… catch its essence, and then for a while it’s held prisoner in the story.” Craven explains to Langenkamp in a key scene.\n\n“Like the genie in the bottle.” Langenkamp registers.\n\n“Exactly. But the problem comes when the story dies, and that can happen in a lot of ways. It can get too familiar to people, or somebody waters it down to make it an easier sell, or maybe it’s just so upsetting to society that it’s banned outright. However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free… Now that the films have ended, the genie is out of the bottle.”\n\nA chilling moment is when we see their conversation typed out on a computer screen. Craven expands on his message in a special feature contained on the Nightmare Series Encyclopedia bonus disc found in the “Nightmare on Elm Street Collection” boxset:\n\nI called up Bob Shaye and said I think I want to make a movie about the phenomenon of the movie and use that as the basis and jump outside the stories entirely, and also try to deal with this whole idea of censorship and whether horror films are good or bad and whether they cause people to do things, because that has been a growing and insistent question asked of me and I think everybody making horror films, is aren’t you afraid your films cause this or that?… Going all the way back to Greek mythology, there’s a lot of great literature that is about horror and that somehow a story about horror… exorcises it or gives it a form. It’s the same as Nancy dragging the hat out of her dream. It’s the beginning of being able to come to terms with it… If you were to prevent these stories, you would… be allowing something that is ineffable to sort of travel unimpeded through our consciousness because it would not have a name, it would not have a shape given to it, so that in any sense we could recognize it. So, that became the essence of it. Stopping the stories of Freddy has… allowed Freddy to cross over into real life.\n\nNew Nightmare is Craven in top form. It’s highly intelligent, relevant, entertaining, and yet it was only a warmup. Craven’s next stab at horror changed the game forever. Scream struck a chord with a whole generation, becoming a pop culture phenomenon. If New Nightmare was the alley-oop, Scream was the slam dunk. The shot in the arm horror needed. Or was it?\n\nI’m sure you’ve read how an oversaturation of slashers in the 1980s burned people out and as a result fewer horror films were produced the next decade. Not accounting for duplicates, omissions, or errors on my part, Wikipedia lists 491 horror movies released in the 90s, down 28% from 682 released in the 80s. Thanks partly to Scream, that number rebounded. In fact, it more than doubled! One reason Scream was so successful is because it had an A-list cast and was marketed as a mystery-thriller, thus attracting a wider, younger audience than it would have otherwise. Besides that, it’s just really good — suspenseful and funny in all the right spots.\n\nWe have Drew Barrymore getting sliced n’ diced in the opening sequence, Neve Campbell as plain Jane protagonist Sidney, Skeet Ulrich as her creepy, unnerving boyfriend, Matthew Lillard being funny for a change, Rose McGowan’s nipples as Sidney’s sarcastic best friend, Jamie Kennedy as Randy the video store clerk, and Henry Winkler as their stern but well-meaning principal. Former WCW World Heavyweight Champion David Arquette plays the role of a bumbling police officer while his soon-to-be-wife (now ex-wife) Courtney Cox is an unscrupulous TV reporter.\n\nThe plot is simple enough. A movie-obsessed psychopath stalks a group of high schoolers on the one-year anniversary of their city’s last murder. This killer’s penchant for dialing his victims is reminiscent of Black Sabbath, Black Christmas, When a Stranger Calls, Don’t Answer the Phone!, Prom Night, and others. Ironically, what made Scream original was how referential it was. Halloween, Craven’s own Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, The Exorcist, Frankenstein, The Howling, The Town That Dreaded Sundown, I Spit on Your Grave, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, and plenty more classic titles receive mentions. Familiarity with them will help, but isn’t really required.\n\nKevin Williamson’s script uses self-aware characters, clever misdirection, witty, quotable dialogue, and movie allusions galore to deconstruct the genre in a humorous way, like a wise-cracking killer dissecting a corpse. It holds every bloody piece up for us to laugh at, as if shouting “Look how stupid and fake this stuff is!”, allowing audiences to engage with the material on a deeper level. Recognizing all the clichés is a fun, interactive experience. I’d argue the main reason people enjoy Scream so much is because it makes them feel smart and empowered, like insiders on set being taught some arcane knowledge.\n\nMy favorite character, Randy, is cognizant of the fact that he and his friends are trapped in a typical slasher film plot, and uses his extensive knowledge to guide us around every turn. We all remember his speech from the party: “There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance, #1) You can never have sex. Sex equals death. #2) You can never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It’s a sin. It’s an extension of #1. And #3) Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say ‘I’ll be right back.’ Cos you won’t be back.”\n\nOf course, the movie ends up breaking these rules, giving some fans the impression that it places itself on a pedestal far above those lesser, derivative titles I listed. The movie can seem pretentious and haughty. Conversely, it calls attention to numerous hoary clichés, then follows them anyway. I compare that to making fun of a guy you’re anally fucking for being gay.\n\nRandy correctly predicts the killer, as well as the moment he comes back to life, for one final scare. Randy’s involuntary adherence to Rule #1 even ends up saving his life… till the sequel. Us nerdier fans identify with him and are still reeling from his unceremonious death in Part 2. Oh, spoilers.\n\nToward the end, Williamson whittles the censorship argument down to nine words: “Movies don’t create killers. Movies make killers more creative.”\n\nI might catch some flak for this, but here goes. I love Scream and its first couple sequels. It’s another one of those sacred defining moments from my childhood. Ghostface was the talk of the playground for months. I loved the movie then, I love the movie now, and it doesn’t make me any less of a true horror fan. Would I feel the same if I saw it today? I dunno, but I will say that I hated The Cabin in the Woods, which I was about twenty-two for. Whatever your opinion, whether you care to admit it or not, Scream did a lot to resuscitate horror. It also did unforeseen harm.\n\nOne downside is that there were suddenly tons of newbies who weren’t even fans of the genre hailing Scream as the greatest horror film of all time and a post-modern masterpiece. How did they know? This annoyed the old guard who dismissed Craven’s film as “teeny bopper trash” and “90210 with a body count”. Craven’s apparent newfound disdain for the genre that paid his bills rubbed these hardened fans the wrong way as well. In my opinion, the people calling for Craven’s head were being a bit melodramatic. I was only seven or eight years old when my mom rented Scream, so I hadn’t developed that mindset yet. It caught me at the perfect age.\n\nFurthermore, being the massive financial and critical success that it was, Scream inevitably spawned a series of copycats in the late 90s/early 2000s, just like its killers. The hip, teen slashers that followed were fun for a while, but led to a second bout of fatigue. For me, the novelty quickly wore off and these new films began feeling just as predictable and formulaic as the ones they were satirizing. They were too slick, with too many “beautiful” actors. Soon, every box in the New Release aisle had a hot, young cast lined up on the cover alongside a heavily edited “quote” reading some variation of “Smart… Scary… Sexy!” By the time Valentine rolled around, the fad had run its course.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThen came the spoofs. When you think about it, Scary Movie is a parody of a parody. There are levels to this shit. I’m picturing the scene in The Phantom Menace where the fish tailing the heroes’ submersible keep getting eaten by bigger fish, or the end of Men in Black where our universe is an alien’s marble.\n\nIt’s fitting that Scream was produced by Dimension Films because it truly was a “new dimension” in horror. It took so-called one-dimensional slashers and made them 2D. Scary Movie, also produced by Dimension, added a Z-axis. If and when Dimension parodies that, it will form a tesseract, like the structure in Cube 2: Hypercube, causing time and space to collapse.\n\nThe ripple effect of that wave of imitators is still being felt. For every Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (2006), Midight Movie (2008), or Smash Cut (2009) that hit shelves, we got five Terror at Blood Fart Lakes (2008) and Camp Death III in 2Ds (2018). These movies are no different than watching a wrestler rock their opponent to sleep, hypnotize them with dance, or use an invisible hand grenade. The first few times you see something like that, you might laugh, but then it makes you embarrassed. For me, once the filmmakers are in on the joke, it stops being funny. It’s really easy to make a bad movie on purpose, claiming you did so ironically. It’s quite a bit harder to entertain people the old fashioned way. Meta films are passé now. At worst, they’re cringey. At best, they’re pretentious. Scream is an outlier. It holds up really well.\n\nI know movies are fake. I know wrestling is fake. I know magic is fake. I don’t need to be reminded of it at every turn. Trick me, entertain me, just don’t insult me. I applaud you for making it this far. Thank you for your time. Do you enjoy meta horror? What are your favorite examples?\n\n∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗\n\nI’ve always felt that Ghostface’s look was influenced by the killer from Return to Horror High, who dons a black, hooded cloak and weepy, white mask. The shape of Ghostface’s mouth and title of his movie are also suspiciously similar to Edvard Munch’s famous expressionist painting. Oddly enough, there is nothing to these connections. During my research, I read that Ghostface’s mask, which is part of a Halloween costume referred to as “Father Death” in the film, was a real mask sold by Fun World called “The Peanut-Eyed Ghost”.\n\nUseless fact: “Scary Movie” was Scream‘s working title, whereas “Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th” (another spoof) is a modified version of Scary Movie‘s, “Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween.”"
