        "text": "February 17, 2020\n\nI have been a fan of Robert Englund since I was 13. He is one of my favorite actors who has done more than playing Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. He is a down to earth actor who loves his fans and has done a lot of films, voiceover work as a voice actor, and has directed some too. If you would like to find out how he got his start as an actor before Freddy and after, then I recommend you check out this autobiography. He also tells how he met his wife when he directed his first ever film 976-evil too and includes color photos of him as a kid and on.\n\nBe sure to check this book out at your local library and wherever books and eBooks are sold.\n\nMarch 16, 2017\n\n\"Once a psychiatrist wrote me. He had a young patient who had heard of Freddy Krueger and was having nightmares about him. I really wanted to help, so I got in touch with Robert and asked if he would say a few words to the kid into a vidcam. Not only did Robert do that, but he did it while he was being put into, and then out of, his Freddy makeup, describing each step of the way how Freddy was nothing more than latex and glue, and nothing to be worried about.\"\n\n- Wes Craven\n\nI think the first time I saw Robert Englund was about ten years ago when the Masters of Horror anthology series aired in Finland (I love anthologies by the way; film or tv show, it's always exciting to see what the next segment looks like), where he played an MC at a night club with dead strippers. At that point I had already heard of his legendary reputation, but it was only a few days later that I watched the classic A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). I wasn't that impressed, but I hadn't yet become an avid horror fan, so I had no real knowledge about the history of horror film and what place Elm Street has in it to appreciate the movie.\n\nI've since watched only two other Englund movies, Urban Legend (1998) and The Phantom of the Opera (1989), both of which were, er, less than stellar, but I was intrigued by Englund's performances and dedication. The latter shows a mile away, and his memoirs proved me right: he accepts scripts he likes the most, and doesn't care about the financial success of his movies, or whether they win awards and critical acclaim. He just seems like a guy who genuinely respects horror and always puts a hundred percent on the table, and also fully embraces his fanbase (I cannot even remember how many times I've heard how nice and warm he is in person). It's sometimes difficult to see behind a celebrity's public persona, but Englund is one of the few I'm sure is just as nice as he seems to be.\n\nThe tone of the memoir is very conversational, because co-writer Alan Goldsher wrote the book based on Englund's dictations, but that suits his style. He has a great sense of humour, and reading this felt like I was sitting at a diner with him eating pancakes, drinking coffee, and listening to him talk about his escapades. No dirt here, though, he only discusses his work and leaves most of his personal life out, which I respect. It should also be remembered, that being a memoir of Robert Englund, this really does focus on him and his point of view of his career, so there's no reason to expect a whole book to be just about Freddy (despite the cover).\n\nThere's a lot of repetition about the problems Englund had with makeup and naturally the focus is on his, I presume, favorite projects, but I guess at least the latter is expected when space is limited. A thick tome wouldn't have been as alluring, although I still would have liked to get a little deeper look of the movie industry from a horror actor's perspective. So, although I didn't passionately adore the memoir, I think it's still worth the read for every horror fan (doesn't matter if you're an Elm Street fan), even if it's just for 'hearing' the voice of the man himself.\n\nMost of the anecdotes are entertaining, and it's always great to hear a bit about the behind-the-scenes stuff. Saying how enjoyable it was to work with the legendary Roger Corman is fine, but \"catering that consisted of peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner\" or mere plastic chairs in the depressing dressing rooms are more telling things about Corman and his frugal ways.\n\nI also felt a sting of jealousy that Englund's childhood was surrounded by the entertainment industry in the most positive way, like stumbling into Clark Gable in the grocery store, visiting the sets of his uncles' tv shows, or \"watching cowboy stuntmen do horse falls on the RKO backlot behind my house\". It's interesting how his parents took him to see scary adult movies, and they somehow stayed with him so that despite a stint as a California surfer (!) and a classically trained theater actor, he became a horror icon. It's also due to the brilliance of a modern musical (Stephen Sondheim's Company) that made him realize art could be both popular and meaningful. I wish I'd seen him play Judas in Godspell, that would be one of my time machine destinations.\n\nSurprisingly, there was some Finnish presence as well: I had no idea Renny Harlin had directed a Freddy Krueger movie! I'm not a fan, but Englund had nothing but positive things to say about him and his modesty and perceptiveness. Anyway, Freddy Krueger sneaking around the Desilu Studios (where, strangely, the home of I Love Lucy was) is something I want to see again, so I'm going to be rewatching Elm Street soon. Maybe even tonight, it's already dark. Although I need to stop thinking about the story how the concept of the film was conceived. That was scary as hell. I'm glad I live in an apartment building.\n\nNovember 4, 2009\n\nThe man behind Freddy Kruger gives a recap of his life and career, offering some interesting showbiz backstage anecdotes and tales from behind Freddy's burnt face along the way. Englund (and his ghostwriter) needs some help in weaving his tales together, and the book really is more recap than expose or insight. Many of the best parts of the book are anecdotal and nothing more, such as Englund's audition for the drama program at CSUN, where he was awed by the young actor who auditioned right before him: Richard Dreyfus.\n\nIf the book has a strength, it's in how Englund discusses the notion of the working actor: he who takes parts and acts to live and make a comfortable--versus luxurious--lifestyle. Like any skilled worker or tradesman, Englund discusses the work ethic involved and of being one of the lucky few working actors (he never refers to himself as a star) who are able to make a living in front of the camera and enjoy a modicum of fame...but not being rich by Will Smith standards. It's a job, and he takes it seriously.\n\nAs a fan of the \"Nightmare\" franchise, I was interested in the behind-the-scenes tales, but really, there isn't much here that will intrigue anyone but hard-core Freddy fans (and even then, not so much).\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\nThis book was a solid read. Being that I am a huge fan of the Nightmare series this was an instant must read for me. I loved learning about Robert's extensive theater work prior to his Nightmare days. My only gripe is Urban Legend is never mentioned. He goes straight from New Nightmare to Freddy vs. Jason. Being that he had a big role in that movie I thought it would be interesting to read about his experiences during the filming. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to any Nightmare on Elm Street fan.\n\nOctober 30, 2016\n\nRobert England really speaks as an uncle that tells you fun and inappropriate stories about his life. But England also shows how the slasher sub genre has been popular from the 80's. It's also cool to see that he keeps up with his cast and crew mates and what projects their working on. And yes his insights with his film&TV projects from V to Freddy vs. Jason are worth reading. So if you're a fan of film, Robert England, or Nightmare on Elm Street, check out this book.\n\nFebruary 22, 2021\n\nI enjoyed learning about the actor behind Freddy Krueger and, of course, the behind the scenes tidbits for the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. Robert Englund shares plenty of candid insights in this book. I understand now why he doesn't want to be in the makeup chair again for Freddy, and I started to laugh by the last time he references fire stunt woes from the Nightmare movies. Unfortunately, I was off-put by his comments regarding how sexually attractive he found certain female co-workers.\n\nAugust 13, 2022\n\nA brilliant insight into the 1980s Hollywood that I love. Robert Englund peaks behind the curtain and shares some of the best stories with the best names; Johnny Depp, Wes Craven, Stephen King, Burt Reynolds, Richard Gere, Kris Kristifferson to name a few! My childhood hero and the reason I am a horror fanatic today.\n\nApril 27, 2024\n\nWasn't expecting the most fitting term for Robert Englund's personality to be \"mild-mannered.\" :/\n\nAugust 9, 2009\n\nOverall a great, fast-paced read. I picked up the non-corrected proof at the San Diego Comic-Con a few weeks ago. I've been a huge fan of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise for 20+ years and have followed Robert Englund through his career since but I had no clue about some of the movies he did pre-V and really enjoyed the anecdotes about various A-list stars he's worked with.\n\nThroughout the book you get the sense that Robert Englund really enjoys his fans and his lot in life as horror icon. In each movie he did, despite grueling hours in the makeup chair, not so safe working conditions in foreign countries, and many other difficulties he's endured on the set he seems to find that silver lining in every experience. He seems to be one of the only actors out there who have become synonymous with one of their characters that does not try to run from it but embraces it wholeheartedly.\n\nSurprisingly, the man who played what will be one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history is a congenial man without a bad word to say about anyone. And he had a normal childhood! Which leads to the question: Where did that maniac come from?\n\nDecember 20, 2019\n\nFirst off, what a great title! Welcome to your worst nightmare! It says a lot for Robert Englund, that while many actors have played Dracula, Frankenstein etc. There is only one Freddie Kruger! It's one of those books that, to be honest, I bought at a car boot sale when the stallholder was selling off books at 6 for a quid, & I really only picked it up to make up the six! But what a treat this autobiography was.\n\nA great insight into the movie-making business is coupled with some great tales from Robert's long & distinguished movie & tv career Which is not just Freddie Kruger!\n\nAlso refreshing is nobody gets bad-mouthed in the book, Instead, Robert has a positive word for everyone he has worked with & he has worked with some of the greats. Robert comes over as a charming funny man, with some great tales to tell. I'd have maybe liked to see a few more pictures\n\nincluded, But whether you're a fan of Freddie or a Fan of the hit tv show \"V\" you'll not be disappointed.\n\nRobert Englund turns out started at the bottom & Clawed his way to the very top. 😉\n\nApril 29, 2013\n\n...ever meet somebody at a convention and find him unspeakably charming and personable, only to remember halfway home that he's responsible for most of the nightmares you had as a child? I sure did.\n\nRobert Englund is a witty, energetic man with a really genuine love of his work and his life, and it shows in this relaxed, contemplative look back on his career as a character actor, at his time on the series V, and of course on the Nightmare On Elm Street series he helped turn into a major cultural touchstone for a generation. Interesting insight into the series is provided here, but generally you're reading this for Robert himself, rather than any new information it might contain, because he's just an incredibly cool, likeable guy. I learned that last year at Calgary Expo, and if you get the chance to meet him in person I highly recommend you do so, but if you don't have any such opportunity this book is a great way to get to know him a little better...\n\nMarch 4, 2014\n\nI picked up the book and read it from cover to cover in one sitting. It was so interesting, and I loved learning about Robert Englund's life and work (the Nightmare films are great, but he's done so much more besides those. I was really glad he discussed many of the films he's done, and let us know more about himself, the man). He shares his adventures and encounters which such candor and humor, and truly deserves his reputation as one of the nicest and most generous actors you could ever meet. Thank you for all you've given us, Robert!\n\nSeptember 3, 2014\n\nEven for those of us who aren't fans of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series, Robert Englund's tone is engaging enough, and his career varied enough, to make HOLLYWOOD MONSTER a highly enjoyable read. It sorta reminds me of Roger Moore's bio, in that Englund engages in a constant stream of name-dropping that non-cinephiles might find annoying. Personally, though, the only problem I had with the book was that it felt way too short. With the exception of the first couple NIGHTMARE films, most of Englund's other work is discussed in a mere page or two, at most.\n\nFebruary 8, 2018\n\nI've been wanting to read this memoir since it came out. Robert Englund didn't disappoint me as Freddy Krueger and he doesn't disappoint me as a story teller. He has all the wit, charm and sass I was hoping to read. He sounds like he's a down to earth, all around sweet guy. A must read if you're a hardcore Krueger fan.\n\nMarch 21, 2011\n\nWhat an amazing and funny actor....love this man.\n\nMarch 1, 2014\n\nI already knew Robert Englund was my soul mate but after reading this, I am blown away at how amazing this man is past his infamous character Freddy Krueger. Review to come.\n\nAugust 16, 2015\n\nA really interesting look into the man behind the monster. I love hearing crazy behind-the-scenes stories, and this is plum full them. A fun read.\n\nDecember 8, 2019\n\nIt was definitely interesting learning about Robert Englund and his career. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before regarding his time spent playing Freddy Krueger. I enjoyed hearing about his early career and how he became an actor. Those are aspects of his career that I didn't know about. However, I feel myself just wanting to know more about him, to know all the details, and devour them. I've always been a pretty loyal, big fan to Mr. Englund and I just wanted this to be a bigger autobiography with the good and the bad laid out before me. I wanted more pictures, more stories, more insights into what being an actor means to him, etc. However, if you want to know more about the man behind everyone's favorite monster, this is a really good place to start!\n\nJanuary 22, 2022\n\nHighly enjoyable, fast paced chase through Robert Englund's career - packed with anecdotes and Hollywood tidbits. But the thing that makes it so fun to read is Englund, & ghostwriter / editor Goldsher, are so positive, optimistic and generous about everyone; from co workers and directors to fans. Even films that flopped are treated with respect and good nature. Yes Englund can be a touch boastful, and shall we say \"old fashioned\" when talking about female co-stars, but his intention is to be nice about everyone and communicate how lucky he has been in reality, and that that luck has come from hard work and job-acting. Rare it is to get such a warm glow from an actor author; you feel as if you're sitting in Englund's on-set winnebago, swigging whiskey as he regales you with wit, charm and rich insider stories. A joyful escape.\n\nJuly 30, 2022\n\nI have been a fan of Robert Englund since I was 13. He is one of my favorite actors who has done more than playing Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. He is a down to earth actor who loves his fans and has done a lot of films, voiceover work as a voice actor, and has directed some too. If you would like to find out how he got his start as an actor before Freddy and after, then I recommend you check out this autobiography. He also tells how he met his wife when he directed his first ever film 976-evil too and includes color photos of him as a kid and on.\n\nBe sure to check this book out at your local library and wherever books and eBooks are sold. (less)\n\nNovember 2, 2020\n\nI loved this book. Englund is such an amazing talent and such a genuine nice guy, and he’s been around so many Hollywood heavyweights that he has an endless amount of cool behind-the-scenes stories, and I doubt he got through them all in this book. It’s a fun, light read, tons of great tidbits about the nightmare movies, very funny and engaging. A great peek into movie- and TV-making from the 70s to the 2000s. And a fascinating in-depth look at what it’s like to be a character actor and to play a monster under heavy makeup for 20 years.\n\nOctober 10, 2021\n\nGreat book. A typical surfer kid who grew up in L.A. beaches. However, he was a theatre geek who was classically trained for stage and broadway. He got into the \"business\" since the late 60's and competed against Gary Busey for early parts and got most of them. Then he got into the Elm St series and really added \"character\" to the boogeyman character unlike Jason and Mike Myers killing machines. Has embraced his type casting and always humble/ready to sign autographs. Great guy and great story.\n\nOctober 8, 2020\n\nAbsolutely fantastic read for any fan of the nightmare on elm street films, or any of Roberts work in general. Packed full of anecdotes from a long career of acting, guaranteed to give you a giggle along the way this book is like listening to Robert talk directly to you. I couldn’t wait for my copy to arrive and when it did I just couldn’t put it down, I practically inhaled it! I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to give it a read and I’d rate it higher if I could. Fantastic book.\n\nFebruary 16, 2021\n\nFreddy was my first horror love. This book was the perfect mix of the man behind the makeup. I loved reading about what made Englund start acting and where his roots began. I enjoyed reading about the people that he met along the way and the great actors and crew he got to work with. The book was the perfect balance of the man and legend.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nThoroughly enjoyable.\n\nI can hear England's voice whilst reading this book. This is what I wanted it to be. The ramblings of a likeable person who played Freddy Kruger.\n\nI mean. Come on. Like the films, the open free flowing thoughts of Robert will annoy the woke. But meh - what doesn't.\n\nFun! Finished it within 48 hours.\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\n(4.5/5)This whole book felt like sitting down for a drink with Robert Englund while he waxes nostalgic about his acting career, which is one hell of a way to frame a memoir. As much as I loved reading his perspective on all things Nightmare, I'm thrilled to see a reflection on his entire body of work (up to 2009, anyway). Definitely required reading for horror junkies of all ages.\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\nSuch a fantastic read. Robert proves why he has been around for nearly 5 decades at this point. Insightful, humorous and heartfelt in a way that only the guy responsible for Freddy Krueger could bring to you.\n\nAugust 18, 2019\n\nBest look into the life of an icon."
