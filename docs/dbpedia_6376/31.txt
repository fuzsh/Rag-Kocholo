Autograph Resume signed, 1 page, 8Â½x11. New York City, no date. Printed biographical form on which signer has supplied details: date and place of birth, education and professional training, and stage and screen experience. Theatre World, founded in 1945 by Daniel Blum, is America's oldest annual record of Broadway, Off-Broadway and regional theatre, referenced by industry professionals, historians, students and theatre fans worldwide. Until 1998, when a separate nonprofit corporation was established, Theatre World's editorial staff bestowed the prestigious Theatre World Awards for outstanding Broadway and Off-Broadway debuts. Screen World (from 1950) and Dance World (from 1966), administered from the same office, furnished comprehensive information on those entertainment genres. John A. Willis (1916-2010), active in Theatre World from the beginning, became its chief editor in 1965, holding that position until 2008. Willis is regarded as one of the foremost theatre and film historians of the 20th century. While producing (and presenting) the annual Theatre World Awards, Willis also served on the nominating committee for the Tony Awards. Theatre World, which received its own Tony for Excellence in Theatre in 2001, continues under chief editor Ben Hodges. George Englund (1926-2017) is a TV and film producer, director, editor and screenwriter. He has a total of 12 producing credits between 1963 and 1988 and eight directing credits between 1963 and 1984. Englund's first effort as a director, The Ugly American (1963), earned him a Golden Globe nomination. His first wife was actress Cloris Leachman (1953-1978). Normal mailing folds. Lightly creased and toned. Otherwise, fine condition.
