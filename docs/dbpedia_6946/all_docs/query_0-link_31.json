        "text": "The flag of Austria has three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and red. The Austrian flag is said to be among the oldest national flag designs in the world. In fact, the flag was designed in the 13th century by Duke Frederick II of Austria. He sought greater independence from the Holy Roman Emperor. To this end, he had a new coat of arms designed: The double headed eagle, symbolizing the old Austro-Hungarian Empire was replaced with a single headed eagle. Our international flags are accurately reproduced to exact specifications. The flag has 2 brass grommets on the left edge for hanging. Also available below is a Waterproof Vinyl Decal (suitable for outdoor use), offered in both 3.5\"x5\" and 1\"x1.5\" 50-pack decal set.. Polyester flags are imported and not recommended for prolonged outdoor use. For outdoor use, we recommend our nylon flags. Also available below is an indoor/ceremonial version of the flag with a pole sleeve and gold fringe.\n\nNOTE: Indoor flags are made-to-order, so please allow 2-3 days before your order will ship if you order an indoor flag."
