        "text": "After Gustav I Vasa was elected to the throne in 1523, he began to restore the power of the Swedish king and to organize a central administration under his own direct leadership. On the one hand, this task was facilitated by the elimination of a great part of the high nobility by the Stockholm Bloodbath. On the other hand, the influence of the king was limited by the economic dependence on Lübeck and the Hanseatic League. In connection with the war against Denmark and the liberation of Stockholm in 1523, Gustav Vasa had been forced to make great concessions to Lübeck, which had given him both economic and military support. In exchange, the merchants of Lübeck and the Hanseatic League had been given privileges that created a monopoly of Swedish foreign trade and even had considerable influence on domestic trade and industry. The concessions also included a large payment and left Sweden heavily in debt to Lübeck. Under the mediation of Lübeck, the war with Denmark was brought to an end by a treaty concluded in Malmö in 1524.\n\nAfter the death of the Danish king Frederick I, his son Christian III became king in 1534. When Lübeck attempted at this time to restore the exiled Christian II as king in Denmark, Gustav Vasa gave the young Christian III strong military support in a war against Lübeck. The Hanseatic army was beaten in 1535, and by the terms of a truce in 1536 the Swedish debt to Lübeck was wiped out and the privileges of Lübeck traders were abolished. By this action Hanseatic hegemony was destroyed, other foreign traders were allowed to enter Sweden, and Swedish traders could now move freely beyond the Baltic. Sweden’s relations with Denmark remained peaceful for the rest of Gustav Vasa’s reign.\n\nGustav Vasa devoted the major part of his rule to domestic politics, and he is credited with establishing Sweden as a sovereign state. His initial goal as king was to stabilize the nation’s financial situation. Through stern acts passed by the Diet at Västerås in 1527, he was able to confiscate all the properties of the Roman Catholic Church. The church at that time held 21 percent of Sweden’s land, as opposed to only 6 percent held by the crown. The appropriation of the possessions of the church thus added enormously to the wealth of the state. To some degree the king could justify his actions on the basis of the doctrines of Martin Luther, which were being accepted nationwide with royal encouragement. The Swedish and Roman Catholic churches separated as the Reformation spread, and the Lutheran Swedish church was eventually adopted as the state church. The establishment of the new religious order occurred simultaneously with a reorganization of government, which was accomplished with the assistance of German administrators brought in by Gustav. The new, highly centralized administration attained an unprecedented degree of efficiency.\n\nDuring the latter part of his reign Gustav achieved absolute power and ruled Sweden in accordance with his own precepts. In 1544 the king established a hereditary monarchy in Sweden and accelerated the annexations of land, which finally gave the crown direct possession of about 60 percent of Swedish soil before he died. Gustav Vasa has been compared to a landowner in his behaviour toward the crown properties and the state incomes. He personally took part in developing their administration, and he continuously inspected the crown servants. He nominated county governors himself and reserved the most important charges for members of his own family. Money economy had barely come to Sweden, and many state incomes were therefore paid in kind. Some of the goods exchanged were used directly to feed and clothe public servants and soldiers, while others were sold to foreign merchants. Gustav took great pleasure in literally filling the treasury, in which condition it was handed over to his son. The nobility was allowed no part in state affairs, and the Diet was convened only for royal propaganda, of which Gustav was a master.\n\nNot surprisingly, Gustav’s new system was not universally accepted. In such regions as Västergötland, Dalarna, and Småland, there was considerable resentment over the imposition of state control. In the 1530s and ’40s the farmers grumbled over taxes, and the clergymen complained about interference in church matters. Gustav met opposition from his former friends—e.g., the farmer-miners of Dalarna—with the same ruthlessness as that from other dissenters. Gustav led a careful foreign policy, but nevertheless, a considerable army and a strong navy were created during his reign. Sweden also advanced culturally under Gustav’s rule: among the notable literary accomplishments of the period were a complete translation of the New Testament into Swedish and the publication of the hymns and theological writings of Olaus Petri, who played an important role in the Swedish Reformation.\n\nFollowing the death of Gustav Vasa, his eldest son, Erik XIV, became king. In his will Gustav had, however, appointed his younger sons dukes and given them part of the realm as duchies with great power in domestic affairs. One of the first steps taken by Erik XIV was to strip his brothers of all power by a treaty that he forced them to sign at Arboga in 1561. The main interest of Erik XIV was, however, devoted to foreign policy. One of his goals was to gain control of Russian trade through the Baltic ports. As a first step, he negotiated with the Estonian nobility, which agreed to Swedish rule in 1561 and thereby laid the foundation for a Swedish Baltic empire. His aspirations led to conflicts with Denmark and Lübeck, which, up to the 16th century, had been the leading powers in this region. Control of the Baltic Sea became a central issue. In the 16th and 17th centuries the Baltic region—Europe’s main source of grain, iron, copper, timber, tar, hemp, and furs—was as important as either the Mediterranean or the Atlantic. The Swedish effort to gain control over trade in the Baltic resulted in war with Denmark, Lübeck, and Poland in 1563. After seven bloody years, during which the southern parts of Sweden were ravaged, a peace was signed at Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) in 1570, without change to any of the borders. Sweden was forced, however, to pay a large ransom to retrieve the fortress of Älvsborg, its only stronghold in the west of the country. Before the peace was concluded, Erik XIV, accused of lunacy after having murdered some of the leading aristocrats by his own hand, was deposed in 1568 by his brother John, who was supported by the high nobility. Erik later died in prison, probably having been poisoned on the order of his brother.\n\nWith the support of the high nobility, John III ascended to the throne in 1568. His reign (1568–92) was characterized by conflict between the king and the high nobility, who asked for a constitutional government and greater influence for the council. At the same time, John tried to reintroduce Roman Catholic customs into the Swedish church, which led to conflict with the clergy. His religious policy was a consequence of his marriage to a Polish princess and the subsequent close political alliance between Sweden and Poland.\n\nTheir son, Sigismund III Vasa, was elected king of Poland in 1587 before inheriting the throne of Sweden in 1592. Opposition to Sigismund developed because of his Roman Catholicism and his extensive stays in Poland. At a meeting in Uppsala in 1593 the clergy adopted a declaration that became the definitive confirmation of Sweden as a Lutheran country. The strong feelings against Sigismund were also exploited by his uncle Charles, who organized all conceivable Swedish opposition against the recognition of Sigismund. By doing so, Charles made the Diet (and of course the clergy) a political force against the high nobility. The final outcome was the resignation of Sigismund in 1599.\n\nCharles IX was an administrator very much like his father. His foreign policy aimed at dominating the Russian trade routes toward the Kola Peninsula and the White Sea and at grasping as much as possible of the territory (Russian and other) south of the Gulf of Finland. Sweden thus was susceptible to Danish attack, which came in 1611 and began the so-called Kalmar War, a conflict that ended with the Peace of Knäred in 1613. By the terms of the peace, Sweden had to renounce its claim on the territories in the far north of Scandinavia and pay a new large ransom for the fortress of Älvsborg, taken by the Danes during the war. Charles IX, however, did not live to experience the defeat.\n\nThe Age of Greatness in Sweden\n\nThe early Vasa kings created the Swedish state. Its chief characteristic was a strong monarchy in a rather rustic and backward economy (with the mining industry a noteworthy exception). Its chief weaknesses were opposition from the high nobility and a thirst for revenge on Denmark. In the following decades Sweden relegated Denmark to second place in the north and became a most aggressive great power.\n\nThe reign of Gustav II Adolf\n\nGustav II Adolf (Gustavus II Adolphus; ruled 1611–32) was only 16 years old when his father, Charles IX, died, so the actual leadership passed to the aristocrat Axel Oxenstierna and the council. The regency period lasted only a few months, however, before Gustav Adolf took full power. After the Kalmar War, the king joined in organizing the Swedes for the next war. Civil servants and officers were selected exclusively from among the nobility. A standing army was organized: the infantry was conscripted among the peasants and regularly trained by officers who lived on the king’s farms among their soldiers. Only the cavalry and the navy were professional. Swedish copper and iron were made into the best firearms of the period. The Swedish field artillery proved especially mobile and effective. The central administration was professionalized and became a model of efficiency. Directing it were members of the high nobility, working together in collegiate bodies. The new organization of the Swedish administration, parts of which still exist, was confirmed by the constitution adopted in 1634.\n\nWhen Gustav II Adolf ascended the throne, the country was already embroiled in wars with Denmark, Russia, and Poland. As noted above, the war with Denmark was concluded by the Peace of Knäred with some losses for Sweden. The war with Russia was fought more successfully, however; Swedish armies even reached Moscow. Russia was thereby forced to agree to the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617, by the terms of which Sweden acquired the provinces of Ingria and Kexholm. The war with Poland continued into the 1620s, and after several campaigns in the Baltic States it was successfully concluded in 1629 by the Truce of Altmark, by which Sweden received Livonia and the right to the customs of key Baltic harbours. At about the same time, Gustav Adolf negotiated with France for its support against the Holy Roman emperor, whose armies threatened the south shores of the Baltic. In 1630 Gustav Adolf with his Swedish army landed in northern Germany, joining in the Thirty Years’ War. In 1631 Sweden concluded its treaty with France, and, at Breitenfeld in that same year, the Swedish army practically annihilated the imperial forces under the famous Bavarian general Count von Tilly.\n\nGustav Adolf’s German campaign swept southward, and by late 1631 he had taken Mainz and Frankfurt am Main. By the spring and summer of 1632, he had marched through Bavaria, where Nürnberg, Augsburg, and Munich also fell. At Lützen on November 6, Gustav Adolf’s Swedish forces engaged the imperial army led by Albrecht von Wallenstein, and a fierce battle ensued. The encounter resulted in an important tactical victory for Sweden but at great cost: Gustav Adolf was killed in battle.\n\nGustav Adolf’s only heir, his daughter, Christina, had not reached her sixth birthday at the time of her father’s death. A council of the high nobility led by the chancellor Axel Oxenstierna controlled the regency during her minority. The council resolved to carry on the war against the Holy Roman Empire despite its great cost and a diminishing imperial threat.\n\nSwedish warfare through the mid-17th century\n\nFor 16 more years the war continued with varying success. The Swedish armies, which at the beginning of the war were composed largely of Swedish peasants, consisted during its later stages mostly of mercenaries from Germany, Scotland, and England. Many foreign officers took up permanent residence in Sweden and were ennobled. At the Peace of Westphalia, which in 1648 ended the war, Sweden was granted most of Pomerania and other territorial concessions along the Baltic and the North Sea coasts, but the Polish ports had to be relinquished.\n\nSweden’s strategic position was now entirely changed, and in a short war with Denmark (1643–45) Sweden demonstrated its military superiority and established its position as the dominant power in the Baltic region. During the reign of Queen Christina (ruled 1644–54), the transfer of crown property to the nobility, which had begun as an instrument to finance the wars, continued on an increasing scale. The queen, however, proved to have a remarkably independent will. She refused to marry, and she used the Diet and the threat of the Reduction (return of crown properties) to have her first cousin, Charles Gustav of the Palatinate, recognized as heir to the throne. Then Christina, the daughter of the “saviour of Protestantism,” abdicated, converted publicly to Catholicism, and went to Rome, where she lived the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1655 Charles X Gustav (ruled 1654–60) initiated a campaign (known as the First Northern War) in Poland and conquered most of the country. When in 1657 the resistance grew stronger, Denmark used the opportunity to declare war. Charles Gustav then turned his forces toward Denmark. In one of the most daring exploits in military history, he led his troops over the straits called the Belts, which only rarely freeze over, and scored a quick victory over the Danes. In the Peace of Roskilde that followed in February 1658, Sweden acquired the provinces of Skåne, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, thus establishing the country’s modern-day boundaries. In addition, Sweden received Trondheim and the island of Bornholm, both of which were lost two years later when Charles Gustav, in a second war against Denmark, tried to take the entire country and achieve his goal of unifying Scandinavia. The king suddenly died after failing to capture Copenhagen.\n\nCharles XI, only four years old at his father’s death, became king. During the long regency that followed, the influence of the high nobility under the chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie grew to a degree that threatened the freedom of the peasants and the finances of the crown. In 1672, at age 17, Charles XI led a difficult offensive against Denmark for possession of the southern provinces. Peace was finally agreed to in 1679 with no advantage for either side, and Charles was then faced with the enormous problem of reorganizing the economy and the administration of the country.\n\nImpact of continuous warfare on Sweden\n\nA generation of continuous warfare had had a profound impact on Swedish society. The Swedish nobility had gained about two-thirds of Swedish and Finnish soil through the transfer of crown property and of royal ground taxes. The nobles wanted to perpetuate this process and to introduce the same feudal structure that they had seen and used in their annexations in the Baltic area.\n\nThis danger to Swedish and Finnish peasants was not finally averted until the 1680s, when the noble possessions were greatly reduced. The reduction had started in the 1650s as a means of leverage to get the high nobles to pay their taxes and agree to various acts. Faced with this threat, the high nobility agreed to pay, and even agreed to minor reductions in their possessions. While Charles XI was still a minor during the 1660s, the high nobles were able to retain their advantages for yet another generation.\n\nWith the reduction of the holdings of the nobility in the 1680s, Sweden returned to the political structure of the early Vasa kings. The income of public properties recaptured from the nobility was permanently allotted to public servants, officers, and soldiers. This system, which remained in force throughout the 18th century and far into the 19th, made the crown less dependent on the Diet in matters of finance. The years 1680–1700 were a period of consolidation. It has been called the Carolingian absolutism, because it occurred during the reign of Charles XI (ruled 1672–97). But, because of the precariousness of the Swedish annexations in the Baltic, the Carolingian absolutism involved a continuous preparation for war.\n\nThe reign of Charles XII\n\nCharles XII acceded to the throne at age 15 at a time when, in the hinterland of the Baltic coast, dominated by the Swedes, new states were being formed. Brandenburg and Russia, together with such older states as Denmark and Poland, were natural enemies of Sweden. Denmark, Poland, and Russia made a treaty in 1699, while Prussia preferred to wait and see. The Second Northern War (also known as the Great Northern War) began when the three allies attacked the Swedish provinces in February 1700, prompting a swift retaliatory attack on Denmark by Swedish forces. The strike by Sweden forced Denmark to leave the alliance and conclude peace. The Russian army, which had invaded Sweden’s Baltic provinces, was shortly afterward overwhelmingly beaten by Charles’s troops at the Battle of Narva. Charles then turned toward Poland (1702–06). In so doing, he gave the Russian tsar, Peter I (the Great), sufficient time to found St. Petersburg and a Baltic fleet and to reorganize the Russian army. Charles XII began his Russian offensive in 1707. The Russians for the first time used a scorched-earth strategy, thus diverting the Swedish armies from Moscow to Ukraine, where the Swedes suffered a crushing defeat at Poltava in June 1709.\n\nCharles spent the next five years in Bender (now Tighina, Moldova), then under Ottoman rule, attempting in vain to persuade the Ottomans to attack Russia. The sultan clearly had no reason to do so, because Peter had turned his attention toward the Baltic. In the years following Poltava, Russia occupied all the Swedish annexations on the Baltic coast and even Finland; Hanover occupied Bremen and Verden; Denmark took Holstein-Gottorp; and Prussia lay waiting for the Swedish part of Pomerania.\n\nAstonishingly, Charles governed Sweden from his residence in Bender during this catastrophe. In 1715 he returned to Sweden (he had left in 1700). He then decided to attack Norway in order to obtain a western alliance against the Baltic powers. On November 30, 1718, during a siege of the fortress of Fredriksten east of Oslo Fjord, Charles was killed by a bullet of either Norwegian or Swedish origin. His death ended the so-called Age of Greatness. By the Peace of Nystad (1721), Sweden formally resigned the Baltic provinces, part of Karelia, and the city of Vyborg (near St. Petersburg) to Russia.\n\nSocial and economic conditions in Sweden in the 16th and 17th centuries\n\nAs in most of Europe, agriculture was the main preoccupation in the Scandinavian countries in the 16th and 17th centuries. But increasing economic activity in these centuries stimulated a more specialized and commercial exploitation of their natural resources.\n\nBecause of the growing demand for cereals and meat in western Europe, Denmark underwent the same change as did the countries east of the Elbe—the domanial system was introduced for commercial agriculture and cattle raising. Sweden and Norway had other resources. Their forests were still virgin, thus providing the indispensable raw materials for European shipbuilding and overseas expansion. Because the trees grew slowly, the wood became hard and well suited also for furniture and tools.\n\nThe mining industry in Sweden was founded in the 13th century. In the 16th and 17th centuries copper and iron were the most important exports from Sweden. But Sweden also had its own metallurgical industry, producing weapons especially.\n\nThe Scandinavian countries had very little active foreign trade of their own. Only Dutch and British—and to a certain extent German—merchants had sufficient capital and the foreign ties to organize the export.\n\nThe landlordship in Sweden sprang less from economic than from political causes. The Swedish nobility had a vested interest in lifting Sweden from its underdog position of the 16th century. As noted, the nobles acquired strong positions as commanders and administrators in the conquered areas. Thus, in Sweden, they were able to introduce the domanial system on the soil transferred to them during the Age of Greatness. But, in great contrast to Denmark or the conquered areas, serfdom never came to Sweden; Swedish farmers remained free. Sweden was the only European country in which peasants formed the fourth estate in the Diet. Since the Middle Ages royal propaganda had been designed to influence the opinion of the peasants in political matters.\n\nBecause Swedish industry was adapted to Sweden’s aggressive foreign policy and because exports were in foreign hands, there was little room for an independent bourgeoisie in this period. Social mobility was primarily influenced by the state. Individual careers and personal fortunes could best be made as soldiers, purveyors to the crown, officers, and public servants. In the 16th and 17th centuries the social structure of Sweden also spread to the formerly completely agrarian Finland.\n\nSwedish society had a considerable capacity for assimilation. Although Denmark-Norway did not until 1720 give up hope of recapturing the provinces that had been lost to Sweden about the middle of the 17th century, it could not count on active support from the populations of these provinces."
