Poland, like the Near East is located at a crossroads of the east and west, and because of this has experienced waves of invasion from Asia in the east and Europe in the west, and through it all the Poles have survived again and again. This is their story told with the help of their banners and flags.\n\n| Top of Page | Medieval Poland 900 to 1599 | 17th and 18th Century Poland 1600 to 1795 |\n\n| Alliance of the Three Black Eagles (Poland Partitioned) 1795 to 1807 | Napoleonic Era and Poland 1807-1824 |\n\n| The Congress of Vienna and its Aftermath 1820-1914 | World War I and the Parliamentary Democracy 1914 to 1926 |\n\n| Second Republic of Poland (Sanacja) 1926 to 1939 | World War II (German and Soviet occupation) 1939 to 1945 |\n\n| People's Polish Republic (Communist regime) 1945 to 1999 | Third Republic of Poland 1999 to present |\n\nFlags and Banners of Medieval Poland 900-1599\n\nDuring the 10th Century, the Polish nation was led by a series of rulers who converted their people to Christianity, created a strong kingdom and integrated Poland into the European culture. Internal in-fighting destroyed the kingdom in the 13th Century, but the slow process of rebuilding that took place in the 1300s laid the base for a new and powerful Kingdom of Poland.\n\nBeginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila, the Jagiellon dynasty (1385â1569) formed the Polish-Lithuanian partnership that proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians, who co-existed and cooperated to form one of the most powerful states in Europe for the next three centuries.\n\nHowever, the Nihil Novi Act adopted by the Polish Sejm (parliament) in 1505, transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the Sejm. This marked the beginning of the period known as the \"Golden Liberty,\" when the state was ruled by the \"free and equal\" Polish nobility. Of course, little attention was paid to the wishes of the common people. The Union of Lublin of 1569 formally established the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which became an influential power in Europe and helped to spread Western Culture eastwards.\n\n| Top of Page | Medieval Poland 900 to 1599 | 17th and 18th Century Poland 1600 to 1795 |\n\n| Alliance of the Three Black Eagles (Poland Partitioned) 1795 to 1807 | Napoleonic Era and Poland 1807-1824 |\n\n| The Congress of Vienna and its Aftermath 1820-1914 | World War I and the Parliamentary Democracy 1914 to 1926 |\n\n| Second Republic of Poland (Sanacja) 1926 to 1939 | World War II (German and Soviet occupation) 1939 to 1945 |\n\n| People's Polish Republic (Communist regime) 1945 to 1999 | Third Republic of Poland 1999 to present |\n\nThe Flags and Banners of 17th and 18th Century Poland 1600-1795\n\nPolish Naval Ensign\n\nPolish Naval Ensign/Jack 1627\n\nThis colorful flag was a unique Naval Ensign (or Jack) of the Polish Navy. Poland has had naval traditions since 1558 when the Polish King Sigismund August (Zygmund August) created the first Polish fleet under the command of Admiral Thomas Sierpinek.\n\nIn 1624, the first Polish dockyard was founded at Puck and on November 28, 1627, the Polish Navy, under Admiral Dickman, fought off the Swedish fleet at Oliwa, near Gdansk (Danzig) using this battle ensign.\n\nBanner of Wladyslaw IV Waza\n\nBanner of Wladyslaw IV Waza 1632-1648\n\nWladyslaw IV Waza (1632-1648) claimed to be the King of both Poland and Sweden. It should be noted, that Wladislaw IV never was king of Sweden. This was only a title of pretence. His father, Zygmunt III Waza, had been king of Sweden, but was disposed when he wanted to turn Sweden catholic.\n\nStrangely enough, Wladyslaw as Prince had a chance to become the Tsar of all of Russia, because while the Poles occupied Moscow in 1610, the Russian boyars (nobles) agreed to proclaim the young prince Tsar, on the condition he convert to the Eastern Orthodoxy. Both, his father (Sigismund III of Poland and Sweden) and the Pope in Rome, rejected that offer and the deal felt through. The Poles were expelled from the Kremlin in 1612 in a popular uprising. That date, November 4th, is now a national holiday in Russia (with the strong, anti-Polish undertones) that replaces the November 7th \"October Revolution\" celebrations.\n\nWladyslaw as King of Poland did managed to prevent the Commonwealth from becoming embroiled in the bloody Thirty Years' War that ravaged western Europe during his reign, and he was fairly successful in defending the Commonwealth from invasion. He supported religious tolerance and carried out military reforms. He failed, however, to realize his dreams of fame and conquest, or to reform and strengthen the Commonwealth. His death marked the end of the Golden Age of the Commonwealth, as the conflicts and tensions that Wladyslaw had failed to resolve led in 1648 to the greatest of the Cossack uprisings, the Khmelnytsky Uprising, and to Swedish invasion.\n\nBanner of Jan Kazimierz\n\nBattle Banner of Jan Kazimierz 1648-1668\n\nThis is the battle standard of the last Vasa king, John Casimir (Jan Kazimierz) 1648-68. It has the sheaf of wheat, mark of the Vasas, embroidered on the eagle's chest. This banner is now on display in the Military Museum in Stockholm. That standard was used during the Polish-Russian War of 1654-67 and the Swedish invasion known as \"The Deluge\", when the Swedish troops overrun almost the entire country and brought a tremendous destruction to it.\n\nDuring that war a legendary miracle happened at the monastery on the Bright Mountain in Czestochowa. The Swedish troops encircled the hill with the monastery, which was housing the ancient painting of \"The Black Madonna\", believed to be the work of Saint Luke the Apostle. The defenders of the monastery, a handful of knights and monks, were hopelessly awaiting the final assault of the Swedes, but in the morning they found them all gone. The local peasants told them that at down the Virgin Mary appeared over the monastery and covered it with her cloak. The Swedes, as Protestants, didn't share the veneration of the Virgin Mary accorded to her by the Catholics, and seeing her protecting the monastery on the hill retreated in panic.\n\nAfter that, the painting of the Black Madonna became holy to the Poles and the Monastery of the Bright Mount is the holiest place in all of Poland, site of the mass pilgrimages.\n\nBanner of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi\n\nCossack Hetmanate Banner\n\nCossack Uprising Banners 1648-1757\n\nThe Khmelnytskyi Uprising was a Cossack rebellion in Ukraine in 1648-1657 which turned into an Ukrainian war of liberation from Poland. Under the command of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, the Zaporozhian Cossacks allied with the Crimean Tatars, and fought several battles against the armies of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The result destroyed the control of the Polish Commonwealth over the country.\n\nAlthough the Uprising started as the rebellion of the Cossacks, it was soon joined by the Orthodox Christian peasants, burghers, and petty nobility of the Ukraine, with the ultimate aim of a creation of an autonomous Ukrainian state. The Uprising succeeded in ending the Polish influence over those Cossack lands, but the Ukraine was eventually taken over by Imperial Russia. These events, along with internal conflicts and hostilities with Sweden and Russia, resulted in severely diminished Polish power during this period and is often referred to in Polish history as \"The Deluge.\"\n\nThe names: \"Ukraine\" and \"Ukrainians\" were not in use at those times. Khmielnitskyi wanted to call his country \"Rus,\" after the Kievan Rus of the IXth Century. But after consigning it to Russia in the Treaty of Pereyslav in 1654, it was totally lost and absorbed into the Russian Empire.\n\nBanner of Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki\n\nMichal Korybut Wisniowiecki 1669- 1673\n\nMichal (Michael) Korybut Wisniowiecki was elected king by the Sejm (Parliament) of the gentry after the abdication of John II Casimir (Jan II Kazimierz). He was the son of the famous, albeit controversial, military commander, Prince Jeremi (Jeremiah) Wisniowiecki accused of excessive brutality in trying to subdue the Khmielnitskyi Uprising of the Cossacks. Michael reign was less than successful. His father's military fame notwithstanding, he had lost the war with the Turks and the province of Podolia (Podole). He couldn't reconcile the warring factions of the nobility and was rather poor administrator of the country. After his 4-year, unimaginative reign, a great king was elected - John III Sobieski.\n\nThis is the Royal banner of Michael, slightly simplified (without the ornate embroidery along the edges).\n\nBanner of Jan III Sobieski\n\nBanner of Jan III Sobieski 1674-1696\n\nJan III Sobieski (1674-96) the last great King of Poland. This is his personal battle banner (standard). As the Grand Hetman of the Crown (the highest military rank of the Commonwealth) he did achieve several great victories over the Cossacks, Tatar and Turks (Chocim 1673).\n\nAs The King, his biggest triumph was the victory at Vienna in 1683. Commanding the Polish, German and Austrian armies he struck the Turks besieging Vienna with the awesome force of his hussars and forced them to run in panic for their life. He was hailed as the \"Savior of Vienna and Western European civilization\" by the Pope and the Turks called him respectfully \"The Lion of Lechistan.\" His troops gathered a huge loot abandoned by the Turks in their camp and hauled it happily home. The Turkish banners of Kara Mustafa's army were sent to Rome as a war trophy.\n\nThe Wettin Kings\n\n(Saxon Kings)\n\nBanner of Królestwo Polskie\n\nKingdon of Saxony and Poland\n\nBanner of Królestwo Polskie (Kingdom of Poland) 1697-1764\n\nThis was the Banner of the Królestwo Polskie (Kingdom of Poland) during the Saxon reign of Poland (1697-1764). It began when the Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony was elected King of Saxony and Poland in 1697 as \"Augustus II the Strong.\" However, since the Saxons were allied with Russia, a power struggle developed between Augustus II and the Swedish and French who supported Stanislaw Leszczyński as king. To further confuse things, between 1704 and 1709 Augustus II was forced to renounce his throne when King Charles XII of Sweden marched into the Kingdom of Saxony and Poland during the Great Northern War. Charles forced the Polish nobility to accept Stanislaw Leszczyński as Stanislaw I. In 1709 Charles inturn suffered a defeat from the Russians and lost his throne. Augustus II became King of Poland again. This dynastic tension continued until Augustus' death in 1733, and eventually saw Stanislaw Leszczyński once again ascended to the Polish crown as Stanislaw I with his French and Swedish support.\n\nIn the end, however, the Russians prevailed by imposing the election of Augustus III Sas (the Saxon), son of Augustus II, who would rule for 30-years. During his 30-year rule Augustus spent only three years in Poland and neglected the affairs of the state to the point of allowing total anarchy. His son was supposed to be the next king of Poland, but lost the Russian's support who then forced the election of Catherine the Great's lover, Stanislaus Poniatowski instead.\n\nNevertheless, the Constitution of 1791, is still regarded as Europe's first modern codified national constitution and it established the hereditary throne of Poland. Unfortunately, it came too late to save the country and Poland was soon erased from the political map by the Third Partition between Russia, Prussia and Austria, who were afraid of the impact that constitution could have had on their own empires and the rest of Europe.\n\nBanner of Stanislaw August Poniatowski\n\nBanner of Stanislaw August Poniatowski 1764-1795\n\nStanislaw August Poniatowski (Stanislav II), was the last King and Grand Duke of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1764â95). As a young man, through the influence of Russian Empress Elizabeth and Chancellor Bestuzhev-Ryumin, he joined the Russian court as ambassador of Saxony. At Saint Petersburg he met and befriended the married twenty-six-year-old future Empress Catherine Alexeievna (Catherine the Great). By 1768, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had effectively became a protectorate of the Russian Empire. In 1770, the Council of the Bar Confederation proclaimed him dethroned.\n\nAs the last king, Poniatowski witnessed the Russian army's crushing of the Bar Confederation (1768-72), and although he protested the first partition of the Commonwealth in 1772, he was powerless to do anything about it. Russia saw to it that Poland did not exist anymore at the end of his reign.\n\nBar Confederacy Standard\n\nBar Confederacy Standard 1766-1772\n\nAn union of the Polish nobility in the defense of the faith and the independence of the country. It was organized against the king, Slanislus Augustus Poniatowski, and the Russians, who were supporting him. It was the first National Uprising against the foreign meddling in the affairs of the country.\n\nOne of the leading military commanders of the Confederacy was Count Kazimierz (Casimir) Pulaski, who eventually became the National Hero of Poland and the United States. In America, he is hailed as the \"Father of the American Cavalry.\" He died, mortally wounded in the Battle of Savannah, while leading the cavalry charge against the British.\n\nDuring the Confederacy, Pulaski was joined by his good friend, a Hungarian-Slovak aristocrat, Count Maurycy Beniowski (he considered himself Polish after that). He was an ultimate adventurer: captured by the Russians, exiled to the Far East, he managed to escape hijacking a Russian ship and the daughter of the Russian commander. His journeys took him almost around the world, Hawaii, Macau, the United States, France and Madagascar. He established a close friendship with Benjamin Franklin, whom he was trying to persuade to take Madagascar as an American colony, and was in America again to be at his friend's bedside (Pulaski's) just before he died. Finally, he returned one more time to Madagascar where he became an Emperor by popular acclaim.\n\nPoland-Lithuania Banner\n\nBanner of Poland-Lithuania 1772\n\nThe last state flag of the Commonwealth of the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The flag features the combined Arms of the Crown (Poland) and Lithuania (Grand Duchy). The Polish White Eagle is joined by the charging knight on the horse Vytis (Chaser).\n\nThere was also another banner in use during the rule of the last King Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski, a battle banner of the military formations of the Commonwealth of Both Nations featuring the common coat-of-arms of the State.\n\nKosciuszko Insurrection Banner\n\nThe Kosciuszko Insurrection of 1794\n\nJust before the third and final partition of Poland, General Thaddeus (Tadeusz) Kosciuszko, the National Hero of Poland and the American War for Independence, organized this uprising against Russia, Prussia, the Polish King and the Targowica Confederation (plotting the demise of the rest of independence left after the second partition). Kosciuszko's proclamation, after he assumed the powers of the Commander-in-Chief of all Polish forces, vowed \"not to abuse these powers to oppress any person, but to defend the integrity of the borders of Poland, regain the independence of the nation, and to strengthen universal liberties.\"\n\nAfter the initial successes against both Russian and Prussian armies, the Kosciuszko's forces, poorly armed (many peasant carried only straightened scythes) were overwhelmed and Kosciuszko himself, wounded, was taken prisoner and sent to Saint Peterburg. There he was freed on the intervention of the U.S. Ambassador to the Imperial Court, John Paul Jones. Many historians blame Kosciuszko for precipitating the final partition and the demise of Poland for the next 123 years, but others maintain it was planned and inevitable anyway. With better military equipment the insurrection could have a chance to be victorious. Kosciuszko partially abolished the serfdom of the peasants and granted them the civil liberties, thus many of them enlisted in his units.\n\nAlthough the insurgents used the flags and banners of the Commonwealth, there were other, specific, vexillums carried into battles. One of them, a peasant banner with the slogan \"Zywia y Bronia\" (We Feed and Defend) is shown here.\n\n- My thanks to Chrystian Kretowicz for all his expert help, research, advise, and images used on this page -\n\n| Learn about \"The Evolution of the Polish Coat-of-Arms\" Here |\n\n| Top of Page | Medieval Poland 900 to 1599 | 17th and 18th Century Poland 1600 to 1795 |\n\n| Alliance of the Three Black Eagles (Poland Partitioned) 1795 to 1807 | Napoleonic Era and Poland 1807-1824 |\n\n| The Congress of Vienna and its Aftermath 1820-1914 | World War I and the Parliamentary Democracy 1914 to 1926 |\n\n| Second Republic of Poland (Sanacja) 1926 to 1939 | World War II (German and Soviet occupation) 1939 to 1945 |\n\n| People's Polish Republic (Communist regime) 1945 to 1999 | Third Republic of Poland 1999 to present |"
