        "text": "In this guide, we'll give a brief overview of some of the major religious conflicts of the age.\n\nThe key idea is that matters of religion influenced and were influenced by political factors. These religious conflicts often had political interests; political conflicts often mixed religion into them.\n\nAn example of this is how the religious changes sweeping Europe interacted with the existing political tension between the noblitiy and the monarchy. For years, nobility and monarchies did their best to limit the other‚Äôs power. With the rise of religious reforms, many nobles switched to Protestant sects while many monarchies remained devout Catholics. (This was the case in France.) In some countries (read: England) the monarch became Protestant (Anglican) while a large group of nobles remained Catholic.\n\nLet's go by region as we discuss the Wars of Religion.\n\nüé• Watch: AP European History - Martin Luther and Reformation\n\nGerman Religious Conflicts\n\nThe two major religious conflicts you need to know in the area that's roughly modern-day Germany are the and the . The most important thing about the Schmalkaldic Wars is the that concluded them.\n\nGerman Peasants' War (1524‚Äì25)\n\nIn Germany, ‚Äôs ideas influenced German peasants to revolt (German Peasants‚Äô War). Hundreds of thousands of peasants rose up against their land owners to fight for social equality and religious/economic freedom. The violence of these peasants horrified Luther, and he actually supported the aristocrats in putting down the revolt through any means necessary.\n\nSchmalkaldic Wars (1546-47) and the Peace of Augsburg (1555)\n\nIn the (which was neither Holy, nor Roman), the rulers were faced with two problems: an expanding on the East and the rise of Protestantism in the West. In the West, would confront Martin Luther about his at the , but it was much too late. Luther‚Äôs ideas had spread, and there was nothing Charles V could do about it.\n\nThe Habsburg rulers were the largest, most influential family in Europe. You could find them in practically every royal family. They were the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire and devout Catholics. When the German states and the princes under them converted to Protestantism (forming a group known as the ), Charles V (current ruler of the HRE) fought them in the Schmalkaldic Wars before coming to a resolution known as the Peace of Augsburg (1555) . From then on, German princes could choose between Lutheranism and Catholicism only (no Calvinism!)\n\nFrench Religious Conflicts\n\nThe major conflict here is the .\n\nFrench Wars of Religion (1562 - 1598)\n\nIn France, Catholics fought against the Huguenots (another term for French Calvinists). This tension was even prominent in the aristocracy and monarchy. Protestant nobles struggled with a Catholic monarchy, and this discourse rippled down to the lower levels of society before culminating into the St. Bartholomew Day‚Äôs Massacre (1572), a major religious massacre that exacerbated the conflict.\n\nThe French Wars of Religion would eventually result in the War of the Three Henrys. One of those three Henrys, , became . Originally a Protestant, he converted to Catholicism and drafted the , granting rights of religious liberty to the Huguenots\n\nüé• Watch: AP European History - French Wars of Religion\n\n‚ÄúParis is worth a mass.‚Äù\n\nKing Henry IV (Henry III of Navarre)\n\nThe Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648)\n\nThe Thirty Years' War was a major religious conflict that doesn't quite fit in any one region, so it's getting its own catagory.\n\nIn (the equivalent of the present day Czech Republic), the election of a new king would cause a division between Catholics and Protestants. Afraid that the new Catholic king, , would strip away Protestant rights, some Bohemian leaders elected Frederick V, a Protestant.\n\nAlthough it was certain that Ferdinand II would end up on the throne, since he was personally chosen by the previous King, that didn‚Äôt stop Protestant opposition. In fact, the supporters of Frederick V were so peeved, they threw some of Ferdinand II‚Äôs Catholic representatives out of a 69 feet high window! (Miraculously, the representatives lived.) This event, called the Defenestration of Prague (defenestrate = a fancy word for throwing someone out a window), sparked Europe‚Äôs bloodiest religious war, the Thirty Years‚Äô War.\n\nIn the Thirty Years‚Äô War, Denmark, Sweden, and France all exploited the conflict in Bohemia for their own agendas. What started off as a religious war would expand into a political one as Denmark joined on the side of the Protestants to protect religious freedom in his, and other kingdoms, as well as expand his land. Sweden had the same reasons as Denmark for joining, but France, despite being Catholic, joined on the Protestant side due to a rivalry with the Habsburgs. (For more information about the specifics of the war, consult the table below.)\n\nended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia. While the Peace of Augsburg allowed German princes to choose between Lutheranism and Catholicism, the Peace of Westphalia granted the option to choose to other princes, bishops, and local leaders. The peace destroyed any remaining medieval ideas of universal Christianity, and sped up the decline of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War In Detail\n\nüé• Watch: AP European History - Thirty Years' War\n\nManipulative States\n\nCertain countries sought to exploit religion for their own gains. They saw it as a reason (or justification) to achieve national unity or more power. Below, we'll detail some of the ways states used religious turmoil to their advantage.\n\nSpain: The Spanish Inquisition\n\nSpain was the Catholic Church‚Äôs biggest supporter. Ruled by Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, it took this time of religious turmoil to get rid of all the Muslims and Jews in the nation. The Spanish Inquisition sought out any people who weren‚Äôt Catholic and gave them two options: convert or leave.\n\nEngland: Henry VIII Changes The Church\n\nIn England, King Henry VIII faced a dilemma that would forever change the country: how was he going to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, if the Pope wouldn‚Äôt let him? üíî His solution was to leave the Catholic Church and create his own.\n\nThis divorce began the English Reformation, and King Henry became the Supreme Head of the Church of England during this time. ‚ôö After his death, the nation would go through another rapid change back to Catholicism for a short while with Mary I (Bloody Mary!) until the English Reformation returned and culminated with Elizabeth I.\n\nRulers and Consorts of England\n\nThe End of an Era\n\nAs the continent grew bloodier and bloodier, it was clear to everyone that a unified Catholic Europe was no longer possible. Various legal agreements created after conflicts allowed for religious plurality."
