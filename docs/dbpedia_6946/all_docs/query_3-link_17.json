        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe diversity of religions around the world creates challenges for health care providers and systems to provide culturally competent medical care. Cultural competence is the ability of health providers and organizations to deliver health care services that meet the cultural, social, and religious needs of patients and their families. Culturally competent care can improve patient quality and care outcomes. Strategies to move health professionals and systems towards these goals include providing cultural competence training and developing policies and procedures that decrease barriers to providing culturally competent patient care.[1][2][3][4]\n\nConsequences of Cultural Competence Deficiencies\n\nIf providers and health care systems are not working together to provide culturally competent care, patients may have untoward health consequences, receive poor quality care, and be dissatisfied with the care they receive. The quality of patient-health professional interactions is decreased. Lower-quality patient-health professional interactions are associated with decreased satisfaction in the healthcare provider. In fact, African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Muslims report that the quality of their care was diminished because of their ethnicity or race.[5][6][7][8]\n\nWhy should providers and systems be culturally and spiritually sensitive? The Joint Commission (TJC) requires hospitals to be accountable for maintaining patient rights, including accommodation for cultural, religious, and spiritual values. Healthcare professionals and systems must care for patients as whole persons; this includes the body, mind, and spirit.\n\nIt is important for healthcare to include the cultural and spiritual needs of the patient. Healthcare professionals should be empowered with the knowledge and skills to respond to the needs of patients and their families at an intensely stressful time. Institutions that seek or maintain TJC accreditation need to demonstrate expertise in cultural and religious competence.\n\nHealth systems and healthcare providers are developing strategies and techniques to respond to the religious and spiritual needs of patients and families for a number of reasons. One reason is that, in addition to TJC, state and federal guidelines encourage institutional responsiveness to population diversity. These strategies are essential to meeting the federal government's Healthy People goal of eliminating ethnic and racial health disparities.[9][10][11][12]\n\nCulturally Competent Medical Care\n\nPatient's beliefs, behaviors, and values are shaped by factors such as ethnicity, gender, language, mental ability, nationality, occupation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Cultural competence is the provider and systems able to understand and integrate cultural intelligence into the delivery of healthcare. The goal of providing culturally competent health care services is to provide consistent quality of care to every patient, regardless of their cultural, ethnic, racial, or religious background.\n\nStrategies for improving cultural competence in individuals and systems include:\n\nEncouraging family to participate in healthcare decision making.\n\nIncorporating culture-specific values into health promotion\n\nProviding cultural awareness training\n\nProviding an environment that allows traditional healers\n\nProviding interpreter services\n\nRecruiting minority staff\n\nWhen individuals and systems are able to provide a positive environment of cultural competence that meets the religious and spiritual needs of those who are cared for, the outcome for patients improves, and the healthcare system as a whole becomes a more positive environment.\n\nReligion and Healthcare\n\nWhy are religion and spirituality important in healthcare? Religion and spirituality are important factors in the majority of patients seeking care. Unfortunately, health providers may not take religious beliefs into account when they are dealing with difficult medical decisions for patients and their families.\n\nIn the history of man, religious leaders and health providers were often the same. Only within recent times has medicine taken on a scientific approach that has resulted in a separation between medicine and religion.\n\nThe challenge for health professionals is in understanding that patients often turn to their religious and spiritual beliefs when making medical decisions. Religion and spirituality can impact decisions regarding diet, medicines based on animal products, modesty, and the preferred gender of their health providers. Some religions have strict prayer times that may interfere with medical treatment.\n\nHealthcare providers should be respectful of a patient’s religious and spiritual needs. Many patient’s anxieties are reduced when they turn to their faith during healthcare challenges. Because many patients turn to their beliefs when difficult healthcare decisions are made, it is vital for healthcare professionals to recognize and accommodate the patient's religious and spiritual needs. Health professionals should provide an opportunity for patients to discuss their religious and spiritual beliefs and tailor their evaluation and treatment to meet their specific needs.[13][14][15]\n\nIssues of Concern\n\nReligion and spirituality play an important role in the medical decisions of many patients. The following is an alphabetical list of the religious and spiritual groups most commonly encountered in a healthcare environment and a summary of their views. Knowledge of these beliefs can affect patient-provider communication, resulting in more culturally sensitive care and improved quality of treatment and outcomes.[16][17][18][19]\n\nBaha'i\n\nBaha'i teaches the essential worth of all religions and the equality and unity of all people.\n\nBeliefs\n\nAbandonment of all prejudice: race, religion, gender, or community\n\nEducation for all children\n\nAbolition of extreme wealth and poverty\n\nIndividual responsibility to search for the truth\n\nThe oneness of God, the unity of humanity, and the essential harmony of religion\n\nReligion is a divine revelation that is continuous and progressive.\n\nReligion and science exist in harmony.\n\nSexual equality is a spiritual and moral standard.\n\nHumanity's oneness and the wholeness of human relationships\n\nUnity among diverse groups is possible\n\nGod is in every force in the universe.\n\nOne God has a single plan within the teachings of the major world religions.\n\nThe promise of world peace\n\nDeath\n\nAn individual’s reality is spiritual, not physical.\n\nThe body is the throne of the soul, worthy to be treated with honor and respect even when dead.\n\nThe soul is eternal and progresses to the next stage of existence, closer to God.\n\nOrgans may be donated\n\nThe body should be buried, not cremated, preferably without embalming unless required by law.\n\nThe body must not be transported more than one hour’s journey from the place of death.\n\nFor children over 15 years old, the Prayer for the Dead is recited at the burial.\n\nDiet\n\nPatients over age 15 and in good health abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset during the month of Ala (meaning Loftiness) from March 2 through 20.\n\nEating is for health.\n\nAbstain from drugs when health is good, but may take them when necessary, including narcotic pain medicines, if prescribed by a clinician.\n\nBlood transfusion is acceptable.\n\nConsumption of alcohol and mind-altering drugs is forbidden.\n\nHoly Tenets\n\nDaily prayer and reading of sacred writings.\n\nSeven Holy Day festivals per year during which one does not go to school or work.\n\nWork performed in the spirit of service is the highest form of worship.\n\nPregnancy\n\nCircumcision of males is a family decision.\n\nDo not believe in abortion.\n\nNo requirements; rarely use birth control.\n\nSexual intercourse only between husband and wife.\n\nRituals\n\nDaily private prayer and annual fast lasting throughout the day from sunrise to sunset during the month of Ala from March 2 through March 20.\n\nSymbols and Rites\n\nThe nine-pointed star is the symbol of the faith.\n\nLocal, national, and international representatives perform special religious rituals.\n\nPrayers for private worship.\n\nClinical Issues\n\nAvoid sterilization procedures unless needed for the preservation of the mother.\n\nBelieve prayer assists in healing; allow uninterrupted time for prayer.\n\nBelieve a balanced and nutritious diet helps prevent disease.\n\nBlood transfusion acceptable.\n\nWill most likely avoid birth control.\n\nBuddhism\n\nBuddhism encompasses a variety of beliefs, spiritual practices, and traditions based on original teachings attributed to the Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha.\n\nBeliefs\n\nBuddhists follow the path to enlightenment by developing his or her wisdom, morals, and meditation.\n\nPersonal insight replaces belief in God with the study of the laws of cause and effect, karma.\n\nSpiritual enlightenment through conscious living and meditation.\n\nRebirth is based upon the actions of a person, and insight and the extinguishing of desire bring freedom.\n\nThree major Buddhist traditions: Mahayana, Theravada, and Tibetan.\n\n5 Lay Vows: no intentional killing, no stealing, no lying, no sexual misconduct, and no intoxicants.\n\nDeath\n\nAvoid mind-altering medication while dying.\n\nBuddhist representatives should be notified in advance to see that the appropriate person presides over the care.\n\nChanting and prayers.\n\nRebirth in the next life and avoid lower lifeforms of rebirth.\n\nThe state of mind at death influences rebirth, so they want to be calm and peaceful.\n\nUnexpected death may require special rituals.\n\nDiet\n\nUsually vegetarian\n\nAvoid alcohol, coffee, and tobacco.\n\nHealth\n\nDo not believe in healing through faith.\n\nHealing and recovery are by awakening to the wisdom of Buddha.\n\nHealth is holistic; mental cures are important.\n\nIllness is a result of karma or the law of cause and effect, an inevitable consequence of actions in a prior life or this life.\n\nMedications are acceptable if they do not affect the state of mind.\n\nNo restrictions on autopsy, blood or blood products, organ donation, or procedures.\n\nHoly Tenets\n\nCelebrations are common to all Buddhists.\n\nDaily chanting or meditation according to the form of Buddhism.\n\nPregnancy\n\nArtificial insemination and birth control are acceptable.\n\nBuddhists do not condone taking a life.\n\nRituals\n\nCeremony around baby blessings, marriage, and death.\n\nMonthly atonement ceremony on the full moon.\n\nSymbols and Rites\n\nLotus flower, human life;

An autopsy may be sought in cases of sudden decease.\n\nThere is no church policy on euthanasia, but Christian Scientists revere life and strive to overcome and heal suicidal tendencies.\n\nThere is no church policy on organ donations, blood donations, or transfusions.\n\nDiet\n\nAvoid tobacco and food or drink which contains alcohol and sometimes caffeine.\n\nHealth\n\nThe church does not dictate individual health care choices.\n\nChristian Scientists generally choose spiritual means for preventing and healing disease.\n\nChristian Science practitioners offer spiritual healing support. They would not interfere in matters of specific medical treatment. Christian Science nurses provide practical non-medical care when only spiritual treatment is relied upon.\n\nIf brought to a medical provider involuntarily, adherents may wish to choose to rely solely on spiritual means for healing. But they are free to decide.\n\nOnce subject to medical care, they would not normally second-guess medical expertise.\n\nThey may prefer minimal intervention where it is an option.\n\nHoly Tenets\n\nScience and Health with Key to the Scriptures, by church founder Mary Baker Eddy, is the definitive statement of Christian Science teachings. This book includes six religious tenets or key points of Christian Science, summarized in 1894 by a Chicago journalist in the Daily Inter-Ocean: “The ‘confession of faith’ [of Christian Science] includes the declaration that the Scriptures are the guide to eternal Life; that there is a Supreme Being, and His Son, and the Holy Ghost, and that man is made in His image. It affirms the atonement; it recognizes Jesus as the teacher and guide to salvation; the forgiveness of sin by God, and affirms the power of Truth over error, and the need of living faith at the moment to realize the possibilities of the divine Life.” The final Tenet, not represented in this summary, takes the form of a sacred Christian commitment: “And we solemnly promise to watch, and pray for that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to do unto others as we would have them do unto us; and to be merciful, just, and pure.” (SH p. 497)\n\nRituals\n\nChurch services are simple and Bible-centered.\n\nPatients might appreciate access to online resources such as church services, weekly topical Bible lessons, or church periodicals.\n\nMembers typically pray and study the Bible and other religious teachings daily.\n\nNo traditional ritual sacraments, though there is a simple communion service and a special Thanksgiving Day service.\n\nChristmas and Easter have deep spiritual meaning to Christian Scientists. Most Christian Scientists celebrate a traditional Christmas holiday.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe Bible is central to Christian Science. It is interpreted in the Christian Science textbook, Science, and Health, the authoritative guide for adherents.\n\nLay readers conduct church services. There is no clergy.\n\nClinical Significance\n\nChristian Scientists and their children have often availed themselves of religious belief accommodations for vaccination, but the choice is individual, and members are encouraged to comply with applicable public health laws (including vaccination and quarantines where required). They are taught not to fear vaccines.\n\nUsually do not seek immediate medical care.\n\nThey may prefer no, or minimal, medical intervention and drugs\n\nduring pregnancy, labor, and birth – and they may request a midwife. Abortions are likely not favored. But church policy does not dictate any of this, nor does it cover birth control.\n\nMedical professionals will want to be sensitive to members’ preference against too much description of the severity, dangerousness, and fixed reality of the disorders or traumas treated – including matters of mental health.\n\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon)\n\nMormons are a religious group of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity, initiated by Joseph Smith.

Religion often provides spiritual guidance as well as an emphasis on maintaining health. Religious beliefs often affect patient attitudes and behavior. It is important for healthcare professionals to have an understanding of these issues so they can provide culturally appropriate care. It is important to remember that preservation of life overrides guidelines; in a life-threatening situation, there are usually no restrictions on medications or surgical interventions. When caring for a patient, it is important to understand why adherence or non-adherence to treatment may occur given their religious beliefs.[20][21][22]\n\nEnhancing cultural competency by providing patient-centered care is the means by which healthcare challenges are ameliorated. Efforts aimed to improve provider-level cultural enhanced care will go a long way to facilitate cross-cultural communication and respond to patient needs by tailoring healthcare.\n\nUnderstanding the values and reasons for special requests for healthcare will improve cultural competence and provide culturally sensitive health care that is good for the patient and their families.\n\nThe culture and religion of an individual can greatly influence their perspectives about healthcare and healthcare providers. Healthcare providers need knowledge and understanding of these patients’ backgrounds and beliefs to provide culturally sensitive healthcare.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nApologize for cultural mistakes\n\nAsk the patient and family how you can help make their experience more comfortable.\n\nAvoid being judgmental\n\nAvoid making assumptions and be patient.\n\nAvoid employees serving as interpreters for other employees.\n\nBe aware of the uniqueness of their religion and their special needs.\n\nBe respectful\n\nObserve body and facial language\n\nRecognize how values, behaviors, and beliefs may affect others\n\nTrain staff about cultural competence\n\nUse medically competent and fluent interpreters with training in cultural competence.\n\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nHealthcare organizations need to empower their clinical staff with a sense of awareness through education and training on the world's religions and their potential impact on patient care. Provider education makes possible a respectful dialog with their patients about their religion and the impact it has on evaluation and treatment.\n\nReligion and spirituality should be incorporated into the healthcare practitioner’s armamentarium of knowledge in communicating with patients. Listening to a patient’s beliefs along with how those beliefs are tied to the patient’s health can help build and positive relationship between the health practitioner and patient. Knowledge of religious and spiritual beliefs and practices can result in decreased medical errors, earlier patient release, and reliable communication between patient and healthcare provider that results in improved healthcare delivery.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nLeDoux J, Mann C, Demoratz M, Young J.
