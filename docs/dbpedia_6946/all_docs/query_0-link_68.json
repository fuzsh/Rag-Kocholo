        "text": "The introduction of national flags constitutes markers of nation building in the modern period and reflects political change. The national flag appears as a symbol for mass-participating nations that emerged with new notions of citizenship and ‘oneness’ after the course of 1789. Some flags survived from pre-modern times and were transformed into national flags as they were adopted by nations without states and states without nations. Elites in pursuit of power have played an essential role in the selection process throughout history. In this chapter we explore the reasons why flags became attached to nations and explain why some flag designs survived over time and others did not. Flag-related symbolism will be explored with reference to the latter part of the Middle Ages (1100–1500) to the early modern period (1500–1800) up to the modern period from 1800 onwards. The flags of Britain, France and Norway are discussed in detail as they represent different nation-building processes ref...\n\nThe paper aims to explore the question of the cult of the national flag from a few selected angles. I focus in particular on the magical dimension of the national flag. My argument is that the central position of the flag in nationalism has much do to with a magical mode of thinking. However, this type of thinking cannot simply be regarded as the legacy of so-called primitive or preindustrial societies. On the contrary, I will argue that national flags are modern phenomena. The magic of the flag causes some people to behave as if the flag constituted an integral part of the nation. Damage of the flag is feared as desacralization, which may have direct consequences for the nation and threatens its existence. The magic of the flag is based on the confusion of two ontological domains: symbolic-metaphorical and metonymical-causal.\n\nThe central themes of this thesis are to highlight the importance of national symbols and ceremonies in the formation of nations and national identities, and examine how they contribute to the expressions of nationhood. The research has been conducted by means of a systematic investigation of national symbols and ceremonies, analysed as an integral part of identity-making, maintenance and change. The focus is on the contemporary European nations, and conclusions have been drawn with regard to their symbolism and ceremonies. The overall study has been complemented by three case studies; of Britain, France, Norway, with Germany as an analytical counter-case. Throughout this thesis evidence will be provided to the effect that national symbols and ceremonies express deeper aspects and meanings of the nation, and function as integrative and/or divisive forces. Moreover, national symbols and ceremonies form a central part of a `secular&#39; religion which provides anchorage in a dynamic w..."
