        "text": "Hello. I just want to share some current (APR.2024) thoughts about the Revolution mechanic for Europeans.\n\nSince we have introduced a large number of European maps and minor civs in the last European DLC, this time we can spend development costs on reforming and enriching the content of the Revolution mechanic. In the upcoming DLC ​​for Danes and Poles, I hope to see something new for it. The Revolution nations are another “fifth age” in my opinion, so I’d like to see each civ have as same as 5 options fairly, just like each civ has the same number of politicians.\n\nAs for the options, some existing would be removed from the current civs for reasons:\n\nThe Portuguese had never ruled or controlled Spanish colonies like Peru and Gran Colombia through the Iberian Union.\n\nRussia and Britain seemed to only intervene in the war in Hungary and Haiti respectively without controlling and ruling them.\n\nThe U.S. is shared by too many civs, and the Italians were the latest immigrants to the U.S. than other civs.\n\nThe availability of Argentina to the Germans seems to have been founded solely on the exploration of a German explorer under Pedro de Mendoza, without any settlement or ruling.\n\nAlso, some existing would be added to the current civs and the future civs:\n\nThe Mexican people rebelled against the Second Mexican Empire established by the French, so Mexico could be available to French.\n\nBased on the intervention and control of Transylvania and Moldavia by Habsburg Austria and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Romania could be available to Germans and Poles.\n\nNot only the short-lived Union in the 15th century, but also the large number of Hungarians who immigrated to Polish towns until participateing in the Hungarian revolution, Hungary could be available to Poles.\n\nThen let’s talk about new stuff.\n\nWe know that an option that can serve multiple civs have development advantages. But I also think that options unique to a civ can still be developed through existing assets to save costs, and it will help maintain balance and become a unique feature of that civ. Therefore I’m not just going to list some of the potrntial options that can be shared, but still to propose at most one unique new revolution option for some civs, so that they can have it just like the French, Spanish, and Ottomans, even though it might be not necessary.\n\nSome good potential new options that can be shared with multiple civ\n\nBelgium\n\nAvailable to Dutch and Germans, based on the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and the Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands.\n\nRemoves the Flemish Revolution card and the Belgian Revolution card for Dutch.\n\nTurns Merchants and Settlers to Revolutionary, Settler Wagons to Hussars.\n\nShips Veteran Cuirassiers and enable them and Veteran Crossbowmen.\n\nGuard Skirmishers and Prussian Needle Gunners can be replaced with Voltigeurs.\n\nA card named Flemish Movement could ship more Revolutionaries and improve Revolutionaries, Halbediers and Ruyters.\n\nA card named Walloon Movement could ship some Walloon Guards (Fusiliers with regeneration ability) and enable them.\n\nCould have French cards and shipments like Thoroughbreds, Griveubal System, and French Royal Army.\n\nCertain units could have the French dialogue instead, and then other units could have the Dutch dialogue instead if the civ is the Germans.\n\nCeylon\n\nAvailable to British and Portuguese, based on the Kingdom of Kandy against the Portuguese Ceylon and later the British Ceylon.\n\nPotential unique units and renamed units: Dunuvaya, Lascarin, Bondikula Soldier, Kodithuwakkuwa Gun.\n\nThe Dunuvaya (lit. “archer” in Sinhalese) can be an unique Sinhalese archer unit.\n\nThe Lascarin could be a variant of Musketeer or Askari.\n\nThe Bondikula Soldier could be an unique Sinhalese rifleman unit.\n\nThe Kodithuwakkuwa Gun could be a variant of Infantry Gun.\n\nShould able to access elephant units, especially Flail Elephants.\n\nCould have cards about the Dutch supports and Tamil units shipments.\n\nIn theory it should also be available to the Dutch due to the Dutch Ceylon, but this would leave too many of the same options for the Dutch and Portuguese, and the conflict would seem less intense during the Dutch period than during the Portuguese and British periods.\n\nCossack Hetmanate\n\nAvailable to Russians and Poles, based on the Khmelnytsky Uprising.\n\nApparently Cossacks can get special enhancements or upgrades.\n\nIf the Polish civ couldn’t train Cossacks, now they can.\n\nI’m not really familiar with them, but I’ve heard that the Don Cossacks were mostly cavalry and the Zaporozhian Cossacks were mostly infantry and used war wagons, so that might be worth a look.\n\nGreece\n\nMake the Greek Revolution not just a big button but a real revolutionary option.\n\nAvailable to Ottomans and Italians, based on the Greek War of Independence and the Venetian colonies in Ionia.\n\nApparently uses the assets of the House of Phanar.\n\nGood at naval battles.\n\nCould have cards about the British, French, Russian supports.\n\nJamaica\n\nBasically just a simple variant of Haiti, only changing the flag and the names of the revolution and the Homecity.\n\nAvailable only to British, based on the Jamaican Maroon War.\n\nThis flag was designed in the 20th century, but the flag of British Colony of Jamaica doesn’t feel right.\n\nWest Indies\n\nBasically just a simple variant of Haiti too, only changing the flag and the names of the revolution and the Homecity.\n\nAvailable only to Danes, based on the slave insurrection on St. John in 1733.\n\nThe flag might have to be fictionally designed.\n\nLivonia\n\nAvailable for Russians, Swedes, Danes and Poles.\n\nCould have some unique units based on Latvians and Estonians, though I’m not sure what they would be.\n\nCould have cards about the overseas colonization of Courland.\n\nThis flag is Courland, as I don’t know which flag exactly represents Livonia in the game’s timeline.\n\nLivonia might theoretically serve Germans given its origins, but they were not part of the Holy Roman Empire and I think that’s too much.\n\nNorway\n\nAvailable to Swedes and Danes, based on the Denmark-Norway, the Kingdom of Norway (1814) and the Sweden–Norway.\n\nProbably a revolution with a good economy (especially wood and coins) and a good navy.\n\nI picked the flag of Kingdom of Norway (1814), but maybe the current flag of Norway could also work since it was designed in 1821.\n\nPoland\n\nAvailable to Germans and Russians, based on the Porish uprisings, especially the Kościuszko Uprising.\n\nUses the assets of the future Polish civ.\n\nThere could be cards about the Napoleonic Freach and Hungarian supports.\n\nLithuania\n\nBasically just a simple variant of Poland, only changing the flag and the names of the revolution and the Homecity.\n\nAvailable only to Swedes, based on the rebellions in the Swedish Lithuania in 1656.\n\nSomalia\n\nAvailable to Portuguese and Italians, based on the Somali–Portuguese conflicts in the 16th century and the Banadir resistance in the 19th century, especially .\n\nUses the assets of the Ethiopian civ, the Somali minor civ, and Sudanese minor civ.\n\nCould also reuse the Ethiopian and Somali assets of the Historical Battle, such like this flag.\n\nSweden\n\nAvailable to Danes and Poles, based on Sweden’s independence from the Kalmar Union and the Polish–Swedish union.\n\nAppareantly could use the existing assest of the Swedish civ, just like the Texas revolurion uses the assets of the U.S. civ.\n\nSome potential options I recommend that is unique to a civ\n\nHolstein\n\nAvailable only to Danes, based on the Schleswig–Holstein question.\n\nAparently could use the existing assets of the German civ, for example you could receive Uhlans for every shipments.\n\nA possible problem is that it was not pursuing independence but joining Prussia, but this does not affect its presentation in the game.\n\nIceland\n\nAvailable only to Danes, based on the activity of Jørgen Jørgensen and the Icelandic independence movement from the mid-19th century onwards.\n\nSimilar to Canada, it could be a milder revolution that does not turn Settlers into Revolutionaries.\n\nCould ship a hero unit named Höfuðsmaður, or Hedman, as the militia leader based on the military history of Iceland, and have a military that featured halberds.\n\nIreland\n\nAvailable only to British, based on the Irish Rebellion of 1798.\n\nPotential unique units and renamed units: Croppy, Wexford Priest, Defender.\n\nThe Croppy could be an unique Irish pikemen unit.\n\nThe Wexford Priest could be a modified Padre (hero), based on John Murphy.\n\nThe Defender could be an variant of Irish Brigadier.\n\nA card named Ribbonism could rename Defenders to Ribbonmen and improve them.\n\nThere could be cards about the French and Spanish supports.\n\nItaly\n\nAvailable only to Germans, based on the revolutions that took place in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia in 1848.\n\nAparently could use the existing assets of the Italian civ, for example you could build a Basilica and Lombards.\n\nNdongo\n\nAvailable only to Portuguese, based on the Kingdom of Ndongo against Portuguese.\n\nCould use the assets of the potential Kongolese civ.\n\nCould have cards about the Dutch supports.\n\nThe flag might have to be fictionally designed.\n\nTungning\n\nAvailable only to Dutch, based on the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion and the Kingdom of Tungning.\n\nShips Iron Troops and Rattun Shields, and enables them and Ronins and Wokou units.\n\nAparently could use the existing assets of the Chinese civ, for example:\n\nTurns Merchants to Chinese Rebels (the renamed Javanese Spearmen), Church to Monastery, Explorer to Koxinga (hero), Pikemen to Qiang Pikemen, Halbediers to Changdao Swordsmen, Skirmishers to Arquebusiers, Hussars to Iron Flail, and Ruyters to Keshiks.\n\nThe Barracks now train and upgrade Chu Ko Nu, Qiang Pikemen, Changdao Swordsmen and Arquebusiers instead.\n\nThe Stables now train and upgrade Steppe Riders, Keshiks, Iron Flails and Meteor Hammers instead.\n\nThe Docks now train and upgrade War Junks, Fire Junks and Fu-ship instead.\n\nThe artillery units now are operated by Chinese crew, or changed to have the British dialogue instead.\n\nCards about the British trades, potential Formosan natives, renegade German mercenaries and renegade Dutch African soldiers (Akan Ankobias).\n\nThe homecity could use the treasure ship homecity from the Chinese campaign.\n\nThis is my selfish and dirty recommendation, because I am Taiwanese and I hope to mention even a little bit of Taiwanese history in the game.\n\nThese options are based on not only my own thoughts but also opinions in the forum. In this way the whole thing will look like this.\n\nBritish: Canada, Ceylon, Jamaica (Haiti), S.Africa, U.S. (Potential unique: Ireland.)\n\nDutch: Belgium, Brazil, Indonesia, S.Africa, U.S. (Potential unique: Tungning.)\n\nFrench: Canada, Haiti, Mexico, Revolutionary France, U.S.\n\nGermans: Belgium, Gran Colombia, Hungary, Poland, Romania. (Potential unique: Italy.)\n\nItalians: Argentina, Barbary, Brazil, Greece, Somalia.\n\nOttomans: Barbary, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, Romania.\n\nPortuguese: Ceylon, Barbary, Brazil, Indonesia, Somalia. (Potential unique: Ndongo.)\n\nRussians: Cossack Hetmanate, Finland, Livonia, Poland, Romania.\n\nSpanish: Argentina, Chile, Gran Colombia, Mexico, Peru.\n\nSwedes: Finland, Lithuania (Poland), Livonia, Norway, U.S.\n\nPoles: Cossack Hetmanate, Hungary, Livonia, Romania, Sweden.\n\nDanes: Livonia, Norway, Sweden, West Indies (Haiti). (Potential unique: Iceland, Holstein.)\n\nIf we pursue making an option can be available to multiple civs as possible, we don’t have to introduce new unique options other than the ones available to the Danes. The Danes would have to choose at least one of the 2 unique options to reach 5.\n\nAs for the Maltese, I’d like to replace the revolution mechanic with something else.\n\nAllowing them to choose one of the 5 great powers, Britain, France, Naples (Italy), Spain and Russia, and become a protectorate.\n\nThese options would make heavy use of existing assets from the British, French, Italians, Spanish and Russians, like shipping Redcoats, Voltigeurs, Papal Lancers, Espadachins or Dvoryanins and having a lot of cards from that civ.\n\nPirate Republic was a theme I also considered but I ultimately gave up on it, since the problem that Haiti is not suitable for British can be avoided by simply changing the flag and name to Jamaica without changing the content, and I prefer introducing brand new options rather than splitting up content from old ones. I think Ceylon, Mexico, Belgium are cooler and they can share them with other civs.\n\nI make Jamaica a simple variant of Haiti to replace Haiti for the British now so it was no longer given to the British with just meaning a pirate revolution. The tech tree of Haiti could certainly use some less piracy elements, but I also know that is because the devs believe that the Tortuga of Haiti was once a pirate base and this kind of design is in line with their usual practice.\n\nI’m not sure if you want to emphasize the Scottish element or the Jacobite element .\n\nI can accept a Scottish revolution option, just as I support an Irish one, but I don’t support a Jacobite revolution. The latter was just a struggle between different political lines, ideologies and rulers inside the country, which would not even change the flag of the civ, and its influence was far less than that of the French Revolution.\n\nShould already be in the game:\n\nGreece\n\nUkraine/Cossack\n\nGreece is badly needed to replace Italy and Malta’s terrible revolution options and Ukraine is a must once Poland is in.\n\nNice to have:\n\nBelgium\n\nNorway (including Iceland)\n\nLivonia\n\nIreland\n\nSolid options, but Europe is already extensively covered so I could take it or leave it with these ones.\n\nIs a civ or should be a civ:\n\nPoland/Lithuania\n\nItaly\n\nSweden\n\nSomalia\n\nKongo\n\nCeylon\n\nIt just feels wrong to revolt into an already existing main civ. Yeah that happens with USA and Mexico, but they were the quintessential revolutions long before being full civs. Them being full civs is what’s out of place. Doing this would also be opening up a can of worms, since everyone and anyone revolted at one time or another. Dutch should revolt from Germans, Portuguese from Spanish, almost everyone from France, etc.\n\nShould never be a revolution:\n\nHolstein\n\nMinor border regions are not at all appropriate for revolutions. Otherwise every single rebellion in Europe and beyond is going to be on the table. The only exception to this would be Corsica which actually had a fairly impactful revolution.\n\nMissing:\n\nPirate Republic (Jamaica could be fun but this would be more broadly applicable)\n\nNorthwest Confederacy (could provide an avenue for North American natives to get advanced technology in a way that makes sense)\n\nAustralia\n\nTaiping Heavenly Kingdom (Could go along with Tungning to have multiple Chinese revolutions)\n\nTatars (central Asians rebelled against Russia many times)\n\nArabs (Trucial States or Wahhabis)\n\nScotland\n\nSerbia\n\nBohemia\n\nSokoto Caliphate\n\nZanzibar\n\nLiberia (both Zanzibar and Liberia can represent colonial outposts without displacing what should be proper African civs)\n\nExisting Revolutions\n\nThere’s definitely a lot of revolutions that could be shifted around. France could have Mexico or Chile, Portugal could have Canada, etc. Italy should not have USA, Malta shouldn’t have Hungary, and British should not have Haiti. I do think Argentina is a good fit for Germans. They did have quite significant German immigration and will always have an infamous connection to Germany even if that mostly comes later.\n\nThese are your limitations not mine, even though I can understand. I do see that they could serve the civs well, especially one like Danes which is relatively lacking in potential options. I do think the Dutch and Portuguese could be available to Spanish and so on, but Germans, Spain and French has enough options available so I haven’t touched them for this reason.\n\nI think Ceylon and Somalia are difficult to become a civ. I wouldn’t consider them to be in this class.\n\nIt was entirely designed to serve the Danes’ lack of options.\n\nIt has been mentioned as an potential option by not only me but also others.\n\nIf you can accept Sweden available to Danes, then you can choose Iceland instead of Holstein and get to 5 options for the civ.\n\nI’ve already explained my thoughts on it so I don’t want to say too much more.\n\nOverall I’d rather have new options and update the existing one than split the existing one into two.\n\nAfter having Jamaica instead of Haiti, I want Ceylon or Ireland instead of Pirates for British.\n\nI want Mexican instead of Pirates for French.\n\nI want Belgium or Tungning instead of Pirates for Dutch.\n\nPut aside the Mexicans’ own special revolutionary mechanic, the Revolution mechanic here we talk about is exclusive to European civs.\n\nI don’t think it should be given to non-European civs, just as I wouldn’t give livestock markets to non-African civs.\n\nFor the non-European civs, you can have cards with revolutionary effects, just like Bear Flag Revolt. But that is not I try to discuss in this topic.\n\nI had previously suggested Kazakhstan as a unique option available only to the Russians for much the same reasons, and at that time I remember you being against it.\n\nAt the time you also criticized my suggestion and said that options should be shared across multiple civs as much as possible, so this time I pretty much designed a list that allows all options to be shared except for one Danish option. Then, you now list a lot here that can only serve one civ.\n\nThis is where the game isn’t a textbook.\n\nThis revolutionary option mainly symbolizes the resistance of the Han people and Taiwanese aborigines against the Dutch rulers. To some extent, Tungning is just a suitable placeholder for the name of this option.\n\nWe can still choose Belgium as the 5th options for the Dutch then no slot for Tungning.\n\nBut anyway, the people who participated in Guo Huaiyi’s rebellion are the same group who joined Koxinga and betrayed the Dutch, so I would think they have no problem. If you are very attached to such causal relationships, then many of the options and potential options will be difficult too.\n\nThis is more or less the state of things already. Giving a definition of revolutions that is this loose is going to result in a wildly inconsistent application and justification for revolutions.\n\nSomalia is an extremely strong civ candidate. There were many powerful Somali sultanates such as Adal and Ajuuraan that were conquering Ethiopia and fighting the Portuguese. Ceylon/Kandy is a bit weaker option, but it persisted as an independent state until the British conquered it in the early 1800s. It would also be a good way to get another civ from the Indian subcontinent without having to split India. And they have some cool looking weapons like below:\n\nBondikula\n\nKodithuwakkuwa\n\nWhat lack of options? Norway and Livonia are very solid options for them and Liberia or Iceland could be a third/fourth. You could even give them a Pirate Republic option based on their Caribbean holdings and Baltic pirates. Currently Sweden only has 2 revolutions available, so 2-3 is enough. Holstein is just an incredibly poor option since they never revolted or had a separate ethnic identity. You might as well give the Danes a German Revolution since all the controversy over the territory was a manufactured casus belli for a German invasion.\n\nAnd that’s your opinion. Giving the natives a realistic option for advanced but somewhat more generic units like artillery would be a much better way to fix their late game deficiencies rather than doing that with nonsense such as Captured Mortars.\n\nKazakhs were not conquered by the Russians until very late and should be their own civ. A Tatar revolution would be more representative of rebellion in regions like Kazan or Crimea.\n\nFair enough, I didn’t realize you were constraining it mostly to shared revolutions. But of the ones I’ve suggested, only Scotland and Taiping Heavenly Kingdom are specific to a single civ. There are some single civ options like the French Revolution that are iconic enough to include, and I think these could meet that criteria.\n\nI know what you mentioned about them and they were already included in my original post. You may not have read carefully before mentioning them to me again.\n\nWhen I say I think they’d be hard to become a civilization, it’s not because I think they don’t have enough historical references or cool cultural features. Since the current situation is that we still have a lot of new civs that have better consensus and are more well-known that haven’t been introduced yet, and we may not even be able to get them all before the game is no longer supported, then I won’t consider the possibility of someone else being a civ. To me, it’s unrealistic to deny them more opportunities to appear in the game for the sake of their tiny possibility of becoming a civ.\n\nYou haven’t read my post and you don’t understand my premise.\n\nI have already stated that all this is based on my pursuit that every civ should have 5 options fairly.\n\nIf you don’t understand this, we don’t have to discuss anymore.\n\nAre you aware that you are hijacking this topic and taking its purpose to other issues?\n\nThis subject of mine deals exclusively with European revolutions. I mentioned this at the very beginning of the original article.\n\nHere I don’t care about other civs. You here pour out your thoughts without reading my thoughts carefully, and those thoughts of yours have nothing to do with my topic, which makes me a little annoyed.\n\n“We must strongly resist to do anything to make it more likely that they will be included in the game just because they have a chance (1%) of becoming their own civilization.”\n\nMany of your arguments seem to be based on this IMHO selfish and unrealistic starting point."
