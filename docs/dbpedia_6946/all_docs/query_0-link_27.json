        "text": "Battle of Wittstock, (Oct. 4, 1636), military engagement of the Thirty Years’ War, the greatest victory of the Swedish general Johan Banér, pupil of Gustavus II Adolphus. The battle took place at a time when the Swedish army in Germany desperately needed a victory to improve the prospects of the Protestant cause after the overwhelming defeat at Nördlingen in 1634.\n\nIn the fall of 1636, Banér, with about 18,000 men, sought a battle. An imperial-Saxon army of about 25,000 men took up a position on wooded hills south of Wittstock, 58 miles (93 km) northwest of Berlin. Banér boldly sent about half of his force on a 7-mile (11-kilometre) march, in a wide encircling maneuver to the enemy’s rear, while he led the other half to seize and hold a hill in front of the enemy’s position. Although outnumbered by 50 squadrons to 17, the Swedish cavalry held off the imperial forces’ attacks from 3:00 pm to sunset. Banér’s front was on the point of being overrun at 6:00 pm, when his flanking forces arrived to attack the imperial-Saxon army from their rear and flank. Attacked from three sides, they soon collapsed and fled in panic. Contrary to the practice of the time, the pursuit was vigorously pushed the next day. When it ceased, the remains of the imperial army were unfit for action."
