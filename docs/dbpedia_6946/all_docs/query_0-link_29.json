        "text": "Great Britain, together with Spain, is one of the largest empires on the Earth. Despite few unsuccessful attempts to establish colonies in the Americas, in the early seventeenth century the first successful colonies were finally settled on the Chesapeake Bay and gave birth to a new nation a century and a half later. Further colonial settlements were established on Bermuda, Barbados and Jamaica islands. Colonial government is present on Jamaica island. New Captains start their journey from Kingston / Port Royal, Jamaica.\n\nFrance has established a large colonial empire in the Americas, comparable to its main rivals in the region.

Colonial government is present on Martinique and nearby islands. New Captains start their journey from Fort-Royal, Martinique.\n\nSpain is one of the largest empires both in the Old and New Worlds.

During the following centuries more and more territories in the Americas fell under the control of Spanish Crown. Colonial government is present in the northern part of Cuba. New Captains start their journey from Havana, Cuba.\n\nThe United Provinces of the Netherlands established control over world trade after the independence from Spain and started to form its own colonial empire, although not as large one as English or Spanish ones. Overseas territories in the Americas are mostly located on the Lesser Antilles and South America coast, and controlled by the officials from the Island of Curacao. New Captains start their journey from Willemstad, Curacao.\n\nPiracy in the Americas originated shortly after discovery of the New World.

The most fortified cities are located on the island of Inagua in The Bahamas. New Captains start their journey from Mortimer Town, Inagua.\n\nDenmark-Norway tried to settle a colony in the Americas in the early seventeenth century, but, unfortunately, due to wars in Europe these attempts were not successful. Only about 50 years after that, in 1672, Denmark-Norway eventually established the first colony on one of the Virgin Islands and later proceeded on nearby islands. New Captains start their journey from Christiansted, Virgin Islands.\n\nSettlers from Sweden established the first colonies in the Americas along the Delaware River - so called New Sweden - in the first part of the seventeenth century. More than a century after that, in 1784 year, France sold Saint Barthelemy island to Sweden, so Swedish colonies were also established on the Lesser Antilles. New Captains start their journey from Gustavia, Saint Barthelemy.\n\nThe United States of America is the first country to proclaim its independence from the metropolis in the Americas. Once the Revolutionary War was over and the country was recognized in the whole world, American settlers started to expand towards the western part of North America. Meanwhile naval presence was also vital for the young nation and ports in North and South Carolina played a significant role in trading with the Old World. New Captains start their journey from Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nRussian Empire established overseas territory in the New World in a special way.

The most southward colony of Russian Empire was established in the Northern California area. New Captains start their journey from Shroud Cay - a free port accepting all emigrants from the Old World.\n\nGermans from the Holy Roman Empire began to colonize the Americas in the first half of the sixteenth century and controlled a large overseas territory around the Maracaibo lake since 1534 - so called Little Venice. A century and a half later, in 1685, Brandenburg also settled some colonies in the Virgin Islands. New Captains start their journey from Shroud Cay - a free port accepting all emigrants from the Old World.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Poland is one of the main land forces in Europe far from the routes of the New World, however during the seventeenth century Commonwealth of Poland established a few overseas colonies on Trinidad and Tobago islands through its vassal - Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. New Captains start their journey from Shroud Cay - a free port accepting all emigrants from the Old World.\n\nTrade connections between China and Europe were significantly increased in the second half of the eighteenth century and it led to a few immigrant waves from China to the Americas, mostly on Trinidad island and nearby coast of South America. People were tempted to see the New World and amass a fortune there. New Captains start their journey from Shroud Cay - a free port accepting all emigrants from the Old World."
