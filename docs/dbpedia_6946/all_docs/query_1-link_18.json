        "text": "The Maltese archipelago has a history of colonial control spanning centuries.\n\nLocated south of the Italian island of Sicily between Europe and North Africa, the islands have been occupied by Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, the Knights of Malta, and latterly France and Britain.\n\nIndependence from Britain was achieved in 1964, after the Maltese people were awarded the George Cross for defending the crucial military bases there during World War Two.\n\nOver the centuries, Malta's strategic position has fostered its development as an important trading post, and it remains a leading centre for container and freight transhipment.\n\nMalta is a popular holiday destination, and tourism is the nation's main source of income.\n\nRobert Abela took over as prime minister and Labour Party leader in January 2020, when his predecessor Joseph Muscat resigned in the fallout from the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\n\nIn March 2022, the ruling Labour party, led by Abela, won its third successive election.\n\nMuscat had been credited with boosting Malta's economy, but criticised for failing to rein in the corruption that Ms Caruana Galizia was investigating when she was killed by a car bomb in 2017.\n\nMuscat's handling of the murder inquiry caused widespread anger and he was accused of protecting allies implicated in the investigation, which he denies.\n\nSome key dates in Malta's history:\n\n5200BC - Arrival of European Neolithic settlers, mainly from Sicily. A significant prehistoric Neolithic culture emerges marked by the building of Megalithic temples such as Gigantija, Hagar Qim, Mnajdra and Ta Hagrat between 3600-2500BC.\n\n800-700BC - Phoenicians and subsequently their successors the Carthaginians colonise the islands, using the archipelago as a base from which to expand their trade across the Mediterranean.\n\n216BC - Rome conquers the islands, which then become part of the Roman empire from 1st-4th Centuries.\n\n4th-9th Centuries - Islands under Byzantine rule.\n\n870-1091 - Arab invasion and occupation of the islands.\n\n1091 - Normans conquer the islands, which then become part of the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\n1530 - Holy Roman Emperor Charles V gives the islands to the Order of Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in perpetual lease - in return for an annual fee of one Maltese falcon.\n\n1551 - Unsuccessful Ottoman attempt to invade Malta\n\n1565 - Great Siege of Malta: the climax of an escalating contest during the 16th Century between allied Christian states and and the Islamic Ottoman Empire for control of the Mediterranean. The Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, sends a 40,000-strong force to besiege the outnumbered defenders on Malta. The four-month attempt ends in failure for the Ottomans.\n\n1798 - French forces capture Malta from the Knights of Malta,\n\n1800 - French troops surrender to British forces after a Royal Navy blockade.\n\n1814 - The Treaty of Vienna ends the Napoleonic Wars, and grants Malta as a crown colony to Britain. Along with Gibraltar, Malta becomes Britain's key naval base in the Mediterranean."
