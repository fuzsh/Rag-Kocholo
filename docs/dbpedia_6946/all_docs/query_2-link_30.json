The army was not a permanent standing army, but was mustered when there was some danger. Because of this, many of the imperial troops had stronger local ties than any loyalty to the Emperor.\n\nThe size of the Army was controlled by the Imperial Army Constitution (Reichsdefensionalordnung) of 1681 which determined the composition of the army, and fixed the levy of how many troops had to be provided by the various \"Imperial Circles\" of the Empire.\n\nThe Imperial Register (Reichsmatrikel or Heeresmatrikel) determined levy of the individual states. The total strength was eventually set at 40,000 men, consisting of 28,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, including 2,000 dragoons (mounted infantry). In emergencies, however, the size of the army could be increased by doubling or tripling the contingents.\n\nText edited from Wikipedia\n\nImperial Assault Banner/Imperial War Banner\n\nReichsturmfahne\n\nSpeculative image by Pete Loeser, 24 July 2011\n\nLike the Imperial Banner the War flag had a black (one-headed) eagle on a gold field, with a red Schwenkel attached.\n\nNorman Martin, 14 January 1998\n\nImperial War Flag (Saint George's Flag) 1200-1350\n\nImperial Krieg Flagge (St. George Flagge)\n\nImage by Jaume Oll�\n\nTwo additional flags associated with the Empire worth mentioning are the Sankt Georg Fahne - a white St. George's cross on a red field frequently with a Schwenkel - (Smith 1975, p.115, labels this the Imperial War Flag) and the Reichsturmfahne.\n\nNorman Martin, 14 Jan 1998\n\nEven though I found no reference to the Sankt Georg Flagge as war flag except in Smith 1975, it is clear that its primary use was military and in view of Smith's identification, I would not be surprised if it were sometimes or even frequently called Reichskriegsflagge.\n\nNorman Martin, 15 Mar 2000\n\n6th Company, Infantry, Regiment Waldmannshausen 1620\n\n6.

Eine bunte Fibel by Ottfried Neubecker, 1939 [neu39a], p.26-27\n\nAccroding to source this regiment was divided into at least 10 companies. The image of the 6th company is given, the flags of the companies 7, 8, 9 and 10 are described.\n\n[neu39a] mentions, that this type is very seldom. The companies of this regiment all have the same pattern, but the colours are varied. So having the same pattern, the flags can be reconstructed.\n\nAll companies of this regiment had a flag with ratio est. 4:5 and had been divided per bend.\n\nThe flags of companies 1 to 5 are not described. Probably the basic colour of 1st company was white (colonel), but there is no proof.\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009\n\n7th Company, Infantry, Regiment Waldmannshausen 1620\n\n7.

The Protestants were defeated on 13 March 1569 at Jarmac and their leader Louis I of Bourbon-Cond� had been captured and executed.\n\nWinner was the later king of France Henry III, the new leader of the Protestants, admiral Coligny also was defeated at Moncontour on 3 October 1569.\n\nDuke Wolfgang of Palatinate-Zweibrücken was a follower of Calvin, while most German protestant rulers were Lutherans. The duke decided to help his French brothers in face. He died during the campaign. The colours of his regiments got lost in the battle of Moncontour. Probably they can be seen somewhere in France.\n\nAccording to [neu39a] the troops on foot of that era used rectangular flags, sometimes with embowed ends and fixed at a short flagpole, while the cavalry used triangular standards. I denote troops on foot as infantry, though this denomination probably was introduced later in Spain(?) (troops of the infante).\n\nSome of these flags look like I�ve plundered a harlekin`s wardrobe and converted his costumes to flags. It was, however, very common in the 16th century to use monochrome pieces of the same colours diffferently shaped as distinguishing marks of the single companies.\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009\n\nThere are several places called Moncontour in France. The Battle of Moncontour took place near the village of Moncontour (1,008 inhabitants in 2006), located in the department of Vienne, historical province of Poitou. The battle was of short duration, but particularly bloody: the Huguenots lost 6,000 men (nearly one third of their troops), while the Catholics lost \"only\" 600 men. Henri III then bore the title of the Duke of Anjou.\n\nAn engraving representing the Battle of Moncontour (with flags) is available here.\n\nThe original is shown at the Georges Turpin Museum, Parthenay.\n\nAnother representation of the battle, in colours (with flags), is available here.\n\nA detailed account of the battle is available here (in French).\n\nIvan Sache, 24 Jun 2009\n\nDucal Regiment Flag\n\nImage by Klaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009\n\nDucal regiment flag: The ratio was approx 11:19 plus an embowed end added to the fly. The hoist consists of diamonds of the colours blue, red, yellow and white. The fly consists of nine horitontal stripes in order: yellow-blue-red-yellow-red-blue-white-yellow-red. One single red diamond is superimposed by a small white cross like that one of Schwyz canton, but in this case it is the ensign of the alliance of Huguenots.\n\nSource: [neu32], p.31, image no.98\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009\n\nDucal Cavalry Flag\n\nImage by Klaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009\n\nDucal cavalry flag: It is a triangular pennant, mainly white but with blue, black and yellow pieces of cloth. The white cross of the alliance of Huguenots is placed into the upper blue piece of cloth.\n\nSource: [neu32], p.31, image no.99\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009\n\nRegiment Hohengeroldseck\n\nImage by Klaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009\n\nRegiment Hohengeroldseck: The ratio was approx 11:19 plus an embowed end added to the fly. The hoist was yellow, flamed five times horizontally red. The fly was red with the white cross of the alliance of Huguenots in its centre. The regiment was lead by count Quirin Gangolf of Hohengeroldseck, which was a small territory in the Black Forrest. The count was colonel of 15 companies and in service of Wolfgang of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. The flags of all companies were red and yellow with the white cross. The patterns of the companies were different.\n\nSources: [neu32], p.31 , image no.100; [neu39a], p.27\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009\n\nRegiment Granweiler\n\nImage by Klaus-Michael Schneider, 24 Jun 2009"
