In 962, Karl's grandson, Otto I of Germany was re-crowned \"Emperor of the Romans\" by Pope John XII, thus giving the German kings once again claim to the title \"Holy Roman Emperor.\" From this time forward, the German kings would continually claim the right to rule this central European empire. The empire's territory was centered on the Kingdoms of Germany, and included some neighboring territories, which at its peak included the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Burgundy.\n\n| Holy Roman Imperial Standards | Holy Roman Military Banners and Flags | Holy Roman Territory Flags | Flags of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThe Flag of the Holy Roman Empire was not a national flag, but rather an imperial banner used by the Holy Roman Emperor. Usually a black eagle was placed on either a golden or white background. One source claimed the gold field was for the Emperor's flag, and the white field for the Empire's flag.\n\nIn 1401, a double-headed eagle replaced the single-headed eagle on the Imperial Banner of the Holy Roman Emperor. Described as: \"Double-headed imperial eagle displayed with a halo sable armed and langued gules.\" There were two versions, one with haloes and one without.\n\nIn 1804, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II of the Habsburg Dynasty declared his domain to be the Austrian Empire and became Francis I of Austria. The first flag of the Austrian Empire was black and gold using the colors from the banner of the Holy Roman Emperor. Francis II became the last Holy Roman Emperor after Napoleon I of France defeated Austria in 1806. The traditional colors black, yellow/gold, red, and white (plus green after Austria united with Hungary) were often used in the national and military flags of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918.\n\nHoly Roman Imperial Standards and Banners\n\n| Top of the page | Imperial Standards | Military Banners and Flags | Holy Roman Territory Flags |\n\nHoly Roman Imperial Military Standards and Flags\n\nThe very size of the territory controlled by the Holy Roman Emperor was huge, and many of his forces came from a variety of vassal states. This led to a whole range of different military standards being used by his military forces, a few of which will be shown here.\n\n| Top of the page | Imperial Standards | Military Banners and Flags | Holy Roman Territory Flags |\n\nHoly Roman Empire Territory Flags\n\nAgain the very size of the territory controlled by the Holy Roman Emperor, divided into what were called \"Imperial Circles,\" consisting of hundreds of smaller sub-units, principalities, duchies, counties, Free Imperial Cities and other domains, that it was mind boggling. The Empires lands were so huge and varied that this led to a whole range of different territorial standards, banners and flags being used by the Empire at different times, only a few of which will be shown here.\n\nHis Imperial holdings included the territories in the Austrian Circle, the territories in the Bavarian Circle, the territories in the Electoral Rhenish Circle, the territories in the Electoral Rhenish Circle, the territories in the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle, the territories in the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle, and the territories in the Upper Rhenish Circle, to name a few.\n\nThey included at one time the modern countries of Germany (except Southern Schleswig), Austria (except Burgenland), the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Slovenia (except Prekmurje), and significant parts of eastern France (mainly Artois, Alsace, Franche-Comté, Savoy and Lorraine), northern Italy (mainly Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Trentino and South Tyrol), and western Poland (mainly Silesia, Pomerania and Neumark).\n\nImperial City of Memmingen\n\nImperial City of Nuremberg\n\nExamples of Holy Roman Imperial City Flags and Banners\n\nShown here are examples of the flags used by the Imperial cities of the Holy Roman Empire. Imperial Cities were ruled by secular princes. As vassals of the Emperor, they paid taxes to the Emperor and had to supply troops for his military campaigns. Imperial Cities had representation in the Reichstag of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Imperial City of Nuremberg\n\nNuremberg is located today in the German State of Bavaria. it is located about 105 miles north of Munich. Nuremberg was often referred to as the \"unofficial capital\" of the Holy Roman Empire, because the Reichstage (Imperial Diets) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. In 1219, Frederick II granted a \"Great Letter of Freedom\" (Großen Freiheitsbrief), to Nuremberg which gave the town rights to mint their own coins and collect their own customs fees. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.\n\nThe Imperial City of Memmingen\n\nMemmingen is a town in the Bavarian region of Swabia in Germany. It was the central economic, educational and administrative center in the Danube-Iller region during the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nSachsen-Polen-Litauen\n\nUnion of Sachsen-Polen-Litauen 1587-1668\n\nThe Union of Saxony, Poland and Lithuania (Sachsen-Polen-Litauen), also called the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (15691795), was the largest and one of the most populous countries of 16th and 17th Century Europe. At this time, Poland and Lithuania were ruled by a common monarch, but they were not considered a single country, but two separate countries who happened to be ruled by the same king.\n\nThis is the Royal banner (not a flag - the notion of a national flag did not exist at the time) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the rule of the House of Vasa (1587-1668). The banner has a field of three horizontal stripes of red, white and red, and is charged with a double coat-of-arms: the large one features a Polish eagle in the first and forth quarters, and a Lithuanian knight in the second and third quarter covered by a royal crown. This smaller arms defacing the larger, has the Swedish three-crowns in quarters 1 and 4, and the Swedish lion in quarters 2 and 3. The whole thing is surrounded by the Order of the Golden fleece.\n\nWettin House Flag\n\nFlag of the Wettin House from Saxony\n\nThe House of Wettin was a German dynasty that once ruled the German State of Saxony and Thuringia for more than 800 years. This powerful family inter-married with other Royal families of Europe and ascended the thrones of Belgium, Bulgaria, Poland, Portugal, and Great Britain as counts, dukes, prince-electors and kings.\n\nThe royal families of the United Kingdom and Belgian are descendants of the Wettin royal line today.\n\nBavaria Flag\n\nFlag of Bavaria\n\nBavaria is one of the oldest states of Europe dating back to Roman times. In the Middle Ages it was established as a duchy, and eventually the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The Kingdom of Bavaria existed from 1806 to 1918, and after that Bavaria became a free state (republic), formally the Free State of Bavaria, located in the southeast of Germany.\n\nThe Flag of Bavaria consists of an array of blue and white lozenges (diamond-shaped objects (charges) that are placed on the field of the shield or flag. The lozenges are usually somewhat narrower than they are tall.\n\nCologne Flag\n\nArchbishopric-Electorate of Cologne 1475-1794\n\nThe Electorate of Cologne (Kurfürstentum Köln) was a principality of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by the Archbishop of the City of Cologne. Between the 10th and the early 19th century, it mirrored the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne (Erzbistum Köln).\n\nThe flag of the Archbishopric-Electorate of Cologne was very reminiscent of the flag of the Knight's Templar with its black St George's Cross on a white field.\n\nCL Flag\n\nGerman Catholic League\n\nThe German Catholic League (Katholische Liga) was a confederation of Roman Catholic German states formed in 1609 after the founding of the Protestant Union a year earlier. The competition of the Protestant Union, as an instrument of the Protestant reformers, and the German Catholic League, an instrument of the supporters of the Catholic Church, foreshadowed the episodes of civil disobedience, repression, and retaliations that would eventually ignite the Thirty Years' War.\n\nMerchant Ensign\n\nMerchant Ensign of Holstein-Gottorp\n\nHolstein-Gottorp is the historical name for the parts of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein that were ruled by the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. The territories of Gottorp are located in present-day Denmark and Germany. The Dukes ruled from Gottorf Castle in the city of Schleswig in the Duchy of Schleswig.\n\nThis red swallow-tailed Merchant Ensign was used by the commercial ships of the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp. Centered on its red background is the golden shield of Schleswig featuring two blue lions, placed over the white nettle leaf of Holstein.\n\nEarly Brandenburg Ensign\n\nNaval Ensign of the Margraviate of Brandenburg\n\nKriegsflagge Kur-Brandenburgische Flotte\n\nKur-Brandenburg, also known as the Margraviate of Brandenburg (Markgrafschaft Brandenburg), was a major principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1157 to 1806. Also called the March of Brandenburg (Mark Brandenburg), or the Electorate of Brandenburg (Kurfürstentum Brandenburg), its rulers became some of the prince-electors who voted for the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nIn 1815, the Margraviate of Brandenburg was replaced with the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. The term \"Mark Brandenburg\" is still used sometimes today to refer to the Federal State of Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n| Top of the page | Imperial Standards | Military Banners and Flags | Holy Roman Territory Flags |\n\n| Prussian Flags Before 1800 | Prussian Flags 1800-1892 | Prussian Flags After 1900 |\n\n| Imperial Germany Era Flags | German Colonial Flags | Weimar Republic Era Flags |\n\n| Third Reich Era Civil and Political Flags | Third Reich Era Military Flags | Modern Era Flags |"
