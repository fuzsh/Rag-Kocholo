This flag flag of the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation is a variant in modern coloring, with red tinging on the beak and claws. The tinging in gray is considered historical because it is often seen that way, very rarely in red. The tinging with red is often like better, however, and allows the association to the today's German Eagle. The two-headed eagle was introduced around 1433. A flag with a one-headed eagle remained in use as the standard of the princes.
