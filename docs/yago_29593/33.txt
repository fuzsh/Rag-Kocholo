Dimitri Marrick

Dimitri Marick came to Pine Valley as a rich, mysterious and handsome millionaire businessman. He rescued Natalie Hunter from the infamous well and was briefly engaged to her until his first wife, the formerly comatose Angelique resurfaced. Later, he learned boyhood friend and sometime enemy, Edmund Grey, was also a rightful son and heir to Hugo Marick (Dimitri's father). Dimitri was shocked by the news that Anton Lang was his long lost son. It seems Corvinna Lang(a Marick maid) had seduced a young drunken Dimitri, who remembered nothing of this encounter. Currently divorced from Erica Kane after a long and tempestuous relationship resulting in two marriages. In a time of great emotional distress for them both, Dimitri slept with his sister-in-law, Maria Santos Grey. Maria later found out she was pregnant and Skye managed to learn that Dimitri and Maria had had an affair. She doctored paternity test results to make it look like Dimitri was the father of Maria's child. Erica learned of the affair and hit the roof. She left Dimitri and later went on a tirade that including kidnapping Maria's infant and passing it off as a baby she adopted from Russia.

Dimitri managed to turn a loan to Stuart Chandler into a way to steal ownership of WRCW. He allowed Stuart to use WRCW as collateral for the loan then turned around and demanded to have Stuart repay the loan on the spot. Because Stuart didn't have the cash to pay back Dimitri, Dimitri and his big wig lawyer coaxed Stuart into signing over ownership of WRCW to Dimitri. Liza Colby checked up on Dimitri and found that too many of his investors were not born in America. This violated an FCC regulation and she swindled Dimitri out of ownership of the station.

Dimitri always had his eye on Gloria Marsh. Gloria fell in love with Tad, but his insistence that she cut off her friendship with Dimitri put a rift in their relationship. Dimitri used this difference of opinion to draw Gloria closer to him. Eventually, Dimitri convinced Gloria that Tad had cheated on her with Liza and she agreed to marry Dimitri.

After the horrible plane crash, in which Maria lost her life, Dimitri sought custody of Maddie. Dimitri took Maddie to the hospital and found that she was biologically Edmund's daughter, because her blood type did not match Dimitri's. Dimitri thought that if he told anyone he would lose both Maddie and Gloria, instead he took off to Vadzel. Edmund and Tad tracked them down and brought them back to the states. After winning back custody of Maddie, Edmund and Tad planned to set Dimitri up at the Crystal Ball in the Crypt, by getting his so angry that he admits to everything, which he did. What he did not know was that Tad brought Gloria down to the Crypt to listen to what Dimitri had to say. Upon hearing what she had hoped was not true, she entered the room and slapped Dimitri, leaving him, and filed for divorce. Dimitri was so upset and enraged, he pulled a gun on Edmund and shot him. Little did Dimitri know was that the bullets in the gun had been replaced with blanks, by a magician after Tad found out that Dimitri had the gun. Thinking that he shot Edmund, a very terrified Dimitri confessed that he was very sorry for everything. When Edmund opened his eyes and let Dimitri in on the sly trick, Dimitri got even angrier. Dimitri walked outside of the crypt and was hit by a falling tree. Stuck, he felt helpless. Edmund came to his rescue and rushed him to the hospital. Gloria of all people had to restart Dimitri's heart, but she still ended their marriage. Gloria finally left town to get her life straightened out. Dimitri tried to make peace with everyone - knowing now that life is too precious to be vengeful towards anyone.

Dimitri's attempt to piece his life back together worked quite handily. It took some time, but eventually he and Edmund became close again---and it was this closeness that allowed Dimitri to repay his brother. After it was learned that the evil Jim Thomasen was responsible for the plane crash that claimed Maria's life, Jim lashed out at anyone who could prove that he had a hand in the disaster. Jim chained Edmund to a metal grating inside an aqueduct. Dimitri came to the rescue but rather than immobilizing Jim, Dimitri raced inside the aqueduct to rescue his brother. It almost proved to be a fatal mistake. Jim recovered from the blows that Dimitri had inflicted upon him and locked Dimitri inside with Edmund. In a few hours, the tide would roll in and both Edmund and Dimitri would be goners. Luckily Dimitri managed to free himself and Edmund---but Jim Thomasen was not done haunting them. Thinking that Jim had killed Edmund and Dimitri, Brooke lured Jim to Stuart Chandler's art gallery and shot him to death. Dimitri arrived on the scene and told the police that he had been the one to kill Jim. Brooke silenced him and confessed that she had been the one to do the dirty deed. Dimitri stood by Brooke's side throughout the subsequent murder trial. After Brooke was acquitted, she and Dimitri saw an awful lot of each other. Brooke, though, was not ready to get involved with another man and her budding relationship with Dimitro withered and died.

Unbeknownst to anyone, shortly after being trapped in the aqueduct Dimitri began having dizzy spells. He flew to Europe to be checked out. He thought that he might have water trapped in his ear, but his problems were much more serious. Dimitri was referred to one of the top neurologists in the word, Dr. Alexandra Devane. Dr. Devane diagnosed Dimitri with a very rare disease that prevents the cells in the brain from rejuvenating themselves. Over time, the cells that die are not replaced by new ones and the brain essentially dies. Alexandra developed a miracle cure that put the disease in remission. By this time, though, she and her patient had fallen hopelessly in love with one another. Following their surprise marriage, Dimitri and Alexandra flew back to Pine Valley to announce that they were husband and wife. On the plane trip back, Dimitri was believed to have suffered a fatal brain aneurysm and died. It was later discovered his wife, Alex Devane ,was hiding him at Seaview Hospital. Dimitri lapsed into a coma. Edmund was suspicious of Alex and accused her of killing Dimitri. Eventually, Alex caved and admitted that Dimitri was not dead. Alex and Edmund plotted to heal Dimitri with experimental stem cell therapy. The stem cells were believed to have been donated from Colby Martin . Adam, however, swapped the stem cells with another child's. The stem cell therapy was successful. Dimitri then snuck out of the hospital of his own accord and is believed to have walked into the ocean where he drown himself. His body has never been recovered.
