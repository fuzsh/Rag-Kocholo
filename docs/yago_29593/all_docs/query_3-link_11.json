        "text": "Q: I know Erica Slezak has played Viki for a long time is she the only person who has ever played the character?\n\nA: The daughter of legendary actor Walter Slezak, Erika has starred in the role of Viki for over 25 years. However, before Erika, there was Trish Van Devere (1968); Gillian Spencer (1968-71), and JoAnn Dorian (1971).\n\nQ: I heard that Cassie was once married to Bo Buchanan. Is that true?\n\nA: Yes, it is true. Cassie and Bo were married on November 27, 1991, but divorced when his previous wife, Sarah Gordon returned after it was believed that she had perished in a plane crash.\n\nQ: In your last column, you named Ericas husbands. I noticed that Mike Roy was not included in the list. Didnt they get married?\n\nA: You are correct, but it was not a legal marriage. You see, Erica had been married to Adam Chandler. Adam, wanting to test her love and loyalty, faked his death. Erica, being Erica, soon realized that she had been in love with Mike all along, so the grieving widow recited the vows once again. When Adam showed up alive and kicking Erica was beside herself, because this made her marriage to Mike Roy illegal. Poor Erica.\n\nQ: Im trying to remember the name of the campaign for which Erica became the signature model for Sensuelle Cosmetics. Can you help me out?\n\nA: Sure..it was An American Beauty.\n\nQ: Dimitri has always looked really familiar to me. What other roles has the actor played?\n\nA: Michael Nader, who has played in the role of Dimitri Marick since September 1991, has appeared in dozens of movies since 1963. Included in this are the Beach Party flicks with Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. He also had a recurring role in As The World Turns,\" and nighttime dramas Dynasty and Bare Essence. Michael has also performed in off-broadway plays.\n\nQ: Coltin Scott (Nikolas) looks a LOT like Jason-Shane Scott who plays Will Rappaport on One Life To Live. Are they related?\n\nA: Coltin Scott, a real cutie, who is also actively pursuing a singing career with one album out and another in progress, credits his mother for her ongoing support and his father, who is deceased, for his inspiration. However, there has been no information found that indicates that Coltin and Jason, another cutie, are related.\n\nQ: Whatever happened to Edward Qs son, Jimmie Lee Holt?\n\nMaking an unexpected appearance into the life of the Quartermaines in 1983, Jimmie Lee Holt announced to the family that he was Edwards illegitimate son from an affair (yes another one) Edward had with Beatrice LeSeur. Involved in numerous ventures and escapades during his three year stay in Port Charles, Jimmie Lee ultimately met and married pretty little Charity Gatlin in 1986. She was a woman who owned a general store. They settled down in her hometown of Pautuck in upstate NY, where they presumably lived happily ever-after. That is, until the powers that be decide to bring them back.\n\nQ: I loved your detailed overview of Jason Morgan last week. How long will Steve Burton be back on the show this time?\n\nA: Thank you. Jason will make his return to Port Charles on August 26th, it is reported that he will stay for six weeks.\n\nQ: Whatever happened to Asas ex-wife, the one who had the Egyptian wedding? I missed a few months and never knew what happened to her. The last time I saw her, Carlo Hesser was watching her through a two-way glass.\n\nA: Alex Olonov, played by Tonja Walker, became mayor of Llanview and married underworld kingpin Carlo Hesser in October of 96, pretending to be pregnant with his baby by wearing a cushion under her wedding dress. All went totally sour as Asa, knowing Alex had had her tubes tied a few years earlier, pulled off her dress in front of the entire crowd, exposing her secret. Carlo was livid, to put it mildly and told her, No one ever betrays me.\n\nAfter trying to explain to Carlo why she did it, he wound up trying his best to choke her. She told him she wanted them to adopt a child and everything she did was out of love for him. In answer to this Carlo took off his wedding ring. A few weeks later he informed her of a petition that was circulating to have her thrown out of office. Using a little double-talk Carlo managed to convince her that he was there to help her (NOT!) He told her for her own protection she should shred all her important and sensitive files. She believed him and did as he said.\n\nWhile she was busy shredding, Carlo was busy calling Hank at LPD to tell him what Alex was up to. After she was caught red-handed, she realized that Carlo was the culprit who double-crossed her. She then spilled everything to Hank about Carlo being the mad bomber of the Palace Hotel and the fact that he was the infamous Poseidon.Next, she hot-footed it to Todd to tell him about Carlo, in order to have it published in the Sun. In other words, she was out for revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlo made plans to fake his own death in order to leave the country. He arranged to have cocaine planted in Alex room as payback for her opening her mouth once too often. (Do these two ever quit??) Alex was taken into custody. Things got worse after the police found the drugs in her room. Hank offered her a deal -- a plea bargain for information about Carlo.\n\nCarlo was planning to frame Antonio Vega for his demise, because Antonio lied to him. On this same night Todd was giving a huge party for Blair. Everyone who is anyone was there, including Carlo Hesser. All of a sudden the lights went out and next thing we know, Carlo is found dead floating in the water with a bullet-hole in his head.\n\nFrom there, practically every major character in Llanview became a suspect in the murder, as everyone hated Carlo for one reason or another. Alex, not to be forgotten in this, showed up later on with Carlos Will, which she forged of course, naming Antonio as the heir to Carlos fortune.\n\nMonths passed. Carlos twin brother, Mortimer, showed up in town and testified that Alex was the murderer. Carlo -- er -- Mortimer got close to those in Llanview and was regarded as the good brother.\n\nOne day Alex was sitting alone and discussing with herself (needed help at that point), the possibility of running for mayor once again. Behind her she heard clapping as if in congratulations for her decision. Carl  er -- Mortimer -- e r-- Carlo was indeed alive and was standing right behind her. Alex, overjoyed, but a little taken-back by his sudden appearance, began to rehash everything she did to him and why. (Obviously this girl had never heard the old expression Let sleeping dogs lie) They are drawn together again in Carlos limousine and soon disappear into the sunset, never to be seen again.\n\nClick here to read Naomi's profile\n\nNaomi welcomes your questions and comments\n\nClick here to read Clackum's Corner from Aug 7th"
