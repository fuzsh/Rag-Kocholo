This multicentre retrospective study was organised by the ComitÃ© de Transplantation de l'Association FranÃ§aise d'Urologie (French Urology Association transplantation committee). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 19 software. Ninety-five patients were included in this study. Renal transplant urolithiasis was an incidental finding in 55% of cases, mostly on a routine follow-up ultrasound examination. One half of symptomatic stones were due to urinary tract infection and the other half were due to an episode of acute renal failure. The initial management following diagnosis of urolithiasis was double J stenting (27%), nephrostomy tube placement (21%), or watchful waiting (52%). Definitive management consisted of: watchful waiting (48%), extracorporeal lithotripsy (13%), rigid or flexible ureteroscopy (26%), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (11%) and surgical pyelotomy (2%). All transplants remained functional following treatment of the stone. The main limitation is the retrospective design. The incidence of lithiasis could be higher inÂ kidneyÂ transplantedÂ patients due toÂ a possible anatomical or metabolical abnormalities.Â The therapeutic management of renal transplant urolithiasis appears to be comparable to that of native kidney urolithiasis.\n\nEmergency IVF for embryo freezing to preserve female fertility: a French multicentre cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCourbiere, B; Decanter, C; Bringer-Deutsch, S; Rives, N; MiralliÃ©, S; Pech, J C; De Ziegler, D; CarrÃ©-Pigeon, F; May-Panloup, P; Sifer, C; Amice, V; Schweitzer, T; Porcu-Buisson, G; Poirot, C\n\n2013-09-01\n\nWhat are the outcomes of French emergency IVF procedures involving embryo freezing for fertility preservation before gonadotoxic treatment? Pregnancy rates after emergency IVF, cryopreservation of embryos, storage, thawing and embryo transfer (embryo transfer), in the specific context of the preservation of female fertility, seem to be similar to those reported for infertile couples undergoing ART. A French retrospective multicentre cohort study initiated by the GRECOT network-the French Study Group for Ovarian and Testicular Cryopreservation. We sent an e-mail survey to the 97 French centres performing the assisted reproduction technique in 2011, asking whether the centre performed emergency IVF and requesting information about the patients' characteristics, indications, IVF cycles and laboratory and follow-up data. The response rate was 53.6% (52/97). Fourteen French centres reported that they performed emergency IVF (56 cycles in total) before gonadotoxic treatment, between 1999 and July 2011, in 52 patients. The patients had a mean age of 28.9 Â± 4.3 years, and a median length of relationship of 3 years (1 month-15 years). Emergency IVF was indicated for haematological cancer (42%), brain tumour (23%), sarcoma (3.8%), mesothelioma (n = 1) and bowel cancer (n = 1). Gynaecological problems accounted for 17% of indications. In 7.7% of cases, emergency IVF was performed for autoimmune diseases. Among the 52 patients concerned, 28% (n = 14) had undergone previous courses of chemotherapy before beginning controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). The initiation of gonadotoxic treatment had to be delayed in 34% of the patients (n = 19). In total, 56 cycles were initiated. The mean duration of stimulation was 11.2 Â± 2.5 days, with a mean peak estradiol concentration on the day on which ovulation was triggered of 1640 Â± 1028 pg/ml. Three cycles were cancelled due to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (n = 1), poor response (n = 1) and treatment error (n = 1).

To date, the management of depression remains mainly empirical and often poorly evaluated. The development of a personalized medicine in psychiatry may reduce treatment failure, intolerance or resistance, and hence the burden and costs of mood depressive disorders. The Geneva Cocktail Phenotypic approach presents several advantages including the \"in vivo\" measure of different cytochromes and transporter P-gp activities, their simultaneous determination in a single test, avoiding the influence of variability over time on phenotyping results, the administration of low dose substrates, a limited sampling strategy with an analytical method developed on DBS analysis. The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME), assessed by a phenotypic approach, and the concentrations of Venlafaxine (VLX)Â +Â O-demethyl-venlafaxine (ODV), the efficacy and tolerance of VLX. This study is a multicentre prospective non-randomized open trial. Eligible patients present a major depressive episode, MADRS over or equal to 20, treatment with VLX regardless of the dose during at least 4Â weeks. The Phenotype Visit includes VLX and ODV concentration measurement. Following the oral absorption of low doses of omeprazole, midazolam, dextromethorphan, and fexofenadine, drug metabolizing enzymes activity is assessed by specific metabolite/probe concentration ratios from a sample taken 2Â h after cocktail administration for CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2D6; and by the determination of the limited area under the curve from the capillary blood samples taken 2-3 and 6Â h after cocktail administration for CYP2C19 and P-gp. Two follow-up visits will take place between 25 and 40Â days and 50-70Â days after inclusion. They include assessment of efficacy, tolerance and observance.

Cohort study of women with BOTs. French multicentre tertiary care centres. A cohort of 360 women with BOTs who received primary surgical treatment between January 2000 and December 2013. Clinical and pathological factors affecting recurrence in women with BOTs. The development of a model for the prediction of recurrence in women with BOTs. Overall the recurrence rate was 20.0% (72/360). Recurrence was associated with five variables: ageÂ <Â 45Â years; preoperative serum tumour marker CA125Â >Â 150Â IU/mL; a serous histological subtype; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage other than IA; and ovarian surgery other than bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO; i.e. cystectomy and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). These variables were included in the RSS and assigned scores ranging from 0 to 6. The discrimination of the RSS was 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 95%Â CI 0.79-0.85). A total score of 8Â points corresponded to the optimal threshold of the RSS, with a rate of recurrence of 11.8% (35/297) and 58.7% (37/63) for women at low risk (<8Â points) and women at high risk (â¥8Â points), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was 85.0%. This study shows that the risk of BOT recurrence can be accurately predicted so that women at high risk can benefit from adapted surgical treatment. Our RSS permitted women with BOTs at low risk to be distinguished from women with BOTs at high risk of recurrence.

This paper presents our test protocol and results obtained for the 22 PET centres (overall 13 different scanners) involved in the MEMENTO cohort. We determined acquisition parameters using phantom experiments prior to patient studies, with the aim of optimizing PET quantitative values to the highest possible per site, while reducing, if possible, variability across centres. Jaszczak's and 3D-Hoffman's phantom measurements were used to assess image spatial resolution (ISR), recovery coefficients (RC) in hot and cold spheres, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For each centre, the optimal reconstruction parameters were chosen as those maximizing ISR and RC without a noticeable decrease in SNR. Point-spread-function (PSF) modelling reconstructions were discarded. The three figures of merit extracted from the images reconstructed with optimized parameters and routine schemes were compared, as were volumes of interest ratios extracted from Hoffman acquisitions. The net effect of the 3D-OSEM reconstruction parameter optimization was investigated on a subset of 18 scanners without PSF modelling reconstruction. Compared to the routine parameters of the 22 PET centres, average RC in the two smallest hot and cold spheres and average ISR remained stable or were improved with the optimized reconstruction, at the expense of slight SNR degradation, while the dispersion of values was reduced. For the subset of scanners without PSF modelling, the mean RC of the smallest hot sphere obtained with the optimized reconstruction was significantly higher than with routine reconstruction. The putamen and caudate-to-white matter ratios measured on 3D-Hoffman acquisitions of all centres were also significantly improved by the optimization, while the variance was reduced. This study provides guidelines for optimizing quantitative\n\nSalmeterol versus slow-release theophylline combined with ketotifen in nocturnal asthma: a multicentre trial. French Multicentre Study Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuir, J F; Bertin, L; Georges, D\n\n1992-11-01\n\nWe wished to assess the efficacy of inhaled salmeterol (SML; 50 micrograms b.i.d.) compared to a combination of slow-release theophylline and ketotifen p.o. (TK; T 300 mg+K 1 mg b.i.d.) for the treatment of nocturnal asthma. Ninety six patients with nocturnal asthma, (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 60-90% of predicted value, reversibility > or = 15%, at least two nocturnal awakenings per week) were eligible for a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy cross-over study (14-day run-in, two successive 28-day treatment periods). Efficacy was assessed as success/failure, success being defined as the complete disappearance of nocturnal symptoms/awakening during the last week of each treatment period. There was a statistically significant difference between SML and TK for this criterion: 46% and 39% success with SML during periods I (first 28-day period) and II (following the cross-over), compared to only 15% and 26% with TK, respectively (p < 0.01). SML was also significantly better for the other criteria (lung function, rescue salbutamol intake during day and night). Side-effects were five times less frequent in SML-treated patients (p < 0.004). Efficacy and tolerance of SML were obviously far better than those of TK in patients with nocturnal asthma.\n\n[Relevance of the sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast multifocal and multicentric cancer].\n\nPubMed\n\nMosbah, R; Raimond, E; Pelissier, A; Hocedez, C; Graesslin, O\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThe sentinel lymph node biopsy is a gold standard in the management of breast cancer. Its role in multifocal or multicentric tumors is still evolving. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and pertinence of sentinel lymph node biopsy in multifocal and multicentric tumors based on a systematic review of literature. A systematic review was conducted searching in the following electronic databases PubMed using \"sentinel lymph node biopsy\", \"breast cancer\", \"multifocal tumor\", \"multicentric tumor\" and \"multiple tumor\" as keywords. We included original articles published between 2000 and 2014, both French and English, studying feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in invasive breast cancer, multicentric and/or multifocal tumors. The first end point was success rate and false negative rate. Twenty-six articles were included in this literature review, with 2212 cases (782 multifocal, 737 multicentric and 693 multiple tumors). Percentage of tumors whose stage was higher than stage T2 ranged from 0 to 86.3%. Success rate average was 83.1%. False negative average was 8.2%. False negative rate was less than 10% in 15 articles. Mean of sentinel lymph node biopsy was 2 (1-9). The average rate of sentinel lymph node positive was 50.6%. Axillary recurrence rate was 0.5%. Despite the methodological biases of the studies included in this review of literature, the false negative rate of sentinel node biopsy in multifocal and multicentric breast cancers are less than 10% with a low rate of axillary recurrence. Despite the lack of randomized study, this procedure can be routinely performed in accordance with rigorous technical process. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The aim of this paper is to describe the approach we used during the HANDOVER Project to develop a multicentre, multinational research project for studying transitions of patient care while creating a community of practice for the researchers. We highlight the process used to assure the quality of a multicentre qualitative study and to create a codebook for data analysis as examples of attending to the community of practice while conducting rigorous qualitative research. Essential elements for the success of this multinational, multilanguage research project included recruiting a strong research team, explicit planning for decision-making processes to be used throughout the project, acknowledging the differences among the study settings and planning the protocols to capitalise upon those differences. Although not commonly discussed in reports of large research projects, there is an underlying, concurrent stream of activities to develop a cohesive team that trusts and respects one another's skills and that engage independent researchers in a group process that contributes to achieving study goals. We discuss other lessons learned and offer recommendations for other teams planning multicentre research.\n\nEpidemiological, virological and clinical characteristics of HBV infection in 223 HIV co-infected patients: a French multi-centre collaborative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nThibault, Vincent; Gaudy-Graffin, Catherine; Colson, Philippe; Gozlan, JoÃ«l; Schnepf, Nathalie; Trimoulet, Pascale; Pallier, Coralie; Saune, Karine; Branger, Michel; Coste, Marianne; Thoraval, Francoise Roudot\n\n2013-03-15\n\nChronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a clinical concern in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals due to substantial prevalence, difficulties to treat, and severe liver disease outcome. A large nationwide cross-sectional multicentre analysis of HIV-HBV co-infected patients was designed to describe and identify parameters associated with virological and clinical outcome of CHB in HIV-infected individuals with detectable HBV viremia. A multicenter collaborative cross-sectional study was launched in 19 French University hospitals distributed through the country. From January to December 2007, HBV load, genotype, clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 223 HBV-HIV co-infected patients with an HBV replication over 1000 IU/mL were investigated. Patients were mostly male (82%, mean age 42 years). Genotype distribution (A 52%; E 23.3%; D 16.1%) was linked to risk factors, geographic origin, and co-infection with other hepatitis viruses. This genotypic pattern highlights divergent contamination event timelines by HIV and HBV viruses. Most patients (74.7%) under antiretroviral treatment were receiving a drug with anti-HBV activity, including 47% receiving TDF. Genotypic lamivudine-resistance detected in 26% of the patients was linked to duration of lamivudine exposure, age, CD4 count and HIV load. Resistance to adefovir (rtA181T/V) was detected in 2.7% of patients. Advanced liver lesions were observed in 54% of cases and were associated with an older age and lower CD4 counts but not with viral load or genotype. Immune escape HBsAg variants were seldom detected. Despite the detection of advanced liver lesions in most patients, few were not receiving anti-HBV drugs and for those treated with the most potent anti-HBV drugs, persistent replication suggested non-optimal adherence. Heterogeneity in HBV strains reflects epidemiological differences that may impact liver disease progression. These findings are strong arguments to further optimize clinical management\n\nA French validation study of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).\n\nPubMed\n\nSchnakers, Caroline; Majerus, Steve; Giacino, Joseph; Vanhaudenhuyse, Audrey; Bruno, Marie-Aurelie; Boly, Melanie; Moonen, Gustave; Damas, Pierre; Lambermont, Bernard; Lamy, Maurice; Damas, Francois; Ventura, Manfredi; Laureys, Steven\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the concurrent validity, inter-rater agreement and diagnostic sensitivity of a French adaptation of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) as compared to other coma scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness scale (FOUR) and the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM). Multi-centric prospective study. To test concurrent validity and diagnostic sensitivity, the four behavioural scales were administered in a randomized order in 77 vegetative and minimally conscious patients. Twenty-four clinicians with different professional backgrounds, levels of expertise and CRS-R experience were recruited to assess inter-rater agreement. Good concurrent validity was obtained between the CRS-R and the three other standardized behavioural scales. Inter-rater reliability for the CRS-R total score and sub-scores was good, indicating that the scale yields reproducible findings across examiners and does not appear to be systematically biased by profession, level of expertise or CRS-R experience. Finally, the CRS-R demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity to detect MCS patients, as compared to the GCS, the FOUR and the WHIM. The results show that the French version of the CRS-R is a valid and sensitive scale which can be used in severely brain damaged patients by all members of the medical staff.\n\nManagement of chest pain in the French emergency healthcare system: the prospective observational EPIDOULTHO study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCharpentier, Sandrine; Beaune, Sebastien; Joly, Luc Marie; Khoury, Abdo; Duchateau, FranÃ§ois-Xavier; Briot, Raphael; Renaud, Bertrand; Ageron, FranÃ§ois-Xavier\n\n2017-07-18\n\nThe aim of this paper was to describe the epidemiology, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that emergency physicians use to manage patients presenting with chest pain at all three levels of the French emergency medical system - that is, dispatch centres (SAMUs: the medical emergency system), which operate the mobile intensive care units (MICUs), and hospitals' emergency departments (EDs), with a focus on acute coronary syndrome (ACS). All patients with chest pain who contacted a SAMU and/or were managed by a MICU and/or were admitted into an ED were included in a 1-day multicentre prospective study carried out in January 2013. Data on diagnostic and therapeutic management and disposition were collected. An in-hospital follow-up was performed. In total, 1339 patients were included: 537 from SAMU, 187 attended by a MICU and 615 in EDs. Diagnosing ACS was the main diagnostic strategy of the French emergency care system, diagnosed in 16% of SAMU patients, 25% of MICU patients and 10% of ED patients. Among patients calling the SAMU, 76 (14%) received only medical advice, 15 (8%) patients remained at home after being seen by a MICU and 454 (74%) were discharged from an ED. Management of chest pain at the three levels of the French medical emergency system is mainly oriented towards ruling out ACS. The strategy of diagnostic management is based on minimizing missed diagnoses of ACS.\n\nThe new system of review by multicentre research ethics committees: prospective study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTully, Joanna; Ninis, Nelly; Booy, Robert; Viner, Russell\n\n2000-01-01\n\nObjective To assess the function of the new system of review by multicentre research ethics committees and to highlight areas where improvement is still needed. Design Prospectively collected data from a multicentre study was examined with respect to the ethics review process. Administrative, financial, and time elements of the review process were audited. Setting A single multicentre research ethics committee and 125 local ethics committees from six regions of England. Main outcome measures Time to reply, time to approval, and number of non-local changes to the application requested. Results Only 40% of local ethics committees considered our study in the manner specified in the 1998 directive. Less than a third of committees replied within the 21 day period stipulated, although committees acting by executive subcommittee replied more quickly than those not acting by executive subcommittee. There was a tendency for executive subcommittees to approve studies in a shorter time. Local ethics committees asked for a large number of non-local changes to the application. The financial cost of applying to multiple ethics committees remains high, mainly because multiple copies of research applications are being requested. Conclusions The new system of approval by multicentre research ethics committee for multicentre studies was introduced to reduce administrative costs, speed up the process of reviews by multiple research ethics committees, and standardise the conclusions of the local research ethics committees. Since its introduction an improvement has been seen, but the system is not yet universally functioning as intended. Ethics review still remains a hindrance to the financial resources and commencement of national studies. We strongly support the structure of review by multicentre research ethics committees but suggest that the system has yet to achieve its aims. PMID:10784541\n\nAre power calculations useful?

Data from these calibration experiments are sufficient to make estimates of statistical power and predictions of sample size and minimum observable effect sizes. In this technical note, we suggest how previously reported voxel-based power calculations can support decision making in the design, execution and analysis of cross-sectional multicentre imaging studies. The choice of MRI acquisition sequence, distribution of recruitment across acquisition centres, and changes to the registration method applied during data analysis are considered as examples. The consequences of modification are explored in quantitative terms by assessing the impact on sample size for a fixed effect size and detectable effect size for a fixed sample size. The calibration experiment dataset used for illustration was a precursor to the now complete Medical Research Council Autism Imaging Multicentre Study (MRC-AIMS). Validation of the voxel-based power calculations is made by comparing the predicted values from the calibration experiment with those observed in MRC-AIMS. The effect of non-linear mappings during image registration to a standard stereotactic space on the prediction is explored with reference to the amount of local deformation. In summary, power calculations offer a validated, quantitative means of making informed choices on important factors that influence the outcome of studies that consume significant resources.

It is a valuable method for the improvement of exercise tolerance. Some studies reported a similar improvement with quadricipital electrical myostimulation, but the effect of combined exercise training and electrical myostimulation in cardiac heart failure has not been yet evaluated in a large prospective multicentre study. Purpose The aim of this study was to determine whether the addition of low frequency electrical myostimulation to exercise training may improve exercise capacity and/or muscular strength in cardiac heart failure patients. Methods Ninety-one patients were included (mean age: 58âÂ±â9 years; New York Heart Association II/III: 52/48%, left ventricular ejection fraction: 30âÂ±â7%) in a prospective French study. The patients were randomised into two groups: 41 patients in exercise training and 50 in exercise trainingâ+âelectrical myostimulation. All patients underwent 20 exercise training sessions. In addition, in the exercise trainingâ+âelectrical myostimulation group, patients underwent 20 low frequency (10 Hz) quadricipital electrical myostimulation sessions. Each patient underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test, a six-minute walk test, a muscular function evaluation and a quality of life questionnaire, before and at the end of the study. Results A significant improvement of exercise capacity (Î peak oxygen uptake+15% in exercise training group and +14% in exercise trainingâ+âelectrical myostimulation group) and of quality of life was observed in both groups without statistically significant differences between the two groups. Mean creatine kinase level increased in the exercise training group whereas it remained stable in the combined group. Conclusions This prospective multicentre study shows that electrical myostimulation on top of exercise training does not demonstrate any significant\n\nTranscatheter Closure of Patent Foramen Ovale in Patients with Platypnea-Orthodeoxia: Results of a Multicentric French Registry\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGuerin, P.; Lambert, V.; Godart, F.\n\nBackground. Dyspnea and the decrease in arterial saturation in the upright position in elderly subjects is described as platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS). POS is secondary to the occurrence of an atrial right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Methods. This French multicentric study reports on 78 patients (mean age 67 {+-} 11.3 years) with POS who had transcatheter closure of the PFO; frequently associated diseases were pneumonectomy (n = 36) and an ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 11). In all patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by transthoracic or/and transesophageal echocardiography. Five different closure devices were used: Amplatz (n = 45),moreÂ Â» Cardioseal (n = 13), Sideris (n = 11), Das Angel Wings (n = 8) and Starflex (n = 1). Closure was successful in 76 patients (97%). Results. Oxygen saturation increased immediately after occlusion from 84.6 {+-} 10.7% to 95.1 {+-} 6.4% (p < 0.001) and dyspnea improved from grade 2.7 {+-} 0.7 to grade 1 {+-} 1 (p < 0.001). A small residual shunt was immediately observed in 5 patients (3 with the Cardioseal device, 1 with the Sideris and 1 with the Amplatz) leading to the implantation of a second device in one case (Cardioseal). Two early deaths occurred unrelated to the procedure (one due to sepsis probably related to pneumonectomy, another due to respiratory insufficiency). Other complications were: a small shunt between the aorta and the left atrium, two atrial fibrillations and a left-sided thrombus which disappeared with anticoagulant therapy. At a mean follow-up of 15 {+-} 12 months, there were 7 late deaths related to the underlying disease. Conclusion. Percutaneous occlusion of the foramen ovale is safe and gives excellent results thanks to continuing improvement in available devices. This technique enables some patients in an unstable condition to avoid a surgical closure.Â«Â less\n\nCross-sectional multicentre study on the cohort of all the French junior lecturers in general practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarais, Marie; Laporte, Catherine; Schuers, Matthieu; Saint-Lary, Olivier; FrappÃ©, Paul; Dibao-Dina, Clarisse; Darmon, David; Bouchez, Tiphanie; Gelly, Julien\n\n2018-12-01\n\nGeneral practice became an academic discipline quite recently in many western countries. In France, junior lecturer work is specified in a three-part mandate: medical work in general practice, teaching in the university, and research. Since 2007, 130 junior lecturers have been appointed in general practice. The aim of the creation of junior lecturer status was to align general practice with other specialties and to develop research and education in primary care. To describe the healthcare, teaching and research undertaken by junior lecturers in general practice, practising in October 2014. A cross-sectional multicentre study using an online self-administered questionnaire on the cohort composed of all the junior lecturers in general practice with open questions and the qualitative analysis of written verbatim accounts. Of the 95 junior lecturers practising at the date of the study, 75 (79%) responded; average age 32 years; gender ratio (F/M) 2.4:1. They spent five, two and three half-days per week respectively in healthcare, teaching and research. The healthcare activity was predominantly carried out in the community (73%). Thirty-nine per cent worked as part of a multi-professional team taking on 50 consultations per week. Most of the educational work involved lecturing and mentoring students specializing in general practice (median 86âhours per year). Research output increased during the fellowship. Research topics were varied and relevant to the disciplinary field. During the fellowship, the balancing, and even the reinforcement, of healthcare and research contributions were accompanied by a significant investment in educational provision.\n\n[Kidney transplantectomy: a multicenter study of the Committee of Transplantation of the French Urology Association].\n\nPubMed\n\nLechevallier, E\n\n1995-04-01\n\nMulticentre study of the Transplantation Committee of the Association FranÃ§aise d'Urologie (French Urology Association) concerning the attitudes of various French transplantation centres in relation to renal transplantectomy. Nine centres participated in this study: Bordeaux, Brest, Grenoble, Marseille, Nantes, Paris-Necker, Paris-La PitiÃ©, Strasbourg and Toulouse. The survey was performed by means of 2 types of forms: study of transplantectomies performed between 1982 and 1992, specific study of transplantectomies performed in 1992. From 1982 to 1992, 731 transplantectomies were performed in these centres, i.e. 15% of all renal transplantations. Rejection represented 80% of the indications and vascular complications represented 15%. The technique used before the 6th week was complete removal of the transplant. After this period, the transplant was removed via a subcapsular approach. The postoperative mortality was 0.7% and the morbidity was 26%. In 1992, 91 transplantectomies were performed in these different centres. Forty-two per cent of the transplants presented with local signs and 38% with general signs. A subcapsular transplantectomy was performed in 84% of cases, for rejection in every case. The morbidity was 16%. Complete removal of the transplant was performed in 16% of cases, essentially for infectious complications. The morbidity was 7%. The renal transplantectomy technique must be adapted to the interval after transplantation: before the 6th week, the transplant must be completely removed; after this period, subcapsular transplantectomy must be performed. This operation therefore no longer carries the mortality and morbidity attributed to it.\n\nManaging multicentre clinical trials with open source.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaptis, Dimitri Aristotle; Mettler, Tobias; Fischer, Michael Alexander; Patak, Michael; Lesurtel, Mickael; Eshmuminov, Dilmurodjon; de Rougemont, Olivier; Graf, Rolf; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Breitenstein, Stefan\n\n2014-03-01\n\nMulticentre clinical trials are challenged by high administrative burden, data management pitfalls and costs. This leads to a reduced enthusiasm and commitment of the physicians involved and thus to a reluctance in conducting multicentre clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to develop a web-based open source platform to support a multi-centre clinical trial. We developed on Drupal, an open source software distributed under the terms of the General Public License, a web-based, multi-centre clinical trial management system with the design science research approach. This system was evaluated by user-testing and well supported several completed and on-going clinical trials and is available for free download. Open source clinical trial management systems are capable in supporting multi-centre clinical trials by enhancing efficiency, quality of data management and collaboration.\n\nCross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale for use in French-speaking populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nAngers, Magalie; Svotelis, Amy; Balg, Frederic; Allard, Jean-Pascal\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) is a self-administered score specific for ankle osteoarthritis (OA) with excellent reliability and strong construct and criterion validity. Many recent randomized multicentre trials have used the AOS, and the involvement of the French-speaking population is limited by the absence of a French version. Our goal was to develop a French version and validate the psychometric properties to assure equivalence to the original English version. Translation was performed according to American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2000 guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation. Similar to the validation process of the English AOS, we evaluated the psychometric properties of the French version (AOS-Fr): criterion validity (AOS-Fr v. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] and SF-36 scores), construct validity (AOS-Fr correlation to single heel-lift test), and reliability (AOS-Fr test-retest). Sixty healthy individuals tested a prefinal version of the AOS-Fr for comprehension, leading to modifications and a final version that was approved by C. Saltzman, author of the AOS. We then recruited patients with ankle OA for evaluation of the AOS-Fr psychometric properties. Twenty-eight patients with ankle OA participated in the evaluation. The AOS-Fr showed strong criterion validity (AOS:WOMAC r = 0.709 and AOS:SF-36 r = -0.654) and construct validity (r = 0.664) and proved to be reliable (test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.922). The AOS-Fr is a reliable and valid score equivalent to the English version in terms of psychometric properties, thus is available for use in multicentre trials.\n\nMulticentre study for validation of the French addictovigilance network reports assessment tool\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHardouin, Jean Benoit; Rousselet, Morgane; Gerardin, Marie; Guerlais, MarylÃ¨ne; Guillou, Morgane; Bronnec, Marie; SÃ©bille, VÃ©ronique; Jolliet, Pascale\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAims The French health authority (ANSM) is responsible for monitoring medicinal and other drug dependencies. To support these activities, the ANSM manages a network of 13 drug dependence evaluation and information centres (Centres d'Evaluation et d'Information sur la PharmacodÃ©pendance â Addictovigilance â CEIPâA) throughout France. In 2006, the Nantes CEIPâA created a new tool called the EGAP (Echelle de GrAvitÃ© de la PharmacodÃ©pendanceâ drug dependence severity scale) based on DSM IV criteria. This tool allows the creation of a substance use profile that enables the drug dependence severity to be homogeneously quantified by assigning a score to each substance indicated in the reports from health professionals. This article describes the validation and psychometric properties of the drug dependence severity score obtained from the scale ( Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01052675). Method The validity of the EGAP construct, the concurrent validity and the discriminative ability of the EGAP score, the consistency of answers to EGAP items, the internal consistency and inter rater reliability of the EGAP score were assessed using statistical methods that are generally used for psychometric tests. Results The total EGAP score was a reliable and precise measure for evaluating drug dependence (Cronbach alpha = 0.84; ASI correlation = 0.70; global ICC = 0.92). In addition to its good psychometric properties, the EGAP is a simple and efficient tool that can be easily specified on the official ANSM notification form. Conclusion The good psychometric properties of the total EGAP score justify its use for evaluating the severity of drug dependence.

Prophylactic treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) decreases the incidence of febrile neutropenia, the rate of hospitalization, and the use of antibiotics in patients at risk. The aim of this study was to assess efficacy, safety, and use of Zarzio(Â®)-biosimilar of Neupogen(Â®) (G-CSF; filgrastim)-in prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in current practice in cancer patients. We conducted an observational, prospective, longitudinal, and multicentric study in France. The incidence of neutropenia was evaluated at each cycle of chemotherapy. One hundred eighty-four patients (women, 64.7 %; mean age, 61.7 years) with solid tumor (89.7 %; breast cancer, 50.5 %) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (10.3 %) were included. The risk of febrile neutropenia based on chemotherapy regimen was >20 % for 32.1 % of patients. No case of febrile neutropenia was reported. Neutropenia was the cause of hospitalization and/or antibiotic therapy in 10 patients. The most frequent adverse events related to Zarzio(Â®) were pain, in particular bone pain. No serious adverse event related to Zarzio(Â®) was reported. The results obtained in real-life conditions confirm that Zarzio(Â®) is efficient and well tolerated in cancer patients.\n\nWhich psychoactive substances are used by patients seen in the healthcare system in French overseas territories? Results of the OPPIDUM survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaveluy, AmÃ©lie; Frauger, Elisabeth; PeyriÃ¨re, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Moracchini, Christophe; Haramburu, FranÃ§oise; Micallef, JoÃ«lle\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAddiction to illicit substances or medicines is influenced by cultural, religious, ethnic factors as well as local availability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the profile of drug users and characteristics of the psychoactive substances used in French overseas territories, using data from the OPPIDUM survey. OPPIDUM is an annual, nationwide, multicentric, cross-sectional study based on specialized care centres that included subjects presenting a drug addiction or under opiate maintenance treatment. The current study includes data from the 2012 and 2013 surveys and focuses on patients included by drug addiction centres located in French overseas departments and territories: French Pacific Ocean (French Polynesia, New Caledonia), French Americas (Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, French Guiana) and Reunion Island. Data from metropolitan France (2013 survey) were included as reference. Two hundred and forty-five patients were included. The sex ratio was 3.7 for the Pacific Ocean, 3.5 for the French Americas and 3.3 for Reunion Island. Cannabis was consumed in all the territories, from 50.8% in Reunion Island to 81.7% in Pacific Ocean. Cocaine was most frequently consumed in the French Americas (61%), mainly in the 'freebase' form (91%), whereas 6.5% of cocaine users in metropolitan France did so. Problematic use of medicines was most frequent in Reunion Island. Heroin seems rarely used in all overseas territories. This study highlights the complexity of substances used in French overseas territories, which often differ from that in mainland France. The relative difference between different areas provides valuable information for future investigations and possible interventions.

While French registries are the standard references, the question arises: are data stemming solely from the activity of French cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) a true reflection of the entire French population with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)? To compare data on patients hospitalized for STEMI from two French registries: the French registry of acute ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (FAST-MI) and the Ãchantillon gÃ©nÃ©raliste des bÃ©nÃ©ficiaires (EGB) database. We compared patients treated for STEMI listed in the FAST-MI 2010 registry (n=1716) with those listed in the EGB database, which comprises a sample of 1/97th of the French population, also from 2010 (n=403). Compared with the FAST-MIÂ 2010 registry, the EGB database population were older (67.2Â±15.3 vs 63.3Â±14.5Â years; P<0.001), had a higher percentage of women (36.0% vs 24.7%; P<0.001), were less likely to undergo emergency coronary angiography (75.2% vs 96.3%; P<0.001) and were less often treated in university hospitals (27.1% vs 37.0%; P=0.001). There were no significant differences between the two registries in terms of cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities and drug treatment at admission. Thirty-day mortality was higher in the EGB database (10.2% vs 4.4%; P<0.001). Registries such as FAST-MI are indispensable, not only for assessing epidemiological changes over time, but also for evaluating the prognostic effect of modern STEMI management. Meanwhile, exploitation of data from general databases, such as EGB, provides additional relevant information, as they include a broader population not routinely admitted to cardiac ICUs.

We aimed to assess the clinical effect of systematic implementation of molecular assays to improve sarcoma misdiagnosis. In this multicentre, observational study, we recruited patients from 32 centres of the French Sarcoma Group/Reference Network in Pathology of Sarcomas. Eligibility criteria included: biopsy or surgical resection; suspicion of: dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (cohort 1), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (cohort 2), Ewing's sarcoma family of tumours (cohort 3), synovial sarcoma (cohort 4), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (cohort 5), and myxoid or round cell liposarcoma (cohort 6); review by one sarcoma-expert pathologist; availability of frozen material (except for cohort 1 of patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans because anti-CD34 immunohistochemistry is performed on paraffin-embedded tissue); and patient information. For each case, the pathologist made one primary diagnosis followed by up to two differential diagnoses, based on histological characteristics only. Each diagnosis was classified as certain, probable, or possible. For each case to determine the molecular classification, we did fluorescence in-situ hybridisation on paraffin-embedded samples. We also did comparative genomic hybridisation and quantitative PCR (cohort 2) or reverse transcriptase PCR (cohorts 3-6) on frozen and paraffin-embedded samples. We made a final diagnosis based on the molecular results. The clinical effect of diagnosis correction was assessed by a board of experts. Between June 22, 2009, and Oct 30, 2012, 395 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 384 were eligible for inclusion. The diagnosis was eventually modified by molecular genetics for 53 patients: eight (16%) of 50 patients with dermatofibrosarcoma (cohort 1), seven (23%) of 30 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (cohort 2), 13 (12%) of 112 with Ewing's sarcoma family of tumours (cohort 3), 16\n\n[A study on English loan words in French plastic surgery].\n\nPubMed\n\nHansson, E; Tegelberg, E\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe French language is less and less used as an international scientific language and many French researchers publish their work in English. Nowadays, Annales de Chirurgie Plastique EsthÃ©tique is the only international plastic surgical journal published completely in French. The use of English loan words in French plastic surgery has never been studied. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency and types of English loan words in French plastic surgery. A corpus consisting of all the articles in a number of Annales de Chirurgie Plastique Esthethique, chosen by default, was created. The frequency of English loan words was calculated and the types of words were analysed. The corpus contains 367 (0.8%) English loan words. Most of them are non-integrated loan words and calques. The majority of the plastic surgical loan words describe surgical techniques. The French plastic surgical language seems to be influenced by English. The usage of loan words does not always follow the recommendations and the usage is sometimes ambiguous. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Multi-centre research is commonplace in the health care system. However, IRECs continue to fail to differentiate between research and quality audit projects. The National Benchmarks and Evidence-based National Clinical guidelines for Heart failure management programmes study used an investigator-developed questionnaire concerning a clinical audit for heart failure programmes throughout Australia. Ethical guidelines developed by the National governing body of health and medical research in Australia classified the National Benchmarks and Evidence-based National Clinical guidelines for Heart failure management programmes Study as a low risk clinical audit not requiring ethical approval by IREC. Fifteen of 27 IRECs stipulated that the research proposal undergo full ethical review. None of the IRECs acknowledged: national quality assurance guidelines and recommendations nor ethics approval from other IRECs. Twelve of the 15 IRECs used different ethics application forms. Variability in the type of amendments was prolific. Lack of uniformity in ethical review processes resulted in a six- to eight-month delay in commencing the national study. Development of a national ethics application form with full ethical review by the first IREC and compulsory expedited review by subsequent IRECs would resolve issues raised in this paper. IRECs must change their ethics approval processes to one that enhances facilitation of multi-centre research which is now normative process for health services. The findings of this study highlight inconsistent ethical requirements between different IRECs. Also highlighted are the obstacles and delays that IRECs create when undertaking multi-centre clinical audits\n\nUnicompartmental knee arthroplasty modes of failure: wear is not the main reason for failure: a multicentre study of 418 failed knees.\n\nPubMed\n\nEpinette, J-A; Brunschweiler, B; Mertl, P; Mole, D; Cazenave, A\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThis study originated from a symposium held by the French Hip and Knee Society (SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise de la hanche et du genou [SFHG]) and was carried out to better assess the distribution of causes of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) failures, as well as cause-specific delay to onset. Our working hypothesis was that most failures were traceable to wear occurring over a period of many years. A multicentre retrospective study (25 centres) was conducted in 418 failed UKAs performed between 1978 and 2009. We determined the prevalence and time to onset of the main reasons for revision surgery based upon available preoperative findings. Additional intraoperative findings were analysed. The results were compared to those of nation wide registries to evaluate the representativeness of our study population. Times to revision surgery were short: 19% of revisions occurred within the first year and 48.5% within the first 5 years. Loosening was the main reason for failure (45%), followed by osteoarthritis progression (15%) and, finally, by wear (12%). Other reasons were technical problems in 11.5% of cases, unexplained pain in 5.5%, and failure of the supporting bone in 3.6%. The infection rate was 1.9%. Our results were consistent with those of Swedish and Australian registries. Our hypothesis was not confirmed. The short time to failure in most cases suggests a major role for surgical technique issues. Morbidity related to the implant per se may be seen as moderate and not greater than with total knee prostheses. The good agreement between our data and those of nationwide registries indicates that our population was representative. A finer analysis is needed, indicating that the establishment of a French registry would be of interest. Copyright Â© 2012.

The objective of this study was to define a standard French version of the ESAS (F-ESAS) to determine the psychometric properties in French-speaking patients. In a first pilot study, health professionals (nÂ = 20) and patients (nÂ = 33) defined the most adapted terms in French (F-ESAS). In a prospective multicentric study, palliative care patients completed the three forms of F-ESAS (F-ESAS-VI, F-ESAS-VE, and F-ESAS-NU, where VI is visual, VE, verbal, and NU, numerical), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. All patients had a test-retest evaluation during the same half-day. Standardized distraction material was used between each scale. One hundred twenty-four patients were included (mean age [Â±SD]: 68.3Â Â±Â 12; 70 women; 54Â men). Test-retest reliability was high for all three F-ESAS, and the correlation between these scales was nearly perfect (Spearman rsÂ =Â 0.66-0.91; PÂ <Â 0.05). F-ESAS-VI, F-ESAS-VE, and F-ESAS-NU performed similarly and were equally reliable, although there was a trend toward lower reliability for F-ESAS-VI. Correlation between F-ESAS depression and anxiety and HADS depression and anxiety, respectively, were positive (Spearman rsÂ =Â 0.38-0.41 for depression; Spearman rsÂ =Â 0.48-0.57 for anxiety, PÂ <Â 0.05). Among patients, 59 (48%), 45 (36%), and 20 (16%) preferred to assess their symptoms with F-ESAS-VE, F-ESAS-NU, and F-ESAS-VI, respectively. The F-ESAS is a valid and reliable tool for measuring multidimensional symptoms in French-speaking patients with an advanced cancer. All forms of F-ESAS performed well with a trend for better psychometric performance for F-ESAS-NU, but patients preferred the F-ESAS-VE. Copyright Â© 2017.

Rather than the number of punctures, the volume of blood drawn is considered paramount in efficient and reliable detection of microorganisms. We performed a 1-year prospective multicentre study in adult emergency departments of three French university hospitals comparing two methods for BCs: a unique blood culture (UBC) collecting a large volume of blood (40 mL) and the standard method of multiple blood cultures (MBC). The performances of both methods for bacterial contamination and efficient microbial detection were compared, each patient serving as his own control. Amongst the 2314 patients included, three hundred were positive for pathogens (n=245) or contaminants (n=55). Out of the 245 patients, 11 were positive for pathogens by UBC but negative by MBC and seven negative by UBC but positive by MBC (p 0.480). In the subgroup of 137 patients with only two BCs, UBC was superior to MBC (p 0.044). Seven and 17 patients had contaminated BCs by UBC and MBC only, respectively (p 0.062). Considering the sums of pathogens missed and contaminants, UBC significantly outperformed MBC (p 0.045). Considering the complete picture of cost savings, efficient detection of microorganisms and decrease in contaminations, UBC offers an interesting alternative to MBC.

Most cases of 47, XXX and 47, XYY syndromes are diagnosed in this context, and parents are thus faced with an unexpected situation. The objective of the present study was to characterize a French cohort of prenatally diagnosed cases of 47, XXX and 47, XYY and to evaluate the termination of pregnancy (TOP) rate before and after France's implementation of multidisciplinary centres for prenatal diagnosis in 1997. This retrospective study identified respectively 291 and 175 cases of prenatally diagnosed 47, XXX and 47, XYY between 1976 and 2012. For each case, the indication, maternal age, karyotype and outcome were recorded. Most diagnoses of the two conditions were fortuitous. The occurrence of 47, XXX was associated with advanced maternal age. The overall TOP rate was higher for 47, XXX (22.9%) than for 47, XYY (14.6%), although this difference was not statistically significant. However, the TOP rates fell significantly after 1997 (from 41.1% to 11.8% for 47, XXX and from 25.8% to 6.7% for 47, XYY). The TOP rates after prenatal diagnoses of 47, XXX and 47, XYY fell significantly after 1997, following France's implementation of multidisciplinary centres for prenatal diagnosis.

To evaluate anterolateral ligament (ALL) stabilisation during revision ACL reconstruction. ALL stabilisation during revision ACL reconstruction provides good rotational stability without increasing the risk of complications. This multicentre study included 349 patients, 151 retrospectively and 198 prospectively. There were 283 males and 66 females. Inclusion criteria were an indication for revision ACL reconstruction surgery with combined intra-articular reconstruction and ALL stabilisation after failed autograft ACL reconstruction, and intact PCL. Exclusion criteria were primary ACL reconstruction and concomitant peripheral medial and/or lateral lesions. Each patient underwent a clinical and radiographic evaluation before and after revision surgery. Before revision surgery, the mean IKDC score was 56.5Â±15.5 and 96% of patients were IKDC C or D. Rates were 5.0% for early and 10.5% for late postoperative complications. Lachmann's test had a hard stop at last follow-up in 97% of patients. The pivot-shift test was positive in 1% of patients.

The proportions of patients with radiographic knee osteoarthritis at last follow-up was unchanged for the lateral tibio-femoral and patello-femoral compartments but increased by 9.7% to 21.2% for the medial tibio-femoral compartment. The re-rupture rate was 1.2% and the further surgical revision rate was 5.4%. Anterior laxity at last follow-up was consistent with previous studies of revision ACL reconstruction. However, rotational stability and the re-rupture risk were improved. ALL stabilisation is among the techniques that deserve consideration as part of the therapeutic options for revision ACL reconstruction.

To investigate outcomes in patients with ES, and their relationship with PAH-SDT. Retrospective, observational, nationwide, multicentre cohort study. We included 340Â patients with ES: genetic syndrome (n=119; 35.3%); pretricuspid defect (n=75; 22.1%). Overall, 276 (81.2%) patients received PAH-SDT: monotherapy (endothelin receptor antagonist [ERA] or phosphodiesteraseÂ 5 inhibitor [PDE5I]) 46.7%; dual therapy (ERA+PDE5I) 40.9%; triple therapy (ERA+PDE5I+prostanoid) 9.1%. Median PAH-SDT duration was 5.5Â years [3.0-9.1Â years]. Events (death, lung or heart-lung transplantation) occurred in 95 (27.9%) patients at a median age of 40.5Â years [29.4-47.6]. The cumulative occurrence of events was 16.7% [95% confidence interval 12.8-21.6%] and 46.4% [95% confidence interval 38.2-55.4%] at age 40 and 60Â years, respectively. With age at evaluation or time since PAH diagnosis as time scales, cumulative occurrence of events was lower in patients taking one or two PAH-SDTs (P=0.0001 and P=0.004, respectively), with the largest differences in the post-tricuspid defect subgroup (P<0.001 and P<0.02, respectively) versus patients without PAH-SDT. By multivariable Cox analysis, with time since PAH diagnosis as time scale, New York Heart Association/World Health Organization functional classÂ III/IV, lower peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and pretricuspid defect were associated with a higher risk of events (P=0.002, P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively), and one or two PAH-SDTs with a lower risk of events (P=0.009). Outcomes are poor in ES, but seem better with PAH-SDT. ES with pretricuspid defects has worse outcomes despite the delayed disease onset. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, studies investigating this have been predominantly single-centre. As clinical trials are likely to be multisite, further studies are required to determine whether associations with cognition of similar strengths can be detected in a multicentre setting. One hundred and nine patients (mean age =68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and nÂ° lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with global cognition (standardized Î² =0.268), mental flexibility (Î² =0.306), verbal fluency (Î² =0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Î² =0.273). The magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review. In this multicentre study, we confirmed associations between DTI parameters and cognition, which were similar in strength to those found in previous single-centre studies. The present study supports the use of DTI metrics as biomarkers of disease progression in multicentre studies.

Our purpose was to make an inventory on the use of SoMe within urologists members of the French Urological Association (AFU). A 15 questions-survey was sent by email 2 months to urologists AFU members before the 108th French Congress of Urology (#CFU2014). At the same time, the activity of urologists using Twitter was analyzed over the period of the national conference with the symplur software (www.symplur.com). Overall, 270 (17.3%) surveys were completed. Only 50% of responders had an online SoMe account. The most commonly used social media platforms were: Facebook (36.1%) followed by LinkedIn (28.2%), Google+ (19.6%), YouTube (18.7%) and Twitter (17.4%). The use of SoMe was higher in the age groups 30-40 and 40-50 years than in older age groups (83% versus 36%). Only 38.7% of respondents reported using SoMe in a professional field. At the congress #CFU2014, there were over 1000 tweets generated by 173 different contributors. Only a minority of French urologists have reported to be connected to SoMe and a predominantly personal use. The emergence of Twitter in French urological conferences is very new but seems promising. Further studies are needed, especially within the members of the residents French urological association to better characterize the true impact of SoMe in urology. 4.

From May 2004 to June 2010 we retrospectively identified 51 treatment-naÃ¯ve GBM patients with available clinical information from the Samsung Medical Center data registry. Multicentricity of the tumor was defined as the presence of multiple foci on the T1 contrast enhancement of MR images or having high signal for multiple lesions without contiguity of each other on the FLAIR image. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that multicentric GBM had worse prognosis than solitary GBM (median, 16.03 vs. 20.57 months, p < 0.05). Copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed there was an increase in 11 regions, and a decrease in 17 regions, in the multicentric GBM. Gene expression profiling identified 738 genes to be increased and 623 genes to be decreased in the multicentric radiophenotype (p < 0.001). Integration of the CNV and expression datasets identified twelve representative genes: CPM, LANCL2, LAMP1, GAS6, DCUN1D2, CDK4, AGAP2, TSPAN33, PDLIM1, CLDN12, and GTPBP10 having high correlation across CNV, gene expression and patient outcome. Network and enrichment analyses showed that the multicentric tumor had elevated fibrotic signaling pathways compared with a more proliferative and mitogenic signal in the solitary tumors. Noninvasive radiological imaging together with integrative radiogenomic analysis can provide an important tool in helping to advance personalized therapy for the more clinically aggressive subset of GBM.

A prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Tenon University Hospital, Paris, France. Patients with MRI-suspected colorectal endometriosis scheduled for colorectal resection from April 2014 to February 2016 were included. Patients underwent both 1.5-Tesla MRI and MRE as well as laparoscopically assisted and open colorectal resections. The diagnostic performance of MRI and MRE was evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs). The interobserver variability of the experienced and junior radiologists was quantified using weighted statistics. Forty-seven patients were included. Twenty-two (46.8%) patients had unifocal lesions, 14 (30%) had multifocal lesions, and 11 (23.4%) had multicentric lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive LR, and negative LR for the diagnosis of multifocal lesions were 0.29 (6/21), 1.00 (23/24), 15.36, and 0.71 for MRI and 0.57 (12/21), 0.89 (23/25), 4.95, and 0.58 for MRE. The sensitivity, specificity, positive LR, and negative LR for the diagnosis of multicentric lesions were 0.18 (1/11), 1.00 (1/1), 15, and 0.80 for MRI and 0.46 (5/11), 0.92 (33/36), 5.45, and 0.60 for MRE. Lower accuracies for MRI compared with MRE to diagnose multicentric (pâ=â.01) and multifocal lesions (pâ=â.004) were noted. The interobserver agreement for MRE was good for both multifocality (Îºâ=â0.80) and multicentricity (Îºâ=â0.61). MRE has better accuracy for diagnosing multifocal and multicentric bowel endometriosis than conventional MRI. Copyright Â© 2018.

By partially replicating and extending past investigations conducted in America, Australia, Britain, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, and New Zealand, it was predicted that there would be more gender stereotyping in French television advertisements and less gender stereotyping in Danish television advertisements. In the first study, 165 French television advertisements were analyzed by following established coding categories (A. Furnham & E. Skae, 1997; L. Z. McArthur & B. G. Resko, 1975). Contrary to prediction, the results showed that traditional gender role portrayal on French television was no different from that found in other countries. Separate statistical analyses were carried out for visually versus aurally classified central figures, yet this yielded relatively few significant differences. In the second study, a sample of 151 Danish advertisements was analyzed; results showed that Danish television was generally less gender stereotypic than French television in its portrayal of women. Exactly half (5) of the coding categories showed significant differences. Finally, an international statistical comparison between these two studies and similar research in Australia, Britain, and Italy was carried out. The methodological implications of these results are discussed as well as the theoretical issues arising from other studies of this sort.\n\nLearning to Read in English and French: Emergent Readers in French Immersion\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nChung, Sheila Cira; Koh, Poh Wee; Deacon, S.

Therefore we wanted to assess the actual costs of IVHR. The total costs are the sum of direct (hospital costs) and indirect (sick leave) costs. The direct costs were retrieved from a multi-centric cost analysis done among a large panel of 51 French public hospitals, involving 3239 IVHR. One hundred and thirty-two unitary expenditure items were thoroughly evaluated by the accountants of a specialized public agency (ATIH) dedicated to investigate the costs of the French Health Care system. The indirect costs (costs of the post-operative inability to work and loss of profit due to the disruption in the ongoing work) were estimated from the data the Hernia Club registry, involving 790 patients, and over a large panel of different Collective Agreements. The mean total cost for an IVHR in France in 2011 was estimated to be 6451â¬, ranging from 4731â¬ for unemployed patients to 10,107â¬ for employed patients whose indirect costs (5376â¬) were slightly higher than the direct costs. Reducing the incidence of incisional hernia after abdominal surgery with 5Â % for instance by implementation of the European Hernia Society Guidelines on closure of abdominal wall incisions, or maybe even by use of prophylactic mesh augmentation in high risk patients could result in a national cost savings of 4 million Euros.\n\nFood risk assessment for perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated flame retardants in the French population: results from the second French total diet study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRiviÃ¨re, G; Sirot, V; Tard, A; Jean, J; Marchand, P; Veyrand, B; Le Bizec, B; Leblanc, J C\n\n2014-09-01\n\nTo determine the exposure of the French population to toxic compounds contaminating the food chain, a total diet study was performed in France between 2007 and 2009. This study was designed to reflect the consumption habits of the French population and covered the most important foods in terms of consumption, selected nutrients and contribution to contamination. Based on French consumption data, the present study reports the dietary exposure to perfluoroalkyl acids (16 congeners) and brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, hexabromocyclododecane and polybrominated biphenyls). Comparison of the calculated dietary exposures with the generally accepted health-based guidance values revealed that most compounds do not pose any risk. There are however knowledge gaps for some congeners in these large chemical classes. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We sought to describe temporal trends in demographic and clinical characteristics, indications for intensive care and outcome in this patient population. We conducted a cohort study of unselected HIV-infected patients admitted between 1999 and 2010 to 34 French ICUs contributing to the CUB-RÃ©a prospective database. We included 6,373 consecutive patients. Over the 12-year period, increases occurred in median age (39 years in 1999-2001; 47 years in 2008-2010, p < 0.0001) and prevalence of comorbidities (notably malignancies, from 6.7 to 16.4%, p < 0.0001). Admissions for respiratory failure (39.8% overall), shock (8.1%) and coma (22.7%) decreased (p < 0.0001), while those for sepsis (19.3%) remained stable. The main final diagnoses were bacterial sepsis (24.6%) and non-bacterial acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining diseases (steady decline from 26.0 to 17.5%, p < 0.0001). Patients increasingly received mechanical ventilation (from 42.9 to 54.0%) and renal replacement therapy (from 9.6 to 16.8%) (p < 0.0001), whereas vasopressor use remained stable (27.4%). ICU readmissions increased after 2004 (p < 0.0001). ICU and hospital mortality (17.6 and 26.9%, respectively) dropped markedly in the most severely ill patients requiring multiple life-sustaining therapies. Malignancies and chronic liver disease were heavily associated with hospital mortality by multivariate analysis, while the most common AIDS-defining complications (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, cerebral toxoplasmosis and tuberculosis) had no independent impact. Progressive ageing, increasing prevalence of comorbidities (mainly malignancies), a steady decline in AIDS-related illnesses and improved benefits from life-sustaining therapies were the main temporal trends in HIV-infected patients requiring ICU admission.\n\nConducting a paediatric multi-centre RCT with an industry partner: challenges and lessons learned.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaskell, Jessica; Newcombe, Peter; Martin, Graham; Kimble, Roy\n\n2012-11-01\n\nThere are many benefits of multi-centred research including large sample sizes, statistical power, timely recruitment and generalisability of results. However, there are numerous considerations when planning and implementing a multi-centred study. This article reviews the challenges and successes of planning and implementing a multi-centred prospective randomised control trial involving an industry partner. The research investigated the impact on psychosocial functioning of a cosmetic camouflage product for children and adolescents with burn scarring. Multi-centred studies commonly have many stakeholders. Within this study, six Australian and New Zealand paediatric burn units as well as an industry partner were involved. The inclusion of an industry partner added complexities as they brought different priorities and expectations to the research. Further, multifaceted ethical and institutional approval processes needed to be negotiated. The challenges, successes, lessons learned and recommendations from this study regarding Australian and New Zealand ethics and research governance approval processes, collaboration with industry partners and the management of differing expectations will be outlined. Recommendations for future multi-centred research with industry partners include provision of regular written reports for the industry partner; continual monitoring and prompt resolution of concerns; basic research practices education for industry partners; minimisation of industry partner contact with participants; clear roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders and utilisation of single ethical review if available.

One of the major consequences of this increased interest has been the development of several definitions and measures of exercise dependence. The work of Veale [Does primary exercise dependence really exist? In: Annet J, Cripps B, Steinberg H, editors. Exercise addiction: Motivation for participation in sport and exercise.Leicester, UK: Br Psychol Soc; 1995. p. 1-5.] provides an advance for the definition and measure of exercise dependence. These studies have adapted the DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence to measure exercise dependence. The Exercise Dependence Scale-Revised is based on these diagnostic criteria, which are: tolerance; withdrawal effects; intention effect; lack of control; time; reductions in other activities; continuance. Confirmatory factor analyses of EDS-R provided support to present a measurement model (21 items loaded in seven factors) of EDS-R (Comparative Fit Index=0.97; Root mean Square Error of Approximation=0.05; Tucker-Lewis Index=0.96). The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of a French version of the EDS-R [Factorial validity and psychometric examination of the exercise dependence scale-revised. Meas Phys Educ Exerc Sci 2004;8(4):183-201.] to test the stability of the seven-factor model of the original version with a French population. A total of 516 half-marathoners ranged in age from 17 to 74 years old (Mean age=39.02 years, ET=10.64), with 402 men (77.9%) and 114 women (22.1%) participated in the study. The principal component analysis results in a six-factor structure, which accounts for 68.60% of the total variance. Because principal component analysis presents a six-factor structure differing from the original seven-factor structure, two models were tested, using confirmatory factor analysis. The first model is the seven-factor model of the original version of the EDS-R and the second is the\n\nMulti-centric universal pseudonymisation for secondary use of the EHR.\n\nPubMed\n\nLo Iacono, Luigi\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses the importance of protecting the privacy of patient data kept in an Electronic Health Record (EHR) in the case, where it leaves the control- and protection-sphere of the health care realm for secondary uses such as clinical or epidemiological research projects, health care research, assessment of treatment quality or economic assessments. The paper focuses on multi-centric studies, where various data sources are linked together using Grid technologies. It introduces a pseudonymisation system which enables a multi-centric universal pseudonymisation, meaning that a patient's identity will result in the same pseudonym, regardless of which participating study center the patient data is collected.\n\nMulticentre study of allergic contact cheilitis from toothpastes.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrancalanci, S; Sertoli, A; Giorgini, S; Pigatto, P; Santucci, B; Valsecchi, R\n\n2000-10-01\n\nThe present work reports the results of a multicentre study of toothpaste allergic contact cheilitis (TACC) conducted by GIRDCA (Gruppo Italiano Ricerca Dermatiti da Contatto e Ambientali). The study examined 54 patients with eczematous lesions on the lips, the possible cause of which was suspected to be the use of toothpastes. Patch tests were conducted with a standard series, a specially-targeted series (toothpaste cheilitis series, TCS), and with suspected toothpaste(s). A stop-restart test (SRT) was carried out with these, together with a use test to identify possible alternative products. The TCS produced 17 positive reactions in 13 patients, the most frequent being to spearmint oil. Of the 54 patients, 5 displayed positive reactions only to the TCS. The patch tests with toothpaste produced positive reactions in 11/32 patients, the SRT a positive response in 10/12 cases. The diagnosis of TACC was confirmed in 15/54 patients. Alternative products were identified for 5 patients. In conclusion, the allergens most frequently responsible for TACC were the flavourings, and the additional series proved to be useful in many cases (together with patch tests with toothpastes and the SRT) for correct diagnosis and to initiate effective prevention.\n\nRevisiting the Robustness of PET-Based Textural Features in the Context of Multi-Centric Trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nBailly, ClÃ©ment; Bodet-Milin, Caroline; Couespel, SolÃ¨ne; Necib, Hatem; Kraeber-BodÃ©rÃ©, FranÃ§oise; Ansquer, Catherine; Carlier, Thomas\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the variability of textural features (TF) as a function of acquisition and reconstruction parameters within the context of multi-centric trials. The robustness of 15 selected TFs were studied as a function of the number of iterations, the post-filtering level, input data noise, the reconstruction algorithm and the matrix size. A combination of several reconstruction and acquisition settings was devised to mimic multi-centric conditions. We retrospectively studied data from 26 patients enrolled in a diagnostic study that aimed to evaluate the performance of PET/CT 68Ga-DOTANOC in gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Forty-one tumors were extracted and served as the database. The coefficient of variation (COV) or the absolute deviation (for the noise study) was derived and compared statistically with SUVmax and SUVmean results. The majority of investigated TFs can be used in a multi-centric context when each parameter is considered individually. The impact of voxel size and noise in the input data were predominant as only 4 TFs presented a high/intermediate robustness against SUV-based metrics (Entropy, Homogeneity, RP and ZP). When combining several reconstruction settings to mimic multi-centric conditions, most of the investigated TFs were robust enough against SUVmax except Correlation, Contrast, LGRE, LGZE and LZLGE. Considering previously published results on either reproducibility or sensitivity against delineation approach and our findings, it is feasible to consider Homogeneity, Entropy, Dissimilarity, HGRE, HGZE and ZP as relevant for being used in multi-centric trials.\n\nElective frozen elephant trunk procedure using the E-Vita Open Plus prosthesis in 94 patients: a multicentre French registry.\n\nPubMed\n\nVerhoye, Jean-Philippe; Belhaj Soulami, Reda; Fouquet, Olivier; Ruggieri, Vito Giovanni; Kaladji, Adrien; Tomasi, Jacques; Sellin, Michel; Farhat, Fadi; Anselmi, Amedeo\n\n2017-10-01\n\nOur goal was to evaluate the operative outcomes of the frozen elephant trunk technique using the E-Vita Open PlusÂ® hybrid prosthesis in chronic aortic arch diseases and report clinical and radiological outcomes at the 1-year follow-up. As determined from a prospective multicentre registry, 94 patients underwent frozen elephant trunk procedures using the E-Vita Open Plus hybrid device for the treatment of chronic aortic conditions, including 50% chronic aortic dissections, 40% degenerative aneurysms and 10% miscellaneous indications. Fifty percent of the cases were reoperations. The perioperative mortality rate was 11.7%. Spinal cord ischaemia and stroke rates were 4% and 9.6%, respectively. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 252âÂ±â97âmin, cardiac ischaemia time was 152âÂ±â53âmin and cerebral perfusion time was 82âÂ±â22âmin. Concomitant procedures were observed in 15% of patients. Among the 83 surviving patients, the survival rate after the 1-year follow-up was 98%. Eleven percent of patients underwent endovascular completion, whereas 4% of patients required aortic reintervention at 1âyear. The E-Vita Open Plus hybrid device confirms the favourable short- and mid-term outcomes offered by its predecessor in frozen elephant trunk procedures in patients with chronic aortic arch disease. Implantation of the E-Vita Open Plus is associated with good 1-year survival rates, good rates of favourable aortic remodelling in both chronic dissection and degenerative aneurysms and a reproducible technique in a multicentre registry. Continued follow-up is required due to the risk of evolution at the downstream aorta. Â© The Author 2017.

Causes of death for French Olympic athletes and female elite athletes have not been studied. We aimed to measure overall and disease-specific mortality of French female and male Olympians compared with the French general population. We hypothesize that Olympians, both women and men, have lower mortality rates. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. French elite athletes (601 women and 1802 men) participating in summer or winter Olympic Games from 1948 to 2010 had their vital status verified by national sources and were followed until 2013. Causes of death were obtained via the National Death registry from 1968 to 2012. Overall and disease-specific mortalities of Olympians were compared with those of the French general population through standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% CIs. Olympians' observed and expected survivals were illustrated by Kaplan-Meier curves. At the endpoint of the study, 13 women and 222 men had died. Overall mortality in Olympians compared with that of their compatriots was 51% lower (SMR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.85) among women and 49% lower (SMR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.45-0.59) among men. Olympic athletes' survival is significantly superior to that of the French general population (women, P = .03; men, P < .001). According to the total deaths occurring from 1968 to 2012 (12 among women, 202 among men), female Olympians died from neoplasm (50.0%), external causes (33.3%), and cardiovascular diseases (16.6%). The main causes of death among men were related to neoplasms (36.1%), cardiovascular diseases (24.3%), and external causes (14.4%). Regarding the main causes of mortality among male Olympic athletes, the SMRs were as follows: 0.55 for neoplasms (95% CI, 0.43-0.69), 0.55 for cardiovascular diseases (95% CI, 0\n\nHarmonization Process and Reliability Assessment of Anthropometric Measurements in the Elderly EXERNET Multi-Centre Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGÃ³mez-Cabello, Alba; Vicente-RodrÃ­guez, GermÃ¡n; Albers, Ulrike; Mata, Esmeralda; Rodriguez-Marroyo, Jose A.; Olivares, Pedro R.; Gusi, Narcis; Villa, Gerardo; Aznar, Susana; Gonzalez-Gross, Marcela; CasajÃºs, Jose A.; Ara, Ignacio\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground The elderly EXERNET multi-centre study aims to collect normative anthropometric data for old functionally independent adults living in Spain. Purpose To describe the standardization process and reliability of the anthropometric measurements carried out in the pilot study and during the final workshop, examining both intra- and inter-rater errors for measurements. Materials and Methods A total of 98 elderly from five different regions participated in the intra-rater error assessment, and 10 different seniors living in the city of Toledo (Spain) participated in the inter-rater assessment. We examined both intra- and inter-rater errors for heights and circumferences. Results For height, intra-rater technical errors of measurement (TEMs) were smaller than 0.25 cm. For circumferences and knee height, TEMs were smaller than 1 cm, except for waist circumference in the city of CÃ¡ceres. Reliability for heights and circumferences was greater than 98% in all cases. Inter-rater TEMs were 0.61 cm for height, 0.75 cm for knee-height and ranged between 2.70 and 3.09 cm for the circumferences measured. Inter-rater reliabilities for anthropometric measurements were always higher than 90%. Conclusion The harmonization process, including the workshop and pilot study, guarantee the quality of the anthropometric measurements in the elderly EXERNET multi-centre study. High reliability and low TEM may be expected when assessing anthropometry in elderly population.

In French guidelines, ALND is still recommended in case of macrometastasis in sentinel lymph node (SLN) and in case of micrometastasis without systemic treatment. We performed a survey of the French practices in the management of the axilla. A questionnaire was sent to 454Â breast surgeons between JuneÂ 2014Â and January 2015. Questionnaire included items about: indications of SLN biopsy, frequency of ALND in case of metastatic SLN and modality of radiotherapy in case of metastatic SLN without ALND. A total of 169Â surgeons (37%) answer the questionnaire. Twenty-one percent of surgeons avoid ALND in case of macrometastasis. Thirty-two percent do not perform extemporaneous examination of SLN. Only 8.4% of practionners performed a SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Fourteen percent performed a SLN biopsy in case of multicentric tumors, while it is not recommended. In case of positive SLN without ALND completion, radiotherapy does not change in 34% while irradiation fields are expanded in 44%. Significant unconformities are observed towards national recommendations. The divergence between French and international guidelines leads to heterogeneous surgical practices.

Methods The robustness of 15 selected TFs were studied as a function of the number of iterations, the post-filtering level, input data noise, the reconstruction algorithm and the matrix size. A combination of several reconstruction and acquisition settings was devised to mimic multi-centric conditions. We retrospecti"
