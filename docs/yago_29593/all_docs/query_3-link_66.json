        "text": "Joan always seemed like a cunt to me. Michael seemed pretty nice, despite all of his personal problems.\n\nThe catfight scene between Alexis and Dex had to be one of funniest things ever on the show.\n\nR25- you are woefully misinformed. Joan LOATHED John Forsythe, and he loathed her. She’s gone on the record many times discussing her animus. Found him sexist and rude. She famously hijacked the mic at the Golden Globes when Dynasty won Best Drama (gotta love the HFPA) and he went ham on her backstage after. I didn’t know she and Michael didn’t get along… hadn’t heard that.\n\nWhen he relapsed in the late 90s, I wonder how La Looch handled that. She’s such a straight edge. They seem like an odd pair in real life.\n\n[quote] We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted,” said Lister. “Recently, Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of ‘Dynasty’ during Emma Samms’ virtual event to help raise funds for long-COVID research. He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.” Nader died in his northern California home and the cause of death was an incurable type of cancer.\n\n[quote] Nader previously had a drug problem and came clean about it in 1984. He became sober in 1980, however, was charged with drunk driving in 1997. In 2001, he was arrested for attempting to sell cocaine to an undercover police officer, The Post reported.\n\nI loved him and Joan Collins together on Dynasty.\n\nHe was probably why I learned the word debonaire, because I thought he exemplified it as Dex Dexter. But I had the meaning incorrect. I just looked it up, and I must have had it wrong all this time. His character wasn't so \"chipper.\" He was smooth and sophisticated, though. I think I wanted to change my name to Dexter because of him.\n\nHe learned of his cancer diagnosis ten days before he died. Horrible.\n\nRIP.\n\nThis is the interview Gordon Thomson did that pissed off Joan Collins in 2017 - before they got along really well\n\nBut while Thomson and Collins “got along like a house,” she did not with John Forsythe and Linda Evans, according to Thomson.\n\n“Joan didn’t like Linda because Linda was loved. She was a star effortlessly. Joan was at best a Grade B movie star, and she always wanted to be a huge star. She knew she was three or four on the totem pole of English brunettes, at the top of which was her friend Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n“Joan had a wonderful sex life, marriages, and kids, and she arrived on Dynasty with a lot of résumé. Joan knew Alexis was ‘kapow’ and dug all 10 fingernails into the part and went with it. It was a big treat to watch. I was told Aaron said to her, ‘You saved my show,’ and she did.”\n\nWhen Forsythe found out Collins had posed for Playboy when she turned 50, he stormed to Spelling’s office to complain, says Thomson. “I just thought how bloody good she looks, bravo!”\n\n“Joan was jealous of Linda,” says Thomson. “Linda was not the actress Joan was and is, and was just effortlessly adored by everybody on set, off set, the public. I have never met a more sympathetic, empathic, generous, gorgeous-looking human in my life. She was miraculous, and the audience knew that.”\n\nAt the time of \"The Colbys\" spinoff, Joan Collins was asked if there would be any crossover scenes with Barbara Stanwyck. Collins said that she hoped so and added it would wonderful to work with someone who understood the acting discipline of \"Old Hollywood\", giving the impression that was something she and Stanwyck had in common.\n\nWhen Barbara was told of this, she said to the reporter who mentioned it, \"Really? Oh, I don't think we'll be working together at all.\" Then she gave a chuckle as though the idea was absurd.\n\nI always felt like Gordon Thomsom got cast when some of Dynasty's senior production team was still taking the show seriously. (And hadn't gotten the memo.) He was attractive but not striking and I never thought at actor who leapt out at you (on screen.) He seemed like a \"we need an actor\" choice, not an Aaron Spelling choice, which the show was very quickly sliding to. I feel like he was a last gasp of the Shapiros before they gave up/sold out. That was the Kathleen Beller season too. I mean, who the hell casts Kathleen Beller except people labouring under the delusion they're casting a dra-ma?\n\nR133 I don’t think they mingled much. I have never seen a photo of them together and unless it was mentioned as a point of trivia, I never saw Michael listed as one of George’s survivors in his 2002 obits. Even the LA Times only mentions survivors as Mark Miller and “three cousins.”\n\nMichael’s father left the family when he was a baby and his mother, Minette, relocated them from St. Louis to California. I’m not even sure if Minette was George’s sister, or sister-in-law, but I suspect the latter. Regardless, it would not have escaped them that George Nader was a movie star with a Universal contract. Universal did a huge amount of publicity for their stars and really had the hottest men and women under contract for quite a run in the 1950s.\n\nAs for George, he had a bad accident in 1970 which damaged his eyes and pretty much ended his waning career. I think Rock was extremely generous to them.\n\nR150\n\nBy all accounts George Nader and his partner Mark Miller were closest thing Rock Hudson had to family for much of his adult life. MM of course became Rock Hudson's personal secretary, and the couple remained very close to RH and staunch allies right up to his death from HIV/AIDs related causes.\n\nThe first alone was reason enough for Rock Hudson to leave Mark Miller a sizable legacy from his estate.\n\nGeorge Nader and Mark Miller were comfortable with being gay and quite happy with their sexuality and being a couple. When studio sat GN down and told him to put Mark Miller away or his career would be over, he pulled a Billy Haines and told them to fuck off. Rock Hudson probably appreciated the sort of steady influence close gay friends like that gave.\n\nOf course by time his diagnoses was made public knowledge and people were either abandoning Rock Hudson, or at least keeping him at a distance, George Nader and his partner never waivered. Have to give them much credit for such dedication.\n\nBrendad Ickson came through with a steamy photo and this post on IG. She must truly be bereft, as she didn't include her usual dozen emojis.\n\n\"My friend Mike Nader has passed onto the heavens. I am suprized to hear of his passing. He was a great actor. And always a good friend to people he worked with. This is a Photo from my book \"My True Hidden Hollywood Story. \" We did a play at the Beverly Hills playhouse. Which Tennessee Williams was involved in. Directed by Clyde Ventura. RIP Mike Nader.\"\n\nMichael Nader was arrested at Save The Robots club back in 2001. Recall reading it in NYT at the time and thinking \"he's still around\"?\n\nNYC's \"war on drugs\" in clubs that was launched in wake of 1996 drama involving Michael Alig carried on well into early 2000's. Using nuisance abatement and other laws NYPD was raiding this or that club every week it seemed. Gay. trans and other non-mainstream places seemed to be be prime targets.\n\nNYPD has a press office where among other things details are released of those arrested. Heaven help you if you're anyone remotely famous, are employed at some place well known, etc.... NYPD will feed your arrest to media all in good name of it being public information.\n\nR42 et al\n\nBy time Rock Hudson arrived on Dynasty he was already ill from HIV/AIDS though no one yet knew exactly what was wrong. He always had problems remembering lines so use of cue cards wasn't first give away, but it was clear Rock Hudson wasn't well. His character was supposed to run as a reoccurring one, but lasted about one year before RH left Dynasty.\n\nThus think by that time RH wasn't interested in tapping Michael Nader's ass. More to point as we've been discussing Mark Miller, partner of Michael Nader's uncle George Nader was not only great friends with RH, but his personal secretary. George Nader may or may not have been close to his nephew at that time, but am sure one or both would have warned RH off. Not because of the illness you understand, but because Michael Nader gave no indication of swinging that way at all.\n\nR193\n\nBoth Mark Miller and his partner George Nader knew of Rock Hudson's HIV status. Everyone was going into a tizzy because Rock had to kiss Linda Evans and there wasn't a way out. No one also bothered to tell Rock Hudson's then lover Marc Christian either. George Nader and others felt Mr. Christian couldn't be trusted and might become a loose cannon.\n\nIIRC cast of Dynasty, Aaron Spelling, et al all found out same way rest of world did; when RH made that press announcement from a hospital in France.\n\nr177 I too remember reading that piece and being shocked it was Nader (\"is that...Dex Dexter?\")\n\nBut that was not Save the Robots. STR was on Avenue B and it was only illegal for a hot minute in the mid 80s, before they got a license. The club Nader was arrested in could have been one of illegal after hours speakeasies that popped up from time to time. They usually had no sign outside and you just heard about them. They might have even \"borrowed\" the Robot name for some residual brand recognition although by the mid 1990s STR was closed permanently.\n\nThe last time I was there was in '91 or '92. A friend and I were followed around by a bouncer who treated us like we were 10 year old shoplifters in a toy store. We wanted to find a corner to do some blow because that was supposed to be the place to do it. He kept following us around and literally wagging his finger. There had been too much infamy in the press about Robots and it was on the NYPD's radar.\n\nNader's arrest was in early 2001 and the address cited was 310 East Second Street...very close to original Robots. By early 2001 the East Village was in the throes of gentrification. Between that and the post-Alig busts you mention, it seemed particularly boneheaded to sell bags of coke in a club.\n\nR117\n\nThat's odd, because everything one has read said Joan Collins expressely and firmly refused to appear on or be involved with \"The Colbys\".\n\nSince we've opened up that can of worms, a bit of trivia.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck originally came out of retirement to do season one, and six or seven episodes in season two. By end of season one however fed up with how her character Constance Colby was developing and the show itself the great Barbara Stanwyck demanded and obtained release from The Colbys. She famously called the series \"a turkey\" and \"The biggest pile of garbage I ever did\". When you consider Ms. Stanwyck's long career, that's saying something.\n\nMs. Stanwyck also demanded that her character be killed off so there wasn't a chance Constance Colby could return. At end of season one \"Connie\" (as Sable liked to refer to her MIL), was off on a world cruise somewhere.\n\nFaye Dunaway was originally offered the role of Sable Colby (eventually played by Stephanie Beacham), but her high salary demands shut down negotiations. Later, Diana Rigg and Susannah York also turned the role down. Would have liked to see what Diana Rigg would have done with Sable Colby. That would have been interesting television.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck famously also called The Colbys \"vulgar\". Stephanie Beacham referred to it as a load of \"cobblers\".\n\nKate O'Mara (another great British actress who does bitch so well) auditioned for a role of Sable Colby, but ended up on Dynasty as sister of Alexis Morrell Carrington Colby Dexter...\n\nDynasty at first was very entertaining, whole \"go-go 1980's\" Ronald and Nancy Reagan in WH years and all that. But even that show was wearing thin, and introduction of \"The Colbys\" was just piling on. It was nothing more than vulgar \"lifestyles of the rich and famous\" trash with a healthy helping of how wealthy white men (and their wives) run (or ran) this country.\n\nAs wont to happen with high rated television shows everyone thought Dynasty (number one in ratings at the time) should have and could carry a spin off, so there you are.\n\nYou have to wonder what the Carringtons and Colbys would make of who has bucket loads of money today. Big Tech Bros like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and the rest could by and sell Blake Carrington, and get change back.\n\nEach episode of \"The Colbys\" cost $1 million (USD) to produce. Ms. Stanwyck received $75k per episode, and Charlton Heston $85k per.. One wonders if it was the money that lured Barbara Stanwyck out of retirement. In any event it wasn't enough to keep her around, so guess that old adage about not paying someone enough to do something rang true.\n\nCost of producing The Colbys series was one of reasons the series got the hook.\n\nPart of Beverly Leslie on W&G we all know was played by Leslie Jordan. Joan Collins was originally cast to play the role of Karen Walker's arch enemy. However she refused to have her wig torn off during that fight between Karen and Beverly, so that was that.\n\nSee linked clip at 8:40..\n\nNow that one thinks about it someone should snatch one of those wigs off Ms. Collin's head. It would be a hoot.\n\n[quote]Anyone remember Anton (Dimitris Son on AMC) who was played by the male model\n\nRudolf Martin. He posted about Nader's passing.\n\nRIP Michael Nader ! I was fortunate to play his son for 2 years on \"All My Children\" in New York in the 90s. He was already an icon to me (Dex Dexter on Dynasty) but so very kind and welcoming for which I was grateful. I mostly remember his love for dogs and his humor, it was often hard to keep a straight face when working with him. Later he rented my old apartment on 10th street as I moved within the same building and so we were friends and neighbors for a while. This photo is from that time. After I moved to LA we lost touch. I will always remember him fondly. Condolences to his family.\n\nMichael Nader was so cute on Gidget, hot on Dynasty, and sexy as Dimitri on AMC.\n\nLoved when Dimitri rescued Natalie from the well. Nader and Kate Collins were great together and could have been a long running couple, but the fans wanted her with the disgusting James Kiberd. It worked out for Lucci, as she and Nader were also great together and Dimitri was really Erica’s best husband.\n\nOn the short lived AMC Hulu reboot, they paired him with Julia Barr, and it was a good fit. Two older pros who knew how to play a scene.\n\nDamn, I miss AMC."
