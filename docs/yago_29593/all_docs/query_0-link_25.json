        "text": "For images from this time period, visit Erica's Biography.\n\nIn 1990, Bianca (who was magically now 4 years old) fell ill with Reye’s Syndrome. It was a transformative experience for Erica, who realized that she’d willingly give her own life to save her daughter’s. Bianca recovered, telling her parents that seeing them together at her bedside made her feel better. Erica was happy with Jack, but Travis wanted her back. She was torn between the two brothers, and even went so far as to openly date them on alternating nights!\n\nAlthough her heart was truly with Jack, Bianca wanted her parents back together, and Erica reluctantly remarried Travis in 1990 to try to give her daughter the family she never had.\n\nAround this time, Erica’s father sold off the Enchantment stock she’d given him, took the money and left town abruptly, leaving Erica abandoned a second time. It seemed her relationship with her father would never be resolved in a positive way.\n\nShortly after Erica and Travis remarried, Barbara admitted to Travis that her little girl, Molly Cudahy, was really his daughter, not Tom’s – and that Molly had leukemia. Erica handled the news of Molly’s paternity remarkably well, even permitting Bianca to be tested as a potential bone marrow donor. Erica attempted to build a happy life with Travis, but he turned down her request to have a second child together because he was secretly planning to conceive another baby with Barbara instead, in the hopes that child would be a match for Molly. Instead of an insemination, Travis and Barbara conceived the old-fashioned way, and when a devastated Erica found out, she sought comfort in Jack’s arms.\n\nErica planned to divorce Travis and marry Jack, but she dragged her feet, not wanting to devastate Bianca. Her attempts to protect her daughter failed miserably when Bianca witnessed Erica and Jack kissing and set fire to her dollhouse in anger. When Travis found out about the kiss, he went to confront Erica and found her in Jack’s bed. An angry Travis filed for divorce and sued for full custody of Bianca.\n\nDuring the custody trial, Erica lied on the stand and claimed that she and Jack had only slept together once – the night Travis caught them – because she believed it would make her look better. When Jack was called to testify, he refused to perjure himself and back up Erica’s lie. Travis was awarded full custody of Bianca, and he moved to Seattle with Barbara and Molly and baby Matthew.\n\nErica and Jack’s relationship crumbled after Bianca moved away, and Erica threw herself into her work at Enchantment. She began a relationship with the new “Man of Enchantment,” Charlie Brent. Charlie was the son of Phil Brent and Tara Martin – in other words, he had once been Erica’s stepson. In addition, he was the biological grandchild of her former lover, Nick Davis. To say that their families disapproved of the relationship would be an understatement! Erica and Charlie got engaged, but on the eve of the wedding, Erica broke off the relationship.\n\nShe realized that she still loved Jack, who by that time had moved on with her nemesis Brooke English. Erica engaged in a variety of schemes to try to regain Jack’s attention and affection. She even apologized for her behavior during Bianca’s custody trial and accepted full responsibility for the loss of her daughter, telling Jack she regretted asking him to lie for her.\n\nShe was aided in her schemes in part by her ex-husband Adam Chandler. Adam had been married to Brooke as well and convinced Erica he wanted Brooke back. Erica managed to get Jack alone in New York City as the Plaza Hotel (ostensibly on business), and had him back in her arms when Adam arranged for Jack to find out just how Erica had manipulated the situation. Fed up with her lies and schemes, Jack stormed out, and Adam was left alone to face Erica’s enormous fury. After taking out her anger on Adam – and on the hotel suite – an emotional Erica was floored to find out that Adam deliberately sabotaged her seduction of Jack because he wanted her all for himself.\n\nIf Adam’s stunt in New York surprised Erica, then she was absolutely stunned when Adam revealed that Stuart had taken his place at their Caribbean divorce years ago, meaning they were still legally wed. Erica was horrified to discover that her marriages to Travis were null and void, that she’d inadvertently committed bigamy, and that her daughter Bianca was illegitimate. Adam offered her a choice: remarry him or he’d go public with the sordid tale. In December 1991, Erica donned an outfit more appropriate for a funeral than a wedding and remarried Adam.\n\nAs if her marriage to Adam wasn’t enough, Erica found herself at risk of losing her company when Enchantment became the target of a hostile takeover from reclusive businessman Dimitri Marick. The takeover attempt failed, but Erica found herself with a new complication: Dimitri was now a major shareholder and wanted to play an on-going role at Enchantment.\n\nThe two fought constantly, but their arguments eventually turned to passion. Unfortunately, Erica was still stuck with Adam, and Dimitri’s not-dead wife was still recovering from a lengthy coma. By the summer of 1992, Erica found herself in the awkward role of the other woman, as she and Dimitri carried out a secret affair. During that same time, her mother Mona was diagnosed with cancer. Erica was terrified of the possibility of losing her mother, but Mona pulled through and the surgery to remove the tumors was successful.\n\nErica and Dimitri got engaged during a breathtaking trip to Budapest, Hungary, where she toured his family’s ancestral home, Vadzel. Unfortunately for Erica, she found herself in the midst of a fight between Dimitri and his new-found brother, Edmund AND Dimitri’s crazy soon-to-be ex-mother-in-law, Helga. Helga locked Erica in a crypt in Budapest and left there to die, but she was saved at the last minute by Dimitri, Edmund and Jack.\n\nThe traumatic experience in Budapest left Erica in a catatonic state. When she awakened from it, she insisted it was 1991, and that she was still engaged to Charlie Brent! While in Budapest, Erica had learned that Dimitri DID sleep with Angelique during their affair (he’d led her to believe otherwise), and she’d then witnessed an embrace between them that she mistook as romantic instead of friendly, so to punish Dimitri, she faked her amnesia, even enlisting Charlie to pretend to be her fiancé again just to torture Dimitri. When Dimitri found out, he was furious, and they broke up. The two couldn’t stay apart though, and after an epic fight at the Valley Inn in spring 1993, the two reconciled and got engaged again.\n\nRough waters were ahead though when a dark-haired waif named Kendall Hart showed up at Erica’s office and promptly fainted. Erica gave the young woman a job as her assistant, perhaps against her better judgment and even let Kendall plan her engagement party to Dimitri.\n\nMona panicked when she spied a small birthmark on the back of Kendall’s neck and enlisted her dear friend Nick Davis to do some digging. Mona explained to Nick that Erica had gone to visit her father in California for her 14th birthday because her father had promised a grand party filled with celebrities. Erica planned the party, but her father never showed up. The only person who arrived that night was a movie actor named Richard Fields. Fields plied a teenaged Erica with champagne and then brutally raped her. According to Mona, Erica told no one about this until months later when she witnessed her daughter getting out of the shower, and she realized right away that Erica was pregnant.\n\nMona told Nick that Erica was too far along for the pregnancy to be terminated so her then-boss (and future husband) Dr. Charles Tyler helped her take Erica to Phoenix for the summer so no one in Pine Valley would realize she was pregnant. In Phoenix, Erica gave birth to a baby girl who was then given up for adoption – but not before Mona held her and noticed the strawberry birthmark on her neck. Nick’s preliminary investigation indicated that Kendall was NOT Erica’s long-lost daughter, so Mona dropped the subject, leaving Erica in the dark.\n\nAfter months of working for Erica – and secretly sabotaging her wedding – an angry Kendall finally spit the truth at Erica and Dimitri: she was the baby girl Erica had given birth to all those years ago. A stunned and equally angry Erica refused to even admit that she had another daughter until Kendall thrust adoption papers in her face. Once she realized who Kendall really was, Erica attempted to protect her from the truth, but she finally admitted to a stunned Kendall that she’d been raped.\n\nErica tried to welcome Kendall into her life as her daughter, but that proved difficult. Mother and daughter barely knew each other, and Kendall and Bianca did not get along. Bianca was hurt and angry to discover that Kendall was really her older sister. Erica invited Kendall to move into Linden House with her and to be a bridesmaid in her wedding.\n\nErica and Dimitri were married in June 1993, but their marriage was troubled from the start. Kendall wanted to know about her biological father, and Dimitri helped her locate him, hoping that knowing what became of him would provide her with closure. It had the opposite effect, and when Erica found out what Dimitri had done, she moved out and filed for divorce. Kendall continued to sabotage her mother’s marriage, culminating in an attempted seduction of Dimitri. When that failed, Kendall told Erica that Dimitri raped her. Erica suffered a post-traumatic psychotic episode and stabbed Dimitri when she hallucinated that he was Richard Fields.\n\nErica went on trial for the attempted murder of her husband in 1994 and was forced to confront her rapist when Kendall brought him to Pine Valley. Kendall realized the truth about her father when he attempted to molest Bianca, and Fields died of a heart attack shortly thereafter. Erica was found not guilty, but she was unable to reconcile with Dimitri.\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Erica began another affair with Jackson Montgomery, who was now married. Jack was by her side when Mona passed away suddenly in her sleep. The death of her mother shocked Erica to her core. Her mother had always been the one constant in her life, and Mona’s death forced Erica to deal with her problems on her own.\n\nJack and Erica got engaged (again) in 1994, but Jack ended the relationship to try to do right by his wife and adopted daughter. Erica and Dimitri reconciled in late 1994, and they remarried in a private Russian Orthodox ceremony at Wildwind on New Year’s Eve 1994.\n\n1995 brought new difficulties for Erica and Dimitri, as her daughter Kendall had married his son Anton. Life was looking up for Erica though as she embarked on a new career as the host of a new television talk show called “The Cutting Edge with Erica Kane.” While filming a fashion stunt on scaffolding for the show, Erica fell and injured her back. She pushed herself to recover faster by relying on pain pills, and she developed an addiction to painkillers.\n\nErica’s addiction was aided by Dr. Jonathan Kinder, who became obsessed with her and continued to supply her with pills even as her family pleaded with her to stop using them. Eventually Erica’s addiction – and interference from Jonathan – drove a wedge between Erica and Dimitri, and he asked Erica for a divorce, hoping it would be a wake-up call for her. Struggling with addiction and unable to cope with her husband’s absence, Erica fell prey to Jonathan’s affections, and they had a brief affair.\n\nErica’s addiction culminated in a disastrous drugged up acceptance speech for the Woman of the Year in Media award in which Erica insulted everyone around her. Her friends and even Dr. Kinder insisted that she needed professional help, so Erica checked into the Betty Ford Center. Once sober, she and Dimitri struggled to repair their relationship, but Jonathan continued to interfere, letting Dimitri know that he’d slept with Erica. In his grief, Dimitri slept with Maria and the two mistakenly believed Dimitri was the father of Maria’s baby.\n\nErica and Dimitri reconciled, but she had no knowledge of Dimitri’s involvement with his sister-in-law. Erica found out she was pregnant by Dimitri in early 1997, and she and Dimitri made plans to marry a third time. During their wedding, Erica doubled over in pain. Dimitri rushed her to the hospital, but there was nothing anyone could do to save their baby: a grief-stricken Erica miscarried.\n\nShe was further devastated to learn about Dimitri’s involvement with Maria. She lured her sister-in-law to a remote cabin on Willow Lake to confront her about the affair. When Maria went into premature labor, Erica had no choice but to help deliver the baby girl she thought was Dimitri’s. Maria, still mistakenly believing the baby was a boy, begged Erica to rush the baby to the hospital. En route, Erica’s car skidded on the ice and off the road into the water. The baby was presumed dead, but Erica retraced her steps and realized that a woman named Esther witnessed the car crash and dove into the water. Esther had saved the baby, and she turned it over to Erica, believing Erica was the mother.\n\nWhen Erica attempted to bring the baby back to Maria and Dimitri, she overheard him say that the perhaps the baby was better off dead, given their affair and how the baby’s existence threatened to ruin both their relationships. A horrified Erica, who had herself been abandoned by her own father, fled Wildwind and decided to keep the baby herself. She staged a fake adoption and told the world that she’d adopted baby Sonya from Russia.\n\nDimitri was thrilled with the news that Erica had ‘adopted’ and he hoped to raise the child with her, but Erica shut him out, still betrayed and hurt over the affair. When Dimitri and Edmund did some digging and realized Erica hadn’t really adopted from Russia, Erica pretended that Esther was Sonya’s birthmother. Erica loved Sonya, but guilt ate away at her, and after a few months – and a brief reconciliation with Jack – she confessed and returned Sonya to a stunned Maria.\n\nErica was arrested and Jack prosecuted her for kidnapping. Erica claimed post-traumatic stress and psychosis as a result of her miscarriage. Just before a verdict was to be announced, Erica changed her plea to guilty and agreed to spend a year in jail. A furious Travis cut off all of Erica’s contact with Bianca, until Bianca turned 18, devastating mother and daughter both. Jack tried to act as an intermediary, but Travis wouldn’t budge.\n\nShortly after getting Sonya (whom Edmund and Maria renamed Maddie) back, Maria died in a plane crash. With Maria dead, Dimitri took custody of Maddie from Edmund and planned to raise his daughter with his new wife, Gloria Marsh. While in jail, Erica realized that Skye Chandler had switched the paternity test results, and she and Jack worked to help Edmund prove paternity and get Maddie back from Dimitri.\n\nSadly, Erica also learned that her daughter Bianca was suffering from anorexia, but she was unable to communicate with Bianca because of Travis’s ban. It was only when Bianca took a turn for the worse that Travis relented and was willing to allow mother and daughter to be together again – if only Erica could get out of jail. When he realized how severe Bianca’s condition really was, Edmund relented and came to Erica’s aid, arguing that she should be released on parole.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Erica was finally released from jail and came home to Linden House to surprise a very sick Bianca. Erica became owner of Enchantment again and even made her daughter second in command at the company in an attempt to bolster her self-worth. Bianca was apprehensive about her mother’s plans to marry her Uncle Jack (they got engaged yet again when Erica was released from jail), and she continued to struggle with her mother’s contentious relationship with Dimitri, a man Bianca had considered a second father. Erica, Jack, Dimitri and Travis all vowed to put aside their differences and get along in Bianca’s best interests.\n\nErica’s plans to marry Jack were derailed in late spring 1998 when the love of her life, Mike Roy, turned up in Pine Valley very much alive. Mike had spent years working undercover for the FBI, and now that his life was no longer in danger, he’d returned to win back Erica’s heart. Mike and Jack spent months each trying to woo Erica. Erica explained to Mike that she’d changed – she’d grown up, had a child of her own and lost her mother – and she wasn’t the same woman she’d been back then, but he still had a large part of her heart.\n\nEventually she tearfully chose to move on with Jack, but she asked Mike to make love to her before he left as a way of bringing closure to their relationship. When Jack found out she’d slept with Mike, he was furious and broke off their relationship (again).\n\nDespite a brief flirtation with Dimitri, Erica declared herself through with men and threw herself into her work at Enchantment. She was planning to return to modeling as the face of Enchantment for a new campaign in early 1999 when she was nearly killed in a car accident with Dr. David Hayward. David’s medical skills saved her life when a piece of metal wiring was embedded in her chest during the accident, but he was unable to do anything about the damage to her face.\n\nErica had a breakdown when she realized that her famous face was permanently and horrifically scarred. She was beyond livid when she finally remembered more details of the accident and remembered that David was speeding through a blizzard to get back to Pine Valley to crash Stuart and Marion’s wedding with the news that Adam was really the father of Liza Colby’s unborn baby.\n\nFurious that her face – and life – had been ruined by David’s need for revenge on Adam and Liza, Erica whacked David over the head and locked him up in her basement, squeezing his operating hand in a vise. She planned to crush his fingers and ruin his career as a heart surgeon, but as they talked, she realized that David had suffered tremendously as a child, just as she had, and David insisted to her that he thought she was beautiful, scars and all. When he realized how badly the accident had wounded Erica emotionally, he asked her to go through with it and crush his hand, but she refused and let him go.\n\nAgainst all odds, the two fell in love. David accompanied Erica to Brazil where a plastic surgeon managed to repair her face, and they began a secret romance in the summer of 1999.\n\nThat summer Erica was also devastated when it appeared that Dimitri had died suddenly, but not before marrying a woman unknown to Pine Valley, Dr. Alex Devane. Dimitri’s death and Erica’s unresolved feelings for him cast a pall over her relationship with David. Erica and David went public with their relationship in November 1999, shortly after he declared his love for her.\n\nAs the 1990s drew to a close, Erica spent her New Year’s Eve with David at the annual Crystal Ball."
