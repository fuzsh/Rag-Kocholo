One day she overhears that they are not her biological parents. She angrily searches for the woman that gave her up for adoption. She finds out that her biological mother is the wealthy cosmetics mogul Erica Kane. She reads Erica's autobiography--which has no mentions of giving a child up for adoption but does mention another daughter that she kept--and heads to Erica’s hometown Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, right when Erica was busy planning a wedding to Count Dimitri Marick. Kendall becomes her executive assistant, hoping that working with her would bring them closer.\n\nShe rented a room at the Fargate Boarding House. Myrtle Fargate discovered paperwork in Kendall’s room linking Kendall to Erica. Kendall begged Myrtle to keep silent about her secret. She wanted to tell Erica the truth on her own time. Being jealous of the attention her half-sister Bianca Montgomery receives after a horse riding accident, Kendall reveals the truth to Erica. Erica’s mother, Mona Kane Tyler revealed that she had recognized Kendall from a birthmark on the back of her neck. Erica began having memories of her rape and the child she put up for adoption. Kendall did not know that she was conceived when Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by movie actor Richard Fields. Erica’s father knew he had a crush on her and arranged for them to be left alone in order to get Richard to appear in a film he was directing.\n\nErica reached out to Kendall and invited her to move in with her at Wildwind. Kendall and the other Kane women celebrated Erica’s marriage to Dimitri. Kendall got off on a rocky start when she locked Bianca in a crypt and then told Erica & Dimitri that she ran away after hearing them arguing about her. When Kendall resolved to find her birth father, Erica cut her out of her life. Kendall was able to convince Dimitri to help her in her search, putting a strain on their marriage.\n\nKendall attempts to seduce Dimitri because she developed a crush on him and because she bitterly and foolishly still wanted Erica to know what it felt to be lonely and abandoned. After he rejects her, Kendall turns to Dimitri’s ward, a medical student from Hungary named Anton Lang. After having sex she returns to Wildwind and tells Erica that Dimitri raped her. Erica was overcome with memories of her own rape and stabbed Dimitri with a letter opener believing him to be Fields. Kendall continued her affair with Anton to remain privy to the goings on in Wildwind. but Dimitri made it clear that he wanted Kendall out of the picture. Kendall was threatened by the arrival of Julia Santos misconstruing Julia’s relationship with Anton to be more than just friendship. Kendall teamed up with Del Henry to write a scathing tell-all book about Erica.\n\nWhen Erica’s trial for stabbing Dimitri came around, Kendall was called as a witness. Dimitri divorced Erica and wanted her in prison for what she did to him but he admitted that he still loved her. On the day of her testimony, Kendall arrived with Richard Fields in tow. On the stand, Kendall lashed out at Erica. She incriminated Erica by saying she stabbed Dimitri out of jealousy because of the attention Dimitri had showered on her. Kendall lied to the jury and said that the only thing she told Erica was that she had unprotected sex with Anton, and was scared that she was pregnant. Kendall believed she was finally getting the revenge that she had wanted. That all changed when Kendall caught Fields attempting to molest Bianca. Kendall turned to Erica and recanted her testimony. Kendall admits the truth to her furious lawyer and was sentenced to prison for six months for perjury.\n\nKendall becomes engaged to Anton while incarcerated. Kendall had the most unlikely of cellmates: Janet Green. Kendall filled Janet in on all that happened in Pine Valley since she left. Kendall was one of the few people who knew Janet had undergone massive reconstructive surgery. Anton breaks it off when he discovered her alliance with Del. When Kendall left prison, she found Janet going by an alias and living with her daughter, Amanda Dillon. Janet confronted Kendall, fearful that she would break her cover. This was the same night a tornado ravished Pine Valley. Kendall was trapped under a fallen beam. Janet made Kendall promise to never tell anyone about her disguise. Kendall agreed. She told Janet she would never do anything to separate a mother from her child.\n\nKendall discovered a dark Marick family secret: Anton was Dimitri’s son. Kendall easily seduced Anton, and they married, technically an incestuous union since his biological father was her stepfather. When Anton learned the truth, he became estranged from Dimitri and his mother, Corvina Lang. Kendall was looking forward to cash in on her husband until she learned Dimitri could shut Anton out of his inheritance because he was an illegitimate heir. Kendall turned to Corvina who was equally interested in cashing in. They worked to make it look like Corvina and Dimitri were switched at birth, making Corvina the legitimate Marick. When Anton discovered Kendall’s scheme, he leaves her for good.\n\nWhen Kendall's grandmother, Mona Kane Tyler died, Kendall was deeply affected and attempted to pay her respects, only to be angrily confronted by Erica, who mistakenly believed that Kendall was faking her grief and had merely come to crash the funeral. Despite Kendall's heartfelt confessions, Erica ordered her to leave, and their argument quickly escalated to physical violence. Later, when visiting Mona's grave, Kendall got into another argument with Dimitri, which climaxed when Kendall demanded to know why he still protected Erica after she stabbed him.\n\nDel and Kendall’s working relationship was always something more. Now that she was divorced, he actively pursued her. Kendall found out Bill Hart had died of a heart attack. She decided to return to Florida to be with Alice. When Del thought he was going to loose Kendall, he proposed marriage so that he could accompany her. Before she left, Kendall and Erica came to an understanding about their relationship.\n\nKendall Quotes:\n\nKendall: I didn’t mean to cause trouble. Honest.\n\nKendall: I didn't want to hurt anyone. I just wanted them to accept me.\n\nKendall to Anton: In the man-woman department, I'm dsyfunctual.\n\nKendall to Erica: You got here pretty quickly. Your broom stick must be turbo-charged.\n\nKendall to Dimitri: I'm the little gift from God she never told you about. I'm her first born.\n\nKendall to Edmund: Am I so terrible for wanting to grieve for one of the only people who ever loved me?!\n\nKendall to Erica: I’m not going anywhere. If you don’t want me here you’re going to have to throw me out.\n\nKendall (about Erica): I'm ready to drive the final nail in her coffin.\n\nAMC characters on Kendall:\n\n\"Oh, I see someone right now and I don't like what I see. You're clearly a very angry and very disturbed young girl.\" -- Erica\n\n\"You wouldn't know the right thing if you tripped over it.\" -- Mr. Tanner\n\n“Maybe very deep hidden under all of those layers of anger and hostility that you have, maybe you have a heart too.” -- Erica\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar on her All My Children days:\n\n\"I chose to see Kendall as misunderstood, which was how, as an actress, I justified her actions. It was amazing, though, playing a psycho-looney.\"\n\n\"I didn't know when I auditioned for Kendall that she would turn out to be who she is. I had heard rumors, but everybody was denying it. Besides, I was scared enough at the thought of working with Susan.\"\n\n\"When they told me I was playing her, I was like, 'What? Daughter? Me?' I remember on my first day when I walked into the rehearsal hall, Susan and Michael were rehearsing a scene. I was very nervous. I kept thinking, 'What if I'm really bad and they fire me?' I just snuck in the back and tried to blend in with the coffee machine, when all of a sudden, Susan said, 'Hold it, we need to stop for a minute. Then she walked over to me and said, 'Congratulations! I'm very glad you're here.' She put her arm around me and said, 'Don't worry, nobody bites.' And then she introduced me to everyone who was there. She really did help me and always made sure I was okay during my first couple of weeks when I was still unsettled. Both Susan and Michael made me feel comfortable.\"\n\n\"I was on All My Children while trying to graduate high school.\"\n\nThe Fans on SMG as Kendall Hart:\n\n\"Sarah is a Genius Actress. I love her forever!\" -- Rainbow8Skull6Girl9\n\n\"The original Kendall! LOVED SMG when she was on AMC and I could never get into the character of Kendall again after she left.\" -- canegirl09\n\n\"I loved SMG in this role and I was crazy about her relationship with Del.\" -- andemcbeal\n\n\"I miss SMG as Kendall. I loved Sarah as Kendall. She is the best Kendall.\" -- Youttubi\n\n\"SMG needs to return to the role of Kendall, Alicia's portrayal is just sickening and annoying. AMC needs to fight for SMG to come back as Kendall.\" -- degrassilnstantstar\n\n\"But no one, no one will ever play Kendall like SMG. There is no question! She can play a bitch like nobody's business!! Alicia is good but Sarah is by far better!\" -- MEE051677\n\n“Oh I loved her as Kendall. She was so great, not to mention - preeetty girl” -- Taake\n\n“I loved SMG as Kendall Hart, so glad she was on AMC when the writing was top notch.” -- Sunnydale Siren\n\n“Sarah (Kendall) NEVER botched her dialogue on AMC (unlike most others).” -- desertshore\n\n“The current Kendall is fine, but for my money Sarah Michelle Gellar will always be THE Kendall.\n\nI'll never forget when she came on that show for the first time. She stole scenes from Susan Lucci, and that's hard to do.” -- nickbigd\n\nLinks:\n\nYouTube - Kendall & Anton Discuss Dimitri\n\nYouTube - Kendall & Anton 1994\n\nYouTube - Kendall & Del-1994\n\nYouTube - Kendall Crashes Mona's Funeral\n\nYouTube - Kendall & Edmund\n\nYouTube - Kendall threatens suicide to Anton\n\nYouTube - Kendall, Anton, & Edmund Part 2\n\nYouTube - Kendall at the Erica's Trial-Part 1\n\nYouTube - Kendall at Erica's Trial-Part 2\n\nYouTube - Erica learns Kendall is her daughter - Spring 1993 (Part 1/5)\n\nYouTube - After Kendall tells Erica she is her daughter - Spring 1993 (Part 1/2)\n\nYouTube - Kendall Motivates Bianca Into a Crypt\n\nTrivia:\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg met Sarah years before playing Buffy's little sister Dawn.
