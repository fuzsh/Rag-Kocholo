        "text": "Watch the 1999 teen smash American Pie and you'll spy Eden Riegel (Bianca)\n\nJerry McGuire actress Renee Zellweger used to have a crush on Pine Valley's own Tad the cad! Renee was hooked on AMC as a teen.\n\nCameron Mathison has a thing for KISS. By his own admission, he just loves Gene Simmons.\n\nWhen Jill Larson (Opal) lived in Paris she took up the modeling profession. The statuesque red-head graced the pages of such magazines as Mademoiselle and Marie Claire.\n\nHe coulda been a contender...er, a lawyer that is. John Callahan (Edmund) was once pre-law at the University of California.\n\nHe's an army man. David Canary (Adam/Stuart) wowed the troops and won the All Army Entertainment Contest for best\n\npopular singer.\n\nHalloween and the police didn't mix well for Cameron Mathison (Ryan) when he and some friends egged his neighbour's house. Parents were called and the kids were scared, though not by the spookiness of the holiday.\n\n~ Rebecca Budig (Greenlee) played Natalie Wood in 1997's James Dean: Race with Destiny. She also made an appearance in 1995's Batman Forever.\n\n~ When Mark Consuelos (Mateo) joined AMC in 1995, co-star Kelly Ripa (Hayley) was smitten. However when Mark escorted Eva LaRue (ex-Maria) to a public function, Kellys hopes were momentarily dashed. Mark and Kelly married secretly in Las Vegas in June 1996 and they share a son, Michael Joseph born in 1997. As for Eva, she ended up with John Callahan (Edmund).\n\n~ In the bible for All My Children, Agnes Nixon gave her young vixen the name of Susan. By the time that a fresh-faced actress named Susan Lucci auditioned for the role, Agnes had decided to name the character Erica.\n\n~ Here is a dramatic case of life imitating art, or perhaps art imitating life. When Susan Lucci was a young woman, she was involved in a car accident in which her face was damaged. Luckily she was able to afford medication attention and the doctors restored her beautiful face. When Agnes penned the story of Ericas car accident and subsequent facial disfigurement, she had no idea of Susans own experience.\n\n~ Gillian Spencer (ex-Daisy) is now an accomplished soap writer, having penned scripts for OLTL and most currently GH.\n\nIn 1996, AMC became the first soap to begin with a recap of the previous days events and to end with a teaser. OLTL and GH followed suit a few months later.\n\nDavid Canary and brother John are descended from the legendary cowgirl Calamity Jane (aka Martha Jane Canary).\n\nElizabeth Taylor began watching AMC while living in Washington DC as the wife of Senator John Warner. She did a guest spot on the show as a surprise for friend and fellow guest Carol Burnett (playing Verla). Burnett was so surprised to see Taylor that she let out an expletive, forcing the scene to be re-shot.\n\nMark Consuelos, born in Spain, learned to speak English partly by watching American soaps, including AMC.\n\nChristopher Lawford, the most recent Charlie Brent, is a Kennedy clan member. His father, British actor Peter Lawford, married JFKs sister Patricia in 1954.\n\nKelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos (Hayley and Mateo) picked on-screen sister Eva LaRue Callahan (Maria) to be the godmother to their son Michael.\n\nMaurice Benard (Nico Kelly, now Sonny Corinthos on GH) changed his name from Mauricio Morales because he felt that he was continually being typecast. Benard was his grandmothers maiden name.\n\nCady McClain (Dixie) didnt get her drivers license until she needed it for a scene in which Dixie hits Billy Clyde Tuggle with her car.\n\nIn 1994, the Martin house was destroyed by an on-screen tornado. A giant engine was used to generate seventy-five mph winds for the scene, which also required ten cameras instead of the usual three. Until its destruction in those scenes, the Martin house was AMCs oldest set still in use.\n\nMichael E. Knight (Tad) is married to Catherine Hickland (currently Lindsay on OLTL).\n\nJames Patrick Stuart, who played Will Cortlandt, is the son of Chad Stuart, who found fame as half of Chad and Jeremy in the 1960s.\n\nLike Phoebe Tyler Wallingford, Ruth Warrick can trace her ancestry back to the Mayflower. She also has legendary frontiersman Daniel Boone in her family history.\n\nCant remember what happened with some storylines or who some of the denizens of Pine Valley were? No wonder: All My Children has taped close to eight thousand episodes!\n\n· Pine Valley is located near Llanview (home of One Life to Live), in Pennsylvania. Most of the outside scenes for All My Children, though, were shot in Connecticut. Cortlandt Manor is actually the Waveny Mansion in New Canaan, and deceased Martins are buried in a small Connecticut cemetery. Seldom seen anymore, Pine Valley University exteriors were shot on the Princeton University campus, in New Jersey. In 1978, AMC became the first soap to film outside the United States, when Erica and Tom Cudahy went to Saint Croix for their honeymoon.\n\n· Speaking of Tom and Erica, lets talk marriages:\n\n· Erica has been married ten times: Jeff Martin, Phil Brent, Tom Cudahy, Adam Chandler, Mike Roy, Travis Montgomery, Travis again, Adam, and Dimitri Marick (twice). Not all these have been legal marriages, but well ignore that for the time being.\n\n· Adam has been married eight times: Althea Chandler, Erica Kane, Brooke English, Dixie Cooney, Natalie Hunter, Erica again, Gloria Marsh and Liza Colby. Brooke, Dixie and Natalie dont count, though, as he was still married to Erica at the time (same reason her ten trips down the aisle dont all count).\n\n· Palmer Cortlandt is no slouch in the marriage department, either. While Adam has made more total trips down the aisle, at least all of Palmers seven weddings were legitimate: Daisy Cortlandt, Donna Beck, Daisy again, Cynthia Preston, Natalie Hunter, Opal Gardner Purdy and Vanessa Bennett.\n\n· Oh, yes, Tom. For a devout Catholic who at one time had been considering the priesthood, Tom is pretty familiar with the sacrament of matrimony: Erica Kane, Brooke English, Skye Chandler, Barbara Montgomery, and Livia Frye.\n\n· Interesting tidbit, speaking of marriages: Jill Larson, who plays Opal Cortlandt, is legally ordained to perform wedding ceremonies. When her sister and brother-in-law were married, she performed the ceremony for them."
