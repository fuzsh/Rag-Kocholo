        "text": "00 23/04/2022 19:42\n\nLa Valle dei Pini - Trama anno 1996\n\nErica was stunned and disheartened to receive divorce papers from her two-time husband, Dimitri Marick. Throughout this ordeal, Erica continued to deny that she was addicted to drugs. However, it was readily apparent to her loved ones that Erica had a problem. When Erica was chosen \"Media Woman of the Year,\" she took center stage and made a complete fool of herself. The audience was aghast as Erica, high on drugs, publicly criticized nearly everyone in the banquet room.\n\nFinally realizing she was an addict, Erica accepted Myrtle's help and checked into the Betty Ford Center for treatment. Erica was still hopeful for a reconciliation with Dimitri, though Dr. Kinder was still a powerful presence in her life.\n\nReturning to Pine Valley, Erica's dreams were realized when she reconciled with Dimitri. However, their reunion was only temporary, thanks to Jonathan Kinder. One night, Jonathan drugged Erica and climbed into bed with her -- knowing that Dimitri would find them together. Seeing Erica in bed with Kinder, Dimitri broke off with Erica. Erica came to realize that Jonathan had drugged her, and she pledged to win back Dimitri.\n\nNoah was found guilty of killing Louie Grecco, then hatched a plan to trap Taylor. Eventually, he escaped jail and went on the run with Julia. They landed in Jamaica. Taylor discovered their whereabouts and headed to track them down. Taylor nearly killed Julia by pushing her over a waterfall. Julia survived, however, and she and Noah came up with a plan to fake their own deaths. The plan nearly backfired, but eventually Noah and Julia set in motion a scheme to make Taylor believe Noah was dead. Noah's \"ghost\" visited a traumatized Taylor and eventually she made a full confession of her sins on tape. With the nightmare finally over, Noah and Julia were married in a surprise fairytale wedding.\n\nOn the set of \"The Cutting Edge,\" someone shot and killed one of the guests, Laurel Dillon. Janet Green became the prime suspect in Laurel's murder, but the killer turned out to be Jason Sheffield who, in his drunken haze, had been aiming to kill fellow talk-show guest, Michael Delaney. Janet was cleared of the charges and Jason was sent to prison.\n\nDixie could not forgive Tad for allowing his thirst for high ratings to get in the way of his better judgement. Along with Liza, Tad had sunk to a new low -- producing sleazy, tabloid TV. In disgust, Dixie left Tad. Tad found comfort with Liza, and they made love. Later, Tad and Dixie reconciled, but their marriage collapsed when Liza's blabbermouthed mother, Marian Colby, broke the news to Dixie about Tad's affair with Liza. Stunned by the news of Tad's liaison with Liza, Dixie fled Pine Valley, settling in her hometown, Pigeon Hollow, West Virginia.\n\nRealizing that she had lost Pierce to Brooke, Janet plotted to steal Brooke's identity. However, she realized the folly of her scheme and abandoned it, also giving up any hope of winning Pierce back. However, Trevor stumbled onto her plan and tried to warn Brooke, but he never made it. Trevor was paralyzed in a car accident. Late in 1996, Pierce left town.\n\nMateo wooed Hayley and eventually convinced her to take a chance on love again. Hayley became conflicted when her first love, Brian Bodine, showed up in Pine Valley, intent on winning her back. She eventually came to see that Mateo was the man for her - and they got engaged. In eager anticipation of their wedding, the lovebirds poured all their energies into their new business, a restaurant called Holidays.\n\nJonathan Kinder was revealed to be Liza Colby's former lover. He had another secret locked away in a church attic -- his wife, Toni (really Skye Chandler). Kinder drugged Skye and kept her imprisoned in a near-comatose haze. Jonathan had been holding Skye hostage because she had incriminating evidence against him. Skye knew about Jonathan's felonious drug experiments and had hidden some key files that could ruin him. Kinder desperately wanted to get his hands on the files. Janet discovered that Jonathan was keeping Skye a prisoner in the attic, and soon after, fell victim to the evil doctor herself when she was held prisoner in the same attic.\n\nEventually, Skye and Janet escaped and teamed up with Kinder's nemesis, Erica to expose the dirty doctor. After a dangerous confrontation in the attic, Dimitri rescued Erica and Skye from Kinder. Dimitri and Erica reconciled, while Kinder eluded capture thanks to his unwitting lover Marian Colby. Kinder enacted his revenge on Erica by kidnaping her daughter, Bianca. However, Kinder's evil plan ended when, after a struggle, he took a seemingly fatal plunge down a flight of stairs. Erica and Janet buried Kinder in Erica's garden and went on with their lives. Finally, the truth came out. When the police tried to exhume Jonathan's body, they found the grave empty. The body was gone! Kinder was alive! Erica, Janet and Skye tracked Jonathan to Caribbean, and managed to get him aboard their private jet. Then, the \"three witches\" tied him up and delivered their prey to the Pine Valley police. Kinder was locked up -- finally.\n\nMaria and Edmund were delighted when Joe and Ruth Martin's granddaughter, Kelsey, agreed to let them adopt her baby. But there was more to Kelsey's plan. She was secretly in love with Edmund. After her baby's birth, Kelsey engineered a scheme to move into Wildwind to nurse baby Sam, and be close to Edmund. Later, before the adoption became final, Kelsey demanded that baby Sam be returned to her. Maria was devastated to have the child she had grown to love torn from her arms. She attempted to run away with the child, but Edmund stopped her.\n\nEdmund's actions infuriated Maria, who bitterly rejected her husband. In her grief, Maria turned to her brother-in-law, Dimitri Marick, who was then separated from Erica. They shared one night of passion -- witnessed by Skye Chandler.\n\nEventually, Bobby Warner (whose romance with Anita Santos hit the skids when he was publicly pronounced Sam's father) agreed to marry Kelsey on one condition - that baby Sam be returned to Edmund and Maria. Money or baby? Kelsey, who showed few maternal instincts, agreed to return the baby to the grateful Greys. And to make the scene at Wildwind even more joyous, Maria learned she was pregnant. After years of being unable to conceive, Maria was finally going to have Edmund's baby -- or so she believed. Skye, who had witnessed her encounter with Dimitri, was now obsessed with Edmund. She began to use her information as part of a plot to break up Maria and Edmund.\n\nTad distanced himself from Liza Colby and grew closer to Adam's former wife, Gloria Marsh. Adam Chandler, who wanted to reunite with another ex-wife, Brooke English, came up with an idea. Adam proposed an unholy alliance with Liza -- he would use her to make Brooke jealous and in turn, Liza would use Adam to make Tad jealous. Liza even became engaged to Adam, with the hope that either Tad or Brooke would stop the wedding from happening. Adam and Liza told each other that they would never go through with the ceremony. However, when no one interrupted the wedding, Liza stunned Adam when she said \"I do.\" Adam had a new wife -- one he didn't want. He vowed to end his marriage without giving a dime in alimony to the new Mrs. Chandler. Liza knew that she would have to sleep with Adam in order to stake her claim to his fortune. Liza was torn between her desire for money and her growing feelings for Tad's brother Jake (who had changed his name from Joey). They had met during the Christmas holidays at a country inn and passion erupted between them.\n\nTrevor was still unable to walk, although doctors could not find a reason for his paralysis. Only after a vehement confrontation with Janet Green, did Trevor stand on his own two feet. Though he regained the use of his legs, Trevor steadfastly refused to let Janet be a part of their daughter's life -- though in time he began to soften ever so slightly.\n\nRose Keefer was being pursued by a hit man, Grady. Rose, who had been estranged from her children, Noah and Belinda, came to Pine Valley, and put her family in immediate danger. Julia witnessed someone shoot Belinda but blocked out the assailant's identity. Finally, Julia's memory returned and she vividly recalled seeing Grady's boss, Slade, shoot Belinda. Now, Slade wanted all the Keefers dead. Julia testified against Slade in court, but now with the fear of reprisal in the air, Noah, Julia and Rose were forced to enter the Witness Protection Program. They bid a tearful farewell to Pine Valley."
