        "text": "Post by ellabelle on\n\nBianca, over time:\n\nBianca #1: The original Bianca, played by Jessica Leigh Falborn:\n\nJessica played Bianca for about a year or two before the character was SORAS'd and Bianca went from baby/toddler to 4 year old little girl. Bianca was born on screen in February 1988.\n\nBianca #2: Caroline Wilde gave us our first glimpse of Bianca's personality, and it was clear that Bianca was Erica made over.\n\nCaroline's Bianca was whiny, spoiled, prone to tantrums and frankly pretty bratty. This was the Bianca who set her dollhouse on fire after witnessing her mother and Uncle Jack kissing. She left Pine Valley with Travis and Barbara in 1991 when Travis won custody.\n\nBianca #3: Lacey Chabert\n\nWhen we next saw Bianca, she was played by Lacey Chabert, prior to her famous role on \"Party of 5.\" This was the Bianca who first met both Kendall Hart and Dimitri Marick. Lacey's Bianca was a vast departure from the previous portrayal - this Bianca was soft-spoken and very sweet, and perhaps as a result only lasted a few months in Pine Valley before the part was recast. Lacey portrayed Bianca briefly in early 1993.\n\nBianca #4: Gina Gallagher\n\nGina took over as Bianca in spring of 1993 and remained in the role through mid-1997. Her Bianca was more of a return to Caroline's Bianca: a miniature Erica who was spoiled, opinionated, bratty, and deeply insecure about her role in her mother's life, particularly when it was revealed that Kendall was Erica's daughter too. The is the Bianca who was nearly raped by Richard Fields and who bonded with Dimitri during his marriages to Erica. Bianca's age was a bit flexible during this time period, but Gina was at least several years older, and by 1997, she looked more like a teenager than the young girl Bianca supposedly was.\n\nBianca #5: Nathalie Paulding\n\nIn 1997, Bianca was recast with a younger, more delicate-looking actress for the anorexia storyline, which of course is well-known because it is the storyline for which Susan Lucci won her only Emmy. Nathalie left the role of Bianca in 1998 when the character was sent away to an inpatient eating disorder clinic.\n\nBianca #6: Eden Reigel\n\nIn early 2000, Erica referred to Bianca as being 12 years old - which is how old she should have been with a birthdate in 1988. A few months later, Bianca showed up in Pine Valley at age 16, corresponding to the age the character should have been based on Caroline Wilde's casting. Eden was in college at the time, so it's not surprising that her Bianca matured quickly into a young adult character, rather than a teen. Eden's Bianca is considered by most to be the definitive Bianca Montgomery, as she portrayed Bianca for the infamous coming out story, as well as daytime's first lesbian kiss and first lesbian wedding. Eden left and returned many times, but she was the only Bianca from 2000-2010. Eden's Bianca was said to be more like Mona than like Erica, but this Bianca definitely had an edge to her as well, from being a bit of a bratty teenager (accusing her mother of being a slut in high school) to threatening Greenlee and Kendall if they went after Enchantment to pursuing women who were otherwise taken and pulling out all of the stops to get what she wanted (like a child fathered by her brother-in-law). This Bianca could at times be soft and even a bit indecisive and wishy-washy, but she also had plenty of Kane woman in her.\n\nBianca #7: Christina Bennett Lind\n\nWhen Eden was unavailable, AMC recast Bianca in 2010 with Christina Bennett Lind, who saw the character through to the end of AMC's time on ABC. This Bianca was perhaps more soft-spoken than her predecessor, but she had no problem putting the moves on her friend JR's wife, Marissa. Christina's Bianca was best known for her romantic relationship with Sarah Glendening's Marisa Tasker.\n\nAnd of course, as most know, when AMC returned briefly in an online format, Eden returned as Bianca to deal with a now-teenaged (and SORAS'ed) Miranda."
