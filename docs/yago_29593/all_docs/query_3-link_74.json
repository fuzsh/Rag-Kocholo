        "text": "THERE are two kinds of men. The kind that spend long hours lying on the couch in front of professional wrestling. And those of us who prefer to spend our spare time shopping for the perfect couch to lie on.\n\nYou'd think women would prefer to cohabit with the shopping man. Not necessarily.\n\nWhen my current cohabitant moved in two years ago, I did not encourage (allow) her to bring anything from her apartment. It had a kind of Tuscan Inn theme, her old place. Walls washed in sunburnt pastels, overstuffed furniture, lots of wrought iron. All very warm and feminine, but none of it would have worked in my mod, minimal bachelor digs. Quite good-naturedly, she accepted my terms. To friends who asked, ''What happened to all your stuff?'' she would say she had arrived at my door with ''a suitcase and a lot to learn.''\n\nI got off easy. Some women don't take it as kindly when their possessions, their taste -- and sometimes the women themselves -- are rejected because they don't match the George Nelson sofa.\n\nIt happens. Guys who care more than their wives and girlfriends about home décor are still -- and probably always will be -- in the minority. But we're coming out of the California Closet.\n\nI don't have a catchy name for this movement yet (El Décor?). But we're bringing very male behavior to what has traditionally been a female (or decorator's) domain. Bossiness bordering on dictatorship. The hubris of expertise, real or imagined. A fan's fervor for legendary names and dates. And the compulsive will of the chronic collector to find the rare, elusive whatever. Extreme pickiness masquerading as perfectionism.\n\nIsn't it better to go without a coffee table for 10 years than buy the wrong one?\n\n''We are seeing more clients in which the guy drives the design decisions,'' said Doug Peix, of Peix & Marchetti Architects in New York. ''Men can care about fashion, can like to cook, can even dress in provocative ways. So, why not take control of the style of the home?''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
