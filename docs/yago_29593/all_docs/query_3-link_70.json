She falls in love with Edmund Grey, who is still carrying a torch for Brooke English at the time. Eventually, Edmund and Maria fall in love, and they marry. Shortly after, her college lover, Del Henry, comes to Pine Valley. The truth emerges regarding Maria's college affair with Del, her college pregnancy and miscarriage, and her subsequent infection and infertility. Edmund and Maria's marriage becomes only stronger, and after several failed \"in vitro\" attempts, they opt for adoption. Maria and Edmund agree to adopt the baby of Anita Santos' pregnant friend, and they name him Sam. However, they have to give him back when his birth mother changes her mind. Maria and Edmund separate over Sam's loss, and after Edmund stops Maria from fleeing the country with the baby, and returns him to Kelsey, Maria has a one-night stand with her brother-in-law, Dimitri Marick, but later she reconciles with Edmund. In October 1996, Maria and Edmund are reunited with Sam after the baby's birth father (Bobby) convinces the birth mother (Kelsey) to give Sam back to the Greys.\n\nMaria and Edmund's child tragedies are not over, however. Shortly after her one-night stand with brother-in-law Dimitri, Maria finds out that she is pregnant. In true soap opera fashion, Skye Chandler seduces a lab technician and doctors Maria's results to make it look as though Dimitri is the father (though Edmund actually is). Skye hopes that Edmund will then fall for her. That never happens. When Erica Kane learns about the baby's paternity, she confronts Maria in a cabin at Willow Lake during a horrible ice storm. Maria becomes overstressed and goes into premature labor. Erica drives them to the hospital. But while en route, Erica's car skids off the road, and everyone thinks that the baby is lost in Willow Lake. Erica tries to track down the baby, and she finds that a woman who lives near the lake has plucked the little girl from its icy waters. Erica convinces the woman that the baby is really hers and prepares to return the baby to Maria. Then she overhears Maria and Dimitri discuss the benefits of having lost the baby. Erica takes matters into her own hands. Erica decides to keep the baby herself, naming the infant Sonya. For months, Erica claims that she has adopted the baby from Russia. Then Erica claims the woman from the lake is the baby's mother and let Erica adopt her. The guilt built up, Erica decides to take the baby back to Edmund and Maria. The infant is reunited with Maria. The Greys charge Erica with kidnapping and two other felonies.\n\nLater, during a flight back to Pine Valley after an awards ceremony out of state, Maria switches seats with Brooke to let her work with Edmund during the flight. Maria notices an envelope in her briefcase; when she opens it, she finds the letter revealing Maddie's true paternity. As Maria goes to give Edmund the good news, the plane starts shaking. It explodes and crashes. All but four people (Brooke, Edmund, Maddie, and Jim Thomasen) die. Maria is stuck in her seat as the plane goes down into the waters below.\n\nIn 2002, a woman by the name of Maureen Gorman comes up as a match when little Lorenzo Santos, Mateo and Hayley's son, needs a liver transplant. Brooke and Tad travel to Nevada to meet with the woman, whom Brooke believes is Maria, though Tad does not. Brooke comes face to face with \"Maureen,\" who turns out to be a dead ringer for Maria. Later, though, when Tad meets Maureen, she looks nothing like Maria (feeling uncomfortable, Maureen had asked a coworker to pose as \"Maureen\" for Tad). \"Maureen\" is afraid of Brooke, and wonders why Brooke wants to talk to her, so she calls her friend, Dr. David Hayward, to ask for help. David knows \"Maureen's\" true identity, but urges her to stay away from Brooke and Pine Valley. \"Maureen\" travels to Pine Valley anyway. There, she skulks around Wildwind, trying to find out who she is. She is mugged in the park and befriended by Aidan Devane, who saves her. Aidan helps keep her hidden, even after \"Maureen\" takes Maddie away with her on Brooke and Edmund's wedding day. Brooke tells Edmund the truth after their wedding ceremony, that she believes Maria is still alive. Edmund takes off to find Maria. When the two come face to face, Maria tells Edmund that she has no memory of him, their marriage, or of anything else.\n\nAfter trying for several weeks to live the life of Dr. Maria Santos Grey, and after many tense moments with Edmund about his expectations of her (Edmund tries to be patient, but he is so thrilled that his wife is back that he does not succeed very much), \"Maureen\" finally convinces everyone in Pine Valley to accept her as \"Maureen Gorman.\" The only person who seems satisfied with her as Maureen is Aidan, the one person who has never known Maria Santos Grey. The two of them begin to fall in love. While Edmund finds it difficult to watch his beloved wife and mother of his children with another man, he makes it clear to everyone, including Maria's mother, Isabella, that he understands Maria to be Maureen now, and he expects everyone else to do the same. In turn, \"Maureen\" lets Aidan know that though she does not consider herself Edmund's wife, she is and will remain connected to him as Sam and Maddie's mother, which is fine with him. In spite of her growing anxiety about the return of her memories and the uncertainty of her future, \"Maureen\" accepts Aidan's proposal of marriage.\n\nWhen a man named Flanders murders Chris Stamp in a local park and realizes that little Maddie has witnessed the entire thing, she becomes the murderer's next target. Maria, Aidan, and Edmund joins forces to put the little girl into hiding to protect her. During these tense days, while in hiding with her daughter and Aidan, flickers of memories begin to drift through Maria's mind, memories of Sam and Maddie and being their mother. When Maddie is tossed overboard, Maria/Maureen jumps in to save her. As she does, all of her memories return; Maria is back. Maureen becomes a former, relatively small chapter in her life, and although she is grateful to Aidan and wants to remain his friend, her heart belongs to Edmund. Maria tells Edmund she accepts his at times poor treatment of her over the past year and apologizes for her own mistakes, then they make love for the first time in over half a decade. Maria moves back into Wildwind and fully reunites with her children and her mother.\n\nWhen Carlos Reyes is admitted to the hospital following an attack by the Calatravas (the Argentinian gang who are trying to kill Carlos and his brother Pablo), Maria is his consulting doctor. She and Edmund become close friends with Carlos and Pablo. When Carlos dies, Maria blames herself for his death, fearing that the recent renewal of her medical license led to her making a mistake. She is prepared to resign. Soon, the truth is revealed: A corrupt nurse employed by the Calatravas had killed Carlos. Edmund is shot and left paralyzed after helping Pablo deal with the Calatravas. Edmund wants to undergo risky surgery that could restore the use of his legs, but possibly kill him. Fearful of losing her husband, Maria is adamantly against surgery. Edmund goes through with the procedure and Maria does her best to support him. The surgery is not successful, and it appears that Edmund will be paralyzed for life.\n\nEdmund's struggle to deal with his new condition causes strains for the Greys, as he becomes cold and distant. Complicating matters is the arrival of Zach Slater in Pine Valley, her former lover. Maria finds herself drawn to Zach, her attraction to him very much alive. Zach makes it clear to Maria that he wants to resume their relationship, but Maria vows to be true to her husband. After Edmund overhears her talking with Zach, Maria comes clean that they were involved while she was an amnesiac. Maria swears that her contact with Zach is going to end. As the distance between Edmund and Maria grows, Maria finds herself drawn into Zach's world when she learns that he is really Alexander Cambias Junior, the presumed dead brother of Pine Valley rapist Michael Cambias. Zach had come to town to get the real story behind Michael's death, refusing to believe that the caring boy he once knew had become a monster. Sensing Zach's pain, Maria promises to help Zach come to terms with the truth about Michael, but keeps this from Edmund. Zach asks Maria to keep his identity a secret, which Maria agrees to, yet another secret from Edmund.\n\nErica tells Edmund that she has witnessed Maria and Zach in a close moment. Furious with Maria for her continued association with Zach, and with months of distance between them, Edmund initiates divorce proceedings. Maria tells Edmund that she loves him and will fight the divorce. The tension between them grows when Maria learns that Edmund has begun to get some feeling back in his legs, a revelation he kept from her. Despite some real and unresolved feelings for Zach, Maria is determined to repair her marriage to Edmund. Edmund tells Maria he loves her and that he has stopped the divorce. Unbeknownst to Maria, Edmund has recovered from his paralysis and is determined to destroy Zach, and then divorce Maria. Soon after, Edmund is murdered. Ethan Ramsey, Zach's estranged son, tells the police he witnessed Zach commit the crime. Zach tells Maria that Edmund had been lying to her and could walk. Devastated over Edmund's death, Maria refuses to believe Zach and blames him for Edmund's murder. Zach is arrested and shocks Maria and Ethan when he confesses to the crime. Maria holds firm to her belief that Edmund loved her and Zach is guilty. Brooke reveals to Maria that Edmund had planned on divorcing her shortly before he died. Maria refuses to believe Brooke, and receives another blow when Zach is released from prison, now claiming that he did not kill Edmund.\n\nZach is cleared of the murder, and Ethan revealed as a liar, when Jonathan Lavery is proven guilty. Maria feels terrible for believing the worst of Zach, and apologizes to him, but Zach is furious and hurt. Reeling off this, Maria is shocked to learn that Edmund made Brooke the executor of his will and left Maria with nothing. A hurt Maria gets drunk at an awards ceremony that is posthumously honoring Edmund, and lashes out at the town of Pine Valley. Zach cares for the drunken Maria, his feelings still evident. Sam and Maddie begin to lash out at their mother for her behavior and her prior association with Zach. Maria apologizes to Zach for all she has done, and tells him that she never stopped loving him, but that she cannot see him anymore. Her focus needs to be on her children. When Maddie attempts to make it appear as if Zach tried to attack her, Maria realizes that she needs to do something drastic to bring her family back together and moves to California with Maddie to be near Mateo (brother of Maria) and Hayley (his wife). Sam follows a few months later after breaking up with Lily Montgomery.\n\nMaria's sister, Julia Santos, dies in May 2008 as a result of a gunshot wound. On her deathbed, Julia instructs Krystal Carey to arrange for Maria to come get her adoptive daughter, Kathy, as Maria is Kathy's appointed guardian.\n\nSample Post:\n\nMaria arrived at Pine Valley Airport after a long flight from Los Angeles and was very tired. She just wanted to see her sister-in-law Hayley and all her friends in Pine Valley. She got a rental car and started driving around town. She then made a quick stop at the Yacht Club and grabed some french fries and a burger and was thinking about the love of her love Edmund Grey. so she missed him very much and Maria remembered the laughs she had with Edmund but she knew she had to get going so she got in her car and started heading over to the Chandler Mansion to see Hayley. When she arrived she remembered the creepyness of the Chandler Mansion but she shoved it off. She walked up with her spunky attitude intact and rang the doorbell. someone answered it after a few seconds and Maria quickly gave them a hug\n\n''HEY!!!!!!!! how is't going?'' Maria said at the person who answered the door. Maria then was Maria and walked her butt inside like nobody buissness. and quickly made a glass of tea"
