He responded to them all.\"\n\nLister also revealed that her husband had been writing a memoir when he was diagnosed with cancer, explaining that the book was going to detail his lengthy struggle with addiction.\n\nShe wrote: \"He was working on a book about his life and addiction before he passed. He had so many talents and skills and it's hard to imagine living life without his beautiful and wonderful presence, joy and laughter.\"\n\nThe actor was best known for playing Dex Dexter, the handsome husband of Joan Collins' cunning villain, Alexis Carrington, on the hit eighties TV show Dynasty. He also found fame playing Susan Lucciâ€™s supportive husband Dimitri Marick on the soap opera All My Children."
