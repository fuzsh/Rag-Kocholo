        "text": "Who is Rakim's wife?\n\nHer name is Felicia. They were High School sweethearts. They have been married a while and have several children.\n\nWhat did Romeo and Juliets do because their parents wouldn't let them get married?\n\nActually, Romeo and Juliet's parents did nothing to prevent their children from getting married. They may well have done so had they been asked, but they were never asked. The news that they had been married came as a total surprise to their parents after their deaths. Romeo and Juliet got married secretly because they assumed that their parents would object."
