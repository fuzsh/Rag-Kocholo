        "text": "DYNASTY star Michael Nader passed away at the age of 76 on August 23, 2021.\n\nHis death was announced in a statement made public by his wife Jodi Lister. Here's what you need to know about her.\n\nWho is Michael Nader's wife Jodi?\n\nActor Michael Nader is said to have died following a battle with an untreatable form of cancer.\n\nJodi stayed at his side until his last breath.\n\nShe wrote in her statement: \"With a heavy heart I'm sharing the news of the passing of my beloved Michael.\"\n\n\"We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted.\n\n\"Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of ‘Dynasty’ during Emma Samms’ virtual event to help raise funds for long Covid research.\n\n\"Michael was working on a book about his life and addiction at the time of his death.\n\n\"He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.\"\n\nUnlike her husband, known for portraying Dex in the ABC evening drama Dynasty and Dimitri Marick in All My Children, Jodi has had a tendency to remain away from the spotlight, rarely appearing at the actor's side.\n\nHer origins, age and profession are not known and she is popularly known for being Michael's long-time partner.\n\nHow long were Michael Nader and Jodi married?\n\nThe couple got hitched on September 16, 2014, and would have celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary in 2021.\n\nJodi and Michael originally met in 2003, although the circumstances of their first meeting are not known.\n\nThey became inseparable for the next 18 years and spent most of their time fostering dogs.\n\nPrior to his marriage with Jodi, Michael was married to Robin Weiss.\n\nHe also notably dated actress Ellen Barber for ten years.\n\nDid Michael Nader and Jodi have children?\n\nIn the course of their 18-year relationship, Jodi and Michael had no children together.\n\nHowever, the American star shared an only daughter with his first wife Robin, named Lindsay Michelle Nader.\n\nBorn on July 21, 1984, Lindsay followed in her father's footsteps and became an actress after recording her own music under the stage name Lu Nader.\n\nLindsay got her big break in 2009, when she played in Claire in the Oren Moverman film The Messenger.\n\nShe has also been seen in Whatever Works and The Sisterhood Of The Travelling Pants 2.\n\nMichael was also a grandfather after Lindsay gave birth to a daughter named Juniper on December 16, 2016.\n\nShe has been in a long-term relationship with Trevor Easter since November 20, 2012, ."
