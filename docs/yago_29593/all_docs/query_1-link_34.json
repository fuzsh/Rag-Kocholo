        "text": "The vast Yukon may hide secret towns, but the enormous forest seems overrun by mysterious figures, some or all of whom may be involved in the deaths and disappearances of several people.įans of Armstrong’s Rockton series may consider this a decent placeholder until Haven’s Rock gets up and properly running and generating murders galore, but newcomers will be totally lost and will just wander around in the bush until a hungry bear finds them. Secret Yukon town Rockton is now history, so married coppers Alex Dalton and Casey (of varying fake surnames) set up the new secret Yukon town of Haven’s Rock - what do you suppose happens next in a book titled Murder at Haven’s Rock (Kelley Armstrong, Minotaur Books, 352 pages, $24)? The likable cops in Alex North’s The Angel Maker (Celadon Books, 336 pages, $25) are as befuddled as readers - it’s a complex mystery, but utterly filled with depravity and despair. Indeed, what does it have to do with a threatened youngish mother in an unnamed British city who selfishly failed to protect her long-missing addict brother many years ago, or with the scum who attacked her brother, or with the serial killer currently stalking the streets, or with a dead baby? The second in a series, Winnipeg author Philipp Schott’s Six Ostriches (ECW Press, 272 pages, $25) is an amiable enough murder mystery with an improbable but likable hero, though the plot gets muddled and the relationships and motives involving way too many characters get a tad confusing.Īn old reclusive rich guy is found butchered in a decaying mansion - so what does this have to do with a long-dead serial killer of little children who claimed he could see the future? Peter Bannerman, much to the worry of his wife Laura and her grievously annoyed RCMP brother Kevin. Plunking himself right in the middle of it through his amateur sleuth skills and sheer nosiness is meddling autistic super-analytic veterinarian Dr. Ghastly eww-gross animal mutilations inevitably lead to even ghastlier human murders as evil disciples of Odin lay claim to an ancient, heretofore unknown, centuries-earlier-than-ever-imagined Icelandic settlement in the bustling community of New Selfoss on Highway 59 north of Brokenhead - don’t trust faulty official maps, just Google it. Not a barrel of laughs, but hey, way good. Troubled police detective Emma needs all her detective skills when a young man without an enemy in Iceland dies in a fire in his parents’ house with all the doors and windows locked - and a second murder follows.Įveryone, it goes without saying, has secrets and knows more than they’re saying, while all the coppers have their own demons to battle.Įva Björg Ægisdottir’s Night Shadows (translated by Vicky Cribb, Orenda Books, 341 pages, $23) released in English in November 2022, is a complex but terrific murder mystery in which the innocent suffer horribly.\n\nFree Press 101: How we practise journalism.\n\nBabe Chandler and Marissa Tasker: Though Marissa never knew deceased twin Babe, she definitely got to know Babe's widower, JR Chandler, whom she married and remains entangled with despite their divorce.

JR Chandler and Jamie Martin: Though not biologically related, these stepsibs were raised as brothers and JR felt betrayed when Jamie was caught kissing JR's girlfriend, Laurie, in 2003. Liza Colby and Mia Saunders: Liza's half-sis kept company with Ryan (with whom Liza had had a one-night stand) and was engaged to Jake, another of Liza's exes.Ĩ.\n\nFrankie and Maggie Stone: These twins had the same taste in ladies both were romantically linked to Bianca Montgomery.ħ. Dimitri Marick and Edmund Grey: Aside from Dimtri's notorious one-night stand with half-brother Edmund's wife, Maria, the sibs vied for the affection of Alexandra Devane, who got engaged to Edmund after Dimitri was presumed dead but reunited with her hubby when he was revealed to be alive.Ħ. The very same year Tad's marriage to Dixie went belly-up because he'd fallen into bed with his ex, she began a doomed romance with Jake.ĥ. Jake and Tad Martin: Before there was Cara, there was Liza.\n\nEventually, Gloria left Stuart for his twin.Ĥ.\n\nAdam and Stuart Chandler: Adam fell hard for Gloria Marsh when she was Stuart's gal pal.
