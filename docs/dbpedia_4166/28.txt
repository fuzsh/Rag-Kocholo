Sometimes lightning strikes twice — at least it did when Paul Newman and Robert Redford teamed up. The dazzling leading men made two movies together, both directed by George Roy Hill, that became Oscar juggernauts. The first, 1969’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, rounded up seven Academy Award nominations and four wins. Fifty years ago, The Sting bested the trio’s Oscar haul, winning best picture, director and five other categories.

As in the Western caper Butch Cassidy, Newman and Redford play outlaws of sorts in The Sting: 1930s grifters Henry Gondorff and Johnny Hooker, who work together to pull off a heist against a Chicago mafioso. Released on Christmas Day in 1973, the movie was an instant hit, earning $156 million worldwide ($972 million today). Six weeks later, it scored 10 Oscar nominations — including a lead actor nod for Redford — and went on to win best picture, director, original screenplay, editing, costume design, production design and original score.

The film’s original screenplay win came under scrutiny when David Maurer, author of the 1940 book The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Man, about real-life con artists Fred and Charley Gondorff, filed a plagiarism lawsuit against screenwriter David Ward. The case was settled out of court.

The Sting II, also written by Ward but starring Jackie Gleason and Karl Malden, came out in 1983 but couldn’t recapture the magic of its predecessor, earning just $6.3 million ($19.6 million) at the box office.
