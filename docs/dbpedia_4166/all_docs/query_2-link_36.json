        "text": "Movie goers, movie lovers, across Colorado really have to take a hard look at how they embrace films, after another great theater has closed.\n\nMany movies are \"bubble gum fare\" for the masses: Marvel, Pixar, big comedies, for example. There's nothing wrong with those, but there also needs to be places to see films that don't fit into those categories.\n\nWith another classic movie theater coming to an end, you have to wonder \"where\" will it end?\n\nAs of August 8, 2024, a small 3-screen movie theater in Denver (near Colorado and Hampden) Chez Artiste, ceased to exist. It had been around, in some fashion as a movie theater, since 1974, according to Denver Gazette.\n\nArt-House Movie Theater Closes in Denver, Colorado\n\nWhile you may see AMC, Metrolux, and Cinemark, and Hawkins theater across Colorado, the places to go where you're not inundated with \"extras,\" places where you just want to see a great film, such as Chez Artiste are dwindling.\n\nMany of us drop upwards of $30 to go see a blockbuster movie at a Cinemark or Metrolux (maybe spring for the IMAX,) while these little art-house theaters are disappearing into Colorado's history.\n\nBlockbuster Movies Dominate\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine, for example, comes out and takes up many of the available screens at your local [Cinemark] theater; those theaters aren't, generally, going to be saving (maybe) more than one screen for independent films, let alone a foreign language one.\n\nChez Artiste, originally University 2, was the kind of theater to hit up when you wanted to see a movie that's different; one that will probably be up for an Academy Award; great FILMS.\n\nI remember seeing \"Standing in the Shadows of Motown\" there in 2002, about ten years before they went through a big renovation. It was the only theater showing the film, which is terrific.\n\nRELATED: Movie About a Colorado Legend Gets 100% on Rotten Tomatoes\n\nYes, you can point to places like The Lyric Cinema in Fort Collins, but they lend themselves more to a younger/college crowd; Adult Coloradans that enjoy theaters like Chez Artiste, need to visit them, more.\n\nIt will be missed."
