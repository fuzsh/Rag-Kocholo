        "text": "Disney Studios announced on Monday that the production of Freaky Friday 2 has started. The film will be a sequel to the hit 2003 comedy Freaky Friday starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nThe announcement came from a behind-the-scenes Instagram reel of a promotional shoot of the celebrities swapped in front of their co-star’s trailer door.\n\nLohan shared the video on her page, writing, “We’re back!”\n\nDisney officially announced the sequel in March, after Curtis and Lohan teased the sequel in 2023. Curtis started rumors of the film in October 2022, telling The View that she had “already written to Disney” about a sequel.\n\nWith a multigenerational twist in this film, the plot picks up several years after the original. Anna (Lohan) now has one daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. With Tess (Curtis) now taking on the role of grandmother, the mother-daughter pair is navigating new dynamics in a merging family.\n\nDisney has said that Freaky Friday 2 will go straight to theaters in 2025 rather than being released on Disney+ directly.\n\nThe film reunites several original cast members. Since the announcement, Chad Michael Murray has confirmed his return for the sequel, along with Mark Harmon, Christina Vidal Mitchell, and Rosalind Chao, among others."
