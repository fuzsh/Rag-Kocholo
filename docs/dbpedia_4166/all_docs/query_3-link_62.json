        "text": "Just as nations need myths, so do people. This is especially true when it comes to the deepest parts of our past. Those obscure areas of one’s most youthful existence that occupy a place between dreams and reality. I know this from experience. Allow me to explain. For as long as I can remember, I have loved to read. When anyone remarks on my love for the written word, I repeat a self-taught tale. A combination of myth and memory that has taken anecdotal form. I often tell people that I learned to read by deciphering basketball box scores in the local newspaper. To be honest, this can only partly be true. I must have been learning to read at the time and it was while studying box scores that written words – in the form of names – first became intelligible to me. This was the first time that I can remember reading.\n\nThe story might explain why I still find myself enthralled by statistics to this very day. Whether the statistics are about sports, society or whatever other subjects might interest me, I can spend hours scrutinizing them. In essence, reading statistical data is in the very depths of my DNA. This highly personal passion is akin to how someone might feel about their first love, there is no way they will ever forget it. One way I have found to spark this flame that still burns deep in my subconscious is by purchasing books with statistical data. Uniting this passion with my love of Hungarian history was what brought me to purchase, “Statistics of the Centuries (Statistical curios in the Hungarian history)”. A volume that fills me with delight every time I peruse its pages.\n\nMisplaced Dreams – A Minor Tragedy\n\nIt was one of those minor tragedies that sent me spiraling into a dreadful stupor for months on end. I had not lost a loved one nor a small fortune, but this was almost as bad. I had lost my copy of Statistics of the Centuries. This sent me searching through every bookshelf, closet, and storage space where I might have misplaced it. All to no avail. Life has bigger tragedies, but what might seem a triviality to others, was positively apocalyptic to me on a personal level. Part of my attachment to the book had to do with where I discovered it. I found its rectangular form wedged between volumes in the Hungary section at Danni’s English Bookshop on Castle Hill in Budapest. The copy I found was clean and crisp with glossy pages which awaited my grasp. I purchased it on the spot for the equivalent of about five dollars. Never has so little money been spent, for so great a pleasure.\n\nA sense of captivation caught my eye from the moment I turned past the cover page. Charts, short but informative text blurbs, bar graphs, colorful maps, and reams of data from which I gleaned one insight after another were all there for my perusing pleasure. I toted the book around with me for weeks after I returned home. It was present on the stand beside my favorite chair. Always within easy reach, an enjoyable journey back through Hungary’s past and into its present (at least up until 2000). I was so taken by the book that I attempted to locate an updated version from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. I did not have much luck, but at least I owned a cherished copy. That was until I managed to somehow misplace it. The misplacement was most likely a product of my need to have the book near at hand. Somewhere it was lost in my daily shuffle.\n\nA Near Futile Pursuit – Scouring the Shelves\n\nI knew that finding another copy of Statistics of the Centuries would be difficult. My best bet would be to browse the bookshops in Budapest for that elusive work. There was a sense of hopelessness to this task that bordered upon despair. I still could not believe my luck in finding a copy the first time. That copy had been in near perfect condition. I was astonished that the Hungarian Central Statistical Office had published such a work in English. How many copies were in that initial print run I could only guess, but I doubt very many. Then there was the fact that someone had to sale a secondhand copy to one of a handful of English used bookstores in Budapest. Unlikely at best. What were the chances of coming upon another copy? While lightning has been known to strike twice. It rarely hits the same spot. In this case that was true.\n\nThere was not another copy forthcoming from the shelves of Danni’s Bookshop. Scouring the shelves of Budapest bookshops turned into an exercise in futility. There was nothing else to do except wander the back alleys and claustrophobic corridors of the city’s streets hoping to come upon that one bookshop which carried a copy. It would take me a couple years of searching before I came upon a second copy. This happened in a most serendipitous manner. While by that time, I had not completely given up hope of finding another copy, the thought had settled in the back of my mind, buried somewhere in the sub-conscious. Until on one of those anonymous days which make up so much of our lives, even while traveling, I experienced a moment that will forever be imprinted in my memory."
