Follow this family’s heart-wrenching yet hope-filled journey of finding their new normal.

You will undoubtedly be captivated, informed, and inspired.\n\nSoftcover Trim Size: 5.5 x 8.5\n\nPage Count: 248\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nMelody Leclair is a graduate of Wilfrid Laurier University with a Master of Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy.
