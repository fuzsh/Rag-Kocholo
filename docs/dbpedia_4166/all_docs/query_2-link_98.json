        "text": "Paddington 2 is the sequel to the surprise hit live action/comedy film based on the popular Paddington Bear character. It was created by the British author Michael Bond, who passed away the year of Paddington 2's release, 2017.\n\nPaddington 2 featured even more delightful voice acting from Ben Whishaw, as well as a story that had appeal for all-ages. It has a whopping 99% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nOkay, this is pretty much the polar-opposite from the cutesy and warm Paddington 2, but The Godfather Part 2 is an impossibly great follow-up to one of the best mafia films ever made. It brings the story of the Corleone crime family on an even more epic scale with parallel narratives between new Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in 1958, and past stories about his late father, Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro).\n\nThe original Terminator probably has its die-hard fans, but Terminator 2 was a step up in almost every way. The chases, shootouts, and fight scenes all took advantage of more advanced filmmaking technology of the time. This includes the creepy VFX that went into the formidable shapeshifting villain, T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It also reintroduced Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) as an awesome self-trained soldier in the years since the original.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back is pretty much a quintessential sequel, with the threat of Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire looming closer and closer to our Rebel heroes after their successful destruction of the Death Star in the first film. This film has some of the series' most iconic moments, like the snowy fight on Hoth, Luke being trained by Yoda on the swamp planet of Dagobah, and the \"I am your father\" twist that left audiences reeling at the time.\n\nLast Crusade was the third entry in this phenomenal adventure series, and it brought excitement right back up after the more middling Temple of Doom. The introduction of Indiana Jones' father Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) adds a delightful dynamic to the lead character, and the film's journey as a whole.\n\nHere, Alan Arkin presents the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor to Heath Ledger's mother, Sally, in honor of the late actor's performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight. His performance is still captivating in this film, which is an excellent sequel in the Christopher Nolan-directed Batman film trilogy.\n\nThor: Ragnarok was the third film in the standalone Thor film series for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it delighted audiences in 2017 with its witty and irreverent tone. It was a marked step up from Thor: The Dark World, which got a little lost in the shuffle among other post-Avengers Marvel film releases.\n\nEveryone has their favorite James Bond flick, but this third film in the spy series was an even bigger hit than the first entries. Goldfinger was the first of the franchise to have a lengthy and visually-unique opening credits scene with a signature song, and also incorporated the use of more gadgets in the film series.\n\nIncreasing the threat of the chilling Xenomorph introduced in the original Alien from one to, well, a whole lot more, is a great build of stakes and results in a non-stop thrill ride with some great set pieces. If you're more of a horror or suspense fan above all else, the original Alien may still be your fave, but you've still got to appreciate what Aliens is bringing to the table.\n\nWe have the original to thank for the incredible characters and world of Toy Story, but each subsequent entry in the series — Toy Story 2, 3 and even 4 — are each their own masterclass in building on the one before and growing alongside fans of the original. 2 or 3 are probably the highest points of the series depending on who you ask, but you can't go wrong with any of these Pixar classics.\n\nThe original Sam Raimi Spider-Man is a stone-cold classic, and Spider-Man 2 carries the torch even higher, with slightly more dramatic stakes and an incredible villain performance with Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus. Even though it was slightly more serious, the film still struck a great balance of drama alongside the goofy and cartoony attitude that fans want to see from Spider-Man.\n\nThis film is definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen possible given the sheer ambition and scale of its production. If you didn't know, they have even reintroduced actors — like Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver — that met their ends in the first Avatar. We won't spoil who they play if you haven't seen it yet."
