        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Is Mel Gibson’s “Hacksaw Ridge” another “American Sniper”?\n\nMr. Gibson, who has been largely sidelined in Hollywood for a decade because of appalling behavior off camera, may not be that lucky. Directed by Clint Eastwood and telling the true story of a celebrated member of the Navy SEALs, “American Sniper” sold a tremendous $547 million in tickets worldwide in 2014 and was nominated for six Academy Awards. Cultural and commercial lightning of that magnitude rarely strikes twice.\n\nBut “Hacksaw Ridge,” based on the true story of a World War II hero and set for wide release by Lionsgate on Nov. 4, has been playing in extensive advance screenings in a remarkably similar way to Mr. Eastwood’s war film. Like “American Sniper,” Mr. Gibson’s movie is a character study that limits overt political messaging, which allows viewers to see what they want to see — a rare cinematic Rorschach test.\n\nSome interpret “Hacksaw Ridge” as an antiwar movie. Others see an appreciation of American military might. (As Michael Phillips, a film critic for The Chicago Tribune, said in an early review, “It’s the most bloodthirsty movie about a pacifist ever made.”) It was a similar split that allowed “American Sniper” to become a surprise force, attracting big crowds in red and blue states.\n\nStill, “Hacksaw Ridge” faces obstacles at the box office, including the extreme violence in the film, its religious themes and whether audiences have forgiven Mr. Gibson’s personal failings. The movie stars Andrew Garfield as the real-life Desmond T. Doss, an intensely religious member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which has a history of strongly discouraging members from bearing arms. Yet Mr. Doss enlisted in the Army after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and insisted on going into combat — while, astoundingly, refusing to carry a rifle.\n\nAfter enduring ridicule for his beliefs, which included observing the Sabbath, Mr. Doss was given conscientious objector status and served as an unarmed medic in multiple battles, including the gruesome Okinawa siege in 1945. Mr. Doss, who died in 2006, became the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor; he saved dozens of wounded men in Okinawa alone, carrying them one by one in the face of enemy fire and lowering them down an escarpment by rope.\n\n“Private Doss, a true hero among heroes, was a contradiction,” said Bill Mechanic, one of the film’s producers. “We’re not trying to solve that contradiction in this film.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
