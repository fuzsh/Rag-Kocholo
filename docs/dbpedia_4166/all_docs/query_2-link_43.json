        "text": "The Colemans are back and getting freaky again!\n\nAfter more than two decades, Lindsay Lohan and Oscar-winner Jamie Lee Curtis are reuniting for a sequel to \"Freaky Friday.\"\n\nWalt Disney Studios released images of Lohan, 37, and Curtis, 65, on the set of the untitled sequel to the 2003 classic \"Freaky Friday.\" The two actors held hands and naturally posed in front of each other's trailers for the body-switching comedy sequel.\n\nCurtis starred as overworked mother Tess Coleman and Lohan as her teenage daughter Anna, who wakes up to discover they have switched bodies in the 2003 comedy \"Freaky Friday.\" Chaos ensues as the two try to live each other's lives (with Curtis playing guitar in a student rock concert) until they figure out a solution.\n\nIn the sequel, adult Anna now has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. \"As they navigate the myriad challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might indeed strike twice,\" Disney said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"We are freaking out because the Colemans are getting freaky again,\" Curtis wrote on Instagram on Monday.\n\nWho is in 'Freaky Friday 2' cast?\n\nOther returning cast members from the original film include Mark Harmon (who played Tess Coleman's fiance Ryan), Chad Michael Murray (who played Anna's boyfriend Jake), Christina Vidal Mitchell (Maddie), Haley Hudson (Peg), Lucille Soong (Pei-Peiâ€™s Mom), Stephen Tobolowsky (Mr. Bates), and Rosalind Chao (Pei-Pei). The returning crew are joined by Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Manny Jacinto (\"Top Gun: Maverick\"), and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan.\n\nJordan Weiss (\"Doll Face\") is the screenwriter, and Nisha Ganatra will direct the new film.\n\nCurtis has long advocated reuniting the \"Freaky Friday\" gang. Appearing on \"The View\" in 2022, Curtis said she had lobbied Disney for a return with Lohan, whose Anna, as a young mother, would switch bodies with grandmother Tess.\n\n\"So then Lindsay gets to be the sexy grandma who is still happy with Mark Harmon in all the ways you would be happy with Mark Harmon,\" said Curtis. \"And simply, I would like to see Lindsay be the hot grandma, and I would like to see me try to deal with toddlers today. I want to be a helicopter parent in today's world, as an old lady.\"\n\nWhen does 'Freaky Friday 2' come out?\n\nThe new film with be directed by Nisha Ganatra and is due in theaters next year.\n\nWhere to watch 'Freaky Friday'\n\nCurtis and Lohan's 2003 version of \"Freaky Friday\" is available to watch on Disney+ ahead of the sequel.\n\nHow many 'Freaky Friday' movies are there?\n\nCurtis and Lohan's \"Freaky Friday\" isn't the first, nor the last rendition of Mary Rodgers' novel.\n\n\"Freaky Friday\" (1976): The original film adaption starred Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris.\n\n\"Freaky Friday\" (2003): Curtis and Lohan played mother and daughter.\n\n\"Freaky Friday\" (2018): Disney made a musical adaptation with Cozi Zuehlsdorff as daughter Elle and Heidi Blickenstaff as mother Katherine.\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe"
