It's among the most current MacBook Pro laptops available. At the moment, Amazon has taken 13% off its usual price of $2,399, so you can buy this computer for $2,099.\n\nHowever, if you want to upgrade the laptop's processor to an M3 Max and equip it with 36GB of unified memory and a 1-terabyte SSD for storage, Amazon has this configuration on sale for 9% off, which brings the price down to $2,899.\n\n2023 14\" MacBook Pro with M3 Pro processor: $1,699 (15% off)\n\nApple shook things up toward the end of 2023 with a major overhaul of its MacBook Pro lineup, rolling out not one but three processors: the Apple M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max. This particular model is one of the newest additions, so it's one to watch if you need a bit more power than what the previous M2 processor can offer.\n\nThis MacBook Pro features a stunning 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display that shines bright at up to 600 nits, making everything you do onscreen pop with clarity and vivid color.

The price is currently $1,399. Of course, it runs the very latest version of the MacOS operating system and comes with a really diverse collection of apps.\n\nApple 2022 MacBook Air with M2 processor: $799 (20% off)\n\nPerfect for a middle school or high school student, or an average user looking for an affordable \"starter MacBook,\" we recommend this 2022 Apple MacBook Air. It's a slightly older version of the MacBook Air, but it still runs the latest version of MacOS and comes with all of the same preinstalled as as current MacBooks. However, it runs using Apple's M2 processor, as opposed to the newer (and faster) M3 silicone.\n\nThis MacBook Air is light, ultra-thin and ready to help you tackle your everyday computing tasks. It offers a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and comes equipped with 8 gigs of RAM and a 256-gig SSD for internal storage. You also get a backlit keyboard and a 1080p FaceTime HD webcam, so participating in video calls, online classes, or virtual meetings is easy.\n\nChoose between four casing colors -- midnight, silver, space gray, or starlight. When purchasing this laptop on Amazon, if you feel that 256 gigs isn't enough storage, you can upgrade the SSD to offer 512 gigs of storage. This version of the MacBook Air is currently on sale for $799, which is 17% off its usual $1,199 price.\n\nWhat is the best MacBook model?\n\nHere are a few important factors to keep in mind while shopping for MacBooks:\n\nPurpose: Are you a creative pro needing the muscle of a MacBook Pro for heavy graphics work, or are you more about surfing the web and crafting documents, where a MacBook Air would be just right? Once you know what your needs are, you can choose an affordable MacBook without overspending on technology and features you don't need.\n\nUnder the hood: Apple's M1 and M2 chips are known for speed and efficiency, a step up from older Intel chips. More RAM equals smoother multitasking, so give that some thought. At the moment, we recommend a MacBook with at least an M2 processor, although you'll be much better served by one of the latest M3 processors (with the M3 Max being the most powerful that Apple has to offer).\n\nStorage needs: SSDs in MacBooks are lightning fast, but expanding storage via Apple comes with a hefty price tag. Figure out how much storage you need, but remember that you can always lean on the cloud for the overflow. All of the Apple MacBooks work seamlessly with the Apple iCloud service.\n\nScreen time: The Pro models outshine with their displays, and size does matter. Do you need a compact 13-inch for on-the-go work, or does a 16-inch workspace sound like a dream? Weigh screen size against how mobile you want to be.\n\nPortability: If you're always on the move, the MacBook Air can be your lightweight companion. But if you're after something with a bit more oomph and don't mind the extra heft, the MacBook Pro, particularly one of the 16-inch models, should be your go-to choice.\n\nBattery check: Apple's latest chips bring some serious power, but how you use your MacBook can move the needle on battery life.
