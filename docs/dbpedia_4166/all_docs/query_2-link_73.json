        "text": "Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter have had several opportunities to work together over the years. Their first collaboration came in 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, though they didn't exactly have equal billing. That same year, they starred opposite one another in Corpse Bride. While they don't appear on screen, their vocal talent brought the characters to life, along with the brilliant work by the artists and animators. Regardless, their power as a duo was evident even through their voice work.\n\nThe next time they starred in a live-action film was in 2007's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, adapted from the Stephen Sondheim musical of the same name. Depp plays the titular barber, who begins killing men to get meat for the pies that Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) sells. Both actors are quite suited to the dark, wounded characters, and their desperate chemistry helps keep the story entertaining even as they turn people into pies. Though the pair have joined forces for a number of other films, these two are proof enough of their rare chemistry.\n\nOne of the most famous films starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman is Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, where the two legendary stars play the two title characters. The Western isn't just another classic of the 20th century, it's also an era-defining piece of pop culture. The film was released in 1969, and it didn't take too long for the two actors to join forces one more.\n\nThe Sting sees Newman and Redford as professional con men who pull off a massive scheme to steal a lot of money and get revenge for a fallen friend. It's as good a movie as Butch and Sundance, and the leads make it happen. The Sting features more of an ensemble cast than its predecessor, but every time you put Newman and Redford on the silver screen at the same time, rest assured, it's going to turn into a great movie.\n\nTom Hanks and Meg Ryan are on-screen couple goals. It's hard to deny they have stellar on-screen chemistry, and they've put that to the test four times over the years. The first time they worked together was on Joe Versus the Volcano, but their romantic powerhouse status really took off a few years later with Sleepless in Seattle. Despite not sharing the screen for 95% of the movie as they fall in love from afar, the sheer weight of their first face-to-face meeting at the end only proves their chemistry.\n\nIn 1998, Hanks and Ryan gave it a shot a third time in You've Got Mail. This time, while portraying bitter book-selling rivals in real life, they remain blissfully unaware they're also falling in love with each other via e-mail correspondence. Regardless, the movie resonates more than a quarter century later, and remains a top rom-com thanks to their chemistry.\n\nAdam Sandler is a successful actor and filmmaker who takes care of his friends. You'll see many familiar faces in each of his movies, and many of them are inserted as callbacks or Easter eggs to some of his earlier films. One of his best pairings, though, is with Drew Barrymore. The two first worked together on The Wedding Singer, playing a singer and waitress who fall in love while working at the same event hall in the 1980s, and their chemistry is astounding.\n\nFive years after The Wedding Singer, Sandler and Barrymore reunited in 50 First Dates, which is arguably their best collaboration. What worked previously improved, and you can't help but fall in love with both of them as Sandler's character learns to be a more caring man while falling for Barrymore's character, who has an inability to form new memories and forgets each day after she's lived it. Barrymore and Sandler even tried it a third time in 2014 with Blended, and while the film works well enough, it never rose to the same level of popularity as their first two joint hits.\n\nIn the early '90s, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson worked together on several pictures without interacting with one another, including Loaded Weapon 1 and Pulp Fiction. While they had roles in both films, there wasn't any on-screen chemistry. Fortunately, they fixed this problem in 1995 with the release of Die Hard with a Vengeance, where Willis plays action hero John McClane and Jackson joins as his reluctant partner Zeus Carver as they attempt to stop a terrorist (Jeremy Irons). The Die Hard sequels have a lot of issues with fans, but you'd be hard-pressed to find any who didn't love seeing these two share the screen.\n\nTheir on-screen chemistry fortunately got another shot in 2000 when they teamed up for Unbreakable, with Willis playing the hero who discovers latent superpowers thanks to machinations from Jackson's string-pulling supervillain. They didn't stop there, and they teamed up again for a final film in the Unbreakable trilogy, Glass, in 2019.\n\nOwen Wilson and Ben Stiller have been longtime collaborators, having first worked together in The Cable Guy. They followed this with Permanent Midnight, but their next hit collaboration was in Meet the Parents in 2000. That film showed their on-screen chemistry with far more interaction than they previously had, as Wilson plays the seemingly perfect ex of Stiller's character's fianc√©e.\n\nA year later, Stiller and Wilson played duel leads in Zoolander, and this was the movie that proved they could handle themselves perfectly on screen together. Both embody the stylish naivete of their respective male model characters, Derek Zoolander (Stiller) and Hansel (Wilson), while going from rivals to unlikely friends on a quest to stop a brainwashing plot. Since then, their collaborations have only continued thanks to their amazing comedic dynamic."
