Explore the inside drama of daily life on America’s campuses. Discover why many believe the lethal maneuvers in the Pentagon truly pale in comparison to the power and politics that permeate the hallways behind the Ivory Tower’s facade. Walk through the serene veil that obscures the true nature of many universities.\n\nBehind the distinguished brick architecture and the peaceful serenity of flowers, trees, and landscaped grounds, there is a brutish private face of academia that few discern. Beyond the boundaries of classroom walls, the routine activities of teaching and learning become secondary, negligible efforts. In this story, you will encounter an organizational culture where anger, greed, arrogance, and prejudice nurture and reward corruption. Examine the intrigue behind a complex set of relationships where power brokers strike unholy deals and crush those who stand in their way. Experience the undercurrents of unabashed evil where senior faculty “eat their young” and many campus administrators believe, like Machiavelli, the end always justifies the means."
