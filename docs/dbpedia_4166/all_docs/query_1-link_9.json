        "text": "I FOUND MY WAY to Wallace Stegner by accident. Really through three identical accidents, lightning strikes that I’m only now beginning to suspect were signs.\n\nGiven Stegner’s lifelong fascination with the American West, a landscape simile seems appropriate. His writing, which includes memoir, history, biography and reportage as well as more than a dozen works of fiction, is like a vast prairie, its fertile valleys and desert patches shadowed by three mighty peaks.\n\nI stumbled on them in reverse order. Sometime in the late 1990s I pulled “Crossing to Safety” (1987), his affectionate, elegiac chronicle of the decades-long friendship between two literary couples, from the jumbled shelf of a vacation-rental cottage during a spell of gloomy summer weather. The same thing happened with the sprawling, multigenerational “Angle of Repose” (1971) in a different cabin a decade later, and with Stegner’s career-making, semi-autobiographical fifth novel, “The Big Rock Candy Mountain” (1943), earlier this year. It was waiting for me in a temporary apartment in a faraway city.\n\nThis is how it seems to be with Stegner now. You can usually find a copy or two of at least one of those books in a decent bookstore, but there is no Library of America collection of his writing (an honor recently bestowed on two of his former students, Robert Stone and Wendell Berry). His oeuvre occupies impressive shelf space in university libraries, but his name, though still attached to the creative writing fellowship program he established at Stanford after World War II, is hardly a fixture on college syllabuses or in the pages of scholarly journals.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
