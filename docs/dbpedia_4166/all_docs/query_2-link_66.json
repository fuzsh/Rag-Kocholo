Picture yourself amidst the ordinary rhythms of life, navigating through your day on a rainy afternoon, when suddenly, a cataclysmic force interrupts the tranquility.\n\nIn 1889, in the heart of Pennsylvania, the South Fork Dam burst, and what followed was a monstrous wall of water, holding within it 3.8 billion gallons, surged forth with terrifying speed for the towns below. But this was not just water; it was a relentless force of nature, carrying along with it a deadly payload of buildings, livestock, and debris. Its origins traced back to the Cambria Ironworks, where it amassed a deadly arsenal of barbed wire and railroad cars before hurtling towards unsuspecting communities.\n\nAt 40 miles per hour, there was no escape from its wrath. Residents were thrust into a nightmare scenario, facing the impossible task of outrunning a deluge of biblical proportions. The sheer force of the flood tore through the landscape, ripping the very topsoil from the earth as it swept everything in its path with the unstoppable ferocity only moving water can possess.\n\nIn today's episode, we delve into the chilling details of the Great Johnstown Flood, a calamity etched into the annals of history as a stark reminder of nature's awesome power and humanity's vulnerability in the face of its fury. Tune in as we uncover the tragic events and explore the profound impact this disaster had on the lives of those caught in its merciless grip.\n\nJoin Kaycee McIntosh and Julie Henningsen as they uncover the gripping tale of sea captain Christopher B. Sheldon and his fateful journey aboard the Albatross. In this episode of \"The Crux True Survival Stories\" podcast, listeners are transported back to 1961, where Sheldon's Ocean Academy becomes the backdrop for a chilling encounter with nature's fury.\n\nThrough Julie's narrative, audiences are introduced to the Albatross's rich history, tracing its journey from the North Sea to its role as an educational vessel. With vivid detail, she recounts the tragic events of May 2nd, 1961, when a sudden white squall capsizes the Albatross, leaving its crew, including Sheldon's wife Alice, in a fight for survival on the open sea.\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, Julie delves into the courageous efforts of the survivors and the enduring legacy of Christopher Sheldon. From Coast Guard investigations to Sheldon's later endeavors with the Peace Corps, the Albatross saga exemplifies the resilience of the human spirit in the face of hardship.\n\n\"The Crux True Survival Stories\" offers a captivating exploration of courage and tragedy, where each twist and turn reveals the extraordinary lengths we'll go to survive against all odds.

Alvero has created an incredible business called Docastaway in which he transports his clients to desert islands (or as most of you may know them as deserted islands). He fell in love with the beauty and isolation that desert islands offer at a young age and has taken that passion and shared it with others who would never otherwise have the experience. Alvaro has had an interest in castaway stories since his childhood and he has had the opportunity to speak to a number of castaways himself. One of these such castaways is Maurice Baley. Alvaro had the opportunity to befriend Maurice and hear the story first hand.\n\nMaurice and his wife Maralyn Bailey, were a British married couple who, in 1973, embarked on a journey that turned into an extraordinary tale of survival. The couple sold all of their things and bought a yacht. Their intended journey in 1973 was from Southampton, England, to New Zealand. They set sail on their 31-foot yacht Auralyn with the plan to reach New Zealand, passing through the Panama Canal in February and heading towards the Galapagos Islands. However, their voyage took a tragic turn when their yacht was struck by a whale on March 4, 1973, leading to a series of events that resulted in their survival at sea for 118 days on a rubber raft in the Pacific Ocean. They later wrote a book titled 117 Days Adrift, despite their actual ordeal lasting longer than 117 days.\n\nJoin us today as we delve into the fascinating world of Docastaway and explore the incredible story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey—a testament to the will to survive, resilience in the face of adversity, and the unwavering support the couple provided each other to keep going against all odds.\n\nFor more information about this story and Docastaway, including an interview with Alvaro and Maurice, visit https://paradise.docastaway.com/maurice-maralyn-bailey/\n\nIf you are interested in an incredible vacation on a desert island, or if you are just curious, visit docastaway.com.\n\nThank you for listening, we appreciate all of your support!\n\nIn April 1989, climbers Jim Sweeney and Dave Nyman embarked on a challenging ascent of the Elevator Shaft on Mount Johnson in the Ruth Gorge, Alaska.

They took the cable car to a Mountain station and set off on their walk. Little did they know that this hike would be more than just seeing nature's beauty. Being unfamiliar with the terrain and the trails, they soon became disoriented and lost in the wilderness. With no map or GPS to refer to, they had no way of finding their way back.\n\nFacing mounting exhaustion and hunger, Gina and Brandon made a discovery! A deserted camp site with some supplies. They experienced feelings of dread when they realized the supplies belonged to another individual who became lost in the wilderness with no hopes of rescue, but the discovery finally lead to their recovery days after they initially set off on their hike.\n\nThe Granite Mountain/Speculator Mine Disaster of June 8, 1917 is one of the most momentous events in US mining history. In the depths of Butte, Montana's copper mine, tragedy unfolded that day as a fiery inferno engulfed the tunnels and filled them with searing smoke. The miners had been toiling away at full production to support America in World War I and were pushing for better working conditions. Little did they know that their efforts would be in vain, as 168 of them died that day due to suffocation from the fire consuming their oxygen supply. It was a devastating blow to Butte, Montana and the nation and stands today as one of the worst underground hard rock mining disasters in US history. Mining will never be the same.\n\nA hundred years have passed since that fateful day, but its memory still lingers in Butte, and its legacy lives on as a reminder of the danger and sacrifice of mining. The Granite Mountain/Speculator Mine Disaster forever stands as a testament to those brave miners who gave their lives in service to their nation.\n\nWolf Wagner (25) and Johannes Hoentsch (26) had no idea what they were in for when they set out into the Canadian wilderness via canoe mid July 2017. Armed with a few maps, gps device, supplies, and their canoe, Wagner and Hoentsch navigated their way through the beautiful, but often treacherous northern Manitoba waters.\n\nAs they made their way downstream, the stunning Canadian landscape unfolded before them - crystal blue lakes, vast marshlands, and thick forests filled with wildlife.\n\nBut this idyllic adventure soon took a dangerous turn when they realized the river was not as easy to navigate as they once thought. They entered some rapids and their canoe hit a large rock and was shattered beyond repair. With no way to continue on their journey, the two men had to rely on their own ingenuity and skill for self-rescue.\n\nSteven Callahan's incredible story of survival against all odds is inspiring. In 1981, he was left adrift in the Atlantic Ocean for a harrowing 76 days after his sailing vessel sunk during a storm. With nothing but ingenuity and perseverance, he managed to survive on the open sea with minimal resources.\n\nDespite facing incredible difficulties such as intense storms, lack of food, and dehydration, Callahan was able to stay afloat and document his journey. His memoir, Adrift: Seventy-six Days Lost at Sea, became a best-selling book in which he tells the story of his remarkable struggle for survival against all odds.\n\nCallahan has also been awarded three U.S. patents for inventions related to boats and navigation. His inventive spirit and his ability to overcome adversity inspired many people around the world. Steven Callahan is an example of resilience, strength, and courage in the face of seemingly impossible odds.\n\nSimply put, his story is a true testament to the power of human will and perseverance; an amazing tale that serves as an inspiration for us all.\n\nLaurent Camprubi had been sailing for almost two decades, but nothing could have prepared him for the situation he found himself in. One minute he was attempting to qualify for the prestigious Route de Rhum race - a fiercely competitive 4,077 mile sailing competition - and the next his sailboat had capsized in rough waters.\n\nHe managed to stabilize his body within an air bubble at the bottom of his cabin. With no way out and only his wits and limited supplies, Laurent knew that if he wanted to survive this ordeal, he'd need every ounce of courage within him.\n\nThe ocean around him seemed determined to keep Laurent from ever competing again; waves crashed against the boat like they were trying their best to sink it further into their depths. But somehow Laurent held on as time passed by slowly yet steadily—every hour feeling like an eternity until something unexpected happened: a knock on the side of the overturned boat. It was then when hope truly ignited in Laurent's heart - maybe there still was a chance after all!\n\nAdrian and Garrett set out to explore Misty Fjords National Park on September 14, 2013, full of hope and enthusiasm for the adventure that lay ahead. Little did Adrian know that the journey would prove to be the biggest test of his strength and courage. The two were not aware that it would be their last hunting trip together. After a tragic accident, Adrian found himself alone, stranded on a sand bar with rising tides, facing down nature at its most fierce and unforgiving. With no means of communication, he had to rely solely on his own knowledge and his will to tell Garrett's family what happened to him to survive. For seven long days, Adrian battled against extreme temperatures and a hostile environment in a desperate attempt to await rescue.\n\nAlso, sorry guys, I was having problems with my recording devise and was not able to add any music to this episode.
