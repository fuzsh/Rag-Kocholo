He describes his initial approach and technique for managing these advanced cataracts, including the unexpected complication of a dropped lens and capsular bag tear in the first eye. Weeks after referring the patient to a retina specialist for an eventual good outcome, Dr. Trattler began surgery on the second eye, only to encounter a similar complication."
