My daughters.\n\nThis book has a picture of my daughters with their father, Eric, which I value. They are part of the author's journey and are mentioned in the book: \"Eric was already living in Miami with his wife and two kids\", page59.\n\nHowever, there is also a picture of Eric and his wife of not more than 2 or 3 years; and as this is a book that is sold in the web to whoever is interested in this topic (and that I hope many people buy because I consider it interesting in many ways), I have to clear out, that Eric's daughters are not related to the lady in said picture.\n\nThe author has my sincere wishes of health, success and happiness.\n\nI was there then and I am still here.\n\nRelationships can change, but memories and feelings stay."
