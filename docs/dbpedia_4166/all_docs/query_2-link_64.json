You've been fishing then?\n\nAye.\n\nYou know, I'd never once been out in that loch, not once.\n\nLooks like it's about to rain.\n\nWould you like lift into town?\n\nNah, nah, I like to walk, Maggie.\n\nWell.\n\nSee you later then.\n\n[car starts]\n\n[thunder cracks]\n\nOh.\n\n[intense orchestral music]\n\nOh no Don, again.\n\n[intense orchestral music continues]\n\n[muffled voice]\n\nI've never met the woman.\n\nIt's still nice of Brady to send a wee card.\n\nOh good, you're awake!\n\nBrady?\n\nAye.\n\nBrady?\n\nWell, the whole town's worried,\n\nthough I told them not to be.\n\nDon't worry about Donald Campbell I said,\n\nthis is just his thing.\n\nWe all have something, a wee imperfection.\n\nI myself have two big toes on my left foot.\n\nHave to get me shoes made specially.\n\nI think you should go home now Maggie.\n\nOf course.\n\nYou need your rest.\n\nAh, struck twice by lightning, it's a miracle.\n\nCan I go yet?\n\nYeah of course you can, there's barely a scratch on you.\n\nYou know, we were just talking about this\n\nin the cafeteria and it's truly fascinating\n\nand incredible actually.\n\nWhy is it happening?
