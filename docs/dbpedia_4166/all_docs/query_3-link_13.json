Matt designed this electrifying beast as a Storm Dragon, and even created an amazing Reference Sheet to go along with it:\n\nI really love the wings, and the smaller frills in the center on the Wingspan image, which Matt explains: “The large fins located directly behind the wings are used for extra lift in flight, functioning effectively the same as a bird’s tail would.” Of the wings themselves, Matt says: “Wing and fin membranes are naturally black, but bio-luminescent green is triggered via an electrical charge which can be held within the membrane itself.” Very cool!\n\nHere is one more image of Matt’s dragon Blacktalons with a brighter background, called Storm in a Frozen World. This is one talented artist, and I definitely recommend checking out his gallery for more great work!\n\nTake care, and stay creative!"
