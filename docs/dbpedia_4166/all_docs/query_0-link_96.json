        "text": "full name: John Richard Moore, Jr.\n\nchildhood nickname: Dickie\n\nadult nickname: Dick\n\nborn Sep. 12, 1925, in Los Angeles, CA\n\ndied Sep. 7, 2015, in Wilton, CT\n\n1926\n\nAs he describes in his 1984 book, Dickie was 11 months old when he made his film debut in \"The Beloved Rogue,\" which means that the film was at least partially shot in late August or early September of this year. As the story goes, a friend of his mother's was living in their home, and this friend was Joseph Schenck's secretary. One day, when her car wasn't working, a casting director came to the house to give her a lift to work. The casting director took one look at Dickie and asked if he might possibly try out for the role of John Barrymore as a baby. After a day or two of coaxing, Dickie's mother finally agreed.\n\n1927\n\nA clue to the sparcity of Dickie's film work during this period may come from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of Apr. 18, 1932: \"For some reason, he decided to have his attacks of temperament early, and when he was a year and a half old he let his artistry get the better of him. But when his mother retaliated and took him out of pictures altogether for a while, Dickie reformed and promised to be good.\" The Oakland Tribune of August 13, 1933, described it this way: \"Dickie was a great little actor at 12 months, but at 18 months he suddenly developed a horror of studios and would roar his head off when taken on a lot. Nobody could do anything with him for two years, when he, just as suddenly, got over his antipathy and became a sturdy little actor once more.\"\n\nThe Beloved Rogue (small part: Baby Francois)\n\nMar. 12, 1927 - Feature/UA - 10 reels - silent - John Barrymore feature\n\n©Feb. 23, 1927. Includes musical score.\n\n1928\n\nAccording to the previous reports on Dickie's unwillingness to act during this early period, he returned to movies in the early part of 1929. However, as can be seen by his filmography, he seems to have made his return around mid-1928.\n\nPlastered In Paris (undetermined role)\n\nSep. 23, 1928 - Fox - 6 reels - silent - Sammy Cohen & Jack Pennick feature\n\n©Sep. 11, 1928.

Credited as Dickey Moore.\n\n1929\n\nAccording to Harrison Carroll in his August 9, 1943, syndicated column: \"Fourteen years ago, (Lloyd) Bacon was testing kids for Al Jolson's 'Sonny Boy.' Most promising youngster had to drop out because he got the measles. Davy Lee was signed for the part. The kid with the measles? - Dickie Moore.\" The film credit is a bit confusing, since two films were made, both with Davy Lee as \"Sonny Boy.\" Only one of them had Al Jolson in it, and that was \"The Singing Fool.\"\n\nBlue Skies (undetermined role)\n\nMar. 17, 1929 - Fox - 6 reels - silent - Helen Twelvetrees & Frank Albertson feature\n\n©Mar. 18, 1929.

Newspaper reviews of the films in which he appeared during this year routinely singled him out, and it's clear that he was achieving child stardom by the end of the year.\n\nLummox (undetermined role)\n\nprem.

Starring Kay Francis, Charles Bickford, Kay Johnson, Lewis Stone and ZaSu Pitts.\n\n1931\n\nOn April 29th of this year, Dickie, along with fellow boy star Dick Winslow, greeted honorary boy-city officials and acted as masters of ceremonies for a stage show at the Carthay Circle Theater in observance of Boys' Week.\n\nOn June 20th, Dickie, along with other young players from \"Seed,\" made a personal appearance at the Orpheum in Los Angeles.\n\nOn September 14th the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Dickey Moore has been signed by Warners for an important role in 'Sob Sister,' although he is only 2½ years of age. Dickey is said to be not only a fine little actor but a wonder at memorizing as well.\" Dickie was actually five years old at this time.\n\nOn September 21st, Louella Parsons reported that Warner Bros. had signed Dickie to a longterm contract. This was largely due to the positive feedback the studio was getting after Dickie's appearance in \"The Star Witness.\" On October 8th, the Spokane Daily Chronicle reported that it was a 5-year contract.\n\nOn December 19th, The Greenfield Daily Reporter (IN), reported the following: \"Although five-year-old Dickie Moore is now a full-fledged moving picture star, making more money than lots of men, he goes to school like any other boy of his age and finds reading, writing and arithmetic much harder than acting before the cameras. Dickie spends three hours every week-day during the winter in the Little Red Schoolhouse on the movie lot and sometimes, when no pictures are in production, he is the only boy in his class. He regards the movies as a sort of game, much more fun than school. He gets a dime every day he works well and a new toy whenever a picture is finished, which pleases him immensely. Dickie is making his radio debut in one of the forthcoming programs of the Radio Newsreel of Hollywood which will feature the film lot schoolhouse. And when he grows up and is through school this young star says he wants to be a garbage man so he can wear white gloves.\"\n\nOn December 21st, Dickie was among several juvenile stars who entertained at the annual children's Christmas party at the Biltmore Hotel for the Los Angeles Electric Club.\n\nOn December 23rd, Louella Parsons reported that Warner Bros. was planning to build Dickie up into becoming the next Jackie Cooper.\n\nOn December 28th, George E. Helmer of the United Press had this to say: \"Dickie Moore, child movie star, unlike many of his elders, never forgets a spoken part or a cue, and seldom has to be prompted. He has some long and difficult lines in 'Manhattan Parade,' and during the filming of the picture he portrayed his role without a hitch. The six-year-old boy amuses himself with make believe plays while not working. He has appeared in pictures since he was a few months old, having been selected for his big blue eyes and laughing good humor.\"\n\nAloha (role: Junior Bradford)\n\nApr. 27, 1931 - Tiffany - 9 reels - Ben Lyon & Raquel Torres feature\n\n©Feb. 4, 1931.\n\nSeed (role: Johnny Carter as a child)\n\nMay 14, 1931 - Universal - 11 reels - feature\n\n©Apr. 28, 1931.

Filmed in 2-strip Technicolor.\n\n1932\n\nAccording to Dickie in his 1984 book, \"Big Little Books appeared about my life and some of the characters I played.\" Exactly when these came out and how many there were is proving to be difficult to research.\n\nOn January 10th of this year, the Tampa Sunday Tribune reported the following: \"A scene was being made in which 5-year-old Dickie must cry on Chic Sale's shoulder. Dickie was unable to get into the proper spirit. He couldn't cry as though he meant it. After several attempts, Director Archie Mayo held a whispered consultation with young Moore's mother. Then he ordered a 'take.' In the midst of it there was an interruption as Dickie's mother pushed her way onto the set. As she started to say something, Mayo shouted: 'Mrs. Moore, please get off the set and stay off! I'll do this without your help!' The moment was one of agonized wonderment for the little actor. He had never heard his mother talked to that way before. Calloused as he is to trickery, real tears began to fall.\"\n\nOn January 11th, The Los Angeles Record reported the following: \"Dickie Moore is only 6 years old, but he has a false tooth. Warners-First National gave it to him. They had to. He was half way through his part in \"Old Man Minnick\" when out came one of his front teeth. Many scenes had been taken. There were just as many to follow, and lots of the shots were to be closeups. So off Dickie went to the dentist's and had a bridge made. In between shots he amuses himself by taking it in and out. He labors under the impression that he is completely disguised with one tooth missing.\"\n\nLater in the same article: \"One scene in his present picture he devised himself, without any help from the scenario department. Time seemed long on the set, between the lessons, which are given him by a tutor, and the periods before the camera. One set is supplied with a bathtub. And one of his scenes is where he wanders in from the rain, and Grandpa Minnick takes off his wet clothes so that he can have a hot bath. Dickie discovered that he could soap the back of the tub, and make a great splash when he slid down. He played at it during one wait. When the director was ready to shoot, he discovered the whole company watching the little boy. The scene was so funny that cameras were quietly set up, and Dickie was caught without ever knowing that he was earning his salary.\"\n\nOn January 26th, the Daily News of New York reported that Dickie would soon be starring in a feature film called \"From Rags To Riches.\" On January 27th, the Standard Union of Brooklyn reported that it would be a Warners film and that: \"Maude Fulton is preparing a modernized version of this famous story of American boyhood.\" It appears that this film was never made. Dickie was soon dropped by Warners and signed by Hal Roach.\n\nEarly this year, Dickie was loaned to Fox to appear in \"Disorderly Conduct.\"\n\nOn February 6th, Dickie made a personal appearance at the Warner Bros. Hollywood Theatre in Los Angeles, in conjunction with a screening of \"The Expert.\"\n\nAlso on February 6th, the Los Angeles Record had this to say about Dickie's appearance in \"The Expert\": \"Dickie has a most remarkable memory. In this picture he has more spoken lines than in any other picture in which he has played, almost as many as Sale himself. Altogether, Dickie has 182 lines to speak. He has a total of 1707 words in the entire play, coming in for a part in almost every sequence. And he not only had to memorize his own lines perfectly, but has to know the lines of the other players so that he can take his cues. 'It is really remarkable that he never forgets lines,' said Director Archie Mayo, 'and that we never had to give him a cue. I think he memorized practically the entire script. And the boy knows what the words mean, as well as being able to recite them. I did not have to tell him what words to emphasize. He doesn't act his part. He lives it. He actually feels it. That is why he is so wonderful for a boy of his age.' \"\n\nAlso on February 6th, the Courier-Post of Camden, NJ, reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, kid player, working in 'Disorderly Conduct' at Fox, was invited to lunch by Spencer Tracy. Having a youngster of his own, Tracy figured he knew what kids should eat so ordered a vegetable plate. Next three times Tracy invited the kid for lunch, the youngster always begged off. When cornered, Dickie admitted he had no other appointments, but added: 'I gotta eat spinach at home.' \"\n\nOn February 24th, The Evening Sun of Baltimore, MD, reported the following: \"One successful motion-picture actor may scoff at proper diction and get away with it. He can use incorrect grammar, slur over words and fail to pronounce 'th' without incurring the wrath of directors. He is Dickie Moore, 6, and he calls his mother 'muvver' and his father 'favver.' No attempt has been made to teach him the correct diction.\"\n\nOn February 25th, the Daily News of New York revealed that Dickie had just had his tonsils removed the previous day, and that he was due to start a film called \"The Main Event\" within a couple of days (this turned out to be \"Winner Take All\"). On March 9th, The Evening Journal of Wilmington, DE, reported the following: \"Dickie Moore and his mother both in a hospital. Dickie's mother always is with him at the studio, so when he went to have his tonsils removed he insisted that she go along. She did and had her's out, too.\"\n\nOn March 2nd, Robbin Coons wrote the following: \"An unspoiled youngster is 6-year-old Dickie Moore. He is a regular boy, looks like a cherub, and is as 'cute' in real life as on the screen, but he doesn't know it or care if he does. His mother and father - the latter's a banker - treat him like a human being. He isn't a precocious movie child to them, and they don't quote the 'cute sayings of Dickie' on any and all occasions. He is bright without being 'smart.' A new Dickie Moore anecdote illustrates his honest frankess: A director who had just finished a picture in which Dickie worked was asking him which of all his directors he liked the best. 'John Stahl,' was Dickie's reply. 'Next best?' Dickie named another, next another, and finally, in fifth place, came the director doing the questioning. 'Don't I come better than fifth?' he asked finally. 'Well,' said Dickie, 'there's a lot more I didn't even mention!' \"\n\nOn March 20th, The Davenport Democrat and Leader (IA), reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, Warner Bros.' five-year-old starlet, had a tonsil operation performed in Hollywood this week. He will soon be at the studio again to play his part in the new James Cagney picture, 'Winner Take All,' which has just entered production under the direction of Roy Del Ruth, with Marion Nixon as leading woman.\"\n\nOn March 26th, Dickie made a personal appearance at the Ritz theater in San Bernardino, CA.\n\nOn April 8th, Dickie was signed to a longterm contract with Hal Roach Studios, the effective dates being May 9, 1932, to May 8, 1937. The Angola Herald (IN) of April 29th indicated that Warners had recently dropped Dickie.\n\nOn April 11th, Louella Parsons wrote the following: \"I have never known Hal Roach to sign any child star who was well known until he signed Dickie Moore. He usually prefers to develop the youngster himself. Many of them join the Our Gang comedies while they are babes in arms. Jackie Cooper's first job was at the Roach studios and dozens of other children have started there, but Dickie was not signed until he became a headline. The Roach studio opens officially May 2nd, when Dickie moves in. In the meantime, he is playing in Marlene Dietrich's picture, 'Velvet'.\"\n\nAs the Daily News of New York reported on April 13th: \"Master Dickie Moore, who's quite a sensation...in feature films, yesterday signed his services over to Hal Roach for 'Our Gang' shorts. Mamma and a lawyer witnessed the proceedings which made Dickie a member of the famous kiddie group. And producer Roach agreed to certain clauses in the contract which permit Master Moore time out for parts in other companies' big pictures. For instance, Dickie is wanted for a role in the new Marlene Dietrich production 'Velvet.' \" The Dietrich film eventually came out under the title \"Blonde Venus.\"\n\nOn April 13th, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, 6-year-old motion picture actor, today had in his possession a contract with Hal Roach Studios newly ratified by Superior Judge H. Parker Wood. The contract, approved by Judge Wood yesterday, guarantees Dickie's salary graduated upward from $225 a week to $525 a week over a period of five years.\"\n\nOn April 14th, the Waterbury Evening Democrat reported the following: \"Dickie Moore is going to make a picture for Bryan Foy. He'll get $350 a week for three weeks.\" This seems to refer to \"No Greater Love,\" since Foy was associated with Columbia Pictures.\n\nOn April 18th, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported the following: \"Dickie's normality is wholly due to his mother. Most movie mothers are the terrors of the studios and will talk without stopping for hours at a stretch to any one who will listen, regarding the brilliance of their young hopeful and why he should be getting ten thousand a week. Mrs. Moore, however, is a refreshing exception and has no illusions concerning Dickie's precocity. Most of his success she attributes to his having had good directors who could tell him what to do, instead of to his innate genius. In fact, she is dubious as to whether he has any genius at all. 'Dickie just started in the first grade last Fall,' she says, 'and while he's a shark at arithmetic and is already doing second-grade work in that, he seems no brighter than the average child in everything else.' \"\n\nOn May 16th, Dickie began working in the Our Gang unit at $250 a week. During his tenure with the series, Dickie was loaned out so much that he never quite felt at home at the Roach studio, and more like a visitor.\n\nOn May 21st, The Los Angeles Record reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, grinning, half-pint size kid of Hal Roach's 'Our Gang' screen juveniles, climbed a ladder yesterday afternoon so he could punch big Ray Impellittiere's chin. Impellittiere, New York giant boxing sensation, is to feature the Culver City fight show on Monday night.\"\n\nOn May 22nd, The Brooklyn Daily Times and The Standard Union said this about Dickie: \"By his likes shall you know John Richard Moore, Jr., or, as you will more quickly recognize him - Dickie Moore, the adorable youngster of six-going-on-seven who plays a very important role in 'No Greater Love,' the Columbia picture showing at the Fox Brooklyn Theatre.\n\n\"Dickie has his screen favorites, the same as anyone else, and they're all male, Dickie thinking, quite politely, of course, that girls are sissies, more or less. So his favorites are Richard Barthelmess, with whom he played in 'Son of the Gods,' the Our Gang Kids, Chic Sale, Jackie Cooper, Joe E. Brown, James Cagney, Hoot Gibson and Warner Baxter.\n\n\"His favorite books are 'Tom Sawyer,' 'Beautiful Joe' and 'Black Beauty' and he looks forward to the day when he can read all the big words.\n\n\"He likes chicken white meat, chocolate cake and strawberry shortcake. He dislikes string beans and horehound candy, but he likes to eat - much and often!\n\n\"He goes in for sports in a large way. His favorite rainy day and after-dark sports are parchesi, lotto and checkers. He likes to go to a football game and is himself an expert at 'cops and robbers' and 'kick the can.'\n\n\"His first ambition was to be a garbage man and wear white gloves. Later he switched to a traffic policeman, and now, upon giving the matter more mature thought, he has decided to be a general.\n\n\"Dickie Moore was born in Los Angeles on September 12, 1925, and made his screen debut at the age of 11 months when he had a prominent role in John Barrymore's picture, 'The Beloved Rogue.' He devotes many hours a day to his lessons. He is in the first grade, studying hard so that he can read his part and study it by himself instead of having the director read the lines to him until he has memorized them.\"\n\nThe June 27th \"Screen Oddities\" by Captain Roscoe Fawcett had this to say about Dickie: \"Dickie Moore's parents refuse to permit him to see himself upon the screen in a completed picture because they are afraid he may become self-conscious and that his ability to act may suffer as a result.\"\n\nOn July 19th, The Columbus Enquirer-Sun of Columbus, GA, reported the following: \"Unlike most screen actors, Richard Moore is but little concerned with his salary or his place in the billing - but he does manifest considerable interest in his wardrobe. And when Mr. Moore, better known to millions of film fans as Dickie Moore, found he was going to wear an exact replica of a speed-cop's uniform all through 'Disorderly Conduct,' and could go out and direct traffic and have a gorgeous time with his police whistle, his six-year-old soul was considerably thrilled.\"\n\nOn August 1st, Elizabeth Yeaman of the Hollywood Citizen-News reported the following: \"An important cast is being lined up to support Mitzi Green in 'Little Orphan Annie' at Radio Pictures. Little Dickie Moore was borrowed from Hal Roach this morning for one of the leading roles. Eric Linden and Joseph Cawthorne also have big parts in the picture which will start as soon as Mitzi returns from the East.\" On August 22nd, Yeaman reported that plans had changed, and Buster Phelps was to wind up with the role.\n\nDuring August, Our Gang had an endorsement deal with J.C. Penney's Back To School promotion. Newspapers carried information about each Our Gang kid, with this to say about Dickie: \"Dickie Moore's birthday is Sept. 12 when he'll be 7 years old. He was born in Los Angeles. His ambition is to become a doctor or traffic policeman! He has blond hair, brown eyes, weighs 45 pounds and is 44 inches tall. He loves swimming, has several pets (a Scotty dog, 2 rabbits, a cat, goldfish and chameleon). His teddy bear is one of his favorite toys. He has a romance of two years' standing with a little neighbor girl; says he will marry her at the age of 25.\"\n\nOn August 28th, The Sunday Star of Washington, DC, reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, one of the cutest and most talented youngsters on the screen, has been signed by Charles R. Rogers for a featured role in 'Metropolitan Garage,' the third of eight features which Rogers will produce for Paramount. Little Dickie's sensational work in 'Blonde Venus' won him the part.\"\n\nOn September 23rd, George Shaffer reported the following in his syndicated column: \"In spite of Lita Grey Chaplin's continued legal and personal efforts to have her two children appear in the movies at the Fox studio, the Fox corporation has given up the idea, according to a statement today, and two other children have been engaged for the parts intended for Tommy Chaplin and Charlie Jr. One of the substitute actors is Dickie Moore. Production will start Monday (the 26th) on the story, tentatively titled 'Divided by Two,' which Frank Craven wrote specifically to feature the Chaplin youngsters. Thelma Todd may get the call to replace Lita, although this isn't definite yet. Dave Butler directs.\" As Dickie doesn't seem to have appeared in any Fox productions subsequent to this date, it can be assumed that he was dropped from the cast prior to filming.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter of October 25th reported: \"Hal Roach has loaned Dickie Moore to Bryan Foy for three weeks for a role in 'East of Fifth Avenue'.\" This was apparently a working title for \"Obey The Law,\" which was released in 1933.\n\nOn November 16th, the Hollywood Citizen-News ran a Buick ad in which it was said that thirty 1932 Buicks had been sold at Paramount since November 16, 1931. The ninth Buick in question was purchased by Dickie Moore.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter of December 23rd reported: \"I.E. Chadwick has completed arrangements with Hal Roach for the loan of Dickie Moore for the title role in 'Oliver Twist.' The producer, who releases through Monogram, said yesterday that no contracts had been signed and the definite assignment of the boy for the part would depend upon tests that will be made by Herbert Brenson, the picture's director. Jackie Searl is also tentatively set for a part, and Elizabeth Meehan is writing the screen play.\"\n\nDickie remembered one particular Christmas around this time in which he was guest of honor at a charity banquet and grand marshal of the Hollywood Santa Claus Parade.\n\nUnion Depot (role: little boy)\n\nprem.

He took the part of host in a party for Bob McGowan, the kids' director, when Bob celebrated his thirteenth anniversary as director of the Our Gang comedies. All the kids were present to help eat the cake.\" So, contrary to every other piece of evidence in existence, the Our Gang series began in early 1920.\n\nOn February 11th, the Ithaca Journal-News (NY), reported the following: \"It is announced that Colleen Moore, who has been away from motion pictures for two years, is returning under the M-G-M standard to make a sound-film drama called 'Lost,' in which she will play opposite 6-year-old Dickie Moore.\" So either the film wound up with a different title and a different child actor, or it wasn't made at all.\n\nOn March 20th, The Evening Sun of Baltimore reported the following: \"Buster Phelps, who played in 'Little Orphan Annie,' has been a trifle worried about his career lately. The family heard him telephoning to Dickie Moore, another child actor. Buster complained that in one picture he died, in the next they kidnapped him, in another he fell out of the kitchen window, and in the fourth they shot him. He came back from the telephone all smiles. 'Dickie says,' he reported, 'that he had to die today and they took it over twenty times. Say, don't kids ever have a good time in the movies?' \"\n\nOn March 29th, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported the following: \"Dickie likes movie work in general. The only trouble, says Dickie, is that his nurse insists on washing his face before every sequence - washing and then making up. Dickie doesn't mind being washed before meals. That, he says, is just one of those things a feller has to take. But before every sequence - well, he thinks, that's carrying a good thing too far.\"\n\nOn April 3rd, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"For some time now Dickie Moore has been drawing down $250 a week, a sizable salary for a 7-year-old film actor. But economic conditions have caught up with the prosperous lad, it was shown yesterday by the records of Superior Judge Marshall F. McComb's court, where Dickie obtained judicial approval of a proposal whereby he will accept a 50 per cent cut for six weeks under his contract with the Hal Roach studios.\n\nBy April 12th, newspaper ads began to appear for Oliver Twist Wash Suits, as worn by Dickie Moore. By the middle of June, these were routinely listed as Dickie Moore Wash Suits.\n\nOn April 15th, The San Francisco Examiner reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, who plays the title role in 'Oliver Twist' at the Fox, will be honor guest at a reception beginning today at 4 p.m. in the boys' department of the City of Paris. Seated upon a small throne erected for the occasion, the 7-year-old Hollywood star will personally greet his young admirers and friends. All of Young San Francisco is invited to the store to make his acquaintance.\"\n\nOn May 26th, the Venice Evening Vanguard (CA), on writing about the May 29th Memorial Day program at the Culver City Auto Speedway, reported the following: \"Dickie Moore and Peggy Montgomery, film stars, are slated to be honored guests at the races which will get under way at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, with qualifying laps starting at noon, according to the speedway management.\"\n\nDickie's photo appeared on the sheet music for a song called \"Poor Oliver Twist,\" with lyrics by Joan Jasmyn and music by M.K. Jerome.\n\nOn June 3rd, The Oil City Derrick (PA), ran an ad for \"Oliver Twist\" in which the local theater was offering an \"Oliver Twist-Dickie Moore Candy Bar\" to the kids who showed up for the afternoon matinee.\n\nOn June 11th, The San Francisco Examiner ran a full-page ad for Best Foods mayonnaise, with endorsements by Claudette Colbert and Dickie Moore.\n\nThe Oakland Tribune of June 16th reported that \"Dickie Moore is out at the Roach studio when an option renewal called for a higher stipend.\" Dickie's final day under contract with Roach was July 8th. According to the Visalia Times-Delta of July 14th, Dickie (that is, his parents) had refused a cut in salary. The Hollywood Reporter of July 14th reported: \"The Hal Roach contract with Dickie Moore has been dropped by the company and the boy enters the ranks of free lance players.\"\n\nDuring this year, a Brazilian children's magazine called O Tico-Tico ran a multi-part comic strip featuring the Our Gang kids, and included Dickie among them.\n\nOn August 4th, The Los Angeles Record, covering the Southern California Kennel Club, reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, juvenile screen star, will be guest of honor tonight and will present the floral victory blanket to the winning greyhound in the eighth round.\" It's apparent elsewhere in the article that this club was in Compton, which is odd given the next entry on this list for August 6th.\n\nOn August 6th, News-Pilot of San Pedro, CA, reported the following: \"It will be 'Dickie Moore Night' at the Compton racing strip tonight when the little six year old star of the screen will be guest of honor and present the winner of the 'Dickie Moore handicap' with a floral blanket. The young screen star, reputed to be earning a salary of $1500 per week, is a rabid greyhound enthusiast despite his years and has been to several performances at the Compton track since the start of the summer meeting.\" So was Dickie guest of honor twice in three days, or did the sports writers get their dates mixed up?\n\nOn September 1st, The Evening News of Harrisburg, PA, published a photo of Dickie with Shirley Temple as the two took part in a puppet show given for charity by the Hollywood Assistance League.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter of September 5th reported that Dickie had been signed by Paramount to appear in \"Cradle Song.\"\n\nOn September 6th, Eileen Percy reported that the film \"Night Flight,\" after a successful preview, was going to receive a newly-shot romantic sequence with Robert Montgomery and Elizabeth Allan, and that \"Dickie Moore is practically set for the part of their son.\" This last detail never came to fruition.\n\nOn December 1st, the Post-Record of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, who appears in 'Man's Castle' in support of Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young at the RKO-Hillstreet theater, will make a personal appearance on the stage to greet the children in the audience tomorrow afternoon.\"\n\nOn December 19th, The San Francisco Examiner reported the following: \"Dickie Moore came all the way from Hollywood yesterday to arrive in time for personal appearances at four San Francisco theaters this afternoon. Dickie will be seen at today's matinee only at the Coliseum, in the Park-Presidio district, at El Rey, Ocean avenue and Victoria street, the Harding, Divisadero and Hayes and at the Metropolitan in Union street. Screen programs appropriate for children are arranged at all the above theaters today in connection with Dickie's appearance on the stage.\"\n\nOn December 28th, the Post-Record of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Ann Harding is an innocent bystander in Hollywood's newest and youngest love affair. It was love at first sight when she brought her daughter Joan to watch the filming of 'Gallant Lady,' her latest production for 20th Century Pictures. Seven-year-old Dickie Moore, also in the cast, spied Jane's taffy-colored curls and lost interest in his acting. So far, Dickie's friendship with women has given him something of an anti-feminine complex. He can not stand their calling him an 'adorable child.' But Jane was different. She wasn't pretending. She gave him a sophisticated stare and then smiled - and did Dickie tumble hard!\"\n\n120. Fish Hooky (featured role: Dickie Moore aka Dick)\n\nJan. 28, 1933 - Roach/MGM - 2 reels - prod.

Playing Dickie's character at a younger age is Scotty Beckett.\n\n1934\n\nOn January 25th of this year, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Miss Lois Horne, resident schoolteacher at the Warner Brothers studio, says little Dickie Moore is one of the most intelligent children she has taught. Miss Horne tutored him while he was playing in 'Upper World.' She gave him the standard State intelligence test and his I.Q. rating of 121 topped the list of 5779 child actors she has taught.\" Dickie was apparently getting smarter by the day, as on February 17th, the United Press reported his I.Q. to be 134.\n\nOn January 29th, Dickie made a personal appearance at Grauman's United Artists theater, which was showing \"Gallant Lady\" at the time.\n\nOn March 1st, Carmencita Johnson wrote the following while \"pinch-hitting\" for her brother Dick Winslow in his syndicated column: \"We went by Dickie Moore's the other day to see his new sister, Patricia Eileen. She surely is cute, with big round brown eyes like Dickie has, and a little round head covered with black curls. Dickie says he'd rather have a brother. Aunt Lucia (Mrs. Porter) went with us because she's very fond of Dickie, and she was amused because he said he wished the baby wouldn't squawk, but he guessed they'd keep her. Also it tickled her because when we went into Dickie's room, it was like a movie nursery, lovely little furniture, a great big motor boat Miss Tallulah Bankhead had given him, a perfectly enormous electric train Miss Marline(sic) Dietrich had given him, and just lines and lines of things from Miss Harding and different directors and stars had given him, because he's about the most popular child player in Hollywood. But instead of playing with all these animals and things, he was building a boat and was simply covered with paint. He gave Seessel Anne (Carmencita's sister) a big 'Hollywood pony' that is such a fad now as two had just come in for him. Did you see him in 'Gallant Lady?' It's scrumptious!\"\n\nOn April 14th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Dickie Moore's greatest worry is his fear that his cute little baby sister Pat may catch scarlet fever. Dickie is in quarantine and every day he asks if the baby is all right.\"\n\nOn May 17th, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported the following: \"Dickie Moore was 'just fine' today, he said, although he remained confined to his bed at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital where he underwent an operation for a scarlet fever mastoid, performed Friday (May 11th) by Dr. Leon D. Godshall. Dickie, a child feature player of several years' standing, expects to return to his home within a week.\" Dickie had been slated to make a personal appearance, along with several other child stars, on May 19th at the Gilmore Stadium in Hollywood as part of the Film Stars Frolic, but this obviously wasn't possible.\n\nOn May 19th, the Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Hollywood's latest character actor is 9-year-old Dickie Moore. That is, if Dickie is to be believed. The child star told Director Roy Del Ruth during the production of 'Upperworld'....that he was through with child parts. 'I've been playing child parts all my life,' declared Dickie. 'But this boy I play in the script is grown up. He has a definite character which I have to study and try to represent. It's a real character part.' \"\n\nOn May 22nd, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, child motion picture actor, today was back home after a siege of illness following an operation for a scarlet fever mastoid which kept him confined to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital about two weeks. Dickie was under the care of Dr. Leon D. Godshall, who performed the operation, and was dismissed from the hospital last night.\"\n\nOn May 30th, The Birmingham News reported the following: \"Little Dickie Moore has been quite ill, but he is recovering rapidly now. He underwent a successful mastoid operation a few weeks ago.\" In his 1984 book, Moore says that he caught scarlet fever, which led to an ear infection. His head was shaved for an emergency operation and there was some concern that he might not survive. He missed out on several months worth of work and upon returning, found that his star had fallen somewhat and that he would have to content himself with smaller parts going forward. Looking at his filmography, though, there doesn't seem to be much of a gap anywhere with the release dates (though the shooting dates are obviously the crucial factor), but there is a rash of poverty row films in the last part of 1934. As far as any sudden decrease in film roles, that's something that didn't happen until the following year.\n\nOn June 1st, Jerry Hoffman (filling in for Louella Parsons) reported on the upcoming Sol Lesser production of \"The Prince And The Pauper,\" with the following excerpt: \"Little Dickie Moore is now trying to get out of the hospital as quickly as possible to begin learning his parts as both prince and pauper.\" This, of course, never came to fruition, as the story wasn't brought to the screen until the 1937 Warners production.\n\nOn June 2nd, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Dickie had been considered for an important role in \"You Belong To Me,\" but that it wound up being played by David Holt. The San Francisco Examiner of August 18th reported that Dickie had actually been selected for the role. Holt wound up with a seven-year contract with Paramount after making the film.\n\nOn June 10th, the Chickasaw Daily Express of Chickasaw, OK, reported the following in a story about Lois Horne, a woman who tutored movie children: \"Dickie Moore is one of Miss Horne's favorite pupils, since teachers have their favorite pupils as well as children their favorite teachers. 'He has perfect manners, is a beautiful child and is as bright as he is good looking. He has a tiny new sister, who is as pretty as Dickies,' she said. 'Dickie wears a curl on his forehead, which his mother \"puts up\" every night. The second day after his mother went to the hospital Dickie was brought to the studio by his father. His hair was touseled, so I took him to the hair dresser to have it curled, that it might correspond to the scenes of the preceding day. After it had been curled he remarked, 'Well, daddy does most things best, but mother does this best.' \"\n\nThis Side Of Heaven (role: Freddie)\n\nFeb. 2, 1934 - MGM - 8 reels - Lionel Barrymore feature\n\n©Jan. 29, 1934.\n\nUpperworld (role: Tommy Stream)\n\nprem.

Members from both teams autographed a photo of Dickie Moore and had it forwarded to him in Hollywood.\n\nOn May 4th, Jimmy Starr wrote the following in his syndicated column: \"Little Dickie Moore, seven-year-old actor, is probably the best mannered child in this celluloid town of infant 'temperamentals,' but it was this polite lad who would have won praise from Emily Post herself that stamped his tiny feet, got red in the face and practically screamed at a studio supervisor and his (Dickie's) agent.\n\n\"Dickie was up for an important role of a major studio. Dickie, his mother and his agent, Harry Weber, went to the studio for an interview. Dickie's mother waited in the outer office. Suddenly, the door banged open and from it stamped the very angry and unruly Dickie. Rather than create a scene in the office, Dickie's mother took him home. She wondered what had happened.\n\n\"At home, Dickie was met by his father. 'How did you come out, son?' asked proud papa. 'I won't play the part!' fumed Dickie, who immediately answered his father's questioned gaze. 'It's this way, dad - they wanted me to play a girl! with a blond wig - with curls! Can you imagine what the kids would say?' Dickie's father suppressed his laughter, patted his son on the back, saying: 'That's right, son; I don't blame you.' \"\n\nOn August 5th, the United Press reported the following: \"Only a slight break in a movie career is necessary for people to begin wondering if a player is 'through.' Dickie Moore and his mother are rounding out a year of answering the oft-repeated question, 'What happened to Dickie Moore?' The young actor isn't through. He is just getting his stride again, for at his age - 9, to be exact - he has had the experience of a distressing interlude. 'I was just a little bit sick for a while,' Dickie explained when he was found on the 'Peter Ibbetson' set portraying Gary Cooper as a lad. His mother gave a more detailed explanation. In rapid succession, the boy came down with three different ailments in the middle of a busy program in pictures. 'There was little hope held for his recovery,' Mrs. Moore said. 'Of course, all his screen assignments were dropped. And when he did recover, I wouldn't let him do anything for a long time. It was a terrible shock almost losing him, and my only thought was to build him up to robust health before we let him work again.'\n\n\"It was Dickie who ultimately brought up the question of his career again, when he was hale and hearty. To him, it wasn't a matter of work or glamour. He considered his movie career just as inevitable as school, or eating. 'Dickie doesn't work as much now as he did before he was ill,' Mrs. Moore said. 'He was \"out of circulation\" so long that it takes a little while to get producers again in the habit of calling on him for roles. Dickie thought of course he would go right back to a lot of work.' 'Sure, I'm all ready,' Dickie announced. 'I'm an old trouper.' \"\n\nOn August 18th, the Los Angeles Times reported that Dickie was among more than 100 kids that had attended David Holt's birthday party, which was held on a soundstage at Paramount.\n\nOn December 10th, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"On the screen Tom Keene makes it a practice to save damsels in distress. Word received yesterday from Ontario, where he is on location, was that he proved himself a hero in real life. In a scene for 'Timothy's Quest' a horse which Dickie Moore was riding bolted and raced toward a 40-foot cliff. Keene leaped on another horse and snatched the hysterical youngster from the saddle of the fractious animal. Members of the company gave a testimonial dinner for Keene.\"\n\nWithout Children (role: David Sonny Cole Jr. as a child)\n\nprem.

Told that there was one scene in which he would have to take his fellow-trouper, Virginia Weidler, across his knees and administer a spanking, Dickie, without smiling, declared he thought he could go through that piece of business. Neither the director nor little Virginia was prepared for the fervor with which Dickie did the spanking. It was a perfect spanking. 'Just my way of relaxing,' said Dickie, when the camera had taken the shot. 'And anyway, I didn't want the scene to look faked.' \"\n\nOn March 13th, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Dickie would soon be leaving Hollywood on a personal appearance tour.\n\nOn April 3rd, a benefit show and fashion parade was presented by the Junior Trouper Club at the Hollywood Masonic Temple. Dickie was among several child actors scheduled to participate.\n\nOn June 27th, Dickie was part of the entertainment at Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC, where thousands of Democrats gathered to nominate Franklin Roosevelt for a second term as President.\n\nFrom June 19th to 26th, Dickie did a week's engagement at the Loew's Century Theater in Baltimore, appearing in a sketch called The Little Skipper. The Sun of June 21st mentions this engagement as the inauguration of a series of personal appearances, so presumably, this was the beginning of his tour. In his 1984 book, Dick mentions that it was a 13-minute act written by Arthur Lake (of \"Blondie\" fame). They typically did four shows a day and Dickie was the headliner.\n\nOn July 3rd, Dickie began an engagement at the Fox Theater in Detroit.\n\nSomewhere along the line, Dickie's tour reached Trenton, NJ, where he visited the governor. He also got to sit in the same electric chair that brought an end to Bruno Richard Hauptmann, who had kidnapped and murdered Charles Lindbergh, Jr. The execution had taken place on April 3rd, and Dickie states that his visit was three months later, so this would place it sometime during July.\n\nOn July 9th, the Lancaster New Era (PA), reported that Dickie would be performing at Steel Pier in Atlantic City over the weekend, presumably July 10th to 12th. The Pittsburgh Press of July 12th corroborated this.\n\nOn July 15th, the Berwyn Life (IL), reported that Dickie would be performing for a week's engagement at the RKO Palace theater starting July 19th.\n\nWhile he was unable to attend the 15th anniversary Our Gang reunion on July 18th of this year (due to making a personal appearance at the Palace Theatre in Chicago), Dickie did send a wired message that was read aloud during the festivities.\n\nOn July 31st, Movienews of Chicago ran a full-page article on Dickie, who was currently performing in Chicago. Dickie said the following about his recent time in jail: \"Mr. J. Edgar Hoover was swell to me when I was in Washington. He entertained me and told me some things about the criminals he had caught. Then when I got to Chicago, two grand detective-sergeants called at my dressing room. They introduced themselves and said they wanted to meet me. I said, 'Come right in fellas! But let's see your guns!' They told me about their work and some of the criminals they had caught here. Then they asked me if I wouldn't like to visit the courts building over there at 26th street and California avenue. I said, 'I certainly did want to visit that place.' And I saw everything! I saw court rooms, the dining room for the prisoners, the kitchen and even the electric chair. And somebody else, too....Mrs. Watchamacallit who shot her husband!\"\n\nPrompted by his mother, Dickie remembered the ride to the courthouse: \"Oh, yes. I almost forgot. We went over in the squad car and blew the siren all the way. Fast? Wow! Saawell! As we started for the courts building the detectives gave me a gun to carry just like they did. 'Course it wasn't loaded. When we got out there the desk sergeant at the jail door insisted that we check our guns. But we got 'em back when we came out.\"\n\nIn his 1984 book, Dick gets the sequencing switched around, describing going to Washington after leaving Chicago. He also mentions getting to visit the Oval Office, though President Roosevelt was in Philadelphia that day.\n\nAlso on July 31st, Dickie began a week's engagement in Toronto as part of a radio revue organized by NBC.\n\nOn August 17th, the Screen Boys' Club met at the home of W.S. Van Dyke to elect its officials, with Dickie in attendance.\n\nSince Dickie's personal appearance tour lasted a reported three months, it would have ended in September.\n\nOn October 11th, the Los Angeles Times included Dickie on the list of guests at Spanky McFarland's recent birthday celebration at the Venice Amusement Pier.\n\nLucky Stars (appearance)\n\nJan. 1936 - Paramount - 1 reel - Paramount Varieties series\n\n©Jan. 9, 1936.

The IMDb listing doesn't mention Dickie, but a Dec. 1935 photo circulated in the newspapers showing Dickie on set and playing checkers with the director, with both said to be working in \"Backfire.\" Alternatively, it could be that the caption was wrong and Dickie was merely visiting the set while working in \"The Story Of Louis Pasteur.\"\n\nStar For A Night (role: boy)\n\nAug. 28, 1936 - 20th Century-Fox - 76 min. - Claire Trevor & Jane Darwell feature\n\n©Aug. 28, 1936.\n\n1937\n\nSpecial note: during this period, there was an 18-year-old ingenue named Dickie Moore who was beginning to attract some attention. While I'm pretty confident that most of the items listed below pertain to the former Our Gang kid, I'm not entirely sure when it comes to the Dec. 15th entry. There was also some confusion when the 18-year-old signed with RKO, with about half of the coverage crediting the 11-year-old boy.\n\nAt the age of 11, Dickie briefly had a route in which he sold magazines door to door.\n\nIn May of this year, Dickie endorsed a toy scooter called The Rhythm Ride.\n\nOn June 20th, the Los Angeles Times reported that Freddie Bartholomew had recently thrown a party for Tommy Kelly at the MGM studio's executive bungalow. Dickie was among the hundred or so movie kids that attended.\n\nOn July 25th, Dickie was among 11 boys invited to Jack Egger's swimming party at the Hollywood Athletic Club.\n\nIn a questionnaire from October of this year, St. Louis moviegoers ranked Dickie as the 14th most popular child star with 94 votes out of 57,599. Shirley Temple received almost 20,000 of the votes.\n\nOn December 15th, members of the Junior Aid entertained at the third annual dinner-dance in the Biltmore Bowl in Los Angeles. This was to aid the Hebrew Sheltering Home for the Aged. Among the entertainers was Dickie Moore.\n\nOn December 17th, Dickie was among several child stars taking part in a Christmas benefit show at the Marcal Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nOn December 19th, Dickie, dressed in a cowboy outfit, attended a football game between two juvenile teams: the M-G-M Lions and the Sequoia Panthers.\n\nThe Life Of Emile Zola (role: Pierre Dreyfus)\n\nprem.

'Everybody Was Very Nice,' demanded that the makeup department supply him with a wig to wear home evenings. He didn't want the kids in the neighborhood to know he had his hair bleached for the role, in which he portrays Wayne Morris, male lead in the picture, during childhood.\" This film was released as \"Love, Honor And Behave.\"\n\nOn March 17th, The Stork Laid An Egg opened at the Lobero Theater in Santa Barbara, prominently featuring Dickie Moore as a spoiled child.\n\nOn May 12th, Jimmie Fidler reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Russell Saunders and Clarence Eurist, both former All-American football players, are assistant directors. They have been playing a lot of football with Bobbie(sic) Jordan, Dickie Moore, stand-ins for both boys, and several juvenile bit players. While I was on the set today, Bobbie and Dickie asked Director Farrow to hire stand-ins for the bit players. Farrow refused and, after a long argument, asked the two youngsters why they were so insistent. 'Just a couple more players,' Bobbie said, 'would make our football games an awful lot better.' \" The film everybody was working on was \"My Bill.\"\n\nOn June 14th, Sheilah Graham reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Twelve-year-old Dickie Moore, who does a neat job of thefting 'My Bill' from veteran actress Kay Francis, has been signed to a long term contract by Warners, with starring plans for the youngster who started his film acting career ten years ago.\" It appears that Graham got this last part wrong, as Dickie apparently never had a longterm contract after leaving the Roach studio.\n\nBy this time, Dickie's 4-year-old sister Pat had auditioned for a part in a show called \"Star Overnight,\" but didn't get the part. Virginia Vale's syndicated \"Star Dust\" column of June 14th reported that Pat was appearing in the Bette Davis film \"The Sisters.\" None of this activity amounted to much, as Pat wasn't particularly interested in film acting and apparently wasn't as good at it as her older brother, but she was still occasionally working in films as late as 1950.\n\nOn June 15th, the Oakland Tribune reported the following: \"Shubert has also announced on his program for next season \"The Stork Laid An Egg.\" It was tried out by Arthur J. Beckhard in Santa Barbara, but while announced for San Francisco, didn't reach there.\" Dickie is listed among the actors who performed \"down South.\"\n\nOn June 21st, Barney Glazer wrote the following in his syndicated column: \"Dickie Moore's crooked teeth make him 'all boy' in his present pictures but may present a problem in the future. However, Dickie's agents will let the future take care of itself while they arrange for a series of films for their talented starlet. Personally, I'd like nothing better than to see Dickie starred opposite Shirley Temple, if 20th Century-Fox would approve a bit of tough competition. Dickie can accept such casting since he is a freelance actor.\"\n\nOn August 9th, The Southwest Wave of Los Angeles reported the following: \"There's no glory in a stand-in's work - the star of the picture gets all that. But 12-year-old Bobby Willey of 1246 West Fiftieth street doesn't mind that. He thinks it's a lot of fun. Bobby is a stand-in for Dickie Moore. At present he is on location at Malibu lake where Paramount is filming 'Arkansas Traveler.' The young actor has been Dickie's stand-in for about eight months, and combines that work with extra 'bits' in various pictures.\"\n\nOn August 17th, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported that Dickie had landed the role of Tad Lincoln in the upcoming Warners short \"Lincoln In The White House.\"\n\nOn October 13th, The Bergen Evening Record of Hackensack, NJ, reported the following: \"Despite all the youngsters out there, Hollywood is a grown-ups town and a child actor has to be smart in several respects in order to get along with them. This comes from Dickie Moore, under ten but with an acting career well underway. Says Dickie: 'If you want to get along well with adults in the film colony you've got to be firm with them. I've found that out from associating with many picture people, especially Bob Burns, Irvin S. Cobb, and Fay Bainter.'\n\n\"Young Dickie advises other child players to put their foot down when adults attempt conversation in baby talk. 'Don't let them pat your head,' he cautions. 'Of course,' this young man observes, 'if you keep grown-ups in their place they're very nice. For example, Bob Burns is a swell guy once he finds he can't treat you like a baby and get away with it. In order to really get along with the oldsters it's constantly necessary for a young player to remind himself that the adults mean well. You see, it's not really their fault; the kids have spoiled them. The grown-ups are so accustomed to having their way that they collapse with surprise if we offer any sort of objection. Another thing: a child actor's got to be firm with his mother; in a subtle way, of course. You see, like other adults she's inclined to take advantage of her superior size in any sort of difference with me or other kids. That's why it's a good idea to be subtle about those things. After all there's no fun in taking a thumping or being locked in the house after dinner. A kid must always remember he's not big enough to argue. I've been giving some thought recently to the problem of getting kids a better break with adults. Maybe we ought to organize.' \"\n\nOn December 24th, Dickie guested on the Joe E. Brown Show on CBS radio. Instead of the usual comedy, Brown did a specially-written Christmas drama featuring Dickie called The Snow Tree.\n\nLove, Honor And Behave (role: Ted Painter as a child)\n\nMar. 12, 1938 - Warner Bros. - 7 reels - Wayne Morris & Priscilla Lane feature\n\n©Jan. 21, 1938.

Somebody named Dickie Moore played the part of Wally Webb, a character who was about the right age to be played by the subject of this filmography.\n\nOn December 16th, Dickie was among several juvenile stars who attended the fifth annual Christmas benefit show for the Children's Hospital at the Marcal Theater in Hollywood.\n\nLincoln In The White House (role: Tad Lincoln)\n\nFeb. 11, 1939 - Warner Bros. - 2 reels - Technicolor Special\n\nFilmed Nov. 1938. ©Feb. 11, 1939.\n\nLand Of Liberty (archival)\n\nJune 15, 1939 - MPPDA - 14 reels - compilation feature\n\nThis film was simultaneously screened at the World's Fairs in both New York and San Francisco.

De Mille present.\n\nWhile it was common for newspapers to mistakenly credit Dickie with playing little boy roles in various films, nobody would have a better gripe against this than Dickie Jones, who would have routinely found his parts credited to Dickie Moore in newspaper ads and reviews. This includes many instances crediting Dickie Moore as the voice of Pinocchio in the animated feature released in February of this year.\n\nWhile in his early teens, Dickie spent a summer working at a sporting goods store.\n\nOn August 10th, Sheilah Graham reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Dickie Moore, now in 'Dispatch From Reuter's,' has a printing press at home on which he turns out a weekly newspaper for the children in his neighborhood.\"\n\nOn December 11th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Little Dickie Moore - who was just a babe in arms a few years ago, is growing up - and how! Dickie, who is now 15, was sharing a close-up with Eddie Albert for 'Stuff of Heroes' when the cameraman spoke up and said the scene was ruined: 'That peach-fuzz on Dickie's upper lip looks bad,' he said. Pronto they rushed the youngster over to the Warner studio barber shop and gave him his first shave - and now he's the proudest kid on the Warner lot.

Motion picture companies in Hollywood called off all their exterior shooting schedules. Actors and actresses were contented as they worked on comfortable, dry sets - that is, all except Eddie Albert and Dickie Moore. They were working inside also, but working conditions were anything but pleasant. Sitting in an open roadster for three hours while the camera recorded their lines on Warner Bros.' 'The Great Mr. Nobody' set. Albert and Moore were drenched to the skin. It was a process rain shot in a typical eastern storm and, as far as Eddie and Dickie were concerned, it was raining harder inside than it was outside.\"\n\nOn March 29th, Hedda Hopper reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Every time the 'Sergeant York' script says a year has passed, an inch of leather is added to little Dickie Moore's shoes to produce the effect of his growing up. 'If the story had lasted longer,' says Dickie, 'I'd be on stilts.' \"\n\nOn April 27th, The Charlotte Observer reported the following: \"Dickie plunged into the dangerous 'awkward age' and kept right on getting parts. Now the awkward age is safely past and thanks to 'Sergeant York,' so is the 'kid stuff.' At least Dickie thinks so. He's so convinced of it he's considering dropping the 'Dickie' and facing the future as Richard Moore.\"\n\nOn November 16th, John Chapman reported the following in his syndicated column regarding his activities on November 13th: \"To Columbia for a visit with Budd's pa, B. P. Schulberg, and on the set of 'Martin Eden,' where Glenn Ford is rescuing Dickie Moore from the prison hold of a ship. It's raining in sheets, lightning is jumping from huge arcs, and Glenn has to carry Dickie up a ladder. A couple of years ago this would have been easy, for Dickie was a kid star; but now he's a husky hunk almost as big as young Ford, and it's a workout for Glenn.\"\n\nDuring his teens, Dickie was getting fed up with being called \"Dickie.\" As he wrote in his 1984 book, \"Whenever I got a role, I asked Mother and my agent to arrange for the studio to bill me as Dick Moore. The name Dickie was, in my view, childish. Reports came back: No one will hire Dick Moore because they don't know who Dick Moore is.\"\n\nDickie Moore gabardine shorts were still being advertised during this year, but after this, his clothing line seems to have been discontinued.\n\nThe Great Mr. Nobody (role: \"Limpy\" Barnes)\n\nFeb. 15, 1941 - Warner Bros. - 7 reels - Eddie Albert & Joan Leslie feature\n\nFilmed late 1940/early 1941. ©Feb. 15, 1941.

However, not only is the year wrong, it isn't known what kind of award this would have been. It definitely wasn't an Academy Award.\n\n1942\n\nOn March 6th of this year, United Press reported the following: \"Shirley Temple, the yellow-haired toddler with the dimples, underwent her first romantic movie clinch today, kiss included. It was a sad moment for the onlookers at the Edward Small studios. Made 'em feel old and gray and decrepit. Worried Mrs. Temple, too. Even caused sweat to bead the brow of Dickie Moore, the dinner-jacketed youngster who applied the kiss. But it didn't seem to bother Miss Temple at all. When the picture's released in May, she'll be 14, won't she? Grown up, darn near.\"\n\nOn May 10th, The Knoxville News-Sentinel (TN) reported the following: \"When young Dickie Moore broke his leg, Billy Cook was substituted for the boy's role in 'The Major and the Minor.' His first day on the lot Billy came down with the measles.\" A peak at the cast listing for this film at IMDb reveals neither name, not surprisingly.\n\nDickie was going to Fairfax High School during this period, where he performed in a stage version of Tom Sawyer. This would have happened by May 23rd, when The Winona Republican-Herald (MN) mentioned it.\n\nOn June 22nd, Jimmie Fidler wrote the following in his syndicated column: \"Ex-child star Dickie Moore, now doing okay in grown-up roles, is out of the State Guard; they just learned he's only 16!\"\n\nOn December 23rd, John Truesdeil wrote the following in his syndicated column: \"Do you remember big-brown-eyed Dickie Moore, the little fellow who found such fabulous success in Hollywood as a child star? - And maybe you saw him recently in Shirley Temple's last picture. But the breaks seem to be against Dickie, for he's now selling toys in a Los Angeles department store - and those bigwigs sit in their offices collecting thousand dollar ulcers wondering what they'll do now that Jackie Briggs, Jackie Cooper, and Freddie Bartholomew are in the services.

With the man star shortage in Hollywood now Dickie is getting another chance at the big-time. The young teen-agester will play one of the leading roles in a current cinema opus.\"\n\nOn April 10th, The Morning Herald of Uniontown, PA, reported that some of the child actors in Hollywood had formed a Junior Red Cross. Among them were Dickie Moore and members of the current Our Gang troupe. \"Plans include writing letters to the soldiers, making bandages, making gifts for the soldiers, learning first aid, and other useful work.\"\n\nOn May 4th, Sheilah Graham reported that Shirley Temple was \"running around\" with Dickie Moore.\n\nOn June 14th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Do you remember little Dickie Moore, former child star?

He was walking along the beach the other day when little Joyce Lake, niece of Arthur Lake and a little friend went too far out in the ocean and were knocked down by a wave. For a minute it looked pretty serious. Dickie jumped in with all of his clothes and pulled, not only the frightened little Lake girl to safety, but her friend. The little girl's grandmother called to say she thought that such bravery deserved mention. Well, here it is!\"\n\nOn June 17th, John Truesdell reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Dickie Moore, of the big brown eyes Dept., hasn't had a break in Hollywood since he was 8 years old.

Dick reported to Fort MacArthur, CA, and received six weeks of basic training at Camp Sibert, AL. (In her June 1st column, Louella Parsons reported that he was doing KP duty at this location.) Dick was assigned to the 39th Special Service Company, previously formed to entertain the troops. Allen Ludden was their lieutenant.\n\nOn June 18th, The Birmingham News - Age-Herald reported that Pvt. Dickie Moore, along with Bobby Breen, was part of a show called GI Holidays put on by a special service training group. This show had its initial run at Camp Sibert. \"The idea of the Special Service Training Group, under Maj. Thomas L. Cook, is to provide the best entertainment for men overseas. The top men of show business in civilian life have been brought together in uniform at Sibert for special training in the production of shows under combat difficulties. These soldiers are taking regular basic combat training and drill just as much as any man in uniform. But at the same time they have the added equipment of their skills in dancing, music, comedy, and the added training of show production. Stripped of the lavish props of the big theaters and glamor clubs where they played in prewar years, the men have turned their own talent into 'GI Holidays,' which stands easily on its merits of good music, good dialogue and expert performance.\" The photo caption accompanying the article states that one civilian showing was to be given at the Alabama Theater in Birmingham on Wednesday, the 21st.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Press of Apr. 26, 1973, reported the following in regard to Jack Henry: \"There was a time during World War II when Henry suspected himself of having executive talent, or the makings, at least of a personnel director. A sergeant assigned to a Special Services company, he had soldiered in Alabama with such well-known entertainers as Mickey Rooney and Bobby Breen. Their commanding officer, a colonel, disliked Mickey Rooney because he couldn't be handled and disliked Bobby Breen because he sang in falsetto. Accordingly, he appointed Sgt. Henry the task of trading these undesirables to another company, and after conducting negotiations with a captain, Henry was able to report triumphantly that he had unloaded Rooney and Breen. In their place, the captain had offered him Clarence Stroud, a vaudeville comic, and Dickie Moore, an overage child star of the films. Henry's colonel soon discovered that he did not greatly care for the newcomers, either, but he was so pleased to get rid of Mickey Rooney he considered it an excellent trade.\" This, of course, contradicts reports from 1944 of Dick working in the same show with Bobby Breen.\n\nOn June 22nd, The Cullman Democrat (AL) reported the following: \"The Cullman Theater is showing a War Bond Premiere on Wednesday evening, June 28. Admission will be upon special ticket issued on the purchase of War Bonds. Mr. Griffin says that the bond booth at the theater is open each day at noon for the purchase of bonds for the premiere which will have the added attractions of Bibbie(sic) Breen and Dickie Moore, two famous movie stars now in the service.\"\n\nJust as he was about to be sent overseas, it was decided by the upper brass that Dick would return to Hollywood to do retakes on his last film, and then be sent to New York to recruit volunteers for the Women's Army Corps. Dick wasn't happy with this idea and talked them into letting him rejoin his company after the retakes were finished. Instead of going to New York, he wound up in Honolulu with the special service company.\n\nOn June 30th, Harrison Carroll reported the following: \"Pvt. Dickie Moore, now in special service, will get his wish for overseas service.\"\n\nOn July 17th, Louella Parsons reported that Dickie's 10-year-old sister, Pat, had just gotten a part in \"Winged Victory.\"\n\nOn September 22nd, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported the following: \"Pvt. John Richard Moore Jr. is in Honolulu with an army special service company. He is a tall, broad shouldered, good looking lad of 19 with close-cropped brown hair and a slanting smile. If that 'John Richard' has thrown you off the track, think back about 10 years. That's right . . . he is 'Dickie' Moore, one-time movie 'child' star, and he still looks startling like the Dickie Moore you remember. Moore is now far from being a child. At the time of his induction into the Army at Fort MacArthur early this year he had already graduated from the appealing roles that made him famous and was beginning a new career as a juvenile star.\"\n\nProbably beginning in November of this year, Dick was stationed on the island of Saipan. According to the Hedda Hopper column of Mar. 18, 1946, he had been stationed there for 16 months, which is how I arrived at this date (he was discharged in March 1946). Alternately, the Daily News of Los Angeles, reporting on Sep. 13, 1946, stated that he did 21 months on Saipan, which would mean he got there in June of 1944. This latter claim is probably conflating his exit from Camp Sibert with his arrival on Saipan. In his 1984 book, Dick himself stated that he was on Saipan for two years, but this seems to be conflated with his entire time in the service. Perhaps he was just rounding off. He initially continued to perform with the special service company, which included folk musician Pete Seeger in its ranks.\n\nThe Eve Of St. Mark (role: Zip West)\n\nMay 22, 1944 - 20th Century-Fox - 96 min. - feature\n\nFilmed late 1943. ©May 30, 1944.

Presumably, he worked his way up the ranks in the special service company during 1945.\n\nOn May 31st of this year, the Courier-Post of Camden, NJ, reported that Lt. Tyrone Power was putting on a show each Sunday with Cpl. Dickie Moore. So he had been promoted by this time.\n\nOn October 1st, The Herald Statesman of Yonkers, NY, reported that Dickie was one of 50 soldier-entertainers from the Pacific who would soon tour the U.S., giving shows for the Victory Bond drive. The group was set to meet with their leader, Captain Sol Friedman, in San Francisco on October 3rd. After this, they would be taken to Hollywood, and then on to New York, where they were due to arrive on the 17th, and where they would march in the Navy Day parade on the 27th. Also planned was a nationwide broadcast. For the readers in Yonkers, the group were scheduled to perform at a theater in their home town.\n\nOn December 19th, The Daily Missoulian (MT) reported that Technician Fifth Class Dickie Moore, former Hollywood child film star, was currently a correspondent for the Stars and Stripes, an Army newspaper. On the same day, The Galveston Daily News stated that he was covering events on Saipan. According to the Associated Press of November 23, 1946, Dickie had been a correspondent in the Saipan-Tinian, Guam and Iwo Jima campaigns.\n\n1946\n\nDick was discharged from the Army in March of this year. By this time, he had risen to the rank of sergeant. When his time was up, he was sent to Honolulu, but could only be discharged at the point of induction, so he had to go back to Fort MacArthur for this. He then moved back in with his parents.\n\nOn March 18th, Hedda Hopper wrote the following: \"Remember Dickie Moore, who played Shirley Temple's first beau when she returned to the screen? A girl from Honolulu writes that he has been in Saipan for the past 16 months but passed through Honolulu on the way home.\"\n\nIn July, Dick contracted a viral infection that left his legs paralyzed. Doctors said he might be unable to walk for the rest of his life. He entered the West Los Angeles Veterans Facility for daily physical therapy. According to James Robert Parrish in his book Great Child Stars, Dick worked briefly for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, but this has turned out to be not-quite-true. He collapsed from his paralysis the day he was due to start his new job, and never wound up working there.\n\nOn July 21st, Hedda Hopper wrote the following: \"Dickie Moore, now 20, is very ill at the Sawtelle hospital with a rare ailment that has paralyzed both legs and part of his face.\"\n\nOn August 13th, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"One of the first things undertaken by Marlene Dietrich after her arrival was a visit to the Veterans Hospital at Sawtelle. In one of the wards there she recognized Dickie Moore, who, some years ago, played her son in 'Blonde Venus.' He was in the Saipan campaign during the war. They had quite a reunion.\"\n\nOn August 27th, Dorothy Manners wrote the following in her syndicated column: \"Everyone expressed sympathy over former child star, Dickie Moore, being under treatment for paralysis at the Sawtelle Military hospital. But Barbara Stanwyck did more than that. When she heard the boy, who had played her son in 'So Big' years ago, was ill and lonely, she went to see him immediately.\"\n\nOn September 7th, Hedda Hopper wrote the following: \"Barbara Stanwyck went calling on Dickie Moore in the hospital and came away with a story about him which she sold to Screen Guide. She told the editors Dickie had a flair for writing; so he's been assigned to do three stories, which will make his hospital stay a bit more cheerful.\"\n\nOn September 13th, the Daily News of Los Angeles, writing about Dick's recovery, reported the following: \"Doctors diagnosed the case as infectious neuronitis, a rare ailment of the nervous system. It would be six months at least before he could leave a wheelchair, they said, even to hobble about on crutches. Today those same doctors admit they are amazed at the progress and toughness of the man whose appealing little-boy roles won the hearts of moviegoers more than a decade ago. After only two months of treatment at the West Los Angeles Veterans Hospital, Dickie is walking without help of any kind. He took his first faltering steps in six weeks, and doctors predict he'll be able to leave the hospital - under his own power - in a week or so. His miraculous recovery they attribute to a combination of modern physical therapy and the patient's rugged constitution. Dickie's daily regimen included water and air massage in a therapy tank, sunlamp treatment, rowing machine sessions and walking practice.\"\n\nOn September 14th, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Dickie Moore...stretched his legs at the Veterans Administration General Hospital, Sawtelle, and talked confidently of the future. Discharged last March after two years in the Army, Dick (he's allergic to Dickie, now) served as a Stars and Stripes correspondent in the Pacific and writing has captured his fancy. 'Barbara Stanwyck was up here to see me,' he said. 'She's swell. We talked a lot and she was interested enough in my idea of writing to get me an assignment to do three magazine stories.' Dick, who resides at 337 N. Mansfield Ave. with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. John R. Moore, contracted a virus disease affecting his nervous system two months after leaving the Army as a sergeant. Doctors at the hospital figured he had picked it up in the Marianas. The young actor's legs became useless. He reconciled himself to a wheel chair for life. But daily physical therapy treatments slowly brought back his nerves, his muscles...and he walked again. 'Yesterday was my birthday,' smiled the kid with the wide-open brown eyes. 'Twenty-one. And the first legal paper I signed myself was authority for a sixth spinal tap! Ugh!' \"\n\nOn October 22nd, the Valley Times of North Hollywood reported the following: \"Nice to learn that Dickie Moore has received his discharge from the Veterans hospital at Sawtelle and will appear in 'Build My Gallows High' for RKO.\" This was the film that was eventually released as \"Out Of The Past.\"\n\nOn October 31st, the Valley Times of North Hollywood reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, former child star and recently discharged from the Army, draws an unusual assignment as Bob Mitchum's pal in RKO's 'Build My Gallows High.' In the film Dickie will not speak a line of dialogue, since he portrays a deaf mute. At present, he is studying six hours a day for three weeks to learn the sign language required for the picture.\"\n\nOn November 7th, the Valley Times of North Hollywood reported the following about Dick: \"The ex-GI has four publishers bidding for his book, 'Snow in Saipan,' and also has RKO interested in still another work, an original screenplay.\" On December 1st, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the book as being about Dick's Army experiences in the Pacific.\n\nOn November 23rd, the Associated Press reported that Dick was planning to attend L.A. City College to make up credits for UCLA, with the goal of becoming a journalist.\n\nOn December 6th, Dick took part in the Sixth Annual All Western Band Review parade in Long Beach, CA.\n\nBy this time, Dickie preferred to be called \"Dick,\" and was trying to establish it as his professional nickname, though it took a few years before it really took hold.\n\n1947\n\nOn January 3rd of this year, City News Service reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, now 21 and a veteran of three years service in the Pacific, will return to school as soon as he completes his role in 'Out Of The Past.' Moore, who was a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, will major in journalism at Los Angeles City College.\" Dick was able to attend college on the G.I. Bill.\n\nA caption on the back of a publicity photo from this year reads: \"Former child-star Dickie Moore is one thankful boy.....After a year's confinement in an army hospital with paralysis of the legs contracted in the South Pacific, he's fully recovered. Enjoying normal life again, here's Dickie with actress Virginia Huston, a co-worker in RKO Radio's 'Out Of The Past', trying his best at fishing while on location.\"\n\nOn July 8th, Hedda Hopper, writing in her syndicated column, reported the Dickie would be appearing in the upcoming \"Dangerous Years.\"\n\nOn July 20th, Edith Gwynn wrote the following in her syndicated column: \"Dickie Moore gets his first movie role since recovering from the malaria he contracted in the Army, in 'Dangerous Years.' Dickie has been going to school under the G.I. Bill of Rights since he last faced the cameras.\" Of course, this isn't particularly accurate, since it wasn't malaria that sidelined Dick, and he made \"Out Of The Past\" in the interim.\n\nOn August 2nd, the United Press reported the following: \"Five young movie veterans - who've made 421 movies and $1,750,000 between 'em - hunched together over strawberry shortcake today and let the picture business have it straight. These 'teen-agers think 90 per cent of the epics turned out nowadays are 'just plain lousy.' The kids oughta know. They've been making movies since the days when a nurse used to feed 'em pablum on the set between takes. They've seen many a movie queen come and go - but they're still around - from Our Gang comedies to juvenile parts. Altogether , they've cleaned up an average of $350,000 each during their careers. Movie-making is the only life they know. But, as far as they're concerned, the 'good old days' were better. The old-timers were Scotty Beckett, 17, Ann E. Todd, 15, Darryl Hickman, 17, Harry Shannon, 17, and Dickie Moore, the only one who shaves every day. He's 22. To a man (with apologies to Miss Todd, who's growing up to be a beauty) they blasted the current crop of movies as 'grade A stinkers.' Even cited names and titles and box-office receipts...Bad stories and rapid-fire shooting is Dickie Moore's gripe. When he broke into the movies as a babe-in-arms...the boys took a little time on their 'colossal productions.' 'Now it's zip, zip, zip - and you got a movie,' Dickie says.\"\n\nOn November 2nd, Dick left Hollywood for Tarpon Springs, FL, to film \"16 Fathoms Deep,\" arriving there on November 3rd.\n\nOn November 6th, Dick took part in Stunt Night, a presentation in Tarpon Springs, FL, put on by the cast and crew of \"16 Fathoms Deep.\"\n\nOn November 7th, Dick took part in the Parade Of Stars, also put on by the cast of \"16 Fathoms Deep,\" this time at Bay Pines Center.\n\nAn article from Jan. 9, 1955, states that Dick had studied at the Actor's Lab in Los Angeles. This would presumably be during the late 1940s before his move to New York.\n\nOut Of The Past (role: The Kid)\n\nprem.
