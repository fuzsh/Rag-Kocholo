        "text": "Freaky Friday enthusiasts gather ‘round because the sequel we have all been waiting for is closer than ever before. Yes, the second installment — officially titled Freakier Friday — is in the works, and we are collating every single update on the project so you don’t miss a detail.\n\nBased on Mary Rodgers's 1972 novel of the same name, Disney's 2003 adaptation of Freaky Friday, the third version of the project, became a box hit office internationally and a cornerstone in naughties pop culture. Now, 21 years after we first saw Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis as the onscreen mother-daughter duo Anna and Tess Coleman, Disney has given Freakier Friday the green light and added new faces to continue the story.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWho will get to swap places in the long-anticipated sequel? Well, we already have a few hints. Keep reading to find out everything you need to know about Freakier Friday, including updates on filming, cast, director, and plot, or jump to your preferred section using the arrows below.\n\n→ Confirmation\n\n→ Filming updates\n\n→ Cast\n\n→ Set photos\n\n→ Director\n\n→ Plot details and new characters\n\n→ Release date\n\n→ Trailer\n\nIs Freaky Friday 2 confirmed?\n\nYes! Rumors around a potential Freaky Friday sequel first spread after Jaimie Lee Curtis teased that she had proposed the project to Disney in October 2022 during an appearance on The View. “I've already written to Disney,” Curtis said during the interview. \"I'm 64 years old… so my point is I'm wide open, creatively I am wide open… Bring it!\"\n\nAfter contacting Disney, Curtis also contacted Lindsay Lohan, who confirmed she was also on board for round two a month later. “I had to bring myself down to Earth and be like, ‘OK, I’m on set. I have to focus.’ And then she said Freaky Friday 2, and I got more excited,” Lohan said during an appearance on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nWith both stars seemingly on board, in May 2023, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed the sequel was officially a go at Disney. Lohan reconfirmed the project was still a go during her interview on SiriusXM’s Andy Cohen Live in March 2024, where she confirmed the sequel is indeed happening. Later the same month, Curtis posted a photo of her and Lohan's 2023 reunion to her Instagram, tagging Disney. “DUH! FFDEUX!” she captioned the snap. According to Variety, Andrew Gunn, who produced the first film, will also be co-producing the sequel. As confirmed by Disney in a press release from June 2024, he will be joined by Kristin Burr and Jamie Lee Curtis, with Nathan Kelly, Ann Marie Sanderlin, and Lindsay Lohan also serving as executive producers.\n\nHas Freaky Friday 2 started filming yet?\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nYes! Freaky Friday 2 officially entered production on June 24, 2024, as announced by Disney. Production on the sequel began in Los Angeles, where Lohan and Curtis posed for photographers in their trailers.\n\nNews of the sequel starting production is a long time coming. In an interview with People from March 2024, Lohan revealed the movie was “in the process” but refused to clarify when filming would start or if the final script had been completed yet. Instead, she affirmed she was “just excited to work with Jamie again and see how much further we can take it.” Deadline, however, reported that filming was expected to take place in the summer of 2024 in Los Angeles, and, well, right on the dot since summer officially started on June 21, three days before the sequel entered production.\n\nWho is in the cast of Freaky Friday 2?\n\nBoth Lindsay Lohan and Jaimie Lee Curtis are expected to reprise their roles as Tess and Anna Coleman, respectively, in Freaky Friday 2. Disney has also confirmed Mark Harmon and Chad Michael Murray will reprise their roles as Ryan Volvo and Jake.\n\nThey are not the only original cast members who will be returning: Christina Vidal Mitchell (Maddie), Haley Hudson (Peg), Lucille Soong (Pei-Pei's mom), Stephen Tobolowsky (Mr. Bates), and Rosalind Chao (Pei-Pei) are also all set to reprise their roles in the sequel.\n\nAs far as new characters go — more on that below — actors Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Manny Jacinto, and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan will be joining the franchise.\n\nAre there any photos from the Freaky Friday 2 set?\n\nThere are indeed. Aside from the picture of Lohan and Curtis posing on set (which you can see above), Disney also released a picture of Chad Michael Murray in character as Jake, and we are pleased to announce that he still has a motorcycle.\n\nOn March 29, 2024, The Hollywood Reporter broke the news that Nisha Ganatra had been officially tapped as the director for Freaky Friday 2. The Canadian writer and director is best known for 2019's Late Night, starring Mindy Kaling and Emma Thompson. For TV, she's also worked on Welcome to Chippendales, And Just Like That..., and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, among others. The first film was directed by Mark Waters, who later also worked with Lohan on Mean Girls.\n\nWhat will Freaky Friday 2 be about?\n\nDetails about the plot of the Freaky Friday sequel are being kept under wraps, but a handful of details have slipped through the cracks. Previously, it had been reported that the project had an early draft by Elyse Hollander, but THR noted the film has a new script by Jordan Weiss that is “said to bring a multigenerational approach to the story,” which Disney has now confirmed.\n\nJudging by a handful of audition sides obtained by Entertainment Weekly and an open casting call posted by Ganatra on Instagram, Freaky Friday 2 appears to feature a double swap with Lohan's Anna and Curtis's Tess swapping bodies once again, this time with two teenage girls.\n\n“It’s more fun, it’s more emotional, and it’s all for you guys,” Lohan told fans at Disney's D23 on August 9, after revealing the sequel's title. “Seriously, the only reason we are back here doing this because of your love. That is why.”\n\n“A sequel to the beloved 2003 film with a multigenerational twist, the film picks up years after Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) endured an identity crisis. Anna now has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate the myriad challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might indeed strike twice,” the official logline for the series shared by Disney confirms.\n\nGanatra's open casting call already teased one of the teenagers would be Anna's 14-year-old daughter, Harper Coleman, while the other one is her soon-to-be step-sister, Lily Davies, who's also 14. The casting call described Harper as “a teen surfer with California vibes with a sharp sense of humor [who's] in a bit of a mood these days because her longtime single mom is set to marry British restaurateur Eric Davies.”\n\nEric's daughter Lily is described as “sharp-tongued” and, well, let's just say they don't really vibe. “Harper and Lily do not see eye to eye. Harper would like to see things go her way and use her intelligence to stop this marriage from ever happening.” Mmm, this is sounding a little bit too familiar.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, Harper will swap with her mother Anna — which makes sense as an homage to the original story since she's, you know, her mother — while Lily will swap with Tess. Now, things get a bit more complicated here since we assume they don't even know each other, given that they have no connection at all yet.\n\nAs far as the plot is concerned, EW notes that Lohan's Anna plans on moving to London with her soon-to-be-husband, which Tess is apprehensive about, so maybe the swap with Lily will make her appreciate British culture? We shall see! However, it's worth noting these details come from audition slides, which could end up not being part of the final script."
