        "text": "This needs a stretch. (Feel free to remove when satisfied of completion.)\n\nNeeded: Synopsis.\n\nLightning Strikes Twice is the sixth episode of the first season of Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\n\nPremise[]\n\nAfter a bad experience from the past with lightning, Dr. Phibes creates a machine from his space station that causes thunderstorms across the world. Uncle Albert informs Shaggy and Scooby to face this rather than hide in the basement. Now Scooby must face his fear of lightning, as he and Shaggy work on a way to stop Phibes.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nInsert details here.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain characters:\n\nScooby-Doo\n\nShaggy Rogers\n\nSupporting characters:\n\nRobi\n\nDr. Albert Shaggleford (hologram)\n\nVillains:\n\nDr. Phineus Phibes (main story and flashback)\n\nAgent 1\n\nAgent 2\n\nAgent 3\n\nAgent 4\n\nAgent 7\n\nAgent 10 (no lines)\n\nAgent 11 (no lines)\n\nAgent 12 (no lines)\n\nAgent 13 (no lines)\n\nDr. Trebla\n\nOther characters:\n\nSanta Claus (mentioned)\n\nLocations[]\n\nPhibes's space station\n\nPhibes's office\n\nShaggleford Manor\n\nBackyard\n\nObjects[]\n\nIon bombardment device\n\nScooby Snack\n\nVehicles[]\n\nMystery Machine\n\nCast[]\n\nFrank Welker Scooby-Doo\n\nAgent 3 Scott Menville Shaggy Rogers\n\nDr. Trebla\n\nAgent 4 Jeff Bennett Dr. Phineus Phibes\n\nAgent 2 Jim Meskimen Robi\n\nAgent 1\n\nAgent 7 Casey Kasem Dr. Albert Shaggleford\n\nNotes/trivia[]\n\nWhile Scooby-Doo is generally not as cowardly in this series as he was in past incarnations, he is still afraid of lightning.\n\nAgents 2, 3, and 7 are a part of a UFO club. Agent 2 is called \"Blothar\" and Agent 7 is called \"Bernie\" (which sounds more like it might be his real name).\n\nThey played less villainous roles in this episode (especially Agent 2), but only because they were duped into helping the heroes due to their high gullibleness.\n\nMiscellaneous[]\n\nSuper Scooby Snack: Super speed.\n\nMystery Machine transformation: Space shuttle.\n\nAnimation mistakes and/or technical glitches[]\n\nNone known.\n\nInconsistencies/continuity errors and/or goofs/oddities[]\n\nPhibes seemingly has an alien on his team to begin with, so his fear and the need for the UFO club to seek out the \"aliens\" (as if it's a momentous occasion) are redundant.\n\nIn other languages[]\n\nLanguage Name Meaning French La foudre frappe toujours deux fois Lightning Always Strikes Twice Greek Η Αστραπή Χτυπάει Δυο Φορές Τhe Lightning Strikes Twice Spanish (Latin America) Efectos Insospechados Unsuspected Effects\n\nHome media[]\n\nShaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!: Volume 2 DVD released by Warner Home Video on July 8, 2008.\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You!: Volume 4 - Spooked Bayou DVD released by Warner Home Video on October 19, 2010.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n[]\n\nTBA"
