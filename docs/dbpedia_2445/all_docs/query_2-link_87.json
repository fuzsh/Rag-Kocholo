        "text": "I've just watched the documentary on BBCi and I thought it was nicely done. I can't help thinking that the reason it's coming across badly is down to the lack of voiceover/narrative which would normally explain the film-makers intentions and give it more of a human touch.\n\nSaying that I liked the fact that it had no voiceover and for some reason I still believe that the film-maker simply wanted to tell a story. I didn't feel it was\"sneering\" or \"mean spirited\" at all and I'm really confused as to how it's been interperated by the majority of viewers/reviewers.\n\nI don't think it was the lack of voice over at all. It deliberately selected elderly eccentrics yet when I watched the BBC Look East report on the programme, it interviewed the local butcher who was very angry but perfectly normal and middle aged, and the local vicar who runs a vibrant youth group who said the programme makers had completely ignored the youth in the area and just focussed on giving the impression Frinton was a town of old people, in other words fulfilling the stereotype.\n\nAs examples of the reason why I think it was sneering and mean spirited:\n\nWhy keep going back to that lady who was waiting for her sister at the crossroads? Why keep showing her repeating the fact the town had a doctors surgery across the road? To make her look stupid, that's why.\n\nWhy keep pressing the gay man on what his \"dark secret\" was that he didn't want to reveal? It made him look shifty and nasty especially in the context of the other comments he made about the local social life.\n\nWhy keep focussing on the level crossing issue and some of the older residents on electric buggies? It's one thing and I can tell you it's not unique to Frinton, there is usually a lot of opposition to the removal of manned level-crossings because barrier crossings are percieved as unsafe which is apparently the main reason for the opposition in Frinton, not the implication that they want to keep the gates as a barrier to progress which was the implied reason given by the programme. The fact that they objected to the pub in the past is also not unique to Frinton.\n\nThose are just three examples. The whole programme was deliberately over emphasising and taking completely out of context certain issues which helped to confirm the preconceived notion that Frinton is populated by dotty old farts and on a par with Royston Vasey. I'm sure I could pick out several things here in Fairbourne that would make the village look like a badly run asylum, yet if I were to put across other points I could portray the village as a model community full of generous people. I appreciate the point of the documentary was to portray a viewpoint but if that viewpoint is a stereotype or deliberately skewed to poke fun at the people concerned then the film maker has to expect the vitriol that has rightly come down on this clown.\n\nAs for Louis Theroux and Kieth Allen, people in this country know what their film making is about and expect it to be a freak show. This wasn't portrayed as that kind of programme, plus I don't actually think Theroux sets out to make fun of the individuals, he actually lets the individuals show themselves up and he tends to focus on those who think they are something special anyway, whereas Isaacs didn't, he went for people who were ordinary, not used to tv or press and not the same kind of self-seeking subjects that Theroux focusses on. After all, setting up Neil and Christine Hamilton is a world away from making a confused elderly lady waiting for a sister that apparently didn't turn up look silly.\n\n0"
