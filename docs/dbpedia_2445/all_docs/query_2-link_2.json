These figures are usually updated once a month and are for Local Authority Districts and Unitary Authority Districts. So below are the figures of Tendring.\n\nAreaUnemployedYearly ChangeTendring4.1%-0.8%East of England3%-0.3%England3.8%-0.3%UK3.7%-0.3%\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics (ONS), Last Retrieved: March 2023\n\nThe 2021 census had data on people who were economically active (seeking work) yet unemployed on Census day (Sunday March 21st 2021).
