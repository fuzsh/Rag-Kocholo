Plenty is going on in Clacton-on-Sea to keep everyone occupied and even better there are easy transport links via multiple means.\n\nTrustedCare.co.uk has an extensive online directory of care services in Clacton-on-Sea which you can browse below. Each home profile contains comprehensive information about the home inclusive of a gallery of images, service-user reviews and specialisms. The aim is for this information to give you an idea as to whether the home would be suitable for your loved one. We also have an expert team of Care Advisers who are available 7 days a week to offer you guidance and support. They will help you with shortlisting care homes in Clacton-on-Sea and can organise for you to visit the home’s on your behalf.\n\nIt is important that you understand the difference between a care home and a nursing home which will help you assess which kind of home you need to be looking for on behalf of your loved one. A nursing home has Registered Nurses and carers on duty to support residents 24 hours a day whilst a residential care home only has Carers on hand at all times. Exploring the profiles below will allow you to create a shortlist of services that cover the types of care you are looking for e.g. dementia care or respite care. Most of the profiles below will also indicate a weekly care home fee. On average, the weekly cost of a care home in Clacton-on-Sea is £1,051 but the figure will vary from home to home so it is always worth contacting services to enquire further into their costs and what is included in the fee.\n\nIf you require a helping hand with finding residential care homes in Clacton-on-Sea, please contact us via phone, email or live chat. We will happily help to get the ball rolling with your search for care."
