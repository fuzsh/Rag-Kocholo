They're ready to hire as soon as they find the right person. Don't miss your opportunity, apply now!\n\nJob description\n\nDo you want to support a young person in the care system?\n\nWould you like to help build a positive relationship, providing holistic support, and potentially advocating for them?\n\nDo you drive and are you 21 or older?\n\nIf so then Bolton Lads and Girls Club want to hear from you! As a Befriender, your role is to provide a young person in the care system an organised friendship with boundaries. Ensuring that they feel heard, and that they have a constant in their life. You can take the young person out for activities to build their trust and ultimately ensure that they have support from someone separate of both the local authority and the care system, an Independent Visitor. Typically the minimum length of time we would expect a volunteer to be in the role is 18 months, however the nature of the role means it could vary. Meetups are normally every 2 to 3 weeks, at a time that is convenient for both people.\n\nWhilst no experience is required as training is provided, previous experience with children/young people can be advantageous.\n\nThere is a budget available for activities, and mileage expenses are covered.\n\nPosted by\n\nBolton Lads and Girls Club View profile Size: 101 - 500"
