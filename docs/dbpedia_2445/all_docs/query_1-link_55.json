        "text": "PropertyHeads recognizes the importance of privacy for users of PropertyHeads. As referred to in our privacy policy, we use cookies and related technologies, such as beacons, pixels, tags and local storage, to provide you with the services accessible through our website and our apps (together, “PropertyHeads” or our “Services”). We use these technologies to provide, protect and improve PropertyHeads, as well as to understand and measure how you use and interact with it.\n\nThis policy explains how we use cookies and related technology on PropertyHeads. By accessing or using PropertyHeads, you consent to our use of these technologies as described in this policy. Please do not use PropertyHeads if you are not comfortable with the ways in which we use cookies and related technologies.\n\nWhat Is a Cookie?\n\nA cookie is a small file containing a unique identifier that is placed in the web browser of your computer or mobile device. Cookies and related technologies, such as tracking pixels, enable our systems to recognize your device and report information back to us. Such recognition helps the efficient operation of PropertyHeads, including our website and apps.\n\nDoes PropertyHeads Use Cookies?\n\nYes, like most websites and social networks, we use cookies in the course of providing you with our Services.\n\nWhat Cookies Does PropertyHeads Use, and Why?\n\nWe use both session cookies and persistent cookies.\n\nWe use a session cookie to identify you during a particular visit to PropertyHeads. Session cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser or app after using PropertyHeads.\n\nWe use a persistent cookie to identify you over a long period of time. (For example, if you asked us to keep you signed in, we would use a persistent cookie for that purpose.) Persistent cookies remain on your device for the set period of time specified in the cookie.\n\nWe use cookies to operate and improve PropertyHeads, specifically:\n\nTo authenticate you and secure our Services: We use cookies to monitor login, session and status data. This allows us to know, for example, whether you are logged in.\n\nTo remember your settings and preferences: We use cookies to recognize your browser and remember your preferences. For example, we may use cookies to remember your language preferences.\n\nTo carry out analytics and research: We use cookies to understand your use of PropertyHeads and how we can improve our offerings. For example, we use cookies to track whether you open emails we send you.\n\nThird-Party Cookies:\n\nFacebook: If you register or sign in using Facebook, a Facebook cookie is set to help track your log-in.\n\nGoogle Analytics: We use Google Analytics, including Google Analytics cookies, to collect anonymous traffic data to help us analyze how members and visitors access and use PropertyHeads, and for other Analytics services relating to website activity and internet usage.\n\nThird-Party Cookies From Content Shared By Members: PropertyHeads members may share content on PropertyHeads that originates from a third-party website or service, and that third-party website or service may set its own cookies when you interact with that content. For example, if a member posts a video from YouTube on PropertyHeads, YouTube may set a cookie when you click to watch the video.\n\nWhat Other Related Technologies Does PropertyHeads Use, and Why?\n\nTracking Pixels: Our advertising partners may use tracking pixels or similar technology to measure the success of the sponsored posts or other advertising products they use. A “tracking pixel” (also sometimes called web beacon, or clear GIF) is a tiny piece of code, invisible to the user, placed on a webpage or in an email and used in combination with a cookie, to link a given activity or impression back to the user; the advertiser includes it in its content so it can measure whether our members interact with that content (for example, by clicking to view an offer). We may set our own tracking pixel on an advertiser’s website so we can measure whether our members found the advertiser’s content effective or interesting, by tracking whether the sponsored post prompted members to take advantage of the advertised offer. This information helps us assess whether sponsored posts and other advertising offers are relevant and interesting to our members and successful for the advertiser."
