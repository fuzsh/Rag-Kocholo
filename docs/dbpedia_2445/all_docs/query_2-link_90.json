        "text": "Seven beaches across Essex have been recognised for being among England's best and most clean after receiving prestigious Blue Flag awards. England now has over 70 Blue Flag beaches which meet a strict set of environmental standards.\n\nBeaches along the Essex Sunshine Coast were awarded the prestigious Blue Flag for 2024, including Frinton, Brightlingsea and Dovercourt Bay. East Beach, Shoebury Common, Three Shells and Westcliff Bay were also given the accolade too. It means all seven beaches have excellent bathing water quality according to the international standards.\n\nSeaside Awards have also been given to all eight beaches in Southend-on-Sea City Council's area - including Chalkwell, Jubilee, Thorpe Bay, East Beach, Bell Wharf and Westcliff Bay - as well as to Harwich, Walton-on-the-Naze’s Albion and Naze beaches, and Martello Bay in Clacton.\n\nALSO READ: 'I tried the new Turkish restaurant that used to be a car dealership - it made you feel like a celebrity'\n\nREAD MORE: Inside the bright blue Essex home with a huge secret garden\n\nCouncillor Mark Stephenson, Leader of TDC, said the awards recognised the beauty and quality of Tendring’s beaches. He said: \"I’m delighted that our Essex Sunshine Coast has again been recognised for its beautiful beaches. We are proud of our coastline - it is a fabulous place for residents and visitors alike.\n\n\"Blue Flags and Seaside Awards show people that our beaches are some of the best in the country and, in line with Our Vision, help us to promote our heritage and environment, attracting visitors and encouraging them to stay longer. It is not easy to keep the Blue Flag status, and for reasons outside of our control we were not able to enter Walton’s Albion beach this year, but will look to do so next year should conditions allow.\"\n\nCllr Meg Davidson, cabinet member for environment at Southend Council, added: \"I am pleased that our beaches have won these prestigious awards because it means residents and visitors to a beach flying a Blue Flag or Seaside Award can be assured the beach will be clean, safe and meet strict environmental standards. This announcement also confirms that all eight of our beaches have excellent or good levels of bathing water quality according to the strict international standards set.\n\n\"Despite these awards, we remain vigilant and continue to work with, and support the work that Anglian Water are doing on their bathing water quality investigations.\"\n\nAllison Ogden-Newton OBE, Keep Britain Tidy's Chief Executive, said: \"Visitors to a beach flying a Blue Flag can be assured the beach will be clean, safe and meet the highest environmental standards, as well as international bathing water quality standards. The Blue Flag is the world’s most recognised award for beaches and marinas and, to qualify, each applicant must meet and maintain a series of stringent environmental, educational, safety and accessibility criteria. Seaside Awards are presented to the best beaches in England and celebrate the quality and diversity of our coastline.\"\n\nFull list of Blue Flag Award and Seaside Award beaches in Essex:\n\nBell Wharf (Seaside Award)\n\nBrightlingsea (Blue Flag)\n\nChalkwell (Seaside Award)\n\nDovercourt Bay (Blue Flag)\n\nEast Beach, Shoeburyness (Blue Flag + Seaside Award)\n\nFrinton (Blue Flag)\n\nHarwich (Seaside Award)\n\nJubilee (Seaside Award)\n\nMartello Bay (Seaside Award)\n\nShoebury Common (Blue Flag + Seaside Award)\n\nThorpe Bay (Seaside Award)\n\nThree Shells (Blue Flag + Seaside Award)\n\nWalton-on-the-Naze Albion and Naze beaches (Seaside Award)\n\nWestcliff Bay (Blue Flag + Seaside Award)"
