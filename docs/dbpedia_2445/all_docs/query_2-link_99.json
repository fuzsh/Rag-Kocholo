You can also get cash from other ATMs – just check if they charge for withdrawals as some third party ATM’s charge fees.\n\nMoney can be withdrawn over the counter in any of our branches Monday to Friday. Check these guidelines to see how much notice you need to give and what documents to bring.\n\nA mobile branch is a bank which comes to you and allows you to do all your usual everyday banking, like making deposits, withdrawing cash and paying bills.\n\nThey visit specific locations for up to 5 days a week throughout the year (except Christmas Day and Bank Holidays)\n\nIf you have a disability, are elderly or find it difficult to use our services, talk with our team and they’ll be happy to make reasonable adjustments to suit your needs and demonstrate how we can help."
