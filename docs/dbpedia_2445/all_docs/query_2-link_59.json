Location to the beach and shops / restaurants perfect We had a fantastic week away despite the weather\n\nReviewed by Michele5.0★Jun 2024\n\n\"We throughly enjoyed our stay.\"\n\nIt was an ideal setting being close to the beach and high street. The welcome hamper was full of delicious thoughtfully chosen items. The facilities were excellent with very comfortable beds. The owners were friendly and helpful. We would love to return.\n\nReviewed by Christine5.0★Jun 2024\n\n\"Lovely, well equipped house in a great location.\"\n\nWe had a nice holiday in the area despite somewhat unseasonable weather.\n\nReviewed by Megan5.0★May 2024\n\n\"We had a lovely stay and the house is comfortable and spacious.\"\n\nThe gardens are also well maintained and a pleasure to use. It is a house I would very happily return to.\n\nReviewed by Anne5.0★May 2024\n\n\"We had a lovely break.\"\n\nThe house was very comfortable and well equipped and ideally situated for both the beach and the shops. The owners had made it very welcoming by leaving on lights and a basket of goodies and items in the fridge that had been very thoughtfully chosen which meant that we could have a cuppa while we settled in without having to worry about rushing to the shops. Thank you for making it a thoroughly good experience.\n\nReviewed by Carole4.7★Apr 2024\n\n\"Absolutely beautiful house in a beautiful location.\"\n\nThe extra little touches make all the difference and the owners had certainly thought of everything. The welcome hamper was very thoughtful. We were a group of 8, two families with young children, and the house was perfect! Glynis was lovely to deal with and called a couple of days before to explain things. We would definitely recommend and will hopefully be going back.\n\nReviewed by Vicki5.0★Apr 2024\n\n\"We had a fabulous time.\"\n\nThe house is so beautiful and full of character. We loved it. We loved Frinton on sea too. It was lovely and quiet and the beach is gorgeous. Sometimes we had it all to ourselves! We will definitely want to visit again!\n\nReviewed by Sara5.0★Mar 2024\n\n\"The house was perfect for us with lots of facilities and all the things you need to have a unworried holiday - lots of crockery, glasses, cutlery, towels, good instructions and a fantastic welcome pack.\"\n\nThe house is so near the beach and the shops. The owners were so approachable and helpful before and during the holiday making any little problems go away.\n\nReviewed by Vic5.0★Oct 2023\n\n\"This was a repeat stay at the house which now feels like a home from home.\"\n\nThe house is large and very well equipped; it is clear that a lot of thought has been given to what visitors will find useful. It is always spotlessly clean and the welcome basket is generous with quality products. The owners are very helpful and friendly if you need assistance with anything. The shops in Connaught Avenue, which include a Sainsbury’s and a Co-op, are a short walk away as is the sandy beach. We would not hesitate to recommend the yellow house for a relaxing holiday or break. It is particularly good for walkers and families with children.\n\nReviewed by Melanie5.0★Sep 2023\n\n\"We loved The Yellow House - it’s stylish and grand but also really comfortable and a very relaxing place to be.\"\n\nVery comfortable beds, well equipped, tonnes of space, beautiful enclosed garden and lots of thoughtful details (eg generous welcome hamper, beach towels, buckets & spades). The beautiful beach is just at the end of the road, and Frinton’s charming high street, which has everything you need, is a short stroll away. We highly recommend and would love to return.\n\nReviewed by Martha5.0★Aug 2023\n\n\"This is a beautiful old house with lots of original features with a sheltered, private, enclosed rear garden.\"\n\nLovely beach barely 10 minutes walk away and best welcome pack yet!\n\nReviewed by Maria4.7★Aug 2023\n\n\"This is a gem.\"\n\nA truly comfortable and welcoming feel, helpful caretakers, a beautiful garden with comfortable swing seats patio table and our favourite was the sofa on the sheltered verandah .. We enjoyed the beautiful beach so much ... 10 mins walk to golden sand and easy access beach. Fantastic for all our needs!\n\nReviewed by Pauline5.0★Aug 2023\n\n\"This is a lovely big house with lots of charm.\"\n\nThe garden is fantastic. The children had lots of place to play completely secure. The hosts were perfect available if needed and provided the best welcome hamper I have ever been given. Would definitely recommend.\n\nReviewed by Peter5.0★May 2023\n\n\"What a wonderful experience we had staying at the Yellow house in frinton, the house was amazing and the owners made our stay unforgettable with fantastic gestures like the welcome hamper and much more.\"\n\nI'd definitely stay again .\n\nReviewed by Amanda5.0★Dec 2022\n\n\"Property is outstanding, beautiful well-kept vintage building.\"\n\nPaul is great to deal with! 5 star all the way!\n\nReviewed by Ronald5.0★Oct 2022\n\n\"This was our second visit to the house.\"\n\nLike last time we had a lovely holiday in this very comfortable relaxing home. It’s in a great location - close to the beach and the shops in Connaught Avenue. We arrived to find a generous welcome basket of food as well as items in the fridge. The house was spotless and the beds are very comfortable. This property provides everything you need for a relaxing stay and we would have no hesitation in recommending it.\n\nReviewed by Melanie5.0★Sep 2022\n\n\"It's a magical house and made for a real special family stay.\"\n\nThe personal touches and arrival treats were such a lovely gesture and added to the overall experience we had there. Thank you again.\n\nReviewed by Rebecca5.0★Sep 2022\n\n\"Characterful property in wonderful quiet location.\"\n\nSpacious, well equipped . Comfy beds ! Good quality linen amd towels .\n\nReviewed by Margaret5.0★Aug 2022\n\n\"Lovely house with great facilities.\"\n\nIdeally located. Wonderful welcome pack. Great attention to detail.\n\nReviewed by Karen5.0★Aug 2022\n\n\"We had a wonderful stay.\"\n\nThe property location was excellent and it was very comfortable. Things we loved were the outdoor shower for sandy feet, plenty of seating in the garden and the amazing welcome hamper. We could, perhaps, have benefitted from more teaspoons and mugs (we are big tea drinkers!), and more clarity on the recycling bins and what goes out when. Luckily the neighbour was happy to help us sort it out! Overall we had a very relaxing and enjoyable visit and will be back again!\n\nReviewed by Michelle5.0★Aug 2022\n\n\"The house and location were wonderful and the welcome pack provided was out of this world!\"\n\nWill try and book again for next year for sure.\n\nReviewed by Andrew5.0★Jul 2022\n\n\"We had a lovely stay.\"\n\nThe welcome pack was incredible and the house has such charm. It is well equipped and comfortable. We loved coffee in the morning and a lazy start. Then beach games and a sea swim. Frinton has a nice high street to potter along. Thank you!\n\nReviewed by Ruth5.0★Jul 2022\n\n\"We had a wonderful week in this comfortable home.\"\n\nThe owners had taken considerable trouble to ensure we had everything we needed. There was a hugely generous welcome basket and this reflected the generosity, kindness and thoughtful attention to detail that the owners had bestowed throughout the house. It felt like a home, not just somewhere you stay on holiday. We would like to say a very big thank you to Glynis & Paul and hope to return again.\n\nReviewed by Claire5.0★Apr 2022\n\n\"We had everything we needed for our relaxing break.\"\n\nYou could tell the home owners had thought through what people might want to do and provided it. Really impressed.\n\nReviewed by Fiona5.0★Apr 2022\n\n\"We had such a wonderful time at The Yellow House.\"\n\nThe welcome basket was tailored for us and very much enjoyed! Clean, comfortable and well equipped. We nearly refused to leave! Thank you for having us.\n\nReviewed by Jenni5.0★Feb 2022\n\n\"A wonderful holiday home.\"\n\nClean, spacious, well-equipped with bags of character. Had the added bonus for me of being very similar to my Granny's house and bringing back lots of happy memories. Moments from the sea. Very kind and helpful (though not intrusive) owners. Lovely garden. Quiet and peaceful location. The only issue we had was the owner accidentally gave us the key code with one digit out, so we couldn't get in at first. In fairness to her, we called and she answered straight away and then gave us the correct code and we got in. However- if I were to go again, I'd definitely double-check any info I'd been given before setting off. We would heartily recommend this property to just about anyone. Thank you very much for a very enjoyable stay.\n\nReviewed by Rebecca5.0★Jan 2022\n\n\"A wonderful house to rent for a week with our family over Christmas.\"\n\nClean, comfortable and cosy. Great for long walks on the beach and a small town to explore. Owners very helpful and welcoming, we highly recommend this property.\n\nReviewed by Susan4.7★Dec 2021\n\n\"We really enjoyed our stay in this lovely spacious house.\"\n\nWe particularly loved the big dining room and the well equipped kitchen. The owners provided a generous welcome basket which was greatly appreciated. The beach is a short distance away and is safe as it shelves very gradually as I remember well from my childhood growing up here. A variety of shops including a baker, butcher and wet fish shop are a short walk away. There are also supermarkets within easy reach. This house is ideal for a relaxing holiday particularly for walkers, bird watchers (at the nearby Naze) and fans of swimming.\n\nReviewed by Melanie5.0★Nov 2021\n\n\"Great location and Glynis & Paul we're wonderfully helpful.\"\n\nLovely welcome basket on arrival. Would definitely recommend the Yellow House on the Corner. Also, highly recommend Avenue Bistro for a nice meal.\n\nReviewed by Steve4.7★Oct 2021\n\n\"This house is amazing both in character and convenient position for the beach which is one of the most child friendliest around.\"\n\nThe hosts went out of the way to make sure we had a brilliant time and left us a beautiful basket of age appropriate goodies. The garden was super for little ones to play safely and to hide in all the little dingle dells. We loved the dining room with space to sit and eat as a family, the children pretended it was a restaurant and served dinner! We cannot fault the effort made by the owners and the quality of towels bedding etc. We did take our own safety gate as the stairs are big and our babies were 4 and 2. Walton on the Naze beach and the Tower are worth a visit we didn’t really need to go anywhere else ! This house is the secret you want to keep but feel you should share with everyone it is a home not a boutique show house there is one tv in the lounge for those quiet evenings when the little ones are in bed and a super veranda that Nana spent most of the week on! With grandchildren curled up beside. I would love a washing whirling thing in the garden as the airier wasn’t big enough for 8 towels/ swimmers baby gear etc. We wanted to save electricity and not use the dryer. Definitely a 10/10 holiday. Highly recommended. We will be back.\n\nReviewed by Sue5.0★Aug 2021\n\n\"On arrival, initial impressions were very good, upon entry to the property it was spotlessly clean, level of décor was fantastic, spacious and very welcoming, lovely garden and good location just 5 minutes walk to Frinton town centre, the welcome pack was the best I've ever seen.\"\n\nAll round thoroughly recommended.\n\nReviewed by Robin4.1★Aug 2021\n\n\"Beautiful house and garden, spotlessly clean.\"\n\nThe owners went the extra mile in making us feel welcome including leaving a very thoughtful bundle of bread, eggs, milk, biscuits and more. The house is a very short walk to the stunning sandy beach meaning we could pop back for anything we needed. It's also walking distance to the town centre. After a lovely relaxing week, we would highly recommend this property.\n\nReviewed by Zoe4.7★Jul 2021\n\n\"The Yellow House in the Corner was an excellent choice for our holiday with our big family of 8 (6 adults and 2 children).\"\n\nOur hosts could not have been kinder or more thoughtful, providing a welcome hamper, meeting our adult children at the cottage on their arrival and showing them around, and suggesting places to visit in and around Frinton. We had lots of space to spread out as the house is truly wonderful, with a beautiful garden and little nooks to hide in with a good book.\n\nReviewed by Aayesha4.7★Jul 2021"
