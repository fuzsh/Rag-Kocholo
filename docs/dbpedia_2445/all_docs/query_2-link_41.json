        "text": "What's been going on at St Mary's?\n\nLatest from Alex, Jessica & Sophie\n\nAlex, Tori & Jovi: They feel so blessed to have had a safe and uneventful journey from Canada to their new home in Bristol. They are presently in a small basement flat, arranged by Love Bristol, trying to find room to unpack the things they need.\n\nAlex is working, with some great guys, on maintenance for the group. Tori is presently caring for Jovi and getting to know others in their accommodation. They are helping in the Community Hub for a few hours, which will increase, and are looking forward to being fully involved in the Love Bristol charity. They ask for prayer and God's guidance as they settle into this new life.\n\nJessica is is enjoying the YWAM Disciple Bible course in New Zealand. She would appreciate prayer for guidance as to whether to stay on to help as staff with YWAM when the course is finishes and for financial help with the cost of the course.\n\nSophie has found work with the café, where she worked\n\npart-time when on an internship at Citizen Church, Cardiff.\n\nView her talk on 'Love' (at 9m. 30s.) here on YouTube.\n\nWe wish them all continued happiness\n\nas they follow God's guidance.\n\nTricia Hamilton, 19 May 2023\n\nChristmas Shoebox Appeal\n\nIn December 2022, members of St Mary’s contributed around 80 shoeboxes to Operation Christmas Child. Most went to Ukraine and neighbouring countries housing Ukrainian refugees.\n\nAmidst the devastation in Turkey and Syria following the earthquakes, Samaritan’s Purse opened an emergency field hospital in Antakya, Turkey; it includes two emergency operating rooms and a pharmacy. It is situated on property surrounding the 1,100- bed Hatay State Hospital, which was made unsafe following the earthquakes.\n\nSamaritan’s Purse continues to respond to global emergencies, sharing God’s love and bringing relief to people in desperate situations, including conflict, natural disaster, disease, and poverty. Over the past year, Samaritan’s Purse teams have worked, in Jesus’ name, to meet the physical needs of suffering people in – the Ukraine, Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Sudan, Niger and Sinjar (a mountainous region of Iraq)\n\nFurther information regarding the work of Samaritan’s Purse follow this link to their website.\n\nThank you for your ongoing prayers\n\nand financial support for Samaritan’s Purse.\n\nHelen Whybrew - June 2023\n\nWalton & District Community Food Bank\n\nThe Walton Food Bank is still needing appropriate supplies, so if you can contribute something it would be gratefully appreciated by those in need during these straitened times. The supplies donation box remains in the Lounge.\n\nIf you would like to donate financially, these are their bank details: 20-21-73 and a/c 03853861.\n\nThank you all. Brian Allen\n\nJaywick Project\n\nIn order to provide extra food to families in Jaywick for the school holidays, when children do not have school dinners to supplement their diet, I would be happy to receive any donations of tins, packet foods such as pasta, rice, cereals, biscuits, crisps, etc. We also welcome cash donations to buy food for families in Jaywick. Delivery of these Summer Supplies will begin at end of July.\n\nThank you for your generosity. Eleanor Young\n\nOur Church Secretary\n\nAfter many years of devoted service to St Mary’s Church, Heather Ursell stepped down from her role as Church Secretary at the end of December 2022.\n\nAs Church Secretary, Heather has oiled the wheels of church life, enabling the smooth running of services, rotas, homegroups, and all manner of church events. The assistance Heather has given to me as a personal assistant has also been huge, making sure the Rector does not forget too much of what he is supposed to be doing.\n\nHeather will remain with St Mary’s, and who knows what the Lord will have in store for her very capable hands in the future? Thank you for your kind and devoted service, Heather!\n\nRev Don Smith\n\nChristmas Shoebox 2022\n\nThank you to all who have donated shoeboxes to this year’s Operation Christmas Child Shoebox Appeal. As a church we have sent at least 67 boxes. This number includes boxes filled and brought back to church, as well as those donated on-line by church members. (Thank you for letting me know if you sent an online shoebox as this enabled me to add your boxes to our total.)\n\nIt is wonderful to think of and pray for the children in needy situations around the world who, through receiving a gift-filled shoebox, will be filled with the hope and joy of Christmas this year.\n\nHelen Whybrew, 1 December 2022\n\nA Huge 'Thank You!'\n\nWe both want to say a huge 'Thank you' for the warm send off last Sunday and for the incredibly generous gift. We were so taken aback by this, but are extremely grateful and thank you so much to those who contributed.\n\nWe have grown so much since moving to Frinton.\n\nOur girls have both spent their whole lives here and it’s so hard for us to say goodbye.\n\nWe will be back to visit, but in the meantime thank you to all of you\n\nfor your love, prayers and support.\n\nWith all our love,\n\nSam, Lauren, Eva & Isla Puttick - October 2022\n\nHarvest Celebration - 25 September\n\nTo show our gratitude to God at harvest time, this year’s donations were for Walton Foodbank, and for Christmas treats for Jaywick, both the same charities as last year.\n\nWalton Foodbank always appreciate the food with long shelf-life, such as coffee, sugar, UHT milk, tinned meat, tinned, tomatoes, tinned fruit, and all sorts of hygiene goods, including shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, washing-up liquid.\n\nRegarding the Jaywick Project, church member Eleanor Young says, \"We would like to support the children’s pantomime again by providing drinks, crisps, selection boxes and fruit for about seventy children, so will need financial donations to provide this. We would also be grateful to receive tins of biscuits or small boxes of sweets or chocolates which can be wrapped as Christmas presents for the elderly and families.\"\n\nFriends of Essex Churches Trust\n\nI have taken part in the above on what was a near perfect day for my cycle-ride. I visited 19 churches in Clacton, Frinton, and Walton and to date have raised £860. This sum is still rising so it is not too late to donate. Barclays Bank has agreed to match-fund me again this year. A big thank you to all those who have sponsored me.\n\nYour support is much appreciated.\n\nWith thanks - Ruth Spellman\n\nThe Jaywick Project\n\nThanks to everyone’s support for families and children during the summer holidays we have been able to provide one hundred and two bags of food, plus another twelve for the elderly in Jaywick. I was overwhelmed by your generous donations which amounted to £1430, as well as groceries which provided the bags for the elderly.\n\nI am very grateful for the help I received from Frances and Brian Allen, Marilyn Smith, Lynn Chapman and Judy Morris in buying, sorting and delivering the food bags to Jaywick - also for the assistance from Stewart, our caretaker, in loading.\n\nThank you so much for all your support.\n\nEleanor Young - 20 August 2022\n\nSt Mary's Players\n\nJust to let you all know that the Players raised £534.68 with their Jubilee Indoor Street Party for ongoing funding for Children's and Family work.\n\nThank you all for your support and donations and thanks to Cate for the spam sandwiches!\n\nWatch this webpage for news of our Next Extravaganza.\n\nEddie McKay - 1 July 2022\n\nExploring our Faith\n\nOur six sessions have just concluded where twenty-four of us met together on consecutive Wednesday evenings. The material we used was from Leading your Church into Growth (LYCIG), primarily from The Start Course, as we explored the main aspects of the Christian faith.\n\nIt was extraordinary how we straightaway gelled as a group with numbers being maintained throughout and with some great new friendships being made. It was very much an “all age” group where many of us were from very different stages in the journey of life with Jesus. We thank God that it all worked so well. It was very encouraging to feel the love and support of each other.\n\nThe only disappointment was when our course came to an end. Several of us are now looking into joining existing church home groups. The feeling was also expressed by the group that they would be keen to follow up later in the year with an Exploring our Faith Course Part 2. If you would like to know more and be included please don’t hesitate to get in touch via the Church Office.\n\nPeter Wood, 2 June 2022\n\nRide & Stride\n\nFriends of Essex Churches Trust, Ride & Stride, takes place on the second Saturday in September each year. Churches all over the area are open on this date to receive visits from walkers and cyclists who are raising funds from sponsors for taking part in this event.\n\nSt Mary's Church raised the most money for this event in 2021 – that is to say, Ruth Spellman did - and has been awarded a prestigious trophy. This is displayed in the Church Lounge together with a photograph of the trophy being presented to Ruth by the Lord Lieutenant of Essex at Brentwood Cathedral during their Annual General Meeting in May. Ruth has taken part in the Ride & Stride for many years and her previous employer, Barclays Bank Ltd, provides matched funding for the amount raised by her each year.\n\nFriends of Essex Churches Trust provides grants to churches of all denominations for renovations and repairs. Their website gives details of the annual Ride & Stride and interesting information about the Trust. It would be great to have more people taking part in Ride & Stride, walking or cycling, this year, if it appeals to anyone. St Mary’s is very appreciative of this wonderful donation every year, and especially grateful to Ruth.\n\nHeather Ursell, 2 June 2022\n\nUkraine Crisis Appeal\n\nWell done and thank you everyone, especially Wendy Willis, for a tremendous result from last Friday’s Coffee morning.\n\nThe event raised a total of £880 which will be going to The Ukrainian Crisis (Field Hospital) Appeal via the charity Samaritans Purse.\n\nThe highlight of the coffee morning was with Wendy Willis playing her beautiful music throughout inside the church on the grand piano. A good number of people turned out and a huge sum was raised for this great cause. This sum is in addition to the £1,051 raised previously at St Mary’s in aid of The Ukrainian Crisis Appeal.\n\nPeter Wood, 16 May 2022\n\nMusic at St Mary's\n\nWe have been holding lunchtime concerts on Thursdays during June and July for more than 25 years. Some artists have been coming back to perform for a number of years. One such player is Panos Karan, a pianist, who first performed as a student for us back in 2002. Since then he has gone on to gain an international reputation, having performed around the world, including in the USA and Japan. However, he remembers his roots and returns once a year to Frinton, because of the warm reception that he receives here.\n\nHaving missed our live events for the past 2 years, it was with great pleasure that he returned to us for a Launch Evening for the Summer Series on Saturday, 23 April. He brought with him a fellow musician, also from London, Maiko Mori.\n\nMembers of the audience were welcomed into church with Drinks & Canapés made by our very own team, Cate, Chris and Barbara.\n\nThe concert soon started with a string of Encores played and introduced by Panos, which delighted the audience. After the interval, Maiko joined Panos to play a 4-handed version of The Rite of Spring which astounded the audience. You could have heard a pin drop!\n\nThe virtuosity and musicianship was a thrilling experience to witness.\n\nDuncan Archard, 24 April 2022\n\nChristmas Shoebox Appeal 2021\n\nThank you for being part of something amazing! As a result of the partnership of churches and other community groups, Operation Christmas Child in the United Kingdom sent an amazing 277,350 gift-filled shoeboxes to children around the world.\n\nThis is part of a global total of 10.5 million shoebox gifts sent by the UK and other partnering countries to hurting children worldwide.\n\nLearn more about the appeal by clicking on this link.\n\nHelen Whybrew, 20 March 2022\n\nRecycling\n\nWe have re-launched our link with Terracycle, which is a programme that handles items which are hard to recycle through our normal waste bins. Each of the items collected has a monetary reward for us as a church.\n\nYou will find plastic boxes in the Lounge, labelled with the appropriate waste item for each box.\n\nYou can recycle:\n\nAny brand cheese wrappers\n\nAny brand bread bags\n\nAny brand washing powder packaging\n\nAny car air fresheners\n\nAny anti-bacterial wipe packaging\n\nEvolve water filters\n\nAnd more!!\n\nPlease see the posters on the boxes in Reception for exact information\n\nor contact the Office and Reception Team.\n\nOver 90s Group\n\nSt Mary’s Over 90s meet on the first Monday of the month in the Lounge for fellowship, reminiscing, tea/cake and prayer.\n\nWe enjoyed a lovely sunny afternoon when we celebrated Mothering Sunday and God’s wonderful blessing of children.\n\nRuth Spellman & Tricia Hamilton, 7 March 2022\n\nConfirmation at St Nicholas' Church, Harwich\n\nSunday, 30 January\n\nWe were thrilled that six people from St Mary’s joined our confirmation preparation course at the end of last year: Dan, Diane, Garry, Sheila, Justin, and Karen. Their confirmation service took place at St Nicholas’ Church in Harwich, a large church chosen to accommodate all the candidates and their guests - many from St Marys! There were also nine other candidates from seven other churches.\n\nThe Bishop of Colchester, the Right Reverend Roger Morris, conducted the service, baptising one person, and confirming fifteen. Confirmation is the opportunity for each person to be able to ‘confirm’ the promises made on their behalf by godparents when they were baptised, probably as a baby.\n\nThe Bishop prayed individually for each person, that the Holy Spirit would confirm them in their calling to follow Jesus Christ, as they publicly declared their faith in Him.\n\n31 January 2022\n\nLCM Toy Services\n\nSunday, 5 December\n\nIt was good to welcome Terry Puttick to our Toy Service to speak on behalf of the London City Mission. He has written to thank us for the excellent toys and gifts which are found to be so helpful as they seek to reach out to families in London.\n\nFrom its earliest roots in 1835 the LCM has been committed to folk in Bermondsey and the toys have been dropped off to Mark Fyffe, missionary, who is well connected with families living there.\n\nDeprivation in Bermondsey is particularly extreme and rates as one of the most needy areas in the country. Terry writes: \"The practical expression of God's love through these gifts really makes an impact. Mark and others in the team take every opportunity to bring the message of hope through the gospel to the families they visit.\"\n\nLesley Holland, 5 December 2021\n\nSt Mary's Christmas Fayre\n\nThe Fayre on Saturday, 27 November was a huge success, I am so grateful to everyone who was involved in the planning, set up and running of different things on the day Thank you!\n\nWe raised an amazing total of £1533.70! We had a wonderful café with homemade cakes, 17 stalls, kids' craft table and Santa’s Grotto. We had a total of 78 children visit Santa.\n\nThe feedback from people attending was so positive. Visitors said the atmosphere was so warm and welcoming and that’s down to the people involved, so again, thank you. Bring on next year!\n\nLauren Puttick, 28 November 2021\n\nKeep Smiling Through!\n\nSt Mary's Players gave their audience much needed smiles on Saturday evening with a review evoking wartime memories. The production, devised and organised by the professional Eddie McKay, was to raise funds for the young people's work in the church.\n\nEddie led her troupe of able players, capturing many scenes from daily life in the '40s. There were popular songs featuring clever nods to George Formby and Gracie Fields, along with touching sketches and poetry spotlighting evacuation, and the housewives' non existent eggs.\n\n'Make do and Mend' was the motto., though this did not apply to the scrumptious buffet in the interval, complete with Spam sandwiches.\n\n'A Nightingale sang in Berkeley Square' and 'We'll gather Lilacs in the Spring again' were among many musical favourites whilst the evening ended with a rousing version of 'There'll always be an England'. Audience and troupe felt this was true!\n\nThank you, St Mary's Players! - Jenny Rose, 21 November 2021\n\nHarvest Celebration\n\nThis year’s Harvest gifts were shared between The Jaywick Project and Walton FoodBank.\n\nFor Jaywick, we donated boxes of biscuits, both savoury and sweet, to be used as special Christmas gifts to residents in the area. The Walton FoodBank received tins of fruit and vegetables, various packets of dried food, tea, coffee, and ‘hygiene items’ too, such as toothpaste, toilet rolls, and cleaning materials.\n\nThank you to everyone who donated to these worthy causes, out of gratitude to God that we have so much. Please do pray too for all the recipients, as well as for the volunteers who commit to helping those in need.\n\nHeather Ursell - 27 September 2021\n\nFriends of\n\nEssex Churches Trust\n\nSaturday, 11 September\n\nFriends of Essex Churches Trust makes grants to historic churches and chapels of all Christian denominations towards repair and restoration costs. Any money raised is shared equally between the Trust and St Marys.\n\nI have supported the event for the last 12 years and each year Barclays Bank has matched the funds I raise. Similar to previous years, I have once again raised £750, which will generously be matched by the bank!\n\n(This means that Ruth has - singlehandedly - been responsible for an incredible £9,000 of income for St Mary’s over twelve years! - Church Secretary)\n\nThis event is always in the second week in September. The weather was fine on Saturday, so I was very disappointed at the low numbers of visitors we had to our church this year, although I appreciate it is early days for us emerging from COVID!\n\nWith thanks for all your support.\n\nRuth Spellman\n\nPoems for Our Times\n\nEddie McKay asked for suggestions of words and phrases linked somehow with our current situation. She then made up poems using words and lines contributed by a number of people within St Mary’s. If you would like to carry this on, please send your contribution to Eddie; contact details in the church directory. Click on the image below to see the poem e nlarged.\n\nPoem #10\n\nClick here for access to\n\nEddie's earlier poems:\n\nPoem #1\n\nPoem #2Poem #3\n\nPoem #4\n\nPoem #5\n\nPoem #6\n\nPoem #7\n\nPoem #8\n\nPoem #9\n\nA Day of Prayer for our Nation took place all over the country on Friday, 22 January. People were invited to choose any one, or more, of the 24 hours in which to pray, either alone or within households or on Zoom platforms. Also, at St Mary’s, about twenty-five of us gathered, via Zoom, to pray together for 40 minutes, making up the hour, before or after, however we personally chose to pray.\n\nWe began by recognising God’s power and authority, and our need for his forgiveness and mercy as our nation has chosen to go its own way and not his way. We were then guided, by the Rector, to pray for different aspects of the coronavirus pandemic, including for those who are suffering physically, mentally or financially, and their families, and for everyone who has lost loved ones. Together we prayed for hospital and other medical staff of every kind, and all sorts of key-workers and their families. We prayed for students of all ages and those who teach and mentor them, and for those in government, often making impossible decisions. And we prayed that Jesus be honoured, and his people empowered to live by his Spirit, speaking and acting in his Name.\n\nHeather Ursell, 23 January\n\nRev John Dunnett, CPAS General Director, had been due to come to St Mary’s in June, to preach to the congregation and to update our church leaders on various sensitive religious and political matters. Due to lockdown, this was unable to take place, but, with his permission, we are pleased to be able to hear a short sermon he preached (remotely) on Remembrance Sunday at St Margaret’s, Stanford-le-Hope.\n\nBible reference Romans 8:28 Title: Opportunities for God to work in our lives.\n\nClick on the link to go to his Facebook video.\n\nOur charity, which raises money to supply a clean water system for villages in Togo,\n\nis now registered with AmazonSmile!\n\nThis means that when you shop through AmazonSmile,\n\nthe charity receives 0.5% of the total you spend,\n\nthough items are all sold at the normal Amazon price.\n\nJust click on the link below before starting to shop.\n\nhttps://smile.amazon.co.uk/ch/1187267-0\n\nDuring these times when we cannot raise money through our usual methods, we hope, God willing, this will give us a steady oncome. Please spread the word to all your friends in whatever ways you can, and help us support this important cause.\n\nSue Jenkins, 27 October 2020\n\nThank you for all your prayers for this year’s online Frinton Mission week. We know very many people viewed the various videos, including 6% of views in 19 different countries! If you missed watching anything, remember it’s still available to view on the FM website.\n\nWe pray that people who watched anything during the week will have heard something helpful or encouraging, just right for them. And we pray that anyone who wants to know more about Jesus will find someone who can tell them, either online or locally.\n\nIf anyone has missed being able to hear this year’s online talks, they might like to buy a DVD of the week, so they can still enjoy the teaching. DVDs cost £5 each and will contain:\n\neither all five Lifeline talks by Peter Morden,\n\nor all five Marquee Mornings talks by Tim Rose and all seven Thoughts for the Day talks.\n\nPlease contact Ian Harrison to arrange payment and delivery: Click here to email Ian.\n\nBible Study - John 14\n\nWhen we first went into Lockdown, our rector, Don Smith, thought of a range of activities to help bridge the gap between our past and our future. For himself, as you know, he undertook the marathon of sharing daily thoughts with the world, which is much appreciated by very many people. He also commenced a short, pre-recorded online service, premiered at 10.30 every Sunday, and more recently has launched Thursday Church which is live, via the Zoom platform, where people can see and talk to each other. Pray for Today is another of his initiatives, two weeks’ worth of guided prayers, also available online.\n\nIn case there was a gap in anyone’s day or heart, and especially for any who are not able to meet regularly with their homegroup, he also suggested we offered an online Bible Study. Brian Kyriacou has kindly prepared the first of those, which is based in John Chapter 14.\n\nClick here for Part 1 & Click here for Part 2.\n\nYou wonder how Brian has done that? There’s one way to find out!\n\nPlease do make the most of these and other resources, via our website. Although a labour of love, they all take considerable time and effort to put together, so it is very pleasing to discover they are also being used! Do write to us to let us know!\n\nNo Church? Different Church!\n\nDuring this time of lock down we have enjoyed the daily thoughts that Don, the rector shares with us online each morning. These punchy talks are given in the style of a relaxed and homely armchair chat and are not empty chatter but very thought-provoking and down to earth, giving us plenty to think about during the day.\n\nThe Sunday services online also carry a comfortable feel to them and are well presented with good graphics and sound quality. It is so good that different people take part and there is a good mix of both the traditional and modern forms of worship. I particularly like the times of prayer when it is as if we are in the church rather than our lounge; on our own and yet we are all together. I quite like sitting with a cup of coffee and wearing slippers! Jacquie Moyse\n\n‘Lifeline’? No, not FM but right here, right now, every day at St Mary's the Lord casts out His lifeline of hope through Don's daily inspirations, Zoom prayer groups, homegroups, Thursday Church and, of course, our Sunday service. We thank and praise our Lord for keeping us united as a church family, His family!Lesley Conley\n\nI am thankful to everyone involved with pulling together the online services and children's services. We are spoilt! We can watch at a convenient time for us. Use the pause button - difficult to stop the service when we are all together in church! - watch anything again. Will the services be videoed when 'normal church’ resumes.....?!!! John Moyse\n\nWhat I appreciate they are doing on-line? Yes, it is different! But I love the on-line services on a Sunday morning. Congratulations to Sam Puttick who has learned new skills putting all the individual video clips together into a coherent whole. Thank you Don for your linking of the pieces together. Thank you to our Readers of Poems and the passage from the Bible. Thank you to our Pray-ers. Thank you to the team of Preachers. I guess none of those who contribute have ever spoken to camera in this way before. Skype calls don’t really count do they? So new skills are being learned by so many.\n\nSeeing our contributors in close-up, gives a new dimension to their contribution. We aren’t just hearing the words spoken from a lectern or pulpit far away in the distance, we are seeing the impact the words have on the individuals themselves. Last by not least, a huge thank-you to Heather for arranging the rotas and coordinating the people for each of the sections in the service. Brilliant concept…and a real blessing to all who are able to watch. Thank you everyone.Mike Denny\n\nWe have appreciated everything very much: Sunday services, Thursday Church, homegroup and small ‘homegroup chats’ with just three of us at a time, and the daily talk from Don. It has been enormously appreciated, that lots of people have put in so much hard work to enable this to happen. Thank you all so very much.Hilary & Jerry Russell\n\nYouth Trip To Abernethy\n\nWhat an incredible weekend we had!\n\nOn Day 1 we had a very smooth journey which started at 5am. We had lots of fun at the centre, swimming & a movie night! There wasn’t much snow so we kept praying it would snow overnight so we could go skiing!\n\nOn Day 2 we woke up to snow and there was so much more at the Ski Centre - the best conditions of the season so far! Praise God! We spent the day at the Lecht Ski Centre, then had a swim and an evening session together, finishing with the movie - such a good day!\n\nOn our final day half the group spent the morning at the Lecht Ski Centre and the other half went for a walk up to a beautiful viewpoint next to the Abernethy centre where we were staying. We then had a long journey home with a couple of delays and everyone was feeling very tired!!\n\nAll in all we all had an incredible weekend!\n\nThank you to all who supported this\n\nand made it happen, we all feel so blessed\n\nto have had such a wonderful experience\n\nwith our church family!\n\nLauren Puttick - 9 March 2020\n\nJust Desserts!\n\nYesterday afternoon Wendy Willis kindly treated a dozen WoW ladies to their ‘just desserts’!\n\nBefore...\n\n… and after!\n\nYou see, there would have been plenty for you too!\n\nThank you, Wendy!\n\nAll ladies always welcome.\n\nHeather Ursell - 21 February 2020\n\nOld Church Garden\n\nAnn Hopkins has been providing plants for the two flower-beds each side of the Old Church West Doors for many years. She has always lovingly cared for the beds herself to ensure they offer a special welcome to all those entering, especially brides.\n\nShe sadly feels she can no longer continue the work, which Judith Jones and Sylvia Marsh have kindly agreed to take over.\n\nWe thank Ann for her committed and enthusiastic help over many years which has helped maintain the charm and beauty of the Old Church garden.\n\nThe Churchwardens - 3 January 2020\n\nFrinton Rotary Club Carol Service\n\nThis evening St Mary's was once again packed with people as we hosted Frinton Rotary Club's Annual Carol Service with Clacton's Co-operative Band and contributions from the choirs of Hamford Primary Academy, Frinton Primary, Walton Primary and St Philomena’s Catholic School.\n\nTricia Hamilton - 3 December\n\nA First Look at the Tree!\n\nPictured are some of our wonderful Over Nineties Group: Ann Anthony, Joyce Samuels and Doris Swallow.\n\nThe group meets monthly with Ruth Spellman and myself. This month we enjoyed a Christmas tea together and took an early look at St Mary’s Christmas tree!\n\nTricia Hamilton - 2 December\n\nAnnual Toy Service\n\nTerry Puttick, of the London City Mission, spoke at this morning's service, and took the donated toys back to London. He says: 'It was a joy being with you all at St Mary’s. Andrew Rose said it was in 1995 that we started coming to the Toy Service!\n\nIt is always a joy to receive the toys and gifts from St Mary’s; the quality is always first class. The toys will be making their way out to the least-reached districts of London, as we make them available to missionaries to pass on to families they have c ontacted.\n\nYear on year, the toys show a tangible expression of love, and give great opportunities to speak about God’s greatest gift, the Lord Jesus Christ. Please would you express our very grateful thanks for the wonderful gifts and for the many, many years dear friends at St Mary’s have stood alongside us in prayer.\n\nSt Mary’s is very dear to our hearts and we are so blessed by the love shown to us and the family.'\n\nHeather Ursell - 1 December\n\nA Christmas Carol\n\nSt Mary's Players welcomed a large audience to become involved in A Christmas Carol, skilfully adapted by Eddie McKay. Using hats, songs, slides, dance plus choral speaking, the cast gained in volume and confidence as they unfolded Dickens' world.\n\nSinister Marley set the Spirits tasks, cowering Scrooge was gloriously reformed. Festive interval food was refreshing.\n\nWell done cast and crew, to echo Tiny Tim,\n\nGod bless you, everyone.\n\nJenny Rose - 30 November\n\nSpectacular Piano Play by Wendy Willis\n\nFrom 10am until 12noon\n\nWendy entertained us in the Lounge and north aisle of the church. Her offerings included a varied selection of music, taking us around Britain, with show songs, sacred & secular favourites, and one or two classics.\n\nDonations totalled £201 and were in aid of the\n\nYouth Abernethy Trip.\n\n(See below)\n\nChristmas Shoebox Appeal 2019\n\nThank you to everyone who has filled a shoebox already this year. Many thanks again for supporting this amazing project, which shares God’s goodness to us with others far less\n\nfortunate than ourselves.\n\nThank you - Helen Whybrew\n\nGuest Speaker, Simon King\n\nOur Invitational Dinner has become an annual event and once again, last Saturday, this was a great success.\n\nEighty-five of us sat down to a splendid three-course dinner, beautifully prepared for us by Cate W and Karen H. As usual the tables were set to a high standard and were each headed up by a serving host.\n\nOur after-dinner speaker was Simon King, a paramedic and senior manager with The East of England Ambulance Service. He spoke about his amazing career in the Service and how being a Christian has affected and benefitted him in his life. He illustrated his talk with examples of the seriousness of what being a paramedic is, but also offered us a taste of his refreshing humour. ( A podcast is available here.)\n\nAll those attending donated generously at the end of the evening. The proceeds were divided between The Christian Ambulance Association and St Mary’s.\n\nPeter Wood, 19 October 2019\n\nF ull immersion in the sea!\n\nOne of the young people in our Church, Max Aylen (14), decided it was time to reaffirm his baptism vows by full immersion in the sea!\n\nOther church members, along with his family and friends, came down to the beach at the end of Connaught Avenue this evening to witness this heartfelt expression of Christian Faith.\n\nI am sure everyone enjoyed warming up again with tea & cake at church afterwards!\n\nDon Smith, 24 September 2019\n\nSt Mary's Treasury Team\n\nThe opportunity to snap a photo was too much to overlook!\n\nI caught these three together outside the church office enjoying the warm August sunshine. Here we have our current Treasurer Marion Bullock, with Treasurer Designate Peter Brierley in the middle, plus Asst. Treasurer John Moyse.\n\nWe are all so grateful for the giving of their time, care and professional services.\n\nPeter Wood, 27 August 2019\n\nSt Mary the Virgin (The Old Church)\n\nThe Rector, Don Smith, and I were asked to talk to Tim Gillet of BBC Essex about the peace and history of the Old Church and its churchyard, as a result of winning 3rd prize in the Best Kept Churchyard in Essex competition.\n\nListen again to the broadcast here.\n\nTricia Hamilton, 25 August 2019\n\nThursday Lunchtime Concert Series 2019\n\nWe are pleased to say that we had another successful series with excellent music and appreciative audiences.\n\nThe amount raised by the concerts (divided equally between the Colchester Branch of The Samaritans and the church here at St Mary's) was £1,614.52.\n\nThanks go to all who attended and also the helpers who welcomed people from not only this church but further afield.\n\nDuncan Archard, 19 August 2019\n\nThose involved in Water4All have been amazed at the wonderful things God is doing, helping us raise money for 183 water-filtration units for two villages in Togo. We have raised enough for 93 units; only 90 to go.\n\nWe recently had a quiz and disco through the support of Market Field School. We plan a Tea Dance on 12 October in Great Holland Village Hall, and a Curry Night on 14 March 2020. We hope to raise further funds by handing out empty water bottles for people to save loose change. Keep an eye out for these coming soon!\n\nPlease pray for Gad Numadi when he travels back to Togo on 19 August, when he will install the filtration units for which we have already raised money.\n\nSue Jenkins, 30 June 2019\n\nOfferings\n\nAs you probably know by now, from Sunday, 30 June we will not take up a collection during our services, but will instead provide a large glass jar (a carboy) for offerings at each church entrance.\n\nMost regular givers to God through St Mary's now give via the highly recommended Parish Giving Scheme. We continue to encourage people to give in that way, but, of course, we will also welcome gifts by other means.\n\nOfferings dropped into the carboys will be counted and banked, as normal, with thanks given to God for their provision.\n\nThe Churchwardens, 19 June 2019\n\nSoup Run Update\n\nA big thank you for your donations, sandwich-making and prayer.\n\nThe number of visitors to the soup run has increased substantially recently with as many as 40 people turning up on some nights. They appreciate the help you are giving them and are al-ways thanking us. Greggs now donate their unsold food to soup run on a daily basis. Initially this was given out by another group but this is has now been taken up by local churches. Despite this extra donation, sandwiches, crisps and biscuits are still needed because of larger numbers and the inconsistency of how much is provided.\n\nAt the moment the store cupboard is short of some items; crisps, powdered milk, coffee, biscuits and sugar are always welcome but we have lots of tea, drinking chocolate and soup at the moment. Individually wrapped sugar portions and food with a short sell by date can not be used.\n\nPlease pray for our visitors as it is clear that they are not having an easy life living from hand to mouth.\n\nIan Noble, 16 June 2019\n\nFun in the Sun!\n\nI took this picture last Sunday of the Youth and Toddlers from our 11am service enjoying their session in the amazing garden space we have at St Mary's.\n\nOur toddlers & youth and the youth from Frinton Gospel Chapel enjoying church in the sunshine during today’s service.\n\nSam Puttick, 3 June 2019\n\nCockney Ding-Dong\n\nSt Mary's Players once again put on a wonderful show this evening - this time a spirited collection of songs and monologues with a cockney flavour! (Above: Burlington Bertie from Bow)\n\nOver 90 people enjoyed a variety of entertaining performances, many of which invited audience participation. The ticket price included a feast of bangers & mash with delicious sweet treats for 'afters'. Many thanks to David Ashton and Cate Wilby & Team for all the interval offerings!\n\nHere's to the next memorable evening conjured up with Eddie McKay's amazing imagination!\n\nDavid Wicks - 1 June 2019\n\nMemorial Service\n\nOn Sunday, 5 May, a memorial service for those we have “loved and lost” was held at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Frinton-on-Sea (the ‘Old Church’).\n\nThe service was led by the Rev Andrew Rose, and lessons and prayers were read by Jenny Rose, Chris and Sally Perry. Hilda Poulter gave a moving testimony in memory of her husband.\n\nIt was, at times, an emotional but most moving and peaceful service, attended by 44 worshippers. Candles were lit and placed on a wooden cross on the altar, names of loved ones were written on ‘leaves’, which were placed on a memorial tree on the altar. The leaves remained in place until the following Sunday when they were buried in the Garden of Rest, by the Rector Don Smith, supported by members of the evensong congregation. We are grateful to St Andrew's Church, Kyrenia, Northern Cyprus, (in the diocese of Jerusalem and the Middle East), for the idea of this service. They planted the seeds and we are nurturing the growth. Many have commented on this service and have requested and look forward to this simple, annual service of remembrance.\n\nSally Perry, 14 May 2019\n\nSplash\n\nToday we entered our Sunday Splash session (years 5-10) to find our room had been raided!\n\nWe quickly discovered that although scary, frustrating and uncomfortable for the children, it was done by the leaders as an example of what is happening to Christians in Churches around the world.\n\nIt was an amazing way to get a glimpse of how the persecuted church must feel. We at St Mary’s are supporters of Open Doors. Along with our prayers, we also donate to the great work they do to support our Brothers and Sisters around the world in their persecution.\n\nLauren Puttick, 12 May 2019\n\nBridget's last letter!\n\nBridget Howard has now retired from missionary service in Rwanda with AIM International, and has settled for the time being in Wallington, Surrey, near her main sending and supporting Churches since 1980. The coming year will be spent on deputation work and Rwanda ‘debriefing’ for the Mission and its supporters.\n\nTherefore this will be her last Letter from Kigali in Rwanda, circulated to our 36+ prayer supporters in St.Mary’s.\n\nIf I can help you to continue an ‘interest and prayer link’ with the Africa Inland Mission International, and its crucial evangelistic missionary outreach in Africa, please give me a ring, on 673548. Thank you for your prayerful interest in AIM over these 20 years.\n\nNorman Issberner, 28 April 2019\n\nOff to the Jungle!\n\nThe Easter Holiday Club went really well! It was very well attended with an average of 73 children each day (this includes toddlers). We are so grateful for all of our volunteers who helped the week run so smoothly.\n\nOver the three days we explored (Jungle Theme!) the Easter Story. On Tuesday we looked at Jesus’ life, on Wednesday we looked at Jesus’ death and resurrection and on Thursday we celebrated that Jesus is alive!\n\nIt has been such a wonderful few days where we have seen God so present in all that was going on.\n\nThank you for all your prayers during this week.\n\nWe’re already excited about next year's Easter Holiday Club,\n\ndates yet to be confirmed for our Pirate Adventure!\n\nLauren Puttick, 18 April 2019\n\nA Message from Simon & Sallie Gill\n\nSimon was a curate at St Mary's from 2001 to 2005.\n\n\"We are at last on the move. I've got a new job in 4 villages just north of Cambridge, known as OWLS, (Over, Willingham, Longstanton, Swavesey). We leave Sudbury on 1 May and I am licensed on 19 May.\"\n\nSimon's new role will see him act as team leader of a group of three clergy looking after the four villages.

You just need to chat to him!\n\nHeather Ursell, 12 March 2019\n\nChristmas at the Old Church\n\nA lovely team of ladies have decorated the Old Church so beautifully with holly and fir, dotted with touches of red.\n\nI hope people can find the time to go in and enjoy the sight - a photograph does not do the decorations justice!

When Gad Numadi saw the muddy water-hole which is the source of water for these villages, he felt he had to do something to improve the situation, and the health of the villagers. So our aim is to raise the money for 183 water-filtration units, each costing £30.00.\n\nWe recently held a Curry Night, which brought in an amazing, £632.00, which will enable us to buy 21 units!

She wants to help other people find that sense of release and freedom.\n\nShe and her husband Paul have written a book, Walking on Water, explaining their experience of the difference that Jesus can make.\n\nHeather Ursell - 20 October 2018\n\nThe Jaywick Project\n\nThe Jaywick Project Sale on 1 September raised £377.85!\n\nThank you so much to everyone who gave items, donations, helped at the sale and bought items.\n\nEleanor Young - 9 September 2018\n\nNorry's 100th Birthday\n\nFamily and friends from St Mary's joined Norry Brient at the 9.30 morning service, which she always attends, to sing and listen to some wonderful music which Duncan Archard had organised with the choir in her honour.\n\nMalcolm Bryden congratulated Norry on reaching this special life-landmark and thanked her for all that she had done for the church!\n\nEveryone enjoyed the wonderful refreshments that Cate Wilby and kind helpers had once again created.\n\nNorry, pictured on the left above with her daughter, Heather, and Mary Jordan, who herself has just turned 98!\n\nTricia Hamilton - 2 September 2018\n\nSummer Concerts 2018\n\nWe are most pleased to be able to report that the Summer Concert Series this year raised a total of £1,117.38, shared equally between Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and St Mary's here in Frinton.\n\nMany thanks to all the performers, audience and helpers who made this possible.\n\nDuncan Archard - 1 September 2018\n\nWoW Summer Extra!\n\nThank you to Gerda for another lovely evening on 22 August.

Cate Wilby.\n\nWoW Stour Estuary Walk\n\nA group of happy walkers from St Mary’s followed The Essex Way along the Stour Estuary, stopping at All Saints Church for a warm welcome, tea and a talk on the church from Linda and Trevor Harvey. The sun shone, the sky and water were an incredible blue, the birds sang … a peaceful, joyful afternoon.\n\nLast stop was the Wrabness Community Centre where we were given a superb cream tea. We really should have then walked back!!\n\nTricia Hamilton - 14 July 2018\n\nTwo Points from the PCC\n\n1. We want to say a big thank you to our caretaker, Stewart Atkins, for the large amount and high standard of maintenance he has been doing on the church premises, including roofing and cleaning, as well as varnishing and smartening things up.\n\n2. Next year is designated, Year of Prayer 2019, at St Mary's. There will be a special Lent sermon series from the Rector, different Homegroup study courses including one at the church, a weekend at home and other events and opportunities all on the theme of prayer.\n\nHeather Ursell - 8 July 2018\n\nFrinton Festival - 25 to 28 May\n\nI'm delighted to let you know that the fifth Frinton Festival was a resounding success.\n\nDuncan Archard and I are thrilled with the way that the Frinton Festival Evensong has taken off - a large and enthusiastic choir treated an equally large congregation to a very special service. (See item below.) Before the festival started the Barbican Piano Trio performed to three hundred local primary school children thanks to the generous support of the Cavatina Chamber Music Trust. These concerts were followed by visits from our storyteller Kevin Graal. I am grateful to Jo and Brian Beattie and their team for enticing many of the children and their families to join us for spectacular tea and cakes at St. Mary's after the world premiere of the Remarkable Tale of Prince Unexpected.\n\nThe concerts attracted attentive audiences and we received many glowing responses like the one here: \"Thank you all for a truly magical weekend of superb music: from the delightful surprise on Friday afternoon through to the gleeful performance on Monday evening. Roll on 2019!\"\n\nThe next Frinton Festival will be from the 24-27 May 2019, please pencil those dates in your diaries.\n\nRobert Max - 5 July 2018\n\nWoW Barbecue\n\nWoW ladies … and some gentlemen … enjoyed a delicious BBQ at Matt and Jo's home today.\n\nSitting outside in their lovely garden with fields all around, friends chatted and laughed the evening away. A big thank you to Matt for working so hard with the BBQ tongs and Jo for keeping the kitchen so full of wonderful salads, cakes, drinks, etc ... and to both of them for their warm hospitality!\n\nTricia Hamilton - 9 June 2018\n\nFrinton Festival Evensong at St Mary's\n\nAbout 140 people came to a Choral Evensong at St Mary’s today. It was a beautiful sunny evening.... a celebration as part of Frinton Festival.\n\nDuncan Archard put the service together and rehearsed the choir, with local people joining in. The anthems were Holy, holy, holy from the Deutsche Messe by Schubert (one of this year’s festival composers) and I saw the Lord by Stainer which gave a vivid picture of Isaiah's commissioning. Stainer’s setting evoked in music the wonderment of the Glory of God. Thanks should also go to David Butcher, who so expertly accompanied the choir on the organ.\n\nThe resulting service was totally uplifting; there was a glorious atmosphere, with God’s presence, by his Holy Spirit. The singing was exceptional, professional and powerful. Michael Knell led the service, with Brian Kyriacou giving an impactful talk on a reading from Revelation.\n\nA very big thank you to the choir and to all those who took part ... including Andy and Tony who cheerfully supplied everyone with refreshments.\n\nTricia Hamilton, 27 May 2018\n\nSt Mary's Weekend Away\n\nOn Friday, 18 May around 60 adults and 7 young people headed for Belsey Bridge Conference Centre in Bungay, Norfolk.\n\nThe weekend started with a scrumptious meal, one of many. We then got to meet our speaker Mark Aldridge who works for New Wine. Afterwards the adults turned in quite early, but the young ones with more stamina watched the film The Greatest Showman.\n\nSaturday was a day of further teaching by Mark, he told us many personal stories relating to the Holy Spirit at work in his and other’s lives. On Saturday afternoon the young, Lauren, Sam, and Tricia braved the outdoor pool. There is sadly no picture evidence of Tricia in the pool.\n\nAt 5 o’clock the group split into two with some watching the cup final and others watching the Royal wedding. On Saturday evening great fun was had at a beetle drive.\n\nOn Pentecost Sunday a time was spent with the Holy Spirit and Holy Communion was shared. The young people joined the group and shared what they had learnt about the fruits of the spirit.\n\nSam and Lauren, with the help of Vince and Beth, provided a wonderful weekend for the young people and football was still being played as cars were heading home.\n\nThe weekend was organised wonderfully by Marilyn Smith and Chris Glasby.\n\nStart saving for 2020! - Judy Draper, 22 May 2018\n\nOutreach Guest Dinner\n\nOur Guest Dinner with General The Lord Richard Dannatt, GCB CBE MC DL was held last week on Thursday, 22 March.\n\nIt was a sell-out event with 96 seated guests. It proved extremely successful in every respect, including the fact that we had many friends join us who are not regular church-goers.\n\nOur guest of honour, General The Lord Richard Dannatt, is a former Chief of the General Staff and Head of the British Army. Lord Dannatt’ s after-dinner talk was inspirational and enjoyed by all. He included in his story testimony of his personal journey in the Christian faith. Lord Dannatt’ s parents Anthony and Molly Dannatt were faithful members here at St Mary's Church for many years.\n\nWe can safely say that the dinner itself was of an outstanding quality, with tables waited on by our volunteer hosts who performed their function with great warmth and professionalism. The dinner was definitely one that will be remembered here at St Mary's for many years to come.\n\nRecording available here. - Peter Wood, March 2018\n\nSpanish holiday villa\n\nMargaret Johns, a relatively new member of St Mary's, has a holiday villa available to let in the La Florida district of Southern Spain (see map).\n\nClick here to take a look at some images of her villa, and here for further details of the let.

It is situated in the church garden and will be used by Smallsorts in the summer and children from any local churches and those at the Frinton Mission.\n\nThank you especially to Vince the builder, Cate for her usual high-class tea and Sam for leading the proceedings. A special mention as well to the many who stayed longer to work in the kitchen and clear away - an afternoon of true fellowship.\n\nThanks again. Val Barnes - 2 February 2018\n\nRotary Carol Concert\n\nFrinton-on-Sea Rotary Club held their annual carol concert at St Mary's last Tuesday at 7pm, with approx. 500 people attending. It was a joyous evening with children from Frinton Primary, Walton Primary, St Philomena's and Hamford Primary all contributing carols. Walton Sea Cadets were also in attendance reading the prayers.\n\nThe finale was an excellent rendition of The 12 days of Christmas performed by members of the Rotary Club - with the whole church shouting very loudly when it came to the \"four gold rings\"! (Click here for more images of the concert.)\n\nTricia Hamilton - 7 December 2017\n\nMurder Mystery!\n\nThe cast of the St Mary's Players' Christmas Special Murder Mystery Evening, held on the first Saturday in December in the Church Hall.\n\nThe evening included a splendid buffet supper supplied by Cate Wilby and her helpers.

A great introduction to the Christian faith. Still an ongoing part of our Mission.\n\nOnce again thank you to all of you who helped in any way, and to all of you who prayed so faithfully, our prayers were certainly answered.\n\nCate Wilby.\n\nSuccessful Lunchtime Concert Series\n\nThursday lunchtimes in June and July at St Mary's were filled with wonderful music, ranging from classical piano to more upbeat choral singing. Attendance was up, and the music enjoyed by many. We are blessed to have such a popular series in our church, so if you weren't able to make it this year, maybe next year.\n\nWe raised £1356, half of which was sent to the Essex Air Ambulance, the remainder going to St Mary's funds.\n\nThe next concert in the church will be performed by Stour Choral Society on Saturday, 25 November at 3pm, when they will perform Haydn's Mass in B♭, Britten's Ceremony of Carols and other seasonal pieces, accompanied by harp, piano and organ, and conducted by our own Duncan Archard.\n\nSusan Hare\n\nThe Jaywick Project\n\nIn July we delivered 50 food parcels to Jaywick, 25 for the elderly and 25 for families and children to help with the gap left by missing out on food at school.\n\nThank you to everyone who helps this project with food and money donations over the year.

In spite of a thunderstorm, when rain stopped play and we sheltered in the church, the huge task was completed in under six hours.\n\nA big thank you to everyone who worked so hard on a very hot day.\n\nWoW visit to Beth Chatto Gardens\n\nWhat a glorious day it was for WoW ladies and friends to visit Beth Chatto on Thursday, 25 May! The weather couldn't have been more perfect to appreciate the beauty of the plants and the perfection of the layout of the gardens. With 25 in our group, we could wander individually or with others, meeting and separating in a gentle, interesting way, as we strolled around the flowerbeds and ponds, beneath the many shady trees.\n\nWe started with a short explanation from one of the staff, of how Beth and family had gradually brought life and order to the large, empty, boggy field around their home. They created areas ranging from the un-watered 'gravel garden' through to the water garden, all designed with the Chattos' adage in mind, The right plant for the right place.\n\nTo bring the afternoon to a tasty close, we relaxed together over a special strawberry tea in the tearooms.\n\nThanks toTricia for arranging this lovely outing!\n\nFACT United Communion Service\n\nMaundy Thursday\n\nThe annual coming together of many members of Frinton Area Churches Together (FACT) for a communion service on Maundy Thursday, was held in our church this year. Significantly, it takes place at the start of the Easter weekend, which encapsulates so much of our shared faith and beliefs.\n\nDuring the service, Emily Rowland was invited to explain 'Light up the Night', the project for secondary school age young people, being headed up by herself and her church, Coastlands, in June this year. Most FACT churches are contributing towards this, both financially and prayerfully. For two days an experienced and professional team of Christians will take music and science-based lessons at TTC, our local secondary school, then hold an exciting evening of entertainment at the Columbine Centre on 24 June. One of the main aims is to offer the Christian point of view to people who might otherwise only hear the world-view that science and God don't mix.\n\nRepresentatives from every FACT church helped serve communion to well over a hundred people, and FACT Chairman, Rev Graham Dallisson, preached on following the example of Jesus in serving each other.\n\nWe thank God for the meaningful friendships there are in our area, across all the local churches.\n\nHeather Ursell - 14 April\n\nEaster Holiday Club\n\nThanks to all those who have been praying for the Easter Holiday Club in the week leading up to Easter Sunday.\n\nIt was a great week with lots of fun as we celebrated together!\n\nBetween 30 and 40 youngsters attended each day!\n\nSam Puttick - 13 April\n\nNew Building Project\n\nA big THANK YOU to the team who worked very hard in the rain taking down the old shed and putting together a new one... all in one day!\n\nThank you to Ian, Malcolm, Don, John, David H, Brian, David D, Mike and Michael - very good job!\n\nSam Puttick - 8 March\n\nLife EXPO\n\nThe Life Exhibition was a great success with all the Schools that attended. We had about 300 children through the week and a good number from the churches of FACT on the evenings we ran.\n\nOne of the local teachers said that it really highlighted the lack of teaching on the Bible and that they needed to address this issue within the school. There was lots of complimentary comments from children during the week. One child after watching the finishing Video about the Death, Burial and Resurrection of Jesus commented \"I'm sad, because Jesus died. But I'm also happy, because he died for me\".\n\nSam Puttick\n\nSponsored Skydive\n\nA big thank you to everyone who has supported my sponsored skydive down in Australia, raising funds for our daughter's Christian Dance Ministry.

In more recent months we have been encouraged by the number of folk coming on Sunday and throughout the week. This has been the fruit of door to door visiting, schools work and gospel outreach. The toys are a powerful testimony that compliments the message of the gospel in a practical way. Those who received the presents are from a diverse multi-cultural background and struggle to make ends meet. Thank you.\n\nTerry Puttick, representative from London City Mission, who spoke at our Toy Service.\n\nJaywick Project - Christmas 2016\n\nIn December 25 food parcels were delivered for the elderly and 25 for families and children in Jaywick.

Our next delivery will be in April so thank you in advance for any donations you are able to make towards this.\n\nThank you also very much to Brian Allen for his ongoing help with managing the goods in my absence.\n\nEleanor Young\n\nOperation Christmas Child - 2016\n\nThe Christmas Shoebox Appeal is underway again.\n\nThis brings God's message of hope to disadvantaged and needy children in parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia through gift-filled shoeboxes. Leaflets giving detailed information are available from the back of the church and the Lounge.\n\nGO boxes, which are ready-made,\n\nare available to buy from Reception at 50p.\n\nAll boxes should please be back at church by\n\nSunday, 13 November.\n\nThat’s the last Sunday!\n\nAbsolute cut-off - NOON Thursday, 17 November.\n\nThanks for your ongoing support. Helen Whybrew.\n\nG ift Month 2016\n\nThis year, October was our Gift Month and the focus was on helping to make the employment of a Children's and Families' Worker sustainable, for many years to come. We are thrilled to have Sam Puttick in that role now, and are very pleased with the different community contacts he is building, and the opportunities he is taking to work with children and young people of all ages. His heart is to share the love of Jesus with as many children and adults as possible; we recognise and want to help develop his ability to do that.\n\nThe Rector encouraged giving in any of three ways:\n\n1. Increasing regular giving (maybe using the 'Parish Giving Scheme' packs available from reception or the back of church)\n\n2. Donating a specific gift to contribute to Sam's employment (cheque or cash in a labelled envelope in the carboy at the back of the church, or via reception)\n\n3. Donating a lump sum to general church funds (as above).\n\nAmount raised - £12,371!\n\n(including the gift aid to be claimed)\n\nwhich exceeds our £12,000 target\n\nDo please speak to John Moyse, a Churchwarden\n\nor the Church Secretary if you would like to contribute even now.\n\nToy Loan\n\nWe've been overwhelmed by the response to our request for toys while Rachel and family are staying. I guess we should have expected no less, but the love and generosity that those offers show comes from the Lord via many. So heartfelt thanks to all you kind Church Family members - but no more please!\n\nLove & blessings, Judy & Andrew\n\nHarvest 2016\n\nDon the Rector was his normal laid-back self with the ability to put us all at ease very gently throughout the service. His message can be heard again on the church website. Pat Philbrick and her team had done a wonderful job of decorating St Mary's (see images here).\n\nA full house of people from all of the Sunday services gathered after the service for a celebratory Harvest Lunch. There was a good mix of old and new Christians and also a few from other parishes - Southend even! That's what I call an 'outreach'.\n\nNot sure of the total number who actually attended but there was no shortage of food and no shortage of conversation. We were joined at our table by Mrs Smith, Karen to everyone, and there was never a pause in the conversation. She finally ended up pinching my Branston pickle!\n\nA huge round of applause to the organisers of the function who advertised, managed and even waited on tables. I have to admit that when I hear the name of Cate Wilby mentioned at any function, then I am the first to add my name to the list of attendees - Mary Berry could learn a few things from our Cate. WOW!\n\nClay Evans - September 2016\n\nJaywick Project\n\nThank you to everyone for their donations of food and money for Jaywick. We delivered 20 food parcels for use during the summer holidays. I also received a letter thanking us for the cheque for £1,100 for the pantomime to be held at Christmas.\n\nThank you to Duncan and all concert goers for their support at this year’s concerts.\n\nOur next food delivery will be in December for both elderly and young families.\n\nThanks for your ongoing support. Eleanor Young.\n\nWhat the Dickens...?\n\nTony Rees’ talk supporting the recent performance of the musical Oliver! in the FM Marquee is available to listen to or download via this link.\n\nThe audio recordings webpage offers this and other talks going back to 2012.\n\nPlease get in touch with the Church Office, if you would like further information.\n\n90th Birthday of HM The Queen\n\nWe enjoyed a wonderful Service of Celebration at St Mary's this morning to mark Her Majesty's 90th Birthday.\n\nInvitation cards had been sent to every home in Frinton. The church was packed out with over 300 people attending, and we had a brilliant service (including a very challenging sermon from our Rector, Don - click here). St Philomena's School Choir sang for us - all in all, brilliant!\n\nChampagne and canapés were on offer in St Mary's Memorial Garden afterwards. What a fantastic team effort to put on such a splendid occasion.\n\nDownload the Order of Service here!\n\nSt Mary's Away Weekend 2016\n\n62 people attended the weekend and everyone enjoyed a time of happy fellowship. Our speaker, Peter Cockrell, was very interesting and challenged our understanding of where we were in Christ and what a Christian is.\n\nHe left us with lots of questions!\n\nNew Church Seating\n\nA change in the seating in the nave - officially called 'Re-ordering the Church' - was planned for April.\n\nWe received permission ['The Faculty'] from the Diocese of Chelmsford to carry out this re-ordering. New chairs have been installed in the nave of the church, with pews being moved to the sides. The new chairs resemble the chairs already in use at the west end of the building.\n\nA number of the pews have family memorials engraved at their ends. All these memorials have been retained and if you have knowledge of any of the church pews' history or you know of families who no longer attend St Mary's who might have such links to these pews, please contact Heather Ursell (Secretary) or Peter Wood (Churchwarden).\n\nSeveral of the old pews are redundant and we have permission within the faculty to sell them off. Anyone interested in buying one (or more) please contact Heather or Peter.\n\nAntiques Roadshow - 19 March\n\nIn liaison with Reeman Dansie, Auctioneers and Valuers of Colchester, we held our first Antiques Roadshow. The valuers were kept busy throughout and a section of the hall was laid aside as a café with hot drinks and very tasty, beautifully made cake available ~ spoken by a real expert on the subject!\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised by the number of visitors, many of whom had come from the Clacton area as a result of the good publicity. Numerous conversations were had with folks who wouldn’t normally visit the Church so it all added up to a very worthwhile event.\n\nThe Roadshow made a total of £330 from the refreshments served and the donations from those people who had a valuation carried out. We plan to have another similar event, certainly within the next year.\n\nWell done indeed to everyone involved. - Karen Hepworth and Peter Wood.\n\nWow Chinese Meal\n\nA number of Women of Worth ladies met at the Jade Restaurant in Connaught Avenue on Tuesday, 1 March.\n\nThe food was fabulous, the company was enjoyable and the fellowship a blessing. This was a great opportunity for making new friendships.\n\nThe only downside was not being able to talk to everyone at the long table!\n\nSarah Coy\n\nStamp News\n\nHow your stamps are changing lives! There is good news that in 2015 another marvellous total of £136,000 was raised\n\nduring the year. So please continue saving your used stamps\n\nand giving them to Jean Clift.\n\nMany thanks, Jean!\n\nNew Appointment\n\nI am delighted to announce that Samuel Puttick, at present working for a Christian Adventure Centre in Scotland, will be joining St Mary’s as our new Children's and Families' Worker on the 21 March.\n\nSam and his wife Lauren, who is expecting their first baby in June, are now living locally. Please pray for them as settle in to their new life in Frinton.\n\nDon Smith, Rector\n\nNathan Edgell\n\nNathan is currently attached to YWAM in South-east Asia, but he was home in Frinton for Christmas!\n\nOn Monday, 11 January there was a special evening to come along and hear from him in words, pictures and music at 7.30pm here at St Mary's."
