The latest ONS statistics show 29.3% of deaths of care home residents in England between 2nd March and 12th June 2020 involved COVID-19.\n\nIn a recent survey by the Live-in Care Hub (2021), those organisations polled provided live-in care for 2,926 elderly people. During the first wave of the 2020 pandemic, only 10 elderly people tested positive for COVID-19 and only 10 live-in carers tested positive – and these cases are not directly related. Illustrating how live-in care can manage infection control more closely.\n\nBenefits of live-in care vs a care home\n\nOne-to-one care and support around the clock with live-in care.\n\nA highly personalised care plan designed to meet your care needs whilst addressing how you wish to live your life with none of the rigid timetables experienced in a care home.\n\nSpecialist care of complex conditions provided by highly trained carers delivered in the comfort of your own home.\n\nStaying at home means you can keep control of your life, with all your treasured memories and possessions around you.\n\nConsiderable and proven benefits to overall health and wellbeing, with much needed peace of mind and reassurance for family members.\n\nThe cost of care is comparable to that of a care home and considerably cheaper for couples, who would be charged double in a care home.\n\nCouples can stay together as a loving couple, as opposed to being split up to be cared for in different areas of a care home.\n\nContinuing to be part of the local community you have loved.\n\nThe support our live-in carers provide in\n\nCompanionship care\n\nAt The Good Care Group, we have been enabling people in to live a fulfilled and purposeful life in the comfort of their own home for over 10 years. Our live-in companionship care service means you can live well with the right level of care and support in your own home. A dedicated companion can really spend time getting to know you and how you wish to live your life – then offer the one-to-one company, care and support you need. This approach simply cannot be achieved in even the very best care home where carers are sharing their time between several residents.\n\nOur carers can help you enjoy the local outdoor activities and amenities in and around including:\n\nTrips to the local National Trust sites such as Rayleigh Mount\n\nLocal community organisations\n\nHelp you take part in the local sports clubs like the local tennis club\n\nOur professional carers will also be able to assist you with appointments at all the local hospitals including;\n\nClacton & District Hospital\n\nIvy Benson House Clacton Hospital\n\nAnd local pharmacies including and not restricted to;\n\nM & M Pharmacy Pharmacy\n\nDay Lewis Pharmacy\n\nBoots Pharmacy\n\nPersonal care\n\nWhat is personal care?\n\nPersonal care in the home is a very broad term used to describe a number of different areas of care and support a carer will provide, and includes:\n\nBathing and showering\n\nDressing and getting ready for bed\n\nFoot care\n\nHair and beauty\n\nOral hygiene\n\nApplying creams and lotions\n\nToileting\n\nBed positioning\n\nClinical personal care ​​​​​​\n\nAdditionally our carers can provide support in your home, including help with domestic tasks, monitoring and management of medications, compassionate companionship and meal planning and cooking.\n\nComplex care\n\nThe NHS is the primary provider of complex healthcare services in . Whilst much of this care is provided in hospital, services are also provided in other ways:\n\nIn the person’s own home, where the NHS will either provide or fund a third-party partner or organisation to provide care services based on an assessment of needs.\n\nIn a nursing home, where the individual is cared for in either a local authority funded home or a privately run nursing home.\n\nIn a third-party partner’s facility where care is paid for by the NHS.\n\nWhat conditions can our complex care at home support?\n\nOur live-in care service for those requiring complex care is provided on a one-to-one basis resulting in a high quality, compassionate service that ensures an individual is able to live a fulfilling life and maintain their lifestyle choices, despite the limitations of their medical condition.\n\nThe complex conditions we care for includes, but is not limited to:\n\nDegenerative conditions – like dementia, Parkinson’s disease and Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n\nCancer care\n\nStroke care\n\nPalliative care (end-of-life care)\n\nPost-operative health care\n\nRespiratory conditions – like COPD\n\nCongenital disease\n\nGeneral frailty\n\nWhy choose The Good Care Group for care in\n\nOutstanding local carers\n\nRigorous recruitment process - only 2% of carers who apply are successful\n\nEmployed carers - staff are paid well, supported and rewarded for loyalty and performance\n\nUnrivalled training programme - far exceeding statutory requirements\n\nOn-going training and professional development - reflects best practice so carers have the knowledge and skills to give high quality care\n\nNo agency staff\n\nUnrivalled specialist expertise\n\nUnrivalled expertise in medical conditions\n\nHolistic approach - person-centred and encompassing medical, emotional and social needs\n\nResponsive care - consistent monitoring and management of conditions to meet changing needs\n\nBest practice - drawing on expertise from leading health and social care professionals\n\nCarer continuity through dedicated teams\n\nCarer support - experienced care managers work with our carers so they work to the best of their abilities\n\nIn-depth knowledge - dedicated carers and experienced managers work closely to understand highly personal conditions and care needs\n\nEffective rotas - we consider our carers wellbeing so they stay with us for longer and provide better quality care\n\nFully managed services and 24/7 support\n\nFully managed service\n\nDomestic responsibility taken care of\n\nClose contact and support from your regional care teams\n\n24/7 access to advice and experts\n\nFree educational events and support programmes\n\nAward winning & assured quality\n\nAward-winning care - we’re proud to have received more prestigious awards from our industry than any other homecare provider\n\nEmployed carers - using agency staff or those who are self-employed means care quality is not controlled\n\nRegulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) - we are held legally accountable for our service and have achieved the highest outcomes in our CQC inspections\n\nContinual control and monitoring - we are able to evaluate any concerns on an on-going basis to ensure the most appropriate level of care is provided at any time\n\nUnique advisory board - made up of leading health and social care professionals who advise us on delivering best practice, quality home care\n\nLive-in care costs & paying for care\n\n24-hour live-in care costs are typically in line with a care home and sometimes less. The cost of a care home can vary significantly depending on the standards of care. If nursing care, specialist care of conditions or for those requiring stroke, cancer or palliative care, then the weekly fee can be considerably higher. When considering a care home, it is important to ask them what is included in the weekly fee as there are generally optional extras which can add up over the course of a year.\n\nThe weekly cost of receiving quality, award-winning care in a care home can range from £1,600 to £2,000 per week, depending on the level of care provided and the room you choose.\n\nThe cost of live-in care for couples\n\nLive-in care for couples is fast becoming the preferred choice when one or both of you require long term care instead of moving into a care home. If you both have different needs you could find yourselves being split up within the home, which many will find very distressing. With live-in care there is one inclusive weekly fee for providing care at the same address, with a nominal charge to provide couples care. In a care home costs can be double for two separate packages of care and accommodation, making the choice to move into a care home not as cost effective for couples.\n\nIf you require further advice about funding care please contact SOLLA, who will be able to assist you.\n\nLocal care management & teams in\n\nOur approach to live-in care in ensures you have a dedicated regional care manager who is accountable for the service we provide, with a dedicated care manager who will be available to you and your family, on a day to day basis to ensure the live-in care we provide is to the very highest standards.\n\nMeet Kerri-Anne Jones\n\nRegional Operations Manager, Essex\n\nAfter volunteering in a care home, I quickly realised how much I enjoyed caring and supporting elderly people.
