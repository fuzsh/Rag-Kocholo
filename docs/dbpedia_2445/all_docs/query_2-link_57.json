        "text": "Help! I'm new...\n\nUnsure? Anxious? Worried about saying or doing the wrong thing?\n\nWe understand that coming along to a new place for the first time can be a daunting prospect. Here at Homelands, we do everything that we can to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. On this page we hope that you find relevant information that will help you if you are thinking of coming along on a Sunday or at another time.\n\nWhat time do the services start?\n\nThe Sunday morning service begins at 11am and usually finishes at around 12 noon. We then offer a chance to connect with one another over a nice drink. We serve free teas and fresh-brewed coffees and biscuits.\n\nWhere is Homelands?\n\nThe church buildings are on Garden Road in Walton on the Naze - just opposite the Triangle shopping centre car park (which is actually in Frinton on Sea!). Our address is Homelands Free Church; Garden Road; Walton on the Naze; CO14 8SJ.\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nWe want you to feel really relaxed when you come here so wear whatever you feel most comfortable in. Most people who attend are usually dressed in a casual manner. However, if you would like to wear your new suit or dress, you are totally welcome.\n\nWhere can I park?\n\nThere is some free parking on site next to the church, or we have permission for those attending Sunday services to park in the Triangle shopping centre car park just across Garden Road.\n\nWhat should I expect?\n\nAs you enter the building, you will be met by one of our volunteers who will give you a great welcome, and hopefully hand you a copy of our weekly news sheet which will tell you about a number of the different things taking place here.\n\nDuring the service please sit anywhere you feel comfortable. Feel free to join in or not as you want to. There will be singing, with words for songs or anything else you need on the screens (so no need to worry about hymn books or finding your place in a service book). There will also be an inspiring and relevant talk given from the Bible, and times of prayer. Each week, we take up an offering for those who wish to give financially to support the work of the church.\n\nI have specific needs - will I be OK?\n\nWe have a loop system for those with hearing difficulties. The entire building has level access so we already have many folk attending with additional mobility needs or who use wheelchairs. If you have a specific need, do let one of the welcome team know and they will make sure we do everything we can to help.\n\nI still have questions or am unsure?"
