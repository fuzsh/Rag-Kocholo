We hope you will look further at our website, and perhaps explore the websites of our related groups based in Brightlingsea, Frinton & Walton and Harwich Peninsular .\n\nWe have an enthusiastic and friendly membership of over 200. Our study groups are varied and new groups will be formed as interest is shown and members are forthcoming who are prepared to act as group co-ordinators.\n\nFounded in 1982, u3a is a world wide movement of locally-run interest groups that provide a wide range of opportunities to come together to learn for fun. Members explore new ideas, skills and activities together.\n\nThere are 1,057 u3as with nearly 400,000 members; membership costs less than £20 on average per year and is open to everyone who’s not working full-time.\n\nu3a has members who draw upon their knowledge and experience to teach and learn from each other but there are no qualifications to pass – it is just for pleasure. Learning is its own reward.\n\nIt's all voluntary; a typical u3a will be home to many activity groups covering many different subjects - from art to walking and everything in between.\n\nFor All Enquiries please see the Contact page\n\nYOUR TENDRING DISTRICT U3A COMMITTEE\n\nKeith Lamdin Chairman & Group Co-ordinator.\n\nPaul Bryant Vice Chair + Membership Sec\n\nEileen Kelly Treasurer.\n\nMargaret Lamdin Secretary.\n\nWendy Lockyear\n\nSusan Taylor\n\nThomas Craig\n\nOFF COMMITTEE\n\nHolland Public Hall.
