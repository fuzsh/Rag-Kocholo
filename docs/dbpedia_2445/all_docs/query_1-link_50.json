EDITED BY VERE LANGFORD OLIVER, M.R.C.S., &c. MEMBER OP THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY. CORBESPONDING MEMBER OF THE NEW ENGLAND HISTORIC GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY. VOLUME III. LONDON|: MITCHELL HUG-HES AND CLARKE, 1W WARD OUR STREET, W. 1914. PREFACE. THIRD Volume having been completed, I take this opportunity of again conveying my thanks to all supporters, and especially to those who have contributed articles. .1 may mention more particularly Mr. F. Cundall, Mrs. B. F. Scar- lett, Miss M. Nembhard, Rev. Dr. L. B. Thomas, Mr. J. Bromlev, Mr. N. Darnell Davis, and Mr. E. G. Sinckler. The Supplement of Book-plates was also largely due to that indefati- gable collector Mr. F. Cattle. The Lists of early settlers and of testators have been of much use to a wide circle of readers ; the M.I. of West Indians in this country have been the means of rescuing from oblivion the names of past worthies ; and the pedigrees have often served to again bring into touch forgotten relatives. A visit of six months' duration to the Islands last winter enabled me to investigate the local records and to collect a mass of notes, some of which will be embodied in a separate volume dealing with the M.I. of Barbados and the Leeward Islands In the coming year a List of Wills recorded in Barbados will appear, and the Parish Register of St. Thomas, Middle Island, St. Kitts, will fill the Supplement.

Jamaica: Qcscnptton of tlje principal persons rijere, (ABOUT 1720, SIR NICH* LA WES, GOVERNOR.) The following interestiu^ letter has been transcribed by Mr. N. Darnell Davis from the Records at Pulham Palace. It was written to the Bishop of London by the Rev. Win. May, Rector of Kingston, whose will see in Vol. I., p. 261 : — My Lord, This may serve in some measure to make an estimate of this people from the other Relations. There is not six families who are well descended as gentlemen on the whole Island. The original character Your Lordship has in Sir Rich'1 Baker's Chronicle & Pat rem sequitcr sua proles. And as for those Englishmen that canie as mechanics hither, very young, and have now acquired good Estates iu Sugar Plantations and Indigo, &cf, of course they know no better than what maxims they learn in the Country. To be now short & plain, Your Lordship will see that they have no maxims of Church or State but what are absolutely anarchical. There is a mystery I'm sure which yourself, My Lord, & our ministers are puzzled to unfold, to see the printed Votes, scolding like Billingsgates, as if our Governor and Council were on the right side, that is to say, ready for the true maxims of our Constitution, and the Assembly, assuming more than our House of Commons pretend. I doubt not but your estated Creoliaus tell you that tin's is only the effect of the two Parties, Whiirgs and Torys as we have at home, and that the G>i\\r & Council moderate between th in by the right maxims of our Constitution. But, Your Lp. cannot but see how .t would be to kick against tho pricks, to attempt to have not only a single Act of Parliament, but a Cumulative Law (of which my Lawyer, sub rosa, assures me, there are no less than 25, all relating to one another) put in execution, though the fact is notorious. • Nothing is known about him. 6 CARIBBEANA. Accordingly, any pragmatic fellow; an Officer or Justice, when he thinks fit, will go out of our churches b /fore sermon is ended, to disturb our Congregation, contrary to the same statute, tho' the Penalty for the Laymen is, for the first fault 65 pounds sterling. This can be no wonder if Your Lp. consider that our estated men now are all like Jonah's gourd, and novi homines. The Governor* himself was Apprentice to one Rabey in Spanish Town, who sold locks, & nails, pots, fryiug-pans, bills, axes, hinges, hammers, &c, and, there are people alive now, who remember that he went barefooted, & bare leg'd, with Bhoos on, as was the custom for most young shop-keepers & planters in those dayes. The famous Peter Beckfordf his Father came with 2 or 3 Negroes on the Island, a small time after it was taken. &, being a hunter, he & his Negroes catch'd horses and sold them again, for some years, by which he made a beginning of his fortune here. The great Colonel Gale+ his father waa a horse-catcher, for all his prodigious Estate, and he is nevertheless as illiterate as Ids Father was. When the Spaniards were driven out of the Island, they left great flocks of cattle, sheep, & horses, which they had lodged in the woods when the Invasion began. This afforded an occasion to a good many of those, who are now prouder than our Dukes & Marquesses, to so make a Livelihood of, & to lay the foundation of the Estates they now enjoy. There are three Creolians in Eugland who have had English Education, & make a figure at London with their Estates in this country: Mr Langley, M* Low, & Mr Daw kins. The Fathers of two of them were hut mean men. Mr Dawkins'§ Father was an overseer here first. The Father of ~$lr Lowj| (called Colonel Low) was, as I have heard, some of such imployment as a Porter in Leadenhall Street, but he set up here as a Surgeon. M' Langley's^[ Father was a Turkey Merchant who had misfortunes in his business, but came over here with a considerable stock, was a man of good education, a good man & man of honour. In our Council now, I shall shew you that tho\" they be all estated men, & of the greatest, yet are they all of the same original. Mr Bernard's F.ither was a man of Education, and had some creditable beginning. The two Moores' Father was au illiterate, poor, but honest man. who came hither from Barbadoes, & began * Governor Sir Nicholas Lawes wrote in his will in 1730 that lie was \" born in 165[2]* of honest & loyal parents who suffered for their loyalty to the [loyal Family in the late Grand Rebellion.'' His mother brought liim to Jamaici in H163, and he resided there fifty -four years. His family appears to hsve been settled in ^r near Conipton Chamberlain, co.

These two Brothers, John and Samuel,* Councillors, have been some small time at Oxford University, are Masters in Musick, well bred, and have a competent smack of the belles lettres. They are very civil to clergymen, & all men, & have morals enough which would have qualified them for the highest character of Gentlemen in the -Augustan Age of Borne. But, as to their Christian Religion, no man here can say what they are, for they don't hardly come to church at all. Samuel lias been in his Parish Church but once in five years. They outwardly, with l)r Hoy, profess to be strenuous for Mr Winston's new Vampt Arrian principles, while they carress the formerly mentioned Mr Fry, & have now taken him home to the house of Samuel, for a constant companion, if not for something else. But, they are rigid for the anarchical principles of the country. John goes now for England. & i know, has sense enough to hide these matters when there, ct deny them if asked about them; and, so will they all, except wheu the country men get together, for certainly, no noble Englishman can be more zealous for our excellent constitution than they are for the present condition of this unhappy Island. lie called Colonel Kosef is a cooper by trade, and wrought with his apron for dayly hire since he came here. He is no immoral man, but you may imagine whether fitted to be a tool to the others who are men of parts, such as the two Moores, & Mr Bernard who is a Lawyer. Tnis man appears to be for the true maxims of our English Constitution, if you'll judge, my Lord, by the Governor's speeches, & the Council s proceedings with the Assembly. Tor all these discourses and arguments are his composition; and yet, for all this, he is as much for the anarchical principles of the country, when out of the Council, as Peter Beckford, who wears no mask, and is the God of the Crioiians; for, he is equal in parts and learning to Mr Bernard, & having so many sugar-works & vast territories in Land, the country Natives believe that for the good of ids children, 'tis impossible for hiin to do anything but what is ttie true interest of the country. And no meu are greater thau they. And, as for the Chief Justice, who is the second man in Peter's Party, Mr Bernard and he are hand & glove. Another of our Councillors is called Colonel Gouiersel,+ bred a Factor here, is a fair moral man. His Father was a waterman who plyed between Passage Fort and Kingstone Village, &c. Ho called Colonel Archpold,§ the Councillor, his Father was a mean man, after the taking of the [sland, but a small Planter, and relations (?) to the neighbours who came to settle after him, to whom Colonel D'Oyly (then Governor) used to give many a dram of Ids bottle, which was a good lusty cane he luiployed upon complaints made. He was wont to send for him in a morning and hear both parties, and then called for his Dram Bottle to treat him with. He and his brother Henry are civil, well-bred men, but no one can tell their Keligion. There are many more great estated men on the Island, but these, excepting one or two more, are the men who have a Notion of our Constitution, and who have found out the way to blind you at home with these sham-fights, & in all probability will continue to govern the Island, and hand down their anarchical principles to their Posterity ; for, it is no matter whether the Hamiltonians (so called), or the Beckfordians be at the uppermost spoke of the wheel, these principles will and must continue, unless God should bless our Ministry to take some pains to be informed of these matters. * John Moore, sou of Joh. of Newingtoil Green, .Mi ld., gei.it. , Wadham Coll., matriculated 13 May 1700. a-ed 19.

Now, whether it may not be destructive to our State to have a generation of subjects bred up so. who have great Estates, and will come over all, or most of them, in times, to live with us, do poyson Englishmen in their principles. This consideration is of much more importance, when your Lordship shall be farther informed of another stratagem for these ends which they have got, which is this. The only Act of this Island for bringing over \"White Men. whom they are sensible of themselves, to be the only defence of the country, is that called the Deficiency Act: viz. Every planter for ±0 Negroes which he has shall procure from England one white man, i.e., a Britton or Irishman, or pay £13 10s. per an., which is termed Deficiency .Money. They scarcely brim; any in respect of what they might do (but pay the Deficiency constantly). If Your Lordship considers that it is a certain truth, which 1 can demonstrate; and the late Secretary of the Island, M* Wood, an Englishman, in his Essayes about Trade, and the improve- ment of this Island, has asserted that there are- not on the Island of White persons capable in any manner of bearing Arms, reckoning (according to the vulgar saying) rag, tag. and bobtail, 2500. Now, what is this number to govern at least 90,000 or 100,000 Negroes. It is manifest that the Spaniards, \"ur Neighbours, when they, by Providence, turn'd their Arms of two Expeditions, at one time one against Pensicola, and 'tother against Providence, ha i they united them ami made the descent on us, we must have been a sacrifice, and an easy prey to them. Next, if one half of this noble Island is certainly uninhabited, & may be hundreds of years unman u red upon the present maxims, this deserves serious consideration of our Ministry. The Government at present is anarchical, but nearest to any form id' Aristocracy. And this seems to be the principal aim of all our great estated men now, to turn it into an Aristocracy in time, and make use of the mentioned signs for this purpose. Tho' some of the Councillors do make occasional conformity for once in com- municating with the church, hut never more, others never. Mr Pennant's* Father had some beginning that was creditable, but left but an ordinary Estate behind him. Now. the son having got the escheat of Cupos the Dutchman, as is related in tin1 pamphlet The Groans of Jamaica, is become a Councillor, & a vehement Propagator of the country principles, Winston's, and Erastianism. John Morant/f mentioned Councillor, was brought up a shoemaWr, is a moral man. Preteuded to be of the Church, but vehement for the country principles ; therefore variable, and a lit tool to these mentioned before, for any new emergency, to pull down the Church. &c. There is our Chief Justice: no man can tell his Religion. He has never qualified himself (& he has held it since my Lord Hamilton's time) by the Act of Parliament. He has risen from a very mean beginning, though himself and brothers have great Estates. Colonel Key wood ,§ lately Governor. Mammon is his God, & vehement for the present corrupt principles; and, his son, Jemmy, another colonel, and most wicked debauchee, his Heir. Mr Beckford's Brother. Toui,|j Colonel too, is a Lihertiue, & of the country principles, & has a great Estate. He has kille 1 his man, and so has his Brother Peter, but this makes neither a bit more Religious. He was a Councillor in Colonel Heywood's time. & his graceless son was Governor of ye Port at Port Royal, a post worth .\">i>0 at least (Libs.) per aim. And so these Estated men govern the Island at tins rate. Their brothers, sons, &c, let them be never so • Cai-t. Giffard Pennant of Clarendon had a -rant of land 1663, and died 1077, leaving a son Edward, Chief Justice 17o7, M. of Council 1725, who died 1736, a?cd D4. f Johu Murml. the first settler, die 1 lfiSit.

CARIBBEAN A. 9 worthless, are put into all the honl,lc & profitable posts; and, let either My Lord Hamilton's Party, as they are called (tor ;i cloak), or Mr Beckford's, have the Council, this is the disposition of the body politick. There is another Councillor still: one JNL Gregory.* a man of some'educatiou and parts, but a Libertine, & of ye country principles, tho' by the Minutes of the Assembly, in England you would be apt to think hnn stanch for our Constitution. His Parents had an obscure beginning here also. . And, as for the kite Colonel Peak,f his Father taught poor boyes here at first, as a Schoolmaster; and, when K. James was on the Throne, & the Duke of Albemarle was sent over with Father Churchill, to pervert the country by force, if uot by fair means, this good prebendal Church of England schoolmaster publicly gave God thanks that he had lived to see the tiuie that he durst own his .Religion, which was the Popish. Next, there is now another Councillor, Colonel Sadler, a man bred a factor, and has had some education. Is a man well bred, perfectly civil, of parts. His Father was another schoolmaster, & a known Papist too. He is an occasional conformist, but, both he and the late M1 Peak (wiio has left a good Estate) is rigid for the present state of the country principles. Our Council, viz., His Matte's at bontc, have thought fit hitherto to grant License to every Planter to run as much laud as he thinks he may be able in his life time to manure, & in the mean time to pay one halfpenny pr acre pr an., which is termed quit Rents. Put the end of tins is quite perverted. And all the great Sugar- Planting men mentiuned, & others hove run out ten times as much land as now they are able to manure (paying quit rents). Some have runout 40,000 and 50,000 acres of land, as Peter Beckford and Colonel Gale. Some 15,000, some 10,000, some S000, some 7000, besides what, with their utmost ability they are able to manure. Must the King's good subjects at home, who are as capable to begin plantations, as their Fathers, and themselves were, be excluded from their Liberty of settling Plantations in this noble Island, for ever, A the King and Nation at home be deprived of so much riches, to make a few upstart Gentlemen Princes? The remainder of the Land which they have run out is every whit as good as what is already planted. And could these present Planters be ever capable to cultivate one 0\"1 or 7 '', or 10U| of what they pay quit- rents for, they will have much greater Estates then our greatest Dukes at home; and this Aristocracy, and this accession to our Nobility they must necessarily have at heart. This must be the grand project of our Creoliau Politicians, if we may judge of men by their adious. Every Englishman who is not one of them in interest, feels tiieir exorbitances often; which made the late learned M' Barrow, the Lawyer, often say that this People, innuendo the Jamaicans, ought to be governed with a rod as we do children. Ami to corroborate their interest & grand project, they have incorporated two Law vers, men of parts, among them, by marrying them to Sugar Works: Mr Kelby and Mr Meiling. These are the present circumstances of the Island. & the test of all Englishmen who are Lovers of our Constitution. Your Lordship's assistance, which has been so advantageous to our Nation, may, by God's Blessing contribute much to change those for the better, which is the hearty prayer of, My Lli, Your Lp.'s most humble Servant. N.B.— One 10th of the Island is not manured; at least of the good land, besides Woods, and Mountains. N.B. — All the Planters in the Country are Colonels, Majors, and Capts., for all new Governors turu out whom they please, & makers others; and so our * Son of M;it bow Gregory, Speaker 1704-6, who died 1715; SL of Council 1726, President 1755, and died about 176-4. t See Areber, p. 2(5, for arms of Peake impaled by Tho.
