        "text": "Around Frinton-on-Sea\n\nFrinton-on-Sea: A charming seaside town\n\nSituated between Harwich and Clacton-on-Sea in the east of Essex, Frinton-on-Sea is a delightful seaside town offering a wealth of amenities and a real community feel that make it a perfect place to purchase a new build home.\n\nThe town’s high street offers traditional amenities including a bakery, butchers, fishmongers, and greengrocers, meaning you can support the local economy while eating well. The seafront is lined with colourful Victorian-style beach huts – a nod to the locale’s heyday as a seaside retreat for Londoners wanting a breath of fresh air from hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nWell-rated schools for all ages can be found close by our new build Finches Park homes in Frinton-on-Sea too, so, whether you’re a growing family, commuter or even looking to downsize, this really is a wonderful place to call home.\n\nWhat’s close to Frinton-on-Sea?\n\nThere’s plenty to do in the area. Walton-on-the-Naze is a small town with a fascinating history located just over two miles from our collection of homes for sale in Frinton-on-Sea.\n\nHere, you will find some wonderful walks and nature reserves to explore. The Naze, as well as being a natural open space, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and famed for the fossils found in the Red Crag cliffs.\n\nThere are walking trails galore in this great location close to our Finches Park development in Frinton-on-Sea, with the option to take a guided walk to learn more about the history and wildlife in and around Walton. Of course, you might want to get active indoors too, so the town’s gym; with a 25m indoor pool – could be ideal for you.\n\nIf you’re after traditional seaside entertainment with a modern twist, Clacton-on-Sea is the perfect destination, and only five miles away from our new homes in Frinton-on-sea. The largest town on the Essex Sunshine Coast, Clacton-on-Sea boasts a wealth of entertainment options, from the pleasure pier, arcades and seafront walks to the West Cliff Theatre, golf course, and water sports.\n\nFor attractions on an even bigger scale, Colchester is just 20 miles away from our new build homes in Frinton-on-Sea. Boasting a rich history dating back over 2,000 years, today’s Colchester is also a thriving modern town with some fantastic visitor attractions.\n\nFamily favourites include Colchester Zoo and Colchester Castle, along with great places to eat, drink and shop. Explore the historic lanes or take in the town’s main attractions including Roman ruins, arts venues, and galleries.\n\nLocal schools and education\n\nOur new build homes at Finches Park in Frinton-on-Sea are perfectly located for families with children of all ages, with the town offering a great choice of Ofsted rated ‘Good’ schools, all within easy reach.\n\nFor the younger ones, choose from Greenway Pre-School or Frinton Chapel Pre-School, rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted. For primary education, Kirby Primary Academy, also rated ‘Good’, is walking distance from Finches Park, with Frinton-on-Sea Primary School and Hamford Primary Academy just under two miles away from home.\n\nThere is also St. Philomena’s Catholic School - an independent day school for boys and girls – just two miles east of our Frinton-on-Sea new build development.\n\nFor secondary and further education, Clacton County High School (rated ‘Good’) and Tendring Technology College are close by. There is also a large choice of independent secondary education, including TLG Tendring (‘Good’), Felixstowe International College(‘Good’), and Royal Hospital School, Ipswich (rated ‘Excellence’ by the Independent Schools Inspectorate).\n\nTransport and travel\n\nFor commuters choosing a new build property for sale in Frinton-on-Sea, getting out and about is simple, with connections to the A133 allowing for journeys to Clacton-on-Sea (5.7 miles), while the A120 will get you to Harwich (11.6 miles), Colchester (20 miles) and the A12 for Ipswich (23 miles) Chelmsford (42 miles) and East London.\n\nTravelling by rail is easy from Kirby Cross station, which is within walking distance of our Finches Park new build development. From here, regular services run to Colchester (37 minutes), Walton-on-the-Naze (seven minutes) and Thorpe-le-Soken (six minutes). London Liverpool Street Station can also be reached by train in around two hours.\n\nFor local journeys, there is a convenient bus service that provides access to surrounding towns such as Walton-on-the-Naze, Colchester, Holland-on-Sea and Clacton-on-Sea. And to get away to several European destinations, Southend Airport is around 30 miles from home.\n\nRead More\n\n**Savings based on independent survey competed 2022 by Elmhurst Energy.

We reserve the right to refuse to agree to Smooth Move and we are under no obligation to give reasons why. We will instruct local estate agents to undertake an independent valuation and marketing advice for your current home before we make you a proposal on a marketing price for your home. The realistic sale price may be lower than an initial marketing price and is based on a sale within a specified timescale fixed by us. You have the final say at the price at which the property is marketed, but Smooth Move will not be available if the price at which you wish to market your current home is higher than we think is realistic or the timescale is too long. You must agree: 1. No party is currently negotiating to purchase your current home 2. No introduction has already been made by another party 3. Not to instruct another estate agent to sell your current home. You may need to leave a full set of keys and agree to access accompanied viewings for potential buyers with the appointed estate agents. You agree that Linden Homes will determine which estate agent is instructed and the terms of that appointment. It is not guaranteed that a buyer will be found for your current home or that any buyer will be willing to pay the price you want. Linden Homes may continue to market your chosen Linden home and reserves the right to take a reservation on this home until the sale of your current home to a third party is agreed and you pay the reservation fee on your chosen Linden home. In this case, if available, an alternative home may be offered, but there is no obligation on either party to proceed with Smooth Move. Any sale of your current home to a third-party buyer is at a price approved by you. A reservation fee is payable to Linden Homes for the purchase of your chosen Linden home at the agreed price, when you agree a sale on your current home. You agree only to confirm agreement of sale with a purchaser who can achieve an exchange within 35 days and who has been financially qualified to proceed with the purchase of your current home. On the simultaneous legal completion of the sale of your current home and the purchase of your new Linden home, we will pay the estate agents fees. Please note your buyer could cancel prior to legal exchange of contracts for the sale of your current home. In this instance, Linden Homes retains the right to cancel the purchase of your chosen home and retain the agreed proportion of the reservation fee in accordance with your reservation agreement. We reserve the right to withdraw Smooth Move if an acceptable buyer is not found within the specified period. Should we secure a purchaser for your current home on your behalf and you do not proceed to purchase a Linden home, you may be liable to pay all Estate Agent fees. Reservation fees may vary dependent upon the location of your new Linden home. An upfront fee of £500 is required, all of which is refundable against the reservation fee and purchase price of your new Linden home.
