        "text": "The north Essex coastline is absolutely stunning - there's a reason it's nicknamed the Essex Sunshine Coast. And just north of the popular and touristy Clacton-on-Sea is its much quieter neighbour, Frinton-on-Sea.\n\nThe town is completely different to a typical seaside town - it's very quiet and unassuming, with a long high street with an impressive variety of shops. But start to look a bit closer and you'll notice there's something a little different here.\n\nAt the seaside, you'd expect to see an ice cream vendor - or a dozen - by the beach, with queues of people waiting for some cooling refreshments. But in Frinton, there are no ice cream sellers on the beach at all, because they're banned.\n\nRead more: The isolated Essex island that residents say feels like you've gone back in time - in a good way\n\nFrinton has a long and controversial history of businesses not being allowed into the town. The town notoriously didn't even have a pub until 2000, when the Lock and Barrell opened.\n\nAs a seaside town, it seems hard to believe, but fish and chip shops were also banned - the rules have now been relaxed slightly but the first fish and chip shop was only allowed in 1992, when Nice Fish and Chips, now Young's Fisheries of Frinton, opened its doors.\n\nA second fish and chip shop was later allowed - but only as a sit-down restaurant. It was only because of the Covid pandemic that Pier One Fish and Chips was allowed to open a takeaway to complement their restaurant.\n\nThe council continues to control which businesses are allowed into Frinton even today, according to Pier One's owner Maxine Collins, 52. She says that different associations and the council are very strict on letting certain businesses into Frinton.\n\nShe remembered the challenges of when Sainsbury's came to the high street. She said: \"The council freaked out about Sainsbury's because it's got an orange sign. Sainsbury's couldn't come here until they changed their sign.\"\n\nPlanning documents from 2014 show Frinton Town Council's level of control over the building. One condition says: \"No development shall be commenced until samples of the roof tiles and bricks (...) have been submitted to and agreed, in writing, by the Local Planning Authority.\"\n\nThe reason they give is that it is \"in the interests of visual amenity and preserving the character and appearance of the Frinton Conservation Area.\"\n\nIt means there has been very little change in the town. Maxine says people return to the town after visiting it 300 or 40 years before as children and find it just the same. \"Obviously there are different shops, but the high street hasn't changed dramatically. The green's the same, the beach is exactly the same, the beach huts are the same,\" she said.\n\nThis is echoed by Jon Howell, 53, who runs the MIND charity shop on the high street. He said: \"The town is still quite old-fashioned, and I think a lot of effort has gone into keeping it that way.\"\n\nHe compared it to Clacton, saying that Frinton's appeal is that it's much more 'low key' than its louder neighbour Clacton.\n\n\"The council are very keen not to change it, which is part of the appeal,\" John says, \"that's why most people come here. I think the residents are quite keen to keep it that way too.\n\n\"They're quite keen to keep things how it was when they grew up.\"\n\nBut it's not just the older generations who appreciate Frinton 'unchangingness'. Maxine says that she's been seeing a big rise in younger visitors in recent years. She says that people now come on the train from London for day trips and its become popular for its traditional appearance.\n\nCertainly, when you walk around the town it's impossible not to notice this - on a warm and sunny day, there are always several groups of people in their late teens and early twenties chatting and relaxing on the green or browsing the shops on the high street.\n\nBut the local community remains very important for the town. Maxine says the community was incredibly fast to support someone whose house was completely destroyed in a fire recently.\n\n\"Everybody got together. The community effort for that was lovely to see, although it was such a terrible thing,\" she said.\n\nWhile the town does have its downsides, Frinton is full of character, Maxine adds. This is clear from walking down the long high street, full of independent shops.\n\n\"I think it's a lovely town. It should never lose its character.\" She highlighted the beach, during summer or winter, and the various clubs from bowling to tennis.\n\nJon agrees, adding that one of Frinton's biggest positives is the town's lack of chain stores. \"That's the appeal, to get away from the big chains in the town centres.\"\n\nIn response to the claims made in this article, Councillor Paul Clifton said: \"The planning authorities, Tendring District Council and Essex County Council, invite the Town Council to ‘comment’ on planning applications submitted to them. Frinton & Walton Town Council is a ‘statutory consultee’ for planning applications submitted to the local planning authorities, not the authority making the decision. The Town Council try to ensure that we maintain and keep the characteristics of the town.\""
