The owner had thought of absolutely everything you would need , and including lots of lovely things for four legged friends.. dog bed , towels, food and water bowls plus little biscuits. The garden was very secure and our dogs were very happy, as were we. We all spent hours down at the beach, and strolling up and down Frinton high street where there are dog friendly cafes/ restaurants. This is one of the best holiday lets we have stayed in.

The owner provided Prosecco and delicious lemon cake! It would be good if a grab handle could be fitted on the wall in the bath to help those whose balance is not so good.

The great surprise was we also had a nice bottle of Prosecco cooling in the fridge. The cottage is well equipped and the cleanliness is to an extremely high standard. The back garden was perfectly enclosed and our two dogs loved it. We were also impressed with the equipment to use for our littles pooches. Which included bowls, beds, Towells and poo bags!! The cottage is very well situated with Frinton beach nearby. Lots of variety of shops in the High Street with take-a-ways and cafes included. Lots of places to visit and good pubs too.

Property Owner\n\nReviewed by Suzanne5.0★Oct 2022\n\n\"Sea View Cottage is a perfect base for a couple or family with young children.\"\n\nWe stayed here with our two dogs and had a wonderful time. The beach is a very short walk away and at the time we stayed (October) was entirely open to dogs. The cottage has everything we and the dogs needed and Jo, an excellent host, thoughtfully left a welcome pack of treats for our arrival. I must also add, that the information pack she has produced is extremely helpful. I would unhesitatingly recommend Sea View Cottage to others wanting a cosy, relaxing retreat by the sea.\n\nThank you so much for your kind words and really great review of Sea View Cottage.

Our only negative comment is that the chairs in the lounge are uncomfortable. We had a very enjoyable stay, highly recommended.\n\nReviewed by Liz4.7★Jul 2022\n\n\"The cottage was beautifully clean and welcoming on arrival.\"\n\nVery modern furniture which was a little uncomfortable for a relaxing stay.Little hanging space in bedrooms which could be improved.Probably ideal for younger people.Great location for the beach and very close to local amenities.\n\nReviewed by James3.4★Jun 2022\n\n\"Very clean cottage & neat cottage good size garden for the dogs Bed very comfortable but not very comfortable settee or chairs & bit impractical not having a door on the kitchen & stairgate was useless to open when coming downstairs .\"\n\nThe living area a tad small & only two of us Good location for beach & loved the whole resort of Frinton on Sea\n\nI'm so pleased to hear you loved Frinton-on-Sea but very sorry to hear that the cottage living area did not meet your expectations. As a two up two down terraced property, the lounge could be considered small by some, but this is to be expected in these types of houses and as such I am unable to fit large sofas and chairs in this space. The door has been removed to give a more open plan feel to downstairs and I personally feel the space works better without it. I’m sorry you felt otherwise. Regarding the stair gate, I will, of course, look into this and make sure it is working correctly. I really do hope you enjoyed your stay despite these issues. Property Owner\n\nReviewed by Del4.1★Mar 2022\n\n\"Beautiful cottage.\"\n\nCertainly home from home. Great location for sea and beach as well as the shops. Have rebooked already. Many thanks Jo for the welcome pack and making us so welcome\n\nDear Les, thank you so much for your lovely comments. I'm so pleased you loved the cottage and Frinton-on-Sea and can't wait to welcome you back. Jo Property Owner\n\nReviewed by Leslie5.0★Mar 2022\n\n\"Hadleigh cottage 100% home from home!\"\n\nJo the owner has thought about everything you and your dog would need. Large lawned secure garden. Can see the sea at end of road from bench in front garden. Would definatly stay again and recommend it to friends and family.\n\nDear Carol, thank you so much for your great review! I'm so pleased you enjoyed your stay and would love to welcome you or any of your friends or family back to Sea View Cottage some time soon. Best wishes, Jo Property Owner\n\nReviewed by Carol5.0★Nov 2021\n\n\"We booked Sea View Cottage because of the location - it was convenient for meeting up with the family who live locally.\"\n\nHowever, it exceeded our expectations - very clean, comfortable, everything you needed in the kitchen - it was just perfect for our needs. Jo made us feel very welcome with wine, cake, etc. and was very easily contactable to answer any queries/questions. We were very lucky with the weather and enjoyed walks along the seafront which was very peaceful as no amusements etc. All in all we were more than happy with Sea View Cottage.\n\nDear Jacqueline, thank you so much for your lovely review of Sea View Cottage. I'm so pleased it exceeded your expectations and would love to welcome you back at some stage in the future. Best wishes, Jo Property Owner\n\nReviewed by Jacqueline5.0★Nov 2021\n\n\"We had a wonderful stay at Sea View.\"\n\nThe house had all we needed and was tastefully decorated and very clean. It was very cosy and we enjoyed the quiet and neighbours were friendly. The garden was perfect for our two dogs and they loved walking to Frinton beach which was nearby. Also the shops were walking distance away. There are plenty of places to eat or get a take-away. This house is in a very good location for visiting, Clacton, Holland on Sea and Colchester. We would recommend Sea View and will definitely stay there again.\n\nReviewed by Diega5.0★Nov 2021\n\n\"We had a lovely stay for October half term week.\"\n\nLocation to the beach is good and it’s only a short walk until you are on the beach. Holidaying with two young teenagers meant good WiFi is essential and the tech facilities were great with good wi-if, Alexa, Amazon Prime and Netflix available. The cottage is also very close to the main shopping street and the kids often headed down there too to visit Ye Old Sweet shop and browse the traditional shops - great too see so many independents there. We were also delighted that some of Frinton’s cafes/restaurants allowed dogs inside so we could have a nice lunch or dinner with doggo joining us too. The cottage itself had everything we needed and was nicely decorated, absolutely spotless and beds had good bedding and very comfortable. Nice touches like a welcome pack, everything supplied in the kitchen such as dishwasher tablets, tea towels, foil, cling film were wonderful - I don’t see that very often! The only downside was that the lounge was very small and we found it difficult to watch tv or play games together (cards/chess/ etc all provided). I’d definitely recommend for couples with young children or older children but for us we need more room for the teens to lounge about downstairs.\n\nReviewed by Jacqueline4.7★Oct 2021\n\n\"Accommodation was excellent.\"\n\nEverything you needed and more. Lovely location.\n\nReviewed by Linda5.0★Oct 2021\n\n\"Stunning cottage - immaculately clean with everything you could need.\"\n\nClose to the beach. Perfect !\n\nReviewed by Ann5.0★Sep 2021\n\n\"This is a wonderful cottage with lots of homely, thoughtful touches.\"\n\nThe host Jo is very kind and helpful.\n\nReviewed by Helen5.0★Aug 2021\n\n\"Beautiful cottage in a fantastic location, everything we needed was on our doorstep.\"\n\nJo went over and above to ensure we had everything we needed in the cottage and provided excellent communication prior to our stay as well. The cottage was exceptionally clean and was a real home from home. Lots of useful local information provided too. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend or book another stay.\n\nReviewed by Emma5.0★Aug 2021\n\n\"Great location for a nice British seaside break, Nice and well kept property\"\n\nReviewed by Mark5.0★Jul 2021\n\n\"Wonderful little holiday home, beautifully decorated, clean and cosy.\"\n\nMorning coffee on the bench in front garden looking down towards the sea, early evening drinks in back garden which is sheltered and a sun trap at that time of day. Walking distance to beach and lovely high street with lots of great shops including fishmongers, butchers, bakery and deli. Great fish and chip shop. Great base to explore surrounding areas.
