Hercule Poirot had sent his secretary to Frinton for a vacation. It's much more highbrow than the nearby Clacton-at-Sea with its amusement pier.\n\nThis is a series of (rather serious) architectural images depicting Frinton Park Estate which has been planned by the architect Oliver Hill in 1934 for the South Coast Property Investment Company. However, the plan was never fully realized (it would have included a Hotel and a shopping center) - the economic success of the project was limited. A number of original designs by Hill and similar designs by other architects have been built - even most recently new houses have been added that try to blend in.\n\nAfter this year's 100th Bauhaus anniversary the similarity of this modernist approach in architecture strikes me even more. Not all houses are in good shape. I have counted 26 houses that have been built in the 1930s (this is documented in the book RADICAL ESSEX which traces the different radical approaches in lifestyle, thought, politics and architecture in Essex in the 1930s) - and I apologize for this lengthy presentation (both, in words and images). But it is a place that I found truly amazing.\n\n#1 The Round House (a design by Oliver Hill)\n\n#2 The Round House\n\n#3 Architectural detail\n\n#4 Two houses\n\n#5 House on Audley Way\n\nOnly one apartment house has been built due to limited demand.\n\n#6 Apartment house (Central Avenue)\n\n#7 House on Cliff Way\n\n#8 House on Cliff Way\n\n#9 House on Easton Way\n\n#10 House on Easton Way\n\n#11 House on Graces Walk\n\n#12 House on Graces Walk\n\n#13 House on Graces Walk\n\n#14 House on Graces Walk\n\n#15 Houses on Waltham Way\n\n#16 Partial view of a house on Graces Walk\n\n#17 House on Graces Walk\n\n#18 House on Graces Walk\n\n#19 House on Graces Walk\n\n#20 Graces Walk\n\nSony A99M2 with Sigma Art F/4.0 24-105mm\n\nC&C always welcome!

I don't know whether the architects had any direct contact or discourse, but the designs are of the same aesthetic, materials and principles.\n\nPure geometric forms, unadorned, functional.\n\nThat having been said, they often suffered material failures through lack of such practicalities as pitched roofs, eaves, external rainwater gutters, and sun and weather shielding.\n\nNevertheless, they are very pleasing to look at, and the maritime setting matches their nautical appearance.\n\nAll very interesting, but if I had to pick favourites they would be ##2, 3, 8 and 14.\n\nTFS.\n\n\"Your first 10,000 photographs are your worst\" - Henri Cartier-Bresson\n\nMy FlickrPro site\n\naddy landzaat\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 22 April 2006\n\nCountry: Netherlands\n\nLocation: Netherlands\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 15346 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 07:10\n\nThis is pure interbellum modernism - like Bauhaus it is part of modern architecture. I am sure Oliver Hill was aware of buildings being build in other European countries.\n\nNice series. Usually I dislike this may pictures in a post - but these work really well as a series. Somehow I like #13 best (to bad about the reflection of the van in the window) and I also like #15. But, I especially like it as a series.\n\nWhy not follow me on Instagram? @Addy_101\n\nDopol\n\nAlpha Eyes group\n\nJoined: 17 May 2007\n\nCountry: Netherlands\n\nLocation: Utrecht\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 9723 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 07:46\n\nAn impressive series\n\nI love to walk through neighborhoods with consistent but diverse architecture. Thank you for doing it for me.\n\nThis Bauhaus like style can only be shown in a series with enough photos. So I can't complain about the number of shots. It's hard to pick the best ones though.\n\nI like the differences in the state of maintenance. Less maintained houses show the nature and character of the original architecture and stress the beauty of the well-maintained ones.\n\nBe yourself; everyone else is already taken\n\nalanfrombangor\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 05 December 2007\n\nCountry: Wales\n\nLocation: Bangor\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 5020 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 10:05\n\nBeautifully documented. Half a century ago I was at university in nearby Colchester and occasionally visited friends staying in a student house in Frinton. I had no interest in architecture then, don't even recall looking at the town.\n\nPhil Wood\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 24 March 2013\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nLocation: England\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 3201 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 10:14\n\nFascinating architecture - and some really interesting skies. Well shot, as ever - TFS.\n\nThe more I see of your shots with it the more I think that the Sigma 24-105 is the walkaround lens I have been looking for.\n\nowenn01\n\nAlpha Eyes group\n\nJoined: 20 May 2008\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nLocation: Kent\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 12306 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 10:16\n\nHi Harald,\n\nwell, I shall never look on this location with what has sometimes been described in the UK as 'Music Hall Humour' - It has always had something of the seaside post-card reputation but this goes a long way to dispelling that!\n\nThese are just superb images and combine a documentary look with a pictorial 'feel' to them - which is harder to achieve than people may realise. I looked through these and wondered just how originally 'old' some of these were - the one I struggled with was #14 which, if you look at a lot of the modern new homes (especially the 'one-offs) being built in the UK, has a strong similarity to in terms of strong, angular design and simplicity in execution. Then I looked at the garage door - that is 1930's wooden doors you would not have in a modern build (unless you really were into retro in every sense of the phrase). Mind you, I did wonder about the logic of the drive ornaments leading to the garage doors in #18 - clearly, not car owners?\n\nBy the look of these, I would propose that many have 'listed' status at the very least or have preservation orders placed upon them; something of a double-edged sword as this means there are strict limits on how you can adapt or even repair them (the wealth of 'old' windows and frames seems to point in that direction).\n\nAs for the images themselves, they all have elements of 'favourites' about them; I think you've balanced the white surfaces and the exposure really well - there's still textural detail in the walls (a fine plaster 'skim') and you make the building the key item in the frame yet still allow a context to it's surroundings to show through.\n\nA really excellent series and worthy of repeated viewing.\n\nJust one, tiny, comment: it's Frinton-ON-Sea (likewise Clacton-on-Sea) - a minor but important point for us UK based members!\n\nWell done for doing all that walking, Harald, and not raising awareness of a strange German person wandering round taking photographs of empty buildings... We are a suspicious lot sometimes!\n\nThanks for sharing and best regards, Neil.\n\nMy Mantra: \"Comment on other's work as you would wish to have yours commented upon\". Go on - it's fun!\n\nbonneville\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 19 May 2007\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 2621 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 12:36\n\nHi Harald\n\nVery well spotted, although I was no stranger to Frinton-on-Sea in Essex. I was born (nearly 72 years ago) in Jaywick Sands and grew up to my late teens in that area. Jaywick is just a couple of miles along the coast south of Clacton and my adolescence was spent mostly cycling from my seaside village home along the sea front and coastal path past Clacton, Holland-on-Sea and on to Frinton, and Walton-on-the-Naze.\n\nTwo more extreme communities you couldn't image between Jaywick and Frinton. Jaywick now has very sadly fallen into utter poverty, but in the 1950s and 60s it was a thriving holiday resort mainly for London east enders who would descend on the holiday bungalows and beautiful beaches in their droves by the coach load during the summer months. My friends and I would regularly cycle to Frinton, known as the enclosed town due to only then having a single road in and out of it, to see \"how the other half lived\"!\n\nWe regularly saw famous celebrities of their day in Frinton, many of whom had homes along the grand promenade, including Cliff Richard and Roger Moore.\n\nSo to see your wonderful photos brought back many memories. I left school and the area for ever when I joined the Army at 17 and spent the next 27 years travelling the world (for exciting tales see my published work \"As You Were!\" )\n\nThank you for sharing.\n\nMichael Johansson\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 13 May 2006\n\nCountry: Sweden\n\nLocation: Gullaskruv\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 727 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 14:28\n\nI must say these photographs are lovely and point towards an area I was not aware of. I have spent many summer holidays in UK in our motorhome and quite a few short trips by air. I would have loved to see these architecture masterpieses in real but now it seem to be to late. The English (yes, I distinguish the English from the Scots and Welsh who I belive voted differently) have voted for Brexit and as I regard myself as an european I feel I can´t go there anymore. At least not after a Brexit is de facto.\n\nI particularly like #14 for its strait lines and perspective and #15 for the well defined textures whereas #11 and #12 have beautiful skies. Congratulations to a well performed photoshoot.\n\na7RII ~ S4/24-105G ~ S2.8/90MacroG ~ 5600HS(D) ~ HVL43AM ~ Ring+Macro TwinFlash\n\nskm.sa100\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 08 January 2009\n\nCountry: United States\n\nLocation: Charlotte, NC\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 4599 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 16:59\n\nThis series is an expression of the joy of photography.\n\nI like it very much. I like strong and punchy pics but one of two of these area bit too strong even for me and #12 is the best example of that.\n\nI like #3 for it clean, minimal composition.\n\n#13 is perhaps a good example of something that might work well in B&W too.\n\nFor some straight-on shots, weren't you intersted in keystone correction? #17 for example?\n\nBut, forget about it. It's a fine series and the flat roofs remind me of Spanish style architecture in the US, maybe from Miami where I lived briefly.\n\nOver all, a thoroughly enjoyable set that needs time to be savored and invites the viewer to come back for more viewings. What more can be asked?\n\nTFS\n\nSashi\n\nMore Dyxumer, less photographer.\n\nHoward_S\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 20 March 2008\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nLocation: Oxford\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 5378 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 26 November 2019 at 23:41\n\nFantastic set, Harald. I like #13 with the indifferent seagulls and facade in need of a lick of paint, to say the least. There are other little details to savour: the classic post box in #1, the sweeping curved line echoing the curves of the house in #2, the British seaside palm trees, the rising sun motif in the gates in #5 and #7, the driveway bollards in #17, and the porthole windows and swimming pool ladders everywhere.\n\nI was unaware of these houses, and it has changed my view of the place. Before it was pretty much as Wikipedia puts it, Frinton's population of retirees makes it the butt of jokes, with the LNER advertising slogan \"Harwich for the Continent\" being appended \"Frinton for the incontinent\".\n\nTFS!\n\nMichelvA\n\nAlpha Eyes group\n\nKnowledge Base Contributor\n\nJoined: 26 April 2008\n\nCountry: Netherlands\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPosts: 20477 Post Options Quote Reply Posted: 27 November 2019 at 05:54\n\nAs others also stated, great you take us to this place. Beautiful architecture, although they look quite similar. I always liked the Bauhaus style (i even bought a small piece last week ..), nice to see that some owners painted the window frames light green or black to make it more modern. A modern door is not always suited to the style (#16..). I love these lengthy presentations, which are not only a joy to watch, but also let us learn. Thanks Harald .\n\nThank you all for your kind comments - which are very much appreciated.\n\nBrian: I will start working on my Jaywick images ASAP. Nice to learn that Roger Moore and Cliff Richard have been regulars at Frinton."
