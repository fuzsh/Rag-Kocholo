        "text": "Hi I'm Kimberley. As a Branch Manager for Helping Hands, I am here to ensure the safe running of my branch for my customers and carers. I ensure that all our customers have the care they need to help them remain at home for as long as possible. I am here to make sure my care team feel valued and appreciated for all the hard work they do. I started in care 15 years ago after seeing the difference my mum made as a carer when I was a child. I used to visit the homes she worked in and it brought joy to the residents. I have been with my branch of Helping Hands in Colchester since it opened, and I have a wonderful team - many who have been here since the beginning. I could not do my job effectively without my carers, they are superstars! In my spare time I like to spend time with my family and my young children."
