        "text": "Harwich for the Continent…Frinton for the Incontinent! as the saying goes, so you may be forgiven for not thinking much of this quiet little town on the Essex Coast. I’m here to change your mind. I may be biased but I love this sleepy little seaside town. Not exactly a local (I don’t live there) but I have been going here since I was born. My father came here every summer as a boy as well and so it holds a special place in our hearts.\n\nWe have a small house in the town along with a beach hut on the seafront and we spend every August Bank holiday down there and try to get a few more weekends down there throughout the summer too. So read on to find out what to do in Frinton on Sea …\n\nFrinton’s History\n\nIn its heyday, Frinton was the jewel of the Essex Riviera, the place to see and be seen. Whether you were visiting the lido complete with palm trees or drinking cocktails on the terrace of the high-end hotels along the Esplanade, it was an elegant destination for those in the know. Connaught Avenue (the Main Street), named after the Duke of Connaught and opened by his wife, was once nicknamed East Anglia’s Bond Street, The Prince of Wales frequented the golf club and Winston Churchill even rented a house.\n\nThe snobbery really comes into effect though when you start talking about The Gates! The Gates are the entrance to Frinton and they form the barrier across the railway tracks that separate Frinton from the outside world. The Gates have always been a symbol of Frinton, as Frinton’s mayor once said: “Paris has its Eiffel Tower, London has Tower Bridge, in Frinton we have the gates. All over the world, people talk about them.”\n\nHowever a few years ago, to improve performance and safety and to cut costs, the old wooden gates were removed and replaced with remotely operated barriers. The town was in an uproar (much like when the first pub was opened – but more about that later) and a documentary was even created around the campaign to ‘Save Frinton’s Gates.’ However, like most things, people just got used to the new way but it is still a huge stamp of kudos to live ‘within the gates.’\n\nBeach Life\n\nObviously, one of the main draws of a holiday in Frinton on Sea is the beach! The seafront is still lined by many Victorian-style beach huts, a throwback to when the town was a favourite destination for the aristocracy and even royalty. Some of these are available to rent by the day and my childhood was spent in our beach hut, building sandcastles and crabbing in the rock pools and along the breakwater. There are beach games to play like boule or cricket and it’s normally windy enough to fly a kite. There are even kite surfers having a go on the windier days!\n\nThe beach at Frinton is a sandy one and separated by breakwaters every hundred yards or so. Before you travel, check the tides here as the water comes right up to the sea wall so if you’re out for a day trip you may find that you run out of beach at some point. Not to worry though as there is always the Promenade to sit on or the grassy Greensward up the top. You can always wait out the high tides – after an hour or so you’ll be able to head back down to sit on the beach.\n\nSwimming in Frinton on Sea is not for the faint-hearted. I’m more of a Mediterranean girl myself but I’m told by everyone that I’m missing out. In the summer especially, the water can get really warm and there are always people in the sea splashing about. Every few beaches there are rafts anchored a few metres out that you can swim to and dive off of. People bring canoes and kayaks and inflatables to play in the water with. We’re lucky enough to have a small speed boat and plenty of ‘boat toys’ including water skis, a banana, donuts, a knee-board, a wake-board, etc.\n\nPublic Conveniences\n\nPublic toilets are available at regular intervals along the seafront and the new toilet block at the top of the cliff on the Greensward near Connaught Avenue (20p charge). There are outside taps every 100m or so, providing fresh drinkable tap water. However, there are no shops down on the seafront so if you’re after a snack or ice cream, the nearest shops are on Connaught Avenue.\n\nThere is free parking all along the seafront next to the Greensward, but, be warned that this tends to fill up on sunny days. Parking can then be found on the many roads off of the Esplanade.\n\nAre dogs allowed on Frinton beach?\n\nThere are some restrictions regarding dogs on the beaches during summertime. They are restricted on some beaches (from the seafront below Connaught Avenue to the toilets below Cambridge Road) during the summer period 1st May to 30th September. Guide dogs are exempt. Dogs are allowed on the Promenade if on a lead and on all other beaches as long as you adhere to the ‘good dog owners code’ and clean up after the dog.\n\nIf the sun is shining you’ll never be short of things to do down on the beach. But what if it isn’t…\n\nAttractions and Amusements\n\nOften known for its numerous churches and lack of pubs (there is just one, which was only given the go-ahead in 2000 after a big outcry from the residents) this is a quiet seaside town. This is not the place to go for amusement parks, arcades, and candy floss! Instead, the town’s entertainment revolves around the High Street, the Golf, Cricket & Tennis Clubs, and a Summer Outdoor Theatre.\n\nFrinton Golf Club is one of the oldest in Essex having been founded way back in 1892. It was originally a nine-hole course but was extended to include 18 holes and of course, the Club House.\n\nFrinton Lawn Tennis and Squash Club is one of the country’s most prestigious tennis clubs. Founded in 1899, the club initially catered for tennis, croquet, and bowls. Three of the biggest events at the club are the ITF Futures, ITF Veterans, and LTA Junior Open tournaments. The ITF Veteran’s and Junior Open Tournaments are grade 3 events, which is the same level as Wimbledon’s equivalent.\n\nCricket Club is a thriving local club with plenty of fixtures that is always looking for new members. The buzzy clubhouse is a fun place to hang out and grab a drink too.\n\nClick this link to find more local clubs\n\nEvery Summer Frinton really comes into its own with the infamous Frinton Summer Theatre Season. The McGrigor Hall has been home to so many famous actors who tread the boards here every summer. It was started in 1937 and has helped to launch many actors into more prolific careers. Vanessa Redgrave, Jane Asher, David Suchet, Gary Oldman, and Linda Bellingham (to name just a few) all started out at Frinton Summer Theatre. Once the summer programme is released you buy your tickets, either online or from the Box Office (Little Yellow Hut), and then enjoy performances either at McGrigor Hall on in the seafront marquee on the Greensward.\n\nFrinton itself doesn’t have any amusement arcades or typical ‘seaside attractions.’ However, the two towns on either side, Clacton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze both boast plenty of alternative amusements. Walton Pier is where we tend to go most often. It has fairground rides, amusement arcades, ice cream, candyfloss stalls, and a bowling alley. Typical seaside entertainment.\n\nClacton-on-Sea is a much larger town and offers much more in the way of entertainment. Clacton Pavillion is a huge entertainment and amusement centre situated on the seafront and again there is a Pier with plenty of fairground rides. They have a cinema, many more shops and restaurants, and a bowling alley for those days when the weather isn’t good enough for the beach.\n\nWalks around Frinton\n\nOne of our favourite walks to do is to Walton-on-the-Naze. The Naze is a headland with a lot of geographical significance (We took a lot of geography field trips here when I was at school). You pass Walton pier and continue on a bit further to this unspoiled spot, teeming with so much British wildlife. The is also The Naze Tower, an 86ft landmark housing an art gallery, museum, tea rooms, and viewing platform. There are also lots of Marinas you can walk to, Titchmarsh Marina is a nice walk away and you can also wander the Walton backwaters.\n\nAnother favourite walk is to the next town South along the coast ‘Holland on Sea’ which is about 5km away. The walk takes you along the seafront for a while with golf course views and as you exit Frinton the footpath takes you through the beautiful Essex countryside.\n\nIf you fancy a day trip you can even take a drive and wander the banks of the Stour Estuary heading to Manningtree, Mistley, and all the other picturesque towns that border the water.\n\nWhere to eat and drink in Frinton on Sea?\n\nThe restaurant offering in Frinton on Sea used to be a bit tragic. A couple of dusty cafes and a few takeaways but recently the restaurant scene has taken a turn for the better. There are now a few quite smart bistros along with a fabulous Indian, a wine bar, and of course the Fish & Chip shop. I think the nicest restaurant in town is Avenue Bistro, a seafood restaurant with great daily specials and it has the smartest feel of all the restaurants in town.\n\nThere is also another seafood restaurant (Pier One), a 1950s-style café called Pop-pins, which serves ice creams, waffles, salads, and sandwiches, along with Arnie’s Cocktail Bar which also has a great food menu.\n\nThere is a Chinese Take-Away and two Indian Take-Aways (the Star of India is our favourite) and plenty of smaller cafés along with a few branded chain places like Costa Coffee and Greggs.\n\nAgain, not liking change, the residents put up a fight when the Fish & Chip shop (Young’s Other Plaice) was suggested but it has now become part of the local community. What’s not to like about fish and chips overlooking the sea?\n\nIn terms of the drinking scene, there is a wine bar, Frinton Wine Boutique, a pub (The Lock & Barrel), and a secret cocktail bar in a courtyard out the back of the shop Great Danes.\n\nIf you’re willing to venture a bit further afield then there are some really fabulous restaurants a short drive away. Three of my personal favourites are the Mistley Thorn, The Bicycle in Tendring, and The Pier at Harwich. These are all about a half-hour drive away but well worth the effort! Beautiful fresh seafood and extensive wine lists!\n\nHow to get to Frinton on Sea?\n\nFrinton is situated on the Essex Coast and is easily reachable by road. It’s about an hour from the M25 or half an hour from the A12 turn off to Colchester. To reach Frinton by road, follow the A12 for 60 miles northeast from London. Turn off just beyond Colchester (A12/Junc29) onto the A120 (for Colchester/Harwich). Then, after about 5miles turn off onto A133 (Clacton/Weeley). Follow the signs to Weeley and then take the B1033 to Frinton. Cross over the railway lines, through the famous gates and you’ve arrived!\n\nAlternatively, you can get the train from London to Thorpe-le-Soken and change there onto the seaside train which tracks the coast. Frinton is another two stops down the line. The journey takes about an hour and a half in total from Liverpool St and is so easy to do. I love jumping on the train after work on a Friday knowing that I’ll be seeing the sea in about 90 minutes!\n\nWhere to stay in Frinton on Sea?\n\nFrinton is great for day trips but if you want to stay longer you can book accommodation.\n\nThere is only one hotel in town, The Rock which gets booked up quickly so get in there fast! It’s been around for years and definitely has that olde world charm about it.\n\nOther than that you could even rent out our own house if you want to experience Frinton exactly the way that I always have or check out other B&Bs and Guest Houses in the area. (Disclaimer: our beach house is not The Ritz, but it’s cute and quirky and we’ve had many happy times there!). Don’t forget to check out the photos on the wall of us all when we were kiddies, playing on the beach!\n\nIf you want to rent a Beach Hut you can check out this website but these are just for use during the day – you can’t sleep in them!\n\nFor more information, you can visit the Tourist Information Centre, Princes Esplanade, Walton-on-the-Naze – Tel: 01255 675542\n\nIf you have any more questions or if there’s something I haven’t covered then please feel free to comment or message me. If I don’t know I can find out! You can probably tell how much love I have for this sleepy little town – I’d love for you to experience it yourself!\n\nPIN WHAT TO DO IN FRINTON ON SEA FOR LATER"
