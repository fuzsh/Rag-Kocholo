        "text": "FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and T&Cs\n\nWhere are the huts?\n\nWe have 8 beautiful beach huts along the Walton-on-the-Naze seafront.\n\nWalton Huts\n\nThese huts are all at Southcliff which is the beach between the pier and Frinton:\n\nDaisy, (Yellow Hut) A183 (furthest from the pier towards the Frinton end)\n\nLizzie, (Pale Pink Hut) A178\n\nBertie, (Blue Hut) A172\n\nRosie, (Pink Hut) A173\n\nMolly, (Turquoise Hut) A115\n\nLily, (Pink Hut) A42\n\nPoppy, Pink Hut) A16\n\nBillie, (Turquoise Hut) A14 (A14 is closest to the pier)\n\nAll above are Front Row, Southcliff Promenade, Walton on the Naze, Essex CO14 8EJ\n\nWhich hut would suit me best?\n\nFirst of all, have a look at the photos on each hut’s page to see which one you like the look of.\n\nAll are front row and have excellent views of the sea and coastline. You can sit outside your hut and watch the world go by and the kids on the beach.\n\nLook at the hut numbers and you will see where they are in relation to each other and also where they are in relation to the pier with Billie (number 14) being nearest the pier (and therefore busier) and Daisy (number 183) being furthest (and therefore quieter)\n\nThe Lily, Poppy and Billie Huts are flat on the prom with no steps and the Molly Hut has only 1 small step so these 4 are perfect for toddlers and people who find steps difficult as they are all directly on the prom. There is also a ramp down to the sand by Lily\n\nThe Daisy, Bertie, Lizzie and Rosie huts are further from the busy pier end so are quieter and are set back a few steps from the prom with their own space outside to set up your deckchairs and table and spread out across the steps away from the prom so great if you want to have a bit of space between you and the people walking by.\n\nMolly and Lizzie have perspex screens that you can put into the window frames on days when the weather isn't so kind.\n\nMolly and Billie Huts have a curtain that you can pull across to give you a bit more privacy when getting changed etc.\n\nHuts next door to each other: Rosie and Bertie so if you are a group of more than 8 then you should book these two together. Lizzie is nearby too, just 4 huts between them. Billie and Poppy have two huts between them plus a set of steps.\n\nWhere shall I park?\n\nThe best place to park is in the large public carpark near the pier (Church Road, CO14 8DE). There is also parking along the residential streets nearby and in the station carpark (CO14 8DH) or Millennium Square car park (CO14 8AF)\n\nIf you are visiting the Daisy, Bertie, Lizzie, Molly or Rosie huts from September to May (there are parking restrictions in the summer) you can park at the far end of Woodberry Way, CO14 8ER (the end that is furthest from the station)\n\nWalton has a train station too with good links to London and Colchester and in fact, Walton station is even nearer to the beach than the carpark!\n\nHow do I find the hut?\n\nAll the huts have numbers on them so you can check if you’re heading in the right direction!\n\nFrom the Pier, with the sea on your left, walk along the prom, round the bend and you will find the huts spread out along the prom from there, Billie (A14) being the closest to the pier and A183 (Daisy) being the furthest. If you have a buggy or don’t want steps this is the way to access the prom.\n\nFrom the station or Church Road carpark, head for Woodberry Way and on the corner of Woodberry Way where it bends round to the right go down the steps to the beach and, at the bottom, turn left for Billie (first hut you come to after the stripy hut) or turn right for all other huts\n\nFrom the far end of Woodberry Way, walk down the ramp then turn LEFT at the beach and approach the hut from that direction which is slightly shorter than approaching from the pier end (Molly is about equidistant)\n\nWhat happens when you book a beach hut with us?\n\nAs soon as you book, you will receive a booking confirmation email straight away and then another email a few days before your booking with all the info you need.\n\nIf you don’t receive the emails, please check in your junk folder as they do seem to disappear into there sometimes! (Hotmail and Outlook accounts seem particularly prone to this!) If you save [email protected] as a contact this sometimes alleviates the problem as it thinks we’re friends (Ahhh!)\n\nHow do I gain access to the hut?\n\nAccess to the hut is via a key safe on the back or side of the hut. The keysafe code will be included in the email that we send you in the days leading up to your booking. When you replace the keys at the end of the day, please be sure to scramble the keycode and close the shutter on the keysafe.\n\nHow many are allowed in the huts?\n\nHuts are equipped for 6 and hold a maximum of 8 per hut including babies and dogs! We reserve the right to ask you to leave if we find an excess of guests.\n\nWhen are you open?\n\nFrom the start of the school Easter holidays to the end of October half term. We often have weekday discounts (excluding bank/school holidays) so please check our social media for updates. Facebook and/or Instagram.\n\nHow and when do I pay?\n\nThe website handles all the payments through Stripe (similar to but better than Paypal!) You can use a credit or a debit card.\n\nPayments are required in full at the time of booking and we are sorry but we do not do refunds or transfers so please be sure when you book.\n\nWhat are your Check in and Check out times?\n\nHigh/Mid Season: 10am-6pm (we can be flexible on the 10am so do ask if you want to arrive early – sometimes we clean them or do maintenance on them in the mornings rather than at night especially if the weather was bad the previous evening)\n\nLow Season: 10am-5pm\n\nCan we stay in the huts overnight?\n\nUnfortunately it is not permitted to stay overnight as beach huts are not classed as dwellings.\n\nWhere can I stay overnight nearby?\n\nIn addition to the beach huts, we also operate a holiday let called Daisy Beach House which is right behind the beach huts. It has all the charm and styling of our beach huts and sleeps 8!
