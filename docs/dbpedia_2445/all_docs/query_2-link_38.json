        "text": "This article is part of our latest special report on Waterfront Homes.\n\nBritain has had a centuries-long obsession with seaside towns, first sparked in the late 1700s when doctors began extolling the health-affirming virtues of seawater and ocean air. The know-how, and wealth, of the Industrial Revolution led Victorians to embrace this innovation with gusto, resulting in more than 100 such resort towns dotting the coast by century’s end.\n\n“They were incredible feats of architecture and engineering — even to attempt one now would be an extraordinary thing,” said Alex Fisher, editor of Coast, a magazine that celebrates life around Britain’s seafronts.\n\nBy the 20th century, they continued to thrive, and most had become synonymous with a brassy, carefree affect: saucy postcards, kiss-me-quick hats and an occasional sunny day on a spit of sand. The rise of cheap package holidays abroad starting in the 1970s slowly siphoned off their core market, though, leaving many foundering through the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBut thanks to the British government’s restrictive, pandemic-related travel policies, which all but forced Britons to embrace domestic vacations again, they’ve seen a revival this year, Ms. Fisher noted. And that might have a future: Flexible working, she said, will make it easier to attract residents, rather than visitors, to such locales in the long term."
