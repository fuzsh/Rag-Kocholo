They are performed once every 10 years. Our website shows 2021 data for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. For Scotland, 2011 data is shown (update coming soon, the Scottish census was delayed by a year unlike the rest of the UK). Please note: census information may include figures for adjacent streets and postcodes. The figures are therefore representative of the local area, not a specific street address or row of houses. The census collection is designed so that each group of postcodes should contain at least 100 people (50 in Scotland). This is done to preserve the anonymity of the people in that area, as some postcodes cover a very small area, sometimes a single building. You can see the area covered by the census statistics by clicking \"Show Census Area Covered\" below the map above.\n\nUsing this Information Commercially\n\nThe information we provide on the website is done so without charge.

This part of the Frinton ward however contains significantly more women than average (60%). This can be caused by a number of factors, but amongst the most common are large establishments such as boarding schools and convents, and areas with older populations.\n\nFemales on average live longer than males, so are more likely to be found in retirement areas. In general, as people age, they move away from city centre addresses to suburbs, smaller towns and rural locations, so these areas often show a greater number of females, with inner-city areas showing the opposite trend.\n\nGender Male 75 Female 114\n\nTotal 189\n\nAge Groups Embed This Back to Top\n\nAcross the UK as a whole, the median age is 40. The area around CO13 9LQ has a very large concentration of residents that are aged 65+ (at 46% of the resident population). This is most commonly seen in rural and small-town areas, and areas of natural beauty that appeal to an older demographic.\n\nThis type of distribution is also seen in areas that contain large retirement complexes and care homes.\n\nAge Groups 0-4 3 5-9 4 10-14 13 15-19 7 20-24 7 25-29 3 30-34 9 35-39 6 40-44 5 45-49 10 50-54 8 55-59 15 60-64 17 65-69 22 70-74 23 75-79 17 80-84 13 85+ 11\n\nTotal 193\n\nRelationship Status Embed This Back to Top\n\nThe postcode CO13 9LQ does not show a significant deviation from the average figures for the UK.

This may have been influenced by how people perceived their health aginst the backdrop of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, this area of the Frinton ward shows lower levels of residents that report their health as Good or Very Good (70%) than average, which is usually indicative of areas with older populations or areas of social deprivation.\n\nHealth Very Good 58 Good 74 Fair 51 Bad 5 Very Bad 2\n\nTotal 190\n\nEducation & Qualifications Embed This Back to Top\n\nFifth Avenue and surrounding area has a larger than average concentration of residents have no qualifications - 32% of the resident population.

On average, around 21.6% of census respondents were retired. This represents a significant increase since the 2011 census, where 13.8% were retired. This may be partly explained by the number of people aged 65 years and over increasing in the UK, and partially by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the workforce in the time leading up to the census.\n\nFigures for economic activity do not include those aged under 16, or those family members aged 16-18 who are in full-time education. The data was correct as of the 2021 census, which was a period of depressed economic activity.\n\nThe 2021 census occurred during period of depressed economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
