While Rogers marriage to Briggs lasted only six years, Ayres and Diana would remain together for over three decades before his death in 1996 at the age of 88.\n\nRogers lived out the remainder of her life in California before passing away in 1995 at the age of 83. Today, she is buried in Oakwood Memorial Cemetery in Los Angeles.\".",
