        "text": "As a little girl, Lynnette Barkley stayed up past bedtime to watch the glamorous dancing duo Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The couple would glide across the floor, with Rogers in a sequined gown and Astaire in a black tux with tails.\n\nIt was then that Barkley began to dream of a career in dance — and consider the idea that female roles had a different set of demands.\n\n“I think that was the first time I heard the phrase, ‘Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, but she did it backwards and in high heels,’ ” said Barkley, who co-wrote and choreographed a musical tribute to Rogers that opens tomorrow at the California Center for the Arts, Escondido.\n\n“I remember my mom saying that when we watched those old movies.”\n\nThe world premiere of “Backwards in High Heels,” written by New York-based Barkley and author-musician Christopher McGovern, was staged in Florida three years ago.\n\n“We worked together on ‘Sisters of Swing,’ an Andrews Sisters musical,” Barkley said. “I was directing and choreographing; Christopher was the musical director. We connected well and the producers said, ‘Why don’t you write your own musical?’ That’s how we started. We threw out a lot of different ideas, and when Ginger came up, we thought, ‘Oh — interesting!’ We had a lot to work with.”\n\nRogers was born Virginia Katherine McMath in 1911 and died in Rancho Mirage at the age of 83. The musical covers her life from her teenage years as a vaudeville dancer to her 1940 Academy Award win for her performance in “Kitty Foyle.” She married five times, beginning with Jack Culpepper at age 17.\n\nRogers’ mother, a scriptwriter, film critic and a founder of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, oversaw her daughter’s career and helped with contract negotiations. At age 19, Rogers was catapulted to stardom when she appeared in the 1930 film “Girl Crazy.” But like her friend, actress Lucille Ball, she had to fight Hollywood prejudice to get a fair financial deal.\n\n“In my research, I found that Ginger was very instrumental in getting better pay for women,” Barkley said. “Early in her career, she was making less than the character men in her films. She fought for women to be acknowledged in Hollywood.”\n\nThe Fullerton Civic Light Opera Music Theatre recently licensed “Backwards in High Heels” and made it a more elaborate production. The show was staged last month in Fullerton and travels to Escondido this weekend for five performances.\n\nMost people remember Rogers for her remarkable dance routines with Fred Astaire, whom she met and dated in New York before they went on to be paired in 10 films.\n\nEven today, the names “Fred and Ginger” can refer to any dance team that exemplifies grace and fluidity.\n\n“I think there must have been chemistry between them,” Barkley mused. “But by the time Fred got to Hollywood, he was married. They were both actors and they could create a scene or a mood with dancing without ever saying a word. That’s very rare.”"
