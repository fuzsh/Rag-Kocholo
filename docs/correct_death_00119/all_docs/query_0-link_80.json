        "text": "RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Ginger Rogers, the glamourous\n\nblonde who made dance floor magic with Fred Astaire in a string of\n\nunforgettable musicals and won an Academy Award as best actress for\n\n\"Kitty Foyle,\" died Tuesday at 83.\n\nMiss Rogers died at her home here, apparently of natural causes,\n\nRiverside County Coroner Veronica Martinez said.\n\nMiss Rogers' career spanned 65 years in every field of show\n\nbusiness from vaudeville to television. During the 1940s, she was\n\none of the highest paid, most sought-after Hollywood stars.\n\nShe was most remembered for the blissful partnership with\n\nAstaire in sparkling musicals that brightened Depression America.\n\nHe in top hat and tails, she in a flowing gown, they glided over\n\npolished floors in a perfect display of grace and romance.\n\nShe once called their teaming \"just a wonderful happening. It\n\nwasn't planned. I thought it turned out to be magic. I was told\n\neven in the first picture people could see something was happening.\"\n\nMiss Rogers continued performing her musical show into her late\n\n70s until ill health confined her to a wheelchair. Even so, she\n\ntoured extensively to promote her 1991 autobiography, \"Ginger: My\n\nStory,\" and received honors at film festivals and tributes. The\n\nmost notable were the Kennedy Center Honors in December 1992.\n\nMiss Rogers married and divorced five times. She had no children.\n\n\"I yearned for a long, happy marriage with one person,\" she\n\nwrote. \"But my life has been blessed in so many other ways that I\n\nwanted to share the good times and the hard times with a public\n\nthat has shown me unbounded appreciation and loyalty.\"\n\nShe was born Virginia Katherine McMath on July 16, 1911, in\n\nHarry Truman's home town of Independence, Mo. Her father had\n\nabandoned his pregnant wife.\n\nA cousin couldn't pronounce Virginia and the name came out\n\n\"Ginja.\" It was Ginger thereafter, and she adopted her stepfather's\n\nlast name to begin performing as Ginger Rogers.\n\nMiss Rogers won the prize as Charleston Champion of Texas, and\n\nsoon was touring the country in a vaudeville act created by Lela\n\nRogers, her mother, \"Ginger Rogers and Her Redheads.\" An engagement\n\nwith the Paul Ash orchestra at the Paramount theater brought her\n\nfirst New York engagement. She began appearing in musical short\n\nfilms and on Christmas 1929 opened in a Broadway musical, \"Top\n\nSpeed.\"\n\nShe began her movie career in 1930 with Paramount's \"Young Man\n\nof Manhattan.\" It was a secondary role as a society flapper, but\n\nshe made a strong impression, especially with her line, \"Cigarette\n\nme, big boy.\" The phrase became part of the vernacular.\n\n\"Girl Crazy,\" a tune-filled Gershwin musical of 1930,\n\nestablished Miss Rogers' stardom, despite the sensation of Ethel\n\nMerman singing \"I Got Rhythm.\" During rehearsals, the producers\n\nwere dissatisfied with the \"Embraceable You\" number and called in\n\nthe expert help of Astaire, then starring on Broadway with his\n\nsister Adele. Astaire watched the routine in the theater lobby and\n\nsaid, \"Here, Ginger, try it with me.\"\n\nIn her book, Ginger dealt with the legends about her\n\nrelationship with Fred. She emphasized that he was no Svengali; she\n\nhad made 20 films before they joined on \"Flying Down to Rio\" in\n\n1933, he had appeared in one. They didn't hate each other, \"despite\n\noccasional snits.\"\n\n\"We had fun, and it shows,\" she wrote. \"True, we were never\n\nbosom buddies off the screen; we were different people with\n\ndifferent interests. We were a couple only on film.\"\n\nAfter the breakup of the team, some industry observers believed\n\nRogers' career would languish without Astaire. She defied them by\n\nplaying a dramatic role in \"Kitty Foyle\" that won her the Oscar.\n\nMiss Rogers' film career thrived for 25 years because of her\n\nadaptability to the times.\n\nShe proved herself with comedy and romance in the musicals with\n\nAstaire and with drama in \"Kitty Foyle,\" \"I'll Be Seeing You,\"\n\n\"Tender Comrade\" and \"Storm Warning.\" She could be down-to-earth in\n\n\"Roxie Hart\" and \"Primrose Path\" or sophisticated in \"Lady in the\n\nDark\" and \"Forever Female.\"\n\nMiss Rogers' last film came in 1965 as Jean Harlow's mother in\n\none of two quickly made versions of the blonde star's life. In\n\ninterviews she expressed her distaste for the new frankness in\n\nHollywood films.\n\n\"We made happy pictures that people enjoyed seeing, not the kind\n\nthat audiences have to go through a trauma to see nowadays,\" she\n\nsaid.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
