The five titles were produced by Corman and were each helmed by future big-name directors, just a handful of the now-major Hollywood names who got their starts working on Corman movies. Up first is Boxcar Bertha (1972), a Depression-set crime drama that was Martin Scorsese’s second directorial feature. Barbara Hershey stars as the title character, alongside David Carradine. Next is Targets (1968), which marked Peter Bogdanovich’s theatrical directorial debut.

After that is Francis Ford Coppola’s feature directorial debut: the black-and-white slasher horror film Dementia 13 (1963), which Coppola also wrote. As the lineup enters late-night/early tomorrow morning, it features a couple of the more exploitative and raunchy and/or violent, yet still fun, Corman productions. There is 1974’s Caged Heat, a women-in-prison film written and helmed by Jonathan Demme in his directorial debut. The lineup concludes with Piranha (1978), directed and co-edited by Joe Dante.
