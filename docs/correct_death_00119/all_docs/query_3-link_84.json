        "text": "Actresses\n\nGinger Rogers (born Virginia Katherine McMath; July 16, 1911 – April 25, 1995) was an American actress, dancer, and singer. She is best remembered for performing during the 1930s in RKO’s musical films (partnered with Fred Astaire). Her career continued on stage, radio, and television throughout much of the 20th century.\n\nBorn in Independence, Missouri, and raised in Kansas City, Rogers and her family moved to Fort Worth, Texas, when she was nine years old. After winning a 1925 Charleston dance contest that launched a successful vaudeville career, she gained recognition as a Broadway actress for her debut stage role in Girl Crazy. This led to a contract with Paramount Pictures, which ended after five films. One of her earliest roles was in Young Man of Manhattan (1930), starring Claudette Colbert; Rogers repeated line in the film “Cigarette me, big boy” became a catchphrase during the 1930s. She had her first successful film role as a supporting actress in 42nd Street (1933).\n\nRogers made nine films in the 1930s with Astaire, which were some of her biggest successes such as Swing Time (1936) and Top Hat (1935). After two commercial failures with Astaire, Rogers began to branch out into dramatic and comedy films. Her acting was well received by critics and audiences as she became one of the biggest box-office draws and highest paid actresses of the 1940s. Her performance in Kitty Foyle (1940) won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. Other notable roles during this period include Change of Heart (1934), with Janet Gaynor and James Dunn; Roberta (1935), with Irene Dunne, Astaire, Randolph Scott; Stage Door (1937), with Katharine Hepburn, Adolphe Menjou, Gail Patrick, Lucille Ball; Having a Wonderful Time (1938), with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Ball, Red Skelton; Vivacious Lady (1938), with James Stewart, Charles Coburn, Hattie McDaniel; Tales of Manhattan (1942), with Henry Fonda, Cesar Romero, Rita Hayworth, Gail Patrick; Billy Wilder‘s debut American feature The Major and the Minor (1942), with Ray Milland; and Leo McCarey‘s Once Upon a Honeymoon (1942), with Cary Grant.\n\nRogers’ popularity had peaked by the end of the decade. She reunited with Astaire in 1949 in the commercially successful The Barkleys of Broadway. Other notable films during this period included Monkey Business (1952), with Grant, Marilyn Monroe, Charles Coburn; Forever Female (1953), with William Holden; Black Widow (1955), with Gene Tierney; and Tight Spot (1955), with Edward G. Robinson. After an unsuccessful period in the 1950s, Rogers returned to Broadway in 1965, playing the lead role in Hello, Dolly! More lead roles on Broadway followed, along with her stage directorial debut in 1985 on an off-Broadway production of Babes in Arms. Rogers also made television acting appearances until 1987. In 1992, Rogers was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors. She died of a heart attack in 1995, at the age of 83.\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.\n\n(*seen originally in theaters)\n\n(**seen rereleased in theaters)"
