        "text": "Ginger Rogers (born Virginia Katherine McMath) was an American actress, dancer, and singer, who appeared in films, and on stage, radio, and television throughout much of the 20th century.\n\nWalt Disney toyed with the idea of having a live-action/animated version of Alice in Wonderland (in a similar fashion to his Alice Comedies) that would star Ginger Rogers as Alice and utilize the recently developed sodium vapor process. However, Walt soon realized that he could only do justice to the book by making an all-animated feature, and in 1946, work began on an all-animated version of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nShe was also mentioned in Who Framed Roger Rabbit during Roger's version of the song \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\", as well as in the Agent Carter episode \"A Sin to Err\"."
