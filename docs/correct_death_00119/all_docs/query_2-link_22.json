        "text": "Ginger Rogers' ranch-style home in Medford, Ore., is for sale at $485,000. She died in April at age 83.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor (Kitty Foyle, 1940), who made 10 movies dancing with Fred Astaire, had owned the home since 1990, when she sold her nearby ranch, which she had owned since the 1930s.\n\nThe 3,400-square-foot home, in the Dark Hollow Pioneer Hills area, is on a 4-acre site with a gated entry. The asking price includes a 5.6-acre parcel of land next door.\n\nThere are four bedrooms in the main house, built in 1976 and upgraded in 1985, and there is a 2,600-square-foot deck with a swimming pool in the center.\n\nThe deck has views of the Rogue River Valley pastureland and city lights. There is also a 2,000-square-foot building with an office.\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers, probably best known as Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester on TV's long-running M+A+S+H, has listed his house in the Newport, Ore., area at $850,000. He wants to move inland to be closer to his parents, said listing agent Harriette Small. \"He's looking in the Willamette Valley,\" she said.\n\nStiers, 52, plays Judge Winton Myers in the Andy Garcia-starring romance/comedy Steal Big, Steal Little, released in September. He was the voice of Wiggins and John Ratcliffe in Pocahontas (1995) and was the narrator and voice of Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast (1991).\n\nStiers' all-cedar home has three bedrooms in about 2,000 square feet on nearly 3 acres facing the ocean."
