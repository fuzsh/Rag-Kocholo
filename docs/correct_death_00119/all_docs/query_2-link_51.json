        "meta_description": "Our July film series salutes the exquisite Ginger Rogers. Though best remembered as Fred Astaire’s dancing partner, her career spans from the heyday of vaudeville in the 1920s to the modern era; she even made an appearance on television’s Love Boat in 1979. After making 73 films and numerous stage appearances, she was honored at the Kennedy Center in 1992, three years before her death.She plays a struggling dancer in Stage Door, the classic 1937 drama about life inside a theatrical boarding house where young actresses pursue their dreams. Another great dancer of the era, Ann Miller, plays Rogers' onstage partner. Katharine Hepburn stars as Terry Randall, the seasoned and superior actress whose arrival is not greeted warmly. The movie is based on a play by Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman. 1 hr 32 minutes Directed by Gregory La Cava.",
