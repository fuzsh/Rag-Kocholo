        "text": "Rancho Mirage soon might be home to the first 3-D printed, fully sustainable housing community “in the world,” according to project developer Basil Starr, CEO of Beverly Hills-based Palari.\n\nThe planned 15-home development will feature 1,450-square-foot three-bedroom, two-bath models, many with a 700-square-foot two-bedroom, one-bath casita.\n\nEach has solar panels so that “all of the energy consumed is generated on that home,” Starr said.\n\nThe homes would be built on 8,000- and 10,000-square-foot lots, each with a private swimming pool and deck. Prices would be $595,000 for the one home or $850,000 for the house and casita.\n\nThe company purchased 5 acres of vacant land in Rancho Mirage at the end of 2020, in the area of Key Largo Avenue and Ginger Rogers Road, next to an equestrian center.\n\nRancho Mirage spokesman Gabe Codding said Friday that plans for the development have not been formally submitted to the city.\n\n“There have been a few calls to the city’s Department of Development Services to discuss the concept and see if the city would consider (such a housing) project,” Codding said, but “we have no further details &mldr; at this time.”\n\nStarr said Palari has retained MSA Consulting planning, civil engineering and surveying firm in Rancho Mirage to work with the city and expects that a formal application process will start in April.\n\nA pop-up show unit is on site, Starr said, and presales have been better than expected.\n\n“We’ve taken more reservations now than we have homes &mldr; and have started a waiting list,” Starr said.\n\n“We’d love to have a second development in Rancho Mirage and a third one in Palm Springs,” he said.\n\nMany of the potential buyers are millennials purchasing their first home, Starr said. Others are people living in the Los Angeles area interested in a vacation home in the Coachella Valley.\n\n“We also have a few locals who are looking at either to trade or downsize their homes into a new home,” Starr said.\n\nDon't miss out: Get full digital access to The Desert Sun for $39 per year; save up to 76% on print delivery plan\n\nHow houses are printed\n\nTraditionally homes are built using wood frame construction, which generates a lot of waste, Starr said.\n\nTypical construction sites generate 20% to 30% of waste of lumber or drywall materials that have to be cut down to the size needed for the home being built, Starr said.\n\n“That’s why we focused on 3-D printing, because it’s transformational,” Starr said. “I truly believe this is the way that homes will be built in the future because we are eliminating nearly all of that waste, 99% to be precise.”\n\nThe houses are built using 3-D panels created and printed at Mighty Buildings in Oakland, Starr explained.\n\nPanels are 4 feet by 9 feet, including exterior and interior finish and insulation in between, Starr said.\n\nThey are essentially prefabricated homes made with 21st Century technology, he said.\n\n“Then the panels get shipped to site and assembled kind of like Lego blocks, making it an installation rather than a construction on site,” Starr explained.\n\nAbout Starr and Palari\n\nStarr founded Palari in 2014 as a real estate consultancy firm.\n\n“Eventually, I grew the company into a development firm and started doing traditional renovations and constructions,” Starr said. “I was very interested in finding new technologies and how to innovate housing space.”\n\nHe began researching modular construction and visited more than 20 factories that make prefabricated homes.\n\nWhile they reduce the amount of waste created with traditional housing construction, Starr said, 3-D printing was transformational. He partnered with Mighty Buildings in Oakland, which has patented its technology for 3-D printed homes.\n\nThis is Palari's first planned development. Sales until now have all casitas for homeowners all over California wanting to add an accessory dwelling to their property.\n\nIn looking for a place to build his first 3-D printed housing development, Starr said he chose Rancho Mirage because of availability and cost of land.\n\n“Initially, we looked at Palm Springs &mldr; but it was difficult to find land,” Starr said.\n\nMore information about Palari and the planned Rancho Mirage development can be found at palari.com.\n\nDesert Sun reporter Sherry Barkas covers the cities of La Quinta, Indian Wells, Rancho Mirage and Palm Desert.
