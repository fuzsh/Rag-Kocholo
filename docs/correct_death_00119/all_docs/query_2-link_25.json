        "text": "Post AH\n\n“BADINDA!” “No, honey. Virginia.” “Badinda!” You know what kids are like. They set their mind on something and that’s that. Now, when toddler Helen couldn’t pronounce her big cousin’s first name, Virginia, she instead called her Badinda, which, I agree, is utterly, utterly adorable. Now, on the face of it, Badinda doesn’t sound THAT much like Virginia, but put on an American accent and actually… aww, how sweet. Sadly, Helen, being a toddler, got bored with Badinda and shortened THAT to Ginga. One thing led to another and, long story short, Ginger Rogers was born. Never her legal name, granted, but a fun happening regardless. Happens all the time, don’t you know. Thank heavens the world never experienced Derrick Presley…\n\nVirginia Katherine McMath (McMath! That’s phenomenal!), better known by her stage name Ginger Rogers, was born on July 16th, 1911, in Independence, Missouri. Yes. Americans really know how to name places. If it’s not after somewhere in the UK, it’s probably Independence. Or Freedom. Hmm. She was an only child of Lela Emogene. God, these names are wonderful today! I can literally keep going with them all day. Her grandparents were named Walter Winfield Owens and Wilma Saphrona. Sadly, her actual parents were a bit nuts.\n\nHer parents separated shortly after she was born and despite attempts to get back together, Ginger’s father tried to kidnap her. TWICE. So Lela thought it best to get a divorce. Hard to disagree with her. Lela soon moved to Hollywood, like everyone seemed to in the olden days, to become a BIG star in the movie biz. This left Ginger in the care of her wonderfully named grandparents, all the while, against all odds, Lela had become a scriptwriter for Fox. Back when they were good.\n\nLela remarried when Ginger was nine. John Logan Rogers. Ginger took her new father’s name, but never legally. The new family moved to Fort Worth where Lela became a theatre critic. Ginger had contemplated becoming a teacher, but Lela’s fascination with Hollywood had rubbed off on her daughter. Legend has it that, one day whilst waiting for her mother in the wings of the Majestic Theatre, Ginger joined in with a rehearsal – singing and dancing. The performers were quite impressed. Dancing really was her thing…\n\nAs could only happen in the olden days, one day, a travelling vaudeville troupe came to Fort Worth but after a late cancellation, they needed a stand-in. So they held a competition and Ginger entered, wowing the judges with her Charleston. I mean, it really is the olden days. In 1926, she joined the troupe and travelled ACROSS America for some six months. It was on tour when Ginger met Jack Culpepper. Yes. Culpepper. What a great day.\n\nHe was everything a 17-year-old girl could ever need. Singer. Dancer. Comedian. Recording artist under the name Jack Pepper. You know, the type of guy that makes the rest of us look like crap. Ginger had met Jack before, back when he was Ginger’s cousin’s boyfriend. Together, Ginger and Jack formed the vaudeville double act known as Ginger and Pepper. They married. But, as is often the way with teenage love, they separated after only a few months…\n\nIn 1929, Ginger and the vaudeville troupe she had gone back to HIT New York City with great eagerness. Ginger got by singing on the radio and she even made her Broadway debut on Christmas Day, 1929. Top Speed. That was the performance. I wonder if it was anything like Top Gun. Hmm. She was so good she caught the eye of legends George and Ira Gershwin. Suddenly, 19-year-old Ginger found herself rehearsing for a new Broadway play, Girl Crazy… under the choreography of one Fred Astaire! She was like… super-psyched.\n\nThings were going rather well for her and it’s hardly a surprise. She appeared in her first movie in 1929, Night in the Dormitory, and then another… in 1929. A Day of a Man of Affairs. And another. In 1929. Campus Sweethearts. In 1930, Paramount Pictures snapped her up for a seven-year contract. She was that good. But she was restless. So, she got out of the contract and moved to Hollywood with her mother. Where she made the cheery number, Suicide Fleet.\n\nPictures with Fox, Warner Brothers, Universal, Paramount and RKO soon followed. Her star was rising DRAMATICALLY. And that was just on the big screen. Fred Astaire was so enamoured with her the duo made nine musical films for RKO, giving birth to one of Hollywood’s all-time great partnerships. Their elegance and virtuosity was unlike anything Hollywood had seen before, revolutionising the song and dance numbers in Hollywood… forever.\n\nPeople had fallen in love with Ginger Rogers. Audiences queued for hours and hours to see her perform. Ginger was juggling a hundred and one different things but Fred always said that he greatly admired her ‘consummate professionalism’ in the face of such a heavy workload. “All the girls I ever danced with thought they couldn’t do it, but of course, they could,” Fred said shortly before he died. “So they always cried. All except Ginger. No, no, Ginger never cried.” The critics were dumbstruck by Ginger’s performances.\n\n“As a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realise that acting did not stop when dancing began… the reason so many women have fantasised about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable.”\n\nAt first, Ginger was paid much less than Fred… and most of the rest of the cast of the films they did together. She was pissed off! Like I am when people think one rasher of bacon is acceptable in a sandwich. It’s three or more, certainly no less, darn it. Ginger wrote an angry letter to the studio bosses and fought hard for her contract and salary rights. Also for better films and scripts. Ooh, that’s gotta hurt…\n\nRKO was facing bankruptcy and the studio tried to use Ginger and Fred to save the company. But all efforts failed. Despite that, Ginger was on the road to becoming one of the most famed stars of the golden age of Hollywood. Her range and her talents were incredibly impressive. She won an Academy Award in 1940 for best actress for her role in Kitty Foyle. When RKO fell, Ginger became a free agent and it suited her very well.\n\nThe 1940s were good to her. Tender Comrade, Lady in the Dark, Week-End at the Waldorf. By 1945, she was the highest-paid performer in Hollywood. Man or woman! She married her third husband, Jack Briggs, a marine and actor, in 1943. Her career was at the highest peak it would ever reach, reunited with Fred Astaire in The Barkleys of Broadway in 1949. However, when Jack returned from World War II, he had lost interest in acting and so Ginger lost interest in him. The two drifted and, in 1949, Ginger filed for her THIRD divorce…\n\nAt the age of 42, Ginger married again. This time, to 26-year-old Jacques Bergerac and oh my God… THESE NAMES ARE SO COOL! He was a French actor who Ginger met in Paris. She convinced him to move to America with her, which he did. They soon divorced. Jacques was a drunk. The two had started a film company but Jacques wasted away all their money, causing their Jamaican adventure to end. Oh, it was in Jamaica, that film company. For… reasons. But don’t worry! Ginger remarried shortly after. William Marshall. She was going through husbands like I go through pigs in blankets.\n\nHer career would never hit the heights of the 1940s ever again. Things tumbled down a steep hill for her in the 1950s, but her pictures Storm Warning, staring Doris Day and… Ronald Reagan? Really? His bow had two strings? Well, one intact and one that snapped. Storm Warning was well-received, proving Ginger still had it. Monkey Business, too, went down well, also staring Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe. What a cast! She starred in many more movies throughout the 1950s…\n\nShe also headed back to Broadway, baby. Hello, Dolly! of 1965 was critically acclaimed. She remained good friends with Fred, each receiving Academy Awards in 1967, together. The standing ovation went on for quite a while. They even put on a little impromptu dance number, which was really, really sweet. Hello, Dolly! ran for quite a while and, in 1969, she landed herself in another long-running production, Mame. That was in London. She arrived on a boat in Southampton and the crowds were in their thousands to greet her. Her performance garnered much praise, even from Queen Elizabeth II. She was 54, now. Ginger. Not Queen Elizabeth. Even the lizard people aren’t that old.\n\nGinger started making more and more appearances on television, right up until 1987’s Hotel. This was her last screen appearance as an actress. In 1992, the Kennedy Center honoured Ginger and soon, she even had a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1994, Independence made Ginger’s place of birth a Historic Landmark Property. And it really was her place of birth. Lela refused to give birth in a hospital after losing a previous child in hospital. God, I hope they cleaned up…\n\nOn July 16th, 1994, Ginger and Roberta Olden, her secretary, visited Independence to appear at the Ginger Rogers’ Day celebrations the city had put on her for her 83rd birthday. Ginger was now in old age and the officials on the day said to her that she could stay as long as she wanted and do as little or as much as she could manage. She insisted on unveiling the plaque on the wall of her childhood home. Then they told her that a few people wanted some autographs. Whatever you can manage, Ginger. How many do you think she signed? Well, we don’t know exactly, but certainly at LEAST 2,000. 2,000! To this day, every July, Independence holds the Ginger Rogers Day Festival.\n\nGinger made her last public appearance on March 18th, 1995. She accepted the Women’s International Center Living Legacy Award. She had planned to make more appearances but a stroke left her partially paralysed and wheelchair bound. She never went to a doctor or even a hospital, in accordance with her beliefs. On April 25th, 1995, Ginger Rogers died at her Rancho Mirage home at the age of 83. She died of a heart attack.\n\nWholesome, talented and sexy, as well as forthright and vulnerable, Ginger Rogers was one hell of a woman. Honest and energetic, one of the finest performers the world has ever known. She always said she was never a great actress but her ability to sing and dance was unparalleled. She’s fondly remembered with great affection, and not just because Rogers and Astaire were the greatest dance team of all time. Ginger got to where she got to in life riding on the crest of a vaudevillian wave that she forged from the fires that illuminated her soul. She might not be the household name of some of the stars of the golden age of Hollywood, but my God, she was one of hell of a human being.\n\nWho could’ve easily been called Badinda Rogers, let’s not forget…\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nImage (Click on It to Enlarge)\n\n1) Ginger Rogers.\n\n(credit: cinenthusiast.wordpress.com/tag/joan-blondell/)\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on this post.
