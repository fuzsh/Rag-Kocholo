As the lineup enters late-night/early tomorrow morning, it features a couple of the more exploitative and raunchy and/or violent, yet still fun, Corman productions. There is 1974’s Caged Heat, a women-in-prison film written and helmed by Jonathan Demme in his directorial debut. The lineup concludes with Piranha (1978), directed and co-edited by Joe Dante.
