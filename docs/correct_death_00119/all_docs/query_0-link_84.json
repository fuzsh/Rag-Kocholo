        "text": "Ginger holding her oscar for Kitty Foyle\n\n\"I believe in living each day as it comes, to the best of my ability. When it`s done, I put it away, remembering that there will be a tomorrow to take it`s place.\" - Ginger on her philosophy of life.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Ginger Rogers still has as much appeal as when she was in her prime. Still, most people remember Ginger for being Fred Astaire’s dance partner throughout the 1930's. But Ginger had acting talent that went beyond that. She was a fantastic and graceful dancer, but she should be remembered as so much more. She could make a fantastic screwball comedy, and then turn around and make a melodrama, giving great performances in both.\n\nShe stopped dancing with Fred in 1939 with The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (they’d re-team just once more, ten years later, for The Barkleys of Broadway) to focus on a career in non-musical films. Almost immediately her talent was recognized and she won an Academy Award for her performance in the 1940 film Kitty Foyle. Unfortunately, though, so many of her sans-Fred films aren’t remembered today. Here are some worth seeing. Note: In 1940, Ginger went from being blonde to her original, dark chestnut red hair color, hoping that the contrast would help her gain more serious roles. It worked.\n\n42nd St. (Director Lloyd Bacon,1933)\n\nThe much copied musical about a newcomer (Ruby Keeler) trying to make it big on Broadway. Ginger plays Ann \"Annytime Annie\" Lowell, a chorus girl always ready with a quip or two. She and pal (Una Murkel) add great comic flare.\n\nStage Door (Gregory La Cava, 1937)\n\nAlmost all the action takes place at a boardinghouse for women called The Footlights Club, where aspiring actresses are trying to make it in show business, sharing their triumphs and heartaches. The all star cast includes Ginger, Katherine Hepburn, Lucille Ball, Eve Arden, Ann Miller, Gail Patrick, and Jack Carson. And Ginger holds her own with every single one of them, including her scenes with Katharine Hepburn who plays the rich girl determined to make it on her own as an actress, but Ginger steals the show as her tough, sarcastic roommate.\n\nPrimrose Path (Gregory La Cava, 1940)\n\nThe same year she gave her award winning performance in Kitty Foyle, she gave an equally moving performance in Primrose Path, as the daughter of a prostitute who tries to escape her life by marrying Joel McCrea. This is one of the most beautiful love stories put out by the studio system. It’s about the importance of honesty in a marriage. It’s surprising that this film got past the Production Code, not just because it featured characters who were clearly prostitutes, but because these characters were sympathetic. Marjorie Rambeau (who received an Oscar nomination for the role) played Ginger's mother and a basically good woman simply doing what she was taught in order to support her family. Her relationship with Ginger is gentle: She only wants the best for her children. Primrose Path is a really brave film for the time it was made, and one worth seeing.\n\nRafter Romance (William A. Seiter, 1933)\n\nRafter Romance is a simple but incredibly sweet and pretty funny romance. Ginger and Norman Foster play two people who share an apartment – he lives there during the day, she lives there at night. They never meet, but they still can’t stand each other. Of course, they meet outside of the apartment, not realizing the other is the person they believe they can’t stand, and they fall in love. This is definitely one of the most original romantic comedies of the early 1930's.\n\nRomance In Manhattan (Stephen Roberts, 1935)\n\nIt’s amazing that such a simple romantic drama/comedy can be so moving. Francis Lederer plays an immigrant who is in the country illegally. He’s taken in by Ginger and her kid brother. It’s really as simple as that. The three just try to make a living and stay afloat while Lederer and Ginger fall in love. It’s a sincere and genuine romance, made with so much heart from all involved. And it has one of the funniest finales ever.\n\nStar of Midnight (Stephen Roberts, 1935)\n\nStar of Midnight is a Thin Man knockoff. It’s central mystery is really very interesting, and it has a certain “strange” feeling that I think sets it apart from other screwball mysteries. Powell stars in this (and he’s great, as always) with Ginger as his much younger and very eager love interest. She goes after everything with determination and vigor, whether it’s trying to solve the case or trying to get Powell to marry her.\n\nVivacious Lady (George Stevens, 1938)\n\nVivacious Lady is a sweet romantic comedy made great by the brilliant pairing of Ginger and James Stewart. They both had an “everyman” feel to them, which made them an incredibly relatable couple. You want so badly for them to be happy together because they’re so normal and remind you of yourself. I also like that it’s not really a movie about two people falling in love. They get married early on in the film. The movie is about them trying to break the news to his family, and staying together while they do it.\n\nBachelor Mother (Garson Kanin, 1939)\n\nThis is one of Ginger’ s very best performances. She plays a woman who has to raise an orphaned baby she finds on her own because nobody believes it’s not hers. In the meantime, she begins to fall in love with David Niven, her boss’s son who takes an interest in caring for the baby as well. This movie is so great because, in addition to the great romance between Ginger and Niven, it’s wonderful to watch Ginger's love for the baby that’s not even hers, grow. It’s one of the most interesting and beautiful relationships in film.\n\n5th Avenue Girl (Gregory La Cava, 1939)\n\nWalter Connolly plays a wealthy man who is ignored by his family. When he meets Ginger on a park bench he takes her in and the two pretend they’re having an affair in the hopes that the family will finally pay attention to what he’s doing. Ginger and Connolly bond and form a really nice father/daughter relationship that’s the heart of the movie. But the movie has three love stories going on. Throughout the film, Connolly and his wife eventually find their way back to each other. Connolly’s daughter is in love with the chaufer, who seems to be something of a communist. The best love story, though, is that of Ginger and Connolly’s son.\n\nTom, Dick, and Harry (Garson Kanin, 1941)\n\nWith Burgess Meredith\n\nGinger plays a character in Tom, Dick, and Harry who is a little more flighty than most of her other characters. She dreams of romance and love, but can’t choose between three different guys: the regular guy who’s working his way up to management at a local store(George Murphy), the millionaire(Alan Marshal), and the poor, but good reamer(Burgess Merdith.) The best part about this movie is that each of the guys has their pros and their cons, and you really have no idea who she’ll choose in the end.\n\nTales of Manhattan (Julian Duvivier, 1942)\n\nIn this series of loosely connected vignettes, Ginger has one of the best stories. It’s a short, self contained story about Ginger finding out her fiancee is a cad and realizing his pal, Henry Fonda, is perfect for her. It’s short, sweet, and funny. And Ginger and Fonda are great together. Watching this, it’s hard to believe they never made any other films together.\n\nI’ll Be Seeing You (William Dieterle, 1944)\n\nA soldier suffering from battle fatigue (Joseph Cotton) meets a young woman named Mary Marshall (Ginger) on Christmas furlough from prison and their mutual loneliness blossoms into romance.\n\nWhile there were a lot of movies being made during WWII to spread patriotic propaganda, I’ll Be Seeing You was one of the first films to really take a look at the negative effects the war was having on the soldiers. This movie gives us two incredibly flawed, complicated, and damaged characters and allows them to fall in love. A personal favorite of mine.\n\nSome Ginger Rogers Facts\n\nHer great-great-grandfather was a doctor who discovered quinine, the cure for malaria. One of the celebrities whose picture Anne Frank placed on the wall of her bedroom in the \"Secret Annex\" while in hiding during the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam, Holland. Ginger was married five times.

Author Graham Greene always said he would have liked Ginger to play the role of Aunt Augusta in the film version of his novel 'Travels With My Aunt' [when the film was made in 1972 the role was played by Maggie Smith]. Ginger didn't like alcohol and had an ice cream fountain installed in her house. Ginger was 5 feet 4 1/2 inches tall.

Was asked to replaced Judy Garland in both the movies Harlow (1965/II) (which was filmed in eight days) and Valley of the Dolls (1967). She turned down \"Dolls\" because she hated the script; she did, however, do the quickie version of \"Harlow\" and, unlike the movie, garnered good reviews as Harlow's mother. Is one of the many movie stars mentioned in Madonna's song \"Vogue\" Always the outdoor sporty type, she was a near-champion tennis player, a topline shot and loved going fishing. A keen artist, Ginger did many paintings, sculptures and sketches in her free time but could never bring herself to sell any of them. Her favorite film was \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". Directed her first stage musical,'Babes in arms', at age 74 She made her final public appearance on 18th March 1995 (just five weeks before her death) when she received the Women's International Center (WIC) Living Legacy Award. During the last years of her life she bought a ranch in the Medford, Oregon area because she liked the climate. She donated money to the community and funded the Craterian Ginger Rogers Theater in downtown Medford, which was named after her. Ginger is buried only a few yards away from screen partner Fred Astaire, at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth, CA."
