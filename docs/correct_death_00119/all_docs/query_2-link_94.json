        "text": "Hi all! It’s been a while since I’ve done ANY post not related to a Blogathon, or a Genre Grandeur. Sometimes the world of being creative puts you in a funk, and you do other things. I started talking about Classic Rock (I’m talking KISS, AC/DC, Def Leppard, etc) on YouTube and its really fun! But Classic Film Blogging has always been my real first love in terms of creatively. I’m not going anywhere anytime soon!! (In fact I think doing music reviews has helped me in terms of doing movie reviews)\n\nSo for my first original post in a great while, because I’ve just lately been re-watching a lot of their movies, I’ve decided to do MY ranking of all 10 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies. Honestly I’m not a big fan of movie musicals, but something about Fred and Ginger’s just make me enjoy them. For one, its not so much of a spectacle, its more about the intimacy of the two dancing, which you don’t get in something like Singin’ in the Rain (1952).\n\nFred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made 10 movies in their film careers together. To summarize: Fred was born in 1899 in Omaha, Nebraska, and Ginger was born in 1911 in Independence, Missouri. Fred grew up performing in vaudeville with his sister Adele and they eventually went professional on Broadway, while Ginger at age 14 won a Texas state Charleston competition that won her a spot on the vaudeville circuit. She too eventually went to Broadway. Fred and Ginger first met in 1930 in New York for Girl Crazy: Ginger was the lead, Fred was brought in to help out with the choreography. It was confirmed by Ginger in her 1991 memoir the two dated for a brief spell in New York.\n\nEventually both of them went to Hollywood and the rest is history. The pair made 9 films in the 1930s at RKO Studios and then made one more movie in 1949 for MGM studios. While critics and fans have their mixed opinions on what is best and what’s not best, I will admit myself I don’t always agree, and want to voice my own opinion in such rankings.\n\nWithout further ado, I present to you, my Emily aka The Flapper Dame’s rankings of all 10 Astaire-Rogers Movies (warning minor spoilers ahead) :\n\n10 Roberta (1935): The third pairing for the two, and they are supporting characters in the narrative! This movie is difficult to watch because its so boring. Fred and Ginger dancing saves it (Lovely to Look At is very romantic, plus Ginger’s black dress is amazing!)- as does the presence of Irene Dunne but other than that- it has so many songs. Irene Dunne sings some operatic style numbers and it kills the pacing. I do LOVE Irene Dunne- but more so the comedic side of her acting. Plus if you’re looking for Fred and Ginger doing what they do best, this whole movie has too many supporting characters. Worth a look but don’t be alarmed if you find yourself looking at your phone or using the remote to either mute the opera singing and/ or fast forwarding the movie.\n\n9: Flying Down To Rio (1933): Their first movie ever they made together, so its famous for that, but for my personal taste it has too much Busby Berkeley influence, and is not really done to the Astaire-Rogers style. That being said, if you enjoy Busby Berkeley’s work, then this movie may work for you. Fred and Ginger play supporting characters to Delores del Rio and Gene Raymond, and have one magical dance number that changed everything: The Carioca. If not for that dance, Astaire and Rogers would not have been together, so that’s simply why I can’t rank this movie as dead last. Overall, an interesting look at pre-code Fred, Ginger, Delores del Rio, and Gene Raymond as performers. Ginger also sings Music Makes Me– and she was super sweet while doing it, so points for that as well!\n\n8: Follow the Fleet (1936). The fifth movie made in the series, Follow the Fleet has 3 things going for it: the music, the costumes, and the dancing. That’s it. Its slow in terms of storytelling and has Harriet Hillard playing the forgettable part of Ginger’s sister, Connie. While the duel romance plot with Bake and Sherry (Fred and Ginger) and Connie and Bilge (Hillard and Randolph Scott) was supposed to be fun, its boring and you don’t spend enough time with either couple long enough for it to be super cute. Still, Follow the Fleet has the standards Let Yourself Go and Let’s Face the Music and Dance. Its worth a watch for sure, but keep the remote nearby to fast forward.\n\n7 The Gay Divorcee (1934): Although their second movie, its their first real starring movie based on the Broadway play The Gay Divorce (which Fred starred in). In all honesty, I have to be really in the mood to watch this movie all because of the over stretched 17 minute number called The Continental. While I do say Fred and Ginger are super charming while dancing the number and they do sell the romance in their gestures towards each other, all of the in-betweens and cuts to excess dancers is over long and does drag out. With all that being said: Fred is too too cute for words in his pursuit of Ginger all throughout this movie. He is relentless in his flirting, his willingness to protect her from the co-respondent, his constant asking of her to dance with him. I don’t think he is more adorable in any other movie as he is here. And don’t forget the Night and Day number which is Fred and Ginger’s first real romantic dance!\n\n6: Top Hat (1935): Top Hat, number five, has the famous Cheek to Cheek number in it. The art-deco Venice set is also spectacular that it basically transforms you to a magical place. While the plot is a bit like The Gay Divorcee with its mistaken identity element, Top Hat I think is better because of the time devoted to developing Jerry and Dale’s (Fred and Ginger) relationship. They have more dances together than just the big number, as they have dances that explore their budding relationship like Isn’t this a Lovely Day.\n\n5: The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939): Their final movie of the 1930s, and ninth overall, I enjoy this movie because of the emotional depth Fred and Ginger bring to the portrayals of Vernon and Irene Castle. If you don’t like musicals, I would say this may be the place to start with Astaire-Rogers. There is dancing, but there are no “musical song and dance” numbers per say, as the dances are all recreations of Edwardian dances the Castles invented. It’s also cute to finally see Ginger be more flirty with Fred’s character in the courtship scenes, as she’s always a tad harsh towards him in other movies. To see Fred and Ginger play two people in love the whole movie through is a fresh change of pace, and I think the fact they did a serious drama legitimizes their acting skills as a duo.\n\n4: Carefree (1938): Number 8 gets ranked as my number 4. This one gets a bad rep for being not a real musical, but that element does not bother me, as this one offers the most comedy in any of the Astaire-Rogers movies. Its basically screwball with 4 musical numbers thrown in- and they are not even all that over the top, rather they are cute little numbers. The Change Partners dance is really the highlight here, although I Used to be Color Blind was billed as the bigger number. Change Partners to me, is one of the most romantic numbers they did, as I think it has more longing within it. I also do not discount The Yam, as I find Ginger to be really upbeat while singing it. All in all, this movie showcases more so the acting side of both Ginger and Fred. Those who say Fred was a weak actor who relied on dancing to carry his movies, are proven wrong with this movie. Furthermore, as Ralph Bellamy plays Ginger’s boyfriend/ fiance, its always fun to see him loose the girl, isn’t it?\n\n3: The Barkleys of Broadway (1949): It’s the final movie Fred and Ginger made together, but I put in near the top of my list. I adore in this one, the two are finally playing husband and wife. The plot so closely mirrors their real life working relationship when Dinah Barkley is offered a chance to star in a dramatic play, but that means breaking up her musical and dance partnership with her husband, Josh. It’s a bit predictable in terms of plot, however, because its Fred and Ginger, it’s absolutely fun to watch. It’s also sweet they get to kiss more in the this movie than any other one they did before. The highlight for me however is seeing the pair finally dance to They Can’t Take that Away from Me, and it’s totally perfect!\n\n2: Shall We Dance (1937): Number 7 in the series, I don’t understand the critics’ critique of this one at all. One thing I find enchanting is the misunderstanding plot works in favor of the romance in this movie, instead of against it. Fred and Ginger play Peter “Petrov”, a ballet dancer and Linda, a tap dancer. When Peter is seen spending time with Linda on an ocean liner sailing back to New York, the press believe they look so in love together, a rumor starts they are secretly married. Famous numbers include the roller skating Let’s call the whole thing off, They all Laughed, and Slap that Bass, as well as the first use of Fred singing They Can’t Take that Away from Me.\n\n1: Swing Time (1936): The sixth movie in the partnership, Swing Time has everything: Art-deco sets, beautiful costumes, musical standards, amazing dancing, and George Stevens directing. Personally for me, Swing Time holds the distinction of being the first ever Astaire-Rogers movie I ever knew existed. It was Spring 2006, I was in 4th grade and saw a picture of the Pick Yourself Up number in the Welcome to Kit’s World American Girl book. I never saw any couple look so glamorous, and I instantly loved Ginger’s dress! It wasn’t until I was 17, however, that I finally got to watch Swing Time for the first time. What captivated me upon first watch was the A Fine Romance number, it was Fred/ Lucky flirting without flirting, Ginger/Penny being disappointed without being disappointed, it was marvelous! And the door-kiss between them, in the dressing room, with Fred (Lucky) jumping over his chair like a school boy is so, so adorable!! Not to mention the costumes: Ginger’s white dress and the cape from Never Gonna Dance is a dress I’d like to be married in one day if I get married! Despite all the glamour and glitz, I can’t say this movie is perfect, as the blackface number (Astaire’s only blackface number of his career) Bojangles of Harlem should have been reworked or removed. There was no reason for the number to have blackface and the dance could have occurred without it.\n\nAs always, as I say with my rock reviews, its just my opinion and you should like what you like without my influence. Its just fun to see the fans opinions rather than legit critics, as fans are the ones who keep these movies relevant. (Thanks for reading!)"
