        "text": "Ginger Rogers began dancing as a child and won a Charleston contest at 14, which put her on the vaudeville circuit. Her success took her to Broadway in 1929, where she received flattering notices despite Top Speedâs short run. At the same time she was making her (full-length) film debut in Young Man of Manhattan. In 1930 she starred in the Gershwinsâ Girl Crazy where she made a hit introducing âEmbraceable Youâ and âBut Not for Me.â\n\nWhen the show closed she went to Hollywood and, after nearly 20 films, was paired with Fred Astaire in Flying Down to Rio. The pair was such a hit, even though they did not star in the movie, that they made eight more mostly stunning films together as headliners. Rogers also starred in several noteworthy comedies: Star of Midnight (1935) with William Powell, The Major and the Minor (1942) with Ray Milland, and Monkey Business (1952) with Cary Grant. Her dramatic roles were equally fine: Stage Door (1937), with an all-star cast; Kitty Foyle (1940), for which she won a Best Actress Oscar; and Weekend at the Waldorf (1945), a remake of Grand Hotel.\n\nRogers took on Broadway again, revitalizing Hello! Dolly in 1965 and taking Mame to London for a 14-month run in 1969. She was a frequent guest on television, an accomplished painter and sculptress, and an award winning tennis player and skeet shooter. Her inimitable âlittle girlâ voice is remembered fondly (by those old enough to recall) in her early 1940âs recording of Alice in Wonderland. In 1992 she received the Kennedy Center award for lifetime achievements."
