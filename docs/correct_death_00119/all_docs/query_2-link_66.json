        "text": "Profession: Actress and Dancer\n\nBiography: Ginger Rogers was an American actress, singer, and dancer, best remembered for her on-screen partnership with Fred Astaire in a series of 10 Hollywood musical films. Their pairing has become one of the most iconic in the history of American cinema, lauded for the effortless grace and impeccable timing they brought to their intricate dance sequences.\n\nRogers began her career in vaudeville and on Broadway in the 1920s. Her film career took off in the 1930s when she was paired with Astaire in Flying Down to Rio (1933). The duo's chemistry was apparent, and their dance sequences, often featuring innovative choreography and stunning sets, were the highlight of their films. Some of their most celebrated works together include Top Hat (1935) and Swing Time (1936).\n\nDespite the fame and success she garnered with Astaire, Rogers was determined to prove herself as a versatile actress. She achieved this in films like Kitty Foyle (1940), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Here she demonstrated her dramatic abilities, firmly establishing her credentials beyond her dancing roles with Astaire.\n\nRogers continued to act in films and on television well into the 1960s, and she also returned to the stage on occasion, with a career spanned nearly five decades.\n\nBorn: July 16, 1911\n\nBirthplace: Independence, Missouri, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Pig\n\nStar Sign: Cancer"
