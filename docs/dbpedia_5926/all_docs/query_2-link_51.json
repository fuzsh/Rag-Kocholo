        "text": "Plaid Cymru are on the hunt for a new leader.\n\nAdam Price resigned on Wednesday evening - a week after a damning report into allegations of a \"toxic culture\" within the party.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd will take charge of Wales's main pro-independence party on an interim basis, pending approval from the party's national council on Saturday.\n\nAttention then turns to those who could succeed Adam Price permanently and the choice which may be put to party members in the summer.\n\nConstitutionally, Plaid Cymru leaders have to be members of the Senedd rather than parliament in Westminster, which rules out MPs Liz Saville Roberts and Ben Lake.\n\nBut who might put themselves forward?\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth\n\nAlong with Adam Price, Rhun ap Iorwerth challenged Leanne Wood for the party's leadership in 2018.\n\nHe is currently the party's health spokesperson in the Senedd and has been very vocal on the issues facing Betsi Cadwaladr - Wales's largest health board which was recently placed back in special measures.\n\nHaving been Senedd member for Ynys Mon since 2013, he is one of Plaid's more experienced members.\n\nBut there is one thing that may prove a stumbling block - he has been selected as Plaid's candidate for Ynys Mon for the next general election and could be heading to Westminster.\n\nIf he changes his mind, he might give the leadership race another shot.\n\nSian Gwenllian\n\nAs Plaid Cymru's deputy leader Sian Gwenllian has gathered extensive experience in a senior role.\n\nShe has been Senedd member for Arfon since 2016 and 2021's election doubled her majority, as she secured 63.3% of the vote - the highest percentage of any Senedd member.\n\nA leading figure in the cooperation agreement between Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Labour government, Ms Gwenllian is Plaid's lead designated member.\n\nHaving not stood for the leadership previously, could this be the moment Sian Gwenllian decides to go for the top job as the party looks to implement the recommendations of the Prosiect Pawb (Everyone's Project) report?\n\nElin Jones\n\nCurrently, the Llywydd (presiding officer) of the Senedd, Elin Jones could well decide to take on a different role.\n\nSky News understands Ms Jones would have to leave her post as Llywydd, which she has held since 2016, should she wish to become Plaid Cymru's leader.\n\nShe has represented Ceredigion in the Senedd since 1999 and is one of only four of the Senedd's original members who are still sitting.\n\nElin Jones recently declined an invitation to attend the King's coronation due to her republican views and her deputy attended in her place.\n\nShe has stood for the Plaid leadership before. In 2012, Ms Jones finished in second place to Leanne Wood in the party's leadership election.\n\nRead more:\n\nPlaid Cymru's 'son of destiny' whose future was not as his supporters hoped\n\nOthers\n\nOther names in the mix include Delyth Jewell, who is the Senedd member for the South Wales East region since 2019.\n\nThe remaining Plaid Cymru Senedd members were all elected in the 2021 election. The question for Plaid members will be whether they have the necessary experience to take the party forward."
