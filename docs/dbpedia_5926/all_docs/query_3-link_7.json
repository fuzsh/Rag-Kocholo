        "text": "The Llywydd invites party leaders to respond in the first Plenary session since the attacks.\n\nFormer First Minister, Mark Drakeford MS, says:\n\nAs we sit here in this Chamber, children, older people and the civilian population in Israel and in Gaza are in vivid fear for their lives, while grieving for those already lost. And the impact of those events is not confined to the streets of Israel and Gaza; they have a real impact here in Wales, in our own communities, and our thoughts are with all of those caught up in this enduring cycle of violence.\n\nA two-state solution is the policy of the UK Government and of the United Nations. Beyond the horror of the coming days, the international community must come together to work again for a lasting peace, a secure peace, a peace that reaches into the everyday lives of the Israeli and the Palestinian people. And hard as it is, and made harder yet by the war that continues to unfold, the only path to a better future has to be a path of peace.\n\nLeader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies MS, says:\n\nWe must all support Israel's right of defence and making sure that its international borders are recognised and, ultimately, protected. What we also must remember is that, as the First Minister highlighted, as we sit in this Chamber here today, there are people cowering in basements, in community settings because missiles and rockets are going off indiscriminately, both in Israel and the Gaza Strip.\n\nAnd it is something that we as a country, the United Kingdom, and the international community, and us here in Wales, must redouble our efforts on to bring peace to the communities that live in that part of the world, because without peace in the middle east, we do not have peace across the globe.\n\nLeader of Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, says:\n\nWe today think about everyone who has been affected directly by this, about the lives that have been lost, and we think of everyone of Israeli and Palestinian heritage in Wales who has been suffering while watching the events of the past few days.\n\nWe condemn the attacks by Hamas, and today we urge the international community to work together swiftly to persuade the relevant powers to introduce a ceasefire to allow the release of those held in Gaza against their will.\n\nWe also believe that the way that the Israeli Government has placed Gaza under siege, ceasing water and energy supplies, is impossible to justify. […] Worsening the violence is not the solution. The indiscriminate attacks on citizens will do nothing to alleviate tensions. The suffering facing ordinary people from all beliefs in this violent conflict have touched us all, and our thoughts are with each and every one of them in another dark chapter in the history of the region.\n\nLeader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds MS, says:\n\nWe fully condemn the terrorism of Hamas and Islamic jihad. I echo the comments of Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on foreign affairs, herself of Palestinian descent, who said that civilians must be protected, and that we are especially horrified to hear about hostage taking, and that we condemn all of the violence. This is sadly a significant escalation. The United Nations said:\n\nIn conflict, civilians always pay the highest price. War is not the answer. We need peace.\n\nTo finish, I hope and pray that all efforts from everyone, everywhere will concentrate on negotiations, peace, safety and protection of all caught up in this horrendous conflict.\n\nThe Llywydd closes by saying that each leader:\n\nhas made a plea for peace in the middle east this afternoon, reflecting all of our views, I'm sure, in that regard.\n\nThe former Minister for Social Justice, Jane Hutt MS, responds to the following written questions:\n\n1. On 5 March 2024, Heledd Fychan MS, tabled WQ91723:\n\nResponse:\n\nThe Welsh Government remains deeply concerned about the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Too many civilians – including many women and children – are being killed and an acute humanitarian crisis is unfolding.\n\nWe have successfully welcomed people seeking sanctuary from across the globe, including Palestinians who have become contributing members of Welsh society. As a Nation of Sanctuary, we would ensure Wales plays a full part in any Gaza resettlement scheme.\n\nI have asked UK Government Ministers on several occasions since October whether there will be a resettlement scheme. Most recently I asked this in a meeting alongside Scottish Government Ministers on 11 December.\n\nThe Welsh Government is in regular contact with UK Government to understand the situation but the UK Government has not made any commitment to a resettlement scheme for those from Israel-Gaza wishing to seek sanctuary.\n\nWe want to be proactive in supporting safe and legal routes for those who need our support but we can only do so within the parameters set by UK Government immigration routes.\n\n2.

On 5 March 2024, Sam Kurtz MS tables WQ91728\n\nResponse:\n\nWe are committed to embedding anti-racism within everything we do and have set out our ambitions in the Anti-racist Wales Action Plan.\n\nThe First Minister and I along with other Cabinet colleagues have met with leaders and members of the Jewish community multiple times since the start of the conflict on 7th October to offer our condolences to all affected by the current crisis and to hear from them about the impacts the current situation is having on our communities. We will continue to do so.\n\nFollowing discussions with both Jewish and Muslim faith leaders, in December 2023, I along with the Minister for Education and Welsh Language wrote to schools to highlight the statutory anti-bullying guidance 'Rights, Respect, Equality' for education settings and governing bodies to tackle prejudice-related bullying and harassment, including tackling Islamophobia and antisemitism. We also highlighted the availability of professional learning resources to support senior leaders, teachers and education practitioners in undertaking a dialogue around the conflict appropriately and tackling all forms of racism.\n\nThe Minister for Education and Welsh Language also wrote to colleges and universities regarding this issue.\n\nThrough our anti-hate crime campaign Hate Hurts Wales, we are raising awareness of religious hate, encouraging the reporting of it, and highlighting the supporting available via the Wales Hate Support Centre. We continue to fund the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust to deliver its important engagement work in Wales and raise the dangers of antisemitism and other forms of identity-based hate.\n\nThrough the Wales Faith Communities Form, co-chaired by the First Minister and myself, we work closely with faith representatives on matters affecting the social, economic and cultural life of Wales.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS leads a debate on Wales’s response to the conflict. Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, John Griffiths MS, Sioned Williams MS, Jenny Rathbone MS, and Mabon ap Gwynfor MS also contribute.\n\nThe new Cabinet Secretary for Culture and Social Justice, Lesley Griffiths MS, responds to the conflict’s key elements, detailed below.\n\nOn the Senedd’s ceasefire vote of 8 November 2023:\n\nIn keeping with convention […] Welsh Ministers abstained from the vote on that motion as matters of foreign policy are not devolved to Senedd Cymru. However, in the debate itself my predecessor, the Minister for Social Justice, was clear the Welsh Government wanted to see a full ceasefire as soon as possible. This position has been repeated in Plenary by both the First Minister and the former First Minister […].\n\nOn the Welsh Government’s latest position:\n\nThere must be a renewed sense of urgency amongst the international community to deliver a full and permanent ceasefire, ending the suffering on all sides as quickly as possible. As the First Minister said last week, there is a very real humanitarian crisis taking place. We sincerely hope all relevant partners ensure a significant and immediate increase in aid entering Gaza, agree to release all of the hostages, end the violence, and meaningfully engage in the development of a lasting two-state solution.\n\nIn closing, she adds:\n\nWe call again for a ceasefire, for an increase in aid, and for the hostages to be released.\n\nOn the scope of the Welsh Government’s role:\n\nIn Wales the challenge for us is identifying the influence we can have to help bring about the changes we all want to see, to stop the hatred and its consequences. The history and geopolitics of the region, as well as the continuing violence and the fact that foreign policy is not devolved, severely limits the scope of what we can do, despite our deep sorrow. […] Nevertheless, there are things we can and we are doing in Wales to support the communities living here who are affected.\n\nOn community cohesion:\n\nWe have been monitoring any community tensions relating to this conflict via our community cohesion programme, and monitoring any spikes in hate incidents via our Wales hate support centre. Although there have been some hateful incidents, thankfully these have been isolated, and we have not seen the spikes we feared.\n\nMinisters have met with Jewish and Muslim leaders to discuss the impacts of the conflict in Israel and Gaza on our communities here in Wales. We've encouraged inter-cultural solidarity and dialogue in partnership with our faith communities forum. To address any issues in schools, we were able to co-author a letter for schools, colleges and universities in Wales with the Muslim Council of Wales and the Board of Deputies of British Jews.[…]\n\nPrejudice and hate have no place in Wales. We expect allegations and incidents of racism and racial harassment to be fully investigated, with appropriate action taken to address the matter and prevent further incidents from happening.\n\nOn providing humanitarian aid:\n\nThe Welsh Government has made donations to a number of Disasters Emergency Committee appeals in recent years […] We have not been able to do this to alleviate some of the suffering in Gaza, because DEC has been unable to launch a campaign. At this time, DEC believes only a lasting ceasefire will enable its agencies the opportunity to effectively provide much-needed aid in Gaza. We continue to see proposals to increase maritime delivery and air drops for aid, which we hope will increase more effective aid. We will keep our position under review should DEC feel the criteria for an appeal can be met.\n\nOn working with the UK Government:\n\nThe Welsh Government is keeping in regular contact with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to understand UK efforts in relation to the conflict, and to understand any perceived impacts for Wales.\n\nThe First Minister committed to working with Members who may have constituents with family members who were victims on 7 October, or who are being held as hostages, to understand if further support is needed.\n\nOn refugees:\n\nSince 7 October, Welsh Ministers have asked UK Government Ministers about opportunities for resettlement from Gaza for those most in need. It appears to us there continues to be no current prospect of a Gaza resettlement scheme for the UK. […] [A]s a nation that aspires to be a nation of sanctuary, we would also aim to play a full part in any Gaza resettlement scheme if one was established.\n\nWe've been following the campaign for a Gaza family reunion scheme with keen interest. The Welsh Government already funds the British Red Cross to support family reunion, helping those with refugee status to bring their family members to Wales via a safe and legal route established by the UK Government. However, referrals to the project from Gaza are complicated by the barriers to exit Gaza. The painful history of the region affects the willingness of Palestinians to leave, and the willingness of neighbouring countries to permit entry. There is a clear concern that Palestinians may never be able to return if they leave now.\n\nWe have not called specifically for a Gaza family reunion scheme. Instead, we have called for a more progressive version of the UK family reunion scheme, which builds upon some of the successes of the now closed Ukraine family scheme. The Ukraine scheme supported 57,000 arrivals in a very short period, largely because the definition of 'family' was broad and application processing was quick. This same approach for Palestinians and others could have a very beneficial impact for the well-being and security of many families.\n\nFamily reunion is vital for any sanctuary seeker living in Wales, regardless of where in the world their separated family member is living. Our approach is to advocate for a family scheme that could support Palestinians or any other person who has found sanctuary here in Wales. And we will continue to call for this.\n\nThe First Minister speaks of the conflict at his annual evidence session on international relations with the Culture, Communications, Welsh Language, Sport and International Relations (CCWLSIR) Committee.\n\nJenny Rathbone MS asks the First Minister:\n\nto confirm that the Welsh Government is minded to give a substantial contribution to a Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal, if one is launched; and\n\nif consideration has been given to benefits in kind that could be contributed, such as construction expertise, particularly given a reduced international relations budget for 2024-25.\n\nThe First Minister responds:\n\nWell, I think you're right on both points, Jenny, that is that if the Disasters Emergency Committee launch an appeal, then we would expect to contribute.\n\nI'd have to be clear about needing to understand our budget position at the time in terms of what we could deliver. But there's more than cash and some of that will depend on what reconstruction and support looks like as well, and which partners you get to work with to do that. But in a range of areas, we've provided benefits in kind that aren't always about money—sometimes it's about equipment, sometimes it's about expertise.\n\nSo, I'd want to look at what we can do in a positive way. And this all comes back to when there is a period in time when we're able to do that, because at the moment, there isn't a permanent or sustainable ceasefire.\n\nWe know the issues about not getting enough aid in to the humanitarian crisis that unfolds before us. And we know that there are people who are still hostages. So, all of those things are very real challenges and we see them in lots of constituencies and regions across Wales where people have direct family, community and friendship links, so I look forward to having the opportunity to help in reconstruction and support.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS asks whether the 17.6% cut to the Welsh Government’s international development budget will impact its ability to donate to a DEC appeal. The First Minister responds that any budget reductions:\n\nwould affect our ability to provide money to this or any other DEC appeal. […] We don't know when an appeal might be launched. So, the honest truth is it will affect our ability, but I couldn't tell you how much or when, and that's because we don't yet know when a DEC appeal will be launched as well. That is part of the wider reality of our budgetary position.\n\nHe says that he has not had detailed conversations about contributions from Wales but that the Welsh Government has engaged with representatives of the Palestinian Authority and will engage with people from the Israeli Government in the UK as well.\n\nJenny Rathbone MS asks if there’s a role for the Welsh Government’s overseas offices in Dubai and Doha, to which the First Minister responds:\n\nI think needing to have an international coalition of goodwill is really important for the future, and it's also about how those relationships take place in a way that is respectful, rather than countries not from the region trying to take a leadership role in a way that may not be well received. So, I think we've got to have some sensitivity on all sides, and, actually, Dubai and Doha have been centres of actually trying to get people into conversations to mediate.\n\nNow, they of course have capital, but you've got to have the ability to invest that capital in a way in which the authorities running the territory want that to be done. Now, you have a challenge over who is actually in charge, the nature of the authority that exists, and that still comes back to what a peace will look like. So, we need to get to that point.\n\nBut that's why the aid is the first thing, because you need to make sure that people are able to get through the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding, and then to get to what the long-term goal is—and I wish it was not quite so long-term—but to get to the point where there really are two safe, sovereign states living alongside each other.\n\nNow, that's been the position of parties—plural—across the UK. It's the position of the Welsh Government and the UK Government, and I don't see that position changing with the general election.\n\nIt's how we're going to be on the side of bringing people to that answer sooner rather than later, and recognising that we, as we sit down today, are not in control of what is happening in Gaza and we have limited influence over the Government of Israel.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS asks how information is passed to the Welsh Government by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in relation to international disasters and affected individuals, and queries whether the Welsh Government could pass that information on to relevant Senedd Members so “we can all provide wrap around support”. The First Minister responds that the relationship is led by the UK Government, and describes how MPs, devolved agencies, local government and the third sector are often involved. He says:\n\n[W]ith the Foreign Office, there is some sharing of information, so there are times when we find out and are told if there are Welsh citizens who are engaged and involved.\n\nThe challenge, I think, always is: where does the awareness come from and then how do we something that is genuinely helpful for that person and their family? And that won't always be perfect, because the relationship will be different in different circumstances for the family and how they feel about communities, and who they'll want to have the conversation with as well. So, this isn't saying, 'The Senedd must always be engaged and involved', because that might not be what that person wants.\n\nBut where, actually, there is a role for us to play, we should be willing and want to do that and want be part of the conversation, and that's the way that I want to see relationships between the Welsh Government and the Foreign Office and other agencies work. Because the longer term support will undoubtedly engage our responsibilities as well."
