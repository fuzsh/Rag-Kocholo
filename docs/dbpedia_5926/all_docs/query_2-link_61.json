        "text": "Labour leads opinion polls for May 2021 Welsh election, does not support vote on secession\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price promised a referendum on independence within the next parliamentary term if his party “commands a majority” in the Welsh National Assembly after the May 2021 election.\n\nIn a Sunday Times article, Price said that the current devolution system cannot be considered an “end-state” as Westminster “will always reign supreme.” The independence leader warned that Wales “is in real danger” of remaining in a “rump United Kingdom” if Scotland and Northern Ireland secede.\n\nAccording to polls, Plaid Cymru has been holding in 2020 a voting intention of between 18% and 26%. Surveys predict another victory for the Labour Party, which does not support calling a referendum.\n\nThe Conservative Party, which is in government in the United Kingdom, does not favour a referendum either.\n\nSome 25% of Welsh voters say they support independence, while 50% to 55% reject it, according to polls. Some 20% to 25% are undecided.\n\nSupport for independence had for years stood at between 10% to 15%, but has grown since the Brexit referendum."
