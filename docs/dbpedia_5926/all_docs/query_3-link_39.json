        "text": "Browse our full #ProgrammeforGovernment series, published to date.\n\nAs we approach the halfway point of the Sixth Senedd we’re taking a look at what the Welsh Government has delivered since the 2021 election. We’ll be publishing a series of articles over the next three weeks that will follow the themes in the Welsh Government’s Programme for Government (PfG).\n\nThe PfG sets out the Welsh Government’s intentions for this Senedd (up to May 2026); the actions it intends to take, targets it wants to meet and legislation it expects to bring forward, among other things. It was first published in June 2021 and updated in December 2021 following the Co-operation Agreement with Plaid Cymru.\n\nThe PfG is structured around 10 ‘well-being objectives’, covering a variety of policy areas. Each well-being objective has a number of commitments (ranging from 8 to 14), which are the responsibility of the whole Welsh Government Cabinet due to their cross-portfolio nature. There are also a number of commitments (ranging from 7 to 50) resting with individual Ministers.\n\nAlongside the PfG, the Welsh Government published a well-being statement. This outlines how it has set its objectives in line with its statutory duty under the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.\n\nThe Welsh Government also publishes an PfG annual report, with the latest published in July 2023. It includes an annex detailing progress, as of 31 March 2023, against each of the 115 commitments that sit under the well-being objectives.\n\nThrough this series, we’ll publish articles covering each of the 10 well-being objectives. The articles will examine progress against key commitments and themes (although won’t explore each individual commitment). They’ll give an overview of the main issues arising so far this Senedd, as well as whether those issues have been addressed.\n\nArticles will be published over the next three weeks. Our first article will be published later today, which will look at the objective to “provide effective, high quality and sustainable healthcare”. Subscribe to Senedd Research to receive notifications on the articles as they're published.\n\nOur visual tool below enables you to explore the PfG and the commitments under each of the ten well-being objectives. It will be updated with links to articles once published.\n\nExplore the Programme for Government, its objectives and commitments"
