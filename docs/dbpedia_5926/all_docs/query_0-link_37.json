        "text": "Wales's Plaid Cymru party wants better funding for the NHS, more doctors and nurses, more beds, and a reduction in waiting lists.\n\nIt wants a third medical school campus in the principality to increase the number of “home grown” doctors and says it is totally committed to the NHS being free at the point of delivery.\n\n“We want an adequately funded NHS, with increased capacity, more beds, nurses, and doctors—we haven't got enough of any of them,” said the Welsh Assembly's Plaid Cymru health spokesman, Dr Dai Lloyd, who is also a GP for one session a week in Swansea.\n\n“We have some of the worst health statistics in Europe. We have 19% more heart disease deaths in Wales than England, yet coronary heart bypass numbers would need to double to get up to the per capita rate of England. We have 10% more cancers, and our life expectancy is a year less than England. We also have fewer consultants, less high tech equipment. The inverse care law is alive and well in Wales.”\n\nThe party's manifesto also calls for the retention of community health councils and the abolition of trusts.\n\nThe party also wants another medical campus in north Wales: “We have had only one medical school, although a second campus in Swansea is becoming a reality. Our policy is to have a campus in Bangor too. We don't produce enough doctors. Ireland, with the same population, has six medical schools, and Scotland has five,” said Dr Lloyd.\n\nThe party's manifesto says that public health needs a higher priority and wants better coordination between health and social care. One of the top priorities is health inequality, and it sees dealing with poverty as a way of tackling that issue.\n\n“We need greater awareness of the link between poverty and social disadvantage and illness. We need to realise that tackling poverty pays a hundredfold in terms of the welfare of the society as well as cost effectiveness,” says the manifesto.\n\nIt says that the NHS has suffered from underfunding and accuses the government of creating an illusion that more money is being spent. “There are also too many superficial measures such as health tsars, walk-in centres, and guaranteed waiting time that do not get to the root of the real problems,” it says.\n\nLabour, which has a majority of seats in the Welsh Assembly, promises in its manifesto for Wales more than 1000 extra nurses and at least 380 more doctors working for the NHS in the principality by 2004. It says it will also make tackling cancer, heart disease, and mental illness the priorities for investment and reform.\n\nA spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said that because many of the responsibilities for health were devolved to the Welsh Assembly, the party's overall policy on health was a national one."
