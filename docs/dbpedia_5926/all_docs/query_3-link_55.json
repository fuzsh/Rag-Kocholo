        "text": "This is an attempt to cover up the sex scandals within Plaid, their support for Labour's self ID for politicians plan and their failure to safeguard girls in Welsh schools. FiliA should sue, they legally are in the right and even if they don't get to go to this conference they get to go to the next one in autumn.\n\nBrilliant response from Wales-Women’s Rights Network\n\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them.\n\nWhen @PlaidCymru’s values lead them to cancel a worldwide feminist group @FiLiAcharity’s stall at conference, what are their ‘values’ actually worth?\n\nValues.\n\nBy way of reminder, this is the @Plaid_Cymru STILL embroiled in a misogyny and sexual harassment scandal.\n\nWho don’t want women who defend other women at their conference.\n\nAs these women don’t prioritise men’s feelings.\n\n‘Values’ didn’t prevent @Plaid_Cymru sending a new life peer to the Lords this week.\n\nEven though they claim to want to dismantle it.\n\nPresumably the presence of anyone with a different view there won’t make their life peer feel ‘unsafe’ enough not to take her seat.\n\n#Plaid24\n\nValues.\n\nA @Plaid_Cymru MP who assaulted his wife had the whip returned.\n\n#Plaid24\n\n^t.co/mFfO7q0Xxh^\n\nValues.\n\nA @Plaid_Cymru MS was not suspended until over a year had passed since these allegations were made.\n\n^t.co/ywXPRZdh9e^\n\nValues.\n\nThe report into their misogyny, sexual harassment and bullying scandal was damning.\n\nDo you actually think you’ve got to grips with this @RhunapIorwerth?\n\n#Plaid24\n\n^www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/03/damning-report-calls-on-plaid-cymru-to-detoxify-culture-of-harassment^\n\nCathy Larkman from WRN Wales said;\n\n“This disgraceful decision by Plaid Cymru to cancel the conference FiLiA stall starkly demonstrates the disconnect between their warm words on women’s rights and the actual hard reality within the Party”.\n\n#Plaid24\n\n“We have spoken to several Party members who are deeply concerned and at the point of resignation.\n\nThe assertion that anyone would feel ‘unsafe’ in the presence of women who campaign for worldwide rights for women is derisory and contemptible”.\n\nEvery @Plaid_Cymru\n\nmember should be asking serious questions of their Party at conference.\n\nHow can this Party seriously claim to care about women’s rights?\n\n@RhunapIorwerth\n\nWomen of Wales (and males who care) Plaid have shown you who they are - believe them.\n\nLet's hope this will help break the silence inside Wales.\n\nI think the contract for the conference exhibition space and associated passes constitutes provision of a service.\n\nPlaid have also put their reason for withdrawing that service in writing, making assertions without any evidence apart from the hearsay of a tiny number of party activists (that they seem to be shit scared of).\n\nPlaid are stuffed if FiLiA choose to pursue it. They need to stop ignoring this. It's not going to go away by pretending not to notice the outrage on twitter and digging an even bigger hole for themselves.\n\nWish the lily-livered Welsh media would start covering the story. Doesn't fill you with confidence about what they decide is newsworthy. Plaid Cymru has a woman problem and a damning report on misogyny in the Party has been published amid a load of waffle. Isn't that enough of a pattern for journalists to think maybe it's not women or FiLiA that are the problem, but the ingrained misogyny and oppressive culture of thought-policing rife within those running the party?\n\nThere are so many lifelong Plaid Cymu supporters who are furious about this. Women and men.\n\nOne of the saddest and most baffling things about the situation within Plaid Cymru is that some of the most enthusiastic TRA cheerleaders are women. Both Vichy feminists and vulnerable 'I'm not like those other girls' young women. The leadership pay too much attention to what a vociferous minority say will win votes and what policy positions are 'progressive'. A lot of this isn't on the older members' radar at all.\n\nWelsh media are still ignoring this story. Beginning to feel the situation may be hopeless in Wales. It would have been better if we could avoid the catastrophe that is coming, but Plaid and Welsh Labour seem determined to destroy more lives. I've no faith in Welsh Tories either but at least their desire to bash Welsh Government has led to them waking up."
