        "text": "The next prime minister of the United Kingdom will be Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of Plaid Cymru has said.\n\nIn a Panorama interview with Nick Robinson, Rhun ap Iorwerth predicted that Labour will win the election regardless of how Wales votes.\n\nHe asked Welsh voters to back the pro-independence party to prevent Labour from having a \"huge majority\" that would allow them to act with \"impunity\".\n\nIt comes after Conservative Grant Shapps warned Labour could win a \"supermajority\".\n\nIn the interview, Mr ap Iorwerth said he would like Wales to be able to set \"visa numbers to get more people into work\" in health and social care.\n\nThe party leader said people's anxieties on migration were being exploited, and said they should not be blamed for cuts to public services.\n\n\"Keir Starmer is going to be prime minister in four weeks time,\" Mr ap Iorwerth said.\n\n\"I think the evidence points in that direction.\n\n\"He will become prime minister regardless of how Wales votes. That's a key factor for people to consider in Wales.\"\n\n\"Would you like a huge Labour majority, that allows them to act with impunity and allows them to continue what they are doing now which is ignore Wales completely?\"\n\nHe accused some senior Welsh Labour Westminister figures \"who act as if they have forgotten they are representing Wales\".\n\nMr ap Iorwerth criticised the shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens, who said that Labour could not commit to a share of funding from the HS2 rail project.\n\nThe scheme is designated as being England and Wales, despite not reaching Wales, meaning Wales does not get extra money as a result from the project.\n\nThe Plaid Cymru leader said the party had a \"number of proposals for bringing in more tax\" and called for an \"honest debate\" on the issue.\n\n\"I want us to recognise first of all that tax is a good thing,\" Mr ap Iorwerth told the programme.\n\nHe said the UK needs \"taxes to be brought in\" to \"pay for public services\".\n\nThe Member of the Senedd for Ynys MÃ´n said his party's ideas included \"making sure that those oil and gas companies pay more of a windfall tax\", and that \"those who have huge amounts of wealth are targeted through a wealth tax\".\n\nBut he said he would not \"add to the burden\" on low and medium income earners.\n\nIn March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt extended a 35% tax on those companies â the Energy Profit Levy â until 2029.\n\nIt was introduced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused demand and prices to rise.\n\nPlaid Cymru wants Wales to be an independent state, but has abandoned a previous pledge for a referendum on independence by 2026.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth said his job was to \"get people interested, intrigued\" about what independence could mean.\n\n\"If we are to remove those shackles of child poverty, the economic stagnation that we've suffered in Wales, we have to take the levers of change into our own hands,\" he said.\n\nBut he said the country was \"not at that point quite yet\".\n\n\"We're within a UK system, we make a case for fair funding for Wales so we can make the right decisions on public servicers and growing the economy and so on that can lead us on a positive trajectory,\" the Plaid leader added.\n\nBut he said Wales \"cannot fulfil our potential as a country\" until it is independent.\n\nAsked if there should be a trading border with England, he said: \"Do I want that kind of barrier? Absolutely not.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru was in a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government until last month.\n\nIt had been working with ministers on a group of policies, including expanding free school meals and childcare.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth had ended the deal early in part because of the row over the first minister's leadership campaign donations.\n\nHe said when Vaughan Gething became first minister, he \"showed a change of direction, change in attitude towards the kind of radical things that we were trying to bring in through that co-operation agreement\".\n\nMr ap Iorwerth added: \"When there was a scandal on top of that [there were] too many distractions, it was time to go our separate ways.\"\n\nHe said the \"right thing to do would be for the first minister to stand down\".\n\nThe leader rejected suggestions that Plaid Cymru is a party for Welsh speakers.\n\n\"We're about all of Wales. We speak people's language on health, education and the economy, and that's the key thing,\" he said."
