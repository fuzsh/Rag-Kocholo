        "text": "As said previously, these manifesto articles are only going to focus on policies which are non-devolved – so won’t count education, health, social care, some aspects of transport, housing etc.\n\nWales, it’s us (Cymraeg – link; English – link)\n\nBrexit\n\nOpposes the current Withdrawal Agreement as negotiated by Boris Johnson.\n\nSupports a second referendum on Brexit and would campaign for a Remain vote.\n\nEconomy & Tax\n\nIncrease UK-wide capital spending by 1% of GDP, resulting in an additional £15billion for Wales over 10 years to invest in a “Green Jobs Revolution”.\n\nIncrease the Welsh Government’s borrowing limit from £1billion over five years to £5billion.\n\nCreate a publicly-owned Welsh Broadband Infrastructure Company to guarantee access to full-fibre broadband by 2025.\n\nScrap High Speed 2; opposes a third runway at Heathrow Airport – would demand a Barnett consequential if the projects continue in the next parliament.\n\nElectrify all major rail lines by 2030; build metro systems in Swansea Bay, north-east Wales (with the Chester depot being relocated to north Wales); reopen Carmarthen-Aberystwyth railway and open a cross-valleys railway from Porth to Pontypool.\n\nBan zero-hour contracts.\n\nWould keep corporation tax at 19%, would also seek to devolve it.\n\nIncome tax relief on pension income would be maintained at 20%.\n\nIncrease the higher rate of national insurance contributions from 2% to 4%.\n\nDevolve air passenger duty and have a Welsh-assigned proportion of VAT revenues.\n\nReplace the Barnett Formula with a needs-based funding system.\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nRecruit 1,600 additional police officers.\n\nExpresses support for Portugese-style decriminalisation of recreational drug use; focus police resources towards dealers and establish a Commission on reforming drug laws.\n\nReplace shorter prison sentences with community sentences; opposes the construction of any new “super prisons” in Wales.\n\nOverhaul how rape cases are handled, including a public information campaign on consent, proper resourcing of sexual assault referral centres and new guidance for the police, judges and magistrates.\n\nHate crime, including online abuse, should be treated as “a serious offence” by the police.\n\nIntroduce a register for repeat domestic abusers.\n\nReverse cuts to legal aid.\n\nImmigration\n\nReform the Settled Status application system to a registration system to ensure all EU citizens resident in the UK before Brexit has a right to permanent residence and full civic rights.\n\nEstablish a Welsh Migration Advisory Service to plug skills gaps and protect the NHS from staffing shortages.\n\nInternational students shouldn’t be counted in annual net migration targets.\n\nWork towards an EU-wide migration system with a fair allocation of refugees and asylum-seekers across member states; Wales should become a “Nation of Sanctuary”.\n\nEnvironment & Energy\n\nWales should be 100% self-sufficient in renewable energy by 2030; supports tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay, Cardiff and Colwyn Bay and an Usk barrage. Also supports an offshore windfarm off Anglesey.\n\nBan single-use plastics by 2030.\n\nDevelop a national green energy “atlas” to determine where energy projects would have the least environmental impact in Wales.\n\nEnd the importation of goods which contribute to deforestation and ban imports of soy, beef and other commodities which have been produced on illegally deforested land.\n\nSupports halting all offshore fossil fuel exploration; ban fracking and open-cast mining.\n\nPlant a minimum of 2,000 hectares on new woodland a year from 2020.\n\nPhase-out petrol and diesel cars by 2030; invest in an electric vehicle charging network.\n\nWelfare\n\nIntroduce a £35-per-week payment for households living below the poverty line.\n\nIntroduce a tax credit of £25-per-week for households paying more than 60% of their income on rent and for those paying more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities combined.\n\nMaintain the triple lock on state pensions.\n\nRepeal the Vagrancy Act.\n\nWould compensate WASPI women caught out by an increase in the state pension age.\n\nWill renegotiate the miners’ pension scheme to ensure a fairer proportion of the surplus is given to former miners.\n\nSeek devolution of some welfare payments including universal credit, disability benefits and discretionary payments; would scrap the bedroom tax.\n\nEmployers will be banned from making pregnant women redundant during pregnancy and until six months after they’ve returned from maternity leave.\n\nMaternity and paternity leave should be extended to take into account premature births.\n\nDefence\n\nWould scrap the Trident nuclear weapons replacement, saving £205billion over its lifetime.\n\nSeek to base Welsh army regiments in Wales.\n\nPrioritise improvements to UK cybersecurity.\n\nMilitary action should be authorised by all of the UK’s parliaments.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nEncourage nations to establish consulates in Wales; call for Welsh associate membership of UNESCO, International Maritime Organisation and Food & Agriculture Organisation.\n\nAny future trade deal after Brexit should uphold environmental and consumer protections, as well as workers rights, and protect the NHS from privatisation. Plaid will oppose any trade deal which doesn’t do these things.\n\nAll of the UK’s parliaments should be consulted and have a veto on future trade deals.\n\nUse foreign aid to support environmentally-friendly farming practices.\n\nConstitutional Reform & Miscellaneous\n\nSupports Welsh independence by 2030; establish an Independence Commission to develop proposals for a written Welsh Constitution and an economic case for independence.\n\nSupports devolution of criminal justice and broadcasting.\n\nReplace the House of Lords with an elected second chamber of the UK Parliament; would campaign to move the UK Parliament out of London and would cancel the £5billion restoration of the Palace of Westminster.\n\nWelsh will be a recognised nationality and can be included on official forms and passports.\n\nWould lower the voting age in UK Parliament elections to 16.\n\nMaintain free TV licences for the over-75s.\n\nMake St David’s Day a bank holiday.\n\nUphold the Human Rights Act.\n\nThe major faults are things that derail the manifesto, have been completely overlooked or are outright lies – including policies which are unachievable or sketchy at best.\n\nThe minor faults are more moderate errors, circular arguments, bombastic statements or policies which will be difficult to achieve in real life, make reference to devolved responsibilities or are otherwise confusing or poorly explained.\n\nMajor Faults:\n\nI accept this is a forerunner of the 2021 manifesto, but the number of references to devolved policy areas – from a party which knows full well they’re controlled from Cardiff – is pretty astonishing. Plaid Cymru are often the first to complain when the mainstream media muddles what’s devolved and what isn’t. Disappointing.\n\nThere are (some) costings, but they’re not particularly detailed.\n\nBased on Labour’s recent announcement, fully compensating WASPI women could cost anything up to £58billion – this hasn’t been factored in.\n\nMinor Faults:"
