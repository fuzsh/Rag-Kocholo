        "text": "Earlier this month, the cross-party Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales unanimously concluded that independence was a viable option for the country and offered the potential for “long term positive change”.\n\nHowever, the commission also warned that if urgent action wasn’t taken to devolve more powers to Wales – particularly in areas such as policing, justice and railways – then Welsh devolution would be at risk of collapse.\n\nIt also called for protections to be put in place to shield the country's powers from abuse by the UK Government.\n\nSpeaking ahead of a keynote speech on Wednesday, Rhun ap Iorwerth MS welcomed the report and called on the country’s Labour government to implement its recommendations immediately.\n\n“The report by the Commission was groundbreaking,” he said.\n\nREAD MORE: UK Covid Inquiry only follows 'DownWithTheSNP' on Twitter\n\n“It recognised that the status-quo is unsustainable and critically showed that independence is a realistic and achievable end goal.\n\n“It also shows that we are right to be ambitious for Wales, and that we should not constrain or put limits on that ambition.\n\n“We know that successive Welsh Labour governments have lacked ambition, too often happy to settle for the status quo and rarely looking to use the levers they have at their disposal to grow our economy, tackle the scourge of child poverty or deliver a health service that is fit for purpose.\n\n“We will never stop making the case for more powers, nor for greater and better use of them.\n\n“But our vision is far more ambitious than that. Every vote for Plaid Cymru in this year’s general election – whenever it comes – will be a vote to keep Westminster’s feet to the fire on fair funding for Wales, and to transfer further powers to Wales.\n\n“Devolution of justice, broadcasting and welfare are all key building blocks of a future independent Welsh state.”\n\nIorwerth also mimicked a recent bid by Alba MP Neale Hanvey, in which he called on the UK Government to amend the Scotland Act and transfer the power to hold an independence referendum to the Scottish Parliament.\n\nDespite Hanvey’s bill being voted down in the House of Commons, the Plaid Cymru leader said his party would be fighting for the same power to hold a referendum in Wales.\n\n“I am absolutely clear that decisions about Wales’ constitutional destiny belong in Wales.\n\n“The power to determine whether and when to hold a referendum on independence should not be contingent on Westminster’s whims.\n\n“Seeing this power devolved to the Senedd remains an absolute priority for Plaid Cymru.”"
