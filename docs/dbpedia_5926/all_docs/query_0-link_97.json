        "text": "“Culture should provide not just expensive spectacle but ways in which anyone can express themselves and their dreams”. Could not agree more! Culture should be about empowering everyone to express themselves and chase their dreams, not just glittery, expensive spectacles. This is where academia, particularly universities specialists in the creative arts, can play a fundamental role. By fostering partnerships and developing platforms for staff, students and community engagement, these institutions can become hubs for multi-dimensional knowledge transfer. Imagine students and community members coming together to create, learn, dream and share! This, at its core, is a powerful pedagogical approach to creative education and knowledge exchange. It has the potential to profoundly impact individuals, objects, and cultural phenomena itself! #ucagalleriessurrey #curatorialandculture #culture #creativeeducation #publicengagemnet\n\nThe recent instances of protesters, including those affiliated with Just Stop Oil, attacking artworks in museums and destroying cultural heritage, are deeply troubling. While the urgency and passion behind environmental and social causes are understandable, resorting to vandalism undermines the very essence of the values these movements seek to promote. Art, regardless of its form, serves as a universal language that transcends boundaries and connects people across time. Museums are the custodians of our shared heritage, preserving the narratives and expressions that define who we are as a society. Attacking these cultural treasures not only erases a part of our history but also jeopardizes the potential for constructive dialogue and understanding. Effective activism should strive for positive change through peaceful means, encouraging open conversations and collaboration. Destruction of artworks not only distracts from the core issues but also risks alienating potential allies. Let us champion our causes with respect for the diverse tapestry of our shared humanity, recognizing that cultural heritage is a bridge that unites us rather than a casualty in the struggle for change. #PreserveOurHeritage #CulturalRespect #PeacefulActivism\n\n#Identity, #responsibility and agency to #democracy. How do those relate to Gordon Rowe's post today about Mexico City in the 1920's, identity and nationality, La raza cósmica, and the impact of José Vasconcelos within the identity? #Canadian friends and neighbours, did John Ralston Saul #plagiarize the concept of \"mestizaje\" or \"métis\" for his concept of national identity in \"A Fair Country\"? How do \"La raza cósmica\" and \"A Fair Country\" attribute power and agency within their respective contexts and national identities? Nations are multiethnic, not a monoculture or monolith, though we see considerable reductionist thought represented in the aesthetic #meme or #soundbite culture. Do the ideas from \"La raza cósmica\" or \"A Fair Country\" still scale, or do they subjugate citizens to less agency through reduction of distinct identity? These are interesting markers of Zygmunt Bauman's idea of \"Liquid Modernity\" and many of the current exchanges we see competed for in the European context of security and identity. What framework respecting #security and #diversity will rise? What is the 'how' of #democracy, #agency and #identity? Happy St. Jean Baptiste Day! #canada #quebec #mexico #postracial https://lnkd.in/e3Wdh42E\n\nEUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE J. PAUL GETTY TRUST AND OTHERS VS. ITALY (important ruling about cultural heritage) The case involved the J. Paul Getty Trust and its trustees, who challenged an Italian confiscation order for the \"Victorious Youth,\" a bronze statue dating back to ancient Greece. The statue, currently housed at the Getty Villa Museum in Malibu, was allegedly purchased illegally by the Trust. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that there was no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (right to property). The Court upheld the Italian confiscation order, emphasizing the importance of protecting cultural heritage and the need for due diligence when acquiring cultural objects. The Court recognized the protection of cultural heritage as a legitimate aim, supported by international instruments like the UNESCO Convention. It emphasized the importance of public access to cultural goods. Moreover, the confiscation order had a clear legal basis in Italian law, which the applicants should have been aware of. The lack of a time limit for recovering stolen cultural objects, while noted, was not deemed a violation. While not explicitly ruling on ownership, the Court found the Italian authorities' assertion that the statue was part of their cultural heritage reasonable. It highlighted the Getty Trust's negligence in purchasing the statue despite knowing about the Italian claims and ongoing recovery efforts. The Court emphasized the high level of diligence required when purchasing cultural objects. Finally, the Court considered the State's margin of appreciation in protecting cultural heritage and the lack of applicable international instruments at the time of purchase. It found the confiscation order proportionate due to the Getty Trust's negligence and the importance of returning the statue to its country of origin. In a Partly Dissenting Opinion, Judge Wojtyczek, while agreeing with the importance of protecting cultural heritage, disagreed with the majority on the admissibility of the application. He argued that the Getty Trust's possession without a valid title did not constitute a \"proprietary interest\" protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He believed the Italian courts' findings on the statue's ownership should be upheld, making the application manifestly ill-founded. He also criticized the Court's reliance on cases concerning land ownership when addressing the issue of cultural objects. * This and other summaries of international rulings are available FOR FREE at https://lnkd.in/dPPtiXe9"
