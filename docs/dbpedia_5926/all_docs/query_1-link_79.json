        "text": "PLAID CYMRU’S leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, has called for an additional £4 billion in funding for Wales from the HS2 rail project, along with greater control over the nation’s natural resources. Unveiling the party’s manifesto for the upcoming general election, Mr ap Iorwerth outlined several key demands aimed at ensuring “fair” funding and increased autonomy for Wales.\n\n“It’s not a begging bowl, it’s just what’s right,” he stated, highlighting the necessity for investment in public services and the economy. He urged Welsh voters to hold Labour accountable, warning against giving them a “free pass” in the general election.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth emphasised the need for equitable financial treatment for Wales, advocating for a £20 per week increase in child benefit. This increase, according to the manifesto, would lift 60,000 children out of poverty. He criticised the current funding system, which is governed by the Barnett formula based on population, and called for its replacement with a needs-based approach.\n\nPlaid Cymru claims that Wales is owed £4 billion from the HS2 project, which is classified as an England and Wales project despite terminating in Birmingham. This classification precludes additional funding for the Welsh government. Mr ap Iorwerth argued that the extra funds would significantly enhance public transport in Wales, enabling investments in buses, roads, and railways.\n\n“Just imagine what that could do to transform our public transport network nationwide – buses, roads, and railways – connecting our communities and giving our economy that desperately-needed boost,” he said.\n\nThe manifesto also calls for the decriminalisation of “soft” drugs and proposes expunging the criminal records of those convicted of drug possession, provided there are no aggravating factors. Plaid Cymru advocates for devolving criminal justice to Wales to develop a distinct Welsh approach to policing.\n\nPlaid Cymru’s manifesto promotes a “fairer” tax system, with increased windfall taxes on energy companies and a cap on bankers’ bonuses. The party argues that the burden should fall on those with “the broadest shoulders” to ensure a fairer share of overall tax paid.\n\nThe party stands against the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system, suggesting that defence funds should be redirected towards conventional defence and peaceful initiatives rather than “weapons of mass destruction.”\n\nPlaid Cymru is pushing for full control over natural resources and waters, along with enhanced powers over migration, including Wales-specific visa schemes. The party also seeks control over broadcasting and Crown Estate properties, allowing benefits from investments, such as renewable energy, to return to Wales.\n\nCurrently, the Welsh government only oversees energy projects up to 350MW. Plaid Cymru argues for complete levers over all energy projects.\n\nPlaid Cymru won four seats in Westminster during the 2019 election. Following boundary changes, the party is defending two constituencies: Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Ceredigion Preseli. It aims to gain additional seats in Caerfyrddin and Ynys Mon, fending off competition from Labour and the Conservatives.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth took over as Plaid leader last June after Adam Price stepped down following a report on allegations of misogyny within the party. Recently, Mr ap Iorwerth led Plaid Cymru out of a co-operation agreement with Vaughan Gething’s Welsh Labour government.\n\nPlaid Cymru’s manifesto sets forth a vision of fair funding, increased autonomy, and progressive policies aimed at enhancing the well-being and governance of Wales. As the general election approaches, the party appeals to voters to ensure their voices are heard and their interests represented in Westminster.\n\nIN a delightful surprise for visitors and staff alike, Folly Farm has welcomed its very first Macaroni penguin chick to its popular Penguin Coast exhibit. The chick, a male affectionately named ‘Ravioli’ by the keepers, is the latest addition to the zoo’s thriving penguin colony, marking a significant milestone as the only place in the UK currently home to this particular species.\n\nThe Macaroni penguins, easily recognisable by their striking yellow crest feathers, have been residents at Folly Farm since 2020. They originally arrived from ‘Living Coasts’ in Devon following its closure during the pandemic. Since then, they have become a firm favourite among visitors, although breeding success had eluded the keepers—until now.\n\nRavioli was first discovered during a routine morning check by the surprised penguin keepers, nestled safely under the watchful eyes of his parents. Concerned about the attention from other curious Macaroni penguins in the colony, the keepers made the decision to move Ravioli and his parents to the ‘Penguin Nursery’—a quieter, off-display area of the enclosure where the chick could grow in peace.\n\nCaz Davies, one of the assistant managers and penguin keepers at Folly Farm, shared her excitement about the new arrival: “We’re beyond thrilled that Ravioli is growing strong and continuing to do so well. This is so exciting for us as keepers. To welcome our first Macaroni penguin chick to the colony will hopefully mean we can have more successful breeding for this species, as well as with our Humboldt penguins, as part of the European Breeding Programme.”\n\nRavioli’s arrival is particularly noteworthy as the Macaroni penguins had not previously bred successfully at the zoo. However, with careful nurturing, the chick is now eight weeks old and gaining weight daily—encouraging signs that he will soon be ready to join the main colony once he has developed his waterproof feathers and learned to feed on whole fish.\n\nFolly Farm’s Humboldt penguins, who have been at the zoo since 2013, have enjoyed considerable breeding success, with more than 40 chicks hatched as part of the European Breeding Programme for this vulnerable species. Now, with the successful hatching of Ravioli, there is renewed hope that the Macaroni penguins will follow in the same footsteps.\n\nAs for the name ‘penguin,’ it holds a special significance for readers in Wales. The word is believed to derive from the Welsh “pen gwyn,” meaning “white head,” a curious fact given that most penguins do not have white heads. Nevertheless, this linguistic link adds an extra layer of interest for those following Ravioli’s journey.\n\nWhile Ravioli remains off display for the time being, Folly Farm is encouraging guests to stay tuned to their social media channels for updates and pictures of the adorable chick. The zoo looks forward to the day when Ravioli can make his public debut, much to the delight of visitors eager to catch a glimpse of this charming new resident.\n\nImages: Megan Lee/Folly Farm\n\nTODAY marks a significant milestone for learners across Pembrokeshire as they receive their A-Level and Vocational Qualifications results, Pembrokeshire County Council said.\n\nThe Authority wrote: “The Council extends our congratulations to all learners for their hard work, dedication, and perseverance.\n\n“This achievement is a testament to their commitment and resilience, especially during some challenging times.\n\n“We also want to acknowledge and celebrate the unwavering support of families, teachers, and school staff.

There are many paths to success, and today’s results are just the beginning of future endeavours.”\n\nCabinet Member for Education and the Welsh Language, Cllr Guy Woodham said: “We congratulate all learners on their achievements. Continuing the transition back in to external examinations has been a challenge that these learners have met successfully.\n\n“The achievements of learners are to be commended and celebrated. I would like to wish them every success for their futures.”\n\nThe Council encourages learners to take pride in their accomplishments and look forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nFor those who may need additional support or guidance, resources are available to help them navigate their next steps and this will be available at schools.\n\nOnce again, congratulations to all learners and their families.

Prosecutor Caitlin Brazel revealed that the items confiscated included phones, laptops, computer towers, and an iPad.\n\nWood admitted to having indecent images of children and cooperated with police by providing access to his devices. During an interview, he further directed officers to two additional computer towers that had not been found during the initial search.\n\nWood claimed that the images were sent to him through a group chat on the Kik messaging platform, stating that he was “merely curious about what could be found online” and had not viewed the material “for a number of years.”\n\nIn total, police discovered 102 images and 321 videos of Category A, 248 images and 62 videos of Category B, and 212 images and eight videos of Category C, along with five prohibited videos of children and 20 extreme pornographic videos depicting bestiality. Additionally, it was revealed that Wood had distributed a Category A video on 1 February 2022, showing a baby, aged between 12 and 18 months, being sexually abused by a man.\n\nMs Brazel described Wood as an “active participant” in the group chats, where he sent disturbing messages expressing his intent to “rape all the subjects” of the images and videos, and voiced a desire to meet the person who sent him the videos so they could “tag team” a child.\n\nWood pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including distributing an indecent image of a child, three offences of making indecent images of children, possessing a prohibited image of a child, and possessing extreme pornography. These offences spanned from August 2018 to September 2022.\n\nIn mitigation, defence counsel Ian Ibrahim highlighted that Wood had no previous convictions and acknowledged that his client’s “good character is now, of course, lost forever.” Mr Ibrahim also noted that Wood had been ostracised by his family, with his mother telling him not to return home, and that he had been attending sex therapy sessions voluntarily. Wood no longer claimed to have obtained the images “out of curiosity.”\n\nPresiding over the case, Judge Paul Thomas KC expressed his deep concern over the material found on Wood’s devices. “The material that you had over a prolonged period of time on your various devices was utterly appalling,” he stated, adding that Wood’s participation in the chats was “extremely worrying.”\n\n“You are a sad man with sad fantasies,” Judge Thomas continued. “If you have become a social pariah, you can hardly blame people for acting in disgust at the sort of images you were viewing.”\n\nWood was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to complete the Maps For Change programme and undertake 30 rehabilitation activity requirement days.\n\nAdditionally, Wood must register as a sex offender."
