        "text": "Thank you for joining us for the UK general election results. Our coverage has moved here.\n\nThe UK has a new political reality. Here's what you need to know\n\nBritain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has started to name his cabinet, including appointing Rachel Reeves as the country’s first ever female Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister.\n\nEarlier, the Labour leader made his first speech as prime minister, promising to steer the UK toward “calmer waters” during his time in office.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nLabour Party wins big: The center-left Labour won the election by a landslide, securing the biggest majority in its history. Party leader Starmer celebrated the victory in front of supporters at the Tate Modern art gallery in London. “Change begins now. It feels good, I have to be honest,” he said.\n\nHandover of power complete: Sunak formally tendered his resignation to King Charles, before Starmer had his audience with the monarch, who asked him to form a government. Starmer then traveled to Downing Street to address the nation before he and his wife, Victoria, entered Number 10 for the first time.\n\nStarmer promises change: In his first speech as prime minister, Starmer pledged to steer the UK toward “calmer waters” after 14 often turbulent years of Conservative rule. “You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change, to restore service and respect to politics, end the era of noisy performance, tread more lightly on your lives, and unite our country,” Starmer said.\n\nCabinet appointments: Starmer has announced a number of cabinet appointments, with Angela Rayner named deputy prime minister as well as Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, while Rachel Reeves is the first ever female finance minister in British history.\n\nSunak to step down: The outgoing prime minister said that he will leave his post as leader of the Conservative party in an address to the British public outside Downing Street. “I have heard your anger, your disappointment, and I take responsibility for this loss,” Sunak said after delivering the party’s worst-ever defeat.\n\nProminent Conservatives lose their seats: The Tories have had a tough night, suffering the biggest defeat since the party was formed. Among the top brass Conservatives losing their seats: the former (albeit short-lived) Prime Minister Liz Truss, House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt, Defense Secretary Grant Shapps and Justice Secretary Alex Chalk.\n\nReform UK makes breakthrough: An insurgent rightwing populist party led by the Nigel Farage secured four seats, with Farage himself getting into the parliament for the first time – after running seven times in the past.\n\nLiberal Democrats reborn: The Liberal Democrats were on course to secure their best result ever – and will return as Britain’s third-biggest party in Westminster. They unseated several high-profile Conservatives.\n\nGreens quadruple their seats: The Green Party won four spots in the Parliament, gaining three more seats compared to the last election in 2019.\n\nSNP wipeout: The Scottish National Party has suffered big losses in Scotland, likely putting the question of an independent Scotland to rest for now. Labour took a host of seats from the party.\n\nLow turnout: Turnout is on track to be the lowest for more than 20 years. Of the seats declared by early Friday morning, turnout is hovering just below 60% – down from 67.3% at the last election in 2019.\n\nWho is Rachel Reeves, the first woman to take the helm of Britain’s economy?\n\nRachel Reeves has been appointed by Keir Starmer as the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister, becoming the first woman to hold the role.\n\nThe daughter of teachers, Reeves studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University before taking a graduate job at the Bank of England, initially tasked with analyzing how Japan attempted to emerge from its period of stagnation in the 1990s.\n\nBritain’s economy today faces a similar challenge. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Britain’s economic growth has mostly flatlined. The last time the average Briton went so long without a real-terms pay rise, Queen Victoria had not been born.\n\nLabour made kickstarting economic growth a key mission. In a recent lecture, Reeves diagnosed the root of Britain’s economic ills.\n\nReeves said the years of political instability that followed was a product of the economic harm wrought by austerity. She called the failure to invest when the government could borrow cheaply “an act of historic negligence.”\n\nAlthough Labour has been criticized for not making bolder tax-and-spend commitments – leading some to argue there is little difference between their plans for the economy and the Tories’ – Starmer’s government will face far more constraints than the Conservative government in 2010. After the surge in borrowing costs, Britain is much more fiscally constrained now than it was then.\n\nStill, within these limits, Reeves has made a series of quietly radical promises. She calls her agenda “securonomics” – a homage to “Bidenomics” – an attempt to build secure supply chains to avoid future inflationary shocks.\n\nTo this end, Labour has also pledged to create two new economic institutions: a National Wealth Fund, aiming to rebuild Britain’s industrial strength and encourage private investment, and Great British Energy, a mission to create a publicly-owned clean energy company by 2030.\n\nWhat is clear is that Labour is not promising overnight fixes to Britain’s malaise. Starmer and Reeves say they hope to embark on “a decade of national renewal.”\n\nStarmer names more senior cabinet positions\n\nNew British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed three more senior ministers to his cabinet.\n\nDavid Lammy has been appointed foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper is the home secretary and John Healey is the defense secretary.\n\nStarmer appoints first female finance minister in UK history\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed Rachel Reeves as UK chancellor, making her the first woman to take charge of the Treasury.\n\nReeves said it was the “honor of her life” to be appointed as UK finance minister.\n\nReeves, a former Bank of England economist, said it was a “historic responsibility” to be appointed to the position and addressed other women and girls, saying there should be “no limits on your ambitions.”\n\nThere will also be a record number of female lawmakers in the new House of Commons when it returns, continuing a trend towards increasing female representation in parliament over the last few elections.\n\nMore than 260 female lawmakers have been elected to parliament. The previous record set was 220 in 2019.\n\nStarmer starts to name his cabinet, with Angela Rayner appointed deputy prime minister\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed Angela Rayner as deputy prime minister, his office announced in a post on X Friday.\n\nRayner will also serve as Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.\n\nSeveral senior Labour MPs have been seen entering Downing Street, where Starmer will name his cabinet.\n\nReform UK’s Nigel Farage heckled and called racist at chaotic press conference\n\nNigel Farage from the right-wing start-up Reform UK party was subjected to a barrage of heckling from protesters at a press conference that he called to celebrate his party’s election success.\n\nFarage, known for his leadership in the UK’s Brexit campaign and his close ties with former President Donald Trump, won his first seat in parliament in Thursday’s vote, along with at least three others from the Reform party.\n\nAs he tried to address journalists and supporters, several hecklers shouted abuse, including one that said he was racist.\n\nFarage and his party have vowed to freeze illegal migration and “stop the boats,” in reference to migrants who arrive in the country by sea, usually across the English Channel.\n\nFarage shouted, “Boring, boring, boring,” to drown out hecklers’ remarks as his supporters cheered and security officials ejected the protesters from the room.\n\nHe took a jibe at newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying that, although Labour won by a landslide in terms of seats in parliament, the popular vote showed the party’s win was not a resounding victory.\n\nDespite the Labour landslide, Starmer’s party only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing.\n\nStarmer and his wife enter 10 Downing Street for the first time\n\nAfter making his first address as Prime Minister, Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, greeted by staff and civil servants on Friday.\n\nWhat will Keir Starmer’s leadership mean for the world?\n\nEver since the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016, there has been a perennial debate about Britain’s place in the world.\n\nThere are some who believed that Brexit would lead to the UK having a diminished voice on the world stage, despite still being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a G7 economy and a nuclear power.\n\nIt’s hard to quantify exactly how much power any country has, but arguably the biggest hinderance to the UK’s international influence has been the domestic political chaos and instability since 2016.\n\nThe logic goes that if you cannot provide certainty at home, what you say on international issues doesn’t carry much weight.\n\nDiplomats often point to the relative stability of a country like Ireland, whose political consistency, particularly on foreign affairs, affords its diplomats disproportionate heft, compared to say Australia, who went through a period of political instability which saw it lose influence.\n\nIt’s not an exact science, but political stability matters to your allies. Starmer can now as good as guarantee five years of consistency to the world, which will mean his views on foreign affairs can be taken seriously.\n\nOn Ukraine, Starmer is expected to maintain the UK government’s support.\n\nHe has said Israel has a right to defend itself, but it is expected that he will come under pressure to restrict arms sales if they are being used to commit war crimes.\n\nHe has said that he wants to improve the UK’s relationship with Europe, but has ruled out rejoining the EU or any of its institutions.\n\nHow the return of Farage created a nightmare for the Tories\n\nAfter Britain left the European Union in 2020 – a cause he had championed for three decades – Nigel Farage retreated from frontline politics. When his fledgling Brexit party renamed itself as Reform UK, he slunk into the role of party chairman – still a political force, but a dormant one.\n\nJust weeks ago, it looked set to stay that way. Farage initially said he would not stand in this election, and that he would instead “help with the grassroots campaign” in the US, presumably to try to reelect former President Donald Trump.\n\nThis came as a relief to the Conservatives, who had long feared losing their more right-wing voters to Reform. But, lacking a recognizable leader, Reform looked set to be a disparate protest vote, failing to pose a real electoral challenge to the Tories.\n\nThen, everything changed. Farage said at the start of June that he was set to make an “emergency announcement,” striking fear into Conservative HQ.\n\nHe went on to win the seat comfortably, finally being elected Parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts.\n\nFarage’s return injected energy into the Reform campaign and skewed the electoral arithmetic. While Reform won just four seats, it secured millions of votes, potentially costing the Conservative dozens of constituencies by splitting the vote on the right.\n\nIn the past, the Conservative Party has seen off the Faragist threat by adopting his policies. The much-diminished party now faces a similar choice: Does it try to bury Reform, or bed it?\n\nBREAKING: Sunak pledges to step down as Conservative leader after landslide election loss\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that he will step down as leader of the Conservative party after losing the election in a landslide.\n\n“Following this result, I will step down as party leader,” he said, a move that will trigger a contest to become next Conservative leader.\n\n“To the country, I would like to say first and foremost: I am sorry,” he said in an address to the British public outside Downing Street to mark the end of his time in office.\n\n“I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change, and yours is the only judgment that matters,” added Sunak.\n\nHis party was routed by the opposition Labour party and squeezed by the Nigel Farage-led Reform Party and the resurgent centrist Liberal Democrats.\n\nSeveral Conservative cabinet ministers lost their seats and the party must now decide how to respond to the challenges of opposition.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to address public from Downing Street\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak is to make a statement as he prepares to make way for election winner Keir Starmer to form a government.\n\nA podium has been set up outside Downing Street, with Sunak expected to address the public shortly.\n\nNationalist Sinn Féin party becomes largest Northern Irish party in Westminster parliament\n\nSinn Féin has become largest Northern Irish party in the Westminster parliament after a historic showing in the UK general election.\n\nNorthern Irish politicians can choose to either run for a seat in the Westminster parliament or for a seat in the devolved legislature, the Northern Ireland Assembly, referred to as Stormont.\n\nThe Assembly passes laws regarding policy areas such as health, education and policing whilst the Westminster parliament presides over issues which have not been devolved including foreign policy and defense.\n\nThe nationalist Sinn Féin party, which advocates for reuniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in the south, succeeded in winning seven out of the 18 available seats in the Westminster parliament.\n\nAfter a sweeping victory in Assembly elections held in 2022, Sinn Féin now has the largest number of seats for a Northern Ireland party in both Westminster and Stormont.\n\nSinn Féin MPs do not take up their seats in the Westminster parliament as part of the party’s refusal to recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland.\n\nThe party’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill hailed their success in a social media post on Friday, thanking voters for “endorsing Sinn Féin candidates who will work hard for you every day and lead positive change for everyone.”\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the leading Unionist party which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, won five seats in total, losing some long-held seats in stronghold areas.\n\nThe UK’s transfer of power is an exercise of ruthless efficiency\n\nSomewhere in London, a removal van will soon start trundling towards Westminster. Desks will be cleared, photographs will be taken down, closets will be emptied. By this evening, 10 Downing Street will have a new resident.\n\nIn other countries, the gap between an election to the formation of a new government can take months. In the United Kingdom, power is transferred with ruthless efficiency.\n\nIn the coming hours, Sunak is expected to give a resignation speech; Starmer is expected to give a victory one; both are expected to visit Buckingham Palace.\n\nBy the afternoon, the conversation will have shifted to the makeup of Starmer’s government. We’ll be bringing you the latest until then.\n\nUK election marked by low turnout with some 40% of British voters skipping the vote\n\nLabour might have won a big majority in the parliament, but once the celebrations end, the party will need to ask itself a tough question: why did so many voters stay home?\n\nOfficial data showed electoral turnout – the proportion of eligible voters who actually voted – stood just below 60%, only the second time in the past century that more than 40% of voters decided to stay home.\n\nIt dipped to 59.4% in 2001 – something political commentators at the time attributed to the dominance of Tony Blair’s Labour Party at the time. Their win was seen as certain well ahead of the vote.\n\nGiven the predictions of a major Labour win, it is possible that some voters decided to skip the vote on Thursday because they thought the election was already decided.\n\nBut there are other possible explanations.\n\nSome voters in Scotland might have missed the vote because of its timing. Schools in Scotland have already shut down for the summer break, meaning some families might have been away on vacation. While postal vote is possible – and popular – in the UK, British media reported delays to some ballot papers being delivered.\n\nAnd then there are the voters who decided to skip the vote because they are fed up with politics altogether – not wanting the Conservatives to remain in power but uninspired by the alternatives.\n\nHere is a selection of voter turnout over past century, according to election data from the House of Commons Library:\n\n1924: 77.0%\n\n1929: 76% (The first election in which men and women had equal right to vote)\n\n1931: 76.4%\n\n1935: 71.1%\n\n1945: 72.8%\n\n1950: 83.9%\n\n1970: 72.0%\n\n1979: 76.0%\n\n1987: 75.3%\n\n1992: 77.7%\n\n1997: 71.4%\n\n2001: 59.4%\n\n2005: 61.4%\n\n2010: 65.1%\n\n2015: 66.2%\n\n2017: 68.8%\n\n2019: 67.3%\n\n2024 (as of Friday morning): 59.9%\n\nHere is how one third of votes got Labour two thirds of seats in the Parliament\n\nThe Labour Party has won an overwhelming majority in the UK Parliament, securing close to two thirds of the seats in the UK Parliament.\n\nHere is the curious thing though: in terms of the vote share, only about one third of voters cast their votes for Labour in the election yesterday.\n\nThis discrepancy is due to the British electoral system, based on the “first past the post” principle.\n\nThe country is divided into 650 constituencies, each holding their own contest to pick one member of parliament. Whoever wins the largest number of votes in their constituency becomes the MP – they don’t need to secure the majority in order to be elected. In fact, most MPs don’t.\n\nThis means that the number of seats a party wins doesn’t necessary reflect its overall popularity across the country, something that has historically disadvantaged the smaller parties.\n\nReform, the insurgent rightwing populist party led by Nigel Farage, secured 14% of the votes in this election, but came first in only four constituencies. That means they will take up four seats in the parliament – less than 1%. The Greens, who got some 7% of all votes also secured four seats.\n\nThere have been campaigns to change the electoral systems over the years, but none succeeded – possibly because the parties making the decision are the ones who could lose the most from a shift to a different system.\n\nWorld leaders congratulate Starmer on election victory\n\nLeaders from several nations have been sending their congratulations to Britain’s next prime minister Keir Starmer.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted a photo of himself and Starmer on X, writing that they have “lots of work ahead.”\n\nMeanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sent “congratulations to my friend and new UK Prime Minister @Keir_Starmer on his resounding election victory.” He added in a post on X that he was looking “forward to working constructively” with the incoming Labour government.\n\nPrime Minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Støre congratulated Starmer on an “historic election win” on social media.\n\nMalta’s Prime Minister Robert Abela said he was “delighted by @Keir_Starmer’s resounding victory in the UK general election” in a post on X.\n\n“Congratulations to @UKLabour for driving a progressive and engaging campaign that empowered UK citizens. I look forward to strengthening further the excellent relations between [Malta] and [the UK],” said Abela.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron congratulated Starmer and alluded to having already spoken to the incoming Prime Minister.\n\n“Pleased with our first discussion. We will continue the work begun with the UK for our bilateral cooperation, for peace and security in Europe, for the climate and for AI,” Macron said in a post on X.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Starmer on a “convincing election victory” in a post on X.\n\n“Ukraine and the United Kingdom have been and will continue to be reliable allies through thick and thin,” he wrote.\n\n“We will continue to defend and advance our common values of life, freedom, and a rules-based international order.”\n\nThe \"fun\" campaign that delivered a \"record-breaking\" night for the Lib Dems\n\nAs leader of the party that won just 11 seats at the last general election, Ed Davey has had to scrap for attention. With British media duly dominated by Labour and the Conservatives – joined this time by the nascent Reform UK party – the centrist Liberal Democrats faced a problem: How to get eyeballs on their campaign?\n\nDavey, it turned out, found an ingenious solution: Be a bit of a clown.\n\nOver the past six weeks, Davey has bungee-jumped, rollercoaster-ed, kayaked, wheelbarrowed, frisbee-ed, slip-and-slid, paddle-boarded and hula-hooped his way across the country, on the promise to take voters’ concerns – but not himself – seriously.\n\nMany British voters might have been hard-pressed to name the leader of the Lib Dems before this campaign. Now, millions will be familiar with him. Amid Sunak’s gaffes and Starmer’s unflinching earnestness, Davey has cut the figure of a fun uncle, winning him widespread affection.\n\nThe campaign has not, however, been without more somber moments. In a moving campaign video, Davey told the story of how he looks after his 16-year-old son, John, who was born with severe learning and physical disabilities and requires round-the-clock care.\n\nThe Lib Dems made social care a key part of their manifesto – and have been rewarded with 70 seats, which Davey hailed as the party’s “best results in a century.”\n\nSunak to address British public before tendering resignation to King Charles\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has arrived in London to begin the process of formally standing down and allowing election winner Keir Starmer to form a government.\n\nA plane reported to be carrying Sunak landed at the RAF Northolt airbase in west London shortly after 7 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), according to video carried by British broadcasters.\n\nSunak then traveled to the Conservative party headquarters in London where he is expected to address party members and staff.\n\nHe is expected to make a statement at Downing Street at approximately 10.30 a.m. local time (5.30 a.m. ET), before travelling to Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation to King Charles, according to a provisional timeline of events released by the Prime Minister’s office.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer will then have an audience with the King, who will officially ask him to form a government.\n\nStarmer will then travel to Downing Street and address the nation as new Prime Minister at around 12.20 p.m. local time (7.20 a.m. ET).\n\nPro-Palestinian independent candidates upset Labour in three constituencies\n\nWhile it undoubtedly has been a good night for Labour, its stance on the war in Gaza has cost the party votes.\n\nPro-Palestinian independent candidates have managed to upset Labour in three constituencies the party won in 2019: Blackburn, Leicester South and Islington North.\n\nAdnan Hussain, who promised to make sure that opposition to “the injustice being inflicted against the people of Gaza be heard,” won in Blackburn, a constituency which had previously voted Labour in every election since it was created in 1955.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour’s Shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth, who had been Leicester South’s MP since 2011, was unseated by the independent candidate Shockat Adam, who won 35.2% compared to Ashworth’s 32.9%.\n\n“As a genocide is being committed in Gaza, according to all human rights observers, many have expressed feeling betrayed and ignored on this matter,” Adam said in his campaign to win the Leicester South constituency.\n\nFormer left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was expelled from the party in a spat over antisemitism, won the Islington North constituency as an independent. His win gives him the opportunity to challenge the current Labour leader (and next PM) Keir Starmer in parliament, who has sought to remold Labour from the Corbyn era.\n\nHowever, Labour has gained the Rochdale constituency from the pro-Palestine politician George Galloway.\n\nGalloway dramatically won the constituency in a by-election earlier this year, in which he accused the “political class” of having “failed Rochdale, failed Britain and failed Gaza.”\n\nLiz Truss loses her seat, an epic collapse for the short-lived former prime minister\n\nBritain’s former Prime Minister Liz Truss has suffered another unprecedented humiliation, losing her seat and being dumped from parliament less than two years after she led the country.\n\nTruss was prime minister for just six weeks, by some distance the shortest stint in British history. Her premiership collapsed after a shambolic financial plan spooked markets and investors and caused the value of the pound to plummet.\n\nShe refused to speak after her defeat, leaving the stage with her fellow candidates instead, attempting to retain a steely look on her face.\n\nTruss lost by 630 votes. She picked up 11,217 votes, to Labour’s 11,847.\n\nHer defeat is one of the most staggering moments in the long history of British elections. It trumps the famous moment in 1997 when Defence Secretary Michael Portillo lost his seat; even among the worst-case forecasts for the Conservatives, few imagined that Truss could be defeated in her once ultra-safe Tory safe.\n\nRishi Sunak had sought to distance the Conservatives from Truss’s tenure, but she nonetheless represented the party in the seat she has held since 2010.\n\nShe now becomes the face of the Conservatives’ collapse, on an unprecedented night that saw the ruling party thoroughly rejected by the electorate.\n\nRecord number of women elected to parliament\n\nSeats are still being declared on what has been a gripping election night, but it’s already official: There will be a record number of female lawmakers in the new House of Commons when it returns.\n\nIt follows a trend from the past few elections in which the number of women in parliament has increased.\n\nSo far, some 242 female MPs have been elected to parliament. The previous record set in 2019 was 220. Before that in 2017, it was 207 and 196 in 2015.\n\nIn Scotland, SNP loses scores of seats, including several in capital city\n\nThe Scottish National Party has lost scores of seats across the country, including a number in Scotland’s capital city Edinburgh.\n\nThe party has lost at least 38 seats in total, including Edinburgh North and Leith, Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, and Edinburgh South West — all of which were picked up by the Labour Party.\n\nMost of the seats the SNP lost have been Labour gains, but two, Mid Dunbartonshire and North East Fife, were lost to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nLabour has won a total of 37 seats so far across Scotland. The Conservative Party meanwhile, has only won in one constituency in Scotland so far — Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk.\n\nThe left-leaning SNP has led Scotland’s devolved government since 2007, and it forced an independence vote in 2014 in which Scottish voters opted to remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe SNP descended into disorder last year amid a widely publicized police investigation into the party’s financial irregularities, which eroded its public support.\n\nConservative Party loses all its MPs in Wales\n\nThe Conservative Party has lost all 14 of its members of parliament in Wales, as Welsh Secretary David TC Davies lost his seat to Labour.\n\nDavies finished second in his constituency of Monmouthshire, with 34.8% of the vote, compared to Labour candidate Catherine Fookes’ 41.3%.\n\nThree other former Welsh secretaries lost their seats: Alun Cairns lost to Labour in Vale of Glamorgan, Stephen Crabb lost to Labour in Mid and South Pembrokeshire, and Simon Hart lost to Plaid Cymru in Caerfyrddin.\n\nPM Rishi Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will return to parliament, but other prominent MPs have lost their seats\n\nWith the UK’s electoral map changing fundamentally, from a large Conservative majority in 2019 to a large Labour majority this election, numerous prominent politicians have already lost their seats:\n\nFormer Prime Minister Liz Truss suffered another unprecedented humiliation, losing her seat by 630 votes and being dumped from parliament less than two years after she led the country.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt was unseated by Labour in the Portsmouth North constituency. Mordaunt, who served as defense secretary in 2019 and before that international development secretary, was first elected as the constituency’s Conservative MP in 2010.\n\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps lost the constituency he had been the MP for since 2005, Welwyn Hatfield, which Labour gained. Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk lost his Cheltenham seat to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nProminent right-wing Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg will no longer be an MP after losing in the Somerset North East and Hanham constituency. While Labour candidate Dan Norris received 40.6% of the vote, Rees-Mogg, a prominent Brexiteer who became business secretary under Liz Truss’ premiership, came second with 30.2% of the vote.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan has been unseated by the Liberal Democrats in Chichester. The Conservatives had won Chichester in every general election since 1924, but this time the Liberal Democrats received 49.2% of the vote and the Conservatives only 25.7%.\n\nConservative Robert Buckland, previously Welsh secretary (July to October 2022) and justice secretary (2019 to 2021), lost in Swindon South. Buckland received just 26.9% of the vote, while the Labour candidate Heidi Alexander received 48.4%. Alexander was previously the Labour MP for Lewisham East from 2010 to 2018, before resigning from parliament to become deputy mayor of London for transport — a position she held until 2021.\n\nConservative Thérèse Coffey, who has held numerous senior government positions including health secretary, was unseated by Labour in the Suffolk Coastal constituency. The Conservatives had won the constituency every election since it was created in 1983, but this time Labour received 31.7% of the vote compared to the Conservatives’ 29.5%.\n\nVeterans’ Minister Johnny Mercer has also found himself without a seat in the new parliament. He lost in the Plymouth Moor View constituency, where Labour won with 41.2% of the vote compared to the Conservatives’ 28.1%. In 2019, Mercer won a large majority in the seat, gaining 60.7% of the vote.\n\nConservative chief whip and former Welsh Secretary Simon Hart will also no longer be an MP. He lost in Caerfyrddin, in Wales, coming third place behind both Labour and Plaid Cymru, who won the seat.\n\nThe Conservative Party’s deputy chairman Jonathan Gullis lost in the Stoke-on-Trent North. While in 2019, Gullis won 52.3% of the vote in the constituency, he received just 26.3% this time around. Labour candidate David Williams won the constituency, receiving 40.3% of the vote.\n\nLabour has also taken Transport Secretary Mark Harper’s seat in the Forest of Dean. Labour’s Matt Bishop ousted Harper - who was elected to parliament in 2005 - with just 278 votes.\n\nHowever, it’s not only prominent Conservative MPs who have lost their seats: Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire lost the Bristol Central constituency.\n\nDebbonaire was expected to become culture secretary under a Labour government, but her hopes were dashed after Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer won 56.6% of the constituency’s vote, compared to Debbonaire’s 32.6%.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth, who was expected to become paymaster general in a Labour government, lost the Leicester South constituency to an independent candidate, Shockat Adam.\n\n\"Change begins now,\" Keir Starmer tells victory rally in London\n\nThe soon-to-be new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has addressed cheering supporters at a Labour Party victory rally in central London, and pledged “national renewal” following 14 years of Conservative rule.\n\n“You campaigned for it, you fought for it, you voted for it and now it has arrived. Change begins now,” Starmer told Labour staff. “It feels good, I have to be honest … This is what it is for. A changed Labour party, ready to serve our country.”\n\nHowever, Starmer cautioned that having “a mandate like this comes with a great responsibility.”\n\nSpeaking a few moments after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak conceded defeat in the general election, Starmer said, “Our task is nothing less than renewing the ideas that hold this country together. National renewal. If you work hard, if you play by the rules, this country should give you a fair chance to get on… We have to restore that.”\n\nHe continued: “We have to return politics to public service, show that politics can be a force for good. Make no mistake, that is the great test for politics in this era. The fight for trust is the battle that defines our age.”\n\nSenior Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg loses seat\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, senior Conservative figure and former leader of the House of Commons, has become the latest election night upset after losing his seat.\n\nLabour’s Dan Norris garnered 20,739 votes in in Somerset North East and Hanham, while Rees-Mogg secured 15,420 votes.\n\nEarlier Friday, Rees-Mogg summed up the party’s fortunes after voters delivered a devastating verdict on the ruling Conservative Party’s 14 years in power. He said simply that “there’s no way of describing this as anything other than a bad night for the Conservative Party.”\n\nLabour has officially won the election\n\nLabour has won 326 seats, the crucial number that secures them a parliamentary majority and ensures Keir Starmer will become prime minister in the coming hours.\n\nMinutes earlier, outgoing PM and Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak conceded defeat, telling people at the count in his seat: “I am sorry.”\n\n“The Labour Party has won this general election,” Sunak said, adding that he had called Starmer to congratulate him and concede the election.\n\nThe milestone marks the end of one era and the start of another; the Conservatives have ruled Britain for 14 years, but Labour has ousted them from power for the first time since 1997.\n\nFive years ago, when the Tories won a thumping majority, this moment would have seemed unthinkable. But Starmer has turned his party around while the Conservatives collapsed, slumping from scandal to scandal and changing their leader twice since that vote.\n\nThere are still many more seats to declare, and Labour is on course for a huge majority that will make Starmer a powerful prime minister. He will travel to Buckingham Palace on Friday to formally take control of the country.\n\nRishi Sunak concedes defeat, saying \"Labour has won this election\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has conceded defeat in the general election, telling people at the count in his seat: “I am sorry.”\n\n“The Labour Party has won this general election,” Sunak said, adding that he has called Keir Starmer to congratulate him and concede the election.\n\nJust 20 voters decided a crucial seat\n\nThe Conservatives have held a key seat by the narrowest of margins: just 20 people ensured that party’s chairman Richard Holden won Basildon and Billericay.\n\nA recount was ordered in the constituency, which went right down to wire: if just 11 votes that were initially counted for the Conservatives had in fact been for Labour, the seat would have turned red.\n\nThis constituency has been an extremely secure stronghold for the Conservatives; so safe that Holden moved himself from a northeastern seat to contest this one, against the opposition of local Tories.\n\nBut the Conservatives’ collapse and Labour’s surge turned it into a stunningly close battleground. The final tally put Holden on 12,905 votes; Labour’s Alex Harrison on 12,885 votes and Reform UK’s Stephen Conlay on 11,354 votes.\n\nHouse of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt loses seat in most high-profile defeat so far\n\nPenny Mordaunt, the House of Commons leader and a potential frontrunner in the impending race for the leadership of the Conservative Party, has lost her seat – the most high-profile loss of the night so far.\n\nMordaunt, who has been an MP since 2010, was dislodged by Labour challenger Amanda Martin in Portsmouth North. Martin received 14,495 votes to Mordaunt’s 13,715 votes.\n\nMordaunt beat Martin in 2019 with a majority of more than 15,000 votes.\n\nHer defeat will be a blow to moderate Conservatives who are hoping to wrest control of the party away from its populist wing; Mourdaunt ran against Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak in the race to replace Boris Johnson as leader in 2022, and would have been expected to run again in another contest.\n\nShe also won attention around the world as the “lady in blue” at King Charles’ coronation.\n\nAs Europe turns right, why is a center-left party projected to win by a landslide in the UK?\n\nThe United Kingdom’s decision to hand the center-left Labour Party a parliamentary majority, according to the exit poll, comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge.\n\nLast month’s European elections saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. The results caused such chaos that French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election in his own country, the first round of which the far-right National Rally won last week.\n\nA government comprised of far-right figures was formed in the Netherlands this week. Italy is led by the most right-wing leader since the rule of fascist wartime leader Benito Mussolini. These electoral victories and the prospect of populist right-wingers in power is no longer a surprise in European countries.\n\nThere are many reasons for this rise in populism, often unique to individual countries. But broadly speaking, a number of European countries are suffering from sluggish economies, high immigration and higher energy prices, due in part to the drive for carbon net zero. The European Union is often blamed for national woes by populist politicians and breathes oxygen into an increasingly Euroskeptic national discourse.\n\nSo why is Britain, the only country where Euroskepticism led to a referendum on EU membership, projected to buck this trend?\n\nDespite the expected seat count, the British right is far from dead. The Conservative Party, despite its undeniably disappointing night, is set to outperform the expectations of a number of opinion polls during the campaign, some of which had it down to double digits in parliament.\n\nAnother party that is set to exceed polling expectations is the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by long-term scourge of the Conservatives, Nigel Farage, who is perhaps best known these days for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump. Before this, he was credited with making Brexit possible after decades of campaigning against the UK’s membership of the EU.\n\nFarage’s political success to date has all come without him holding a parliamentary seat. Now he is not only projected to have a seat himself, but also 12 colleagues to hurl grenades at Labour leader Keir Starmer. While this may seem small fry compared to Starmer’s anticipated three-figure majority, Farage will no doubt influence the debate on the future direction of the Conservative Party, possibly dragging it further to the right.\n\nIt is possible that Farage’s splitting of the right has actually helped Starmer increase his majority in parliament. An odd quirk of British politics is that the percentage of votes a party gets doesn’t necessarily translate to seats. And with Reform performing well in many of the seats that Labour will ultimately win, the hard-right will not only be impossible to ignore in this parliament, but it could easily see its influence grow further.\n\nBritain suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries. If Starmer falters as prime minister, there is every chance that the popular right could continue to capture the public’s imagination, as it has elsewhere in Europe.\n\nLabour gains first new seat of the night, sweeping out a former Conservative minister in Swindon South\n\nThe first of many Labour gains has just been announced – the party has taken Swindon South from the Conservatives.\n\nRobert Buckland, who served as a justice minister in Boris Johnson’s government, has been ousted by Heidi Alexander, a former Labour MP who returned to contest this seat.\n\nThe seat, in western England, was won by the Conservatives last time with an 11% lead, according to the notional results. But Labour earned a thumping majority this time – they won 21,676 votes to the Conservatives’ 12,070.\n\nA disastrous Conservative campaign puts the party on the brink of a worst-ever defeat\n\nThe sight was pitiful – and could easily have been avoided. When Rishi Sunak called the snap vote outside 10 Downing Street, he was drowned out – first by the pouring rain, then by the sound of the D:Ream song “Things Can Only Get Better,” the anthem of Labour’s 1997 election landslide, blaring from a nearby boombox.\n\nThings did not get better for the Conservatives. The campaign went from bad to worse, ending in what is projected to be a heavy defeat. Trying to make smalltalk at a Welsh brewery at an early campaign event, Sunak asked punters if they were excited for the soccer, only to be reminded that Wales had not qualified for the ongoing European Championship. In another campaign stop at the Northern Ireland shipyard that built the Titanic, Sunak, seemingly unaware of the irony, was asked if he, too, was captaining a sinking ship.\n\nBut those gaffes look minor when compared to Sunak’s disastrous decision to leave the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings early to give a routine TV interview that would not air until the following week. The Tories’ patriotic heartlands were outraged: The prime minister left veterans on the beaches. Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, was delighted: Here was an opportunity to snatch more votes from dyspeptic Tories.\n\nMeanwhile, one last sleaze scandal had been brewing. It was revealed that two Conservative candidates and its director of campaigning were under investigation by the gambling watchdog for allegedly placing bets on the date of the general election.\n\n“Gamble-gate,” as it became known, summed up what for many voters may be their lasting impression of the outgoing Conservative government: A prime minister too weak to control many of his party, and a party more interested in its own fortunes than those of the country.\n\nIn pictures: Labour Party leader Keir Starmer\n\nThe center-left Labour Party will win Britain’s general election by a landslide, according to a major exit poll, ending a 14-year era of Conservative rule in decisive fashion and putting its leader Keir Starmer on course to become prime minister.\n\nOnce a leading human-rights lawyer, Starmer became director of public prosecutions in 2008, running the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales — a high-profile job for which he was knighted, making him the first-ever Labour leader to enter the job with the prefix Sir to their name.\n\nStarmer, 61, has promised to be the agent of change that Britain needs. He has pledged to grow the country’s economy by reforming planning laws and investing in a new industrial strategy. He has said he will set up a national wealth fund with £7.3 billion ($9.2 billion) of public money that will help pay for the transition to net zero emissions.\n\nCritics on the right say that Starmer will need to raise taxes to fund his plans, while skeptics on the left say his manifesto is not bold or ambitious enough to change Britain for the better.\n\nSee more photos from Starmer’s career.\n\nLabour win a second seat, and the Conservatives slump again\n\nLabour has won Blyth and Ashington, the second seat of the night to declare, with the populist Reform UK party again putting in a strong showing and coming second.\n\nLabour won 50% of the vote to Reform’s 27%, and the Tories slipped to 15%.\n\nThis is a new constituency, created after the boundaries of the UK’s 650 seats were adjusted following the most recent election in 2019. The borders of most seats in the country have changed at least slightly since that vote, as they do every few decades.\n\nBut Labour would have won this seat with 48% of the vote had it existed in 2019, to the Conservatives’ 34%, according to notional calculations.\n\nThe UK's exit poll is usually very accurate\n\nA reminder: the UK’s election exit poll is usually a very accurate barometer of how many seats each party has won.\n\nBut, as politicians are reminding broadcasters, it is just a poll.\n\nThe exit poll was conducted Thursday at polling stations across the country, collecting a huge sample from across the UK of how people voted. It is then modelled by a panel of experts, and closely guarded from the public and the media.\n\nIn 2019, the exit poll predicted the Conservatives would win 368 seats, just three more than they did when the final results were in. Two years earlier, it missed the Tories’ seat total by three, this time in the opposite direction.\n\nThe first results from the night are in\n\nSunderland South has won the race to declare the first results of the night – and they show a solid Labour result and a huge uptick for the populist party Reform UK.\n\nLabour held the seat, as it was virtually certain to do, and Reform overtook the Conservatives to take second place.\n\nBridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow Education Secretary, becomes the first MP to be elected into the new parliament.\n\nWhat the results indicate: Labour won 47% of the vote in the seat, while Reform picked up 29%. The Conservatives slipped to just 14%.\n\nThis is a traditional Labour stronghold, though the party won it by a narrower margin at the 2019 election – picking up 41% of the vote to 33% for the Conservatives.\n\nMore clues as to the results of the night will come soon, as a handful of seats are expected to declare in the next half hour.\n\nBut Conservatives will be concerned by their drop in Sunderland, while Reform will be hopeful that it can establish itself as a second-placed party in many more seats, while gaining a handful across the country.\n\nExit poll projection of a Labour landslide has margins similar to Tony Blair's 1997 win\n\nLabour’s predicted landslide win is a similar margin to the one that swept the party’s then leader Tony Blair into Downing Street in 1997, according to Gideon Skinner, senior UK Director of Politics at market research company Ipsos.\n\nSkinner told CNN the predicted Labour win could be due, in part, to tactical voting among typical Labour and Liberal Democrat voters.\n\nIn 1997, Blair’s Labour party won 418 seats, the largest majority of seats since 1945. The Conservative Party won 165 seats.\n\nAccording to this year’s exit poll, Labour will win 410 seats. That will hand Keir Starmer a massive parliamentary majority of 170 seats, just shy of the party’s greatest-ever result.\n\nThe Conservatives drop to just 131 seats, a stunning collapse by a governing party, according to the poll.\n\n“A massacre:” Senior Tories react to exit poll results\n\nSenior Conservative politicians have responded with shock to the Labour Party’s projected landslide win in Britain’s general election.\n\nRuth Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, told Sky News: “There is no dressing it up, this is a massacre.”\n\nFormer Conservative Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, who is forecast to lose his seat, told Sky News that he is “used to what defeat looks like and I’m prepared for it.” But he said he hoped his political life would continue. “I’ll be leaving parliament to spend more time on politics,” he quipped.\n\nSteve Baker, who was Rishi Sunak’s Minister of State for Northern Ireland, told the BBC that “it’s a pretty devastating night for the Conservative Party.” Baker is also projected to lose his seat.\n\nBaker said that he’s got a “great deal of respect for Rishi Sunak.” He later added: “I think he will do what he believes is in the national interest.”\n\nShortly before polls closed at 10 p.m., Sunak thanked voters on X. He said: “To the hundreds of Conservative candidates, thousands of volunteers and millions of voters: Thank you for your hard work, thank you for your support, and thank you for your vote.”\n\nHow each party has fared in the exit poll\n\nLabour is projected to win 410 seats, and a massive majority of 170 seats. This would fall just short of the party’s best-ever result, in 1997, when Tony Blair’s Labour won 418 seats, a majority of 179. The result is in line with what pollsters had projected for Labour, which has enjoyed a huge lead in public opinion for years and had held onto that advantage throughout the campaign.\n\nFor the Conservatives, the result is calamitous. The party, which has earned a reputation over the decades as a ruthless election winner, is projected to win just suffer its worst result since its modern iteration was formed in the 1830s. It is an overwhelming rejection of a ruling party by the British electorate, which has dumped the party from government.\n\nThe centrist Liberal Democrats will be pleased with their result, which puts them on course to return as the UK’s third-largest party. The group has suffered since it joined the Tories in a coalition government between 2010 and 2015, but voters have seemingly forgiven them for that stint.\n\nThe Scottish National Party, a pro-independence group that has dominated politics in Scotland for a generation, will be devastated with the forecast. It signals that the Labour Party has regained its historic strength in Scotland and represents a setback for the Scottish independence movement.\n\nAnd Reform UK, the right-wing populist group led by Nigel Farage, has been forecast to win more seats that most pollsters expected. Farage has hammered the Conservatives on their failure to bring down legal and illegal migration, and had been expected to win the seat where he was standing in Clacton, east of London.\n\nKeir Starmer thanks voters and campaigners, as exit poll puts him on the cusp of power\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has thanked campaigners and voters, but he hasn’t commented yet on the results of the exit poll that forecast him a huge majority.\n\nAngela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the exit poll numbers were “encouraging.”\n\n“Keir Starmer has done a tremendous job of transforming the Labour Party and putting forward a program for government that I’m hopeful that people have got behind,” she told BBC immediately after the poll numbers dropped.\n\nRayner said it would “be an absolute honor and a privilege to be reelected,” but added, “I’m not counting my chickens until we’ve got those results coming in.”\n\nSee the full exit poll results\n\nHere’s the full seat breakdown from the exit poll just released.\n\nIt’s a huge return for the Labour Party, a monumental collapse for the Conservatives just five years after they won a landslide election victory, and impressive showings for the centrist Liberal Democrats and the right-wing populist party Reform UK.\n\nLabour: 410 seats\n\nConservatives: 131\n\nLiberal Democrats: 61\n\nReform UK: 13\n\nScottish National Party: 10\n\nOthers: 25\n\nLabour will win 410 seats, exit poll projects, enough for a huge parliamentary majority\n\nLabour will win 410 seats, according to the major exit poll just released. That will hand Keir Starmer a massive parliamentary majority of 170 seats, just shy of the party’s greatest-ever result.\n\nThe Conservatives drop to just 131 seats, a stunning collapse by a governing party, according to the poll.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats will return as the third largest party, with 61 seats.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBREAKING: UK's center-left Labour Party will win general election in a landslide, exit poll projects\n\nThe center-left Labour Party will win Britain’s general election by a landslide, according to a major exit poll, ending a 14-year era of Conservative rule in decisive fashion and putting its leader Keir Starmer on course to become prime minister in the coming hours.\n\nThis is a breaking news story. More details soon…\n\nWe're minutes away from the exit poll\n\nGet ready: the exit poll for Britain’s general election will be released in 10 minutes.\n\nThis is a huge poll, conducted today at polling stations across the country, that forecasts the number of seats each party has won.\n\nIt’s historically an accurate picture of the how the election went, and will set up the narrative of the evening.\n\nWhat is King Charles III's role in the election?\n\nYou may have noticed King Charles III hasn’t been out and about quite as much over the last six weeks and it’s not for the reason you think.\n\nIn fact, soon after Rishi Sunak called for a general election, Buckingham Palace announced the family would postpone engagements “which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign.”\n\nWhile the palace doesn’t usually spell this out, it is pretty standard practice as the royals must stay neutral and above politics. As this is the first general election of Charles III’s reign, there may have been a desire from within the institution to emphasize this. So, what is the 75-year-old King’s role in the election, and can he vote?\n\nFirst off, the PM informed King Charles of his decision to call for a general election. That conversation happened on May 22, and it was at that point that the King agreed to Sunak’s request for the dissolution of parliament. Theoretically, Charles could have refused the request but that would be unprecedented in modern times.\n\nThe King has spent the past few days in Scotland for “Holyrood Week,” an annual celebration in the royal calendar recognizing Scottish culture and community. However, he will be needed back in London by Friday. That’s because the day after a general election, the monarch invites the leader of the party that won the most seats in the House of Commons to Buckingham Palace.\n\nAs head of state, the appointment of prime ministers is one of Charles’s core constitutional duties, along with the State Opening of Parliament and signing parliamentary bills into law. During the audience, they become prime minister and are invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nWhat election day has looked like across Britain\n\nVoters up and down Britain have been putting their cross in their ballot papers, as church halls, schools and sports centers turn into polling stations for the day.\n\nAnd plenty of Brits brought their four-legged companions along for the experience.\n\nBroadcasters can’t report much about the election while polls are open – but there’s no rules preventing us from showing you as many democratic dogs as possible.\n\nThere’s less than an hour until we can bring you some real news – that’s when the exit poll will drop and we’ll get a sense of how the day has gone for all the parties.\n\nWhat to expect - and when - during election night in Britain\n\nVote-counting in Britain begins the second that polls close, and we should have an idea of the winner a few hours later. Here’s a rough timeline of the night:\n\nThe exit poll: At 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET), the very second that polling stations across the UK close, a major exit poll will project the results of the night. The massive poll is conducted during election day, by pollster Ipsos, for the country’s main broadcasters – the BBC, ITV and Sky. Historically, it’s been an accurate guide to how the night will unfold.\n\nThe first results: Around an hour and an half later, at 11:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), is when we can expect the first real results of the night. There’s always a race between a handful of seats in the northeast to declare first; the results here will give us clues as to which parties have had a good night.\n\nKey seats declare: By 2 a.m. (9 p.m. ET), we’ll have seen a handful of results and we’ll start to understand the narratives of the evening.\n\nA flood of results: Between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. (10 p.m. and midnight ET) is when results come in thick and fast, and by the time this period is finished, we usually know who’s won and who’s lost the election.\n\nA trip to the King: After 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) is when we expect the winner of the election to travel to Buckingham Palace, where he will meet King Charles III and receive permission to form Britain’s next government."
