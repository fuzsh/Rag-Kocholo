        "text": "Supported by Edge Hill University’s Student Opportunity Fund, second year BA (Hons) History and Politics student, Caileigh Russell travelled to Aberystwyth for the Plaid Cymru Conference and tells us about her experience.\n\nAttending political events is important for students wanting to understand how politics works. At Edge Hill, our degree content is as real world as possible. That means projects linked to real political organisations, as well as guest speakers and field trips.\n\nOver the two days there was a range of speeches from current Senedd* Members, Members of Parliament and prospective candidates. There were debates on topics like how Plaid is tackling the cost-of-living crisis and what Plaid members think about various health and social care issues. We heard from Liz Saville Roberts, a Member of the UK Parliament, Richard Thompson, a Scottish National Party member of Parliament who speaks on Wales for the party. We also listened to the opening speech by Elin Jones, who is a member of the Senedd.\n\n*The Welsh Parliament is the democratically elected body that represents the interests of Wales and its people. Commonly known as the Senedd, it makes laws for Wales, agrees Welsh taxes and holds the Welsh Government to account.\n\nOutside the main hall there were fringe meetings which covered a broad range of subjects for conference-goers to choose from. These included the involvement of Plaid with the Yes Cymru Campaign and The World Wide Fund for Nature Cymru. In the event space outside there were stalls set up for both days, with both Welsh companies and charities as well as UK ones. There was also an awards ceremony for longstanding Plaid members for their commitment to the party and to their local areas.\n\nGoing to the Plaid Cymru Conference was a great experience. It was the first party political conference I have attended and so it provided me with a good understand of them, including how the schedule works and when is the best time to try and interact with the speakers. Conferences can be confusing for newcomers, so it really helps to understand how these events work.\n\nCaileigh Russell’s visit to the conference was funded through Edge Hill University’s Student Opportunity Fund. The Student Opportunity Fund is an exciting initiative which provides financial support to enable our students to take part in activities which enhance their employability, develop transferable skills, and enrich their student experience. If you are an undergraduate, postgraduate taught, PGCE or MRes student at Edge Hill University, you can apply for up to £2,000 to support a career-enhancing project, initiative or opportunity that will enrich your student experience and enable you to stand out in a competitive environment.\n\nNetworking opportunities. Plenty of lively debates. Field trips to party conferences and political events. Edge Hill gives you a real-world experience of the political landscape."
