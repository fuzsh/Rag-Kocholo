        "text": "Why did Plaid Cymru commission a report on the party’s culture?\n\nFor months Plaid has been dogged by claims of a toxic culture, and it emerged last November that an allegation of sexual assault had been made against a senior member of staff. In December the party asked the former Plaid Senedd member Nerys Evans to look at the scale and scope of the issues.\n\nWhat did the report say?\n\nEvans’s report, Prosiect Pawb (Everyone’s Project), found a culture of sexual harassment, bullying and misogyny. Victims said they felt there was little point in reporting unacceptable behaviour by elected members because it had been tolerated for so long. The report, published on 3 May, decried a lack of leadership, which it said meant the problems had worsened over the last few years. It made 82 recommendations needed to “detoxify” the party.\n\nWhy didn’t Adam Price resign immediately from leadership?\n\nPrice said in public he was deeply sorry and told the party hierarchy he felt “morally bound” to step down. But Evans, as well as the party’s chair, Marc Jones, and its Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said he was best placed to drive through change and should stay. He agreed that to leave would be an “abdication of responsibility” and planned to remain.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nNot all Plaid members in the Senedd agreed that Price should stay. In his resignation letter, Price said: “It is now clear I no longer have the united support of my colleagues.” He stepped down on Wednesday, a week after the report was published. Saville Roberts said the discussions around him had become a distraction.\n\nWhat did Price achieve?\n\nSeen by many in Plaid as a “once in a generation” politician, Price became leader in 2018 after ousting Leanne Wood. He had previously made his mark in UK politics when, as an MP, he headed an unsuccessful attempt to impeach the then prime minister, Tony Blair, over claims that Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhen he returned to Welsh politics, one of his campaign leaflets called him “mab darogan” – the son of prophecy. He put Welsh independence front and centre. Price also led his party into a cooperation agreement with the Labour-led government, which has resulted in a commitment to providing free school meals to all primary school children, and brought about “radical” changes to rules around second homes, a thorny issue in many areas where Plaid is traditionally strong, such as north-west Wales.\n\nDid he make the electoral gains he hoped for?\n\nNo – Plaid won four Westminster seats at the 2019 general election. One of the MPs elected on a Plaid ticket, Jonathan Edwards, was suspended after being cautioned by the police for assaulting his wife and now sits as an independent. Plaid is the third largest party at the Senedd, with 12 of the 60 members. Opinion polls do not suggest it has made gains in recent months.\n\nWho will take over as leader?\n\nAmong the figures being touted as the next possible leader is Rhun ap Iorwerth, the member for Ynys Môn (Anglesey), though he was set to stand as an MP and the Plaid leader has to be a member of the Senedd. Delyth Jewell, who represents South Wales East, is another possible candidate. Llyr Gruffydd, who will take over as interim leader, will not stand in the leadership contest. It is a huge job that will involve juggling the implementation of the 82 recommendations in Prosiect Pawb alongside steering Plaid into the next general election.\n\nDoes this have wider implications?"
