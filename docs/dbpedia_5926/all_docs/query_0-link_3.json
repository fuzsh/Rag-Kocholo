        "text": "Plaid Cymru should call itself the New Wales Party in a bid to attract voters, leadership hopeful Adam Price has said.\n\nThe Carmarthen East and Dinefwr AM said the party needed to create a \"story of optimism and hope\" to aim for assembly election victories in 2021 and 2026.\n\nWriting for the Western Mail, external, Mr Price said the proposed name would signal that Plaid \"is the party of Wales' future\".\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth is also challenging Plaid leader Leanne Wood for her job.\n\nMr Price said the party's former leader Dafydd Wigley coined the phrase \"New Wales Party\" ahead of the first-ever assembly elections in 1999.\n\nHe also referred to a party review after the 2011 election, which saw the end of Plaid's spell in government as part of a coalition with Labour.\n\n\"That looked at creating a new name in English to signal that we are a pan-Wales party,\" Mr Price said.\n\n\"But what about a new bilingual name to signal that we are the party of Wales' future?\"\n\nThe article proposed no Welsh version of the suggested new name."
