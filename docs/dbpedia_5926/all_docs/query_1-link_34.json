        "text": "Plaid Cymru launched its general election manifesto on Thursday, June 13. The Party of Wales pledged to put Wales first and \"fight every day” for a fairer funding system.\n\nThe document is their pitch for votes, and breaks down what the party says it would do if it got into power after the vote on July 4. At the Temple of Peace in Cardiff on Thursday, Rhun ap Iorwerth MS launched the party’s manifesto for the first time as leader. The Ynys Mon Member of Senedd was joined by the party's candidate for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru candidate for the new constituency of Caerfyrddin Ann Davies, and Plaid Cymru candidate for Cardiff West Kiera Marshall.\n\nDuring his speech, Mr ap Iorwerth said that it was a “day to spell out [their] vision” and said that people felt “utterly uninspired” by both the Conservative and Labour parties. He said that the “common thread” that ran through the manifesto was “fairness”, notably vowing to fight for the money “owed for Wales” through HS2 and scrapping the Barnett Formula.\n\nREAD MORE: Wales would not control its police forces under Labour government, shadow home secretary says\n\nLATEST: 'Foolish' Welsh MP who put £100 bet on the General Election date refuses to say if he had inside information\n\nIn his speech, he said: \"As an internationalist party, unlike Labour and the Tories we in Plaid Cymru are not afraid to call out the disastrous consequences of severing ties with the world's largest trading bloc. We have been clear, consistent and unequivocal in recent years that rejoining the Single Market and Customs Union are vital in order to mitigate the impact of Brexit on Welsh business and reduce overheads and administrative costs.\"\n\n\"Fair funding for Wales,\" he added. \"Plaid Cymru is the only party advocating for the abolition of the Barnett Formula which has seen Wales lose out to the tune of billions over the years. It's not a begging bowl, it's just what's right, enabling investment in public services and the economy.\"\n\nHe then added: \"Let me be clear, this appeal for fair funding isn't driven by ideology but by principle. Remember, there's nothing inevitable about our poverty and nothing intrinsic to our people which means we cannot create a thriving economy and world-class public services, given the tools we need. So, to the next UK Government we say this - show you're serious about Wales and resolve the long-standing fair funding issues.\"\n\nWith the number of constituencies changing from 40 to 32, the latest polling has projected that Plaid Cymru would take three seats, taking Caerfyrddin as well as Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Ceredigion Preseli.\n\nThe party’s 142 page manifesto has a number of pledges for votes, which includes:\n\nSecuring the £4bn “owed to Wales” from HS2\n\nDemanding a fair funding system for Wales\n\nFair funding from Westminster for the NHS workforce\n\nA new cancer strategy\n\nHelp thousands of families to deal with the cost of living crisis\n\nIncreasing windfall taxes on oil and gas companies\n\nDevolving the Crown Estate\n\nMaking the case for independence as the \"best way\" to deliver fairness and ambition for Wales\n\nSee the UK join the European Single Market\n\nIncreasing child benefit by £20 per week per child\n\nWorking closely with local authorities to find the causes and actions to rectify when targets for Welsh medium education improvements have been missed\n\nIt follows the publication of the Labour, Greens’, Conservatives’ and Liberal Democrats’ manifestos. Here are the key pledges from Plaid Cymru’s general election manifesto.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which has been analysing all the parties' manifestos, questioned the cost implications of Plaid's manifesto saying it would result in higher taxes.\n\nDavid Phillips of the IFS said: \"Many spending pledges relate to areas controlled by the Welsh Government, including ambitions for free personal care, free childcare from 12 months, and free school meals for all secondary school children. Given the funding outlook, such measures would likely require the Welsh Government to make cuts elsewhere or increase taxation\".\n\nHe added that increasing child benefit by £20 a week in Wales would require people in Wales to pay an extra 2% in income tax. And he warned that Plaid's call for a needs-based funding formula could result in Wales receiving less money not more.\n\nJoin our General Election WhatsApp community by clicking on this link, and selecting 'Join Community'.

You will receive updates from us daily and through the night on July 4.\n\nEconomy\n\nPlaid has made a promise to secure the £4bn “owed to Wales” from HS2. During his speech, Rhun ap Iorwerth criticised the UK Treasury's decision to class the HS2 high-speed rail project as an \"England and Wales\" scheme despite none of the track being in Wales. This has meant that Wales has lost billions in funding, whereas extra funding was given to the devolved nations of Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe manifesto pledges to use the money to invest in improving “our own public transport” in all parts of the country and reversing cuts to local bus services. The document also vows to demand a “fair funding system” for Wales based around the country’s needs and providing public services that “we deserve”.\n\nIt goes on to say that the party wants to scrap the “out-dated” Barnett formula and call for a “new needs-based” funding formula to replace it. They pledge to redress “economic unfairness”, which they say they will achieve by increasing windfall taxes, primarily on oil and gas companies, as is the policy in Scotland.\n\nIn response to the publication of the manifesto, David Phillips, an associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies and head of local and devolved finance said that Plaid’s manifesto “rightly” highlighted the “arbitrary nature” of funding for the devolved nations under the Barnett formula, but argued that while the needs-based formula would be fairer, it wouldn’t necessarily mean more funding for Wales.\n\nHealthcare\n\nThe party promises to have the NHS “properly funded” through a “new fairer and needs-based” funding model, which they say would enable them to invest in the NHS workforce and recruit 500 GPs into Wales. As noted in Rhun ap Iorwerth’s speech, the party also pledges to introduce a cancer strategy, which they say would “ensure no downgrading of urgent suspected cancer referrals”, lower the sensitivity threshold for bowel cancer screening and increase rates of lung cancer screening in order to ensure that more cancers are caught and treated earlier.\n\nThe manifesto also pledges to “move public health towards becoming a wellness service”, which would be geared towards “keeping people healthy”. It also pledges to pay social care workers £1 above the Real Living Wage in order to make the job “more attractive” and improve recruitment.\n\nWelfare\n\nThe manifesto also vowed to tackle child poverty. Having successfully pushed for the free school meals in primary schools through its cooperation agreement with the Welsh Labour in the Senedd, the party vowed to take things further by increasing child benefit by £20 per week for all children.\n\nIt said that this initiative would help the 330,000 families and more than 550,000 children and young people who were eligible for the benefit. The party also vowed to scrap the Conservatives’ policy of the “two-child” limit on universal credit payments and end the benefit cap, which stops families claiming the full amount.\n\nWales as a ‘sovereign independent nation’\n\nIn his speech, Rhun ap Iorwerth did not mention Welsh independence and the concept does not appear until page 42 of the manifesto. The document says that the party will prepare a Green Paper on the path to independence and create a National Commission, which aims to improve the “health of our democracy”. It adds: “Plaid Cymru will make the case that independence is not viable, but desirable, and we will engage with the people of Wales to persuade its merits, recognising that recent years have shown a significant growth in the number of people becoming indy-curious and indy-convinced”.\n\nWhile the manifesto says that Wales would be “best served” by re-joining the EU, in the meantime, it calls on the UK to join the European Single Market and Customs Union “as soon as practical”. It also says that the Welsh Government should “participate fully” in the structures governing the current EU-UK relationship.\n\nEnvironment\n\nIn the manifesto, Plaid vows to ensure that Wales takes “full control” over the Crown Estate. As pledged previously by the party, they also want to devolve the Crown Estate, which is an independent company that belongs to the monarch for the duration of their reign, in order to create green jobs and build prosperity.\n\nThe party also wants to see the introduction of Social Tariff for Energy, devolve the responsibilities of Ofgem and establish a Welsh energy systems operator. It also vows to tackle the nature emergency of “great importance”. It adds: “We support a science-led plan aligned with the 2022 Kumming-Montreal agreement to ensure that nature loss is firmly in reverse as soon as possible”.
