        "text": "What I’d like to see in Plaid Cymru’s manifesto when it comes to defence and foreign policy.\n\nOn 22 May, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak fired the starting pistol for the UK’s 2024 general election, to be held on 4 July.\n\nThis means each political party will finalise and publish its manifesto, the document that will tell the public what policies they’d vote for and provide a mandate for—or not—in this election.\n\nAs a Plaid Cymru member, I’m looking forward to reading my party’s manifesto and seeing what it offers for the people of Wales. As someone with an interest in foreign policy and defence, I’m especially keen to read the ‘Peace and Security’ section of their manifesto.\n\nThis article is the opinion of the author and not necessarily that of the UK Defence Journal. If you would like to submit your own article on this topic or any other, please see our submission guidelines.\n\nAs a political party, Plaid Cymru tends to be mostly a left-of-centre party which is also pro-Welsh independence, pro-European Union and tends to draw inspiration from Ireland, so can be considered to favour\n\nnonalignment/neutrality more than membership in NATO when it comes to defence and foreign policy.\n\nOne guaranteed policy in the manifesto will be its objection to nuclear weapons and any nuclear weapons being based in Wales and I’d expect an objection to national service to be in there as well and I hope that the policies I suggest in the rest of this article might be in there as well or adopted in the future.\n\nWelsh troops to be based in Wales\n\nOne of Plaids long standing policies is for the regular battalions of the Welsh regiments to be based in Wales. At the moment, none are, as they’re all based in England. From 2028, the 1st Queens Dragoon Guards (the Welsh Cavalry) will move from Swanton in Norfolk to a revamped Caerwent barracks near Chepstow. They’re to share this facility with the 1st Battalion, the Rifles.\n\nPlaid Cymru should demand that the UK government change this and base the 1st Battalion Royal Welsh Regiment at Caerwent instead. 1 Rifles can move to Tidworth in England, replacing 1 Royal Welsh. They should also demand that the UK government base the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards in Wales when they are not performing ceremonial duties in London. These regiments could then be brigaded together as part of a UK Army Brigade. This would allow troops from Wales much more of an opportunity to have a career within Wales.\n\nAs the Royal Navy doesn’t have a regular presence in Wales, Plaid Cymru should demand that the UK government establishes that. Wales only has a reserve presence in HMS Cambria in Cardiff with a subunit in Swansea. Basing a River class batch 1 Offshore Patrol Vessel in Wales could remedy this lack of presence. It should also seek the goal of it primarily being crewed by Welsh Royal Navy personnel, allowing them to have a Royal Navy career within Wales.\n\nManifesto powers for Senedd Cymru\n\nThe Senedd Cymru and Welsh government should be the bodies deciding how much money is allocated to Wales for defence spending in the Government Expenditure Revenue Wales (GERW). At the moment, it’s decided by population, which means that Wales is close to – and in the future will be allocated – over 3% of GDP in the defence column in GERW, the NATO level is 2%, and the European average is 1.4%. This helps inflates Wales’s deficit as part of the UK, which is often used in the argument against an independent Wales.\n\nPlaid Cymru should also include in its manifesto that recruitment from Wales for the UK Armed Forces be devolved to the Welsh government with a focus that troops from Wales be assigned to Welsh-based units as much as possible, to lessen the ‘brain drain’/skills exodus that Wales experiences with the Welsh units not currently based in Wales. The recruitment contract has been held by the company Capita since 2012. Like so many privatisations, it’s not been a great success.\n\nA policy I’d also like to see is Plaid seeking to get more engagement between Welsh military units and the Defence Force of Ireland as part of ongoing strengthening of the relationship between Wales and Ireland that both governments are undertaking.\n\nSupport for Ukraine and Palestine\n\nPlaid Cymru should be demanding that the UK government increase support for Ukraine to help them liberate their country from Russian aggression and commit to spending 0.25% of GDP on support for Ukraine as suggested by the Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and that Welsh arms factories concentrate solely on supplying arms to Ukraine and that the UK government engage with Welsh companies to supply aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe party should also be demanding that the UK government guarantees no companies – especially companies from Wales – are sending arms to Israel, commit to a ceasefire in Gaza and follow Ireland, Norway and Spain in recognising Palestine as a state.\n\nAs supporters of Welsh independence, in the end, the goal for a pro-independence party should be a Welsh Defence Force/Armed Forces and an independent foreign policy as a sovereign state. Plaid Cymru should be looking to elaborate on what that could look like under its leadership. Such a vision can be used as a challenge to Westminster – showing that Wales can have a defence and foreign policy that benefits its citizens and forces that focus on Welsh security rather than purely Westminster-centric goals. Plaid Cymru must show its vision for an independent Wales in all areas of life in its manifesto and beyond.\n\nThis article was written by Jeremy Brookman and was originally posted in BylinesCymru."
