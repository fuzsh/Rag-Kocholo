        "text": "Plaid Cymru have been hit with a £29,000 fine by the elections watchdog for a \"sustained failure\" to report accurately on party donations.\n\nThe Electoral Commission revealed over a two-year period they made nine inaccurate spending reports, omitting donations worth more than £497,000.\n\nAn investigation by the watchdog found a \"lack of effective internal processes\" had led to their £29,268 penalty, but the party said the errors were a result of an \"oversight\" which had been \"immediately corrected\".\n\nLouise Edwards from the commission said Plaid's failure had led to a \"disappointing lack of transparency\".\n\n\"The total number and value of donations omitted from Plaid Cymru's quarterly reports is significant and reveals a substantial degree of non-compliance. Plaid Cymrue is a well-established party and it should be able to meet its reporting obligations,\" she added.\n\n\"It is vital that voters can see full and accurate financial reports that show where a political party's money comes from.\n\n\"Plaid Cymru's sustained failure over a two-year period to understand and meet its legal duties led to a disappointing lack of transparency into the party's finances.\n\nMs Edwards said: \"Voters can have confidence that, where parties fail to comply with the rules and there is no reasonable explanation, we will take action.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the party, who have until 2 March to pay the fine, said: \"The matters highlighted by the Commission are historic in nature and do not involve any private donations.\n\n\"As soon as Plaid Cymru were notified, the Party immediately corrected this oversight and is now in full compliance.\n\n\"All public funds have been fully reported in the Party's Annual Report.\"\n\nPoliticsHome Newsletters"
