        "text": "Plaid Cymru has pulled out of its co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government.\n\nThe two parties signed up to the three-year deal in 2021, agreeing to work together in a raft of policy areas in the Senedd.\n\nHowever, the smaller partner has now withdrawn with immediate effect, seven months before the agreement was due to officially end.\n\nPolitics live: Co-operation agreement in Wales comes to abrupt end\n\nPlaid's leader Rhun ap Iorwerth told Sky News he met with Welsh Labour First Minister Vaughan Gething earlier today to reveal the decision, blaming a \"change in attitude\" from the government that meant \"a number of things had been brought into focus\".\n\nHe said he questioned the \"judgement\" of Mr Gething over his decision not to pay back a controversial Â£200,000 donation, which has dogged the early days of his premiership, and he was \"worried by the circumstances\" around the sacking of Welsh minister Hannah Blythyn this week after a row over a leaked text message.\n\n\"[All] in all, it led us to believe that the right thing and the natural time now was for us to leave the agreement,\" he told Sky News' political correspondent Tamara Cohen.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth denied the move was aimed at gathering support for a no-confidence motion in the first minister, saying: \"That's not what this is about. In fact, under the co-operation agreement, such was our freedom to be a firm opposition party that we could still have voted for no confidence even with the cooperation agreement.\n\n\"This is about saying, listen, the time has come. The government has changed its attitudes. We have a first minister mired in controversy.\"\n\nHe added: \"We need to be making it very, very clear that we have an alternative vision for the future Wales. And we're going to be talking about that boldly and confidently and showing a level of fairness and ambition for Wales that we're not getting from the Labour government.\"\n\nMr Gething released a statement, saying: \"While it was always a time-limited agreement, we are disappointed Plaid Cymru has decided to walk away from their opportunity to deliver for the people of Wales.\"\n\nAfter thanking the Plaid members of the Senedd he had worked with, the first minister said Welsh Labour would now \"look closely at how we can progress the outstanding co-operation agreement commitments\" around language education and housing.\n\nThe two parties agreed to work on almost 50 policy areas when the deal was first signed in 2021, after Welsh Labour won 30 of the 60 seats at the last Senedd elections - failing to get an outright majority.\n\nIt fell short of a formal coalition agreement, like that signed between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Westminster in 2010, or the power-sharing deal made between the SNP and Green Party that recently collapsed, with none of the 13 Plaid members serving as ministers.\n\nThe agreement bore fruit, however, with policies around free school meals and energy passing through the parliament - which both leaders praised in separate statements.\n\nBut there had been some reports in recent months that Plaid was looking to pull out of the deal, with Mr ap Iorwerth telling the BBC his party had \"every right to discuss the length of the deal\" ahead of its official end in December.\n\nSources suggested Labour would see it as an opportune moment to end the agreement ahead of the general election, due before the end of the year.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nThe leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said the end of cooperation between two of his rival parties was \"simply an attempt to save face\".\n\nHe added: \"Labour and Plaid have worked together to divert resources away from the people's priorities and towards vanity projects like putting more Senedd members in Cardiff Bay, and have been hand in glove on policies like the destructive sustainable farming scheme and 20mph.\n\n\"This move from Plaid means nothing and the Welsh public won't be fooled.\""
