        "text": "It was, when it was signed, described as a \"new form of political working arrangement\". Labour and Plaid Cymru would work together not in a coalition but as part of a co-operation deal. But the deal came crashing down days ago, ending earlier than expected. There's no doubt politics was part of it – Vaughan Gething is under pressure and Rhun ap Iorwerth's damning statement dealt his authority another blow.\n\nFor Plaid Cymru, the third party in terms of size in the Senedd, the deal signed in December 2021 was a way of getting a seat at the table where decisions were made. For Labour it was the only way they'd get the votes they needed to get major policies – including Wales' £22bn annual budget – through the Senedd.\n\nIt covered 46 areas ranging from the delivery of free school meals to all primary school pupils to the second homes crisis and Senedd reform. Both parties had their own priorities. Some of those aligned but there was some give and take. For example changing the dates of school holidays was a Labour policy, not something Plaid had ever promised, but Plaid agreed to support it if Labour made concessions such as not altering the dates to a period which would affect key events in the lives of their core supporters like the Royal Welsh Show or the National Eisteddfod.\n\nREAD MORE: Poll shows huge drop in support for Vaughan Gething\n\nREAD MORE: Rishi Sunak came to Wales but no voters would actually have known\n\nOn May 15 a press release, embargoed for the next day, was sent out about one of the flagship pledges – the offer of universal free meals to all primary pupils. The First Minister then took part in a visit to a school on May 16, which broadcaster ITV was invited to join, talk about the scheme.\n\nHowever by then Mr Gething had decided to sack his minister Hannah Blythyn, alleging she had been the source of a leak, and a question was put to him at that visit about how he'd reached his decision. It was an almost unprecedented step to take and the drama only heightened when Ms Blythyn issued her own statement denying the accusation from the First Minister that she'd leaked anything and pointedly making clear her integrity remains intact.\n\nWithin a few hours Plaid Cymru had convened a meeting of its Senedd group members and decided to end the agreement. By May 17 it was clear something was afoot as rumours began to emerge as the two parties spent the morning drafting their respective statements to issue publicly.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth, the party's leader, announced at 2.25pm on Friday the agreement was ending with \"immediate effect\" and the First Minister followed with his words. From there things moved quickly. The Plaid Cymru staff who had been working on the deal were placed on gardening leave and it paved the way for the two MSs whose role had been in the agreement, Sian Gwenllian and Cefin Campbell, back to their group from the decision-making table.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth had already sought agreement to end the agreement in the summer – months before the initial intention of a conclusion in December. By summer it was accepted that both sides could walk away happy having ticked off big items like Senedd reform, a Welsh language education bill, and extension to the free childcare scheme.\n\nThere would be, by then, successes that could be written in black and white and explained to voters simply. It also freed up the parties to go and campaign in the general election without being constrained. But it never got there.\n\nJoin our General Election WhatsApp community by clicking on this link and selecting 'Join Community'. No-one else will be able to see your personal information and you’ll only receive messages from WalesOnline’s team. You will receive updates from us daily and through the night on July 4.\n\nThe agreement was signed by Adam Price and Mark Drakeford, neither of whom are now in charge of their respective parties, and that changed the dynamic. But there were people within both parties who questioned the agreement. As of the point Mr Gething took over the description of the Plaid dynamics were that around a third never wanted the co-operation agreement, a third supported it, and the remaining third were somewhere in the middle. Those who were against it opposed close working with Labour and feared the ability to sell it on the doorsteps to voters when elections come around.\n\nBut since March 16, when Mr Gething was announced as the next Welsh Labour leader, the date of the agreement's expiry had edged further forward. The acceptance of donations from a man convicted of environmental offences was seen as being handled badly and it was growing increasingly hard for Mr ap Iorwerth to stand in the Senedd chamber and criticise Mr Gething but then go sit round a table with him to discuss policy.\n\nIf the foundations of the wall which was the cooperation agreement had been shaken over the donations furore the structure was then tipping over delays to plans to reform council tax. But it was the sacking of Ms Blythyn that was the puff of air that was needed to knock it over, as it was put to me.\n\nPlaid Cymru wants reform of council tax because it believes in a fairer and more progressive system that helps those who are poorest and being negatively affected by the current arrangement. But Mr Gething, against the wishes of his cooperation agreement partners and his own finance minister, tore up the plans. After consulting people about the timescale and range of the plans, as well as a further option being put on the table, the First Minister overruled both Plaid and finance minister Rebecca Evans and opted to kick reform to 2028.\n\nFrom Labour's side there was an acceptance Plaid would end the deal sooner than the summer but the speed at which the party rallied and got together in those hours between the Thursday night and Friday afternoon surprised Labour with the speed at which the deal ended. It also, I'm told, has left some in Plaid ranks unhappy.\n\nIt leaves the to-do list that it was expected would have been ticked off by the summer incomplete. The Welsh-language education bill and housing white paper remain outstanding. We await a rescheduled update on the plan to change the dates of school terms but widely expect that to be scrapped.\n\nThe added dynamic of ditching that policy is that it was a Mark Drakeford project and something he fiercely believes in. Unravelling his legacy in front of his eyes while he sits on the backbenches is a big call. Plaid had offered its support to Labour on the policy but on the condition it would have no impact on Royal Welsh Show or the Eisteddfod.\n\nWithout Plaid’s support it could be that Labour scrap it entirely or go ahead and mess with those dates, which would rankle Plaid backers. But this isn't all on Plaid Cymru. The body language from the Labour group when they file into their seats behind Mr Gething is damning. It is silent. A silence that tells a thousand words. The analogies being used for the First Minister include that his credit has all gone and he’s in his overdraft and that’s a dangerous place to be. It’s likely to be something else, whether UK Government or Sir Keir Starmer-related, that sinks him.\n\nThe First Minister doesn't want school term reform nor does he want council tax reform. So both have been or are expected to be shelved to the detriment of relations with the people in his own party who had championed them. Both were headline policies and personal projects of his predecessor Drakeford. Rather than pick policies to unite his group he has exerted his muscle and pushed, or is pushing, those further off the statute books.\n\nTo get measures through Labour will have to make ad hoc deals and doing deals when you're battered and bruised is hard. Mr Gething wants to put donations, questions about his donor businessman David Neal, any influence on government, and sackings to one side.\n\nTwo things have bought him, depending on which side you're on, either a stay of execution or a chance to redeem himself. The general election being called gives Mr Gething six weeks' grace and put opposition plans on hold. Politicos will be busy. He can go and campaign as Labour will not risk ruining its chances for a UK landslide with internal politics but, equally, the scrutiny on Sir Keir will now face questions about the judgement of one of his own on any campaign visit.\n\nBut Senedd rules mean that any opposition party which wants to put forward a no-confidence vote in Mr Gething has to do so by 6pm on the Wednesday of the week before. That does not allow flexibility or reaction to a breaking story. With the Hannah Blythyn sacking the opposition could have played a no-confidence card but it would not have been heard for two further weeks by which time any fuss would have long since died down.\n\nWhile it seems discussions were taking place between politicians of different colours about the way to move forward Plaid didn't intend to call for a no-confidence vote itself and were waiting on the prospect of any such Tory motion. Both were aware, though, that it is easier to fight an election against a politician who is wounded.\n\nNow the election has change the dynamic once more. But one thing is for certain – it hasn't stopped the questions. It appears that will take more than six weeks."
