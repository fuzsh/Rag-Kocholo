References to notional 2019 results are estimates based on analysis by Rallings, Thrasher, Professor David Denver (Scotland) and Nicholas Whyte (Northern Ireland) for Sky News, PA, BBC News and ITV News. Seats included in the ‘Red Wall’ and ‘Blue Wall’ have been recalculated by Bloomberg for the new constituency boundaries using weightings from the House of Commons."
