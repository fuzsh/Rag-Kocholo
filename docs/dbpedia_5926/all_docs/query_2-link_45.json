        "text": "Whichever way you look at it Plaid Cymru's new leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has a mountain to climb. Perhaps the only task more daunting is that of the London-based journalists who are inevitably going to get themselves in a flap trying to pronounce his name.\n\nThere are two big issues in Adam Price's replacement's inbox - reforming the party's culture and rejuvenating the party's stagnant electoral performance.\n\nRead more:The Welsh Tories and the hole at the heart of their rhetoric on the NHS\n\nThough the first one is clearly the most urgent, there is also a clearer route to achieving it. Nerys Evans' report had 80+ recommendations many of which have already been taken up. This doesn't mean that this will be easy, just that there is at least a road map for tackling it.\n\nThe far harder issue is going to be changing the party's electoral fortunes. Despite Adam Price stating before the 2021 Senedd election that anything less than the First Minister would be a failure, Plaid have been stuck in third place for years. They grew their support (slightly) in their heartlands but dropped in support in areas like the south Wales valleys (which unfortunately for Plaid is where far more people live).\n\nPolicy wise Adam Price had two big calling cards. Throughout his leadership Welsh independence was put front and centre of everything Plaid did. It was the answer to every problem and, unlike previous years for Plaid, was loudly trumpeted on the doorstep when campaigning. The second signature Price policy, especially after the disappointing 2021 election, was that Plaid didn't need to defeat Welsh Labour but instead \"guide\" them to policies that Plaid liked. This was seen in the cooperation agreement.\n\nIn his speech Rhun ap Iorwerth indicated that he would not be making any changes to Plaid's overtly pro-indy and pro-cooperation policy. He has also said he will \"lean heavily\" on Adam Price going forward. So this begs the question, how is a Rhun led Plaid going to be any different to what came before? And if the answer is \"not a lot\" then how is this going to change the dial when it comes to the polls?\n\nNow just because there is no clear answer at this point doesn't mean there won't be one. It is very early days of the Rhun era. Just a month ago he was gearing up to run as an MP. It would be unfair to expect him to immediately have a plan to crack the nut that has foiled Plaid leaders for decades.\n\nBut if in five years the party are still having the same conversation it won't be just Plaid who suffer. Wales is crying out for a credible opposition and at the moment, the person who will be happiest by the noises coming out of Plaid Cymru could be Mark Drakeford.\n\nRead more:"
