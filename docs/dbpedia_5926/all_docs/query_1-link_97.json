        "text": "Updated The LibDems in Wales have cybersquatted on two domains of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru. Visit www.plaid-cymru.co.uk and you'll find this entertaining disclaimer: \"This site and the domains www.plaid-cymru.co.uk and www.plaid.co.uk are not connected in any way with Plaid Cymru.\"\n\nSo what is it doing with the sites? Why, waging cyberwar of course. But in the only way the LibDems can - by being completely open and really quite nice and fair about it.\n\nThe site consists of just one page that lists the LibDems main beef with Plaid Cymru. This comes down to four points - written in both Welsh and English. The truly funny thing about this though is that after all the trouble the LibDems have gone to, the four points are simply ridiculous. Perhaps they were written by some over-zealous work experience boy who has \"Internet skills\".\n\n1. Plaid Cymru MPs are irrelevant at Westminster\n\nThe logic here is that because Plaid Cymru has only a dozen MPs, they can't make any difference and so the LibDems should be given the seats. This is incredibly silly argument and would appear to be anti-democratic. Besides, has anyone noticed the enormous effect the LibDems have had in Parliament over the last four years? No? Oh.\n\n2. Plaid Cymru does not have a costed, programme for government\n\nHang on. The previous point was lambasting them for being too small and now they're being blamed for not producing a plan for running government. Is this really the best the LibDems can do?\n\n3. Plaid Cymru is a nationalist Party\n\nNow will someone please tell me what person living in the UK does not know that Plaid Cymru is a nationalist party? That's the whole bloody point of Plaid Cymru. The name itself is a bit of a give away. At this point, I was convinced point four would be \"Plaid Cymru uses a dragon as its logo\". But no.\n\n4. Plaid Cymru politicians say different things in different places\n\nLOL. This must be the funniest criticism ever made of a political party. Whatever next? Plaid Cymru politicians are economical with the truth? Plaid Cymru politicians play up to the media? Plaid Cymru politicians have had affairs?\n\nWhile we admire the LibDems for getting down and dirty and waging cyberwar, this is a pitiful first effort. They should learn from the Labour party which in January this year posted anonymous anti-Plaid comments on newsgroups. Unfortunately, the posters forgot to disguise their IP addresses, which pointed to the Labour HQ at Millbank.\n\nUpdate\n\nApparently a group calling itself the Imperial Tories have also taken over www.plaidcymru.com. What has everyone got against Plaid Cymru? Probably something to do with the fact that the three main parties can't believe that anyone else could hold any power - Plaid Cymru comes second only to Labour in terms of the seats it has in the Welsh assembly.\n\nHowever, all is not lost. Compulsive domain name buyer John Pepin has been in touch to say that he has LiberalDemocrat.co.uk and .org.uk, if Plaid Cymru fancy having a go back. Bring it on, we say.\n\nÂ®\n\nRelated Links\n\nwww.plaid-cymru.co.uk\n\nOfficial Plaid Cymru site\n\nRelated Story"
