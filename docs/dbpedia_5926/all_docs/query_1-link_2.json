        "text": "The agreement will respect the Civil Service and its obligations, together with the statutory, legal and accountability framework within which the civil service is obliged to operate. Subject to that framework, the Welsh Government civil service will work constructively with Plaid Cymru to enable the successful operation of the Agreement.\n\nAny Special Advisers appointed by the First Minister to help support the agreement will be required to work within the provisions of the Welsh Government Special Advisers Code of Conduct. As with all Special Advisers, they will have no authority to instruct the civil service. Special Advisers appointed under this agreement will have access to information which is necessary for them to perform their role effectively in relation to the policy areas of the Agreement.\n\nSpecial Advisers work with Ministers and civil servants as part of considering and deciding on preferred options for delivery and implementation. Special Advisers will contribute to prioritisation of delivery and implementation, which is likely to be an important consideration during the Agreement given other pressures and competing priorities.\n\nPlaid Cymru designated members will not have access to civil servants beyond the machinery agreed by Ministers.\n\nThe First Minister and the Permanent Secretary expect the civil service to work constructively with Plaid Cymru designated members in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Plaid Cymru designated members will have the same responsibilities as Welsh Government Ministers to respect the political impartiality of the civil service, the arrangements for management of the civil service by the Permanent Secretary and the provisions of the Civil Service Recruitment Code and the Governance Code for Public Appointments (on GOV.UK). They will not ask civil servants to do anything which might be contrary to the Civil Service Code, or to use public resources for party political purposes. Plaid Cymru designated members, as Ministers do, will treat the civil service with professionalism, courtesy and respect and can expect this to be reciprocated by the civil service.\n\nWhen working under the provisions of this agreement or when participating in activities under this agreement, the Leader of Plaid Cymru, Plaid Cymru designated lead member, and other Plaid Cymru designated members, will be bound by the Code of Conduct at Annex A, which reflects the analogous sections of the Ministerial Code and the standards and behaviour to which Ministers are expected to adhere.\n\nPlaid Cymru designated members will pay due regard to the advice from the civil service which they receive and, in particular, the advice of the Permanent Secretary as Principal Accounting Officer (or his representatives) on the proper use of public funds. Any conflicts which may arise with the responsibilities of the Principal Accounting Officer would need to be resolved through dialogue and, if necessary, by means of a Ministerial Direction.\n\nDesignated members will not divulge the content of advice received from officials, whether written or oral, nor any official documents received or seen by them in the course of their roles. They will also respect the GDPR requirements upon the Welsh Government. In addition, any legal advice of the Counsel General or the Director of Legal Services and their staff should be regarded by Members as carrying legal professional privilege and should not be disclosed or referred to elsewhere whether given orally or in written or electronic format.\n\nNote: Designated members are those Members of the Plaid Cymru Senedd Group appointed by the Leader of Plaid Cymru and whose names are provided to the First Minister. A list of designated members will be published on the Welsh Government website. Those names may change from time and time and all changes will be reported as soon as practicable to the First Minister. Members of the Plaid Cymru Senedd Group are only bound by this Code during the period of their appointment as designated members.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. This Code is for Plaid Cymru designated members (“Designated Members”) when they are participating in activities covered by participation in the Cooperation Agreement and is based upon the relevant sections of the Ministerial Code. The intention is that Designated Members agree to be bound by the same standards and expectations as are placed upon Welsh Government Ministers, insofar as they are relevant and adaptable to the circumstances of the Co-operation Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Code is applicable only when Designated Members are engaged in activities in relation to matters covered by the Co-operation Agreement and nothing in this Code is intended to go beyond the obligations already incumbent upon Welsh Government Ministers.\n\nConduct\n\n2. Designated Members are expected to maintain high standards of behaviour and to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety when undertaking activity in matters relating to the Co-operation Agreement, as they are expected to do in their role as MSs. Designated Members should be professional in all their dealings and treat all those with whom they come into contact with consideration and respect. In particular, they are expected to observe the Seven Principles of Public Life.\n\n3. The First Minister and the Leader of Plaid Cymru, in consultation, are the ultimate judge of compliance with this Code.\n\nDesignated Members and their Wellbeing\n\n4. Both the First Minister and the Leader of Plaid Cymru recognise that at times the pressure upon Designated Members, as upon Ministers, may be considerable, and they will have regard to the wellbeing of Members engaged in the Co-operation Agreement.\n\nAppointments\n\n5. Designated Members do not have any formal role in public appointments but will be consulted by Welsh Government Ministers for those appointments that relate to the Co-operation Agreement.\n\n6. Civil Service appointments are made in accordance with the Civil Service Commission’s Recruitment Principles and the Civil Service Code. Public appointments are made in accordance with the requirements of the law and, where appropriate, the Governance Code on Public Appointments under which the Commissioner for Public Appointments carries out his regulatory role. Public appointments follow Welsh Government Public Bodies Unit procedures and reflect and champion the principles of the Welsh Government’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategy for Public Appointments. Members, like Welsh Government Ministers, have a duty to ensure that influence over civil service and public appointments is not abused for partisan purposes.\n\nRelations with the Civil Service\n\n7. Designated Members are expected to be professional in their dealings with the civil service and to treat those with whom they come into contact with courtesy and respect. Civil servants who have concerns about the conduct of Designated Members can raise those concerns with the Permanent Secretary, as they can in relation to Ministers. Similarly, Designated Members can expect the civil servants with whom they come into contact to treat them with the courtesy and respect due to their role. If Designated Members have concerns about the conduct of a civil servant then they should raise those concerns with the Permanent Secretary.\n\n8. Where appropriate under the Co-operation Agreement, it is the responsibility of the civil service to provide Designated Members, alongside Welsh Government Ministers, with impartial, objective and honest advice which includes, to the best of their ability, all relevant information and analysis. Designated Members should pay due consideration to such advice and should not seek to direct civil servants on the advice which they receive, but neither, of course, are they obliged to accept and follow that advice.\n\n9. In order to facilitate the provision of full and frank advice and discussion between Welsh Government Ministers, Designated Members and civil servants, all official papers and documents shared with Designated Members under the Co-operation Agreement, including recommendations and advice, should, unless informed otherwise, be regarded by Designated Members as being supplied in confidence and the contents should not to be shared elsewhere. Similarly, oral advice, policy discussion and debate should be regarded as being conducted in confidence and not for onward transmission. The privacy of opinions expressed and advice given should be maintained. In addition, Designated Members are expected to respect and abide by the GDPR responsibilities of the Welsh Government.\n\n10. Any legal advice of the Counsel General or the Director of Legal Services and their staff should be regarded by Designated Members as carrying legal professional privilege and should not be disclosed or referred to elsewhere, whether orally or in written or electronic format.\n\n11. On leaving their role in the Co-operation Agreement, Designated Members should not retain any official documents in their possession, whether electronic or hard copy.\n\nThe Accounting Officer\n\n12. The Permanent Secretary is the Principal Accounting Officer for the Welsh Government with responsibility for the stewardship of all public funds under its control. They have designated other members of Welsh Government staff as additional accounting officers to be responsible for defined areas of the Welsh Government’s activities.\n\n13. Accounting Officers and their staff are responsible for ensuring that all advice to Ministers and to Designated Members includes appropriate guidance on the proper use of public funds and draws attention to any possible conflict between the intention of Ministers or Designated Members and the duties of an Accounting Officer. An Accounting Officer cannot simply accept the aims or policies without examination. Designated Members should have due regard to the role of the Accounting Officers in the proper conduct of public business.\n\nConstituency or Party Interests\n\n14. Facilities or support provided by the Welsh Government to Designated Members under the terms of the Co-operation Agreement should not be used for constituency activities or party activities outside the Agreement.\n\n15. Where Designated Members are involved in decisions which might have a particular impact upon their own constituencies or electoral regions they must take particular care to avoid any possible conflict of interest or apparent conflict.\n\nDesignated Members’ Private Interests\n\n16. Designated Members must ensure that no conflict arises, or could be perceived to arise, between their activities under the Co-operation Agreement and their private interests. This covers interests which may be financial or otherwise, such as links with organisations which might be funded by the Welsh Government and included in discussions under the Agreement. This also includes the spouse or partner of a Designated Member, as well as close family members.\n\n17. Designated Members should be open in Partnership Discussions to declare any relevant or apparent conflicts. The First Minister and the Leader of Plaid Cymru in consultation are ultimately responsible for deciding how a conflict or apparent conflict which a Designated Member might have is to be treated.\n\n18. Designated Members can seek informal and confidential advice from the Permanent Secretary or Director of Governance and Ethics on identifying conflicts and the measures which might need to be put in place to manage them.\n\nAcceptance of gifts and hospitality\n\n19. Designated Members should not accept any gifts or hospitality which might be perceived as putting them under an obligation in the way in which they discharge their roles under the Co-operation Agreement."
