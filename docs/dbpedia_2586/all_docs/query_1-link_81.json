        "text": "Kashmir is located in the northern most part of India. During the early period, it played vital role in the dissemination of Buddhism to Central Asia, China, Tibet and Ladākh. Ancient literatures mention Kashmir as a part of Gāndhāra. It is certain that Buddhism came to Gāndhāra and Kashmir at the same time. Kashmir is an ancient land mentioned in the Greek classics of Ptolemy, Dionysios, Hakataios and Herodotos. Works of Al-masudi, Al-qazwini, Al-idrisi and Al-beruni also mention about Qashmir. The Greeks refer Kashmir as Kaspapyros, and describe it as one of the cities of Gāndhāra. To-yeng and Sung-yuan (578 CE) call it Shie-mi, while Xuan Zang (631 CE) described it as Kia-shi-mi-lo. The Tibetans refer to Kashmir as Khachul but the valley is known as Kashrat in Darādistān. Kashmir is known as the place as Kashir.\n\nRight from the very beginning, religion has been a major motivating force and thus, human history cannot be understood without taking religion into consideration. Buddhism is one of the world's great religions, and has deeply influenced the character and evolution of Asian civilizations over the past several hundred decades. Soon after the Mahaparinibhana of Buddha, the valley of Kashmir developed into a great seat of Buddhist learning which attracted aspirants from far and wide regions to acquire knowledge. The testimony to this fact is found in the form of different ruined stupas and viharas in valley. Majhantika, who was deputed by Ashoka to Kashmir, is known to have found twelve viharas in existence on his arrival in Kashmir. Kalhana has mentioned that the first Buddhist monastery was erected by the native King Surrendra. Huein Tsang who visited Kashmir in 631.C.E. found about one hundred Sangharamas and five thousand Buddhist priests. He visited many viharas like the Jaskavihara and Jayandra Vihara. In this manuscript the focus has been put on the study of the various Buddhist known and unknown sites of valley of Kashmir.\n\nIn this chapter, I try to navigate between the two approaches of a radical, exclusionary Muslim interpretation of Kashmir history and culture and a radical, exclusionary Pandit (Hindu) approach. The objective of this chapter is to identify and underscore the predominant spiritual tradition of Kashmir. My effort has been to be closer to an un-indoctrinated folk approach, certain aspects of which remain non-mainstream. To illustrate my point, the famous saint poet of the fourteenth century whom lay Kashmiris call Lal-Ded is referred to as Lala-Arifa by Muslim scholars, while Pandit (Hindu) scholars usually call her Lalashwari. Similarly, her younger contemporary saint poet and the founder of the Kashmiri Muslim Rishi order is usually referred to by Muslim scholars as Sheikh Noor-u-din Noorani, Pandit scholars call him Sahzananda, and common Kashmiris call him Nund Rishi. My emphasis is on the tradition that was bequeathed by our ancestors and that was preserved and enriched by Lal-Ded, Nund Rishi, and their followers. I posit that this tradition is still alive in Kashmir. Even today there are people in Kashmir who are Muslim by faith, but don’t eat meat or any other nonvegetarian food on certain occasions as a mark of respect to some Rishi. Kashmir University might have named the chair established in the name of Nund Rishi as Markaz-Noor, and the professors and scholars there may address the saint by various persianized names, but the common Kashmiri who might not be very well educated still calls him Nund Rishi.\n\nKashmir has been the crest of India’s geopolitical problems, quite literally, occupying the geographical head of the country. Majority of the problem is maintained so by producing a selective propagandist hegemony and discourse by vested interests. A crucial step in this direction is to promulgate discourses about Kashmir that in many ways alienate its culture and history from the rest of the nation. Unverified statements and knee-jerk reactions in the media only help to aggravate the situation of a lack of understanding about the region. Any attempt to present a more holistic version of the culture and history of Kashmir that is integrated to the rest of India is frowned upon as not being academic and scholarly, and if such presentation draws from traditional Sanskrit sources, it is alleged that such a presentation can never be considered historical. Through The Making of Early Kashmir, Shonaleeka Kaul, who teaches in the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, deftly presents a new discourse on Kashmir’s culture and history and successfully argues not only that a traditional Sanskrit text can indeed function as a historical text, but that the very fact that such a text is in Sanskrit and is traditional should be testament enough that it is history. This book is the result of twelve years of in-depth study and analysis of a Sanskrit text, Kalhana’s Rajatarangini, which Kaul discovered to be first poetry, and on that account, also history. Kaul argues that Kalhana’s vision behind the text is based on ethics and morality. She also argues that Kalhana did not just create history but he also created a particular region for that history or time. According to Kaul, Kalhana created Kashmir’s identity as a homeland through Rajatarangini. Thus personal identity was fused with regional identity and the region attained a self-identity. Kaul describes through her work how cultural identities take shape. She argues that the shaping of cultural identities is closely connected with the creation of a homeland and the receiving of history.\n\nWith Vāmanadatta we are in tenth century Kashmir, where an extraordinary work of doctrinal systematization has just started within the diverse streams of tantric Śaivism, and also, at least in part, within tantric Viṣṇuism. For some complex reasons these schools choose to bring the tantra teachings into the open, by accepting to confront themselves with the leading social and philosophical-religious establishment. In this framework, we can insert the problematic figure of Vāmanadatta, the only case of a follower of the tantric Vaiṣṇava school of Pañcarātra to be regarded as a master also by the later non-dual Śaiva tradition, including the great Abhinavagupta. The paper is based on my forthcoming edition and English translation of Vāmanadatta's main works: Saṃvitprakāśa and Ātmasaptati, clearly influenced by the contemporary teachings of non-dualistic Śaivism."
