        "text": "Sponsored by IEEE and SSCS, the IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference – CICC – is a premier conference devoted to IC development. The conference program is a blend of oral presentations, exhibits, panels and forums. The conference sessions present original first published technical work and innovative circuit techniques that tackle practical problems. CICC is the conference to find out how to solve design problems, improve circuit design techniques, get exposure to new technology areas, and network with peers, authors and industry experts."
