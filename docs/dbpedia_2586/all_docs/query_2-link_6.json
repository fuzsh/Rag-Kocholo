        "text": "OmarPronunciation\n\nArabic: [ˈʕomar]\n\nGenderMaleOriginWord/nameArabic, Hebrew, GermanicMeaning'flourishing, long-lived' (Arabic) or 'wealthy, famous' (Germanic) or 'eloquent, gifted speaker' (Hebrew)Region of originMiddle EastOther namesRelated namesMohammed, Abdulah, Ali, Ahmad, Khalid, Hamza, Ibrahim, Adam\n\nOmar/Umar/Omer is a masculine given name that has different origins in Arabic, Hebrew and German.\n\nUmar or Omar is a common name (Arabic: عمر) in Arabic-speaking and Muslim populations in general. Omar is represented in Islamic traditions, meaning 'flourishing, long lived'. The name dates back to the emergence and military success of Islam, which were partly due to the second caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (also spelled Omar, r. 634–644).\n\nThere was also a biblical figure by the name of Omer (Hebrew: אוֹמָר) in the Hebrew Bible, meaning 'eloquent' or 'gifted speaker'. Another similar Hebrew name is Omer (Hebrew: עומר), derived from 'sheaf' or 'bundle of grain'.\n\nThe name Ómar also became popular as a man's name in Iceland, and to a much lesser extent in Nordic countries.[1] The name can also be a variant of Ottomar or Othmar, a Germanic name consisting of elements *aud, meaning 'wealthy', and *mari, meaning 'fame'.[citation needed]\n\nThe name Omaar (أومار) is a Somali name, not a variant of Omar/Umar. It comes from the Somali word Oomaar which means 'hot steam from boiling pot'.[citation needed]\n\nGiven name\n\n[edit]\n\nMonarchs named Omar or Umar\n\n[edit]\n\nCaliphs\n\n[edit]\n\nUmar ibn
