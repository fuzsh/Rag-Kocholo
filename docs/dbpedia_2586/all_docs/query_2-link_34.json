Expressing its utmost grief and sorrow, the Conference condemned the genocide acts uncovered by the mass graves perpetrated by the former regime in Iraq against innocent people from Iraq, Iran, and from other countries as in Halabja, anfal and Marshes, and also the killing of Kuwaiti prisoners of war, which constitutes a crime against humanity and a serious violation of the provisions of international humanitarian law.

The Conference reaffirmed the inalienable rights of all States to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In this context, it welcomed the increased cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and encouraged Iran to continue this cooperation. It regretted that the divergent views in this issue could not be consolidated in a consensus resolution at the recent meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. The Conference took note of different interpretation of different paragraphs of the resolution, particularly on operative paragraph 4, and believed that putting the deadline at the end of October would tie the Agencys hand.

The Conference called on States that impose arbitrary political or legal measures, unilateral economic sanctions, or other coercive measures on any member state, to annul those measures as they are in contradiction with the goals, principles and Charter of the United Nations, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and international law.\n\n45. The Conference further reaffirmed its determination to contribute actively to the maintenance and preservation of peace and security at the regional and international levels in favour of all OIC Member States and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, in order to foil the misleading media campaigns and threats waged against Islamic countries, and to show full support for and solidarity with the Islamic countries facing foreign pressure, threats and interference in their internal affairs. The Conference called for the settlement of disputes among states with dialogue and on the basis of international law and respect of the principles of sovereignty and non-interference.\n\n46. The Conference reaffirmed the importance of communication with Muslim communities and minorities in the world, and the need for more efforts to implement the relevant Islamic resolutions. It stressed its categorical rejection of all campaigns of hatred and enmity waged by different media against Islam and Muslims. It recalled that Islam advocates compassion, tolerance and co-existence among all peoples of the world.\n\n47. The Conference appealed to Member States to attach special interest to the issues of Muslim minorities in non-member states, particularly those among them that are still exposed to repression, oppression and ethnic cleansing, and to enhance cooperation and coordination between the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the states concerned, and international and regional organisations in this regard in order for these minorities to regain their fundamental rights and respect for their interests, Islamic culture and identity within respect for the sovereignty, laws and traditions of the countries where they live.\n\n48. The Conference urged the Republic of the Philippines to diligently end its military operations in Southern Philippines and to implement the remaining articles of the peace agreement signed between the Republic of the Philippines and the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996, and the agreed Plan of Comprehensive Development in the Muslim Autonomous Region in Southern Philippines to accomplish the restoration of stability and peace in the region.\n\n49. The Conference urged also the member states that have not yet ratified the statutes of the International Islamic Court of Justice to complete the ratification process so that the Court can start to assume its functions. The Conference called on member states to pursue the existing positive cooperation and coordination in the field of human rights, particularly during international conferences and meetings on the matter.\n\n50. The Conference reiterated its commitment and determination to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including state terrorism, and its commitment to contribute to multilateral efforts to counter this scourge. It expressed its rejection of selectivity and duplicity of standards in combating terrorism and of all attempts to associate terrorism with a particular religion or culture; and voiced its support for an international conference to be held under the aegis of the United Nations to define terrorism. The Conference reaffirmed the need to make efforts to sign a convention on international terrorism to distinguish between terrorism and the legitimate struggle for the right to self-determination of people living under occupation or foreign domination, in consonance with the UN Charter and the international law. The Conference stressed that the cases of alien occupation are governed by the international humanitarian law and not by conventions on terrorism, and called on member states that have not yet ratified the OIC Treaty for Combating International Terrorism to do so. The Conference also commended Malaysias initiative to hold an Extraordinary Session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers on Terrorism on 1-3 April 2002.\n\n51. The Conference expressed its deep concern over the repeated and wrongful association between Islam and human rights violations, and over the use of the written and audiovisual media to propagate such misrepresentations. It called for an end to the unjustified campaigns waged by certain non-governmental organizations against a number of member states to demand the abolition of Sharia laws and sanctions under the pretext of protecting human rights, and affirmed the right of states to hold fast onto their religious, social, and cultural specificities, which constitute their heritage and an enrichment for common universal concepts of human rights.\n\n52. The Conference urged member states again to expeditiously sign and ratify the different agreements concluded under the aegis of the OIC.\n\n53. The Conference underlined the need to devise ways and means to minimize the adverse effects of globalization on the economies of the OIC countries and called for an equitable share in the benefits of globalization for all countries.\n\n54. The Conference expressed concern over extraterritorial application by a number of developed countries of their domestic legislation adversely affecting foreign investment in other countries and recalled in this connection the UN General Assembly resolution 57/5.\n\n55. The Conference called upon the developed countries for further liberalization of trade through increased access to their markets for the products and services of developing countries.\n\n56. The Conference called for speedy accession of all the developing countries to the World Trade Organization (WTO) underlining that no political consideration should impede this process. It rejected all attempts to include non-trade issues, such as labor and environment standards, into the work Programme of WTO, or to link such issues with trade deals.\n\n57. The Conference noted with dismay the lack of progress in the Fifth WTO Ministerial Conference held in Cancun, Mexico in September 2003 and reiterated its appeal to the WTO to strengthen the development dimension in the various multilateral trade agreements through a wide range of measures, including the application of the provisions on special and preferential treatment for developing countries.\n\n58. The Conference stressed the importance of developing an orderly and strengthened international financial system with a view to addressing the fundamental weaknesses of the present system so as to stem possible repercussions of any future financial crises.\n\n59. The Conference called the member states to increase their share of world trade by enhancing their competitiveness at the international level. It further underscored the fundamental importance of expanding intra-OIC trade.\n\n60. The Conference commended the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation (COMCEC) for its key role in strengthening economic and commercial cooperation among member states. It also appreciated the commendable stewardship of H.E. Mr. Ahmed Necdet Sezer, the President of the Republic of Turkey and the Chairman of the COMCEC. It also stressed the urgency of accelerating the implementation of the OIC Plan of Action to Strengthen Economic and Commercial Cooperation among Member States.\n\n61.

The Conference welcomed the entry into force of the Framework Agreement on Trade Preferential System among the OIC member states upon its ratification by the required number of OIC Member States, which paved the way for the launching of trade negotiation among the ratifying countries. In this connection, it appreciated the offer by the Republic of Turkey to host the first round of such negotiation, which is expected to commence in early 2004. The Conference also called upon member states that have not yet done so to sign and/or ratify at an early date the various agreements/statutes finalized under the aegis of the OIC.\n\n63. The Conference renewed its appeal to the international community to fully and expeditiously implement the Programme of Action for 2001-2010 adopted by the Third UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Brussels in May 2001. In this connection, it took note of the outcome of the International Conference on Financing Development on 18-22 March 2002 in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\n64. The Conference expressed concern over the widespread poverty in the LDCs leading to their marginalization in the global economy. It further reaffirmed the common objective of member states of eradicating poverty before the end of the next decade and the need for incorporating Micro Credit Programmes in the strategy for poverty eradication.\n\n65. The Conference renewed its call to the international community to significantly reduce the indebtedness of the African countries and secure fresh flow of substantial funds on easy terms to these countries. It also appealed for assistance to Member States struck by drought and natural disasters and for providing assistance to the Inter-governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS).
