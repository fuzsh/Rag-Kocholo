        "text": "Biography of Prophet Muhammad by Amr Khaled (عمروخالد)\n\nAs a Christian learning more about Islam, I will be posting a lecture given by Amr Khaled on the biography of prophet Muhammad. My hope is to learn more about Islam from a Muslim who is non-Western and Arabic speaking. Amr Khaled fits these criteria; in fact, he is one of the most famous Muslim preachers in the world:\n\nTime Magazine called Amr Khaled the Billy Graham of Islam and one of the top 100 people in the world whose power, talent or moral example is transforming the world (The Time 100).\n\nThe New York Times called Amr Khaled “the world’s most famous and influential Muslim television preacher”.\n\nAmr Khaled’s website – amrkhaled.net – is one of the most popular from Egypt to Morocco to Oman.\n\nAt various points throughout these postings on the biography of prophet Muhammad, I will be comparing Muhammad’s biography and Muhammad’s prophethood with the Christian Scriptures. I invite you to learn with me – whether it be learning more about Muhammad and Islam or learning more about Jesus and Christianity.\n\nThis is the first of 7 videos. In this episode Amr Khaled discusses the following about Prophet Muhammad:\n\nProphet Muhammad’s Physical Appearance\n\nProphet Muhammad’s Miracles and how they were unlike the miracles of other prophets like Moses\n\nI will be comparing:\n\nProphet Muhammad and Jesus’ Appearance\n\nProphet Muhammad’s Miracles and Jesus’ Miracles\n\nAmr Khaled gives greetings to his viewers and he gave greetings from his viewers to Muhammad at Prophet Muhammad’s grave\n\n0:00-1:18\n\nIn the Name of God, praise be to Him and His peace be upon his Messenger. Welcome to a new program on the Biography of the Prophet (PBUH).” Amr Khaled then gives his welcome and greetings…\n\nThe second point that has made me happy is that after yesterday’s program, some youths called me or sent me emails entrusting me with sending their greetings to Prophet Muhammad. Actually, the last thing I do before coming here is go to the Prophet’s grave to greet him so I may realize that I am bearing a great responsibility. Thenk I would keep looking at the house of Muhammad; I did something that should appeal to all our viewers i.e., I addressed the Prophet saying all our viewers are greeting him! While saying so, I felt the Prophet would receive all our greetings and he (PBUH) would answer our greetings too. So, I sent all your greetings to the Prophet!\n\nAmr Khaled explains the purpose of the show: to discuss Prophet Muhammad’s boyhood and adulthood till marriage\n\n1:19-1:37\n\nIn today’s program, there will be an introduction, then a question, then handling the Prophet’s boyhood, then his adulthood till marriage. Tomorrow we will handle the beginning of the Prophet’s Message, but today we will focus on the aforementioned points.\n\nAmr Khaled discusses Prophet Muhammad’s appearance\n\n1:38-3:03\n\nHair from Prophet Muhammad’s Beard\n\nFirst, let’s start with a spiritual introduction so it may help us remember Muhammad (PBUH). Today’s introduction will be about the Prophet’s physical appearance; can you describe his appearance? Surely, we all wish we could have seen Prophet Muhammad, and known his physical appearance. In fact, many books described the Prophet’s physical appearance saying Prophet Muhammad was of medium height; if he stood among tall people, he would not appear to be short and if among short people, he would not look so tall.\n\nThe Prophet was pink-colored and whitish; he had a straight body and was not potbellied. His hair and beard were black; that was the Prophet’s physical appearance. I know this description will not help you visualize his physical appearance; surely you wish to visualize him! In fact, God has guided me to read 3 stories in the Prophetic Biography that help you visualize his appearance, so it is a present to our viewers! Listen to these 3 stories to visualize his appearance: I will not describe his eyebrows or his hair color or his facial features or his height or his body size, but I will related 3 stories that will help visualize Muhammad’s face! So, whenever you want to see the Prophet, recall these three stories.\n\nAmr Khaled related three stories about Prophet Muhammad’s appearance\n\nFirst story of prophet Muhammad’s appearance related by Abdulla ibn Salam\n\n3:04-4:00\n\nThe first story was of a man called Abdulla ibn Salam who was a Jew living in Medina. Abdullah ibn Salam was told that the Arab Prophet would come to Medina; so he prepared 10 questions to ask Prophet Muhammad. Ibn Salam was a Jewish scribe and he knew the description of the last Prophet. So, he prepared 10 questions to ask Muhammad so he would know if he was a Prophet or not via the answers!\n\nHe took his son and went to meet Muhammad; when he looked at Muhammad’s face, he knew he was God’s Messenger. He did not ask his questions to the Prophet, but he knew he was a Prophet from his face.\n\nHis son wondered why he did not ask the questions. Ibn Salam said because that face was not that of a liar! He realized Muhammad (PBUH) was a Prophet through his face.”\n\n“I hope you will be able to visualize the Prophet’s face!”\n\nSecond story of prophet Muhammad’s appearance related by Jabir ibn Abdullah\n\n4:01-4:47\n\n“The second story was with Jabir ibn Abduallah. Jabir narrated that he was walking in Medina on a moonlit night and he was looking at the Moon that fascinated him. He added while he was looking at the Moon, Prophet Muhammad came from the direction where Jabir was looking at the Moon! Then Jabir ibn Abdullah kept looking up and down. He said, “I compared him to the Moon…” Seems there was a point of similarity between them! Then Jabir said, “…I…found that, for me, he was better than the Moon.””\n\n“So, Muhammad (PBUH) looked much better than the Moon; his face must have had extraordinary light!”\n\nThird story of prophet Muhammad’s appearance related by Abdullah ibn Rawaha\n\n4:48-6:51\n\n“Listen to the third story that will help visualize all the Prophet’s features. Abdullah ibn Rawaha was an eloquent Arab poet; a man who had not seen the Prophet asked Abdullah to describe him! By the way, ibn Rawaha died before Prophet Muhammad!”\n\n“He was asked to describe the Prophet; he gave an interesting answer. He said some words that would help you visualize the Prophet; he said, “Had you seen him, you would have felt the Sun was shining!””\n\n“Of course, you know how the sky looks at sunrise; that was what ibn Rawaha implied! Surely, some of you must have witnessed sunrise; it arouses wonderful feelings inside you! Prophet Muhammad’s coming from afar was like sunrise; I hope you will have visualized his face by now!”\n\n“God’s peace be upon Muhammad. Now you love him, right?”\n\n“The Prophet (PBUH) must have walked in the place where we are sitting now and his house was near the minaret you are seeing now on the scrreen. Hopefully, this introduction will help you visualize his face!”\n\n“Imagine the Prophet might embrace you on Doomsday or hold your hand to show you your palace in Paradise or your palace might be next to his! You might be able to see the Prophet through the windows of your palace.”\n\n“Ibn Rawaha’s saying the Prophet’s coming from afar was like sunrise has to do with an amazing story! Known when the Prophet was born? He was born on Rabi’l, 12! [Monday, 12th Rabi’ al-Awwal, Year, AD 570 {see also the Timeline of Prophet Muhammad’s life]. Know the hour of his birth? Many do not know the answer; it is said he was born at the sunrise of Rabi l, 12! His face was shining like the rising sun; he was born at sunrise! God willed the Prophet to be born at sunrise in particular; this implies he was a light that would flood the Earth! Just like the Sun rises everyday, Muhammad’s birth is like sunlight flooding the Earth till Doomsday. God’s peace be upon Muhammad!”\n\nProphet Muhammad’s Miracles\n\nThe prophet Muhammad and miracles. Amr Khaled says the prophet Muhammad’s miracles did not change the course of events like the miracles of Moses.\n\n6:52-9:51\n\nAfter this introduction, let’s see the question posed by some youths; I asked the youths to meet me on the Internet so we would exchange views on the last program. They sent many questions; a question was repeated most: I said the miracle of Abraha’s army destruction was the last tangible miracle and after Muhammad’s birth, miracles stopped and the age of science started, but what about his Night Journey and Ascension to Heaven & the Moon Split. Those who asked that question and I are both right!” “True there were miracles at Muhammad’s time, but such miracles did not change the course of events; got this point? Such miracles did not lead to a decisive victory; they were not like Moses’ Cane that split the sea so the believers could cross it or like the Flights of Birds that destroyed the army of Abraha!” “The Prophet’s miracles were not like that; they were not like Noah’s Ark!” “What was the aim of Muhammad’s miracles? They aimed at supporting the believers; the Night Journey relieved the Prophet after being harmed by At-Ta’if people and the Moon Split proved his Prophethood, but they did not change the course of events or results as they had to be changed due to the efforts of Muslims, and that is the real miracle!” “The Prophet’s miracles aimed at strengthening Faith and not at changing the results of battles! The angels descended to the battlefield in Badr Battle, but it was not they who achieved the decisive victory then, for it wa Muslims who achieved that victory!” “Never think I am denying Prophet Muhammad’s miracles, but I am saying this so we can imitate the Prophet’s success experience so none would say he succeeded as he was backed by the Revelation and we will not rise as there is no more Revelation!” “Why handle Prophet Muhammad’s life story if we cannot benefit from it?! Had Muhammad’s success story been miraculous, it would have been useless to relate it. As Muhammad is the Last Prophet, his miracle is his followers themselves!” “Moses’ and Jesus’ miracles did not continue after their deaths, but the miracle of the last Prophet had to be an everlasting one; so his miracle is the Muslim men and women who follow in his footsteps.” “Thus, the Prophet’s miracles did not aim at changing the course of events, rather he had to plan to achieve success. The Revelation acted only as guidance; the Qur’an was revealed to guide us to stick to God’s Path! I had to answer that crucial question! None should say we cannot imitate him as he was backed by the Revelation; the Revelation was but a guidance to him and it will remain as a guidance to Muslims! The Prophet had to set plans, exert great efforts and many sacrifices were made and so he could attain victory!\n\nProphet Muhammad and Jesus’ Appearance\n\nThe date of Jesus’ birth is celebrated December 25 or January 7, but the actual date is not known. Jesus’ birth was in conjunction with an astronomical phenomenon which led others to worship Him (Matthew 2:1-2). The Scriptures don’t describe Jesus’ earthly appearance, but it seems to have been insignificant (Isaiah 52:14; Isaiah 53:2). However, the Scriptures emphasize Jesus’ divine glory hundreds of years before the Incarnation (John 12:41 with Isaiah 6:3-5; Psalm 45:1-2) and His appearance after His resurrection and glorification (Revelation 1:14-18; 2:18; 19:12; cf. Acts 22:6-11; 26:12-15 [Paul’s conversion]; Matthew 17:2 [Jesus’ transfiguration]).\n\nThis highlights a major difference between Jesus and Muhammad’s physical appearance:\n\nWhat does Muhammad’s physical appearance look like today?\n\nProphet Muhammad, Miracles and Jesus’ Miracles\n\nOne of Jesus’ great and lasting miracles is His empty tomb. Jesus has risen from the dead; ascended into heaven; and is everlasting King (Isaiah 9:6-7). One of the lasting signs of Jesus’ kingship was the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in AD 70.\n\nNext Amr Khaled Post about Prophet Muhammad’s biography\n\nBiography of Prophet Muhammad Part 2\n\nLearn about Muhammad and why Christians do not believe he was a true prophet of God:\n\nMuhammad’s Proposed Cursing – Mubahala (Quran 3:59-61)\n\nIs Muhammad’s revelation about marrying Zaynab an argument against his being a true prophet?\n\nHow do you reconcile Muhammad’s Death with Quran 69:44-46?\n\nThe claim that the angel Gabriel spoke to Muhammad is a historic claim. But does the historic evidence justify Muhammad’s claim? Is there historic evidence against it? This video looks at two Islamic hadiths and how they relate to Muhammad’s claim that his message came from the angel Gabriel.\n\nReferences for Islam’s Prophet Muhammad’s biography (sirah)\n\nKaren Armstrong, Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet (1991).\n\n_____________, and Muhammad: A Prophet for Our Time (2006).\n\nBint al-Shati [ʿĀʿishah ʿAbd al-Raḥmān].
