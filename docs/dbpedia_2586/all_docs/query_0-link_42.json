Far from Home (ft. Joe Miller)\n7. Dorm 309\n8. Dream Bounce\n9. Lali Cartel (ft. Frouzan)\n\nWith a distinct blend of influences, Haider&#39;s evolutionary sound journey spans melancholic dub-infused soundscapes and captivating grooves. \r\n\r\nThe long play &#39;Graduated&#39; was written during Haider&#39;s time in his Michigan dorm and Lahore home studio during a period when he was enrolled as a student before and after COVID-19.\r\n\r\nIt showcases his evolution as a music producer, with each track delivering a unique and autobiographical listening experience.\r\n\r\n&quot;Being pushed by my younger brother, mentors, friends and family to share my art with larger audiences, this self-release album has allowed me to curate my past sonic vision confidently, in the most authentic sense.\r\n\r\nThe mood floats around various shades of deep / house music. It showcases a journey of self exploration through a variety of sounds I resonate with. \r\n\r\nIn essence, this was a necessary step for me to move forward today, parting ways with music that I felt deserved to be available to the public since its creation.",
