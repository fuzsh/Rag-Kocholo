Armed with the six spices in this collection, you can cover lots of Indian culinary ground, whether on their own, or combined to make spice blends.\n\nPhoto credit for author photo: Alex Lau\n\nThe 6-spice collection includes: :\n\nOur Kashmiri Chili Powder is an heirloom variety grown in Kashmir. The chilis are prized for their flavor and vibrant red color, which imparts a beautiful hue to rubs and stews. The rich color and bright, sweet flavor make this chili powder a perfect everyday alternative to cayenne or hot paprika. Ours is hotter than others you may have tried!\n\nOrigin:\n\nPampore, Kashmir\n\nHeat index: Hot\n\nSalt Free\n\nIngredients:\n\nKashmiri chili powder (Capsicum annuum v. Kashmiri)\n\n=\n\nUse in a rub for grilled lamb or other meat kebabs\n\nAdd to soups and stews for medium heat and rich color\n\nUse anywhere you'd use cayenne pepper, chili powder or hot paprika\n\nRefreshingly bright, sweet-tart zest with a tropical edge.\n\nOrigin:\n\nDevgad, India\n\nIngredients:\n\nAlphonso mango, unripe (Mangifera indica v. Alphonso), salt (<0.1%)\n\nRub chicken, shrimp and veggies to add a tart brightness\n\nSprinkle into smoothies, pastries with fruit and desserts\n\nBlack Mineral Salt (commonly called kala namak) is a classic ingredient in many South Asian dishes and is used in the practice of Ayurveda. The salt is mined in the Himalayas and fired in a kiln at extremely high temperatures, hot enough to melt the salt and give it a scorched black color. The heat changes the chemical composition, bringing out its beloved savory, tart and eggy aroma and flavor.\n\nOrigin:\n\nUttar Pradesh, India\n\nIngredients:\n\nKiln-fired salt\n\nUse to make a vegan tofu scramble\n\nAdd to beans, stews and chilies\n\nUse in place of salt in noodle, rice and lentil dishes\n\nOur Wild Mountain Cumin has a savory, penetrating aroma and bright, umami flavor evocative of grilled meats and sweet caramelized onions. The tiny, oblong seeds are hand-picked by foragers in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan. The seeds are smaller and softer than the cumin you may be used to, and they do not need to be ground before use.\n\nOrigin:\n\nBadakhshan, Afghanistan\n\nSalt Free\n\nIngredients:\n\nWhole wild cumin (Bunium persicum)\n\nBloom seeds in hot oil or ghee and use as the base for stews, curries or braises\n\nGrind seeds and mix with other spices like coriander and black pepper for a savory protein rub\n\nMix whole seeds into guacamole, vinaigrettes or yogurt-based spreads\n\nOur Cloud Forest Cardamom is sweet and tart, reminiscent of summer fruits, fresh herbs and cut grass. It comes straight from a single-estate regenerative farm in the high-altitude cloud forests of Guatemala. The fruit turns yellow as it ripens on the vine and has a softer and sweeter flavor that makes it a perfect upgrade to standard green cardamom.\n\nOrigin:\n\nAlta Verapaz, Guatemala\n\nSalt Free\n\nIngredients:\n\nGround cardamom pods (Elettaria cardamomum)\n\nCook down with fruit juice for a savory/sweet sauce or jam\n\nAdd to your meat or veggie rub, especially for chicken or lamb\n\nUse in cakes, muffins, pastries and other desserts\n\nSprinkle over oatmeal or into smoothies\n\nOur uncommonly delicate Herati Saffron threads have a beautiful delicate floral flavor, golden color and warm, honeyed fragrance reminiscent of dried roses and fresh hay. The threads are pulled carefully from the flower, leaving a characteristic flame-colored tail. Saffron is a key element in sweet and savory cuisines from the Mediterranean to South Asia.\n\nOrigin:\n\nHerat, Afghanistan\n\nSalt Free\n\nIngredients:\n\nWhole saffron threads (Crocus sativa)\n\nSteep a few threads in warm water when making crunchy baked rice\n\nAdd a pinch of threads when making paella\n\nFold into buttery bread, cake or cookie doughs\n\nSteep in cream for a rich pasta sauce\n\nABOUT KHUSHBU SHAH\n\nKhushbu Shah is a food writer and journalist who resides in Los Angeles, California. She was most recently the restaurant editor at Food & Wine magazine, where she crisscrossed the United States several times over on the hunt for the country’s best new chefs. She is the youngest person and the first person of color to ever hold that title.\n\nYou can also find her work in The New York Times, The Washington Post, GQ, Eater, and more.
