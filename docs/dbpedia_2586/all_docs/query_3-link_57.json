        "text": "Update 4: Introducing Budy - My Next Venture Continuing with the updates I've been sharing, I am beyond thrilled to unveil the name of my next company as promised: Budy! Over the past few months, my exploration into the world of AI, especially Generative AI, has been enlightening. I've especially focused on distinguishing hype from reality, and understanding what's currently achievable versus future aspirations. While my excitement—because of the immense potential of Gen-AI to revolutionize industries—is high, the challenge of creating genuine value remains as significant as ever. My curiosity was particularly piqued by the complexity enterprises face when deploying software solutions, from ERPs or WMS to Salesforce or HubSpot. Despite the core brilliance in some of these products/platforms, these solutions are always daunting to implement for organizations with pre-existing processes or systems and hence companies rarely realize their full expected outcomes. I wholeheartedly believe that SaaS has revolutionized productivity and brought immense benefits to society. Yet, despite these advancements, the current highly manual state of the $300+ billion software deployment and implementation industry is lagging. It's time for a change, as this outdated approach restricts the full potential of SaaS from being realized. Clearly, we're looking at a massive industry! Those who have collaborated with me on new ventures or ideas are familiar with my approach: Dream big but aim small: i.e., start with focused, achievable goals. The key initial step is to develop and refine a solution that genuinely adds value to a user —a value that becomes tangible when customers are willing to pay for it. Enter Budy: An AI co-pilot designed to simplify the Deployment and Management of Sales & Marketing software stacks, such as Salesforce, Marketo, etc. While I have more questions than answers at this stage, the roadmap for the next six months is quite clear: 1. Build & Launch Budy's MVP to 10-15 initial customers focused around one software application. 2. Iterate based on real customer feedback, i.e., further train Budy's capabilities. 3. Release Budy Beta to a wider customer base. 4. Either start scaling to the first $1 million in ARR or go back to the drawing board 🙂. Lastly, to everyone reading, thank you for your support and involvement in my journey so far, and I am sure it will play a pivotal role in Budy's success as it grows and learns more about how software deployment, or rather the world, works. here’s how you can help: 1. Product/Industry Feedback: If you're in the SaaS deployment business or have ideas on improving the process, I’d love to hear from you. 2. Angel Round Participation: If you are interested in participating. 3. Join the Team: I am assembling Budy's founding team. If you're a seasoned full-stack or ML engineer or know someone who is then please connect. #Budy #GenerativeAI #Innovation #Entrepreneurship #Startups #Bitspilani #SaaS\n\nUpdate 3: Embarking on a New Venture with Sutter Hill Ventures I'm thrilled to announce my next entrepreneurial journey, in partnership with Sutter Hill Ventures (SHV), one of the Bay Area's oldest and most reputable venture capital firms. SHV's unique model of collaborating closely with founders to build market-defining companies, such as Snowflake, Pure Storage, and Laceworks, resonates deeply with me. Personally, I love the people and the builder culture at Sutter Hill Ventures. The plan for the next six months is fairly simple: 1. Discover a Captivating Problem: Find a significant business problem worth solving using Generative AI. 2. Deep Dive through Dialogue: Engage in in-depth conversations with experts both within and outside the domain, enriching my understanding and broadening my perspective. 3. Reflect: Do I still love the space? If not, return to step 1. 4. Launch: Post another update on LinkedIn with the new company name 🙂. While my search is broad, my initial inclination leans towards solutions for enterprises, leveraging generative AI as a key differentiator. Join me on this exciting new chapter, and wish me the best! If you have insights, advice, or want to contribute to this journey in any way, please feel free to reach out. #NewVenture #Entrepreneurship #SutterHillVentures #Innovation #GenerativeAI #StartupJourney #startups #bitspilani\n\n𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝟐: Last week, I concluded my break (sabbatical)! After spending an amazing 6 months learning, growing and enjoying it, I want to dedicate this post to pause and share the enriching experiences and insights from my journey. I had started my sabbatical around four key themes: Health, Learning, Bucket List, and Giving Back. As I began ‘executing’ the plan, I learned how intertwined these themes really were. Let me get the exciting bucket list things out of the way: ✔ 𝚂̶𝚞̶𝚙̶𝚎̶𝚛̶ ̶𝚕̶𝚘̶𝚗̶𝚐̶ ̶𝚝̶𝚛̶𝚊̶𝚒̶𝚗̶ ̶𝚛̶𝚒̶𝚍̶𝚎̶: Seattle to New York over 3 days with mom 🙂 ✔ 𝙻̶𝚘̶𝚗̶𝚐̶ ̶𝚛̶𝚘̶𝚊̶𝚍̶ ̶𝚝̶𝚛̶𝚒̶𝚙̶: Drove from Chicago to San Francisco over 2 weeks & through 6 national parks with the full family 🙂 ✘ Do Doordash for 12+ hrs: Did it for about 4-5 hours, orders were too few, got bored and dropped! ✔ 𝙼̶𝚘̶𝚟̶𝚎̶ ̶𝚌̶𝚒̶𝚝̶𝚒̶𝚎̶𝚜̶ ̶𝚠̶𝚒̶𝚝̶𝚑̶𝚘̶𝚞̶𝚝̶ ̶𝚞̶𝚜̶𝚒̶𝚗̶𝚐̶ ̶𝚖̶𝚘̶𝚟̶𝚎̶𝚛̶𝚜̶: Drove a fully loaded 26 foot long truck over 3400miles/~5500km in 4.5 days! ✔ 𝚆̶𝚊̶𝚝̶𝚌̶𝚑̶ ̶𝟸̶𝟼̶𝟽̶ ̶𝚎̶𝚙̶𝚒̶𝚜̶𝚘̶𝚍̶𝚎̶𝚜̶ ̶𝚘̶𝚏̶ ̶𝙼̶𝚊̶𝚑̶𝚊̶𝚋̶𝚑̶𝚊̶𝚛̶𝚊̶𝚝̶: Watched it! Some amazing lessons learned! ✘ Complete a vertical marathon ( Climb 86 floors @ Empire State Building ) : Learned that this happens only once a year in Oct through lottery. Did not win the lottery so marked it for next October 🙂 ✔ 𝚆̶𝚘̶𝚛̶𝚔̶𝚒̶𝚗̶𝚐̶ ̶𝚊̶𝚜̶ ̶𝚏̶𝚛̶𝚘̶𝚗̶𝚝̶–̶𝚕̶𝚒̶𝚗̶𝚎̶ ̶𝚜̶𝚝̶𝚊̶𝚏̶𝚏̶ ̶𝚊̶𝚝̶ ̶𝙼̶𝚌̶𝙳̶: Worked/working as a cashier & barista at Starbucks in Palo Alto since Oct! ✔ 𝟷̶𝟶̶ ̶𝙳̶𝚊̶𝚢̶ ̶𝚅̶𝚒̶𝚙̶𝚊̶𝚜̶𝚜̶𝚊̶𝚗̶𝚊̶: Completed in May, Loved it, changed my life! 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡: I had a moment mid way through where I actually apologized to my body for taking it for granted! Lost a lot of weight! Improved almost all my vital signs, and learned so much about food and how the body works! 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: While I learned from & reflected on all my experiences, bucket lists, finance courses on coursera, I think my biggest learning was about our bodies, about what is happiness ? why not having both attachments as well as aversons towards anything is so important! While I understood a little bit about not getting attached to things before, the part about not having aversions towards anything was a big rabbit hole and learning for me. 𝐆𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤: While I think I will never really be satisfied by this one, I really appreciate the 100+ purposeless coffee meetings, zoom calls. Frankly I was not expecting this kind of response but I am so grateful for everyone to spare the time and apologize to the ones I missed. Maybe we can now catch up in person or Zoom in on a Saturday :). I am hoping I was able to add some value and help in a little way in your life journey! Last but not the least, I relocated to the 𝐁𝐚𝐲 𝐀𝐫𝐞𝐚. So please ping in case you are in town or visiting. What next ? In the next post 🙂 #sabbatical #health #learning #giveback #bucketlist #meditation #happiness #lifejourney\n\nUpdate: Last week, I stepped aside as the CEO of GreyOrange. After founding and leading GreyOrange for 12 years and running Team AcYut for 4 years before that, I have decided to take a break! A lot of you have asked me what I intend to do next, so I thought I would post it here to both share and take suggestions on how I can improve the list. I envision this sabbatical around 4 themes : Health, Learning, Bucket list, and Giving back Health: Although I started focusing on health a couple of years ago, the main theme is to take time to recharge my physical, mental and spiritual self. Learning: For people that know me, this is a big one and the focus here is to meet and learn from outside supply chain and robotics. I have a couple of Finance courses lined up on coursera; need suggestions on AI. I would love to also help people think through problems/ideas, Product development and GTM so I can learn. I also plan on watching the entire Mahabharata Series ( 290 episodes) since I am tired of being quoted the Mahabharata and now I need to know :). Bucket list: I have 4-5 crazy things to knock off my bucket list - taking a super long train journey, working as front-line staff at McD ( will replace this with Doordash or Lyft ), 10 Day Vipassana etc. Giving Back: In addition to the above personal pursuits, I would like to give back to the community while learning and exploring new things before embarking on my next adventure. Over the last 5-6 years, as GreyOrange became bigger and bigger, life got busier and busier. I significantly decreased my speaking engagements at events and colleges to share our learnings and I want to give time to this. I recently taught a short course on product management and thoroughly enjoyed it, and intend to teach more courses. I will also increase the amount of time I have been spending on advising startups. I get so much energy doing this, so I plan to do more of this before life gets busy again :). Please let me know if you have any other suggestions for ways to give back. I am convinced that GreyOrange would not have gotten this far without the countless people who assisted and taught me along the way, and I intend to contribute further in similar ways. Lastly, I want to spend time with family and friends, as it is something that took a bit of a backseat over the last few years, given the demands of the job. I look forward to doing 'purpose-less coffee' catch ups. Current plan is to be in the following cities over the next couple of months, so do DM or comment if you are in town and would love to meet : SF, Seattle, Boston, Delhi, Bangalore and of course NY (home). #sabbatical #health #learning #giveback #bucketlist #startup #bitspilani"
