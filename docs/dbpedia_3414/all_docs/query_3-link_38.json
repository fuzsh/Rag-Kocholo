County that may not be within the L.A. city limits but are part of the overall L.A. sprawl, including Laurel Canyon, Topanga Canyon, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Venice, Long Beach, San Pedro, Huntington Beach, Redondo Beach, Culver City, Compton, Watts, Bel Air, Mulholland Drive, Pasadena, the San Fernando Valley, Calabasas, LAX, etc. It also includes songs that mention a business or professional sports team associated with the city.\n\nThis list does not include Beverly Hills, Hollywood, or Malibu, because they each have their own separate lists.\n\n(Also check out Wikipedia's list of songs about L.A.)\n\nShortcuts to the Band Name or Artist Last Name\n\n(Numbers are on top. Ignore any article at the beginning such as \"The\" or \"A\" except for non-English languages.)\n\n(Artists name + band name combos are filed under the artist's last name.)"
