MARY MARIA VOCAL ANNOUNCEMENT/ CURTAIN CALL\n\nBlue Velvet is David Lynchs unforgettable 1986 masterwork, starring Kyle MacLachlan as a curious college student, Isabella Rosselini as a tormented lounge singer, and Dennis Hopper as an emotional gas-sniffing psychopath. Blue Velvet was Lynchs first collaboration with his longtime composer and musical partner, Angelo Badalamenti, who channels Lynchs unique vision with a dark, moody, yet melodic score, at turns agitated and violent, soaring with sublime beauty, and hanging cool with 50s-style jazz. The long available single LP has been expanded by 60 minutes to a 2 LP Deluxe Edition with the addition of the famous 1963 recording of Blue Velvet, performed by Bobby Vinton as well as previously unreleased film cues, alternates and outtakes entitled Lumberton Firewood. Although Blue Velvet was scored more traditionally than later Lynch projects, the director and composer intended many tracks to be merely firewood, their term for raw orchestral sonorities to be edited and manipulated into sound design by the director. The Deluxe Edition packaging features liner notes by Tim Greiving, incorporating new interviews with David Lynch, Angelo Badalamenti, Kyle MacLachlan, and producer Fred Caruso. The cover features the original 1986 Italian movie poster art designed by Enzio Sciotti. Pressed on Marbleized Blue vinyl.\n\nSide A\n\n1.

With the group on hiatus in the late 80s, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis suggested the three branch out on their own, and Bell Biv DeVoe was formed. The groups approach turned the tables  with R&B pulling from hip-hop rather than the other way around. In fact, Public Enemy producer Eric Sadler, along with Hank and Keith Shocklee, made significant contributions, helping Bell Biv Devoe craft their debut album, Poison. The album and its title track both hit number 1 on Billboard's R&B/Hip Hop chart, entered the top 5 on both the single and top 200 charts and went on to be certified Platinum 4 times over.\n\nBBDs landmark debut is presented for Record Store Day in a never-to-be-repeated Cherry Red pressing.\n\nA Side\n\n1.

Drummer for Cliff Richard & The Shadows, Bennett also is the composer of some of the most collectible production music albums ever made, and for over 40 years has been a sought-after composer for TV and film. But of all his projects, his 1978 release \"Voyage (A Journey into Discoid Funk)\" is probably his most beloved, a truly pioneering \"space disco\" recording inspired by Brian Eno but wielding a groove all its own. Despite its absolutely eye-popping Discogs stats, our release marks its first vinyl reissue outside of Australia, and its first-ever release on colored vinyl (blue with black swirl), complete with original gatefold jacket art.\n\nSIDE ONE\n\n1.

Ocean Glide\n\nA special double LP Record Store Day 2022 exclusive, featuring two albums by the late Jay Bennett (Wilco) alongside the 2021 feature-length documentary \"Where are you, Jay Bennett?,\" packaged in a gatefold jacket.\n\n\"Where are you, Jay Bennett?\" is a feature-length documentary on Jay Bennett, a legendary musician who, as a member of Wilco, was a large part of the genius behind their three seminal albums (Being There, Summerteeth, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot -- he co-wrote most of Summerteeth and YHF with Jeff Tweedy) as well as the Mermaid Avenue/Woody Guthrie sessions with Billy Bragg, and who went on to a critically acclaimed solo career, before dying tragically at the age of 45\n\n\"Whatever Happened I Apologize\" is best described by Brian Robbins of JamBands.com: \"a departure from much of his past work. Simply put, the master of what-this-track-needs-is-one-more-weird-noise-and-it'll-be-perfect (and staunch defender of vinyl) has offered up a digital-only acoustic album much of it just the man, his guitar, and some pretty open emotions.\n\n\"Kicking at the Perfumed Air\" is a beautiful collection of personal songs that Jay Bennett was working on when he died. Released posthumously, the album was praised for its subtle beauty. Pitchfork said: \"But Perfumed works simply because Bennett was such a keen craftsman, his mournfulness so elegantly expressed, and as such, nevertheless serves as a fitting elegy for an under-appreciated and occasionally misunderstood songsmith and musician taken too soon.\"\n\nWhatever Happened I Apologize:\n\n1 Another Town Another Ride Another Window 3:05\n\n2 I Don't Have The Time 1:51\n\n3 I'll Decorate My Love 3:42\n\n4 The Engines Are Idle 4:51\n\n5 How Dull They Make The Razor 3:01\n\n6 Without The Benefit Of Sight 4:39\n\n7 Hank 2:23\n\n8 Talk And Talk And Talk 4:55\n\n9 Wicket World 3:51\n\n10 Little Blue Pills\n\nKicking at the Perfumed Air\n\n1 Diamond Smiles\n\n2 Second-Last Call\n\n3 Twice A Year\n\n4 Mirror Ball\n\n5 Footprints\n\n6 Hotel Song\n\n7 Invitation\n\n8 When Heaven Hel The World\n\n9 M Plates\n\n10 Cartoon Physics\n\n11 Beer\n\nFeaturing one of Blondies most famous, endearing and successful singles, Sunday Girl, originally released in 1979, was the follow-up to the bands #1 hit, Heart of Glass, and was #1 in the U.K. and Top 10 around Europe. Taken from the bands multimillion-selling album, Parallel Lines, the success of these two singles pushed the album to #1 (several months after its initial release) and helped Blondie become the first New Wave act to reach platinum status. Double 7 single set housed in a stunning, bespoke gatefold sleeve featuring rare photos from the period. Disc One features the original Single Version, plus the French Version, pressed on red vinyl. Disc Two features 2 previously unreleased tracks  a demo from 1978 and a live version recorded at the Paramount Theatre in Portland in January 1979  pressed on yellow vinyl.\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.

Originally only available as a 2-CD set including a Radio 1 John Peel session, only a handful of copies made their way over to the UK on import. Bustin + Dronin has never been available on vinyl before now, and this release features the nine remixes (note: no Peel Session) by William Orbit (tracks 1, 6, 7 & 9), Adrian Sherwood (2 & 8), Moby (4), Thurston Moore (5) and John McEntire (7). Released on two x heavyweight coloured vinyl LPs - 1 x transparent blue, 1 x transparent green, the sleeve comes with an adapted version of the original Japanese OBI strip and replica insert.\n\nDave Brubeck Trio - Live from Vienna 1967 is an extremely rare, red-hot performance by Dave and his famous rhythm section -- Joe Morello, on drums, and Gene Wright on bass. Alto saxophonist, Paul Desmond, missed the plane to Vienna and the remaining trio took the stage with a mission; show the packed hall that the three of them could play up a storm despite being one man down. Each musician in the trio was at the top of their game and each player was forced to stretch out their solos which landed them in new creative territories. The communication of musical concepts between Dave and Joe is extraordinary as they improvise boldly and respond to each other's fresh ideas. Gene Wright solos far more than usual on this album and his playing is a fitting tribute to the longest living member of the Quartet. (Gene died on December 30th, 2020.) Dave Brubeck plays masterfully revealing a rhythmic complexity to his approach on the piano that is remarkable and reminds the listener of his extremely inventive approach to jazz improvisations. Harmonically, he also explores polytonality in the most unexpected places; for example, on the ballad \"La Paloma Azul.\" On \"Swanee River\" Dave is playfully polyrhythmic. Dave's light touch on \"One Moment Worth Years\" is charming and gives a nod to the great more traditional pianists who went before him. On this great-sounding recording, you can hear the full breadth of Dave's playing which pushes jazz forward while honoring his past influences. Opening with \"St. Louis Blues,\" the set includes the rhythmically challenging, high-spirited \"Someday My Prince Will Come,\" and ends with \"Take the A Train\" as an encore. This is a thrilling set! The sound is wonderful and listening to this album will make you feel as if you were sitting in the audience that historic night.\n\nSide A\n\n1. St. Louis Blues\n\n2.
