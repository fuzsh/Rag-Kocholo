        "text": "Although this may be old news to you 50 Cent is an asshole. But he is entitled to feel that some of his buddies current and present are not going to stick to his work ethic. Nor have his passion for expansion and dominating the world outside the rap game. On DJ Whoo Kid’s (he didn’t forget him at least smh) show a month back 50 Cent shut down the possibility of a G-Unit biopic and said that he would like to forget the group part of his career which is blasphemous in a sense. You can’t forget Lloyd Banks, Young Buck and Tony Yayo despite your issues with those 3. How could you forget Beg For Mercy isn’t that shit like quadruple platinum? You can’t forget the 50 Cent and Game chemistry on songs. You can’t forget the G-Unit expansion squad of Mobb Deep, M.O.P., Ma$e, Freeway, Lil Scrappy, Olivia, Spider Loc (who is forgettable I’d honestly forget this guy). But from a period of 2003-2008. G-Unit had the game on lock shutting down NY or East Coast based competition with their hits, beefs, and the reputation on the streets as well as many people careers ended, lives were lost, or murders were attempted on the members.\n\nI remember the G-Unit Radio shit like it was yesterday. Picture you being 15-16 years old listening to Sirius Satellite Radio on Saturday morning or the replay on Sunday afternoon and you hear those multiple gunshots from Whoo Kid, the jokes about the current news, and that new mixtape material coming from the G-Unit camp one can reminisce in these shoes right so. Last Sunday, I decided to download almost all the 25 G-Unit Radio tapes and in this article I’m going to rank them. I did own about half of those tapes anyway but owning them and listening to them throughout the week bought back memories and I decided to rank all 25 G-Unit radio tapes so let’s take a trip down memory lane.\n\n25. G-Unit Radio Pt. 23: Tony Yayo- Finally Off Papers (2007)\n\nThis was pretty much the last Yayo project I remembered because after this this cat ain’t really drop many memorable tapes. I rank this here because this is by far the weakest out the series. Although there were decent moments on this tape. The Young Buck features on here on: “Bang Bang”, “Smokin’ Now” and “We Run These Streets” are solid. Even the Snoop from the Wire and Mazaradi Fox feature on “It’s A Stick Up” were solid songs. But the rest of the songs were weak as hell and definitely suited for the skip button. The skip button was broke on this one. And this shit, was just not it.\n\n24. G-Unit Radio Pt. 18: Spider Loc- Rags 2 Riches (2006)\n\nI get it and I understand that this was supposed to be Game’s replacement but come on fam. This dude was ok talent wise but some of these songs were hot ass garbage. Filling the Game’s shoes is of course a rough task after he just sold 5 million worldwide. And I also do understand why his album never came out. Honestly, I would have rather have put out Olivia’s album than his. But there are a few impressive moments like the Game diss “No More Games” with Young Buck although they did well. The Game’s diss song “Spider Joke” completely annihilated what was left of Spider and 50 ultimately focused on 40 Glocc more than him. LMAO! “L.A. Niggas” with 50 Cent was decent but 50 re-used his verse from DMX’s “Shot Down” on here. Even a Ras Kass verse couldn’t save this debacle. But I also loved “Fuck The Haters” that was really dope and easily the gem of this disaster. But meh again this shit…….ain’t it.\n\n23. DJ Whoo Kid, Young Buck & Lebron James Presents: G-Unit Radio Pt. 24: The Clean Up Man (2007)\n\nHonestly in 2007, Young Buck’s album Buck The World album was a saving grace for the G-Unit brand. Because Banks’ album Rotten Apple did not live up to expectations. Although Buck accompanied his sophomore album with “Clean Up Man” it is his worst offering as a G-Unit member. You can’t even find the entirety of this mixtape online you would have to like buy it, buy it. It did include the lead single “Get Buck” which goes crazy. “Clean Up Man” which was the theme of the tape that ended up on “Buck The World” and the opening track on “Buck The World” in “Push Em Back” was dope. And outside of 50 Cent’s solo Cam’ron diss “The Funeral” the rest of the tape is not memorable despite Lebron James egging Buck on the whole tape.\n\n22. G-Unit Radio Pt. 12: Olivia- So Seductive (2005)\n\nOkay imma be honest, this isn’t really a bad project by Olivia she was always a decent vocalist shorty does have pipes. But 26 tracks (with skits) A waste of two intros with 50 was a bit too much in my opinion. But there are a few moments here: her version of Bobby Valentino’s “Slow Down” with a Lloyd Banks verse was fire. I definitely fucked with “Twist It” featuring Banks as well I was surprised it didn’t hit. Although they did put some songs on here to make shit interesting like 50 & Mobb Deep’s “Outta Control” Remix, Yayo’s “Pimpin” and “Sitting Sideways Freestyle”. The best song on here is “So Sexy” as this can argue as her best song in general to me. “Move That Thing” was dope although it was only a minute and 30 seconds. I didn’t like “Beat The Kitty Up” at all as she tried her hand at the Ying Yang Twins “Whisper Song” Okay lady just because Free tried her hand and succeeded don’t mean that you can LMAO! All jokes aside despite its low ranking it is a decent offering showing off what could have been her real album.\n\n21. G-Unit Radio Pt. 16: Ma$e- Crucified 4 The Hood: 10 Years Of Hate (2006)\n\nAs far as I’m concerned I was excited as fuck to here what Ma$e had he was back in his “hardcore rap” bag after he failed to re-capture fans with his “clean image” on the comeback album “Welcome Back” in 2004. But Ma$e although he was unable to contractually agree to terms with G-Unit officially due to Puff Daddy vetoing the deal it would later comeback to haunt Puff on 22 which will be explained later. Ma$e snarls on the opening track “10 Years Of Hate”. One thing we know is Ma$e can spit and another thing is Ma$e can make songs. But his image is inconsistent as fuck. Because remember he was a regular flashy nigga, then a preacher, a clean rapper, now he reverts back to the “Children Of The Corn/Murda Ma$e” persona. Despite that it’s heat on this shit: like “Majesty” as he kills the Kanye West “Hey Mama” beat, “Check Cleared” was fire. “From The A Now” and “Goin’ Back To Harlem” was not needed at all. He could have kept those. “Kamikaze” was the best song on here. Ma$e was in his fucking bag. “Got My Nine” was ass. “Gotta Survive” was an underrated gem. The posse cut “They Don’t Bother Me” as 50, Ma$e, Spider Loc & Young Buck all address their beefs with their foes and explain how it really doesn’t bother them despite being at odds with people. The closer the Olivia & 50 Cent duet “Best Friend” remix was a great way to close this out. Although this isn’t the best G-Unit Radio it wasn’t all bad for Ma$e as he established he was still one of the best rappers of all-time.\n\n20. G-Unit Radio Pt. 11: Tony Yayo- Yayo: Raw-N-Uncut; Hosted by Eminem & Mike Epps (2006)\n\nNow this was Yayo coldest mixtape. Mike Epps was cracking me the fuck up on all these skits about prison, etc. Now I think this is the last time that Tony Yayo was like in his peak form he was gearing up to release his only album: “Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon” and he was fresh out of jail and ready to release his album. But this mixtape here was fire for Yayo’s caliber of artist. “NYC Where I’m From” with Lloyd Banks this is the only time Yayo ever got Banks on a song that NBA scheme he used was ridiculous at that time. “They Call It Murder” the D-Block diss was awful and a waste of time sounds like a dog barking at the moon. He definitely could have left “I’m A Hustler” alone. Yayo of course put his single from his album “So Seductive” with 50 Cent on there as this is his biggest and best song and that song burned the summer of 05. Now the 50 Cent solo track “Gun Jam” one of 50’s best songs that you might not remember. That shit there is pure 50 at his best at the height of his career. The brash trash talking and tough talking. Yayo & 50 respond to rivals: Fat Joe, The Lox & Ja Rule on “I Run NY” as Yayo spits the best verse of his life. “I flip cocaine in a project lobby/And beat you with my pistol like Caine did Chauncey”. “Automatic moss berg who want a piece of this, punk/I’ll have Ja Rule buried in some high heeled pumps” although Kiss & The Lox won this battle; 50 and Yayo held their own as 50 taunts Jadakiss for not owning his jewelry and Puff still owning their publishing since 1996. The funny “Trillville” has Yayo rapping over “Some Cut”. And the Posse Cut “G-Unit’s My Gang” with 50, Banks & Buck was dope. All and all this showed exactly what we were anticipating for “Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon”.\n\n19. G-Unit Radio Pt. 7: 50 Cent- King Of New York (2004)\n\nThis tape here wasn’t the best it was shorter than most of them but this bitch had heat on there. Lloyd Banks’s solo song “G’z Up” was a banger and a prime Lloyd Banks spewing punchlines full of uppercuts. He also included “On Fire” as this was released prior to his debut album “The Hunger For More” as its first single. Young Buck, David Banner and Lil Flip Collab for “Welcome To The South” also landed on Buck’s debut album “Straight Outta Cashville” as the hard hitting beat showcases the three’s talent. 50 Cent and Game flex their chemistry on “Don’t Push Me Pussy” as the G-Unit rookie was fitting his way into the crew as he also had a solo song over Kanye West’s “Two Words” beat on “Fuck You” and 50 Cent bodies “Southside” rapping in a fast paced flow over Twista’s “Overnight Celebrity”. But overall, this tape was solid but it isn’t one of the more memorable tapes and is pretty much in the middle.\n\n18. G-Unit Radio Pt. 20: Mobb Deep- The Best In The Bizness Vol. 2 (2006)\n\nThis sequel wasn’t fucking with the first one but that doesn’t mean that it was bad. This was released a couple months after the first one and it had the uncensored version of “Pearly Gates” where Prodigy takes aim at God. YES THE CREATOR! Most of the Infamous artists Nyce and 40 Glocc were heavily featured on this tape as one of the songs which became G-Unit’s “Rider Pt. 2” In 40 Glocc and battle rapper Sam Scarfo’s “Where The Hammers At” with the crisp West Coast claps as 40 and Sam body this joint. The Blood Money Mobb Deep G-Unit album first single “Put Em In Their Place” was featured as it’s vintage Havoc with menacing horns and Prodigy’s great songwriting. My favorite song was Prodigy “Las Vegas P” as he bodies the Pharrell “Can I Have It Like That” beat. Overall, this tape wasn’t too bad just too many features and not enough Havoc for me.\n\n17. G-Unit Radio Pt. 17: Mobb Deep- The Best In The Bizness Vol. 1 (2006)\n\nMobb Deep was a hell of an acquisition for G-Unit. They were gearing up for the release of “Blood Money” and had a shitload of freestyles to hold us over. Prodigy took more of the wheel on this tape as Havoc rode shotgun. As G-Unit members Young Buck & Spider Loc would respond to Game on “Mr. Potato Head”. And 50’s response to multiple Game disses and tapes on “I’m Not Rich And Still Lyin'” As 50 Cent jokes that Game is a fake gangster and a stripper. “Keep Talkin” Havoc and Prodigy destroy The Lox “Can I Live” beat. Mobb Deep “The Infamous” is a classic song, classic Alchemist beat and Prodigy makes this track his own as he has two verses on here with a signature 50 Cent hook to ice the cake. Infamous Records Nyce had decent features on here as he appears on here as much as Havoc on “I’m A G”, “Die Already, “Shot Down”, “We On Fire” & “Roll Up”. This tape isn’t a classic but it’s a decent listen from start to finish.\n\n16. G-Unit Radio Pt. 5: G-Unit- All Eyes On Us (2004)\n\nThis tape was interesting to say the least as G-Unit members: 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Young Buck & The Game held it down mostly for Tony Yayo who unfortunately after 3 days out of prison had to go back into prison for passport fraud. But the G-Unit gang had a classic intro from future member Olivia. The four remaining members had collaborated on “I’m So Sorry” the jazzy but fire ass “Ya’ll Ain’t Fucking With Us” over the Cee-Lo “I’ll Be Around” beat. It includes the Lloyd Banks & Alchemist Collab “Bangers”. Three Eminem freestyles and one of the other ones a freestyle over 50 Cent “Wanksta”. Aftermath’s new artist Stat Quo dropped a freestyle as well. Game dropped a fire freestyle too. Before Yayo went back to prison he dropped two cold ass freestyles over the Beg For Mercy beats “My Buddy” and “Poppin’ Them Thangs”. All and all this tape was pretty solid nothing mediocre here.\n\n15. G-Unit Radio Pt. 25: 50 Cent- Sabrina’s Baby Boy; Hosted by Chris Rock (2007)\n\nI just listened to this tape in it’s entirety for the first time in 10 years. This shit was insane. It could be the hardest tape as far as the level of fucks given, bars, threats & tough talk. 50 Cent was mostly clowning Cam’ron on this tape egging him on to try to take shots at Fif. But little to no avail as “Curtis” the Cam diss was cool. Dude ended up naming it his album and Funeral in my opinion was the better diss. 50 Cent on this tape was having label issues with Jimmy Iovine because the label kept pushing Curtis back. If not for Kanye West sales battle challenge Curtis could have been shelved. And 50 Cent hinted at possible retirement on “Smile” but the big moments were with Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks on “Coke Life” which in my opinion was the best song on here and “Southside” as 50 pokes fun at Irv Gotti wearing a Supreme Team shirt when Kenneth McGriff was from Southside and Irv was from Hollis which didn’t get along. And the light Cam’ron jabs on “I’m On Some Shit” as the original G-Unit gets busy. Young Buck included 4 solo records of his own on “Class Is In Session”, “Get Down”, “Personal” and “Ride” which are solid. 50 Cent included the “I Get Money” big money remix with Hov and Puff. Seems like they initially squashed their beef to do their record……more on that later. The Lil Wayne and Birdman diss on “Part Time Lover”. Fif also includes “Curtis 187” off of “Curtis” and future T.O.S. banger “I Don’t Wanna Talk About It”. This mixtape series ended with a bang just as big as it started with one.\n\n14. G-Unit Radio Pt. 19: Freeway- Rep Yo Click (2006)\n\nHere is a dope joint venture 50 & Jay-Z. Freeway was prepping for his 2nd album “Free At Last” about to be released through G-Unit & Roc-A-Fella records. But this tape here had some heat on it. We know Freeway can rap his ass off. On the opener “Rep Yo Click” Freeway destroyed this beat and 12 years later would be remixed on the Superfly Soundtrack. Freeway & Peedi Crakk torch “Hood On Froze” putting that Philly cheese on that bitch. Freeway tried his hand at T.I.’s “What U Know” on “What You Know About Dat”. He let’s off the extended clip with his fire verse with Jody Breeze on “Trap Boy”. Freeway tussles with Beans over “Philly Niggas” and “Cosmic Kev Freestyle”. He also brings Southern Flavor with Juvie and Mannie on “You’s A Hoe”. “The Return” and “Speeding On The Freeway” just shows that Free still got it and isn’t gonna lose any gas any soon and built great expectations for his sophomore release.\n\n13. G-Unit Radio Pt. 9: Young Buck- Grand Theft Auto: G-Unit City (2004)\n\nYoung Buck was gearing up for his debut album “Straight Outta Cashville” and decided to accompany this mixtape with it as Buck delivered beef bars on “Kill 2 Birds”. Some ghetto soul on the Pac and Fif featured “Loyal To The Game” which would be on the Eminem produced 2Pac album later on. It did have all the GTA: San Andreas skits on there. As that video game dropped the same year. Buck tackles Alchemist’s “Hold U Down”. 50 smokes his solo song “Oh No” which would be featured on Snoop’s Rhythm & Gangsta album. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks & Eve appear on a track called Porn Star which is one of the standouts on this tape. Young Buck & Lil Flip feature on Chingy’s “Balla Baby” (Remix) which I hated this song and the remix to be honest. Eminem puts his record for his upcoming album “Encore” “Never Enough” on this tape which features 50 and Nate Dogg. Young Buck puts “Bang Bang” which was featured on Cashville. And also “DPG-Unit” which is a bonus track on Cashville as well which is a posse cut with Buck, 50, Banks, Snoop, Daz & Soopafly. This tape was a good addition to the G-Unit Radio collection despite not being one of my favorites.\n\n12. G-Unit Radio Pt. 3: G-Unit- Takin It To The Streets; Hosted By LeBron James (2003)\n\nThese niggas was wilding a young Rookie LeBron hosting as the G-Unit in their prime were prepping for their 1st official group release Beg For Mercy as their mixtape reputation was established. On the opener which is an old 2Pac song called “Sleep” on their 50 Cent taunts former G-Unit member Bang ‘Em Smurf on the track with the classic snarl “I’m like God to you niggas!” We get the first ever Game appearance with Banks and Fif on “So Hard” The P.I.M.P. G-Unit Remix is on here with fire verses from Banks and Buck. Lloyd Banks, Snoop & Busta Rhymes body Lil Jon’s “Play No Games” on “Dick Will Do” especially Busta. Banks also flexes his bars next to Fabolous and Brandy on “Fall Back” as Timbaland ended up giving that beat to Ms. Jade eventually. 50 & Young Buck tried they hand on Chingy’s “Right Thurr” beat and T.I.’s “24s” on “Calicos”. Obie Trice, Dr. Dre & Eminem had the unveiling of a Ja Rule and Benzino diss called “Shit Hits The Fan” which landed on Trice’s debut “Cheers”. Young Buck, Lil Flip & Snoop close out the tape with “So Wrong”. So this tape here was fucking crazy I’m not gonna lie these joints was wild and the collabs were damn near dream level. Them G-Unit tapes were everything.\n\n11. G-Unit Radio Pt. 10: 50 Cent- 2050 Before The Massacre (2005)\n\nWhat a time to be alive! I remember when this tape dropped. It had me excited as hell for the Massacre. Yes story time bitch. So I remember being in Vegas when “Disco Inferno” and “Candy Shop” premiered at the same time. Also “Drop It Like It’s Hot” too. But of course “The Massacre” was pushed back a little bit to March I believe of that year. But yea this tape included the main single “Candy Shop” with Olivia debuting as a member of G-Unit as they did their Ja/Ashanti replication. This included another one of my favorite 50 Cent joints “I’m An Animal” which was a crazy Alchemist in which later Jadakiss would destroy him on. LOL! 50 tackles the Biggie “My Downfall” track well. My favorite tracks on here are “We Gonna Hit Yo Ass Up” as Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent & Tony Yayo kills the Slim Thug “3 Kings” Beat and 50 & Yayo body Mobb Deep’s “When U Hear The” beat. 50 fucks with them Alchemist beats heavy I see. We got a little preview also of “Hate It Or Love It” as well on “Take Ya Back” as the track eventually went to The Game for “The Documentary” and So Did Tony Yayo’s solo track “I’m Runnin”. This tape was dope as fuck though.\n\n10. G-Unit Radio Pt. 21: 50 Cent- Hate It Or Love It (2006)\n\nMAAAAAAAN! Call it the pre-cursor to The Game’s hard hitting diss song “The Funeral” maaaan when this cover came out I was fucking rolling because The Game had came out with Stop Snitching, Stop Lying and this was G-Unit’s turn to response as the skits on here were funny as hell including the intro and the excerpts of Game’s 2001 appearance on the old TV show “Change Of Heart”. 50 subs The Game on “Make A Movie Out Em” as 50 Cent flexes on here and shows he still got that Southside in him. “Paper Chaser” was a bad idea as he tried to do an East Coast version of “Ha”. He taunts Game again on “Stop Crying”. Lloyd Banks promotion of his sophomore album single “Hands Up” pops up on here. This shit used to ride I can’t even lie that hook catchy as hell. Mobb Deep and 50 body the Dr. Dre produced “Nightmares” this shit was crazy I recommend you check this one out. “Misdemeanor” was fire as he rapped over the Foster Sylvers sampled song. And “Just Too Much” was fire. The Young Buck closer “My Hood” was amazing. Fam this is a classic tape of the lower-tier although it isn’t mentioned among the best mixtapes of all-time you can’t deny the cover, the skits, or the collection of songs on here.\n\n9. G-Unit Radio Pt. 2: 50 Cent- International Ballers (2003)\n\nThis is pretty much 50 coming off the success of Get Rich Or Die Tryin as this tape had a lot of live performance excerpts off of their international tour. As each current G-Unit member had a chance to shine and they bought along fire ass features with them. Tony Yayo was not featured on here due to his incarceration. The intro is a classic because it’s a vintage 50 making fun of Ja Rule doing duets and wilding. But Banks, Buck and 50 held it down on the opener “Get Shot The Fuck Up”. Banks snaps on “Clips” over the Clipse “I’m Serious” beat. Banks, Buck & 50 do decent on the R. Kelly “Snake” Beat. Fif, Lil Flip & Lloyd body “Like A Pimp” beat. And my favorite joint which was Lloyd Banks, Nate Dogg and Snoop Dogg killing the “One For Peedi Crakk” instrumental. Although their isn’t many songs due to the live songs this tape solidified 50 as a superstar in the making and G-Unit as the future.\n\n8. G-Unit Radio Pt. 6: Lloyd Banks- Motion Picture Shit (2004)\n\nAt this time Lloyd Banks was gearing up to drop his debut album “Hunger For More” Banks at this time was the hottest mixtape artist out even hotter than his boss 50 Cent. Banks’s charisma, style, and hard hitting punchlines put him next to greats like Jadakiss, Fabolous, Ludacris and Cassidy as one of the most serious punchline kings in history. Lloyd Banks ends up using album gem “Warrior” to help promote. Floyd Mayweather also appears on the Intro and Outro. He destroys “Homicide” and “I’m Back”. Eminem previews two songs which were slated for D12’s 2nd release “D12 World” in “Git Up” and “My Band” which makes this tape entertaining. Game & Snoop drop heat on “Red & Blue”. Young Buck & Lil Flip did well on the Luniz “I Got 5 On It” beat. Lloyd Banks shows that this tape definitely is a top 10 G-Unit Radio tape of all time.\n\n7. G-Unit Radio Pt. 22: 50 Cent- Hip Hop Is Dead (2006)\n\nTaking a theme out of the book from Nas (who also dissed him). 50 Cent calls himself responsible for killing hip hop as on the Intro there is a preacher giving his regards to Nas, Jada, Fat Joe, Ja Rule, and the aforementioned Puff Daddy. Who in 16 I mentioned I would be back here. 50 started a beef with Puff because he was trying to sign Ma$e to a 300,000 dollar record deal. And it was supposed to be agreed on but Puff didn’t want to give up the rights. And 50 threw a fit because he took Ma$e on tour with him and since Ma$e was signed to Puff he wanted his money and costs and expenses from bringing Ma$e on tour so throughout the tape he is dissing Puff on the “Intro”, the Yayo and Hot Rod featured “Get Down”, various skits, and the Outro. New G-Unit Addition Hot Rod who in which had a single called “Be Easy” with MJB produced by Dr. Dre was also featured on “I Got Hoes” as well as 50 said he was a non-street version of him with the songwriting ability. Now this tape has some classics. 50, Prodigy & 40 Glocc kill Snoop Dogg’s “Serial Killer”. 50 & Yayo put that East Coast feel on “Watch Yo Back” 50, Banks, Hot Rod & Yayo execute “Girl Gimme Yo Number” perfectly and brings some comedy element to the tape by singing and destroying New Edition’s “Hot 2 Nite” (who was signed to Bad Boy ironically). 50 Cent bodied Omarion’s “Entourage” with “Superstar” which was so hard that it charted on Billboard higher than Omarion’s original version. He bodied that first verse. Then 50 Cent hops on Fergie’s “London London” and kills that shit. 50 Cent also hops on two Dead Prez classic songs “Mind Sex” and “Hip Hop”. The latter which brags about his crew running hip hop. “Puppy Love” was wild too as he talked shit about all his former girlfriends in his past. It closes out with Young Buck’s single with Jazze Pha “I Know You Want Me” which was dope. This tape was fire no skip moments just a classic prime 50 Cent mixtape.\n\n6. G-Unit Radio Pt. 14: G-Unit- Back To Business (2005)\n\nThe second installment of this expansion Unit. Back To Business begins with Ma$e killing the Juelz Santana “Mic Check” with “Check Cleared” as he spits braggadocios lines about signing to the franchise. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Prodigy, Spider Loc and Young Buck kill the posse cut “Robbery”. 50 Cent fires shots at Game and Jimmy Henchman on “Emotional”. Banks and Buck “Thuggin Til I’m Gone” is a classic. M.O.P. bring the energy to “Dance” doing their M.O.P. thing excessive yelling and shit. 50 Cent kills the Mobb Deep “The Realest” beat. Oh Alchemist…… Young Buck & 50 Cent take care of Common’s “Go” beat with “Hos Hos”. Although Yayo taunts Fat Joe and Jadakiss on “Yay Got That Fire” because he debuted at #2 in the country leave Jeezy’s “Soul Survivor” alone my guy SMH! Speaking of leave Jeezy beats alone. Spider Loc was abysmal over the “Go Crazy” beat if not for Buck’s hook saving it from being a -99 out of 5. Other than that this tape stands out and shows what could have been if all these niggas stayed with the Unit.\n\n5. G-Unit Radio Pt. 15: G-Unit- Are You A Window Shopper? (2005)\n\nThis another classic tape during the G-Unit expansion team era. The squad was gearing up for the “Get Rich Or Die Tryin” movie soundtrack. Which featured the whole crew; as does this one. It begins with “I Don’t Know Officer” which is on the soundtrack and features a classic Ma$e, Prodigy and 50 verse as Spider Loc and Lloyd Banks also feature on this classic posse cut. “Talk About Me” is 50 Cent over a classic Dr. Dre beat as he speaks on his new fame from his family’s point of view. I mentioned how cold Ma$e and 50’s “Kamikaze” was. As Ma$e destroys the long verse “If you wanna keep fronting like the champ imma Tarver niggas”. Banks, Buck & 50 which my homie calls the triangle offense. The Beg for Mercy offense kill “You Already Know”. Mobb Deep & 50 body “You A Shooter”. And Yayo bodies the hook on Mobb Deep’s “Gang Bang”. Of course 50 Cent’s single off the Get Rich soundtrack “Window Shopper” is featured except the hook changes into disses for Nas, Jada, Fat Joe & Ja Rule. Also features Lloyd Banks standout “I Can’t”. Olivia flexes her entourage over the Spider Loc featured “So Sick”. Also features Lil Scrappy’s G-Unit debut “Stack That Paper”. This tape was crazy fire and I definitely recommend it.\n\n4. G-Unit Radio Pt. 4: G-Unit- No Peace Talks (2003)\n\nListen these niggas got the excerpts from the Ja Rule & Louis Farrakhan interview fam. And these niggas still clowning him. 50 really wanted to destroy this man fam. G-Unit was gearing up to drop their debut album “Beg For Mercy” album. Lloyd Banks bodies the opening track “No Peace Talks” which is the DMX “Shot Down” beat. 50 Cent kills the Jay-Z “Lucifer” beat. There are 3 songs that were on “Beg For Mercy” on this tape “Eye For An Eye”, “Groupie Love” and “G’d Up”. Young Buck kills the Luda beat “Stand Up” with “I Shoot You Shoot”. So this tape was insane. Mobb Deep and 50 Cent show early chemistry on “Clap Those Thangs”. 50 Clowns Ja Rule on “Clap Back Interlude” as he refused to rap on the beat. So this shit was nuts def a top 5 G-Unit tape for sure. Just that vibe.\n\n3. G-Unit Radio Pt. 8: The Game- The Fifth Element Hosted by Steve-O (2004)\n\nMan, so when Game officially joined G-Unit it was a fucking frenzy an East Coast rap group with a Southern nigga and a West Coast nigga. They were starting to get NWA comparisons because at that time and even with the current status these niggas was the modern day NWA in a way. The Game was preparing to release his Game changing album (pun intended) album “The Documentary” but it endured a few pushbacks due to Game’s inability to write hooks. So Dr. Dre hired 50 to help Game write his hooks and Fif tossed him a couple of joints that was intended for the “Massacre” But this nigga on his first official mixtape had Jay-Z & Dr. Dre on “Get Yo Money Right”. Busta and DJ Quik join Game on “Die Too Soon”. Lloyd Banks has a solo track “Playboy” that ended up on “Hunger For More”. Not to mention Steve-O along for the ride for silly skits dissing Game rivals Benzino, Ja Rule & Joe Budden at the time. “Still Cruising” with the posthumous and classic Eazy-E verse. “Do You Remember” with 50 and Yayo was classic. Of course the 9 minute diss song “200 Bars” which was a phenomenon at the time. Crazy! The classic joint with Lil Scrappy & Game “Feel My Pain” was the standout on this project. Then the Banks, WC & Snoop Dogg assisted “Fly Like An Eagle” was crazy too. This is easily one of the best tapes G-Unit ever released and it makes you wonder what if Game would have stayed in G-Unit then they get Mobb Deep and all the others……except Spider Joke LMAO!\n\n2. G-Unit Radio Pt. 13: The Return Of The Mixtape Millionaire\n\nYou niggas just will never understand the first installment of that G-Unit expansion squad. There are so many bangers on here it is insane. Like it or not; hate it or love it 50 Cent is a great businessman and he tried to expand that group and it worked the fuck out here on this 13. Some of the songs are live songs on the world tour edition side of the game. But the regular songs from top to bottom this damn near perfect. The opener “300 Shots” is one of the most if not the most underrated posse cuts of all time: 50, Yayo, Buck, Banks, Lil Fame from M.O.P., Ma$e & Mobb Deep on the same song? These niggas won’t get it dog. They was taking subs at Game on this but Banks was a bit more direct as he had the longest and the most standout verse. Yayo included joints from Predicate Felon The Olivia, Banks and 50 featured “We Don’t Give A Fuck” and the 50 and Kokane featured “So High” Young Buck’s offerings was crazy freestyles first off the Kanye West- “Gold Digger” beat on “Gimme Mine” and my personal favorite over Jermaine Dupri “Gotta Getcha” beat on “They Takin’ Pictures” as he boasts about Ma$e signing to the Unit. Mobb Deep’s- Glitter N Glass got that dark vintage Mobb Deep sound on it. Ma$e on “Return Of The Murda” it doesn’t really impress me as he is dissing people on there that isn’t necessary. Banks & Yayo’s “We Run This” is another standout as the first 15 seconds will get you hype as fuck. The two M.O.P. offerings are solid as Lil Fame kills The Game’s “Hard Liquor” beat. Buck & Yayo make a song for the groupies over Common’s “They Say” beat with “Shorty Wanna Gangsta Nigga”. Even with the live songs this tape supersedes the hype. Definitely also should be mentioned with the greatest mixtapes ever at least top 50.\n\nG-Unit Radio Pt. 1: 50 Cent & Snoop Dogg- Smokin Day 2\n\nThis tape leaves niggas speechless bruh. The OG G-Unit Radio? 50 and Snoop? Both these niggas had a lot in common. Both with great melodic hooks, talented songwriters, both cool and funny ass niggas and last but not least both their debut albums broke records so it was only right for these niggas to link as the vet took the rookie under his wing and G-Unit pretty much teamed up with the Dogg Pound (Daz, Snoop & Soopafly at the time due to Kurupt going back to Death Row). But this certified classic was off the chain from start to finish as 50 starts off with the Pac assisted “Realest Killaz” which would end up on the 2Pac Resurrection Soundtrack. As 50 takes digs at Ja Rule on the song. The original “P.I.M.P. Remix” with just him and Snoop and Don Magic Juan was crazy at that time. 50, Banks & Buck clown on their version of Busta & Mariah’s “I Know What You Want”. Lloyd Banks acts a goddamn fool on Snoop Dogg’s “Beautiful” beat. 50, Yayo & Banks snap on “Loyalty”. The Game debuts his first solo freestyle on this tape. 50 adds “High All The Time” from “Get Rich Or Die Tryin” which fits the tape perfectly. Snoop, Daz & Soopafly bodied “Hydro Hit”. This tape began an era in 2003 of crazy mixtapes and gave a lot of artists platforms to shine which 50 doesn’t get enough credit for doing.\n\nThis era should be remembered 50 Cent because this is a part of your legacy. These mixtapes helped mold and shape the game for many artists to drop mixtapes as well as drop them shits with they crew of homeboys and artists. But I hope this took some of you niggas back down memory lane cause I remember this shit like it was yesterday."
