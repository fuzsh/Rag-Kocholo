        "text": "Eminem and Cypress Hill’s B-Real have recorded the song “911” with veteran rap outfit Boo Yaa Tribe which will appear on the latter’s upcoming album, “West Kosta Nostra.” “Hip-hop is in a state of 911,” Eminem raps on the cut. “It feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off.” Due Oct. 7 via Sarinjay, “West Kosta Nostra” features an array of other rap stars, including Kurupt, Mack 10, WC, Knoc’turn’al, Short Khop, Crooked I and Kokane.\n\nBoo Yaa Tribe rose to prominence with its 1990 debut, “New Funky Nation,” but in later years failed to duplicate the success of that effort. The group’s most recent album, “Mafia Lifestyle” was issued on the independent S.M. Records in 2000.\n\nAlso in the pipeline is the release of a shelved 1992 album, “Good Times Bad Times,” which features guest turns from George Clinton, Living Colour, Ice Cube and Ice-T. In addition, the Boo Yaa boys are at work on a rap-metal album that will sport an appearance by former Guns ‘N Roses guitarist Slash, among others.\n\nBoo Yaa tribe member Gawtti can be seen on the big-screen in the recent film “The Italian Job,” starring Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton."
