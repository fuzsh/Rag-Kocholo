        "text": "I met my future father in-law Ralph at my future wife’s home in 1999 or so. His daughter, Karen, had a little party at her house and invited some of us from work. In an effort to avoid the crowd I tried hiding in the garage and, as luck would have it, the BEER was in the garage so Ralph and a few others were out there guarding said beer. Keeping my head down in an effort of human contact avoidance I shuffled toward the coolers, I saw the tops of Ralph’s shoes coming my way and knew I was going to have to “interact”. As I grabbed a beer, Ralph thrust out a large hand with a huge welcoming grin and said “Hi I’m Spaulding, you’ve played with my balls”\n\nHe roared a thunderous belly laugh and I knew right away this guy was alright. Just about then Karen materialized by his side, before I could warn her about this guy she said “this is my dad Ralph”. Seeing my quizzical look, Karen shot Ralph a look “you didn’t do the Spaulding thing did you?” “DAD”!\n\nThis was the beginning of a long and wonderful friendship. We had trips to Mexico with Ralph donning cowboy boots and swim trunks and a horrific faded green bucket hat. Ralph was a huge proponent of embarrassing his children and wife whenever possible and he made the most of every opportunity.\n\nRalph helped me build the backyard shed after Karen and I married, the family neglected to tell me that Ralph was about as mechanically inclined as a door stop. One day I admonished Ralph for his baggy pants and made a note to get him the suspenders that look like a tape measure seeing as he was now a assistant carpenter!\n\nMoments later as we carried a truss from the curb to the backyard, I heard Ralph lament “Well, it finally happened” . Ralph had stopped abruptly and the truss conked me in the head, “shit Ralph what’s going on back there”? We dropped the truss and I turned to behold Ralph in all his glory\n\n“RALPH PULL UP YOUR PANTS”!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIt didn’t seem to faze Ralph that his pants were resting comfortably around his ankles,but he methodically pulled them back up, thus sparing what remained of my optic nerve .\n\nNow that he was back to a fully clothed status, Ralph and I struggled to get the first truss in place. With our backs to each other it was hard for me to figure out exactly what the problem was on Ralph’s end of the truss as we pulled and pushed furiously, getting nowhere fast.\n\nI finally said “stop stop stop, just put your end down Ralph”. I balanced my end on the already completed wall where it would soon be nailed and climbed down the ladder. And what a sight to behold, Ralph clutching his jeans in one hand while holding his end of the truss all the while trapped on the ladder unable to go further up or retreat! I took Ralph’s end and told him to toenail the other end in place while I held this end in place. The truss was heavy enough and certainly awkward enough that I couldn’t do anything more than keep it from tumbling 9 feet to the ground, taking Ralph and I and the ladders with it. After what seemed like an eternity of banging and what my trained ear recognized as MANY “missed nail swings”. Ralph ! Ralph! What in the hell are you doing over there???” This thing is HEAVY!!!”\n\nRALPH: I think there is something wrong with your nails!!, they don’t want go into the wood”\n\nI quickly retrieved a hammer and nail praying the truss would stay and not kill my helper, I climbed up the ladder behind Ralph to find\n\nI secured Ralph’s end and we retreated to the cool shade of the patio\n\nWith that task complete Ralph happily announced “well I guess we should have a beer don’t ya think?” Ralph would calmly defuse a variety of situations by this phase or “nice weather we’re havin” or “ it’s about happy hour,what ya drinking?”\n\nAfter all his help with the shed I could only wonder at the hilarity that must have ensued during the Barton Family cabin build on Casper mountain in 1977 or so. I pumped Ralph’s great friends, Herman and Fred, at every get together to enchant me with stories of Ralph’s ineptitude with any hand tool and they happily provided. Each tale, perhaps further embellished from the last telling just mere months ago, began with a deep heartfelt belly laugh that started somewhere in the arches of Fred or Herman’s feet! I would spy Ralph hiding his eyes with a hand as he joined the laughter, knowing in his good natured way that he was about to be ridiculed once again. The crew of friends working on the cabin always tried to find something befitting to Ralph’s carpentry skills, like painting the tar sealant on the concrete that would be backfilled with dirt and never seen. Or invented “parts” runs down the mountain to Casper for double headed nails and ALWAYS more beer. Ralph took all the ribbing in stride and would just assume his patented “what are ya looking at me for “ pose. Ralph had a calm in most all things that came his way, he cared not that he couldn’t run a hammer, or any other tool for that matter, and he was fine with that. A trait many of us could aspire to, a calmness in your own skin.\n\nRalph was know for many endearing traits and habits, one was giving ya the finger! I learned right away that Ralph rarely gave the finger in anger, with Ralph it was his personalized form of salutation! The FINGER was reserved for people he liked and cared for! During his long career as a Ski Patrol member on Hodagon Mountain, Ralph drove the mountain road thousands of times. Ralph knew many of the mountain residence as neighbors if not personal friends and they would sometimes get the bird on the way up and the way down! If someone got a new car, they would ask Ralph’s son, Jim, “Is Ralph mad at me? He stopped giving me the bird!!” Jims reply of “Just start giving him the finger first till recognizes ya” was welcomed with a joyful grin, and an eagerness to try it.\n\nOne Christmas I gifted Ralph a lifelike remote control hand THAT FLIPPED THE BIRD. He laughed like a little kid!!\n\nBeing the little kid at heart that he was, Ralph also enjoyed a good fart, particularly his own. One Christmas, while seating at the dinner table, Ralph was insistent that I occupy a particular chair once dinner commenced. Beaming with pride that Ralph wanted me to occupy a place of honor at the other head of the table seat, I merrily added two more chairs and scooched my chair to make room. My foot kicked something under the table!!! On blended knee I found a plastic box under my chair encased in duct tape that appeared to have been attached to the bottom of my chair. Unable to see what I found in the dim of the formal dinning room I retreated to the bathroom in search of light. What I had was something similar to this!!!!!!\n\nTHAT EVIL BASTARD!!!!\n\nRalph had played my pride like a fiddle, ensuring I was seated at the head of the table with the flatulence machine of embarrassment not so expertly taped underneath . Discreetly fetching new duct tape, I affixed the cut the cheese machine to Ralph’s chair!!!!\n\nDuring a lull in the feast I noticed Ralph fumbling below the tablecloth, no doubt in search of the right button, just then, a thunderous bellowing of a fart emitted from Ralph’s direction. The entire table turned in unison to stare at Ralph, many can imagine Ralph’s look of bewilderment as he furiously pressed the button hoping for a different outcome. The realization hit Ralph and he turned to me and silently mouthed “you son of a bitch you”. His bellowing laughter almost drowned out Lucille’s admonishment of “Ralph J. Barton”!!! As the table joined the joke.\n\nI heard many stories that occurred years before I became part of the family, most were of world travels with friends and family, many of the misadventures were with Herm or Fred or some or all the rest of his gang, and many stories of Ralph’s humor and acts of kindness. I experienced this kindness many times, one example involved my dog Junior. Junior was at the end of his life’s journey when Ralph accompanied me to Fort Collins to try and buy Junior a few more months at the veterinary college. Previous trips by Karen and Junior yielded 2-3 months of relief, but on this trip, Ralph and I were told the well has run dry as we stood in the exam room watching Junior pace. Ralph loved Junior as much as I did and we both shed tears as we said our goodbyes. Ralph embraced me and comforted me as I sobbed like a child, this bear of a man, exposed his soft side to provide me comfort even amidst his own grief.\n\nWe drove in silence, except for the occasional sniffle, until the Wyoming line, when Ralph announced we should get a six pack and toast to Juniors life and adventures. The next 3 hours were as good as they could be, Ralph shared Junior memories and misbehaviors that I hadn’t been unaware of! In short Ralph extended a kindness to me that is rare, he gave freely of himself in an effort to ease my pain.\n\nI learned early that dogs were unbelievably important to Ralph, the morning would start with a walk and yet another in early afternoon . Ralph’s lunch would be somewhere in between, complete with that fake Kraft cheese, doled out to each of the 4-5 dogs on hand on any given day. The crew was normally Ralph’s dog, Our dogs (2), his MIL’s dog, many times his sons dog, or a grandkids dogs, or YOUR dog. Ralph took to counting dogs as he loaded them into his slobber covered sedan in an effort to avoid bringing home an “extra”.I close my eyes and can see Ralph smiling broadly, an elbow on the door, the breeze in his face, one hand on the wheel at 12 o’clock, his canine laden car hurtling down college drive at 17 miles an hour with at least one dog out each window.\n\nI have a hundred stories, but you get the idea of a fine man, a fine husband, and a loving father who past on his best traits to his three children, and for me, a Great Friend.\n\nWe said goodbye to Ralph November 1st 2023 at Central Wyoming Hospice in Casper Wyoming, but I still see his broad smile in every dog I meet.\n\nI wont bore you with “you never know what tomorrow holds”\n\nI’ll leave you with: enjoy the greatness of your great friends today and just as importantly aspire to be one as well.\n\nThose of you who are old enough to have watched the moon landing on a 13 inch black and white TV, used a bong before it was legal and remember ashtrays on airplanes, let us marvel at the technology today! I’m sure its hard for the youngsters to conceive that we used to use paper maps and word of mouth for camping or fishing spots. Hard to imagine people would trade travel info in dark smokey bars back when I had hair\n\nYes people smoked in bars,just about everywhere,except church from what I was told. I recall sweeping the floor at the local drug store that I worked at back near Pittsburgh as a teen, chasing middle aged women as they chain smoked Virginia Slims,grinding them out on the floor with a high heal. Every isle from baby formula to tampons littered with butts,but I was making $1.60 an hour so smoke away BABY!\n\nANYWAY, google maps is a great invention and no smoking on airplanes is an even better idea. I think Ricky Nelson catching his plane on fire while freebasing cocaine *which led to his death may have even caused us, uhhhh,I mean people to rethink smoking weed in airplane lavatories too. Personal growth is a great thing, don’t you think?\n\nWhere was I? Besides confused?\n\nGoogle maps,ahh yes\n\nSome months ago we headed into the Arizona mountains for fifth wheel camping\n\nMy navigator Karen , said google maps says there’s some great spots down this road…..so off we go, just outside of Prescott Az, or somewhere, I’m not the damn navigator,what do I know.\n\nAs we happily and perhaps stupidly meandered down what looked to be a pretty good dirt/rocky road,I silently wondered about the hapless saps that spent their days and nights camping in “resort” type facilities with their pools\n\nPickle ball,shuffleboard,mini golf,driving range, skeet shooting,jacuzzi,tennis courts, dog park the size of Delaware ,strip joint…oh wait,they don’t usually have strip joints..humm?\n\nThose bozos will never camp like Karen and I!!!\n\nJust a 1/4 mile down the dirt road,we spied a open area to the left that had some RV’s parked there. We slowed to checked it out ! Someone had the grill going\n\nAs the smoke waffled our way I expected the sweet aroma of BBQ but instead we were greeted with a metallic chemical smell! Unsure of what exactly they were “cooking” but being a Breaking Bad aficionado I could guess.\n\nI hit the gas and the Mc5er lurched forward past the tweekers and towards yet another dry creek bed, but adding distance between us and the the druggies was paramount!\n\nGoogle maps, much to our dismay continually showed what appeared to be boondocking camp sites that turned out to be more dry washes,\n\nWe forged ahead as I cursed myself for not scouting ahead with just the pickup, I had driven us into a very bad situation as the road continued to narrow with no place to turn around . The road became almost nonexistent in some spots\n\nAnd in the “good” spots ,it was scary as hell\n\nI tried to keep my whimpering silent as I thought of our impending death by a 100’ tumble down the steep embankment, encased in our Ford F250 tomb!\n\nKaren SNAPPED me out of it with a shout of\n\nYOU P*SSY!!!!!\n\nWe got to a spot that did not appear wide enough for a pickup, rock wall on my right and a 120 foot drop on my left! I folded in the passenger mirror and got as close to the wall as I dare, fearful of scratching Karen’s baby! Karen said “ya got another 5/8 of an inch over here if ya need it”. As I crept along glancing in my mirror every 1.223 seconds, I saw an image that made my heart flutter and my skivies fill with dodo. THE ROAD WAS GIVING WAY UNDER THE Mc5er TIRES!!!!!!!!!\n\nMy minds eye saw this over and over\n\nSomehow my sphincter trying to clench caused my right foot to spasm and mash down on the accelerator! My eyes locked on the mirror,willing the tires that floated in air to stay straight, but to my horror they every so slowly were starting to tilt toward the bottom of the rocky gorge. In a millisecond my foot mashed harder on the gas, although it was already floored,I swear I felt the floorboard compress further. Much to the chagrin of our heirs, the Ford reacted to my minds pleas of “HOLY SH*T GO!!!!!!” I breathed a sigh of relief as the tires found dirt, leaving the cave in behind us!I cleared the sweat that burned my eyes, grateful to be alive.\n\nJust then Karen looked up from her book and asked,”did you fart”?\n\nWe drove for what seemed like miles and miles across the terrifying moonscape of death in search of a turn around to no avail. As I mentally calculated the cost of a cargo helicopter to extract the Mc5er and F250 from this highway to hell…….\n\nWhat should appear? A wide spot in the road!!!!! Although it didn’t appear to be wide enough to turn around in,it was wide enough to drop the Mc5er and still allow a PU to pass, not that we had seen any other vehicles in what was feeling like a lifetime on this crap road\n\nKaren and I expertly dropped the fifth wheel in record time,eager to forge ahead, hopeful for salvation from this parkway toward purgatory.\n\n3 hairpin curves and 250 yards later our hearts sank as the road turned into a footpath as the road had completely given way\n\nLet’s see…….can’t go forward ,Check\n\nCan’t go backwards,Check\n\nWe’re fu*ked, Check\n\nKaren cuffed me upside the head and firmly admonished me “snap out of it cowboy, we got one choice….well two choices ,one choice being DYING!!!!!! Which isn’t really a preferred choice OR go back the way we came”\n\nI backed the pick up the 250 yards back to the Mc5er in just under 3 1/2 hours, and we were a bit disappointed that no one had stolen it. That would have certainly simplified things.\n\nAfter hooking back up to Mc5er we milled about the “wide spot” trying to envision how this turn around job was gonna work.\n\nAs I tried to channel my internal “Will Hunting“ and apply it to the current algebraic skull cramp, I quickly decided that I didn’t posses the necessary level of quality grey matter. Unfortunately, the grey matter I’m blessed with is only good for its silly comedic ability and as a place to store a lifetime of concussions.\n\nIn an effort to keep with the mentality I was born with, I just said “fu*k it, it’ll work or it won’t but we won’t know till we start”\n\nKaren bravely scampered back and forth behind the Mc5er trying to guide me. Karen knows that every inch matters….especially in this situation, we also have our own set of hand signals that Karen invented for backing up the trailer and I’m not really clear on the meaning on all of them but I know this one means STOP!!!!!!!\n\nOur plan was to back the first set of trailer tires up to the edge until little baby avalanches of dirt started to cascade down the gorge then pull forwards 3 inches. Of course the challenge here was to not create adult avalanches that thunder down the ravine dragging me, the Mc5er, the truck and the yeti full of beer to our death.I pock marked the shear wall so many times with the front bumper that it resembled my teenage face, but it did appeared we were making some headway…Time drug on and it certainly felt like it took the same amount of time it took to talk Kelly Such out of her tube top in 9th grade*\n\nBut we were finally POINTING THE RIGHT WAY!!!\n\nOur merriment was brief as the realization hit that the original cave in lay ahead like a meeting with the IRS , parent teacher night or your 6 year old great nephew’s Christmas pageant.All of the aforementioned examples ,though uncomfortable are not immediately life threatening like the Evil Knievl jump that lay ahead.\n\nThe drive back was made even more unnerving by the fact that I was on the rock wall side now and could only try and scrub the mirror on the wall in an attempt to put distance between the precipice and our tires. Karen’s occasional commentary of “holy sh*t holy sh*t” although understandable was not entirely helpful, but then Karen cried out “is that a truck”! Ahead several hairpin turns a dust cloud and perhaps a truck was coming our way!!!\n\nOtis and Etta awoke from their nap and eyeballed the welcome apparition\n\nAt 75 yards out the driver found a spot to turn around and signaled me to follow him out! How cool is that? He easily made it across the cave in a few minutes later, and Karen and the twins walked across just in case.\n\nMy plan was to gun it, admittedly not much of a plan but given the circumstances perhaps the best. I stared down the gantlet\n\nLike that 1970’s hero\n\nI gunned the engine hoping to jump off the line\n\nWith the accelerator thru the firewall…..I lurched forward\n\nAt 7 mph hour my body wasn’t thrust back into my seat as I had hoped,so I rocked back and forth like a child trying to get a swing going. This seemed to have about as much of a positive effect as a speech from the Oval Office, but somehow at a max speed of 12 mph we drifted across the abyss to safety!\n\nIn a few miles our good Samaritan’s pulled off into the RV meth encampment we observed coming in a lifetime ago. A few more ratty RV’s had set up in our absence with children running about giving me the finger…how cute…..and a impromptu concert…….. what?\n\nFor safety sake I told Karen to stay in the truck and enjoy the music and dancing while I went and thanked the pick up truck driver\n\nAs I approached he smiled broadly\n\nBeing deaf as a post I have to stare at peoples mouths to try and lip read if you will…..this was not a pleasant experience\n\nI thanked him with a $20 and wish him a great day, as I scurried my middle class ass back to the safety of Karen and the truck I heard him beckon “ come on Kenny lets go to Walmart and get some sterno”!\n\nOnce safely on the blacktop, where our only worry was a flat tire or maybe fatal crash, we still felt better about our chances than the area we just left.\n\nAs I quietly hummed that catchy banjo tune, Karen pecked away at Google in search of the nearest RV RESORT before I could even suggest it! As we drove I marveled aloud at how we managed to get turned around, Karen giggled slightly then admitted “ I backed you up until the first tire was airborne and the last tire made little avalanche’s , I didn’t tell you cause I knew you’d just snivel about the possibility of dying and all”\n\n* further investigation of Ricky Nelsons plan crash refuted initial claims of a crack pipe induced fire\n\n* I never got close to talking Kelly Such’s tube top off but like the Ricky Nelson thing it made for better prose\n\nOn a more serious note, those of you who RV or even truck camp, be careful of nature and your fellow man, it can be dangerous out there.\n\nThe twins\n\nand I arrived in the desert for our camping trip near Florence Az pretty much unscathed after the minor incident with the construction zone and the Man-bun guy from American Horror Story\n\nThe “twins” Etta and Otis leapt from the pick up like we use to when we heard LAST CALL!!!!! I was sooo happy for them until I noticed they ran 100 mph right out of sight. Bastards……..I busied myself with the traditional Coors Light ….cracked as soon as we arrive at our spot…half way thru the third one I remembered that the beer comes AFTER the Mc5er is set up!!!!!! Being old I had to really focus on WHAT I needed to do….but being old , all I could think about was I really need to pee. For you younger readers who can drink a 12 pack without peeing and pee over a 5’ fence after your 12th beer……….just you wait!\n\nMy brain cleared faster than Uncle Joes fogs up when I realized this was going to be a real challenge without my lovely wife, camping partner and owner of 78% of our family’s grey matter. As I mentioned before , we each have separate duties when setting up the Mc5er,but I figured…hey I got this….I went to high school….graduated and everything.\n\nI stared blankly at the control panel wishing I’d paid closer attention to what exactly Karen did ,as I usually busily myself in the bed of the Ford slowly trying to empty the beer cooler while Karen does all the work\n\nI figured what the hell, took a swig of beer and started punching buttons , while screaming MAO like Christopher Walken’s captor in the movie The Deer Hunter\n\nThe camper convulsed and groaned like a old man trying to tie his shoes or the really old guy you hear in the club house using the next urinal over…….not pretty!!!!\n\nAfter 15 or 20 minutes of trying to accomplish what Karen completes in 1-2 minutes, I figured “close enough “……a little cribbing under the wheels…..chock the tires……and we’ll be ready for a rum drink!\n\nAfter assembling a RUM and coke,I went searching for the twins…….those two are what I imagine twin toddlers to be…….faster than the contents of an old time thermometer with a splash of Chucky\n\nA few minutes later I found them pacing around a recently uprooted desert bush,the bush had be expertly trenched around its 360 degree drip line in an effort to capture and KILL whatever hapless rodent tried to live there\n\nBy promising a special treat and cool fresh water to wash down 5 pounds of recently ingested dirt I was able to entice the twins back towards the Mc5er….after watering and feeding the twins I splashed a new drink and relaxed in a lawn chair.\n\nBeat down on me like\n\nI drifted in and out ……napping until the unwanted occasional companion of all old men appeared intermittently to jostle me from slumber….the nose fart……….I told myself enjoy a nap! It’s not like I’m responsible for leading the Greatest Nation in the World!\n\nAfter napping in the sun,walking with the dogs each day thus amassing a distance similar to Shermans March to the sea\n\nI decided that camping without your lovely wife, best camping pal and life mate was BORING!!!, so after three days in the desert we headed back to Moon Pond.\n\nMoon pond is a great community AND my great friend Scooter Rizzuto who I met in fourth grade was coming to visit!\n\nLike most men……who have lifelong pals visit………..\n\ndrunkenness became the rule of the day. Our male pride shone brightly as we golfed each day and skidded into nightfall in a Bullet Bourbon fueled perception of euphoria unaware of our simpleminded sophomoric behavior. Without wives present to remind us that we were no longer skinny 20 something’s, that we are on downhill side of the lifespan equator and we should act….or at least try and act like adults….we behaved like each day was our last and we strangled each ounce of joy out of every second……..so basically we were shitfaced for 4 days.\n\nI’m not sure if I was happier to see Scooter arrive or depart Moon Pond…..I know my liver breathed sigh of relief as he trodded down the walk into Sky harbor airport.\n\nI’ve tried to wax eloquent in the past about lifelong friends with what I’d guess is limited success based on my remedial skills as a scribe , but Your friend (s) from 1969 are second only to your wonderful wife in their ability to finish sentences for you and make you feel comfortable and satisfied with life in each moment of each day. The only thing that grade school chums are better at than loving soulmates is their ability to not mention that your feet stink, that you might wanna wear a different shirt today, and they never say…….”you’re not having another beer are you”?\n\nI counted the days for Karens return from snowy wyoming ,my lonely heart supplanted by the shear horror that I needed to clean the entire house and take a pickup load of liquor bottles to the landfill before her arrival and discovery of Scooter and my unabashed teenage behavior!!!!\n\nMost men or perhaps just me…….don’t realize how much your mate/wife means to you until you are alone in an empty house……and you turn to comment on how utterly stupid “this Netflix move is” and there is no one there…..or you make her cup of coffee and set out her iPad and phone at her place at the table for her arrival from slumber…..only to realize……you are a moron…….she in not here….she is interfacing with adults who it just so happens , are not morons….many states away.\n\nBuy your wife some flowers……do the wash…….run the vacuum……but above all let her know that she is everything……..because without her….you are not your best you and perhaps much less\n\nGod Only Knows”\n\nI may not always love you\n\nBut long as there are stars above you\n\nYou never need to doubt it\n\nI’ll make you so sure about it\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nIf you should ever leave me\n\nThough life would still go on believe me\n\nThe world could show nothing to me\n\nSo what good would living do me\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nIf you should ever leave me\n\nWell life would still go on believe me\n\nThe world could show nothing to me\n\nSo what good would living do me\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nGod only knows\n\nGod only knows what I’d be without you\n\nFrom The Beach Boys album Pet Sounds 1966\n\n* Jeremy by Pearl Jam 1991 from the album Ten\n\nAs many of my……..well……both followers know, Karen and I AND the twins Etta and Otis escape our beloved Wyoming each fall in search of warmer weather and a virtually wind free environment . Warmer weather is achievable…..but short of outer space….wind free does not exist ….it blows everywhere\n\nOur first week back was chalked full of engrossing tasks like scrubbing toilets and washing windows……….using a leaf blower to try and wrangle…….well….leaves. Apparently the whole leaf blower goal is to try and get them in the neighbors yard…..I’ve been an utter failure at this as being a Wyoming boy….we rely on the WIND!\n\nI got nothing to complain about….we are very lucky that Karen worked hard enough to allow us to be in a snowbird situation……….as I’ve mentioned before I’d be living under a bridge if not for Karen…….I’m pretty sure it would be somewhere warm however.\n\nI chomped at the bit to get back to the golf course with all the guys of the Dirty Dozen…..or the “Club” as some call it. But we had other pressing matters to attend to.\n\nLike a hail damaged roof and damaged house paint\n\nYou can just image my glee when the adjuster told me “what hail damage”? “ I understand the roofer says your roof is totaled and your painters bids reflect a trashed paint job but piss off”!!\n\nI understand that insurance companies are in business to make money BUT COME ON MAN!\n\nWe combated our frustration by going camping for a few days over by Florence Az. We love camping in the fifth wheel, it resembles camping about as much as my golf swing …resembles………well…….a golf swing.\n\nYa got hot water, shower, flush shitter, forced air heat, electric fireplace, big screen TV, stereo inside and out,electric mattress pad, microwave ,four burner stove and convention oven, heated massaging recliners AND two filthy dogs.\n\nIt’s a far cry from passing out on a blue tarp wearing every stitch of clothing you own and brushing your teeth with left over beer in the morning\n\nIt sure is great that we can camp during the week now that we are retired! After a few days of drinking in lawn chairs, eating grilled burger, steaks ETC……removing cactus from the dogs mouths,feet,tails, hind quarters and ears while drinking we headed back to Moon Pond\n\nMoon Pond being a 55+ community is a cornucopia of humanity….a representation of the populous of our fine nation. For some unknown reason these types of community’s contain a much higher concentration of petty small minded busy bodies . Now dont get me wrong we have the most wonderful neighbors , golf buddies and friends. But the HOA is quite foreign to us being from Wyoming, where you can walk around with a gun on your hip and no one even notices and a Henry golden boy in your pick ups rear window.\n\nPiss off the porch at midnight, drink beer in the driveway all afternoon……you get the idea…….we’re not use to all this structure and the people who deliver it!\n\nDon’t get me wrong….I understand how quickly a place like Moon Pond could circle the shitter if not for the HOA….. but when we can hear the neighbor lady\n\non her porch ,cell in hand calling “The Patrol” to rat us off because our fifth wheel has been parked in front of the house for 17 seconds while unloading from the “camping “ trip……I get my skivvies in a knot\n\nBut it really is no big deal, the neighbor gets some entertainment is perhaps a lonely existence and we have 48 hours to move the RV when we never need more than 12.\n\nAfter stowing the Mc 5er in the RV lot it was off to the golf course while Karen put away all our gear ,food,electronics,did laundry,vacuumed the house washed and brushed dogs,cleaned dog ear canals and perhaps got to read her book for 30 minutes.\n\nI was excited to be paired with a fellow nicknamed “The strong silent type” I guess because he doesn’t have much to say most times. On the 3rd or 4th hole old Ricky shanked one golf shot 90 degrees off line and drilled me in the cranium! The ball came at me with the speed of a politician scrambling to a microphone to say something unintelligible.\n\nIt looked to be about the size of a large cantaloupe as it impacted my ample forehead!Fortunately I have very thick skull as proven buy my inability to understand even the simplest of commands……..Like Rickies shout of Look the fu*k out!!!!!!\n\nI picked myself up off the fairway and we had shot of Fireball in celebration of avoiding a ER visit. You see these old guys dont mess around……..you get birdie…..its a shot……you get a par its a shot……you hit someone with a golfball …its a shot….the sun comes up…….shot.\n\nWe had a good laugh until a few holes later when I hit a shot so bad it looked like me trying to pass the SAT’s in the 70’s….It went dead right, right into the spine of Mike , one of the “Clubs”ringleaders. After expressing his wonderment at my horrific golf game…..Mike suggested a shot of his very own Fireball laced concoction, which near as I can ascertain contains Fireball, vodka, rum, Black Velvet , motor oil and Crown ,he calls it Paralysis Juice. I think I’m gonna take a little break from golf….\n\nThe days flew by as we basked in the sunshine of Moon Pond…happy for our good fortune to be here. We prepared for Karens departure to Casper for the holidays by Karen cooking nonstop to stockpile “bachelor food” for me …..while also compiling a checklist for me to assure my safety in her absence. I believe this was more for the safety of the dogs…as the long Santa like list headlined with FEED THE DOGS and don’t be a complete drunkard.\n\nOnce Karen was safely snuggled in the bosom of her family, in Caspers -40 degrees weather complete with frozen water pipes and car doors, the dogs and I stuck out on a camping trip back to the AZ desert.\n\nThe idiocy of this adventure is rivaled only by Nancy Pelosi explaining that we need more non fossil fuels like natural gas.\n\nThe dogs undeterred by the incompetence of their master patiently paced the house and garage as I loaded the Mc5er with supplies. Now normally Karen is in charge of supplies,as I’m incapable of remembering even the most basic necessities…like dog food…people food ETC.\n\nAfter loading a case of rum and 30 pack of Coors Light we began our adventure. 10 miles out I remember the dog food …..sitting forlornly on the garage floor….circling back towards the house I got lost….imagine?\n\nMuch to my chagrin Nancy Neberton the nosy neighbor was glassing the house and Mc5er as we screeched to a halt atop the power box in the front yard.\n\nI scampered into the house to retrieve the 17 items I’d forgotten in an effort to elude the patrols impending arrival.\n\nOnce safely back on the road we discovered that without Karen to guide me I drove right into the construction zone by the local Safeway!!!! The construction zone has been in a state of disarray since approximately the Jurassic period.\n\nThe RV is approximately 9 feet wide …the construction zone “horses” are 9 feet 1 inch apart creating a maze that Lewis and Clark couldn’t traverse.After the light turned green ,I was not surprised when I clipped the first saw horse on the right with the tail of the camper,as it tumbled harmlessly to the right I breathed a sigh of relief while overcorrecting to the left…….the camper fishtailed violently to the left as I again overcorrected. The black water valve impacted two “horses” and sucked them under the camper faster than pro golfer John Daily arriving at the 19th hole\n\nThe Mc 5er rocked like it ran over a VW bug and the “horse” shot out from under the axels like pellets from a rabbit who drank to much last night……….I watch as the “horses” cartwheeled through the air …….praying that it wouldn’t hit the 30 something dude with the beard and manbun texting while driving the leased Volvo behind me. As he daydreamed about his $300 sunglasses and $17.00 401K balance he was quite shocked when the “horse” took out his headlight and peeled the quarter panel open like a can of spam. In an effort to escape I inadvertently clipped one last “horse” as I careened thru the gauntlet. Manbun boy was outside his disabled Volvo by now , blocking traffic feverishly punching his cell , in what I’d suspect was an effort to reach his therapist to confirm nothing was his fault and he was special.\n\nWe traveled quickly toward the 202 as the faint whine of sirens tried to drown out the opening cords of AC/DC’s Highway to Hell playing on the radio………the dogs napped in the back ,dreaming of running wild and I of tonight’s dinner\n\nNo bearded man bun Dufus was injured in the writing of this BS\n\nWhat a romantic and whimsical image a cabin in the mountains brings to mind!\n\nWeeeeeelllllllll………it not all fairy dust and unicorn farts.\n\nThere always seems to be something that needs repaired OR REDONE because I had no idea what I was doing when I originally did the work. Let’s take the electrical wiring for example……..everyone knows including (both) my loyal followers……normal people write a check and hire a person who’s head will not spontaneously combust at the mere uttering of the phrase 3 way switch ! I ,being the frugal……….alright……cheap bastard that I am…did the wiring myself back in 2006. I think BIL Barton did some of the outlets for me…..these are easy to identify as they are the only functioning ones in the cabin. To be fair most of the ones I did, work ,its just they sometime spark or catch on fire when you plug in something or trip the GFI even though they are not on the same circuit as the GFI……not sure how that happens but my complete lack of knowledge regarding proper/safe wiring may be the answer to my confusion\n\nI finally decided to try and REDO the wiring after the last of my outlets melted\n\nAs I’ve mentioned before my upbringing was of meager yet comfortable means……the influence of my mothers constant effort to stretch a dollar….helped form who I am today. This is not to say my mother is to blame for my frugality on steroids, her example was solid old school common sense………I probably took it to some extreme extent due to eating lead based paint off the window sills in my childhood home or drinking from a garden hose or drinking really really cheap beer in high school..………or maybe its YouTube’s fault…………cheap bastards like me gets a false sense of security after watching 50 or 60 videos …….yeah……I got this…….no….. no……ya…..don’t\n\nWe built the cabin with a knee wall foundation which creates the “crawl space”…….near as I can tell the phrase, crawl space is derived from the Latin …Mulgere hircum many believe this translates to “To milk a male goat” this is false….the translation is “ why in the fu*king sh*t did I cheap out and build a bull sh*t fu*king knee wall”\n\nCrawl spaces/knee walls like the appendix, politicians and stupid people really don’t add much value….AND they are a pain in the ass.\n\nKaren looked on with amusement as I suited up for my journey into the “UPSIDE DOWN”AKA the crawl space…….\n\nsafety glasses…check…hoodie cinched up so tight only one goggled eyeball is visible……check…..long pants tucked into work boots complete with gators….check…..2 pairs of work gloves that inhibited movement and manual dexterity to a point that your hands could not be more useless if you clutched a cue ball in each hand…..check………HEY!!! THERE Are SPIDERS AND SHIT DOWN THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND it didn’t help that our friend Rae mentioned that the rattle snakes like cool spaces like crawl spaces during the heat of the day\n\nI approached the crawl space opening with a foreboding reminiscent of the walk I endured as a teen ,from the driveway to the house after pealing the fender off Dads 1965 mustang…….it was a piece of shit but he apparently was unaware of that fact\n\nBut I was determined to tidy up my original attempt at wiring\n\nI struggled for days trying to salvage parts of my earlier work until surrendering and starting over.\n\nAnyone who has worked around breaker boxes marvels at the lid that is engineered to hold itself open……at first glance this is a great idea\n\nBut after walking into this thing 6-8 time the first day….Karen is wondering what all the muffled cursing drifting up from the $%^**&#%#()_&^*)(_)( Crawl space is all about\n\nBy day three\n\nThe leftover staples attached to the floor joist snagged my hat at every turn and left painful ditches in my sparsely follicled dome .\n\nKaren enjoyed the solitude as I trudged off to the crawl space each morning like a weary miner\n\nUntil the GRANDADDY of all collisions withe the breaker box door\n\nAfter Karen patched me up and I apologized to the neighbors 1 1/2 miles away I decided it was time to involve a PRO!!! Our great friends next door,Rae and Larry recommended A fellow named\n\nWith Hauptmann Electrical!\n\nTurned out that Bruno ,the owner was tied up with another matter and sent out a young apprentice……………..When I say young….I MEAN YOUNG!!!!….I explained to the youngster that Karen and I had travel extensively in Mexico and I was very familiar with wiring based on the knowledge I garnered there over a cerveza or 2……welll sometimes 12. He stared at the supply pole I hung\n\nWith a look of……..\n\nI did my best to remain humble\n\nWith that problem solved,I can concentrate on tasks more in line with my skill level!!! Clearing some trees so the fence could be repaired!\n\nAfter a quick tree felling lesson from our good friend Jeff …….I was confident I could drop these trees on a dime……….reflecting back on that moment of confidence……with the benefit of hindsight ………..I was overconfident………truth of the matter is…..I, not unlike the morons in DC had no CLUE what I was doing.\n\nBIL Barton dropped a bunch of trees for us at the beginning of this fence repair project ,he’s kinda a cross between Jeremiah Johnson\n\nMcGyver\n\nAnd the dude from Fresh Prince\n\nNah………he dont dance anywhere near that good.\n\nAnyway, the fence repair was going good……..until\n\nThe neighbor showed up with beer!\n\nAfter a few beers and these homemade cigars he brought we got back to the task at hand………chainsaw work!!! Manly man work!\n\nJeff and I consulted\n\nFortunately for us…..Karen was smart enough to to move herself and the dogs BEFORE Jeff and I fumbled our calculations on the felling of this aspen\n\nKaren suggested I list all motorized tools and equipment I owned on OfferUp……..I suppose the hope is I’ll be a bit less destructive with handsaws.\n\nNot owning a log splitter I borrowed the neighbors AND their splitter! Karen suggested that I be the stacker of the split wood as that appeared to be the safest job for someone of my limited grey matter development.\n\nHaving plenty of trees down and lots of help splitting and stacking made the job go quick\n\nUnfortunately Etta and Otis,in pursuit of the ever elusive and EVIL chippys…….destroyed the wood stack almost as fast as the media can create discourse among the general populace with slanted ,one sided, fact devoid reporting.\n\nBut this is a part of the circle of life…..we stack it…….they destroy it….in a weird way I think I enjoy it almost as much as Etta and Otis….almost\n\nA melancholy slowly takes a toe hold each fall as we complete the wood cutting or any number of the autumn tasks that signal the approach of winter and our migration south. We will miss all our dear friends and family, and also look forward to reuniting with our great friends at Moon Pond. There is comfort in knowing some friends and family may brave the stupidity know as air travel to even come visit us!\n\nWe wont miss\n\nBut we have many great memories to keep us warm on our journey\n\nAs you hopefully recall , we were stuck in Kenora Ontario…a short floatplane ride away from our destination……Maynard Lake Lodge! We had been working on getting to the lodge for what seemed to me like , how long it takes to get to the nearest highway rest stop when you decided you had to pee 50 miles ago.\n\nIt feels like I been on this trip sooo long I don’t even remember where I’m going!!!\n\nAfter we were informed that we had wasted an entire day hanging around the dock…and we wouldn’t be flying anywhere……AND we overheard our fellow “dock lurkers” say they procured the last available hotel room in Kenora!….Pat whipped out his non waterlogged iPad and began the search.\n\nTo be honest I was so discombobulated from all our travel trials and tribulations……..I wasn’t even concerned……….as a long ago coworker was fond of saying…”it is what is is” and I guess , I was at the point of surrender…..which I always felt that saying expressed.\n\nI was feeling a bit down……alright I was whining like a crybaby bastard. Pat said “snap out of it bitch”.\n\nAnd the bastard slapped me!!!\n\nPat: “ I got us TWO ROOMS weenie!!!!Me: cool! No more spooning with you in the car !!!\n\nFINALLY! Some good luck,seemed like everything that could go wrong on this trip has………so Pat securing TWO rooms in this small town is nothing short of miraculous. I convinced Pat that we should join the lawyer dudes that we met for a beer ( or several rum and Coke’s) so off to the Days Inn we went. We ordered cheeseburgers and I a beverage, and felt pretty smug that Pat got us rooms at The Lake View Inn, and the lawyer dudes have a view of the adjacent building……shits starting to turn our way!!\n\nSoon enough we be dining on Maynard lake Lodge surf and turf!\n\nExcited to hopefully be able to fly tomorrow we bid our friends a good night and headed to the Lake View Inn!\n\nAs we pulled up\n\nThe play on the spelling was a bit concerning….but hey, maybe that’s the way the French spell it……The Motel office was in the CO-OP next door……basically a 7-11\n\nA motel office that is housed in a 7-11 has warning sirens going off in your head! Worst yet,there was no office in the 7-11……you dealt with the 7-11 clerk…..like you were buying lotto tickets or drano to make meth in the bathtub of the Lake VU Hotel! Pat and I waited in line once we figured out the motel office was nonexistent. I scanned the store as we waited,doing a diagnostic on each character…..or at least my perception. I like giving them names as I do my little Columbo routine in my cavernous cranium. Tami and Ed over by the beer cooler looked like there was some big time math going on regarding the volume of beer that could be purchased while still staying within the panhandling coffers they’d procured washing windshields at the lone stoplight. Then there was Robert over by the camping supplies (the CO-OP was well supplied) rubbing a hole in his already scabbed up jaw trying to decide if he had enough for the big can of Sterno to secure his place at the bathtub cook.\n\nAnd last but not least,there was Emilio…..in the corner by the head……doing a little head nod at select patrons…..as in meet me in the bathroom……2 or 3 transactions transpired between Emilio and various drug enthusiasts before we got to the clerk\n\nBehind the bulletproof glass our clerk fidgeted and rocked from one foot to the other in some sort of druggie happy dance. We apparently book our accommodations at the crappiest doper magnet in town! We shared a clairvoyant glance that said “it’s cool,we just got to get to the room….without getting knifed,shot or raped.\n\nWe held our keys tight as we hurriedly beat feet across the parking lot. The familiar smells of marijuana,(that I had read about in a book many years ago ) waft across the asphalt,produced by some skeletal looking gnome who scurried into the entrance like a roach seeking the darkness. As we approached the entrance a …..um…woman…offered Pat a warm salutation\n\nI pushed past Pat to the safety of the vestibule as he assured the ….um….woman that he didn’t need any company,didn’t want to party and didn’t have any spare change. Once inside we stood in horror, the hall way rug directly in front of Pats room had a stain…..of undeterminable origin.\n\nWe speculated that it was either vomit or urine…..What was a mystery for the ages was……..was the perpetrator desperately trying to enter the room and didn’t quite make it when the urge overcame them??…or did they hurriedly bail out of the room in an effort to preserve their pristine domicile?\n\nMy imagination ran wild regarding the condition of the interior of the rooms\n\nOr worse yet!\n\nBack to the reality of our abodes…I discovered\n\nApparently some prior boneheaded guest had locked themselves out! Some people are morons.At least I hope it was a locked out guest and not any of the parking lot lurkers trying to gain entry to ….keep you company!!\n\nOtherwise….\n\nEverything appeared clean!!\n\nNow the bathroom\n\nWas another story entirely!!! Guess I’ll be doing the hover after coffee in the morning. Even though the toilet was disgusting………I was surprised it wasn’t worse based on the clientele we had encountered thus far…….especially The …um…women at the front door.\n\nI told Pat to come by my room after he got unpacked and we’d check out the boobtube. While waiting on Pat I inspected the linens to determine if I’d be sleeping atop the sheets or not…..score! As rough as every aspect of this joint is, the bed looked to be spotless,\n\nI took the chair and propped it against the wall above the lone baseboard heater to create a tent and stared hanging all the wet items from my bag that got dunked in the lake by Junior…the dumbass dockhand. I gently placed the keyboard on the chair where the heat would flow up and around it but not too close,my spare skivvies, socks,shirt,passport,proof of cootie vaccination , two hopelessly curled up paperbacks and a $43 peanut butter sandwich from the Calgary airport. This was all I could do….and I was trying to get myself on a more positive vibe, I’m mean…your shit is wet,the keyboard may be toast….we are surrounded by dopers…….and at least one….um….lady..but things are looking up….focus on that! Pats knock at my door snapped me out of it…..letting him in I see he is bearing gifts!! An ice cold Kokane\n\nWhat a pal! While putting his life in danger by going into the CO-OP to get himself a iced frappa hooka lappa danca coffee…Pat was kind enough to grab me a cold one!\n\nPat gave me a bit of shit over my little “tent drying station “…..you’ll be here till next year waiting on that set up to dry he said as I fought the idea of using the bathroom after consuming the Kokane in 3 gulps.\n\nI donned my cootie mask and pulled my hoody up, put on some fishing gloves took a deep breath and ran into the bathroom……the filth won’t get me if I’m quick enough I thought!!\n\nReturning from the can I find Pat sitting there like The Cheshire Cat\n\nComplete with all knowing shit eating grin……”I fixed it for ya, the keyboard, it would never dry like that “. I look over to the baseboard heater and my lifelong friend, a person I’ve been in awe of for 40 years,for his intelligence and problem solving abilities,for his ability to always succeed,at any endeavor , has placed the keyboard directly on the heater! I screamed”are you a moron!”\n\nI raced to the heater as the the first wisps of smoke drifted upward and the familiar smell of burning plastic overcame the mildew odor of the room.\n\nIt’s confirmed Pat, is human……Pat: “maybe I got it too close to the heater??”….I couldn’t be upset…I was pretty sure the thing was toasted anyway….when you typed the letter y , it back spaced until it erased everything you just typed! The chemistry experiment of turning a solid into a semi fluid state completed….we opted to call it a night. I gave Pat my hairbrush for a weapon for his 50 foot trek to the safety of his room and agreed to meet at 6:30 am to head back to the dock.\n\nThe sun began to peak over the horizon\n\nAnd I tried to get a glimpse of the lake VU from my window\n\nI don’t see no lake…do you?\n\nWe gleefully humped our bags to the rental car and extended a salutation to a group of guys next to the car adjacent to ours\n\nI guess they had a fitful nights sleep\n\nWe didn’t care we got the bird for breakfast…..we’d be airborne soon! We rode in silence,each of us inspecting the clearer sky thru the windshield soiled by a light mist. Pat broke the silence as we parked, “we’ll fly for sure this morning “ . We waded up to the hanger as other groups of fishermen rolled in , all of us had chatted,as we spent 7 hours together yesterday. The cat calls started right away “ hey nobody fly in Kelly’s plane,with his luck you’ll crash,hahahaha “ I returned fire with a friendly “piss off” . All the groups were familiar with my air travel troubles as well as the sinking of the iPad and iPhone , so they knew I’d been riding an unlucky streak. We all lined up next to our assigned planes after being weighed again, did they think we were gonna put on 10 pounds overnight?\n\nI saw one of the pilots in the pilots lounge…..where I guess they……lounge before their flight\n\nI was the one to fire off the cat calls to the other group as I saw their pilot walking over to inspect the aircraft\n\nOur pilot Dougie seemed like a capable sort as he gave us preflight instructions\n\n**\n\nIn short order we were on our way, blissful in the deafening engine noise , crammed in the small plane with two other dudes,like high school kids jammed into the car of the only friend with wheels. After30 minutes in the air Pat and I began pointing out familiar landmarks that signaled we were close! Dougie set the plane down on the rippling lake “like a butterfly with sore feet” as Pat likes to say.\n\nAs we approached the dock the owners,guides and kitchen staff lined up to greet us, many familiar faces and some new ones as well! None were smiling……this is odd,very odd. Once we exited the plane….we saw…….the devastation……the lodge! Flattened!\n\nWe cornered our favorite guide Big Fish Larry……..\n\n“what the hell happened” ??\n\nIn my head all I can think about is all we went thru to get here,the extra days of travel the added expenses…and now this!\n\nLarry ushered us to the side, apparently the owners didn’t want a whole lot of details floating about….Larry in a hushed tone: Last night two of the newer guides were blowin a fatty in the privacy of the crawl space\n\nAnd being new to our operation, they were unaware that the propane is stored down there!! Holy crap! Where would we enjoy the wonderful meals?\n\nWhere would we visit with new found friends?\n\nIn the excitement of artistic creation………I may have played fast and loose with the facts here.\n\nWhat really happened was the lake level went up by 15 – 20 feet! To its highest level ever!\n\nThere was a microburst that materialized on the lake and caused 3-4 foot swells coupled with extreme winds…..it destroyed the dock, flattened one of the maintenance buildings at the dock,and threw several boats against the rocks, putting football sized hole in them! This all transpired in a ferocious 30 minute span 2 days before we arrived!The effort and determination displayed by Josh and Kayla the owners, and all the staff was truly amazing. Our trip was impacted 0% by the financial ,operational and I’d assume emotional devastation that the lodge experienced.\n\nVery impressive!!\n\nThe fishing was excellent!\n\nWe had a blast smokin cigars, drinking beer, walking around in our skivvies fartin and catching fish!!\n\nMaynard Lake Lodge never disappoints, give them a try! I’d recommend driving there though, sometimes there can be problems with air travel.\n\nNo one was injured in the mythical propane blast nor the microburst…..although I’m sure someone somewhere has hurt feelings.\n\n* The End by the Doors.

Written by Jim Morrison,Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore.\n\n** Oliver Douglas from the 1960’s sitcom Green Acres\n\nPat and I awoke at 5 am……wellll…I awoke and showered,Pat slept and begged for 2 more minutes “just two more minutes”… like a teenager who can not fathom rising before brunch is served. This has been our M.O. for 40+ years on these annual fishing trips…I rise with the sun and can’t stay up past 9 pm and…..Pat is not a morning person EVER!\n\nPat eventually jumped…..crawled outta bed…..and we happily loaded gear bags in the car all the while clutching the room key in a vice like grip. We had a brighter attitude after 3 solid hours of sleep\n\nand were ripe with anticipation for our floatplane ride into walleye and small mouth bass rapture!!\n\nWe were happily unaware of the low sky and persistent drizzle as we made our way to Tim Hortons , a wonderful coffee ,donut shop…loved by all Canadians and visitors as well!\n\nThe rain seemed to pick up?\n\n“Those windshield wipers\n\nslapping out a tempo\n\nKeepin time with the song on the radio.”*\n\nWe rolled into the Tim Horton drive thru only to discover that the Delta customer service agent that Karen schooled way back at the beginning of this trip was working there as well!! The Charlie Brown like voice came from the tinny sounding speaker in an inaudible and unintelligible cascade of sounds with a cadence meant to imitate the kings English\n\nPat ordered some sort of latte jimmy-juinka- frap-a something or another with 1/3 half and half……..WTF! I thought we were ordering coffee?.?? I could tell by the accent and confusion by the drive up person that they were new and they were not native Canadian so in an effort to assure my order was correct,I ordered a small black coffee . After Pat repeated the order 3 times and the drive up person responded with some kinda Klingon dialect……Pat just responded yes at every pause. Being old and extremely deaf, I had no clue what the drive up gal was asking….but there was one thing I was certain of…….our order would be FUBAR.\n\nAs we watched, the car in front of us at the window was in some kinda heated exchange! Just then a large Tim Horton double double came flying out the drive up all over the driver and car!\n\nAnd then!\n\nThese Canadians are serious about their Tim Horton double doubles!**\n\nPat and I were somewhat apprehensive about moving up to the window once the debate was completed, but we forged ahead!\n\nAs expected ,Pats order of a jimmy-juinka-frappa with 1/3 half and half arrived as a small black coffee 2/3’s full…….instead of 1/3 half and half, Pat got 1/3 oxygen ….the crown jewel of the experience was his toasted bagel and cream cheese……which appeared to be a stale untoasted bagel with unmelted Kraft cheese and some creamer drizzled on top…resulting in a bagel that resembled a wet dish rag. Pat politely mentioned that the order was a bit off…….and the drive – up gal responded:\n\nPat demanded to see her supervisor….and we got\n\nI begged Pat to just go…just drive…..Pat is not a personality that surrenders easily…..but even Pat knew there was little sense in engaging with these clowns.\n\nI added a little Saint Brendons Irish Cream from my flask into my black coffee as we pulled into traffic….. my coffee was perfect!!…it was at this moment that we both realized the weather may impact our departure time!\n\nWe headed to the dock trying to ignore the pelting rain and ferocious wind\n\nThe dock was almost unrecognizable………as it was underwater!!!\n\nThe owner of River Air proclaimed “ we might have to wait for a window before we can takeoff but let’s get your gear on the carts” the young deckhand materialized with a flat cart with big tires to keep our shit dry as he wheeled it thru the 8” of lake water on the dock. Docks are supposed to be ON TOP of the water…not riding below! Just as this revelation skidded in and out of my feeble brain…..Junior the deck hand runs the cart into the side of the ramp leading into the “hanger” and the waiting scale….several gear bags topple into the drink……I internally chuckle…..until I notice MY backpack SUBMERGED!! Juniors demeanor and associated level of urgency did not fit this particular situation!! I holler “my bag my bag!” He gives me the look given by youngsters since the dawn of mankind\n\nHe lazily sloshes his way across the dock toward me , the water pouring out of my bag!\n\nHe looks at his submerged boots and silently hands me the bag…no “sorry sir” not even a lame “my bad dude” . I could have strangled him if he wasn’t so young….and I so old…bastard.\n\nDuncan’s shout snapped me out of my rage “your iPad and phone”!!!! I dumped the contents and a gallon of water on an empty cart inside the hanger as Pat scrambled for paper towels.I glared over at junior who pretended to busy himself with weighing the cart and our gear while avoiding eye contact….bastard! Pat feverishly dabbed at the electronics as I shook out my passport, COOTIE vaccination card and other sopping wet shit.\n\nI had to laugh, what a trip this has been,not certain but I think it took me 3 days to get to Kenora Ontario, and I could have driven here in ~16 hours….and now junior put a cherry on top of the whole cluster f*ck by dropping all my electronics and other important shit in the lake! I told Pat “I need a drink” Pat : “it’s 8 am” Me : “oh, my bad dude”. We agreed on a cup of coffee at a NON Tim Hortons coffee shop across the street. After a nice hot cup of correctly prepared coffee we bummed a ride to Wal-mart with some fellow fishermen who were lawyer dudes and like us ,were in search of rubber boots and praying the rain would stop so we all could get on with catching fish, smokin cigars,farting and walking around in our skivvies .\n\nThe lawyer dudes had been going on an annual fishing trip for 40 years and were great friends…..this was apparent by the banter and interaction that transpired on the return trip from Walmart.\n\nBud: turn here turn here, Michael turn here!! Michael I know,I know Bud:well it sure as hell didn’t look like you knew what the f**kin sh*t you were doing ,you dipsh*t a** hole! Michael : how about I pull this van over and kick the fu*kin sh*t our of your worthless p*ssy a**? Bud: I swore I was done fishing with your dumb ass,you f*cker…………….you wanna beer? Michael: sure Bud,thanks Pat : ITS 9:45!! Everyone in the van : Shut-up Pat!!\n\nOnce back at the dock we waited around for what seemed like 7 hours and…..in fact, it was 7 hours… and the pilot finally “called it” no flights today! Lucky Us,ANOTHER CANCELLATION!!! By this time there were almost two dozen fisherman milling about the dock in various states of …….this sucks. Pat and I overheard the lawyers saying they were going to the BAR!! Pat reminded me that we needed to book a hotel before I could get knee deep in the Rum! Michael overhead our exchange and announced “I think we got the last room in Kenora”\n\nHOLY SHIT!!!\n\n* Drivin my life away by Eddie Rabbit, 1980\n\n** a Tim Horton double double is two creams two sugars…I think\n\nThis blog is dedicated to my great friend Irina who’s capacity for patience is similar to mine\n\nAs you may have read,Pat and I managed to lock ourselves out of a perfectly good hotel room in the small town of Kenora Ontario at 1am!!The small 15 unit inn had no overnight desk clerk and the office didn’t even reopen till 11 am! We were in a panic but Pat did a good job of pretending it was a group effort even though I’m the one who pulled the door closed. After several calls to the front desk number that went to voicemail cheerily reporting that they’d return at 11 am we decided that we’d be sleeping in the car….AGAIN!!!\n\nAfter yanking on the doorknob 23 times trying to get it to magically open and or reassure my very small brain that it was in fact locked and I’d not be picking it with a paper clip like Jack Reacher anytime soon….\n\nwe made our way to the rental car. I could tell Pat was a bit miffed, I had after all , with the help of Delta been the cause of all of our delays in varying degrees. Pat being the wonderful friend that he is, assured me that we’d get to fish camp eventually. I silently wondered if that arrival would be just in time for our departure from Maynard lake lodge.\n\nWe both tossed and turned for 20 minutes but it felt like 10 hours…..you know how it is when you are begging to fall asleep and it won’t happen .Your brain screams “I only have 3 hours until I have get up ! PLEASE!!\n\nOf course rising early wouldn’t be in play if we can’t get in that damn room. I heard Pat tap tap tapping on his phone and wondered if he was googling “how to strangle your fishing buddy in his sleep and get away with it“. Then! I heard Pats phone ringing an outbound call.???\n\n“Big Brian’s Locksmith how can we help” ……holy shit! Pat is a genius!!! ….made me wonder why I didn’ think of calling a locksmith….but then I remembered I wasn’t even smart enough to pick up the keys when we left the room.\n\nTurned out to be an answering service…but they said they’d contact the person on call…..YES YES YES!! Pat and I waited for an eternity..or 15 minutes before we got the call back from Big Brian……..he didn’t seem particularly impressed that we interrupted his sleep pattern with our tale of stupidity . But Pat and I were more excited than an 8 year old on Christmas Eve!!!\n\nThen the thunderbolt! “ I’m really not legally allowed to open that room because I know you’re not the owner” BUT my hero Pat was on it like the third monkey tryin to get on the Arc. Pat laid the smooth on this dude like a guy trying to fill his dance card at closing time. “Well my passport , reservation confirmation and all my belongings are in that room so I can assure you this is on the up and up” Every time Big Brian came up with something Pat did the\n\nBegrudgingly Brig Brian agreed to get dressed and meet us at the inn in 20 minutes!!We we’re ecstatic, but also fearful that B.B. might waffle once he arrived. Pat: “ stay in the car and let me do the talkin, I don’t want you scaring Big Brian off, you kinda project shady “ Me thinking: that ain’t very nice, accurate perhaps but not very nice, but I don’t care as I’d be willing to be thrown down a flight of stairs,or chaperone teenagers on an overnight trip or sing karaoke in a crowded pub full of strangers if that would get us in that room and eventually on the floatplane .\n\nPat jumped out of the car as B.B. slid into the gravel lot next to us. Pat, who I love dearly …..is full of shit as a Christmas goose.He’s charismatic, he’s a smiling friendly sort who exudes confidence and those pearly whites and firm hand shake put people at ease\n\nBut tonight I was happy he was full of it…Big Brian never had a chance….as a matter of fact Big Brian was thanking Pat for the walleye tackle tips as he was loading his tool bag into the truck . It took B.B. about 12 seconds to get the door open, and in that time Pat was able to have Brian silently wondering ………Pat would make a great godfather,I wonder if he’d consider it?\n\nWe bid B.B. a good rest of his night and promised not to have\n\nAnymore tonight\n\nPat and I leapt for joy at the thought of make our plane!\n\nEven with Brians parting comment that the charge was $ 192 + tax Canadian!\n\nI did a swift mental calculation and ascertained our cost was roughly $125 US or $1,920.00 US……theses foreign currency exchange calculations are extremely involved .\n\nThe cost mattered not as the trip from hell was moving forward! The only remaining question…….what else could possibly go wrong?\n\nThanks Delta, you suck, after finally getting to Denver in only twice as long as it would have taken me to drive,I was greeted with a delay on my flight to CalGary…this after a two hour layover…then another delay and for the coup de grace! Every travelers friend !\n\nThe Flight CANCELATION!!!!!!!\n\nThe unified groan from the passengers crowded about the gate was audible 3 gates in each direction. It was also announced that we’d be auto booked on tomorrow’s 9 am flight to Calgary and we should gather baggage and head over to ticketing for any questions .\n\nOnce I arrive at the ticketing area I notice I was at the back of the line….GREAT. The line was a full swing of a lob wedge that is perfectly skulled ….. so a good 100 yards. For you non golfers when you “skull” a shot you incorrectly hit the center of the ball with the edge of the club instead of the face….this almost always results in the ball traveling considerably farther than intended…..like the parking lot for example, don’t ask me how I acquired this knowledge.\n\nThe lone ticket agent retreated to the back after her interaction with the first couple in line, perhaps it was the rather loud “this is f**king bull shit”comment…but I could be wrong. The agents seems to be “hiding” in the back, after a few moments the cat calls started….:hey get out hear and give us some answers”!! That was the politest comment. A chant began…slowly at first and then louder as the crowd grew into a bit of a frenzy!\n\nSeconds before the crowd looked to rush the counter like a Who concert in Cincinnati in 1979 …an agent burst from the back and leapt onto the counter like BRUCE Jenner in 1976\n\nAfter announcing that West Jet , as a contractor of Delta (who suck by the way) would not be paying for lodging or anything else for that matter and everyone could kiss her ass…she dismounted the counter\n\nonly to suffer an injury!!!! her coworker in a heroic move scooped her up\n\nand scurried into the safety of the back office! A few more profane cat calls were heard as the crowd dispersed in search of overpriced food and lodging.Some in the group,like myself felt defeated and struggled with the insanity of doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results\n\nAfter calling and relaying my continued struggles in the battle with Delta and Sky West to Karen on the phone I thought I detected a snicker?\n\nI suppose the situation would be funny in a surreal and unbelievable way if you weren’t the victim\n\ncontemplating surrender aloud to Pat who was already in Winnipeg, he responded with an eloquent but brief speech\n\nEnding with “stop being a p*ssy and get your ass to Canada”\n\nFeeling newly energized by Pats admonishment I set off to my hotel with laser focus on success!! After a dinner of micro chicken wings that looked like they came off of Cornish game hens and 14 rum and Coke’s For the low low price of $112 I stumbled to bed in my $163 room procured by my lovely wife.After a restful nights sleep of 2 hours and 34 minutes I headed to the airport for my 9 am flight. The bastards delayed it until 10:30! I was lucky enough to get the FNG ticket agent,who had no idea what he was doing….\n\n“ I’ve booked your bag all the way to Toronto sir” No no no! I’m going to Winnipeg!! Fortunately the lead agent got it fixed before I strangled the guy\n\nI arrived in Winnipeg and found Pat,a short 2 hour drive and we were in Kenora at a nice inn. We unloaded our bags in the room and headed back to clean out the rest of our debris in the car. Upon our return Pat said “you got the keys?” “No I aint got the keys”\n\n“What do you mean you ain’t got the key?” We were locked out of our $200 room with 90% of our gear inside! And to further the pain the desk was unmanned until 11 am the next day, 3 1/2 hours after our float plane was scheduled to leave!\n\nTo be continued\n\nI didn’t break anybody’s heart but I did book air travel again! Air travel is a necessary evil of life, like digital exams and being run over by a car. My good friend Pat and I have been waiting to return to Canada for our annual fishing trip since 2019….THANKS A LOT COOTIE EPIDEMIC !!!\n\nWith passage of time we forget the high level of frustration and pain that is todays air travel….this is apparently especially true in the male of the species,we don’t remember shit.\n\nLittle did I know that Delta airlines was more than up for the challenge and chomping at the bit to get me more wound up than a three dollar watch.\n\nI awoke at 4 am….an hour earlier than planned ,I wish I could say because I was amped up about catching fish ….one right after another, and drinking beer and smokin cigars and walking around in nothing but my briefs and farting a lot . Now I don’t know about you but my wife told me a long time ago that, shirtless undie parades were not permitted, NEIN , No NAY!!!! I think maybe she got a little bit of that stomach bile you get in the back of your throat ,like maybe when you have acid reflux or like when …..ya puke. But I wasn’t amped up about the joys of the catching VERY LARGE FISH!!! I was amped up like when you started your first day of Jr High and you’d heard all the stories of dudes getting depants and their 501’s getting run up the school yard flag pole. Or the fact that I was now going to be in the same building with my nemesis Scott Farkus!!!!! Farkus had been bulling me since the beginning of time or so it felt. But alas I just traveling on Delta! Who slogan oddly enough is Keep Climbing ….as in…..keep climbing till the window you jump out of is high enough that the fall will kill ya.\n\nI bid my lovely wife goodbye and petted our well behaved dogs\n\nI was greeted with a long line at check in after the kiosk refused to cooperate . The nice young lady at the counter told me my reservation was for the 30th…not the 29th………no no no!!! I have 14 emails and texts messages from Delta showing the correct itinerary!!! I swivels my device for her to see as she did the same…..like two chickens pecking in a barnyard, head up head down…….see lady? …see Mister?\n\nHer death blow was not a right hand to the throat……but just a simple phrase that strikes fear into the hearts of customers everywhere!!! “You’ll need to call customer service”\n\nI shelped my bag to the exit unaware of the superhuman level of stupidity I was about to go toe to toe with. The automated voice hell of Customer Service told us that our wait time was only 1 hour and 34 minutes!! I went with the call back option and after 1 hour and 33 minutes we received a callback and were immediately put on hold, 12 minutes later, a voice came on …with some kind of unknown accent and poor enunciation…..I’m deaf…I wear hearing aids….and they help only a little AND make ya look old ……so I cant understand her and I cant hear her either….I glance at Karen with a defeated look, she shoots back a “watch this buster” look. Karen got the rep off balance and on the ropes right away\n\nbut she was a formidable foe of limited vocabulary, that consisted of I’m sorry and NO…..Karen’s relentless pounding took a toll on the rep and after 49 minutes…it was over\n\nI was rebooked and on my way!!!!Or was I???????"
