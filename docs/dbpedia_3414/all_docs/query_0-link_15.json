Originally only available as a 2-CD set including a Radio 1 John Peel session, only a handful of copies made their way over to the UK on import. Bustin + Dronin has never been available on vinyl before now, and this release features the nine remixes (note: no Peel Session) by William Orbit (tracks 1, 6, 7 & 9), Adrian Sherwood (2 & 8), Moby (4), Thurston Moore (5) and John McEntire (7). Released on two x heavyweight coloured vinyl LPs - 1 x transparent blue, 1 x transparent green, the sleeve comes with an adapted version of the original Japanese OBI strip and replica insert.\n\nDave Brubeck Trio - Live from Vienna 1967 is an extremely rare, red-hot performance by Dave and his famous rhythm section -- Joe Morello, on drums, and Gene Wright on bass. Alto saxophonist, Paul Desmond, missed the plane to Vienna and the remaining trio took the stage with a mission; show the packed hall that the three of them could play up a storm despite being one man down. Each musician in the trio was at the top of their game and each player was forced to stretch out their solos which landed them in new creative territories. The communication of musical concepts between Dave and Joe is extraordinary as they improvise boldly and respond to each other's fresh ideas. Gene Wright solos far more than usual on this album and his playing is a fitting tribute to the longest living member of the Quartet. (Gene died on December 30th, 2020.) Dave Brubeck plays masterfully revealing a rhythmic complexity to his approach on the piano that is remarkable and reminds the listener of his extremely inventive approach to jazz improvisations. Harmonically, he also explores polytonality in the most unexpected places; for example, on the ballad \"La Paloma Azul.\" On \"Swanee River\" Dave is playfully polyrhythmic. Dave's light touch on \"One Moment Worth Years\" is charming and gives a nod to the great more traditional pianists who went before him. On this great-sounding recording, you can hear the full breadth of Dave's playing which pushes jazz forward while honoring his past influences. Opening with \"St. Louis Blues,\" the set includes the rhythmically challenging, high-spirited \"Someday My Prince Will Come,\" and ends with \"Take the A Train\" as an encore. This is a thrilling set! The sound is wonderful and listening to this album will make you feel as if you were sitting in the audience that historic night.\n\nSide A\n\n1. St. Louis Blues\n\n2.

After releasing their 1995 debut, Do You Feel at Home?, the Omaha indie rockers caught the attention of Wind-up Records, who backed the groups sophomore album, The Uneventful Vacation. While The Uneventful Vacation marked the musicians final record together, before they each embarked on their next ventures, this formative album has since become a cult favorite in the 90s emo canon. This 25th Anniversary Edition is pressed on Red & Black Smoke vinyl with all-analog mastering from the original tapes by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio. It also includes the bonus track, Congratulations! which appeared on the original vinyl release.\n\nSide A:\n\n1. Jean's T.V.\n\n2. Refused By Light\n\n3. We'll Always Have Paris\n\n4.

That accounts for a little under half of this 15-track collection. The rest is made up of selections from the 2000 live album Rock Bottom: Live at the Bottom Line (four tracks) and 2002's studio album Bug (two cuts), plus a couple of relative rarities -- \"When the Wind Blows (Emergency),\" which was written for the End Hunger Network in 1997, and a cover of George Harrison's \"Give Me Love, Give Me Peace on Earth,\" which was for a 2003 Harrison tribute album -- and a brand new tune, \"God in My Brain,\" which was written and recorded in 2006, after Davies recovered from a serious stroke.\n\n1.

Recorded just months before her untimely death in 1978, this special release attempts to present the record that Sandy might have released had she lived. The concert features a career-spanning set that includes songs taken from her band Fotheringay, Sandys solo albums (The North Star Grassman and the Ravens, Sandy, and Rendezvous), as well as her work with Fairport Convention on the albums Unhalfbricking and Rising for the Moon. This final performance perfectly captures the folk-rock sound with a stellar group of musicians including Trevor Lucas, Jerry Donahue, Pat Donaldson, Dave Mattacks, among others. It showcases the quality of Sandys songwriting throughout her career and includes her signature composition, Who Knows Where the Time Goes?  which was the first song she ever wrote  and No More Sad Refrains which closed her final album. Remastered from the restored tapes, this release features Sandys spoken introductions to each song, comprehensive sleeve notes, and brand-new artwork designed specifically for this release.\n\nSide A:\n\n1.

This very rare and sought-after 1968 album from the legendary British singer/songwriter was only released in the U.S. and over the years its reputation among collectors has only grown. Although it never came out in England, Decca Records kept the masters to the intended U.K. pressing which is now being released on vinyl. It contains two previously unreleased, self-penned tracks  the blue-eyed soul bop Goin Round in Circles and the orchestral Come to My Arms which could almost have been a Bond theme.\n\nSide A:\n\n1.

With topics ranging from his experience as a new father, partner, and son to drug addiciton in the family, as well as his own personal struggles and triumphs, The Grouch succeeds in showing us his world. At 16 tracks, the album features appearances from Murs, Bicasso, Scarub, Mike Marshall, Raphael Saadiq, Abstract Rude, Marty James, & One Block Radius, and is best known for the hit singles, \"Artsy,\" \"The Bay To LA,\" &\"Breath.\"\n\n1.

Born from a radio edit for a DJ set in 2015, the title was an immediate and dazzling success, with more than 60M streams. The music video was released a year later, showing a game of tennis on a sunny day and reached 10M views in 2021. This release follows their second album Tako Tsubo in March 2021 and arrives at a perfect time : the band's first appearance at Coachella Festival and their second full US tour.\n\nA.

The album incorporated the work of several other musicians, including Michael Falzarano, who had joined Hot Tuna at the time. This deluxe package includes an OBI strip, gatefold album jacket, printed inner sleeve, orginial record labels and hazed-gold-and-black-effect color vinyl.\n\nRe-Enlisment Blues | Trial by Fire | Do Not Go Gentle | From the Land of Heroes | It's a God Almighty World | Follow the Drinking Gourd | Banks of the River | Judge, I'm Not Sorry | Dark Trian | Have More Faith in Jesus\n\nLa Luz - The Instrumentals is a fully instrumental version of La Luz's self-titled 2021 album. Produced by Adrian Younge - renowned for his work with Ghostface Killah, Kendrick Lamar, and many more - The Instrumentals offers a uniquely atmospheric way to re-experience the ghostly electric guitar shimmers, charging fuzz-guitar rock, soulful organ-driven dream-funk, galactic synths, and breezy 70s folk-pop of the album. On aqua/natural-swirl vinyl, and limited to 2200 copies worldwide.\n\n\"Fun fact: we played at least twice as many instruments on our new album La Luz than we have on any album before! These instrumental mixes pull back the curtain to reveal the sonic landscape of the songs in all their beautiful stereophonic 3-D glory. Each track is its own living realm that were inviting you to step inside and explore. Hum your own melody, write your own words, lie down in a field of poppies while an orchestra of light dances behind your eyelids\"  Shana Cleveland, La Luz\n\n\"This instrumental album truly represents the core of this incredible trio. Omit the vocal and the listener gets a behind the scenes look into their indelible minds.

Originally released in 1999, the album contains the international hit singles Never Be the Same and I Turn to You, and features productions by legendary producers Rick Rubin and William Orbit. Never-before released on vinyl, this 2LP set comes with an etching of Melanies iconic Northern Star pose on Side D, plus three bonus tracks: Northern Star (Single Mix), I Turn to You (Hex Hector Mix) which won Hex Hector a GRAMMY for Best Remixer in 2001, and Follow Me which was co-written with Bryan Adams.\n\nSide A:\n\n1.

Overkill\n\nRecorded over the course of two nights in 1974, just a few months after Phases and Stages was released, these early concerts by the newly-minted Willie Nelson Family Band were meant to capture the sound and feel of the burgeoning Outlaw Country scene in Austin, TX. Produced by Jerry Wexler, the album was scrapped at the time and was only released on CD in 1992 and in this complete form in 2006 on the The Complete Atlantic Sessions. The set captures a rising star twelve years in the making, whose fame and fortune lurked just around the corner.\n\nThis Record Store Day release marks its first time on vinyl.\n\nHaving appeared in La Dolca Vita before joining The Velvet Underground in New York in the mid-60s, Nico seemed to be at the epicentre of all that was cool in the 60s. And she continued that trend by relocating to Manchester in the 80s for a career renaissance before her death in 1988. This record immortalises her performance at The Hacienda, Manchester, in 1983. This deluxe package includes an OBI strip, single album jacket, printed inner sleeve, record labels and crystal clear purple vinyl.\n\nOne More Chance | Saeta | My Heart Is Empty | Sixty Forty | Janitor Of Lunacy | Valley Of The King | Vegas | Purple Lips | All Tomorrows Parties | Tananore | Femme Fatale | Afraid | The End\n\nScotlands The Proclaimers were originally formed in 1983 by twin brothers Charlie and Craig Reid. Their folk-rock sound made an instant impact with their 1987 debut, This Is The Story. Wasting no time, their follow-up, Sunshine On Leith, was released in 1988. Kicking off with the hit single Im Gonna Be (500 Miles), not only would the album become a huge worldwide success, it would also inspire a stage musical of the same name.\n\nThis expanded 2LP version of Sunshine on Leith includes a vinyl side of rarities, including non-album tracks from their King Of The Road EP, plus another side of sessions recorded for the BBC. (Im Gonna) Burn Your Playhouse from their 1989 Glastonbury performance acts as a fitting finale to this marbled black, white and green vinyl set\n\nIn the mid-2000s, as Prodigy began to map out the follow-up to his solo release H.N.I.C., he worked up some new material with long-time collaborator The Alchemist. It was material that was meant to be a mixtape, just a little something to keep the fans interested until H.N.I.C. Part 2. The resulting recordings were so high caliber, so tapped into the very essence of Prodigys Mobb Deep pedigree, just so damn good - that a commercial release of the material was inevitable  as Return Of The Mac. Backed by classic Blaxploitation style samples from The Alchemist, Prodigy paints a picture with his words. A picture of the rough and tumble New York of his up-bringing. When issued in 2007, many considered it his best effort in at least a decade. In their review of the then new release, even Pitchfork had to admit Prodigy's made the comeback no one saw coming. Fans agreed with that assessment, their whole-hearted embrace of Return Of The Mac placed the title at #32 on the Billboard Top 200.\n\nNow released on vinyl for the first time ever, the opaque red pressing is housed in a gatefold jacket, and is exclusive to RSD 2022.\n\nA Side\n\n1.

With the single, Jeannie C. Riley became the first woman with a number one hit on both the Billboard Pop and Country charts. Riley is at her best throughout the album, bringing her unique sass, wit, and vulnerability to each performance. Originally released in 1968, the album has been out of print since the 1970s. Its finally coming back to vinyl with a limited edition color vinyl pressing, exclusively for Record Store Day 2022. This limited edition pressing includes new liner notes from Jeannie C.

At the time of release, the influential New York Rocker declared the album, The best pop album of the decade.\n\nYep Roc Records is proud to be reissuing this classic album on limited edition translucent yellow vinyl (in homage to Beserkley Records)!\n\nSide 1\n\n1. \"I Think We're Alone Now\"\n\n2. \"Leave My Heart Alone\"\n\n3. \"Hard to Get\"\n\n4. \"Peek-A-Boo\"\n\n5. \"Rock and Roll is Dead\"\n\nSide 2\n\n1. \"Memories\"\n\n2. \"Nothing a Little Love Won't Cure\"\n\n3. \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\"\n\n4. \"Make It Easy\"\n\n5. \"I Never Thought It Would Happen\"\n\nSplendiferous is a new 2LP compilation, personally curated by Carlos Santana, showcasing highlights drawn from Santana's musical output spanning 2003-2019. It focuses on the too-often-underappreciated yet creatively fertile period following Santana's 1998 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the massive success of the 1999 album Supernatural. In its wake, Santana released a series of remarkable recordings, among them 2003's Shaman, 2005's All That I Am and 2014's Corazón, that stand with the best that Carlos, or his band, have ever made. Many of these songs and performances were overlooked at the time of their release and are being presented anew on Splendiferous, as essential musical elements in the Santana canon.\n\nSide A\n\n1. Novus (feat.

Other notable signings for the Chicago label included The Chi-Lites, Manchild (featuring a young Kenneth Babyface Edmonds), The Impressions, Sydney Joe Qualls, The Dells and Magnum Force.\n\nThis is the first Chi-Sounds Records collection in more than 20 years and is pressed as a 180g blue vinyl 2LP set.\n\nSide One\n\n1.
