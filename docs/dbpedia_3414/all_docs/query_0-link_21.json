        "text": "https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-27-hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-27-hour-2.mp3\n\nA ‘three artists’ set list – John Mayall, Tom Cochrane/Red Rider, Mick Jagger. Of late I’ve been doing ‘three (or maybe two, time permitting) album’ sets, live or studio records, on a Saturday but this time it’s assorted tracks from three artists. Originally, it was going to be two artists: Jagger, who celebrates his 81st birthday today, Friday, July 26 and still going strong fronting The Rolling Stones who just completed a tour, and Cochrane with and without his original band Red Rider, because he’s playing a festival in my town, Kitchener, Ontario on Saturday.\n\nThen came news that this past Monday, July 22, the so-called Godfather of British Blues, John Mayall, had died at age 90. He was an artist and bandleader who had nurtured the careers of guitar greats like Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor, and perhaps less widely known but no less accomplished players like Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, who I saw play with Mayall’s Bluesbreakers in the late 1980s at, Ontario residents will remember, the old rotating stage at the Ontario Place Forum on the Toronto waterfront. Taylor was the opening act that night and then guested with Mayall, who, believe it or not, acted as one of his own roadies. I remember him coming out, pre-set, adjusting and tinkering with the equipment and my younger brother and I exchanged glances like ‘is that him, yeah, it is, wow, cool. Obviously no airs about him.” If you want a job done right, one supposes . . .\n\nMayall was making music until near the end, consistently releasing new music every year or two, most recently in 2022. Just a few weeks ago on my show I played a track from his 2016 album Talk About That (and he recorded two more studio albums after that) and mentioned how he was still releasing new music although he had retired from touring aside from a gig here or there close to his California home. I most recently saw him at the Kitchener Blues Festival in 2011, a fine afternoon show on the last day of a festival which that year also featured Gregg Allman, the Winter brothers Johnny and Edgar, separately, and Mayall.\n\nAnd it’s interesting perhaps about Mayall in that although he was thought of as a blues artist, and he was, his horizons were broad if you delve deeply into his music, evidenced by some stuff I’m playing on the show including tracks like Nature’s Disappearing – from the drummer-less album USA Union in 1970 which was my introduction to Mayall as my older brother had the album – and other excursions like his 1972 live album Jazz Blues Fusion. He was forever experimenting, searching for new sounds but for the very most part always based in blues.\n\nSo, a three-artist set: Cochrane/Red Rider, Jagger and Mayall. Some hits or at least fairly well-known tunes, some maybe more obscure deep cut stuff, all of it among my favorites by these artists.\n\n1. John Mayall, Wake Up Call (title cut from Mayall’s 1993 album, with Mick Taylor trying to beg off the session on a fun intro phone call, along with Mavis Staples)\n\n2. Red Rider, Light In The Tunnel (first of three tracks from the 1983 album Neruda that are an overall intro piece to the record.)\n\n3. Red Rider, Power (Strength In Numbers)\n\n4. Red Rider, Human Race\n\n5. Mick Jagger, Out Of Focus\n\n6. John Mayall, Nature’s Disappearing\n\n7. Tom Cochrane & Red Rider, Just Like Ali\n\n8. Mick Jagger with Buddy Guy, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker) … a bluesy rearrangement of the Stones’ Goats Heat Soup album tune, released on the 2018 album Chicago Plays The Stones. It’s a tribute to The Rolling Stones by some of the artists who inspired them.\n\n9. Red Rider, Napoleon Sheds His Skin\n\n10. John Mayall, Night Flyer\n\n11. Mick Jagger, Evening Gown . . . the type of country-ish ballad Jagger, in my view, does so well. Along the same lines later in the set are Hang On To Me Tonight and Party Doll.\n\n12. Red Rider, Lunatic Fringe\n\n13. John Mayall, Ain’t No Brakeman\n\n14. Mick Jagger, Think . . . cover of a tune made famous by James Brown.\n\n15. John Mayall, Broken Wings . . . beautiful, haunting track from Mayall’s The Blues Alone, just Mayall on guitar with drummer Keef Hartley.\n\n16. Mick Jagger, Hang On To Me Tonight\n\n17. John Mayall, Mail Order Mystics\n\n18. Mick Jagger, Sweet Thing\n\n19. Red Rider, Young Thing, Wild Dreams (Rock Me)\n\n20. Mick Jagger, Too Many Cooks (Spoil The Soup)\n\n21. John Mayall, Spinning Coin\n\n22. Mick Jagger, Party Doll\n\n23. John Mayall, Took The Car\n\n24. Mick Jagger, Mother Of A Man\n\n25. John Mayall, Room To Move\n\n26. John Mayall, Fly Tomorrow\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-22-hour-1.mp3\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-22-hour-2.mp3\n\nMusic for a Monday night. My track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.\n\n1. Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Nut Rocker (live, from Pictures at an Exhibition)\n\n2. Golden Earring, Sleepwalkin’\n\n3. Deep Purple, A Bit On The Side\n\n4. Jethro Tull, Rock Island\n\n5. David Bowie, Shadow Man\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Laugh I Nearly Died\n\n7. Elvis Costello, Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down\n\n8. The Byrds, You’re Still On My Mind\n\n9. Warren Zevon, Poisonous Lookalike\n\n10. The Kingsmen, Death Of An Angel\n\n11. Grand Funk Railroad, Creepin’\n\n12. Manfred Mann’s Earth Band, Don’t Kill It Carol\n\n13. Gov’t Mule, Silent Scream\n\n14. Eric Clapton, Black Summer Rain\n\n15. Rory Gallagher, I’m Not Awake Yet\n\n16. The Butterfield Blues Band, Just To Be With You\n\n17. Kansas, Throwing Mountains\n\n18. Patti Smith, Birdland\n\n19. George Thorogood & The Destroyers, That’s It, I Quit\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Nut Rocker (live, from Pictures at an Exhibition) . . . One of ELP’s several rock interpretations of classical works, this one from the album where the band put its stamp on the piano suite by Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky. Nut Rocker, however, was the last track on the album and lone piece not by Mussorgsky. It was ELP’s adaptation of a work by another Russian composer, Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker. Nut Rocker was also a hit single in 1962 for American instrumental ensemble B. Bumble and the Stingers, who were famously among the many artists name-checked by the one-hit wonder band Reunion on their 1974 hit Life Is A Rock (But The Radio Rolled Me), which I played a few weeks ago although B. Bumble is referred to as B.B. Bumble in the first verse of the Reunion song.\n\n2. Golden Earring, Sleepwalkin’ . . . Funky boogie boppin’ single, didn’t chart, from the 1976 album To The Hilt. Much more to the Dutch band than just the songs Radar Love and Twilight Zone.\n\n3. Deep Purple, A Bit On The Side . . . Chugging, driving rocker from the new Deep Purple album, = 1, released this past Friday, July 19, to celebrate my birthday. 🙂 Officially a senior now, at 65. Just coincidence, of course, but a nice birthday present to myself. It’s the first studio album to feature Purple’s new guitarist, Northern Irish player Simon McBride. McBride replaces Steve Morse, who McBride filled in for on tour a couple years ago when Morse took a break from the band to care for his ailing wife who has, alas, since died. Morse eventually left the group and McBride was made a fulltime member. I liked the Morse period, which covered eight studio albums from 1996 to 2021, but McBride has fit right in and the album, rightly, is getting good reviews but I’m probably the wrong person to ask, being a huge Deep Purple fan. As for the album’s title, according to Wikipedia “the album has been described as having a loose concept around the idea that in a world growing ever more complex, everything eventually simplifies down to a single, unified essence. Everything equals one.” There’s a mathematical equation on the inside sleeve of the album cover, which gives me nightmares about high school algebra, but the cover is cool: a simple = 1 and “Deep Purple” on an otherwise entirely white background, somewhat akin to The Beatles’ White Album.\n\n4. Jethro Tull, Rock Island . . . I’ve been going through some of Tull’s more recent albums of late, and played Occasional Demons from 1993’s Catfish Rising a couple weeks ago. This is the title cut from the album preceding that one, released in 1989. Typical Tull, part ballad, some riff rocking, nice.\n\n5. David Bowie, Shadow Man . . . Haunting, spooky track featuring a stirring vocal performance by Bowie. It was originally recorded in 1971, but left unfinished, during the sessions for the classic 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars. Bowie reworked it in 2000 for the Toy album project, which wasn’t released on its own until 2021 although Shadow Man was included on the 3-CD deluxe edition of the compilation Nothing Has Changed, released in 2014.\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Laugh I Nearly Died . . . Slow burning bluesy funk track, if that makes sense but I think you can marry myriad genres, a mashup of sorts. Apparently used in the TV series Supernatural, which I’ve never seen but aside from sports, history documentaries and Star Trek I’m not a big TV watcher although all of that consumes enough time. Probably a good thing I’ve not seen Supernatural, although now I’m tempted, because then I’d think of scenes from the show instead of enjoying the song. It’s like when a novel becomes a movie and the paperback is re-released with a character or two, as portrayed by actors, on the cover. Just not my cup of tea – I prefer to imagine what characters look like or interpret the song for myself, but I ‘get’ the tie-ins.\n\n7. Elvis Costello, Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down . . . Just randomly picked Almost Blue, Costello’s 1981 country and western covers album, off the shelf and played it driving back and forth to the gym this past week. A Merle Haggard tune, nicely done, on a solid album. The older I get, the more I seem to enjoy country music. Interesting.\n\n8. The Byrds, You’re Still On My Mind . . . Still in the country groove, here’s another hurtin’ tune, from the Sweetheart Of The Rodeo album, the one record Gram Parsons, who sings the tune, did with the Byrds before leaving to form The Flying Burrito Brothers.\n\n9. Warren Zevon, Poisonous Lookalike . . . About a relationship gone bad, from Zevon’s 1995 album Mutineer. David Lindley helps out on fiddle and cittern, a guitar-like stringed instrument, similar to a lute, dating to the Renaissance. Lindley, who had an extensive session playing history with many artists including Zevon, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt, is perhaps best known on his own for his 1981 debut solo album El Rayo-X. That record featured the hit single Mercury Blues (also done by Steve Miller on the Fly Like An Eagle album), written by blues musicians K. C. Douglas and Robert Geddins and first recorded by Douglas in 1948.\n\n10. The Kingsmen, Death Of An Angel . . . Slightly speeded up version of a spooky sort of song originally done in 1955 by the Los Angeles-based doo-wop vocal group Donald Woods and The Vel-Aires. It was released on the 1964 album The Kingsmen Volume II, subtitled “More Great Songs From The Group That Gave You ‘Louie, Louie’ “.\n\n11. Grand Funk Railroad, Creepin’ . . . Inspired to play it by a friend mentioning it, an appropriately-titled track from 1973’s We’re An American Band album, it was the B-side to the title cut No. 1 single.\n\n12. Manfred Mann’s Earth Band, Don’t Kill It Carol . . . Two different English bands with one leader. There’s the 1960s Manfred Mann of hits like Do Wah Diddy Diddy, Pretty Flamingo and their cover of Bob Dylan’s Quinn The Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn), released as Mighty Quinn by Manfred Mann. Then there’s the 1970s progressive/jazz rock Manfred Mann’s Earth Band, best known for their 1976 hit single cover of Bruce Springsteen’s Blinded By The Light. The trippy, psychedelic Don’t Kill It Carol, from 1979’s Angel Station album, made it just inside the top 50 in the UK.\n\n13. Gov’t Mule, Silent Scream . . . Bluesy, dark, near 11-minute epic from the Mule’s 2004 album Deja Voodoo.\n\n14. Eric Clapton, Black Summer Rain . . . Lovely track from the 1976 album No Reason To Cry. Among the personnel on the album were Bob Dylan, all members of The Band, Ron Wood, ace session guitarist Jesse Ed Davis and Yvonne Elliman, who contributed vocals to four Clapton studio albums during the 1970s and was part of his touring band.\n\n15. Rory Gallagher, I’m Not Awake Yet . . . Typically fine guitar picking on this cantering cut from Gallagher’s second solo album – Deuce, released in 1971 – after the 1970 breakup of Taste.\n\n16. The Butterfield Blues Band, Just To Be With You . . . Soulful blues from Paul Buttefield and friends from the In Your Own Dream album, released in 1968.\n\n17. Kansas, Throwing Mountains . . . Great prog rock from a band that, like a lot of people, I first appreciated during the 1970s for their hits Carry On Wayward Son and Dust In The Wind but investigated more deeply, and was rewarded, as time passed. This one’s from a latter day album with a great title – The Absence of Presence – released in 2020.\n\n18. Patti Smith, Birdland . . . I’d describe this harrowing, nine-minute production from Smith’s debut release, the 1975 album Horses, as progressive punk stirring spoken word art rock. According to Wikipedia, it was inspired by A Book of Dreams, a 1973 memoir of Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich by his son Peter, and revolves around a narrative in which Peter, at his father’s funeral, imagines leaving on a UFO piloted by his father’s spirit.\n\n19. George Thorogood & The Destroyers, That’s It, I Quit . . . I’m outta here, quitting for the night as Thorogood covers a Nick Lowe-penned song, from The Destroyers’ 2003 album Ride ‘Til I Die. The song was also done by English band Dr. Feelgood, released on the 1977 album Be Seeing You, produced by Lowe.\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-20-hour-1.mp3\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-20-hour-2.mp3\n\nAnother album replay set list for my Saturday show. The three records I’m playing – Black And Blue by The Rolling Stones, In Through The Out Door by Led Zeppelin and Drama from Yes – all came to mind thanks to chats with friends the past week or so.\n\nThe Stones and Zep albums, released in 1976 and 1979, respectively, came up in a discussion about albums that may not have been necessarily well received critically upon release but have seemed to stand the test of time and in the view of some, and also in so-called retrospective reviews by journalists, have risen in stature.\n\nThere’s the Stones, “auditioning guitar players” as Keith Richards termed Black And Blue. It was recorded in sessions stretching, in various stints, from late 1974 to early 1976 before its April, 1976 release and featured various guitarists including eventual Stone Ron Wood after the departure of Mick Taylor. What resulted was a brew of rock, funk, soul, disco and reggae helped along by the presence, among others, of keyboardist Billy Preston who contributed live and in studio to various Stones projects during that period, and percussionist Ollie Brown. The departed Taylor was on record as saying he enjoyed the album.\n\nThen Zeppelin, in relative tatters with Robert Plant still mourning the death of his young son and Jimmy Page and John Bonham in the throes of drug and booze addiction, releasing a somewhat uncharacteristic, keyboard-heavy album. That’s due in large measure to the influence of bassist/keyboard player John Paul Jones, a noted if perhaps underappreciated session player along with Page in the early 1960s, who co-wrote six of the seven songs on the album, previously unheard of for anyone outside the Page-Plant songwriting duo.\n\nAnd then there’s Drama, the out of left field in terms of personnel Yes album from 1980 featuring members of The Buggles of Video Killed The Radio Star fame when Trevor Horn (lead vocals, replaced longtime Yes singer Jon Anderson) and Geoff Downes (keyboards) replaced Rick Wakeman. I got talking about it, and Yes in general, when a friend mentioned he was going to see Yes on a bill with Deep Purple coming up in August and we agreed that Drama is a damn fine album. It’s one of my favorites by Yes, I don’t hear much difference between Horn’s vocals and Anderson’s, but that’s not even really the point because I like the almost metallic sound of the record, particularly its opening track, the 10-minute epic Machine Messiah. And the rest of it. So, here you go, three interesting albums for a Saturday morning.\n\nThe Rolling Stones – Black And Blue\n\n1. Hot Stuff\n\n2. Hand Of Fate\n\n3. Cherry Oh Baby\n\n4. Memory Motel\n\n5. Hey Negrita\n\n6. Melody\n\n7. Fool To Cry\n\n8. Crazy Mama\n\nLed Zeppelin – In Through The Out Door\n\n1. In The Evening\n\n2. South Bound Suarez\n\n3. Fool In The Rain\n\n4. Hot Dog\n\n5. Carouselambra\n\n6. All My Love\n\n7. I’m Gonna Crawl\n\nYes – Drama\n\n1. Machine Messiah\n\n2. White Car\n\n3. Does It Really Happen?\n\n4. Into The Lens\n\n5. Run Through The Light\n\n6. Tempus Fugit\n\nMy track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list. Audio log of the show unavailable, alas, this week.\n\n1. Montrose, Space Station #5\n\n2. Atomic Rooster, Head In The Sky\n\n3. Camel, Never Let Go\n\n4. J.J. Cale, Stay Around\n\n5. Steely Dan, I Got The News\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Terrifying\n\n7. Boz Scaggs, Runnin’ Blue\n\n8. Paris, Black Book\n\n9. Fleetwood Mac, Born Enchanter\n\n10. Joe Cocker, Hitchcock Railway\n\n11. Jimi Hendrix, Ezy Ryder\n\n12. Bill Withers, Harlem\n\n13. Peter Gabriel, The Rhythm Of The Heat\n\n14. Pink Floyd, Cymbaline\n\n15. Ten Years After, Convention Prevention\n\n16. Steve Earle, I’m Looking Through You (Beatles cover)\n\n17. Traffic, Many A Mile To Freedom\n\n18. Frank Zappa/The Mothers Of Invention (credited as The Mothers), Fifty-Fifty\n\n19. Rare Earth, Ma\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. Montrose, Space Station #5 . . . Montrose has been top of mind because I watched a documentary on Sammy Hagar last week, so here you go. Cool ‘space’ intro and then into a propulsive hard rock tune from Montrose’s self-titled debut album, released in 1973 with Hagar of course on lead vocals. It’s where the eventual connections between Hagar and Van Halen arguably began. Eddie Van Halen was a fan of Montrose guitarist Ronnie Montrose and the Montrose album was produced by Ted Templeman, five years before Van Halen’s debut which was produced by Templeman among many Van Halen albums he was involved with, although just one, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, with the Van Hagar version of the band. Templeman, well-known for his production work with The Doobie Brothers and Van Morrison, also worked on solo albums by both Hagar and David Lee Roth.\n\n2. Atomic Rooster, Head In The Sky . . . Driving rocker from a progressive British band whose roots are traced to The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown (known for the single Fire) which featured the late keyboardist Vincent Crane and drummer Carl Palmer, before he left in 1970 after one album with Rooster to join Emerson, Lake and Palmer. This is from the band’s third album, In Hearing Of, released in 1971.\n\n3. Camel, Never Let Go . . . From the English progressive rock band’s self-titled debut album in 1973, melding acoustic and harder rock flourishes.\n\n4. J.J. Cale, Stay Around . . . Typical bluesy, relaxed groove from J.J., an artist I often say did essentially the same thing for countless albums yet was always different enough to never be boring or repetitive. This is the title cut from a 2019 posthumous release of to that point unreleased material. It was put together by Cale’s widow Christine Lakeland, who was a member of his band and appeared on many albums, and his longtime friend and manager, Mike Kappus, who also worked extensively with John Lee Hooker and Robert Cray, among others.\n\n5. Steely Dan, I Got The News . . . Funky, jazzy track from an often funky, jazzy band, from 1977’s Aja album.\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Terrifying . . . A swinging tune from the 1989 album Steel Wheels. It was the fourth single released from the album, did reasonably well yet isn’t among the band’s well-known tracks in terms of widespread recognition. So, I’m happy to use it as a relative deep cut.\n\n7. Boz Scaggs, Runnin’ Blue . . . Many people I think remember Boz Scaggs for hits like Lido Shuffle and Lowdown but, long before those hits he was a member of the pre-commercial hits Steve Miller Band during that group’s early, psychedelic and blues period, then a fine solo artist in his own right as evidenced by this rhythm and blues tune from his 1971 album Boz Scaggs & Band.\n\n8. Paris, Black Book . . . Hard rocking tune by a hard rocking, Led Zeppelin-ish band put together by mid-period Fleetwood Mac member and, later, solo artist Bob Welch, after he left Fleetwood Mac following 1974’s Heroes Are Hard To Find album. Also in the band, which released two albums in 1976, was former/original Jethro Tull bass player Glenn Cornick.\n\n9. Fleetwood Mac, Born Enchanter . . . And here’s Welch in a different light, on this jazzy, er, enchanting tune he wrote and sang for the aforementioned 1974 Fleetwood Mac album Heroes Are Hard To Find. It was Welch’s last of five albums with the Mac, which recruited Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham and went on to massive commercial success. The band was essentially three different groups: the early, blues-oriented outfit led by Peter Green, the Welch period and the Nicks-Buckingham lineup, all excellent in their own ways.\n\n10. Joe Cocker, Hitchcock Railway . . . Bouncy, jaunty track from Cocker’s second album, the 1969 release Joe Cocker! Cocker is joined by a host of session players including The Grease Band. That group, which backed Cocker at Woodstock, included such luminaries as keyboardist/bassist Chris Stainton, whose long list of credits include albums with Eric Clapton, Leon Russell (who also plays on the Cocker album), Spooky Tooth, Pete Townshend and Ian Hunter, and guitarist Henry McCullough, later of Paul McCartney and Wings.\n\n11. Jimi Hendrix, Ezy Ryder . . . From the first of countless posthumous Hendrix releases, the Cry Of Love which came out in March, 1971. I remember my older brother having it, him being a big Hendrix fan who introduced me to Jimi’s music. The album was comprised of material Hendrix was working on for a planned fourth studio album, which he never completed before his death. Ezy Ryder, a funk-driven rocker, is one of the few available studio recordings by the Band of Gypsys – Hendrix, bass player Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles. The trio is well-known for the album Band of Gypsys, recorded at New York City’s Fillmore East venue as the calendar flipped from 1969 to 1970.\n\n12. Bill Withers, Harlem . . . Ever-escalating soul track from Withers’ 1971 album Just As I Am. It’s the one featuring his biggest hit, Ain’t No Sunshine and is notable for the who’s who of musicians backing Withers, including Stephen Stills, Booker T. Jones and Donald ‘Duck’ Dunn of of Booker T. and The M.G.’s fame, and session drummer to the stars Jim Keltner.\n\n13. Peter Gabriel, The Rhythm Of The Heat . . . Haunting track from Gabriel’s 1982 album, his fourth. It was called Security in North America and featured the hit Shock The Monkey, although Gabriel reluctantly went along with the ‘Security’ nomenclature the record company wanted in order to differentiate the album from what preceded it. The first four Gabriel albums are officially called, simply, Peter Gabriel but the first three are also unofficially known and identifiable as, in order, Car, Scratch and Melt based on their cover art.\n\n14. Pink Floyd, Cymbaline . . . Early Floyd, a pastoral-type track whose sound is at odds with the dark lyrics. It’s from the More movie soundtrack, released in 1969. The movie, about drug addiction, is currently available on YouTube but, regardless, the album hangs together well as a stand-alone statement.\n\n15. Ten Years After, Convention Prevention . . . Typically fine boogie rock from TYA, from 1972’s Rock & Roll Music To The World album.\n\n16. Steve Earle, I’m Looking Through You (Beatles cover) . . . Earle gives the Rubber Soul song the country/bluegrass treatment; from his 1995 album Train a Comin’.\n\n17. Traffic, Many A Mile To Freedom . . . Beautiful track from The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys album, released in 1971. Jethro Tull, and I love that band, isn’t the only group employing fabulous flute playing – here courtesy Chris Wood.\n\n18. Frank Zappa/The Mothers Of Invention (credited as simply The Mothers), Fifty-Fifty . . . Typically great guitar by Zappa on this one from 1973’s Over-Nite Sensation, coupled with the renowned Jean-Luc Ponty on violin. Vocals by Ricky Lancelotti, lost to the world to a drug overdose in 1980, age 35.\n\n19. Rare Earth, Ma . . . Epic, 17-minutes and change title track from the band’s 1973 album. Written by Motown ace songwriter/producer Norman Whitfield, who often teamed with Barrett Strong to write such classics as Papa Was A Rollin’ Stone, to which Ma is considered to be something of a companion piece. Among their other collaborations: I Heard It Through The Grapevine, War and Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me).\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-13-hour-1-1.mp3\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-13-hour-2.mp3\n\nI’m featuring late 1970s-early 1980s punk/new wave and ska songs, stuff I got into during my college days, plus a segment, near the end of the set, of one-hit wonder type material of the kind one used to find on compilations from record labels like K-tel. I’ve done full shows of one-hit wonder stuff in the past, likely will do so again at some point.\n\nThis show includes Reunion’s Life Is A Rock (But The Radio Rolled Me), which famously name-checks myriad artists, songs and record companies, and Blue Swede’s Hooked On A Feeling, aka the Ooga-Chaka song (Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga Ooga-Chaka …). The Blue Swede song returned to prominence via its presence in the first Guardians Of The Galaxy movie and as lead cut on the soundtrack, in 2014.\n\nSugarloaf, meantime, was at least a two-hit wonder. Besides what I’m playing, Don’t Call Us, We’ll Call You, the group’s Green-Eyed Lady was an even bigger hit. And Hot Chocolate, represented in the set by the song Emma (you may recall the lyric Emma, Emmalene…a sad song, actually) had many hits in the UK and North America, including You Sexy Thing, Every 1’s A Winner, You Could Have Been A Lady (a North American hit single for April Wine) and Brother Louie, which American band Stories turned into the North American chart-topping version I’m playing on the show.\n\nI’ve got a double dip of Flash and The Pan because I think those two, similar songs, Walking In The Rain from the first album and the title cut from the second release, Lights In the Night, are something of a piece, to my ears anyway.\n\n1. Madness, One Step Beyond\n\n2. The Selecter, On My Radio\n\n3. The Clash, Revolution Rock\n\n4. Dead Kennedys, Too Drunk To Fuck\n\n5. Devo, (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction\n\n6. Blondie, I Know But I Don’t Know\n\n7. Ramones, I Just Want To Have Something To Do\n\n8. The Specials, Rat Race\n\n9. Flash and The Pan, Walking In The Rain\n\n10.
