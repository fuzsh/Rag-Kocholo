M.; Bourrain, X.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe contribution of human activities such as industries, agriculture and domestic inputs, becomes more and more significant in the chemical composition of the dissolved load of rivers. Human factors act as a supplementary key process. Therefore the mass-balance for the budget of catchments and river basins include anthropogenic disturbances. The Loire River in central France is approximately 1010 km long and drains an area of 117,800 km2. In the upper basin, the bedrock is old plutonic rock overlain by much younger volcanic rocks. The intermediate basin includes three major tributaries flowing into the Loire River from the left bank: the Cher, the Indre and the Vienne rivers; the main stream flows westward and its valley stretches toward the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the Loire River drains the sedimentary series of the Paris Basin, mainly carbonate deposits. The lower Loire basin drains pre-Mesozoic basement of the Armorican Massif and its overlying Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary deposits. The Loire River is one of the main European riverine inputs to the Atlantic ocean. Here we are reporting concentration and isotope data for Zn in river waters and suspended sediments from the Loire River Basin. In addition, we also report concentration and isotope data for the different industrial sources within the Loire Basin, as well as data for biota samples such as mussels and oysters from the Bay of Biscay and North Brittany. These organisms are known to be natural accumulators of metal pollutants. Zinc isotopic compositions are rather homogeneous in river waters with Î´66Zn values ranging from 0.21 to 0.39â°. This range of variation is very different from anthropogenic signature (industrial and/or agriculture release) that displays Î´66Zn values between 0.02 to 0.14â°. This result is in agreement with a geogenic origin and the low Zn concentrations in the Loire River Basin (from 0.8 to 6 Âµg/L).\n\nLi-Zn-Pb multi isotopic characterization of the Loire River Basin, France\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMillot, R.; Desaulty, A.; Widory, D.; Bourrain, X.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Loire River in France is approximately 1010 km long and drains an area of 117 800 km2. Upstream, the Loire River flows following a south to north direction from the Massif Central down to the city of OrlÃ©ans, 650 km from its source. The Loire River is one of the main European riverine inputs to the Atlantic Ocean. Over time, its basin has been exposed to numerous sources of anthropogenic metal pollutions, such as metal mining, industry, agriculture and domestic inputs. The Loire River basin is thus an excellent study site to develop new isotope systematics for tracking anthropogenic sources of metal pollutions (Zn and Pb) and also to investigate Li isotope tracing that can provide key information on the nature of weathering processes at the Loire River Basin scale. Preliminary data show that Li-Zn-Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions span a wide range in river waters of the Loire River main stream and the main tributaries. There is a clear contrast between the headwaters upstream and rivers located downstream in the lowlands. In addition, one of the major tributaries within the Massif Central (the Allier River) is clearly influenced by inputs resulting from mineralizations and thermomineral waters. The results showed that, on their own, each of these isotope systematics reveals important information about the geogenic or anthropogenic origin Li-Zn-Pb. Considered together, they are however providing a more integrated understanding of the overall budgets of these elements at the scale of the Loire River Basin.\n\nPb-Zn-Cd-Hg multi isotopic characterization of the Loire River Basin, France\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMillot, R.; Widory, D.; Innocent, C.; Guerrot, C.; Bourrain, X.; Johnson, T. M.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe contribution of human activities such as industries, agriculture and domestic inputs, becomes more and more significant in the chemical composition (major ions and pollutants such as metals) of the dissolved load of rivers. Furthermore, this influence can also be evidenced in the suspended solid matter known to play an important role in the transport of heavy metals through river systems. Human factors act as a supplementary key process. Therefore the mass-balance for the budget of catchments and river basins include anthropogenic disturbances. The Loire River in central France is approximately 1010 km long and drains an area of 117,800 km2. Initially, the Loire upstream flows in a south to north direction originating in the Massif Central, and continues up to the city of OrlÃ©ans, 650 km from the source. In the upper basin, the bedrock is old plutonic rock overlain by much younger volcanic rocks. The Loire River then follows a general east to west direction to the Atlantic Ocean. The intermediate basin includes three major tributaries flowing into the Loire River from the left bank: the Cher, the Indre and the Vienne rivers; the main stream flows westward and its valley stretches toward the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the Loire River drains the sedimentary series of the Paris Basin, mainly carbonate deposits. The lower Loire basin drains pre-Mesozoic basement of the Armorican Massif and its overlying Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary deposits. The Loire River is one of the main European riverine inputs to the Atlantic ocean. Here we are reporting concentration and isotope data for heavy metals Zn-Cd-Pb-Hg in river waters and suspended sediments from the Loire River Basin. In addition, we also report concentration and isotope data for these metals for the different industrial sources within the Loire Basin, as well as data for biota samples such as mussels and oysters from the Bay of Biscay and North Brittany. These organisms are known to be natural accumulators of\n\nRole of river bank erosion in sediment budgets of catchments within the Loire river basin (France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGay, Aurore; Cerdan, Olivier; Poisvert, Cecile; Landemaine, Valentin\n\n2014-05-01\n\nQuantifying volumes of sediments produced on hillslopes or in channels and transported or stored within river systems is necessary to establish sediment budgets. If research efforts on hillslope erosion processes have led to a relatively good understanding and quantification of local sources, in-channel processes remain poorly understood and quasi inexistent in global budgets. However, profound landuse changes and agricultural practices have altered river functioning, caused river bank instability and stream incision. During the past decades in France, river channelization has been perfomed extensively to allow for new agricultural practices to take place. Starting from a recent study on the quantification of sediment fluxes for catchments within the Loire river basin (Gay et al. 2013), our aim is to complete sediment budgets by taking into account various sources and sinks both on hillslope and within channel. The emphasis of this study is on river bank erosion and how bank erosion contributes to global budgets. A model of bank retreat is developed for the entire Loire river basin. In general, our results show that bank retreat is on average quite low with approximately 1 cm.yr-1. However, a strong variability exists within the study area with channels displaying values of bank retreat up to ~10 cm.yr-1. Our results corroborate those found by Landemaine et al. in 2013 on a small agricultural catchment. From this first step, quantification of volumes of sediment eroded from banks and available for transport should be calculated and integrated in sediment budgets to allow for a better understanding of basin functioning.

This paper studies the variation of anthropogenic tritium species in the Loire River system from upstream to the mouth of the estuary. Tritiated water (HTO and HTO in sediment pore water) and organically bound tritium (OBT) forms were analysed after dedicated pre-treatments. The collected environmental samples consist in (i) surface-sediment and core samples from the river floor, (ii) surface and water column samples. A maximum 3H activity concentration of 26 Â± 3 BqÂ·L- 1 in the Loire River estuary is obtained whereas an environmental background level around 1 BqÂ·L- 1 is determined for a non influenced continental area by anthropogenic activities. The European follow-up indicator used as a screening value is 100 BqÂ·L- 1. The conservative tritium behaviour was used in order to characterize the tidal regime and river flow influences in the mixing zone of the Loire River estuary. Furthermore, OBT levels and total organically carbon (TOC) content are explored. Finally, ratios of OBT relative to HTO in sediment pore water in surface-sediment and core samples are also discussed.\n\nMetal Chemical and Isotope Characterisation in the Upper Loire River Basin, France\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWidory, D.; Nigris, R.; Morard, A.; Gassama, N.; Poirier, A.; Bourrain, X.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe Water Framework Directive (WFD) elaborated by the European Commission regulates water resources in the EC based on five years management plans. A new management plan that started in 2016 imposes strict water quality criteria to its member states, including good status thresholds for metallic contaminants. The Loire River, the most important river in France, flows through areas with lithologies naturally containing high metal concentrations in the upper part of its basin. Understanding these metal fluxes into the river is thus a prerequisite to understand their potential impact on the quality of its water in regards to the criteria defined by the WFD. The Massif Central, a residue of the Hercynian chain, is composed of granitic and volcanic rocks. Both its upstream position in the Loire basin and its numerous metal mineralizations made this region a good candidate for characterizing the natural metal geochemical background of its surface waters. To fulfill this objective we focused on the Pb, Cd and Zn chemical and isotope characteristics of selected non-anthropized small watersheds. The investigated small watersheds were selected for supposedly draining a single lithology and undergoing (as far as possible) negligible to no anthropogenic pressure. Results showed that although the high metal potential of the upper part of the Loire River basin has been highly exploited by humans for centuries, metal concentrations during the hydrological cycle are still under the guidelines defined by the WFD. Isotope compositions/ratios are strongly related to the corresponding lithologies along the rivers and help precisely define the local geochemical background that can then be used to identify and quantify any anthropogenic inputs downstream.\n\nLandscape trajectories during the Lateglacial and the Holocene in the Loir River Valley (France) : the contribution of Geoarchaeology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPiana, Juliene\n\n2015-04-01\n\nA multidisciplinary research has been initiated in the Loir River valley where investigations revealed high-potential fluvial records and landforms for environmental and socio-environmental reconstructions. Investigations provide the opportunity to reconstruct landscape trajectories between climate, environmental and societal changes during the last 16000 years, using geoarchaeological and archaeogeographical approaches: sedimentology, soil micromorphology, geochemistry, archaeology, geomatics, geochronology (AGES Program: Ancient Geomorphological EvolutionS of Loire Basin hydrosystem). In the sector of Vaas (Sarthe, France) the research on the Lateglacial and the Holocene sedimentary sequences from the alluvial plain leads to a general overview of the valley evolution from the end of the Weichselian Upper Pleniglacial to the Present. Joined to archaeological (Protohistoric and Antic sites) and historical data (engineering archives, 18th century cadastral registers) this research highlights the importance of anthropogenic and geomorphological heritages in the current fluvial landscape (microtopography, wetlands, archaeological remains, land use). This knowledge constitutes a basis for skills transfer to planners and managers, in sustainable management of hydrological resources (reducing the vulnerability to flooding and low flows), preservation of biodiversity (wetlands protection) and valorization of landscapes (cultural tourism development).\n\nFlow and sediment dynamics in the vegetated secondary channels of an anabranching river: The Loire River (France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRodrigues, StÃ©phane; BrÃ©hÃ©ret, Jean-Gabriel; Macaire, Jean-Jacques; Moatar, Florentina; Nistoran, Dana; JugÃ©, Philippe\n\n2006-04-01\n\nThis study investigates the hydrological and sedimentological mechanisms occurring in the vegetated secondary channels of an anabranching river affected by incision: the Loire River (France). During and after flood events that occurred between 2000 and 2003, observations and measurements were performed on a vegetated secondary channel located in the study site of BrÃ©hÃ©mont (790 km downstream the source). Morphological changes and sediment dynamics were analysed using low elevation airborne photographs, topographic and bathymetric surveys, and scour chains. The hydraulic behaviour of the channel was also analysed by measurements performed on flow velocity and direction during different flood stages. In order to quantify the influence of woody vegetation on flow resistance, the roughness of bands of trees was determined from measurements performed on the field. The impact of the disruption of armour layers on bedload pulses, the variation of sedimentary processes during a single flood event and the fixation of bedforms by vegetation are all identified as key processes influencing the behaviour of the study channel. Topographic surveys demonstrate that sediment dynamics is substantial in the upstream part of the channel and that sediment budgets are different according to the temporal scale considered. Moreover, an asymmetrical behaviour of the secondary channel is demonstrated: reduced quantities of sediment deposited and preserved in the vegetated zones contrast with material by-passing observed in the third order channels. Flow velocity and direction measurements indicate that these parameters vary according to the water level and to the morphological units of the channel (pools, riffles, vegetated areas). During low flows, scouring and export of particles from the secondary channel are a consequence of reduced sediment supply from the main channel of the Loire River. For these water levels, sedimentation occurs in pools where velocity and turbulence decrease\n\nConnectivity from source to sink in a lowland area: the Loire river basin (France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGay, Aurore; Cerdan, Olivier; Degan, Francesca; Salvador, Sebastien\n\n2014-05-01\n\nSediment connectivity relates to the transfer of sediments from sources to sinks via runoff and in channel transport. It is highly dependent on spatial variability of landscape properties such as differences in morphology, land use and infiltration/runoff characteristics but may also vary in time due to differences in rainfall amount/intensity and changes in vegetation cover throughout the year. In the Loire river basin, we found that sediment fluxes displayed strong variations in space but also at the interannual and seasonnal time scales (Gay et al. 2013). In this context, our goal is to better understand and quantify hillslope sediment redistributions within this lowland area thanks to the use of semi distributed connectivity approach. To this aim, Borselli's index of connectivity (IC, Borselli et al., 2008) is selected to assess hillslope connectivity at annual and seasonal time scales. Several improvements are proposed to take into account the coupling of the structural landscape connectivity and its hydrosedimentary response. Parameters such as rainfall intensity and differences in seasonal land cover are integrated into the model to account for landscape variations through time. Infiltration and runoff indices were also tested. Preliminary results confirm the variability of landscape connectivity throughout the year. The integration of the index of infiltration and runoff properties of landscape (IDPR) as defined by Mardhel et al. 2004 seems to improve the IC model outputs. From this first step, in-stream sediment connectivity index should be developed for a better understanding and assessment of sediment redistributions at the entire catchment scale. L.

The code itself allows parallelized computing, which decreased greatly the calculation time (5 hours for simulating 3 years hourly). We conducted a daily survey during the period 2012-2014 at 2 sampling stations located in the Middle Loire of nutrients, chlorophyll pigments, phytoplankton and physic-chemical variables. This database was used as both input data (upstream Loire boundary) and validation data of the model (basin outlet). Diffuse and non-point sources were assessed based on a land cover analysis and WWTP datasets. The results appeared very sensible to the coefficients governing the dynamic of suspended solids and of phosphorus (sorption/desorption processes) within the model and some parameters needed to be estimated numerically. Both the Lagrangian point of view and fluxes budgets at the seasonal and event-based scale evidenced the biogeochemical functioning of the Loire River. Low discharge levels set up favorable physical conditions for phytoplankton growth (long water travel time, limited water depth, suspended particles sedimentation). Conversely, higher discharge levels highly limited the phytoplankton biomass (dilution of the colony, washing-out, limited travel time, remobilization of suspended sediments increasing turbidity), and most biogeochemical species were basically transferred downstream. When hydrological conditions remained favorable for phytoplankton development, P-availability was the critical factor. However, the model evidenced that most of the P in summer was recycled within the water body: on one hand it was assimilated by the algae biomass, and on the other hand it was\n\nFluvial landscapes - human societies interactions during the last 2000 years: the Middle Loire River and its embanking since the Middle Ages (France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCastanet, Cyril; Carcaud, Nathalie\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThis research deals with the study of fluvial landscapes, heavily and precociously transformed by societies (fluvial anthroposystems). It aims to characterize i), fluvial responses to climate, environmental and anthropogenic changes ii), history of hydraulical constructions relative to rivers iii), history of fluvial origin risks and their management - (Program: AGES Ancient Geomorphological EvolutionS of the Loire River hydrosystem). The Middle Loire River valley in the Val d'OrlÃ©ans was strongly and precociously occupied, particularly during historical periods. Hydrosedimentary flows are there irregular. The river dykes were built during the Middle Ages (dykes named turcies) and the Modern Period, but ages and localizations of the oldest dykes were not precisely known. A systemic and multi-scaled approach aimed to characterize i), palaeo-hydrographical, -hydrological and -hydraulical evolutions of the Loire River, fluvial risks (palaeo-hazards and -vulnerabilities) and their management. It is based on an integrated approach, in and out archaeological sites: morpho-stratigraphy, sedimentology, geophysics, geochemistry, geomatics, geochronology, archaeology. Spatio-temporal variability of fluvial hazards is characterized. A model of the Loire River fluvial activity is developed: multicentennial scale variability, with higher fluvial activity episodes during the Gallo-Roman period, IX-XIth centuries and LIA. Fluvial patterns changes are indentified. Settlement dynamics and hydraulical constructions of the valley are specified. We establish the ages and localizations of the oldest discovered dikes of the Middle Loire River: after the Late Antiquity and before the end of the Early Middle Ages (2 dated dykes), between Bou and OrlÃ©ans cities. During historical periods, we suggest 2 main thresholds concerning socio-environmental interactions: the first one during the Early Middle Ages (turcies: small scattered dykes), the second during the Modern Period (levees: high\n\nThe metallic contamination of the Loire River Basin (France): Spatial and temporal evolution with a multi-scale approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDhivert, Elie; Grosbois, CÃ©cile; Desmet, Marc; Curie, Florence; Moatar, Florentina; Meybeck, Michel; Bourrain, Xavier\n\n2013-04-01\n\nSince the early 19th century, important agricultural, mining and industrial development has been active in Western Europe. The Loire River Basin (117,800 km2, total population of 8.4 Mp) presents a long history of human pressures, reflecting temporal evolution of technological and urban activities (Grosbois et al, 2012). Hence, sediments of the Loire River and its tributaries have recorded partially and/or totally organic, nutrients and trace element contamination. Nowadays, can we determine history of metallic emissions in sediment records and what is the part of these past inputs relative to the actual contamination? Can we point out historical sources of contamination? To answer these questions, two approaches were used in this study. Firstly, in four coring sites in the Loire River Basin, a temporal re-enacting of metallic contamination trapped in sediments was carried out. Based on age-model and inter-element correlations in each core, trace element signals were deconvoluted and compared to actual and specific chemical signatures of anthropogenic inputs (300 bed sediment samples collected downstream of former and current industrial sites like mines, smelters, planting/coating plants, glassware and car industries, metal recycling plants and waste water treatment plants). The second approach was at a larger basin scale, comparing location of these former and actual contamination sources with explanatory factors such as geology, evolution of population density, of industrial activities and of land use. This was done in the main stream of the Loire River and its major tributaries and locally at a smaller scale (0-500 kmÂ²). All these approaches emphasized three temporal periods of metallic contamination: (i) the first period begins with the 20th century until 1950, it corresponds to the first increase of major contaminants like Ag, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn; some trace elements like Hg and Sn seem to be present in the Loire sediments much earlier as they\n\nHomicide in Tours (Indre-et-Loire, France): a four-year review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaint-Martin, Pauline; Bouyssy, Marie; Bathellier, Stephane; Sarraj, Saad; O'Byrne, Patrick\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis retrospective study examined homicides in two French departments located in the West of France (Indre-et-Loire and Loir-et-Cher) for a four-year period from 2000 to 2003. During this period 63 homicidal deaths were investigated at the Institute of Forensic Science of Tours (Indre-et-Loire). There were 45 male and 18 female victims with an average homicide rate of 1.55 per 100,000 persons. The mean age of the victims was 42 years-old. Forty-five assailants were identified; their mean age was 38 years-old. The most common method of homicide was the use of firearms (40% of the cases), followed by blunt-force injury (36%) and sharp-force injury (16%). 51% of the victims knew their assailant, a family member in 26% of the cases. Spousal homicides occurred in 16% of the cases. Dyadic death occurred in six cases. A review of the literature compares these findings to other populations.\n\nTopographic effect on Radio-Magnetotelluric and Slingram signals: application to a levee along the Loire river, France.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDuval, Rodolphe; Fauchard, Cyrille; Antoine, Raphael\n\n2014-05-01\n\nWe study the influence of the topography of a levee on the electric and magnetic signals obtained with the Radio-Magnetotelluric method (RMT) and the Slingram method, respectively. For the RMT method, field measurements have been modelled with a finite element commercial software (AC/DC and Radio-Frequency modules of Comsol Multiphysics). A levee situated in OrlÃ©ans (France) along the Loire river has been considered in order to design a model taking into account the skin depth and the incident wavelength. The effect of the incident electromagnetic field direction has been assessed with two different incident wave directions: BBC 5 from Salford (UK) and France-Inter from Allouis (France). The simulations highlight the tri-dimensional effects of the topography in the apparent resistivity, observed on the crest of the levee, depending on the incident field direction and topography. For the Slingram method, the magnetic field has been simulated using the AC/DC module of Comsol. The ratio of the primary magnetic field on the secondary one, received in a loop is determined above a straight levee. The study aims to show the various responses obtained in function of both vertical and horizontal coil configurations. We show that the signal also depends on the topography and the right configuration of the coils alignment with respect to the levee stretch direction. In this study, a buried gas pipe is also characterized by the two methods. Numerical modelling of 3D electromagnetic effects on geophysical signals helps to interpret the field measurements and offers to the stakeholder an optimized methodology for geophysical surveys on levees.\n\nMulti isotopic characterization (Li-Cu-Zn-Pb) of waste waters pollution in a small watershed (Loire River basin, France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMillot, R.; Desaulty, A. M.; Perret, S.; Bourrain, X.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe goal of this study is to use multi-isotopic signature to track the pollution in surface waters, and to understand the complex processes causing the metals mobilization and transport in the environment. In the present study, we investigate waste water releases from a hospital water treatment plant and its potential impact in a small river basin near OrlÃ©ans in France (Egoutier watershed: 15 kmÂ²and 5 km long). We decided to monitor this small watershed which is poorly urbanized in the Loire river basin. Its spring is located in a pristine area (forested area), while it is only impacted some kilometers further by the releases rich in metals coming from a hospital water treatment plant. A sampling of these liquid effluents as well as dissolved load and sediment from upstream to downstream was realized and their concentrations and isotopic data were determined. Isotopic ratios were measured using a MC-ICP-MS at BRGM, after a specific protocol of purification for each isotopic systematics. Lithium isotopic compositions are rather homogeneous in river waters along the main course of the stream. The waste water signal is very different from the natural background with significant heavy lithium contribution (high Î´7Li). Lead isotopic compositions are rather homogenous in river waters and sediments with values close to geologic background. For Zn, the sediments with high concentrations and depleted isotopic compositions (low Î´66Zn), typical of an anthropic pollution, are strongly impacted. The analyses of Cu isotopes in sediments show the impact of waster waters, but also isotopic fractionations due to redox processes in the watershed. To better understand these processes controlling the release of metals in water, sequential extractions on sediments are in progress under laboratory conditions and will provide important constraints for metal distribution in this river basin.\n\nNutrient inputs and hydrology together determine biogeochemical status of the Loire River (France): Current situation and possible future scenarios.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarnier, Josette; Ramarson, Antsiva; Billen, Gilles; ThÃ©ry, Sylvain; ThiÃ©ry, Dominique; Thieu, Vincent; Minaudo, Camille; Moatar, Florentina\n\n2018-10-01\n\nThe Grafs-Seneque/Riverstrahler model was implemented for the first time on the Loire River for the 2002-2014 period, to explore eutrophication after improvement of wastewater treatments. The model reproduced the interannual levels and seasonal trends of the major water quality variables. Although eutrophication has been impressively reduced in the drainage network, a eutrophication risk still exists at the coast, as shown by the N-ICEP indicator, pointing out an excess of nitrogen over silica and phosphorus. From maximum biomass exceeding 120â¯Î¼gChlaâ¯l -1 in the 1980's, we observed decreasing maximum values from 80 to 30â¯Î¼gChlaâ¯l -1 during the period studied. Several scenarios were explored. Regarding nutrient point sources, a low wastewater treatment scenario, similar to the situation in the 1980's, was elaborated, representing much greater pollution than the reference period (2002-2014). For diffuse sources, two agricultural scenarios were elaborated for reducing nitrogen, one with a strict application of the agricultural directives and another investigating the impact of radical structural changes in agriculture and the population's diet. Although reduced, a risk of eutrophication would remain, even with the most drastic scenario. In addition, a pristine scenario, with no human activity within the basin, was devised to assess water quality in a natural state. The impact of a change in hydrology on the Loire biogeochemical functioning was also explored according to the effect of climate change by the end of the 21st century. The EROS hydrological model was used to force Riverstrahler, considering the most pessimistic SRES A2 scenario run with the ARPEGE model. Nutrient fluxes all decreased due to a >50% reduction in the average annual discharge, overall reducing the risk of coastal eutrophication, but worsening the water quality status of the river network. The Riverstrahler model could be useful to help water managers contend with future threats in the\n\nWater temperature behaviour in the River Loire since 1976 and 1881\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoatar, Florentina; Gailhard, JoÃ«l\n\n2006-05-01\n\nAnalysis of monthly mean river temperatures, recorded on an hourly basis in the middle reaches of the Loire since 1976, allows reconstruction by multiple linear regression of the annual, spring and summer water temperatures from equivalent information on air temperatures and river discharge. Since 1881, the average annual and summer temperatures of the Loire have risen by approximately 0.8 Â°C, this increase accelerating since the late 1980s due to the rise in air temperature and also to lower discharge rates. In addition, the thermal regime in the Orleans to Blois reach is considerably affected by the inflow of groundwater from the Calcaires de Beauce aquifer, as shown by the summer energy balance.

These interventions took place within the Plan Loire Grandeur Nature and consisted of the following points: the protection of the inhabitants against flooding risks (opening of the secondary channels), the preservation of the ecological assets and the elimination of the sinking of the water line at it's lower level. This research occurred in a specific part of the Loire riverbed, which is situated between Nevers and Orleans (on both banks). We tried by using a geomorphologic analysis to put in evidence the impact of the interventions on the evolution of the secondary channels and dikes. The Geographical Information System (GIS) put in place for the studies sector helps the space analysis by the superposition and the comparison of the different layers of information. This information tool helps creating a database, which can be updated and extended. This way, the managers of this site can easily integrate new thematic (ecological, pedagogical, tourism activityâ¦) and benefit from a precise mapping of the intervention's areas and the impact of the restoration works. The main objective of the PhD is to analyse the functioning of hydrological and fluvial dynamics of the river bed of the Middle Loire, particularly in areas covered by maintenance work. These fluvial engineering works aim to improve flow and transfer of sediment in the river bed. This approach will evaluate the effectiveness of such maintenance work. It is necessary to set up a very fine scale model to quantify sediment transfer between secondary and main channels. The situation of secondary channels is contrasted, but the excessive growth of vegetation in some channels triggers their perennial functioning. The fine scale analysis is based on studies on seasonal and inter-annual evolution of secondary channels. Digital Elevation models (DEM), longitudinal profiles and topographic cross-sections integrated GIS help to quantify\n\nBeaver lodge location on the upstream Loire River.\n\nPubMed\n\nFustec, JoÃ«lle; Cormier, Jean-Paul; LodÃ©, Thierry\n\n2003-08-01\n\nIn the part of the Loire River recently colonized by Eurasian beavers, we compared habitat characteristics among sites with lodges, sites with cut trees and sites without beaver. The absence of sandbank and canopy cover (by 10-15-m tall trees, by tall Salicaceae, and by bushy Salicaceae) appeared as good predictors for lodge settling. Based on this model, the number of proper lodge sites was estimated for the next downstream 36 kilometers stretch. The number of favourable sites decreases as anthropization increases.\n\nSpatial distribution of living (Rose Bengal stained) benthic foraminifera in the Loire estuary (western France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMojtahid, M.; Geslin, E.; Coynel, A.; Gorse, L.; Vella, C.; Davranche, A.; Zozzolo, L.; Blanchet, L.; BÃ©nÃ©teau, E.; Maillet, G.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nNinety-seven surface sediment samples were collected in September 2012 from intertidal and subtidal areas along the Loire estuary (western France). The main objective of this work is to study the spatial distributional patterns of living benthic foraminifera and their link to the environmental parameters (distance to sea, elevation, grain size, total organic carbon, trace metals, sedimentary carbonates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in the Loire estuary. Foraminiferal analysis was also extended to the dead assemblages in thirty-three surface samples from the lower inner estuary. The highest absolute densities of living benthic foraminifera are found in the lower inner estuary within the polyhaline domain. This is attributed to the presence of mudflats with abundant food source, i.e. microphytobenthos. The low densities found in the outer estuary (euhaline domain) are attributed partly to the sandy nature of the sediments and the food source inhabiting this substrate. The near absence of foraminifera in the inner estuary (mesohaline and polyhaline domains) is inferred to the physical disturbance resulting from the regular dredging of the navigation channel. The living assemblages are dominated by three typical estuarine species: Ammonia tepida and Haynesina germanica in the intertidal mudflats of the lower inner estuary and Cribroelphidium excavatum in the sandy subtidal sediments of the lower inner and outer estuary. In the Loire estuary, H. germanica has an unusual intermediate geographical distribution along the estuary between A. tepida and C. excavatum while in most temperate estuaries this species is present upstream in the mesohaline domain. This is most likely the result of the regular dredging of the navigation channel damaging its natural habitat. This might be also the explanation for the total absence of agglutinated species usually dominating the oligohaline domain. The canonical correspondence analysis shows that elevation (and its link to time\n\nSuspended particulate matter determines physical speciation of Fe, Mn, and trace metals in surface waters of Loire watershed.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaalousha, Mohamed; Stoll, Serge; Motelica-Heino, MikaÃ«l; Guigues, Nathalie; Braibant, Gilles; Huneau, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Le Coustumer, Philippe\n\n2018-02-10\n\nThis study investigates the spatiotemporal variability of major and trace elements, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in surface waters of several hydrosystems of the Loire River watershed in France. In particular, this study aims to delineate the impact of the abovementioned water physicochemical parameters on natural iron and manganese physical speciation (homoaggregation/heteroaggregation) among fine colloidal and dissolved (<â10Â nm), colloidal (10-450Â nm) and particulate (>â450Â nm) phases in Loire River watershed. Results show that the chemistry of the Loire River watershed is controlled by two end members: magmatic and metamorphic petrographic context on the upper part of the watershed; and sedimentary rocks for the middle and low part of the Loire. The percentage of particulate Fe and Mn increased downstream concurrent with the increase in SPM and major cations concentration, whereas the percentage of colloidal Fe and Mn decreased downstream. Transmission electron microscopy analyses of the colloidal and particulate fractions (from the non-filtered water sample) revealed that heteroaggregation of Fe and Mn rich natural nanoparticles and natural organic matter to the particulate phase is the dominant mechanism. The heteroaggregation controls the partitioning of Fe and Mn in the different fractions, potentially due to the increase in the ionic strength, and divalent cations concentration downstream, and SPM concentration. These findings imply that SPM concentration plays an important role in controlling the fate and behavior of Fe and Mn in various sized fractions.

Alongside, the Nitrates Directives (91/676/EEC) aims at controlling nitrogen pollution and requires Member States to identify groundwaters that contain more than 50 mg NO3 L-1 or could exceed this limit if preventive measures are not taken. In order to achieve these environmental objectives in the Loire-Brittany river basin, or to justify the non achievement of these objectives, a large dataset of nitrate concentrations (117.056 raw data distributed on 7.341 time-series) and water table level time-series (1.371.655 data distributed on 511 piezometers) is analysed from 1945 to 2007. The 156.700 sq km Loire-Brittany river basin shows various hydrogeological contexts, ranging from sedimentary aquifers to basement ones, with a few volcanic-rock aquifers. The knowledge of the evolution of agricultural practices is important in such a study and, even if this information is not locally available, agricultural practices have globally changed since the 1991 Nitrates Directives. The detailed dataset available for the Loire-Brittany basin aquifers is used to evaluate tools and to propose efficient methodologies for identifying and quantifying past and current trends in nitrate concentrations. Therefore, the challenge of this study is to propose a global and integrated approach which allows nitrate trend identifications for the whole Loire-Brittany river basin. The temporal piezometric behaviour of each aquifer is defined using geostatistical analyse of water table level time-series. This method requires the calculation of an experimental temporal variogram that can be fitted with a theoretical model valid for a large time range. Identification of contrasted behaviours (short term, annual or pluriannual water table fluctuations) allows a systematic classification of the Loire\n\nVg mRNA induction in an endangered fish species (Anguilla anguilla) from the Loire estuary (France).\n\nPubMed\n\nBlanchet-LetrouvÃ©, Isabelle; Lafont, Anne-GaÃ«lle; Poirier, Laurence; Baloche, Sylvie; Zalouk-Vergnoux, Aurore; Dufour, Sylvie; Mouneyrac, Catherine\n\n2013-11-01\n\nEstuarine zones are extremely fragile due to increasing stress from anthropogenic activities. Among those, the Loire estuary (France) is potentially exposed to various contaminants including Endocrine Disruptors Compounds (EDCs) able to impact the reproduction physiology of fish. The European eel (Anguilla anguilla), endangered fish species, is apparently not relevant, in its yellow stage, to monitor the effects of endocrine disruption. Despite this weakly responsiveness, this study aimed to investigate whether European eel from the Loire estuary may still be the subject of estrogenic disruption quantifying the hepatic Vg gene expression according to gender and sexual stage. Vitellogenin (Vg) appears as a valuable biomarker of EDCs, as well as for exposure and effects. Quantitative real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (q RT PCR) was used in this study to amplify responses of hepatic Vg transcripts. European eels were sampled in May 2009 (N=57) and November 2010 (during the downstream migration, N=10) in two sites of the Loire estuary with different ecological conditions and contamination pressures (upstream: Varades; downstream: Nantes). Reproductive (gender, sexual maturity stage) and biometric parameters of collected eels were determined. A laboratory exposure of silver male to steroid hormones (Testosterone (T), 11-KetoTestosterone (11-KT), Estradiol (E2)) was conducted in parallel to validate the q RT PCR approach on hepatic Vg mRNA. Results demonstrated the responsiveness of exposed silver male eels, since hepatic mRNA Vg induction was observed in E2 treated males compared to control specimens. In the field, results of female silver eels reflected large inter-individual differences in the activation of hepatic Vg at silvering. However, while only female silver eels should express hepatic Vg mRNA, quantifiable levels were also detected in a proportion of 38% of the other individuals sampled, normally not inclined to express it, those being\n\nMeasuring fallout radionuclides to constrain the origin and the dynamics of suspended sediment in an agricultural drained catchment (Loire River basin, France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLe Gall, Marion; Evrard, Olivier; Foucher, Anthony; Laceby, J. Patrick; Salvador-Blanes, SÃ©bastien; LefÃ¨vre, IrÃ¨ne; Cerdan, Olivier; Ayrault, Sophie\n\n2015-04-01\n\nSoil erosion reaches problematic levels in agricultural areas of Northwestern Europe where tile drains may accelerate sediment transfer to rivers. This supply of large quantities of fine sediment to the river network leads to the degradation of water quality by increasing water turbidity, filling reservoirs and transporting contaminants. Agricultural patterns and landscapes features have been largely modified by human activities during the last century. To investigate erosion and sediment transport in lowland drained areas, a small catchment, the Louroux (24 kmÂ²), located in the French Loire River basin was selected. In this catchment, channels have been reshaped and more than 220 tile drains outlets have been installed after World War II. As a result, soil erosion and sediment fluxes strongly increased. Sediment supply needs to be better understood by quantifying the contribution of sources and the residence times of particles within the catchment. To this end, a network of river monitoring stations was installed, and fallout radionuclides (Cs-137, excess Pb-210 and Be-7) were measured in rainwater (n=3), drain tile outlets (n=4), suspended sediment (n=15), soil surface (n=30) and channel bank samples (n=15) between January 2013 and February 2014. Cs-137 concentrations were used to quantify the contribution of surface vs. subsurface sources of sediment. Results show a clear dominance of particles originating from surface sources (99 Â± 1%). Be-7 and excess Pb-210 concentrations and calculation of Be-7/excess Pb-210 ratios in rainfall and suspended sediment samples were used to estimate percentages of recently eroded sediment in rivers. The first erosive winter storm mainly exported sediment depleted in Be-7 that likely deposited on the riverbed during the previous months. Then, during the subsequent floods, sediment was directly eroded and exported to the catchment outlet. Our results show the added value of combining spatial and temporal tracers to characterize\n\nPresent-day palynomorph deposits in an estuarine context: The case of the Loire Estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGanne, A.; Leroyer, C.; Penaud, A.; Mojtahid, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEstuaries are dynamic systems that collect terrestrial, aerial, fluvial, and marine inputs, including organic microfossils, which, when fossilized and observed on palynological slides, are also referred to as palynomorphs (pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs including dinoflagellate cysts or dinocysts). To understand these organic microfossil deposit arrangements across the Loire estuary, palynomorph counts were undertaken in 31 surface sediments collected across longitudinal and perpendicular transects of the Loire active riverbed, from the upper inner estuary to the river mouth. Main results suggest a large homogeneity of the pollen content throughout the entire upstream-downstream transect, with a dominance of arboreal taxa (Pinus, Quercus, Alnus) and Poaceae. Also, perpendicular transects across the channel show a great similarity between the muddy surface layers and the underlying consolidated clay layers. This is probably due to: i) homogeneity of the landscape at a regional scale (large catchment area of the Loire River), and ii) complex hydrodynamic processes involving strong mixing of the palynological signal. Furthermore, despite scarce woodlands in the regional landscape, arboreal pollen (especially Pinus and Quercus) represents > 60% of the total pollen percentages. This could be explained by several factors: i) generally higher arboreal pollen production and dispersion as compared to herbaceous taxa, ii) distant inputs from marine areas downstream and/or forested regions far upstream, and iii) differential selection or inheritance from underlying sediments. Differentiation between the outer and inner estuarine environments was furthermore possible using a ratio of terrestrial versus marine palynological indicators. Among the dinocyst assemblages (marine realm), the euryhaline species Lingulodinium machaerophorum predominates; this taxon being very sensitive to strong water column stratification. Also, total dinocyst concentration increased upstream\n\nHistorical sea level data rescue to assess long-term sea level evolution: Saint-Nazaire observatory (Loire estuary, France) since 1863.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFerret, Yann; Voineson, Guillaume; Pouvreau, Nicolas\n\n2014-05-01\n\nNowadays, the study of the global sea level rise is a strong societal concern. The analysis of historical records of water level proves to be an ideal way to provide relevant arguments regarding the observed trends. In France, many systematic sea level observations have taken place since the mid-1800s. Despite this rich history, long sea level data sets digitally available are still scarce. Currently, only the time series of Brest, Marseille and recently the composite one of the Pertuis d'Antioche span periods longer than a century and are available to be taken into account in studies dealing with long term sea-level evolution. In this context, an important work of \"data archaeology\" is undertaken to rescue the numerous existing analog historical data that is part of the French scientific and cultural heritage. The present study is focused on the measurements carried out at the sea level observatory of Saint-Nazaire, located on the French Atlantic coast in the Loire estuary mouth area. Measurements were automatically performed with the use of float tide gauges from 1863 to 2007, but include some important gaps between 1920 and 1950. Since 2007, the Saint-Nazaire observatory is part of the French RONIM network operated by SHOM, and the old mechanical tide gauge has been superseded by a radar tide gauge (operated by \"Grand Port Maritime\" of Nantes-Saint-Nazaire). In total, the covered period is up to 150-year-long, including at least 125 years of continuous sea level measurements. With the reconstruction of this new data set, we aim at improving our knowledge on trends in sea level components on the Atlantic coast on large scale and on the coast vulnerability at more local scale. Moreover, because of the location of the station, it should be possible as well to study the influence of the Loire River on water level since the 19th century. It has been shown that the tidal range was strongly modified during the last century because of the anthropogenic influence along\n\n[Parent satisfaction with the Loire Infant Follow-up Team (LIFT) premature and at-risk infant network in the Pays-de-la-Loire area (France)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBranger, B; Rouger, V; Beucher, A; Bouderlique, C; Blayo, S; Le Mauff, E; Roze, J-C; Moret, L; PaillÃ©-Ricolleau, C; N'guyen, S; Winer, N\n\n2010-10-01\n\nThe Loire Infant Follow-up Team (LIFT) is a network for caring for premature infants whose gestational age is 34 WA or less and at-risk neonates in the Pays-de-la-Loire area in France. The network aims to screen for clinical anomalies early and to propose adapted care. Trained physicians follow the included children in a standardized manner at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months and 2 years, with a specific examination by psychologists at 2 years. The aim of the study was to assess the satisfaction of the parents of the children followed. To evaluate parent satisfaction, a questionnaire from the Consumer Satisfaction Survey (CSS) in its French version was sent to parents whose infants were 2 years old, stratifying on the presence of an anomaly. The questioner had 39 items, with 8 specific items on the network and 31 from the CSS. The questionnaire was mailed twice in September 2006. Out of 300 questionnaires mailed, 269 were returned (rate 89.7 %). The questionnaire was assessed using principal component analysis with 2 dimensions for the 30 items common to all children, one of which covered empathy with physicians and the other with the consulting psychologists at 2 years. The validity was good (Cronbach coefficient, 0.91). The answers to overall questions such as \"We are satisfied with the care in the network\" scored 16.1Â±0.7/20, with 90 % \"totally agree\" or \"moderately agree\" responses. The \"The care is perfect\" scored 14.6Â±0.7/20 with 78 % agreeing with the statement. The total score for 30 general questions was 14.6Â±3.1 (median, 14.9). The total score was lower for infants with anomalies: 13.7Â±3.3 versus 14.9Â±2.9 (P<0.01). The answers with a low score (<10) were given by 22 parents (8.2 %). There was no significant relation between the total score or the satisfaction score and neonatal events. A postal survey is helpful to know the views of parents on the follow-up of their infants. This good level of satisfaction seems to stem from the parents feeling they belong\n\n[Aborting women social characteristics: a study in Maine-et-Loire region (France) in 2007].\n\nPubMed\n\nChalain, S; Bouzille, G; Bouquet, E; Fougas, J-L; Tanguy, M; Fournier, A; Fanello, S\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThe number of voluntary termination of pregnancies (VTOP) in the district of Maine-et-Loire (France) has been slightly increasing in the last ten years but the rate of childbearing age seems to be stable as it is on a national or regional data. The aborting women in this district seem to be representative of French women terminating pregnancy regarding sociodemographical, gynaecological and contraception criteria. When they come to abort, the terms of the pregnant women are also representative. But if we compare the three family planning clinics of this department, we realise that the psycho-social interview is not equally carried out. In these three centres, there is the same proportion of medication abortion (as on a national and regional scale) but much less surgical abortion under general anaesthetic in Cholet (3.9%) than in Angers (27.7%) or Saumur (64.2%). The regional rate was of 30% and the national one of 65%. The explanation is the lack of time slot for general anaesthetics in Cholet and Angers. The majority of these women used a contraception method to avoid unwanted pregnancies but we observe a lot of failures due to natural methods and condoms (especially with young people). School prevention as well as prevention on a larger population of women and couples must be comprehensive and carried out seriously. It is essential to train doctors sufficiently and regularly on the questions of contraception in general (methods, instructionsâ¦). Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The area influenced by river plume showed a different SST when compared with the adjacent oceanic area for the months when the plume attains its highest extension (December, January, and February). Ocean was observed to warm at a rate of approximately 0.3ÂºC dec-1 while temperature at the area influenced by the rivers cooled at a rate of -0.15ÂºC dec-1 over the period 1982-2014. The mere presence of a freshwater layer is able to modulate the warming observed at adjacent ocean locations since the coastal area is isolated from the rest of the Bay. This nearshore strip is the only part of the Bay where changes in SST depend on North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) but not on North Atlantic SST represented by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). These different cooling-warming trends are even more patent over the last years (2002-2014) under atmospheric favorable conditions for plume enhancement. River runoff increased at a rate on the order of 120 m3s-1dec-1 over that period and southwesterly winds, which favor the confinement of the plume, showed a positive and significant trend both in duration and intensity. Thus, the coastal strip has been observed to cool at a rate of -0.5Â°C dec-1.\n\nQUAL-NET, a high temporal-resolution eutrophication model for large hydrographic networks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMinaudo, Camille; Curie, Florence; Jullian, Yann; Gassama, Nathalie; Moatar, Florentina\n\n2018-04-01\n\nTo allow climate change impact assessment of water quality in river systems, the scientific community lacks efficient deterministic models able to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes in drainage networks at the regional scale, with high temporal resolution and water temperature explicitly determined. The model QUALity-NETwork (QUAL-NET) was developed and tested on the Middle Loire River Corridor, a sub-catchment of the Loire River in France, prone to eutrophication. Hourly variations computed efficiently by the model helped disentangle the complex interactions existing between hydrological and biological processes across different timescales. Phosphorus (P) availability was the most constraining factor for phytoplankton development in the Loire River, but simulating bacterial dynamics in QUAL-NET surprisingly evidenced large amounts of organic matter recycled within the water column through the microbial loop, which delivered significant fluxes of available P and enhanced phytoplankton growth. This explained why severe blooms still occur in the Loire River despite large P input reductions since 1990. QUAL-NET could be used to study past evolutions or predict future trajectories under climate change and land use scenarios.\n\nOutlier detection for groundwater data in France\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nValmy, Larissa; de Fouquet, Chantal; Bourgine, Bernard\n\n2014-05-01\n\nQuality and quantity water in France are increasingly observed since the 70s. Moreover, in 2000, the EU Water Framework Directive established a framework for community action in the water policy field for the protection of inland surface waters (rivers and lakes), transitional waters (estuaries), coastal waters and groundwater. It will ensure that all aquatic ecosystems and, with regard to their water needs, terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands meet 'good status' by 2015. The Directive requires Member States to establish river basin districts and for each of these a river basin management plan. In France, monitoring programs for the water status were implemented in each basin since 2007. The data collected through these programs feed into an information system which contributes to check the compliance of water environmental legislation implementation, assess the status of water guide management actions (programs of measures) and evaluate their effectiveness, and inform the public. Our work consists in study quality and quantity groundwater data for some basins in France. We propose a specific mathematical approach in order to detect outliers and study trends in time series. In statistic, an outlier is an observation that lies outside the overall pattern of a distribution. Usually, the presence of an outlier indicates some sort of problem, thus, it is important to detect it in order to know the cause. In fact, techniques for temporal data analysis have been developed for several decades in parallel with geostatistical methods. However compared to standard statistical methods, geostatistical analysis allows incomplete or irregular time series analysis. Otherwise, tests carried out by the BRGM showed the potential contribution of geostatistical methods for characterization of environmental data time series. Our approach is to exploit this potential through the development of specific algorithms, tests and validation of methods. We will introduce and explain our method\n\nStructure of the population and secondary production of Hediste diversicolor (O.F. MÃ¼ller, 1776), (Polychaeta, Nereidae) in the Loire estuary, Atlantic Coast, France\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGillet, P.; Torresani, S.\n\n2003-03-01\n\nA survey was carried out from April 1998 to June 2000 to study the structure of the population and the secondary production of Hediste diversicolor (Copenhagen 32 (1776) 274) in the Loire estuary, Atlantic coast of France. Each month, samples were collected in the intertidal zone of the Mindin harbour. In 1999, the mean annual density was 900Â±594 individuals (ind.) m -2 with a minimum of 304 ind. m -2 in February and a maximum of 2560 ind. m -2 in April. The mean annual biomass (dry weight) was BÂ¯=9.1 g m -2 with a minimum of 1.2 g m -2 in January and a maximum of 26.0 g m -2 in July 1999. The density and the biomass of the population of H. diversicolor decreased during winter and increased during spring/summer. Size frequency histograms allowed the analysis of cohorts and gave the growth curves. Two recruitment periods were detected each year, in June/July and October. The secondary production was estimated by the method of Crisp (Methods for the study of marine benthos, Blackwell, Oxford, 1971). From June 1998 to May 1999, P=5.1 g m-2 with BÂ¯=4.6 g m-2 and the ratio P/ BÂ¯=1.1 and from June 1999 to May 2000, P=34.4 g m-2 with BÂ¯=9.6 g m-2 and P/ BÂ¯=3.6 . The annual secondary production in 1999 was P=32.5 g m-2 with BÂ¯=9.1 g m-2 and P/ BÂ¯=3.6 . The differences observed between the 1986-1988 and 1998-2000 populations of H. diversicolor in the Loire estuary are discussed and could be explained by environmental changes, as competition or by migration of individuals.\n\nImpacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle over France and associated uncertainties\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDayon, Gildas; BoÃ©, Julien; Martin, Ãric; Gailhard, JoÃ«l\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis study deals with the evolution of the hydrological cycle over France during the 21st century. A large multi-member, multi-scenario, and multi-model ensemble of climate projections is downscaled with a new statistical method to drive a physically-based hydrological model with recent improvements. For a business-as-usual scenario, annual precipitation changes generally remain small, except over southern France, where decreases close to 20% are projected. Annual streamflows roughly decrease by 10% (Â±20%) on the Seine, by 20% (Â±20%) on the Loire, by 20% (Â±15%) on the Rhone and by 40% (Â±15%) on the Garonne. Attenuation measures, as implied by the other scenarios analyzed, lead to less severe changes. However, even with a scenario generally compatible with a limitation of global warming to two degrees, some notable impacts may still occur, with for example a decrease in summer river flows close to 25% for the Garonne.\n\nThe role of flooding in the occurrence of sinkholes in mantled karst setting, OrlÃ©ans area (France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNoury, Gildas; Perrin, Jerome; Luu, Li-Hua; Philippe, Pierre\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Loire River basin is regularly impacted by sinkholes because of its specific geological context constituted of karstic limestone overlain by soft materials. Intense rainfall and associated flooding that occurred in this area in May and June 2016 triggered the collapse of tens of sinkholes. At least 20 houses, one high-traffic road, one levee of the Loire River and one highway were directly threatened. This event highlights not only the vulnerability of the area, especially in the case of a disastrous flood of the Loire River, but also an unexpected kinetic of the process. Two different types of sinkholes occurred in flooded areas: on the plateau, spectacular drop out of former natural caves is suspected; in the Loire valley, flooding is supposed to have accelerated the suffosion of alluvium by a factor of 10 000 to 20 000. This feedback bring new insights on the process dynamics that is currently being analysed in more details using an innovative internal erosion numerical modeling approach, based on Discrete Element - DEM and Lattice Boltzmann methods - LBM. A better understanding of the sinkhole formation is crucial for adequate risk management, especially in the case of a large flooding event.\n\nLoire and Gironde turbid plumes: Characterization and influence on thermohaline properties\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCostoya, X.; FernÃ¡ndez-NÃ³voa, D.; deCastro, M.; GÃ³mez-Gesteira, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nKnowledge and predictability of turbid river plumes is of great importance because they modulate the properties of the seawater adjacent to river mouths. The Loire and Gironde Rivers form the most important plumes in the Bay of Biscay, as they provide > 75% of total runoff. The development of the turbid plume under the influence of its main drivers was analyzed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data from the period 2003-2015. River discharge was found to be the main driver, followed by wind, which also had an important effect in modulating the turbid plume during periods of high river discharge. Seaward and upwelling favorable winds enhanced the dispersion of plumes on seawater, whereas landward and downwelling favorable winds limited mixing with the adjacent ocean water. The maximum extension of the turbid plume was reached under landward winds. In addition, the spatio-temporal evolution of the East Atlantic pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation was observed to affect the dynamics of plumes: positive values of both indices favored a greater extension of the plume. Thermohaline properties differed inside and outside the area affected by both rivers. In particular, these rivers maintain winter stratification inside the turbid plume, which results in a different warming ratio when compared with the adjacent ocean.\n\nSpace Radar Image of Rhine River, France and Germany\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1999-04-15\n\nThis spaceborne radar image shows a segment of the Rhine River where it forms the border between the Alsace region of northeastern France on the left and the Black Forest region of Germany on the right.\n\nDiverse Approaches to Implement and Monitor River Restoration: A Comparative Perspective in France and Germany\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorandi, Bertrand; Kail, Jochem; Toedter, Anne; Wolter, Christian; PiÃ©gay, HervÃ©\n\n2017-11-01\n\nRiver restoration is a main emphasis of river management in European countries. Cross-national comparisons of its implementation are still rare in scientific literature. Based on French and German national censuses, this study compares river restoration practices and monitoring by analysing 102 French and 270 German projects. This comparison aims to draw a spatial and temporal framework of restoration practices in both countries to identify potential drivers of cross-national similarities and differences. The results underline four major trends: (1) a lag of almost 15 years in river restoration implementation between France and Germany, with a consequently higher share of projects in Germany than in France, (2) substantial similarities in restored reach characteristics, short reach length, small rivers, and in \"agricultural\" areas, (3) good correspondences between stressors identified and restoration measures implemented. Morphological alterations were the most important highlighted stressors. River morphology enhancement, especially instream enhancements, were the most frequently implemented restoration measures. Some differences exist in specific restoration practices, as river continuity restoration were most frequently implemented in French projects, while large wood introduction or channel re-braiding were most frequently implemented in German projects, and (4) some quantitative and qualitative differences in monitoring practices and a significant lack of project monitoring, especially in Germany compared to France. These similarities and differences between Germany and France in restoration application and monitoring possibly result from a complex set of drivers that might be difficult to untangle (e.g., environmental, technical, political, cultural).\n\nDiverse Approaches to Implement and Monitor River Restoration: A Comparative Perspective in France and Germany.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorandi, Bertrand; Kail, Jochem; Toedter, Anne; Wolter, Christian; PiÃ©gay, HervÃ©\n\n2017-11-01\n\nRiver restoration is a main emphasis of river management in European countries. Cross-national comparisons of its implementation are still rare in scientific literature. Based on French and German national censuses, this study compares river restoration practices and monitoring by analysing 102 French and 270 German projects. This comparison aims to draw a spatial and temporal framework of restoration practices in both countries to identify potential drivers of cross-national similarities and differences. The results underline four major trends: (1) a lag of almost 15 years in river restoration implementation between France and Germany, with a consequently higher share of projects in Germany than in France, (2) substantial similarities in restored reach characteristics, short reach length, small rivers, and in \"agricultural\" areas, (3) good correspondences between stressors identified and restoration measures implemented.

Knowing the alterations is of importance to better understand the biological and physical patterns along the river network. However data are not necessary available to carry out an analysis of modifications at a national scale, e.g. due to industrial interests or to lack of measurements. The objective of this study is to quantify the changes in a set of hydrological indices due to large reservoirs in France combining different data sources. The analysis is based on a comparison between influenced discharges (observed discharges) and natural discharges available from: (i) gauging stations available upstream the dam, (ii) regionalization procedures (Sauquet et al., 2008; Sauquet et Catalogne, 2011; Cipriani et al., 2012), or (iii) historical data free from human influence close to the dam location. The impact of large reservoirs is assessed considering different facets of the river flow regime, including flood quantiles, low flow characteristics, quantiles from the flow duration curve and the twelve mean monthly discharges. The departures from the indice representative of natural conditions quantify the effect of the reservoir management on the river flow regime. The analysis is based on 62 study cases. Results show large spread in terms of impact depending on the purposes of the reservoirs and the season of interest. Results also point out inconsistencies in data (water balance between outflow and inflow, downstream of the dam is not warranted) due to uncertainties in mean monthly discharges and to the imperfect knowledge of inflows and outflows. Lastly, we suggest a typology of hydrological alterations based on the purposes of the reservoirs. Cipriani T., Toilliez T., Sauquet E. (2012).

In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the anthropogenic overprints on element geochemistry in sediments of the human-impacted Seine River, France. Most elements are fractionated by grain size, as shown by the comparison between suspended particulate matter (SPM) and riverbank deposits (RBD). The RBD are particularly coarse and enriched in carbonates and heavy minerals and thus in elements such as Ba, Ca, Cr, Hf, Mg, Na, REEs, Sr, Ti, Th, and Zr. Although the enrichment/depletion pattern of some elements (e.g., K, REEs, and Zr) can largely be explained by a binary mixture between two sources, other elements such as Ag, Bi, Cr, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, W, and Zn in SPM in Paris show that a third end-member having anthropogenic characteristics is needed to account for their enrichment at low water stage. These \"anthropophile\" elements, with high enrichment factors (EFs) relative to the upper continental crust (UCC), display a progressive enrichment downstream and different geochemical behaviors with respect to the hydrodynamic conditions (e.g., grain size) compared to elements having mainly a natural origin. Our findings emphasize the need for systematic studies of these anthropophile elements in other human-impacted rivers using geochemical normalization techniques, and stress the importance of studying the chemical variability associated with hydrodynamic conditions when characterizing riverine element geochemistry and assessing their flux to the ocean.\n\nThe water footprint of agricultural products in European river basins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVanham, D.; Bidoglio, G.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThis work quantifies the agricultural water footprint (WF) of production (WFprod, agr) and consumption (WFcons, agr) and the resulting net virtual water import (netVWi, agr) of 365 European river basins for a reference period (REF, 1996-2005) and two diet scenarios (a healthy diet based upon food-based dietary guidelines (HEALTHY) and a vegetarian (VEG) diet). In addition to total (tot) amounts, a differentiation is also made between the green (gn), blue (bl) and grey (gy) components. River basins where the REF WFcons, agr, tot exceeds the WFprod, agr, tot (resulting in positive netVWi, agr, tot values), are found along the London-Milan axis. These include the Thames, Scheldt, Meuse, Seine, Rhine and Po basins. River basins where the WFprod, agr, tot exceeds the WFcons, agr, tot are found in Western France, the Iberian Peninsula and the Baltic region. These include the Loire, Ebro and Nemunas basins. Under the HEALTHY diet scenario, the WFcons, agr, tot of most river basins decreases (max -32%), although it was found to increase in some basins in northern and eastern Europe. This results in 22 river basins, including the Danube, shifting from being net VW importers to being net VW exporters. A reduction (max -46%) in WFcons, agr, tot is observed for all but one river basin under the VEG diet scenario. In total, 50 river basins shift from being net VW importers to being net exporters, including the Danube, Seine, Rhone and Elbe basins. Similar observations are made when only the gn + bl and gn components are assessed. When analysing only the bl component, a different river basin pattern is observed.\n\nImpacts of river management on low energy rivers in Normandy (France) over 3000 years, first results of a geomorphological and geoarchaeological approach.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeauchamp, Axel; Lespez, Laurent; Le Gaillard, Ludovic; Bernard, Vincent; Delahaye, Daniel\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe European Water Framework Directive (WFD), issued in 2000 has the objective of improving the quality of water and aquatic environments. In France, the application of this law requires the dismantling and razing of structures built across waterways (mill valve, mill damâ¦) which no longer have any use today. The first archaeological results in Normandy show evidence of river management since the Iron Age (800 BC.). They also show that during the last 4000 years, floodplains have been affected by a significant vertical aggradation resulting from soil erosion in the catchment related to the development of agro- pastoral activities. However, these results say nothing about consequences of the proliferation of mill dams for hydrosedimentary flow for low energy rivers and their role in the development of sedimentary stocks in valley beds. The aim of this work is to measure the impact of the implementation of major hydraulic structures (mill inlet, mill dam, millrace, mill valve, drainage ditches...) on the rivers functioning in the past millennia to (1) propose a long term modeling Human/Ecosystem interaction for Lower-Normandy river systems and (2) to anticipate the geomorphological consequences related to dam-removal policy. This research is based on study sites located in the valley bed, most of them have been investigated by archaeologists and have revealed old hydraulic structures. Today, five sites have been identified in varied archaeological and hydromorphological contexts. Trenching was carried out upstream and downstream of hydraulic structures to uncover the Holocene sedimentary infilling of the valley floor. First results from the antique and medieval sites Montaigu-la-Brisette (Manche, FRANCE ) and Colomby (Manche, FRANCE ) show the influence of river management on the evolution of sedimentation in valley bed.\n\nFine-scale human genetic structure in Western France.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarakachoff, Matilde; Duforet-Frebourg, Nicolas; Simonet, Floriane; Le Scouarnec, Solena; Pellen, Nadine; Lecointe, Simon; Charpentier, Eric; Gros, FranÃ§oise; Cauchi, StÃ©phane; Froguel, Philippe; Copin, Nane; Le Tourneau, Thierry; Probst, Vincent; Le Marec, HervÃ©; Molinaro, Sabrina; Balkau, Beverley; Redon, Richard; Schott, Jean-Jacques; Blum, Michael Gb; Dina, Christian\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe difficulties arising from association analysis with rare variants underline the importance of suitable reference population cohorts, which integrate detailed spatial information. We analyzed a sample of 1684 individuals from Western France, who were genotyped at genome-wide level, from two cohorts D.E.S.I.R and CavsGen. We found that fine-scale population structure occurs at the scale of Western France, with distinct admixture proportions for individuals originating from the Brittany Region and the VendÃ©e Department. Genetic differentiation increases with distance at a high rate in these two parts of Northwestern France and linkage disequilibrium is higher in Brittany suggesting a lower effective population size. When looking for genomic regions informative about Breton origin, we found two prominent associated regions that include the lactase region and the HLA complex. For both the lactase and the HLA regions, there is a low differentiation between Bretons and Irish, and this is also found at the genome-wide level. At a more refined scale, and within the Pays de la Loire Region, we also found evidence of fine-scale population structure, although principal component analysis showed that individuals from different departments cannot be confidently discriminated. Because of the evidence for fine-scale genetic structure in Western France, we anticipate that rare and geographically localized variants will be identified in future full-sequence analyses.\n\nImproving representation of riparian vegetation shading in a regional stream temperature model using LiDAR data.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoicq, Pierre; Moatar, Florentina; Jullian, Yann; Dugdale, Stephen J; Hannah, David M\n\n2018-05-15\n\nModelling river temperature at the catchment scale is needed to understand how aquatic communities may adapt to current and projected climate change. In small and medium rivers, riparian vegetation can greatly reduce maximum water temperature by providing shade. It is thus important that river temperature models are able to correctly characterise the impact of this riparian shading. In this study, we describe the use of a spatially-explicit method using LiDAR-derived data for computing the riparian shading on direct and diffuse solar radiation. The resulting data are used in the T-NET one-dimensional stream temperature model to simulate water temperature from August 2007 to July 2014 for 270km of the Loir River, an indirect tributary of the Loire River (France). Validation is achieved with 4 temperature monitoring stations spread along the Loir River. The vegetation characterised with the LiDAR approach provides a cooling effect on maximum daily temperature (T max ) ranging from 3.0Â°C (upstream) to 1.3Â°C (downstream) in late August 2009. Compared to two other riparian shading routines that are less computationally-intensive, the use of our LiDAR-based methodology improves the bias of T max simulated by the T-NET model by 0.62Â°C on average between April and September. However, difference between the shading routines reaches up to 2Â°C (monthly average) at the upstream-most station. Standard deviation of errors on T max is not improved. Computing the impact of riparian vegetation at the hourly timescale using reach-averaged parameters provides results close to the LiDAR-based approach, as long as it is supplied with accurate vegetation cover data. Improving the quality of riparian vegetation data should therefore be a priority to increase the accuracy of stream temperature modelling at the regional scale. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Water resources are under high pressure due to significant water abstractions for human uses within and out of the natural boundaries of the river basin through an extended open channel network. Water demands are related to irrigation, hydropower, drinking water, industries and more recently water management has included water needs for recreational uses as well as for preserving ecological services. Water is crucial for all these activities and for the socio-economic development of South Eastern France. Both socio-economic development and population evolution will probably modify needs for water supply, irrigation, energy consumption, tourism, industry, etc. In addition the Durance river basin will have to face climate change and its impact on water availability that may question the sustainability of the current rules for water allocation. The research project RÂ²DÂ²-2050 \"Risk, water Resources and sustainable Development within the Durance river basin in 2050\" aims at assessing future water availability and risks of water shortage in the 2050s by taking into account changes in both climate and water management. RÂ²DÂ²-2050 is partially funded by the French Ministry in charge of Ecology and the RhÃ´ne-MÃ©diterranÃ©e Water Agency. This multidisciplinary project (2010-2014) involves Irstea, ElectricitÃ© de France (EDF), the University Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris), LTHE (CNRS), the SociÃ©tÃ© du Canal de Provence (SCP) and the research and consultancy company ACTeon. A set of models have been developed to simulate climate at regional scale (given by 330 projections obtained by applying three downscaling methods), water resources (provided by seven rainfall-runoff models forced by a subset of 330 climate projections), water demand for agriculture and drinking water, for different sub basins of the Durance River basin upstream of Mallemort under present day and under future conditions\n\n[Survey of 319Â women satisfaction using abortion in centers of Pays de la Loire in France].\n\nPubMed\n\nBranger, B; David, P; Bonnet, B; Coutin, A-S; Collin, R\n\n2016-10-01\n\nPerinatal network the \"Security birth\" Pays de la Loire (RSN), in collaboration with the regional network \"Sexual health\" (RRSS) organized a satisfaction survey in 2014Â among women who had an induced abortion in the centers in Pays de la Loire. The objective of the study is to evaluate the satisfaction of women who resort to abortion centers, study the factors and propose actions for improvement. A questionnaire, developed with professionals, was offered to women after the end of the abortion act. The scales of satisfaction were based on Likert scales to 4Â degrees. They were collected for the period of contact centers, for the abortion itself, and overall. Data were collected on the civil status, the care pathway to get to the abortion center, features centers and professionals met, acts anesthesia and end of abortion, wait times and overall satisfaction of women. The women with rather poor satisfaction were compared with other women by univariate analysis with odds ratios (OR) and multivariate with adjusted odds ratios (ORa). Of the 18Â centers, 13Â participated and 319Â responses were analyzed. The abortions were performed on average 8Â±SA 2. Among the methods, 40.1Â % were drug, and 59.9Â % with anesthesia (14.0Â % with general anesthesia [AG] and 45.9Â % under local anesthesia [AL]). The first contacts on average to 5.7Â SA were mostly general practitioners (38Â %), then the abortion centers directly (22Â %), and planning centers (16Â %). The information was considered clear (94Â %), the appropriate orientation (97Â %), with respect to the application (98Â %). The first meeting at the center was done 7Â days after the call (6.7Â SA), and met women overall. The abortion was performed 16Â days after the first call center (8.0Â SA) with satisfaction by field 78Â % (waiting time) to 98Â % (confidentiality, privacyâ¦). The overall satisfaction rate was 89.0Â % and 8.2Â % were not satisfied. Factors related to the non-satisfaction in multivariate analysis were the\n\nSediment Transport Processes During Flood Events in the Middle LoireGauging and First Results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGautier, J.; Rodrigues, S.; Juge, P.; Peters, J.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nA hydraulic and sediment transport survey campaign was organised in March 2007 on the Loire River, at the BrÃ©hÃ©mont site. The aim was to collect data useful for the understanding of fluviomorphological mechanisms. A survey procedure, established at the end of the 1960's and relying on a follow-up bathymetric surveys and ancient sediments samplers was combined with modern technologies such as DGPS satellite positioning and ADCP flow gauging. The survey campaign allowed quantifying the sediment transport rates of the size fractions larger than 50 microns. The results confirm the earlier made hypothesis concerning the existence of a sediment load moving close to the bottom and distinct from the suspended load as described in the theories. This load was called \"morphological\" and is composed of solids having sizes between those of the river bed and those moving in suspension at higher elevations. This statement, made on the basis of surveys on other large streams in Africa, Asia and the America's questions the concepts on which have been based the majority of the sediment transport theories. The analysis shows also that the rate of bedload transport can be very high up to 60% in some verticals and nearly 50% on all a profil, that is much more than the rate usually admits. The present surveys show that campaigns as these are necessary in order to comprehend the processes, a condition prior to investigating solutions.\n\nSpace Radar Image of Rhine River, France and Germany\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis spaceborne radar image shows a segment of the Rhine River where it forms the border between the Alsace region of northeastern France on the left and the Black Forest region of Germany on the right. The Rhine, one of the largest and most used waterways in central Europe, winds its way through five countries from the Swiss-Austrian Alps to the North Sea coast of the Netherlands. The river valley is densely populated, as seen in this image, which shows the French city of Strasbourg, the light blue and orange area in the upper left center; and the German cities of Kehl, across the river from Strasbourg and Offenburg, the bright area in right center. The fertile valley is famous for its wine production and most of the agricultural areas in the image, shown in purple patches, are vineyards. The light green areas are forest. Scientists can use radar images like this one to monitor the effects of urban and agricultural development on sensitive ecosystems such as the Rhine River valley. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 2, 1994. The image is 34.2 kilometers by 33.2 kilometers (21.2 miles by 20.6 miles) and is centered at 48.5 degrees north latitude, 7.7 degrees east longitude. North is toward the upper left. The colors are assigned to different radar frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: red is L-band, horizontally transmitted and received; green is L-band, horizontally transmitted, vertically received; and blue is C-band, horizontally transmitted, vertically received. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program.\n\nIntegrated characterization of groundwater contamination in an alluvial system. Case study of Allier alluvial aquifer (Massif Central, France).\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMohammed, Nabaz; Celle-Jeanton, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Batisson, Isabelle; Bardot, Corinne; Colombet, Jonathan; Huneau, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Le Coustumer, Philippe; Clauzet, Marie-Laure; Lavastre, VÃ©ronique\n\n2013-04-01\n\nHydrogeology is an intrinsically multi-disciplinary field because of the critical role water plays in both human health and natural ecosystems. The NAA (Nappe Alluviale de l'Allier) project proposes an integrated research (hydrodynamic, hydrochemistry and biology) on the shallow aquifer of the Allier River (one of the main tributaries of the Loire River). This aquifer plays an important role in the regional water supply for it represents more than 60% of the total water abstraction. As an example, the sampling site, located near the city of Clermont-Ferrand (France) constitutes the major source of drinking water supply for more than 100 000 inhabitants and then plays a major role on the local socio-economy. A biweekly following sampling, that concerns hydrodynamical parameters, major ions and isotopes (oxygen-18, deuterium and carbon-13), has been achieved during two years on 2 rivers, 1 pond, 2 springs and 17 boreholes with the aim of defining the functioning of the aquifer in terms of quality and quantity of the water resources and then on the main processes that governs hydrodynamic and hydrochemistry. Preliminary results allowed discriminating different origins of groundwater with a part due to surface waters/groundwater interactions and a secondary origin that implies water circulating from the surrounding hills. A monthly following sampling of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and traces ions provides information on contaminants sources. In parallel, the dynamics of the microbial communities (bacteria, pico-cyanobacteria and pico-eukaryotes) was followed by flow cytometer. The bacterial diversity has been measured through PCR-DGGE analysis in order to evaluate the impact of the occurrence of contaminants.\n\nTowards a detailed knowledge about Mediterranean flash floods and extreme floods in the catchments of Spain, France and Italy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDuband, D.\n\n2009-09-01\n\nIt is important to remember that scientific research programs of the European Commission and contributors had implemented a multidisciplinary (geography, history, meteorology, climatology, hydrology, geomorphology, geology, paleohydrology, sociology, economy......) better knowledge and more understanding of the physical risk assessment of disastrous floods (particularly flash floods) with rising factors of vulnerability and perhaps climate change at the end of the XX1 century, in the triangular geographical area Zaragosa (Spain)-OrlÃ©ans (France)-Firenze (Italy). With reference to historical floods events observed from last two centuries in Spain (Catalonia), France (Languedoc Roussillon - Provence Alpes Cote dâAzur-Corse-Rhone Alpes -Auvergne- Bourgogne) and in Italy (Ligurie - Piemont - Lombardie) we lay particular stress on a detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal scales of the physical dynamic process being at the origin of locals or extensive flash floods. This study requires to be based on the meteorology (atmospheric circulation patterns ,on west Europe- Atlantic and Mediterranean sea) responsible, with relief and sea surface temperature, of high precipitations (amounts, intensities), air temperature, discharges of high floods, observed in the past ,on large and coastal rivers. We will take example of the Rhone river catchments, in connexion with Po-Ebre-Loire-Seine rivers, based on the studies of thirty high historical floods occurred from 1840 to 2005, and characteristics of Oceanic and Mediterranean weather situations, sometime alternated. Since recent years we have the daily mean sea level pressure dataset (EMSLP) reconstructions for European-North Atlantic Region for the period 1850-2006. So it is now possible to allow us the selection in the complete meteorological dataset during 1950- 2009 period by an analog method (like operational daily applications from 1969, at Electricity of France) to select weather situations similar to\n\nRivers we can't bring ourselves to clean - historical insights into the pollution of the Moselle River (France), 1850-2000\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcier, R. J.\n\n2007-11-01\n\nAs products of both natural and social systems, rivers are highly complex historical objects. We show in this paper that historical analysis works on two different levels: one level, which we call \"structural\", shows the materiality of the riverine environment as the spatial-temporal product of natural factors and human impacts (bed and course alterations, pollution, etc.). On a second level -\"semiotic\" - we show that river systems are also social constructs and the subjects of ancient and diverse management practices. The quality of a river will be a function of the dialectical interaction between both levels. Historical analysis can uncover the inherited constraints that bear upon current management practices. To help substantiate this analytical framework, we analyse the case of the Moselle river in eastern France by using archival sources and statistical data. Severely impaired by industrial discharges from iron, coal and salt industries between the 1875s and the early 1980s, the waters of the Moselle became the subject of a social consensus between stakeholders that prevented the implementation of efficient pollution management policies until the 1990s. The example urges caution on the pervasiveness of participatory approaches to river management: social consensus does not necessarily benefit the environment.\n\nRivers we can't bring ourselves to clean - historical insights into the pollution of the Moselle River (France), 1850-2000\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcier, R.
