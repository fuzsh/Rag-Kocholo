It is an invaluable factor in the conservation of life and property and creates a feeling of security Printed for the benefit of revolver shooters of America, by SMITH & WESSON Shooting a Revolver NNSIDE RING how easy it is to do good shooting with a revolver, it is amazing how few men can use this most practical arm with any degree of accuracy. Every week, men tell us that while they can do good work with a rifle, they cannot hit even a large target at short range with a revolver. Whenever possible, we ask such men to visit our shooting range, knowing that if shown how, they can shoot very well. Here is what you can easily learn to do with a Smith & Wesson revolver. 1. Put every shot into an 8’ circle at 20 yards. 2. Put every shot into a 10’ circle, shooting five shots in 30 seconds. 3. Hit a 14” circle at 50 yards practically every time, shooting slowly, and 3 times out of § shots, shooting rapidly. With practice you can hit a 4” circle at 20 yards practically every time, slow fire, and put the majority of your shots into a 6” target, shooting 5 shots in 30 seconds. At 50 yards you will be able to put the majority of your shots into a 10” circle, shooting either slow or fast. We have a proposition for the first 50 men to write us, who want to learn to shoot. Write for details if really interested. Our Descriptive Booklet R-8 may interest you—it will be sent free upon request. SMITH &WESSON SPRINGFIELD, MASS. U. S.A.

But beneath the ungainlylexterior lie the makings of a real gun The 7.62 mm. Russian Rifle And What Can Be Done With It By Alvin Linden N THIS neck ‘of the woods, Langlade County, Wisconsin, Epitor’s NoTte.—Though in its as-issued state it is one of the tgliest rifles ever manufactured, the 7.62 mm. Russian Nagant holds unsuspected We are not altogether sure of the axact meaning of the “three-line” the N. R. A. is almost un- known, except to a few scattered “lone wolf” gun cranks. It is practically useless to try to in- duce anyone to join it by ex- plaining its noble creed, as that meets with about as much ap- proval and red-hot enthusiasm as trying to take up a collection for umbrellas or overcoats for the poor heathen in Congo. But, show an N. R. A. price list, with the Krag rifle, as issued, listed at $1.50 and the 7.62 Russian, brand new, at $3.34, and quite often possibilities for remodeling into an excellent sporting arm. The 7.62 mm. Russian cartridge is a very efficient one and thoroughly up to date, giving to a 147-grain bullet a muzzle velocity (in 31%-inch barrel) of from 2,800 to 2,900 foot-seconds, with very moderate pressures. The cartridge is handled by an action which is strong and very simple, and is backed up in the chamber by a bolt having two large locking lugs. The low price at which this rifle is sold places within the reach of everyone the makings of a weapon which is sufficient for most practical purposes in this country. We therefore felt that this Russian 7.62 should be better known; and in seeking a good and comprehensive article on the gun and what could be done with it we turned to Mr. Linden, a Wisconsin gunsmith, who, while doing high-class gunsmithing work of all kinds, has made some- thing of a specialty of remodeling the Russian, as quite a number of men in his part of the country have bought these rifles and brought them to him. He is, in fact, the man who did the Russian job for “Dad” Crozier, a short account of which appeared in our May number. The ballistic and technical data at the end of the article were ob- tained through the courtesy of Colonel Whelen, United States Cartridge Co. and Remington, both of which latter companies regularly manufacture hunting ammunition for the Russian rifle. part of its official name, but we suspect it may have some con- nection with the three lines and more of cantankerous and caustic language which most gun cranks cut loose when they open up the long carton and take a first glance at its contents. For this is undoubtedly one of the ugliest clubs of a rifle that was ever designed! The object of this article is to describe in considerable detail how to “doll up” the Russian military stock, and also how to go about it is possible to induce some of the boys to part with $3 for membership in the N. R. A., with privilege of buying at these prices through the office of the D. C. M. Quite often some of them will ask, “Why in the ‘blooming ’ell’ didn’t you tell me about this before?” They even accuse us, at times, of withholding this information. We were under the impression that this was the only part of the country where this ignorance existed, and almost blushed when we thought about it. But according to Chauncey Thomas and others such is not the case. In these days of 200-miles-per-hour racing cars and still faster airplanes, the call is for speed, and more of it. The “three-line Nagant,” or 7.62 Russian rifle, with a muzzle velocity of 2,900 feet, is by far the best buy ever offered at the price—$3.34, plus express. completely restocking the rifle. As a Westerner said: “Make the d——n thing safe to carry among the cows without causing a stampede!” For anyone who has any use for a rifle of its velocity and killing power (and it is a poor gun crank who can’t figure out some good excuse for needing one) this 7.62-mm. rifle is hard to beat; and one can buy sights and do considerable fixing up on it, even to the extent of having a new stock, and still be out less money than even a second-hand rifle of far less power costs in a store. Besides, most gun cranks love to tinker with their fire sticks and im- prove (?) them. In most cases they fail; but here is one rifle that can stand a great deal of tinkering without detracting from its as- issued appearances. After taking this specimen apart and cleaning off most of the Reshaping the military stock, oy np | the barrel, fitting. accu- rate sights and bending down the bolt handle gives you a real modern high-velocity sporting rifle. The 7.62 mm. cartridge is very efficient ballistically, and is capable of stopping anything that walks the continent cosmoline with gasoline, a glance through the bore will show a fine, smooth-finished barrel. The barrel is 3134 inches long, and we can cut off at least six inches of it and still be close to the Springfield as far as velocity is concerned. A new front sight will be neces- sary, and a base to fasten x om. The Springfield front sight band (fixed stud) can be put on at about 24 inches from the breech; and the complete sight (fixed and movable stub) equipped with a gold bead makes a fine combination. And at the time this is published the Lyman Company will probably have their new Russian front-sight band and sight ready for sale. They decided to manufacture this at the suggestion of Colonel Whelen. For a rear sight, especially for target shoot- ing, the No. 36 receiver sight made by Lyman is the best. For ordinary hunting the 1-A cocking piece sight can be mounted on the head of cocking piece by cutting a slot in it. The firing pin screws into this cocking piece, and the rear end of it can be cut off one- eighth of an inch without any harm. The best way to cut the sight slot is with a milling machine, of course; but one can also cut the slot with a hacksaw and three- cornered saw file, one flat of the file being ground smooth to make it “safe,” and the file easier to control. The flat underside of the receiver is the guide for cutting this slot accurately, square across. There is considerable wobble in the cocking piece, which also crawls down when the trigger is pulled, as is the case with most military ac- tions. This is the reason why the receiver sight is the one to use where real target shoot- ing is the object. The bolt head sight, giv- ing longer sight radius and being closer to the eye, is undoubtedly the quickest to catch on a running shot. Mr. Hathaway suggests the use of a spring plunger to keep the cocking piece in one constant position, and this can be worked out some way. It may seem out of reason to pay $10 for a receiver sight for a rifle that costs only about one-third as much as that. But remember that even at that we are getting a very reasonable com- bination; and with the bolt head sight at $4.50 it is possible to get a fine set of sights for this rifle without spending a fortune. The military front sight is absolutely hope- less; besides, who needs 3134 inches of barrel in the woods? So cut off six inches of the barrel with a hacksaw. You will find that it cuts easily, the same as all rifle barrels except those made for the foreign Anti-Corro steel. Now, slip on the Springfield front stud and tap it gently toward the THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN until it sticks. If you wish your barrel shorter than this (24 inches) you can get the Lyman band, which drives on farther. After deciding where the band will be, mark with a A simple, strong action, To remove bolt, hold back on trigger. To remove magazine and fol- : lower assembly, press follower and floor plate together between thumb and fingers, which opens hinge joint. Note heavy recoil bolt be- low receiver hood knife around barrel the exact position the band will occupy, and then drive off. Now cut your barrel off exactly where you wish it, and dress off the muzzle with a file, using a try-square, on all sides until it is as square as you can get it. Then ream the bore out slightly with a countersink to lessen the chances of marring the sharp edges of the rifling; round or bevel the outside edge of the muzzle evenly, and polish with emery cloth. You can make a wooden burnisher to operate in a breast drill with a small piece of emery cloth tied over the end, for polishing. With a little elbow grease you can burnish the end of the barrel nicely. In a lathe the operation of cutting and shaping is simple. Now polish or file off the bluing between the marks made with the knife at ends of band. When clean put on some soldering flux (don’t let it get on the bluing), and heat the end of the barrel, with a blow torch or in a forge, until hot enough to make solder stick and flow freely. While hot wipe the surplus solder off quickly with a piece of cloth. The barrel at this point is now “tinned,” and ready for the sight band. Tin the inside of this band in the same way that the barrel was tinned. The idea is to get just enough solder on barrel and in- side of band to “sweat” the two together. Now heat both barrel and band at the same time; and when the solder is hot enough to flow on both of them tap band gently onto barrel. When band is on as far as it should go, and while still hot, tap it on either side until it is in a vertical position, with no cant. It is easier to let some friend do the “squint- ing’ from a distance while you hold the bar- rel and tap as directed. Also, this makes a The Russian bolt has two large locking lugs. It is simply and strongly made, consisting of but seven parts, all of which are large and easy to dismount and assemble 570 Vol. LXXV, No. 12 fine alibi if later tests prove the band to be slightly canted. A friend of mine, Sergeant Baker, prides him- self on his wonderful “me- chanical eye,” which never failed to detect the _ slightest cant. The only time I had him stumped was when he was trying to out- guess a fine level with a very fast bubble, which we were using to level up a small band base for a folding leaf sight on a Ross rifle, Baker was, unknowingly, taking in too much territory. To remove the military sight base, heat it with torch or in a forge until you can see melted solder where the base joins the barrel. Then tap the sight lightly on the rear end, driving toward muzzle. When the solder is melted this sight drives off very nicely. If it seems to stick, heat it more. You will note that it is sweated onto a dovetailed pad on the barrel similar to a scope block, only more solid, this pad being an integral part of the barrel itself. (We’ve known of cases where a pipe wrench was applied to remove this base. It started the barrel but did not budge the base. Also I know of a party who decided that this sight had to be chiseled off. The telescope crank will be quick to note the fine flat place on his bar- rel, a standing invitation for a block or base for a telescope mount; also that there is a fine flat on the receiver for the other block. We would probably leave enough of it for a future telescope experiment; but the average crank will prefer to file this pad off to the contour of barrel. Suit yourself. The only way to get this spot to match the bluing on the barrel exactly is to polish off all bluing and reblue the entie barrel, using Hoffman’s bluing solution. This is the handiest to use and will“do a fine job if directions are followed. For other bluing methods see Colonel Whelen’s “Amateur Gunsmithing.” (This little book, by the way, should be in every gun crank’s library, as it contains a lot of information that is hard to find elsewhere.) It is possible to make a temporary job of heat-bluing on the bright spot left when rear sight pad is trimmed off, but this will not match the other bluing, and it is only a makeshift at best. The 36 Lyman receiver sight is milled to fit the receiver exactly, and is easy to put on with the drill and tap furnished extra for 50 cents. Place it in the proper position—where it fits the best, and then clamp or tie it down se- curely. Mark the exact center of the screw holes with a prick punch. Then drill through the frame, oO — = CTH or Ss be me eH co December, 1927 being sure to keep the drill at right angles, or square, with the flat. Drill right through the receiver, and follow with the tap. Go slowly with this tap to prevent breaking it. If it seems to turn too hard back it off a bit and then go ahead again, carefully.

It might therefore be a good idea to sweat it on in the same way that the front sight band was sweated to the barrel. This can be done by dismounting the sight to prevent injury from heating to the spring on the swinging arm. Polish the space under the base and apply the solder with a soldering iron. No need to wipe surplus off until base is on. Polish the underside of sight base, and tin it as before. Then screw it onto the receiver until it gets down to the solder. Now heat the base and receiver with the torch until the solder is melted, and then turn down the screws until tight, and wipe off any solder that oozes out around the edges. If heated enough to make the solder flow freely the sight base will stay put; but do not overheat. You can also do the soldering first, and then drill and tap. No getting out of place then while making and drilling the screw holes. Some one will remark that we are a bit reckless with the torch; but remember that there is no case-hardening in this receiver, or in the bolt; and if care is taken to heat the metal only enough to cause the solder to flow freely no harm will result.* It is taken for granted that the receiver has been * EpiTor’s NOTE: THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN completely stripped before heating, to pre- vent injury to the various springs, etc. Now reassemble the action and put on the stock, after amputating a foot or more of the long forearm. Put in a temporary front sight blade and test the alignment by shooting. When satis- fied that there is no cant in front sight base band, pin this onto the barrel. On the Springfield band there is a small slot which engages a nar- row feather, the feather fitting also, half its depth, into a slot cut in the Spring- field barrel. It is possible to run a drill into this slot with the band in position gn the barrel, and cut into the barrel enough to make it possible to drive in a round pin, which can be filed from a_ nail. There is also a chance to drill through the small hole on the side, or enlarge it slightly. By drilling carefully from both sides a hole can be put through even if the drill has a tendency to crawl up over the curve of the barrel; and a snug- fitting pin driven through the hole will make the band as solid as if welded on. It is also possible to mark on the barrel the loca- tion of this hole while the stud is on tem- porarily, when it is very easy to file a groove for the pin when stud is removed. The only objection to this method is that some- times one must drive the stud on a bit farther afterwards to be sure of a tight fit, in which case the groove and the hole in sight band will not line up. File down the temporary front sight blade to the right height, which height can be determined only by shooting. This tem- porary sight with hole drilled for pin can then be sent to one of the sight manu- facturers as a sam- ple for a permanent one of the proper type and height to be made from; or, if you are a real gun crank you can braze, weld or sil- ver-solder in place the kind of a tip or bead you prefer, except ivory, of course. Bronze answers for gold in a pinch. We have even known of a thin dime—refused by postmaster—being folded over the tip, covered with borax and melted To put on safety, The base of until it stuck; then a bead was filed out from this and polished—and there was a silver bead sight! Some make a bead of soft solder, but this is easily knocked off. A bronze bead can be soldered on nicely by using band saw solder, but it is of no use to try this unless every part is free from grease and covered with flux to keep the air away. Any good acetylene welder can put on a bead that will stay even if it gets a knock or two. The sight being lined up and O. K., we will take a look at the bolt handle. This sticks straight out from the gun, and is very short. Some turn it down by heating and bending, but that only makes it shorter and harder to operate. It is better to lengthen it by heating the knob red hot and drawing it out as long as possible, to the diameter of the shank or a little smaller than this, on the end. Then the piece of barrel we cut off furnishes ideal material for a new knob. File the shank of the handle until it is possible to get the piece of rifled barrel on one-half inch or so. Then heat the shank of bolt handle red hot and use the leverage of the six inches or so of barrel to bend it down, and back to the position you prefer. During the heating operation use all pos- sible care to keep the sliding part of bolt as cool as possible, mainly to prevent marring. You can’t help its turning dark; and it can be repolished later. Some leave it dark or heat-blued. Decide on how long a knob you wish. You can make a round knob or a long pear-shaped one like that on the Mann- licher-Schoenauer; and you can have the handle any reasonable length you wish it, even turned back and down as on the 1917 Enfield, if you like that style. The bore in the end of the knob will make it resemble the hollow Enfield knob, if you contersink it The swinging arm of the 36 Lyman in operation a bit when finished. Turning in a lathe is the best and easiest method of shaping your bolt knob. But you can also fasten the piece of barfel upright in a vise, and take a sharp hacksaw and, While the principal parts of many of the Russian rifles may not appear to have been given a temper or case-hardened finish, it should never- theless be borne in mind that in the manufacture of all modern high-power rifles the steel used is subjected to a process of heat treatment which changes its molecular structure and thereby develops in it the strength necessary to withstand the pressures of modern high intensity ammunition. heat-treated it should be again heated to anything like a dull-red heat, much or all of the strength developed by the heat treatment will be lost. working on the Russian rifle care should be taken not to heat the bolt head or receiver hood. comparatively mild heat necessary to remove the rear sight and solder on the front sight band should not do any harm if care is taken not to heat these parts more than is necessary to make the soft solder flow freely.

Repeat this on four sides, and then with a coarse half- round file shape up the knob to suit your taste. Then cut off to the length desired, file or grind that end perfectly round, counter- sink the bore and burnish the end until it resembles the Enfield knob on the bottom. It is hard to beat this material for a knob, as the inside of the barrel is bright to take solder well, in which the rifling also helps. Now heat with torch or in forge and flow solder freely into the bore of the knob; polish the end of shank and tin it exactly as you tinned the front end of barrel under the band. Heat both knob and shank to- gether, and it won’t hurt a bit if you let the sharp upper edges of the knob get red hot. When sure that solder is melted on shank and inside of knob quickly tap the latter THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN For deer hunting the Three Line Nagant does not need to take a back seat for any of them, this including the .30-06; and for flat tra- jectory and paralyzing knock-down-and-stay- down qualities it is way ahead of the usual run of rifles used for deer hunting. This was convincingly demonstrated up here last fall; and reports from the West praise the 7.62 mm. highly as a coyote rifle; and the coyote can absorb quite a wallop without even feel- ing embarrassed, as those who hunt these animals well know. For the average young farm and: ranch lad this rifle is certainly the best buy ever of- fered. It is good also for the hunter who goes on an occasional deer hunt, and who neither cares nor can afford to tie up $50 or more in any other rifle of equal ballistics. The Russian military stock is homely but it can be trimmed down to a shape that at least resembles a stock. There are no sling Vol. LXXV, No. 12 and trim off all wood that projects above the tang of the receiver. Take off % inch on each side of grip and on the bottom. Where- ever you can use a plane do so; and then scraper when every other tool fails. This latter cuts smoothly and leaves no deep marks as does a wood rasp. No matter how tough or cross-grained a piece of wood may be you can do a smooth job with a scraper when every other tool fails. This scraper is far ahead of glass because it can be “set” to cut just the way you wish it to. When the edge gets dull you can turn it back and set it over again several times be- fore it becomes necessary to file a new edge on it. Any real woodworker can show you how to set the scraper. Popular Mechanics had an article in one issue some time last fall or winter, which fully described this. The writer had to master the knack of it at the age of 14, back in 1900, in the shops at The light Russian barrel may be a trifle less accurate than a heavy barrel, but some of these rifles have shown surprising accuracy at that, and onto the former. The thin part of the knob, being red hot, will spread.a little, but it will also shrink if you dip it into water quickly. The rifling will also dig in some and do its part to hold. This should make a very secure and lasting job, unless you had things entirely too hot and burned the solder. If there is any doubt about your knob staying on let some welder run a little brass in the hole of the knob, when it will surely stay where it belongs. Now file off and polish. If fitted right the union between knob and bolt will show only a small ring of solder. If shank and knob are kept bright it is hard to see where the two are joined. If knob and shank are blued the joint will show somewhat. The fact that this bolt can be taken apart in several pieces saves you from all worry about getting the locking lugs too hot. You don’t need to heat them at all, unless you wish to take off the extractor and heat-blue this part. But better leave it bright. The other parts of the bolt can be heat-blued very nicely if you prefer that to the bright finish. Heating will not hurt the temper as in a case-hardened bolt. There is no so- called “temper” in any part of this Russian rifle except the springs, ejector and extractor. Leave these alone; heat will soften them. If you wish to have everything blued use the Hoffman solution. The boiling water will not draw the temper even in the springs. You now have the “works” of a good hunt- ing rifle with practically the same ballistics as the .30-06, using 150-grain bullet. Even if you invest in a complete reloading set for it you are still way ahead of the game as far as actual cost is concerned. Or you may be able to pick up some of the war-time ammuni- tion for it quite reasonably. The commercial soft-point ammunition in 7.62 mm. costs no more than the same in .30-06 caliber. the light barrel gives a neat, trim rifle that handles fast swivels, the sling strap having been run through rectangular holes cut in the wood. These holes are reinforced at the edges with oval metal plates let in flush on either side of each hole and fastened with short wood screws. In many cases the slot in the screw head has been ground almost off, but the screws ‘can easily be backed out by means of a small sharp punch and light taps of a hammer. Remove the plates and fill the holes. You can whittle out a plug of wood that will just fit the hole, and glue or cement it in place. The oval depressions remaining after the removal of the plates need not be filled because these will be automatically re- moved when we dress the stock down. In setting out to reshape the ugly, clumsy military stock of our rifle we find that we have plenty of wood in every direction to work with. If you wish to go to the trouble of putting in diamond-shaped inlays over the sling strap holes, do so.. Make these large enough to cover the screw holes also, which otherwise would be filled with putty, cement or small plugs of wood, glued in. With the inlay in place and the glue or cement dry, we can start trimming the stock down to human size. This stock is just as apt to be made of birch as of walnut; and there is considerable tolerance everywhere. You will find that the wood projects at least one- eighth of an inch all around the butt-plate. If you decide to use the military butt-plate by all means plane off the wood all around it and clear back to the tang. File the wood around the butt-plate until it gets even; and you may have to heat-blue the butt-plate to take care of the bright edges. Note that there is a “cod belly” curve on top of the stock from heel to the comb. Plane this down straight; cut down the curve at junc- tion of grip and comb about % inch deeper, 572 Pullman, Ill. Any Pullman woodworker sure had to have this business of scraping down pat. We used to finish state rooms in Pullman sleepers, and also in compartment sleepers—all state rooms—with a dark-green wood called Tonquin. This was the meanest and “orneriest” wood ever discovered. It was just as hard as ebony or any other wood grown. Cut a piece of it off at an angle across grain, as for a miter, and half a dozen strokes would dull the sharpest plane bit. Holding the piece against the light one could plainly see fine grains of shining sand in every pore of the wood. Though it was actually grown in the tropics somewhere, everybody at Pullman declared that it must have been grown in hell, or on the fringes thereof. It probably grew in soil that was full of quicksand, because it certainly was full of real grains of sand, too small to be seen unless held against the light after the plane iron had crushed enough of the grains to reflect the light. The plane iron usually resembled a saw after a few strokes. The wood could not be planed smooth; the grain ran every way. In fitting doors and upper sash made of it we had to saw and plane until we could get things into place, and then scrape until smooth. That didn’t mean “may- be” in Pullman in those days, either. Our inspector, a Scotchman, had finger tips sensi- tive to locate a scratch made by a single coarse grain of sand in sandpaper; and if everything wasn’t smooth as plate glass we had to do the job over again. Such a thing as sanding across grain on inside finishing, except where it was painted, was looked upon with the same approval as carrying a loaded rifle, with bolt closed and safety off, behind the firing line at Camp Perry, and was stopped about as quickly.

Some like one tapered and finished to the shape of those on the Winchester 54 and Savage bolt-action rifles. Others prefer the fuller forearms that are found on the finest grade of custom-made rifles, while some even go to the extent of putting on a beaver tail. Fire about ten shots rapid fire and you will be convinced that a good handhold is advisable. If you touch the barrel you will find it hot enough to blister. The military forearm on the Russian is full enough for a tapered forearm; but if a full forearm is desired it is neces- sary to splice on a few inches of wood at the lower band. This splice can be made in fish- tail shape, which later can be completely hidden by checking. Or a square splice can be made and the two pieces held together by a square wooden dowel glued into the groove cut in the forearm for the cleaning rod. If a band encircling both forearm and barrel is used, let this hide the joint. In the other type of splice a band around barrel fastened to swivel in forearm can easily be made by anyone handy with tools. Several styles have been shown in dif- ferent articles in THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN; and there is also a good sketch in “Amateur Gunsmithing.” After scraping stock and forearm smooth finish with sandpaper. This is a very short and easy job provided the scraping has been well done. If your stock happens to be of walnut you can go ahead with the wetting and sandpapering operation to prevent the grain raising if the finished stock gets wet; and prepare for the oil or varnish finish, whichever you prefer. If the wood happens to be birch it will be too light in color to look good. Stain at the best will make it look like the “genuine mahogany” (?) which in most cases is nothing but birch. One glance at the grain is enough to detect the imitation by anyone who has done finishing in real mahogany. We can alter the color of the birch better and get it to look more like walnut by slightly darkening with the flame of a blow torch after the grain has been raised. This is the way the Kentucky rifles were striped. They did not have torches in those days but used hot irons held close to the wood, an open flame, or else wound a tarred string around the stock and set it afire. By the way, if you wish to see some real figure brought out in wood by this process pick out a piece of curly sugar maple with some “bird’s-eyes” among the curls. The rest of the wood will turn every imaginable shade of brown, while the bird’s-eyes will re- tain their original color and shine like pearls. Like everything else this can be overdone by burning the wood, but there is no need to be afraid if reasonable care is used and a wet rag kept ready to slap on as soon as the wood reaches the desired shade. Checking should be done either before oil- ing or else after the oil finish has set; other- wise the wood will be too soft and spongy and will gum the checking tools badly. Three or four coats of spar varnish properly ap- THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN plied in a room free of dust, and rubbed to a high polish will produce a very flashy looking job, which would be picked out by the average customer as the best finish nine times out of ten. This gives only a surface coat, however, upon which the least scratch will show up badly. The oil finish, produced as per instructions given at different times, is the only one that really can be called a gun-stock finish. The oil penetrates deeply and can be depended upon to make whatever grain is in the wood show up better than can varnish, because linseed oil emphasizes the color and grain. As oil is rubbed into a stock the darker parts of the wood seem to get still darker, while the lighter parts seem to get translucent. The oil acts upon the wood in exactly the same way that asphalt acts in paving, as a binder which holds the fibers of the wood together; and when it finally gets set—which requires months—the pores of the wood are actually filled up and the wood is waterproofed in a way that no varnish can equal. But you must have wood to begin with. Oil can not bring out grain and figure where none exists, although it will waterproof and harden any wood that will absorb it. And for the final coats it is equally important to get the genuine boiled oil that can be depended upon to oxidize and harden instead of remaining gummy and sticky. Outside of this all that is required is what Colonel Whelen has so often recom- mended: elbow grease, and daily application for months. If the oil appears to get gummy take some rotten stone and oil and rub the surface down, and go ahead again. Just about the time you swear that you have oiled and rubbed enough to fill six stocks results will begin to show. The battle has at last been won, and you will feel repaid for your labor. You will also realize that this is some job if done right; and you will think twice before you cuss a gunsmith because he will not promise to make a stock, with a genuine London oil finish on it, all in a month. It can be done, but you can be sure that the process has been hastened consider- ably by the use of a filler, and by other tricks of the trade. Checking has been explained so often that it is needless to waste space on the subject here. It is like anything else; it requires patience and experience to do a good job. Better oil your stock and practice all you can checking odd pieces of wood before you tackle the checking of the stock itself, especially the new stock, the making of which we will now explain, step by step, as we performed the actual operations upon the one shown in the cuts. This job requires un- limited patience, and it is useless to attempt to make speed on your first stock if you expect to fit it in without “Dutchman” joints, and the putty that goes with them. Better read the instructions for stocking in “Amateur Gunsmithing,” also. If this is to be your first attempt you will find it is hardly pos- sible to get too much information upon the subject. Get the wood first. The blank should be 573 9 at least two inches thick, or thicker if you intend to have a cheekpiece on the stock. Take the old stock and lay it on the blank. See that the grain in the blank runs parallel with the grip. This puts the cross grain in the forearm, where it does no harm, but rather constitutes an advantage because if the fore- arm should happen to warp the cross grain will have far less power to spring the barrel out of true than if the grain ran parallel with the bore. This cross grain in the fore- arm also helps considerably in cutting out for the barrel and action, as you can cut toward the muzzle without much danger of the wood “slivering out,” as often happens otherwise. If one end of your blank shows better figure or grain than the other try to arrange to get this near the butt where it will show to the best advantage. If you buy a blank from a dealer you will have to take pot luck unless you pick out your own. It is not absolutely necessary that the wood be walnut; you can make fine stocks also of hard maple, northern grown. This is used by lumberjacks for peavy and cant hook stocks, and is very strong. The early Kentuckies were stocked with this wood, and when the woods were full of walnut, too. Cherry and apple wood will also do nicely, also pear wood and other varieties, except the coarse-grained woods such as ash, hickory and oak. Sometimes it is possible to find some splendid stock material in old houses, especially those in the southern parts of the country and in the Eastern States. Whatever wood is used it should be well seasoned, and the older the better. Imported blanks of fine Italian and French walnut can also be bought in Eng- land. The postage on a rifle blank is $1.50, and there is no duty on rough blanks. These English dealers can be depended upon to send you the very best blank it is possible to obtain for the money. Better make a stock or two before investing in an expensive blank, however, as these are just as easy to spoil as the cheapest ones. Having procured a blank of some sort and decided which shall be the butt end and which the forearm, plane off one side perfectly straight and flat, without any twist, or wind. Then plane the top edge perfectly straight, and, square with this side. A great deal of the success or failure of doing a good job of inletting depends upon doing this pre- liminary work accurately. Now scribe a line exactly in the center of this true top edge, using the planed side as a guide. Be sure that this center line, on the edge where the barrel and action are to be let in, is as straight as you can possibly make it. Use a straight-edge, and mark lightly with a sharp- edged chisel; don’t depend upon a pencil line. In stocking as in any other job of a similar nature, the work must be laid out exactly right to begin with. Guesswork is just as useless here as it would be in trying to make a possible at the target by guessing. With a center line cut in with an edged tool this preliminary laying out can be very ac- curately done. (To be concluded) THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN Vol. LXXV, No. International Rifle Matches of the U. S. NTERNATIONAL rifle shooting now suf- fered a decline. In 1885 the N. R. A. sent a challenge to Great Britain for a team of British Volunteers to shoot against the Na- tional Guard at Creedmoor, which was not accepted. No further efforts were made to promote matches until 1889, when sixteen Massachusetts Volunteer Militia went to Eng- land. Unfortunately they were not allowed to shoot in matches, as their Springfields did not conform to British conditions. The year 1897 saw the start of the Argen- tine Cup Matches—the present matches which we call the Free Rifle Matches. The United States did not participate in these matches until 1913, but in view of the interest now shown, the complete record of scores and winners is given to date.

Due to the interest of the New Jersey Association, a revival of the famous Dolly- mount Match was staged between the Ulster Rifle Association and the New Jersey State Rifle Association, the Irish team, captained by Capt.

The United States challenged Canada, the holders of the Palma, for a match which was fired on September 13, 1902, at the Rockcliffe Range, Ottawa. General Spencer captained the American team. Great Britain also sent a team, which won, owing to their ability to dope wind. Up to the second half of the 900- yard stage, the American team had a lead of 27 points, when a sudden change of weather occurred. At the end of the 900-yard stage the Americans were 12 points behind. At 1,000 yards both teams were equal. The lesson learned here was a costly one, but em- phasized the value of good coaching.

No match was shot until 1907, when Great Britain sent the Palma Trophy to Canada to defend, and a team to shoot in this match and to tour Australia as well. The American team won the match, establishing a new world’s record. Match was shot on the Rock- cliffe Range, Ottawa.

The Great War now interrupted interna- tional shooting as a sport, no events taking place until 1919, when the Inter-Allied Games were shot at Le Mans, France, on June 24, 1919. These matches consisted of a team match and individual matches fired on the continental type decimal target and were a walkover for the Americans. It is to be noted that Great Britain did not participate. UniTsD States Capt. W. A. lst Lieut. W. A. Spooner Capt. W. W. Walker Sgt.

It is interesting to note that in the indi- vidual matches First Sergeant Smith won with a score of 275, and that the first eighteen places were captured by the American squad. The Rumanian team used the Springfield rifle and had American coaches, to which they attributed their high standing. In ap- preciation, they gave the A. E. F. Rumanian ‘ Cup for annual competition which is now competed for yearly by teams of the service in one of the important N. R.

In 1920 we again captured the Olympic Matches at Beverlas, Belgium, on July 29, the team matches being the same as the Free Rifle Matches—40 shots standing, kneeling and prone at 300 meters, and resulted as follows: This team, captained by Lieutenant Colonel Snyder, Infantry, and coached by W.

V. Sandys Wunsch, Inspector, R. C. M. P. HE Royal Canadian Mounted Police are armed with Colt New Service Revolvers, (calibers .45 and .455) and S. M. L. E. Rifles (caliber .303), but the latter is a secondary weapon and carried only on escorts and used for hunting in the North. Royal Canadian Mounted Police regula- tions lay down that “every man shall be an expert revolver shot and a good rifle shot”; extensive revolver training is therefore car- ried out with this end in view. All men are drilled with the rifle, and whenever possible fire a modification of the army course yearly. But the multitudinous duties per- formed by the force prevent much range practice, except at the training depot at Regina. The revolver course is, however, fired an- nually by all ranks. Men who obtain a cer- tain percentage are classified as marksmen, and wear a silk badge of crossed revolvers on the left sleeve of their scarlet serges; the best shot in the force wears a gold crown above the badge, and receives $25 in cash. Recruits are first instructed in revolver drill, and special attention is paid to safe handling of the weapon. They are taught that it is only for use in an emergency and for self-defense. Firing practice takes place all the year in the depot, an annual grant of 100 rounds per man being issued for this purpose. In addition men can purchase extra ammunition at a reduced rate. Regimental competitions are held and efforts made to raise the general standard, not to produce a few star shots. However, individual members of the force shoot in the Dominion Rifle Asociation Re- volver Matches and the Canadian Revolver Association Matches. The former associa- tion has two team shoots each year, one for the service .455 weapon, and one for target revolvers. The R. C. M. P. have held the first shield five times in the last six years, and the second since it was instituted in 1921. The C. R. A. gold medal for the In- dividual Championship has been won four times, and a world’s record of 198x200 at 20 yards was also made by a member of the force in 1922. In all these matches the issue weapon was used. Target shooting at small bull’s-eyes is not encouraged among the majority of the men, more attention being paid to speed and ac- curacy at a man-size target. The present R. C. M. P. revolver course is as follows: az 4 “ar te > i)!

But so far as we know nothing has ever appeared, at least in recent years, telling of the guns used by the R. C. M. P. and their methods of marksmanship training. We are fortunate in having been able to obtain this little article froin a member of the Force who is him- self a famous shot, even among fa- mous shots, and who, in fact, is the “member of the Force” who in 1922 made the world’s record at 20 yards, as mentioned in the article—though we had to get this information from the Colt Company.

Pattern control has been the ambition of the professional and amateur loader as well as the manufacturer of guns, shells, wads, powder and shot. These have tried in concert, and as individuals, to increase the density or compactness with which the shot column travels through the air. It can not be said that they have alto- gether failed, or that there has not been some improvement in the shotgun pattern, during the last decade. At the Hercules listic Laboratory pat- terns have been very closely studied during the past four or five years in an effort to improve them by means of powder con- trol, during which time some rather interest- ing and disconcerting facts have been found out about the erratic behavior of shotgun loads and the manner in which they pattern. Our laboratory is rather well equipped, and perhaps a short description of how the patterns are deter- Powder Co.’s_ Bal- mined would first be of interest. The gun, as shown in the illustration, is suspended by four wires in a carriage By L. C. Weldin Ballistic Engineer, Hercules Powder Company weighing fifty pounds. This enables us always to measure the free recoil developed by the cartridge, and at the same time gives true and perfect alignment of the gun on the target, which is necessary for the registra- tion of patterns as well as velocities. As we are concerned only with direct comparison of patterns a detail description of the gun will not be given other than to say that it is of standard American manufacture with 30-inch full-choke barrel and specially reamed to minimum chamber dimensions. The construction of the target is fairly clear in the accompaying illustrations, which Counting the pattern. Note roll of patterns on left as brought up from target; also registering pencil used to count strokes as each hole is marked 579 show both the front and back. It is placed 120 feet from the muzzle wire, which is stretched %4 inch in front of the muzzle of the gun, and can readily be run back and forth on the track to obtain patterns or velocities at greater or less distances. The steel target plate is 34 inch thick, measuring 46 inches wide by 48 inches high. A few inches in front of this plate the pattern paper is tightly drawn, this being heavy white paper 40 inches wide which comes in rolls weigh- ing about 250 pounds. After each shot this pattern is automatically rolled up, exposing a fresh piece of paper for the next shot. Thus at the conclusion of the test each con- secutive pattern is on a continuous roll of paper in its proper order for identifying with its corresponding velocity, pressure, and recoil record. This roll of patterns is carried up from the target and unrolled on the counting table. A 30- inch circle is drawn around the greatest mass of shot holes, and the actual num- ber of pellets hitting within this circle is counted. This is then reported in percentage of the number of pel- lets in the original shot load. In our loading we put the shot load into each eee, Adjustable shot-counting trowel and delicate scales used for setting trowel for correct weight of pellets desired shell with a counting trowel. This is an ad- justable aluminum counter which can be set for any given number of pellets, so that through its use we always have exactly the same num- ber of shot pellets in each shell on which to base our percentage. This counter is made ad- justable, not only to accommodate different loads of the same shot and for various sizes of shot, but primarily to take care of the variation existing even in the same make of shot from bag to bag. Of course we not only wish the same number of pellets in each shell, but we must have the same weight as well. The counter is set to give the correct weight, which is checked on delicate analytical balances. For a great many years a pattern deter- mination was based upon only five shots of the customary ten shots fired for the ballis- tic record. This, no doubt, was done in the belief that five shots were sufficient for a satisfactory record, although the expense and time involved, as well as the monotony of counting all of those shot holes, undoubtedly played an important part in establishing this system. At the time we began our pattern study the five-shot system of pattern de- termination was still in force. However, we found that on check tests of the same load there was a serious discrepancy in the aver- ages obtained, so we doubled the number of patterns, taking them on the entire ten shots. Our bill for pattern paper promptly went up one hundred per cent, and the work was slowed down to such an extent that we had to take on more help to count all of those holes. Nevertheless, we felt that if we were going to determine patterns at all we had bet- ter do it right and obtain a true figure that could be relied upon, no matter what the cost might be. Naturally we felt satisfied that this double determination was the solution of our trouble, but just to prove it we checked a THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN few loadings with another string of ten- shot patterns, and to our surprise their averages did not agree closer than about 12 points. Next day we again checked them, and again they did not agree. We then decided to fire a ten- shot test every day for ten consecutive days to obtain an average on 100 pat- terns; then repeat the entire test one month later. This seemed to give us a fairly reliable figure —one that we ordi- narily expect to check within a close limit. We next tried shoot- ing a series of 100 consecutive shots on the same day. For instance, in Series No. 5 the tenth day string gave an average for ten shots of 64.0% with a maximum of 79.7% and a minimum of 44.7%. On the same day we fired 100 additional shots, which averaged 63.7%—maximum 83.8% and mini- mum 19.8% —which is a close check except for the minimum shot; but the true average for this ammunition, as shown by the average of ten days shooting, is 62.9%—maximum 82.7% and minimum 24.5%. Several days later we tried a 50-shot string, which averaged 61.11%4—maximum 80.1% and minimum 22.2%. This in- dicated that a 50 or 100 shot series did not give any truer average than a 10-shot series. However, we thought these results should be checked with a different load, so that represented by Series No. 6 was selected. Here again a 100-shot series was fired on the same day as the last 10-shot series. The former averaged 64.3% for 100 shots—maxi- mum 80.4% and minimum 22.9%— against 62.4% average for 10 shots —maximum 80.3% and minimum 28.5%—a fair agreement, although the true pattern as shown by the 10-day test is 63.4%—maximum 83.5% and minimum 27.3%. Sev- eral days later we fired a 50-shot string of this same ammunition, ob- taining an average of 62.2% —maxi- mum 78.8% and minimum 26.6%. These tests indicated to us that while you might encounter a true extreme variation of a given am- munition by shooting a 50- or 100- shot string on a given day, you would not necessarily obtain! the correct pattern average, or even a figure that could be checked closely. 580 The shot-countin lets in each she Vol. LXXV, No. 12 This led us to the conclusion that patterns are affected from day to day by outside con- ditions. In our case this can hardly be temperature effect alone, as our range is in. closed in a substantial brick building and steam-heated throughout. In order to secure data for this article we have tabulated the patterns from 4,900 shots, representing 49 series of 100 shots each, fired in strings of 10 shots daily. Thus in order to-obtain a 100-shot series, 10 days shooting was required. There is no doubt that we could have included a great many more similar series, but these 49 series are the last ones fired and we believe are sufficient to represent average conditions existing over a considerable period of time, including summer and winter weather. They have not been selected, nor have we excluded any. They are, in fact, consecutive tests representing hand-loaded ammunition as well as factory- loaded ammunition, of which the majority contained No. 6 chilled shot. It is interesting as well as enlightening to note how low the actual patterns run. A 60% to 65% pattem for 1% ounces of No. 6 chilled shot is a good pattern in our range and guns. All of these tests were made over the standard distance of 40 yards from muzzle to target, in an in- closed range. The range is steam-heated, and we make an effort to maintain it as near 70° F., winter and summer, as it is humanly possible to do. A thermostat in the steam line takes care of this during the winter months, but in summer we have no artificial means of cooling, and the range temperature often exceeds the 70° F. standard. Upon analyzing these 4,900 shots we find that the average extreme variation existing trowel in use.

A cally in front of muzzle, carrying current between the maximum individual shot and the minimum in any series of ten consecutive shots is 26.8 in the pattern percentage. In any one test of the 49 series of 100-shot pat- terns the average difference between the high- est and lowest individual shot is 48.0, while the maximum difference is 64.4 and the small- est is 36.0. These are large differences. In Series No. 13, for example, in which, in- cidentally, was used a factory-loaded lot of ammunition, the highest shot in the 100-shot series is 83.7%, while the lowest is 19.3%, showing a total difference of 64.4 points. The grand average for the entire 100 shots is only 56.6% pattern. Then, again, con- sider the averages of the 10-shot groups in these series. We find that in Series No. 43 the highest is 77.3% and the lowest is 57.6%, or a difference of 19.7 points, while in Series No. 39 this difference is the smallest, being only 6.5, although for the entire 100 shots this series is not the most uniform. The credit for uniformity must go to Series No. 40, where the greatest difference be- tween individual shots is only 36.0, as com- pared to 44.9 in Series No. 39. We also find that in any group of 100 shots fired in series of 10 shots daily you may expect an average difference between the means of the 10-shot groups of 12.1 points. In other words, if you make a pattern test of your gun today and fire 10 shots to determine this, and that average is, say, 69.4%, and then repeat the test a day or so later, you may expect it to average 57.3%, or be anywhere between the limits of 6.5 or 19.7 points lower. This, remember, is on the average of ten shots. The indi- vidual patterns, you know, we have found to show a maximum difference of 64.4 points in fine wire is stretched verti- for chronograph THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN a 100-shot series. This is rather dis- couraging to the hunter when he real- izes that as he shoots at one duck he may have an 83.7% pat- tern, while the very next shot may throw only a 19.3% pattern. Yet these are the actual figures that we find, and we believe they are somewhere near the truth. The surprise is that hunters are able to kill such a large per- centage of the game they do. No doubt the explanation lies in the probability that the 19.3% pattern shot may hit the bird with one or two pel- lets in some vital spot, and bring him down. These in- teresting figures also help to explain the misses and cripples that attend every hunting trip. The most uniform test of ten shots for pattern occurred in the sixth string of Series No. 43, which showed only an ex- treme variation of 18 pellets, or 5.9 points, in the per- centage _ patterns. Perhaps it would be interesting to show this series in detail, shot for shot. It was fired on July 10, 1925.

Incidentally, these two tests represent different ammunition and powders. This test was fired on July 11, 1925. Temperature of range, 78° F.; rela- tive humidity, 75%; barometer, 29.24 inches; average velocity, 981 f. s.; average pressure, 3.25 tons. Shot No. Pellets Percentage SCOBNVAUPRWNHH Just how these ten high patterns on these two tests happened to get together is a mys- tery, as the average for the 100 shots in Series No. 43 is only 69.2%, and 67.7% in Series No. 42. Yet that is the way things are apt to happen in actual practice. When patterns are considered, particularly in speaking of them, it should always be in terms of percentage; that is, the percentage of the number of pellets in the load that hit within a 30-inch circle at 40 yards from the muzzle of the gun. The reason for this is because there is a rather large variation in the number of pellets in a given load. This is due to the difference in size of the pellets as made by different manufacturers, as well as the variation existing from lot to lot of RA eh tcl i Ae em lly ‘ oer * Front of target showing paper stretched from bottom roll to top roll for record- ing the pattern sesso eseeerenmeeneemeeeeeneneneee 18 THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN Vol. LXXV, No. 12 73.8 82.7 67.6 SERIES 17 SERIES 21 ber varies from load to load, as a loading oe.

C. McDougal, U. S. M. C., Team Cap- tain, and the National Rifle Association, and with the whole-hearted cooperation of the Ordnance Department and other sections of the War and Navy Departments, plans for the 1928 International Team are moving forward rapidly. Numerous Corps Area Tryouts have already been fired, as have also State Tryouts under the supervision of Adjutants General, and in several cases try- outs have been authorized on club ranges. Martini rifles complete and Martini ac- tions, to be assembled to American stocks and barrels, are being imported; Frankford Arsenal is busily engaged with the ammuni- tion problem; the Marines have a squad in training; and the two men from each branch of the Regular Army best fitted for the In- ternational Free Rifle Game are also to be placed in training. Civilians in all parts of the country are buying Free Rifle equipment or tuning up the equipment which they already have, and indications are that the gallery season this year and the early spring matches will see a greater interest in the offhand game than they have witnessed in many years. Particularly interesting experiments are being undertaken by Major Harry L. Smith, of the Marines, with the assistance of Major Hatcher, at Frankford Arsenal, to determine whether the accuracy of bar- rels may be improved by placing a lead jacket around the steel barrel. The idea, which was originally advanced by Colonel McDougal, is based on the thought that barrel vibration has a great deal to do with accuracy and that by surrounding the steel tube with an inert mass such as lead, barrel vibrations may be so dampened as to improve the accuracy. With all of these preparations being made by the shooters and officials connected with the team, it now behooves the sportsmen of the country who are interested in seeing America once more return a victor from Europe to support the 1928 team in every possible way. It is probable that the expense to the N. R. A. of sending the 1928 International Team abroad will be higher than has been the case in the past, because of the unusual efforts which are being made to get together the best possible men and material, regard- less of cost. Members of the Association and sportsmen in general are again asked for contributions to help beat the Swiss. It is suggested that clubs hold special benefit shoots, dances or smokers for the Inter- national Team Fund and that any prominent sportsmen in the locality who may not be members of the N. R. A. be told about what is going on and given an apportunity to con- tribute. The Secretary’s office is now accepting con- tributions for the 1928 “Beat the Swiss” Fund. Remittances may be made by check or postal or express money order and will be promptly acknowledged upon receipt. 583 DAD’S PARADISE By A. V. PERKINS GPEAKIN G literally, not spiritually, and not delving too far into a deep subject, Milton, the poet, might not have been inspired to com- pose his masterpiece, “Paradise Lost,” and might have saved himself the infinite trouble of again taking his pen in hand and worrying over his “Paradise Regained” had he first been introduced to the beautiful and tranquil scene pictured by and from Mr. R. S. Crozier’s Lagoon Island Rifle Range at Wappinger’s Falls, N. Y. Right here I might say that Mr. Crozier de- lights in the venerable euphonium, “Old Dad,” which his host of friends, admirers and fol- lowers have affectionately dubbed him, al- though, judging from his agility, brain activity, appearance, etc., I can not see where the term “old” can fit in, for whether rowing a boat, casting the plug or fly in his lake, or shooting prone or offhand on the range, he seems no older than the youngest, and his spirits are of the highest as he enters earnestly and fairly into the various contests in which he loves to take part. He surely is a game sport, as indicated in his many interesting and in- structive articles contributed to various sport- ing magazines, particularly THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN. So much for the man whom I wish all of you gun bugs could meet, which would surely result in a nice balance on the credit side for the Government training of future instructors of rifle-shooting needed in the infantry, which is always the backbone of the Army in troublesome times. As the result of a personal invitation from “Old Dad” my family and I enjoyed his hos- pitality and the use of one of his camps on Lagoon Island, Wappinger’s Lake, over the night before his shoot on May 1, which day proved to be a delightful one, although rather breezy for high scores on the range. When we arrived at his home late in the day, as twilight was creeping over the land- scape, “Old Dad,” true to his desire to always do his best for his comrades, was putting the finishing touches to his range for the benefit of his visitors on the morrow. We had an opportunity to inspect his fine and out-of-the- ordinary rifles—hunting and target—shotguns and combination rifle and double scatter gun, not forgetting the Russian sporter, nicely "
