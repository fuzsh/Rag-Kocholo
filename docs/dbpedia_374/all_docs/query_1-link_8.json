The sport of shooting's governing body is the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), formerly the Lâ€™Union Internationale de Tir (UIT), which was formed in 1907.\n\nThe father of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, was a pistol shooting enthusiast, and so the sport of shooting was one of the first sports to be added to the 1896 Summer Olympics, which were also held in 1900. However, following the latter event, shooting became an inconsistent sport on the Olympic schedule before gaining consistency at the 1932 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe men's top medal winners hail from the team events that took place between 1896 and 1924.

American Kim Rhode leads the women's medal table with six medals, including three golds.\n\nRead More : Olympic Torch Relay\n\nThe List of Olympic Medalists of Team USA in Shooting\n\nThe United States is leading the all-time medal table with a total of 116 medals, including 57 golds, while China is in second place with 67 total medals and 26 golds.
