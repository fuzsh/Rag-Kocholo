        "text": "Summary The idea of Utopia springs from a natural desire of transformation, of evolution pertaining to humankind and, therefore, one can find expressions of “utopian” desire in every civilization. Having to do explicitly with human condition, Utopia accompanies closely cultural evolution, almost as a symbiotic organism. Maintaining its roots deeply attached to ancient myths, utopian expression followed, and sometimes preceded cultural transformation. Through the next almost five hundred pages (virtually one for each year since Utopia was published) researchers in the fields of Architecture and Urbanism, Arts and Humanities present the results of their studies within the different areas of expertise under the umbrella of Utopia. Past, present, and future come together in one book. They do not offer their readers any golden key. Many questions will remain unanswered, as they should. The texts presented in Proportion Harmonies and Identities - UTOPIA(S) WORLDS AND FRONTIERS OF THE IMAGINARY were compiled with the intent to establish a platform for the presentation, interaction and dissemination of researches. It aims also to foster the awareness and discussion on the topics of Harmony and Proportion with a focus on different utopian visions and readings relevant to the arts, sciences and humanities and their importance and benefits for the community at large. https://www.crcpress.com/Utopias---Worlds-and-Frontiers-of-the-Imaginary-Proceedings-of-the-2nd/Rosario-Monteiro-Ming-Kong-Pereira-Neto/p/book/9781138197480\n\nThe Social idealism has been associated to utopia, where lots of trials have been taken aiming to reach the ideal state in different fields, such as: philosophy, technology, urban planning, politics, economy and others. The utopic thought have been also merged with architectural thought, that helped in the evolution of architecture and helped to present the futuristic city; as well as developing new technological, social and other typologies. The research examines the notion of idealism, and the relation of utopic thought with both architectural and urban thought. The research also reviews the utopic evolution, specially in architecture of the 20th century, that resulted in affecting both current and futuristic architecture."
