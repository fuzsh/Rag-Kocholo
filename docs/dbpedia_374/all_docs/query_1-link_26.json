        "text": "Step right up to witness the epitome of grace, strength, and flipping out in style. Artistic gymnastics, founded under the oldest international sports federation in 1881, has roots in ancient philosophy, mixing brawn with brains. Making its Olympic debut in 1896, it showcases gender-specific apparatus events that push the limits of human agility and co-ordination.\n\nMen tackle the floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars and horizontal bar. Women take on the vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise. Each routine is a blend of finesse and sheer guts, making even the most flexible among us feel like we’re in dire need of a stretch.\n\nFun fact: Men ruled the mats until 1928 when women finally got their chance to dazzle at the Amsterdam Olympics. Since then, artistic gymnastics has been a non-stop tumble and twirl of talent every four years.\n\nArtistic Swimming\n\nHold your breath for a splashy spectacle as artistic swimming dives into the history books with men competing for the first time at Paris 2024. Originally a male-dominated sport, it became a women’s realm until now.\n\nThink synchronised ballet, but in water, and with a soundtrack. The Olympic Games feature duets and team events, each requiring a free and technical routine where execution, sync, difficulty and choreography are judged meticulously.\n\nAthletes perform in a pool that’s 3 metres deep, 25 metres long and 20 metres wide, demanding extraordinary flexibility, strength and pinpoint precision. Imagine propelling yourself out of the water like a dolphin while pulling off mid-air acrobatics.\n\nFun fact: While the United States and Canada were initially dominant in artistic swimming at the Olympic Games, winning a combined total of 17 medals, including eight golds, the Russian Olympic Committee has emerged as the top-performing National Olympic Committee since the Sydney 2000 Games. They have won an impressive 12 consecutive gold medals in the sport.\n\nAthletics\n\nAthletics, the granddaddy of Olympic sports, is where history meets high-speed action. Dating back to 776BC, this ancient sport has sprinted through time to become the Olympics’ most participated event. The modern twist we know started in 19th-century England, and by 1912, World Athletics (then IAAF) took the reins.\n\nAthletics is the ultimate all-you-can-race buffet: sprints, middle-distance, long-distance, hurdles, steeplechase and relays, all on a 400m track. But wait, there’s more! Marathons and race walking take over public roads, demanding strategy and stamina. Then there are the heptathlon and decathlon, the two-day ultimate tests of versatility.\n\nMen’s events have been stable since 1932, while women’s events started in 1928 and have since caught up to offer equal competition. With 62 countries in the finals at Beijing 2008, athletics is truly global.\n\nFun fact: Athletics has been the Olympic showstopper since 1896, often dubbed the crown jewel of the Summer Games. If you’re looking for speed, strength and sheer willpower, this is where you’ll find it.\n\nBadminton\n\nBadminton, the globe-spanning racket sport with murky origins, started with battledore and shuttlecock, evolving in the 1860s at Badminton House in Gloucestershire (hence the name). The game spread from British estates to Indian military camps, before conquering the British colonies, Europe, and East Asia.\n\nIn badminton, it’s all about outwitting your opponent with a feathered projectile. Whether in singles or doubles, players hit the shuttlecock over a net, aiming for precision and making their opponents sweat. Matches are best-of-three games to 21 points, demanding agility and strategy.\n\nThe sport’s Olympic journey began in 1972 with a demo in Munich, followed by an exhibition in Seoul 1988, before becoming official in Barcelona 1992. Mixed doubles joined the fun in 1996. Come Paris 2024, 172 athletes will battle for glory.\n\nFun fact: If you think badminton is a global affair, think again. Asian countries have been the uncontested champs, bagging 106 out of 121 Olympic medals. Time to see if anyone else can break their winning streak!\n\nBasketball\n\nGrab your sneakers and hit the hardwood, because basketball, the brainchild of James W. Naismith, is all about action, skill and a bit of wintertime ingenuity. Dreamed up in 1891 to keep students moving indoors, Naismith’s game remains largely unchanged today.\n\nPlayed by two teams of five, the goal is simple: shoot the ball through a hoop 3.05m above the ground. What it demands, though, is a blend of endurance, agility, power and finesse that keeps fans on the edge of their seats.\n\nBasketball bounced into the Olympic scene in 1904 as a demo, becoming official at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Women’s basketball joined the fray in 1976 at Montreal, adding another layer of excitement to the games.\n\nThe US “Dream Team” of 1992, filled with NBA legends, is the stuff of basketball lore, steamrolling the competition in Barcelona. The US dominance is clear: the men’s team has snagged gold almost every time, with a few notable exceptions, while the women’s team has been on a golden streak since 1984, save for a bronze hiccup in 1992.\n\nFun fact: The United States has a strong historical dominance in basketball. The men’s team has won Olympic gold at every games except in 1972, 1980, 1988 and 2004. Similarly, the women’s team has been incredibly successful, winning gold at every games since 1984, with the exception of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, where they won bronze.\n\nBasketball 3x3\n\nTake traditional basketball, shrink it down to half a court and amp up the street vibe, and you get Basketball 3x3. Rooted in street ball, this fast-paced, high-energy version pits two teams of three against each other, sharing a single hoop. The clock ticks for 10 minutes or until one team hits 21 points first, making every play count.\n\nThe standard three-point line becomes the two-point line here, adding a twist to scoring. The sport’s surge in popularity is marked by the 3x3 World Tour and France’s 3x3 Superleague, where the game’s urban roots shine through with DJs and music creating a buzzing atmosphere.\n\nFun fact: 3x3 basketball made a splash at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore 2010, Nanjing 2014 and Buenos Aires 2018, packing in the crowds. The excitement hit a new peak when it debuted in the Olympic programme at Tokyo 2020, crowning its first Olympic champions.\n\nBeach Volleyball\n\nFrom the sun-kissed sands of Santa Monica in the 1920s to the global stage, beach volleyball has surged in popularity, becoming a thrilling Olympic sport. The first official beach volleyball tournament took place in 1947, but the 1950s saw it blossom into a competitive circuit on California’s beaches. The 1980s brought the first professional players’ union, and in 1987, the FIVB sanctioned the sport’s first international tournament.\n\nBeach volleyball is a dynamic game played by two teams of two on a smaller sand court—16m long and 8m wide—compared to its indoor cousin. The net height stays the same as indoor volleyball: 2.24m for women and 2.43m for men. Matches are a best-of-three sets affair, with the first two sets to 21 points and a deciding third set to 15 if needed.\n\nWith just two players covering the whole court, beach volleyball demands quick reflexes and incredible agility. The sport made a splash as an official Olympic event at the 1996 Atlanta Games, following a demo stint at Barcelona 1992.\n\nFun fact: Who would have thought but beach volleyball has been a medal magnet for Brazil and the United States, with a whopping 24 Olympic medals between them, including 10 golds. Germany, Australia and Norway have also had their golden moments on the podium.\n\nBoxing\n\nSince its modern debut in 1904, boxing has been a fixture at the Summer Games, except for Stockholm 1912, where it faced a Swedish ban. Women’s boxing landed its Olympic gloves in 2012, adding more power to the punch.\n\nThough its exact beginnings are shrouded in mystery, Sumerian artefacts hint at boxing’s ancient origins, finding a place in the ancient Olympic Games around 688BCE.\n\nAfter a hiatus post-Roman Empire, boxing found its gloves in 17th-century England, evolving into the sport we know today. The Olympic stage beckons aspiring pugilists, with only amateurs allowed to compete, creating a launchpad for future boxing legends like Muhammad Ali, who clinched gold at the 1960 Olympics.\n\nThe weight divisions have seen their share of tweaks, and while male boxers shed their headgear in 2016, female fighters still wear theirs. Each bout is a battle of skill and strategy, with three rounds of three minutes for men and four rounds of two minutes for women, scored by judges.\n\nFun fact: The United States has packed a punch in Olympic boxing, racking up an impressive 117 medals, with Cuba and Great Britain trailing closely behind.\n\nBreaking\n\nGet ready to groove as breaking, the urban dance sensation born in the streets of 1970s United States, steps into the Olympic limelight at Paris 2024. This electrifying dance form, rooted in hip-hop culture, will dazzle audiences with its acrobatic moves and stylised footwork.\n\nIn Paris, breaking will strut its stuff with two events - one for the guys and one for the gals. Sixteen B-Boys and sixteen B-Girls will take the floor in solo battles, showcasing their creativity and skills to the beats spun by the DJ.\n\nFrom windmills to six-steps and freezes, athletes will unleash their power moves, blending style and improvisation to win over the judges and snag those coveted Olympic breaking medals.\n\nBreaking’s journey from Bronx block parties to the global stage culminates in its Olympic debut, a testament to its status as a legitimate sport. This addition reflects the Olympics’ commitment to embracing diversity and new disciplines, marking a historic moment for the dance community.\n\nFun fact: Breaking’s Olympic debut follows its success at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, where it stole the show.\n\nCanoe Slalom\n\nOriginating in Switzerland back in 1932, this adrenaline-packed sport is making waves with a thrilling new event: Kayak Cross. Picture four competitors battling it out on the whitewater, combining all of canoeing’s disciplines in a heart-pounding race to the finish line.\n\nIn canoe slalom, it’s all about speed and precision as athletes navigate their boats through a maze of gates, aiming for the fastest time while dodging penalties. Canoeists kneel and paddle with a single-blade paddle, while kayakers sit and use a double-bladed paddle, each with their own set of rules.\n\nThese slalom showdowns unfold on artificial whitewater courses, creating a wild ride for competitors and spectators alike.\n\nFun fact: Canoe slalom made a splash at the Olympics in 1972 and earned its spot as a permanent fixture in 1992. But it’s been a European affair, with European nations snagging a whopping 90 per cent of all the medals.\n\nCanoe Sprint\n\nCanoe sprint races take place on flat water and feature sprints over various distances (women’s races are either over 200m or 500m, while men’s races are either 500m or 1000m), with one, two or four athletes per boat.\n\nCycling BMX Freestyle\n\nBorn from the imaginations of California’s youth in the 1970s, this urban sport is back for its second Olympic appearance, proving its popularity and potential on the global stage.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee was wowed by BMX Freestyle’s electrifying performances at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, cementing its spot in the Olympic line-up.\n\nIn the heart of an urban park, riders will unleash their creativity and skills in adrenaline-fuelled, 60-second showdowns. From jaw-dropping tricks to gravity-defying jumps, every move will be scrutinised by judges, with points awarded for difficulty, height and style.\n\nCycling BMX Racing\n\nOriginating from the motocross madness of 1960s California, BMX racing hit its stride in the early 1980s, evolving into a full-fledged sport.\n\nThe pedal-pounding action gained global recognition with the formation of the International BMX Federation in 1981 and its integration into the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 1993, setting the stage for its Olympic debut.\n\nIn BMX racing, it’s all about lightning-fast sprints lasting mere seconds. With up to eight riders tearing through a track peppered with jumps, banked corners and obstacles, it’s a heart-pounding battle of speed and agility.\n\nFun fact: Hold on tight as riders launch themselves from an eight-metre-high start hill, hitting speeds of up to 60km/h as they jostle for the lead and chase Olympic glory!\n\nCycling Mountain Bike\n\nIn the 1990s, mountain bikes specially crafted to tackle rough landscapes burst onto the scene, propelling the sport to new heights. What began as informal competitions in the late 1970s blossomed into the first official world championships in the 1990s.\n\nCross-country mountain bike racing takes centre stage, featuring thrilling events for both men and women. Riders kick off from the same line, tackling multiple laps around a challenging circuit. With twisty courses and mass starts, these races push riders’ technique, endurance and stamina to the limit, spanning one to two hours over tens of kilometres.\n\nFun fact: Despite its late Olympic entry in 1996 at the Atlanta Games, mountain biking has quickly become a fan favourite, carving its place in the Olympic pantheon a century after track cycling and road cycling took the stage.\n\nCycling Road\n\nDating back to the 19th century’s cycling renaissance, road cycling emerged with the advent of the chain-and-gearing system. The sport gained traction with the inaugural race documented in 1868 Paris, setting the stage for the exhilarating competitions to come.\n\nAt the Olympic Games, road cycling unfolds in two riveting events: the road race and the individual time trial. The road race, a gruelling journey spanning 120km for women and 200km for men, often crescendos into a heart-pounding sprint finish, demanding riders to strategically manoeuvre and conserve their energy.\n\nOn the flip side, the individual time trial is a solitary endeavour, where competitors embark on a race against the clock, starting at staggered intervals. Covering a shorter distance, typically under 50km, this event showcases the raw power and precision of each rider.\n\nFun fact: Road cycling has weathered its Olympic journey, featuring in the inaugural modern Olympiad in 1896. After a brief hiatus, it re-emerged in 1912 with the addition of the time trial. The women’s cycling saga began in 1984, evolving over the years to encompass both road race and time trial events. And here’s a twist: while pro cyclists were once barred from Olympic glory, they now pedal alongside amateurs, elevating the prestige of the Olympic stage.\n\nCycling Track\n\nIn the late 19th century, indoor track cycling burst onto the scene with the inaugural six-day race in London in 1878. This marked the genesis of a sport that would capture the hearts of fans worldwide, fuelled further by the formation of the International Cycling Association in 1892 and the launch of the first world championships in Chicago in 1893.\n\nTrack cycling unfolds within the confines of the velodrome, a 250m bowl-shaped arena pulsating with energy. Here, a large range of race formats for individuals and teams await, each demanding its own blend of strategy and strength. From tactical showdowns to displays of raw power, track cycling offers something for every aficionado.\n\nAcross its illustrious 120-year Olympic journey, track cycling has been a European stronghold, with nations like Great Britain, France, the Netherlands and Italy dominating the medal standings, leaving a legacy of speed and skill on the track.\n\nFun fact: Unlike road bicycles, track bicycles are fixed-gear and do not have brakes.\n\nDiving\n\nDive into the captivating world of aquatic elegance, where gravity-defying feats meet graceful precision.\n\nIn the early 19th century, gymnasts from Germany and Sweden pioneered the art of “fancy” diving, infusing their leaps into the water with mesmerising acrobatics. Their influence rippled across Europe, sparking the establishment of the Amateur Diving Association in 1901, following a breathtaking showcase by Swedish divers on British shores.\n\nAt the pinnacle of aquatic athleticism, the Olympic Games host eight diving events, spanning the three-metre springboard and the 10-metre platform, both in individual and synchronised categories for men and women.\n\nFrom the soaring heights of the three-metre springboard to the vertigo-inducing 10-metre platform, divers showcase a symphony of skill and finesse. Judges meticulously evaluate each dive, considering factors like the fluidity of movements, the intricacy of the dive and the seamless entry into the water. In synchronised diving, harmony between partners elevates the spectacle to new heights.\n\nFun fact: While Team USA athletes initially dominated the diving events at the Olympics, competitors from the People’s Republic of China have emerged as formidable contenders in recent years.

Despite its moniker, “the gentle way”, judo demands considerable physical exertion.\n\nDr Kano’s vision blended judo’s philosophical underpinnings with innovative educational methodologies, aiming to foster holistic development encompassing physical, intellectual, and moral facets. By refining and sanitising the more hazardous elements of ju-jitsu, judo transcended cultural boundaries, becoming the first martial art to captivate practitioners beyond Japan’s shores, particularly in Europe and France during the late 20th century.\n\nAt its core, judo seeks to unbalance opponents, either by throwing them to the ground, immobilising them with a pinning hold or inducing submission through joint locks or chokes. In competitions, scoring revolves around two pivotal metrics: the ippon and the waza-ari. An ippon signifies a decisive victory, awarded for a throw executed with finesse, grounding the opponent flat on their back or through submission or pinning for 20 seconds. A waza-ari, meanwhile, denotes a substantial but not conclusive throw or a pin lasting between 10 to 20 seconds. Two waza-ari equate to an ippon.\n\nJudo contests unfold within carefully delineated weight categories for both genders, with matches spanning four minutes. Overtime ensues if the score remains deadlocked after regulation time. Penalties loom for passivity or breaches of judo’s ethical ethos during matches.\n\nFun fact: Japan’s mastery of judo is unparalleled, with Japanese judokas clinching an impressive 96 Olympic medals.

The shot clock ticks away, urging players to unleash their offensive prowess or risk surrendering control to their adversaries.\n\nSince its Olympic inception, water polo has been a stronghold of European dominance, with Hungarian stalwarts etching their names in the annals of Olympic history. With a staggering 16 medals, including nine golds, Hungary stands as a colossus in the men’s medal table, a testament to their enduring legacy in the sport.\n\nFun fact: It was first developed in the rivers and lakes of mid-19th century England. In 1870, the London Swimming Association established rules for the sport to be played in indoor swimming pools.\n\nWeightlifting\n\nThe sport, which dates back to ancient Egypt and Greece, involves two lifts: the snatch and the clean and jerk.\n\nIn the snatch, athletes lift the bar from the floor to above their head in one movement, while the clean and jerk is a two-stage action of lifting the bar to the shoulders and then jerking it over the head.\n\nCompetitors will have three attempts at each lift, and their best results will be combined to determine the winner.\n\nWrestling\n\nInscribed upon sculptures and etched into the annals of history, wrestling emerges as one of the oldest athletic endeavours. Its origins harken back some 15,000 years, immortalised in the timeless struggle depicted in ancient reliefs and cave drawings.\n\nThe ancient Olympic Games bore witness to the titanic clashes of wrestlers, their sinewy forms locked in combat, vying for supremacy in both upright and ground wrestling disciplines. From these storied contests emerged the foundation of modern wrestling.\n\nToday, wrestling is divided into two distinct disciplines: Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling. In the grand tradition of its ancient predecessor, Greco-Roman wrestling pays homage to its storied heritage, restricting competitors to attacks above the waist, unleashing a symphony of strength and technique.\n\nConversely, freestyle wrestling embodies a more dynamic and fluid style, allowing athletes to employ a broader array of holds and manoeuvres, culminating in a breathtaking display of skill and agility.\n\nWithin the hallowed circle of combat, wrestlers engage in a relentless pursuit of victory, their trials unfolding over two intense three-minute periods. The goal remains unchanged: to secure a decisive “fall” by pinning the opponent’s shoulders to the mat or to amass the most points through a symphony of takedowns and reversals.\n\nFun fact: Japan has emerged as the most successful nation in women’s wrestling, winning 15 out of 24 possible gold medals."
