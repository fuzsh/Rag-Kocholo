        "text": "Shotguns\n\nTarget shooting with shotguns originated as practice for shooting game, usually upland game birds and waterfowl. For many years live pigeons were used, their release at unexpected angles offering good hunting practice. Live-pigeon shooting remained popular in France, Spain, and Italy in the second half of the 20th century. The live birds were replaced first by glass balls and ultimately by “clay pigeons.” The term trapshooting evolved from the box traps from which live pigeons are released. Trapshooting, also known for some time as inanimate bird shooting (especially in England where the Inanimate Bird Shooting Association was founded in 1893), was introduced into the United States about 1830. The sport became popular in Europe in the 19th century, and international competitions were held annually at Monaco and elsewhere. The American sport of skeet shooting was officially named in 1925.\n\nInternational competition and organization\n\nShooting has been an Olympic sport since the modern games began in 1896. In the early games there were events for army rifles and service pistols, as well as events for shooting running deer, boar, and live pigeons. Ultimately Olympic Games events became free pistol (from 1936), rapid-fire pistol (from 1948); small-bore rifle, prone and three positions: standing, prone, and kneeling (from 1900 and from 1952, respectively), air rifle (from 1984); clay pigeon (trapshooting) (1900–24, from 1952), skeet shooting (from 1968); and running target: running boar (1900 only, until revived from 1972). Early Olympic shooters were men, but women were not banned, and in the 1976 Games an American woman won the silver medal for rifle (three positions) having won the world’s championship. In 1984, however, three separate events were created for women—sport pistol, air rifle, and small-bore standard rifle (three positions). After the 1992 Games, the mixed gender events were dropped and replaced by skeet shooting, trapshooting, and double target trapshooting events for men and a double target trapshooting event for women.\n\nAlthough there was a world championship in 1897, later world championships fell under the supervision of the international governing body, the International Shooting Union (ISU), formed in 1907 and reorganized in 1919 and 1946. The organization changed its name to the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) in 1998.\n\nWorld championship competitions are with the small-bore rifle, free rifle, centre-fire pistol, free-pistol, rapid-fire pistol (.22 calibre), air rifle, air pistol, and shotgun. Running-deer and running-boar matches are fired with .22 rimfire or .222 centre-fire rifles with telescopic sights. All other guns have metal sights. The three positions for small-bore rifle are standing, prone, and kneeling at a range of 50 metres (55 yards). Three-position matches are held at 300 metres (328 yards) in free-rifle and army rifle competitions. Free-pistol matches are at 50 metres; centre-fire and rapid-fire competition is at 25 metres (27.3 yards). Targets are paper—either the concentric bull’s-eye type or, for rapid-fire pistol and running boar and deer, silhouettes."
