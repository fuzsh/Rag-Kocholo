This article analyzes Machado de Assis' fantastic short story \"O Pais das Quimeras\" and discusses how the author used fiction as a space to discuss important political matters of the Brazilian Empire through references found in his critics and chronicles. While not ignoring influences from 19th century fantastic literature, the analysis shows that Machado de Assis clearly conveyed his own political and artistic conceptions in the story. References are made to the story's publication in 1862 in the periodical \"O Futuro\" and how it reflected Machado de Assis' views during his early writing career.",
