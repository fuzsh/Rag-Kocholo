        "text": "Archery The bow-and-arrow heroics of Robin Hood and Errol Flynn excited a generation of Americans. The bow-and-arrow heroics of Olympic archery are something else.\n\nThe Olympic archers will wear not colorful costumes, but all white. There will be no noise and no cheering during the competition, the only sounds being the twang of arrows leaving bows. The archers will check their shots by telescope so they can adjust for their next shots, but spectactors without binoculars will have no idea who is doing what until the scores are announced.\n\nThe Olympics have two archery events - one for men and one for women. Three men and three women may enter from each nation. Each competitor shoots 288 arrows during 4 days. The men fire 72 arrows each from 90, 70, 50 and 30 meters, the women 72 arrows each from 70, 60, 50 and 30 meters.\n\nThe targets are made of compressed straw rope with thick paper faces. These five-colored targets are divided into 10 concentric rings. An arrow that lands in the center gold is worth 10 points, and the scores go down to 1 point for a shot in the outer white ring.\n\nFor the longer distances, the 10 ring is 4.8 inches in diameter, the size of an apple. For the shorter distances, the 10 ring is only 3.2 inches in diameter.\n\nThe bows are made of laminated fiberglass and wood. Sighting devices are allowed, but not magnifying lenses. The arrows are aluminum and color-coded because more than one competitor uses the same target. Arrows may travel 150 miles an hour. The archers have two and one-half minutes to make three shots. They compete six hours a day, even if it rains. Wind is a major enemy.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
