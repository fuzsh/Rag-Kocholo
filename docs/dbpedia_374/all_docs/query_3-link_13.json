Princeton, October 2016\n\nIntroduction\n\nNostalgia as a Historical Problem It is not easy to deal scientifically with feelings. sigmund freud, Civilization and Its Discontents (1930)\n\nIn the early nineteenth century nostalgia was less something one “felt” than something one “had,” in the way one might have tuberculosis, cholera, or a banal cold. It entailed seeing a doctor, who would examine the patient for a “melancholic expression,” or a “despondent physiognomy,” as well as a slew of physical signs including tachycardia, skin rashes, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), hearing difficulties, convulsions, heartburn, vomiting, diarrhea, and any rales or wheezing that a stethoscope might pick up in the chest. When satisfied with the diagnosis, the doctor could attempt to converse with the patient, prescribe an herbal infusion, or apply a dozen leeches to the anus, before deciding whether to recommend hospitalization or home care. The prognosis varied widely and could easily turn bleak in a matter of days, leading to severe emaciation, pulmonary edema, and other fatal complications. A routine autopsy might then reveal abnormal tissue inflammation and ulcerations in the brain, lungs, and intestinal tract—­all connected, so contemporary medical reports assured, to the original nostalgia.1 In short, the early 1800s was a time when nostalgia was a clinical disease (or a pathological condition with recognizable signs and symptoms), and when people not only had it, but also died of it. This book explains how this had come to be over the preceding hundred years and then ceased to be by the end of the century—­leaving us to indulge our nostalgic reveries without having to fear for our lives ever since. Despite its distinctly classical sound, nostalgia is a relatively recent thing, at least when measured against the deep history of humanity. Of course, the etymology of the word harkens back to the Greek root nostos, or homecoming, a theme that defines Homeric poetry—­whether in the Iliad or, most explicitly, the Odyssey—­and that can be found across ancient civilizations, from the Indian poem Mahabharata to the Epic of Gilgamesh and lesser-­known Egyptian tales. Figures of exile pervade the biblical tradition, and while longing for a home might not be a product of the fall, it may well be that of humankind’s\n\n2 Introduction\n\nsedentarization toward the end of the last glacial epoch (roughly 12,000 years ago, at the dawn of the Holocene).2 But tempting as they may be, these associations are equally deceptive, for the term “nostalgia” itself is of recent vintage, a neologism of the late seventeenth century. That it was an aspiring doctor who coined the word using Greek morphemes is indicative of the savant and medical matrix out of which nostalgia emerged. This is important, for while we may reasonably conjecture that humans have felt some kind of yearning at least ever since one of them decided “this is mine” and found others simple enough to believe him (to paraphrase Jean-­Jacques Rousseau’s celebrated Discourse on Inequality), and while we can all agree that we long for a baffling array of things today, what we can’t reasonably say is that we have always been nostal­ gic (or, conversely, that nostalgia is some sort of hardwired “basic emotion”).3 In fact, we might well have never been “nostalgic” if only the term’s inventor had opted for “philopatridomania” or one of the other unwieldy neologisms he toyed with before choosing the more elegant one. Can we imagine our world today without nostalgia? Could we seriously go about our business feeling “philopatridomanic” for the good old days? The disposition to desire that which we no longer have (or have never really had) may well be a universal and transhistorical human trait—­a question fit for philosophers or psychologists. But for the historian this emotional disposition matters only in its changing forms of manifestation—­that is, within historically determinate contexts and logics specific to a time and place. It is only in the Rhineland in the late 1600s that a certain form of longing was deemed to be pathological and turned into a medical condition to be diagnosed, treated, and, if possible, prevented. Like depression in Japan in the 1990s, ADHD in the 2000s, or gluten intolerance today, this clinical form of nostalgia was symptomatic of an incipient medicalization of society, of the creation of treatable disorders where there previously were none.4 Conversely, its eventual disappearance from medical and coroner’s reports signaled a process of demedicalization whereby the longing was no longer deemed dangerous and instead became naturalized. As trite as it may be, we must reluctantly concede unwitting truth to the clever cliché that nostalgia “ain’t what it used to be.”5 This book is, precisely, about what it once was. * Viewed historically, nostalgia therefore appears as an example of what Ute Frevert has astutely called an emotion “lost and found,” that is, a particular kind of feeling that gained momentum and faded away in a dynamic historical\n\nNostalgia as a Historical Problem 3\n\neconomy of emotions.6 It was first identified in 1688 in the Swiss town of Basel, by a nineteen-­year-­old medical student from nearby Mulhouse. Johannes Hofer fused the ancient Greek words νόστος, or nostos (homecoming), and άλγος, or algos (pain or longing), to describe a violent “passion of the soul” (or what we might today call a mood disorder) caused by the “burning desire” to return home. As the etymology of the word and title of his thesis—­Dissertatio medica de nostalgia, oder Heimwehe—­immediately reveal, this was a medicalized form of homesickness (Heimweh), a psychopathological response to displacement articulated primarily in space, as opposed to time. Hofer’s study succeeded in establishing a new diagnosis but has all but been forgotten since. It is available to us only in inadequate translation, and we know little about the circumstances in which it was written. This book begins, therefore, by navigating back to the upper Rhineland in its troubled, early modern age. To understand what drove Hofer to write about nostalgia, I seek clues both in a detailed exegesis of his surprising text and a sociopolitical contextualization of its medical imaginary. This clinical form of nostalgia was “lost” roughly two hundred years later, when most medical taxonomies dropped the diagnosis altogether. Isolated cases of nostalgia continued to be recorded thereafter, prompting the occasional call for a revamping of the disease entity. But to most people, the word itself had come to mean something quite different by the turn of the twentieth century: no longer a pathological form for homesickness but an innocuous, even comforting longing for the past—­an emotional disposition now tethered to time and memory. Few mourned the passing of clinical nostalgia in an age later to be known, fittingly enough, as a Belle Époque. We don’t even have a precise date to mark the end of its respectable medical career. In this book I have somewhat arbitrarily chosen 1884 as a reasonable proxy for a number of reasons, both general and that speak more specifically to my focus on France. The first reason has to do with changing conceptions of emotions in the Western world. The year 1884 was when the American psychologist William James published his landmark essay articulating a physiological conception of emotion that equated emotional experience with the perception of bodily changes. (In short, we don’t cry because sad but are sad because made to cry.) Though it had nothing to say about nostalgia itself, James’s article underscored a broader shift to an embodied, anticognitive (or anti-­intentionalist) understanding of emotion that, inter alia, helped transform nostalgia into an instinctual drive innate to human nature—­a process of naturalization that turned a pathological passion into a demedicalized emotion.7 As James’s colleague and correspon­ dent in Paris Théodule Ribot wrote a few years later, nostalgia had become an\n\n4 Introduction\n\nexample of “affective memory,” an innocuous “memory of the heart” best captured, perhaps, in the prose of Ribot’s contemporary Marcel Proust.8 The year 1884 also happens to be when the French army—­the single institution most familiar with clinical nostalgia up to that point—­officially recorded its last fatal case of homesickness in the ranks. Over the previous two centuries, the condition had become a major occupational hazard for soldiers, wreaking havoc in armed forces around the globe and forcing military physicians to explore emotional breakdown decades before the discovery of psychogenic trauma (and the establishment of military psychiatric units) by the end of the century. As recently as the 1860s thousands of men were still being diagnosed with clinical nostalgia during the American Civil War, and only a few years before that up to 18,000 Sudanese conscripts were believed to have died because of homesickness in the Egyptian army. Swiss mercenaries were nostalgia’s first and iconic victims, but it undoubtedly was the French that paid the highest tribute to the disease, starting with lethal epidemics that allegedly decimated entire companies of conscripts at the outbreak of the revolutionary wars in the 1790s. At the time, this was blamed on the men’s indomitable attachment to the “pays” (an almost primal affection for home and place) and linguistic diversity that prevented them from integrating the revolutionaries’ new national army. By 1884, however, such debilitating atavism had apparently been overcome, at least according to official statistics. After all, these were the years when peasants supposedly became Frenchmen, trading localism for a newly imaginable national-­cum-­imperial community taught to school pupils as a collective “national novel” (roman national).9 This was a time for the Third Republic to un­­ veil newfound imperial ambitions overseas, not heed to its people’s “mal du pays” (homesickness). Except this was also the moment when the French—­like so many others elsewhere—­turned massively to invented traditions and renewed forms of regionalism, becoming, in the process, a nation of willful (and at times ardent) nostalgics (albeit in the demedicalized Belle Époque meaning of the word).10 Nostalgia was thus not simply “lost” in the late 1800s; it was also “found anew,” as it were, hollowed out of its pathogenic substance and plastered with a new meaning. In this respect it differs from what Ian Hacking has called “transient mental illnesses,” that is, meteoric psychiatric conditions (such as fugue syndrome) that come and go in a relatively short span of time, having briefly caught the popular imagination.11 For sure, clinical nostalgia had its own “golden age” in the 1820s and 1830s, when it outgrew medical discourse to reach a lay audience. Yet it remained in use for considerably longer than other fleeting nineteenth-­century conditions, such as monomania or neurasthenia, and did\n\nNostalgia as a Historical Problem 5\n\nnot simply disappear, phlogiston-­like, when it fell out of favor with physicians. Instead, it lived on to become a general cultural category, a universal—­if not quite a “basic”—­emotion that lies “at the very core of the modern condition,” in the words of one of its foremost contemporary scholars.12 Here the trajectory of nostalgia bears more resemblance with those of melancholy or hysteria, emotional syndromes with a long historical pedigree reaching all the way back to antiquity that have both entered our common lexicon following phases of medical interest (albeit with nothing like the currency that “nostalgia” has).13 If there undoubtedly is a certain transience to the history of nostalgia, it is a tortuous one drawn out over the longue durée. Nostalgia therefore confronts the historian as a historical problem, an emotional disposition at once historically determinate and one that outlived its own conditions of possibility, as it were, to become seemingly timeless. The same might be said for its geographical scope: born, as I will argue, out of a unique set of circumstances, it has become a global currency—­an example of cultural imperialism that paradoxically lays claim to an underdetermined form of subjectivity reproduced serially all around the world (and that we might therefore label “glocal”). The paradoxes go on, for what was once thought of as a longing for a lost authenticity has come to connote something thoroughly inauthentic, which smacks of ersatz emotion.14 In fact, the more we look at it, the more nostalgia perplexes. It always has: in the late 1700s the Scottish phy­ sician William Cullen dubbed it an “uncertain disease,” not being able to decide where, exactly, it should fit in the sprawling medical taxonomies that were the rage in his day. (He ended up placing it alongside bulimia and nymphoma­ nia.)15 Today psychologists assure us that this is a “positive emotion,” more sweet than bitter, which “soothes the self from existential pangs by solidifying and augmenting identity” (and which is therefore to be distinguished from a “genuine” disorder such as homesickness).16 For all those who still doubt, neuroscientists find answers aplenty in colorful brain neuroimaging, where Proust’s madeleine meets the MRI scanner.17 None of this is to say that the clinical form of nostalgia that interests me here was not really a disease, only an eye-­catching fad of some sort (although it was that too!). In this book I take seriously the historical ontology of nostal­ gia, an immaterial object “at once real and historical,” and that first “came into being” as an object of scientific enquiry, to paraphrase Lorraine Daston.18 In my reading nostalgia was neither “discovered” ready-­made, straight out of the box, nor was it “invented” ex nihilo, in a stroke of medical genius. Its “making” entailed a bit of both, while also answering to abstract historical logics beyond any single person’s control. But was it truly ontos on, “really real,” and not\n\n6 Introduction\n\nanother example of what is sometimes called “historical misdiagnosis”? The epistemological conundrums of retrospective diagnosis interest me only insofar as I seek to understand what clinical nostalgia actually meant to those who diagnosed it and those who were diagnosed with it. Whether or not the latter did in fact suffer from nostalgia, and not something else, is a moot point (as redundant as it is to ask today whether First World War soldiers actually suffered from “shell shock,” or as it might conceivably be one day to ask whether people really died of tuberculosis, or AIDS, in the same way as we suspect that thousands did not really succumb to the dreaded “English sweate” in late medieval Europe). What matters is that for roughly two centuries it made sense, for both medical and extramedical reasons, for doctors to diagnose their patients with something they called nostalgia and that the latter experienced as wrenching homesickness. It matters equally that nostalgia did not then just go away, but instead became something quite different, and yet so familiar it has been thought of as natural ever since. Chameleonlike, uncanny at times, nostalgia must be studied both empirically, as a historical object like any other (albeit an immaterial one), and reflexively, as a category of historical understanding itself. * Our nostalgia of today seems far removed from these metaphysical subtleties, a ubiquitous emotion seemingly triggered by the mere glimpse of a washed-­ out sepia-­tone photograph, but one singularly flattened in its meaning. In late 2015 a basic Google search produces roughly as many hits for the word as for “climate change,” “terrorism,” or the “Beatles” (and incomparably more than for any of the mental disorders it was once associated with). While promising salutary escapism from an unsatisfactory present (or a worrisome future), nostalgia has quietly conquered the past and colonized the most remote corners of our globalized world, becoming a household term in most languages and spawning a commercially successful aesthetic branded as “retro” or “vintage.” Impervious to crises, the “nostalgia industry,” as it has been called, means big business, and as each new hit historical TV drama reminds us, the past remains “the foreign country with the healthiest trade of all.”19 Among its best clients are academics, who turned to nostalgia starting in the 1970s and now discuss its merits at the four corners of university quads, from literature and philosophy to sociology and anthropology, and from psychology and media labs to business schools.20 First broached by cultural studies and postmodern-\n\nNostalgia as a Historical Problem 7\n\nism, nostalgia has found particularly prolific niches in interdisciplinary fields like media and memory studies and in relation to topical areas of interest such as consumption, migrations, heritage, and the environment.21 According to some, it is even emerging out of the shadow of trauma and the conservative politics it has long been associated with to reveal unsuspected self-­reflexivity and critical proclivities.22 For their part, and with a few notable exceptions, historians have successfully resisted the nostalgia bug. This shouldn’t surprise given the profession’s deep-­seated mistrust of anything pertaining to the fuzzy world of the human psyche and its careful policing of the border between “warm,” living memory and “cold,” dispassionate history. Despite the institutionalization of cultural history, the coming and going of memory studies, and recent interest for the history of emotions, Charles Maier’s pithy jab that “nostalgia is to memory what kitsch is to art” remains true for most historians.23 This is regrettable, and not only because any historical explanation of human action that is blind to feelings is worth as much as economic models based solely on rational choice theory, but also because by refusing to take nostalgia seriously, as a historical category (even in all its perceived oddities and deceptiveness), we tacitly allow it to prosper in its polished presentist form, as a naturalized, ahistorical, and universal feeling. A first goal of this book is thus to denaturalize nostalgia, to tell it like it isn’t (instead of letting it tell the past “like it wasn’t” and shape our present accordingly).24 Three decades ago Malcolm Cross and Christopher Shaw bemoaned the one-­dimensional view most of their colleagues held about nostalgia, a “protean and pervasive” concept for which they sought to parse a preliminary typology and a set of core features.25 Tellingly, it took a literary scholar (and an émigré) in Svetlana Boym to insist that nostalgia was a “historical emotion, [ . . . ] coeval with modernity itself.”26 In a series of influential studies—­arguably the first sustained engagement with the topic by a cultural historian—­Peter Fritzsche has painted a vivid impression of how this came to be in the wake of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, a period of epic rupture and displacement that spawned a new historical consciousness pre­ mised on a linear conception of accelerating time and irretrievable loss. Fritzsche explains how ruins became a favorite object for this new historical sensibility and émigrés its archetypal subjects. He finds a kind of nostalgic Urform in the melancholy figure of the French romantic René de Chateaubriand (in spite of the fact that Chateaubriand only ever used the word once in his magnum opus, the Mémoires d’outre-­tombe, and in a strict medical sense at that).27 Once again, it is literary scholars who have continued this work of historicization, mapping\n\n8 Introduction\n\nout an emergent nostalgic “structure of feeling” in relation to new understandings of memory, subjectivity, and aesthetics, particularly among German and British romantics.28 In this book I too seek to understand how an evolving nostalgic sensibility developed over time and in relation to momentous historical change. But my approach differs in two important respects: first, I argue for the necessity of reaching further back in time, to explore in detail nostalgia’s first, medical incarnation; second, I insist on looking beyond the purview of educated elites and literary sources in order to grasp this nostalgia as a social phenomenon grounded in everyday practices. To discern what nostalgia once was, our best guides remain medical historians Jean Starobinski and George Rosen, as well as more recent fellow travelers including Michael Roth, Sylvain Venayre, and Simon Bunke, all of whom have contributed to mapping out the term’s medical genealogy.29 Now sixty years old, Starobinski’s pioneering article still is the authoritative source on the subject, a durability we may in part attribute to its foresight in describing nostalgia both as an “emotion” (“sentiment”) and a “concept,” a case study for “historical semantics.” But while much has been written about what we might call nostalgia’s “conceptual history” (Begriffsgeschichte), we know a lot less about how its discursive construction relates to the concrete activities of those who first used the term and those who first experienced its effects. As Susan Matt has recently shown regarding homesickness in American history, teasing this subjective side to the story out from underneath set cultural representations brings to light a rich emotional life and psychic makeup that can challenge established narratives (notwithstanding all the necessary skepticism with which one must approach subjective experiences).30 We catch glimpses of what it felt like to have this nostalgia in a spate of recent studies of soldiers’ psychological breakdown during the American Civil War—­ the first and last conflict for which we have both relatively reliable medical statistics and extensive soldiers’ writings (letters and diaries) on the condition. Curiously, there is nothing comparable for earlier nineteenth-­century conflicts, nor for those people who allegedly suffered the most from nostalgia (and certainly wrote about it the most): the French. There are practical reasons to this, not least low levels of literacy and the absence of reliable medical statistics before the mid-­1800s. But as both Marcel Reinhard first showed in a largely forgotten article on nostalgia in the French army during the 1790s, and Alice Bullard has done for fatal homesickness among deported communards in New Caledonia, it is possible to unearth archival sources and ego-­documents on clinical nostalgia in the country where it became something of a national disease.31 These are, for sure, fragmentary and patchy sources; but this book\n\nNostalgia as a Historical Problem 9\n\nmakes no apology for drawing reasonable hypotheses from incomplete data sets and for relying, where necessary, on a conjectural paradigm. Insofar as the historian’s quest for objectivity was ever more than a noble dream, it is surely a fantasy to imagine actually getting at unmediated expressions of what dead people really felt.32 My expectations are more modest, but not trivial for as much: by putting personal writings and archival documents (including medical reports, hospital returns, military manuals, police files, and colonial settlement projects) into dialogue, I seek to both don the clothes of the ethnographer and approach clinical nostalgia with hermeneutic sensibility, while holding onto a steady empiricism unusual for a topic more readily thought of as poetic than coated in thick archival dust. Crucial to this dual approach are what I call the practices of clinical nostalgia, the semiotic (or meaning-­making) actions of all sorts—­linguistic, cognitive, gestural, both intentional and nonintentional—­through which a new historical object expressing a certain kind of subjectivity came into being. Following Monique Scheer, we might view these as “emotional practices,” that is, as performative acts and behaviors that mobilize, define, communicate, and regulate feelings that are at once embodied, cognitive, and socially embedded (and as such are anchored to a Bourdieuian notion of habitus).33 In this book, I argue that practices such as the therapeutic protocols and professional strategies of doctors, the daily maneuvering, longing, and letter writing of soldiers, or the construction of colonial settlements and lifeworlds are fundamental to understanding the historicity of nostalgia, for unlike culturalist notions of epistemic shifts, they can account for how nostalgia both appeared at a precise historical moment and came to be viewed as a benign, inherent feature of human nature. This is because in the long run semiotic practices become habitual and, when aggregated, produce “anonymous” social structures that are reified and appear as given. In other words, what had once caused nostalgia as an ontological disease (an external thing) might eventually also make it into an instinctual (internal) drive, without there being a clear intentionality or awareness on behalf of its human agents. As William H. Sewell notes, this ongoing formation of “real abstractions” from congealed forms of practice becomes particularly pronounced with the development of capitalism, understood as a historically specific but dynamic social formation that hinges on a peculiar, dialectical form of temporality at once linear and cyclical. What makes nostalgia a particularly modern phenomenon is not simply that it is tethered to rupture and loss along a linear sense of “homogeneous empty time,” but rather that it is bound up in a contradictory logic of creative destruction by which “continuity and discontinuity are not categorically opposed states but mutually constitutive ‘moments’\n\n10 Introduction\n\nin an ongoing temporal process.”34 This, I suggest, is the key to understanding the contradictions and perplexing ambiguities of nostalgia’s historical trajectory. * This book is subtitled “War, Empire, and the Time of a Deadly Emotion”—­a somewhat belabored way of defining its large scope of analysis. We start in the upper Rhineland in the late 1600s, a place of precarious living in times of change. Mulhouse was then an independent Protestant enclave coveted by its larger neighbors, the Holy Roman Empire and Louis XIV’s kingdom of France. It owed its continued existence to an old alliance with Swiss cantons (nearby Basel in particular), which regularly sent companies of soldiers to protect their ally throughout the wars of religion—­a fact that Hofer never lost sight of while researching worrisome stories of distressed Swiss pikemen wilting to a mysterious disorder far from their homes. Chapter 2 zooms out to the transnational networks of scientific knowledge in eighteenth-­century Europe, to follow competing explanations for this new disease entity. From Basel to Göttingen, Edinburgh to Montpellier and on to Philadelphia, nostalgia became a staple feature of Western medical nosology, one particularly associated to the plight of soldiers. With the outbreak of the French revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–­1815), it spread like wildfire in the ranks, especially among “citizen-­soldiers” conscripted into the French republican armies. Chapter 3 examines how French military doctors and administrators confronted endemic nostalgia from Valmy to Waterloo and Egypt to Haiti, showing surpris­ing resourcefulness to define the first clinical protocols for treating war neuroses. In chapter 4, I adopt a more ethnographic approach and look at the condition from the perspective of the soldiers themselves, based on their own narratives of illness. I argue that the experience of war brought soldiers to view their home­­ sickness as a coping mechanism as much as a disease, and veterans to look back upon their service with misty eyes. From a strictly empirical point of view, these were the first instances of a benign form of temporal “nostalgia” as we have known it ever since. In the short term, the extraordinary saliency of (fatal) nostalgia during the Napoleonic Wars prompted a flourishing of medical research on the condition in France—­the topic of chapter 5. Clinical nostalgia’s golden days were brief, however, and this relatively precise medical term gradually gave way to a looser concept available to vernacular usage as well (not least by romantic authors). But the naturalization of nostalgia into a “normal” piece of people’s emotional\n\nNostalgia as a Historical Problem 11\n\nlives was a slow process laden with obstacles.35 At midcentury, Algeria was the biggest one confronting French soldiers and settlers who continued battling deadly longings (on top of Arab resistance and other diseases) in their quest to establish a colonial presence in North Africa. Chapters 6 and 7 follow nostalgia “in the tropics” and show the many surprising ways in which la nostalgie africaine shaped efforts to turn Algeria into a piece of France after 1850, long before the days of postcolonial nostalgérie. Paradoxically, it was the acceleration of European imperialism and triumph of “scientific” racism in those years (as well as radical changes in psychiatric taxonomies) that definitively undermined nostalgia as a viable medical diagnosis. By the time many more soldiers from all over the world marched to battle in 1914, few were those who worried about them succumbing to bouts of homesickness. Though it was thought of primarily as a soldiers’ (and, to a lesser extent, sailors’) disorder—­almost like an occupational disease—­clinical nostalgia assembled a long cast of occasional victims over the course of its two-­century-­long existence. These included displaced people of all sorts (but not necessarily any sort), from permanent emigrants and colonial settlers to exiles and chattel slaves. Traveling far from home was not always necessary, and doctors also singled out seasonal migrant laborers, domestic servants, and boarding school pupils, as well as hospital (or asylum) patients and prison inmates as populations at risk. On the other hand, everyone agreed that peddlers, itinerant journeymen, and tourists—­a new phenomenon in the late 1700s and 1800s—­ rarely suffered from homesickness, if at all. What nostalgia’s victims all had in common, therefore, was not so much travel and displacement (though that certainly helped) as a shared sense of isolation and estrangement in a foreign place. In some respects, they resemble those “self-­mutilated” people (who have lost a sense of self) that the sociologist Erving Goffman identified within “total institutions” (that is, secluded places of both work and residence where individuals live a collective and rationally administered life removed from their families and relations). Perhaps even more striking is the overlap between this list of victims and the “docile bodies” that Michel Foucault identified as prime targets for modern institutions’ disciplinary powers. At the very least, it seems necessary to think of clinical nostalgia not only in terms of spatial displacement, but of social “disembedding”—­that is, as a medicalized, emotional reaction to the experience of being “lifted out” of a localized, dense network of social relations and exposed to new spatial and temporal regimes.36 But this was not necessarily how contemporaries viewed the condition: from its inception, nostalgia had multiple, competing explanations that vied for supremacy in the rapidly changing medical world of early modern Europe.\n\n12 Introduction\n\nIn the early days, it was an atmospheric account based on air pressure differ­ entials that held sway. It was supplanted in the second half of the eighteenth century by a vitalist explanation that placed emphasis on nerves and sentiments. In the early 1800s, the pendulum swung back to deterministic models premised on organic lesions, physiological adaptation to new environments (seasoning), and, eventually, specious theories of racial degeneration. Throughout, the disease itself was likened not just to sociological groups of people, but also to national, regional, and racial characteristics as well. From the beginning, and despite repeated attempts at debunking the myth, nostalgia was labeled a Schweizerkrankheit, a specifically Swiss disease. In the nineteenth century it also became a “mal français,” at least according to French doomsayers worried about British imperial ascendancy. Most doctors felt that it was prevalent among isolated, mountainous communities, whether because unaccustomed to traveling far from home or because of a hereditary predisposition passed on from one generation to another. In the age of empire, nostalgia became a prerogative of “primitive” people, unadapted (for better or worse) to the travel, speed, and anonymity of modern civilization. To account for clinical nostalgia’s conditions of possibility—­that is, to explain how it could be at once a general and specifically French phenomenon, shared by well-­drilled conscripts and plants that did not take to new climates—­is no simple task. At present, it will suffice to adumbrate five principal “axes” (or “vectors”) that undergird the condition’s tortuous historical trajectory.37 Inevitably, the first of these is medical: nostalgia appeared during a fluid, transitional period in Western medicine, as a result of competition between medical theories and taxonomies that vied to supplant receding humoral models. Dualists and monists, animists and materialists, Lockean sensationalists, vitalists, medical geographers, hygienists, alienists (early psychiatrists), phrenologists, anatomical pathologists, race theorists, even homeopaths—­virtually all medical schools and specializations that coexisted before the advent of bacteriology (and modern psychiatry) in the late nineteenth century had their own explanation (and cure) for the condition. Of them all, military doctors (physicians and surgeons of various stripes) were by far those that had the most experience of and things to say about clinical nostalgia. This was espe­cially true in the French army medical corps, the first and, for a long time, largest and most prestigious institution of its kind. Here we have a second axis, one that begins to account for the French focus over the following pages: throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, subordinate medical officers claimed expertise on nostalgia as a way of advancing their professional agenda and raising their stock in the army. Not that their\n\nNostalgia as a Historical Problem 13\n\nintentions were exclusively instrumental: as products of the military enlightenment and the age of sensibility more in general, they were, for the most part at least, humanists also genuinely concerned with the physical and mental well-­ being of the men. Nostalgia was, and in many ways could only be, a product of this age of reason and passion. But this was also a time in which large standing armies became the norm in Europe, a trend that provides a third context for understanding nostalgia as a historical phenomenon. These rationalized military institutions have often been presented as laboratories of modern social transformations (from bureaucratization to division of labor) and the drilled, disciplined infantry automa­ ton as emblematic of a new kind of modern heteronomy. Less well known is the fact that they also were incubators for deadly outbreaks of nostalgia, which thus surely had something to do with the imposition of regimented lifestyles, the semipermanent separation from civilians (in all-­male, uniformed, and barracked environments), and perhaps even a new scale of mass destruction already discernible in this age of preindustrial warfare.38 But this doesn’t explain the particular propensity for outbreaks of nostalgia among Swiss mercenaries or among volunteers and conscripts in the French revolutionary armies and Union forces during the American Civil War. Convenient labels do a disservice here: as contemporaries already noted, Swiss hired soldiers had more in common with French and American “citizen-­soldiers” (whether volunteers or draftees) than they did with Renaissance condottieri, for whom an ideal like patriotism meant very little indeed, or relentlessly drilled Prussian serfs. There is, in fact, a fourth factor that seems to play into the frequency and severity of nostalgia epidemics in these armies: the moral paradox (and political challenge) of mobilizing free individuals and convincing them to submit to a form of domination in the name of an abstract goal (such as the “nation”). The homesickness of the citizen-­soldier was more than mere sadness and suffering; it was an experience of alienation from self as well as a test of motivation. That it came to be thought of so forcefully in spatial terms—­as a “home-­sickness”—­ is surely a consequence of the accrued mobility of early modern societies and particularly of early modern armies (the fifth and final vector for clinical nostalgia). This was, yet again, a general phenomenon; but it took on a distinctive saliency in a country like France, where limited emigration and deep-­seated belief in its people’s sedentarism somehow coexisted with grandiose imperial ambitions and paranoid fears about vagrants, workers, and draft dodgers on the move. Taken together, these parameters can account for clinical nostalgia’s coming into being as an object of medical interest and can help explain how it could\n\n14 Introduction\n\nbe at once a generalized and a specifically French phenomenon (as opposed to, say, a British one, where qualms about citizen-­soldiers and unadventurous emigrants were unheard of). They can even help us understand the demise of nostalgia as a medical entity, with the disappearance of one or more of these vectors in the second half of the nineteenth century (a propitious medical con­­ text most importantly). But what they can’t address, is why the very word “nos­­ talgia” didn’t just disappear with the disease, but instead survived itself, as it were, to live on as something quite different. In this book, I argue that it isn’t sufficient to talk of nostalgia having been “interiorized” (with psychoanalysis, for example) or transformed by events and cultural movements (no matter how epochal), such as the French Revolution or romanticism. Instead, we need to think of nostalgia’s naturalization into a benign emotion as a protracted and contradictory process, inscribed within a dialectical logic of historical transformation. It is, strictly speaking, anachronistic to speak of clinical nostalgia in terms of “time” and “emotion.” No doubt would it have been more appropriate for the book’s subtitle to include the words “space” and “disease,” for that is what nostalgia was: a pathological condition thought of in synchronic, spatial terms. Yet thinking clinical nostalgia in terms of changing “regimes of historicity” (or the ways in which a given social group experiences past, present, and future) and emotional regimes and practices is necessary to understand how an occasional disease could become an (ostensibly) natural feeling.39 By looking at nostalgia not just as a disease or a cultural trope, but as an emotion—­that is, a performative act, a cognitive (if not always fully conscious) form of practice—­I seek to grasp both its epochal nature and its inner, temporal logics.40 Contrary to most discussions of nostalgia that single out a linear and runaway conception of time as its basic chronological blueprint, I emphasize its embeddedness in a dialectical temporality that is both linear and cyclical, punctuated by discontinuities and structural continuities. It is a temporality at once oriented to the future and that constantly dredges up the past, thus allowing for the experience of longing both as loss and imaginative recall (and eventually rather more concrete repetition as well).41 In chapter 4 I explore the crystallization of this peculiar kind of modern temporality as a subjective experience by looking both at how Napoleonic-­ era soldiers came to “own” their nostalgia as an emotional coping mechanism rather than a disease, and how veterans ended up longing for the very war­ time that had caused them to feel nostalgic in the first place. In chapters 6 and 7 I trace the objectified (concrete) manifestations of multiple, contradictory temporalities at play in the simultaneous imposition of a rationalized colonial\n\nNostalgia as a Historical Problem 15\n\nmodernity and the (re)discovery of “archaic” forms of belonging (traditional rural villages and built environments) in colonial North Africa in the late 1800s. By referring to nostalgia as an “emotion” throughout, I seek to engage both current psychological literature and the historical study of emotions, a subfield that has, in spite of the profession’s misgivings, successfully established itself in recent years.42 Eschewing specialized scientific debates on the nature of emotion itself, I use the terms “emotion,” “feeling,” and “structures of feeling” interchangeably—­as moments in a unique body-­mind-­society emotional complex—­but conversely avoid “affect” due to its heavily connoted usage in literary and neuroscientific research as a presemiotic, biological bedrock of emotional life.43 In this book, nostalgia is a resolutely historical emotion; but it is also what Jan Plamper has called a “meta-­concept,” that is, a transtempo­ ral category that allows for variation over time and place while recognizing suf­­ ficient shared characteristics to talk about the same thing throughout (thus avoiding both the false certainties of universalist perspectives and the paralyzing uncertainties of nominalism in social constructivist ones).44 This is, in other words, a social and conceptual history of an emotion over the longue durée, of how people’s lives and feelings were reconfigured over two hundred years and across three continents. While it therefore frequently zooms out to wide angles and fast-­paced narratives, this book also cautions against historians’ current itch to go deep and global at all costs, pleading instead for the continued necessity of narrower frames and “effects of scale” to adequately grasp a multilayered social reality in which people are sentient beings and not just data points.45 In our age of big data, it is all too easy to forget just how local history feels or how every “great” divergence and transformation is but an aggregate of smaller, even intimate, but no less vital ones. What Nostalgia Was is an attempt to show how the “birth of the modern world” played out overseas, across the valley, at home—­always in people’s heads.46\n\nChapter 1\n\nNostalgia in 1688 Home is where one starts from. t . s . e l i o t , East Coker (1940)\n\nJohannes Hofer’s 1688 Dissertatio medica de nostalgia, oder Heimwehe was perhaps destined to never feature in medical history textbooks. This was, after all, but the work of a medical student who chose to write on a disease no one had then heard of, and that we would be hard pressed to find in any medical taxonomy today. An unlikely medical maverick, Hofer cannot be credited with any lasting contribution to the Western medical tradition, despite serving the profession diligently throughout his life as a general practitioner in his hometown of Mulhouse. Nevertheless, he did bequeath to posterity a term that has, for better or worse, become second nature to modern life—­almost a “keyword” in its own right, but one with a little-­known medical genesis. The quest to understand where our modern infatuation with nostalgia comes from must therefore begin with the term’s unlikely inventor and the clinical hypotheses of a nineteen-­year-­old. As Jean Starobinski remarks, by providing a scientific name for and full clinical description of what had hitherto been a vernacular category, Hofer transformed “an emotional phenomenon [Heimweh] into a medical phenomenon [nostalgia].”1 Why he did so, and what this says about the time in which he lived, are the questions this chapter seeks to elucidate. Briefly put, my argument is twofold: that seventeenth-­century clinical breakthroughs and evolv­ing medical theories enabled Hofer to conceive of nostalgia in a way that closely resembled contemporary understandings of melancholia and other emotional disorders; but that medical transformations alone cannot account for the perceived need to devise a new diagnostic category (rather than use an existing one). As a detailed exegesis of Hofer’s remarkable text reveals, the\n\nF i g u r e 1 . 1 .

Rather, to grasp its conditions of possibility we must cast our net further afield, beyond medicine itself, to the broader social, political, and intellectual forces that shaped Hofer’s life and that of his contemporaries. Nostalgia, it turns out, was born of a time of conflict and gener­ alized instability, a “General Crisis” that rocked much of Europe—­and the upper Rhineland in particular—­throughout the seventeenth century.\n\nA n U n l i k e ly M e d i c a l M av e r i c k Johannes Hofer was born in the Alsatian town of Mulhouse on May 2, 1669, the last of twelve siblings in a prosperous family of prominent local pastors. We know little of his childhood, other than the fact of his father’s premature death when Johannes was only six years old. It certainly was stern and studious in keeping with Mulhouse’s official Calvinist piety. Most likely, it also taught the young man the proud history of his hometown, an independent and staunchly republican enclave within the Holy Roman Empire since the fourteenth century. Hofer would already have been well versed in humanist, moral, and civic traditions when, barely a teenager, he followed his ancestors’ footsteps to continue his studies in the neighboring town of Basel, home to the first Swiss university. He read philosophy and theology for three years and, in 1685, opted to heal bodies rather than souls by enrolling in medical school.2 As it turned out, he would end up curing both. Established by papal bull in 1459, the University of Basel emerged out of the wars of religion as a leading institution of higher education in Protestant Europe, attracting students from nearby Rhineland and German states. Its medical faculty courted controversy in 1527 when Paracelsus famously burned Avicenna’s Medical Canon (the main reference work of medieval medicine), but thereafter became a reputable center for learning, book printing, and the liberal humanism typical of reformed cities. For much of the seventeenth century, the dominant natural philosophy taught in Basel was an eclectic synthesis of Aristotelianism and Ramism, the iconoclastic body of thought developed by the Huguenot Petrus Ramus (who also lectured at the university before being murdered during the St. Bartholomew’s day massacre). Medieval scholasticism was therefore already on the defensive when Cartesianism was introduced into the classrooms in the 1660s, prompting a major curricular reorientation toward empiricism and new chemical and physical explanatory models.3\n\n20 Chapter One\n\nWhen Hofer matriculated in 1685, he therefore entered an institution and a larger medical profession undergoing unprecedented transformations. He found close mentors in two junior professors, both graduates of the medical school: Jacob Harder, who taught rhetoric and physics before claiming the chair of anatomy and botany in 1687 (the lowest of three full professorships, after those of medical theory and medical practice); and Theodor Zwinger, the scion of an important family of doctors from Basel, who held the chair of eloquence during Hofer’s studies, before also moving on to the chairs of anatomy and practical medicine thereafter. By the mid-­1680s Harder and Zwinger had become established experimental researchers and Basel’s leading advocates of the “iatromechanical” and “iatrochemical” challenge to orthodox humoral medicine.4 Based on the faculty’s course catalog, Hofer’s biographer has estimated that the young student spent the bulk of his training learning about brain anatomy, the organs of the senses, organic viscera, and experimental chemistry with his professors.5 It is almost certainly in these classes that he was exposed to Descartes’s mechanistic philosophy and to important discoveries in brain anatomy, physiology, and neurology—­all of which transpire in his written work. Hofer prepared his thesis on nostalgia under Harder’s guidance and defended it on June 22, 1688, in the manner of a “disputation” (disputatio), or a formalized debate with his professors (Harder, Zwinger, and the chairs of theoretical and practical medicine). This was only a preliminary requirement, submitted in preparation for the final examination and inaugural thesis, the disputatio medica inauguralis, which Hofer filed the following April on the somewhat less esoteric topic of uterine dropsy (De hydrope uteri). As is often the case with early modern medical dissertations, it is difficult to establish beyond all doubt that the text actually is Hofer’s work. Twenty-­first-­ century notions of authorship do not apply to a time when it was customary for professors and students to work collaboratively and share the honors. Typically, the former would write the text, whereas the latter would present and defend its claims in a public disputation. (This was especially useful for testing daring new ideas.)6 While it is, therefore, possible that Harder authored parts of the thesis, it does seem that Hofer was the primary authorial voice as he is clearly identified as “author” and not just as “respondent.” Moreover, he explicitly chose to present his research as a dissertatio—­then a relatively new term conveying research based on hypotheses and empirical observations—­rather than a more conventional disputatio (a codified recital of canonical knowledge).7 Whatever their exact contribution to the text itself, it is clear that Harder and Zwinger shaped Hofer’s medical training and helped him launch his career as a doctor through their connections. Harder made sure that his student’s\n\nNostalgia in 1688 21\n\nthesis was published by a local printing press, Jacob Bertsch (an unusual accolade for a preliminary work).8 The text was subsequently reissued in revised form in a collection of notable dissertations that Zwinger edited in 1710. In fact, multiple editions would continue to be reprinted periodically, long after Hofer had moved back to Mulhouse and bracketed his medical vocation for a highly successful career in municipal politics. Intriguingly, several of these circulated under modified titles and were more or less explicitly attributed to Harder. As we will see in the next chapter, the vicissitudes of this “uncertain disease” (as nostalgia would come to be described) may be attributed at least in part to the editorial innuendo that clouded the disease’s paternity for much of the eigh­ teenth century and beyond.\n\nH e i m w e h t o N o s ta l g i a Authorial conundrums aside, Hofer’s De Nostalgia is, in and of itself, a puzzling text that defies easy categorizations.9 At first sight, it appears to be a rather conventional example of the research produced by seventeenth-­century European medical faculties. Its sixteen octavo pages of Latin prose are standard for the time, and its style is that of someone trained in the classical rhetorical and philosophical traditions. It bears formal similarities with countless other medical disputationes, including an elaborate dedication to the presiding professors and an annex (corollaria) of laudatory remarks and poems on the student by acquaintances. Its content is, likewise, straightforward enough: after providing a rationale for his choice of topic (Thesis I), Hofer defines his object of study by naming the condition (§II) and outlining its basic pathogenesis (§III). He subsequently presents two cases studies (§IV) and details the clinical picture with a discussion of predisposing factors (§V), the seat of the disease (§VI), its etiology—­both internal (§VII) and external causes (§VIII)—­and symptomatology (§IX). He concludes by revisiting the condition’s pathophysiology (§X), its prognosis (§XI), and therapeutic recommendations (§XII). Still, identifying a new disease is no ordinary feat, and it would be unfair to dismiss Hofer’s dissertation as wholly unoriginal. In more ways than one, he epitomized what Roger French has called the “learned and rational doctor”—­ namely, the university-­trained physician, mindful of tradition but increasingly versatile and at ease in the rapidly changing world of seventeenth-­century medicine.10 Hofer certainly was no iconoclast, but he showed a keen interest in the pioneering experimental work of his time and was savvy enough to couch his findings in tentative terms. He explained his original topic choice as a matter of curiosity about mysterious stories of youngsters who succumbed to ill-­defined\n\n22 Chapter One\n\n“fevers” and “consumption” far from home. The Swiss, Hofer noted, already knew the disorder by the vernacular term “das Heim-­weh,” literally “home-­ sickness.” The French also spoke of “la maladie du pays” to describe the “sorrow caused by the lost charm of the native land” among Swiss expatriates (§I). Neither of these terms, however, was scientific enough to properly define a disease (morbo). Hofer hesitated over the all-­important task of naming this new clinical entity, at one point considering other neologisms such as “nosomania” (literally “return-­madness”) and the more descriptive “philopatridomania” (“madness caused by yearning for the homeland”). His preference, though, lay with a third coinage, less precise but still sufficiently savant and decidedly more pleasing to the ear: “ΝΟΣΤΑΛΓΙΑ,” or “nostalgia,” from the Greek roots νόστος, or nostos (homecoming), and άλγος, or algos (pain or longing). Nostalgia, Hofer boldly asserted, would stand for the deep “sadness [tristem animum] arising from the burning desire to return to the homeland” (§II–­III). A counterfactual history could fruitfully speculate on what the term’s trajectory—­and, perhaps, modernity’s course itself—­might have been had Hofer, or his professors, finally opted for a more unwieldy term. Be that as it may, the choice of “nostalgia” was crucial not only because more euphonic, but because it distinguished the condition from conventional forms of madness. For Hofer, homesickness did not affect one’s reason or intellect as a whole, and it was not a particular kind of “mania” or a “frenzy.” Although it clearly entailed psychological suffering and sometimes even showed signs of “melancholic delirium” (delirii melancholici) (§III), as far as he could tell, it only targeted discrete mental faculties. But whereas a twenty-­first-­century reader might expect him to have singled out a faulty memory as the source of the ill, Hofer had another mental operation in mind—­one that seemed most consonant with nostalgia’s ostensibly spatial, rather than temporal, coordinates. As he repeatedly made clear to his readers, nostalgia had to be understood first and foremost as the “symptom of a disordered imagination” (symptoma imaginationis laesae) (§III). Hofer described the pathogenic process at the heart of the condition in the typical language of late seventeenth-­century physiology. He posited that what troubled the imagination was the “constant movement of the animal spirits along the white tubules of the striate bodies and oval center of the brain” (§XI), where “residual impressions of the homeland [ patriae] adhere” (§VII). Sensory stimulation induced this vibration, soliciting the imaginative faculties to converge on mental images [ phantasmata] impressed in memory, and “excite in the soul [anima] a recurring and exclusive idea of returning to the homeland” (§III). Hofer viewed these vibrating spirits in corpuscular terms, as a quantifiable flow of fine particles that surged along nervous conduits setting\n\nNostalgia in 1688 23\n\nin motion a chain reaction with both psychic and somatic consequences. The mind’s fixation on the idea of home blocked the actual flow of animal spirits, preventing them from sustaining the “vibration of the fibrils in the common sensorium [sensorio communi]” necessary to the proper functioning (multitasking) of the brain. Because of this hoarding, the spirits also could not flow in sufficient quantities “along the invisible channels that connect the various parts of the body,” thus affecting all other natural faculties. Hofer singled out loss of appetite and poor digestion due to diluted gastric juices, leading to an overly acidic chyle that would, in turn, yield viscous serum and thick lymph when mixed with blood. The end result was an overconsumption of animal spirits in the brain and lackluster regeneration of the same spirits in the blood, thus further slowing down all bodily and mental functions. In an advanced case, blood would begin to thicken and clot, hindering circulation and affecting the heart. At this stage the nostalgic patient might begin to develop aggravating somatic conditions, including bouts of anxiety, fever, and obstruction of the glands (§X). Hofer’s full symptomatology reads like a laundry list of morbid signs: “constant sadness [tristia continua], obsessive thinking about the homeland, insomnia and agitated sleep, general weakness, loss of appetite, heart palpitations, respiratory difficulties, [ . . . ] continuous and intermittent fevers” (§IX). His prognosis left little room for hope: if nostalgia was allowed to fester untreated, the “consumption of the spirits” and inexorable weakening of the body would hasten death by exhaustion (§XI). Hofer embedded this detailed pathophysiological explanation within a more tentative examination of nostalgia’s broader epidemiology based on personal and related observations in his entourage. He started by distinguishing between preexisting chronic and acute conditions that might predispose to nostalgia on the one hand, and the difficulties encountered when trying to adapt to a change in lifestyle or habits following expatriation on the other. The latter clearly interested him most, and he singled out unfamiliar customs and foods, a marked change in atmosphere, and insults professed in a foreign language as possible triggers. A “homebound education” with little contact with the outside world, he claimed, was certain to produce socially inept adolescents incapable of “adapting to foreign ways of life” or, for that matter, of “forgetting their moth­ er’s milk.” Hofer seems to have been uncomfortable with circulating rumors that Heimweh was a particularly Swiss malady—­a topos emphasized at the end of his thesis, in a few short verses by the French Huguenot Charles Ancillon, who congratulated the author on having shown that a Swiss could cure what he described as a “national malady.” Despite only having Swiss examples at hand to rely upon, Hofer invoked the findings of other doctors across Europe\n\n24 Chapter One\n\nto recuse the idea that this was a Schweizerkrankheit (and one that targeted the Bernese in particular). Why they seemed especially prone Hofer wasn’t quite sure, although he recognized that the predisposing factors seemed to apply particularly well to isolated alpine communities. Most interestingly, he suggested looking further into the effects of missing out on hearty mountain breakfasts and cow milk when abroad, or of having to relinquish the cherished personal liberties the Swiss enjoyed in their home cantons (§V and VII). Although the prognostic outlook was bleak, Hofer insisted that nostalgia was not fatal and could be treated successfully. He recommended a two-­pronged, pharmaceutical and psychotherapeutic, approach to both “mitigate the symptoms” and “correct the disordered imagination.” Among the former, Hofer recommended administering purgatives (mercury or wine), emetics, and bleeding the patient’s brachial vein at the very first symptoms. In a more advanced case, he suggested balsams and emulsions to calm the patient, as well as pharmaceutical potions to strengthen the heart, lower the fever, and fluidify the blood. Medicinal remedies ( phisik) were not sufficient, though, and Hofer emphasized the need to both reassure the patient and distract him from the obsessive idea of home. He must be led to believe that he would be able to return there as soon as his health recovered. Meanwhile, he should be entertained and provided with company so as to forget the cause of his illness. Ultimately, though, Hofer was under no illusion as to the efficacy of these measures. Should they fail at dislodging the obsessive idea at the heart of the condition, the physician had no choice but to prescribe the one and only trusted remedy against homesickness: to “send [the patient] home at once, no matter how sick or frail, whether by carriage, stretcher, or whatever means available” (§XII).\n\nB e t w e e n H i p p o c r at e s a n d D e s ca rt e s To modern readers Hofer’s original clinical sketch of nostalgia is striking in at least three respects: its adamant portrayal of a morbid and potentially fatal disease; the condition’s spatial form of manifestation and correlation with the imaginative faculties of the brain; and its elaborate psychophysiological pathology. Neither of these can be easily reconciled with our contemporary understandings of nostalgia, but of the three, the latter is perhaps the one that comes across as most baroque. To his contemporaries, on the other hand, it might well have seemed the least questionable. The late seventeenth century was a time of waxing and waning medical philosophies during which physicians made an art of epistemological bricolage. Like his peers, Hofer poured old wine into new bottles in an attempt to replace fading humoral precepts\n\nNostalgia in 1688 25\n\nwith an equally comprehensive system of pathology. His eclectic medical outlook is worth parsing out as it reveals both the holistic nature of his approach to health and uncovers tensions that would become increasingly irresolvable in the dualistic world of post-­Cartesian medicine, leading others to pursue divergent understandings of the disease. One of the most noticeable features of Hofer’s dissertation is undoubtedly the absence of any explicit reference to humors, biles, and vapors—­in other words, to the categorial arsenal of humoralism and to the pathophysiology that European physicians had relied upon since the early Middle Ages. Instead, Hofer worked squarely within a physiology of spirits and embraced the new mechanistic theories and anatomical discoveries promoted in Harder’s and Zwinger’s classes. He took for granted the circulation of blood, demonstrated decisively in 1628 by the British physician William Harvey (and adopted in Basel by midcentury).11 His holistic, corpuscular psychophysiology and detailed descriptions of animal spirits dilating brain pores and altering moods suggests a familiarity with the Cartesian corpus, in particular the Treatise of Man (published posthumously in 1662). As Starobinski first noted, Descartes’s influence may well have been leavened through the writings of the British physician Thomas Willis, whose pioneering research in brain anatomy and the neurochemical basis of mental disorders (first published in the 1660s and 1670s), Hofer seems to echo in several instances.12 Undoubtedly, Hofer was fascinated by the medical advances of his century and saw his own research as a modest contribution to a new scientific era. One could, in fact, read into his dissertatio a physiology of fibers and the budding age of medical and literary sensibility that, per cultural historian George S. Rousseau, extends all the way back to the impact of Willis’s neurological discoveries.13 We should not overemphasize, though, the “modernity” of Hofer’s training or his medical outlook. Medieval scholasticism did not disappear overnight, and the dual intellectual tradition of Aristotelianism and Galenism continued to cast its shadow over seventeenth-­century physicians.14 Hofer’s symptomatological description of nostalgia draws heavily from preexisting literature on mental illness, including medieval acedia and early modern melancholy. His therapeutic recommendations echo Galenic precepts, not least the time-­tested doctrine of contraries—­“contraria contrariis contrantur” (contrar­ ies are cured by contraries)—­exemplified perhaps most emphatically by the summation to repatriate the homesick patient.15 Indeed, Hofer’s use of terminology reveals how a new understanding of “psychology” gradually emerged in the late 1600s from within the bedrock of late scholastic natural philosophy and the “scientia de anima” that continued to dominate early modern\n\n26 Chapter One\n\nEuropean universities (but that was increasingly placed under scrutiny in German Protestant circles in particular).16 At first sight, his tripartite map of the soul—­divided between the faculties of reason, memory, and the imagination (to which a fourth element, the common sensorium, was typically associated)—­ has a distinctly Aristotelian flavor. However, Hofer uses the “soul” (anima) interchangeably with “mind” (mens), indicating that he no longer views it to be the living principle of all forms of life (including animal and vegetative), but rather a disembodied, immaterial concept unique to humans—­a “soul-­mind” rather than a “soul-­form,” in the words of Fernando Vidal.17 The same can be said of his interest for the “common sensorium” (sensorio communi), which he uses in the manner of a pineal gland, connecting otherwise distinct body and soul, and which he attempts to locate within the striate bodies of the basal ganglia (a task that one medical historian has aptly called the seventeenth century’s “quest for the Grail of cerebral physiology”18). There are further Cartesian overtones to Hofer’s hydraulic understanding of the ancient medical doctrine of “spirits” ( pneuma) and “mental images” ( phantasmata), and to his theory of the passions. Ultimately, Hofer’s basic approach to disease appears to retain the pragmatic and psychosomatic hallmarks of Hippocratic medical practice precisely by embedding these within new psychological and physiological theories. These posited at once a fundamental distinction and a necessary interaction between body and soul—­the unity of soma and psyche that Descartes stressed in his last work published during his lifetime, The Passions of the Soul (1649).19 It may come as no surprise, therefore, that his holistic clinical description did not survive untouched in the increasingly dualistic, post-­Cartesian world of the eighteenth century. To strict materialists, the psychological side of Hofer’s clinical picture rang rather fanciful; instead, they championed a wholly mechanistic approach, grounded in anatomical, physiological, and especially climatic explanations. Hofer’s almost casual observation that a change in air could cause nostalgia—­by altering the “disposition of the blood and the spirits” as he suggested (§VII)—­provided them with a simple but empirically sound basis upon which to establish what they saw as a rigorous understanding of the condition. Conveniently for some, it also happened to elucidate why the Swiss seemed particularly vulnerable, but out of no constitutional weakness or fault of their own. In the early 1700s the notion that one could explain nostalgia with hydraulics and atmospheric pressure differentials made many devotees among advocates of a materialist “homme machine.” Partly in reaction to this, a rival, vitalist understanding of the disease that emphasized its emotional causes and psychological effects crystallized in the second half of the century. To followers\n\nNostalgia in 1688 27\n\nof sensationalist psychology, the nostalgic sufferer would instead come to epitomize that most recognizable ideal type of the High Enlightenment: “l’homme sensible.”20\n\nSymptoms of Disorder But where does this leave us as to the origins of nostalgia? From a strictly medical perspective, they are difficult to identify amid the mosaic of overlapping influences one finds in Hofer’s study. Paradoxically, what this “internalist” approach ultimately reveals is that there was no groundbreaking anatomical or physiological breakthrough, no clearly identifiable clinical or epidemiological discovery that might warrant such a new nosological category. The momentous transformations in medical knowledge of the seventeenth century certainly inflected Hofer’s clinical description and determined the shape(s) that nostalgia would subsequently take. But they do not by themselves explain its “coming into being” as an object of scientific interest. To answer the question “why nostalgia in 1688?” we must look beyond medical texts and anatomical theaters to consider what might have been the wider cultural resonance and social significance of those curious stories about young men succumbing to bouts of Heimweh that Hofer heard in Mulhouse and Basel in the 1680s. Hofer’s justification for his choice of topic was largely circumstantial: having heard the stories he simply saw an opportunity to write something original. This may well have been the case, and we can certainly speculate on the extent to which he too felt a touch homesick as a student in Basel (a reaction that was probably quite common among medical students at the time given the tradition of embarking upon a peregrinatio medica around the best European universities at the end of their studies).21 It is even quite possible that he observed and treated one of the case histories he relates in his dissertation (about a young peasant girl hospitalized and diagnosed with nostalgia in Basel). But this tells us little as to why these instances suddenly became worthy of medical attention. We may find clues to this problem in Hofer’s decision to model his description of nostalgia on seventeenth-­century medical studies of melancholia. Though often still couched in Galenic terms, these increasingly tended to explain melancholic states in terms of a faulty imagination and unruly “passions” that mediated, among other things, anxieties about social change and political unrest. From a symptomatological point of view, there was little to distinguish nostalgia from melancholia, and although Hofer insisted the former was not a form of madness, he readily conceded that a melancholic temperament (si\n\n28 Chapter One\n\nnaturâ ad melancholiam inclinent) and prolonged sadness (tristia continua) often revealed a brooding case of homesickness (§IX passim). Therapeutic recommendations were also virtually identical, with the significant exception that travel had long been encouraged to distract melancholics but presumably would not do for nostalgics. We can only guess at the sources of Hofer’s apprenticeship in the long-­standing tradition of medical thought on melancholia. He had undoubtedly read Felix Platter (who helped put Basel on the medical map in the late sixteenth century) and most likely was familiar with Robert Burton’s seminal The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) as well as Thomas Willis’s Two Discourses Concerning the Soul of Brutes (1672).22 Central to these texts was the notion of the “powers of the imagination” first systematized by Thomas Fienus’s De viribus imaginationis (1608), which afforded feelings and emotions—­or what were then referred to as those “passions” ( passiones), “movements” (motus), “affections” (affectiones), and “perturbations” ( perturbationes) of the soul that made up the sixth class of “things non-­natural”—­a mediating role between mind and body.23 As is evident in Willis’s writings, by the 1670s, the pathology of spirits had firmly integrated the imagination and the passions within the etiology of mental disorders such as melancholy. Hofer cited none of these landmark texts—­his only reference was to a relatively obscure physician from Liège, Henrich von Heers, known primarily for having researched the therapeutic virtues of the thermal waters at Spa—­but he clearly was familiar with the medical conversation they had initiated. He placed a disordered imagination at the very heart of nostalgia and readily identified a “perturbatum animum” (§II), a troubled soul, in its victims. When the imagination was corrupted by an overflow of mental images, it excited the appetitive faculties, producing a “burning desire” (§II) that tormented those who “cannot help longing for the homeland” (§VII). The victim eventually developed what psychiatrists would later describe as an “idée fixe,” namely, the obsessive and all-­consuming idea that fed neuroses such as melancholia and that Hofer identified in a patient’s hysterical cries: “Ich will Heim! Ich will Heim! ” (§IV). Hofer explicitly invoked the “powers of the imagination” (imaginationis viribus) to explain how such cravings and ideas could exert action on the body (§X). Paraphrasing the scholastic axiom “Fortis imaginatio generat casum” (A strong imagination begets the event), he located the seat of nostalgia in the striatum, home of the common sensorium (according to Willis) and therefore the very site where “the imagination produces action” (ubi imaginativae animae facultati in actûs deducendae occasion datur) (§VI). He further illustrated these effects by pointing to the remarkable curative powers that contemporaries also ascribed to the imagination and the passions (a staple\n\nNostalgia in 1688 29\n\nfeature of the medical doctrine of contraries). The goal of the treatment, Hofer maintained, was to alleviate the urge by “satisfying” it (§XI). In two of the three cases he related, the patients were cured not by actually returning home but on their way there, or even at the mere thought of being allowed to return there! This seemingly happened to a “sad and melancholic” Swiss domestic servant in Paris, who was able to “cast the fantasy out of his mind within a few days” ( phantasma hoc intra aliquot dies animo excussit) simply by being informed of his release from the house’s service. According to Hofer, he was “moved with joy” (gaudio multùm mutatus) by the news and scarcely needed to pack his suitcase (§XII). Medical concern about melancholy, the imagination, and emotions was nothing new in the early modern era. As one historian puts it, the latter constitutes no less than the “longest standing tradition of mind-­body (that is psychosomatic) speculation in Western medicine.”24 Nor, for that matter, was it exclusively medical in nature. Still, it is possible to speak of a “golden age” for each of these three objects at roughly the same time around the first half of the seventeenth century.25 As Angus Gowland has shown, when Burton diagnosed a frightful epidemic of melancholy from his Oxford study, he did so not because of an epidemiological revolution, but because of the reverberations of the Reformation.26 Within a context of heightened inner spirituality and guilt, the late humanist preoccupation with the passions of the soul projected onto the individual’s psychic well-­being rampant fears about a breakdown in social harmony as witnessed across Europe since the outbreak of the wars of religion. This widespread sense of anxiety thrived on popular beliefs in witchcraft, demonic possession, monstrous progeny, and other examples of imagination’s powers popularized by occult thinkers and humanists from Marsilio Ficino and Giordano Bruno to Michel de Montaigne.27 Published two years apart, in the wake of the French parliamentary Fronde and the English Civil War respectively, Descartes’s Passions of the Soul (1649) and Hobbes’s Leviathan (1651) may, in this sense, be seen as inner and outer reflections of a same apprehension that gripped European societies throughout the seventeenth century: how to manage unruly passions and tame unbridled imaginations in both individuals and the masses.28\n\nPsychologies of Unease It is possible to elucidate the genesis of nostalgia similarly as the product of an era of instability known to historians as the “General Crisis” of the seventeenth century. Although its labeling as a “crisis” is disputed, few deny that a\n\n30 Chapter One\n\nprolonged period of economic stagnation, war, epidemics, and population decline affected much of the European continent from the late 1500s to the early 1700s.29 Economic historians have shown how this period produced structural transformations in what were still largely agrarian societies, generalizing a monetized market economy favorable to both rural “industrious” (or protoindustrial) activity and to significant urban migration to fast-­growing capital and port cities in northwestern Europe, while also sowing the seeds of a “Great Divergence” between Asia and Europe through the latter’s turn to a predatory, land-­grabbing, and exploitative “war capitalism” in colonial outposts.30 Similarly, intellectual historians have come to view the turn of the seventeenth century as a moment of “crisis [in] the European mind,” an age of ferment that gave birth to the Enlightenment in its early and ostensibly “radical” phase.31 Rhinelanders were no strangers to the political, religious, and economic convulsions of the era, and Hofer must have been particularly aware of his hometown’s precarious situation in the 1680s as an autonomous, Protestant enclave along the porous border between Habsburg and Bourbon spheres of influence. Situated at the southern tip of the Vosges, the town of Mulhouse occupied a strategic position in the fertile agricultural plains of the Sundgau and Alsace, within easy reach of the Rhine. Despite its modest size—­barely 3,300 inhabitants in 1699 according to the first available census—­it had been an autonomous republic run by an oligarchy of burghers and trade corporations since the Middle Ages. It owed its independence to its close ties with nearby Basel and the alliance it struck in 1515 with the Swiss Confederation. (By virtue of this agreement, Mulhouse also found itself in an uneasy pact with the kingdom of France, after the Swiss cantons signed a treaty of perpetual peace with François I following their defeat at the Battle of Marignano.) These diplomatic efforts threatened to be undone, though, at the onset of the Reformation, when Mulhouse adhered to Ulrich Zwingli’s Protestant league, provoking the ire of Swiss Catholic cantons and of the Holy Roman Empire, and placing the town in a difficult position between warring Catholics and Huguenots in nearby France. (The Prince de Condé successfully recruited men there after taking refuge in Basel in 1575.) Throughout the Thirty Years War (1618–­48) a garrison of several hundred infantrymen from Bern and Zurich remained stationed in the city, eying off marauding bands of imperial, Spanish, Swedish, and French troops. Miraculously, Mulhouse was spared the destruction visited upon neighboring areas and that left Alsace a smoldering land, amputated of half its population when it was absorbed into the kingdom of France at the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648.32\n\nNostalgia in 1688 31\n\nOf course, Hofer did not directly experience the Thirty Years War, and he would have been too young to remember the renewed violence of the Franco-­ Dutch War of 1672–­78. Nevertheless, he would undoubtedly have learned how a brash Louis XIV used the latter conflict as an excuse to occupy nearby Franche-­Comté and submit recalcitrant Alsatian towns, razing their walls and billeting French troops throughout. Most embarrassingly for the Swiss and their allies, Louis showed no hesitancy in mobilizing 25,000 Swiss hired soldiers—­including a company of two hundred militiamen from Mulhouse—­to fight against fellow Protestant Dutch forces, in spite of treaty terms forbidding such interfaith combat.33 Mulhouse was as dependent as ever on Swiss protection, and by 1681 Hofer would have been old enough to understand the significance, for his hometown, of Louis’s decision to besiege the independent imperial city of Strasbourg—­also an ally of Swiss cantons—­with 30,000 men, forcing it to surrender, recognize Bourbon authority, and return its cathedral to Catholic Mass. But the Sun King’s muscular “politique des réunions” was not all: by the time his famed military engineer Vauban had laid siege to the city of Luxembourg as well, a steady stream of Huguenots fleeing religious persecution in France had started arriving in Mulhouse, often en route to larger Protestant communities in Swiss and German towns. They spread frightful stories of dragonnades, the horror of which would not have been lost on the Hofers, who offered shelter to refugees within the city and negotiated their safe passage to Basel with French authorities.34 In the mid-­1680s, Mulhouse’s inhabitants must have kept a watchful eye over their outdated medieval walls, wondering what other ominous portents might appear on the horizon. Seventeen miles farther south, residents of Basel cannot have been any more reassured at the sight of Vauban overseeing the construction of the fortress of Huningue, an imposing military structure that spanned across the Rhine less than two miles downstream, ostensibly for “defensive” purposes. In his lonely student quarters, Johannes Hofer no doubt pondered at what an unstable time he lived in. His decision to become a doctor rather than a pastor may well have had something to do with a sense of urgency about worldly affairs. Spiritual matters, though, were never too far away: by the time he had settled into the routine life of a medical student in the autumn of 1685, word would have reached him of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. As the streams of Protestant refugees swelled, driving up to 200,000 Huguenots out of France, fears of Catholic conspiracies in Britain and elsewhere on the continent reached fever pitch. Soon gunfire would echo once again as a coalition of European powers decided to take on Louis XIV once more in the\n\n32 Chapter One\n\nF i g u r e 1 . 3 . Matthäus Merian, map of Mulhouse in 1642. Courtesy of the Bibliothèque Municipale de Mulhouse.\n\nWar of the League of Augsburg (1688–­97). By the time he was finalizing his dissertation on nostalgia in the spring of 1688, Hofer could probably see from his window companies of Swiss soldiers marching off to defend Mulhouse yet again. Like Descartes in the wake of Fronde, and a year before John Locke felt similarly about the Glorious Revolution, we may conjecture that Hofer too internalized the instability of his time as a “psychology of uneasiness.”35\n\nMotion Sickness But why nostalgia? Why take a gamble at coining a new disease when he could have just as easily written yet another study on melancholia or other existing emotional disorders such as lovesickness (as his hesitation on naming the condition suggests)? After all, there was little to distinguish these conditions in terms of symptomatology or pathophysiology. We may find clues to answer these questions in the three medical cases and other examples of nostalgia that Hofer discusses in his thesis. As in the case of the Swiss domestic servant in Paris, miraculous cures highlighting the healing “powers of the imagination” also feature in Hofer’s other two case histories. The first one, which he obtained from a nonspecified “trustworthy source,” relates of a young male student from an affluent Bernese family—­probably a fellow medical student—­who developed a severe fever and bouts of anxiety while living in Basel. Bleedings brought little comfort, prompting his physician to diagnose a case of nostalgia and order immediate\n\nNostalgia in 1688 33\n\nrepatriation on a stretcher. At hearing the news, the patient started feeling better, and he arrived in Bern perfectly restored to good health. In the final case history, which Hofer may well have observed firsthand, a young peasant girl who had been hospitalized unconscious in Basel fell “prey to nostalgia” upon coming to her senses and realizing that she was surrounded by “quarrelsome old ladies” (presumably elderly patients whom the young girl could not understand). Her parents were summoned to take her home, and, despite her desperate condition, the young girl recovered within a few days without needing any further medication. Hofer claims he could have added to these three cases, but only makes a passing allusion to the many more examples one might get from conversations with “French and Swiss army captains” (§IV). Apart from involving Swiss people, it is not immediately obvious what ties these cases together. Identity categories such as age, gender, or class don’t help much as the patients seem to come from all walks of life. What they actually share is precisely this fact that they have “come” (traveled) from somewhere and that their occupation entails geographical mobility. As a condition premised on longing for home—­Heim-­we, home-­sickness—­nostalgia presupposed physical displacement and commanded prompt repatriation (or at least a promise thereof). It was, as Kevis Goodman has recently shown about eighteenth-­century sources, both a disease of mobility and a motion sickness within the body: stray too far from home, and the movement of the spirits would become irregular, eventually grinding to a perilous halt; turn around to make the journey back, and the physiological “machine” would start pumping life back into the body’s organs again.36 In a sense, the very creation of the diagnosis marks a partial rupture in the history of the so-­called apodemic arts, or the long standing humanist tradition that promoted travel as essential to both a well-­rounded education and good health, and that would continue to spur young adepts of the “Grand Tour” in the eighteenth century.37 Until then, and despite the odd warning against too much dreamy wandering, medieval and early modern doctors had by and large recommended purposeful voyages as a remedy to acedia, spleen, and all manner of melancholic temperaments.38 Nostalgia, on the other hand, called into question the wisdom of traveling far from familiar environs. Moreover, unlike melancholia, it did not seem to target idle scholars and men of letters whose voyaging was restricted to mental daydreaming; instead, it affected peasants, domestic servants, students, and soldiers—­in other words, a sampling of society’s laboring and increasingly mobile lot. Of course, population movement was nothing new in the late 1600s: a generation of scholars has successfully debunked the image of a sedentary and autarkic population, shedding light on the widespread mobility of preindustrial\n\n34 Chapter One\n\nEurope, particularly along vibrant commercial arteries such as the Rhineland corridor. The circulation of people, goods, and ideas was an integral feature of rural and protoindustrial societies, central to land ownership, work, and trade, and also family life cycles and forms of interpersonal sociability. Whether merchants, peddlers, apprentices, brides, students, or soldiers, early modern Europeans were frequently on the move, albeit for the most part within limited radii and circular (or seasonal) flows.39 By the late seventeenth century, though, these patterns of mobility had begun to change as the development of a market economy promoted new forms of wage labor and facilitated the northwestern drift of Europe’s economic heartland to the Atlantic seaboard. Malthusian checks and prolonged agricultural depression in the wake of the Thirty Years War drove landlocked Europeans to seek new opportunities farther afield, feeding the growth of magnet cities such as Amsterdam, Paris, and London.40 Hofer’s case histories speak to these new networks of rural-­urban migration, and we may speculate that the homesick peasant girl was in Basel to seek employment (probably as a servant in a house) or that the domestique in Paris may have recently seen his status drop from integral member of the “maison”—­comparable to an apprentice journeyman within a corporation “family”—­to mere employee in a foreign environment.41 This shift was also evident at the level of representations of mobility: economic arguments in favor of a mobile workforce clashed with moral cautioning against the perceived corrupting effects of uprooting, stigmatizing poverty and vagabondage, as well as soldiers on the march and deserters hiding in the bush, as the visible hazards of occupational mobility. Soon, passports, highway patrols, and recruitment agents would become the new arbiters of a so-­called great confinement.42 The conditions of possibility for nostalgia begin to appear more clearly from within this context of heightened anxiety about mobility—­about its growing scope, dislocations, and policing. In the second half of the seventeenth century, Mulhouse became fully integrated within a slowly recovering regional economy, loosening its rigid corporate regulations to become an important trade point in the upper Rhineland.43 In his youth, Hofer undoubtedly saw many people on the move: merchants, peddlers, migrant workers, and students, ferrying back and forth between Mulhouse and Basel. He must also have witnessed many more on the run: soldiers marching to battle and deserters, vagrants, or refugees scurrying along the roadsides. By emphasizing the nostalgic’s loss of bearings and difficulty to adapt to foreign ways—­exemplified in an inability to understand foreigners or cope without traditional breakfast and milk (whether of dairy or maternal origin)—­Hofer suggested that increasingly far-­flung and long-­term migration flows were straining the networks of\n\nNostalgia in 1688 35\n\nkinship and solidarity within which much of local and circular mobility had typically occurred up to that point. His allusion to the individual liberties that the Swiss forfeited when leaving their home cantons further underscored the element of coercion often involved in such travels—­whether in an economic impetus to depart, a legal impediment to return, religious persecutions, or seemingly endless warring that caused some to flee, others to march at the time.\n\nThe Sorrows of War It is, in fact, surprising that Hofer did not dwell on the last of these: the military recruit who perhaps epitomized best early modern mobility and who would soon be universally singled out as the archetypal victim of nostalgia.44 Of course, Hofer did refer readers to French and Swiss army captains for more examples of the disease. He added, almost casually, that the French spoke of Swiss people suffering from “maladie du pays,” at a time when the vast majority of Swissmen in France were mercenaries enlisted in Louis XIV’s armies (up to 25,000 men in 1688). Indeed, the stories of Heimweh that first prompted him to study the phenomenon were most likely also military ones, dating b"
