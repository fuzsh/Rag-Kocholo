The competitions were held from 3 August to 5 August and took place at the military sporting complex in Satory and at Boulogne-Billancourt. According to Olympic historian Bill Mallon, one of these nine shooting events was an event for professionals with prize money and therefore does not meet inclusion criteria for 1900 Olympic Games events.",
