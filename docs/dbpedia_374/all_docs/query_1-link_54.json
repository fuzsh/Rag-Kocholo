Fun Facts • These Olympics were the first in which the Olympic Oath was voiced, the first in which doves were released to symbolize peace, and the first in which the Olympic Flag was flown. • The USA won 41 Gold, 27 Silver, and 27 Bronze medals, the most won by any of the 29 nations attending. Sweden, Great Britain, Finland and Belgium rounded out the five most successful medal-winning nations. • The Games also featured a week of winter sports, with figure skating and ice hockey making their Olympic debut. • At the age of 72, Sweden's 100 meter running deer double-shot event champion Oscar Swahn won in the team event to become the oldest Olympic champion ever. • 23-year-old Paavo Nurmi won the 10,000 m and 8,000 m cross country races, took another gold in team cross country, and a silver in 5,000 m run. His contributions for Finland broke the U.S. dominance record in track and field with 9 medals. • In a unique moment in Olympic history, the 12-foot dinghy event in sailing was held in two different countries. The final two races in the event were held in the Netherlands, as the only two competitors in the event were Dutch. • The games were supposed to be held in Hungary, but because of the war the privilege was taken away • Antwerp is awarded the Games in memory of its innocent victims of World War I\n\n10.
