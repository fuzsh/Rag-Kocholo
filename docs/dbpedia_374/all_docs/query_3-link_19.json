Subscribers have the privilege of attending the Lectures and Public Concerts and of introducing friends in proportion to the amount of their subscriptions. An examination of persons trained independently of the Academy is held twice a year — viz., during the Summer and Christmas vacations — successful candidates at which are elected Licentiates of the Academy, and are thereupon entitled to the use after their names of the initials L.R.A.M. An examination of persons engaged in the Training of Children's Voices is held annually in September and during the Christmas vacation and a certificate is granted to successful candidates.

Sir George Alexander . . The London Opera House facing page THE STAGE YEAR BOOK DRAMA OF THE YEAR. BY E. A. BAUGHAN. N analysis of the dramatic productions of 1911 does not make for optimistic reflections. It has been a barren year. Above all, it has been barren in serious plays. Indeed, it would not be unfair to make the deduction that London no longer cares for serious plays, if we except Shakespearean revivals. Here is a meagre list, for instance, of the plays of serious interest which have been successful during the year. Haddon Chambers' \" Passers-by \" (a comedy in style, but dealing with life seriously in its essence), Hemmerde and Neilson'a \" A Butterfly on the Wheel \" (successful only because of its sensational Divorce Court scene), Edward Knoblauch's \"Kismet\" (mainly a question of pageantry), \"The Marionettes\" (an artificial play, distinguished by its excellent acting and by the re-appearance of Sir John Hare), and, as far as one can foresee at the time of writing, the adaptation of Mr. Robert Hichens' \"Bella Donna.\" Not much comfort is to be deduced from that list by those who admire serious drama. The comparatively successful plays do not enlarge the list ,to any great extent. Mr. Zangwill's \" The War God \" was of considerable interest, and I will deal with- it later in this article, and Mr. Laurence Irving's adaptation of Pierre Wolff and Gaston Leroux's \" Le Lys,\" if artificial and theatrical in many respects, had at any rate a strong human basis, the tyranny of a parent who brings unhappines* and even disaster to his children through his selfishness. Mr. Jerome K. Jerome'? \"The Master of Mr. Chilvers \" was a crude suffragette tract; Mr. H. A. Jones'* \" The Ogre \" was, unfortunately, a failure, arid dealt with a serious aspect of modern life in a frivolous spirit; and Hemmerde and Neilson's \"The Crucible\" was nothing but an ordinary melodrama. ARE SERIOUS PLAYS WANTED? For the moment I leave out of count the revivals of \" Macbeth \" by Sir Her- bert Tree and the Shakespearean Festival at His Majesty's ; the production of \" Romeo and Juliet \" at the New Theatre, in which Miss Neilson-Terry showed considerable promise, and the performances of \" The Merry Wives of Windsor \" by Mr. Oscar Asche's company at the Garrick, as well as the Shakespearean perform- ances at the Coronet Theatre. Shakespeare is, indeed, the only serious dramatist who can be sure of a public, and in his case the stage manager and scenic artist deserve much credit for preserving the dramatist's fame as a theatrical evergreen. In looking through the doings of the year one is compelled to ask : \" Are serious plays wanted?\" Of one thing I think we may be certain: the public is tired of sex-dramas and of the eternal triangle of wife, husband, and the other man. Decorate this triangle how you will ; weave on it the flowers of romance and the intricate patterns of intrigue, and the triangle remains the same. Then the ten- dency play in the hands of dramatists who are not poets is a very dull affair, and reflects life in a warped and distorting mirror. Moreover, there is a deeper reasoo why the ordinary serious play no longer appeals to the public. The whole moral outlook of the public has changed. Except in the far-off wilds of ultimate suburbia human actions are no longer judged according to the rules of old-fashioned conventionalism. The agonies of the young girl who has been deserted by a villain have long since ceased to appeal to us. Most of us secretly agree with John Tanner's rhetorical defence of the supposititious \" fall \" of Violet Robinson. In a sense our morality has developed into a higher state. We do not judge people so much by their actions as by their motives and character. The deserted girl in black and a snowstorm is, of course, an extreme instance, for THE STAGE YEAR BOOK she hatf disappeared from polite melodrama many years ago, but I use her as a symbol of the unreal tragedy which no longer impresses the public. The loss of this engaging figure has placed our dramatists in a quandary, and they have not yet found the solution of it. Until life becomes perfect there always must be the material in it for dramatic clash, and it always must afford the spectacle of the abnormal and inappropriateness which are the inspiration of comedy. In a perfect world there would 'be no warfare and no drama ; there would be no divergence from the normal to hold up to satire and ridicule. The bigger men of to-day are attempting to get away from all questions of sex, which are now seen to be more a proper subject for the physiologist and psychologist than for the dramatist, but the affairs of the world from which drama can be made are difficult to handle if an ordinary theatre public is to be interested. Moreover, we must admit that modern life, with its wonderful scientific aids to existence, is no longer a dull affair in itself, and serious drama is no longer required as a stimulant. More and more we are looking to the theatre as a means of entertainment. One section of the public may care for nothing but heart-easing plays, agreeing with Keats's definition of the function of the poet. Another section may welcome comedies which touch on serious aspects of life with lightness, wit, and nimble intelligence. The ideals of the two classes are the same, however. Drama to both is an entertainment, and this \" entertainment \" includes the sensa- tion of melodrama, whether it be the elaborate crudeness of \" The Hope \" or the realistic picture of torture under cross-examination of \"A Butterfly on the Wheel.\" THE PLAY OF THE FUTURE. Even Shakespeare is not exempt from the modern distaste for mere horror in drama. For instance, his \" Macbeth,\" powerful and moving as it is, was not the most popular of Sir Herbert Tree's Shakespearean revivals; whereas the pageantry and humour of \" Henry VIII.\" made it one of the most obstinate of successes. I do not pretend to take the stand that tragedy in drama is dead, or that henceforth comedy shall smile her bitter smile as queen of the stage, but I am sure that the tragedy of the future must be more to the life — tears shall be mingled with smiles, and instead of the cowardice of despair there shall be the courage of humour. Above all, in these days, there must be fantasy, imagination, and strangeness. What message had Bernaiid Shaw to give the world but this ? He has the fantasy and the strangeness. He touches on serious things with nimble- ness and wit. His \" Fanny's First Play,\" which has run for many nights and is still running, has been one of the triumphs of the season, in spite of the prologue which deals with critics and criticism, subjects to which the public is profoundly indifferent; and Mr. Robert Loraine has found that \" Man and Superman\" has converted the Criterion into a little gold mine. These plays are typical of the farces of the future, which will deal more with intellectual than with physical absurdities. But Bernard Shaw, if he has fantasy and strangeness, has not imagination enough to grasp the strong feelings behind human actions. Those feelings have not changed much in all these centuries of civilisation. We still feel that we could kill, but we refrain ; we can love passionately enough to lose the world for love, but we don't. The feelings have not changed, but our way of looking at them has. The very restraints of civilisation, both spiritual and material, really emphasise the dramatic clash of existence, but this clash demands an expression very different from old-fashioned tragedy, and I mean old-fashioned in a comprehensive sense, so that even Pinero's \" Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith \" would be includdd in the category. THE REIGN OF COMEDY. And so we find that the successes of the year have been more in comedy than in tragedy, and in a form of picturesque romanticism which is difficult to class under either heading. I refer to \"The Miracle\" and the excerpt from \" Sumurun,\" both wordless plays, and to the phenomenal success of \"Kismet,\" to say nothing of the rage for Russian ballets at Covent Garden. Of this new aspect of dramatic taste, and of \" romanticism \" in general, I will deal after con- sidering the successes of ordinary comedy. Picturesque romanticism is a curious aspect of the modern stage which has some significance. As to legitimate comedy, we still await the coming of a new Moliere and a new Congreve. But the ground is being cleared for the arrival of the dramatist who shall show genius for comedy. Year by year OUT comedies are becoming more subtle, and are the medium through MISS LILLAH McCARTHY Under whose management \" Fanny's First Play \" and other pieces were produced at the Little Theatre. With the new year Miss McCarthy transferred her energies to the Kingsway, THE STAGE YEAR BOOK which our life is being most vividly portrayed. Mr. Bernard Shaw himself has captured something of Moliere's spirit, as, indertd, he has been largely influenced by the great Frenchman's methods, but G.B.S. lacks the tolerant kindliness of Moliere. The creator of Roebuck in \"Man and Superman\" could never have evolved M. Jourdain. Nevertheless, Bernarld Shaw has the true comedy spirit in him, and possibly in his last \"period\" his talent will be concentrated entirely on comedy. Sir A. W. Pinero, on the other hand, has lost the sureness of touch which made his early farces so (delightful. \" Preserving Mr. Panmure \" ran for close on three months at the Comedy Theatre, but it cannot be called an artistic success. The drawing of upper-middle-class life of the Philistine type was as brilliant as the picture of the Ridgeley family in \" His House in Order,\" but there was some- thing extremely unpleasant in the character of Mr. Panmure himself. The tone of the comedy was bitter and sinister, and it lacked something of the architectural solidity which generally characterises Pinero's plays. The comedy was as finely acted as it well could be, but it was possible to imagine less emphasis on the unpleasant features of the sensual hypocrite, Mr. Panmure. Pinero's work suffered from lacking a central 3dea for satirical treatment. There are Mr. Pan- mures in the world, but they are rare, and we felt that there was no real need to put one of them in the stocks for the whole evening. A successful comedy must deal with characters that are general, and not with grotesque exceptions. Mr. Alfred Sutro's \" The Perplexed Husband \" was more in the true comedy spirit, for its characters, although rather conventional and theatrical, are to be met any day in our modern world of sham culture and sham ideals. Moreover, the piece contained one finely conceived character — that of Clarence Woodehouse, a philosophic hedonist who becomes entangled in the effects of his own preaching. Then, again, Mr. Besier's \" Lady Patricia,\" although a little thin in its main idea, and to some extent a trifle old-fashioned in its satire of preciosity (so rapidly do fads change), was a real comedy of delicate wit, ingenious intrigue, and clever observation. Our players are best in comedy and least good in romantic tragedy, and in \" Lady Patricia,\" as in \" Preserving Mr. Panmure \" and \" The Per- plexed Husband,\" there was some acting of which our stage may well be proud. Of the success of Mr. Bernard Shaw's \"Fanny's First Play\" I have already written. Although it is not, perhaps, \"Bernard Shaw at his best,\" it is a very amusing entertainment, and is thoroughly well acted by Miss Lilian MacCarthy and her company. Mr. Shaw stands almost alone among the older dramatists in heaving achieved success with a new play during the past year. Mr. H. A. Jones, with \"The Ogre,\" was not as successful as Sir Arthur Pinero with \"Preserving Mr. Panmure.\" ; The Ogre\" fell between two stools. The first act foreshadowed a play on the heartlessness of the modern woman who spends her husband's money without knowing or caring to know how he makes it, or if he can afford to spend so much. I imagine that the play may have been originally intended for America, where this first act would have had a more general meaning than in this country' But Mr. Jones did not carry out the idea. The second and third acts are mere tarce, and of an old-fashioned kind. Mr Louis N. Parker was no more successful with his \"Pomander Walk,'' in spite of the fact that as the peppery old Admiral Mr Cyril Mauds had a good part. \" Pomander Walk \" is like a coarse modern imitation of an eighteenth century colour print. It was meant to give us an amusing glimpse of the days of coaches and lavender-scented linen, but this was mainly done by the stage setting and not by the dialogue or characterisation. lo be successful m this pseudo-antique style the fastidious touch of a Robert Louis •tevenson is required. Mr Parker is a clever playwright, but he is not a Stevenson. In America \" Pomander Walk\" was immensely successful, mainly, I presume, because it dealt with antique life in England. Mr. Somerset Maugham although not one of our older playwrights, must also be classed among those authors who have missed their mark in 1911. Although his \" Loaves and Fishes \"was b a success, I am not among those who consider it his weakest comedy. As L ±r SL*V uk lfc haS m°? \" ^ \" in [i than many of the piecJ from ELSfi ^ ! bee?

Originally%roduced at the ria\\nou e at a trial matinee, it was immediately transferred to the Havmarket and has run right through one of the hottest summers on record\" fnd 7s stilt THE STAGE YEAR BOOK running. That this simple, genial, and amusing satire of Scotch character and life has been so successful at a theatre in the heart of the West End should teach our managers that fresh and original work will always find an audience. \" Bunty Pulls the Strings \" owes very little of its success to its Scotch character, but much to the clever company of Scotch players who have appeared in the piece. But the play, if a trifle crude and scrappy, is clever as a play. There is really no boom in Scotch plays, and Miss Laurence Therval's \" Christina,\" also given a trial matinee by Mr. Cyril Maude at the Playhouse, was not in any way a rival to Mr. Moffat's play. Next to \"Bunty Pulls the Strings,\" \"Fanny's First Play,\" and \" The Perplexed Husband \" comes Mr. Arnold Bennett's \" The Honey- moon,\" a pleasant, clever, and fresh little comedy with which Miss Marie Tempest opened her season at the Royalty Theatre in October. In quite a different style the American farce \"Baby Mine\" has been one of the chief successes of the year, but it may be noted that Miss Mayo's piece is a tendency-farce, and satirises the modern American woman's distaste of motherhood. The satire does not apply Siite so much to this country, but still it does apply sufficiently to give \" Baby ine \" a satirical meaning apart from its clever intrigue. It is a curious fact, and one on which we may pride ourselves, that the most brilliant comedies and farces of the year have been from the pens of British and English-speaking authors. There have also been some comparative failures, of course; for instance, Mr. Keble Howard's \"The Girl Who Could Not Lie,\" Mr. E. Temple Thurston's \"Sally Bishop,\" Mr. Maurice Baring's \"The Green Elephant,\" and Mr. Charles McEvoy's \" All That Matters \"—although the last had a certain freshness of outlook and unconventionality of treatment. In general, however, the most successful comedies and farces have been from British pens. \" The Glad Eye,\" an adaptation from the French by Jose G. Levey, is the one exception. It has been the only piece of foreign origin which has been wonderfully popular. \" Dad,\" \" Decorating (Jlemeriime,\" \" The Great Name,\" \"The Uninvited Guest,\" \"Playing with Fire,\" \"The Concert,\" and \" Is Matrimony a Failure? \" have had varying success, and no doubt most of these plays have answered all the requirements made of them, but none has had the unquestionable triumph of \" Fanny's First Play,\" \" Bunty Pulls the Strings,\" or \" The Perplexed Husband.\" Our dramatists are attempting to open up new roads, whereas the French and Germans are content with the old. An exception must be made of \" Le Manage de Mile. Beulemans,\" a delighttul comedy of Belgian middle-class life, which was played at the Globe for a couple of week? in September by a Belgian company. THE POVERTY OF SERIOUS PLAYS. At the beginning of this article I glanced at the serious plays produced during the year, and if I have dismissed them biiefly it is because comedy has been so much more important, and I think it is likely to be as the years roll on. Indeed, the old-fashioned distinction between tragedy and comedy is gradually ceasing to exist, and drama will become a more faithful reflection of life in being an amalgam of both. Such serious plays as have been successful during the year have been polite melodramas or what may be called comedy-melodramas. Gladys Unger's adaptation of Pierre Wolff's \" The Marionettes \" is an instance of this. It begins with a problem, or, rather, a very interesting situation of serious import, and then tails off into theatrical comedy — a woman, naturally staid, who plays the coquette to attract an indifferent husband (a situation as old as Notre Dame). Mr. A. E. W. Mason's \" The Witness for the Defence \" had a fine first act, well conceived as to atmosphere and based on simple and yet telling motives. It became, as the play went on, merely an unnatural drama of intrigue, leaving the solution of the problem of the first act to an insignificant scene at the end. Mr. Hichens's \"Bella Donna\" is just melodrama, with a splendid part for Mrs. Patrick Campbell. When I use the word \" melodrama \" it is in no sense a reproach, for melodrama is a good, healthy thing, appealing to the average healthy human being's love of the sensational, but it is a sensationalism entirely within the terms of the theatre, and is an end in itself. A serious play of artistic aims would not make that sensationalism an end in itself. \" A Butterfly on the Wheel,\" by Messrs. Hemmerde and Neilson, had a kind of thesis — the brutality, injustice, and inhumanity of cross-examination as it is conducted by the bullying type of counsel; but there was only one scene which carried this out, and one scene does not make a play. In many ways the most interesting serious drama MISS MARIE TEMPEST Who, during the year 1911, went into management at the Royalty, where she produced \" The Honeymoon,\" by Arnold Bennett. THE STAGE YEAR BOOK of the year was Mr. Laurence Irving's adaptation of Pierre Wolff and Garton Leroux s \" Le Lvs \" but this problem of the tyranny of a selfish parent was not expressed in terms which appeal to a British audience. The tyranny exists here as in France, but not in the same way. Mr. William Morpeth's \"Above Suspicion,\" an adaptation of Sardou s \"Ferreol,\" produced at the Haymarket ; Mr. Walter Frith's -Margaret Catch- pole \" a broad-sheet melodrama, at the Duke of York's; and Mr. Boyle Lawrence and' Mr. F. Mouillot's \"Popinjay\" at the New Theatre, had moderate ^ runs. \"A Fool There Was,\" foundeld by Porter Emerson Browne on Kipling 6 Vampire \" was a failure, and deserved to be. The romantic costume drama has not been very successful. Henry Hamilton and Rafael Sabatini's \" Baudelys the Magnificent\" did not repeat at the Globe the success it had already won in the provinces; nor had Leon M. Lion and Malcolm Cherry's \"Mr. Jarvis any lasting vogue at Wyndham's. The public at one time seemed all in favour of these romantic costume plays, but they must be good of their kind. The Scarlet Pimpernel \" has been again revived, arid on the last day of the year \" Sweet Nell of Old Drury \" was mounted again with every sign of prosperity. This craving ior romantic picturesque plays will always exist, but it shows itself in different ways at different times. The popularity of Shakespeare is one of its manifestations, for It is absurd to suppose that the large audiences which flock to His Majesty's are mainly attracted by the dramatic intensity and nobility of Shakespeare's work. Without stage show Shakespeare would not be so popular. Sir Herbert Tree^has a wonderful record for the year in the production of Shakespeare. \" Macbeth \" was his new revival, and very elaborate it was in scenery and magic-effects. At the New Theatre \"Romeo and Juliet\" was mounted for the sake of Miss Neilson-Terry as Juliet. The play was produced with considerable taste, and an attempt was made to realise the violence of the period, with its strong hates and equally strong loves. Miss Terry herself showed considerable advance in her talent, but she has still a great deal to learn if only her public admirers will allow her to learn it. Mr. Oscar Asche and his company gave a revival of \" The Merry Wives of Windsor\" at the Garrick, but its only distinguished feature was that the action of the play was set in the winter. This dild not heighten the merri- ness of the play. If we are not given serious plays of moment on the ordinary stage we expect that our numerous dramatic societies will make good the deficiency, but even in this respect 1911 has been disappointing. The Stage Society has produced nothing to equal John Masefield's \" Pompey the Great\" of the previous year. Prof. G. Lowes Dickenson's \" Business \" proved to be the work of a clever man, who had evidently studied his subject ; but the subject never quite crystallised into drama Among the other plays produced were Mr. George Moore's \" Esther Waters,\" which now seems old-fashioned and crude, and \" The Passing of Talma,\" a trans- lation from the German by Mr. H. A. Hertz. This little play is practically a virtuoso piece for one actor, and it enabled Mr. Henry Ainley to show that he has the makings of a great emotional actor. The Oncomers and the Play Actors have produced nothing of much note, with the exception of Isabel Hearne's \" Queen Herzeleid.\" The Pioneers iia.J the courage to produce Mr. Laurence Housman's \"Pains and Penalties,\" the Queen Caroline drama which had been banned by the Censor. It is a scrappy play, and not particularly impressive in characterisation or dialogue, and I must say that while the Censor is a servant of the Lord Cham- berlain there was every reason for refusing to license a play which holds up a a member of the present dynasty to contempt. Better work has been (done at the Little Theatre and the Court by Miss Lilian McCarthy than by any of the inde- pendent, non-commercial stage societies. Miss McCarthy's record is remarkable. At the Court in January she produced John Masefield's translation of H. Weiss Jennssen's \" The Witch,\" a very powerful and very interesting play, and she revived '^Nan.\" At the Little Theatre she has given us a revival of \" Just to Get Married,\" the \" Anatol \" sequence of dialogues (after three of them had been played at the Palace by Mr. Granville Barker), Ibsen's \" The Master Builder,\" and \"Fanny's First Play,\" besides matinees of Meredith's \"The Sentimentalists,\" Barries \"Twelve Pound Look,\" and Granville Barker's \"Rococo.\" It is to be hoped that Miss McCarthy's tenancy of the Kingsway will yield as good results. *or one of the interesting plays of the year we have to thank Sir Herbert Tree, and not any of the stage societies. Mr. Zangwill's \" The War God \" is interest- ing, whatever else one may say of it. Its fault is in the one-sided drawing of 10 THE STAGE YEAR BOOK Bismarck as a kind of modern war demon. The issues which make for war are but partially sketched in this play, and the character of the chief protagonist is so wavering that Mr. Zangwill himself has had to explain it at considerable length in the Press. The use of blank verse in a modern play is not as new as the author of \"The War God\" seemed to think. At any rate, it is not new in France. But this artistic question received no solution from Mr. Zangwill because his verse was poor in quality. Still, \"The War God\" was interesting, mainly because the spirit of sincerity breathes through it. PLAYS OF MYSTERY AND PICTUBESQUENESS. Although this year has not given us any serious plays of great moment, it has been remarkable for a curious manifestation of a new spirit, to which I have already referred. It is the spirit of fantasy. \"The Golden Land of Fairy Tales \" and \" Where the Rainbow Ends \" owe something, no doubt, to the success of \"Peter Pan\" and \"The Blue Bird.\" That does not belittle their character, however, as manifestations of the new spirit of fantasy and poetry which is making itself felt on our stage. At the Haymarket we had Lord Dunsany's \"The Gods of the Mountain,\" an impressive little allegory ; and at Manchester (if I may look outside London for once) there was John Galsworthy's \" The Little Dream,\" a play of genuine poetic feeling. In addition one must not forget the success of the wordless \" Sumurun\" at the Coliseum and the colossal production of \"The Miracle \" at Olympia. Both these productions appeal to a love of mystery and picturesqueness, and their popularity may be taken as a kind of protest against the grey flippancy of modern comedies and modern life. Dancing hardly comes within the province of my survey, but the success of the Russian ballet at Covent Garden is germane to the contention that the public now desires romance and poetry — in a word, strangeness on the stage. These Russian ballets are as much plays as \" Sumurun \" and \" The Miracle.\" Even on the ordinary stage the suc- cesses of the year have been made by \" Bunty Pulls the Strings,\" \" Lady Patricia,\" \"Fanny's First Play,\" and \"Kismet\" (which is at once a \"Sumurun\" and a drama), and all these plays are fantastic and strange. No doubt the vogue of musical comedy, as of the Shakespearean revivals at His Majesty's, is due to the same need on the part of the public for something out of the commonplace. Sir Herbert Tree has gauged this taste by producing a new and satirical version of Offenbach's \" Orphee aux Enfers.\" Even on the ordinary musical comedy stage there are signs of this new spirit. \" The Mousme,\" following \" The Arcadians,\" is a sign of the times. But it will not do to labour that point too much, for the Gaiety \" Peggy \" was just an ordinary Gaiety piece, and Gladys Unger's new version of \" Die Fledermaus \" has nothing strange about it. On the other hand, \"A Waltz Dream\" (revived in January), \" The Count of Luxembourg,\" produced in May at Daly's, and the continued run throughout the year of \"The Chocolate Soldier\" are evidence that the public is looking to musical comedy for the satisfaction of some of its love of romance and strangeness. (By the way, the year has been noticeable for a number of musical comedy failures — \"Baron Trenck,\" \" Bonita,\" \"The Spring Maid,\" and \" The Love Mills.\") If, therefore, the year has not been remarkable for any serious drama of more than common merit, there have been signs of a change in the spirit of the public which may lead to new and interesting developments, and of one thing a survey of the year's productions has made me very sure: no manager can afford to have fixed jideas of what the public will appreciate. \" Kismet \" was long under the consideration of an eminent actor-manager, who in the end returned the play as unsuitable; \"Bunty Pulls the Strings\" owes its production to Mr. Cyril Maude, who had the courage to give it a trial matinee ; \"Fanny's First Play\" would have been produced nowhere but for the Little Theatre — yet these pieces have been the great successes of the year. The lesson to be deduced from this is simply that there is a public for anything fresh, strange, and fantastic. Who, during the year 1911, has been in management at the Kingsway, where she produced Maxim Gorky's \"The Lower Depths,\" and other plays.

THE one thing that will make memorable the otherwise somewhat discouraging year of 1911 in the domain of Music is the building and opening of the London Opera House in the Kingsway by Mr. Oscar Ham.merstein. It is a stately and palatial building, but its future destiny it is difficult to foretell. One remembers the fine theatre built in 1890 by Mr. D'Oyly Carte in Shaftesbury Avenue and its ultimate fate, and the older of those among us have vivid recollections of the unfinished edifice on the Thames Embankment, which is now New Scotlanid Yard, and the optimistic professions of the late Colonel Mapleson, who was its promoter. There is no doubt, however, that opera in London has been gaining ground within the past decade, and therefore so far as Mr. Hammerstein's venture is con- cerned we must \"wait and see.\" Without question he has begun extremely well. His productions are remarkable for the excellence of the mise en scene, the youth, vitality, and vocal ability of the chorus, and the quality of the leading artists. The new enterprise was formally opened on November 13 with \" Quo Vadis? \" the libretto founded on the well-known novel of that name, with music by Jean Xougues. The .production was more noteworthy for the splendour of its stage setting and the admirable ensemble than for the intrinsic quality of the music, which was mainly of the declamatory order, although there was a melodic quality in the final act which showed that the composer could write in a more tuneful strain when opportunity offered. A quasi-novelty was introduced in Massenet's \" Herodiade,\" which had been subject to considerable revision since it was first in this country at Covent Garden in 1904. Again the .splendour of the stage setting and wonderful stage manage- ment excited the admiration of a crowded house, as did the fine singing of M. Henaud, and of Mesdames Cavalieri and D' Alvarez, the latter a dramatic mezzo soprano of exceptional talent, who was heard for the first time in England. Among other revivals of old-time works was \" William Tell,\" which had not been heard in London for many years. Debutants who have made striking personal successes include Mr. Orville Harrold and the youthful Miss Felicia Lyne, a light coprano with a brilliant voice which time will ripen if she .does not overtax her powers in the present. All things considered, Mr. Hammerstein has started well — even beyond expectations. The Grand season at Covent Garden had once again the honour of a Gala per- formance, and it is needless to say that with the many distinguished strangers in our midst, and the presence of the King and Queen in London for the greater part of the summer, the Covent Garden season lacked nothing in the way of influential support. ^ It offered a pleasing novelty in a one-act opera, \" Susanna's Secret,\" by Signor Wolff; Massenet's \"Thais,\" brought to this country after a lapse of seventeen years since its first production ; and \" La Fanciulla del West,\" but Puccini's work made no profound impression, and is not likely to eclipse in popularity either \" La Boheme \" or \"Madame Butterfly.\" Among the revivals there figured Delibes' \" Lakme,\" which. ha\\d not been seen for twenty years, and Debussy's \" Pelleas et Melisande.\" The remainder of the season was made up of familiar works which were more restricted this year conse- quent on the engagement of the Ruscian Ballet from the State Opera Houses of St. Petersburg and Moscow, which proved one of the chief attractions and mont distinguished features of the season. The success of the troupe was instantaneouc, and their expressive pantomime in the various pieces they produced, and the wonderful grace of the principal dancers excited the admiration of all. Among the principal and best known vocal artists were Mesdames Tetrazzini, Destinn, Edvina, and Kirkby Lunn. Covent Garden was the scene also of a successful autumn season, when there* were some excellent performances of Wagner's \" Ring \" under Herr Franz Schalk's- direction— owing to the retirement of Dr. Richter— and once more the Russian Ballet figured as an attractive feature of the season. 12 THE STAGE YEAR BOOK Considerable interest was aroused by the production of Humperldinck's \" Konigskinder,\" a beautiful work which it may be remembered was produced in an abbreviated form some years ago by Mr. Martin Harvey at the Court Theatre under the title of \" Children of the King.\" Turning our attention to the concert world, I am afraid there was a considerable .amount of heart-breaking disappointments among concert givers. It was thought that, as it was Coronation year, there would be an extraordinary influx of visitors, .and consequently artists made haste to arrange their fixtures, in the hope of being •extensively patronised. But, as we all know, owing to the effusions of the sensa- tional newspapers and the rumoured extravagant demands of hotels and lodging- . house keepers, the visitors were very slow in arriving, and, having witnessed the event of the year, they (quickly took their departure. The great majority of the vocal and instrumental recitals were bu't poorly attended, and loss must .have been considerable where profits only were sanguinely expected. British music, as everyone knows, is the Cinderella of the Arts in the metropolis, .and even the provinces in the past year have been more chary of their benefactions. It is to the provincial Festivals the native composer looks for some outlet of the •creative work of his brain, but Norwich introduced no novelty whatever, and the Festival of the Three Choirs at Worcester only produced three short works — •by Dr. Walford Davies, Dr. Vaughan Williams, and Professor Bantock respec- tively— which can scarcely rank beyond local interest. It is to be feared that the time-honoured Triennial Festival is finding it difficult •to contend with the distribution of musical forces in these days of rapid transit, when first-class London orchestras, under their distinguished heads, make yearly .and profitable tours. It is quite probable that in the near future these Festivals will iprove of little value as media for the exploitation of our composers' new works. The two principal novelties heard in the Metropolis were Sir Edward Elgar's \"Second Symphony\" in E flat and Dr. Walford Davies's New Symphony in G '(Op. 32). The former has for its motto a quotation from one of Shelley's love -jpoems : — \" Rarely, rarely, comest thou, Spirit of Delight.\" .And although the composer offers and suggests no ' programme,\" it is impossible .not to recognise and appreciate the sweet influence of the lines and the beautiful .manner in which he handles his subject. Although Dr. Davies's work is extremely clever and betrays the hand of the capable musician in every bar, it cannot be .said that it is calculated to make any permanent impression on musical amateurs. After some disappointment, owing to the illness of Sir Frederick Cowen — he is :to be congratulated on the tardy but well-earned knighthood — his choral work, \"The Veil,\" was heard at Queen's Hall, with the Festival Chorus which did it .such ample justice when it was first produced at Cardiff, and the eulogiums that had been passed upon it on the occasion of the original performance were fifilv -confirmed by its reception in London. It would be too lengthy and unprofitable a task to follow in detail the proceed- ings of the numerous symphonic and choral societies and associations which go to make the Metropolis so interesting musically. The old ones are continuing •their successful way, and the new ones are following worthily in their wake. It is a matter of interest to make note of the fact of the retirement of Mr. Francesco Berger from the honorary secretaryship of the centenarian Philharmonic Society, which he has worthily held for such a long period, and the appointment of Mr. William Wallace, a thoroughly accomplished musician. The Promenade Concerts ;at Queen's Hall continue their good work in the autumn months. A London Musical Festival was held at Queen's Hall, but its popular support did not equal its artistic success. There was a series of \"Festival of Empire\" •concerts at the Crystal Palace, each programme being representative of the country named for the occasion. Chamber music has been fairly well represented, and several trio and quartet parties have discoursed sweet music, but not, it must be said, to abnormally large -audiences. Among the solo instrumentalists who have established a great reputa- tion is the 'cellist Pablo Casals ; while old favourites such as Mme. Carreno and Fritz Kreisler, Pachmann, Mark Hambourg, Harold Bauer, Backhaus, Kubelik, -and Mischa Elman have easily held their own. Mme. Albani, after having been •consistently before the English public since 1872. gave her farewell concert at the Albert Hall. THE STAGE YEAR BOOK 13 In the lighter domain of music I have to chronicle such light operas as \"Bonita,\" by Mr. Fraser Simpson, and that is the only native work which calls- for mention. Lehar's \"Count of Luxembourg\" was produced at Da'y's. andi Leoncavallo conducted in person a condensed version of \" PagHacci \" at the Hippo- drome. There was a Christmas revival of Offenbach's \" Orphee aux Enfers \" at His Majesty's Theatre. The year's obituary includes Signor Randegger and Herr Gustav Mahler. The Royal Academy of Music moved to a new home in Marylebone Road. SOME INTERESTING AUTOGRAPHS. THE interesting autograph of the late Watts Phillips, the well-known dramatist, which we are able to reproduce in this year's issue of THE STAGE YEAR BOOK, is from the collection of Mr. J. E. Preston Muddock, otherwise known as \"Dick: Donovan,\" in whose possessionit has been for many years. Apart from his literary abilities Watts Phillip bad artistic talent, and the ingenious design by which his name is subscribed in the ink flowing from the capsized ink pot is testimony to bis skill as an. artist. The interest of the drawing is further enhanced by the signatures of Charles- Reade, Dion Boucicault and bis beautiful wife Agnes, whose charming impersonation of the\" Colleen Bawn \" drew all London. Watts Phillips was the author of numerous- plays, amongst them the historical drama of \" The Dead Heart,\" the original production of which took place at the Adelphi in November, 1859. The theatre was then called the New Adelphi, as it bad been rebuilt by Benjamin Webster in the preceding year on the site of the old bouse. The original Theatre was called the Sans Pareil, and was opened on the 27th of November, 1806, but in 1820 it was renamed the Adelphi ; in 1860 the first performance of \" The Colleen Bawn \" took place, and had the unprecedented run (for those times) of more than 360 nights. Mr. Muddock informs us that it was some time during the run of this successful play that Watts Phillips made the clever little- autographic sketch which we now have the pleasure of presenting to the notice of our 14 THE STAGE YEAR BOOK A TRAGEDY OF THE WELL-MEANT BY MOSTYN T. PIGOTT. T HE Cabinet in council sat And bullyragged the Chamberlain ; Their epithets came pitter-pat ; Their meaning was extremely plain. They told him he must make some movement Which folks would take as an improvement. They pointed out how difficult It was to govern with success While he omitted to consult The views of men like G. B. S. The Drama, pushed beyond endurance, Contained more pitfalls than Insurance. There was a danger beyond doubt, If he were not more statesmanlike, That all the Drama would go out Upon a most disastrous strike, A blow of which the British nation Could hardly bear the contemplation. The Navy did not matter much ; The Army, too, could wait a bit; The Stage, however, was of such Enormous public benefit That he was bound with expedition To place it in a sound position. They did not mince their words at all, Nor did they chop their logic fine ; They simply said 'that they must fall, And must assuredly resign, If he could not contrive to calm a Large section of the British Drama. \" Remember,\" they impressed on him, \"This may no longer be delayed; The Drama's very lightest whim Must be implicitly obeyed. So put in instant execution Your scheme for this great institution.\" He could not fail to notice how Determined was the Premier's mien ; The frown upon that noble brow Was quite the darkest ever seen, And so, intensely heavy hearted, His Lordship gloomily c.eparted. THE STAGE YEAR BOO 'AT 15 He went away and brooded deep ; He took strange drugs to give him strength ; His nights were destitute of sleep ; His days seemed centuries in length. And through his brain the thought kept leaping, \" The common weal is in my keeping.\" His eye grew dim ; his hair turned grey ; His gait much suffering evidenced ; Till on a certain fateful day He suddenly experienced An absolutely new sensation — His Lordship had an inspiration ! \" What, though,\" he cried, in sheer delight, \" The time, pro tern., was out of joint, 'Tis I was born to set it right — A Second Censor I'll appoint ! Why longer doubt, why further parley? The problem's solved by Dear Old Charlie ! \" Imagine what a crushing load Was taken from that gentle soul ! With thrills of thankfulness he glowed, His feelings almost past control. The prospect of the Drama's gratitude Illumed his being with beatitude. Alas, how oft the plans of mice And men contrive to gang agley ! How oft will happiness, like ice, \" Incontinently melt away. And we, though lofty our endeavour, Discover we're worse off than ever ! The moment his pronouncement came Men hooted at the bland decree ; Where they'd till then hurled one harsh name They now hurled two and even three. They seemed to be by fury blinded — Especially the serious-minded. Derision's harassing guffaw With indignation's roar was blent ; Denunciation poured from Shaw, And Barker bayed his discontent. His Lordship, sundry worthies stated, Should be at once decapitated. Acres of acrimonious prose, And furlongs of envenomed verse, Were used by doubly-angered foes To emphasise their dreadful curse, Until one night he fled aboard-ship, And none knows where is now His Lordship. The moral of this tale is far From difficult, as you'll admit : A thing which is unpopular Is not improved by doubling it. And nothing than a sow's ear worse is For manufacturing silken purses. 36 THE STAGE YEAR BOOK. BOOKS OF THE YEAR. BY L. H. JACOBSEN. IN 1911, as in 1910, the book-world was disorganised, to a certain extent, by the bitter and acrimoniously waged political con/trove rsies of the time, and by the absorbing interest taken in solemn ceremonies incidental to the dynastic succes- sion. D-uring the spring and the early part of the summer the attention of the nation seemed to be focussed upon the Coronation, with its stately and august rites, led up to feverishly by hurried and, in some cases, belated preparations. Hence, for several months, but few books of importance were published, though again, as in the preceding year, the balance was partially redressed by the number of notable works issued during the autumn season. Once more, too, the fields of biography and memoirs, and of critical books, proved to be the mo&t fertile and fruitful. BIOGRAPHY AND MEMOIBS. Under this beading many inter esting and stimulating volumes of great pith and moment have appeared. The list of these may be headed with the autobiographical reminiscences of Mrs. Charles Calvert, entitled \" Sixty-eight Years on the Stage.\" In this the veteran and versatile actress, whose sons are worthily upholding the banner raised aloft in the old Manchester days by her and by the late Charles Calvert, had much to say both o.f the spacious past and of the present in which she has played a fairly active part. Heir remarks about the diverse changes that have taken place since, as a child of seven, she first toddled on to the stage might with advantage have been amplified. A great storehouse of anecdotes, reaching back to Early Victorian days, is formed by \" My Life's Pilgrimage,\" from the pen of the revered Thomas Catling. During ihis fifty years' association with Lloyd 's the recently retired editor of that paper had mixed freely with theatrical people, and had been present at many memorable first nights. Specially interesting may be thought the section of the work styled \" Theatres and the Press.\" A singer who has just taken her professional farewell of the concert platform — foo* she had been a stranger to the operatic, boards for a good many years — is that gifted and esteemed Canadian prim a- donna Emma Albani, whose own share in the putting together of her fascinatingly frank volume, entitled \" Forty Years of Song,\" might have received more effective co-operation from her assistant in the necessary work of preparing the book for the press. Albani's advice to singers and per- formers in general, that they should live steeped in an atmosphere of art, strikes a note the importance of which cannot be emphasised too clearly. A Grand Old Man indeed was Frederick James Furnivall, in whose honour has been composed a commemorative volume to which contributed alike his fellow-workers and those who had been inspired by his invigorating influence. A staunch friend and a sturdy fighter, Furnivall has his varied spheres of interest, notably those connected with the New Shakespere Society and other literary societies, faithfully shown in a little book that ought to be treasured on the shelves of every scholar. One's old friend \"Jimmy Glover,\" who rejoices also in the appellation of \" Master of Music at Drury Lane Theatre,\" may be congratulated on having written one of the raciest and brightest anecdotic books of the year. Most of the many facets of modern life are reflected in the mirror held up to nature in \" Jimmy Glover, His Book,\" in the pages of which actors, musicians, journalists, politicians, and men of the world will all find points of interest or matter for entertainment. Under the heading of \" More Rutland Bariungiton \" the popular ex-Savoyard gave another instalment of stories of his theatrical experiences and of more or less caustic com- ments on professional matters. One feels doubtful how to class Wagner's copious and minutely detailed memoirs lately published in a translation ; but, seeing that MISS GERTIE MILLAR In \" Tlie Quaker Girl.\" From Sketch by R. G. Matheu's. Reduced facsimile of a striking poster, the work of DAVID ALLEN & SONS. l,td. THE STAGE YEAR BOOK. 17 the work stopped in 1864 right in the middle of the Bayreuth Master's .public career, and that hence has later Music-Dramas are hardly discussed at all, the book, with its strong human interest, may be placed under the category of biography rather than of music. As it stands,* Wagner's \"My Life,\" though it has been thought disappointing in some q/uarters, may be deemed a notable contribution to one's knowledge of German artistic doings in the last century. Wagner's \" Family Letters \" might also be mentioned. CRIIICISM AND SCHOLARSHIP. First to be mentioned under this head is the superb Shakespeare Bibliography (a labour of love of twenty -two yeans), compiled and issued by William Jaggard, the bearer of a famous name, inasmuch as an earlier William Jaggard was one of the printers of the First Folio. Mr. Jaggard describes his work succinctly as \"A Dictionary of Every Known Issue of the Writings of the National Poet, and of Recorded Opinion Thereon in the English Language.\" This gives but the barest idea of the gigantic enterprise undertaken and accomplished so successfully by this Shakespearean enthusiast. An admira.biLe piece of Anglo-French, criticism was the work on David Garrick and his French Friends, written by F. A. Hedgcock, Reader in English at the Sorbonne. Originally written in French, this scholarly treatise, which throws new light on some portions of Ganrick's career, is now, it is understood, about to be published in English dress. One hardly knows how far to take seriously some of the opinions expressed in his \" Memoirs of a Manager,\" by Daniel Frohman, brother of Mr. Charles Frohman. Mr. Frohman had a good many interesting things to say about Sardou and Boucicault, but his chapter on \" Shakespeare at the First Rehearsal of 'Hamlet,'\" and his calling him \"the Bouoicault of his day,\" are almost too funny for words. The book is written absolutely from an American manager's point of view. There was a good deal of debatable matter, as well as an abundance of shrewd common sense, in a handy little book, \" The Dramatic Author's Companion,\" by A Theatrical Manager's Reader, to which Mr. Arthur Bourchier contributed an Introduction, short and to the point. That brilliant writer for the \" Manchester Guardian,\" C. E. Montague, author of that subtle study of a journalistic mercenary, \" A Hind Let Loose,\" re- printed .many of his critical articles in book form under the title of \"Dramatic Values.\" Obviously written in sympathy with the exponents of the Advanced School of Drama, Mr. Montague's book might in this respect be bracketed with Mr. E. F. Spence's \"Westminster Gazette \" collection, which was noticed last year. That Trans-Atlantic scholars appreciate the older playwrights as well as, it\" not better than, their fellow-workers on this side was shown once again by the volume of selected plays from' \" The Chieif Elizabethan Dramatists', excluding {Shakespeare,\" admirably edited by William Allan Nailson, Professor of English at Harvard University. A feature of this was the endeavour to ensure textual accuracy in the thirty plays reprinted by means of \" a first-hand collation of a number of the original Quartos.\" Mr. J. A. Bleackley, a well-known mimic, wrote a thoughtful little book mainly on his particular branch of the art. In \" Judgments in Vaca- tion,\" Judge Parry displayed the keenness and shrewdness of apprehension by which his utterances on the Bench have been characterised, the practitioners of the Literary Drama being herein told some home truths. One of the most trenchant and outspoken of German journalists, Maximilian Harden, did some admirable work in dramatic and art criticism in the volume of essays entitled \"Word Portraits\" in the translation executed so aDiy by Julius Gabe. More searching analyses of some of Ibsen's plays have seldom been read. A delightful booklet in the author's well-known sympathetic and picturesque style was \" The Story of Pierrot,'\" by S. R. Littlewood, which served as the opening volume of a promising new series. Finally, in his characteristically illustrated collection of essays and articles \" On the Art of the Theatre,\" Mr. Gordon Craig set forth once more his well-known views, regarded by so many as heterodox, on the matters of theatrical management and stage \"production.\" Designedly controversial though this work of Ellen Terry's earnest and enthusiastic son is, it contains much food for thought, and students may well ponder over its debatable matter, besides deriving new ideas of scenic art from the many curious and original illustrations that Mr. Gordon Craig had prepared. One of the Stage Society young men, Ashley Dukes, whose \" Civil War\" and a smaller piece of less account were brought out by that Society during the year, published a book on \" Modern Dramatists,\" which, for some' reason\" did not come before one for particular notice ; and there was also Cayley's volume •on \"Plays of our Forefathers.\" John Masefield combined succinct narrative with 18 THE STAGE YEAR BOOK. acute criticism in a handy little monograph on Shakespeare ; and the Oxford Shakespeare Glossary, by C. T. Spions, should also be noted. Music AND DANCING. Those students and lovers of music wiho may not be able to afford the New \" Grove \" might derive abundant instruction and information from \" Stokes 's Cyclopaedia of Music and Musicians,\" compiled and written by L. J. de Bekker. The work is full of excellent new features, and may be recommended as a capital book of reference. For the recent performances of \" The Magic Flute\" in English at Cambridge a new translation and an erudite monograph on the sources of Mozart's opera were prepared by Edward J. Dent, who hopes to follow them up with a moire elaborate work on the operatic writings of the composer in question. Passing mention may be made of a slender volume, \" Music-Drama of the Future,\" written in collaboration by Rutland Boughton and Reginald R. Buckley, the latter of whom also took part in a book on \" The Shakespeare Revival and the Stratford - upon-Avon Movement.\" There were some useful hints on the production of musical tone in \" Vocal Science and Art,\" by the Rev. Cha<rles Gib; and an elaborate work on elocution came from the painstaking pen of Mr. A. C. Sutherland. A well- arranged treatise on \"Dancing Ancient and Modern,\" by Etihel L. Urlin, dealt at some length with the latter-day revival of tthie popularity of the Ballet, and was beautifully illustrated from well-known paintings and drawings. One might men- tion, also, two books by that able American critic, H. T. Finck, \" Success in Music \" and \" Grieg and His Music \" ; Henderson's \" Forerunners of Italian Opera,\" E. M. Lee's \"Story of Opera,\" and A. Hullah's \"Little History of Music,\" this last the bearer of an honoured name. Included further in the list might be two foreign works, Vincent D'Indy's monograph on another modern composer, Cesar Franck, and Combarieu's Treatise on Music, Its Laws, and Evolution, in addition to such technical books as Galpin's \" Old English Instruments,\" Krehbiel's \" Pianoforte and Its Music,\" and H. C. Lahee's \" Organ and Its Masters.\" Another interesting group is formed by the Macmillan publications : \" Style in Musical Art,\" by Sir Hubert Parry; \" Music and Nationalism,\" a study of Eng- lish opera, by Cecil Forsyth ; \" Post- Victorian Music,\" by C. L. Graves; and \"Musical Composition\" (Vol. I. of \"The Musician's Library\"), by Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. MISCELLANEOUS. As it is to a certain extent a chronique scandaleuse, one may place here Francis Gribble's gossipy volume on \" Rachel : Her Stage Life and Her Real Life.\" Mr. H. B. Irving successfully called up recollections of his previous exploits in forensic literature with his able editing of a volume in a series of Notable English Trials. Although it was published ostensibly as a novel, under the name of \"Adventures of an Actor,\" Mir. Robert Castleton's book thus called was really a study, presum- aibly partly autobdoigraphiical, of tihe conditions of life on tour. The poems of Herbert Trench, collected for the first time in one volume, included some new things — 'for example, \"The Prelude to a Masque,\" spoken by MIPS. Patrick Campbell at tine Coronation Gala Performance — and minor bards to be praised are H. E. Garden and R. H. Lindo. Various works of fiction of a semi-theatrical or musical nature were also published in the course of the year from the pens, for example, of Rathmell Wilson, Clifton Bingham, and Gertie de Wentworth James. A brightly written booklet of travels with a musical comedy company in India and Java came from Gertrude de Lacy, who said more about what happened \" off \" than about her actual stage experiences on this Far Eastern tour. Several plays have received the added or preliminary honour of publication, and amongst these might be mentioned Laurence Housman's much-discussed \" Pains and Penalties,\" only just produced in semi-public ; Jerome K. Jerome's \" The Master of Mrs. Chilvers,\" plays by Maurice Maeterlinck, W. B. Yeats, and Lady Gregory, Stephen Phillips's \"Pietro of Siena,\" I. Zangwill's \" The War God,\" George Moore's \"The Apostle,\" and, if rather belated notice may be taken, Maurice Baring's Diminutive Dramas, these works by the author of \"The Grey Stocking\" and \"The Green Elephant\" being reprinted from the \"Morning Post.\" It is impossible here to enumerate all the articles on dramatic or musical subjects that have appeared in the course of the year in the magazines or reviews — articles which, if of burning, topical interest, receive added publicity in the newspapers. One might be singled out, the now celebrated \" National Review \" article on the Stage, from the caustic pen of Mr. Charles Brookfield, with which his appointment to the post of Joint Censor of Plays was preluded. SIR GEORGE ALEXANDER, J.P., L.CC, On whom the King conferred the honour of knighthood during the past year. 20 THE STAGE YEAR BOOK. THE REPERTORY THEATRE MOVEMENT. A NOTICEABLE advance has been made during the past year in the Reper- tory Theatre Movement, and perhaps the most (Significant feature of this advance is that it has been forthcoming as the result of no organised effort. In each town the initiative has been local, though no doubt the example of Glasgow and other towns has not been without rte effect. London, for all practicable purposes, may be counted out of the scheme. Mr. Charles Frohman did not continue the costly experiment he began at the Duke of York's in 1910, the ifailure of which, though it has probably set back the establishment of a repertory theatre in London for some years, was no proof that such a theatre was not required. Mr. Frohman's experiment suffered more on account of the plays produced than because the metropolitan audiences were unused to constantly changed programmes. At the Haymarket repertory was never seriously tried. Perhaps under repertory should be included Sir Herbert Tree's magnificent Shakespearean Festival achievement, which turns His Majesty's into a repertory theatre for five weeks during the year, and brings together companies headed by most of the prominent actors iand actresses who play in Shakespeare. In the provinces during the past twelve months the desire to break through the limitations in dramatic supply which the touring system has enforced has made itself felt in several towns. Sheffield, Leeds, Bristol, are among the towns where playgoers have banded themselves 'together ; while Liverpool has become possessed of ite own Repertory Theatre, the outcome of an experimental six weeks of repertory given at Kelly's in February. Though, as already noted, the initiative has in each case come from the town itself, the movement has progressed towards some organisation. On December 9 a conference was held at the offices of the Stage -Society. The Chairman of the Stage 'Society (Mr. Frederick Whelen) pre- sided, and others present were : — Miss A. E. F. Horniman and Mr. Robert Oswald (representing the Manchester Repertory Theatre), Mr. Alfred Wareing and Mr. Norman W. Dakie (representing the Glasgow Repertory Theatre), Mr. Basil Dean and Mr. C. H. Reily (representing the Liverpool Repertory Theatre), Mr. G. Bernard Shaw, Mr. Granville Barker, Mr. E. F. Spence, Mr. Lee Mathews, Mr. H. A. Hertz, the Hon. Everard Feilding, Dr. C. E. Wheeler, Mr. T. Sturge Moore, Mr. W. S. Kennedy, and Mr. A. E. Drinkwater (representing the Stage Society), Mr. G. L. Turner (Stockport), Mr. F. S. Jackson (Leeds), Mr. Dickinson (Bolton), Mr. William Archer, Miss Janet Achurch, Mr. Charles Charrington, and Mr. Frank Vernon. At the suggestion o«f Mr. Alfred Wareing that a permanent committee should be formed, the following resolution was moved by Mr. Granville Barker, and was carried unanimously : — That this conference is of the opinion that a Repertory Theatre Association should be formed in the interests of the existing repertory theatres, and to assist in the institution of new repertory theatres, and to ask the repertory theatres at Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool each to appoint a representative to act with the chairman and one other member of the Incorporated Stage Society in drawing up a scheme for .submission to a further meeting of the conference, the committee to have power to co-opt other members. The progress of the Manchester, the Glasgow, and the Liverpool theatres are dealt with in the following articles, while in another part of the book are recorded the activities of the various Playgoers' and Play Producing Societies. THE STAGE YEAR BOOK. 21 THE MANCHESTER REPERTORY THEATRE. Miss Horniman's first theatrical venture was at the Avenue Theatre, London, in 1894 It was a fruitful failure and a striking example of the fallacy ot the so-called box-office test. Reputations emanating from or associated with that effort included those of Bernard Shaw, W. B. Yeats, Aubrey Beardsley Granville Barker, and James Welch. Most noteworthy of all was the financial backer herself, whose name the world over is synonymous with that much-worked and little under- stood word — Repertory. After London Miss Horniman turned to Dublin and founded there a theatre, a company and a literature that will be a lasting monument to her name. But Dublin's was a local theatre. Miss Horniman wanted a repertory one, so she came wisely to the great metropolis of the north— Manchester— where for long there had been an agitation, and founded there the first repertory theatre in Great Britain. The announced objects of the theatre were : — (a) A repertory theatre with regular change of programme, not wedded to any one school of dramatists, but thoroughly catholic, embracing the finest writing by the best authors of all ages, and with an especially widely open door to the present-day British writers, who will not now need to sigh in vain for a hearing, provided only that they have something to say worth listening to, and say it in an interesting and original manner. Comedy and tragedy will both be given, but in the former the humour will be clean and hearty; it will not be fatuous, nor with the double entendre characteristic of so much \" comedy.\" (6) A permanent Manchester stock company of picked front rank artists. (c) Efficient production. (d) Popular prices. The campaign opened at the Midland Theatre on September 23, 1907. Soon afterwards the Gaiety Theatre was purchased and practically rebuilt, and since then Miss Horniman's company have, with brief touring intervals, played there regularly. The record — which is unparalleled — of plays staged in the four and a-half years is no fewer than eighty-eight, of which fifty-six were for the first time on any stage. Two seasons in London have been given, and the company are due to appear again at the Coronet Theatre in the summer of 1912. A high compliment has been paid by a guaranteed invitation to visit Montreal for a six weeks' season this spring. The entire company, with full equipment of scenery and properties will cross the water on February 2. The continual playing together and the changing about of parts and styles have produced an all-round technique, a combination, an ensemble, that no other com- pany working on the ordinary method of touring one play for an indefinite period, and with a \"star'\"' occupying the centre of the stage, most of the words, and all the limelight, could possibly attain to. It is the antithesis of a\" star company ; it is an all-star company. Mr. B. Iden Payne, Miss Horniman's art director, has been responsible for all'the productions up to October last, when he resigned, and Mr. Lewis Casson took up his position. The early promise of catholicity in the selection of plays has been abundantly fulfilled. Shakespeare, Euripides, Ibsen, (Shaw, Beaumont and Fletcher, Sheridan, Goldsmith, Ben Jonson, Maeterlinck, Sudermann, Galsworthy, St. John Hankin, Kingsley Tarpey, Rostand, -George Paston, Elizabeth Baker, Mrs. W. K. Clifford, Mrs. Havelock Ellis, Granville Barker, Arnold Bennett, C. B. Fernald, Emile Verhaeren, Basil Hood, John Masefield, J. M. Barrie, Haddon Chambers, and Sutro have all been represented. An important feature 1-as been the opportunity given to new writers to win their spurs, and a distinct school of Manchester playwright has been evolved. Many are now well known. These include Allan Monkhouse, Harold Brighouse, Stanley Houghton, H. M. Richardson, Judge Parry, M. A. Arabian, J. F. Bennett, Basil Dean, J. Sackville Martin, Fred E. Wynne, E. Hamilton Moore, Charles McEvoy, Gertrude Robins, etc. All clean tastes are catered for, grave and gay, lively and sincere, with the frequent spice of novelty. Musical comedy and pantomime are barred. Manchester has become an important producing centre. As the pioneer repertory theatre the Gaiety has led the way, and by assistance and advice has helped forward the reper- tory movement in other towns. Careful attention is paid to detail in staging. West End standards being adopted. The Gaiety has many special features. It 22 THE STAGE YEt.R BOOK is the only theatre in Great Britain in which every seat is numbered and reserved — a facility that is most popular. There is no advertisement curtain; the scheme of decoration is white and red, with no gilt ; the orchestra has neither brass nor drums; the advertisements are devoid of \"bluff\"; the printing is clean and dis- tinctive ; the dressing-rooms are well fitted and fireproof ; the theatre is cleansed by a vacuum installation, and the stage is safeguarded by sprinklers. Manchester is proud of and grateful to Miss Horniman. The University has bestowed upon her its honorary degree of Master of Arts; and the City Council, after a prolonged fight, has granted the long-sought unrestricted license. The public is rallying in appreciative support and in ever-increasing numbers. Many who had given up attending theatres have ibecome regular Gaiety-goers. The theatre is now a financial as well as an artistic success. May it be the forerunner of many others. EDWIN T. KEYS. THE SCOTTISH REPERTORY THEATRE. At first sight the"
