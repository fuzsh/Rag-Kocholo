        "text": "list of Summer Olympic athletes\n\nWhen sports fans look back and remember the Olympics of years gone by, it is not only their favorite sports that they remember but also the dynamic, talented, and inspiring athletes that made the Games worth watching. Below are select past and future Summer Olympic Games competitors and the countries for which they fought for Olympic glory. Whose stunning displays of athletic prowess do you remember?\n\nBaseball/Softball\n\nSoftball has been an official Olympic event since the 1996 Atlanta Games, while baseball was played at the Olympics from 1992 until 2008. At the 2020 Tokyo Games (delayed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic), the two were combined to become one sport with two separate events—women’s softball and men’s baseball.\n\nLisa Fernandez (U.S.)\n\nShohei Ohtani (Japan)\n\nDot Richardson (U.S.)\n\nBoxing\n\nBoxing first appeared as a formal Olympic event in 688 bce. In the modern Olympics boxing debuted for men at the St. Louis 1904 Games and for women at the London Games in 2012. There was no boxing event at the 1912 Games in Stockholm, as the sport was then illegal in Sweden.\n\nSugar Ray Leonard (U.S.)\n\nLászló Papp (Hungary)\n\nFelix Savón (Cuba)\n\nLeon Spinks (U.S.)\n\nMichael Spinks (U.S.)\n\nTeófilo Stevenson (Cuba)\n\nBadminton\n\nBadminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport at the 1972 Munich Games and as an exhibition sport at the 1988 Games in Seoul. At the Barcelona 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with men and women competing in singles and doubles events. Mixed doubles was introduced at the Atlanta 1996 Games.\n\nSaina Nehwal (India)\n\nBasketball\n\nMen’s basketball was introduced as a demonstration sport at the 1904 Games and then became an official event in 1936 at the Berlin Games. Women’s basketball debuted at the Montreal Games in 1976. The sport was played by amateurs until the 1992 Barcelona Games, which were the first Olympics to allow NBA players to participate. The 2020 Tokyo Games were the first to feature 3x3 basketball.\n\n1992 “Dream Team” (U.S.)\n\nAnne Donovan (U.S.)\n\nTeresa Edwards (U.S.)\n\nJimmer Fredette (U.S.)\n\nBrittney Griner (U.S.)\n\nSpencer Haywood (U.S.)\n\nJerry Lucas (U.S.)\n\nCheryl Miller (U.S.)\n\nYao Ming (China)\n\nBill Russell (U.S.)\n\nAzurá Stevens (U.S.)\n\nDiana Taurasi (U.S.)\n\nCanoeing\n\nThere are two types of canoeing competitions at the Olympic Games: canoe slalom—where athletes paddle through a whitewater course—and canoe sprint—where athletes race on a flatwater course. Canoe sprint is the older of the two competitions, having become an Olympic event in 1936. Each discipline has events employing either canoes or kayaks.\n\nLisa Carrington (New Zealand)\n\nJessica Fox (Australia)\n\nCycling\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nCycling in some form has been a part of the Olympics since the Athens Games in 1896. There are four different cycling disciplines—road, track, mountain bike, and BMX (bicycle motocross). Road-cycling races, the most widely known, have been held in every Games except 1900, 1904, and 1908, while track races were excluded only once, in 1912. Mountain-bike cycling was first featured in 1996, with two cross-country races, one for men and one for women. BMX cycling (racing only, no tricks) is the newest discipline, having debuted at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nChris Froome (Great Britain)\n\nChristopher Hoy (Great Britain)\n\nClara Hughes (Canada)\n\nChrista Luding-Rothenburger (East Germany)\n\nAnna Meares (Australia)\n\nBradley Wiggins (Great Britain)\n\nDiving\n\nDiving became a part of the swimming program of the Olympic Games in 1904 and developed rapidly through the first half of the 20th century. Synchronized diving, a competition in which two divers simultaneously perform a dive, became part of the Olympic program at the Sydney 2000 Games. The diving boards at the Olympics come in two forms—springboard (flexible) and platform (rigid).\n\nPhil Boggs (U.S.)\n\nGeorgia Coleman (U.S.)\n\nKlaus Dibiasi (Italy)\n\nVictoria Draves (U.S.)\n\nQuan Hongchan (China)\n\nGuo Jingjing (China)\n\nGreg Louganis (U.S.)\n\nPat McCormick (U.S.)\n\nFu Mingxia (China)\n\nWu Minxia (China)\n\nAileen Riggin (U.S.)\n\nShi Tingmao (China)\n\nFencing\n\nFencing for men has been part of the Olympic Games since their revival in 1896. Individual competition for women was first included in the 1924 Paris Olympic Games, and a team event was introduced at the 1960 Games in Rome. Today both men and women compete in individual and team competition in three events: foil (a sword with a light, flexible blade of rectangular cross section tapering to a blunt point), sabre (heavy military sword with a long cutting edge and, often, a curved blade), and épée (blunted sword).\n\nChristian d’Oriola (France)\n\nIlona Elek (Hungary)\n\nLucien Gaudin (France)\n\nAladár Gerevich (Hungary)\n\nEdoardo Mangiarotti (Italy)\n\nHelene Mayer (Germany)\n\nAldo Nadi (Italy)\n\nNedo Nadi (Italy)\n\nPeter Westbrook (U.S.)\n\nCornel Wilde (U.S.)\n\nJames Wolfensohn (Australia)\n\nFootball (soccer)\n\nFootball is the world’s most popular ball game, both in numbers of participants and spectators, and it has been played by men’s teams at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900 with the exception of the 1932 Games in Los Angeles. Women’s competition debuted in 1996 at the Atlanta Games.\n\nSamuel Eto’o (Cameroon)\n\nJulie Foudy (U.S.)\n\nSam Kerr (Australia)\n\nMia Hamm (U.S.)\n\nCarli Lloyd (U.S.)\n\nMarta (Brazil)\n\nLionel Messi (Argentina)\n\nAlex Morgan (U.S.)\n\nNeymar (Brazil)\n\nBirgit Prinz (Germany)\n\nMegan Rapinoe (U.S.)\n\nAbby Wambach (U.S.)\n\nIván Zamorano (Chile)\n\nGolf\n\nGolf was included in the Paris 1900 Olympic Games and the St. Louis 1904 Games. It was then discontinued as an Olympic sport for more than a century, returning in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games as a 72-hole event for men and women.\n\nMargaret Abbott (U.S.)\n\nPark In-Bee (South Korea)\n\nRory McIlroy (Great Britain)\n\nBubba Watson (U.S.)\n\nGymnastics\n\nThe 1896 Olympic Games marked the advent of international open competition in artistic gymnastics. Women first competed in the Amsterdam 1928 Olympics. The women’s program consists of six events (individual all-around, floor exercise, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and team competition), while the men’s has seven (individual all-around, floor exercise, vault, horizontal bar, parallel bars, pommel horse, rings, and team competition). Rhythmic gymnastics competition was added for women at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, and trampoline gymnastics were introduced for both sexes in 2000.\n\nNikolay Andrianov (U.S.S.R.)\n\nSimone Biles (U.S.)\n\nVěra Čáslavská (Czechoslovakia)\n\nVictor Chukarin (U.S.S.R.)\n\nNadia Comăneci (Romania)\n\nBart Conner (U.S.)\n\nGabby Douglas (U.S.)\n\nShilese Jones (U.S.)\n\nLarisa Latynina (U.S.S.R.)\n\nSuni Lee (U.S.)\n\nNastia Liukin (U.S.)\n\nShannon Miller (U.S.)\n\nMary Lou Retton (U.S.)\n\nKatō Sawao (Japan)\n\nBoris Anfiyanovich Shakhlin (U.S.S.R.)\n\nVitaly Scherbo (Belarus)\n\nKōhei Uchimura (Japan)\n\nRowing\n\nRowing events in the Olympic Games have been held for men since 1900 and for women since 1976. Rowers compete in teams of two, four, or eight over a 2,000-meter (6,560-foot) straight course on still water, with each crew or sculler racing in a separate, buoy-marked lane.\n\nJack Beresford (Great Britain)\n\nSteven Redgrave (Great Britain)\n\nEmma Twigg (New Zealand)\n\nShooting\n\nShooting competitions have appeared at all but two (1904 and 1928) of the Olympic Games since 1896 and are divided into three groups of instruments—pistol, rifle, and shotgun—in six disciplines with stationary and moving targets.\n\nAbhinav Bindra (India)\n\nMalcolm Cooper (Great Britain)\n\nKároly Takács (Hungary)\n\nSkateboarding\n\nWith its roots in youth subculture, skateboarding became internationally mainstream at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Competitors demonstrate their skills in two disciplines—park (bowls and bends) and street (urban surfaces and obstacles).\n\nRayssa Leal (Brazil)\n\nSport climbing\n\nSport climbing became an Olympic event at the 2020 Games in Tokyo. The sport involves three disciplines—bouldering, speed, and lead. At the Paris 2024 Games bouldering and lead will be combined into one competition, and a speed event will be held separately.\n\nNatalia Grossman (U.S.)\n\nPiper Kelly (U.S.)\n\nSurfing\n\nSurfing entered Olympic competition for both men and women at the 2020 Olympics Games in Tokyo.\n\nSally Fitzgibbons (Australia)\n\nCarissa Moore (U.S.)\n\nSwimming\n\nCompetitive swimming events have been part of the modern Olympics since the first Games in 1896.

Since the 1976 Montreal Games the event has comprised two lifts of a bar from the floor to above the athlete’s head—the snatch (one movement) and the clean and jerk (two movements). A weightlifting competition for women was added in 2000 at the Sydney Olympic Games.\n\nVasily Ivanovich Alekseyev (U.S.S.R.)\n\nTommy Kono (U.S.)\n\nNaim Suleymanoglu (Turkey)\n\nCharles Vinci (U.S.)\n\nArkady Vorobyev (U.S.S.R.)\n\nMiyake Yoshinobu (Japan)\n\nLeonid Ivanovich Zhabotinsky (U.S.S.R.)"
