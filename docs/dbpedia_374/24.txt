Rowing

The Netherlands had 3 boats, all from the Minerva Amsterdam club, compete in the first Olympic rowing competitions. They won 1 medal of each color. Because the unknown cox in the coxed pair final was a French boy, the gold medal is often credited as a mixed team medal rather than a Dutch one.
