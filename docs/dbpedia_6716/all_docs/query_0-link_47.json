        "text": "\"The idea it to use a small solar panel to heat up water producing steam.\"\n\nNope. First sentence being wrong makes the rest of your obscure post not worth paying much attention to.\n\nSmall solar panels will have an efficiency on the order of 25% at best, while a direct heater such as a mirror, will have heating efficiencies on the order of 60 to 70%. So a thermal system will provide about 3 times as much energy per unit area as solar cells.\n\nEDIT - I was asked to check an \"updated\" question.\n\nThe answer is still no. And the update makes no more sense than the original.\n\nSince solar in the UK sucks, because the weather is rainy, would it perhaps be better to use a smaller solar panel which is used to heat up free* tap water producing steam to turn a turbine creating more electric than solar alone would be capable of? In the UK most houses pay a fixed price for an unlimited amount of water, and we could also use rain water.\n\nQuestion - why do you think a solar panel is not \"solar\" (as in \"solar in the UK sucks\"). If the weather is rainy, why do you think that a solar panel will produce any energy? Did you miss the \"solar\" part of \"solar cell\"?\n\nFurthermore, any useful steam turbine will be a sealed cycle, so the amount of water used will, in the long run, be very, very small, and the price of water will make no difference.\n\nSince my original answer apparently did not register, let be be explicit.\n\nDirect (thermal) solar energy collection is about 3 times more efficient than a solar cell. This means that, for the same collector area and weather, 3 times as much steam can be heated directly as by solar panels. This means that a directly (thermally) driven steam turbine will produce 3 times as much power as one driven by solar panels.\n\nThe answer to your question remains no.\n\nEdit 2 -\n\nAdditionally, you have misunderstood the conditions being explored in the paper you cite. The nanoparticle treatment they discuss produces results in the marginal power regime where nucleation sites are the limiting factor in bubble production. This would correspond to the condition where normally the water is not quite boiling, and small bubbles which cling to the side of the kettle/pot are seen. Under these circumstances, the surface under discussion will produce many more bubbles, and the energy carried away in the steam in these bubbles will increase the heat flow through the walls of the vessel.\n\nHowever, in power generation regimes, equivalent to a rolling boil, bubble formation is not limited by availability of nucleation sites, so the new surface will not make a noticeable difference."
