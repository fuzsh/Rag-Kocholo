        "meta_description": "Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the world. Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.",

        "text": "Solar Technologies\n\nThere are three main ways to harness solar energy: photovoltaics, solar heating & cooling, and concentrating solar power. Photovoltaics generate electricity directly from sunlight via an electronic process and can be used to power anything from small electronics such as calculators and road signs up to homes and large commercial businesses. Solar heating & cooling (SHC) and concentrating solar power (CSP) applications both use the heat generated by the sun to provide space or water heating in the case of SHC systems, or to run traditional electricity-generating turbines in the case of CSP power plants.\n\nHow solar is used\n\nSolar energy is a very flexible energy technology: it can be built as distributed generation (located at or near the point of use) or as a central-station, utility-scale solar power plant (similar to traditional power plants). Both of these methods can also store the energy they produce for distribution after the sun sets, using cutting edge solar + storage technologies. Solar exists within a complex and interrelated electricity system in the U.S., working alongside other technologies like wind power to transition the U.S. to a clean energy economy.\n\nAll of these applications depend on supportive policy frameworks at the local, state and federal level to ensure consumers and businesses have fair access to clean energy technologies like solar.\n\nThe solar market today\n\nThere are more than 200gigawatts (GW) of solar installed in the U.S., enough to power 36.1 million homes. Over the last decade, the solar market in the United States has grown at an average rate of 25% each year. There are more than 4.8 million individual solar installations in the U.S., ranging from small home rooftop systems to large utility-scale systems that add hundreds of megawatts of clean electricity to the power grid.\n\nIf you're looking to install solar on your home or business, SEIA has a variety of resources to guide you through the process. Browse our customer portal to learn more about your options, what to look for in an offer, questions to ask a solar company, your rights as a consumer, and more. Also visit our partners SolarReviews and Solar-Estimate.org for further information as it pertains to individuals seeking general information on residential solar system prices and solar installers."
