The technology has been drastically improved the last years and has been complemented by solar battery storage systems, turning solar into a significantly more efficient source of clean energy. However, solar battery prices are something worth thinking about.\n\nHowever, there are always downsides no matter the energy source you choose to analyse. GreenMatch has outlined the key advantages and disadvantages of solar power in the following points:\n\nWhat are the advantages of solar panels?\n\nBy choosing solar energy, homeowners can benefit from many advantages that solar energy offers, such as:\n\nCheaper electricity bills: Solar panels generate cost-free electricity, reducing overall energy costs.\n\nEarn money back: Sell surplus energy to the grid for compensation through the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG).\n\nReduce carbon footprint: Sustainable energy reduces reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nYear-round efficiency: Effective even in cloudy UK weather, especially with advancements in technology.\n\nLow maintenance: Minimal upkeep required post-installation.\n\nIndependence from the grid: Generate your own electricity, reducing dependence on the grid.\n\nAffordability: Solar panels are increasingly cost-effective.\n\nCost savings: Utilise solar energy to save money.\n\nGrid independence: Keep your lights on during grid outages.\n\nIncreased home value: Installing solar energy can boost your property's value.\n\nClimate versatility: Solar systems work well in various climates, including the UK.\n\n1. Renewable energy source\n\nAmong all the benefits of solar panels, the most important thing is that solar energy is a truly renewable energy source. It can be harnessed in all areas of the world and is available every day. We cannot run out of solar energy, unlike some of the other sources of energy.\n\nSolar energy will be accessible as long as we have the sun, therefore sunlight will be available to us for at least 5 billion years when according to scientists the sun is going to die.\n\n2. Reduces electricity bills\n\nSince you will be meeting some of your energy needs with the electricity your solar system has generated, your energy bills will drop. How much you save on your bill will be dependent on the size of the solar system and your electricity or heat usage. This can be found in our 'is it worth getting solar panels?' guide.\n\nFor example, if you are a business using commercial solar panels this switch can have huge benefits because the large system size can cover large chunks of your energy bills.\n\nMoreover, not only will you be saving on the electricity bill, but there is also a possibility to receive payments for the surplus energy that you export back to the grid through the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG). If you generate more electricity than you use (considering that your solar panel system is connected to the grid).\n\n3. Diverse applications\n\nSolar energy can be used for diverse purposes. You can generate electricity (photovoltaics) or heat (solar thermal). Solar energy can be used to produce electricity in areas without access to the energy grid, to distil water in regions with limited clean water supplies and to power satellites in space.\n\nSolar energy can also be integrated into the materials used for buildings. Not long ago Sharp introduced transparent solar energy windows.\n\n4. Low maintenance costs\n\nSolar energy systems generally don’t require a lot of maintenance. You only need to keep them relatively clean, so cleaning them a couple of times per year will do the job. If in doubt, you can always rely on specialised cleaning companies, which offer this service from around £25-£35.\n\nMost reliable solar panel manufacturers offer 20-25 years warranty.\n\nAlso, as there are no moving parts, there is no wear and tear. The inverter is usually the only part that needs to be changed after 5-10 years because it is continuously working to convert solar energy into electricity and heat (solar PV vs. solar thermal). Apart from the inverter, the cables also need maintenance to ensure your solar power system runs at maximum efficiency.\n\nSo, after covering the initial cost of the solar system, you can expect very little spending on maintenance and repair work.\n\n5. Technology development\n\nTechnology in the solar power industry is constantly advancing and improvements will intensify in the future. Innovations in quantum physics and nanotechnology can potentially increase the effectiveness of solar panels and double, or even triple, the electrical input of the solar power systems.\n\nDon't want to wait any longer to reap all of these solar benefits?

The disadvantages of solar energy are:\n\nHigh initial cost: The initial investment for solar panels is substantial, including expenses for panels, inverters, batteries, wiring, and installation.\n\nWeather dependence: Solar panels rely on sunlight, so their efficiency decreases on cloudy or rainy days, and they cannot generate energy at night. This limitation affects the overall energy output, especially in regions with less consistent sunlight.\n\nExpensive energy storage: To use solar energy at night, it must be stored in batteries, which can be quite expensive. Often, it is more economical to use grid electricity at night if the solar system is grid-connected.\n\nSpace requirements: Installing enough solar panels to meet energy needs requires a significant amount of space. Not all roofs can accommodate the necessary number of panels, and additional space may be required in yards.\n\nPollution concerns: Although solar energy is cleaner than many alternatives, its production and installation involve emissions and the use of hazardous materials. The manufacturing process can produce pollutants, and solar panel disposal must be managed carefully to avoid environmental harm.\n\n1. Cost\n\nThe initial cost of solar panels is fairly high, especially highly efficient systems such as bifacial solar panels. This includes paying for solar panels, inverter, batteries, wiring, and installation. Nevertheless, solar technologies are constantly developing, so it is safe to assume that prices will go down in the future. While they sport higher efficiency, you will end up paying more for monocrystalline or black solar panels in the UK.\n\n2. Weather-dependent\n\nAlthough solar energy can still be collected during cloudy and rainy days, the efficiency of the solar system drops. Solar panels are dependent on sunlight to effectively gather solar energy. Therefore, a few cloudy, rainy days can have a noticeable effect on the energy system. You should also take into account that solar energy cannot be collected during the night. You should also take into account that solar energy cannot be collected during the night. Not even big system sizes like a 12kW solar system can collect solar energy at night.\n\nOn the other hand, if you also require your water heating solution to work at night or during wintertime, thermodynamic panels are an alternative to consider.\n\nFor a breakdown of how effective solar panels are in the winter, check out our video:\n\n3. Solar energy storage is expensive\n\nSolar energy has to be used right away, or it can be stored in large batteries. These batteries, used in off-the-grid solar systems, can be charged during the day so that the energy is used at night. This is a good solution for using solar energy all day long but it is also quite expensive.\n\nIn most cases, it is smarter to just use solar energy during the day and take energy from the grid during the night (you can only do this if your system is connected to the grid). Luckily your energy demand is usually higher during the day so you can meet most of it with solar energy.\n\n4. Uses a lot of space\n\nThe more electricity you want to produce, the more solar panels you will need, as you want to collect as much sunlight as possible. Solar PV panels require a lot of space and some roofs are not big enough to fit the number of solar panels that you would like to have. Some roofs also have obstacles like windows that could influence how much solar panels you can install. This problem occurs less with solar panels for flat roofs in the UK.\n\nAn alternative is to install some of the panels in your yard but they need to have access to sunlight. If you don’t have the space for all the panels that you wanted, you can opt for installing fewer to still satisfy some of your energy needs.\n\n5. Associated with pollution\n\nAlthough pollution related to solar energy systems is far less compared to other sources of energy, solar energy can be associated with pollution. Transportation and installation of solar systems have been associated with the emission of greenhouse gases.\n\nThere are also some toxic materials and hazardous products used during the manufacturing process of solar photovoltaic systems, which can indirectly affect the environment.\n\nNevertheless, solar energy pollutes far less than other alternative energy sources.\n\nMake the transition to solar energy today!\n\nThere are pros and cons to solar energy, but if this article has sparked your interest, you can check out our 7-step guide that will help you find the best solar panels for your home.
