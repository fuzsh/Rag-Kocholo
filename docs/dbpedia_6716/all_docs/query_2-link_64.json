        "text": "In 2022, residential solar panels generated 37 million megawatt-hours, accounting for 18% of all solar energy in the US, according to the Energy Information Administration. The average US home uses about 11,000 kilowatt hours per year, meaning residential solar panels generated enough electricity to power 3.4 million homes in 2022.\n\nSolar energy is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the US, according to the Department of Energy. The US had about 3.9 million photovoltaic solar power systems installed at residences at the end of 2022, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. That number has grown by an average of 37% per year since Congress passed a federal tax credit for solar power in 2005.\n\nIn 2022, Congress passed additional tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act to help more Americans invest in rooftop solar installation. A small percentage of all homes (2.7%) had solar panels installed by the end of 2022. Overall, residential solar generates a small fraction of total US energy, making up less than 1% of all electricity production in 2022.\n\nEnergy produced by small-scale solar vs. utility-scale solar facilities\n\nSmall-scale solar installations, including those at homes, businesses, and non-utility industrial sites, collectively generated 29% of all solar power in the US in 2022. At 61 million megawatt hours produced, small-scale solar power generated enough electricity for 5.6 million homes. That level of production is more than five times the amount from 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, solar farms and other utility-scale solar facilities produced enough electricity to power over 13 million homes in 2022, a total of about 144 million megawatt hours. Utility-scale solar facilities generated eight times more power in 2022 than in 2014.\n\nStates with the most residential solar panels\n\nHawaii has the largest share of homes powered by small-scale solar energy: 33% of single-family homes have installed residential solar power systems. California follows with 20% and Arizona at 12%, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Nationwide, 4.4% of single-family homes have solar power systems installed.\n\nHow much do solar energy systems cost?\n\nInstalling a residential solar power system typically costs between $15,000 and $35,000, according to the Department of Energy. Prices fluctuate based on location, the size and structure of individual homes, and the amount of energy a homeowner wants from their system. The federal solar tax credit covers 30% of a qualifying home solar energy system installed by the end of 2032.\n\nIn terms of energy produced, the cost of solar panels has fallen by nearly two-thirds since 2010. In 2022, the total cost of residential solar energy systems cost $3.16 per watt, compared to $8.70 per watt in 2010."
