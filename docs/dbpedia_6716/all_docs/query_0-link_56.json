        "text": "Uzbekistan’s energy sector is currently undergoing a large-scale transition. The key institutions and stakeholders for energy policy making and its implementation are summarised below.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy, established in February 2019, has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of energy policies, plans and programmes, and is authorised to play a central role in implementing renewable energy policy in Uzbekistan. It is also responsible for the regulation and supervision of the production, transmission, distribution and consumption of energy resources including electricity and the functioning of energy sectors, as well as the implementation of production-sharing agreements. Moreover, the ministry takes part in developing energy-related public-private partnerships (PPPs) and plays a role in improving the tariff policy in co‑operation with the inter-ministerial tariff council to facilitate the development of a competitive business environment.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance exercises price regulation, including tariff-setting for electricity, and general control over the financial stability of the state sector, among other functions. Moreover, the PPP Development Agency under the Ministry of Finance plays a key role in developing PPPs in co-operation with Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Energy.\n\nThe Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade is responsible for implementing the state investment policy, including foreign direct investments in the energy sector, and co-operating with international financial institutions and foreign governmental financial organisations. It is also responsible for devising and co-ordinating state policies on foreign trade and international economic co-operation.\n\nThe Ministry of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction is in charge of analysing and forecasting macroeconomic indicators and development based on proposed economic management market mechanisms and strategies to develop the main industries, including energy. The ministry also formulates strategies for industrial development in Uzbekistan based on the effective deployment of production forces, rations and food production.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers approves the rules for electricity and gas use and monitors investment programmes in the energy industry.\n\nThe State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics is the official authority collecting energy statistics. It will play an important role in the future in collecting data on off‑grid solar photovoltaics and solar heat use in households.\n\nThe Thermal Power Plants joint-stock company (JSC), a thermal power generation company, operates the majority of thermal power facilities in Uzbekistan, consisting of ten thermal power companies. As of 2021, Thermal Power Plants operates 11 thermal power plants, including co-generation1 plants, with an installed capacity of 11 669 MW. Formerly, the power sector in Uzbekistan was vertically integrated and Uzbekenergo, a state‑owned monopoly, was in charge of power generation, transmission, distribution and retail service, while serving the function of planning, investment, daily operation and regulation of the sector. With a view to strengthening competition in the sector, a decision was made in March 2019 to unbundle Uzbekenergo into three JSCs: Thermal Power Plants JSC, the National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan JSC and the Regional Electric Power Networks JSC.\n\nUzbekhydroenergo JSC is a state-owned company which operates hydropower plants, another important source of energy in Uzbekistan. The company was separated from Uzbekenergo JSC and established in May 2017. In total, it operates 37 hydropower plants with an installed capacity of 1 853 MW (EBRD, 2020).\n\nThe National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan JSC, the systems operator, is responsible for implementing centralised operational dispatch of all power plants and for operating transmission networks.\n\nThe Regional Electric Power Networks JSC is in charge of local electricity distribution. Its distribution and sales to consumers are handled by 14 territorial JSCs under its management.\n\nTo ensure energy security and promote renewable energy use, the government of Uzbekistan has adopted a wide range of strategies and laws related to energy.\n\nThe Strategy of Action for the Five Priority Development Areas of Uzbekistan in 2017‑2021, adopted in February 2017, provides key directions for economic development. In terms of energy, the strategy indicates the need for reducing the energy intensity and resource intensity of the economy, the widespread introduction of energy-saving technologies in production, and expanding the use of renewable energy sources.\n\nThe government expects the share of renewable generation in the power mix to increase to at least 20% by 2025 (compared to 9.4% in 2018), as indicated in the Strategy for Innovative Development of the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2019-2021, adopted in September 2018.\n\nBuilding reliable electricity networks is essential for the deployment of more renewables in the power sector. In this regard, the Strategy for the Development of Electric Networks in the Republic of Uzbekistan until 2025 was formulated in July 2019. It provides an overall plan for the construction of new and the modernisation of existing transmission and distribution lines and substations up to 2025.\n\nIn order to implement comprehensive measures to deepen structural reforms, modernise and diversify key sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, and balance the socio‑economic development of its territories, the government adopted the Strategy for the Transition of the Republic of Uzbekistan to the Green Economy for the Period 2019-2030 in October 2019. It encompasses a wide range of objectives within several priority areas, including the energy sector. As regards renewable energy technologies, it makes reference to:\n\nfurther developing renewables by raising their share in the power mix to more than 25% by 2030 (compared to 10.2% in 2019)\n\nmodernising the infrastructure of industrial enterprises and applying clean and environmentally safe technologies and industrial processes more widely\n\nusing solar collectors for water heating\n\nincreasing the automation of technological processes while reducing electric energy consumption for transmission and distribution\n\nimproving the main power network configurations and modernising them to increase power system stability\n\nequipping power consumption systems with smart meters.\n\nIn response to the Strategy for 2019-2030, the government developed the Concept Note for ensuring electricity supply in Uzbekistan in 2020-2030 in May 2020. This concept note defines medium- and long-term objectives and directions for the development of the power sector. It identifies six main objectives to improve electricity supply: 1) satisfying the country’s power demand; 2) improving the nation’s energy efficiency; 3) increasing the energy efficiency of power generation and transmission; 4) reducing the damage of power facilities; 5) developing and expanding the use of renewables and their system integration; and 6) developing an efficient electricity market. With a view to meeting the growing power demand while expanding renewable generation capacity, the following targets have been set:\n\nincrease power capacity from the 12.9 GW in 2019 to 29.2 GW by 2030 and electricity generation from 63.6 TWh in 2019 to 120.8 TWh by 2030\n\nincrease the capacity of renewable energy generation to 5 GW for solar power and 3 GW for wind by 2030 (compared with no large-scale solar PV plants operational in 2019).\n\nThe Uzbek government is currently planning to set a renewable capacity target of 4 GW for solar power and 4 GW for wind by 2026 (MoE, 2022). The country is also considering increasing the 2030 renewable capacity targets from 5 GW to 7 GW for solar PV and from 3 GW to 5 GW for wind (MoE, 2021a).\n\nThe Law on the Use of Renewable Energy Sources, adopted in May 2019, defines opportunities and incentives for individuals and manufacturers of renewable energy installations, including exemption of property and land tax. At the same time, the Law on Public‑Private Partnership (PPP) was enacted to allow/encourage private sector participation in public sector infrastructure projects, including those in the power sector. Multiple PPP projects are currently underway.\n\nThe Decree on Accelerated Measures to Improve Energy Efficiency of Economic and Social Sectors, the Introduction of Energy-Saving Technologies and the Development of Renewable Energy Sources was approved in August 2019. This decree defines the share of renewable electricity in the power mix to reach at least 25% by 2030. It also specifies subsidies to individuals and companies that install energy equipment, including solar PV facilities.\n\nThe Law on the Rational Use of Energy, amended in April 2020, stipulates the role of the Ministry of Energy in implementing a unified state policy on rational energy use applicable to all economic sectors and social facilities. In other words, it positions the ministry as a pillar for implementing the country’s energy policy, including renewables.\n\nThe Programme of Measures for Further Development of the Hydropower Sector for 2017‑2021, adopted in May 2017, addresses projects for the construction of new and the modernisation of existing HPPs and the provision of tax incentives for imported equipment required for these projects.\n\nIn its Nationally Determined Contributions, ratified in November 2018, Uzbekistan committed to decreasing specific GHG emissions per unit of GDP by 10% by 2030 from 2010 levels. As regards renewable energy, to improve energy efficiency in various sectors, the Nationally Determined Contribution proposes the development and broader use of renewable energy sources, such as constructing large solar PV power and biogas plants and scaling up wind power generation. Moreover, during the recent United Nations’ Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, the government announced its intention to reduce GHG emissions per unit of GDP by 35% by 2030. To achieve this ambitious target, the government needs to find a way to increase the total generation capacity of solar and wind to 8 GW by 2026, which means the current target needs to be achieved four years ahead of the schedule.\n\nIn close co-operation with international financial institutions, the government of Uzbekistan has been also developing several master plans to secure energy supply while achieving a carbon‑neutral power sector in the long term. The Power Sector Masterplan to 2030, developed with the technical support of the Asian Development Bank (September 2019), identifies ways to diversify the power mix and provides plans for achieving lower cost generation and reliable transmission development.\n\nThe Roadmap to Carbon-Neutral Electricity Sector in Uzbekistan 2050 was developed with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the government of Japan in January 2021. It provides insights on the policies, technologies and investments necessary to achieve a carbon-neutral power sector by 2050, and leverages advanced energy system modelling and scenario analysis tools. It also explores possible future development pathways for its power sector. The roadmap is not (yet) reflected in the government’s official targets.\n\nWith a view to ensuring sufficient power supply in the medium term, the Transmission Network Development Plan to 2030, developed with the assistance of the World Bank, was being finalised at the time of writing. The Distribution Network Development Masterplan is also under development, with the support from the Asian Development Bank.\n\nIn terms of heat, for the purpose of consistent heat supply to consumers and efficient use of energy resources, the Decree on the Program for the Development of the Heat Supply System for the period 2018-2022 was adopted in April 2017. It identifies the following as priorities for further development of the heat system in Uzbekistan: 1) introducing new energy sources, including renewables; 2) developing a decentralised heat supply system for apartments and other social facilities; 3) modernising and reconstructing outdated inefficient heating boilers; and 4) introducing an automated accounting system for the consumption and production of energy sources.\n\nThe table below summarises renewable generation and solar capacity targets."
