        "text": "Reliable Solutions for Efficient Solar Plants\n\nMaximum Uptime, Lower Maintenance Costs, and Reduce Engineering Time\n\nWe provide technologies that allow you to capture and convert solar energy reliably and efficiently to keep down costs. Our system and engineering teams help solar power developers to begin producing power more quickly. They also help operate and maintain the site more efficiently making solar power generation a more cost-effective alternative.\n\nAutomation Systems for Solar Power Plants\n\nWhether you update or replace your existing control system, we can help you migrate to a modern control system. Our PlantPAxÂ® distributed control system offers integration of process, motor, and safety control for more efficient operation. Combined with integrated solutions, it helps ensure high availability, reliability, and lowest cost of ownership. Our solutions are designed to extract the most value from your systems.\n\nLearn More About PlantPAx DCS\n\nSCADA Power Plant System\n\nOur visualization and information software solutions tied to our secure networking architecture help enable operators to monitor operations in real time. Our solutions include:\n\nSCADA solution to monitor and report solar field and balance of plant processes\n\nSequence of events (SOE) reporting for accurate alarm sequences that reduces troubleshooting time\n\nNetwork solutions, including NERC CIP consulting services, to help you assess, design, implement, audit, and manage your network infrastructure\n\nGodawari Concentrated Solar Power Plant\n\nPlantPAx DCS to Control CSP Thermal Power Plant\n\nLauren-Jyoti built a 50-megawatt concentrated green field solar power plant for Godawari Green Energy in Rajasthan, India. The plant will be one of the first utility-scale solar thermal power plants that is commissioned in India. This project is part of the Indian government initiative to incentivize the growth of solar power to 20,000 megawatts by 2020. Rockwell Automation will provide a PlantPAx distributed control system power plant solution with solar field local controller panels."
