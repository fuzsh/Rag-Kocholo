We will take on a significantly larger number of projects, with an annual development rate of ​​​​​​​4 GW by 2030.\n\nSolar power is a highly scalable energy source, as solar systems exist in many different sizes, from small plants on rooftops to utility-scale solar parks. Our strategic focus is on the latter type of development.\n\nThe energy from the sun’s radiations is referred to as solar energy. This energy is received as heat and light and can be converted to various useable forms – the most common being electricity. Photovoltaic cells convert the energy from solar radiations into electricity."
