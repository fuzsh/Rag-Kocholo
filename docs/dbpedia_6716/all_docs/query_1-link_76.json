Our next-gen concentrated solar power (CSP) plants capture the sun’s energy at a higher temperature (970C) than regular CSP and store it in simple ceramic pellets.\n\nThe result is inexpensive renewable storage that doesn’t use costly batteries or messy molten salts. This higher-temperature capture results in higher efficiencies at a lower cost.\n\nHeatStorE™\n\nBreakthrough HeatStorE™ technology converts the zero/low-cost excess power that’s produced by PV, wind, or the grid into ultra-high-temperature heat and stores it in ordinary sand for up to 20 hours or more.\n\nWhen power is needed again, atmospheric-pressure air is circulated through the heat storage system. This ultra-hot air drives a proprietary turbine that converts the heat to electricity without combustion or emissions, at a cost-effective rate."
