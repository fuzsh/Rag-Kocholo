        "text": "The biggest story inÂ renewable energy sourcesÂ over the past decade has been a consistent increase in the percentage of the energy mix from solar and wind power. Despite an unexpected year in 2020, both renewable energy sources remained resilient amidst the onset of COVID-19 and economic strife. Whatâs more, urgency around climate change and the planetâs health has sparked rapid innovation and a decline in cost for renewable energy generation, turning many homeowners, renters and businesses to greener energy alternatives.\n\nSolar and wind generation are both critical to decarbonizing our energy grid. Thereâs no question that the most practical residential renewable energy system today is solar but many homeowners have the option to benefit from wind power systems. In this piece weâll break down everything you need to know about solar vs. wind energy, to help you determine the right option for your electricity needs:\n\nSolar vs. wind energy: What produces the most electricity?\n\nSolar panels are a stationary source of power while wind turbines require moving parts. Solar generators need less maintenance and are much cheaper in the long run than their counterparts which can be expensive to maintain and repair when something goes wrong.\n\nSolar is the most common residential renewable energy system, but is it more efficient than wind energy? The most efficient residential solar panel on the market is able to convertÂ 20%Â of energy harnessed from the sun. On the other hand, wind turbines can convert betweenÂ 60% â 90%Â of the energy they harness from wind. So technically, wind energy is the front runner in efficiency when it comes to natural, clean energy. But are wind turbines better than solar power? Wind turbines have a higher energy yield than residential solar panels. Wind turbines can harness up to 50% of energy compared to 20% for solar panels. In fact, one wind turbine can generate the same amount of electricity in kWh compared to thousands of solar panels.\n\nOf course, no energy source comes without drawbacks. Unlike solar, wind turbines arenât suitable for densely populated areas, which is why they are most commonly seen in rural regions around the world. A typical residential wind turbine towers aroundÂ 80 feet, therefore it would only make sense for homeowners on large parcels of land located in rural, windy regions.\n\nSolar panels have the key advantage of being able to be installed on almost any roof or mounted on the ground, making it a more realistic solution for residential homes looking to tap into greener energy alternatives. Another common way for many homeowners, businesses and renters to go solar without actually installing anything on their roof, is through aÂ community solar program in their area. Participants can subscribe to a nearby solar farm and pay a lower price for the electricity sourced from it.\n\nIn conclusion, even though wind is more efficient at generating electricity, solar is the much more feasible choiceâ¦unless you have a very large backyard!\n\nCost of solar energy vs wind energy\n\nComparing the cost of solar vs. wind energy is not as simple as it may sound, since there are a lot of components that go into it, installation cost, energy output, tax credits, maintenance, etc. So, letâs look at it from an energy output perspective:\n\nA 10 kW PV solar system will have an average annual production ofÂ 14,165 kWh. The average cost of a system that size is aroundÂ $24,900, before tax credits.\n\nA 10 kW wind turbine can generate an average annual production of aroundÂ 14,016 kilowatts per hour. Small-scale residential wind turbines can cost up to $75,000 before tax credits.\n\nUnlike wind turbines, solar panels donât have any moving parts that could cause more wear and tear, resulting in more maintenance costs after initial investment.\n\nWhen comparing solar farm vs. wind farm, based on the numbers above, solar energy comes out ahead as a cheaper way to generate power for residential use. Itâs also much more feasible to install. But that doesnât necessarily mean weâre ruling out wind power completely; wind power still remains an effective technology at a utility-scale level (think large solar farms with dozens of wind turbines) and there are ways for homeowners to tap into wind energy. Read on to find out more.\n\nCombining solar and wind for your home\n\nIf you already have solar installed on your roof or are subscribed to a community solar farm, there are ways to tap into wind energy, too.\n\nIn deregulated markets, utility customers are able to select a third-party provider, also known as anÂ ESCO (Energy Service Company). Many ESCOs generate electricity or purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) on the open market equivalent to their customers energy usage. RECs are essentially proof that energy has been generated from renewable energy projects, such as wind farms. The end result, you save money on your electricity costs and promote growth in the green energy market.\n\nBoth solar and wind depend on natureâs resources, but overall, solar vs. wind energy, solar panels remain a great option for small-scale electricity generation. Whether you choose solar vs. wind for your home, there is no winner or loser. Either way, youâll be doing your part to reduce your environmental impact. There are only differences between the two, and both are valuable resources to paving the path towards a decarbonized future."
