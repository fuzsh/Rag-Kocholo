My main concern here would be that the solar windmill would apparently need to be much less than a gram in mass to be competitive with the solar panel and that does not appear feasible.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts or insights on this?\n\nThanks.\n\nYou know the drill here, Dan. Post references links to your technical reading, and show your efficiency calculations for the configuration you propose (using LaTeX please).\n\nThanks very much...\n\nVanadium 50 said:\n\nThere have been a half-dozen similar threads from the OP and I am struggling to find one that says \"a gizmo this big puts out this many watts\". Without that, it's difficult to have a sensible discussion.\n\nLet me try an efficiency calculation.\n\nLight moves fast. At the speed of light in fact. (*duh*). As a result, it tends to contain very little momentum per unit energy. By comparison, bullets, bowling balls, cars, cargo ships, water in penstocks and combustion products in gas turbines tend to have lot of momentum compared to their energy. That is because momentum is directly proportional to velocity while energy goes as the square of velocity -- ##mv## versus ##\\frac{1}{2}mv^2##. The ratio between the energy and momentum is ##\\frac{v}{2}##.\n\nThe faster you go, the less momentum you have per unit energy.\n\nIf you harvest the energy of light using a \"sail turbine\", what you are really capturing is the light's momentum. If the light bounces off your polished sail, most of its energy is retained in the reflected light. You have not captured that. If the light is absorbed by your blackened sail, most if its energy is deposited on the blackened surface, heating it up. You have not captured that. And now you have to dissipate the heat somehow.\n\nThe fraction of the light's original energy that is captured in the turbine will be given by the turbine blade's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.\n\nNote: If you are playing at home, you may notice a missing factor of two here. At light speed, ##E=pc##. Our Newtonian prediction was that ##E=p\\frac{v}{2}##. That is a factor of two error. But let us not quibble over such trifles. [This cancels with the other factor of two discrepancy from ignoring that we get twice the momentum by reflecting the light].\n\nIn an ordinary gas turbojet engine, turbine blade tip speeds are on the order of the speed of sound. Call it 300 meters per second. Compared to the speed of light at 300,000,000 meters per second. That is a ratio of a million to one.\n\nSo if the sails in a solar turbine are spinning at less than the speed of a jet engine then the turbine will have an efficiency of less than 0.0001 percent.\n\nPlain old solar cells can out-do that by at least five orders of magnitude.Digression alert...\n\nYou might object that we can improve efficiency by constructing the turbines from exotic materials. But there are limits to that.\n\nIf the tip speed is such that the kinetic energy of the molecules in the tip equals the chemical binding energy holding the molecules in the turbine blade together then the blade will fly apart. This limit turns out to be independent of how big you make the turbine. You can finesse it slightly by making the turbine blades broad at the base and narrow at the tip, but you'll only buy a small factor that way.\n\nNo possible chemical binding energy is sufficient to get a tip velocity at a significant percentage of light speed. Not even nuclear binding energies are sufficient.\n\nIf you are optimizing ultracentrifuges to maximize the centrifugal acceleration then the way you design around this materials limitation is to shrink the centrifuge. Since tip velocity is limited, you increase acceleration by decreasing radius.\n\nI am not an engineer. But I try to think like one.\n\nruss_watters said:\n\nI'm not sure what there is to calculate. Newton's third tells us that any/all torque applied to the shaft and used to extract power spins the entire spacecraft. You can only get around that partially and temporarily by letting different parts spin-up at different rates (not extracting the power).\n\nCounter-rotating turbines has been mentioned as a possibility. That seems like a good idea.\n\nOr you could rotate the blades on the ends of your Crooks type arrangement to swap the black and silvered sides periodically -- spinning up first one way and then the other.\n\nIf you are using Crooks style paddle blades, you could line up a bunch of radiometers. Array the radiometers in a helical pattern with its axis facing the sun. Line the blackened faces up in the center of the helix while the silvered faces are arrayed on the outside. This way the \"top\" black face shades all of the ones behind it but the silvered faces do not shade each other. You could even put a piece of blackened ship hull (or a solar cell) on top of the helix as a cap to shade all of the black paddle faces. Then you do not even need to paint the paddles.\n\nRube Goldberg would be proud.\n\njbriggs444 said:\n\nCounter-rotating turbines has been mentioned as a possibility.

For the sake of having something definite, it is a circular cylinder with one of the circular faces facing the sun. We will call this face the \"top\".\n\nWe mount a radiometer on the top, somewhere off center, almost on the rim. It is oriented like a paddle wheel with its axle parallel to the top and at right angles to a line of radius.\n\nWe blacken the \"front\" side of the paddle blades. [The \"front\" is the side that moves toward the sun]. Or we shade them. The \"front\" sides are toward the middle of the craft. The \"back\" sides are toward the rim.\n\nWe mount a second radiometer on the top, diametrically opposite to the first so that it is symmetric in all respects.\n\nBy symmetry, any thrust from light will supply zero net torque to the craft as a whole. However, one radiometer paddle wheel will rotate in one direction and the other paddle wheel will rotate in the opposite direction. We can theoretically harvest a tiny amount of power from each.\n\nruss_watters said:\n\nI'm thin on orbital dynamics, but doesn't that just increase the eccentricity over time?\n\nI believe that you get eccentricity. Perhaps you get an eccentricity that will precess. I am also thin on orbital dynamics. But I would expect that any progressive eccentricity (which I do not believe would result in the first place) could be dealt with by rhythmicly shading the silvered sides of the two radiometers in time with the orbit.\n\njbriggs444 said:\n\nSo if the sails in a solar turbine are spinning at less than the speed of a jet engine then the turbine will have an efficiency of less than 0.0001 percent.\n\nPlain old solar cells can out-do that by at least five orders of magnitude.\n\nI am not sure if this is entirely accurate. The efficiency calculation you outlined seems to say that efficiency will depend on the momentum transferred. But the energy produced depends on a current that is caused by rotation, where that rotation is caused by a momentum transfer, so I do not think the energy output can be put in terms of momentum.\n\nPower = Torque x angular velocity.\n\nLet's suppose torque is about (10 microNewtons * meters) (a fair supposition according to Wikipedia).\n\nIf we can increase angular velocity to 1 million rpm, our power output should be 1 Watt. A solar sail efficiency in outer space may be about 35%. Meaning that for 1360 Watts from the sun, about 476 Watts turns into power generated. If this is correct, then the \"solar windmill\" will only be about two orders of magnitude different from the solar panel.\n\nIf the \"solar windmill\" can be made sufficiently lightweight (low mass), then it should generate more electricity per kilogram, and could therefore be a preferable alternative to solar panels.\n\nAdditionally, it may be that the rpm can be increased beyond 1 million rpm. Further, torque may be able to be increased by either increasing the radius of spin or by adding mirrors to increase light intensity (and therefore the force of light) on the \"solar windmill.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance\n\nhttps://www.solar.com/learn/space-based-solar-vs-conventional-solar-how-are-they-different/"
