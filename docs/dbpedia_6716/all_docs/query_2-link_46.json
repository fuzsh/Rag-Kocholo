        "text": "Solar basics\n\nEnergy from the sun\n\nThe sun has produced energy for billions of years and is the ultimate source for all of the energy sources and fuels that we use today. People have used the sun's rays (solar radiation) for thousands of years for warmth and to dry meat, fruit, and grains. Over time, people developed technologies to collect solar energy for heat and to convert it into electricity.\n\nRadiant energy from the sun has powered life on earth for many millions of years.\n\nCollecting and using solar thermal (heat) energy\n\nAn example of an early solar energy collection device is the solar oven (a box for collecting and absorbing sunlight). In the 1830s, British astronomer John Herschel used a solar oven to cook food during an expedition to Africa. People now use many different technologies for collecting and converting solar radiation into heat energy for a many uses.\n\nWe use solar thermal energy systems to heat\n\nWater for use in homes, buildings, or swimming pools\n\nThe inside of homes, greenhouses, and other buildings\n\nFluids to high temperatures in solar thermal power plants\n\nSolar photovoltaic systems convert sunlight into electricity\n\nSolar photovoltaic (PV) devices, or solar cells, change sunlight directly into electricity. Small PV cells can power calculators, watches, and other small electronic devices. Arrangements of many solar cells in PV panels and arrangements of multiple PV panels in PV arrays can produce electricity for an entire house. Some PV power plants have large arrays that cover many acres to produce electricity for thousands of homes.\n\nSolar energy has benefits and some limitations\n\nUsing solar energy has two main benefits:\n\nSolar energy systems do not produce air pollutants or carbon dioxide.\n\nSolar energy systems on buildings have minimal effects on the environment.\n\nSolar energy also has some limitations:\n\nThe amount of sunlight that arrives at the earth's surface is not constant. The amount of sunlight varies depending on location, time of day, season of the year, and weather conditions.\n\nThe amount of sunlight reaching a square foot of the earth's surface is relatively small, so a large surface area is necessary to absorb or collect a useful amount of energy.\n\nWhere solar is found and used\n\nSolar energy is sunshine\n\nSunshine is radiant energy from the sun. The amount of solar radiation, or solar energy, that the earth receives each day is many times greater than the total amount of all energy that people consume each day. Use of solar energy, especially for electricity generation, has increased a lot in the United States and around the world in the past 30 years.\n\nLatitude, climate, and weather patterns are major factors that affect insolation—the amount of solar radiation received on a given surface area during a specific amount of time. Locations nearer the equator and in arid climates generally receive higher amounts of insolation than other locations. Clouds, dust, volcanic ash, and pollution in the atmosphere affect insolation levels at the surface. Buildings, trees, and mountains may shade a location during different times of the day in different months of the year. Seasonal (monthly) variations in solar resources increase with increasing distance from the earth’s equator.\n\nThe type of solar collector also determines the type of solar radiation and level of insolation that a solar collector receives. Concentrating solar collector systems, such as those used in solar thermal-electric power plants, require direct solar radiation, which is generally greater in arid regions with few cloudy days. Flat-plate solar thermal and photovoltaic (PV) collectors are able to use global solar radiation, which includes diffuse (scattered) and direct solar radiation. Learn more about solar radiation.\n\nSolar thermal collectors\n\nLow-temperature solar thermal collectors absorb the sun's heat energy to heat water for washing and bathing or for swimming pools, or to heat air inside buildings.\n\nConcentrating collectors\n\nConcentrating solar energy technologies use mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto receivers that absorb solar energy and convert it to heat. We can use this thermal energy for heating buildings or to produce electricity with a steam turbine or a heat engine that drives a generator.\n\nPhotovoltaic systems\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. PV systems can range from systems that provide tiny amounts of electricity for watches and calculators to systems that provide the amount of electricity that hundreds or thousands of homes use. Millions of houses and buildings around the world have PV systems on their roofs and there are many large PV power plants.\n\nUse of solar energy\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that total solar energy use in the United States increased from about 0.06 trillion British thermal units (Btu) in 1984 to about 1,870 trillion Btu in 2022. Solar electricity generation accounted for about 97% of total solar energy use in 2022 and direct use of solar energy for space and water heating accounted for about 3%.\n\nTotal U.S. solar electricity generation increased from about 5 million kWh in 1984 (nearly all from utility-scale, solar thermal-electric power plants) to about 204 billion kWh in 2022. In 2022, utility-scale PV power plants accounted for 70% of total solar electricity generation, small-scale PV systems accounted for 29%, and utility-scale solar thermal-electric power plants accounted for 1%. Utility-scale power plants have at least 1,000 kilowatts (kW) (or one megawatt [MW]) of electricity generation capacity. Small-scale PV systems have less than one MW generation capacity.\n\nAccording to EIA’s International Energy Statistics, total world solar electricity generation grew from 0.4 billion kWh in 1990 to about 1.306 billion (about 1.3 trillion) kWh in 2021. The top five producers of solar electricity and their percentage shares of world total solar electricity generation in 2021 were:\n\nChina–33%\n\nUnited States–16%\n\nJapan–9%\n\nIndian–6%\n\nGermany–%\n\nSolar photovoltaic\n\nPhotovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity\n\nA photovoltaic (PV) cell, commonly called a solar cell, is a nonmechanical device that converts sunlight directly into electricity. Some PV cells can convert artificial light into electricity.\n\nPhotons carry solar energy\n\nSunlight is composed of photons, or particles of solar energy. These photons contain varying amounts of energy that correspond to the different wavelengths of the solar spectrum.\n\nA PV cell is made of semiconductor material. When photons strike a PV cell, they may reflect off the cell, pass through the cell, or be absorbed by the semiconductor material. Only the absorbed photons provide energy to generate electricity. When the semiconductor material absorbs enough sunlight (solar energy), electrons are dislodged from the material's atoms. Special treatment of the material surface during manufacturing makes the front surface of the cell more receptive to the dislodged, or free, electrons so that the electrons naturally migrate to the surface of the cell.\n\nThe flow of electricity\n\nThe movement of electrons, each carrying a negative charge, toward the front surface of the cell creates an imbalance of electrical charge between the cell's front and back surfaces. This imbalance, in turn, creates a voltage potential like the negative and positive terminals of a battery. Electrical conductors on the cell absorb the electrons. When the conductors are connected in an electrical circuit to an external load, such as a battery, electricity flows in the circuit.\n\nThe efficiency of photovoltaic systems varies by the type of photovoltaic technology\n\nThe efficiency at which PV cells convert sunlight to electricity varies by the type of cell material and technology. The efficiency of PV modules averaged less than 10% in the mid-1980s, increased to around 15% by 2015, and is now approaching 20% for state-of-the art modules. Experimental PV cells and PV cells for space satellites are nearly 50% efficient.\n\nHow photovoltaic systems operate\n\nThe PV cell is the basic building block of a PV system. Individual cells can vary in size from about 0.5 inches to about 4 inches across. However, one cell only produces 1 or 2 Watts, which is only enough electricity for small uses, such as for powering calculators or wristwatches.\n\nPV cells are electrically connected in a packaged, weather-tight PV module or panel. PV modules vary in size and in the amount of electricity they can produce. PV module electricity generating capacity increases with the number of cells in the module or in the surface area of the module. PV modules can be connected in groups to form a PV array. A PV array can be composed of two or hundreds of PV modules. The number of PV modules connected in a PV array determines the total amount of electricity the array can generate.\n\nPhotovoltaic cells generate direct current (DC) electricity. This DC electricity can be used to charge batteries that, in turn, power devices that use direct current electricity. Nearly all electricity is supplied as alternating current (AC) in electric power lines. Devices called inverters are used on PV modules or in arrays to convert the DC electricity to AC electricity.\n\nPV cells and modules will produce the largest amount of electricity when they are directly facing the sun. PV modules and arrays can use tracking systems that move the modules to constantly face the sun, but these systems are expensive and are mostly used in large PV power plants. Most PV systems on buildings have modules in a fixed position with the modules facing directly south (in the northern hemisphere—directly north in the southern hemisphere). Learn more about PV collector tilt angles and PV collector tracking systems.\n\nApplications of photovoltaic systems\n\nThe smallest photovoltaic systems power calculators and wristwatches. Larger systems can provide electricity to pump water, to power communications equipment, to supply electricity for a single home or business, or to form large arrays that supply electricity to thousands of electricity consumers.\n\nSome advantages of PV systems are\n\nPV systems can supply electricity in locations where electricity distribution systems (power lines) do not exist, and they can also supply electricity to an electric power grid.\n\nPV arrays can be installed quickly and can be any size.\n\nThe environmental effects of PV systems located on buildings is minimal.\n\nHistory of photovoltaics\n\nThe first practical PV cell was developed in 1954 by Bell Telephone researchers. Beginning in the late 1950s, PV cells were used to power U.S. space satellites. By the late 1970s, PV panels were providing electricity in remote, or off-grid, locations that did not have electric power lines. Since 2004, most of the PV panels installed in the United States have been in grid-connected systems on homes, buildings, and central-station power facilities. Technical advances, lower costs for PV systems, and financial incentives and government policies have helped to greatly expand PV use since the mid-1990s. Hundreds of thousands of grid-connected PV systems are now installed in the United States.\n\nEIA estimates that electricity generated at utility-scale PV power plants increased from 6 million kilowatthours (kWh) in 2004 to 143 billion kWh in 2022. Utility-scale power plants have at least 1,000 kilowatts (or one megawatt) of electricity generating capacity. EIA estimates that 59 billion kWh were generated by small-scale grid-connected PV systems in 2022, up from 11 billion kWh in 2014. Small-scale PV systems are systems that have less than 1,000 kilowatts of electricity generation capacity. Most small-scale PV systems are located on buildings and are sometimes called rooftop PV systems.\n\nSolar thermal power plants\n\nSolar thermal power systems use concentrated solar energy\n\nSolar thermal power (electricity) generation systems collect and concentrate sunlight to produce the high temperature heat needed to generate electricity. All solar thermal power systems have solar energy collectors with two main components: reflectors (mirrors) that capture and focus sunlight onto a receiver. In most types of systems, a heat-transfer fluid is heated and circulated in the receiver and used to produce steam. The steam is converted into mechanical energy in a turbine, which powers a generator to produce electricity. Solar thermal power systems have tracking systems that keep sunlight focused onto the receiver during the day as the sun changes position in the sky.\n\nSolar thermal power systems may also have a thermal energy storage system component that allows the solar collector system to heat an energy storage system during the day, and the heat from the storage system is used to produce electricity in the evening or during cloudy weather. Solar thermal power plants may also be hybrid systems that use other fuels (usually natural gas) to supplement energy from the sun during periods of low solar radiation.\n\nTypes of concentrating solar thermal power plants\n\nThere are three main types of concentrating solar thermal power systems:\n\nLinear concentrating systems, which include parabolic troughs and linear Fresnel reflectors\n\nSolar power towers\n\nSolar dish/engine systems\n\nLinear concentrating systems\n\nLinear concentrating systems collect the sun's energy using long, rectangular, curved (U-shaped) mirrors. The mirrors focus sunlight onto receivers (tubes) that run the length of the mirrors. The concentrated sunlight heats a fluid flowing through the tubes. The fluid is sent to a heat exchanger to boil water in a conventional steam-turbine generator to produce electricity. There are two major types of linear concentrator systems: parabolic trough systems, where receiver tubes are positioned along the focal line of each parabolic mirror, and linear Fresnel reflector systems, where one receiver tube is above several mirrors to allow the mirrors greater mobility in tracking the sun.\n\nA linear concentrating collector power plant has a large number, or field, of collectors in parallel rows with a north-south orientation so that the mirrors track the sun from east to west and concentrate sunlight continuously onto the receiver tubes during the day.\n\nParabolic troughs\n\nParabolic trough power plant\n\nA parabolic trough collector has a long parabolic (curved-shaped) reflector that focuses the sun's rays on a receiver pipe located at the focus of the parabola. The collector moves to focus sunlight on the receiver as the sun moves through the sky during the day.\n\nBecause of its parabolic shape, a trough can focus the sunlight from 30 times to 100 times its normal intensity (concentration ratio) on the receiver pipe, located along the focal line of the trough, achieving operating temperatures higher than 750°F.\n\nParabolic trough linear concentrating systems are used in one of the longest operating solar thermal power facilities in the world, the Solar Energy Generating System (SEGS) located in the Mojave Desert in California. The facility has had nine separate plants over time, with the first plant in the system, SEGS I, operating from 1984 to 2015, and the second, SEGS II, operating from 1985 to 2015. SEGS III–VII (3–7), each with net summer electric generation capacities of 36 megawatts (MW), came online in 1986, 1987, and 1988. SEGS VIII (8) and IX (9), each with a net summer electric generation capacity of 88 MW, began operation in 1989 and 1990, respectively. SEGS 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 all ceased operation in 2021, leaving only SEGS 9 in operation as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn addition to the SEGS, many other parabolic trough solar power projects operate in the United States and around the world. The four largest projects in the United States after SEGS are:\n\nSolana Generating Station: a 296 MW project in Gila Bend, Arizona\n\nMojave Solar Project: a 275 MW project in Barstow, California\n\nGenesis Solar Energy Project: a 250 MW project in Blythe, California\n\nNevada Solar One: a 69 MW plant near Boulder City, Nevada\n\nLinear Fresnel reflectors\n\nLinear Fresnel reflector (LFR) systems are similar to parabolic trough systems in that mirrors (reflectors) concentrate sunlight onto a receiver located above the mirrors. These reflectors use the Fresnel lens effect, which allows for a concentrating mirror with a large aperture and short focal length. These systems are capable of concentrating the sun's energy to about 30 times its normal intensity. Compact linear Fresnel reflector (CLFR)—also referred to as a concentrating linear Fresnel reflector—are a type of LFR technology with multiple absorbers within the vicinity of the mirrors. Multiple receivers allow the mirrors to change their position so they do not shade other reflectors. This improves system efficiency and reduces costs. A demonstration CLFR solar power plant was built near Bakersfield, California, in 2008, but it is currently not operating.\n\nSolar power towers\n\nSolar power tower\n\nA solar power tower system uses a large field of flat, sun-tracking mirrors called heliostats to reflect and focus sunlight onto a receiver on the top of a tower. Sunlight can be concentrated as much as 1,500 times. Some power towers use water as the heat-transfer fluid. Advanced designs are experimenting with molten nitrate salt because of its superior heat transfer and energy storage capabilities. The thermal energy-storage allows the system to produce electricity during cloudy weather or at night.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy and several electric utilities built and operated the worlds's first demonstration solar power tower near Barstow, California, during the 1980s and 1990s. Two solar power tower projects now operate in the United States:\n\nIvanpah Solar Power Facility: a facility with three separate collector fields and towers with a combined net summer electric generation capacity of 393 MW in Ivanpah Dry Lake, California\n\nCrescent Dunes Solar Energy Project: Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project: a 110 MW one-tower facility with an energy storage component in Tonapah, Nevada\n\nSolar dish/engines\n\nSolar dish/engines\n\nSolar dish/engine systems use a mirrored dish similar to a very large satellite dish. To reduce costs, the mirrored dish usually has many small flat mirrors formed into a dish shape. The dish-shaped surface directs and focuses sunlight onto a thermal receiver, which absorbs and collects the heat and transfers it to an engine generator. The most common type of heat engine used in dish/engine systems is the Stirling engine. This system uses the fluid heated by the receiver to move pistons and create mechanical power. The mechanical power runs a generator or alternator to produce electricity.\n\nSolar dish/engine systems always point straight at the sun and concentrate solar energy at the focal point of the dish. A solar dish's concentration ratio is much higher than linear concentrating systems, and it has a working fluid temperature higher than 1,380°F. The power-generating equipment of a solar dish can be placed at the focal point of the dish, making it well suited for remote locations, or the energy may be collected from many dishes and converted into electricity at a central point.\n\nThere are no utility-scale solar dish/engine projects in commercial operation in the United States.\n\nSolar thermal collectors\n\nHeating with the sun's energy\n\nPeople use solar thermal energy to heat water and air. The two general types of solar heating systems are passive systems and active systems.\n\nPassive solar space heating happens when the sun shines through the windows of a building and warms the interior. Building designs that use passive solar heating usually have south-facing windows that allow the sun to shine on solar heat-absorbing walls or floors during the day in the winter. The absorbed solar energy heats the building by natural radiation and convection at night. Window overhangs or shades block the sun from entering the windows during the summer to keep the building cool.\n\nActive solar heating systems use a collector and a fluid that absorbs solar radiation. Fans or pumps circulate air or heat-absorbing liquids through collectors and then transfer the heated fluid directly to a room or to a heat storage system. Active solar water heating systems usually have a tank for storing solar heated water.\n\nSolar collectors are either nonconcentrating or concentrating\n\nNonconcentrating collectors—The collector area (the area that intercepts the solar radiation) is the same as the absorber area (the area absorbing the radiation). Solar systems for heating water or air usually have nonconcentrating collectors. Flat-plate collectors are the most common type of nonconcentrating collectors for water and space heating in buildings and are used when temperatures lower than 200°F are sufficient.\n\nFlat-plate solar collectors usually have three main components:\n\nA flat metal plate that intercepts and absorbs solar energy\n\nA transparent cover that allows solar energy to pass through the cover and reduces heat loss from the absorber\n\nA layer of insulation on the back of the absorber to reduce heat loss\n\nSolar water heating collectors have metal tubes attached to the absorber. A heat-transfer fluid is pumped through the absorber tubes to remove heat from the absorber and transfer the heat to water in a storage tank. Solar systems for heating swimming pool water in warm climates usually do not have covers or insulation for the absorber, and pool water is circulated from the pool through the collectors and back to the pool.\n\nSolar air heating systems use fans to move air through flat-plate collectors and into the interior of buildings.\n\nConcentrating collectors—The area intercepting the solar radiation is greater, sometimes hundreds of times greater, than the absorber area. The collector focuses, or concentrates, solar energy onto an absorber. The collector usually moves so that it keeps sunlight focused on the absorber. Solar thermal power plants use concentrating solar collector systems because they can produce high temperature heat.\n\nSolar energy & the environment\n\nAn array of solar photovoltaic panels supplies electricity for use at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California\n\nSolar energy systems/power plants do not produce air pollution, water pollution, or greenhouse gases. Using solar energy can have a positive, indirect effect on the environment when solar energy replaces or reduces the use of other energy sources that have larger effects on the environment.\n\nSome toxic materials and chemicals are used to make the photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity. Some solar thermal systems use potentially hazardous fluids to transfer heat. Leaks of these materials could be harmful to the environment. U.S. environmental laws regulate the use and disposal of these types of materials."
