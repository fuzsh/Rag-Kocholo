It is dead simple to determine the installed capacity. For example, if we install 10 solar panels rated at 250 watts each, we will have a capacity of 2500 watts, or 2.5 kW. However, determining the actual output from these panels is much more challenging (this is one of the reasons why we developed <a title=\"Discover\" href=\"/home/solar/discover/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhatNextNow Solar Discover</a>: to help you with the output estimates). TheÂ capacity factor is simply the ratio of energy generated over a time period (typically a year) divided by the installed capacity.",
