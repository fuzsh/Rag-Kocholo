        "text": "Why Go Solar?\n\nBy investing in a renewable system for your home or business, you can feel good about reducing your carbon footprint and contributing to a more sustainable future for all.\n\nWhen you generate your own energy, you will likely buy less from the grid. Depending on your usage, this could reduce your bill. You can even earn bill credits for any excess energy you generate. Bill credits can be used to offset costs when you use more electricity than you generate.\n\nIf you’re considering solar, we’re here to help you learn about your different options and offer a step-by-step process of how to get started.\n\nAbout Solar Plus Battery Storage\n\nBattery storage enables you to store energy generated by your solar panels. Benefits of battery storage include storing energy you generated during the day to be used at night and increasing your savings by exporting or selling power back to the grid.\n\nThe new modernized Solar Billing Plan incentivizes solar paired with battery storage to allow customers to use stored electricity or sell (export) excess electricity back to the grid during on-peak hours when prices are higher due to increased demand.\n\nImage\n\nGet Informed\n\nStart by reading the California Solar Consumer Protection Guide. This guide takes you through every step of the solar installation process, provides tips to select a qualified solar provider, and outlines your rights as a consumer.\n\nDid you know that your solar provider is required to collect your signature on the Solar Consumer Protection Guide before submitting your interconnection application?\n\nView Guide\n\nImage\n\nMake Your Home More Energy Efficient\n\nBefore you install solar, try to make your home more energy efficient. If you can reduce your energy use, you may be able to reduce the size of the solar system you need, potentially saving you thousands of dollars in installation costs.\n\nVisit Savings Tips for Your Home for ways to save on energy. You may also want to consider participating in a residential demand response program."
