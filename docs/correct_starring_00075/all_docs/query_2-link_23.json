        "text": "Everybody Wants To Be A Cat, after all ðŸ˜»\n\nAnother animated Disney classic is receiving the live-action treatment! After the success of The Lion King, The Jungle Book and Dumbo - with many more on the way including The Little Mermaid - Disney have turned their attentions to another favoured animal-themed film... The Aristocats!\n\nThe beloved 1970 animation followed the story of a family of cats, who are cruelly kidnapped by their wealthy owner's butler in a bid to replace them in her will - and their journey back home, with many jaunts along the way.\n\nNow, Disney have named musician, DJ and actor Questlove, best known as drummer and joint frontman of US TV host Jimmy Fallon's house band the Roots. He also served as one of the producers for the cast recording of worldwide theatre hit Hamilton.\n\nTaking to Instagram, Questlove shared a snap of Variety's report of his appointment, writing alongside in a caption: 'They chose I to chase the catâ€¦ I basically have 2 life goals: 1. Donâ€™t dismiss my dreams & 2. Get out of my own way.'\n\nAlthough there's no word yet on casting or release date, we do know that the film will be a \"blend\" of live-action performances as well as CGI, according to Variety, who also report that the screenplay is being adapted by Will Gluck and Keith Bunin.\n\nWill Gluck is known for writing the likes of Friends with Benefits, the 2014 musical adaptation of Annie and the 2018 live-action remake of Peter Rabbit, as well as its 2021 sequel. Keith Bunin was a writer on Disney's 2020 flick Onward.\n\nThe original film starred Hollywood superstar Eva Gabor as the main cat Duchess, mother of the three kittens, with longtime Disney collaborator Phil Harris as her love interest Thomas O'Malley, who can also be heard as Baloo in The Jungle Book and Little John in Robin Hood.\n\nFellow Disney star Sterling Holloway performed the role of mouse sidekick Roquefort. He had previous roles in Dumbo, Bambi, Alice in Wonderland and The Jungle Book - although he's possibly most famous as the voice of Winnie the Pooh.\n\nAmerican musician and The Shining actor Scatman Crothers performed as Scat Cat, and Mary Poppins actress Hermione Baddeley voiced the cats' owner Adelaide.\n\nScroll through to see which Disney live-action remakes have been released so far:\n\nRead more:\n\nAll the important dates you need to know for Disney's live-action remakes\n\nThe Little Mermaid: Cast give spine-tingling performance in first full-length trailer\n\nAll of the Disney films coming out in 2023\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
