        "text": "Actor Gary Dubin, who was famous for appearing in several movies during his childhood, including in The Partridge Family sitcom, has died from cancer at the age of 57.\n\nDubin’s sister, Lori Ellie Dubin, announced his death on Facebook on Saturday, October 8. Dubin passed away in Burbank, California, after a battle with bone cancer.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1273271019370440&set=a.238106166220269.65083.100000626621875&type=3\n\n“It’s hard to accept that he’s gone,” Dubin’s sister wrote.\n\nLori, who is a visual artist in New Orleans, has set up a Go Fund Me page to cover the cost of her trip to attend her brother’s funeral in California. She revealed that Dubin suffered for more than 16 months before he died last week.\n\nDubin is survived by Lori, his mom Barbara, his wife Marietha, and his extended relatives, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nGary Dubin was born in California on May 5, 1959. He went into acting at a very young age, appearing in the CBS TV series Jericho. Dubin worked on several other acting projects as a child. He was the voice behind Toulouse, the oldest kitten in The Aristocats (1970). On The Partridge Family, Dubin played the role of Punky Lazaar, a friend of Danny Partridge (played by Danny Bonaduce).\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ClassicHollywoodLosAngelessfv/posts/571008619759982?match=Z2FyeSBkdWJpbg%3D%3D\n\nHe appeared in many other movies and TV shows including Jaws 2, Splendor in the Grass, Diamonds Are Forever, Land of the Giants, Mannix, Green Acres, Here Comes The Brides, The April Fools, Power Rangers Time Force, V, and many others. Dubin’s most recent movie is RockBarnes: The Emperor in You, which was released in 2013.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/massacredbymothernaturegambin/photos/a.1448319715384095.1073741828.1448141922068541/1818275438388519/?type=3\n\nLori revealed that Gary Dubin later went into theatrical productions and comedy. He also taught acting.\n\n“He was always one to tell funny jokes & good stories and loved to surround himself with his many friends & family,” Dubin’s sister wrote on Go Fund Me. “He was always kind, sentimental & generous to everyone & anyone.”\n\nSince the news surfaced that Gary Dubin is dead, many actors and fans have been paying tribute to him on social media.\n\n“Gary Dubin, excellent actor & guy, has passed. Best friend I made on set of The Partridge Family. RIP,” actor Danny Bonaduce, who played Danny Partridge on The Partridge Family, wrote on Twitter.\n\n“I am heartbroken that I lost a dear friend over the weekend to bone cancer. Gary Dublin was my first boyfriend. We remained friends for over 40 years. His mother Barbara is so strong. Stronger than I could ever be. I’ll miss you Gary. You were a good friend. I love you,” singer Cherrie Currie, who used to be part of the 1970’s all-female rock band The Runaways, wrote on Facebook.\n\n“So saddened tonight to hear of Gary Dublin’s passing. Gary was one of the first people I met in 10th grade and we were best friends for years. We used to tear the town up every weekend in our 20’s. I have so many fond memories of our friendship every birthday, every New Year’s and though we haven’t kept in touch for the past few years I always considered you one of my best friends. I’m sorry I didn’t have the chance to say goodbye. My condolences to your sweet mom and sister. Rest in peace my friend,” Marcelo Guilis wrote on Facebook.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154659254757139&set=a.10150710910317139.448580.626452138&type=3\n\nGary Dubin’s death adds to the growing list of celebrity deaths in 2016. Many notable celebrities have passed away this year, including Gene Wilder, Prince, Muhammad Ali, David Bowie, and others.\n\nThere has been no announcement regarding any funeral plans for the departed Gary Dubin.
