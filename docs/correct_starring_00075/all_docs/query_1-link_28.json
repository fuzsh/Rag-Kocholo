        "text": "After an almost 40-year career in vaccine development, I’ll soon be leaving Takeda to retire. I feel so fortunate to have spent my entire professional career in vaccine development. Vaccines are one of humanity’s greatest achievements- a public health tool that should never be taken for granted. My passion for vaccines dates back to the early days of the HIV epidemic, when I was an ID fellow working in the AIDS clinic at the Hospital of U Penn. I saw the relentless impact of an disease which could not be prevented or controlled, witnessing loss and despair which fueled my determination to focus my career on prevention of infectious diseases. During the 20 yrs I spent at GSK Vaccines, I had the privilege of overseeing development programs targeting a wide range of vaccines against infectious disease threats. I’m proud of my team’s work that culminated in the launch of vaccines against HPV, Malaria, seasonal and pandemic Influenza, Meningococcal meningitis, and Herpes Zoster, to name a few. Many of these vaccines have become staples in routine immunization programs worldwide. The last nine years I’ve spent in Takeda’s Vaccine Business Unit have also been incredibly rewarding. I have had the opportunity to work on the development of candidate vaccines against Norovirus, Zika and COVID-19, and have found it especially rewarding to have supported the development and commercialization of a vaccine targeting the prevention of dengue fever. Dengue is a significant global health threat which continues to grow. I’m proud of everything we’ve accomplished together and have the utmost confidence in the future success of the organization. I’m thrilled to share that effective June 1, @Derek Wallace has been appointed to be my successor as President of Takeda’s Global Vaccine Business Unit. Derek has more than 17 years of vaccines experience and since joining Takeda in 2013, has played a critical role in the success of our dengue vaccine. In the remaining time leading up to my retirement in January 2025, I will serve Takeda’s Vaccine Business Unit in an advisory role. As I reflect on my career, I’m filled with pride and gratitude. I’m proud of the contributions I have been able to make to vaccine solutions to some of the world’s most pressing health challenges and I’m grateful to have worked with so many talented and passionate colleagues dedicated to global public health. I want to particularly thank the following individuals who have helped guide me in my career at critical inflection points: @Harvey Friedman, Stanley Plotkin, David Krause MD, FACP, Ralf Clemens, Jean Stephenne, Moncef Slaoui, Rajeev Venkayya, MD, Ramona Sequeira and Christophe Weber. Thanks to all of you who work in the vaccine ecosystem for your friendship, collaboration and leadership over the years. I’ll be watching as you continue our collective mission to improve global public health (and hopefully I’ll continue to contribute in small ways from the sidelines)!\n\nWe can help achieve a more equitable and accessible healthcare system through the seemingly small decisions we make every day. It’s imperative that we recognize the unique needs and cultural nuances of the communities we serve, especially in the distribution of critically needed vaccines. One size does not fit all, and our approach must be inclusive and tailored to the diverse populations we aim to protect. At Takeda, we know that to expand access to our dengue vaccine and accelerate global dengue prevention efforts in the long term, we must lead with innovative thinking and challenge ourselves to develop vaccine distribution strategies that can optimize even the smallest details to deliver the biggest impact to communities around the world. Our latest collaboration with Biological E. Limited is a great example of the importance of partnership and a shared passion for advancing public health programs to help protect some of the most vulnerable populations. Read my latest article for more on how we’re furthering access to dengue prevention, one vaccine vial at a time. #publichealth #vaccines #dengue #TeamTakeda\n\nAs a scientist, I am a strong believer in the power of data. Sometimes that data is qualitative - direct insights from patients and their lived experiences - and other times it is quantitative - allowing us to assess the impact we’ve made toward battling a disease by evaluating the numbers. However, it’s all incredibly instrumental in our day-to-day work as we fight against infectious diseases like dengue. And when this data is made accessible to the public, it opens the door for global understanding of how far we’ve come and how much further we have to go. I recently shared my thoughts on the publication of our long-term data for Takeda’s dengue vaccine and the importance of data transparency. I encourage each of us to ask ourselves, what role can I play in supporting the unrestricted access to scientific knowledge? https://lnkd.in/dWShtQQN #dengue #publichealth #vaccines #TeamTakeda\n\nWhat an incredible start to the year for the vaccine community! It’s great to see that research & development addressing infectious diseases has made the list as one of the top areas most likely to see therapeutic progress in 2024. There are many exciting advances on the horizon for vaccine development that I can’t wait to see come to fruition. For Takeda, this will be a year of building on the progress we’ve experienced to date with our dengue vaccine and exploring more innovative approaches to improve global public health. Many thanks to Citeline Commercial for including my thoughts on the year ahead for biopharma in the final installment of the “Scrips Asks” series. Read more on my predictions for the coming year, along with those of more than 100 biopharma executives and experts. #vaccinations #publichealth #innovation"
