        "text": "Like many who immigrated to the United States, Dubin is not likely the original family name. The name may be a contraction from Dubjonsky as shown in the family tree or some near variant like dubchansky. Within the Ellis Islands records, the name Dubin 1st appears in 1892. My ancestor, Israel Dubin, eventual husband of Sarah & Father of Jack, Alvin & Myron, is believed to have immigrated as a small boy approximately 1903 but there is no record in that year except for an Israel Dubchansky, a 17 year old whereas Israel Dubin would have been 11. There is a record for an Israel Dubin entering in 1905, but as a 6 year old apparently accompanied by a young mother named Lure which is also inconsistent on both counts with family verbal history."
