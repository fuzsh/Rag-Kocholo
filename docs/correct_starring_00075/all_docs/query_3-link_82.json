        "text": "Actor Marc Gilpin has tragically died aged 56 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nMarc is best known for his role as the younger son of Roy Scheider’s Police Chief Martin Brody in Jaws 2 in 1978. The beloved actor's sister and Frasier star Peri Gilpin confirmed the news of her brother's death to the Hollywood reporter.\n\nThe actor heartbreakingly passed away after a long battle with aggressive brain tumour - glioblastoma. Last May, a fundraiser was set up to help raise money for his medical costs to ease the financial burden on Marc and wife Kaki and their two sons as they 'faced the unimaginable'.\n\nIn the same month, Marc was diagnosed with two tumours in his brain, one in the central area, meaning it is not able to be surgically removed due to the location. GoFundMe campaign organiser Kim Parks explained: “The tumor has not grown, shrunk some, and had no new satellites. Neuro Oncologist very encouraged by the response to treatment.“\n\nWhile Marc's family were already dealing with the heartbreak of cancer during his fight, they were also trying their best to manage their difficult financial issues as his campaign page detailed the family's struggles.\n\nThe page read: \"As if this is not enough for this family of four to endure, they are also dealing with significant financial stress. Recently Marc lost his job along with his company paid insurance plan and has been actively pursuing new employment.\n\n\"Facing this medical crisis, Marc is clearly unable to gain employment at this time. His wife, Kaki, is an elementary school teacher which is the most admirable profession but sadly also very underpaid. Given the current crisis situation they are in, Kaki has had to take FMLA time off of work to navigate all of the doctor appointments, treatments and more. Therefore, her salary is even more reduced during this period.\"\n\nThis comes after Marc heartbreakingly said goodbye to two of his sisters in recent years. April died in July 2017 at age 48 an, Patti passed away in 2020 at age 57.\n\nMarc is survived by his wife of 24 years Kaki, and their sons Spencer, 18, and Presley, 16."
