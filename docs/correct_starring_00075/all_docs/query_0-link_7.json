        "text": "The Aristocats (also stylized as The AristoCats) is a 1969 animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released on December 24, 1969. The 20th animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon, the film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of aristocratic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after the butler Edgar catnaps them to gain his mistress' fortune, which was meant to go to them. The title is a pun on the word \"aristocrats\". The film's basic idea — an animated romantic musical comedy about talking cats in France — had previously been used in the UPA animated feature Gay Purr-ee which was released in 1962, 8 years before The Aristocats made its debut at the box office.\n\nDisney began production of a sequel, The Aristocats II, in December 2005, set to release in 2007, but production was cancelled in early 2006.\n\nThe film is noted for being along with The Jungle Book (1967) the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney himself, thought it should be noted that he was also working on other projects like The Rescuers as far back as 1962, as he died in late 1966, ten months before the film was released. While the film gained overall favorable reviews and a solid box office performance, it did not match the earlier success of One Hundred and One Dalmatians or The Jungle Book. Today, while the film is very iconic, it is seen as a successful by the Disney company and the start of Disney Bronze Age.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe year is 1910. On an autumn day in Paris, a mother cat named Duchess and her three kittens ― Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse ― live in the mansion of retired opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, along with her English butler, Edgar Balthazar. She early on settles her will with her lawyer, Georges Hautcourt - an aged, eccentric old friend of hers - stating that she wishes the \"faithful\" Edgar to look after her beloved cats until they die. Only then will he inherit the fortune himself. Edgar hears this from his own room and believes he will be dead before he inherits Madame Adelaide's fortune, and so plots to remove the cats from a position of inheritance (clearly not thinking about how he would be essentially in control of the fortune, despite having to take good care of them).\n\nEdgar sedates the cats by putting an entire bottle of sleeping pills into their food and then heads out into the French countryside to dispose of them. However, two hound dogs named Napoleon and Lafayette attack him. After the conflict, Edgar escapes, leaving behind his umbrella, hat, the cats' bed basket and the sidecar of his motorcycle in the process. The cats are left alone and afraid in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the Mouse and Frou Frou the horse discover their absence. In the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris.\n\nThey have a struggle returning to the city, briefly hitchhiking on the back of a milk cart before being unfortunately chased off by the driver. Marie subsequently falls into a river after a train roars down the tracks and is saved by O'Malley. They then meet a pair of British white geese, Abigail and Amelia Gabble, who are traveling to Paris. The group heads off leaving the countryside, marching like geese, until they reach Paris and come across the girls' drunken Uncle Waldo. Abigail and Amelia then depart to take Waldo home. Traveling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet Scat Cat and his band, close friends to O'Malley, who perform the song \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\". After the band has departed and the kittens lie in bed, O'Malley and Duchess spend the evening on a nearby rooftop and talk, while the kittens listen at a windowsill. The subject of their conversation is the question of whether Duchess can stay and be with Thomas.\n\nReluctantly, Duchess sadly turns him down, largely out of loyalty to Madame Adelaide, pointing out that Madame really does love her and her kittens - some cuts to Madame Adelaide show that she truly is very unhappy without her cats, and feeling very much alone. The listening kittens are disappointed, although they too wish to go home, but are sad to say goodbye to Thomas, though Berlioz says they almost had a father. Edgar, meanwhile, retrieves his sidecar, umbrella, and hat from Napoleon and Lafayette with some difficulty.\n\nThe cats make it back to the mansion, whereupon O'Malley departs sadly after he and Duchess have a heartfelt farewell moment. Edgar sees Duchess and Kittens coming and suddenly captures them, places them in a sack and briefly hides them in the oven. The cats tell Roquefort to pursue O'Malley and get help. He does so, whereupon O'Malley races back to the mansion, ordering Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. Edgar places the cats in a trunk which he plans to send to Timbuktu, Africa so they can never come back. O'Malley, Scat Cat and his gang, and Frou-Frou all fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and kittens. In the end, Edgar is tipped into the trunk, locked inside, and is sent to Timbuktu himself. Madame Adelaide's will is rewritten to exclude Edgar and include O'Malley. She starts a charity foundation providing a home for all of Paris' stray cats. The grand opening thereof, to which most of the major characters come, features Scat Cat's band, who perform a reprise of \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\". Napoleon and Lafayette join in the party, but realize it sounds like the end, the words \"The End\" hit Napoleon on the head, then he ducks down saying the line while it shows itself on-screen, the cats finish their song with a happy ending while the \"The End\" title card dances, then Toulouse says his final line \"Oh Yeah\" from earlier on just as the movie officially ends fading black showing \"Walt Disney Productions under \"The End\".\n\nProduction[]\n\nStory development[]\n\nOn December 9, 1961, Walt Disney suggested that Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan find some animal stories to adapt as a two-part live-action episode for the Wonderful World of Color television program. By New Year's 1962, McGowan had found several stories including a children's book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City. However, Tytle felt that a London location had added a significant element to One Hundred and One Dalmatians and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris. Following a rough storyline, the story became about two servants—a butler and a maid—who were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines. Boris Karloff and Francoise Rosay were in mind to portray the butler and the distressed Madame. A subplot centered around a mother cat hiding her kittens to keep them out of danger in a variety of different homes and locales around Paris, France. During the filming of Escapade in Florence, McGowan brought him the story that had been written by Tom Rowe, an American writer who was living in Paris.\n\nBy August 1962, they sent the completed script to Burbank, where it was returned as \"rejected\" by an unknown executive at the Disney studios. Nevertheless, Tytle brought the script to Walt staying at the Connaught in London. Disney approved for the draft but recommended additional cuts which were made by February 1963. Before filming was to commence Paris, Rowe wrote a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions, in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Walt approved of would be kept. However, by summer 1963, the project was shelved, where Tytle, in a discussion with Walt, recommended to produce The Aristocats as an animated feature. For that reason, Walt temporarily shelved the project as the animation department was occupied with The Jungle Book. Meanwhile, director Wolfgang Reitherman learned of the project and suggested it as a follow-up project to Jungle Book. Because of the production delays, Tytle was advised to centralize his efforts on live action projects and was replaced by Winston Hibler.\n\nIn 1966, Disney assigned Ken Anderson to determine whether Aristocats would be suitable for an animated feature. With occasional guidance from Reitherman, Anderson worked from scratch and simplified the two stories into a story that focused more on the cats. Walt saw the preliminary sketches and approved the project shortly before his death. After The Jungle Book was completed, Walt and his team began work on Aristocats, which was still on after Walt's death. Hibler was eventually replaced by Reitherman, who would abandon the more emotional story of Duchess's obsession to find adopters befitting of her kittens' talents initially favored by Walt suggesting instead the film be conceived as an adventure comedy in the vein of One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Furthermore, the character Elvira, the maid, who was intended to be voiced by Elsa Lanchester, was removed from the story placing Edgar as the central antagonist in order to better simplify the storyline.\n\nCasting[]\n\nAs with The Jungle Book, the characters were patterned on the personalities of the voice actors. In 1966, Walt Disney contacted Phil Harris to improvise the script, and shortly after, he was cast to voice Thomas O'Malley. To differentiate the character from Baloo, Reitherman noted O'Malley was \"more based on Clark Gable than Wallace Beery, who was partly the model for Baloo.\" Reitherman furthermore cast Eva Gabor as Duchess, remarking she had \"the freshest femme voice we've ever had\", and Sterling Holloway as Roquefort. Louis Armstrong was initially reported to voice Scat Cat, but he backed out of the project in 1969 for unknown reasons. Out of desperation, Scatman Crothers was hired to voice the character under the direction to imitate Armstrong. Pat Buttram and George Lindsey were cast as the farm dogs, which proved so popular with the filmmakers that another scene was included to have the dogs when Edgar returns to the farm to retrieve his displaced hat and umbrella. Dal McKennon was considered to voice Roquefort but he declined.\n\nAnimation[]\n\nKen Anderson spent eighteen months developing the design of the characters. Five of Disney's legendary \"Nine Old Men\" worked on it, including the Disney crew that had been working 25 years on average.\n\nCast[]\n\nPhil Harris as Thomas O'Malley (full name: Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley the Alley Cat) – the male protagonist. He is a friendly alley cat who finds Duchess and her kittens stranded in the woods and befriends them, becoming a father figure to the kittens and falling in love with Duchess.\n\nEva Gabor as Duchess the White Cat – the female protagonist. She is Madame Adelaide's cat and mother of three kittens. She falls in love with Thomas and is forced to choose her life at home or a life with Thomas. Robie Lester provided her uncredited singing voice.\n\nRoddy Maude-Roxby as Edgar Balthazar – Madame Adelaide's butler and the main antagonist of the film. He hopes to get rid of the cats in order to inherit Adelaide's fortune.\n\nGary Dubin as Toulouse – the oldest kitten, he aspires to meet a tough alley cat and adores Thomas as a father figure. He acts very tough at times and often gets into Marie's and Berlioz's nerves. He is a painter.\n\nLiz English as Marie – the middle and only female kitten. Not only is she very bossy at times, but she also believes that by being female, she is the best of the three kittens. She, like Berlioz and Toulouse, grows to love Thomas like a father. She loves singing.\n\nDean Clark as Berlioz – the youngest kitten. He is somewhat timid and shy. Like Toulouse and Marie, he grows to love Thomas like a father. He plays the piano.\n\nSterling Holloway as Roquefort the Mouse – a friend of the cats. He attempts to find them after they are catnapped but is unsuccessful.\n\nScatman Crothers as Scat Cat – Thomas's best friend and leader of a group of music-loving alley cats. Plays the trumpet.\n\nPaul Winchell as Shun Gon the Chinese (Siamese) Cat – a member of Scat Cat's gang. Plays the piano and drums that are made out of pots.\n\nLord Tim Hudson as Hit Cat the English Cat – a member of Scat Cat's gang. Plays acoustic guitar.\n\nVito Scotti as Peppo the Italian Cat – a member of Scat Cat's gang. Plays the accordion.\n\nThurl Ravenscroft as Billy Boss the Russian Cat – a member of Scat Cat's gang. Plays cello bass guitar.\n\nPat Buttram as Napoleon the Bloodhound – a farm dog who attacks Edgar when he intrudes on the farm, unknowingly saving the lives of Duchess and her kittens. Napoleon insists, whenever cohort Lafayette makes a suggestion, that he is in charge; then proceeds to adopt Lafayette's suggestion as his own.\n\nGeorge Lindsey as Lafayette the Basset Hound – a farm dog and Napoleon's companion. He sometimes proves to be smarter than Napoleon, despite Napoleon staunchly insisting that he is the leader of the farm dogs.\n\nHermione Baddeley as Madame Adelaide Bonfamille – a former opera singer and owner of Duchess and her kittens.\n\nCharles Lane as Georges Hautcourt the Lawyer – a senile old man who denies his old age and even refuses to accept Edgar's offer of using the elevator instead of the long staircase, resulting in brief chaos.\n\nNancy Kulp as Frou Frou the Horse – Roquefort's companion and who plays a part in subduing Edgar. Ruth Buzzi provided her uncredited singing voice.\n\nMonica Evans and Carole Shelley as Abigail and Amelia Gabble – twins, geese who find the cats and try to help them get home.\n\nBill Thompson as Uncle Waldo – the drunk uncle of Amelia and Abigail.\n\nUncredited[]\n\nPeter Renaday as French Milkman/Le Petit Cafe Cook/Truck Movers.\n\nGoofs[]\n\nWhen the Alley Cats fight Edgar, Roquefort orders everyone to be quiet while he works on cracking the padlock. Even Edgar stops. This is strange since Madame Adelaide Bonfamille and the other humans can't understand animals. It's especially strange since Edgar can't understand his horse.\n\nIn a few scenes, Roquefort has five fingers instead of four.\n\nAfter Edgar is kicked into the box that he was planning to use to send the cats to Timbuktu, it is shown with the padlock once again locked and sealed on the front, despite the fact that Roquefort had removed the padlock and there had been no time for anyone to put it back on before it was kicked outside.\n\nIn the scene where Edgar is ironing his clothes, he is seen wearing a pair of red-and-white striped boxer shorts. However, since this movie is set in 1910, boxer shorts weren't really invented until 1925 (15 years later).\n\nWhile Roquefort reports to Scat Cat and the gang that O'Malley, Duchess, and the kittens are in trouble, Peppo (the Italian Cat) changes two different locations too quickly.\n\nEdgar refers to the money that he would inherit as \"dollars\" and the American dollar sign flashes in his eyes; however, the film takes place in France.\n\nWhen Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse race each other to their little cat door, they fight over who will go first through the door. When Marie mentions that she's a lady and should go first, it can be seen through the door that it is nighttime. After Toulouse comments she's not a lady, and Berlioz pulling her tail saying she's nothing but a sister, it is once again daytime as seen through the door.\n\nThroughout the film, Hit Cat (guitar) and Billy Boss (bass) play their instruments left and right-handed.\n\nThe basket with Duchess and her kittens Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse falls out from the motorcycle, rolling down the hill while the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are chasing Edgar, the cats aren't seen falling out from the basket themselves when it does, and it doesn't land under the bridge when the chase is going on, but after the fight ends with Edgar driving away and the rainstorm approaching, the basket is suddenly under the bridge, and Duchess sleeping in the tall grass.\n\nBerlioz rides on Frou-Frou's head during the carriage ride, but when they all get home, he thanks her for riding on her back, but he never rode on her back, he rode on her head, so he should've meant to thank her for riding on her head.\n\nWhen the kittens play their train game on the train tracks, they line up in a straight line, Toulouse is the leader in the game Berlioz is the passenger, they all line up together and she lines up standing behind Berlioz in the game. Toulouse says that Marie is the caboose which makes her not so interested and she's suddenly seen standing behind Toulouse in line, as Berlioz briefly disappears in the shot, but as their playing and walking along the train tracks, she's behind Berlioz again.\n\nWhen Berlioz says \"come on Roquefort, have some\" during dinner time, he sounds like Toulouse, meaning he says it in Toulouse's voice. This could be because Gary Dubin took Dean Clark's line by accident, making him voice the wrong kitten.\n\nIn some Aristocats books, Berlioz can sometimes be mistaken as Toulouse, while Toulouse can be mistaken as Berlioz.\n\nRelease and Reception[]\n\nMain article: The Aristocats (video)\n\nThe Aristocats premiered on December 11, 1969 and released in theaters on December 24 that same year. The film was then re-released to theaters on December 19, 1980, and April 10, 1987. Overall, The Aristocats made over $55 million during its original release on a budget of $4 million, making it a box office success. According to an article published by Variety back in 2003, the film made $191 million dollars at the box office.\n\nBased on 29 reviews, the film has a 66% rating at Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6/10 \"fresh\", relatively low for a Disney animated feature, with a consensus of \"Though The Aristocats is mostly a middling effort for Disney, it is redeemed by terrific work from its voice cast and some jazzy tunes.\" Of the reviews, 19 gave it \"fresh\" and 10 gave it \"rotten\".\n\nThe film was nominated for AFI's 10 Top 10 in the \"Animation\" genre.\n\nIt was first released on VHS in the UK in 1995. It was first released on VHS in North America in the Masterpiece Collection series on April 24, 1996, and DVD on April 4, 2000, in the Gold Classic Collection line. The Aristocats had its Gold Collection disc quietly discontinued in 2006. A new single-disc Special Edition DVD (previously announced as a 2-Disc set) was released on February 5, 2008, with the original matted aspect ratio of 1.75:1. The film debuted on Blu-ray on August 7, 2012, this time with a 1.66:1 transfer.\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\n\"The Aristocats\" - Maurice Chevalier \"The Aristocats\" is the title song from the film. It was written by Robert and Richard Sherman at the end of the eight-year tenure working for Walt Disney Productions. Actor and singer Maurice Chevalier came out of retirement to sing this song for the motion picture's soundtrack. He recorded it in English as well as in French translation (\"Naturellement - les Aristocats!\"). It would be his last work before his death in 1972.\n\n\"Scales and Arpeggios\" - Liz English, Gary Dubin, Dean Clark, Robie Lester\n\n\"Thomas O'Malley Cat (song)\" - Phil Harris\n\n\"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\" - Phil Harris, Scatman Crothers, Thurl Ravenscroft, Vito Scotti, Paul Winchell This song is sung by Scatman Crothers as Scat Cat, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley Cat, and Thurl Ravenscroft as Billy Boss the Russian Cat. It was also released as a now rare 45 rpm single, in a version sung only by Phil Harris, which lacks the cartoon voices of the common release. The soundtrack CD released in 1996 contains an edited version of the song. The lines sung by \"Chinese Cat\" voiced by Paul Winchell, now seen as politically incorrect, are removed.\n\n\"She Never Felt Alone\" - Robie Lester\n\n\"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat (reprise)\" - Phil Harris, Scatman Crothers, Thurl Ravenscroft, Vito Scotti, Paul Winchell, Ruth Buzzi, Bill Thompson\n\nOn Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic, this includes \"Thomas O'Malley Cat\" on the purple disc and \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" on the orange disc. On Disney's Greatest Hits, this includes \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" on the red disc.\n\nCancelled sequel[]\n\nThe Aristocats II was supposed to be a direct-to-video sequel to this film. It was scheduled to be released in 2007, but the production was canceled in early 2006 after Disney acquired Pixar and canceled all other planned direct-to-video sequels.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe title \"Aristocats\" is a play on words, combining \"aristocrat\" and \"cat\".\n\nA big question fans have been asking is where is the father of the kittens, it is never confirmed but it is possible that he passed away.\n\nThis is the last movie to end with \"A Walt Disney Production\", and the first of the Walt Disney Animated Classics to open with \"Walt Disney Productions Presents\". This would continue up until The Fox and the Hound in 1981.\n\nRobie Lester, who had done Duchess's singing voice in the film, would also later narrate the Read-Along version of the film.\n\nThe Aristocats, more specifically \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\", was later briefly shown in the live-action remake of 101 Dalmatians, which the puppies ended up watching before switching to Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey.\n\nA deleted scene shows that when the train comes on the bridge, the train derails, and with Marie nearly drowning.\n\nScat Cat was originally written with Louie Armstrong in mind, with his original name being Satchmo Cat. Unfortunately, illness kept Louie from being able to play the character and the character was recast with Scatman Crothers and given the \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\" song replacing the one the Sherman Brothers wrote for Armstrong, \"Le Jazz Hot\".\n\nThe car that Georges drives resembles a 1913 Mercer 35J Raceabout.\n\nShun Gon has caused some controversy in recent years due to his appearance as a Chinese racial stereotype.\n\nThe number of sleeping pills Edgar put in the milk for the cats would likely have killed them in real life.\n\nMarie, Berlioz, and Toulouse have an Uncle Antoine that only appears in the books, but not in the movie.\n\nAlmost all Aristocats characters appear in House of Mouse, the kittens are the only ones that don't appear in the show.\n\nThe song \"She Never Felt Alone\" is supposed to be part of this movie, but it's a deleted song that never happened. However, part of it was recited as spoken dialogue.\n\nThere are no end credits at the end of the movie, but there are beginning credits where the movie begins.\n\nRoquefort is the narrator narrating in Disneyland Records about the movie.\n\nIn Disneyland Records, some of the main characters namely Abigail and Amelia Gabble, Roquefort, Napoleon, and Lafayette got their own voices from the movie, but Duchess and her kittens Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse don't have their original voices. Marie doesn't have her own voice Liz English, Berlioz doesn't have his own voice Dean Clark, Toulouse doesn't have his own voice Gary Dubin, and Duchess doesn't have her old voice Eva Gabor.\n\nAbigail and Amelia mention the French countryside is so beautiful, and say it's like their own countryside in England, they could've been referring to the English countryside from 101 Dalmatians.\n\nMarie, Berlioz, and Toulouse don't have any kitten friends their ages.\n\nToulouse was originally named \"Dopey\" (almost named after one of the dwarves from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) seen from the early storyboards until his name got changed.\n\nMarie is named after Marie Antoinette, Berlioz is named after Hector Berlioz, Toulouse is named after Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and the French city Toulouse.\n\nAs of 2020, the only surviving voice cast left from the original film are Liz \"Louise\" English (Marie), Monica Evans (Abigail Gabble), Roddy Maude-Roxby (Edgar), Ruth Buzzi (Frou-Frou's singing voice), and Dean Clark (Berlioz).
