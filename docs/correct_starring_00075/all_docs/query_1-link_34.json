In the search box, paste the complete case number. If the case number begins with “19” or higher, you must add the prefix SBC to the case number, e.g., SBC [CASE NUMBER]. If a case number begins with 18 or lower, there’s no need to add SBC.\n\nMost public case records since 2000 are available through search. Older case records are available on request. The State Bar Court began posting public discipline documents online in 2005.\n\nNOTE: Only Published Opinions may be cited or relied on as precedent in State Bar Court proceedings.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Any posted Notice of Disciplinary Charges, Conviction Transmittal or other initiating document, contains only allegations of professional misconduct. The licensee is presumed to be innocent of any misconduct warranting discipline until the charges have been proven."
