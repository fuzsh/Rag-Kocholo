        "text": "An enthusiastic audience was just wild about Harry, as well as Gary, in \"When Gary Met Harry: The Music of Harry Warren.\" The delicious cabaret performance was offered by Sterling's Upstairs at the Federal in North Hollywood on Sunday evening, September 28.\n\nTexas-born actor-singer-songwriter Gary Lynn Floyd charmed the crowd in a captivating evening of memorable songs written by legendary show-music tunesmith Harry Warren (1893-1981).\n\nRenowned composer-lyricist Warren, one of the most prolific songwriters in modern American history, was an 11-time Oscar nominee and winner of three (for \"Lullaby of Broadway\" with Al Dubin in 1935, \"You'll Never Know\" with Mack Gordon in 1943, and \"On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe\" with Johnny Mercer in 1946).\n\nWarren is particularly well known for his work with sublime lyricist Dubin on \"42nd Street,\" the granddaddy of movie musical blockbusters, alongside his many other film and stage projects. The 1942 Busby Berkeley film classic \"42nd Street\" eventually found renewed life as a Tony-winning 1980 Broadway musical.\n\nIt's rare to find a cabaret evening exclusively focused on the work of one songwriter, but it didn't take long following Floyd's warm introduction to realize that his silky-smooth crooning is ideally matched to the glorious cavalcade of romantic ballads and jazzy showstoppers in the Warren catalog.\n\nPatter was minimal in the hour-long show, but Floyd's charisma was evident when sharing tidbits of data about Warren and his work, as well as a few details about his own life and career. The focus of the evening was on the glorious music at hand, featuring standards as well as less familiar songs, crooned to perfection in Floyd's intoxicating style.\n\nIt might have been terrific to hear some of the most widely known Warren songs that weren't included here, such as \"Lullaby of Broadway,\" \"We're in the Money\" amid the endless parade of great numbers in the Busby Berkley film \"42nd Street\" and/or its stage adaptation. But those numbers are best suited as ensemble songs, and not ideal for a solo cabaret. Yet Floyd thankfully offered \"42 Street's\" melodic and snappy \"You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me\" and the irresistible ballad \"About a Quarter to Nine,\" which are definite standouts from the classic. Equally sublime was the lush \"I Only Have Eyes For You,\" which Dick Powell sang in the memorable 1933 film, \"Dames.\"\n\nFloyd started the evening in high style with \"Lulu's Back in Town,\" the sassy number that Warren composed, in collaboration with his lyricist Dubin, for the 1935 film, \"Broadway Gondolier.\" Widely associated with Fats Waller and Mel Torme, the durable song also was a recurrent theme in \"Sesame Street\" to great comic effect. Floyd's stylish rendition of the evergreen hit set the mood for the cavalcade of great tunes to follow.\n\nSome of the best known songs by Warren are included, as well as others that will likely be less familiar. Fans of Barbra Streisand's \"Funny Lady\" will be pleased to hear a vintage Warren tune that the diva sang in that film sequel to \"Funny Girl.\" It was Floyd's knockout rendition of the lilting number, \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby.\"\n\nThe evening was further enriched by the efforts of Robbie Gillman on piano, Nicholas DeGaulejac on drums, and Doug LeBow (who also serves as Flynn's co-director) on bass.\n\nIn one segment, Floyd took over the accompaniment altogether, to sing and play piano for one of his own original songs that evokes a Warren style (\"Simple Love Song\"), as well as a selection of some of Warren's memorable romantic ballads: 'You'll Never Know,\" \"The More I See You,\" and the highlight of this group, \"Welcome to the Party.\"\n\nHe also offered a glorious rendition of the terrific \"Serenade in Blue.\" During the bouncy classic \"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby,\" he stepped down from the stage to dance with a friend who was seated in the audience. Due to Floyd's leading-man good looks and endless charm, many other patrons would likely have been pleased to have been selected for that task, which was granted to a lucky pal.\n\nAmong other highlights of the evening were the sprightly \"Zing a Little Zong,\" which is strongly associated with Bing Crosby, \"There Will Never Be Another You,\" \"At Last,\" and \"Shoes With Wings On.\" All in all, it was a terrific evening of excellent food and beverages and irresistible musical entertainment in the company of a stellar entertainer."
