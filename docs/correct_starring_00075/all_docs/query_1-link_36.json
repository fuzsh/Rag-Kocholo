In this case, however, it IS used in the more vulgar sense. The trailer for the film is somewhat gross, but intentionally so, I'm sure. I haven't looked into it, but it appears that both films were comedy shorts with very small budgets. Just a joke that some may find funny. I probably would have 40 years ago.\n\nSarah Ehrett's Lesbian Love Interest\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nOn Friday, October 14, 2016 at 5:17:03 PM UTC-7, Sarah Ehrett wrote:\n\n>\n\n> All you know as a puffer is porn and vulgar slang.\n\n>\n\n> Try looking up \"jizz\" in the OED.\n\nA. The word is fluffer. No wonder why you can't get a job, your resume is effed.\n\nB. Cathy's mom holds all the jizz in her mouth, a sperm bank of sorts. Anytime Cathy needs a new brother or sister, she makes a small withdraw."
