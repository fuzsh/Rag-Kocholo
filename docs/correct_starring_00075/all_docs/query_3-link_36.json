        "text": "The surname Dubin was first found in Provence where this esteemed family has held a family seat since ancient times.\n\nOriginating from the d'Ubaye river region in this province, the family grew and branched to Brittany (French: Bretagne), where members were known as the Dube de la Garenne family, and were noted for their devoted service to the King and for their contributions in their communities. In the middle of the 19th century, members of this family immigrated to the New World, where they flourished and became a notable and large family."
