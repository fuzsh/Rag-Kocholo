        "text": "Jaws 2 star Marc Gilpin has died at the age of 56 after a long battle with cancer. The much-loved actor's sister and Frasier actress Peri Gilpin, announced his tragic death, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe actor passed away in Dallas, Texas, after battling glioblastoma - a fast-growing and aggressive brain tumour. Back in May 2022, a fundraiser was set up to help the actor and his wife Kaki, and well as their two sons as they 'faced the unimaginable' as Marc continued on with his fight.\n\nIn May 2022, it was discovered Marc had two tumors in his brain, one in the central area, meaning it is not able to be surgically removed due to the location.\n\nREAD MORE: Irish musician Donal Lunny's career, family life and relationship with Sinead O'Connor\n\nFour months later, in an update, GoFundMe campaign organiser Kim Parks explained: “The tumor has not grown, shrunk some, and had no new satellites. Neuro Oncologist very encouraged by the response to treatment.“\n\nWith the love of his friends, family and JAWS fans, Marc was determined to face this battle with bravery and dignity, and on his GoFundMe page, hundreds of fans shared messages of hope with the actor, before his sad passing at 56.\n\nWhile Marc's family were already dealing with the heartbreak of cancer during his fight, they were also trying their best to manage their difficult financial issues as his campaign page detailed the family's struggles.\n\nThe page read: \"As if this is not enough for this family of four to endure, they are also dealing with significant financial stress. Recently Marc lost his job along with his company paid insurance plan and has been actively pursuing new employment.\n\n\"Facing this medical crisis, Marc is clearly unable to gain employment at this time. His wife, Kaki, is an elementary school teacher which is the most admirable profession but sadly also very underpaid. Given the current crisis situation they are in, Kaki has had to take FMLA time off of work to navigate all of the doctor appointments, treatments and more. Therefore, her salary is even more reduced during this period.\"\n\nMarc played the younger son of Roy Scheider’s Police Chief Martin Brody in Jaws 2 in 1978. After answering a casting call, the young talent, beat hundreds of other boys to get hired as Sean Brody in the sequel to the blockbuster Jaws, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. He was 11 when the movie reached theaters.\n\nIN 1979, Marc was on NBC’s CHiPs and appeared with his younger sister, April, on ABC’s Fantasy Island before he went on to star in The Legend of the Long Ranger and Earthbound two years later.\n\nAfter working on NBC’s Silver Spoons and ABC’s China Beach and in the 1989 movie She’s Out of Control, Gilpin left the acting world and became a software engineer. Marc worked for a start-up company and another firm where he earned several software patents, his family said.\n\nMarc’s survivors include his wife of 24 years, Kaki, and sons Spencer, 18, and Presley, 16."
