My dad lost his brother to cancer a few months ago (maybe close to a year now?), and I wasn't really close with that uncle, but it's always sad when someone is taken from us be it via cancer suffering, or other illnesses. May he (the late Gary, and of course my late uncle) rest in peace, and I also extend my condolences to his family. I really hope they can get through this as well."
