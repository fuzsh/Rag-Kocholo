        "text": "Marc Gilpin, the actor best known for his portrayal as Sean Brody in \"Jaws 2,\" has died, according to his sister, actress Peri Gilpin.\n\nMarc Gilpin had been battling cancer and passed away in Dallas on Saturday. He was 56. Peri Gilpin remembered her brother's strong relationship with his wife Kaki in a touching tribute penned on Instagram.\n\n\"Kaki and Marc took care of each other with kindness, strength, dignity and invaluable humor,\" she wrote. \"When Marc became ill, Kaki and their boys surrounded Marc with love, hugs, and round the clock support and care.\n\nSTARS WE'VE LOST IN 2023\n\nAPP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW INSTAGRAM\n\n\"I just want to say how much I admire Kaki as a wife, mom, first grade teacher, sister and sister-in-law and undaunted caregiver. You are an amazing person Kaki and its so easy to see how much he has always loved you and always will.\"\n\nGilpin originally announced her brother's death to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMarc Gilpin portrayed the younger son of Roy Scheider's Police Chief Martin Brody in the movie, having beat out hundreds of young actors to secure the role in the 1978 film.\n\nHe did not have a lengthy career in Hollywood, only tallying 15 acting credits to his name.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nOther notable appearances included a role with his younger sister April, who passed away in 2017, on the television program \"Fantasy Island\" in 1979 and roles in the films \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\" and \"Earthbound,\" both in 1981.\n\nIn 1985, he starred alongside Molly Ringwald and the late River Phoenix in the TV movie \"Surviving.\"\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, after garnering attention from that performance, Marc Gilpin was sought after by manager Jerry Silverhardt while he was visiting Peri in Massachusetts. He agreed to the signing â€” only if Peri was included as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPeri Gilpin found success in the role of Roz Doyle on Kelsey Grammer's hit show \"Frasier\" in the 1990s and early 2000s. She is set to reprise her role in the upcoming \"Frasier\" reboot on Paramount+.\n\nMeanwhile, Marc later reunited with Scheider on the series \"Silver Spoons.\"\n\nHis last acting credit was in 1989.
