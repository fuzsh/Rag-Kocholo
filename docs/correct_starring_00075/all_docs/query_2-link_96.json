Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEleanor Audley voiced not one, but two iconic Disney villains.\n\nLady Tremaine from \"Cinderella\" and Maleficent (\"Sleeping Beauty\") were both voiced by Audley. \"Cinderella\" was one of Audley's first roles before she played Eunice Douglas on \"Green Acres.\"\n\nIf you've been to Disney World or Disneyland, Audley also voiced Madame Leota on the Haunted Mansion ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe voice of Winnie the Pooh is also the man behind Darkwing Duck, Chief Pohawtan, and one of the hyenas from \"The Lion King.\"\n\nThose are just a handful of the many animated roles the versatile Jim Cummings has voiced over the years. You may also recognize him as Ray from \"The Princess and the Frog,\" Razoul in \"Aladdin,\" Goofy's neighbor Pete, and Hondo Ohnaka in \"The Clone Wars\" animated series.\n\nMost impressive is how seamlessly Cummings can slip from one role into another. You can see Cummings go from character to character using Darkwing Duck's famous catchphrase, \"Let's Get Dangerous,\" here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCogsworth in \"Beauty and the Beast\" is also the main villain in \"Pocahontas.\"\n\n\"M*A*S*H\" star David Ogden Stiers is also the narrator in \"Beauty and the Beast\" and Jumba in \"Lilo & Stitch.\"\n\nMax from \"A Goofy Movie\" is also the same voice of Kovu from \"The Lion King\" sequel.\n\nJason Marsden has voiced a lot of characters you may be familiar with ranging from Mungo on \"Tarzan\" and Haku in \"Spirited Away\" to Kid Flash on DC's animated \"Young Justice\" series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Jay has voiced three Disney villains.\n\nFrollo from \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and Monsieur D'Arque (\"Beauty and the Beast\"), who attempts to take Belle's father to an asylum, are both voiced by Tony Jay. Jay also voiced Shere Khan on the \"Talespin\" TV series.\n\nIf the voice of the Old Man in \"The Emperor's New Groove\" sounded familiar, it's because it's the same voice behind Piglet.\n\nJohn Fielder has been voicing Piglet since the late '60s. Before he died in 2005, he lent his voice to the small, but memorable role in \"The Emperor's New Groove.\" If you can't place the character, he's the one who throws off the Emperor's groove and then warns Pacha not to do the same. You can watch the moment here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScrooge McDuck shares a voice with Hiram Flaversham.\n\nAlan Young voiced Scrooge one time before the release of Disney's \"Sherlock Holmes\" adaptation.\n\nHe continued to provide the voice for Uncle Scrooge until his death in 2016. David Tennant now voices the character on the rebooted \"Ducktales\" series.\n\nIf you recently watched \"Fox and the Hound,\" you may have thought you heard Boomer's voice before.\n\nPaul Winchell voiced both characters. You may also recognize him as the voice of Gargamel from \"The Smurfs.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWillow Tweed is also the voice of Ellie Mae in \"The Rescuers.\"\n\nJeanette Nolan voiced Tod's adoptive mother and the leader of the Swamp Folks.\n\nPacha (\"The Emperor's New Groove\") is also the same voice of Sully in \"Monsters, Inc.\"\n\nJohn Goodman voices the lovable monster who helps get Boo home safely and the man who helps Emperor Kuzco open his heart to his community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaa the Snake is the same voice as the Cheshire cat and Bambi's skunk friend Flower.\n\nBefore Cummings, Sterling Holloway was the original voice of Winnie the Pooh on \"The Magical World of Disney\" and in 1977's \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.\"\n\nJohn Ratzenberger appears in every Pixar movie.\n\nAmong the many characters that Ratzenberger has voiced are Hamm (\"Toy Story\"), the Underminer (\"The Incredibles\"), Mack (\"Cars\"), and the Yeti in \"Monsters, Inc.\" You can see many of his roles here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuke Weaselton and the Duke of Weselton are one and the same. Alan Tudyk voices them both along with the \"Wreck-It Ralph\" villain.\n\nAlan Tudyk is quickly becoming a man of many voices in Disney Animation. In addition to voicing characters in \"Zootopia\" and \"Frozen,\" you may also recognize him as the voice of KnowsMore in \"Wreck-It Ralph 2\" and Heihei in \"Moana.\" He's also K-2SO in \"Rogue One.\"\n\nOutside of Disney, Tudyk voices several characters, including the Joker, on DC Universe's \"Harley Quinn\" animated series.\n\nBaloo and Little John don't just look similar. They're also voiced by the same actor.\n\nBetween both movies, Phil Harris brought Thomas O'Malley, the alley cat, to life in \"The Aristocats.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leading lady of \"Robin Hood\" was also one of the geese in \"The Aristocats.\"\n\nMaid Marian and Abigail the goose were both voiced by Monica Evans.\n\nA fun fact is that Carole Shelley played Marian's friend Lady Kluck in \"Robin Hood\" and Abigail's sister, Amelia. Both of those characters wore baby blue.\n\nThe Nanny in \"101 Dalmatians\" is also Madam Mim in \"The Sword in the Stone.\"\n\nMartha Wentworth voiced a few characters in \"101 Dalmatians,\" including Lucy the Goose and Queenie the cow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sheriff of Nottingham in \"Robin Hood\" is also the voice of Chief in \"Fox and the Hound.\"\n\nPat Buttram also voiced Napoleon in \"The Aristocats.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames MacDonald voiced a few Disney mice.\n\nMacDonald brought Cinderella's pals Jaq and Gus to life along with the Dormouse in \"Alice in Wonderland.\"\n\nHe's also credited as doing the sounds for many different animals in Disney movies, including the growls of the bear in \"Fox and the Hound\" and the roars for Shere Khan and Bagheera in \"The Jungle Book.\" He also provided the roars for Maleficent (\"Sleeping Beauty\") in dragon form and Elliott in 1977's \"Pete's Dragon.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKathryn Beaumont voiced both Alice and Wendy Darling.\n\nMore recently, Beaumont voiced Kairi's grandmother in one of Disney's \"Kingdom Hearts\" video games. Her voice was also used for Alice and Wendy in the franchise's first game.\n\nThe voice of Kanga in \"Winnie the Pooh\" is also the main character from \"Lady and the Tramp\" and one of Aurora's fairy godmothers.\n\nBarbara Luddy voiced the spunky Merryweather in \"Sleeping Beauty\" and Lady from \"Lady and the Tramp.\" She most recently voiced Kanga in 2011 for the \"Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAunt Sarah, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, and The Queen of Hearts are all voiced by Verna Felton.\n\nThose aren't the only Disney roles Felton performed. She was also the voice of both Flora and Queen Leah in \"Sleeping Beauty\" and an elephant in \"The Jungle Book.\"\n\nMr. Smee shares the same voice as the White Rabbit from \"Alice in Wonderland\" and Jock from \"Lady and the Tramp.\"\n\nThompson also voiced the Dodo in \"Alice in Wonderland,\" some of the pirates in \"Peter Pan,\" King Hubert in \"Sleeping Beauty,\" and was drunken Uncle Waldo in \"The Aristocats.\"\n\nRead next\n\nDisney Movie\n\nAdvertisement"
