He (Mike Lookinland) seems to most normal (in a good way) now.\n\nPeter revealed an unattractive side to himself when she got married and went on \"My Fair Brady.\"\n\nLeast favorite, then and now: Cindy (Susan Olson). Ugh!\n\nby Anonymousreply 4\n\nI wanted to dirty unspeakable things to Peter, but no I did not want to be Marcia, and I couldn't stand Greg, them trying to turn Greg into a sex symbol was hilarious.\n\nby Anonymousreply 5\n\nGreg made me feel funny down there.\n\nby Anonymousreply 8\n\nBarry had a nice lean build. Do you think Robert Reed went back to his Hawaiian hotel and rubbed one out after they filmed the surfing scenes?\n\nby Anonymousreply 9\n\n[quote] Do you think Robert Reed went back to his Hawaiian hotel and rubbed one out after they filmed the surfing scenes?\n\nNo, I do not. Why would Robert Reed perv on a straight high school aged boy? Just because he was gay?

I forgot all about her.\n\nby Anonymousreply 13\n\nr10 unclench. do you know where you are? r9 I thought the same thing, but about Peter, when I saw a picture of them from their variety show. Chris posted it on his Instagram.\n\nby Anonymousreply 14\n\nWhen my cousins and I were little we used to play Brady Bunch. I was Bobby because I was the third oldest boy. I told my younger cousin that he had to be Oliver and he burst into tears and ran to his mother.\n\nby Anonymousreply 15\n\nPeter - cutest one - then and now!\n\nby Anonymousreply 16\n\n[quote] Do you think Robert Reed went back to his Hawaiian hotel and rubbed one out after they filmed the surfing scenes?\n\nActually I think Florence Henderson was more likely to do that.\n\nOffsite Link\n\nby Anonymousreply 17\n\nLOL I feel vindicated. I voted for Peter having no idea he'd be the clear favorite. I thought he was the most sensible of the bunch...and the funniest.\n\nby Anonymousreply 18\n\nI didn't win! Nora Coombs won!\n\nby Anonymousreply 19\n\nI had a crush on Peter when I watched the show in reruns as a kid around age 7. But Marcia was clearly the star. Christine Taylor was amazing as Marcia in the spoof movies.\n\nby Anonymousreply 20\n\nI voted for Peter because he looked very much like my college roommate whom I sucked off many times.\n\nby Anonymousreply 21\n\nPeter was cute as a kid but I like him beefier now. However, he comes across as a drunk, right? Did Christopher Knight show any ass in his My Fair Brady?\n\nby Anonymousreply 24\n\nChristopher Knight has a furniture company. Meghan, Harry, and Oprah used his chairs in the big interview earlier this year.\n\nby Anonymousreply 25\n\nI still want to be Marcia. She was the perfect teenager.\n\nby Anonymousreply 26\n\nSorry. Peter broke all sorts of privacy laws when he stuck that raggedy-ass reel-to-reel tape deck under his sister's bed. He needs to be locked up!\n\nby Anonymousreply 27\n\nYou're always asking for my comment, well here it is - none of them!\n\nby Anonymousreply 28\n\nI had a crush on Peter but I also felt a kinship with Jan. I don't like \"perfect teenagers\" who can do no wrong...talk about unrealistic.\n\nby Anonymousreply 29\n\nPeter was hot in the last season and had a great ass.\n\nby Anonymousreply 30\n\nI was VERY young, but was obviously attracted to Peter. One of the first clues...\n\nJan was my absolute favorite in the Brady Bunch movies.\n\nby Anonymousreply 32\n\nI would like to see Florence Henderson and Vivian Vance install a shower.....\n\nby Anonymousreply 33\n\nMarcia got my vote.\n\nNone of the Brady boys were ever cute.\n\nby Anonymousreply 36\n\nPeter was too cute! He had a great smile. My little gay boy self was drawn to him for reasons I didnât understand at the time.\n\nby Anonymousreply 37\n\nMarcia wasn't perfect on the actual show. They just caricatured her that way for the movies. On the actual show, she was as tortured as Jan, although she had different kinds of problems.\n\nby Anonymousreply 39\n\nYea.....like trying to learn Shakespeare.....word for word.....\n\nby Anonymousreply 40\n\nYeah... like having to choose between the handsome star quarterback or the handsome class president to be her prom date.\n\nby Anonymousreply 41\n\n^ Just how old *is\" Eric Stolz?\n\nby Anonymousreply 43\n\nBobby, are you not wearing any underwear?\n\nOffsite Link\n\nby Anonymousreply 44\n\nWow, Bobby could take TWO hands?!\n\nby Anonymousreply 45\n\nThupid Thindy with her pigtails and lisp was always the butt of the jokes. No wonder Susan Olsen grew up to be a lunatic Trumpanzee.\n\nPeter was my fave, with Jan a close second. I feel kinship with the middle child.\n\nby Anonymousreply 47\n\nPeter really was the cutest. I think he was a sexual awakening for many gay kids. He ended up aging very well.\n\nCindy was the worst. Then and now.\n\nby Anonymousreply 48\n\nGreg, for the simple reason that he admitted to filming this scene while stoned. You can clearly see the stoned-face grin on his face for most of it, as well as him tripping over the bicycle pump, and then when Cindy says something clearly to his right, he first turns to the left to face her. LOL! I love this scene.\n\nOffsite Link\n\nby Anonymousreply 49\n\nIâd love a job I could do stoned.\n\nby Anonymousreply 50\n\nPeter did have a little \"glow-up\" at the end of the series; Jan, too. Also, r15's story made me laugh for a good minute.\n\nAnyway, I pick Wayne.\n\nby Anonymousreply 51\n\nCindy Brady has not aged well.\n\nOffsite Link\n\nby Anonymousreply 52\n\nIs this poll according to looks or their character on the show?\n\nI don't recall many stand-out episodes that centered around Peter. Marcia and Jan got all the good storylines.\n\nby Anonymousreply 53\n\n[quote] Marcia wasn't perfect on the actual show.\n\nShe was kind of perfect in the actual show. IIRC, Christopher Knight (Peter) said he liked the football scene (\"Oh, my nose!\") because Maureen (Marcia) was insufferable, at times.\n\nOffsite Link\n\nby Anonymousreply 55\n\n[quote] Thupid Thindy with her pigtails and lisp was always the butt of the jokes.\n\nThatsh jusht shad. Spheesh impedimentsh are a sherioush isshue and shouldn't be shubject to shnark. I think Shindy wash marvelush! And sho wash Shushan Olshen!\n\nby Anonymousreply 56\n\n[quote] Iâd love a job I could do stoned.\n\nGo get a government job. Or be a porn star. Similar training.\n\nby Anonymousreply 57\n\nBarry / Greg did look stoned in that clip. He was holding onto the car as if for support.\n\nby Anonymousreply 58\n\nChris Knight never said Maureen McCormick was insufferable. He said that he was the most typically boyish of the three boys and she was the most girlish of the three girls. He and Mike L hung out in set and were good friends. Barry was older and not into kid stuff.\n\nHitting his sister with a football accidentally could have been the kind of thing Chris did in real life. He also teased Maureen a lot but they were friends. The writers built his real personality into the character of Peter\n\nHe and Maureen used to carpool together to work with their mothers every day for years.\n\nby Anonymousreply 59\n\nThey also recorded an album together.\n\nby Anonymousreply 60\n\nI would probably have been friends with Bobby since we're the same age but I definitely would have had a crush on Peter.\n\nby Anonymousreply 61\n\nIf you include the Brady Bunch remakes itâs Jan by a mile.\n\nby Anonymousreply 62\n\noooh... look at the start of a treasure trail for Peter Brady in R63's pic just below the navel... my, my, my - what does following it down promise?\n\nYea, I sound like a dirty old man.\n\nby Anonymousreply 64\n\nThere was an actor in Jaws 2 who gets killed that looked a lot like Christopher Knight\n\nby Anonymousreply 65\n\nR65 That was Gary Dubin.

I've kept up my subscription.\n\nby Anonymousreply 67\n\n[quote] That was Gary Dubin.

I wanted to grab Cindy by the hair and sling her out the window.\n\nby Anonymousreply 69\n\nR63 - Peter's milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.\n\nby Anonymousreply 70\n\nGreg...he got hot as he got older...\n\nThose Hawaii episodes...Damn!\n\nby Anonymousreply 71\n\nThin lips are never attractive.\n\nby Anonymousreply 72\n\nI wonder which of the boys Robert Reed had eyes for.\n\nby Anonymousreply 73\n\n[quote] Thin lips are never attractive.\n\nTrue. Both Peter and Bobby had thin-lipped, gummy smiles which were a complete turn off.\n\nby Anonymousreply 74\n\nBobby knew how to please a man.\n\nby Anonymousreply 75\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3TmqOorZ6csm%2BvzqZmraCimq6le5Fya3BwYGeAbsPHqGSwmaNixrDB0Wadmq6fp7a1sYybqZqcqWK4qrCM"
