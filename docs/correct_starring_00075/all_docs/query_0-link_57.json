        "text": "Disney’s Awesome Things #13: Patting the Bat Heads in the Haunted Mansion Queue\n\n#13It’s no secret that the Haunted Mansion is one of my favorite rides. It’s probable safe to say I’m a tad obsessed (in a non-spiritual way) with it. One of the biggest reasons I love it is it’s detailed theming.\n\nIn the queue, one of the hardest pieces of Disney’s mastery of details are the bat heads that connect the ropes lining the indoor queue.\n\nEvery time I pass those smooth, cold, metallic bats, I must pat their head. It’s an urge I get that I just can’t resist. They play such a small roll in the major picture, yet without them, the mansion would loose just a bit of the “haunted” feel.\n\nDo you like those bats – or have you even noticed them before?\n\nYou should follow me on Twitter.\n\nPhoto by Joe P.\n\nDisney’s Awesome Things #12: The Bilingual Ride Safety Spiels\n\n#12 I think it’s fair to say that I’m completely obsessed with the Disney ride safety spiels – it’s always one of the main things I look forward to hearing when I arrive. When I hear it, I know I’m in Disney.\n\nThe Spanish parts are always my favorite, mainly because I find Spanish very interesting and actually know what they are saying. Look below for some Spanish spiels – as you might have not known what the words look like written out.\n\nI find it amazing and extremely interesting that Disney somehow finds a way to take a generic safety spiel in English and Spanish and transform it – making it fit the theme of the current attraction. How clever is that?\n\nHere’s some examples:\n\nAnd now, a carriage approaches – taking you into the boundless realm of the supernatural. Once on board, remain safely seated with your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside. And, watch your children…please.\n\nUn carruaje que se a se. Y ahora: permanezca sentado y mantengo las manos, brazos, pies, y piernas dentro de vehiculo. Y cuida los pequeñitos. ¡Y ahora – preparase!\n\nOr maybe this one:\n\nAhoy, mateys! For your safety, remain seated with yer hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the boat. And no flash pictures. Prepare to make sail!\n\nPara su seguridad, permanezca sentado con las manos, brazos, pies, y piernas dentro el barco. Y cuida sus niños. ¡Muchas gracias!\n\nOr my personal favorite:\n\nAttention, Expedition Everest team members, once on board, secure all gear in the cargo pouch in front of you – then, pull down on the restraint. For your safety, remain seated and keep your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the train – and watch your children.\n\n¡Atención los miembros del equipo de Expedición Everest! Una vez a bordo, asegurar todas las artes en la sección de carga frente a usted. Entonces, baje el cinturón de seguridad. Para su seguridad, permanezca sentado con las manos, brazos, pies, y piernas dentro el tren. Y cuida los ninos. Gracias.\n\nAm I weird for liking the safety spiels? Which one is your favorite? Should this even make the Awesome Things list? Let me know!\n\nYou should follow me on Twitter.\n\nThinking of Disney as a Brand – Not Just a Place\n\nWhen some of us hear the word “Disney” mentioned, the first thing we think of is Disney theme parks. In fact I think sometimes we get so carried away with the whole Disney World bit that we forget Disney is just another brand out there. And so far, they have quite a reputable one – most of the time.\n\nA comment posted by I. Watt on the Disney from an Outside Perspective article a while back gave me better insight into this. Here’s what he said:\n\nMy experience in attempting to organize a family vacation to WDW has been rather negative! I can’t believe that WDW can’t afford a universal toll-free phone for potential customer queries! After being on the line for 5 minutes and answering a multitude of questions I was informed that I was put in line for the next available “agent” which would be about 10 minutes!\n\nI tried email to get a response to my questions re dining plans and I’m still waiting any kind of reply other than the universal “thank you for your query..we’ll be in touch” (5 days and counting!)\n\nI’m totally surprised that an organization with such a sterling reputation for customer service can operate in such a shoddy manner! Communication appears to be a major problem area for WDW. Trip is now on hold for time being.\n\nThis is intriguing to me. Mainly because I usually don’t think of Disney World as a brand. I’m always so excited and pumped to even be booking or planning a vacation there that I forget about the whole customer service aspect of things.\n\nSure we all have negative experiences on the phone or in the parks of Disney, but we overlook it. Why? Because we have seen too many happy cast members and pleasant phone operators to let a few mishaps dim out the good. But newcomers like I. Watt haven’t.\n\nEach phone call, each cast member, and each thing relating to the Disney brand could always be someone’s first interaction with Disney – which means they will quickly formulate their first impression. Now Disney needs to concentrate on making each interaction a pleasant one.\n\nI would love to hear what you all have to say about this – have you had bad experiences with the Disney brand? Share your thoughts on this topic in the comments.\n\nYou should follow me on Twitter here."
