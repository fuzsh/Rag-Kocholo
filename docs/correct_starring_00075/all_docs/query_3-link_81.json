        "text": "DALLAS, TEXAS: Marc Gilpin, best known for his role as the younger son of Roy Scheider's Police Chief Martin Brody in the 1978 film 'Jaws 2' has died at the age of 56 on Saturday, July 29, after a long battle with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. His sister, Peri Gilpin, who starred in the sitcom 'Frasier', confirmed the sad news of her brother's death to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMarc's fight against cancer was well-known, as in May 2022, a fundraiser was organized to support him, his wife Kaki, and their children as they faced the challenges due to his illness. It was discovered that the actor had two brain tumors, and unfortunately, one of them was in a location that made surgical removal impossible.\n\nMarc Gilpin and his family were under financial stress\n\nAlongside the challenging health battle of Marc, the family also had to cope with financial difficulties. The former child actor had also lost his job, which further added to the strain. Moreover, his wife, Kaki, who worked as an elementary school teacher, had to make the difficult decision to give up her job to care for him. On the GoFundMe page, the organizer, Kim Parks, shared some encouraging news about Marc Gilpin's treatment in May, stating that the tumor had not grown and had even shrunk somewhat, with no new satellites. The Neuro Oncologist was very encouraged by the response to the treatment. The page continued to receive kind words of support and donations until the week of his death.\n\nMarc Gilpin's journey in Hollywood\n\nMarc's acting journey began with an impressive feat, beating numerous other child actors to secure the role of Sean Brody, the chief's son, in 'Jaws 2'. The film became an instant hit when Marc was just 11 years old. At a tender age, he got to work alongside Roy Scheider and Lorraine Gary, who played the roles of his on-screen parents, and Mark Gruner played his older brother, Michael.\n\nFollowing 'Jaws 2', Marc appeared on NBC's 'CHiPs' and ABC's 'Fantasy Island', where he shared the screen with his younger sister, April. He continued to pursue acting with roles in 'The Legend of the Lone Ranger' and 'Earthbound' as well as appearances on NBC's 'Silver Spoons', and ABC's 'China Beach'. He also starred in the film 'She's Out of Control'. Eventually, he transitioned away from acting to pursue his career as a software engineer, contributing significantly and earning several software patents while working for start-up companies and other firms.\n\nMarc is survived by his wife of 24 years, Kaki, and their sons, Spencer,18, and Presley,16. His passing marks a somber moment for those who admired his talent and contributions to the entertainment industry and the technology sector."
