        "text": "A little corny, but a lot of fun!\n\nAlthough the mucic (lots of jazz- \"Everybody Wants to be a Cat\"), catch phrases (swinger, hip cat, scat cats) and some of the graphics in the animation (tie dye psychadelic backgrounds during the music) are terribly dated to the 1970's- the decade in which this film was created- this masterpiece remains a fun watch for all ages. The cats are charming (if not a bit corny in spots), the songs are catchy and the villian is not too scary. The voice of Duchess, the mother cat, is provided by Eva Gabor and she is just so soft spoken and lady like. These qualities totally come accross in the mother cat. Madame Adelaide, a glamourous and retired opera singer, treasures her cats beyond anything in her vast fortune and wants to ensure they are well cared for after her death. But when she wills her fortune to THEM before her faithful servant, Edgar, he vows to make the cats \"disappear\" once and for all by dumping them in the French countryside. The unsuspecting Duchess(mother cat) and her 3 kittens slowly make their way back home with the help of Thomas O'Malley, a friendly the alley cat and some other animal friends. But will Edgar be able to prevent thier return?Read full review\n\nGreat for Jazzy Nights\n\nGreat jazz music, cute kittens, action, humor, and a happy ending--what more could kids want in a movie? The villian is the butler--he's not too scary, as in some Disney movies. He shows that greed is destructive and and bad guys don't win in the end. There is little violence--he gets shipped off in a trunk and the cats are safe. Two dogs, Bonaparte and Napoleon are worth mention too because their action scenes display great animation technique. The movie is funny. The kittens make it home and their Mom meets a Tom cat, too. My kids watch this movie often. It is a good movie for evenings because it moves quickly without dragging but it doesn't get them all wound up.\n\nAristocats\n\nA Disney classic that is not a block-buster nor one of its most beloved of all-time movies. It has personal sentimental value to my family. We had the plush kittens we bought at Disneyland and like the slight unfamiliarity of it, and the general sweetness of it. Madame loves her pets; they love her and even the villain is really not all that bad by today's standards. There is no killing, no death, no horrible sadistic witch, or deadly forest fires or evil stepparents or people doing each other in. It is not tense and scary, no loud sensational effects like giant whales or expanding evil maharajas, and shows some simple etiquette that is sadly lacking by many parents today. We just like it. Are there other Disney movies we like better? Sure, but they are so force-fed and well known that it's nice to relax to a gentler movie. Perfect for little ones. Refreshing.Read full review"
