        "text": "Irish Repertory Theatre has revealed casting for their upcoming run of Brian Friel's Aristocrats, the second in their Friel Project series. Continuing through May 2024, the project will see the Off-Broadway company presenting three of Friel's plays, all set in the fictional Irish town of Ballybeg. Aristocats, beginning previews January 11, 2024 ahead of a January 21 opening night, is the second in the series. The run will continue through March 3.\n\nStarring will be Roger Dominic Casey (Bent), Meg Hennessy (London Assurance), Tom Holcomb (Meet Me in St Louis), Colin Lane (Three Small Irish Masterpieces), Shane McNaughton (The 8th), Tim Ruddy (A Touch of the Poet), Danielle Ryan (The Cordelia Dream), and Sarah Street (Belfast Girls).\n\nAristocats centers on Ballybeg Hall, the decaying home of District Justice O'Donnell. The family comes to congregate for a wedding, only to end up staying for a funeral. Irish Rep previously presented the work in 2009.\n\nIrish Rep Artistic Director Charlotte Moore is helming the revival, which will feature scenic design by Charlie Corcoran, costume design by David Toser, lighting design by Michael Gottlieb, sound design and original muisc by Ryan Rumery and M. Florian Staab, and properties by Nicole Rozanski. Pamela Brusoski is production stage manager and Rebecca C. Monroe is stage manager.\n\nThe company began their Friel Project with Translations, currently performing through December 31; and will conclude it with Philadelphia, Here I Come! next year."
