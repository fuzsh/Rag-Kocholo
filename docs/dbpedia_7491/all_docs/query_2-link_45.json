        "text": "A recent study (1) published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), entitled, âRacism, Not Race, Drives Inequality Across the COVID-19 Continuum,â the authors make the case that societal factors have caused many of the COVID-19 deaths in underprivileged communities. They compare and contrast two studies (2, 3), one in Bronx, NY, and the other in Milwaukee, WI, which concluded that that disparities in housing, education, economic opportunity, and savings account for most if not all of the differences in the 2.5 to 4.5 times higher death rates among African American, Hispanic, and Native American populations compared to white populations. The authors make a case for the need to conduct focused studies on the effects of poverty and lack of opportunity on disease outcomes.\n\nScientists have yet to understand the divergence in the pathology of disease among the poor compared with the more privileged. At its core is a simple question: âHow does poverty, food insecurity, exposure to physically unsafe environments, etc., bring about the immunological changes that are key to the disease pathway seen in COVID-19?â An answer to this question not only would help us do a better job of predicting and managing infectious diseases in the most vulnerable but can also inform potential new therapies that can benefit everyone.\n\nCOVID-19 has claimed more than 600,000 lives in the U.S. so far. A better biological understanding is needed of how and why the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections vary so greatly between sub-populations, even those living in close proximity to each another, for example East Palo Alto vs. Palo Alto or Hunters Point vs. Twin Peaks in San Francisco.\n\nThe answer, to some degree, may rest in epigenetics, an emerging area of research focused on the regulation of genes via structural changes in chromosomes which change the accessibility of regulatory transcription factors to those genes. DNA and protein modifications, such as DNA methylation, lead to these structural changes after environmental stressors are experienced, and those changes are now known to be passed down through multiple generations. Conditions as wide-ranging as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), severe anxiety, cancer, and autoimmune diseases have been directly linked to epigenetic changes. Epigenetic modifications may be cell-type-specific. Though it is clear that multiple types of stressors lead to epigenetic changes in both germ line and somatic cells (4-6), the pathways affected by those stressors are still being elucidated. Pathways that, when overstimulated in some people, lead to PTSD, major depressive disorders, and other systemic effects including dysfunctional immune response.\n\nEvidence is also mounting on the role that epigenetics may play on how opportunistic pathogens can evade the immune system. This is especially important during the initial, critical stage of infection when early expression of molecules such as interferon can lead to a mild form of viral disease vs. a life-threatening inflammatory response when viral infection is detected late. Given the differences in severe vs. mild/sub-clinical infections, as well as the vast disparities in who becomes infected and who dies, a better understanding of the socio-economic factors that affect these differences is vital not only for this pandemic, but also for future threats to public health and the nationâs health security.\n\nAs we have observed with the multiple failures of genome-wide association studies (7) and the emerging fields of epigenetics, it is clear that what is needed is an unbiased, epigenetically based survey of survivors and the deceased, as well as those who suffer from long-haul COVID-19 vs. those who developed an acute but quickly resolved infection. Additionally, given the vast differences in the microbiota resultant from diet, exercise, and environment, as well as stressors (especially those that do not show up as PTSD, anxiety, or depression) which have an effect on gene expression, studies seeking this understanding must take such factors as gut microbiome composition into account when designing their methodologies. As multiple studies have linked gut microbiota to changes in neural (8) and immune gene expression patterns (9), epigenetic studies will help us understand the proclivity of changes in gene expression caused by microbial populations and vice-versa, as they are doing now for obesity (10). Such studies will do much to inform our understanding of healthy immune and neurological responses as they relate to the gut microbiome.\n\nThe answer, to some degree, may rest in epigenetics, an emerging area of research focused on the regulation of genes via structural changes in chromosomes which change the accessibility of regulatory transcription factors to those genes.

Published 2020 Jan 15. doi:10.3389/fgene.2019.01329\n\nBARDA is collaborating with Partner Therapeutics (PTx) to advance a new diagnostic approach to stratify sepsis patients who are most likely to benefit from PTxâs U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic, Leukine (sargramostim) and potentially aid in precision medicine for these patients. Through the advancement of a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) for the biomarker monocyte HLA-DR (Human Leukocyte Antigen â DR isotype), PTx will be able to identify sepsis patients exhibiting an immune suppressed, or immunoparalysis (IP), state and clinically evaluate Leukine as a therapy in these individuals.\n\nSepsis is a life-threatening complication of an infection that occurs when the body has an extreme host response, potentially leading to organ failure and death. While some sepsis patients present with severe, systemic inflammation, a subset of patients present or transition to an immune suppressed IP stage. This diversity, or patient heterogeneity, presents significant challenges for effective treatment approaches.\n\nAlthough therapeutics that help modulate the immune system may be an effective approach to restore immune balance in IP sepsis patients, there are currently no approved FDA therapeutics nor companion diagnostic approaches that effectively identifies patients who could benefit from such treatment.\n\nrThe partnership will leverage Partner Therapeuticsâ prior experience developing Leukine for Acute Radiation Syndrome, an FDA-approved indication, as well as current clinical research for use of Leukine in patients with a variety of immunosuppressed conditions. Use of Leukine in sepsis patients could expand the indication of this therapeutic. In addition, the measurement of monocyte HLA-DR levels will enable an endotyping approach (identification via associated biomarkers) to determine if clinical outcomes can be improved through such a stratification approach. This assay, if successful, has the potential to endotype sepsis patients and enable targeted clinical management.\n\nThe contract award supports development of a quantitative flow cytometric LDT able to detect HLA-DR protein on monocyte immune cells to identify patients in an IP state. The award supports initial development of the HLA-DR LDT and facilitates subsequent validation studies in adult and pediatric sepsis clinical trials. Partner Therapeutics also will collaborate with a partner to initiate transition of the HLA-DR LDT to a commercial product and support Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling activities for the Sepsis indication of Leukine with the companion diagnostic.\n\nIf successful, development of the HLA-DR companion diagnostic would address the clinical need to match therapeutics to the appropriate patient population to maximize clinical outcomes. This matching approach, also known as precision medicine, has tremendous potential to impact clinical management and improve patient outcomes. Further development of the HLA-DR based endotyping technology may enable expanded treatment options for hospitalized sepsis patients.\n\nThis contract award is one component of DRIVeâs expanding portfolio.

BARDA and MediciNova, Inc. have partnered to repurpose MN-166 (ibudilast) for potential use against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury associated with chlorine exposure. Repurposing MN-166 as an MCM for treatment after either accidental or intentional exposure to chlorine could help to improve patient health outcomes and save lives following exposure. Under the Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) program, Repurposing Drugs in Response to Chemical Threats (ReDIRECT), BARDA will provide funding for proof-of-concept studies of MN-166 in preclinical models of chlorine-associated lung injury.\n\nMN-166 is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4 and other inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor. The anti-inflammatory effects of MN-166 and its reduction of pulmonary edema (swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the bodyâs tissues) in preclinical ARDS mouse model studies present a compelling case for further investigation in models of chlorine-induced lung injury. MN-166 is the first compound to receive BARDAâs development support through DRIVeâs ReDIRECT program.\n\nThe therapeutic is approved in Japan for the treatment of asthma and post-stroke complications. MediciNova is independently investigating it in the U.S. for COVID-19 patients that are at a high risk of developing ARDS. MN-166 has been evaluated in more than 21 ongoing or completed clinical trials under MediciNovaâs management.\n\nDrug repurposing evaluates new uses, outside of the original clinical indication, for therapeutics that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or that are in late-stage development. Repurposing MN-166 as an MCM for treatment after either accidental or intentional exposure to chlorine could help to improve patient health outcomes and save lives following exposure.\n\nThis award is just one component of BARDAâs Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) medical countermeasures and DRIVeâs medical countermeasures portfolio. Visit DRIVeâs ReDIRECT program to learn more.\n\nAbout MediciNova:\n\nThe following information is provided by the company and does not indicate an endorsement by the federal government of the company or its products.\n\nMediciNova is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical dedicated to repurposing and developing safe pharmacotherapies for the treatment of diseases for which there is a large, unmet medical need. One compound in our portfolio, MN-166, is being developed for oral and injectable formulations for ALS, progressive multiple sclerosis, glioblastoma, substance abuse, and prevention of ARDS associated with COVID-19. MN-166 was granted Fast-track and/or Orphan-drug designation by FDA and EMA for most of these indications and is being evaluated in clinical studies in the U.S. and abroad at academic and research institutions including Columbia University, UCLA, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, MGH Harvard University, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Yale University, Oregon Health & Science University, University of Sydney (AU), and University of Cambridge (UK)."
