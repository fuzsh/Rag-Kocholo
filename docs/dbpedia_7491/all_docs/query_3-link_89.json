        "text": "There is no telling what an appetite for success and a passion for technology will produce. One thing for certain, the desire to give the customer the best security solution possible will likely bear a long-term, winning combination.\n\nJessica Clark, age 36, has that passion, and her recipe for success should be patented, if it isn’t already. Years ago, Clark was an art student in New York, who completed her studies but had a rough time finding employment. To make ends meet, and because she is a person who works smart, she took temporary employment as a receptionist.\n\nCall it providence, but Clark took advantage of the time while working at an IT company by reading and studying potential job plans. First she studied, and then Clark began to make grammar and style corrections on a $75 million proposal the contracts department was working on. Once she had the concepts in place, she began to offer suggestions that seemed to make a job easier, more efficient and profitable, and by the time the company won the contract only she and a consultant were left working on it.\n\nHer diligence in asking what the company was doing and if she could join in the planning meant the temporary job didn’t last long. She was soon hired full-time as a valued member of the professional staff. Her desire to learn brought her in touch with Bobby Khullar, who was the executive vice president at the IT firm.\n\nA great professional relationship was soon hatched.\n\nBlossoming into Security\n\nIn 2000, Khullar founded Sigma ITPD. This company supported thousands of desktops and mostly attended to the needs of the government, in particular, the Navy; but by 2005, the market was getting a little too tough, and profit margins were getting slimmer by the month and Sigma Surveillance was born.\n\nKhullar wanted to move in a different direction and felt that the security industry was a natural progression. Sigma Surveillance began building and marketing a series of DVRs, affectionately called “Dali DVR”—named after the famed surrealist artist Salvador Dali. This product is still being built and sold, but by 2008, the business needed to move in yet another direction. Sigma soon became STS360, currently based in Plano, Texas.\n\nAs the security market was feeling the pinch by a stalling economy in the early 2000s, STS360 was just getting off the ground. Probably not the best year to launch a new business, but for this small integrator, business was taking off. And, being a Texas-based company probably helped as the economy in the Lone Star State was still riding the crest of a higher wave of prosperity.\n\n“Once we decided to go fully into the security market, Jessica was very aggressive to advance the company and stand out from the competition as an IP video surveillance integrator,” Khullar said. “Jessica also established a solid relationship with OnSSI as a platinum partner with their video management system.”"
