        "text": "Low-code application platforms key for faster gains and lower cost of deployment\n\nGlobally, organisations are having to adapt to a new way of working. Businesses are being disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and are rethinking how they operate. Many are working with less budget, but their need for resources and faster development of software solutions is increasing.\n\nBusiness owners and senior managers are also discovering that with a new way of working, there’s also a need to replace systems – in a hurry. The pandemic impacted on the world so swiftly, that there hasn’t been sufficient time to transition from one system to another. Most business owners recognise that business continuity is essential for both customer service and growth, and especially now during these unprecedented times.\n\nIt’s also crucial for government agencies to be able to deploy software solutions quickly and efficiently, because now more than ever, governments need their systems and workflows to be operating efficiently.\n\nSo what’s the answer? Low code application platforms (LCAPs), also known by Gartner as high-productivity application Platform as a Service (hpaPaaS), that can build the solutions you need faster and iteratively. You can improve customer experience, restore governance and gain operational efficiencies over three times faster than traditional methods.\n\nOne of the cities hardest hit by Covid-19 is New York. The outbreak has put unprecedented pressure on public officials and government agencies, and the USA in general has been criticised by not acting quickly enough to take control of the virus spread. But one way New York moved very swiftly was online – using a hpaPaaS approach, they created a Covid-19 crisis-management software platform in only days – without writing a single line of code.\n\nhpaPaaS can take your business beyond digitisation to true digital transformation, and it can be done swiftly and efficiently. This is crucial if you’ve found yourself caught short by the pandemic, and you’ve identified an urgent need for a software solution that will help not only address a specific problem, but can actually move your operation into the digital era. You might have had a project in the pipeline, or you’ve identified a business need that’s surfaced because of the pandemic; what it comes down to is you need a solution and you need it now.\n\nviisConnect is our enterprise hpaPaaS solution, built right here to meet the requirements of the New Zealand and Australian market across the public and private sector. What we’ve done is given it a pragmatic twist by offering a vast array of pre-built software modules. They’re around 80% fit for purpose out of the box, allowing for a rapid 20% configuration to meet 100% of your business needs (without the need to write a single line of code). This 100% fit means you don’t compromise your business processes, as there are no gaps in our offering. This perfect fit coupled with the ability to realise gains three times faster than traditional software development brings immense value to our clients.\n\nA good example of this is the Greater Christchurch Claims Resolution Service (GCCRS), which was established to provide homeowners a free-to-access, impartial pathway to settle claims. New legislation around claims meant the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) needed a software solution that could launch within a 12 week time frame. There was simply no way that could be achieved with traditional software design, so the hunt was on for a solution that could be deployed as swiftly as possible.\n\nDue to previous success in the government sector, iViis was approached to leverage viisConnect to rapidly build a solution to fast-track outstanding claims, streamline the process, and pull together all necessary documentation in order to reach a resolution faster. When the project was launched, the aim was to deliver an online case management system driving the new one-stop shop service established for outstanding earthquake residential insurance claims. A project of this scope would typically go live in approximately nine months; iViis had the GCCRS portal up and running in only three. It’s a really good example of how an hpaPaaS solution can turn a project around in the shortest time possible while delivering a full-blown service.\n\nIf you’ve got an internal development team that’s currently all over the place due to the Covid-19 pandemic – or you’ve had to lay some of them off – you’ll find that you’re under increasing pressure to deliver to your customers. viisConnect will allow you to develop business processes and applications three times faster than a traditional software solution, and you don’t need a team of programmers to do it.\n\nviisConnect is a platform that provides the speed of an hpaPaaS, but with greater ability to deliver a solution that can meet your organisation’s specific needs. As the developers and maintainers of our own hpaPaaS, it also means we have complete control over it, and we work closely with you to constantly evolve it."
