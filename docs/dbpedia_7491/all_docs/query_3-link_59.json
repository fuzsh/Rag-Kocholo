        "text": "Japanese video game company\n\nWarp Inc., now known as From Yellow To Orange Ltd., is a Japanese video game developer. Founded by musician Kenji Eno in 1994, the company is best known for its interactive movies, such as D and Enemy Zero, often featuring music composed by Eno himself. Following the release of D2, the company briefly rebranded as Super Warp, before settling on its current name in 2001. Kenji Eno headed the company until his death in February 2013.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKenji Eno founded Warp in 1994.[2] The Warp logo—four television screens displaying the four letters of the company name—was designed by Eno and designer Tomohiro Miyazaki.[3] Warp developed several interactive cinema games, their most successful series being D. In 2000, following the release of D2, Warp changed its name to Super Warp and exited the video game industry, widening its scope to network services, DVD products, and online music.[2][4]\n\nFollowing an investment by Neoteny Inc., the company changed its name once again to From Yellow To Orange (commonly abbreviated as \"fyto\") in 2001.[2] Fyto released the game You, Me, and the Cubes in 2009.[4] Eno headed the company as president and chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in February 2013.[4] Katsutoshi Eguchi subsequently became the company's CEO.[5] Eno's final project, Kakexun, became a collaborative effort between Fyto and Naoya Sato's company Warp2.[5]\n\nGames developed\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Publisher Platform 1994 Trip'd San-Ei Shobo Publishing (Japan)\n\nPanasonic (USA) 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Totsugeki Kikan Magadasu!!
