        "text": "We’re moving fast, maybe too fast and one of the things we need to get a grip of quickly is the pivotal role of user experience in interoperability because currently? We’re going backwards at speed.\n\nUser-centric design is non-negotiable in this landscape and yet no one seems to care in the west in particular and this is not ok. Building these niche experiences does not autonomy make, but I get you, the journey toward achieving seamless interoperability is not without its challenges. To ensure a digital future brimming with autonomy, it's crucial to address these common hurdles. I read a really cool article a couple of weeks ago by IMD about Asia’s e-commerce game. It is strong. It is so strong that transitioning over to a new platform use case such as 3D web will be seamless for everyone from JD.com to the smaller retailer: “sellers seek to create “omnichannel” experiences for purchasing managers.” That’s the autonomy economy (you can thank me later).\n\nOne of the key challenges lies in ensuring the integration of diverse systems and technologies without sacrificing user experience and I think game technology can support a 3D immersive web pretty well. As various sectors adopt interoperability solutions, there is a growing need for user-friendly interfaces that cater to individuals and organizations from all walks of life. You’ve played Runescape, you know how complicated UIs can be when you hit the mastery level, but game UIs, inclusive of Runescape, are also incredibly simple because they are cumulative. So I can’t understand why outside of gamification and game technology, achieving the same cumulative approach requires such a concerted effort to streamline and simplify the interaction between users and the technology they rely on. Babes, you’re making it too difficult.\n\nYes, security and privacy are paramount concerns in an era where data is the lifeblood of digital ecosystems. Achieving interoperability while safeguarding sensitive information is no small feat. It demands the development of robust security protocols and encryption mechanisms that protect user data, reassuring them that their autonomy comes with the utmost protection. But in games we have the same protocols to protect out players. If we’re simply switching out a player for a consumer, what’s the diff?\n\nNext? NEXT!\n\nThe future of interoperability, as I hinted in previous articles, is a transformative power for any business. And it’s a paradigm shift for corporations. As we look ahead, it becomes clear that interoperability is poised to unlock even greater levels of autonomy if we can just build with and upon the assumption that everyone will approach the immersive 3D internet problem with the same process or more importantly the same outcome. The days of out-teching your competitors are surely over, right? I’ve seen enough crappy commerce systems to know that we’re at the end of days for quite a lot of this technology.\n\nIn most decent tech people’s digital future, emerging trends and technologies will redefine the way we interact with the digital world rather than hamper it. The adoption of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) will grant users unparalleled control over decision-making and governance. Through these DAOs, individuals and organisations can participate actively in shaping the future of digital ecosystems, further enhancing their autonomy. Bear with me here, that might be a little trippy and yes I did rave in the 90s but what I’m trying to say is anything you have concerns about from AI stealing you job to cryptocurrency being scammy can be controlled by you. Go on granddad, look it up. DAOs can be pretty good, you know?\n\nTechnological marvels like blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies will become instrumental in securing interoperability, the assurance in the integrity of data sharing across diverse platforms is actually a future, future insurance. These innovations will ensure that autonomy is coupled with trust and transparency to effectively futureproof what happens next (after 3D web, I mean).\n\nMoreover, augmented and virtual reality experiences should then seamlessly integrate with the physical world, offering users immersive and interactive autonomy across industries, from education to entertainment. The fusion of the digital and physical realms will create dynamic, user-centric environments where autonomy knows no bounds. Had enough of my optimism? I get it, it’s complicated because we don’t have even a glimpse of the future when we’re living in the reality of maybe 4 tech bros in Silicon Valley and host of acolytes. So how does that explain the IMD article about e-commerce and the autonomy principles? I’m thinking about it for you because you have no plan. But if you want to figure out the future for your business so that you don’t become a useless commodity or a useful idiot, I would explore what autonomy means to business in way more depth than here.\n\nYou can listen to me talk about this and how game technology is at the forefront of interoperability in Glasgow this November 3rd and in Busan on November 17th. If you want to learn a bit more, why not pick up a copy of my book “From Pixels to Portals: Exploring the future of the metaverse through the evolution of video games” when it launches this November."
