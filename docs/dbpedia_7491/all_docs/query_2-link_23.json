        "text": "Simplifying regulatory procedures can improve the speed and efficiency of government\n\nInÃªs dos Santos Costa, former Secretary of State for the Environment, Portugal31\n\nFor businesses, navigating government regulations can be a complex and time-consuming process. With multiple overlapping regulations, several government entities involved at different levels, and legacy processes, it's easy for businesses to lose track of different processes and simply give up, which can lead to the loss of valuable opportunities.\n\nIn Portugal, we are making it easier for businesses to interact with the government, reducing friction points between the two in the regulation space. Take the environmental licensing system. We introduced several reforms to our existing system to simplify and expedite it, accelerating our transition to a green economy.\n\nThe Portuguese Single Environmental Licensing (LUA) system was launched in 2015 to streamline and speed up the environmental licensing system. Since then, we have been consistently evolving and integrating new requirements for ease of organizations. The latest changes introduced in 2023 have been a game-changer in making it easier for businesses to comply with environmental regulations.\n\nToday, the LUA issues a Single Environmental Title that consolidates all environmental licensing decisions and summarizes all information related to the business requirement for a given project.32 The goal is simple: one request, one certificate, one fee. This streamlines environment-related licensing requirements and coordinates with various institutions in charge of the permits under the portal, ultimately reducing the time it takes to obtain multiple licenses.33\n\nA key of the LUA system is a time simulator. This tool guides users through the entire process, helping them understand which regimes apply to their case, the associated fees, the licensing entity, and the expected time of issue. Once the process starts, an integrated timeline is included in the dashboard that allows users to visualize where the process is and the expected time of issuance.\n\nPortugal has also made significant strides in reducing fees associated with environmental licensing. Depending on the type of licensing, some fees have been reduced by more than 50%, with the average reduction being around 20%.\n\nThese reforms to the licensing process also aim to eliminate redundancies and the need for resubmission upon license expiration. This not only speeds up the licensing process but also represents an important step forward in fostering a more business-friendly environment."
