        "text": "Well, in this case it's more like \"finding a killscreen in an endless game with a TAS\", but I figure it's close enough to go here... One A2600 game I have been testing for suitability for submission is an unreleased game named Telepathy, which was originally created by Atari to be played with an experimental \"MindLink\" controller (control your Atari with your mind by spastically twitching your face!) However, the existing prototype is fully playable (and thus potentially TASable in BizHawk) with a standard A2600 joystick. The game was generally presumed to be endless when I started a test run a couple months back, mostly to determine where a potential submission would have to stop (leaving aside the question of whether a game like this could even be accepted on the grounds it is technically not a finished game). However, upon reaching the 11th level of the game, I found a certain obstacle could not be passed even with tool-assistance if it was already active when you appear on the screen it was on. I reported this by email to another A2600 enthusiast (who runs a fan website with all kinds of information on the console and its games), and after some back and forth trial and error between us discovered that the seemingly impossible obstacle could be passed if it wasn't active (that bit requires luck manipulation), but the final section of the same 11th level was impossible to beat because you aren't given enough time on the death timer to get through it. Thus, a killscreen was discovered! :D Details about the above discoveries for anyone interested in reading\n\nI think that the question in the title of the thread, \"games games that have only been beaten in a TAS\" is, in itself, rather unlikely to occur. After all, games are usually designed to be beatable, save for a few joke games that are intentionally not. Although another example might be some shovelware that has some bug that makes it unintentionally unbeatable, except for the use of some glitch of bug. (Was Cheetahmen an example of this, or do I remember incorrectly?)\n\nIt is not uncommon for developers to add a ridiculously hard difficulty level that even they cannot complete; these are designed to be unbeatable but you're welcome to try. Examples include Nightmare mode on the original DOOM (\"lol let's double monster speed and have everything respawn after seconds!\"), and Deity level on Civilization (\"yeah, how about triple computer build speed and make all the player's citizens unhappy!\"); the Reallyjoel's Dad difficulties are a parody of this concept. Of course, it is also not uncommon for hardcore players to become better than the devs and complete these difficulties anyway.\n\nOn another note, there might be another qualitatively different class of games (other than games where one relies on optional super hard modes in order to fulfill the condition, or hacks of games from its community which very usually seem to go to higher and higher difficulties naturally) that fulfill this condition (of having only been beaten in TAS manner), namely those (preferably long) games that are just very unpopular (and hence likely bad), or mostly unknown or hard to find, or e.g. with just very few cartridges ever made for them, so that the player base is small and might lose interest at some point before the game would be finished."
