        "text": "This is a rush transcript from “Fox News Sunday” December 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.\n\nThe first Americans could begin receiving the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow as\n\nthe FDA gives the green light.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our nation has achieved a\n\nmedical miracle.\n\nWALLACE (voice-over): Billions of doses from Pfizer to all 50 states.\n\nWe'll track plans to distribute the vaccine and get it to the Americans who\n\nneed it most.\n\nWe're joined by Dr. Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, only on\n\n\"FOX News Sunday.\"\n\nThen, a last push for COVID relief before Congress adjourns for the year.\n\nWe'll ask the leader of the bipartisan Gang of Eight, West Virginia Senator\n\nJoe Manchin, what's holding up a compromise.\n\nPlus, the federal investigation into Hunter Biden's taxes, Congressman Eric\n\nSwalwell's links to a suspected Chinese spy, and President Trump's push to\n\noverturn the election -- we'll discuss at all with a number two Republican\n\nin the House, Steve Scalise.\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT: They bring deep experience and bold new\n\nthinking.\n\nWALLACE: President-elect Biden introduces more of his cabinet and White\n\nHouse team. We'll ask our Sunday panel about push back to his picks from\n\nboth the right and the left.\n\nAnd our \"Power Player of the Week,\" how the social network app Parler is\n\ndrawing conservatives focusing on freer speech.\n\nAll, right now, on \"FOX News Sunday\".\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE (on camera): And hello again from FOX News in Washington.\n\nThere are real signs of hope today in the long fight against the\n\ncoronavirus pandemic as emergency doses of a vaccine just 11 months in the\n\nmaking are headed to the American public.\n\nThe first doses -- doses from Pfizer expected in states tomorrow morning.\n\nLimited supply means the first in line will be frontline health care\n\nworkers and nursing home residents.\n\nBut, this promising news comes as the nation sets another record for COVID-\n\n19 daily deaths, passing 3,300 on Thursday.\n\nWe'll talk with chief advisor to Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Moncef Slaoui,\n\nin a moment.\n\nBut we begin with Mike Tobin live from the Pfizer plant in Portage,\n\nMichigan, where the first shipments are leaving today -- Mike.\n\nMIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Chris, about a half-hour ago, we\n\nsaw the first trucks, both FedEx and UPS, leave the Pfizer facility here in\n\nPortage, Michigan, a joint effort with partners ranging from doctors to\n\nresearchers and factory workers led to this moment.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nTOBIN (voice-over): The first shipments leaving by truck to be flown to\n\nregional hubs around the country, then distributed to hospitals and local\n\npharmacies.\n\nGEN. GUSTAVE PERNA, OPERATION WARP SPEED CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER: D-Day\n\nwas the beginning of the end and that's where we are today.\n\nTOBIN: The army general overseeing the logistics operation saying it's go\n\ntime.\n\nPERNA: Now, we'll begin distribution of safe and effective vaccines to the\n\nAmerican people.\n\nTOBIN: Shipping giant FedEx will ship to the west, UPS, the east,\n\nutilizing a sophisticated super cold shipping chain is the vaccine needs to\n\nbe kept at negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Distribution of doses based on a\n\nstate's population. A large state by California getting by 330,000, a small\n\nstate like Delaware about 8,800.\n\nThe FDA stresses corners were not cut when it came to safety or research\n\nand denied reports that its chief was threatened with his job.\n\nDR. STEPHEN HAHN, FDA COMMISSIONER: Science and data guided the FDA's\n\ndecision. We worked quickly based on the urgency of this pandemic, not\n\nbecause of any other external pressure.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nTOBIN (on camera): Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says 100\n\nmillion doses will make it to the public by February, with shots going into\n\narms as early as tomorrow -- Chris.\n\nWALLACE: Mike Tobin reporting from the Pfizer plant. Mike, thank you for\n\nsome very good news.\n\nTOBIN: You got it.\n\nWALLACE: And joining us now, Operation Warp Speed chief advisor, Dr.\n\nMoncef Slaoui.\n\nDoctor, I want to begin by saying congratulations to you and your team for\n\nthis remarkable accomplishment.\n\nDR. MONCEF SLAOUI, OPERATION WARP SPEED CHIEF ADVISER: Good morning,\n\nChris, and thank you for having me and thank you for your nice words.\n\nOf course, thousands and tens of thousands of people have participated to\n\nthis first critical milestone. I want to congratulate Pfizer and BioNTech,\n\nwho are really the key players in delivering this vaccine. And I'd say it's\n\na very good day for America and for the world.\n\nWALLACE: I want to ask you questions about both the short-term and the\n\nlong-term.\n\nHow long before your first two top priority groups, health care workers on\n\nthe front line and nursing home residents, before they're fully vaccinated,\n\nget both of their doses of the Pfizer vaccine?\n\nSLAOUI: So we planned to have about 14 million doses of vaccine available\n\nto us and distributed in the U.S. by the end of this year, so by the end of\n\nDecember. Those would be both Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. And\n\nthe next month, we will have about 50 million to 80 million doses\n\ndistributed in January, and another same number in February.\n\nSo, all in all, we hope to have immunized 100 million people, which would\n\nbe the long-term care facility people, the elderly people with\n\ncomorbidities, the first line workers, the health care workers. It's about\n\n120 million people. We would have immunized 100 million people by the first\n\nquarter of 2021 with two doses of vaccines. So, that's 200 million doses of\n\nvaccine.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Right. Now my long-term question. How long before we have herd\n\nimmunity from the vaccine where enough people have been vaccinated that we\n\nreally feel that the pandemic has turned a corner, and you and I will feel\n\nsafe going out in a crowd?\n\nSLAOUI: So we need to have immunized about 75 or 80 percent of the U.S.\n\npopulation before herd immunity can really be established. We hope to reach\n\nthat point between the month of May and the month of June.\n\nIt is however critical that most of the American people decide and accept\n\nto take the vaccine. We are very concerned by the hesitancy that we see,\n\nthe level of hesitancy that we see. But we hope that now that all the data\n\nis out and available to be discussed in detail, that people will keep their\n\nmind open to listen to the data and hopefully agree that this is a very\n\neffective and safe vaccine, and therefore take it.\n\nWALLACE: I want to get to these questions of public doubt in a moment, but\n\nI want to first talk about questions about supplies. Pfizer says, yes, it\n\nis going to keep its commitment and deliver 100 million doses of the\n\nvaccine in short order, but that it can't deliver anymore doses, another\n\nhundred million or more until the summer because of contracts it has with\n\nother countries.\n\nAnd the main company, the one that we were betting on most, AstraZeneca, is\n\nwell behind schedule in its tests.\n\nSo the question I have is, is there a possibility that come spring, we're\n\nnot going to have enough supplies to go around to continue this very\n\nambitious distribution plan that you just talked about?\n\nSLAOUI: Well, I think -- so the short answer is most likely no, and the\n\nreason is really our plan from day one has been to have a portfolio of\n\nproducts. We have six different products being developed. Pfizer is one of\n\nthem.\n\nModerna, which likely will be approved by Friday probably this coming week,\n\nis able to produce 100 million doses in the first quarter, and we just\n\nannounced on Friday that we committed to acquire another hundred million\n\ndoses. This will be delivered in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nJanssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, is in the last stages of conducting\n\ntheir phase three trial with their vaccine. It's a one stop vaccine. That\n\nvaccine is likely to be ready for authorization late in January or early in\n\nFebruary, and by then we will be able to have anywhere between 20 million\n\nand 60 million doses already in the month of February available to start\n\nimmunizing and then going forward, many more doses on a monthly basis.\n\nAstraZeneca is one of them. We expect them to potentially be approvable\n\nsomewhere late in February and then we have two more coming afterwards.\n\nSo, Pfizer is not the sole supplier. But having said that, we are working\n\nwith Pfizer to continue helping them and supporting them achieve the\n\nobjective of providing us with another hundred million doses in the second\n\nquarter of 2021.\n\nWALLACE: I want to pick up, Doctor, on the issue that you raised just\n\nbefore this. While Operation Warp Speed has had some remarkable\n\nbreakthroughs, there is this question of public doubt about taking the\n\nvaccine.\n\nI want to put these numbers up on the screen. In a recent poll, 27 percent\n\nof Americans said they are, quote, not sure they will get the vaccine, and\n\n26 percent said they will not get it.\n\nI understand it's early in people's minds may change, but if more than half\n\nof Americans didn't get the vaccine, what would that mean for the pandemic?\n\nWould it continue?\n\nSLAOUI: I -- unfortunately, I think it would and I think there will be a\n\nlot virus circulating, a lot of people dying, a lot of people in hospitals.\n\nI think it would be a very, very unfortunate outcome.\n\nFrankly, I'm very concerned by this level of hesitancy that is not anchored\n\nin any facts or data. Unfortunately, there was so much politics around in\n\nthe context of developing this vaccine, there's been a confusion between\n\nhow thorough and scientific and factual the work that has been done is, and\n\nthe perception that people are thinking that we cut corners or anything\n\nlike that.\n\nI can guarantee you that no such things have happened, that we follow the\n\nscience. It's actually a remarkable achievement of science, academia, the\n\nindustry ecosystem and the U.S. government working together relentlessly\n\nthat has allowed this to happen.\n\nAnd please, just keep your mind open, look at the data. Look at the people\n\nwho get the vaccine and how they will be protected and be safe, and I hope\n\nmost people will finally decide to take this vaccine.\n\nWALLACE: But let me pick up on that, Doctor. You rightly say one of the\n\nconcerns people have is that this vaccine was pushed through for political\n\nreasons and there was some -- a new data point, if you will, on that just\n\nthis week.\n\nOn Friday, the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows called in the FDA\n\ncommissioner, Stephen Hahn, and reportedly said to him, approve the vaccine\n\nby the end of the day or at least raise the possibility that he might lose\n\nhis job. And that same day Friday, President Trump tweeted this: Get the\n\ndamn vaccines out now, Dr. Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives.\n\nQuestion, sir, is that helpful in persuading people that this vaccine is\n\nall about the science and not about politics?\n\nSLAOUI: I think, first, those are rumors. I can't -- I can't know if they\n\nare right, true or not.\n\nI do think it's not helpful because it's not needed. The day before on\n\nThursday, this past week, it was actually a remarkably transparent\n\ndiscussion over the whole day transmitted on TV live, of all the data of\n\nthe Pfizer vaccine.\n\nThere was a vote by independent experts who said yes, this vaccine is safe\n\nand effective and should be used in people that are 16 years of age and\n\nolder.\n\nAnd next day, the FDA was going to look specifically in some more points\n\nand more importantly, after they go through administrative steps and\n\napprove the vaccine. If that phone call happened, I think it was useless\n\nand unfortunate, and so are some of the tweets.\n\nWALLACE: So, you're -- finally, as a doctor, your prescription for getting\n\nthis vaccine out and people taking it would be tell the politicians to keep\n\nquiet?\n\nSLAOUI: I would say so, or just don't pay attention to that. I could tell\n\nyou that for the last seven months, we have worked super hard in the\n\noperation with the companies, with scientists, with everybody involved.\n\nThere was a lot of noise on top of us in terms of the politics and the\n\ntweets and, you know, the campaigns, et cetera, on all parties, but that\n\ndid never translate into any kind of interference of any sort. And I would\n\nassume that the FDA behaved exactly the same way.\n\nPeople can talk on top of the news, et cetera, but the experts are working\n\nand doing their work in the relentless way, just focusing on the science\n\nand the data.\n\nWALLACE: Dr. Slaoui, thank you. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us\n\nand again, sir, congratulations on the remarkable work by you and by your\n\nteam.\n\nSLAOUI: Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: And thank you, sir.\n\nSLAOUI: Thank you, Chris.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, lawmakers scramble to approve a plan for COVID relief\n\nbefore they leave town and benefits expire for millions of Americans. We'll\n\ntalk with the leader of the bipartisan group pushing a compromise, Senator\n\nJoe Manchin, about the issues that still divide the parties and what's at\n\nstake for all Americans.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: A week ago we told you about a bipartisan group of lawmakers who\n\nput together a compromise package for coronavirus relief. It looked then\n\nlike it might sail through, but no longer.\n\nJoining us now from West Virginia, Senator Joe Manchin, a leading member of\n\nthe Gang of Eight pushing that plan.\n\nSenator, is the Gang of Eight's compromise, $908 billion, is that plan now\n\ndead and is there a chance that Congress may leave town for the year\n\nwithout passing any COVID relief at all?\n\nSEN. JOE MANCHIN, (D) WEST VIRGINIA: Well, first of all, Chris, the plan\n\nis alive and well and there's no way, no way that we are going to leave\n\nWashington without taking care of the emergency needs of our people. And\n\nthat's all over our country and my state of West Virginia too. They are all\n\nhurting everywhere.\n\nWALLACE: But it seems you've got -- and I'm going to get into some\n\nspecifics in a minute -- you've got the president --\n\nMANCHIN: Sure, sure.\n\nWALLACE: -- pushing one plan, the Senate Majority Leader McConnell pushing\n\nanother, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats a third. You know, it seemed, as I\n\nsay, a week ago like maybe they were all going to come together behind your\n\nplan. There's an awful lot of talk that negotiations have fallen apart.\n\nMANCHIN: Well, here's the thing, it hasn't fallen apart. We've been\n\nmeeting day and night for the last month. We were on a call all day\n\nyesterday, we get on a call again this afternoon to finish things up. We'll\n\nhave a bill produced for the American people tomorrow, $908 billion.\n\nNow, Chris, the bottom line is there's a lot of parts to this bill and in\n\nthe spirit of compromise, you have to work through all of that. But at the\n\nend, you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. There's going to\n\nbe -- individually, if you put a bill up, there's (ph) -- some of the\n\nmembers wouldn't vote for certain parts of the bill but when you put them\n\naltogether and look at the good it does for our country, in the most\n\nemergency way that we need it, this is only until April the one (ph).\n\nWe are trying to get through the toughest first quarter of our country that\n\nwe've ever faced and we've got people without nutrition, we have people\n\nwithout shelter, we have people without paychecks, they're unemployed. We\n\nhave -- hospitals are being overburdened. We have health care workers. We\n\nhave schools that need to be attended to.\n\nThis covers all of that and we give all the small businesses a chance to\n\nsurvive until the first quarter. By then we should start to come out with a\n\nvaccine that should be helping us and Joe Biden will be our president and\n\nmake a determination what more's needed. This is strictly an emergency\n\nmeasure.\n\nWALLACE: But I just want to make it clear, the bill you're talking about\n\ntomorrow is a bill that the Gang of Eight agrees on. You don't have\n\nmajority support in the Senate. You don't have majority support in the\n\nHouse. Let me ask you about some of the alternatives that are out there now\n\nand let's -- if you don't mind, a lightning round, quick questions, quick\n\nanswers.\n\nPresident Trump says forget -- President Trump says forget the unemployment\n\nbenefits, just send a single stimulus check, $600, to each American. Is\n\nthat a good idea?\n\nMANCHIN: It's a bad idea and I hope he reevaluates that statement because\n\nbasically if you're sending stimulus check of $600 or whatever it may be,\n\nit was 1,200 before, you're sending it to people that still have a paycheck\n\nand still have a job. If you send a check to an unemployed person, you are\n\nsending a person that has no lifeline, it's done at the end of this month.\n\nThey've got nothing. We're going for $300 extended for 16 weeks. I think\n\nthat's much more reasonable, practical, and much-needed.\n\nWALLACE: All right, Republican leaders still want some liability\n\nprotection for businesses so people, when they go to a restaurant or a\n\nschool or whatever, can't then sue and say you gave me COVID. Democrats\n\nstill want a lot of aid to cities and states, but the Republicans don't\n\nlike the Democratic idea, the Democrats don't like the Republican idea. Is\n\nthat still the hold-up?\n\nMANCHIN: Well, the spirit of compromise is this, everybody's not going to\n\nget what they want. We can get something we could all live with but we are\n\nputting a product forward. It's going to go forward with both -- with\n\neverything hopefully in it. You will see a complete bill tomorrow before\n\nthe end of the day.\n\nThen you can choose if you like it or not. Vote for it or vote against it.\n\nLook at that good it does as a whole, not an individual piece. There's\n\nnobody that wants a business to be litigated out of business. They are\n\ngoing to be tough enough just surviving. On the other hand, we don't want\n\nto throw caution to the wind that the businesses aren't safe places to\n\nwork, the workers not protected, and the people that patronize these places\n\nof businesses are not in a safe environment.\n\nWe have to take all that into consideration and do the best we can. I\n\nremind you this, it's for a short period of time. A short period. We are\n\nnot changing the tort laws forever. We're just trying to get through an\n\nemergency period of time.\n\nWALLACE: All right. Some senators are saying, look, liability is an issue,\n\naid to cities and states is an issue, let's forget about both of those in\n\nthis bill and just stick aid specifically to unemployed workers and aid to\n\nsmall businesses on the bill that you've got to pass to keep the government\n\nrunning to avoid a shutdown. Forget about that other stuff for now. What to\n\nthink about that idea?\n\nMANCHIN: Chris, that's the easy way. That's the easy way out. We can\n\nforget about the tough things. That's what we've been doing for 10 years or\n\nmore. No one wants to take a tough vote. They are all afraid it's going to\n\nhurt them in the election. We are here to take tough votes. We're here to\n\nhelp our country that's having a tremendous hardship going on right now and\n\nit's going to get worse before it gets better.\n\nSo with that being said, that's the easy way. We can drop off both\n\nliability and drop off aid to states, but states and municipalities\n\nespecially, they are on the front line. You want your services to go,\n\nessential services, first-responders, firemen, policemen? You want all\n\nthose to be in jeopardy? The services that we depend on and need, to let it\n\nfall apart and then think we can pick it back up? You want the airlines to\n\ncollapse?\n\nYou want all these things to go by the wayside? We don't. We are going to\n\nmake the tough selection. Now if the rest of the caucus won't go along with\n\nit, they will decide what they can throw out. If the leaders can come\n\ntogether -- but we worked as a bipartisan group and we've grown over the\n\nmonth. We got a good product that has been vetted in so many different\n\nways.\n\nAnd the only thing I can tell you, we've done what this place is supposed\n\nto do. We've worked together. We didn't work apart and condemn each other\n\nand point fingers. We've got a good product and we want the American people\n\nto know that in America, we can do it in a bipartisan way. We can do it and\n\nwe are going to do it.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Manchin, you've done a very good job of selling your\n\nplan. You have not done a good job of convincing me though it's going to\n\nget passed by Congress in the next week.\n\nMANCHIN: Well, there's no guarantee. There's 535 people that have to vote,\n\n535. I can't guarantee they're all going to vote for it and pass it. But I\n\ncan tell you one thing, what's the alternative? What are you going to do?\n\nWe would give them one month, day and night, our staffs have worked around-\n\nthe-clock. We've done everything we can to put an all-inclusive product\n\ntogether.\n\nPick whatever parts you like, whatever parts you don't like, put it all\n\ntogether or take it as a whole. We are going to give it to you the way we\n\nthink the American people need it. In an emergency situation, we need this\n\nlegislation.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Manchin, I want to switch to just one other subject.\n\nWe've got a little...\n\nMANCHIN: Sure.\n\nWALLACE: We've got less than two minutes left. Do any of Joe Biden's\n\nnominees, members of his team, give you heartburn? For instance, you --\n\nback when Barack Obama appointed Dr. Vivek Murthy as surgeon general, you\n\nopposed that. He is now being renamed by Joe Biden, Dr. Murthy, for surgeon\n\ngeneral. You've got Xavier Becerra for HHS.\n\nIs there anybody that he has named so far that you think, I'm not sure I\n\ncan vote to confirm them?\n\nMANCHIN: Well, let me be very clear, I've been very deferential with\n\nPresident Trump, President Obama's before, and I will be very deferential\n\nwith President Biden.\n\nI think a president ought to put their team together. Unless that person\n\nhas done something wrong or totally runs amok of what I believe and what I\n\nrepresent the state of West Virginia, then basically I always have said OK,\n\nput your team together.\n\nTheir will and pleasure. If they screw up and they're bad, you're going to\n\nbe held accountable and in four years, the people can atone that.\n\nSo I've been very deferential. I'm going to look at each one of them. There\n\nmight be some that I don't agree with. I will be able to let the Biden\n\nadministration know how I feel but we haven't done the personal interviews\n\nyet before we confirm. I look forward to that.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Manchin, thank you. Thanks for joining us and good luck\n\nthis weekend coming up with a relief package, Lord knows the country needs\n\nit. Thank you, sir.\n\nMANCHIN: Chris, we are going to do it. People believe in America. This is\n\na great country and the people need help right now so we can be great\n\nagain, and we'll make it happen, we will.\n\nWALLACE: Well, the power of positive thinking. Thank you, sir.\n\nUp next, the investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter complicate the\n\npresident-elect's choice of the new attorney general. Top House Republican\n\nSteve Scalise joins us. That's next.\n\n(COMMERRCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Coming up, Republicans accuse a Democrat on the House Intel\n\nCommittee of jeopardizing national security.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Eric Swalwell should\n\ntake it upon himself to resign for Intel.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask a top House Republican, Steve Scalise, about Swalwell's\n\ninvolvement with an alleged Chinese spy. That's next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n930\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Democrats are playing defense with\n\nPresident-elect Biden's son under investigation for his tax dealings and\n\nRepublicans demanding answers about Congressman Eric Swalwell, a member of\n\nthe Intelligence Committee, and his ties to a suspected Chinese spy.\n\nJoining us now, the number two Republican in the House, Congressman Steve\n\nScalise.\n\nAnd, Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n\nREP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Good morning, Chris. Great to be back with you.\n\nWALLACE: So the Electoral College votes tomorrow. When the electors, 270 of\n\nthem, vote in favor of Joe Biden, and he becomes the president-elect, will\n\nyou stop contesting this election?\n\nSCALISE: Well, Chris, look, there has been a lot of contesting of the\n\nelection in multiple states. The president's done it, other groups have\n\ndone it too, and that's because of the concerns people had. When you look\n\nat massive vote swings days and weeks after the election, millions of\n\npeople feel very frustrated with this process. And, look, there -- there's\n\ngoing to ultimately be a conclusion to this, but for now I think, if you\n\njust discount the fact that millions of people wonder, why is it that in\n\nsome states Florida, Texas, large states, they had the results by 10:00\n\nthat night and then in other states it was days and weeks. And during those\n\ndays and weeks you saw massive vote swings that just cede a lot of\n\ndistrust. That's got to get resolved. We've got to start getting back to\n\nthe point where we can resolve elections on the night.\n\nWALLACE: But -- but -- but -- but -- but -- but, Congressman Scalise --\n\nCongressman Scalise --\n\nSCALISE: Yes.\n\nWALLACE: There -- the reason that there were these votes swings was because\n\nin a lot of states they weren't able to count the millions of mail-in\n\nballots until election night. And everybody knew that -- and, in fact, it\n\nhappened in Florida, it went the other way. They were able to count the\n\nmail-in ballots early, so it favored Biden early and then it swung to\n\nTrump. In Pennsylvania, they had to count the mail-in ballots late, so it\n\nstarted pro-Trump and then it swung to Biden.\n\nI mean what -- let me put it this way, the -- the attorney general of the\n\nUnited States, Bill Barr, appointed by Donald Trump, said he had his\n\nfederal investigators go out, there was no vote fraud.\n\nSCALISE: Well, Chris, first of all, look at New York, right? The Claudia\n\nTenney race in New York. She's up by 12 votes. Just the other day they\n\nfound 55 votes in a desk drawer. You know, this kind of stuff -- people\n\nlook at this and go, what is going on? This is the United States of\n\nAmerica, it's not Venezuela. That's what gets people irate. You know, why\n\nis this still going on?\n\nLet's have a chain of custody. Let's get back to making sure that everybody\n\ncan have full confidence in our elections. But just to look the other way\n\nand say, hey, look, you know, three weeks later they pulled -- they pulled\n\nthe corner like -- people are very frustrated with this. There's still an\n\nelection in Georgia on January 5th. And three weeks from now, we need to\n\nencourage people to go back out, but also to have a system where there's\n\ngoing to be more confidence than what they saw back in November.\n\nWALLACE: But, you know, there have been thousands of lawsuits and they've\n\nbeen rejected by state courts, by federal courts, by federal courts, by\n\njudges appointed by Donald Trump. And on Friday night the Supreme Court\n\nthrew out a lawsuit that was brought by the attorney general of Texas and a\n\nnumber of other attorney generals. And 126 Republicans in the House,\n\nincluding you, sir, signed onto that lawsuit. The -- the Supreme Court\n\nthrew it out without even listening to it. This was a lawsuit that was\n\ngoing to throw out the -- the votes in four swing states, Georgia,\n\nPennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. I mean you were talking about\n\ndisenfranchising the 10 million Biden voters who supported the president-\n\nelect in those four states. Do feel comfortable throwing out millions of\n\nvotes of your fellow Americans?\n\nSCALISE: Well, nobody wants any votes thrown out, Chris. And, the fact, the\n\n70 plus million votes that are also at stake for President Trump.\n\nWALLACE: But that's what your lawsuit would have done, sir.\n\nSCALISE: Well, no. What -- if you look at the Texas lawsuit, what it was\n\nsaying if, there are some states that didn't follow the laws that were on\n\ntheir books. The Constitution is very clear that it's state legislatures\n\nthat set the process for -- for having electors. Some secretary of states\n\nchanged those rules.\n\nWALLACE: Well, with -- with all due respect, sir, the Supreme Court -- the\n\nSupreme Court threw -- the Supreme Court threw that out. They didn't even\n\nhear it. They didn't think it even merited a hearing.\n\nSCALISE: Well, the Supreme Court said they weren't going to take the case.\n\nThey said Texas didn't have standing. They said Texas didn't have standing.\n\nThey didn't say they were going to address the merits.\n\nLook, the Supreme Court, I think a lot of people know, didn't want to be\n\nanywhere near this court. They don't like getting in the middle of disputes\n\nbetween other branches of government. And that's just something they've\n\ndone throughout history.\n\nWALLACE: So -- so, bottom line, even though the electors tomorrow are --\n\nmore than 270 of them are going to say that -- that Joe Biden is the next\n\npresident of the United States, you're not willing to recognize him as the\n\npresident-elect, and you're not willing to stop contesting this election?\n\nSCALISE: Well, hold on, Chris. First of all, Joe Biden has been going\n\nthrough a transition that even President Trump supported, while he's also\n\nfollowing what the court allows. There are legal challenges allowed. Nobody\n\nsaid back during Bush v Gore, prior to the Supreme Court finally resolving\n\nit, and ultimately there -- there was an -- you know, electors met, there\n\nwas a swearing in. Nobody disputed that. Maybe some of the Democrat side.\n\nBut you didn't see people ask prior to that to pass judgment before it was\n\nfully resolved. Let the legal process play out.\n\nBut if you want to restore trust by millions of people who are still very\n\nfrustrated and angry about what happened, that's why you've got to have the\n\nwhole system play out. There will be a president sworn in on January 20th,\n\nbut let's let this legal process play itself out.\n\nWALLACE: All right, let me switch to another subject.\n\nWe learned this week that the Justice Department is investigating the\n\npresident-elect's son, Hunter Biden, for his financial dealings with\n\nforeign countries. We also learned this week that -- that Attorney General\n\nBarr knew, of course, about this investigation and decided to keep it\n\nsecret before the election in conformance with Justice Department\n\nguidelines, not to interfere in elections.\n\nDo you think Barr was right to do that?\n\nSCALISE: Look, again, this is one of those things that -- that sows more\n\ndistrust. You know, President Trump was laying this out. A \"New York Post,\"\n\nthis was the infamous \"New York Post\" front page story that Twitter blocked\n\nbecause Twitter said it wasn't valid. I think you yourself even said you\n\nexpressed concern about this story. Many of the mainstream media were\n\nmocking people who were putting this story out there and it turns out it\n\nlooks like it was true. And, again, this -- this is something that's very\n\nserious. We need -- and I think people deserve answers to what really\n\nhappened here.\n\nWALLACE: But, well, wait -- sir, they -- we don't know -- we don't know if\n\nanything is true or not. We -- we just know that there's an investigation\n\ngoing on.\n\nLet -- let me ask you a different question. Here is what president --\n\nSCALISE: Right, but -- but even -- yes, but that was being laid out and\n\nthat's where Twitter blocked even the story by \"THE NEW YORK POST.\"\n\nWALLACE: I never blocked it. I -- I, you know, I reported on it.\n\nSCIUTTO: No, Twitter did.\n\nWALLACE: I -- I just said we need -- yes, I understand.\n\nHere's what President-elect Biden says about the Department of Justice in\n\nhis administration.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: It's not my Justice\n\nDepartment. It's the people's Justice Department. So the persons or persons\n\nI pick to run that department are going to be people who are going to have\n\nthe independent capacity to decide who gets prosecuted, who doesn't.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Do you trust Joe Biden -- excuse me -- to continue this\n\ninvestigation when he becomes president and his attorney general is in\n\ncharge after January 20th, to continue the investigation of his son?\n\nSCALISE: Well, I'm sure whoever would be put up for attorney general would\n\nbe heavily scrutinized by the United States Senate. That is the advise and\n\nconsent role that they would play.\n\nBut, again, these are concerns that were laid out during the campaign,\n\nincluding yourself, other people in the media expressed concerns about that\n\nstory and Twitter blocked the distribution of the story and it turns out\n\nthere's a lot of merit to it. Whether it's completely true or not, we're\n\ngoing to find out, but it's being much -- much more widely reported now\n\nafter the election and it's another reason that people have real distrust\n\nin -- in the mainstream media.\n\nWALLACE: Again, just quickly, one of the people who didn't report that\n\nstory was Attorney General Barr, who purposely kept the investigation\n\nquiet.\n\nDo you blame him for doing that?\n\nSCALISE: Well, again, it's very frustrating and I'd love to hear his reason\n\nwhy. But at the same time, you know, you see a lot of these things that are\n\ngoing on and the president was talking about him, other people were talking\n\nabout it too. But then, for various reasons, you saw the mainstream media\n\nwho would block the distribution of those stories.\n\nWALLACE: OK, finally, there's -- there's a lot on the plate here.\n\nCongressman Eric Swalwell, who was warned by federal investigators back in\n\n2015 about his association with Christine Fang, a woman who raised money\n\nfor him, and he was warned that she was allegedly a Chinese spy.\n\nHere's what your House leader, Kevin McCarthy, set about that this week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): This man should not be in the Intel Committee.\n\nHe's jeopardizing national security. What is being said in those meetings\n\ninside the SCIF that we don't want other people to hear or listen\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Final question, I've got less than a minute left, Congressman, do\n\nHouse Republican Leader McCarthy or you have any evidence, hard evidence,\n\nthat Eric Swalwell gave -- did anything wrong in his relationship with this\n\nwoman, knew that she was a spy before he was warned about it and ever gave\n\nher sensitive information?\n\nSCALISE: Well, Chris, these are questions that Eric Swalwell himself needs\n\nto answer, and Speaker Pelosi. Did she know about this before she put him\n\non the House Intelligence Committee? He got on there in just his second\n\nterm. That's not common. You look at all of the relationships with Chinese\n\nspies in the bay area going back to Dianne Feinstein as well. Why did this\n\nhappen? Why, by the way, did Speaker Pelosi block what Kevin McCarthy and a\n\nlot of us were working on in a bipartisan way to get a Chinese task force?\n\nShe was initially supporting it and ultimately she pulled back and blocked\n\nthe Chinese task force that was looking into activities by China.\n\nSo there are a lot of very serious questions to be raised. But at a\n\nminimum, and I agree with our leader, Kevin McCarthy, Eric Swalwell should\n\nnot be on the House Intelligence Committee. And we need some answers now\n\nthat they, for whatever reason, are hiding. They're very quick to go to the\n\nmicrophone and accuse others of being Russian spies. Turned out they were\n\nthe ones that were associating with Chinese spies.\n\nThis is a real alarming revelation that just came out.\n\nWALLACE: Congressman Scalise, thank you. Thanks for coming in, sir. Always\n\ngood to talk with you.\n\nSCALISE: Great to be back with you, Chris. Thanks.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President\n\nTrump's continuing battle to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, I worry about the country\n\nhaving an illegitimate president. That's what I worry about. A president\n\nthat lost. And lost badly. This wasn't like a close election. You look at\n\nGeorgia. We won Georgia big. We won Pennsylvania big. We won Wisconsin big.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: President Trump talking with Brian Kilmeade at the Army-Navy game\n\nyesterday, refusing to give up his fight to overturn the results of the\n\nNovember election.\n\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group.\n\nGOP strategist Karl Rove, Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner, a former\n\nmember of the National Security Council under both Presidents Bush 43 and\n\nObama, and Charles Lane from \"The Washington Post.\"\n\nKarl, as we noted, the Electoral College votes tomorrow and then on January\n\n6th the Congress actually counts the votes and formally declares a winner.\n\nDo you expect President Trump to continue to contest the election past\n\ntomorrow, maybe even past January 6th, and do you think he's either helping\n\nor hurting both himself and the country?\n\nKARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well,\n\nI believe that he will. I wouldn't be surprised to see tomorrow that there\n\nare maybe attempts to disrupt some of the voting in the six contested\n\nstates. I wouldn't be surprised to see expressions of public support for\n\nthe president's position from Trump electors and states that he carried. I\n\nwouldn't be surprised on January 6th -- I fully expect that one senator and\n\none representative at minimum, that's what's required, can file a statement\n\ncontesting the Electoral College results, but I don't see that it's being -\n\n- going to be overturned tomorrow and I don't see that it's going to be\n\noverturned on January 6th.\n\nAs to your second question, it depends on -- you know, the answer to that\n\ndepends upon what's his goal? If his goal is to lay the predicate to come\n\nback in 2024 and run again, he's helping himself at least gain the\n\nnomination, but I think, in the long run, he's not helping himself or the\n\ncountry. America likes comebacks, but they don't like sore losers. And he\n\nis on the edge of looking like a sore loser and probably will look like it\n\nafter January 6th.\n\nWALLACE: I want to put up the results of a new Fox poll. Let's put it up on\n\nthe screen. Was the election stolen from Trump? The third of all voters,\n\nall voters, say yes, as do 77 percent of Trump voters and 68 percent of\n\nRepublicans.\n\nGillian, how bad for the country, when -- if you believe those polls,\n\nmillions of Americans are not going to believe, on January 20th, when he\n\ntakes the oath of office that Joe Biden is the legitimate president?\n\nGILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's more evidence of the two\n\nAmericas that we currently live in, Chris. I will say that the thoughts and\n\nviews and feelings of the Americans represented in that poll do matter.\n\nPublic opinion really counts in American politics, as it should. We don't\n\nwant to discount that.\n\nBut here's the rub. In light of that, the Trump legal team had a very\n\nspecific job to do in the courts in order to get those views represented.\n\nAnd court after court after court has now said the Trump legal team failed\n\nmiserably to get that job done. We now have Trump judges, Obama judges, and\n\nW. Bush -- George W. Bush appointed judges who have all said they failed to\n\nprovide compelling evidence. The type and amount of evidence that would be\n\nneeded in order to disenfranchise their other fellow Americans. So that's\n\nreally what drives the day here.\n\nIt's not going to be, unfortunately for these Americans represented in this\n\npoll, their feelings. That's the way that it is, because they don't believe\n\nthat President Biden won this election fair and square does not mean that\n\nby default President Trump is going to get a second term.\n\nWALLACE: Chuck, how do you answer the Trump supporters, and we just showed\n\npictures, there were thousands of them out in the streets in demonstrations\n\nin D.C. yesterday, how do you answer those Trump supporter that say,\n\nlisten, before you -- you get all upset about what we're doing to Joe\n\nBiden, remember the millions of supporters of Hillary Clinton and the key\n\nfigures in the intelligence community, and the FBI, and the Justice\n\nDepartment who were undercutting Donald Trump even before he took office?\n\nCHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, I mean, you could even go\n\nfurther and say there were some Democratic numbers of the House who\n\nproposed challenges to the electoral vote during the count, just as Karl\n\nsuggests will happen this time.\n\nBut I think the best answer to them would be that the president had it\n\nwithin his control to assuage, to some extent at least, the concerns of\n\npeople who were willing to give him a hearing and the benefit of the doubt\n\nat the beginning of his term. And if you look at the polling data and --\n\nand the record from that time, there will were people, notwithstanding\n\nthose you may have mentioned, out there in America who were willing to give\n\nPresident Trump a chance, and President Trump did nothing during his four\n\nyears to reach out to people who were at all persuadable and instead\n\ncatered exclusively to his base. He lashed out in vicious terms even\n\nagainst his own appointees, like Jeff Sessions.\n\nAnd so, you know, it may be -- may well be true there was a resistance,\n\nhashtag resistance, but the president, through his own actions, did -- did\n\nabsolutely nothing to, in a way, disprove --\n\nWALLACE: Right.\n\nLANE: To those people that they needed to resist.\n\nWALLACE: So we're beginning to run out of time. I'm going to need quicker\n\nanswers.\n\nI want to talk about Joe Biden, who is putting together his team. Here he\n\nis this week announcing his choice for secretary of defense, retired\n\nGeneral Lloyd Austin.\n\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: I want to thank you,\n\nGeneral Austin, for once more stepping forward to serve your nation. This\n\nis not a -- a post he sought, but I sought him.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Karl, relatively briefly, what do you make of Joe Biden's picks?\n\nWhat do you make of their political leanings? What do you make of their\n\nprospects for confirmation?\n\nROVE: Yes. Most of them are comfort food. They're people that he knows for\n\na long time and he feels comfortable having them around. A few of them are\n\nthrowaways to the hard left, Neera Tanden at OMB, the -- Xavier Becerra,\n\nthe attorney general of California, are -- are in the hard left of the\n\nDemocratic Party, and he's got to have a couple of them. And my sense is\n\nhe's going to have trouble with both of those nominees. And then he's going\n\nto have sort of a bipartisan problem with General Austin, who's a\n\nremarkably gifted individual, don't get me wrong, but he has been out of\n\nthe military for, I think, four years. The requirement under the law is\n\nseven years. So you have to get a specific waiver from Congress. All those\n\nDemocrats who voted against giving a waiver to General Jim Mattis to be\n\nsecretary of defense are now going to be subject to cross pressure. But\n\nsort of three boxes. People he's -- most of them are people he's\n\ncomfortable with. Some of them are people who are technocrats and some of\n\nthem are sort of, you know, I've got to appease the left of the Democratic\n\nParty. So even if they don't have any experience with, say, Health and\n\nHuman Services, I'm going to make Becerra the HHS secretary. Lots of\n\nfireworks.\n\nWALLACE: Chuck, in a somewhat shorter period of time than Karl, what you\n\nmake of the Biden team and someone this week said, you know, instead of a\n\nteam of rivals, he's appointing a team of retreads because so many of them\n\ncome from the Obama administration.\n\nLANE: Well, it's a -- it's a mixed bag. I thank a lot of what Karl said is\n\ntrue. Probably the biggest retread in if -- in that sense is Tom Vilsack,\n\nwho has been Agriculture secretary for eight solid years before and now is\n\nup for another four. He is trying to thread a needle, which is diversity,\n\nloyal to -- to himself, an ability to do the job. And I think he has felt\n\nthat confirmability, strangely, is -- is sort of taking a backseat. I think\n\nNeera Tanden's going to be tough to confirm and General Austin as well.\n\nWALLACE: Real quickly, about 15 seconds, Gillian, you -- who -- who's the\n\none that's in the most trouble getting confirmed?\n\nTURNER: Well, I -- I want -- probably Neera Tanden, but I wanted to just\n\nsay quickly, I kind of disagree with Karl, they're not comfort food, these\n\npeople, they're picked for a very specific reason, and that is their\n\ngovernment know-how. The Biden team's entire MO is to try and scale back\n\nand undo as many Trump policies as they can.\n\nWALLACE: Go to go.\n\nAll right, we're going to work with all of you on the lightning round.\n\nThank you, panel. See you next Sunday.\n\nUp next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" A new social media platform\n\ncausing a stir in the name of free speech.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Twitter has millions of users. FaceBook has billions. But there's\n\na relatively new kid on the block that's creating quite a stir by doing\n\nthings differently.\n\nHere's our \"Power Player of the Week.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER: Parlor is a paradigm shift when it comes to social\n\nmedia. So the idea is that people have the power on social media rather\n\nthan the central authority of the company itself.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): John Matze is CEO of the social networking site\n\nParler.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Parler, it's a fun, new social media app.\n\nWALLACE: In a field dominated by tech giants, it provides a new and\n\nunconventional choice.\n\nMATZE: The idea is free speech, privacy, and data sovereignty. The idea\n\nthat you own your own data and your own experience.\n\nWALLACE: Matze compares the platform to a town square where people can\n\nengage without intervention. Conservatives have flocked to the site as an\n\nalternative to FaceBook and Twitter, which they say censored their voices.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): How is speech more free on your platform than some of\n\nthe others?\n\nMATZE: On Parler, when you say something, it goes out to everybody that's\n\nfollowing you instantly. And in the order that you've set it. Other places\n\ndon't do that and they give preferential treatment to some content over\n\nothers.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Parler does have a few rules, like banning\n\ncommunication to commit a crime. But here's what you won't see.\n\nMATZE: Censoring people like you would on Twitter, kicking them off like\n\nthey did, you know, \"The New York Post.\"\n\nWALLACE: The platform also talks a different language.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): Instead of a tweet on Parler, it's a --\n\nMATZE: Parlay.\n\nWALLACE: And a retweet is a --\n\nMATZE: Echo.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Over the past two months and the election, Parler\n\nmembership has exploded, from 4.5 million accounts to more than 12 million.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): Why do you think that is? More than double.\n\nMATZE: I think recently it's become more clear to people the differences in\n\nsocial media, but it's -- it's more of a movement.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): One that has come with controversy.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): The flipside of free speech is that you get racist\n\nslurs, you get violent threats, you get pornography. Any problem with that?\n\nMATZE: So things that are illegal in the United States are not allowed on\n\nthe platform. Thanks that people don't like in society, nasty racial slurs,\n\nthings of that nature, that doesn't get picked up.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): President Trump is demanding Congress eliminate\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Act, which gives social media special\n\nprotection for its content. This is one area where Matze joins Twitter and\n\nFaceBook.\n\nMATZE: Section 230 is the only thing protecting free speech online now. Are\n\nthere ways to fix it? Possibly. But I don't think a universal removal of\n\n230 is -- is the right answer.\n\nWALLACE: But as social media and political divides continue to grow, Matze\n\nbelieves Parler's separate path is the right one.\n\nMATZE: For me, it's getting discussion back into the people's hands. Let's\n\nsee people communicate. Let's do it in the spirit of, you know, the First\n\nAmendment. Let's do it in the spirit of what our republic is about and\n\nreally, you know, change things.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: Matze says Parler will soon release a new feature called \"Dens\" to\n\nhelp expand discussion on the platform beyond politics.\n\nAnd that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS\n\nSUNDAY.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL\n\nRIGHTS RESERVED.
