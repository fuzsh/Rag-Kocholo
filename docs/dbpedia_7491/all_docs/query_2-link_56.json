        "text": "It depends. Like all technology, wireless routers are continually improved and updated so performance could be based on the age and type of router. We recommend that you check your wireless router with a “speed test” to ensure you are receiving the best performance from your new speed, and upgrade your router if necessary.\n\nFor more information, watch this helpful Tech Tip video.\n\nWe're using the internet more than ever before. In fact, the average household already has more than twenty connected devices, and some experts project that number will triple in the next few years. Gaming consoles, smartphones, tablets, PC’s, thermostats, doorbells, security cameras, smart TV’s, streaming media devices (Amazon Fire Stick TV, Apple TV, etc) and many, many more devices are becoming part of our everyday lives. And, with the whole family using your home's internet at the same time, the more bandwidth (speed) you have the more you can do, without lagging or buffering.\n\nOrder or upgrade to the Gig today\n\nWe suggest you do, in order to get the most from your Fi-Speed Internet service. More people are using their Wi-Fi network to access video content like app-based EPB Fi TV, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix and more. Plus, internet-connected devices like security cameras, gaming consoles, smart locks, baby monitors, smart thermostats, smart appliances and more – running all at the same time – can create additional drag on Wi-Fi networks. Studies suggest that households will soon average about 30 connected devices. So to help you make the most of your EPB Fiber Optics internet, in-home Wi-Fi network set up, maintenance and support provided by EPB Smart Net Plus is more important than ever.\n\nLearn more.\n\nKeep routers away from microwave ovens, wireless phones and other major appliances. Also, locating your router near brick walls, floors, ceilings and other obstacles that can impede the signal. Also, change the router channel from the factory default setting to another option in order to differentiate your signal from those of your neighbors.\n\nFor more information, watch this helpful Tech Tip video.\n\nFirst, our technicians will make a “pre-installation consultation” to assess certain aspects of your home. This includes discovering the locations and specifications of your computer and router (if you have a wireless network) to ensure both will deliver that kind of speed. We will determine the best path to run new Ethernet wiring, which is required to handle 10-Gig Internet. And, we will work with you to determine the best possible location for the special ONT box we will need to install inside of your home in order for you to receive 10-Gig service. Afterwards, we will schedule the actual installation with you for another time. Both visits can be scheduled at your convenience.\n\nOrder now.\n\nSometime between the time you order and your installation appointment we will mount an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) box outside of your home near your existing electric meter. There’s no need for you to be at home but we may need access to a part of your home that is fenced or houses a family pet. If so, we will conduct this phase during the most convenient time for you and your pet. During your scheduled installation appointment, someone age 18 or older will need to be home. Typical installations take from 2-5 hours. During this visit, we will be running fiber optic service from the outdoor ONT box to indoor connections designated for internet, TV and/or phone service. When installation is complete, all work areas will be cleaned and returned to their original state. Our EPB Fiber Optics technicians will transfer your email contacts.\n\nMore than ten times faster than the national average for broadband and more than three times our starting speed for just $10 more per month. To give you an example of this speed, you can download a two-hour movie in about 35 seconds. This speed ensures flawless streaming, no-lag gaming, and super fast downloading and uploading on multiple devices at the same time.\n\nLearn more.\n\nYes. To help you make the most of your EPB Fiber Optics internet, our EPB Smart Network service includes in-home WiFi network set up, maintenance and support by EPB experts anytime day or night. Our professionals will provide the equipment, expertise and support to install and maintain a Wi-Fi network to help you maximize your home's wireless signal. More people are using their Wi-Fi network to access video content like the EPB Fi TV app, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix and more. Plus, internet-connected devices like security cameras, gaming consoles, smart locks, baby monitors, smart thermostats, smart appliances and more – running all at the same time – can create additional drag on Wi-Fi networks. So at just $9.99 per month (plus tax), EPB Smart Network is a wise addition to your home's internet service.\n\nLearn more.\n\nSetting up a home Wi-Fi network is the perfect way to share the internet throughout your home on various connected devices, and it’s as easy as purchasing a wireless router.\n\nFor our 300 Mbps Internet service, we recommend an “80.11n dual band” router. These routers allow access to connections from 2.4Ghz up to 5Ghz and range in price from $80 to $100 at most electronics retailers.\n\nFor our Gig customers, we highly recommend a Wi-Fi 6 “802.11ax” router. This is the next generation in Wi-Fi technology capable of delivering gig speeds and handling the growing number of devices in your home. They range in price from $120 to over $450. Our EPB Tech Pros are always available to provide helpful guidance during your search.\n\nPlug the wireless router into the indoor modem box EPB-installed Ethernet wall outlet using a Cat5 Ethernet cable (included with the router) and then simply follow the instructions provided by the router manufacturer on setting up your own home WiFi network.\n\nFor the Gig, we suggest a Wi-Fi router that says it's \"Gig-capable, such as a dual band “802.11ac” router. In fact, an 802.11ac router is best for maximum performance at any speed – especially in larger homes with multiple internet devices and users. Avoid any products that say \"modem\" or \"cable modem\" as these products will not work with fiber optics technology. Gig2.5 comes with EPB Smart Net Plus Wi-Fi included.\n\nEPB Smart Net Plus Wi-Fi service includes the right router professionally installed, network setup optimized for maximum Wi-Fi performance in every corner of your home, advanced security, an app that helps you control your network, and anytime expert support starting at just $14.99 (plus tax) per month.\n\nLearn More\n\nEPB Smart Net Plus is the latest generation of Wi-Fi. The advanced Wi-Fi 6 technology provides full coverage and the ability to deliver maximized speeds throughout the entire home. The network self-optimizes connectivity to efficiently meet bandwidth needs for each device. It can also automatically detect Wi-Fi problems and delivers the fastest in-home Wi-Fi on the market today.\n\nThe built-in best-in-class security provides extra measures to protect your network from malicious online threats. Self-adapting AI continuously scans over 27 billion URLs and 600 million domains to protect your online accounts and devices from malware, phishing, spam and harmful or intrusive advertising.\n\nEver wish it was easier to manage your Wi-Fi? With just a few taps, the accompanying HomePass app lets you easily control your Wi-Fi and connected devices from the palm of your hand. It works like a universal remote for your Wi-Fi network and gives you high-level visibility into your home’s connectivity. View security events, check signal strengths, run speed tests, and create guest networks or passwords. Plus, parents can remotely enforce internet timeouts, schedule bedtime or screen-free periods and create child-friendly website filters.\n\nThe new Smart Net Plus is more than just a warp-speed router — it also comes with a full array of the latest networking technology to give you the best possible Wi-Fi coverage, including supplemental extenders that carry your Wi-Fi signal throughout your home to completely eliminate deadzones. As part of your Smart Net Plus subscription, your EPB Tech Pro will visit your home at your convenience and install your worry-free, wall-to-wall Wi-Fi network so you don’t have to lift a finger. We’ll also connect your devices, show you how to use the HomePass app, and make no-cost return visits to connect any devices you add in the future. Plus, we’ll provide local, ongoing, concierge-level technical support 24/7/365.\n\nSmart Net Plus comes with up to three Wi-Fi extenders that transmit your signal to provide complete coverage in most homes. If your home requires more Wi-Fi extenders for expanded coverage, additional pods will add $4.99 each, per month to your monthly subscription.\n\nYour EPB Tech Pro will make sure you have the right number of extenders for complete coverage in your home for all your devices. If you experience any deadzones or areas with weakened signal, an EPB Tech Pro will visit your home and correct the issue at no extra charge.\n\nSmart Net Plus lets you connect to your Wi-Fi in three different ways.\n\n“Home connections” allow unlimited access to all devices on your network. You should only connect your own devices using this password, and share it exclusively with people you completely trust.\n\n“Guest access” is limited to internet connectivity and devices that you select. For example, you can allow guests to connect to your media streaming device in your guest room, but block connections to all other devices.\n\n“Internet only” means the device can access the internet, but it can’t connect to other devices on the Wi-Fi network.\n\nNo one knows how much or how little access you’ve given them unless you share this information. Your guests can connect to the same network name you’re connected to, but their Guest password enforces the customizable privacy settings you selected.\n\nIn order to ensure the best possible Wi-Fi performance for your devices, EPB Tech ProsSM will install your Smart Net Plus service free of charge. We’ll make sure you have a strong signal in every room and help you connect each and every device you own. We’ll also help you install optional anti-virus software on your devices, set up the HomePass app and return to your home at no charge should you need further assistance.\n\nWhile antivirus software protects your devices when you visit malicious websites, click an unsafe link or download infected files, Smart Net Plus takes it a step further to secure your entire home network before a virus is downloaded. AI-powered, best-in-class network security prevents threats from infecting your devices in the first place. Antivirus is similar to treating an illness once you’ve caught it, while Smart Net Plus security is similar to preventative care, like wearing a mask or washing your hands. They both help keep you safe.\n\nThe built-in best-in-class security protects your network from malicious online threats before they are installed on your devices. Self-adapting AI continuously scans over 27 billion URLs and 600 million domains to protect your online accounts and devices from malware, phishing, spam, and harmful or intrusive advertising.\n\nIt also monitors your network for communication anomalies on your smart devices. It knows who your devices normally communicate to (i.e., your camera talks to the manufacturer). If your device tries to communicate with someone it shouldn’t, like a hacker or scammer, it automatically blocks that communication or quarantines the device, notifying EPB and you. It even looks for nefarious activity on a particular device at a nationwide level to identify bugs and security vulnerabilities and notifies the manufacturers. Smart Net Plus provides protection for every device in your home whether or not it has antivirus software installed.\n\nYou can control your entire Wi-Fi experience through the Smart Net Plus HomePass App. With just a few taps, the accompanying HomePass app lets you easily manage your Wi-Fi and connected devices from the palm of your hand. It works like a universal remote control for your Wi-Fi and gives you high-level visibility into your home’s network.\n\nYou can view security events, check signal strengths, run speed tests, and create guest networks or passwords. You can even change your network name, passwords, and guest access. You can rename your extenders and devices to make them easier to identify. You can also reserve IP addresses for devices and set port-forwarding rules.\n\nPlus, parents can remotely enforce internet timeouts, create kid-friendly filters, set up scheduling (including bedtimes), enable notifications and set up motion controls using your devices for detection.\n\nLearn more about the HomePass app here.\n\nBegin by creating a profile for every member of your household and match them to their personal devices. This is easier than it may sound, since your devices are automatically recognized and named. You can also choose to create custom nicknames for each device.\n\nEasily customize internet schedules for each member of your household and grant them different levels of online protection. You can add the same safeguards to shared family devices and pause the internet for a member of the family, a specific device, or your entire home.\n\nNotifications on your smart phone alert you when someone tries to access something they shouldn’t. You can also review any alerts you missed.\n\nYes. You can remotely review your parental controls in the HomePass app, even when away from your home network. You can enable notifications that alert you if anyone tries to access prohibited parental control settings. You can even see who has been using your network — Smart Net Plus keeps a record of all the devices that have connected to your network.\n\nSmart Net Plus will support speeds of up to 2.5 Gigs to the router connected to your Ethernet port. However, your Wi-Fi speed is always a little bit slower than hard-wired speed. While your internet connection is providing top speeds to your home, it’s important to remember that each of your devices has different capabilities. The age and model of your device may limit the speed to a lower number than your home receives. For example, an iPhone 8 can only download at 867 Mbps in perfect conditions, an iPhone 7 at 450 Mbps and an iPhone 6 at 300 Mbps — these speeds cannot increase past these maximums no matter how fast your internet is.\n\nSmart Net Plus recognizes your device type, model and version, where you are using it and how many other devices are being actively used so it can optimize your bandwidth to provide the best performance for each device.\n\nSmart Net Plus delivers the fastest Wi-Fi speeds available on the market today.\n\nOnce you notify EPB to transfer your internet service to a new location, we will schedule a new installation appointment to re-install your EPB Smart Net Plus equipment.\n\nIf you are moving out of our network area and will no longer be an EPB customer, your Smart Net Plus equipment will need to be returned. There will be a $100 charge for each router/extender that is not returned.\n\nIf for any reason you do not like Smart Net Plus, please reach out to our customer support team. They will make sure you are getting the most out of Smart Net Plus, identify and solve any problems you are experiencing or help you adjust your service to better suit your specific needs.\n\nIf you’re still unhappy with your service, you can cancel your service at any time and return all pods associated with the account. There will be a $100 charge for each router/extender that is not returned.\n\nSince Smart Net Plus wi-fi is included at no extra charge, you get a professionally installed Wi-Fi 6 router with the Homepass app and lots of extra features with Gig2.5. If you would like to opt out of this service and use your own router, the price will remain the same, and we will send you recommended router specs for models built to support speeds up to 2,500 Mbps to ensure you’re getting the full value of the broadband we deliver to your home.\n\nOn the day of your installation, an EPB Tech Pro will determine the best location for your router(s) to assure Smart Net Plus delivers excellent connectivity to every corner of your home. Someone will need to be home for your installation to take place (unless you're not taking advantage of receiving Smart Net Plus at no extra charge). Having someone at home also gives us the opportunity to test your service to ensure you get great coverage after installation. If you require a new ONT to receive Gig2.5 internet, that installation will be done prior to this process and no one needs to be home for that part, but we will knock on the door to let anyone who may be home know we're there. Additionally, we're available 24/7 /365 to troubleshoot any problems. We'll even send an EPB Tech Pro back to your home at no extra charge if you ever need on-site support, including help installing new connected devices.\n\nMost devices do not currently support 2.5 Gig speeds. However, if you have a device that is capable of reaching 2.5 Gig speeds over a LAN connection, here are two solutions we recommend:\n\nOption 1: Disconnect the router and connect your device directly to your wall’s ethernet jack using a cat5e ethernet cable (or better). If you don’t have one, let us know — our EPB Tech Pros can provide one by request during your installation. The downside is that your other devices won’t be able to connect to Wi-Fi while your router is unplugged.\n\nOption 2: Research and purchase a personal network device with LAN ports that will deliver 2.5 Gig speeds.\n\nIt depends. Like all technology, wireless routers are continually improved and updated so performance could be based on the age and type of router. We recommend that you check your wireless router with a “speed test” to ensure you are receiving the best performance from your new speed, and upgrade your router if necessary.\n\nFor more information, watch this helpful Tech Tip video.\n\nThere are many reasons why you may not be achieving Gigabit speeds. Let's start by pointing out that the best way to get the maximum internet speed is to connect your computer directly to the EPB Fiber Optics jack using a Cat 5e ethernet wire. Keep in mind that advertised speeds can rarely be achieved on WiFi because the signal strength diluted over a wireless network. If you're using a WiFi router, there are several factors that can affect your performance. The age and type of wireless router, as well as its placement in your home are determining factors of speed and performance. And, like all technology, wireless routers are continually improved and updated for better performance. If you're using older equipment that wasn't made to handle such speeds, we recommend that you upgrade your router and computer if necessary.\n\nFor more information, watch this helpful Tech Tip video. If you're still having trouble, give us a call anytime at 423-648-1372.\n\nWe're using the internet more than ever before.

The 2.4 GHz frequency has a longer range, which means it will project your WiFi signal further away from the router - even through barriers like walls. The 5 GHz transmits a shorter signal, but at a faster speed. A \"mesh network\" combines the two frequencies for an optimized experience on most devices.\n\nAnd, EPB Fiber Optics’ Smart Network whole-home WiFi solution makes creating and maintaining a WiFi network easy.

Self-adapting AI continuously scans over 27 billion URLs and 600 million domains to protect your online accounts and devices from malware, phishing, spam, and harmful or intrusive advertising.\n\nIt also monitors your network for communication anomalies on your smart devices. It knows who your devices normally communicate to (i.e., your camera talks to the manufacturer). If your device tries to communicate with someone it shouldn’t, like a hacker or scammer, it automatically blocks that communication or quarantines the device, notifying EPB and you. It even looks for nefarious activity on a particular device at a nationwide level to identify bugs and security vulnerabilities and notifies the manufacturers. Smart Net Plus provides protection for every device in your home whether or not it has antivirus software installed.\n\nYou can control your entire Wi-Fi experience through the Smart Net Plus HomePass App. With just a few taps, the accompanying HomePass app lets you easily manage your Wi-Fi and connected devices from the palm of your hand. It works like a universal remote control for your Wi-Fi and gives you high-level visibility into your home’s network.\n\nYou can view security events, check signal strengths, run speed tests, and create guest networks or passwords. You can even change your network name, passwords, and guest access. You can rename your extenders and devices to make them easier to identify. You can also reserve IP addresses for devices and set port-forwarding rules.\n\nPlus, parents can remotely enforce internet timeouts, create kid-friendly filters, set up scheduling (including bedtimes), enable notifications and set up motion controls using your devices for detection.\n\nLearn more about the HomePass app here.\n\nBegin by creating a profile for every member of your household and match them to their personal devices. This is easier than it may sound, since your devices are automatically recognized and named. You can also choose to create custom nicknames for each device.\n\nEasily customize internet schedules for each member of your household and grant them different levels of online protection. You can add the same safeguards to shared family devices and pause the internet for a member of the family, a specific device, or your entire home.\n\nNotifications on your smart phone alert you when someone tries to access something they shouldn’t. You can also review any alerts you missed.\n\nYes. You can remotely review your parental controls in the HomePass app, even when away from your home network. You can enable notifications that alert you if anyone tries to access prohibited parental control settings. You can even see who has been using your network — Smart Net Plus keeps a record of all the devices that have connected to your network.\n\nSmart Net Plus will support speeds of up to 2.5 Gigs to the router connected to your Ethernet port. However, your Wi-Fi speed is always a little bit slower than hard-wired speed. While your internet connection is providing top speeds to your home, it’s important to remember that each of your devices has different capabilities. The age and model of your device may limit the speed to a lower number than your home receives. For example, an iPhone 8 can only download at 867 Mbps in perfect conditions, an iPhone 7 at 450 Mbps and an iPhone 6 at 300 Mbps — these speeds cannot increase past these maximums no matter how fast your internet is.\n\nSmart Net Plus recognizes your device type, model and version, where you are using it and how many other devices are being actively used so it can optimize your bandwidth to provide the best performance for each device.\n\nSmart Net Plus delivers the fastest Wi-Fi speeds available on the market today.\n\nOnce you notify EPB to transfer your internet service to a new location, we will schedule a new installation appointment to re-install your EPB Smart Net Plus equipment.\n\nIf you are moving out of our network area and will no longer be an EPB customer, your Smart Net Plus equipment will need to be returned. There will be a $100 charge for each router/extender that is not returned.\n\nIf for any reason you do not like Smart Net Plus, please reach out to our customer support team. They will make sure you are getting the most out of Smart Net Plus, identify and solve any problems you are experiencing or help you adjust your service to better suit your specific needs.\n\nIf you’re still unhappy with your service, you can cancel your service at any time and return all pods associated with the account. There will be a $100 charge for each router/extender that is not returned.\n\nLifeline is a government assistance program which provides eligible low-income subscribers an opportunity to receive the Lifeline benefit on certain voice and broadband internet access services. Like ACP, the Lifeline benefit is nontransferable, only eligible consumers may enroll in the program, and the program is limited to one Lifeline benefit per household.\n\nIf you currently receive a Lifeline benefit, you automatically qualify for the ACP, and you can receive both benefits at the same time. Both benefits can be applied to the same qualifying service or separately with the same or different providers. For example, an eligible household could have a Lifeline-supported wireless phone service and a separate home internet service that is supported through the Affordable Connectivity Program.\n\nYes. You can also combine these benefits with other state and local benefits where available. They can be applied to the same qualifying service or separately to a Lifeline service and an Affordable Connectivity Program service with the same or different providers. For example, an eligible household could have a Lifeline-supported mobile phone service and a separate home internet service that is supported through the Affordable Connectivity Program.\n\nIf you move while receiving the ACP benefit, you should contact the National Verifier at 877-384-2575 after you move to verify ACP eligibility at your new address. After the National Verifier has reverified your benefit, you should visit EPB.com or text or call EPB at 423-648-1372 to check service availability at your new address.\n\nThe ACP stopped accepting new enrollments as of February 7, 2024. We have also received notice that funding for this program has the potential to run out by April of this year (2024). If the fund is depleted and no further action is taken by the United States government, all households participating in the program will no longer receive the $30 discount after their April 2024 internet bill.\n\nYes, if you applied online at AffordableConnectivity.gov or by mail and have been approved, forward your National Verifier application ID to EPB Customer Service. EPB representatives will add this discount to your account and email you when completed. If you are already approved for Lifeline, there is no need to re-apply for ACP. You’re automatically eligible. Let us know you already have Lifeline, we’ll verify it and apply your ACP benefit.\n\nIf you submit an application to the Affordable Connectivity Program Support Center by mail, you will receive updates by mail regarding your application status (or by email if you provided an email address on your application). For example, USAC will contact you if additional information or documents are needed, and if your application has been approved. You may also visit affordableconnectivity.gov or call 877-384-2575 for application status.\n\nOnly one monthly ACP service discount is allowed per household. According to ACP, a “household\" is defined as any individual or group of individuals who live together at the same address as one economic unit. An \"economic unit\" is defined as \"all adult individuals contributing to and sharing in the income and expenses of a household.\" Examples of a “household” may include a married couple, or a parent/guardian and child, or adults (family or friends) living together.\n\nEPB doesn’t determine eligibility for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). Therefore, we won’t know why your application might’ve been denied. One possibility is that the ACP stopped accepting new enrollments as of February 7, 2024. If you qualified for the ACP but did not order internet by February 7, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. ET, you can no longer enroll in the ACP. For more information about your application, please visit affordableconnectivity.gov or call 877-384-2575.\n\nSince Smart Net Plus wi-fi is included at no extra charge, you get a professionally installed Wi-Fi 6 router with the Homepass app and lots of extra features with Gig2.5. If you would like to opt out of this service and use your own router, the price will remain the same, and we will send you recommended router specs for models built to support speeds up to 2,500 Mbps to ensure you’re getting the full value of the broadband we deliver to your home.\n\nMost internet services offer a higher download speed than upload speed, meaning you may experience fast internet when doing things such as surfing the web or streaming but may lag and have poor quality when doing an activity like having a video meeting or posting online. EPB's fiber optics offers equal download and upload speeds to assure that no matter what you're doing, your internet is fast and reliable.\n\nOn the day of your installation, an EPB Tech Pro will determine the best location for your router(s) to assure Smart Net Plus delivers excellent connectivity to every corner of your home. Someone will need to be home for your installation to take place (unless you're not taking advantage of receiving Smart Net Plus at no extra charge). Having someone at home also gives us the opportunity to test your service to ensure you get great coverage after installation. If you require a new ONT to receive Gig2.5 internet, that installation will be done prior to this process and no one needs to be home for that part, but we will knock on the door to let anyone who may be home know we're there. Additionally, we're available 24/7 /365 to troubleshoot any problems. We'll even send an EPB Tech Pro back to your home at no extra charge if you ever need on-site support, including help installing new connected devices.\n\nNo, Smart Net Plus is included at no additional charge with Gig2.5 to ensure you receive the best possible performance from your internet speeds. If you would like to opt out, we will be happy to provide the recommended specs for router models that can support Gig2.5 internet.\n\nThe best way to test your speed is through the Smart Net Plus accompanying HomePass app's speed test, which will reflect the most accurate wireless speed. Speed tests are always most accurate at the ethernet cord coming into the home, due to the many variables involved in wireless speed testing. Also, many individual connected devices (including smart phones) can't utilize 2,500 Mbps. Speed test results can vary for several reasons depending on the test you use and how many other devices may be connected to your Wi-Fi.\n\nMost devices do not currently support 2.5 Gig speeds. However, if you have a device that is capable of reaching 2.5 Gig speeds over a LAN connection, here are two solutions we recommend:\n\nOption 1: Disconnect the router and connect your device directly to your wall’s ethernet jack using a cat5e ethernet cable (or better). If you don’t have one, let us know — our EPB Tech Pros can provide one by request during your installation. The downside is that your other devices won’t be able to connect to Wi-Fi while your router is unplugged.\n\nOption 2: Research and purchase a personal network device with LAN ports that will deliver 2.5 Gig speeds.\n\nWe want to ensure that our customers have the best possible internet service. We look to provide high-quality products at a price that remains affordable for a wide variety of customer needs.\n\nWhen choosing a router for our 2.5 Gig product, we made a choice to focus on providing the best whole-home connectivity product available, rather than prioritizing super-fast connectivity to a single device. Additionally, we opt to provide Opensync devices for our Smart Net Plus Wi-Fi customers. Opensync offers a variety of benefits for both our employees and customers, including:\n\nHomePass customer application for at-home Wi-Fi management.\n\nFeatures customers want, such as parental controls and ad-blocking.\n\nImproved network visibility for support technician troubleshooting.\n\nEasily add more features in the future & possible new products.\n\nAt this time, there are no OpenSync routers that offer a 2.5 Gig LAN port. However, technology continues to evolve and we are continuously looking for equipment that will help us provide our customers with the world-class experience we’re known for.\n\nTechnology is constantly evolving, and we are continuously looking for equipment that will help us provide our customers with the world-class experience we’re known for. As new devices are released, we will continue to test new devices to help us ensure we are meeting the needs of the broadest range of customers.\n\nData allowances refer to any caps or usage limits imposed by the broadband plan. EPB has never imposed a data cap and customers will be able to see how these limits with other providers may vary depending on the plan and can affect a customer's internet usage and overall experience. The labels provide clarity on how data allowances are calculated and any associated overage charges."
