There will be empty space on the left and right side of your presentation if you use 4:3.\n\nComputer\n\nThere will be a laptop and mouse on the podium giving you direct access to your file.

The light will turn from GREEN to YELLOW when you have to wrap up and go to Q&A and take questions When the light turns to RED, you must stop. Your time is up.
