Recent examples include:\n\nUPS shipment – claims you have a package on hold, need to reschedule and pay an extra fee\n\nCostco survey – invited to take survey and win a reward (typical iPhone, smart watch, etc.)\n\nAmazon security alert – “Your account has been accessed from another device, click here to verify”\n\nPassword expiration – impersonating several well-known companies claiming you need to update password\n\nTips to stay safe:\n\nNever, ever, ever click on links in unsolicited text messages or emails.\n\nOnly use official websites or apps.\n\nFree gifts are always a red flag.\n\nConsider using security software that helps safeguard against malicious and fraudulent websites, as well as viruses and spyware.\n\nSummer Travel Safety\n\nWhen you’re on vacation this summer, don’t take a vacation from keeping you and your money safe. Here are a few tips to help prevent fraud:\n\nWhen booking travel, stick to name brand travel sites or book directly with the airline, hotel, or car rental; avoid unsolicited email deals.\n\nConsider a mail hold – visit usps.com/manage/hold-mail.htm for details.\n\nUse a credit card, not cash or debit card, for added fraud/theft protection; make sure your bank or credit card company has your current email/phone to notify you in case of fraud.\n\nLock your smart phone or tablet (with biometrics or six-digit code), turn off automatic connection to Wi-Fi, use only cellular data or private, password-protected Wi-Fi, and avoid unsecured public Wi-Fi; consider using a VPN client.\n\nWatch out for data skimmers at public charging stations; bring your own portable charger.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nPhishing Email Trends and QR Codes (05/11/23)\n\nPhishing Email Trends\n\nDuring the past few weeks, the most prevalent threat type seen in phishing email attachments can be classified as FakePage, at just over 60%. Fake pages are web pages where cybercriminals imitate the screen layout, logo, and font of the real login pages or advertising pages, leading users to enter their account and password information. The input information is sent to the criminal’s server, or used to induce victims to access other fake websites. InfoStealers were second in line, at around 15%. This form of malware resides on your computer and gathers data saved in web browsers, emails, and social media accounts, and leaks it to the attacker.\n\nThe majority of these phishing emails contain hyperlinks to direct you to launch the malware, or send you to a fake website. Some of the most common subject lines include:\n\nUpgrade required\n\nFedEx / UPS / DHL shipment notice\n\nInvoice\n\nUrgent\n\nOverdue payment\n\nDeactivation notice\n\nCongratulations\n\nAttacks using phishing emails are disguised with content that can easily deceive users, such as invoices and shipping notices, to induce users to access fake login pages or execute malware. Fake login pages are constantly evolving to closely resemble the original pages. The attackers pack malware in compressed file formats to escape the attachment scans of users’ security products. To mitigate the risks of these cyber threats:\n\nDo not click on links and attachments in emails from unverified senders.\n\nDo not enter sensitive data, such as login account credentials or financial information, unless you’re confident you’re on the legitimate site.\n\nDo not click on email attachments with unfamiliar file extensions.\n\nUse a comprehensive anti-virus software and update it regularly.\n\nAnother threat to be aware of are Disguised Image Files. This type of malware is an executable file disguised as an image (eg. image.gif.pif) that is designed to initiate a computer worm. Worms can spread across devices on a network and install spyware and ransomware, delete files, and steal data. Typically, cybercriminals arouse the curiosity of users through eye-catching messages to entice users to click on what appear to be links to images, but in reality, execute the malware. As such, users are advised to take closer looks at the file names of email attachments before opening them and also check if the attachments are related to the subject of the email.\n\nThe Dangers of QR codes\n\nAs QR codes continue to be heavily used by legitimate organizations, scammers have adapted to abuse this technology for their criminal purposes. A QR (quick response) code is a two-dimensional bar code that can be used for a variety of applications, including opening a web page.\n\nScammers may post QR codes at restaurants, public venues, or even on your car’s windshield, trying to entice you to scan the code. They may promise a discount or offer free stuff – in reality, they are after your data; or worse, they will convince you to download a third-party app that could drain you bank account.\n\nUse caution when scanning QR codes, especially those posted in public places.\n\nNever download an app using a QR code; use your phone’s app store instead.\n\nAnd don’t download a QR reader – most phones have a built-in scanner in the camera.\n\nAvoid using QR codes to pay bills, or access financial websites.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nSearching with Google and Phishing Texts (04/27/23)\n\nBe Careful When Searching with Google\n\nWith about 80-90% of the online search market share, Google is undoubtedly the most popular search engine – no other service comes close. The word “google” has become a verb, synonymous with performing an internet query; and Google.com is the most visited website in the world.\n\nAccording to the most recent statistics, over 90,000 Google searches occur every second…that’s almost 8 billion searches per day. This popularity, unfortunately, means that cybercriminals have found ways to exploit Google’s dominance to victimize unsuspecting users.\n\nCybercriminals are incredibly creative when trying to trick people into visiting counterfeit websites or clicking on malicious links. One of their tactics is to try to get malicious sponsored ads to appear in Google search results. Typically, a website’s ranking in Google searches depends on several factors, such as monthly users, trustworthiness and the frequency of content. But that ranking can easily be circumvented by paying for a website to rank higher.\n\nBecause these sponsored links occur at the top of the search results, people are more inclined to click these links, not realizing it’s a sponsored ad. And since Google doesn’t vet everyone who buys an ad, clicking these sponsored results can be dangerous. They can direct you to imposter websites designed to collect your personal information, or they can download malicious software to your device.\n\nThese threats affect businesses and consumers alike. Businesses can be targeted for ransomware attacks; criminals also want your personal data.\n\nHere are three tips on how to mitigate this risk:\n\nAvoid clicking on sponsored links – instead type the web address directly into your browser.\n\nIf you’re unsure about a link, hover over it to see where it goes.\n\nSometimes clicking on a link will result in a pop-up claiming you have a virus – this is almost always a scam. Never call the number or click on any links included in the message. Instead, close your browser immediately and run a scan using your anti-virus software; make sure your AVS is up-to-date.\n\nPhishing Text Messages\n\nReminder: The police department has received several reports of phishing text messages recently, claiming to be from a government agency or well-known companies. NEVER, NEVER, EVER CLICK THESE LINKS. Instead, if you think there might be a problem, use the website or phone number you now to be legitimate to contact that organization directly.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) Review (04/13/23)\n\nThe Internet of Things describes a class of devices with built-in network connectivity that are able to send and receive data. These devices are present in manufacturing, health care, government, and in our homes. The most common IoT device is a cell phone – some other common household examples include:\n\nHome hubs, like Amazon Alexa and Google Home\n\nTelevisions and speakers\n\nSecurity cameras\n\nThermostats\n\nLight bulbs\n\nRefrigerators\n\nAs the technology advances, things like cars, utility meters, and even medical equipment have been included in IoT’s. The number one concern with using these devices is security. Since the idea of networking all these devices is fairly new, security has not always been a top priority when designing these devices. And unfortunately, many vendors often prioritize ease of use and functionality over security. Many devices like cameras (think baby monitors and security cameras) often come with well-known, default passwords that many end-users do not change. Other devices come with no password. In addition, many end-users forget or simply don’t take the time to update the firmware on the device. Since most IoT devices connect to apps on your smartphone or tablet, make sure you have reputable internet security software installed on these devices. Set-up two-factor authentication, and know what data these apps are collecting, and how they use and store that data.\n\nWhat can you do to add security?\n\nSet-up a secure WiFi router. Your router is like the front door to your home network and needs to be secure. Use a strong encryption method like (WPA2)–WiFi Protected Access and change default usernames and passwords. Also consider setting up a guest network or use a second router (FBI recommendation). This provides increased security. Your fridge and your laptop should not share the same network.\n\nReview the terms of service, default privacy, and security settings of your devices.\n\nResearch products carefully before buying – know what steps the manufacturer has taken to protect your privacy.\n\nUpdate firmware and buy the most up-to-date devices. Avoid used or refurbished devices. Remove old, unsupported devices from your network.\n\nAnother major concern is privacy. Before using one of these devices, educate yourself about the following:\n\nWhat data does the device collect?\n\nCan the data be deleted, or collection disabled?\n\nWhat are the security vulnerabilities?\n\nIs there support for updates?\n\nLog into the device’s app or website and review what data is collected. Consider limiting or regularly deleting the data that is collected.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nPopular Cybersecurity Terms (03/23/23)\n\nWhen discussing strategies for staying safe online, experts may use terms that you are not familiar with. The following is a list of some of the more frequently used terms, and their definitions.\n\nSocial Engineering – The art of manipulating a person to take some action, typically involving a breach of security, sending money, or divulging private information.\n\nPhishing – A social engineering tactic designed to collect sensitive information from victims, such as log-in credentials, credit card information, system configuration details, or other personal identity information. Attack vectors include e-mail, text messages (“smishing”), voice calls (“vishing”), or through social media. Phishing attacks are often successful because they mimic legitimate communications from trusted entities or groups.\n\nMalware – Malicious software. Malware is a general term for any computer code created for the specific purpose of causing harm, disclosing information, or otherwise violating the security or stability of a system. Malware includes a wide range of types of malicious programs including: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware.\n\nSpoofing – The act of falsifying the identity of the source of a communication or interaction. It is possible to spoof a phone number, email address, and IP or MAC address.\n\nVPN (Virtual Private Network) – A secure, often encrypted, connection between a device and another network. A VPN prevents unauthorized people from eavesdropping on your internet traffic and makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activity online.\n\nFirewall – A security device, either hardware (router) or software, that filters network traffic based on pre-established security rules and can block outside threats from gaining access to your computer.\n\nTwo-factor, or Multi-factor, Authentication – A means of verifying a user’s identity by requiring a combination of two or more credentials to access a system or account. Often, valid authentication factors include: (1) something you know, such as a password or PIN; (2) something you have, such as a smart cards or token; and (3) something you are, such as fingerprints or facial scan (aka biometrics).\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nCredit Card Data Leak and Healthcare Fraud (03/09/23)\n\nLarge Credit Card Leak\n\nLast week, a criminal site known as BidenCash, which uses the president’s name and likeness to trade in stolen data on the dark web, leaked over two million credit and debit cards online. The data dump includes full names and unique email addresses, as well as card numbers, including expiration dates and CVV’s (card verification value). Criminals can obviously use this data to commit financial fraud; however, they can also use it to complete dossiers about you using other leaked data to commit identity theft\n\nA consumer advocate organization analyzed the data and estimates approximately 30% of the cards are valid working card numbers. While this number may seem low, that still equates to almost three-quarters of a million card numbers, the majority of which involve Americans.\n\nWhat can you do to protect yourself?\n\nMonitor your card activity – sign-up for alerts (use the bank’s app).\n\nBe wary of phishing attempts related to this data leak.\n\nCheck your credit report at annualcreditreport.com. Sign up for a free Credit Karma account to monitor your credit for free.\n\nConsider a credit freeze.\n\nHealth care fraud\n\nYou may get a bill for medical exams, procedures, and prescription drugs that you never received; or you may receive a call or email regarding your Medicare account. Sometimes providers commit fraud by double-billing, phantom billing, and upcoding. Scammers also use several tactics to get your personal information, including:\n\n“You’re eligible for discounted health insurance.”\n\n“Your Medicare card has expired, or your coverage is about to be cancelled.”\n\n“You qualify for free medical supplies or medication.”\n\nRemember these tips:\n\nNever surrender Social Security, Medicare, or health insurance numbers to anyone you don’t know and trust.\n\nMedicare doesn’t call you – you call them.\n\nReview your EOB’s.\n\nReport suspected fraud to your insurer or Medicare, or to the FBI.\n\nConsider a credit freeze.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nTax Fraud and Local Case Review (02/23/23)\n\nFiling Your Taxes Safely and Securely\n\nYou are ultimately responsible for all the information on your tax return, no matter who prepares it, so choose a tax preparer wisely. Check their qualifications and review your return before the tax preparer signs it; never sign a blank return.\n\nBe wary of W2 phishing scams. Scammers may pose as someone high up in a company or organization and send emails asking for copies of W2 forms. Never send this type of information without verifying the legitimacy of the request.\n\nThere are also numerous IRS phishing scams. Typically, the recipient with receive an “urgent” email claiming to be from the IRS. This usually involves instructions to click on a link and/or fill out a form.\n\nSome tactics include: “IRS needs to update online profile,” “you qualify for a refund,” “your credit card was fraudulently used,” or “you’re due a large sum of money.”\n\nLook for generic greetings, poor grammar or typos, or conflicting web addresses. Never click, download files, or reply. The IRS will never initiate contact via email, text, or social media.\n\nSet up an IP PIN (Identity Protection Personal Information Number) at irs.gov.\n\nReview of Recent PayPal Scam\n\nIn this case, the victim (VC) somehow logged into a fraudulent PayPal account and saw “unauthorized” transactions. The VC called customer service number on website and was prompted to call PayPal security representative, who directed VC to download app. This app allowed the criminal to remotely access VC’s computer under the guise of helping with fraud.\n\nThe criminal advised VC that someone was trying to take out a loan and that VC would be liable and needed VC to cover loan amount while it was investigated – said they’d eventually get money back. He convinced VC to wire transfer two amounts of $33,000 and $17,500, and then convinced VC to make two separate purchases of gift cards, totaling $5,000 each.\n\nVC credit card company denied initial gift card purchase as likely fraudulent, however VC called credit card company to say it was legitimate and the transactions were approved.\n\nThe criminals wanted more money ($22,000), and inquired about retirement accounts. They convinced VC to open online checking account for purpose of transferring money from retirement accounts. Luckily VC did not transfer this additional money and made a report to the police.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nSIM Swapping, Romance Scams, and Tax Fraud (02/09/23)\n\nSIM Swapping\n\nSIM swapping occurs when a criminal is able to take control of your phone service by impersonating you and tricking your service provider into activating a new SIM card, connected to your phone number, on a new phone. They may call your provider and say your phone was lost or damaged and ask to activate the new SIM. Why is this a big deal?\n\nMany of us rely on two-factor authentication to keep our important online accounts secure. Two-factor authentication usually involves receiving a numeric code as a text or email from the account you are trying to access, in order to verify your identity. This is usually a decent form of protection, but if a criminal is able to take over control of your phone number and email, they then have access to those codes and can access your bank accounts, social media accounts, and email.\n\nCurrently, with the number of recent data breaches, particularly involving T-Mobile customers, there is enough information out there for a criminal to pretty easily trick your provider into allowing the account takeover. In late January, T-Mobile announced that it suffered a data breach that began in November 2022 and affected 37 million customers. Criminals got customers’ names, dates of birth, billing addresses and phone numbers, email addresses, account numbers, and service plan details. So, what can you do?\n\nThe good news is, most cell phone service providers offer some security measures to defeat fraudulent SIM swaps. In the case of T-Mobile, they offer services call Account Takeover Protection and SIM Protection. But not all of these services are created equal and offer varying levels of protection. In the end, protecting yourself begins with safe-guarding your personal information:\n\nUse strong and unique passwords and change them often.\n\nEducate yourself about phishing techniques designed to trick you into providing personal information.\n\nDon’t rely on two-factor authentication alone to secure your accounts – consider biometric authentication, authentication apps, and setting up a PIN as added levels of security.\n\nRomance Scams\n\nWith Valentine’s Day approaching, scammers are busy preparing to take advantage of those looking for romance. From fake websites selling romantic gifts to exploiting individuals looking for companionship, scammers utilize a variety of tactics to trick people into giving up their money. The scammer might:\n\nMake excuses why they can’t meet in person.\n\nAsk you to leave a dating site or social media to communicate directly.\n\nRequest money, usually in ways that are hard to trace or get back. NEVER send money to someone you have not met in person.\n\nWhen shopping online, before you make a purchase:\n\nDouble-check reviews for the website.\n\nBe suspicious of “too-good-to-be-true” deals.\n\nUse a credit card – do not pay with Venmo or PayPal.\n\nTax Fraud\n\nVisit our Facebook page for a briefing on tax fraud – click here for more info.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nSafer Internet Day and Three Scams to Be Aware Of (01/26/23)\n\nSafer Internet Day is Tuesday, February 7th. The purpose of this global event is to bring awareness to strategies for creating an internet where people can come together safely to share information and ideas. This year’s theme is “Together for a Better Internet.” A few of the topics being focused on include:\n\nMedia literacy and critical thinking (responsible creation/consumption of information)\n\nCivility (bullying and harassment)\n\nWellness and self-respect (impact of influencers and celebrities)\n\nScams and predators (phishing and child exploitation)\n\nUse this opportunity to talk with your family about how they are using the internet, and discuss the following questions:\n\nWhat are your favorite apps and websites? Who do you follow online? Where do you get your information from?\n\nHow are you protecting your privacy? Do you know how to change the privacy settings on your devices (tracking, location services)? Have you read, and do you understand, the privacy policies of the web sites you visit and the apps you use?\n\nAre you able to spot phishing emails or texts? How to you deal with spam messages?\n\nDo you know how to report abusive or threatening content? Who would you tell?\n\nConnectSafely is the official U.S. host of Safer Internet Day. Their website contains resources to help parents and educators discuss these topics with kids and teens. These resources include parent guides for a variety of apps, services, and platforms that are popular with kids. They also have posted a series of quick guides, some of which are linked below:\n\nCyberbullying\n\nCybersecurity\n\nSafe Online Shopping\n\nSecure Passwords\n\nRansomware\n\nTeen Sexting\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nFive Phishing Scams You Need to Know About (01/12/23)\n\nPhishing is a type of fraud that involves someone trying to trick you into giving scammers personal or financial information, like passwords and credit card numbers. Cybercriminals may do this by sending you an email or text message that looks like it’s from a trusted person or business, or by creating a fake website that looks legitimate. Here are five versions of phishing attacks that involve well-known companies:\n\nAmerican Express (security alert)\n\nYou may receive an email claiming your account is on hold due to outdated or incorrect information. The email includes link to click for account verification, but clicking the link takes you to a fake AmEx page, where scammers can record all the log-in information you submit.\n\nAmazon (security alert)\n\nSimilarly, you may receive a text or email alerting you that your account has been locked due to “suspicious activity” on your account. Clicking on the link will take you to fake log-in page which could expose your account credentials.\n\nNetflix (security alert)\n\nIn this scenario, criminals will send you a text message claiming your Netflix membership has ended due to trouble with account information. The message includes a link to validate your account information, and the link directs you to fake log-in page.\n\nCostco (gift card scam)\n\nThis scam involves receiving an email offering a $90 gift card for participating in online survey. But, by clicking on the links in the email, you will be directed to a fraudulent survey site where you’ll be asked to enter personal information.\n\nWalmart (delivery scam)\n\nFinally, in this example, scammers send text messages informing you that your shipment was delivered to a drop-off point – the message may include a link to view the “pick-up location”. Following the link takes you to fake page where you are asked to enter your address and credit card information, and to take a survey, which may expose additional sensitive information.\n\nYou can identify these scams by looking for these indicators:\n\nMost fraudulent messages contain spelling or grammatical errors.\n\nThese messages convey a sense of urgency.\n\nDouble-check senders email address to see if it matches the organization they claim to be representing.\n\nPay close attention to URL’s – are they legitimate?\n\nTo help prevent yourself from falling for one of these scams:\n\nNever click on any links in unsolicited emails or text messages.\n\nVisit the official website or app instead.\n\nIf you’ve already clicked on a suspicious link, change your password as soon as possible.\n\nConsider a credit freeze.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nHoliday Scams (12/08/22)\n\nBe Mindful of These Holiday Scams:\n\nMisleading social media ads: As you scroll through your social media feed, you often see products advertised. Always research before you buy. There are countless reports of people paying for items that they never receive, getting charged monthly for a free trial they never signed up for, or receiving an item that is counterfeit or much different from the one advertised. The 2022 BBB Online Scams Report found that online purchase scams were the most common cons reported to Scam Tracker. Before ordering, check out the business profile on BBB.org and read the reviews.\n\nSocial media gift exchanges: Each holiday season this scheme pops back up, and this year is no different. A newer version of this scam revolves around exchanging bottles of wine; another suggests purchasing $10 gifts online. Another twist asks you to submit your email into a list where participants get to pick a name and send money to strangers to “pay it forward.” There is even a twist about “Secret Santa Dog” where you buy a $10 gift for your “secret dog.”\n\nIn all of these versions, participants unwittingly share their personal information, along with those of their family members and friends, and are further tricked into buying and shipping gifts or money to unknown individuals. And– it’s an illegal pyramid scheme.\n\nHoliday apps: Apple’s App Store and Google Play list dozens of holiday-themed apps where children can video chat live with Santa, light the menorah, watch Santa feed live reindeer, track his sleigh on Christmas Eve, or relay their holiday wish lists. Review privacy policies to see what information will be collected. Be wary of free apps, as they can sometimes contain more advertising than apps that require a nominal fee. Free apps can also contain malware.\n\nAlerts about compromised accounts: BBB has been receiving reports on Scam Tracker about a con claiming your Amazon, Paypal, Netflix or bank account has been compromised. Victims receive an email, call, or text message which explains that there has been suspicious activity on one of their accounts, and it further urges them to take immediate action to prevent the account from being compromised. Be extra cautious about unsolicited calls, emails, and texts.\n\nFree gift cards: Nothing brings good cheer like the word “FREE.” Scammers have been known to take advantage of this weakness by sending bulk phishing emails requesting personal information to receive free gift cards. In some of these emails, scammers impersonate legitimate companies and promise gift cards to reward their loyal customers. They may also use pop-up ads or send text messages with links saying you were randomly selected as the winner for a prize. If you have received an unsolicited email with gift card offers, do not open it. Instead, mark it as spam or junk. However, if you opened the email, do not click on any links.\n\nTemporary holiday jobs: Retailers typically hire seasonal workers to help meet the demands of holiday shoppers. Shippers and delivery services are top holiday employers this year because of the increase in online orders and the need to get most of these packages delivered before Christmas. These jobs are a great way to make extra money, sometimes with the possibility of turning into a long-term employment opportunity. However, job seekers need to be wary of employment scams aimed at stealing money and personal information from job applicants. Keep an eye out for opportunities that seem too good to be true.\n\nLook-alike websites: The holiday season brings endless emails offering deals, sales, and bargains. Be wary of emails with links enclosed. Some may lead to look-alike websites created by scammers to trick people into downloading malware, making dead-end purchases, and sharing private information. If you are uncertain about the email, do not click any of the links. Instead, hover over them to see where they reroute.\n\nFake charities: The last few weeks of the year is a busy time for charitable donations. Donors are advised to look out for fraudulent charities and scammers pretending to be individuals in need. Avoid impromptu donation decisions to unfamiliar organizations. Responsible organizations will welcome a gift tomorrow as much as they do today. Verify a charity at BBB’s Give.org – where possible, donate to the charity through their website and use a credit card.\n\nFake shipping notifications: More consumers are making purchases online, and there is also an increase in the number of notifications about shipping details from retailers and carriers. Scammers are using this new surge to send phishing emails with links enclosed that may allow unwanted access to your private information or download malware onto your device. They may also try to trick people into paying new shipping fees.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nSextortion Targeting Adolescents (11/17/22)\n\nSextortion describes a crime that happens when someone threatens to expose sexual images in order to blackmail a person. Statistics suggest that this crime often goes unreported, however and that about a quarter of victims include children age 13 or younger. Teenage boys have been the most common targets in recent cases reported to the national Cyber Tipline. Incidents involving adolescents frequently begin when the criminal connects with a child or teen over an online game, app, or social media account. Through deception, manipulation, or threats, the criminal convinces the young person to produce an explicit video or image. Sometimes, the explicit content is shared voluntarily, with the expectation that it remains private. However, sometime these images are shared without consent, which results in opportunities for extortion. Young people don’t seem to have a guarded mentality when it comes to engaging with strangers they meet on the internet, and generally feel less inhibited about sharing content online.\n\nTragically, there has been a dramatic increase in adolescent suicide as a result of these incidents. Kids often lack the maturity and foresight to appreciate the consequences of engaging in sharing explicit images. There are even cases of criminal gangs based overseas targeting families of teenage victims who took their own lives after sending nude images.\n\nWhat can you do as a parent?\n\nMost importantly, make sure you talk with you kids about their online activities. And let them know that whatever mistakes they make online, nothing is worth their lives. Candidly discuss what they should do if someone ever tries to use a photo of them to get them to do something they don’t want to do.\n\nThe people that commit these crimes have studied how to reach and target children. Online accounts are easily faked and criminals often offer money or gifts to earn trust. Teach your kids to be extremely cautious when speaking with someone online that they have not met in person. Consider blocking strangers that try to connect.\n\nKids and teens should:\n\nBe selective what information you share online – make you accounts private.\n\nKnow that people can pretend to be anyone or anything online.\n\nBe suspicious of people you meet on one game or app who ask you to start talking to them on a different platform.\n\nRealize that any content you create online can be made public – don’t trust someone to keep it private.\n\nBe willing to ask for help.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nBrand Phishing, Data Backups, Loan Forgiveness (11/03/22)\n\nBrand Phishing Attacks – The Most Common Form of Social Engineering\n\nIn a brand phishing attack, criminals try to imitate the official website of a well-known brand by using a similar domain name or URL and web-page design to the genuine site. The link to the fake website can be sent to targeted individuals:\n\nby email or text message,\n\na user can be redirected during web browsing,\n\nor it may be triggered from a fraudulent mobile application.\n\nThe fake website often contains a form intended to steal users’ credentials, payment details, or other personal information. In the third quarter of 2022, the top phishing brands included (globally):\n\nDHL (22%)\n\nMicrosoft (16%)\n\nLinkedIn (11%)\n\nLinkedIn lead brands in the first two quarters of the year, illustrating that cybercriminals will often switch tactics to increases their chances of success. Shipping is one of the top industry sectors for brand phishing, second only to technology. As we head into the busiest retail period of the year, criminals will undoubtedly employ shipping related scams in their efforts to take advantage of online shoppers.\n\nThe use of phishing via text messages (smishing) creates even more opportunity:\n\nPeople may be distracted, and on the move.\n\nThere’s no way to check for a fake sender domain (only a phone number, which is easily faked).\n\nThere are typically fewer words in a text, and therefore fewer opportunities to spot poor grammar.\n\nThere’s no logo for the bad guys to spoof.\n\nTo reduce you risk of falling victim to these delivery scams:\n\nDon’t click on links to enter personal information, including login credentials and financial information, from an unsolicited email or text message.\n\nWatch for the tell-tale signs of a phishing scam: urgency, out-of-the-blue requests for financial or other information, imposter URLs, spelling and grammatical errors, and requests for money in return for delivery.\n\nIf you receive an email that looks suspicious, visit the official website of the delivery company rather than follow a link embedded into the message.\n\nRegularly perform back-ups and install reputable security software on all your devices.\n\n3-2-1 Rule for Data Back-ups\n\nWhether you are a large company or an individual, we all could be susceptible to ransomware. When it comes to backing up data, the best practice is to follow the 3-2-1 rule, which involves creating a minimum of three backups of data, in at least 2 different locations, with one of those copies stored securely in a secondary location. The three backups consist of the primary backup and at least two copies. For individuals, this means at minimum creating periodic back-ups on your device, on some type of external drive, and to the cloud. For businesses and organizations, real-time back-ups are recommended. A recent survey found that only about 1 in 5 organizations follow this 3-2-1 rule, putting them at significant risk. Paying a ransom for data is dependent on many factors, but past incidents show that only about 8% of companies were able to recover their data after paying a ransom.\n\nStudent Loan Forgiveness Scam Update\n\nThe Better Business Bureau states that victims of student loan forgiveness scams are reporting that the scammers have the victim’s social security number, graduation date, and FAFSA information. In most cases, the criminals try to get victims to pay fees to enroll in the program. Remember:\n\nNever pay fees for a free government program.\n\nWhen in doubt, contact the government agency directly – visit ED.gov or StudentAid.gov.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nOctober is Cybersecurity Awareness Month (10/20/22)\n\nCybersecurity is the practice of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use. Cybersecurity is making sure that your online presence, your smart devices, your information in cyber space stays safe and out of the hands of the wrong people.\n\nWhat are the potential threats?\n\nPhishing: Phishing attacks use emails and malicious websites that appear to be trusted organizations, such as charity organizations or online stores, to obtain user personal information.\n\nMalware: A computer can be damaged or the information it contains harmed by malicious code (also known as malware); a malicious program can be a virus, a worm, or a Trojan horse.\n\nIdentity Theft and Scams: Identity theft and scams are crimes of opportunity and even those who never use computers can be victims. There are several ways criminals can access your information, including stealing your wallet, overhearing your phone call, dumpster diving (looking in your trash) or picking up a receipt that contains your account number.\n\nWhat can I do to lower my risk?\n\nUse and maintain anti-virus software and a firewall: update as soon as possible to prevent hackers from exploiting known issues or vulnerabilities; set-up an automatic, regular spyware scanning routine to catch vulnerabilities.\n\nUse strong passwords: use a different password for every site; passwords should be at least 10-12 characters in length and contain letters, numbers, and symbols – consider a passphrase; utilize a password manager to create and store passwords\n\nAvoid public wi-fi: With little effort, hackers can easily exploit public wi-fi to gain access to your computer; they can even trick you into connecting to what appears to be a legitimate wi-fi access point; if you must use public wi-fi, avoid entering sensitive data (passwords, financial info) and use a VPN.\n\nEstablish computer usage guidelines: Help children understand how to use the computer, other connected devices, and the internet safely; have candid, age appropriate conversations with younger users to help them understand the do’s and don’ts of cybersecurity.\n\nBack-up your data: back-up frequently to a physical hard drive, not just the cloud; if your device is lost or stolen, or you are the victim of ransomware attack, you will still have access to your important data.\n\nCurrent Scams\n\nOpen enrollment (insurance)\n\nStudent loan forgiveness\n\nHurricane relief\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\n“Brushing” and “Pig Butchering”: Two Scam Techniques You Need to be Aware of (10/06/22)\n\n“Brushing” Scams\n\nIn a brushing scam, an online retailer sends people items and products they didn’t purchase in order to fraudulently improve their store’s ratings. Creating a fake transaction and mailing the item to a random person gives the seller credit for a sale, which boosts that seller’s rating on online marketplaces like Amazon.\n\nThey may also write a fake positive review of the item in the recipient’s name to increase their rating even more. The intention is to give the impression that the recipient is a verified buyer who has written positive online reviews of the merchandise.\n\nThe term “brushing” comes from a translation of the Chinese word for cleaning, similar to how in English we talk about money laundering, e.g. the transaction is “cleaned.”\n\nBrushing scams are illegal in the U.S., but enforcement is difficult as most brushing scams are committed by overseas sellers. Amazon and other online marketplaces prohibit brushing scams, so reporting the incident to the platform is the best way to hold that seller accountable.\n\nIf you receive an item you didn’t order, it could mean that your personal information was compromised, or just that a scammer found your information on a public data broker site for free.\n\nWhat should you do if you receive an unsolicited package? First, check the package to see if it was delivered to you by mistake, in which case it’s not yours to keep. On the other hand, if it’s addressed to you and you didn’t order it, you can choose to keep or discard the item, or you can try to return it to the sender if a return address is listed.\n\n“Pig Butchering”\n\nPig Butchering is a technique used by criminals in which they build up trust with their victim, before pressuring them to give up increasingly bigger sums of money. This can be under the pretext of a romance scam, investment scam, or other imposter scam – the phrase alludes to the practice of fattening a hog before slaughter.\n\nThis con begins with the scammer creating a fake online persona; they then start sending messages to people on social media or dating sites, or may use other messaging apps like WhatsApp to pretend to have stumbled on a “wrong number.”\n\nOnce connected, the scammer will start-up conversations hoping to gain the target’s trust, often initiating benign chats about life, family, and work; they hope to use this information later to manipulate their victims.\n\nEventually, the scammers will re-direct the conversation to an investment opportunity and convince the target to open a brokerage account, which is fraudulent and controlled by the scammer. Soon, the victims of this scam are being instructed how to wire money from their bank account to a crypto wallet and eventually to the fake brokerage account.\n\nOver time, the scammers work to manipulate victims into investing more and more, exploiting their targets’ emotional and financial vulnerabilities. The scammers may promise risk-free investments with high returns, and pressure victims into taking out loans or liquidating their retirement savings.\n\nOnce targets reach a limit and become unwilling to deposit more funds, their seeming investment success comes to a sudden stop – withdrawals become impossible, or they suffer a big “loss” that wipes out their entire investment. Scammers may then turn the screws of manipulation tighter by telling victims there’s a potential solution: if they deposit more cash into their account, they can regain what they lost. In another version, the scammers claim that the investment is successful — but there’s a “tax problem” that requires paying additional funds. And if the victim pays, the scammer will claim that new obstacles have arisen that require paying new fees. No matter how much targets pay, it’s never enough.\n\nIf you’ve been victimized, report the crime to your bank and law enforcement — the FBI, the Secret Service and local police — as quickly as possible. The longer you wait, the harder it is for your bank to reverse any fraudulent transactions and for law enforcement to trace, freeze, or seize stolen funds.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nMalvertising on Microsoft Edge, U-Haul Data Breach, Reporting Spam Texts (09/22/22)\n\nMicrosoft Edge Tech Support Scams\n\nMicrosoft Edge is the default browser for the Windows platform and is the third most popular web browser; as such, scammers are looking to take advantage of its popularity.\n\nFor the past couple months, criminals have exploited the Edge News Feed to trick users into clicking on malicious links; the News Feed is a collection of thumbnails offering news content, traffic and weather updates, and advertisements.\n\nWhen a user clicks on one of the malicious ads (typically shocking/strange stories), a script runs to determine the users’ “value”, weeding out bots, VPN’s and locations not of interest – those users are directed to a harmless page related to the ad.\n\nHowever, some users will be directed to a tech support scam page displaying a fake, urgent warning to contact “Microsoft Support” at a telephone number provided; if you call, the scammers will try to convince you to let them access your computer – once they’re in, they’ll tell you that you need to pay for their services to fix a problem (which doesn’t exist).\n\nBe careful what you click and don’t call any numbers without verifying their authenticity.\n\nU-Haul Data Breach\n\nRecently, U-Haul announced that criminals were able to access the company’s internal customer contract search tool which gave the hackers access to rental contracts completed between November 2021 and April 2022.\n\nThe breach was reportedly discovered in July and affected over two million customers – the data contained names, birth dates, and driver’s license numbers (no financial info was involved).\n\nU-Haul says it will notify affected customers by mail and offer credit monitoring services from Equifax (who was also the target of a data breach in 2017 affecting 147 million people).\n\nWhat else should you do? Consider a credit freeze if you haven’t already done so. Set-up a free Credit Karma account to monitor your credit. Review bank statements and your credit reports. Beware of phishing emails and texts related to this breach. Check haveibeenpwned.com to check which data breaches you may be involved in.\n\nReporting Spam Text Messages\n\nScammers are increasingly using text messages to trick people into clicking malicious links and giving up their personal or financial information – what can you do if you receive a spam text?\n\nFirst, NEVER click on any link – if you think the message may be real, contact the company using a phone number or website you know is real.\n\nSecond, block the sender using your device’s native settings, through your wireless provider, or with a call-blocking app – visit citia.org for more information.\n\nFinally, forward the message to the FTC at 7726 (SPAM), or on their website.\n\nFor more information, check out this informative briefing from the FTC: https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nReview of Common Scams Part 2 (08/18/22)\n\n“You’ve Won” Emails\n\nScammers use fake offers of free gifts or services to trick you into clicking a link; current examples include: Ace Hardware (170 piece Stanley tool set), Walmart (iPhone 13), AT&T (free reward), and Kohls (Ninja food processor).\n\nSome sites are legally operated, but are designed to convince you to agree to terms and conditions and/or recurring charges on your credit card; others are just looking for your personal or financial information to steal your money and identity – almost all of these emails are scams or imposters and never provide the promised prize.\n\nLook for multiple emails promising the same prize; scrutinize the email for spelling and grammatical errors; hover over the “From” field to see the sender’s email address.\n\nAvoid clicking links in any of these emails – just delete them.\n\nUtility Scams\n\nYou get a call or text message from someone pretending to be your utility company; the caller or text says you owe money, which is a lie.\n\nThe scammers then threaten to shut off your service if you don’t pay money immediately; they may ask you to pay by money transfer (MoneyGram or Western Union), gift cards, or cryptocurrency (Bitcoin).\n\nKnow that only scammers demand payment using these methods and before it shuts of service, all real utility companies will notify you in writing and offer a payment plan.\n\nIf you are worried about an amount due, call the number on your bill or on the company’s website.\n\nTicketmaster Lookalike\n\nPeople are back to attending concerts and sporting events in droves, and scammers are exploiting this enthusiasm by impersonating the popular ticket seller Ticketmaster.\n\nYou may be looking to buy tickets to an upcoming concert or need to transfer tickets for a show that was postponed due to COVID-19; you do an internet search for your question, which brings up results for Ticketmaster – you click through to the website and everything looks normal.\n\nThe website prompts you to enter your personal information and a credit card number; however, as soon as you complete a transaction, you notice some suspicious activity: you might receive tickets with someone else’s name on them, or you may never receive your tickets at all; in other cases, you get the tickets, but the site charges you a much higher rate than advertised.\n\nUpon closer inspection, you realize you were not on the Ticketmaster site at all – it was a lookalike site with a similar name, such as “TicketSmarter” or “TicketFaster”; when you call the customer service number, they are either unreachable, unhelpful, or downright aggressive.\n\nThe safest way to purchase event tickets is to go directly through the venue, either in person or through their official website; if you purchase from a third-party company, make sure they are a reputable ticket vendor or reseller – check reviews on BBB.org; watch out for fake websites – take a close look at the website’s URL to ensure there are no slight misspellings; finally, always make online purchases with your credit card – you can dispute fraudulent charges and have a better chance of getting your money back.\n\nVirtual Kidnapping\n\nThis scam typically begins with a phone call saying your family member is being held captive – you may hear someone screaming in the background; another variant has a family member being held because he/she caused an auto accident, is injured and won’t be allowed to go to the hospital until damages are paid.\n\nScammers may threaten violence unless a ransom, typically in the form of a wire transfer, is paid; sometimes the scammer may claim not to have received the money and may demand more payment.\n\nThis type of scam can understandably cause panic and adrenaline, which can convince victims that the voice they hear is their son/daughter, grandchild, spouse, and so on; social engineering, combined with publicly available information, can make the scam even more believable (eg. spoofing caller ID).\n\nTo avoid falling victim, follow these tips: (1) remain calm – try not to get caught up in the emotion of the moment; (2) discuss this scam with family members, especially grandparents – consider having a family “password” to confirm identity; take measures to protect your personal information online – keep social media accounts private and limit the details you share.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nReview of Common Scams Part 1 (07/28/22)\n\nOnline Shopping\n\nScammers use fake online shops offering free items or great discounts to lure people into buying items.\n\nLook for red flags such as too-good-to-be-true prices, incomplete item descriptions, and aggressive sales tactics.\n\nAlso, be alert for phishing text messages impersonating well-known companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.\n\nFake Gas Cards\n\nYou may see a post, or receive a message, that you won a free gas card (most common currently is $500 from Shell, but could be other brands).\n\nWhen you reply, you are asked to pay a small shipping fee and provide some personal info.\n\nNever pay to win, do your research, and avoid acting on impulse.\n\nRomance\n\nRomance scams aren’t new, but their popularity continues to increase.\n\nScammers create fake profiles on social media and dating apps to look for victims; after they gain your trust, they will ask you to send money or buy items for them.\n\nAvoid sending money to people you’ve never met in person.\n\nRental Properties\n\nYou respond to an online rental listing that touts a beautiful home, low rent, and great amenities; it may look legitimate, but con artists often use real photos and descriptions stolen from other websites.\n\nThe “landlord” replies to your message claiming to be unable to show the property – they may claim to be out of town for work or in the hospital with a health emergency.\n\nThe scammer will then create a false sense of urgency, telling you that others are interested, so you must act immediately, and they will ask for a security deposit and/or the first month’s rent to reserve the property; they may also require prospective tenants to complete an application form, which asks for personal details like a Social Security number.\n\nNo matter the details, once you send the money, the result is the same – the “landlord” will stop responding to messages and disappear.\n\nTo avoid falling victim, watch out for deals that are too good – scammers lure you in by promising low rents, extra amenities, and a great location; search online for similar properties – if you find the same ad listed in other cities, that’s a huge red flag; don’t send money to someone you’ve never met for an apartment you haven’t seen – never pay a stranger with cash transfer app like Venmo or Zelle, or wire transfers.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nThese scams entice you with celebrity endorsements and promises of easy money to try to trick you into downloading harmful apps and exposing your personal information.\n\nThese scams also employ phishing emails embedded with fake links, which, when opened, take you to a fake crypto trading website that looks identical to a legitimate one – it can be exceptionally hard to tell a fake site apart from a real one.\n\nLike online shopping scams, be wary of too-good-to-be-true offers; avoid investing in things you don’t understand.\n\nEmployment Offers\n\nThe pandemic has had a negative impact on employment, and people are eager to seek out new opportunities; you might receive text messages and emails appearing to be from well-known companies, but they may contain links that will install malicious apps or lead you to phishing websites.\n\nSome scammers even conduct fake job interviews; there is no job, but they will collect the personal information from your application form or ask you to buy equipment or pay for training sessions.\n\nDo your research by visiting the company’s website and avoid unsolicited offers.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nSummer Travel Safety Tips, Credit Reports & Freezes (06/09/22)\n\nSummer travel safety tips\n\nWhen you’re on vacation this summer, don’t take a vacation from keeping you and your money safe. Here are a few tips to help prevent fraud:\n\nWhen booking travel, stick to name brand travel sites or book directly with the airline, hotel, or car rental; avoid unsolicited email deals.\n\nConsider a mail hold – visit usps.com/manage/hold-mail.htm for details.\n\nUse a credit card, not cash or debit card, for added fraud/theft protection; make sure your bank or credit card company has your current email/phone to notify you in case of fraud.\n\nLock your smart phone or tablet (with biometrics or six-digit code), turn off automatic connection to Wi-Fi, use only cellular data or private, password-protected Wi-Fi, and avoid unsecured public Wi-Fi; consider using a VPN client.\n\nwatch out for data skimmers at public charging stations; bring your own portable charger.\n\nRevisiting the Credit Freeze\n\nDuring our conversations, we often focus on steps to protect your money and personal information by spotting and avoiding scams. But there’s another important way to help protect yourself – regularly check your credit reports. Through December 2022, everyone in the U.S. can get a free credit report each week from all three nationwide credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion).\n\nBy checking your credit reports, you’ll be able to see if someone is misusing your personal information to run up charges on your credit cards, get new credit or open a new account in your name, and steal your identity. The sooner you spot this fraud, the sooner you can act to stop the harm and correct the errors. Follow these steps:\n\nOrder your free credit reports at www.annualcreditreport.com, or call 877-322-8228.\n\nRead the reports carefully. Do you recognize the accounts? Do they list credit applications? Did you apply for credit at those places? Check your personal information too. Are your name, address, and Social Security number correct?\n\nDispute mistakes. Contact the credit bureau and the business that reported the information. Ask both to correct their records. Include as much detail as possible, plus copies of supporting documents, like payment records.\n\nIf you don’t recognize an account, visit IdentityTheft.gov to report it to the FTC and get a recovery plan. IdentityTheft.gov will also help you create a sworn Identity Theft Report that you can send to the credit bureaus to block identity theft-related debts from appearing on your credit report.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nScam Update and Online Marketplace Safety (05/26/22)\n\nScam update\n\nStudent Loan Forgiveness\n\nPayments are paused on most federal student loans; however, scammers are taking advantage of recent changes to confuse borrowers. Watch out for companies promising to reduce debt by lowering payments through enrollment in student loan forgiveness or other programs; they may also falsely promise to apply monthly payments to consumers’ student loans, consolidate loans, and improve credit scores, all for a small fee. Research the lender before proving personal info or committing to a service – don’t be in a rush and never pay an up-front fee. The FTC has helpful information on their website: https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-student-loans-work-how-avoid-scams.\n\nWorkers’ Comp (Facebook)\n\nA scammer impersonates one of your FB friends; they allegedly saw your name on a list of people who are owed workers’ compensation; they provide you with a number of a person who can help you collect the money. You think the info is from a trusted friend, so you call the number; an “agent” either (1) confirms you are owed money, or (2) asks you to pay a small fee so they can check. In the end, the scammers wil ask you to pay a fee upfront, and may give you a choice of payout amounts – they bigger the amount, the larger the fee; they’ll ask you to wire or give them pre-paid card numbers. Never pay money to get money and don’t share your personal information; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nEmployment Recruiter\n\nYou receive a message that someone is interested in hiring you and asks you to download a messaging app like Telegram – they may claim to have seen your resume and want to interview you. Once you download the app, the “recruiter” will ask you a few interview questions and ultimately will offer you a job; they will send you official looking contracts and forms, asking for personal info, including banking info for “payroll”. It may not end there – some scammers offer to buy you a computer and other supplies for your home office; they send you a check, later claiming you were accidentally overpaid and need to return a portion of the check, which was counterfeit in the first place. Research job offers first – visit the company’s website and look up their contact info; never participate in “overpayment” schemes – they are always a scam; and be wary of sharing too much personal information – don’t let someone pressure you because it’s a “now or never” opportunity.\n\nConsumer Safety When Using Online Marketplaces (Walmart and Amazon)\n\nBeware of third-party sellers\n\nResearch the seller before making a purchase (Google the company name and “complaints” or “scam”)\n\nDo not trust the reviews – some estimates are that 50-60% of Amazon review are fake\n\nIf the deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is\n\nPay with a credit card, not a debit card or money transfer\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nPasswords and Peer to Peer Payment Apps (05/12/22)\n\nPasswords\n\nPasswords are the key to almost everything you do online, and you probably have multiple passwords that you use throughout the day. Choosing hard-to-hack passwords and managing them securely can sometimes seem inconvenient. And in an era of botnets and data breaches, it’s more important than ever to use strong passwords. Fortunately, there are simple ways to make your passwords as secure as possible. Doing so can keep hackers from taking over your accounts, and prevent theft of your information or money from your bank.\n\nWhat You Can Do:\n\nUse different passwords for different accounts – don’t use “login with…” (eg. Google, Facebook, etc)\n\nLength trumps complexity – consider 12-16 characters\n\nBut complexity still counts – avoid single words and info that is readily available about you\n\nUse a password manager – LastPass, Dashlane, 1Password\n\nTurn on multi-factor identification, when available\n\nNever reveal or share your passwords with others – nobody needs to know them but you\n\nPeer to Peer Payment Apps (Zelle)\n\nAn increasing number of scams involve peer to peer payment apps, rather than traditional wire transfers like Western Union or MoneyGram. These payment apps are popular because they are free, fast, and convenient. But they lack meaningful consumer protection and can be easily exploited by criminals. Arguably one of the most popular is Zelle, a payment app created in 2017 by the nation’s largest banks to enable instant digital money transfers. Last year, an estimated $490 billion was sent through this service.\n\nHowever, Zelle’s immediacy has also made it a favorite of fraudsters. Other types of bank transfers or transactions involving payment cards typically take at least a day to clear. But once crooks scare or trick victims into handing over money via Zelle, they can siphon away thousands of dollars in seconds. There’s no way for customers — and in many cases, the banks themselves — to retrieve the money.\n\nCurrently, many banks are refusing to reimburse customers in these cases citing a federal law that only requires them to cover “unauthorized” transactions. Criminals often trick victims into transferring the money themselves and customers argue this deception makes the transaction “unauthorized”. Banks and regulators often feel differently.\n\nIf you choose to use apps like Zelle, follow these guidelines:\n\neducate yourself about the risks of using these services\n\ncheck with your bank to see if Zelle had been activated on your account automatically\n\nconsider a stand-alone checking or savings account just for Zelle transactions\n\nonly use Zelle to send payments to known and trusted recipients\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nQR Codes and Phishing Scam Updates (04/28/22)\n\nQR Codes\n\nMost people have become familiar with the little, square barcodes known as Quick Reaction, or QR, codes. These codes stepped into the mainstream during the pandemic, used by organizations to visit websites, view menus, and make payments. Unfortunately, criminals have found ways to exploit vulnerabilities in this technology to steal personal data, install malware, and redirect payments for the criminals’ benefit. Like most phishing attempts, the success is based on a sense of urgency or convenience.\n\nExample: malicious actors placed QR-code stickers on parking meters in major Texas cities, directing drivers to a fraudulent website where they supposedly could pay for parking.\n\nWhat You Can Do:\n\nThink before you scan – be especially wary of codes posted in public places. Is the code printed directly on the device or material, or is it a sticker?\n\nWhere does the code send you? Does the sight look legitimate? Is it asking for personal information that doesn’t seem needed?\n\nAvoid QR codes in emails or paper junk mail. These are usually always a scam.\n\nPreview the code’s URL – most smartphones will give you a preview of the website as you start to scan it. Better yet, use a secure scanner app instead of your camera. But be sure to download the app from a reputable source.\n\nAvoid downloading apps from a QR code. Practice caution when entering login, personal, or financial information on a site navigated to by a QR code.\n\nPhishing Scam Updates\n\nThere are two phishing scams that are currently very prevalent in our area.\n\nAmazon Pre-Text\n\nYou get an email or text message containing an invoice or shipping confirmation for an order you didn’t place, or a message that there’s a “problem” with your Amazon account or payment method.\n\nFree Gift\n\nYou receive an email that says, “Your bill is paid for April. Thanks, here’s a little gift for you. <link>”\n\nBoth of these scams attempt to trick you into clicking a link which will direct you to a site where the criminals will try to elicit your personal information. According to the FTC, Amazon scams have increased by 500 percent in the last year. And last month, over 11.6 billion scam text messages were sent on American wireless networks, up 30 percent from February.\n\nWhat to Look For:\n\nScam texts usually come from numbers that are 10 digits or longer. Authentic commercial entities generally come from four-, five-, or six-digit numbers.\n\nFraudulent messages often contain misspelled words and grammatical errors.\n\nBe wary of tactics implying urgency or consequences for inaction.\n\nNever click on links in unsolicited emails or text messages – and don’t reply, either. If you suspect a problem, go directly to that website by typing the known URL in your web browser. If you do fall victim, change your password immediately and consider a credit freeze.\n\nWestern Union Refund Claim\n\nRefunds are still available to people who were tricked into wiring money to scammers through Western Union between January 1, 2004 and January 19, 2017. If you didn’t file a claim for a refund yet, you have until July 1, 2022 to file. The refunds are part of a $586 million settlement Western Union reached with the FTC and Department of Justice in 2017 for violating the law when it failed to guard against fraud in its system.\n\nFor more information about how to file a claim, visit https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/western-union-refunds.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nCurrent Scams Involving Social Media (03/24/22)\n\nInstagram phishing scam\n\nIn this scam, criminals are not only trying to get your Instagram password, but also your email credentials.\n\nHow it works:\n\nYou receive an official-looking email from Instagram. According to the message, you have violated copyright laws, and your account will be deleted within 24 hours. But don’t worry, the email says – if you think that Instagram has made a mistake, all you need to do is click the button and “verify” your account. Then, you are taken to a website that prompts you to input your Instagram credentials. Most scams would end there, but not this one!\n\nImmediately, another message appears. This pop-up claims that you must also verify your email address. You’ll see a list of e-mail providers. Choose yours, and you’ll be urged to enter your email address and password. As a final touch, the scam site redirects to the real Instagram website, which lends to the credibility of the scam.\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nDon’t panic or feel intimidated. Scammers use intimidation tactics to pressure you into acting quickly and without taking time to verify the information. Legitimate businesses will not use these tactics – stay calm and contact the business directly before acting.\n\nDouble check the “from” email address and link destinations. Hover over links to see where they really lead; and verify that the email is actually from who you think.\n\nNever click links in unsolicited emails, especially when they demand urgent action. Email communications are easy to spoof. Go directly to the app or login into the website to confirm the information.\n\nOther popular online scams\n\nFor scammers, there’s a lot to like about social media:\n\nIt’s a low-cost way to reach billions of people from anywhere in the world.\n\nIt’s easy to manufacture a fake persona.\n\nScammers can hack into an existing profile to find “friends” to con.\n\nThere’s the ability to fine-tune their approach by studying the personal details people share on social media. In fact, scammers could easily use the tools available to advertisers on social media platforms to systematically target people with bogus ads based on personal details such as their age, interests, or past purchases.\n\nCurrently, the number one social media scam involves investment schemes, particularly those involving bogus cryptocurrency investments. Last year, more than half of people who reported losses due to investment scams reported that the scam began on social media. According to the FTC, criminals use social media platforms to promote bogus investment opportunities, and even impersonate supposed “friends” to encourage them to invest.\n\nAfter investment scams, the FTC identifies romance scams as the second most profitable fraud on social media. Losses to romance scams have climbed to record highs in recent years, with more than a third of people reporting that it began on Facebook or Instagram. These scams often start with a seemingly innocent friend request from a stranger, followed by sweet talk, and then, inevitably, a request for money.\n\nWhile investment and romance scams top the list on dollars lost, the largest number of reported scams came from people who said they were conned trying to buy something they saw marketed on social media. About 45% of reports of money lost to social media scams last year were about online shopping. In nearly 70% of these reports, people said they placed an order, usually after seeing an ad, but never got the merchandise. When people identified a specific social media platform in their reports of undelivered goods, nearly 9 out of 10 named Facebook or Instagram.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nUkraine Charity Fraud and Medicare Scams (03/10/22)\n\n“Support Ukraine” scams\n\nWith the recent events in Ukraine, many people are looking for ways to support those affected by the Russian attacks. And as with many noble causes, scammers have found ways to exploit people’s generosity. If you are inclined to provide financial support, consider the following:\n\nDoes the group you are giving to represent a legitimate organization? Before donating, check the site Give.org to see if they meet the BBB Charity Standards.\n\nBe wary of emotional pleas. Scammers may text or email, claiming to be a victim – they may claim their husband and/or children have been killed in an effort to persuade you to give money. Only give to verified charities you trust.\n\nIt’s the imposter scam, rebooted. “Help, I’m stuck in Ukraine”; or, “I have lots of money to move out of Ukraine and need your help”; or “I need money to give my loved ones a proper burial”. No matter what the twist, it’s all the same. Imposters are looking to pray on your emotions to separate you from your money.\n\nAvoid crypto. While there may some legitimate organizations that accept cryptocurrency donations, most are scams. And it’s almost impossible to trace your money after its been converted. Stick with official, trusted organizations for making donations, and only use a credit card directly on their website, rather than any links on social media.\n\nMedicare scams surface locally\n\nLocally, people have been receiving phone calls from individuals purporting to represent Medicare. Typically, these criminals will ask for your name, birthdate, and most importantly, your Medicare Number. They want this information to commit identity theft and Medicare fraud. Don’t be fooled:\n\nMedicare will NEVER contact you for your Medicare Number or other personal information unless you’ve given them permission in advance.\n\nMedicare will NEVER call to sell you anything.\n\nYou may get calls promising you things if you give them a Medicare Number – DON’T DO IT.\n\nMedicare CANNOT enroll you over the phone unless you called first.\n\nRegularly review your Medicare claims and Medicare Summary Notices for any services billed to your Medicare Number you don’t recognize. Report anything suspicious to Medicare by calling 1-800-MEDICARE.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nYou’ve Won Scams and Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (02/24/22)\n\nRecently, there has been a local uptick in imposter scams, primarily “You’ve Won” type scams. Here’s how it works: You get a call, email, or text from someone who says they are from Publisher’s Clearing House, or some other well-known organization. They tell you you’ve won some amazing prize and all you have to do is pay a “processing fee”, “taxes”, or some other charges to claim your prize. Most often, they demand pre-paid cards as payment. This is always a scam!\n\nScammers try to push you to a heightened emotional state to lower your guard and steal your money and personal information. To avoid falling victim to these criminals:\n\nNEVER pay to receive a prize. There’s also no reason to give someone your bank account or credit card number in response to a sweepstakes promotion.\n\nNEVER give pre-paid or gift card numbers to someone you don’t know. Using these payment methods is like using cash – once it’s gone, you won’t get it back.\n\nDON’T trust caller ID or email headers. These can be manipulated to appear to come from a trusted source, when in fact it’s an imposter.\n\nIf you receive a call from one of these scammers, just hang up and block the number. If you receive an email, don’t respond and delete the message.\n\nOver the past few weeks, several companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft have announced critical software updates and patches in response to zero-day vulnerabilities. A zero-day vulnerability refers to a security vulnerability for which no mitigation or patch is available at the time it is disclosed or made public. So, until the company develops a patch, and you update your system, you are potentially at serious security risk.\n\nFor example, just visiting a malicious web page, even if you don’t click or download anything, could steal private data, make unauthorized changes, or install malware, including spyware. These exploits can affect computer and mobile phone operating systems, web browsers, “office” applications, and hardware, including IoT (Internet of Things) devices. To protect yourself:\n\nUpdate software and applications as soon as the security patches are released.\n\nInstall and utilize a reputable internet security suite – one that includes smart anti-virus, firewall, and sandboxing techniques.\n\nUse only essential applications. The more software you have, the more vulnerabilities you have.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nAvoiding Tax Fraud (01/27/22)\n\nIt’s tax season, which means scammers are looking to separate you from your money. Last year, between 20 and 30% of Americans reported losing money to fraud, with many involving tax scams. Here’s what you need to know to help keep yourself safe:\n\nThe IRS does not initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text message, or social media channels to request personal or financial information. Stay alert for IRS phishing scams:\n\nRecipient may receive an “urgent” email or text claiming to be from the IRS\n\nThe message usually involves instructions to click on a link and/or fill out a form\n\nSome tactics that criminals use include: IRS needs to update your online profile, you qualify for a refund, your credit card was fraudulently used, or you’re due a large sum of money\n\nTo identify these scams: look for generic greetings, poor grammar or typos, or conflicting web addresses\n\nNEVER click on links, download files, or reply\n\nScammers are changing their tactics:\n\nInstead of employing high-pressure tactics, or getting you to click a link in email or text message, scammers are now employing an “ask nicely” approach, avoiding links and attachments all together\n\nYou may see an email purportedly from a friend or co-worker asking you to contact them by phone\n\nScammers will try to establish trust and lower your guard\n\nIn general, when deciding whether to engage with people you don’t know online:\n\nBe aware before you share. Every little bit you give away about yourself makes it easier for a scammer to charm you, threaten you, or entice you into an online relationship you didn’t ask for in the first place.\n\nIf in doubt, don’t give it out. If it feels like a scam, it probably is.\n\nNo reply is often the right reply. Never feel compelled to reply out of politeness or completeness.\n\nBe wary of dishonest tax preparers. Remember, when it comes to your tax return, you are ultimately responsible for all the information on your return, no matter who prepares it. It is important to choose a tax preparer wisely: (1) check their qualifications, (2) review your return before the tax preparer signs and submits it, and (3) never sign a blank return.\n\nFor more info, visit the HELP tab at irs.gov.

Here’s what you need to know:\n\nThe only authorized web site is COVIDTests.gov. When you click the “order free at-home tests” button, the web site will re-direct to the USPS site. No credit card or other financial info required and the only personal information required is your first and last name, and shipping address.\n\nThe Post Office has initially had some issues verifying certain addresses, which has led to scammers using this to send phishing emails.\n\nBe wary of unsolicited emails offering tests; don’t click links.\n\nDon’t be tricked by similar web addresses, e.g. .com, .org, etc.\n\nScammers are also selling bogus test kits – make sure you only use FDA approved kits from a reputable vendor.\n\nRecently, the police department has received reports of a previously-known, nationwide scam circulating in this area. The scam involves someone purporting to be a United States Marshal conducting an investigation. The scammers have typically identified themselves as “Agent Michael Edwards, badge number 287061”, but may use other identities. The imposters will frequently threaten arrest if the target does not provide them with money, or other personal or financial information. Law enforcement will never threaten you or ask for payment in this manner. If you receive a similar call, just hang up. If you have questions about a call’s legitimacy, contact your local law enforcement directly.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nMalicious PDFs (01/13/22)\n\nWe’ve talked in the past about the importance of not clicking links in messages, but what about attachments? Most people know not to intentionally run executable files (.exe), but many are not suspicious of PDF files – there seems to be a different level of psychological trust with a PDF.\n\nUnfortunately, between 2019 and 2020, there was an approximately 1,200% increase in malicious PDF files, from about 412,000 to over 5.2 million. For scammers, PDF files are an enticing phishing option as they work across different platforms and allow criminals to engage with users, making their schemes more believable as opposed to just a text-based message with a plain link.\n\nCriminals are able to encode PDFs with something called JavaScript, a programming language that is widely used on the World Wide Web – it is most often used on websites to control functionality and content.\n\nThere are generally two variations of using malicious PDFs:\n\nImage of fake CAPTCHA, coupon offer, or paused video (actually a static image), usually accompanied by “CONTINUE” or “CLICK HERE” text\n\nEmbedded in a PDF attachment to a phishing email, also designed to trick recipient to click a button\n\nIf executed, these scripts can initiate all manner of threats to your computer and personal information. But there are several tactics you can employ to mitigate the risk:\n\nMost PDF readers & browsers have controls that will allow you to disable JavaScript\n\nAlways use an updated version of your PDF reader, browser, and operating system\n\nScan attachments with antivirus or malware programs (not foolproof)\n\nHover over hyperlink to see where it will take you\n\nWhen in doubt, do not open unsolicited attachments\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nElder Exploitation and Resolutions for the New Year (12/16/21)\n\nWhile the elderly are often targeted by scammers, the unfortunate reality is that most elder financial abuse is committed by a family member. According to recent studies, over 85% of elder financial abuse perpetrators are family members – 60% involve the elder’s child. Elder financial abuse is the illegal or improper use of an elder’s funds, property, or assets – and it’s a crime. Due to the nature of this crime it often goes unreported, which is why it’s important to recognize the signs:\n\nlarge withdrawals of cash\n\nsuspicious new accounts opened\n\nsignature on checks looks different than before\n\nsomeone new enters the pictures and starts to isolate the elder from family and friends\n\nelder suddenly becomes defensive about finances\n\nCaring for an elderly parent can be stressful, but nothing justifies exploiting their trust or finances. If you need help caring for an elderly parent, or suspect someone may be the victim of elder financial abuse, contact the Sheboygan County Aging and Disability Resource Center at (920) 467-4100, or your local law enforcement agency.\n\nMany of us make New Year’s resolutions to improve our physical health and well-being. But what about resolutions that will help you stay safe from scammers? Consider these five suggestions:\n\nChange your passwords – create separate, complex passwords for each important online account.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication when available.\n\nConsider freezing your credit – it’s free and is probably the best defense against financial ID theft.\n\nBe highly skeptical – do not respond to unsolicited phone calls, emails, or texts.\n\nNEVER buy a gift card to pay a bill or settle a supposed debt.\n\nRemember, most criminals rely on manipulation known as social engineering to trick people into acting quickly, without thinking. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is a scam. Never act in haste. Don’t let a scammer persuade you to keep something secret; that’s a technique used to isolate victims from people they trust.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nHoliday Fraud Prevention Tips (12/02/21)\n\nThe holidays are here, which means criminals are ramping up efforts to exploit your holiday habits. When shopping for those perfect gifts, there are several things you can do to keep the Grinches at bay:\n\nWhen purchasing items in store, consider using contactless payment methods. Tapping, instead of swiping, your card or using your phone to pay (e.g. Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay) are the most secure ways to pay. For more information, click HERE.\n\nConsider turning credit/debit cards “on and off”. Many banks and credit card issuers offer an app or online service, sometimes called a lock or a freeze, that allows you to secure your card when not in use. Features vary by company – click HERE for some additional information.\n\nHaving items delivered? Leaving delivered items unattended while you’re away increases the risk of theft. Consider in-store pick-up or Amazon lockers as an alternative to home delivery.\n\nAvoid gift cards – gift cards have lower security than credit cards and are subject to hacking; scammers use websites intended to check a gift card’s balance to uncover valid card number and pin combinations.\n\nCriminals also use this time of year to exploit people’s generosity by impersonating charities. Before giving any money, remember these tips:\n\nUse online resources to research charities – CharityNavigator.org, GuideStar.org, and Give.org are good places to check.\n\nWhen receiving calls or emails, DO NOT trust the email header or your caller ID. These can be “spoofed” to appear they are coming from a legitimate source.\n\nNEVER give personal or bank/credit card information to unsolicited requests.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nPhone Scams, Fraud Reporting, and Holiday Shopping Tips (11/18/21)\n\nImposter phone scams continue to affect our area – a recent version involves an imposter claiming to be from the Sheriff’s Department and advising the target that they missed jury duty. The scammer threatens the target with arrest/jail and instructs the target to purchase MoneyPak (pre-paid) cards to pay the fine. If successful, the scammer convinces the target to provide the code numbers off the pre-paid cards. In this case, the scammer also “spoofs” their caller ID to make the call more believable. REMEMBER: Law enforcement will NEVER request payment in this fashion. Before paying money, contact the agency or organization directly to verify the information.\n\nThe Sheboygan Police Department has updated the process for reporting fraud and identity theft. Unfortunately, many cases involving scams and schemes do not have a known or local suspect and, by their nature, have very low solvability rates. The new reporting process is an attempt to provide better customer service to the public by streamlining the reporting process and providing fraud victims with resources to advocate for themselves. It shifts our focus to education and prevention, not just documentation. For more information, click HERE to visit the Sheboygan Police Department’s fraud reporting page.\n\nAs we enter the holiday shopping season, remember these tips:\n\nWhen shopping for holiday gifts, be wary of unsolicited emails offering “to good to be true” deals.\n\nAvoid clicking on links, and instead visit the product site directly.\n\nWhen shopping online, use a credit card (not a debit card) or single-use card numbers.\n\nIf purchasing IoT devices, ignore “online” reviews on merchant sites (many are fake) – look for independent/objective advice, or talk to someone you know and trust. Research products’ privacy / data collection policies. Stick with mainstream manufacturers to ensure ongoing support (firmware upgrades, etc).\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nWPS “Stop Scams Now” Campaign and Phishing Emails (10/28/21)\n\nWisconsin Public Service is partnering with law enforcement to stop utility scams. WPS wants you to know that they will NEVER:\n\nDemand payment by cryptocurrency or third-party apps\n\nThreaten or try to scare you\n\nDisconnect you on short notice\n\nWhen in doubt, hang up and call 800-450-7260.\n\nFor more information from WPS, click HERE.\n\nIn addition, phishing attempts continue to be prevalent across the area, involving email, text, and phone calls. Click HERE for real life examples.\n\nRemember:\n\nNever click on any links in unsolicited emails and texts\n\nReview the email header for the sender’s address\n\nGrammar and punctuation errors are a tip that the message is phony\n\nDon’t be pressured to “act now” or “respond immediately”\n\nBefore sending any money, independently verify the request is legitimate\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nOctober is Cybersecurity Awareness Month (10/14/21)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nCybersecurity is the art and science of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Cybersecurity is making sure that your online presence, your smart devices, your information in cyber space stays safe and out of the hands of the wrong people.\n\nWhat are the potential threats?\n\nPhishing: Phishing attacks use emails and malicious websites that appear to be trusted organizations, such as charity organizations or online stores, to obtain user personal information.\n\nMalware: A computer can be damaged or the information it contains harmed by malicious code (also known as malware). A malicious program can be a virus, a worm, or a Trojan horse. Hackers, intruders, and attackers, all of whom are in it to make money off these software flaws.\n\nIdentity Theft and Scams: Identity theft and scams are crimes of opportunity, and even those who never use computers can be victims. There are several ways criminals can access your information, including stealing your wallet, overhearing your phone call, dumpster diving (looking in your trash) or picking up a receipt that contains your account number.\n\nWhat can I do to lower my risk?\n\nUse and maintain anti-virus software and a firewall: Use an antivirus program and a firewall to protect your computer from viruses and Trojan horses that could steal or modify your data. When software notifies you of an update, called a patch, be sure to update as soon as possible to prevent hackers from exploiting known issues or vulnerabilities. Also, set-up an automatic, regular spyware scanning routine to catch vulnerabilities.\n\nEstablish computer usage guidelines: Help children understand how to use the computer, other connected devices, and the internet safely. Have candid, age appropriate conversations with younger users to help them understand the do’s and don’ts of cybersecurity. These conversations can protect your data by setting clear boundaries and guidelines.\n\nDouble check email attachments: An email that looks as if it came from someone you know doesn’t necessarily mean it did. It is possible for viruses to alter the return address so that it looks like the message came from someone other than the sender. Before opening any attachments, verify that the message is legitimate by contacting the person who sent it. Use caution even from people you know, be wary of unsolicited attachments.\n\nTrust your instincts: As the old saying goes, “if it is too good to be true, it probably is.” Some antivirus software might not have the latest virus protections because attackers are constantly releasing new viruses. However, always be sure to scan documents and attachments with antivirus software before opening them. Do not open suspicious emails or attachments and turn off automatically downloading attachments. But always remember: technology can only help so much, so trust your instincts!\n\nFor more information, click HERE to review the Tip Sheets on CISA.gov.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nScam Review and the “Devious Licks” TikTok Challenge (09/23/21)\n\nLet’s review the most common types of scams seen in the Sheboygan area:\n\nRomance scam – criminals pose as interested romantic partners on social media or dating websites in order to gain your trust and extract money from you\n\nImposter scam – criminals pose as a relative (usually a child or grandchild) claiming to be in immediate financial need, or as a government agency or utility company demanding money\n\nTech support scam – criminals pose as technology support representatives and offer to fix non-existent computer issues\n\nLottery/Sweepstakes or Charity scam – criminals claim you’ve won a foreign lottery or sweepstakes, which you can collect for a “fee”, or the scammer claims to work for a charitable organization\n\nTo protect yourself, remember these tips:\n\nStop communications with the suspected scammer immediately\n\nDon’t be pressured to act quickly; take time to verify the story\n\nNever wire money, or provide gift card numbers, to unknown or unverified people or businesses\n\nDo not click on links in unsolicited emails or text messages\n\nRemember the adage, “If it sounds too good to be true, it is.”\n\nWhat is the “Devious Licks” challenge on TikTok? It’s a social media-driven “challenge” that encourages kids to steal or damage school property, then anonymously share a video with the hashtag on the TikTok platform. The most common acts include stealing soap dispensers and damaging toilets or sinks.\n\nWhy are teens participating? It’s a combination of biology and sociology, affected by teens’ brain development and the dopamine rush from “likes, comments, and views”, along with a teen’s need for belonging.\n\nWhat can you do as a parent?\n\nHelp kids understand their digital reputation\n\nDiscuss the consequences of illegal or risky behavior\n\nDevelop a positive relationship with your child with open lines of communication\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nKeeping Your Cell Phone Secure and Other Fraud Updates (09/09/21)\n\nHackers and criminals have recently begun to rely more on “zero-click” exploits to breach phone data. These attacks are typically very highly targeted in nature, and deploy far more sophisticated tactics than mass cyber-attacks that we see and know of on a daily basis. Typical cyber-attacks rely on the potential victim being tricked into clicking a malicious URL, or downloading an attachment that contain macros with embedded malware. In a “zero-click” attack, malicious software is usually added to the root file system which makes it more difficult to detect and trace. However, these “in-memory” payloads generally cannot survive a phone re-boot – therefore, people should power cycle their phones at least once a week to help prevent against this form of cyber-attack.\n\nCell phones are also vulnerable to “SIM swaps”, which allow a criminal to essentially take-over your phone service. To guard against this, you should first make your PIN code for your cell phone billing account hard to guess. Next, set-up account protection with your carrier. It’s referred to by different names: “port freeze”, “account takeover protection”, “account lock”.\n\nThere are two additional sources of fraud you should be aware of: using electronic payments apps and fitness club thefts. If you choose to use an electronic payment app like Venmo or Cash App, you should understand that you do not have the same consumer protections as using a credit card. To reduce the risk, set-up a separate bank account to fund your payments and only keep enough money in the account to cover the transactions. Also, only send money to family or close friends.\n\nFinally, be aware that there has been an increase in thefts from fitness clubs, including lockers and vehicles. To avoid being a victim, don’t bring valuables when you work out. If you must, leave them in your LOCKED car, out of sight.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nT-Mobile Data Breach and Investment Account Fraud (08/19/21)\n\nI’m a T-Mobile customer – what should I know about the recent data breach?\n\nNot all data breaches are created equal – the most recent T-Mobile breach, estimated to affect 50-100 million individuals, deserves your attention if you’re a T-Mobile subscriber. A lot of the information obtained from the hack is likely already widely available online, but the blend of data is what’s concerning. The combination of names, phone numbers, and carrier data makes it much easier for scammers to employ “phishing” methods designed to convince someone to click on a malicious link that advertises, for example, deals or offers for customers. And having all that information in a single data base makes it easier for criminals to commit identity theft. Additionally, having access to your phone’s IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number could allow a criminal to perform a SIM-swap, thus taking over your account. This would allow the criminal to gain access to two-factor authentication codes and compromise the security of your passwords and accounts.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nChange your T-Mobile account password and PIN\n\nSign-up for a credit freeze (click HERE for more info)\n\nConsider using an authenticator app\n\nPossibly the biggest financial fraud theft you’ve never heard about\n\nCriminals are increasingly adapting to exploit technology to steal your money. Instead of robbing banks, criminals are hacking into your accounts through social engineering, since there’s less chance of getting caught and typically the consequences are lower if caught.\n\nIt’s not just your checking or savings account that they are after – it’s your retirement and investment accounts. It is estimated that only 10% of money in the U.S. is in banks – the rest is in 401Ks, IRAs, and other investment accounts. And Congress has never passed protections for consumers on hacks against investment accounts. Unlike banks and credit cards, investment accounts have little-to-no regulatory protection from fraud losses. Even though some companies have policies that provide consumer protection against fraud, there are often many hoops to jump through. You are the first line of defense!\n\nWhat to do:\n\nSet up two-factor authentication on your retirement and investment accounts. While not foolproof, this tactic offers strong protection. Just remember to never give someone your authentication code.\n\nImplement a STRONG password – most people hate dealing with passwords, but the stronger and more unique the password is, the more secure your account. Instead of a common word or random letters and numbers, use a passphrase of at least five or six random words, and consider using a password manager program.\n\nReview your account balances and activity regularly, once a week, and immediately report unauthorized activity. The sooner you identify and report fraud or suspicious activity, the better chance of getting your funds restored.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nHome Delivery Scam and “Social Media: The Weakest Link” (07/15/21)\n\nOne of the more prevalent scams currently being employed by criminals is referred to as the home delivery scam. Typically, you receive a text message appearing to be from a well-known package delivery service (UPS, FedEx, etc). The message advises that the delivery service attempted to deliver a package to you, but no one was home to receive it and a re-delivery needs to be scheduled. The message contains a link to a realistic-looking web site, where they ask you to pay a modest fee (a clue that it’s a scam), typically a few dollars, for re-delivery. The scammers then ask you to enter your personal information (another clue it’s a scam) and payment information. Sometimes, the scammers will go so far as to ask for additional info (“protecting you from fraud”) such as your date of birth and/or mother’s maiden name.\n\nTo avoid being the victim of this scam:\n\nCheck all URL’s carefully – bookmark legitimate sites in advance.\n\nSteer clear of links in messages and emails – go directly to the company’s web site to conduct business.\n\nReview your bank and card statements – don’t just look for payments that shouldn’t be there, but also keep an eye out for expected payments that don’t go through; also, be alert for incoming funds you weren’t expecting, given that you could be responsible for any funds that passes through your hands, even if you neither asked for it nor expected it.\n\nWhen it comes to personal information, when in doubt DON’T give it out.\n\nData hacks are everywhere right now – attacking us as individuals, attacking businesses, government agencies, hospitals, and public utilities. How are hackers gaining access to these systems? Often by looking for the weakest link, which many times is the employee’s social media account (Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter).\n\nA recent article in the WSJ noted that a hacker can find everything they need to break-in to your life within 30 minutes of scanning your social media posts. Hackers employ “automation” to scan your posts quickly.\n\nSometimes we feel helpless against this kind of intrusion – the key to prevention is privacy. During the pandemic, many people turned to social media to connect with one another and posted a lot of personal information. It’s time to get back to more secured profiles.\n\nThings not to do on social media:\n\nDo not post private information for public viewing, such as travel plans, personal interests, details about family members, birthdays, and pet names. These are often the answers to our “security questions” on the sites we visit. Make sure your profile is set to only be viewed by trusted friends and family.\n\nBe careful when responding to “friend” or “follow” requests – pages can be counterfeited.\n\nUse a separate email just for social media sites.\n\nClick here to go back to the top of the page.\n\nCryptocurrency Primer (06/24/21)\n\nLately, there have been a lot of stories in the news about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Hackers have demanded payment in Bitcoin for ransomware attacks, and other scammers have used Bitcoin investment schemes to defraud unsuspecting victims. Also, the value of Bitcoin has dropped dramatically over the past month. So, what is Bitcoin and how does it work?\n\nBitcoin was the first and is arguably the most popular form of cryptocurrency. There are currently over 1,600 available cryptocurrencies. In simplest terms, a cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency. Unlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies are d"
