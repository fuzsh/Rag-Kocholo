        "text": "It’s another slow but busy week in Washington. Congress is still on recess, but the tech world keeps moving at warp speed between the leaked classified documents, Twitter stepping in it all over the place between labeling NPR as state-sponsored media and banning Substack links for a few days. Substack also rushed out its Twitter-esque clone Notes.\n\nSpeaking of Notes, I’ve been using it since Friday and love it. For now, I’ve moved most of what I would put on Twitter to this to see how it goes. Many of the people I used to engage with on Twitter are here now, and I like how it’s a way to engage with readers like you and other writers. Feel free to join the fun here.\n\nWhat I want to talk about today, though, is another story that’s been making the rounds - Biden’s plan to utilize influencers for his campaign and the plan to potentially even give them their own briefing room in the White House.\n\nAt first blush, this might not seem like a big deal - but it’s a strategy that, while likely necessary and a smart thing to think about - is littered with land mines.\n\nToday’s post is for paid subscribers! A huge thank you to the now over 4,000 of you who are free subscribers. Welcome! I hope you enjoy what I have to say. If you have any feedback please do reply and let me know.\n\nIf you upgrade to paid today - $50 per year or $5 per month - you’ll get access to content like this and the archives, and support me to spend more time writing and researching. I really enjoy doing this, and your support means a lot.\n\nUtilizing influencers for elections isn’t anything new. Endorsements from prominent figures, celebrities, and others have long been sought to help show a campaign's strength and spread its message.\n\nWith the rise of social media came a new kind of influencer. One who made a name for themselves on the internet. These folks aren’t celebrities in other areas such as music or acting who have a big following - though those are still important too - but everyday people who make their living creating content for the rest of us to consume.\n\nIn 2022, the influencer marketing industry was valued at $16.4 billion. Influencers are who the platforms chase because these platforms need good, entertaining content so that the users follow. This is partly due to how social media is changing. TikTok’s “for you” algorithm helped people find the content they might like without even following the account. Last year, Facebook announced it would show people more unconnected content. Twitter, Instagram, and others are doing the same.\n\ncovered this well in one of his newsletters last month on how the monthly fees these platforms charge aren’t for amateurs - it’s for professionals.\n\nUnsurprisingly, politicians and political parties are turning to influencers to help make the case to voters - especially young ones. Bloomberg did this in the 2020 election. During the midterms, it exploded even more - especially with Democrats. The Biden administration had Tik Tok influencers to the White House last Fall to mark the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. The DNC built a hub “for influencers, surrogates, and supporters to receive party-sponsored talking points, messaging, and a wide variety of digital content to post on their own social media feeds” that generated 83 million impressions between February and August of last year.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just campaigns. Advocacy groups utilized influencers for the midterms. Start-ups emerged to help connect campaigns and organizations to influencers.\n\nThis is expected to continue in 2024 at an even larger scale. Even though it’s been reported before about the Biden team’s plan to utilize influencers, it’s taken on more attention with a new Axios story that the administration might give them their own briefing room at the White House. The White House also promoted Rob Flaherty - the director of the office of digital strategy - to be an assistant to the president. It’s the first time the director of ODS will have the same designation as the White House comms director and the press secretary.\n\nRecently, Higher Ground Labs put out an excellent report looking at the political tech landscape. Some of their key takeaways from 2022 include:\n\nCampaigns flock to streaming services as more begin to accept political ads\n\nInfluencer marketing achieves institutional adoption\n\nPolitical text messages reach a tipping point\n\nCampaigns are starting to purchase their tech earlier\n\nLarge M&A activity of key infrastructure raises questions among practitioners\n\nTech improves at the downballot level but campaigns still lack an affordable and effective stack\n\nThere are just a few problems with all of this, though.\n\nFirst and foremost is the discussion about banning TikTok or not. Democrats are in a tricky spot because they want access to the younger user base that the app has but also recognize the challenges with the app. Republicans are swearing off the use of the app, potentially cutting them off from these voters.\n\nBeyond that is the fact that technically TikTok has banned paid influencer campaigns for politics. They haven’t said anything about organic content beyond the fact that campaigns can’t post content raising money.\n\nThis also leads to questions about transparency. I remember at Facebook when the Bloomberg team started working with influencers, we scrambled to find a way for people to be able to see any influencer posts that had the paid partnership label.\n\nBut this requires the influencer to choose to use the label as it’s impossible for any platform to know if someone has been paid for their content if that transaction happened off-platform. Some influencers will want to talk about the election and not be paid. Some will be paid. How will voters trust to know the difference and that these content creators - and the campaigns - are being truthful about where money is exchanging hands? The FTC is trying to crack down on this to limited success.\n\nInfluencers aren’t going to be the only new tactic we see used in 2024. Artificial intelligence, new platforms, podcasts, newsletters, and so many other tools will be used by campaigns in new and innovative ways. And, yet again, political ad rules will lag behind these new technologies.\n\nPoliticians themselves will be conflicted when faced with the choice of utilizing these new approaches to reach a coveted voter demographic and their desire to regulate them. The party that walks this fine line the best could very well end up being the winner.\n\nWhat I’m Reading\n\nPuck: Mark Warner’s Anti-TikTok Algorithm\n\nRest of World: TikTok arrests in northern Nigeria\n\nPolitico: Twitter fails to report some political ads after promising transparency\n\nThe Washington Post: Meta won’t say if politicians can post AI-made fakes without warnings\n\nTime: Local Journalism Is in Collapse.
