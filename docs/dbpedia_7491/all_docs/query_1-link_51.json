        "text": "For the most part, Sega Mega Drive games were distributed in plastic \"clamshell\" cases, however many, particularly in North America were released in cardboard boxes to keep manufacturing costs down.\n\nOnly one officially licensed game, Sonic & Knuckles, was distributed in a cardboard box for all regions, primarily due to its unusual cartridge shape. This list does not include special bundles.\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nEarly Electronic Arts-published games were distributed in \"hard-top\" cardboard boxes in North America, much like PC games of the era. This is only applicable for games released in 1990 and early 1991 - EA moved to the clamshell design for its second batch of releases and kept this design for the rest of the console's lifespan:\n\nPopulous (1990)\n\nBudokan: The Martial Spirit (1990)\n\nWill Harvey's Zany Golf (1990)\n\nBattle Squadron (1990)\n\nSword of Sodan (1990)\n\nJohn Madden Football (1990)\n\nLakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs (1990)\n\nBlockout (1991)\n\nJames Pond: Underwater Agent (1991)\n\nAccolade/Ballistic: Early Releases\n\nAccolade did not acquire an official license from Sega for many years, so its initial set of games, originally distributed under the Ballistic brand, also used hard-top PC-style cardboard boxes. Some, such as Winter Challenge were re-released in clamshell designs in Europe. Ishido: The Way of Stones, Accolade's oldest Mega Drive game, used a flip-top design.\n\nFlip-Tops\n\nNorth America saw many of its later games (1994 onwards) released exclusively in cardboard \"flip-top\" style packaging.\n\nNote: all Mega Hit Series games are also flip-tops.\n\nSlide-boxes\n\nRe-release Slide-boxes\n\nThe very common slide-box design was used almost exclusively for re-releases in North America, i.e. those previously distributed in clamshells.\n\nTec Toy"
