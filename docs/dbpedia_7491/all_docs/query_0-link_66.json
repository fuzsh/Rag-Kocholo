It is just plugged to the expansion port of the C64. It can also be operated as a stand-alone unit (since it's basically an FPGA computer like the C-One in a C64 cartridge case), replacing the computer, the floppy drive and the heavy power supply. A docking station providing 4 joystick ports and connectors for an Amiga or C-64 keyboard is available.\n\nTechnical Data\n\nAltera FPGA with 24624 LEs\n\n16MiB Flash Memory, 32MiB RAM\n\nVGA connector\n\nMMC/SD card slot\n\nConnectors for PS/2 mouse, PS/2 keyboard and IEC bus\n\nBattery-backed real time clock (RTC)\n\nIR receiver for CDTV remote control.\n\nConnector for RR-Net (RR-MK2 needs a patch to work in standalone mode on Chameleon V1).\n\nUSB link to a PC for debugging and data transfer.\n\nTurbo Chameleon 64 FPGA Core\n\nIn cartridge mode the C64 core can be used with a european (PAL-G) or the \"new\" american 65-cycle (NTSC-M) C64. The \"old\" american 64-Cycle C64 and the argentinian \"Drean\" (PAL-N) C64 can not be used.\n\nIn standalone mode both a PAL-G or NTSC-M C64 can be emulated\n\nVGA-output with 60 Hz refresh rate or more.\n\nTurbo function with full 6510 processor compatibility (incl. illegal opcodes). For the first time, a C64 accelerator that does not use a 16-bit processor, but an accelerated 6510. (see Benchmarks)\n\nREU (memory expansion) with up to 16 MiB RAM.\n\nGEORAM (memory expansion) with up to 4 MiB RAM.\n\nMMC/SD card slot with MMC64 compatibility and optional MMC64 ROM emulation.\n\nFull 1541-emulation (2 Drives)\n\nsupports D64 and G64 files\n\nSID emulation with filters (Two SIDs are emulated with selectable filter characteristics and base address of 2nd SID).\n\nPS/2 mouse support (emulation of 1351 and Micromys).\n\nPS/2 keyboard support (Joystick emulation available on numeric keypad).\n\nFreezer (compatible with Retro Replay). ROMs can be stored in onboard flash or read from MMC card (as .crt or binary files).\n\nEmulation of the following utility and game cartridges is available: 8 or 16 KByte (EP)ROM cartridges, Simons' Basic, Ocean type 1, FunPlay, Super Games, Epyx Fastload, Westermann Learning, C64 Game System (system 3), Warpspeed, Dinamic, Zaxxon, Magic Desk, Comal-80, Ross, Mikro Assembler, StarDos, EasyFlash, Prophet-64, Mach-5, PageFox, Business Basic (S'More).\n\nEmulation of the following freezer cartridges is available: Action Replay, Retro Replay, Final Cartridge 3, Expert Cartridge, KCS Power Cartridge, SuperSnapshot 5, Capture.\n\nChameleon Beta-9q release (December 16th 2021): Combined core, menu and ChaCo update including manual (12 MBytes, includes automatic updater for Windows and ChaCo versions for Win32 and Linux64) (what's new)\n\nEarlier releases: Beta-7 Beta-7a Beta-7b Beta-8 Beta-8a Beta-8b Beta-8c Beta-8d Beta-8e Beta-8f Beta-8g Beta-8h Beta-8i Beta-9 Beta-9a Beta-9b Beta-9c Beta-9d Beta-9e Beta-9e hotfix Beta-9f Beta-9g Beta-9h Beta-9h hotfix Beta-9i Beta-9j Beta-9k Beta-9l Beta-9m Beta-9n Beta-9o Beta-9p\n\nUser Information\n\nThe Quick Installation Guide that comes with the Chameleon.

Before doing so, please make sure you are running the latest version of the Turbo Chameleon FPGA Core.\n\nTo make it easier and more efficient for us to handle bug reports, please provide the following information with them:\n\nwhether you are using the Chameleon in standalone or cartridge mode\n\nwhether you are using PAL or NTSC\n\nif you are using cartridge mode, then it would be helpful to know which kind of C64 it is (board revision, type of CIAs, VIC, SID). You can use Box Check:Type to get some related info without having to open the C64.\n\nif you are experiencing a bug in cartridge mode, also try if the same problem shows in standalone mode. sometimes certain misbehaviour can be attributed to a (partially) broken c64 - this must be ruled out first.\n\na detailed description that enables us to reproduce the bug\n\nfor more details look at Chameleon Test Procedure\n\nDeveloper Information\n\nThe Chameleon programming manual from the above release.\n\nHeader files defining a lot of constants related to the chameleon hardware can be found in the devel directory of the latest release archive\n\nPrograms from the Chameleon Test Repository may serve as examples\n\nRTC example by Paul Förster\n\nThe Chameleon core development manual\n\nThe Schematics of Chameleon V1 hardware\n\nThe Schematics of Chameleon V2 hardware\n\nVHDL example code and support libraries can be found in Peters github repository\n\nUSB Protocol Documentation is available in the Chaco repository. Also contains details on the flash memory layout.\n\nUSB Library and Tools Source is available as well\n\nSupport\n\nicomp forum - sign up here to get in touch with the developers and other Chameleon users. Since all developers read this, it is also the preferred way to report bugs.\n\nFeel free to contact us if you have any questions not answered in the available documents.\n\nRelated projects\n\nHere are some Chameleon related projects that we know of. Please notice that all of these are created and maintained by other Chameleon users, which means that Individual Computers does (and can) not provide any support for them.\n\nZipcom offers a 3D printed case for the Docking station and a Chameleon cartridge and dockingstation DIY Labels and Dockingstation Case (Site requires Javascript)\n\ncorei64 offers a 3D printed case for the docking station (variant without openings for the keyboard ports)\n\nCores\n\nWhen installing a core, make sure to use the right one for your hardware. If the core you just installed just shows a black screen - check again! :)\n\nWe are offering special deals for core authors - please get in touch!\n\nIf you like the work of the people listed below, click on their respective name and find out how to do them a favour :)\n\nHome Computers\n\n8 bit\n\nAmstrad MiST is a Amstrad CPC646/6128 core ported by Alastair M.
