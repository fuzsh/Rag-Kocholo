It’s the cartridge / disc only unless otherwise specified.\n\nWarpSpeed Sega Genesis Game cartridge Cleaned, Tested, and Guaranteed to work!\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\n\nUPC:015605032134\n\nCondition:Used\n\nGenre:Other\n\nPlatform:Sega Genesis\n\nRegion:NTSC (N. America)\n\nESRB:Everyone\n\nSKU:GEN_WARPSPEED\n\n———This game is fully cleaned, tested & working. Includes the Disc/Cartridge Only. May have some minor scratches/scuffs.This description was last updated on October 28th, 2020.\n\nThis is a neat idea if your a flight simmer like me. Place the infrared camera on top of your monitor, clip on three point reflector on a baseball cap, calibrate, and your ready to go. It allows you to look around the plane your flying just by looking with the movement of your head like you would if you were in a plane and wanted to look left, up, down, lean in for closer view, sit back for farther back view, you get the idea. There is a program you can run to get the aim and speed of movement just right. One thing I did find out though, is that it is sensitive to bright sources of light, the darker the room the better when you use it. If it picks up too much stray light, like from sun coming in window behind you, it can act eradic. I must say that it took me a little bit to get used to it, and I don’t always use it, but don’t think you can go wrong with it for the price.\n\nReally nice for games like DCS world and even Arma. Very responsive and nice how if you lean ahead in DCS to see a control or look closer at the A10 thermal screen even itâ€™s just like you are really sitting in the jets. Only dislike is it will wig out sometimes if you wear glasses or have other metal objects behind you or a window that faces to the south on a sunny day the IR from the sun screws with it.\n\nI’ve been using tracker with DSC Lock on FC2 and DSC A10c and XplaneTransforms the games and makes the games so much better ,I little bit pricey but well worth it , I cant imagine without it now even after a short time. For these simulators I would definitely recommend it.I only gave four stars because it does play up a little ,the view jumps around and sometimes crashes, it could be I haven’t set it right, using default settings is a quick way to get going , I’ve been using it for a few weeks now\n\nThis product takes a little getting used to once its set up. Setting it up can be a little difficult because the IR camera will lock onto any heat source. Anything that emits heat in the camera direction has to be eliminated, heaters, sunlight, candles, etc. Once you have a cold background and your settings adjusted it works as advertised. I only gave 4 stars because I ordered the premium which includes the headset clip and I only received the hat clip in the package and haven’t found the headset clip sold by itself.There is a small amount of sensor instability as you move around. This is easily fixed with a reset center button and doesn’t really hinder game play. Once you have learned to use the tracker this thing is awesome, especially if your into flight sims.\n\nI’ve been using Track IR since they first appeared on the market. Found out early on that if you’re serious about flight sims then Track IR is a must have. I had a Track IR 3 that I had updated to the vector. I used that for a several years. I finally broke down and bought the Track IR 5 and am really pleased with the upgrade. I find it is smoother with a better range of motion and it constantly returns to center. With the 3 I would usually have to recenter the view several times during a dogfight but with 5 that has been eliminated. Leaning seems to work better with 5 especially in Rise of Flight and Cliffs of Dover. You can look over the side or open the canopy and look at your exhaust flame.\n\nFirst, I must say that this product met my expectation. Even though it could have come with the option of cap vs the TrackIr clip. wish I didn’t have to wear a cap each time just to use this device. I figured that the trackIR clip for the headset should have come with it also given the price for this device. I don’t know the difference between the TrackIR 4 vs 5, but if the difference is minor, I’ll say go for the TrackIR4 as well as the TrackIR clip. that way you want have to always wear a cap if you wear a headset most of the time. Personally, I find the cap, plus the head set to be too much.\n\nI wanted to purchase this for a while, ended up pulling the trigger after watching many videos about it, none of which mentioned that it may cause severe motion sickness while playing. When I got it I played driving simulators. At the beginning it felt not very natural, but since it was my first experience with it I wasnâ€™t sure if it was supposed to be that way. Then in game it would be choppy very often, not an issue with my pc specs, and the material on the clip feels very very cheap to be worth ~$150.It also caused me motion sickness, will have to return…"
