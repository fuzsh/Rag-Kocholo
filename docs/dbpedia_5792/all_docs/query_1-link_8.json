        "text": "This is a revision of my article “On Cartesian Linguistics” which was first published in Volume 191 of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences titled “The Roots of American Psychology: Historical Influences and Implications for the Future” in 1977, pp. 287–305.\n\nThe central doctrine of Cartesian linguistics is that the general features of grammatical structure are common to all languages and reflect certain fundamental properties of the mind. It is this assumption which led the philosophical grammarians to concentrate on grammaire générale rather than grammaire particulière ... the study of universal conditions that prescribe the form of any human language is “grammaire générale.” Such universal conditions are not learned; rather they provide the organizing principles that make language learning possible, that must exist if data are to lead to knowledge. By attributing such principles to the mind as an innate property, it becomes possible to account for the quite obvious fact that the speaker of a language knows a great deal that he has not learned. (Chomsky, 1966, pp. 59–60)\n\nProfessor Chomsky has significantly set back the history of linguistics.... I do not see that anything at all useful can be salvaged from Chomsky’s version of the history. That version is fundamentally false from beginning to end. (Aarsleff, 1970, pp. 583)\n\nI prefer to think that Chomsky’s rendering of continental European rationalism is “fundamentally true.” (Verhaar, 1971, p. 10)\n\nIf historically there had been a Cartesian linguistics, with minor exceptions, it probably would have been something similar to what Chomsky proposes. (Sullivan, 1977, p. 287)"
