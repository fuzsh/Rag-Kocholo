        "text": "Born: 31st March, 1596, Descartes, Indre-et-Loire, France\n\nDied: 11th February, 1650, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nInfluenced: Noam Chomsky, Baruch Spinoza, Slavoj Žižek\n\nInfluenced by: Aristotle, Plato, Thomas Aquinas, Archimedes\n\nIt is considered that René Descartes was the inventor of both analytic geometry and symbolic algebraic notation. His use of equations to partially solve the geometric Problem of Pappus revolutionized mathematics.\n\nRené Descartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers. He frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him.\n\nHe also pioneered the standard notation that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents, for example, the 2 used in x2 to indicate x squared."
