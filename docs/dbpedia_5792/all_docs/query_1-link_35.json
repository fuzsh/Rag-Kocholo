        "text": "The Value of Understanding Logic https://lnkd.in/gV42r_4S The history of logic as a formal study can be traced back to ancient civilizations, particularly in Greece and India, where scholars began to explore the principles of reasoning and argumentation. It was with the work of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle that the foundations of formal logic were laid. Plato, in his dialogues, explored various forms of argumentation and dialectic. Aristotle's \"Organon\" is one of the most influential works in the history of logic. After Aristotle, Hellenistic philosophers like the Stoics and Epicureans continued to develop and refine logical systems. The Roman philosopher Cicero made contributions to the study of rhetoric and argumentation. Logic played a central role in medieval scholasticism. Scholars like Thomas Aquinas incorporated Aristotle's logic into Christian theology. During the 17th and 18th centuries, figures like Ren√© Descartes, John Locke, and Immanuel Kant made significant contributions to the philosophy of logic and the philosophy of mind. George Boole's development of Boolean algebra in the mid-19th century laid the groundwork for modern symbolic logic. Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Alfred North Whitehead made groundbreaking contributions to mathematical logic and the development of predicate logic. Russell and Whitehead's \"Principia Mathematica\" attempted to derive all of mathematics from logical axioms. The 20th century witnessed the development of various branches of logic, including modal logic, set theory, and non-classical logic like intuitionistic and paraconsistent logic. The advent of computers also led to developments in mathematical logic, especially in areas like computability theory and formal languages. Contemporary logic continues to evolve with advancements in fields like artificial intelligence, automated theorem proving, and the study of formal languages. Philosophers and logicians continue to explore questions related to the nature of logic, the limits of formal systems, and the application of logic in various disciplines. The study of logic has had a profound impact on philosophy, mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and various other fields. It continues to be a vibrant and evolving area of inquiry, with ongoing research and applications in many domains.\n\n[pdf] Prototypical Transitivity √Öshild N√¶ss digsell https://lnkd.in/eQU_PJSA This book presents a functional analysis of a notion which has gained considerable importance in cognitive and functional linguistics over the last couple of decades, namely ‚Äòprototypical transitivity‚Äô. It discusses what prototypical transitivity is, why it should exist, and how it should be defined, as well as how this definition can be employed in the analysis of a number of phenomena of language, such as case-marking, experiencer constructions, and so-called ambitransitives. Also discussed is how a prototype analysis relates to other approaches to transitivity, such as that based on markedness. The basic claim is that transitivity is iconic: a construction ‚Ä¶ Read More ¬ª https://lnkd.in/eyqC9Dap\n\nGreat blog on LLM and speech models worth re-sharing! üî• Namely prosody, an appreciation of which can go a long way in valuing emergent LLM capabilities. For instance, the same string of words can be realized with different tunes, creating major differences between a statement and question. A high rising terminal involving a rising pitch. Or a high to low pitch reflecting a declarative statement. There's a rich matrix of prosodic features (e.g., pitch, intonation, rhythm, vowel stress) that produces a number of subtexts that need to be taken into account by a speaker ‚Äì or computer. I thought this blog offered a nice introduction to prosody and why it is so challenging in LLMs and speech models. And while prosody in high-resource languages like English is generally well-understood, there's a limited number of data and models for low-resource languages. It‚Äôs exciting to see some incredible state-of-the art multi-modal LLMs being applied to this area, as well as interdisciplinary partnerships with anthropologists and linguists.\n\nPUBLISHED TODAY In my column New Jersey (USA) -ar \" ... My thoughts on this matter are as follows: Language, when employed in the public domain, becomes a convoluted game. True communication finds its haven in the realm of ‚Äúprivate language,‚Äù where thoughts hold greater dominion than words. Precision in communication becomes a mirage, as thoughts themselves are transient, ephemeral entities. They consist of data destined for entropy. The invention of the alphabet, akin to the rise of the modern state and the birth of post-war America‚Äôs first hamburger stand (McDonald‚Äôs), stands as a historical misstep. Throughout human history, miscommunication has spawned endless conflicts, wars, and rivalries. The ascent, prominence, and eventual dominance of computer language marks the pinnacle of these misunderstandings. Humans were perhaps meant to communicate telepathically in an environment free from language. The belief that language elevates human intelligence above other species may well be a misguided philosophy of existence. It‚Äôs plausible that there are more intelligent entities we‚Äôve been attempting to connect with over the centuries, but our communication tools (the alphabet, speech) remain too rudimentary for them to grasp. ... \" #azlyrahman #writerscommunity #readingcommunity #languagelearning #philosophy #linguistics #writingcommunity #marxism #deconstruction #malaysiamadani #education #criticalthinking MORE HERE: https://lnkd.in/eitBV3me"
