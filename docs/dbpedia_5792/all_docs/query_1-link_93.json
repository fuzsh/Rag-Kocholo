        "text": "LANGUAGE AND RESPONSIBILITY By Noam Chomsky. Translated by John Viertel. 212 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. Cloth, $10. Paper, $3.95.\n\nJUDGED in terms of the power, range, novelty and influence of his thought, Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive today. He is also a disturbingly divided intellectual. On the one hand there is a large body of revolutionary and highly technical linguistic scholarship, much of it too difficult for anyone but the professional linguist or philosopher; on the other, an equally substantial body of political writings, accessible to any literate person but often maddeningly simple‐minded. The “Chomsky problem” is to explain how these two fit together.\n\nThe question is posed at the very outset of the present book, a series of interviews conducted by the French linguist Mitsou Ronat and published originally in 1977: “Do you see a link between your scientific activities ‐ the study of language ‐ and your political activities?” To which Chomsky gives the correct answer: “There is no very direct connection between my political activities, writing and others, and the work bearing on language structure, though in some measure they perhaps derive from certain common assumptions and attitudes with regard to basic aspects of human nature.” He then proceeds to discuss politics for the first quarter of the book, and linguistics for the remainder.\n\n“Book” is only a slight exaggeration: Chomsky does virtually all the talking (this is not Margaret Mead “rapping” with James Baldwin), and, because of a happy accident, the author has substantially corrected and revised the text. Strangely enough, the tapes of the original interviews, in which Chomsky spoke in English, have been lost, leaving the translator, John Viertel, the ironic task of restoring Chomsky to his native language. The result is a wellorganized, clearly written and comprehensive introduction to Chomsky's thought.\n\nThe “Chomsky problem” is distinctly modem, but not unique to Chomsky. The great intellectuals of the past took the whole range of human experience as their domain. Aristotle, Aquinas, Erasmus, Voltaire and Hegel all addressed both philosophical and political issues without any sense of exceeding their competence. In this respect. Chomsky is in the grand tradition. But there is a difference: the great thinkers of the past spoke in a single language and employed a single manner of argument, whether they were treating the existence of God or the nature of the good society. Hegel, for instance, didn't have one mode of discourse for metaphysics and another for politics.\n\nIn our time, however, great thinkers quite commonly speak in two languages: Think of Einstein writing about physics and then corresponding with Freud on war; or Bertrand Russell composing the “Principia Mathematics” and then addressing issues of popular morality; or Sartre writing “Being and Nothingness” and then his plays and novels. Not only is\n\nthere a radical difference in manner, but there is usually an equally radical difference in quality: The popular or accessible works often seem to belie the intellectual powers unambiguously established in the professional works. Such, it seems to me, is the case with Chomsky. Indeed, one might argue that the discrepancy is more extreme in his work than in that of any other important intellectual.\n\nChomsky's principal contribution to the history of thought is his theory of “generative grammar,” to which the entire second halt of this book is devoted. Put as simply as possible, he argues that the ability to speak and understand a language cannot be explained in purely empirical terms ‐ that is, purely by induction. When we “learn” a language, he says, we are able to formulate and understand all sorts of sentences that we've never heard before. What we “know,” therefore, must be something deeper ‐ a grammar ‐ that makes an infinite variety of sentences possible. Chomsky believes that the capacity to master grammatical structures is innate: It is genetically determined, a product of the evolutionary process, just as the organic structures of our bodies are. Grammar is “generative” in the sense that it creates, rather than being created. The term, I believe, is meant to convey a parental image.\n\nChomsky has pursued the intellectual filiation of his ideas back to the 17th century. He rightly Identifies his point of view with that of the great rationalist philosophers, above all Descartes, and contrasts it with the British empiricists, who maintained that the mind is a tabula rasa and that all knowledge derives from experience. His discussion of this issue is impressive both as intellectual history and as a dissection of the inadequacies of the empiricist hypothesis, whether in philosophy or in linguistics.\n\nI can't in this context do justice to Chomsky's linguistic theories, many of which, in any case, are beyond my competence. The most important matters to take note of, I believe, are his uninflected rationalism and his awesome dialectical skill. One should perhaps also record that his linguistic opinions are, from a conventional point of view, reactionary. This is borne out by his utter disdain for sociolinguistics and the efforts of scholars such as William Labov, an expect on black English, to examine language in terms of social oppression. Chomsky doesn't deny the truth of these enterprises; he mereky finds them banal and without interest from the perspective of linguistic theory ‐ not exactly the response one might have anticipated from a famous radical, but an honest reflection of his intellectual austerity\n\nChomsky the political observer is more easily described. He is, of course, an uncompromising critic of American society and politics, and above all of the intellectual establishment (the “liberal intelligentsia,” as he calls it) that serves to rationalize them. If Chomsky's political observations have a common theme, it is the way liberal intellectuals have ditorted the reality of such recent hitorical phenomena as the student movement (detecting in it the cutting edge of totalitarianism), American foreigh policy in Indochina (interpreting it as a mistake rather than an unjust war) and Watergate (focusing on Nixon's peccadilloes instead of on more serious wrongs).\n\nI share most of Chomsky's political opinions, and count myself an opponent of the kind of “guildism” that prohibits intellectuals from speaking beyond their own field of professional expertise. I'm scornful of the literary critic who proscribes my discussing Keats, the musicologist who doesn't want me to express an opinion about Verdi, or the linguistic expert who thinks I'm not entitled to say anything about Chomsky. Granted one must guard against dilettantism, but an intellectual shouldn't be paralyzed by disciplinary boundaries. Disciplines are intellectual conveniences, not sovereign states.\n\nYet despite these prejudices I can't read Chomsky's political analyses without cringing. He makes me painfully aware that the study of history is in fact a profession, that it requires more than “a little industry and application,” of which “everybody is capable.” Unfortunately, one can't argue with Chomsky on this matter because he insists that any claim about the need for professional competence in the analysis of historical events is part of the prevailing liberal ideology, whose main objective is to conceal and distort reality. The situation is analogous to arguing with a Freudian about psychoanalytic theory, where the Freudian contends that your obiection are really resistances.\n\nThe main fault with Chomsky's historical reconstruction of postwar America is its utter flatness. For all practical purposes, only one factor is at work: the needs of American capitalism and the efforts of its liberal defenders to justify those needs. In this respect Chomsky might be compared to another important figure in the history of Western thought: Tacitus, the historian of the Roman Empire. Tacitus was surely the worst of the great historians. Like Chomsky, the critic of Imperial America, Continued from Page 3 he had a single idea: that the unhappy history of Rome in the first century A.D. could be explained almost entirely in terms of the vicious personalities and deceitful actions of its emperors.\n\nTo be sure, some aspects of historical analysis are easier than others, and they are often passably managed by the amateur. Chomsky, for example, does fairly well at the level of recording events, of telling what happened. Thus, to give but one instance, his description of the killing of Fred Hampton, a Black Panther leader, by the Chicago Police in 1969, is persuasively done (and it involves the fairly tricky matter of working from circumstantial evidence). He is less good, but not incompetent, at characterizing larger historical patterns, as, for example, when he argues that liberals have typically diverted attention from greater crimes by dwelling on lesser ones. But he plunges into the most treacherous waters of historical analysis ‐ cause and motivation ‐ with an innocence that is at once charming and exasperating. Cause and motivation are things one can't see, but can only reconstruct. And reconstructions of cause or motivation never have the status of simple truths. They are abstractions, to be measured in terms of their intrinsic plausibility and their relative usefulness over and against other abstractions. Thus when Chomsky says that the motives of antirevisionist historians of the cold war are “obvious,” he is talking pure nonsense. Tacitus was equally sure that he knew the motives of the historical figures he wrote about and dismissed all behavior that seemed to contradict those motives as dissembling.\n\nThe “Chomsky problem”—the problem of an opinionated historian inhabiting the same skin as the brilliant and subtle linguist ‐ lends itself to two explanations, one intellectual and the other moral. In intellectual terms, the discrepancy stems, I believe, from Chomsky's underestimation of the dignity of historical knowledge, which for him lacks the rigor of scientific knowledge: it is without explanatory power and, unlike linguistics or any true science, rests largely (though not entirely) on induction. Chomsky is the great critic of induction, and one senses that no branch of knowledge so dependent on this particular intellectual process could ever represent more than an amateur pursuit in his mind. Consequently he considers himself just as good a historian as the next fellow. In this paradoxical fashion, an otherwise extraordinarily rigorous mind tackles historical issues with little apparent awareness that these issues, in their own modest way, also demand intellectual discrimination.\n\nThe moral source of Chom\n\nsky's shortcoming is ‐ to use a phrase he would appreciate more interesting. Chomsky is a kind of humanistic visionary. His work as a linguist is a prolonged celebration of the enormous gulf that separates man from the rest of nature_ He seems overwhelmed by the intellectual powers that man contains within himself. Certainly nobody ever stated the case for those powers more emphatically, nor exemplified them more impressively in his own work. Reading Chomsky on linguistics, one repeatedly has the impression of attending to one of the more powerful thinkers who ever lived.\n\nIt makes perfect sense, then, that when Chomsky turns his attention to the actual record of human achievement he should be outraged by the discrepancy between what we could be and what we are. Chomsky the historian is a humanist in despair, and despair is comparable in depth to the height of his expectations. One might say that he lacks the moral composure of a true historian. He rips his way through the complex fabric of human behavior with the single intent of demonstrating its stupidity and mendaciousness, at least so far as the rulers are concerned. I am again reminded of Tacitus, whose distortion of the historical record also derived from the intensity of his humanism. Tacitus was soincensed at the betrayal of human potentiality perpetuatedby a Tiberius or a Nero that hecouldn't allow them a single disinterested trait. Chomsky, likeTacitus, is brittle and opinionated. But a moral sensibility of such extravagance is also thrilling and exemplary. In some respects, I would not have either of them a better historian."
