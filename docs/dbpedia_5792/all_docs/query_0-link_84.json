        "text": "This article explores the tension between the antithetical philosophies of empiricism and innatism underlying Chomskyan linguistics. It first follows the trail of empiricism in North American linguistics, starting from the work of Leonard Bloomfield at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and its influence on the Chomskyan paradigm, after which the Kantian trail of innatism initiated by Chomsky himself is reconnoitered. It is argued that the Chomskyan approach to natural language represents a paradigmatic example of the unsavory consequences of the divorce between mind and matter instituted by Kant, in particular because human language involves an intimate relation between both types of reality. In Chomsky's Generative Grammar, on the other hand, the material side of language is treated as completely autonomous from its mental correlate and analyzed in terms of a priori conceptual structures and computational operations; for its part, the mental side of language is treated as innate; the relation between the two is thus made utterly obscure and incomprehensible. The conclusion of the article argues in favour of a more balanced approach inspired by Aristotelianism and Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics.\n\nThis article explores the tension between the antithetical philosophies of empiricism and innatism underlying Chomskyan linguistics.

Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\"1, Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. In 1959, Noam Chomsky published a scathing review of B. F. Skinner's book Verbal Behavior.[6] At the time, Skinner's behaviorist paradigm dominated the field of psychology within the United States. Most psychologists focused on functional relations between stimulus and response, without positing internal representations. Chomsky argued that in order to explain language, we needed a theory like generative grammar, which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order.2 Chomsky's special viewpoint was the sentence-section of the parser, which concentrates on the grammars. Another section is the word's section of the parser etymology, which describes the etymology of the words. Both sections of the parser seem to be developed as optimized architectures. The words' architecture is permanently being optimized by degeneration and renewing by metamorphoses of the metaphors. The first concepts of the fundamental words seems to be generated as references to the 5 independent phonetic sources of the human voice: the tongue, the lips, teeth, palatal, and the guttural with the vocal chords. These sources are defined as the Places of articulation. Generative grammar considers grammar as a system of rules that generates exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language. It is a system of explicit rules that may apply repeatedly to generate an indefinite number of sentences which can be as long as one wants them to be.3 This essay concentrates on the relations between the grammar and the etymology of the fundamental pentagrammatons (father, mother, the virtues and the sky-god), which had been composed from letters, which represent the 5 phonetic sources of the human voice. The Vocabulary of the 5-Letter Words contains ~424 pentagrammatons, from which a number of compositions may purposely represent the fundamental words. Other pentagrammatons may unintentionally represent the 5 phonetic sources of the human voice. The conclusions in this essay on etymology may represent a helpful tool to understand the evolution of our languages.\n\nAlmost from its inception, one of the most notable features of Noam Chomsky’s “revolution in linguistics” has been his insistence that linguistics, or at least the most interesting and important aspects of linguistics, must be understood as a part of natural science. Its status as natural science is frequently posited as a critical distinction between Chomskyan linguistics and all (or almost all) other approaches to the subject. While much attention has been directed to the way Chomsky’s definitions of language and linguistics structure his research program, Chomsky’s conception of science has been subject to much less scrutiny, and turns out to be both very specific and controversial. Chomskyan science rules out, rather than in, many practices associated with contemporary scientific investigation, particularly direct empirical investigation of ordinary social and mental phenomena. Instead, Chomsky has long explicitly endorsed what he calls “Cartesian rationalism,” a view that proceeds from just those Aristotelian precepts to which modern science is typically understood to have developed in opposition. Chomsky’s project resembles and in many ways follows in lock-step that of Edmund Husserl, the first major figure to discuss “universal grammar” and to name it as such; while Chomsky rarely discusses Husserl, Chomsky’s attempts to erect a science by ruling out metaphysics are notably Husserlian, in that they continually return to metaphysical propositions that are not recognized as such, and in that this continual return in the name of science is typically marked by the name of Descartes."
