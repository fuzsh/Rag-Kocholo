It is considered that René Descartes was the inventor of both analytic geometry and symbolic algebraic notation. His use of equations to partially solve the geometric Problem of Pappus revolutionized mathematics.

René Descartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers. He frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him.

He also pioneered the standard notation that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents, for example, the 2 used in x2 to indicate x squared.
