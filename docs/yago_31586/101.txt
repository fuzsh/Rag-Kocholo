The MMIX Supplement The results of the MMIXmasters did appear as a book:

The MMIX Supplement

to

The Art of Computer Programming

Volumes 1, 2, 3

by Donald E. Knuth

ISBN-13: 978-0133992311

ISBN-10: 0133992314

The book is available from Amazon or other bookstores.

There is a separate page devoted to this book.

The mission is, however, not yet completed! Please analyze, check, test, review, or improve the code you find there to help getting it in its final shape!

A big "Thank You!" goes to all that contributed so far.

Welcome to the MMIXmasters

MMIX, the CPU, and its associated assembly language was created by Donald Knuth to specify algorithms in the next edition of his series: The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP). Currently volume 1, 2, 3, and 4A, as well as five fascicles have been published, with more in preparation. Knuth will use MMIX as the low-level programming language in the "ultimate" edition of his opus.

As Donald Knuth states in his "Call for Volunteers":

All of the MIX programs in Volumes 1--3 will need to be rewritten in MMIX, before I finish the ``ultimate'' edition of those volumes that I plan to write after Volume 5 is completed. The current target date for the ultimate volumes is the year 2020, so there is plenty of time to do the conversion. But I think it will be an instructive undertaking if different groups of students from around the world try to do the necessary translations first, perhaps in friendly competitions, long before I get into the act.

This part of the web site is for the volunteers---the MMIXmasters---who are converting all of the programs in TAOCP, Volumes 1 - 3, from the old language MIX to the new language MMIX.

The MMIXmasters had their home at www.mmixmasters.org, which was set up in December 1998 (see History) by Vladimir G. Ivanovic who headed the MMIXmasters since then. After a good start, the contributions became fewer and fewer. In May 2002, the MMIXmasters moved to mmixmasters.sourceforge.net but the activity level remained low. Therefore in July 2011, when the prospect of moving MMIX to a new home at mmix.cs.hm.edu materialized, Vladimir proposed to move the MMIXmasters to this new site as well.

The remainder of this page is taken from the existing MMIXmasters pages by Vladimir and were adapted to fit into the new context.

MIX

MIX is a hybrid binary-decimal computer. When it is programmed in binary, each byte has six bits. In decimal, each byte has two decimal digits. Bytes are arranged into words of five bytes plus a sign. The majority of programs written for MIX will work in either binary or decimal, as long as they do not attempt to store a value greater than 63 in a single byte.

Each machine instruction in memory occupies one word, and consists of four parts: the address in memory to read or write, an index specification to add to the address, a modification that specifies which parts of the register or memory location will be read or altered, and the code of operation. All operation codes have a related mnemonic.

MIX programs often use self-modifying code, in particular to return from a subroutine, as MIX lacks an automatic subroutine return pile. Self-modifying code is enabled by the modification byte, letting the program store information to, for instance, the address part of the target instruction, leaving the rest of the instruction without modification.

How to Volunteer

Note: These instructions are open to revision. I am open to comments, suggestions and discussion.

Download and read the documentation (see sidebar). We especially recommend:

Knuth's MMIX News page.

Fascicle 1: An introduction to MMIX and MMIXAL, available in book form or as a PDF file.

The architectural definition of MMIX, available as a book MMIXware-RISC-Computer-Third-Millennium or as individual PDF files in the documentation section. You should start with mmix-doc.pdf and the definition of mmixal in mmixal.pdf

Download and build the latest sources for the simple simulator, assembler, test programs, and documentation files mentioned above, and the meta-simulator. Alternatively, download a set of ready to run executables (see sidebar).

Become familiar with the process of compiling and debugging MMIX programs. For example look at the Hello World example in the examples section.

Choose a MIX program that has not already been converted to MMIX. See below for the list of available programs and their current status.

Send us an email with your contribution. Currently there is no formal submission procedure and no format requirements. Just be reasonable. Of course, it will help us to publish your contribution, if you describe what you did in an index.html file, supply the source code, and complement it with appropriate test cases.

Programming Style

Try to be faithful to Knuth's style. Look at the MMIX programs he has published in Fascicle 1 and in Volume 4A of TAOCP. His style is very flexible, there are no absolute rules (that I know of), but one goal: to optimize readability and efficiency.

There is also a style guide that tries to give useful hints.

Tools for Testing and Publishing

The programs that are written by the MMIXmasters should not only compile but are intended ultimately for publication. For this end, program text in mms files needs to be converted to program text in tex files. To facilitate this translation, there is a simple tool, mmstotex, which is described on the mmstotex page, where you find also a link to its source code (a lex file).

All programs should be tested. Especially those that are intended for publication. To facilitate writing and executing test cases, I wrote a simple tool to produce a series of programs from a test description. The tool testgen is described on the testgen page, again with a link to its source code.

MIX to MMIX Conversion

Here are the MIX programs that need to be converted to MMIX.

Programs or algorithms that are related have been grouped together, but could be separated if that makes more sense. (For example, Program #1.10 could be split into programs 1.10.1, 1.10.2 and 1.10.3.)
