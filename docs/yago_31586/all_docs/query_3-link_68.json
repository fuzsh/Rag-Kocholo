The MMiX Me media player is a 3D media space. You can navigate your albums as if you were scrolling through a real collection. No more browsing lines of text! It is probably as close to a virtual CD collection you will get. Most of the common music formats are supported: MP3, FLAC, OGG, Midi etc. Starting with version 0.2.0 of the 3D Media Player there is a built-in Web Browser and Streaming Radio. The web browser works well with sites like YouTube and Youku, or music sites like Saavn, Hungama, Dhingana and Gaana, because they are all Flash based.\n\nHow do I use the MMiX.Me 3D Media Player?\n\nWhen you run the MMiX Me media player, press F1 to bring up the help and settings tabs, or have a look at the screenshots of mp3 music collections. The Help section (F1) tells you about navigation and keyboard shortcuts. Our screenshots show several of the more common MMiX Me views, and descriptions of what they do, or how to get there. More images here.\n\nHow can I help?"
