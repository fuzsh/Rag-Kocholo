        "text": "Co-creation\n\nThe traditional way of describing direct-to-consumer is that a company creates a product and offers it directly to the customer, with no middlemen, often passing on the savings. But there is so much more to the equation than just money.\n\nFor us, direct-to-consumer is a way of working closely with the customers on all aspects of the company. Today's customers are underestimated and ignored. We believe we can create magic together if we truly let them be part of the Ridestore journey.\n\nFrom product development to website functionality and everything in between, many of the company’s decisions come directly from our customers’ feedback.\n\nCreating with customers is the future of brands.\n\nExperience\n\nExperience runs through everything we do. A brand exchange should always be more than just the goods you buy; after all, we would be nothing without you, our customers. Experience is the difference between building a brand and supporting a community you are genuinely a part of.\n\nOne of our core values is to deliver ‘WOW’ experiences. This means going above and beyond what the customer is expecting from us. From interactions on socials and customer support to unboxing and seeing the quality of gear for the first time, we’re always aiming to over-deliver on expectations.\n\nActions should always speak louder than words.\n\nExpression\n\nIs our gear ‘conventional’? Probably not. We don’t want to follow what everyone else is doing. Instead, we innovate where we can, using our community of riders as our compass.\n\nWe do our best to offer a variety of patterns and colourways so you can express yourself however you want. So whether you feel at home with other snow communities or brands, or you couldn’t feel further from someone else’s notion of ‘normal’ and ‘conventional’, you’re welcome here.\n\nFair prices, always\n\nDue to outdated supply chain and distribution models, we know that ski and snowboard wear can be expensive. That’s why we only sell to our customers and offer permanent collections of high-quality gear made to last at price points that don’t break the bank.\n\nWe’ll never build up the hype with flash sales and discounts to persuade you to buy. Instead, our focus is on providing the best gear for fair prices all year round.\n\nBuilding the Dream Team\n\nRidestore is a bunch of fearless individuals working in remote teams worldwide. We create from wherever we are, and we love to work hard so we can play hard. For us, performance and execution rule. Location and work hours are secondary. And that’s the way we like it.\n\nAlthough we don’t work right next to each other, we stay connected with digital tools and meetups and can make great products through our creative connections. We love working remotely because we crave freedom.\n\nBut we don’t take this for granted. To us, a dream team means that we all perform at our best and help each other reach that level. We create our dream roles so we can ride together as a team. Does this sound like you?\n\nSustain the slopes\n\nOur mindset, like all those who ride, roam and follow their passion on the mountain, is to push the boundaries. We want to see how far we can go. In our supply chain, we want to know how every fibre of fabric, and every worker, is treated. We’re working on ways to reduce plastic packaging, emissions and water use.\n\nBut let’s be honest.\n\nThe most sustainable garment is the one not made. So we are in the business of producing long-lasting gear. Outdoor jackets and pants made with recycled materials and tested to endure tens of thousands of abrasions - built to pass on to the next generation."
