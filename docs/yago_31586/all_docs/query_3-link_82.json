        "text": "WHAT IS PERMANENT JEWELRY?\n\nPermanent jewelry is considered “permanent” because there isn’t a clasp to easily remove it. Instead, chain is welded together at a jump ring for a custom fit. Permanent jewelry is meant to wear forever or until you decide to remove it.\n\nHOW DOES PERMANENT JEWELRY WORK?\n\nThe permanent jewelry process is easy and safe. You’ll first select your chain, any charms you’d like to add and placement of your jewelry (bracelet, anklet, ring or necklace). A trained MMIX welder will then assist you in determining your preferred length for an entirely custom fit. The MMIX welder will provide you with a barrier to protect your skin and safety glasses (if requested). Welding is quick and painless!\n\nHOW DO I REMOVE MY PERMANENT JEWELRY?\n\nIt may be necessary to remove your jewelry for medical procedures or simply because you want to. To remove, locate the jump ring where it was welded and clip using wire cutters, nail clippers or sturdy scissors. It should break easily with any of these instruments and you’ll be able to slip it out of the chain ends. If you intend to have it reattached, please keep your chain in a safe place and contact MMIX to schedule a time for reattachment.\n\nCAN MY CHILD GET PERMANENT JEWELRY?\n\nWe require all minors under the age of 16 to be accompanied by an adult. Unfortunately, it is not recommended that children under 10 years old wear jewelry that cannot easily break away or be removed. For younger children, we do have a selection of beaded, removable bracelets.\n\nWHAT IF MY BRACELET BREAKS?\n\nAs with all fine jewelry, you may experience daily wear and tear over time. We recommend using extreme caution when performing activities that may be prone to having the chain get snagged or caught and result in breaking.\n\n– If your bracelet breaks at the welded jump ring within 2 weeks of purchase, rewelding will be done free of charge. Lost chains will not be replaced.\n\n– If at any point you need to remove your bracelet, you can contact MMIX to arrange for reattachment for $15 plus tax.\n\nWHAT IF I DECIDE I DON’T LIKE MY PERMANENT JEWELRY?\n\nPlease see the instructions on how to remove your permanent jewelry. As permanent jewelry is custom-sized, all sales are final. However, you can discuss options for adding a clasp to your chain with a MMIX consultant."
