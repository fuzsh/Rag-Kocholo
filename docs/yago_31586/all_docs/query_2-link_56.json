        "text": "Champagne Brimoncourt\n\nMMIX Cuvée Millésime 2009\n\nThe Champagne MMIX Cuvée Millésime 2009 by Maison Brimoncourt is the result of a blend of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Noir, from a parcel selection of the best grapes of the generous and sunny 2009 vintage. Vinification and first fermentation occurred in stainless steel vats, maturation for over 10 years on its own yeasts with a final dosage of only 5 g/l - making it an Extra Brut.\n\n2009 was a particularly warm year whereas the winter frosts allowed the vineyard to rest pleasantly and the seasons continued with a very sunny and dry spring, followed by a similar summer until the harvest. The harvested grapes were smaller than usual, but with a much higher concentration of aromas. The Chardonnay grapes harvested earlier retained a beautiful freshness and precise minerality, while the Pinot Noir grapes were ripe and very concentrated and brought complexity and richness to the blend of this \"exceptional\" Cuvée.\n\nThe Champagne MMIX Cuvée Millésime 2009 has a light golden colour, very fine and persistent bubbles and a generous sparkle on the surface. The nose is decidedly elegant and complex, well defined by a minerality that reflects its terroir and suggests notes of citrus, quince, mirabelle plum, toasted hazelnut and brioche. The palate is intense and continues with a breadth and a finish marked by freshness in a very \"Brimoncourt\" style.\n\nChampagne Brimoncourt\n\nIn 2008, Alexandre Cornot revived the dormant Maison Brimoncourt to transform it into a bright and bold Maison de Champagne. Not afraid to go off the beaten track, he left his career as a successful lawyer in New York and returned to his home region to realise his vision. The project took over 5 years of uninterrupted hard work and many meetings to find the right partners and build the relationships of trust that would ensure the longevity of the Maison's style.\n\nThe Maison Brimoncourt harks back to the original DNA of Champagne, when it became fashionable at the royal court during the Esprit Régence, a timeless tribute that is true to its origins. The Maison carries the values of elegance, sharing, independence and lightness. From 2013 to today, the Maison Brimoncourt has developed a vibrant and creative brand with strong personalities who share a common vision and passion for this wonderful wine. The Maison's Champagnes are born in Aÿ, in the historic heart of the Champagne vineyard, in buildings and gardens that are almost bicentenary. For the selection and sourcing of the grapes, the Maison relies on the best crus: Chardonnay, characterised by floral notes, come from the best harvests of the Côte des Blancs (Avize, Oger, Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, Chouilly...), while Pinot Noir and Meunier come from the Montagne de Reims and the Vallée de la Marne (Aÿ, Hautvillers, Mailly, Avenay, Bouzy...).\n\nQuality, high standards and boldness are the main ingredients of all the Cuvées, where François Huré, Chef de Cave - a master in the art of blending, strives to respect the terroir of origin. With its free spirit and nourished by the quest for excellence, the Maison Brimoncourt creates Champagnes with the right combination of status and lightness, expressing joyful refinement and relaxed elegance, high quality and profound freshness.\n\nFor orders over EUR 300.00, FREE shipping costs throughout EUROPE.
