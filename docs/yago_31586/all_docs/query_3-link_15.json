        "text": "MMIX is superior to MIX in just about every way. Fascicle 1 of Volume 1 explains why, in detail. Fortunately, if you've already learned MIX, learning MMIX shouldn't be too hard.\n\nRewriting the exercises you have already completed in MIX should not be difficult in MMIX; if it is, it suggests that you don't really grasp the algorithms in question.\n\nRemember: the vast majority of the algorithms in TAOCP are described in English, not in MIX or MMIX.\n\nHowever: if your goal is to be a \"real software engineer\", or even to be better at algorithms, TAOCP may not be the best place to start.\n\nI'd recommend you take a look at the MIT OCW \"Introduction to Algorithms\" course taught by Leiserson and Erik Demaine. You can find links to it, along with a nice commentary, at http://www.catonmat.net/blog/mit-introduction-to-algorithms-part-one\n\nDonald Knuth will convert the new editions of TAOCP to use MMIX. So the new volume, that just came out Volume 4A on Combinatorial Algorithms is already using the new MMIX. So if you want to read the new stuff, you need MMIX anyway. The support for MMIX relative to MIX is also becomming better. Check the MMIX repository at http://www.mmix.cs.hm.edu it contains executables for windows and linux and all kind of documentation. Last not least, MMIX has a sophisticated pipeline simulator, that comes very close to real modern machines, and MIX is not anything like it. So for someone with a serious interest MMIX is recomended.
