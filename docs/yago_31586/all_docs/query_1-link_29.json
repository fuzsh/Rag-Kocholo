        "text": "Donald Ervin Knuth was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 10, 1938. He received his BS and MS degrees from Case Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1963.\n\nKnuth is probably best known for his three-volume work, The Art of Computer Programming, which popularized the analysis of algorithms as a basic tool of computer science.\n\nKnuth is responsible for the theory of LR parsing, which he invented in a 1965 article.\n\nKnuth is the recipient of many awards, including the 1974 Turing award (computer science's highest award).\n\nIn his spare time, Knuth enjoys playing the pipe organ.\n\nSources\n\nD.
