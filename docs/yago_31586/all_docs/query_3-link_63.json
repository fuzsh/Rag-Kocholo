        "text": "Any guesses as to what that title means? I recently got a new necklace that I absolutely adore with the roman numerals V.XXIII.MMIX engraved on it.\n\nIt‚Äôs actually our wedding date! May 23, 2009. What a fun day that was. I married my best friend and here we over nine years later! It is so hard for me to believe that next year we will be celebrating our ten year anniversary! Whaaaaat?\n\nIt has definitely not been a cake walk, but I feel so blessed to have Price Donahoo as my person. As frustrating as he can be sometimes (and I‚Äôm absolutely certain the feeling is mutual), we have kept our covenant before God and our loved ones to stick together forever. Thankfully, the good times overshadow the bad, and for that I‚Äôm so grateful! God has been good to us!\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm extra excited about this necklace because (1) it‚Äôs silver, which I decided I needed to start incorporating more of back into my jewelry wardrobe, (2) I‚Äôm getting close to the point in pregnancy where my rings historically stop fitting on my fingers so this will be a great way to ‚Äúwear my marriage‚Äù when I can‚Äôt get those rings over my fat knuckles anymore, and (3) it‚Äôs a great conversation starter! People ask me every day what it means and it‚Äôs fun to share! It‚Äôs opened up several pretty cool convos, so when I look at it in the morning, it reminds me to pray that God would maybe use me and my words to speak to someone who might need a little encouragement in the husband/wife department. On the flip side, I pray that it might also open up a conversation that will encourage me when I‚Äôm in need of a little encouragement in the marriage department!\n\nSo overall, it‚Äôs a beautiful, well-made necklace that I‚Äôve really enjoyed wearing and would definitely recommend. I think it would make a great gift to a bride. And this brand, oNecklace, has several really beautiful pieces that I particularly love. Like these custom signature necklaces. Super cool, right?! I just love those. I know of several friends who have the signature of parents they‚Äôve recently lost on a necklace and I think that is so special!\n\nSide note: Is anyone else ready for all things fall?! I do heart summer, but I‚Äôm ready for a shift to some cooler temps. Perhaps my ginormous belly has something to do with that! üòâ It felt like fall to me one day last week so I totally dressed the part. And loved every second of it.\n\n// A few plaid blazers I‚Äôm loving //\n\n// Some pretty fall-toned maxis //\n\n// some pretty silver jewels to compliment your oNecklace pieces! //\n\nI hope y‚Äôall are having the BEST week so far. Thank you for stopping by today! It means the world to me! XOXOX!"
