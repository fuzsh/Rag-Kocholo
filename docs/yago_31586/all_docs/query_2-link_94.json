        "text": "Used commonly until about the 14th Century, Roman Numerals served as a tool for everyone in Western cultures. Eventually this system was replaced by the Hindu-Arabic number system, which was more advantageous for mathematics and other more complex uses. The more modern version of the Roman Numerals system is based on several Roman letters that associate with a particular integer/number (some of these Roman letters are X, V, D). Put it simply, here is a list of the 7 different letters and what numerical value they hold:\n\nTo get a head start on how these work, take a look at this next table - it has many common numbers that are used to convert regular numbers to Roman Numerals or vice-versa. With some help from the table above, can you identify any patterns? What rules do you think they’re using?\n\nIf you’ve gone through these tables, you might have realized what some of the rules are. If not, you will find the rules that one needs to abide by in order to write any number as a Roman Numeral successfully:\n\nIf you want a number that is a multiple of one of the 7 letters they use, its value is the sum of that value of that letter how many ever times it appears. For example: III = 3 because we repeated three I’s and I is 1."
