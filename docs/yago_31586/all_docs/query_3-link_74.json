        "text": "MMIXlib\n\nMMIXware is made up of multiple programs, including an assembler and a simulator. Details can be found at the homepage here: http://mmix.cs.hm.edu. When browsing the SVN trunk I noticed a project called MMIXlib. This is a refactoring effort by Martin Ruckert to partition the original MMIX tools into something he could integrate into an IDE. I decided to use this as the base for how I would plug into the MMIX assembler and simulator.\n\nOne thing that is surprising if you haven't seen it before is MMIXware being written in CWEB, This is a literate programming system developed by Donald Knuth. The CWEB files compile to C, but I needed to install all of texlive to do so. There is a rule that you are not to change the original source code but only apply CWEB style \"change files\". This allows the entire refactoring to actually be a layer of explained changes applied to the original MMIXware.\n\nWhen I was working through the compilation process, I found a couple of errors in MMIXlib, and also I suggested a small enhancement to the Makefile. As is tradition with Donald Knuth's projects, there was a reward for finding errors in MMIXware. Even though I think my contribution was small I'm proud to have gotten a MMIX shirt for the contribution."
