He has written dozens of books and hundreds of articles on mathematics and computer science, and has influenced the thinking of countless students of computer science.\n\nHe also invented the typesetting language TeX (pronounced \"tech,\" using the ch sound from \"loch\"), which remains a worldwide standard for technical publishing. In The Art of Computer Programming, Knuth wryly compares a computer program to a recipe by quoting from McCall's Cookbook. He received his Ph.D. degree in mathematics from Caltech in 1963."
