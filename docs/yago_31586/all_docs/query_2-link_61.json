        "text": "WHEN STARS ALIGN…\n\nHave you ever wondered what the fashion world was doing the year crypto was invented? I hadn’t either, but while I was brainstorming ideas for a fashion-themed NFT collection, I decided I should look into the year that cryptocurrency was created to spark some inspiration. What I discovered was a synchronicity that both delighted and amused me– I share a birthday with Bitcoin. Officially minted on January 3rd, 2009 (myself nearly 25 years prior), it got me thinking about our shared zodiac sign.\n\nWe are the trusty Capricorns; ambitious, stoic, practical, and known as the hardest working sign of the zodiac. Maybe not the most romantic assessment of our character, but I was struck with an idea…\n\nI would create twelve portraits based on the 12 zodiac signs, highlighting the most memorable runway looks from 2009, the year Bitcoin was created. Each zodiac sign would feature one of my unique fashion characters dressed in a look by a particular designer.\n\nNFT COLLECTION\n\nMy fashion-themed, character-based NFT zodiac collection is called \"Celestial Bodies MMIX.” Each portrait was carefully hand painted using gouache– a water based paint with a beautiful matte finish. Meticulously hand painted florals and foliage frame each zodiac character– each illuminated by a digitally added starry sky. Corresponding zodiac symbols have been included in each portrait, along with a Bitcoin symbol to honor the year of crypto’s launch. The “Bitcoin Capricorn” features the largest Bitcoin symbol in celebration of the currency’s (and my) birthday. There will be 100 editions of each zodiac sign available for minting, with a grand total of 1,200 limited editions.\n\nCelestial Bodies MMIX drops on OpenSea at 8:33am PST on Sunday, March 20th, 2022, also known as the Spring Equinox. This time and date holds special significance as it marks the start of the astrological new year, which begins when the sun enters Aries (the first sign of the zodiac) in the Northern Hemisphere. The first day of spring represents a time of new beginnings and rejuvenation, wholeness and balance.\n\nARTIST BACKGROUND:\n\nI have been a full-time fashion and beauty illustrator for the past 9 years, collaborating with brands such as Dior, Prada and Nike. My study of fashion illustration, combined with my fascination with Disney animation and a strange obsession with Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice, lead me to create my signature style of impossibly long-necked females donned in haute couture.\n\nSelf-reflection and internally exploratory practices have always been a big part of my life, and to me, astrology represents just that. It’s a form of self-introspection, providing comfort and guidance in uncertain times. It can shine light on friendships, relationships and our own inner wiring, and its spiritual aspect has made it an alternative to religion for some.\n\nAs an artist, I am always looking for ways to connect with people, and I saw this spark of an idea as an opportunity to pay tribute to the uniqueness that is each of us. I hope to create a community that is bonded over unusual, yet enchanting artwork, and the cosmic beauty of celestial navigation."
