La Porteuse de pain is a novel from the end of the 19th century which was a lasting success given the number of adaptations (Maurice Cloche would direct another in 1963, and there was a TV soap opera in 1973). The book was even re-edited (in pocket format) when the series was broadcast.

Coming back to the film, it's a very pleasant work to follow. It is well done (despite some modifications or simplifications, the novel is respected - except perhaps in the final scenes - when we find the letter that Jeanne believed lost, and which could exonerate her). The film could be criticized for taking certain scenes (notably those with Jean Tissier) towards comedy, which it seems to me was not the case in the 1963 and 1973 versions (I don't have not seen the one from 1933).

As for the sets and costumes, it is neat. It doesn't smell like a big budget, but it still has an effect (NB film shot at Cinecitta). The interpretation is good. It's an Italian-French co-production, so the cast includes Italian actors. If they appear convincing, the post-sync (satisfying, unlike a lot of period dubbing) serves them up a bit.
