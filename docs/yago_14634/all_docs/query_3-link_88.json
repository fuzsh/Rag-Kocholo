However, a “genre” that is rather unfamiliar to large audiences is its crucial and enduring affair with literature. In fact, from the very beginning, literature deeply influenced how Italian cinema defined itself and grew.1 This book provides an empirical approach to this complex and fruitful relationship. The aim is to present discussions of meaningful Italian film adaptations from literary material that greatly exemplify the vastness of modes, viewpoints, and attitudes produced by such an alliance throughout the different epochs. Included among the adaptations discussed, are those that have followed trends and critical debates, and, at times, have rendered them more problematic. The book consists of four essays dealing with theoretical issues, and of twenty close-studies, divided into categories, highlighting the major approaches to adaptation. This preface supplies a concise historical account of this practice, and provides the framework for approaching the close-studies. In Italian cinema, the first literary adaptations date back to 1907 and involved the much abbreviated versions of international classics, including a superb series on Shakespeare’s tragedies, which have recently been restored, as well as other wonders. The short duration of these abridged versions, conceived to entertain and at the same time to educate the public, explains why the term for adaptation in Italian was riduzione (reduction), a word that directly and fully pertains to the quantitative, rather than the qualitative characteristics. According to the producers of the epoch, who 1\n\nOn the subject of interdisciplinary approaches to the study of the relationship between cinema and literature (in Italy) see, for example, the book West and Costa. For an analysis of cinematic influences on literary language see Bonsaver, McLaughlin and Pellegrini 2007.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nwere trying to interpret the rules of the market, a literary source almost certainly guaranteed the success of a film. This clarifies why the spectrum of cinematic adaptations was relatively large, and did not only include the classics: it also drew material from the “best-sellers” of the time. Since the first decade of cinematic production, this unashamed mix of highbrow and lowbrow material constituted the cultural legitimization of the new industry and, at the same time, a way of capturing the largest range of tastes and social classes possible. In 1908, the first two film adaptations of Italian novels were released: Alessandro Manzoni’s classic I promessi sposi and Francesco Mastriani’s popular La sepolta viva. As Bragaglia states: Scelte emblematiche, che sembrano preludere a quello che diverrà lo stabile rapporto tra cinema e letteratura: da un lato si cerca ‘autenticazione’ nei classici (sia pure quelli che si trovano in ogni piccola biblioteca), dall’altro ci si rivolge al romanzo d’appendice, tentando così di soddisfare (per riprendere l’immagine dannunziana) sia la dama che la plebea (Bragaglia 1993, 9).2 Emblematic choices that seem to presage what will become the stable relationship between cinema and literature: on one hand there is the search for “authentication” in the classics (even those that are found in small libraries), on the other hand an interest in appendix novels, trying to satisfy (to recall D’Annunzio’s image) both the lady and the plebeian/working girl.\n\nAlthough the theories and analysis of adaptation have dealt, with the question of fidelity (Mitry 1971; Fried 1987; Marcus 1993; Stam 2000) for at least the past thirty years, it has finally been decided to worry less about “faithfulness,” and more about “readings, critiques, interpretations, and rewritings of prior material” (Stam 2000, 76). Since the beginning of Italian cinema, all this concern appears to have centered on a false problem. Firstly, because the fidelity issue, as is the case with any preconception, has to be inscribed into a broader and more complex context of “originality” and “transmission of traditions.” Secondly, because the problem of fidelity, if present at all, has often been of secondary concern for Italian theorists or proto-theorists. Adaptation has been such a significant and common practice since the dawn of cinema, that an urge to speculate about this recently created “genre” soon spread in specialized magazines and other similar publications. Practice, and what one might today call proto-theories, were 2\n\nAll translations are ours, unless otherwise noted.\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n3\n\nborn together and continued to proliferate alongside each other: their interrelationship, which was often very controversial, is key to understand Italian cinema as a whole, both in its past and present incarnations. At that time, for instance, commentators were especially concerned with the success of the visual effects and the techniques of the new medium, rather than with the actual rendition of the supposed “original” message and/or effects. One of the reasons for this position can be explained by the environment in which this kind of debate appeared. In the early 20th century, the debates and essays about cinematic adaptations were not accepted for publication in the cultural or literary magazines of the day, nor were they included in the daily or weekly popular publications. They were published, almost exclusively, by film magazines, and were primarily dedicated to the analysis of the development of filmic language, rather than comparing it to actual novels or poetry. The presence of literary personalities in the film industry, during those years, oscillated between a few to none, so that any question of the fidelity of the new medium to the old medium was hardly relevant. The readership of such magazines was almost fully composed of non-specialized readers, who were far more attracted by the beauty and charm of the stars of the silver screen than by any other matter, (as is more or less the case today) Se è un dramma o una commedia che si deve produrre, sia su basi storiche o romantiche, deve essere tracciata in precedenza con gli stessi metodi di cui si serve il poeta per scrivere i propri lavori. Solo, l’azione cinematografica essendo più rapida, è necessario che il fatto sia abbreviato, spogliandolo di particolari inutili, ma facendo risaltare invece i momenti salienti della concezione (Micciché 1980, 93).3 If it is a drama or comedy that needs to be produced, on either a historical or romantic basis, it should be outlined beforehand with the same methods used by a poet in writing his own works. But, because the cinematographic action is faster, it is necessary that the fact is abbreviated, depriving it of useless details and instead underlining the relevant moments of its conception.\n\n3\n\nThe quote continues: “Abbreviare però non vuol dire quel rincorrersi di personaggi e di gesti, quei cambiamenti repentini di movimenti che stancano la vista, intorbidano la mente, confondono la chiarezza del soggetto, producendo un affastellamento di azioni delle quali nulla resta di poesia, di vita, di arte” [To abbreviate does not mean chasing after characters and gestures, those sudden changes that tire the eye, that trouble the mind, and confuse the clarity of the subject, producing a bundling of actions in which nothing remains of poetry, life or art] (Micciché 1980, 93).\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis anonymous article from 1910 is strictly focused on the method of film crafting, and decidedly oriented towards a fast, concise production, therefore omitting any useless details. If this search for essentiality appeared, among other things, to have been initially dictated by the technical constraints of the medium—before 1910 films were on average no longer than 400 or 500 meters—by 1912 however, the new industrial possibilities made it feasible to produce feature films from 1000 to 1500 meters in length, and even film a puntate (i.e. serial films). According to some detractors of the films, this would prevent the “sacrilegious mutilation” of the literary pantheon (Micciché 1980, 156). It is easy to assume, then, that “l’abbreviatio” was not a forced choice, given the primitive technology of the time; it was instead the preferred modus operandi for cinematic creation.4 In any case, the way in which directors and screenwriters understood the shortening of the plot is very complex and based, at times, on individual idiosyncrasies, and therefore not relevant for the current discussion. The early preoccupation with finding an organic language for the new medium, something “faster” than literature, but not as “furious” in terms of the speed of production (as other industrial productions required), continued over subsequent years.5 Dynamism and realistic representation were a prerequisite for the new medium, as Egisto Roggero persuasively asserts in a 1914 issue of La vita Cinematografica: mentre nella letteratura la parola deve dar vita a tutto un mondo ideale, qui—ove la parola tace—è la vita stessa, ch’è movimento continuo […] e, ripeto, continuo, che forma l’ininterrotto romanzo, o dramma, o commedia che noi viviamo ogni giorno e che chiamiamo vita. La vita è dunque un’azione continua: e l’azione è la base unica e vera d’ogni quadro che si proietta sullo schermo (Micciché 1980, 228, emphasis added).\n\n4\n\nFor instance, Luciano Zúccoli wrote in 1913: “Nella creazione di soggetti per la cinematografia, si deve tener conto di due caratteristiche di questa nuova arte: la potenza della sintesi e la larghezza e varietà della scena” [In the creation of subjects for the cinema, it is important to consider two characteristics of this new art: the power of the synthesis and the width and variety of the scene] (Micciché 1980, 193). See also Dall’Asta and Bertellini 2000, 300-307. 5 In 1913 La vita cinematografica publishes an article by a.l.p. that opens the discussion about the need for professional writers to participate in the scripts. According to it, directors won’t hire writers because they ignore “numerose conoscenze tecniche” [numerous technical knowledge] a common knowledge among screenwriters (Micciché 1980, 184). See also Micciché 227-231.\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n5\n\nWhile in literature the word needs to give life to a whole ideal world, here—where the word is silent—it is life itself, that is a continuous movement […] and, I repeat, continuous, that forms the uninterrupted novel, or drama, or comedy that we live every day and that we call life. Life is therefore a continuous action: and the action is the single and only true base of every painting that is projected onto the screen.\n\nIn this respect, it is very productive to see how the action/acting duality had been perceived in the American magazine Moving Picture World just two years before: “It looks very much as if Edison and the foreigners were the only ones not bitten by the lightning bug, with the result that his releases are, to my mind, the only ones that are really drama. The others have lots of action, but no acting and no chance for any” (Brewster 1997, 109).6 The two quotes exemplify the gap between Italy’s perception of its own cinema, a combination of action and drama, and the foreign perception of it as a dichotomy between identical terms. By 1916, the discussion shifted towards the necessity of not only finding original screenplays—at last a departure from literature—but also towards separating cinema from other art forms,, especially its closest relative, the theatre. The main principle under discussion, at that time, could be summed up as “avvalersi delle risorse che il cinematografo possiede” [making use of the resources that cinema possesses] (Micciché 1980, 283) to record reality. This was the possibility of a truthful reproduction of “qualsiasi cielo, quasiasi (sic) vastità di orizzonti, varietà di paesaggi, qualsiasi elemento della nature” [any kind of sky, any vastness of horizons, variety of landscapes, any elements of nature] (285); in short, the mechanical possibility of duplicating the world by means of photography in motion. Obviously, the opposite topic, though connected, was cinema’s potential to create “alternative” realities, i.e. “costruendo nella fotografia impressioni e fenomeni che non possiamo suscitare e creare nella nostra vita” [through photography constructing impressions and phenomena that we cannot conceive of and create in our life] (285). It is useful to remember to what extent critics, as well as early directors, perceived the style of cinematic language as an autonomous art that needed not only to be differentiated, but rather to be severed from other forms of artistic creation. Although undeclared but fully understood, what was at stake there was the increasing importance of montage, the ultimate device to alter actuality, something that in following years would become arguably the primary “constituent” of cinema. According to Rosso, the use of “reality” did not mean that a production had to be exclusively interested 6\n\nOn the binary action vs. acting style see Gambacorti 2003, 101.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nin “‘serie dal vero’: il dramma ci deve essere—più intenso, più ricco di movimento, più rapido che nel teatro—ma il meraviglioso contributo della natura, della realtà multiforme deve penetrarvi come un soffio d’aria libera e pura” [in “episodes from reality” drama needs to be present—more intense, richer in movements, faster than in theatre—but the marvelous contribution of nature, of multiform reality must penetrate like a breath of free and pure air] (285, emphasis added). Several months later, another journalist, Giuseppe Lega, begged for the end of adaptations,7 because “il cinematografo vuole azione non analisi d’anime; movimento non stasi o acrobatismi di passioni e sentimenti…” [cinema wants actions and not analysis of souls, movements nor stillness, nor jiggling of passions and sentiments…] ( 333). Although this last request was never heeded, having added little to the discussion at hand, it still represented a compelling way of conceptualizing adaptation at the time. It should now become evident that the interest in vitality, action and movement in cinema was the focus of the debates, since by then everyone was conscious of the fact that what really distinguished films from books and even from theatre, was its dynamism and the visual turbulence that captivated the spectator. Cinema has since learnt how to capitalize on this difference, and has sought its own language. More important than the question of fidelity in understanding or measuring the relationship between films and books is the struggle between two different languages that both attract and repel each other. Gian Piero Brunetta understands the early relationship between cinema and literature as clearly “parasitical” (Brunetta 1976, 1) and explains: Nella partita di dare e avere che letteratura e cinema hanno aperto fin dall’inizio del Novecento, i debiti del secondo si sono venuti accumulando per lungo tempo senza possibilità alcuna di contropartita. Ciò potrebbe spiegare la mia scelta di dare una vettorialità prevalente al discorso nel senso letteraturaocinema, in quanto, nonostante lo sforzo compiuto dal cinema fin dagli esordi per conquistare una propria autonomia espressiva, la sua storia è anche storia di un rapporto continuo ed interrotto con le strutture letterarie che lo precedono e lo condizionano (1).\n\n7\n\n“Auguriamoci, subito, che l’epidemia attaccaticcia delle riduzioni passi, e passi presto. Soprattutto delle riduzioni del teatro, che è quanto di più banale e illogico e antitetico si possa compiere” [Let us hope that the craziness for adaptations will soon disappear. Especially, those taken from theatre, which is the most illogical, banal and antithetic thing one could do] (Micciché 1980, 332).\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n7\n\nIn the game of give and take that literature and cinema initiated at the beginning of the 20th century, the debts of the latter kept piling up for a long time without any chance of a rematch. This could explain my choice of wishing to give a prevalent vectoriality to the literatureocinema discourse, because, in spite of the cinema struggle, since its beginning, to achieve its own expressive autonomy, the story of cinema is also the story of a continuous and interrupted relationship with the literary structures that precede it and condition it.\n\nAccording to Brunetta, this early ‘parasitical’ relationship changed radically with the advent of sound: “l’avvento della parola, alla fine degli anni venti, sconvolge l’assetto teorico e lo sforzo espressivo di raggiungere una totale autonomia” (Brunetta 1976, 4) (towards the end of the 1920s, the advent of sound, upsets the theoretical system and the expressive effort to reach a total autonomy). As voice appeared on the scene, even more intellectuals answered positively to the call of writing scripts and dialogues for the newly relevant media. Among their ranks were such professional authors as Cecchi, Pirandello, Soldati, Viviani, Zavattini, Alvaro, Marotta, Debenedetti—all with ongoing and stable careers. Therefore, the employment of literary subjects persisted even with the invention of sound. Indeed, the first Italian talkie8 is La canzone dell’amore (1930), directed by Gennaro Righelli and loosely based on the novella In silenzio by Luigi Pirandello. Although considered almost unanimously a dreadful film, La canzone dell’amore is pivotal for many reasons. To begin with, it anticipates, although symbolically, the strong liaison between the “second part” of film history (that of sound cinema) and the world of the novel. Righelli’s extremely loose adaptation of Pirandello underlines the irrelevance of fidelity, in the translation process, between the two art forms. Secondly, according to Brunetta, its huge success was linked to the leit-motiv of the song Solo per te Lucia (Brunetta 1979, 232), thus instantly connecting the new marvel of cinema with catchy songs in the collective unconscious of the audience. This music connection was further developed through the huge interest in the merging of opera and the big screen (Brunetta 1979, 233). Finally, as the ultimate expression of sound, music permitted the desirable, new technical language of cinema to reach full maturity and discarded the vestiges of a sponging relationship with literature, by offering something that literature could not. The film presents\n\n8\n\nThe first truly spoken film produced in Italy was Resurrezione, by Alessandro Blasetti, production finished in 1930, but only distributed one year later.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction un insolito dinamismo dei movimenti di macchina e sfrutta la profondità di campo visiva e sonora (voce e canzoni off) in modo originale. Tra le scene più significative in questo senso c’è un vero e proprio piano sequenza (da un gruppo di giovani per la strada si passa all’incontro tra i due protagonisti nascosti dietro un albero e poi si ritorna di nuovo ai ragazzi), dove il virtuosismo registico riesce a creare quell’atmosfera liricosentimentale che l’intreccio e i personaggi contribuiscono solo a banalizzare (Mereghetti , 297). an unusual dynamism of the machine’s movements and exploits the depth of field vision and sound (voice and songs off) in an original way. Among the most significant of such scenes, is a true long shot that goes from a group of youths in the street, to the meeting of the two protagonists hidden behind a tree, and then all the way back to the youths again). Here the director’s virtuosity succeeds in creating that lyrical-sentimental atmosphere, which the plot and the characters only trivialize with their contributions.\n\nHowever, cinema in Italy (as elsewhere) continued to “use” literature, but, from the 1930s on with a different attitude. With the advent of sound, screenwriters gained space and centrality in the industrial process of film because of the prominence of spoken dialogues which, at that point, were far more articulated than their predecessor, the inter-text. Cinema was thus extremely hungry for professional writers who were at ease creating conversation pieces. The 1930s and the first half of the 1940s was the period when the exchange between the two worlds really ignited. Before 1940, four films were based on Pirandello’s novellas; Corrado Alvaro and Vitaliano Brancati actively participated in the writing of screenplays; and Emilio Cecchi, who had started managing the Cines studio in Rome in 1932, began recruiting major literary figures such as Pirandello, Alvaro, and Levi as scriptwriters and advisors, while being involved in many other cinematographic productions. Two other preeminent figures of the Italian literary landscape, Cesare Zavattini and Mario Soldati, stepped into the world of cinema at this moment, and their cinematographic careers will be just as successful and long-lived as their experiences in literature. During the years of Fascism, the trend in adaptations was undoubtedly that of translating novels and plays removed from the social realities of the time: an attitude typical of the fascist ideology and that became ever more acute when the war began, though unwillingly, leaving room for exceptions. Aside from a few classics,9 favorite sources derived from: the literature of 9\n\nMost notable, Carlo Campogalliani’s Il medico per forza (1931), taken from Medicin malgré lui by Molière, starring a brilliant Petrolini; Manon Lescaut by Prevost, made film by Carmine Gallone in 1940; I due Foscari by Byron, directed\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n9\n\nthe turn of the of the century, i.e. from the 19th to the 20th century,10 historical themes such as Blasetti’s Ettore Fieramosca (1938) by Massimo D’Azeglio, and contemporary narratives and plays mostly concerned with the sentimental problems of the bourgeoisie11—the public Mussolini was most eager to get consensus from. Together with a couple of national treasures, such as a I promessi sposi by Camerini, and a La locandiera by Chiarini, directors mostly used works from consolatory the classics for middle-class sentiments, notably Edmondo De Amicis,12 some works by Giovanni Verga13 and an abundant use of popular novels, among which\n\nby Enrico Fulchignoni in 1942 (a silent version had already been made in 1923 by Mario Almirante); and Dente per dente (1943) by Marco Elter, based on Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure. 10 For instance, Luigi Capuana, whose work was adapted by Luigi Mannini and Gustavo Serena in Zaganella e il cavaliere (1932), based on the play Lu cavaleri Pedagna (1909), and by Ferdinando Maria Poggioli in Gelosia (1942), based on the famous novel Il marchese di Roccaverdina (1901); in 1940 Poggioli also brought to the screen Addio giovinezza, a play by Nino Oxilia and Sandro Camasio (1911), in 1942 Morte civile, a play by Paolo Giacometti (1861) which had previously been adapted for the screen three times (by Lo Savio, Del Colle, and Bencivenga, in 1910, 1913, and 1919, respectively) and Aldo Palazzeschi’s Sorelle Materassi (1934); Matilde Serao was adapted by Luigi Charini in Via delle cinque lune (1942) based on the 1889 tale O Giovannino o la morte, and by Gianni Franciolini in Addio, amore! (1943) based on the homonymous novel (1890), and on Castigo (1914). 11 Among others, the plays by Giuseppe Giacosa Come le foglie (1900) and Tristi amori (1887) were turned into films in 1934 and in 1943 by Mario Camerini, and Carmine Gallone, respectively; and the comedies by Alfredo Testoni, Il cardinale Lambertini (1905), Il successo (1911), El noster prossum (1910), were adapted for the screen by Parsifal Bassi in 1934), Mario Bonnard (as L’albero di Adamo) in 1936, and Gherardo Gherardi with the collaboration of Aldo Rossi in 1943, respectively. It is worth noting that both authors had already been used as sources for several silent cinema productions. 12 De Amicis’ works had already been used extensively during the 1910’s and 20’s when four films were based on episodes from his internationally successful Cuore (1886). In 1942, Flavio Calzavara, with the help of Corrado Alvaro on the script, realized a version of a tale taken from La vita militare (1868) titled Carmela (1942). The following year, Calzavara adapted one of the most famous episodes of Cuore, Dagli Appennini alle Ande. A later reduction of Cuore (1948) was made by Duilio Coletti and Vittorio De Sica, who also played the leading role. 13 Amleto Palermi, a director who worked extensively in the silent era, produced in a version of the Cavalleria Rusticana in 1939, by far Verga’s most cinematographed work (four versions were made just between 1910 and 1924). Four years later, Gennaro Righelli directed La storia di una capinera.\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nEmilio Salgari’s adaptations predominated.14 The general tendency was thus for cinematographers to use literature as a well-stocked pond from which to fish when in search of an instant success. During the post war period, despite the famous anti-literary bias of Neo-Realism that Zavattini emphatically promoted (and which was sustained by critics such as Carlo Bo and Luigi Chiarini), it is both remarkable and indicative of the long-lasting relationship between cinema and literature that, out of what could arguably be considered the triad of neo-realist masterpieces—Paisà, La terra trema and Ladri di biciclette— the latter two were based on novels (Verga’s I Malavoglia and Bartolini’s homonymous book): a reality that reflected the general trend of regarding literature as a warehouse of possible stories. Moreover, neo-realist critics and filmmakers who gravitated around the journal Cinema and whose ideas laid the ground for Ossessione (1943, itself a free adaptation of Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice) by Visconti, made Verga and verism their cultural point of departure, notwithstanding controversy from certain critics who championed cinematic autonomy. Interestingly enough though, La terra trema, which represents Visconti’s highest tribute to Verga, is a film where the literary adaptation is used to mark the independence of cinema. Later on, in his critical re-reading of tradition, Visconti continued to adapt the classics (i.e. Boito’s Senso, Tomasi’s Il Gattopardo, and D’Annunzio L’innocente) in order to express a need for a cinema of ideas based on literature as a privileged source of inspiration. His cinema provided a sophisticated interpretation of reality that would serve as a critical analysis for the creation of a new society. Whereas non-neo-realist cinema had a mostly diminishing effect on its literary sources through didactic and dreary revisions, it is Visconti and De Sica (I bambini ci guardano, La ciociara, L’oro di Napoli)15 who fully succeeded in rejuvenating their sources. Yet, the “soon-to-be” classic narrators of the neo-realist era, Vittorini, Pavese and Calvino, did not have much of a relationship with cinema 14\n\nOnce again, it is Palermi who directs the first sound version of a Salgari novel, Il corsaro nero in 1937. After that, a cascade of Salgari’s adaptations follows: La figlia del corsaro verde (1940) and I pirati della Malesia (1941) by Enrico Guazzoni; Le due tigri (1942) by Giorgio Simonelli; I cavalieri del deserto (1942) by Gino Talamo and Osvaldo Valenti, screenplay by Federico Fellini and Vittorio Mussolini; Capitan Tormenta (1942), Capitan Tempesta (1942) and Il leone di Damasco (1942) by Corrado D'Errico; Il figlio del Corsaro Rosso (1943) and Gli ultimi filibustieri (1943) by Marco Elter. 15 The first was adapted from Viola’s Pricò, the second from Moravia and the latter from Giuseppe Marotta.\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n11\n\nalthough Calvino was a cinephile and a film critic,16 and Vittorini and Pavese were both influenced by cinema in their writings. In fact, it was not until 1955 that the posthumous adaptation of Pavese’s Tra donne sole by the young Antonioni (Le amiche) appeared, and one should wait twenty more years to see a novel by Vittorini turned into film, precisely Garofano rosso (1976) by Luigi Faccini. In the 1950’s, in the middle of what has been called a crisis of narrative structures, a remarkable group of screenwriters (Cecchi D’Amico, Guerra, Age, Scarpelli, etc.) often working together, created, along many original stories, several adaptations that were often convincing and compelling. However, the further one advances into the decade, the more the situation seems to stagnate, regardless of the increase in the employment of classic authors, especially Russians.17 Therefore, on a general level, one could say that the re-newed cinema industry used books as a mere repertoire to create products of innocuous entertainment. As Brunetta effectively describes it: La letteratura, vista e usata nella sua morfologia più ampia, anche in ambito neorealista, funziona così come un immenso giacimento di luoghi comuni, di idee ricevute, di situazioni e sentimenti consacrati e canonizzati. Nelle singole battute, nei gesti, nelle situazioni ripetute di film derivati da soggetti letterari, si ritrovano le regole che cerca di darsi e di rispettare un sistema produttivo che vuole ricostruirsi (Brunetta 1993, 302). Literature, seen and used in its more ample morphology, also in a neorealist environment, functions as an immense deposit of commonplaces, of received ideas, of situations and feelings, which have been consecrated and canonized. In its single lines, in the gestures and in the repeated situations of films derived by literary subjects, one again one encounter the rules of a new productive system that looks to reconstruct itself, to assign itself respect.\n\nIt is emblematic that Pasolini’s first film dates from 1960. The work of the Friulan poet—probably the finest and most accomplished example of a 16\n\nCalvino collaborated in cinema productions only once, co-writing with Arpino the screenplay of Monicelli’s Renzo e Luciana, an episode of Boccaccio 70 (1962). A few of his short stories has been used as ideas for films of the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, most notably the tale Furto in pasticceria for Monicelli’s I soliti ignoti (1958). The only case of adaptation of one of Calvino’s novels occurred in 1969 when Pino Zac directed Il cavaliere inesistente. 17 Visconti gave his personal reading of Dostoyevsky’s White Nights, in his 1957’s Le notti bianche; Alberto Lattuada’s rendition of Pushkin’s The Blizzard came out in 1958 under the title La tempesta; in 1959, Riccardo Freda adapted the novella Haji Murad by Leo Tolstoj, in a film titled Agi Murad il diavolo bianco.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nfamous, controversial, intellectual and author who becomes a leading screenplay writer and director18—might be seen as embodying the events of the decade. In fact, his “empirismo eretico” [heretical empiricism] throughout the sixties indicated the way to the abandonment of (conventional) literature in favor of cinema. In 1960, La dolce vita, written by Flaiano and Pinelli, with the help of Pasolini and Rondi, refused to follow the linear structure of the novel, in favor of a subgenre: the diary; thus, given the freedom of expression inherent to the medium, many writers began to approach cinema for inspiration.19 In general, during this time, novels (more rarely plays) were turned into films not just for the purposes of having a recognizable plot or ready-made material, but rather to express the directors’ visions and ideological stands. Among those used in cinematic adaptations, few authors did not belong to the 20th century (in particular Sophocles, Euripides, Boccaccio, Chaucer, Sade as filmed by Pasolini, and Petronio reworked by Fellini).20 Conversely, various works of the names that counted in the Italian literary pantheon of that period were transposed into films: Fenoglio, Moravia, Pratolini, Brancati, Cassola, Bassani, Tomasi di Lampedusa, Sciascia, Bianciardi, Carlo Levi,\n\n18\n\nOne should not forget that this era was “occupied” by another screenwriter with a strong, independent literary trajectory, Ennio Flaiano. Numerous other screenplay authors experienced considerable success as narrators (for example Tonino Guerra), and various directors composed both poetry (for instance, Bernardo Bertolucci and Nelo Risi) and narrative (Michelangelo Antonioni and Pasquale Festa Campanile, among others) at least once in their lives. 19 A few collaborations between soon-to-be famous directors and writers should be mentioned. L’Italia non è un paese povero (1960), the troubled documentary directed by Joris Ivens with the assistance of the Taviani brothers was born out of a collaboration between the three and Moravia. Bertolucci debuted as director with a screenplay written by Pasolini, La comare secca (1962). Worth remembering that Bertolucci’s third and fourth film are very free adaptations of Dostoyevsky’s The Double (Partner, 1968) and Borges’ Theme of the Traitor and the Hero (La strategia del ragno, 1970). Goffredo Parise collaborated with Ferreri in L’ape regina (1963). Alberto Arbasino co-wrote the screenplay of Amate sponde (1963) with director Mario Missiroli, adapting his own novel. Between 1967 and 1975, Ermanno Olmi and Corrado Stajano produced various television documentaries about Italy’s latest history; Olmi also co-wrote his Recuperanti (1969) with Mario Rigoni Stern. One of Rosi’s best film, Mani sulla città (1963) generated by the cooperation between the director and Raffaele La Capria, who also wrote the screenplay for another memorable Rosi’s feature, C’era una volta… (1967). 20 Noteworthy are a 1962’s version of Svevo’s Senilità by Carlo Lizzani and Alberto Lattuada’s La Mandragola (1965) by Machiavelli.\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n13\n\nand more.21 Each of these adaptations, though at times born out of the commercial success of the book, somehow reworked the original texts, creating fresh and compelling readings, without fear of great departures from the original stories. Best accomplishment of this trend could be the version of Cortázar’s tale The spider-web given by Antonioni in his masterpiece Blow up (1966). The 1970’s witnessed a great number of adaptations as well. A few were revisions of classics, such as Pasolini’s Decameron (1971); the tv-film Le avventure di Pinocchio directed by Luigi Comencini in 1972; Visconti’s last work, L’innocente (1976) by D’Annunzio and Casanova’s autobiography filmed by Fellini in Il Casanova (1976).22 However, the vast majority were films with a focus on problematic and unresolved matters of recent Italian history. These centered on both past and contemporary—and still “hot”—issues. In fact, not only were these films about the rise of Socialism (as in Bolognini’s Metello, based on Pratolini’s novel) and about Fascism (Bertolucci reading of Moravia’s Il conformista), but there were also films about the 1968 turmoil (Pietrangeli’s Porci con le ali, based on the novel by Radice and Ravera), about terrorism (Cerami’s Un borghese piccolo piccolo adapted by Monicelli), and about political corruption (Elio Petri’s version of Todo modo by Sciascia).23 By the end of the decade, though, the situation had 21\n\nBest examples are Vitaliano Brancati’s Il bell’Antonio transposed in 1960 by Mauro Bolognini (with the screenplay by Pasolini and Brancati himself); Florestano Vancini’s La lunga notte del ’43 by Giorgio Bassani; Visconti’s reading of Tomasi di Lampedusa’s Il Gattopardo (1963); Luigi Comencini’s version of La ragazza di Bube (1963) by Carlo Cassola; Francesco Maselli’s rendition of Gli indiferrenti (1964) by Moravia; Valerio Zurlini’s Cronaca familiare (1962) by Vasco Pratolini; Carlo Lizzani’s La vita agra (1964) by Luciano Bianciardi; Giorgio Trentin’s Una questione privata (1966) by Beppe Fenoglio. Special attention deserves the work of director Damiano Damiani, who adapted several Italian novels during the 1960’s: L’isola di Arturo (1962) from Laura Morante’s success, La noia (1963) by Moravia, and Il giorno della civetta (1969) by Leonardo Sciascia. 22 19th century classics are represented by Edmondo De Amicis, source for Luigi Filippo D’Amico’s Amore e ginnastica, and Romano Scavolini’s Cuore, both from 1973, and by Alessandro Manzoni, cinematographed by Nelo Risi in his La colonna infame (1972). Almost no ancient classics were proposed on screen, with the exception of the politicized and free adaptation of Sophocles’ Antigone by Liliana Cavani in her I cannibali (1970). 23 Various examples can be found of directors who worked with foreign novels, tales and plays. To name just a few, Visconti shot a very successful version of Morte a Venezia (1971) by Thomas Mann; Carmelo Bene’s brief incursion in the world of cinema, ended with two English classics completely reworked, Wilde’s Salome (1972) and Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Un Amleto di meno (1973); in 1976,\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nradically changed again. Italian film productions became increasingly chaotic. The films of the 1980’s for the most part were either born out of small productions and directed by amateurs/novices with little or no distribution, or they were blockbusters tailored around famous comedians (Nuti, Benigni, Troisi, the Vanzinas’ “crew”, etc.). The use of literature in cinema was, apparently, less important than what it was to previous generations—something that could be ascribed to the cultural formation of the young screenplay writers and directors, who were evidently influenced by both television and cinema as much as they were by books, if not more so. Analogous to this is the so called crisis of the written word, in favor of the image (in all its manifestations, cinema included), which fostered a disaffection on the part of the writers towards adaptations, although several exceptions do exist. It is difficult to pinpoint trends due the scarcity and heterogeneity of adaptations of this time. Old and “new” classics were neglected, for the most part, with the gaudy exceptions of Salvatores’ first feature, Sogno di una notte d'estate, feebly based on Shakespeare, Silvio Soldini’s adaptation of Hemigway’s tale Paesaggio con figure, and Parise’s Il prete bello “translated” by Carlo Mazzacurati in his 1989 homonymous film. What emerges is a strong interest, on the part of the directors, in shooting the novels of their writer peers, or at least in the books published during their formative years. Among the best examples of this are Fratelli by Loredana Dordi, based on the novel by the same title by Carmelo Samonà, and Mery per sempre, Marco Risi’s screen version of Aurelio Grimaldi’s first book. It should be remarked that in these cases, writers participated actively in the creation of the screenplay. This tendency to simultaneousness, and a blurring between the writing and the filming phases continued into the 1990s and, to some extent, still goes on today. In spite of the fact that this last period began with two films that contained very personal (and fuzzy) rewritings of such universal masterpieces as Homer’s Odyssey (Piavoli’s Nostos, il ritorno) and De Laclos’ Dangerous Liaisons (Cristina Comencini’s I divertimenti della vita privata), the attention of directors and producers alike has been focused mainly on “recent” best sellers. Indeed, every literary Lattuada adapted Bulgakov’s novel Cuore di cane. Among adaptations of Italian works one should at least remember Profumo di donna (1974), Dino Risi’s cinematographic version of the novel Il buio el miele by Giovanni Arpino; Giuliano Montaldo’s L’Agnese va a Morire (1976) by Renata Viganò; Mario Monicelli’s Caro Michele (1976) from Natalia Ginzburg’s novel; the all-female production of Sofia Scandurra’s only film Io sono mia (1978), based on Dacia Maraini’s Donna in guerra, and the remarkable Rosi’s reading of Cristo si è fermato a Eboli (1979) by Carlo Levi.\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n15\n\n“phenomenon” of the last twenty years, on a cultural or simply profitmaking level, has been transposed into film. Over and above the results that obviously vary from case to case, this tendency bitterly speaks of a cinema that is overly concerned with commercial success: a film is thus produced when the book had already become successful and made a great profit.24 Although a few interesting adaptations of critically successful novels of Italy’s literary past, as well as more recent publications, have found appealing cinematic renditions (for instance, Tozzi’s Con gli occhi chiusi by Francesca Archibugi, Elena Ferrante’s Amore Molesto by Martone, and Pino Cacucci’s Puerto Escondido by Salvatores) and despite the presence of a few directors who consistently work with adaptations of Italian and foreign literary works,25 what seems to be leading the industry is the idea of the successful exploitation of “new” books, rather than that of resuscitating the canon. At the same time, the novel has unquestionably conquered the film industry, whereas plays are only occasionally transposed, and poetry almost never.26 This general trend seems to be confirmed by the great success of two films that came out last year, Antonello Grimaldi’s Caos Calmo, based on a novel by Sandro Veronesi, and the literary phenomenon of Gomorra, the socially engaged novel/essay by Roberto Saviano, adapted for the screen by Matteo 24 An account of the major films produced in this manner would include: Lara Cardella’s Volevo i pantaloni (1988, directed by Maurizio Ponzi in 1990), Susanna Tamaro’s Va’ dove ti porta il cuore (1994, directed by Cristina Comencini in 1996); Aldo Brizzi’s Jack Frusciante è uscito dal gruppo (1994, directed by Enza Negroni in 1996); Alessandro Baricco’s Novecento. Un monologo (1994, directed by Giuseppe Tornatore in 1998 with the title La leggenda del pianista sull’oceano); Niccolò Ammaniti’s Io non ho paura (2001, directed by Gabriele Salvatores’ in 2003), Melissa Panariello’s Cento colpi di spazzola (2003, directed by Luca Guadagnino in 2005 with the title Melissa P.); Margaret Mazzantini’s Non ti muovere (2001, directed by Sergio Castellitto in 2004) and Federico Moccia’s Tre metri sopra il cielo (2004, directed the same year by Luca Lucini). 25 Notably, Roberto Faenza who based six of his fourteen feature films on notorious books by Arthur Schnitzler, Dacia Maraini, Abrahm Yehoshua, Elena Ferrante, Federico De Roberto; Emidio Greco, who directed in the last 34 years only six films, four of which are adaptations of novels and tales by Adolfo Bioy Casares, Karen Blixen and Leonardo Sciascia. 26 Lately, though, there has been an interest in depicting poets’ lives, such as in Tullio Giordana’s Pasolini un delitto italiano and Placido’s Un viaggio chiamato amore, about Dino Campana and Sibilla Aleramo. A playwright, and later film director on his own, whose plays have often been adapted for the cinema is Umberto Marino (for instance, Italia-Germania 4-3, Volevamo essere gli U2 by Andrea Barzini, and La stazione by Sergio Rubini).\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nGarrone. Symptomatic of this is the fact that when Paolo Giordano’s La solitudine dei numeri primi won the Premio Strega in 2008, the author had already sold the rights to the film version of the novel. As was mentioned above, this book opens with four theoretical essays by Nicola Dusi, Antonio Costa, Raffaele Cavalluzzi, and Carlo Testa, which frame and systematize the relationship(s) between film and literature. Thereon, follow twenty case studies. Dusi approaches the relationship between literature and cinema from a semiotic point of view. He underlines that a text is never isolated but firmly inserted within a context (and thus contaminated by many other writings) and that studying a film taken from a text entails at least two choices: either relate the film to its “departing” universe of meanings (source oriented), or relate it to its “arrival” cultural system (targeted oriented). After a discussion about recent Italian trends of study (Eco’s idea of inter-media translation as a form of interpretation, Fabbri’s intersensitive approach, Calabrese’s concept of transposition, etc.), Dusi remarks that recent semiologists distinguish between a strict and a loose form of equivalence between texts. The latter is the one he is more interested in, because it allows one to consider multiple elements of the same text and conceives the translation, or transposition, as a “global” relation. The analysis of an adaptation as an inter-semiotic translation focuses on the comparison of narrative structures and of enunciative strategies, which enables one to consider the film as an aesthetic text. Precisely by pursuing aesthetics at the level of expression, Dusi claims, a cinematographic transposition constructs internal systems of resonance and signification that are analogous to the lyricism of the literary text. Costa analyzes the dynamics of exchange between literature and cinema across multiple parameters, showing how their interaction (and mutual interferences) were beneficial and multifaceted from the beginning. From an empirical point of view, the distance between the iconic nature of the image and the symbolic nature of the written word is shortened through different means (citations, subtitles, the presence of pages of a book etc, noticeable in the opening credits of recent films), as well as by the importance the various phases of writing have had on the understanding of the finished product. From a theoretical point of view, their distance has often been abridged by thinkers who considered cinema as ideogram writing, and by semiologists who analyzed the specificity of the cinematographic écriture and considered the film as a text. Inversely, 20th century literature testifies to such hybridization, acquiring from cinema both cinematographic themes and “modalities” of montage that are\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n17\n\nmimetic of it. These reciprocal borrowings produced inspirational and economical advantages for over a century and, as Costa suggests, any comparison between the two “sister arts” needs to be developed according to an inter-textual and an inter-medial discourse. Cavalluzzi’s article analyzes four different adaptation typologies that have been utilized over the last sixty years. Remarkably, he places the Italian situation in a dialogue with a broader, international context. In an investigation that goes from the simple “illustration of a text” (for instance in Soldati, and De Sica), to the radical “reinvention of the text” (as is often the case with Antonioni, Ferreri, and Pasolini) via different “reelaborations” (Visconti and Bellocchio), he reveals all these categories by giving solid and convincing examples, while at the same time illustrating an exhaustive corpus of Italian adaptations of the post-war era. Testa’s essay recounts the three stages of the separatism paradigm (Avant-Gardes, Futurists and Formalists, Jean Mitry and his subsequent North American followers) that began crippling the literature-cinema relationship at the end of the 19th century and continues to this day. Before the conventional date of 1895 though, as Testa recalls, imitatio had been a commonly accepted practice of dialogism between past and present, one that, for centuries, has produced fruitful inter-media and intra-media exchanges. Linking fidelity issues with the more recent “separatist” trend, Testa refers to it as a built-in ontological prejudice against any derivative work of art with respect to the original work. He thus advocates the substitution of the word “adaptation” with that of “re-creation,” not intended as “forgery” but rather as the intelligent reproduction of an equivalent function. Such re-creation needs to be thought out and practiced as a system continuously striving for the highest level of complexity. The twenty case-study essays that follow are grouped into four categories, arranged according to a conceptual rather than chronological order. The first category is based on films whose adaptations are explicitly “faithful” in various ways. Marco Arnaudo's essay discusses Ettore Scola's Passione D’amore (1981), an adaptation of Iginio Ugo Tarchetti’s Fosca (1869). In his essay, Arnaudo points out the three main strategies that allowed Scola to remain faithful to the “sense and the atmosphere” of the book as well as retain his personal themes and style. Firstly, the necessary changes owing to the different medium; secondly, the retention of two features (the thematic and the formal one) typical in his films, namely the gathering around a meal, and keeping history in the background of the characters’ story (as opposed its center), and finally, the elements that connect the specific identity of his film to Fosca. In doing so, the director created a “sister work” in which the\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nvampiric elements of Tarchetti’s book are translated into a realistic study of his characters, of the elements that, sublimated, become a metaphorical tomb of the Comedy “Italian-Style” and the birth of a new cinema for the director. Scola’s humanistic cinematographic approach holds some similarities with the one used by Archibugi. Daniela De Pau discusses how the director transformed Tozzi’s enigmatic writing—defined at the crossroads between Existentialism and Nouveau Roman—into a more realistic tale, using her usual intimist-realistic style. Archibugi, though, differs from Scola in her strategy because she inversely adapted Con gli occhi chiusi (1994) choosing to remain faithful to the plot and betray the spirit of the novel instead. By doing so, she ends up re-writing her own version of Pietro’s and Ghisola’s story, confirming herself as “narrator on the set.” The director introduced two main changes in order to present her visual narration. The first change was to reinterpret the story according to the teachings of Lorenzetti’s fresco, who wanted to illustrate how to serenely govern a city in his Allegoria del buon governo. The second change was to re-orient the spatial-temporal axes of the plot, in order to create a film with both a meta-historical setting and a linear story telling setting, where the reconstruction of events, denied in the book, could better follow the psychological explorations of the characters. Archibugi’s reinterpretation aims to take to the big screen a theorem of the spirit, together with Tozzi: living with the eyes closed results in having to face inevitable catastrophes. Another faithful adaptation, with an interesting spin, is the one by Cristina Comencini, who converted the story of her own best-selling book La bestia nel cuore, into a film of the same title (2005). It is discussed in Flavia Laviosa’s essay. Here Comencini’s adaptation process does not concern the betrayal of the plot, or the spirit of the original novel, but rather as she herself stated, the betrayal of herself. However, Comencini did introduce several structural changes in the plot in order to accomplish the transition between the different media. For instance, in the film version, she omitted the erudite Aeschylus’s frame and the more complex analysis of the father’s psychopathology, focusing instead on the human tragedy of sexual abuse as seen from the children’s perspective and who, as adults, have to find a way to live with such a heavy past. In short, Comencini was able to explore the theme of sexual abuse in two different ways: digging into the psychology in the book and exploring its memory with the film. The next essay by Manuela Gieri focuses on the Taviani's Kaos (1984), a film that faithfully takes Pirandello’s short story L’altro figlio as\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n19\n\ninspiration. While presenting it as only one of the four episodes within the film, the Taviani brothers used it as the thematic and stylistic guideline for the entire film. In fact, the main theme of the film, maternity, is also seen as a metaphor for Pirandello’s artistic creation of adapting the story from narrative to theater, which guided the Taviani in their process of translation into cinema as well. Starting with Pirandello’s challenging question on the nature of translation—whether it is possible to give to the same thought a different expression and soul—the Taviani brothers decide to confront such a question, and enlarge their views of the project, by infusing the filmic narration with a personal dialogue of Pirandello’s macrotext. Therefore, they included also the themes of traveling, fate, and the gaze—so fundamental for the Sicilian writer—and, in their “impossible” scope of translation, ended up trying to recuperate Pirandello’s thought in its entirety. The essay by Gaetana Marrone discusses how Primo Levi, the great memorialist of the Holocaust, inspired filmmaker Francesco Rosi to work on the scenario of La tregua in the early 1960s, though realized only in 1997. The critical debates over Rosi’s film attest to the director’s commitment to fashioning a cinematic equivalent of Levi’s novel: the true cost of a man’s soul becomes the most shattering measure of surviving in a world where the ideology of evil is the ultimate historical drama. La tregua raises many intriguing questions, which invite discussion such as how to recount events that defy language, and whether images are a stronger means of expression than words. The essay by Valerie Mirshak on Antonioni’s Le amiche (1955) functions as a transition between adaptations that intended to remain faithful to their original texts, and those that wanted to betray them, which is what the second collection of essays examine. Although Antonioni has declared that he adapted Pavese’s Tra donne sole (1949) without commitment to faithful adaptation, he chose two women, Alba De Céspedes and Suso Cecchi d’Amico, to pen the screenplay of the novel, because he thought they would be more sensitive in handling the story, and therefore more faithful to its female characters. With Cecchi d’Amico in charge of outlining the psychology of the characters, and De Céspedes handling their dialogues, the screenplay demonstrates that this sexual difference has had detectable and far-reaching consequences. By elaborating meaningful moments among these women, the female screenwriters converted a story about lonely characters, who suffered from a universal human malaise in solitude, into one in which these characters established tight bonds with each other, and lived out their specifically female experience with friendship and cooperation. When the story\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nreturned to male hands, Antonioni kept the emphasis on concrete and real experiences—which were derived from the personal experiences of the two female authors—and he was also guided by the two writers in the retelling of the story. He added elements that showed the contradiction and the struggle in the characters’ attempts (and ultimate failure) to maintain and preserve their close female bond. With such an approach, Antonioni, almost inadvertently, appears to remain faithful to all three writers, in his own particular way. Remaining with issues of gender, Gloria Monti’s essay examines Alba de Céspedes’ novel Nessuno torna indietro (1938), which challenges the standards and expectations of femininity during the ventennio period (1925-1945), a time when the boundaries of acceptable behavior for women were dictated by fascist ideology. She also examines the film version of the novel directed by Alessandro Blasetti, who also co-authored the screenplay with de Céspedes. If the collaboration between a notorious anti-fascist writer and one of the most prominent cinematic figures under fascism might appear contradictory, Monti reconciles de Céspedes’ and Blasetti’s political views by tracing the ideological transformation that Blasetti experienced throughout the ventennio, which led to his progressive distancing from fascism. The film was shot in 1942-1943, but its completion was delayed until the end of the fascist regime and the subsequent civil war in 1943. The film was not released until the end of the war, in 1945. By 1942, when filming started, Blasetti was no longer a member of the Fascist Party. However, scholarly works about Blasetti often dismiss his political development and simplistically categorize him as a fascist director. Instead, Monti proposes that the existing discrepancies between the literary voice of de Céspedes and the cinematic voice of Blasetti are motivated by the issue of gender rather than by that of politics. Stefania Benini’s essay introduces us to a director, Pietro Germi, who openly professed to the disregard of the text. While adapting Quer pasticciaccio brutto de via Merulana (1957) by Gadda, into the film Un maledetto imbroglio (1959), Germi laid claim to the total paternity of the story, and treated the book as a pretext for making the first Italian film in “detective story” genre. Despite his efforts to reduce Gadda’s name to a mere vague reference, Germi’s encounter with the Milanese writer was a very important one, which influenced him not only in this film, but also in subsequent films, in particular when dealing with a comic style with a resentful and grotesque gaze. In Germi’s polemical attitude to literature, there is an echo of the French Nouvelle Vague debates of the time, which demanded the status of author for the director, and thought that drawing\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n21\n\nfrom literature was a sign of decadence for cinema. In retrospect, the relationship between the book and the film testifies to two different styles of narration: Gadda’s, which is characterized by a linguistic deformation, and Germi’s, which is marked by the construction of an agile plot. It does, however, also testify to a similar indignant outlook on life. Therefore, the two artistic works do not collide, but inhabit their own orbits, each in harmony with its own style. A case of confirmed text betrayal is discussed by Riccardo Boglione in his essay on La cagna (1972), by Ferreri, based on Flaiano’s novel Melampus (1970). Here, the director completely overturned the original text, destroying all the significant and characteristic components of the source text. The story of the book is in itself interesting: in fact, Melampus originated from Flaiano’s Melampo (1967), a screenplay that was rejected by many producers and that never became a film. Consequently, it already embodies changes typical of the passage from cinema to literature (for example, the addition of cultural references that apparently upgrade a script to “higher art”). In Ferreri’s hands, the story is “degraded” and, for this reason, enriched with a corrosive tone. The director overturns Flaiano’s idea of a melancholic and disillusioned intellectual who still pretends to serve a critical function, into that of the absolute uselessness of the intellectual in participating in any collective change. As the two artists’ visions were incompatible—for Flaiano cinema was sacred (as was literature), and its entertaining quality was something mandatory; for Ferreri it was just a means to try to change people’s conscience—Ferreri attempts not only a reversal of the contents, but also formally works against the grain of the book. As a result, the film purposely flattens the captivating and rich registers of the novel, turning it into a cold and distancing cinematography. A case of an impossible adaptation is outlined in Simone Dubrovic’s essay about Visconti’s dream of filming Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu, of course, not in its entirety but around selected scenes and actions. The project failed and didn’t get beyond a screenplay. Despite this, Proust’s influence on Visconti’s cinema resonated well beyond this project, and is clearly noticeable in the film Gruppo di famiglia in un interno (1975), a film born out of Mario Praz's book Conversation Pieces (1971). The film closely follows Praz’s pictorial genre and content, with the presence of many of the paintings described in the book, and incorporates Praz’s method of portraying. However, this film also resonates with strong Proustian echoes, most notably in the fact that art is meant to compensate for the traumatic events and emotional emptiness in the life of the professor. The lack of metaphorical qualities in the film\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\n(which are considered indispensable for Proust in order to create art) in particular, and the insertion of a quotation from the Le coté de Guermantes about a tenant who represents the image of death, proves why cinema is regarded as abortive by Visconti, both with respect to Proust and to literature in general. Unlike the French author, who is able to find resurrection, cinema can only reveal death at work: in fact, for Visconti, the beginning of a film equals death. For the director, then, cinema ultimately means stealing images from reality, and collecting images that follow one another. By using Proust’s suggestions, the director points out why cinema cannot reproduce the mechanism of knowledge utilized by literature, and therefore why he could not adapt À la recherche du temps perdu. Federica Villa’s essay brings attention to the fact that the discussion of film adaptation cannot be restricted to a comparative approach between two works, but instead revolves around multiple factors. Vancini’s film La lunga notte del 43 (1960), adapted from Bassani's novel, exemplifies how problematic the question really is. The essay suggests that the relationship between cinema and literature can be analyzed according to three main strategies: the consideration of the specific historical context; the translation from one language into another (including everything that pertains to the quality of writing); the biographical recount of writer, of the screenwriters, and of the director. Seen in this relationship, Vancini’s adaptation is a film that inaugurates what will be Italian cinema in the sixties. In fact, thanks to the participation of Pasolini and De Concini in the screenplay, it transforms Bassani’s idea of Barilari’s responsibility for the immobility of his gaze into an historical immobility that incorporates the idea of temporariness and failure, typical of the new decade. The third group of case studies categorized as “strategies of translation” comprises essays that focus on adaptations whose main concern is to amplify certain parts of their sources, while remaining fundamentally faithful to them. Nevertheless, these adaptations by strategically shifting their attention to a particular matter, succeed in engaging in discourses that are personal, and independent from the literary material they “visualize.” Nicola Dusi’s essay on Zurlini’s adaptation of Il deserto dei Tartari, by Buzzati, perfectly underlines how the director, even while producing a film which is substantially more linear and realistic than its literary counterpart, imbues his work with visual elements that are an explicit attempt to recreate Buzzati’s famous “realismo magico” [magical realism] and mysterious atmosphere. Dusi’s analysis of two key scenes of the novel, compared one-on-one with their filmic equivalents, reveal that the use of the landscape, movements, colour and so on—via the\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n23\n\nsuggestions of the metaphysical paintings of De Chirico, Sironi, Morandi, etc.—works to keep Buzzati’s aesthetic of emptiness and uncertainty alive. At the same time, Zurlini’s ideological standpoint differs from Buzzati’s because, as Dusi suggests, in the film the protagonist’s inability to leave the fortress arises from social constraints, whereas, in the novel, a mysterious force ties the soldiers to their location, which is something that gives the book a metaphysical flavor that the film only moderately explores. Jacqueline Reich, in her essay about two films produced during the Fascist ventennio, reveals how adaptation could be used to slip in seditious messages about concepts (in this particular case concerning the “sanctity” of family and female submission) highly regarded by a regime aimed, among other things, at perpetrating those reactionary ideas. Reich examines the film Sono stato io by Raffaele Matarazzo, which is the cinematic version of Sarà stato Giovannino, a contemporary play by Paola Riccora, deeply rooted both in the Commedia dell’Arte and the Neapolitan comic traditions. Helped by a remarkable interpretation of Edoardo, Peppino, and Titina De Filippo, the film, while retaining a superficial adherence to the regime ideology, shows a representation of the family that contains elements that should be disturbing vis-à-vis gender roles and patriarchal ideas of the family as propagandized by fascism. Ferdinando, in Maria Poggioli’s La bisbetica domata, has a similar intent. It is an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, in which the female-empowering message of the Bard is retained (expressed through Kate’s intellectual freedom). The “contemporary” reading of the classic also allows Poggioli to depict traces of the war in course, something rather rare in the cinema of period, and to firmly separate the private sphere from the public sphere, the former (i.e. the intimate nucleus of family), historically being a place of resistance against the latter, the authoritarian public domain. Georgina Torello focuses her analysis on the filmic rendition of Verga’s Tigre reale by Giovanni Pastrone, as an example of the director’s cunning close reading of literary texts. Verga’s work is permeated with textual recurrences that give Pastrone two opportunities. Firstly, the chance to elaborate on the femme fatale leit-motiv, something that had already become a trademark of the director’s previous work. In addition, and far more importantly, the chance to make visual Verga’s most salient literary strategies for the depiction of gender relationships that permeate the novel (love, family, one’s own strength, etc.). The paper explores Pastrone’s decodification and transcodification from one language to the other, paying special attention to the director’s cinematic techniques,\n\n24\n\nIntroduction\n\nespecially subjective shots, and his intricate game of gazes (among and between the characters as well as the public). Piero Garofalo’s reading of I bambini ci guardano by De Sica, based on Cesare Giulio Viola’s Pricò, begins with a detailed genesis of both the novel, written in the mid-twenties, and the film, which started in 1942 and released in the fall of 1944. A reading of the evolution of the literary and filmic projects elucidates the different purposes and climates that generated the works, while underscoring the many affinities between the two outcomes. If De Sica and Zavattini projected the novel’s intimate tone onto the silver screen in a far more social and public light, the director retains many of the occurrences in the novel, and even its structure. The most significant change (i.e., Zavattini’s and De Sica’s reworking of Viola’s “crepuscularism” into an anti-bourgeois stand) is accompanied by audacious themes, practicable in literature, but rarely seen in films—more specifically the child’s oedipal attraction to the mother and the harsh treatment of infidelity. Ultimately, De Sica’s cinematographic vision respects Viola’s primary concerns, while translating Pricò’s private plight into a public crisis, though, as Garofalo suggests, such a filmic mediation does not allow De Sica to produce a direct denunciation of the status quo. Elena Benelli’s reading of the film that Faenza adapted from Tabucchi’s most successful novel, Sostiene Pereira, carefully traces the differences and similarities in the depiction of the central character of the story. In fact, in both instances, the construction of Pereira’s identity is the essence of the whole plot and is treated with equal importance. Nevertheless, while the voice of the storyteller changes in the novel from first person to third person, never really identifying itself—and so giving a rather destabilizing perspective to the reader who confronts multiple narrators—the film is keener to satisfy the viewer by clearly representing the narrator as an external entity. Faenza thus emphasizes the course of the events, and their political value, over and above the tone of mystery that saturates the book. The last group contains essays that focus on the blurred boundaries between books and films. Pasolini’s Teorema (1968) provides a great example of how fluid this relationship can be. Teorema originated as a theatrical piece and three years later it was simultaneously adapted into a novel as well as into a film, conceived according to a perfect amphibolic nature. Despite the differences between the literary and filmic genre, the main idea in Teorema remained unaltered in both works: the condemnation of the bourgeoisie, seen as a disease of the soul since it is regarded as being responsible for “cultural homologation”. To express such a concept, both the novel and the film challenge their own artistic\n\nWatching Pages, Reading Pictures\n\n25\n\nstatuses and try to escape the dominance of a particular semiotic system. Pasolini created a pastiche of styles; in the book, he uses the nouveau roman as an anti-narrative model and in the film, he uses painting and literature to challenge the filmic discourse. The irony is that Teorema wants to challenge modernism and realism, and yet in doing so, it operated as a quintessential modernist work in its effort to create a new language. Millicent Marcus’s essay on Romanzo criminale (2005) by Michele Placido and based on the eponymous novel by Giancarlo Cataldo (2002), shifts the focus of adaptation from one medium to another, in order to concentrate on Pasolini’s theories, and on the representation of the Roman sub-proletariat as the “common ancestor” of both works. Showing Cataldo’s literariness, or better still, his obsession with genre, Marcus pinpoints how the choice of a title, which reflects the aim of the book, privileges the genre (the novel) and, at the same time, embraces its literary history romanzo cavalleresco/romanzo criminale [the chivalry novel, the criminal novel], its hybridity, and its possibilities (polyphony, shifting register and incongruities). One of Cataldo’s more important destabilizing techniques is his “equivocal historicity,” the balance between the chronicle as the basis of this Roman “Banda della Magliana”’s narration, and the historical version of the novel itself. Placido’s film rewrites Cataldo’s ambient and combines, as an homage to Pasolini, his theory on the “cinema di poesia” [cinema of poetry] (made of “‘im-segni,’ the primal, pre-grammatical, hypnotic, irrational language of pure cinematic expressivity”) with the ingredients of the “cinema di prosa” [cinema of prose] “endowed with all the star power, narrative intrigue, hip visual glamour, and catchy sound-track”. Carlo Celli’s essay examines the time travel comedy Non ci resta che piangere (1985), by Massimo Troisi and Roberto Benigni, which does not derive from an adaptation. On the contrary, as is the case with films of a relatively high box-office achievement in the 1970s and 1980s, its success generated a “novelisation,” written by Anna Pavignano. A “novelisation” is a prose summary of the film, composed post facto, which can be a useful tool, as it provides an intermediary between the film, the film script (in this case unpublished) and the intentions of the authors. The film was neither based on any text nor adapted from an established play or novel. Instead, it was based on the comedy tricks of Troisi’s and Benigni’s theatrical experiences and success as comedians. This “novelisation” is, then, the antithesis of the improvisational impulses that produced the film. It is, at its essence, an anti-adaptation, which has lost the improvisational quality of the original, but has retained the themes of interest to the authors and the audience.\n\n26\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis section ends with another case for which the term adaptation is inadequate: Viva Paci’s consideration of Niccolo Ammaniti‘s book Io non ho paura (2001) and Gabriele Salvatores’ homonymous film (2003). Paci argues that both works are hybrid forms because of the presence of visual aspects in the literary text, and of the literary strategies in the visual text, which coexist in continual interaction, and demonstrate an interesting inter-media relationship. The idea of the novel stems from images, suited to the creation of a film. Later, Ammaniti, an eclectic writer, converted this idea into a book, and handled the screenplay as well. Precisely because of this idea of departure and return to the filmic, it is improper to employ the term adaptation to the film. The book preserves its genesis by including many codes of cinematographic language (camera movements, use of sounds, organization of time in sequence), while the film is suffused with literary strategies (various levels of enunciations, and the creation of a free, indirect style). Io non ho paura, as a film, surpasses the simple dichotomy between objective images and subjective images, employing the style of making the camera’s presence felt. These summaries are just a foretaste of the much richer, more meticulous, and far more detailed analyses contained in this collection of essays. While the definitive work on Italian cinema adaptations is yet to be written, the important contributions of the authors represented here should help to lay a sound foundation for such a work.\n\nWorks Cited Bonsaver, Guido, Martin McLaughlin and Franca Pellegrini, ed. 2007.

Semiotics of Texts, Semiotics of Cultures In contemporary semiotics, much debate revolves around translation. It appears to be a natural development of the constant focus on texts, whether examined singularly or in relation to one another. If semiotics is the study of signs, or rather, of systems of signification, then we can immediately declare that a sign is, first, a reference to something else, and that no system of signs or signification, and therefore no text, can ever stand on its own. In other words, as one can easily observe in the production of culture, all texts are supported by something else; they are produced, distributed, and absorbed, always circulating in a culture alongside other products and other texts that receive them, are associated with them, use them, cite them, and contaminate them. We agree with the anthropologist, James Clifford, who claims, “Pure products go crazy” (Clifford 1988). A mass of texts, or rather, a tangle of references in endless translation with one another. As Yuri Lotman would argue, translation constructs and, at the same time, dynamizes cultural universes. Studying texts, therefore, does not mean forgetting the contexts in which socially shared meanings are produced. There is no contradiction: it is a question of thinking, for example, of a film or a TV show drawn from literature not as a separate object, but as the point of arrival in the process. On the one hand, this process has strong connections with the sources, i.e. with the texts from which the cinematographic (or television) product draws its themes, images, structures, and methods of storytelling. On the other hand, what are set in motion are a negotiation and a comparison with the target culture, which is often radically different from the source text it receives and decodes. Thus, it is important to examine not only how the source text was adapted, but also the choices determined by the means utilized, as well as the choices linked to the logistics of production and\n\nNicola Dusi\n\n31\n\naudience captivation, which directly depend on the producers and the receivers in the target cultural system. This kind of translation always entails ties and limitations, but it also allows for new interpretative challenges. On exploring the way in which the key moments of a novel are illustrated, or how it develops into a film for cinema or television, the semioticians’ main issue is to try to account for the way in which text produces individual meaning. They will also have to examine the way it triggers the process of reciprocal translation that, in turn, opens up interpretative problems, and how all these interact with the addressee of the message.\n\n1.2. Translating, Adapting, Transposing We are especially concerned with a specific issue, the discussion of which requires a brief summary of the current debate among Italian semioticians. In his recent book, Dire quasi la stessa cosa [Saying Almost the Same Thing], Umberto Eco argues that every translation is, primarily, a form of interpretation. According to Eco, when the expressive substance of a text is transformed, as when making a novel into a film, it is incorrect to call it a “translation”—as if it were an English poem being translated into Italian. In fact, the source text has been manipulated to suit the demands of the target text, to suit its limitations or to suit its new expressive potential. Furthermore, a film makes it necessary to show the “things left unsaid,” i.e. to make audio-visually explicit what the literary text merely hints at either implicitly or even partially omitting it. One of the examples Eco uses comes from Alessandro Manzoni’s The Betrothed. In chapter 10, when telling the story of the nun of Monza, at a certain point Manzoni appears reticent: it is up to the reader to imagine how the nun falls into a state of perdition the moment she begins her affair with Egidio, because the narration remains suspended at the famous sentence: “La sventurata rispose” [The poor wretch answered]. It is the reader’s task to cooperate with the text, Eco explains, it is he or she who must give “voice” to that reticence, make hypotheses, and draw proper (or improper) conclusions from it. If this is allowed, or rather, is strategically constructed in writing, what happens in a cinematographic or television version of the written text? According to Eco, “la ‘risposta’ deve manifestarsi attraverso alcune azioni, sia pure suggerite da un gesto, da un sorriso, da un balenio negli occhi, da un tremore” [that “answer” must manifest itself through actions, whether they be suggested by a gesture, a smile, a gleam in the eye, a tremor] (Eco\n\n32\n\nTranslation, Adaptation, Transposition: A Semiotic Challenge\n\n2003, 329). Therefore, the director and the screenwriter must make certain choices and decide what to reveal and how to reveal it, open up the implications of the story told by means of a physically different media. A film “based on” will then be, in each of its manifestations (from the actors’ faces to their costumes, from the lighting on the set to the framing of each picture), a question of challenges and decisions, i.e. a series of interpretations at every level of the literary text. It is no longer, then, a mere “translation,” but more precisely an “adaptation,” argues Eco, because in moving away from the literary to its representation, “l’interpretazione è mediata dall’adattatore, e non lasciata alla mercè del destinatario” [the interpretation is mediated by the adapter, and is not left at the mercy of the addressee] (Eco 2003, 95).1 While in literary translation the translator’s point of view tends to remain hidden (except in footnotes), in adaptations, according to Eco, the critical perspective becomes predominant. Eco is certainly correct in insisting on the interpretative stage of every transposition, but it is possible to explore other aspects as well and, as some scholars have done, propose a reflection that still refers to the relationship between a novel and a film in terms of “translation.” In agreement with Lotman, Paolo Fabbri (Fabbri 2000) argues that each system of signs can be translated into another system of signs. For example, novelistic writing can be translated into a film for the television or cinema, and when instances of “untranslatability” occur, it is a question of changing the strategy, in order to allow every fundamental element of the source text to come through. A translation from a novel, Fabbri explains, is always an inter-sensitive process, and therefore one must take into account all the meanings of the work, in order to understand and appreciate the film. For example, an emotion (which constitutes a central problem in the relationship between literature and audio-visual fiction) can be translated by using music, color, soft or strong lighting, or a combination of these various languages. Mid-way between Eco and Fabbri is Omar Calabrese,2 who defines translation as a textual and “individual” phenomenon, always tied to the choices and goals of a single product. According to Calabrese, translating means not only interpreting, but most importantly, transferring the meaning of a text to another product, along with the inevitable transformations. This means regarding translation not as something closed and permanent, but rather as a process that operates on the style of the 1 2\n\nThe same example can be found in Eco 2001, 121—25. The title of the monograph is “La traduzione intersemiotica.”\n\nNicola Dusi\n\n33\n\ntarget text to reformulate some levels of equivalence or similarity with the source text. Such a process always takes into account the meaning effects (communication objectives) that the novel wanted to create in relation to those which the new text (film or other) intends to maintain, eliminate, transform, or reformulate. Accordingly, Calabrese suggests an “innovative” translation of the source text: a method of translating that searches for the unique traits in the original text; for example, in a novel, it will seek those characteristics that constitute its aesthetic and peculiar nature, its originality. A translation of this kind challenges the text from which it proceeds, it reopens it and wagers “che anche per il testo-target possa assumere non solo la dignità di quello, ma anche aggiungervi una sua propria ulterior singolarità.” [that even the target text can take on the dignity of the source text, and add to it its own uniqueness, as well] For this reason, Calabrese explains, amiamo certe traduzioni niente affatto corrette, ma infinitamente migliori di altre che si appiattiscono sul modello, ma non ne colgono minimamente la natura. È per questo che può accadere che la traduzione cinematografica di un’opera letteraria (poniamo il Nosferatu di Herzog tratto dal Dracula di Stoker) ci appassioni più di un’altra traduzione letteraria (Calabrese 2000, 118). we love certain translations that are not at all accurate, but infinitely better than others that slavishly follow the model but fail to grasp its essence. And for the same reason, the cinematographic translation of a literary work (ex. Werner Herzog’s Nosferatu, based on Bram Stoker’s Dracula) may enthrall us more than the literary translation.\n\nInstead of adaptation, then, we shall refer to it more properly as transposition. In the etymology of the word, the use of the prefix /tras/ (which is analogous to /trans/) entails both trespassing (as in “transgressing”) and “transferring” (as in “transfusing”), drawing attention to the act of going beyond the source text by passing through it or by multiplying its potential. Transposition, in the dictionary, is defined as “una modificazione della posizione di determinati elementi all’interno di un ordine preciso, precedentemente costituito” [a modification in the position of specific elements within a precise order that had been previously constituted] (Devoto-Oli, ad vocem). While the term adaptation brings to mind an inevitable form of reduction, speaking of transposition carries with it the idea of something that survives the passage from one text to the other, respecting differences and elements of continuity. However, in order to make this textual transformation successful, it is still necessary to keep\n\n34\n\nTranslation, Adaptation, Transposition: A Semiotic Challenge\n\nin mind its objectives, among which that of addressing a specific target culture.3\n\n1.3. The Spirit of the Novel or the Literal Meaning? A False Dilemma Most recent translation theories make a distinction between a “strict” (almost mathematical) equivalence and a “loose,” more flexible equivalence between texts. It is the latter we have in mind when we speak of the degree equivalence, where different degrees of equivalence are applied to the various translations. Semiotics proposes to think of texts as layered objects formed by mutually dependent levels: the textual layers one chooses to consider will determine whether it is worth discussing fidelity in the case of the transposition of a novel into a film, or not. Transposing means taking into account, for example, the main motifs and figures of the novel, the plot, the narrators who lead us or mislead us, and the literary forms by which all of the above is communicated. In short, it means considering the entire style of the source text. The challenge, then, becomes translating the style of the novel into film — if by “style” we mean the combination of the text’s expression and content form, logically “molded” by the enunciative strategies, as Christian Metz would argue (Metz 1995, 11510). Furthermore, when we speak of equivalence, we consider it not only in relation to the source text, but also as being always a dynamic, flexible and contractual equivalence, aimed at retracing the forms of communication that the novel had constructed for its readers, and rethinking them for its new addressee, the audience. In a translation or a transposition, a true communicative act takes place between the different cultures and semiotics. If a comparison or a conflictual relationship can be set in motion between the source novel and the target film, then it is the work of translators—from the screenwriter to the director—to adapt the said text to one’s own objectives, and at the\n\n3\n\nAnother terminological observation: Sometimes the expression “reduction for the stage” or more often for a film, is used in the sense of “adaptation” or “transposition.” They are, in fact, two different things: when we use the term reduction we accept a slightly negative connotation, which considers a film and a novel as unequal texts that cannot overlap, and that always require trimming, reducing, and cutting. The same is true for the term adaptation. In this case the prevailing notion is of a translation process that regards the source text according to rigid parameters and the target text as the result of a constriction (Dusi 2003).\n\nNicola Dusi\n\n35\n\nsame time, build a comparison of values, conventions, and norms dictated by the cultural systems to which the text belongs. A transposition (or “transmutation” according to Jakobson)4 clearly aims at emphasizing its implicit features. It suffices to think of the inevitable imposition of choices and semantic variations, of the connotative spheres that are culturally marked, and the unavoidable variations in discursive strategies. In analyzing a transposition, one is confronted with textual choices that gradually enhance the potential or the actual techniques of similarity, the strategies that privilege certain levels of relevance in the translational relation between the two texts. Indeed, translating an enunciation is not merely a question of seeking ways to transpose the “same” points of view of the story by means of focalization or “ocularization” (Jost, 1987, 77—78). Instead, it entails keeping in mind the global relation that connects the dynamics of expression to the enunciative and enunciational processes, pervading all levels of the text. In this sense we can refer to it as a textual strategy of transposition that can choose (or reject) equivalence or similarity in relation to the source text, a global enunciative strategy that activates the interpretative phase. A strategy that organizes the methods of syncretism of various languages in audio-visual semiotics is always a new interpretative choice: Which visual contrasts can be triggered or defused within the text? Which connections or fractures between the various languages can be actualized or virtualized? In fact, even on this level, a film already bears a communicative intention that can be identified through textual analysis, just as it does in other visual media.\n\n2. Aesthetic Text, Syncretic Text: Levels of Relevance in the Analysis A syncretic text, such as film, contains multiple languages, and a transposition entails changes in matter, substance, and form of the level of expression, in contrast to a literary text. Thus, it is important to remember that every film should always be considered as an aesthetic text, in which 4\n\n“These three kinds of translation are to be differently labeled: 1) Intralingual translation or rewording is an interpretation of verbal signs by means of other signs of the same language. 2) Interlingual translation or translation proper is an interpretation of verbal signs by means of some other language. 3) Intersemiotic translation or transmutation is an interpretation of verbal signs by means of signs of nonverbal sign systems” (Jakobson 1959, 261, emphasis mine).\n\n36\n\nTranslation, Adaptation, Transposition: A Semiotic Challenge\n\nthe level of expression and of content both determines the overall construction of its meaning. The translations-interpretations that the new text proposes, by staging them explicitly or constructing them implicitly, will therefore include all levels of the text. Therefore, when analyzing an adaptation, or rather, a transposition, firstly it is necessary to clarify which level of relevance to follow. One might choose to limit the analysis to a comparison of narrative structures and, along that line, retrace the elements in the film that have been deleted, added, expanded, or condensed. Alternately, one might wish to consider the series of enunciative strategies and the overall construction of the story. Such a construction can be regarded as a mediation towards the production of discourse (whether actorial, spatial, or temporal), activated by the enunciation inscribed in the texts. Thanks to this mediation, the themes and abstract values that make up the universe of meaning in the literary work are converted into concrete and recognizable values, themes, and icons, i.e. into discursive configurations that, in a literary or audiovisual text, are always presented through specific points of view. The target text is thus transformed according to the strategies and translation techniques one chooses to adopt, all the more so when translating from single-medium texts into syncretic texts, which are inevitably different from the source text, even in the construction of meaning effects. However, what I would like to emphasize is how the source text—novel, short story, even comic book, painting, or even another film (in the case of a remake)—occasionally offers interpretative paths that can become, as I have argued earlier, actual re-semantizations "
