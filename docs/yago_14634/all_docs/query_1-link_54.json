        "text": "Classic religious films can enrich faith during pandemic stay-at-home orders\n\nREGIONAL\n\nBy David Martin\n\nSPRINGFIELD — As everyone is staying at home during the COVID 19 pandemic ,where can people of faith, who feel they are missing an important part of their lives without attending daily or weekly Masses, find spiritual enlightenment and faith enrichment when viewing movies and television?\n\nCatholic New Service (CNS) movie reviewer John Mulderig has recommended several classic religious films.\n\n“Here are some films that were included in the Vatican’s list of the best religious films of the 20th century, released in conjunction with the Jubilee Year in 2000,” said Mulderig.\n\nThe films are listed in alphabetical order. All of these titles are available for purchase on Amazon.\n\n“Andre Rublev” is about a 15th century monk who is determined to paint icons and other religious art during civil disruption of the Tartar invasions in Russia. It is a Russian film with English subtitles from 1969 starring Anatoli Solonitzine as the title character. Catholic News Service stated in its capsule review of the film: “Director Andre Tarkovsky visualizes brilliantly the story of a devout man seeking to find the transcendent through his art.” The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is A-II, adults and adolescents. Not rated by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\n“Babette’s Feast” takes place in a rugged fishing village of Denmark in 1871 and “shows the impact of a French housekeeper (Stephane Audran) on two pious sisters who carry on their late father’s work as pastor of a dwindling religious flock.” The 1988 Danish film is subtitled. The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is A-II — adults and adolescents. The Motion Picture Association of America rating is G — general audiences, for parents wanting to view some films with their children who are not able to attend religious education classes.\n\n“Ben-Hur” is the Jewish prince of the title, portrayed by Charlton Heston, who suffers much misery when betrayed by his boyhood Roman friend. He later achieves retribution and salvation through Christ. The CNS review stated: “The narrative’s conventional melodrama is transformed by the grand scale of its spectacle, especially the chariot race, and by the stirring performances of its principals.” The 1959 classic Hollywood epic won 11 academy awards. CNS said the U. S. Catholic Conference classification is A-I general patronage. The Motion Picture Association of America rating is G — general audiences. Some DVD editions also include the 1925 silent version of the film.\n\n“The Flowers of St. Francis” tells the story about the beginnings of the Franciscan order. CNS stated: “Its founder sets the example of humility, simplicity and obedience for his followers at Portiuncula, a little chapel near Assisi. The subject of the narrative relates a series of little incidents realistically, yet with an infectious sense of joy marvelously conveyed by an anonymous cast of monks.” The 1950 Italian film is subtitled. The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is A-1 — general patronage. Not rated by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\n“The Gospel According to St. Matthew” is the evangelist’s account of the life of Jesus and his message of salvation. Catholic News Service stated the film’s “message of salvation succeeds exceptionally well in placing the viewer within the Gospel events.” The1966 Italian film is subtitled. The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is A-I –general patronage. Not rated by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\n“A Man for All Seasons” tells the story of the last seven years in the life of St. Thomas More, King Henry VIII’s chancellor and later the patron saint of courtroom law. More died a martyr rather than compromise his beliefs during a period of religious unrest. The CNS review stated: “The historical dramatization achieves an authentic human dimension that makes its 16th century events more accessible and its issues more universal. Profoundly entertaining but heavy going for children.” The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is A-I– general patronage. The Motion Picture Association of America rating is G — general audiences.\n\n“Monsieur Vincent” tells the story of St. Vincent de Paul who worked among the needy and oppressed in 17th-century France, where he founded an order devoted to charitable works. The CNS review stated: “Director Maurice Cloche portrays the poverty of the times and the cruelty of the regime in starkly convincing fashion, providing a solid historical framework.” The 1947 film ranks high on the list of great religious movies. The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is A-1 — general patronage. Not rated by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\n“The Passion of Joan of Arc” reenacts the heresy trial of the Maid of Orleans, who later became a saint. Catholic News Service said the 1928 silent film starring Maria Falconetti “still stands as the most convincing portrayal of spirituality on celluloid. The camera explores the inner struggle between human frailties and spiritual strength.” The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is A-I — adults and adolescents. Not rated by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nTwo other titles on the list include “Nazarin,” a 1958 Mexican film in which a youthful priest comes into conflict with his religious leaders, municipal authorities and the poor with whom he tries to live a life of poverty and goodwill. The other is “Therese,” a 1986 French dramatization of the life of St. Therese de Lisieux. Both of these films were given a classification by the U.S. Catholic Conference classification of A- III — adults, and not rated by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nMulderig had one strong recommendation for a classic religious television program.\n\n“If you are including TV, ‘Jesus of Nazareth’ from 1977 is probably the best visual media presentation of the life of Christ ever made, beating out all film takes on the subject,” he said.\n\nThe Franco Zeffirelli mini-series features Robert Powell as Jesus and a star-studded cast. It covers the Nativity to the Crucifixion and also the Resurrection.\n\nAnother film that Mulderig strongly recommends, “Of Gods and Men,” recreates the true story of a community of French Trappists living in Algeria during the civil war there in 1990. The CNS capsule review stated: “Director Xavier Beauvois finds a path to the heart of the Gospel through simplicity, a compassionate sense of brotherhood and an atmosphere of prayer enriched by sacred music and potent silence.” The 2011 French film is subtitled. The CNS classification is A-III — adults. The Motion Picture Association of America rating is PG-13 — parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.\n\nSome more modern films that Mulderig suggests include “Paul, the Apostle of Christ,” in which Paul is imprisoned in Rome during the last period of his life; there he is visited by longtime collaborator, St. Luke. Luke writes down the “Good News” that Paul had to share about the spiritual aspects of his life. These documents led to creating many books in the New Testament of the Bible.\n\nIn his 2018 review of the film for Catholic News Service, Muderig wrote: “Between them they account for at least 15 of the 27 books of the New Testament and Luke accompanied Paul on some of the journeys during which the Apostle to the Gentiles sowed the seeds of faith across the Roman Empire.” The CNS classification of “Paul, the Apostle of Christ” is A-II — adults and adolescents. The Motion Picture Association of America rates it PG-13 — parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.\n\nAnother recent film is “The Case for Christ,” which follows the true story of a Chicago journalist trying to disprove Christ’s Resurrection. He attempts to use the testimony of religious leaders and the iconic Shroud of Turin as evidence in his favor, but this only convinces him that the miracles of Jesus are genuine. The CNS classification of the 2017 film is A-II — adults and adolescents. Motion Picture Association of America rating is PG — parental guidance suggested; some material may not be suitable for children.\n\n“Heaven is for Real” depicts the story of a 4-year-old boy who has a near death experience during an operation in which he meets Christ and deceased relatives in the kingdom of heaven. This causes controversy in his hometown and the boy’s minister father begins to question his own faith. Mulderig said in his CNS review of the 2014 film: “Director and co-writer Randall Wallace’s adaptation of Todd Burpo’s best-selling account of his son Colton’s experience is substantial and moving thanks in large part to the mature way in which it grapples with fundamental issues of religious belief and doubt.”\n\nThe CNS classification of “Heaven is for Real” is A-I general patronage. The Motion Picture Association of America rating is PG — parental guidance suggested; some material may not be suitable for children."
