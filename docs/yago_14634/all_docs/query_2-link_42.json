Both films were photographed by Scotti whose photography was praised, while critics were less impressed with the rest. Moved to Rome, Bernardi started to act with acclaimed actors and directors at the famous Cines company, first in Il gorgo fascinatore (Mario Caserini 1919), playing an agressive lover who tries to rape Luisa (Bianca Stagno-Bellincioni) but accidentally dies.
