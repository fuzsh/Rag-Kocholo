Swindon Town have transfer-listed Alan Connell, Lee Cox, Mattia Lanzano and Jonathan Smith to make room for more summer signings.

The Robins have also announced that Lukas Magera has had his contract cancelled by mutual consent.

"They could all do a job if we were simply trying to stay in League One," Jeremy Wray told BBC Wiltshire., external

"Paolo has made it very clear our ambitions for this season are to win promotion again."

Wray continued: "He feels at this stage we need players who have already had Championship experience or players that are comfortable that could play at that level."
