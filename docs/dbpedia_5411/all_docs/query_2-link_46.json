Many special treatises have been written with the view of making it easy for the amateur to ascertain the authorship, quality, and value of a picture. But all these books of reference are, with- out a single exception, heavy and cumbrous, and as expensive as they are inconvenient. The present Handbook has been compiled from the best sources, with the endeavour to present, in a portable form, the requisite information dispersed through- out the above-mentioned works ; and to furnish, not only the fundamental knowledge which is absolutely necessary to the amateur, but also an exact classification of the masters of every school, with their special characteristics, and a more complete list of their copyists and imitators^ than is to be found even in the most voluminous dictionaries. In the present day, most people consider themselves con- noisseurs, and pictures have become current and accepted wares throughout the civilised world, as easily exchanged and realised as a bank-note ; yet there is, perhaps, no branch of human knowledge which has remained so much the exclusive possession of the few, and about which so many legends and false notions exist. On one hand, the idea prevails that genuine works of great VI Preface. masters are so rare that no ordinary individual can hope to come across a single obtainable specimen during his whole life. On the other hand, many enthusiastic novices are so simple as to believe that such works may be met with any day, or, indeed, that at least once a week they may be found in the rubbish of third-rate dealers' shops, and that for a few guineas genuine Teniers or Gerard Douws may be purchased. The former of these opinions is no less extreme than the latter. It is true that masterpieces are not commonly to be picked up in the streets ; but it is equally true that not a single year elapses without a certain number of the best pictures changing hands, and being olfered to any one who can pay for them. To account for this, we must remember that oil painting, however fleeting in appearance, is in reality one of the most durable productions which human genius has invented; that, consequently, a comparatively small proportion of masterpieces have disappeared in the course of the four or five centuries which separate us from the origin of the art ; that the works of each artist may be reckoned by hundreds ; and that, as the painters who have left reputable names behind them amount to eight or ten thousand, many of their works must still exist, change owners frequently, and consequently be to a certain extent accessible. Every well-educated man, then, should desire to be com- petent to judge, when opportunity may offer, of the artistic merit, and even the pecuniary value of a picture. Just as he would shrink from confessing his inability to pronounce upon the points of a horse, or the value of stocks, so, with greater reason, must he wish to be qualified to estimate the beautiful Preface. vii productions of art which past generations have bequeathed to us. The collecting of pictures has frequently been the chief recreation of eminent literary or political men ; and that this taste is developing more and more amongst the general public is proved by the high prices given for the works of both ancient and modern masters. It is with the view of promoting this noble taste still further, and of gratifying it more easily, that the present Handbook has been prepared. London ; September 1877.

Definition of Painting. Painting is the art of applying colours without relief upon a plane surface, so as to imitate any object in the manner in which it is seen, or may be conceived visible, in nature. In other words, painting may be said to be the art of expressing the conceptions of the soul by rneans of the realities of nature, represented upon a smooth surface in their forms and colours.* Although the domain of the painter is co-extensive with nature, there exists in his art a hierarchy founded upon the significance relative or absolute, local or universal, of his works. For example, according to the subjects they represent, pictures are divided into — allegory, architectural and perspective views, animals of all kinds, Bambocciate or drolleries, battle- pieces, candlelight pieces, caricatures, conversations, dead game, domestic subjects, fairs and festivals, flowers and fruits, history (Scriptural, fabulous, ancient or modern), hunting pieces, landscapes, marine views, markets, moonlight pieces, portraits, river scenes, still-life, whimsicalities and winter scenes. * Most of the following remarks are translated or abridged from the Gram maire des Arts du Dessin of M. Charles Blanc. 2 The Picture AmateuPs Handbook. Now can all these representations be placed in the same rank ? Nobody would venture to say so. The chain that unites all beings is composed of rings, rude at first and simple, which by degrees grow complicated, refined, developed, and in proportion as the chain ascends, become more richly wrought, more precious. It is not, then, a matter of indifference to represent inorganic bodies in their inertia, or to paint animate beings in motion. Neither is it a matter of indifference to take as a model the plant that vegetates, a captive upon the soil, — or the animal that moves, guided by the fatality of a still blind, but certain spirit, instinct ; much more man, who, the resume of all anterior creations, crowns them by intelligence and dominates them, because himself free. Moreover, if the greatness of the painter be measured by the difficulty of his work, what a difference between the copy of a shapeless stone or a plant, of which no one can verify the likeness, and the imitation of a proportioned and symmetrical body, eternally submissive to the laws of a divine rhythm, and yet one in which symmetry is constantly broken by movement or restored by equilibrium ! . . . If painting can elevate itself by the mere substitution of human figures for inanimate objects, what will it become when it selects its heroes, no longer from common life, but from the world of history or poetry ? — when, instead of representing local manners, it represents the manners of humanity and its heroic characteristics ? — when it replaces the changing costume of an epoch by that generalisation of clothing suitable to all times and all peoples, which is drapery ; — when, seeking beauty of form in its primitive essence, and approxi- mating to sculpture, it conceives and creates those immortal types that are gods I It is plain that there is a wide interval between N etscher and Raffaelle,— -between Chardin and Michael Angelo, To go over this interval as an observer is to explore the entire domain of art, and the different styles that it is per- mitted to embrace, as landscape, sea-views, animals, battles, the conversations and familiar scenes that, properly speaking, are %enre pictures, and finally, history, fable, poetry, and allegory. Definition of Painting. 3 The true distinction, the only one to establish, is the dif- ference between hnitatmi and style. Style, being typical truth, exists only for beings endowed with organic and animal life. The mind conceives the type of the horse or lion, because the organism of the horse and the lion follow a constant law ; but it is impossible to conceive the type of a rock or a cloud. Why? Because these bodies, not being living, are not or- ganised ; not being organised, they have no proportion. How then discover the normal form of that which is naturally with- out form ? How seize the fixed rule of that which is naturally irregular? How find a perfect proportion where there exist only variable dimensions ? When I see the head or leg of a horse, I can reconstruct the entire animal by virtue of the fixed relation of the parts to the whole ; but given the half of a stone, I cannot know the form of the other half, because no known principle has governed the aggregation of its molecules. It follows, therefore, that the value of a picture of still-life lies entirely in the perfect imitation. And the more the objects represented rise in importance, the more style will find a place in the representation. In a landscape., imitation plays a most important part, with- out being, however, so scrupulous, so literal, as it is in a picture of still-life. In a landscape the painter studies the reality of the model in each of the elements that compose it ; but he idealises the real by making it express some sentiment of the human soul. The proof that faithfulness of imitation would not alone suffice is, that if the instrument of the photographer could seize colours as it does forms, it would give us a certain view of a certain country, but it would not produce the work of art, which is a landscape painting. In order to achieve this, the painter, master of reality, enlightens it with his eyes, transfigures it according to his heart, and makes it utter, so to speak, what is not in it — sentiment and thought. Po7'traits are another example of the same law. Here, also, the truth of the imitation would seem to be a quality of the first order. But if it were sufficient, the best portrait painter would be 4 The Picture AmateuPs Handbook. the photographer ; and who does not know how deceitful is the truth, that pretends to be infallible, of the photographic image ? The painter endowed with mind can alone call forth the mind of his model, and that is the reason why portraiture is one of the highest branches of art. Only the greatest artists have ex- celled in it. Rembrandt throws over the commonest nature a mysterious glimmer that is in itself a poem, — a romance of light. Velasquez expresses so perfectly the shade of tempera- ment by the exquisite truth of local tone, that we discover with- out effort the unison between the visible form and the hidden spirit. Vandyck and Anthony More give to all their per- sonages the stamp of good breeding and the investiture of nobility. Rubens exalts life in the image of his model ; he seems to throw into it the circulation of the blood ; and when it is a child or a woman, he lavishes upon it freshness, youth, and sun. All Titian’s portraits are imposing. Their beauty attracts us ; at the same time their dignity keeps us at a distance. They are speaking, though silent. The old distinction between gemx and history, or rather be- tween familiar anecdotic painting and style, is then necessary, profound, and must be maintained. Individual truth suits the one ; the other demands a more general, a higher truth. A mountebank at a fair, a public fete, a game of chess, a familiar conversation, the comedies of the household, the little dramas of private life, demand only justness of observation and talent for imitation. All pretensions to style would be there unpleasing, out of place. Very different, on the other hand, is the work of the painter, when the person whose biography he relates is the human race in general. The form, gesture, expression, — -the external nature, and the landscape, all are under the control of his thought. ‘ It matters not,’ says Reynolds, ‘ if Alexander were short of stature, if Agesilaus were maimed, if St. Paul were mean in appearance : in the representation of these heroes the painter prefers the resemblance of the mind to that of the body. If by chance he has seen a boy hurling a sling, bite his lip, he Various Methods of Painting. 5 will not, like Bernini, give to the conqueror of Goliath that trivial and accidental expression, thus disobeying the higher laws of art/ In short, the greatest artist is not he who enters our house to put on our clothes, to conform to our habits, to speak to us an everyday idiom, and to give us a representation of ourselves ; — the greatest artist is he who guides us into the region of his own thought, into the fields of his own imagination, and who there, while showing us ideal forms and colours, makes us for a mo- ment believe, by force of the truth in his fictions, that these regions are those in which we have always lived, — that these forms and colours, created by his genius, are the forms and colours of nature herself. Various Methods of Painting. There are ten different methods of painting, viz. fresco, wax, distemper or tempera^ oil, pastel or coloured crayons, gouache and water-colour, enamel, miniature, glass and encaustic. Fresco Painting is so called because it is executed with water-colours upon a fresh ground. This ground, made of slacked lime and fine sand, is applied upon a first coating rough enough to make it adhere to it. The fresco requires a wall free from materials tinctured with saltpetre, and the colours must be such as the lime does not change. When the artist has polished and thoroughly smoothed the surface to be painted, he transfers his composition to it from previously prepared designs. These designs, of the size of the picture, are called cartoons {cartoni), because they are drawn upon large sheets of paper glued together. They are applied to the damp wall, upon which the drawing is traced with a point of ivory or wood ; or the contour of the drawing is pricked with a pin, and a tampon dipped in charcoal or red powder is passed along the line of the holes, so as to fix the design on the plaster. Afterwards, the artist follows the tracing with a sharp-pointed pencil or stylus, and this indelible contour is called the nail of 6 The Pictn^re Amateur's Handbook. the fresco. We find it in several Pompeian paintings executed upon a mortar of lime and sand ; and, as it could only have been done upon lime still damp, it is evident that these paint- ings are frescoes. The tracing made, the artist must set to work with a sure and prompt hand. As long as the plaster is fresh, * the carbonate of lime,' says Gruyer, ‘ takes up the colouring matter, envelops it, and forms upon its surface a crystallisation like a varnish, which protects the fresco from all external cause of destruction.' When the plaster becomes dry it can no longer fix and protect the colour. Hence the impos- sibility of retouching, and the special difficulty of the work. Wax Painting consists in the use of oil colours diluted, at the moment of putting on, with liquid wax mixed with essential oil. The advantage of this manner is that it preserves the painting from the alternation of shadows and bright spots which in oil painting are scarcely corrected by the varnish which generalises the gloss. The use of wax not only gives to the whole a soft and uniform aspect which allows the spectator to see the picture well, wherever he may be placed, but it also approaches fresco, although with less lightness and limpidness of tone. The greater number of our wall painters at the present time use wax, because they can retouch their work indefinitely, and can use more brilliant colours than those used in frescoes. Painting in Distemper, or Tempera, is probably the oldest of all methods. The colours are mixed in glue or size, either made of shreds of the skin, snout, and feet of goats, as described by Cennini, or ‘ with the yolk of egg diluted with vinegar and mixed with the sap of the fig-tree,’ according to Vasari. Richer than fresco, distemper permits the use of mineral colours. It is applied to walls after covering them with smooth, fine plaster. The painter uses bright, strong tints in anticipation of the fading they will undergo in drying. Be- fore oil painting was perfected by Van Eyck, and taught in Italy by Antonello da Messina, the Italian painters used distemper upon walls, wood, and canvas. It enabled Mantegna, Giovanni Various Methods of Painting, 7 Bellini, and Perugino to produce master-pieces as durable as frescoes. Mantegna’s ‘Triumph of Julius Caesar’ (now in the National Gallery) was thus painted, as was the magnificent picture of Bellini, the ‘ Virgin surrounded by Saints,’ formerly in the Church of San Giovanni e Paolo, at Venice. Not so liable to grow brown as oil painting, distemper has almost as much consistency with less heaviness. Memling used distemper with egg when he painted the famous shrine of St. Ursula, in the hospital at Bruges. Oil Painting. — When we look at certain pictures of Peru- gino, of the Vivarini, Giovanni Bellini, Mantegna, and those of the Florentines of the fifteenth century, Masaccio, Filippino Lippi, Angelico da Fiesole, we ask if oil painting be really a progress, and if we should prefer a method that changes the colours, tarnishes them, blackens them, and that seems con- demned to an eternal dimness, to the distempers that still are so fresh, so transparent, so pure. It is certainly most remark- able that the older pictures are, the better they are preserved. Antique paintings, says Lanzi, insult modern paintings by their preservation ; almost all the master-pieces in oil are threatened with destruction. If the pictures of Van Eyck, the reputed inventor of oil painting, are still brilliant with youth, and appear unchangeable, it is not because he mixed his colours with linseed oil, but in spite of this mixture, and above all because of the excellence of the varnish he combined with his oil, which has given his works the look of enamel. The Baron de Taubenheim wrote in the last century : ‘ The oily particles with which the picture is loaded, as they dry .... endeavour to escape from their cells by evaporation. Reach- ing the surface they encounter a pellicle formed by the parts already dry, or an impenetrable varnish that prevents the evaporation, and all these oily particles arrested in their deser- tion on the frontiers of the colour, form a mass of grease that gradually condenses, and embrowns the picture.’ Independent of the continual alteration of modern works, and without reckoning the changes that metallic colours like cinnabar 8 The Picture A mateiiPs Handbook, undergo in their combination with oil, painters know how tedious is the presence of the embuSy that is to say, of those dull parts that here and there make a spot in consequence of the unequal drying of the oils ; they know what a restraint upon their inspiration is the necessity of waiting weeks till the sketch is sufficiently dried to be resumed. They know they must pay dearly for the privilege inherent to the style of paint- ing they have learned, and which consists in allowing vigorous browns, profound shadows, more energy in the relief, and at the same time more mystery in the whole. ‘ Rub down the shadows, thicken the lights,’ is the precept taught in schools, which Rubens, Teniers, Vandyck have so well practised, but it is only a relative truth. To paint the shadows lightly with thin layers of colour diluted in oil is a good method if one works upon a canvas prepared with glue, very dry, and consequently very clear. If, on the contrary, it is prepared with oil, the shadows cannot be glazed, because the oil used in the prepara- tion will show through the glaze, and will make the shadows darker, since in glazing, oil will have been added to oil. In such a case, it is better to thicken the shadows in the sketch, which will hinder their blackening, by stifling the foundation which will disappear under the thickness of the paint. Veronese, who painted on canvas prepared in distemper, could glaze the shadows ; but any one who works upon canvas prepared with oil, will do well to cover over the shadows with colours thick enough to interrupt the communication of the foundation with the surface. It is always necessary to load the colours in the light portions more than in the shadows, because the clots, catching the sunbeams in their passage, add a natural to the artificial light. Pastel Painting. — This is a painting with pastes of differ- ent colours put on dry, and soft enough to be powdered under the finger. A colourist who wishes to catch fugitive tints, a painter who desires to get hold of a certain effect, uses pastel, because it demands no preparation, lends itself to im- provisation, and may be interrupted and resumed at pleasure. Various Methods of Painting. 9 But pastel is not merely an auxiliary means ; some excellent painters have made it a thing apart, and have used it success- fully in portraiture. Applied to paper glued upon canvas, the pastel produces soft opaque shadows ; it has not the depth of oil painting, neither has it the shining spots that reflect the light like a mirror. The freshness of colours, the brilliancy and tenderness of flesh-tints, the down of the skin, the velvety appearance of fruit, the soft texture of stuffs, cannot be better rendered than by these crayons of a thousand shades, that can be placed together in vivid contrast, or blended with the little finger, and whose heaped-up layers grasp the light. The pastel is suitable only for portrait, landscape, or still-life. But its grace is the source of its defect — it is friable and falls to dust. Enamel Painting. — Enamel is avitreous substance, coloured by metallic oxides, and is composed of two substances, — the colourless vitreous body, and the oxides that give it colour. The enamel is opaque or transparent ; to make it opaque a certain quantity of oxide of tin is added to the vitreous mass. By the action of fire, the enamel is fixed to the object it covers. It may be metallic,— as copper, gold, silver ; or non-metallic, — as porcelain, faience, lava. When applied to non-metallic bodies, the enamel is called varnish. Its most brilliant and valuable use is to decorate vases. The palette of the enamel painter, although deprived of cinnabar and vermilion, which are replaced by reds less vivid and of different values, is richer than the palette of the oil painter. ‘The colours,’ says Jollivet, ‘ are mixed with porphyrised glass, which does not affect their brilliancy, when they are exposed to fire ; the powdered glass liquefies, envelops the molecules of the colours, and fixes them. Gouache and Water-Colour. — In gouache painting, the colours are ground In water and diluted with gum-water mixed with white. Gouache is useful to store up souvenirs of a land- scape, to note the local colours of the ground, of rocks, sky, &c. It is particularly useful for stage decorations and the sketches of large compositions, has much freshness and trans- 10 The Picture Amateur's Handbook. parency, and does not exclude force of tone, is an expeditious and convenient kind of painting, because it only requires brushes, a loaded palette, and a glass of water ; but the colours dry so quickly it is difficult to blend them : hence landscapes in gouache have a dry, flat look, in which the skies seem cut up, the green crude, the yellows and reds hard. To prevent the too rapid drying of the water, artists have mixed with the gum some glutinous substance like sap of the fig-tree, jujube paste, the yolk of the egg ; thus gouache becomes distemper, of which it is a variety. In the hands of a skilful painter it is not with- out sweetness and harmony. The difference between gouache and water-colour proper, is that in gouache painting the artist may have a coloured background upon which he puts on the lights in successive layers, while in aquarelle (or water-colour painting), working upon a white ground, he reserves this white for the lights of the picture, and instead of putting on the colours in successive layers, he washes them. If tints diluted with gum-water want body and consistency, they are nevertheless light, cheerful, and transparent. Literally the aquai'elle is only a coloured drawing, but in our days the English school has given it a solidity that makes it almost a new kind of painting : its colours have body at the same time that its distances are melting and luminous ; it is at once limpid and robust, has much relief and much atmosphere. Miniature. — This word was also written mignature, be- cause it was supposed to come from the old word mignard., mignon. It is in truth a kind of painting that is always delicate, sometimes finicking. — Although one can paint in miniature in many ways, with egg, glue, oil, enamel, — yet it has been agreed to call a water-colour upon vellum or ivory a miniature. Nevertheless, the delicate paintings upon vellum or parchment, that so richly ornamented the Middle-age manuscripts, were rather gouaches, because soft colours were used, and the flesh- tints heightened with white ; while miniatures upon ivory are real water-colours, because the white of the background is preserved. Various Methods of Painting. 1 1 Painting upon Glass belongs rather to ornamentation than to the art of the painter. Encaustic Painting, — The word encaustic is applied to a kind of painting in which the colours, mixed with wax and resin, are softened, melted, and fixed by the aid of fire, and afterwards rendered lustrous by rubbing. Different passages from ancient authors, especially Vitruvius, Pliny, and Philo- stratus, prove that the most famous painters of Greece executed their works in encaustic. But their method of working is a secret half-lost. From the various methods employed, we select oil painting as the subject of the present treatise. It is the most widely known process, has been employed by the greatest artists, and has given us the many master-pieces which fill our Museums and Art Galleries. 12 The Picture A mateuPs Handbook. OIL PAINTING. I. Originals and Copies. The knowledge necessary for the amateur or connoisseur, of which we intend here to give the general principles, consists, first, in estimating the real value of the artistic merit possessed by the pictures submitted to him (and a natural taste will suffice for this, aided by the continued familiarity with traditional models which may be rapidly acquired) ; afterwards, and chiefly, in recognising to what epoch, to what country and to what master a picture belongs, whether it be genuine or not, — an original or a copy. Under the term original may be comprehended every work of imagination, or imitated directly from nature. To pronounce upon the originality of a picture, the con- noisseur requires all his clearness, all his experience, especially when the case in point is a doubtful one from the hand of an undoubtedly skilful artist. By copy^ we understand the reproduction of an original picture. Naturally, there can be but one kind of origifial. But amongst copies, many distinctions may be made. There are ‘ original copies ’ or ‘ replicas ' made by the painter himself of the original, who not unfrequently has reproduced it once, twice, or many times, when it has been favourably received by the public. Then come ‘ studies ’ made by the pupils under the direction of the master-hand. Then studies made for their instruction, or sometimes merely for pleasure, by rising masters of the first order. Such as, for example, Annibale Caracci.^ who has left studies after Correggio^ and Domenichmo after Annibale Caracci ; Rubens after Titian \\ Lorenzo di Credi after Originals and Copies. 13 Leonardo da Vinci \\ Andrea del Sarto after Pietro da Cosimo, &c. Amongst these excellent copies of the old masters, we must learn to distinguish between ancient and modam copies. Then, lastly, come copies, which are absolutely worthless, — contraband works with which the art market is flooded. It would evidently be very difficult to lay down precise rules for marking these distinctions. Experience alone can give that accuracy of eye which is not deceived on these points. However, one may say generally that originals are invariably known by boldness of pencil, vigour of touch, and elegance of outline. In copies, on the contrary, the lines are less free, and the principal objects or figures stand out in relief from the background. The reason of this difference is that the originator, as soon as his sketch was prepared, had drawn in the whole design, painted the backgrounds, and on these fundamental parts worked up the subject from life. A copyist, on the contrary, almost always works differently : he begins with the principal figures, leaving the other parts blank, or covered with a light layer, only attempting to touch up these when he has nearly finished the important groups. As this method is apt to alter the first outlines, he retouches them, passes over the margin, and the result of this second touch naturally shows itself in a sort of relief being added to the figures or objects of the first design. This visible proof, which was pointed out by a distinguished professional connoisseur, M. Lejeune, is not always sufficient to detect a copy, and as an example of the difficulties which are involved in this distinction, the story of Giiilio Rotnano is often cited, who took the portrait of Clement X., painted by Andrea del Sarto after Raffaelle.^ for the original, although he had hhnself worked at the d7'aperies of the real pictitre. But this must be looked upon as an exceptional instance, and the connoisseur could easily console himself for the purchase of a copy instead of an original, if that copy were the work of such masters as Andrea del Sarto or Giulio Romano. Unfortunately this is not t i ! 14 The Picture Amateur's Handbook. often the case, and copies are usually so badly executed as 0 y to deceive an unpractised eye. There is a distinction at all events, which can easily be m; e between old and modern pictures. The former have a shin g ivory-like appearance, a hardness of crust, and a number )f cracks more or less fine, according to the quality of the colo ’s that have been used, which distinguish them at first sight fr n the latter. As these marks are absolutely impossible to be i i- tated artificially, because a lapse of eighty years at least is i- dispensable for their production, so the most uninitiated m >t be singularly careless if he confounds a modern copy with n old original. Yet this is not an unfrequent mistake. It must be confessed that the tricks of the art-brokers e inexhaustible. The thirst for gain and the high prices reali: d by the great masterpieces have inspired these unscrupuL s manufacturers with the most ingenious methods of increas g the number of alleged chefs- oeuvres. One of the most comn n consists in having a copy carefully made of an original, by so e skilful hand, on an old canvas or panel. Another more delic e trick, which requires a still more practised hand, and whicl s also more difficult to detect, and has imposed upon milli< s of amateurs, is that which has received the French name )f fatinage,' and the Italian name of ‘ making quadri di fabric ' This trade consists in using old indifferent pictures wh h have a certain resemblance to those of some rare and vah 1 artist, and in having them so delicately retouched as to incre e the likeness still further. It is thus that Ruysdaels are m^ j from Isaac Koenes, Rubenses from Van Oosts or Diepenbet . A good example of the method is furnished by a Frer 1 author, M. Horsin Deon. ‘ Suppose a ClaiLde Lorraine is to ? manufactured : then a picture of Patel will be selected.

We may add that they can be bought for very little. . . Well ! a skilful landscape painter will make wonderful things of these pictures, and they will become in his hands wonderful imita- tions of Claude. He will give firmness to the skies by some brilliant touches, he will soften the hardness without removing either the dirt or the cracks ; he will tone down the horizon and give it a silvery tint, or else a golden one, as Claude was wont to do so successfully ; he will thus run over every part of the picture, giving here a touch and there a filling up, but always managing to make the clearest and most striking parts resemble the old painting. . . ’ The game is played, and it is only neces- sary to cover the picture with a solution of gum and bistre, in imitation of the old varnish, and to find a willing purchaser. How many collections are filled with such specimens ! II. Signatures and Monograms. As other given proofs of authenticity, which have, however, a very secondary value, we may notice signatures and mono- grams., which are often affixed to pictures. The uninitiated may consider the signature to be exceedingly important. The truth is, that it is of the very least value. Firstly, a great number of artists, amongst the greatest, have never or rarely signed their works. We may include in this category II Baroccio, Fra Bartolo7ueo di San-Ma7xo, Paris Bo7'do7ie, Caravaggio, Correggio, Dome7iichmo, Luca Giordano, Guido, Giulio Po7nano, Pah7ia Vecchio, Paolo Ve7V7tese, Leonardo da Vmci, Rube7is, Va7idyck, &c. Raffaelle and And7'ea del Sa7io have rarely signed theirs. Titia7i sometimes signed and some- times omitted to do so. The Dutch, Flemish, and German painters alone have rather constantly signed their works. But can it be said that all pictures bearing their signature or monogram therefore belong to them ? Alas ! things would be so only if a master’s signature were a very difficult thing to imitate, which is not the case. Tenie7's, for example, has i6 The PictiLre AmateiLv's Handbook. painted hundreds of pictures which usually bear his name in full ; but if all those which bear his name written in full were done by him, they would be numbered by millions rather than by hundreds. The monogram or signature can have no real value unless it is old — which is easily ascertained — and is at the sa^ne time coupled with the other general marks of 07'igmality . It may be asked — how can we know whether the signature is old or not ? In reply, it may be stated that in most instances a careful examination with a magnifying glass will suffice. If any doubt still exists, chemical tests may be employed. A signature of the same date as the painting will be incorporated in the substance itself and theirfore ineffaceable; whilst a little spirits of wine or turpentine will soon wash out a modern one. III. How an Oil Painting is made. Every smooth substance capable of imbibing on its surface a layer of oily liquid is fit for the process of oil painting. Those most used are wood, cardboard, paper, and canvas, es- pecially the last. The canvas most generally chosen is made of hemp, be- cause it is extremely firm, and can be highly stretched without fear of rending it. Linen, which would be superior in fineness of texture, possesses the disadvantage of relaxing through the various effects of temperature. Whatever kind of canvas be used, it must be made impermeable by the help of some pre- paration which will, however, absorb the oil superficially. The preservation of the picture depends much on this preparation. Formerly, chalk or plaster was used, diluted with gelatine or paste. Over the first layer of this compound a coating of boiling oil was poured. Now, the usual size is composed of yellow ochre mixed with oil, which is laid all over the upper side of the canvas. When this is done, the canvas is nailed to a mount made of very dry wood, so that it shall not' shrink, and cramps are in- Hozv an Oil Painting is made. 1 7 serted at the inside corners of the same, so that it may be en- larged until the canvas is thoroughly stretched. The whole is then placed on an easel, before which the painter can either stand or sit to work. With his crayon or his chalk in hand, he throws out the first sketch of his work. When he has drawn in the general design, he marks in the principal lines more definitely with a lead pencil. He arranges the limits of the principal masses and the most important details. Sometimes he indicates the shaded parts by a broad touch or by some hatching. Then he effaces with breadcrumbs the crayon or chalk lines, only leaving the pencil sketch half visible ; this he improves and completes in going over the lines again, broadening and rectifying as he proceeds. Some artists sketch the outline with a brush instead of a lead pencil. A second period now commences. This design is to be transformed into a finished sketch. What the painter has only indicated by lines will now be heightened by lights and shades, but omitting the gradations, which will be put in afterwards. It is generally agreed that strong effects should be put in, not by deepening the shadows, but by leaving the lights white, and covering the shadows with a brown wash. Perugino and Raffaelle did so. Rubens employed bitumen, which gave him extreme effects, but was often sadly injurious to the preservation of his pictures. Another way is to sketch in the lights. This is not very effective at the beginning ; but the good side of the system is that it will admit of putting deep layers of colour on the lights, while the shadows will only be lightly brushed over. This was the process of the great colourists, Titian, Paolo Veronese, Rembrandt. Up till this moment the picture has only its outline and chiaro-oscuro. Now the colours must be laid on. The artist rubs upon his palette the colours he intends to use, mixes them to obtain the tints required, and works them B 2 i8 The Picture Amateur's Handbook. upon the canvas with a brush. In his touch, i.e. in the manner with which he will lay on those tints, lies the very source of the various effects he will produce, the mystery of that life which he wishes to impress upon his work. Touch, of course, varies with each artist — according to his subject, or the feeling which inspires him — from the finest stippling to the broadest and grandest strokes. Then, when the painting is dry, all that remains to be done is to cover it with a protective varnish, as clear as the purest crystal, to surround it with a frame, which shall let it stand out alone, and light up its fainter tints with gilded reflections — and, finally, to submit it to public opinion. IV. Colours. The colours employed in art are dried mineral cr vegetable salts reduced to powder and mixed with a large or small quantity of liquid, sufficient to make a paste which may adhere to any surface to which it is applied. N.B, — The colours employed in manufactures differ from these in this particular : they are not colouring powders held in suspension in the liquids and covering the stuff dipped in them, — but soluble substances which colour the liquids them- selves. While the colours used in dyeing may combine, or react one on another, colours ground down are mixed in an entirely mechanical way. The primary colours are few, and the artist’s palette holds barely a dozen. But their tones and tints can be infinitely varied. A tint, properly so called, is produced by mixing two or more colours. A tone results from the mixture of a tint, with black or white. The greater the proportion of white in a tint, the lighter the shade ; and the greater amount of black, so the greater depth of shade. The chromatic circle recently come into use amongst colour Colours, 19 manufacturers, includes 72 tints, each graduating into 20 tones or shades,~being in ail 1440 different numbered colours. In reality there are only three original or primary colours : yellow, red, and hlu,e; and three composite or binary colours : orange, greeji, and violet. White light containing the three primary colours, each of these serves as the ‘ complement ’ of the two others, in order to form the ‘ equivalent ’ of white light. Each has therefore been called complementary in respect to the binary colour corresponding to it. Thus, Mm is the complementary of orange, because orange is composed of yellow and red, and with blue would make white light. For the same reason, yellow is the complementary of violet, and red the com- plementary of g7-een. In return, each of these mixed colours is the complementary of that primary colour which does not enter into its composition. Therefore orange is the comple- mentary of Hue. A remarkable property of colours, which it is very important to know, and which should always be remembered in using them in furniture or dress, as well as in painting, is that which regulates the well-known law of the ‘ simultaneous contrast of colours.’ It may be expressed thus : Complementary colours are mutually heighte?ied when placed in juxtaposition. Red, for example, put by the side of green, appears still redder ; orange deepens blue ; violet brightens yellow, &c. Another law, not less curious, is this, — an especially impor- tant one in painting : Every colour lightly reflects its complemen- tary on the space su7Tounding itself. For example, a red circle is surrounded with a light green aureola ; an orange circle with a blue, &c. This was observed by Veronese and Rubens long before the science of to-day had discovered the law, — when they carefully coloured with a violet tint the shadows of their yellows. As to the chemical composition of the colours used in painting, it varies much. Whites, for instance, are generally chalk or oxides of lead or zinc. Yellows are either clays, coloured naturally by the oxides of iron (ochres), as burnt 20 The Picture AmateuPs Handbook. sienna, &c., or metallic pigments, as massicot, made of lith- arge and ammonia. Turner’s yellow, made of litharge and chloride of sodium, &c. Reds are either clays strongly oxidised with iron, or oxides of lead, as minium, vermilion, cinnabar. Blues are either ferrocyanides of potassium, as Prussian blue, or vegetable dyes, as indigo. Nearly dSS. greens are extracts of copper. Blacks are produced by the calcination of vegetable and animal matter. Browns are oxidised clays or certain minerals submitted to the furnace. For oil painting, these colours must be first pulverised and then well mixed with an oil which will dry in the open air. Poppy oil is used for lighter shades, and linseed oil for dark tints. They are mixed by grinding them together with a hard> hemispheric pebble upon a long table of very smooth, close- grained stone. When the requisite consistence is obtained^ that being a rather thick syrup, the colour is put into leaden tubes, which require only a slight pressure to make it dis- charge upon the palette. V. The Anatomy of an Old Picture. The preceding explanations of the method of oil painting render the different parts of an old oil picture easily compre- hensible. Let us imagine the frequent case of an old picture which has remained fastened to a drawing-room wall for half-a-century or more. Let us take down the mount which supports the canvas in its tarnished frame, and begin its ‘ autopsy.’ First of all, then, on the face of this faded and discoloured picture, often almost black, we shall find layers of dirt, more or less thick, formed of the dust and smoke which damp has affixed to the varnish and almost incorporated with it. But this varnish will have saved the picture from injury, and if by any process we can remove at the same time the varnish and the dirt, the colours will reappear in their primitive freshness, as brilliant as the first day they were laid on. On Cleaning Pictures, 21 The colours themselves, hardened by time, cracked by variations of temperature, form a connected substance, a real crust of mineral colouring matter ‘ locked up ’ by organic cells of dried oil Under this crust will be the preparation of plaster or ochre which causes it to adhere to the canvas. Again, under the size will be the canvas itself, ill or well preserved, sometimes mouldering and covered with minute fungi, almost always damp, and consequently detached in places from the crust, or, on the contrary, pathologically adher- ing to the level of the cracks. This simple analysis is sufficient to explain the three kinds of operations which we are about to describe, viz. cleanings re-linings and restoring a picture. VI. On Cleaning Pictures. ‘ Nothing,^ remarks M. de Burtin, ‘ can be more useful to an amateur than to know how to clean his pictures himself ; nor can anything give him more lively enjoyment, than to see reviving under his hands a beautiful production of the art to which his operations give a second life. But from the ignorance of the means, and the difficulty of procuring instruction in it, through the pains taken by those who make a business of it to conceal the process or what they call their secrets, the greater number of amateurs are reduced to the necessity of placing themselves in the hands of others in this matter. Even amongst those who have been fortunate enough to learn some good method, there are a great many to whom the knowledge of it becomes unproductive, from their timidity, or from the ill-suc- cess of their first attempts through want of practice ; others again having, through misplaced confidence, made trials of injurious or dangerous processes, have become disgusted for ever by having spoiled their pictures. It is true, I admit, that without some practice, and a little prudence, the best methods are not without danger. But that need not frighten the amateur. 22 The Picture Amateur's Handbook, He will get practice by making his first attempts on some worthless picture. His interest, the delight of success, and the fear of injuring objects that he cherishes will do the rest so effectually, that his pictures will soon find, in his hands, a security not always to be found in those of mercenarj^ operators, where they miss the superintending eye of the master, and where they are treated all the more cleverly, because if anything is rubbed out, it can be cunningly concealed by a plaster, which a veil of varnish masks to the proprietor, until time discovers it by the blackening of the colours. Amateurs who are novices will do well to bear in mind these sound counsels, written, some sixty years ago, by the above- named illustrious connoisseur. The following hints are borrowed from the valuable translation of his treatise by Mr. Robert White. 1 The reader must be warned against supposing, as is too generally done, that one and the same means will answer for cleaning all pictures. Experience has shown that simple fret- ting with the fingers, spirits, alkalies, as well as common caustic, oil of turpentine, mastic varnish, oils, cold water, hot water, saliva, even the scraper, sand and ashes, must all be em- ployed in their turn, either separately or several of them com- bined, according to the difference of the case and the nature of the dirt which is to be removed. In order to make this clear by a practical application, it should be said that, amongst pictures to be cleaned, some have been varnished with mastic or other gums; some are covered with oil ; some with bad varnish ; some are coated with white of egg, size or water varnish ; some have never been varnished or oiled, and are only obscured by smoke and other dirt arising from the atmosphere ; finally, some are attacked by mould : — and accord- ing to the condition of the subject the treatment must be changed. I. When the picture is covered with mastic varnish. It is 1 Treatise on the Knowledge necessary for Amateurs of Pictures. By Fr. X. de Burtin, 1845. On Cleaning Pictures. 23 always easy to reduce this varnish to a powder by simple fretting with the dry finger. By this means every one may very easily remove it from his pictures, however little experience he may have, provided he take the precaution of frequently wiping off with a dry linen rag the powder which he creates by rubbing the varnish. The farther the work proceeds, the more he must take care not to rub needlessly the places from which the varnish has been taken off. A little practice will indicate the proper moment to stop. This method of removing the varnish dry is generally preferable for pictures on copper or panel, the surface of which is smooth. It is especially suited to pictures of small size and precious finish. But in all other cases it is necessary, in order to remove the mastic varnish, to employ spirituous liquids. Especially is it necessary when a picture has a rough surface, or when it is upon canvas, the interstices of which form so many little sunken places between the warp and the woof, to which the fingers are unable to penetrate, that the dirt and soiled varnish remain in them. Dry fretting is also too laborious to be used for large pictures, on account of their extent. ... In such cases, a mixture of good spirit of wine with oil of turpentine should be used, care being taken to allow the last to predominate in proportion as the picture is precious and delicate, or as the coat of varnish may be thin. The spirit of wine will on the contrar)^ be allowed to predominate according as the coat of varnish may be thicker and the pictures less delicate. Until practice teach the proper quantities, it will be more prudent to commence always with a mixture rather too weak in spirits than too strong. N.B.~Linseed oil may, without danger and often with advantage, be substituted for oil of turpentine, particularly when a picture is too dry, or it may be mixed with the same in equal proportion. In the mixture above mentioned of spirit of wine and oil of turpentine or linseed oil, dip either a piece of cotton wool, or fine old linen rag, rolled tip lightly, or a bit of fine sponge, B 3 24 The Picture Amateur' s Handbook. holding whichever is employed between the forefinger and the thumb, and pressing out a little of the mixture. A pencil, or even a small stiff brush, may be made use of, if the dirt, from being lodged in deep places, require it. Then the picture must be gently rubbed with small cir- cular movements, as if the operator were delineating so many small O’s, interlaced and retracing themselves ; and as soon as the varnish is dissolved on one small place, wipe it off quickly with a dry and soft linen rag, held in readiness in the left hand. Thus all the parts of the pictiure in succession are stripped of their varnish, and at the same time of their dirt, one after the other, care being always taken to allow the liquid to remain only the exact time necessary for doing this, and not to rub again the places from which the varnish has been already removed. N.B. — Raw cotton is liable to the objection of its sometimes leaving threads adhering to what little varnish may remain. So it is better to use it only for delicate pictures or when there are some sunken places. A strong brush ought never to be used but for rough pictures that have a thick layer of colour, and when used, it ought to be cleaned from time to time, to free it from the dirt and varnish with which it may become charged. When cotton, linen, or sponge are employed, they ought to be changed whenever they become saturated with varnish. If the sponges are cleaned with soda after the operation, they will serve for further occasions. Some persons use lavender-water and other compound spirits in place of the spirit of wine ; but there is no valuable reason for the practice. With regard to those who pretend to remove all kinds of varnish and dirt from pictures by rubbing them with blotting paper and oil of turpentine, the practice must decidedly be condemned, as much on account of its in- sufficiency as on account of the danger to the pictures. Should the mixture of spirit of wine and oil of turpentine fail to remove the dirt with the varnish, those who have suffi- cient experience to render it safe, mix with them, and success- fully, a quantity of potash proportioned to the requirements. On Cleaning Pictures, 25 But however useful, and even necessary it may be, such a practice is highly dangerous in unpractised hands. This leads to the remark that when a connoisseur cleans a picture, he stops with just discernment at the proper point, preferring to leave a little dirt upon it to rendering it cold and weak by too much cleaning. He knows that the golden tone produced by time gives to many pictures an enchanting elfect, and he takes every pains to prevent it from disappearing. 2. Whe?t the pictures a7'e covered with oil. Everybody knows that oils are divided into those that dry, which harden with time, and those that are fat, which never dry, nor become fixed, but continue to spread over any porous surface on which they are put. The latter are too injurious to pictures to admit of their being put upon them under any circumstances. The drying oils, on the other hand, particularly those expressed from linseed, walnuts, and poppies, are the basis of painting in solid colours. Although these oils are used to give body and consistency to the colours, of which they form one of the constituent parts, and although they are also of acknowledged utility in reviving the colours and preventing cracks and crevices in pictures which are threatened with ruin through dryness and age (provided that no more of them is used than is necessary to nourish the colours, and that it be wiped off, after having attained that object, with a piece of dry linen, or with bran, or crumb of bread), it is not the less true that the application of them without necessity to pictures that are already finished is in every case injurious. For if the picture be too new to have yet acquired its perfect hardness, the oil put upon it will incor- porate itself with it, and cause it to grow yellow, — a misfortune which, when confirmed by time, is of course beyond remedy. If, on the contrary, the picture has acquired by age its due degree of hardness, then the new oil, without incorporating itself with it, will form on the surface a crust v.'hich in time will become as hard as the picture itself, and will dim its trans- parency and freshness, and corrupt the effect of the local and proper colours by a yellow and monotonous general hue. 26 The Picture AmateuPs Handbook, However, this is the oil which is commonly employed as a varnish in Italy and in part of Germany, and sometimes har- dened by boiling with an admixture of white lead. In order to get rid of it, it will be sometimes found sufficient to cover the pictures, during the warmest days of summer, with a coat of linseed oil, frequently renewed during several days, in order to soften the underlying crust ; and then to remove both oils with spirit of wine. But when the oil so employed was fat, there is, perhaps, no remedy except trying to reduce it to the nature of soap by means of alkalies, and then cleaning away the soap with pure water. 3. When the pictures are covered with bad varnishes, viz. with varnishes made of spirit of wine. In these cases the use of spirit of wine rectified, and somewhat warm, will be neces- sary. 4. When pictures are covered with white of egg, isinglass, or water varnish. Water, especially warm water, is then the true solvent. 5. When pictures have never been varnished, and yet are soiled by smoke or dirt, saponaceous substances and alkalies take precedence of all remedies. They may all be employed with success. But as saponaceous matters are subject to the in- convenience of adhering too much to the picture, and the dry alkalies are so different in strength, the use of the caustic soap- maker’s ley is especially recommended. Pour the ley into a cup of rain water, drop by drop, until the matter becomes a little gummy. VII. On Re-lining Pictures. An operation which is often necessary for old pictures, and which is the subject of much public prejudice, is that of re- lining. One is apt to believe that it is a mysterious and difficult matter, which only few of the initiated understand. In point of fact, there is nothing simpler in its ways and means. A picture constitutes in itself a connected and solid crust, On Re-lim7ig Pictures. 27 which is not in the least (as commonly believed) incorporated with the canvas or panel on which it rests : it can, conse- quently, be easily detached in a single piece. Given an old picture, on a mouldering or torn canvas, or on a worm-eaten panel, one can separate the painting from this canvas or panel, and place it on a new and similar foundation, or it can be transferred from canvas to panel, or from panel to canvas. This is done daily. More frequently, however, the old canvas is only strength- ened by a new one. Here is the method of procedure. We will take a picture which only needs the canvas to be strengthened. Firstly, the painted side will be covered, for pro- tection, with a layer of strong and fluid paste, on which a sheet of paper is laid. Then, when the paste and paper are dry, the canvas is taken off the old mount to which it was nailed, and placed on a table, face downwards, the edges being held out by cramps or in some other way. All the roughnesses on the back are effaced with pumice-stone, then a new canvas (and in some cases a double canvas) is laid. Next a flat iron, lightly heated, is passed over the whole, to smooth it and dry the glue between the two canvases. The picture has now only to be turned over, the paper and paste taken from its face, and it can be nailed on its mount again, or, better, on a new mount. The operation is thus concluded. Now, let us take a picture of which the canvas is entirely de- stroyed and which must be taken off and transferred to a new one. After having coated the face with a thin glue made from hides, or from garlic and water, it is covered with a fine gauze. When this gauze is quite dry, it is also covered with several successive layers of paper carefully stretched and glued, so as to form a pasteboard. When this again is dry, the canvas is unnailed from its old mount and stretched face downwards on a very smooth table. These preliminaries being over, the more delicate operation begins of taking from the picture, which remains affixed to the cardboard, the old canvas at the back. This is begun by 28 The PictU7^e AmateuPs Handbook. damping it with water by means of a wet napkin, in order to dis- solve the preparation which causes it to adhere to the under surface of the painting ; and when it is sufficiently soaked, pro- bably in 30 to 50 minutes, the canvas is removed ; beginning in one corner and taking it with much precaution on the cross, little by little it is separated from the subjacent crust. When the whole is entirely removed, a fine gauze is applied to the painting, then a single or double cloth, an iron is passed over it, finally, the painting is again nailed on a fresh mount, and the cardboard and glue which protected it in front are taken off. The transfer of pictures from a panel is not more difficult. After the surface is protected with cardboard, and the picture is laid on the table, face downwards, the panel is attacked with plane and chisel. The wood is gradually shaved away until near the painting. Then every precaution must be used to leave the under surface of the picture entire, and moisture is em- ployed to take off the last particles of wood. Lastly, a new panel or a canvas is applied to the picture detached in this guise. It will be seen, therefore, that all these operations are very simple, and that the pretensions of professional re-liners to some mysterious art are perfectly unjustifiable. Every amateur endowed with a little patience and manual dexterity may manage to re-line his pictures himself, as well as clean them, if he cares to take the trouble. He must begin, of course, with pictures of little value before venturing to touch those of greater worth. In many cases it is far better to toil a little than to confide a picture to the unskilful and untrustworthy re- liners, with whom the streets of our great cities are full, and who will make you pay for spoiling without resource a good work. VIII. On ‘Restoring’ Pictures. With reference to the touches added to an old picture, to connect the portions destroyed or to cover any defect, we will say but a word or two, and that shall be to dissuade from any re- course to such an expedient, except in the greatest necessity; and The Schools of Painting. 29 then to counsel care in the selection of the operator, lest he should prove an executioner. How many pictures said to be ‘restored ’ are irretrievably injured ! Every serious amateur will do well to fix in his mind the following precepts : {a) Nothing is more difficult than to touch up a picture well. The most consummate knowledge of painting in general, and of the master in particular whose work is to be handled, will not be too much for the operation. {b) For this touching up to be well done, it must necessarily be well paid for. But it does not follow that, being highly paid for, it is of course well done. if) The best touching up is always apparent. A piece of fresh colour in the middle of an old coating is discovered at once by a practised eye. id) Touching up a picture lessens rather than increases its value. The inference therefore is : Never, under any pretext, have a really valuable picture touched up. Though cleajting may be useful to restore the brilliancy of an old painting — though re- lining is sometimes needful to save it from imminent destruc- tion—yet restoration so called, especially if practised by an indifferent hand, is almost always sacrilege. IX. The Schools of Painting. The word ‘ School ’ is used in painting in two different senses : — a restricted one, including the disciples or imitators of a master ; for example, ‘ the school of the Caracci,’ — ‘ the school of Rubens,’ — ‘ the school of Veronese ; ’ — the other, and wider, sense to include the succession of painters in any one country or one nation, as ‘ the English school,’ — ‘ the Flemish school.’ It is in the latter sense that we will use the word while throwing a rapid glance over the history of painting in the various countries. 30 The Picture Amateur's Hav.dhook. Although the ancients, especially the Assyrians, the Egyp' tians, the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, certainly pushed the art of painting very far, and possessed great masters, whose names even have in many cases come down to us, yet nothing remains of their pictures except a very small number of frag- ments of frescoes or decorative illuminations ; and even these vestiges belong to artists of a third rate of excellence, in a period of decay. Yet, these imperfect relics (as, for example, the fres- coes of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which belong to a period of which the great ancient art critics, Pliny and Vitruvius, un- mercifully condemned the productions) seemed sufficient for Sir Joshua Reynolds to form a very high idea of ancient painting. ‘ From the various ancient paintings,’ he says, ‘ which have come down to us, we may form a judgment, with tolerable accuracy, of the excellences and the defects of the arts among the ancients. There can be no doubt but that the same cor- rectness of design was required from the painter as for the sculptor ; and if what has happened in the case of sculpture had likewise happened in regard to their paintings, and we had the good fortune to possess what the ancients themselves esteemed their master-pieces, I have no doubt but we should find their figures as correctly drawn as the Laocoon, and pro- bably coloured like Titian.’ The frescoes and mosaics which have come down to us show beyond doubt that the ancients were thoroughly ac- quainted with the rules of perspective and foreshortening. But though facts of this kind are of the greatest interest to the archaeologist, yet to the amateur proper the history of painting will only begin with the revival of art after the darkest periods of the middle ages. He does not care about the pos- sible merits of the Romans or Greeks in that respect, he wishes to judge of the positive merit of pictures actually before him. Now, on the one hand, the ancients have left us no pictures, and, on the other, their traditions had been indeed partially preserved at Constantinople, which was during nearly the whole The Italian School. of the middle ages a sort of metropolis and fountain-head for the art of the world, but gradually that degenerate type fell down to the rank of simple illumination for the walls of churches and the margins of prayer-books. It is under this Byzantine form, characterised by the gold ground upon which the painters worked, and by the unchangeable rules of type and attitude, that art is uniformly met with among the European nations from the 5 th to the 12 th century of the Christian era. Then, suddenly, towards the end of the 13th century, a Renaissance took place, and the art of painting entered on a period of rapid progress. One of the most direct causes of this Renaissa?ice was probably the Latin conquest of Constan- tinople in 1206, and the more frequent intercourse between the Greeks and the Italians which resulted from it. We cannot doubt, notwithstanding, but that the decisive influence of men of genius had much to do with it. However this may be, we date from that period alone the History of Painting, the former ages being apparently ‘ pre-historic.’ That history is divided into seven great schools, — the Italian., Flemish., Dutch, Gemnan, Spanish, F7'ench, and British. Each school consists of several divisions : thus the Italian school, for an example, comprehends the Florentine, Umbrian, Roman, Venetian, Veronese, Paduan, Ferrarese, Bolognese, Parmesan, Cremonese, Milanese, Neapolitan, &c. But these distinctions are only important when these diverse artist groups, speaking the same tongue, have widely distinct charac- teristics. In other cases, it is better to keep to the general classification of painters by their nationalities, and simply to follow the descent of art through the successive generations of the same people. a. The Italian School. The Italian school originated at Florence. It was the most ancient of all, and the account of its origin is naturally very- obscure. Indeed, nothing is known of its first masters but the names and a few isolated specimens of their workmanship. 3^ The Picture Amateur s Handbook. There was Andrea Rico di Candia (died in 1105) ; Serafini da Modena (about 1150) ; the Bizzamanos who lived in Tuscany about 1190; Guido da Siena (about 1220); Margaritone d Arezzo (1236-1275). These painters adhered to the precepts of the Byzantine decorators who had been brought over at great expense by the Italian cities to ornament their churches. They painted on panels of oak or pine-tree, sometimes on a fine canvas glued to the panel ; they formed their grounds of a layer of gilt plaster upon which they afterwards painted their rude figures. Their colours were, as we mentioned before, mixed up with gluten or yolk of egg. The drawing of their figures was simple and incorrect, the flesh-colours were brown, the faces emaciated, the limbs lengthened out. With no idea of perspective or proportion, their works were like the first efforts of a child, more curious than beautiful. Still we may perceive in them a certain individual effort to free themselves from Byzantine routine. In 1260 appeai'ed the first picture of him whom one is ac- customed (since Vasari) to call the grandfather of modern painting, — Cimabue. Without considerable progress, we may yet notice better regulated proportions than in its predecessors. Then at last comes Giotto., his pupil (born 1276), who freed himself from the Byzantine style. Vet his drawing is still hard and Gothic ; he cares little for perspective and chiaro-oscuro ; but we may see in his works, for the first time, an effort at composition and expression, a harmony of proportion, a study of nature. His pupils were many, and spread the new style through Italy : Oreag?ia and Taddeo Gaddi being the most illustrious. While painting was thus making rapid strides in Tuscany, it began to develop also in Umbria, Romagna, Venice : the most eminent of the early masters of those parts being Pietiv Cavallhii. Gentile da Fabriano, who came later (1370-1450), shows considerable improvement on his predecessors. He came, besides, just at the time when the most important im- provements were about to be made in the art. The Italian School. 33 Pietro della Francesca (1397-1479) and Paolo Uccello were already giving their attention to perspective, and reducing it to fixed rules. Masolmo da Panicale (1383-1440), also a Floren- tine, was penetrating the mysteries of chiaro-oscuro. Masaccio (1402-1428?) was his pupil. He is the first truly modern painter, i.e. whose composi- tion is dramatic, whose forms and characters are personal, whose subjects are directly borrowed from nature. From his predecessors, he inherited perspective and chiaro-oscuro ; from the great sculptors, Ghiberti and Donatello, he learnt nobleness and elegance of outline ; from a conscientious study of nature, he gained that life which breathes in all his works. At 27 years old, he died, having merited the commendation which Sir Joshua Reynolds gives him : ‘He appears to be the first who discovered the path which leads to every excellence to which the art has arrived, and may therefore be considered as one of the great fathers of modern art/ Some contemporaries or immediate successors equally merited the eulogium, and contributed with him to establish the modern style ; they were especially : p7'a Angelico (1387-1455), Benozzo Gozzoli (died 1485), and Fra Filippo Lippi (1412- 1469) : the first, conspicuous for the deep religious sentiment of his works j the second for his colouring ; the third for his chiaro-oscuro. The last was one of the first Italian masters who worked in oil. The secret of the Van Eycks had been brought from Flanders about 1444 by Antonello da Messina ^ and after him his pupil Dome7iico Veneziano had employed it. Until now the subjects of pictures had been 7'ep7‘esentations rather than imitatmis. With the painters who have been styled QUATTRO-CENTiSTi, a period of the most perfect naturalism begins. Filippino Lippi (1460-1505) at Florence, Perugino (1/I46-1524) at Perugia and Rome, Francia (1450-1517) at Bologna, Mantegna (1430-15 ii) at Padua, the Bellinis at Venice, are the most dazzling names of the century. With the two generations of painters who follow, viz. with Leonardo da Vmci, Michael Angelo Buonarroti, Raffaelle, 34 Picture Amateur's Handbook. Sebastiano del Piomho^ Andrea del Sarto, we reach the highest development of art, characterised by all the excellencies of the preceding masters, in addition to incomparable dramatic powers, to the selection of the purest ideal forms, to the complete mastery of chiaro-oscuro. While the Florentine school produces these shining names, the Venetian school gives birth to Gior- gione and Titian, both the princes of colouring, and hardly had a day elapsed before Parma brought forth Correggio, who seems to have borrowed from both schools their several perfections, to exhibit on his canvas or on his frescoes all the grace of Grecian sculpture combined with the nobleness of Roman out- line, the most exquisite tints with the most wonderful light and shade. From that era art seems to have arrived at perfection, and after a short maturity it begins to enter on a long period of decay, extending into our own day. ‘ Decay ’ seems a hard word to apply to the immediate successors of the cinque- CENTiSTi : Tintoretto and Paolo Vero?iese at Venice ; the Caracci, Giddo, Alhano, Domenichino, Guercino at Bologna ; Bronzino at Florence \\ Baroccio at Rome : and yet it is the only true word, for instead of surpassing their masters, they have only distantly followed them, while borrowing their methods. Mannerism easily arises from imitation : this decay, so barely apparent at first as hardly to be noticed, becomes more marked as we recede from the great masters, and as the pupils copy only copyists. From the great historical pictures we fall into subject painting ; from eternal truth, into anecdote. The heirs of so much glory are, in the seventeenth century, at Rome, Sassofei'rato, Caido Maratti, Pannini; at Naples, Salvator Rosa, Luca Giordano, Solimena; at Bologna, Francesco Mola ; at Venice, Canaletti, Tiepolo. In the eighteenth century, Battofii, Gua^'di, Foschi. In the nineteenth there are none. b. The Flemish School. The Flemish school was no more than the Italian school the spontaneous growth of the dark middle ages. It is no doubt The Fleinish School, 35 connected in its origin with the artistic methods brought down from antiquity by the Byzantine painters. But at the same time it is especially characterised by its realistic tendency, i.e., it has drawn its inspirations much more from exact observation and imitation of nature than from the study of antique models or the pursuit of ideal beauty which marks the Italian school. The same character is shown in the German school, which we shall analyse afterwards : but the Flemish had the good fortune to bring to the service of their realism a profound knowledge of colouring, a softness of design, and at the same time a truth of expression which won for them one of the highest ranks in the hierarchy of art. What a school this was which began at Bruges with the brothers Van Eyck (1390-1450?) and continued with He77ime- linck and Mabuse down to Pourbus, Breughel^ and at last to Rubens, Vandyck, David Teniers! Whether the Van Eycks really invented the art of mixing colours with a siccative oil, as the legend has it, or whether they merely applied to painting a process used in the manufactures of the nth century, as the archaeologists say, it is no less true that they have an incontes- table right to be considered the founders of the Flemish school. Before them, their father and the other old masters of the Low Countries only worked their pictures on golden grounds, a method inherited from the Byzantines, and may be classed to- gether under the name of the ‘ Gothic school,’ open to all Europe. They were the first to submit their composition to the rules of aerial and linear perspective which divide the bar- baric art of the middle ages from modern art ; they were the first to show a vigorous colouring, a design charming in its simplicity, a grace full of nature and truth. These were the leaders, as Giotto had been before them in Italy \\ and in their most remote successors, we find their chief characteristics, carried to the maxi- mum of intensity and effect by the extension of professional methods and the example of the great Italian models. In the long fury of religious strifes, through sedition, revolt, pillage, civil and foreign wars ; in the midst of famine, pestilence, of all 36 The Picture Amateur's Handbook. the scourges which visited the Low Countries, the Flemish school pursued its way, retaining its unity and its tradition, and arriving by an almost uninterrupted succession of great artists to our own days. Bruges was the cradle of the Plemish school ; Antwerp and the noted Academy of St. Luke produced its most illustrious representatives. c. The Dutch School, The Dutch school, which resembles the preceding one in some respects, and has often been very wrongly confounded with it, differs in very distinct characteristics from it. Like it, it draws its inspirations from nature. To the help of a perfect and occasionally servile imitation of reality, the Dutch added a thorough knowledge of the laws of light and perspective, an in- comparable skill in chiaro-oscuro, and an extraordinary patience and minuteness of workmanship. But it seems that this mirror- like capacity lessened their artistic faculty. They fail in expres- sing passion in their faces, perhaps because Dutch living faces are not very expressive ; they readily fall from the true to the trivial, and from the trivial to the grotesque ; even when they wish to rise to higher conceptions than usual, they forget to give that dignity of outline, of attitude, or of costume to their figures which suits historical painting. In a word, they are everywhere and always homely. But yet no school has known so well how to express the poetry of vast humid plains, the mystery of the forest, the murmuring of the brook, the wild har- mony of the storm, or, on the contrary, the quiet fireside, the little dramas of domestic life, the splendour of rich furniture, the shaded tinting of bright copper. The Dutch are pre- eminently painters of incident.^ or life taken suddenly at some special moment, which is reproduced with scrupulous fidelity and often in an astonishingly happy manner. At the same time there is no school which presents more variety and contrasts, no school in which it is more difficult to trace the artistic lines of descent, and to discover from what master each painter pro- The Dutch School, 37 ceeds. There is rather a succession of great artists born on the same soil, than a so-called school, so much do the subjects, tendency, and manner of each differ. One point in common they have, with the nationality, and that is, as we mentioned above, their strong love of home life. The founder of the Dutch school was Lucas van Leyden (born 1494), who was the first to invent aerial perspective (for want of linear perspective, which he was unacquainted with), and contrived to represent depth and distance of objects by lighter tints. His contemporary Van School'd was the master of Anthony More^ after whom we arrive at the great era of the Dutch school (the seventeenth century), comprising such names as Cornells Poelemburg (1586-1660), the two brothers Both, then Wy?iants dead Re?nbrandt (1608-1669), the unrivalled master of light and shade. Then come Albert Cuyp, Tei'bwg, Adrian Bi'ouwer, Gerard Douw, Metzu, Wouwerman, Nicholas Berghem, Potter, Wit hem and Adrian Vandevelde, the two Mieris ; then ILobbetna, Jacob Ruysdael, Karel du Jardin, Melchior Llonde- koeter,Jan Steen, Vander Heyden, and Van LLuysum (1682-1749), whose immediate successors bring us down to the present epoch. d. The Gemna?i School, Every one will allow that Albert Dilrer, born at Nuremberg in 1471, was the real founder of the German School. He had, however, received lessons from Ma7'tin Schongauer (of Colmar), and from Michael Wohlge^nuth (of Nuremberg), and in 1505 he went to perfect himself in his art by a prolonged sojourn at Venice and Bologna. The German school might therefore be considered simply a branch of the school of the Netherlands grafted on an Italian stock. But it is certain that Diirer was the first to give it the deep seal of realism and that exact imita- tion of nature which has continued to be its chief characteristic. His contemporary Lucas Cranach (born 1472) united to similar qualities a grace and tenderness entirely absent from Diirer’s compositions, but lacked the correct drawing of that 38 The Picture Amateur'' s Handbook. artist. After them Hans Holbein (1494-1543) brought the special characteristics of the German school to their height. These consisted in strength of colour, exact flesh-tints, and a vivid reality of expression. Adam yElzheimer (1574-1620) and yohn Rottenhamer (1564-1604) also deserve an honourable place amongst the painters of their times. Both had numerous pupils and still more numerous imitators. But from the seventeenth century the German school lost its originality, and merged insensibly into the schools of the Netherlands, of which its representatives adopted the methods and characteristics as well as the teaching. Netscher and Lingelbach^ for example, are looked on as Dutch painters, though bom on German soil. e. The Spanish School. The Spanish school has been much neglected by historians of art, and its origin is involved in great obscurity. The first painter of the Iberian peninsula who diverged from the Gothic routine seems to have been Antonio del Rincon, born at Guada- laxara in 1446, who went to study his art in Italy, and then re- turned to practise it at Madrid. But the true founder of the Spanish school was a pupil of Michael Angelo Buonarroti, BeiTuguette, who lived forty years later than Rincon. His merit procured him the appointment of painter to the Emperor Charles V., and he was commissioned to carry out important works in the Palace of the Prado, in the Alhambra at Granada, and in a great many churches. Almost at the same time another Spaniard, Vicente yoanes, who had studied at Rome under the best disciples of Raflaelle, returned to his native country, and founded the school of Valencia. That of Madrid produced Morales, called ‘ El Divino,’ although he never painted any- thing but heads or busts of Christ, admirable in expression as they were. Lastly, at Seville, Luis de Vargas became the head of a new branch of the Spanish school, whence issued shortly Cespedes, called ‘ the Spanish Raflaelle,’ and Herrera the Elder The French School. 39 (1576--1656), the first Spanish master who was truly original. Until his days, the Spanish painters had all servilely followed the Italian school. But with him the right path had been found. Ribe?'-a^ Ziit'baran., showed that Spanish painters could think for themselves, and depict nature under new aspects. At last the peninsula produced those illustrious masters, of whom any school would be proud, Don Diego Velasquez (1599-1660), who united nobleness and dignity of form to the most conscientious adherence to nature, and the great magician, the great colourist of Seville, Esteban Murillo (1618-1682). f. The French School. The commencement of the French school of painting is generally dated from Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) or from Simon Vouet (1582-1633). Archaeologists trace it back to Jean Cousin (born 1530) at furthest. It is certain, however, that these painters, pupils of the Italians, only walked in the paths opened by the Florentine and Roman masters, and that before them Francois Clouet., called Janet (1500-1572), had inaugurated a species of art which was truly and conspicuously original. From the commencement of the 15th century, even, we find Jehan Fouquet (1415-1485), without waiting for the example of the Italians, at a time when Leonardo da Vinci and Pietro Perugino were not yet born, carrying the art of miniature painting further perhaps than it has ever been carried since ; still, it is certain that it is owing to the Renaissance and Italian influence that France for the first time possessed a true school, i.e. a succession of painters holding their own traditions. To Poussin succeeded Stella, Bourdon, Noel Coypel ; then came Eustache Lesueur, Le Brun, Claude Gelee, called Lor rain, Largilliere, Rigaud, Mignard, Santerre, Jouvenet ; then Wat- teau, Boucher, Latour, Chardin, Greuze, Fragonard; lastly, David, Prud'hon, G'ericault, Ary Scheffer, Ingres, Delaroche, Delacroix, Decamps. The French school on the whole has possessed but feebly c 40 The Picture A mateuTs Handbook. either religious feeling or an appreciation of nature. It has not been, therefore, poetical in the lyric sense of the word, if by poetry we understand an aspiration towards the invisible world and a striving after the infinite. But it has been an historical school in the highest degree, mixed up with earthly things and endeavouring to record with pencil and brush the ideas, manners, and events of the times in which it existed. g. The British School. Last in date, but not in merit, comes the British school. With us, as with other nations of Europe, the middle ages produced artists of every kind, architects, goldsmiths, sculptors, and painters, painters of church walls, portrait and heraldic painters, painters of miniatures for prayer-books and manu- scripts. But religious wars have destroyed so great a number of these precious monuments, that only a few fragments remain. Moreover, the traditions of British art were wholly interrupted by these civil strifes ; for many centuries, especially from Henry the Eighth’s reign, all works of art in this country were confided to foreign hands. The list of names is long and glorious, beginning with Holbein^ Anthony More^ Lucas de Heere^ and Zucchero, down to Rubens and Vandyck. The last-mentioned, by the long sojourn he made in our island, by the great change that his surrounding made in his talent, and chiefly by the influence which he had on the revival of art in Great Britain, must be almost considered an English painter, and deserves in every sense to be called the father of British painting. Around him was grouped a true school, including not only foreign names, but also several natives, as George yamesoney Michael Wright y his pupil, James Gandy and his son William, Henry Stoney called old Stone, and, lastly, William Dobson (1610-1646), the first in date of the English painters of eminence. Influenced in the same way, we may mention Robert Walker, who was a good portrait painter. The British School. 41 Then, owing perhaps to the unceasing partiality of Charles I. and his successors for foreigners, the British school under- went a second eclipse ; Sir Peter Lely., Sir Godfrey Kneller, An- tonio Vef'rio, and Louis Laguerre, being the most eminent who came over the channel and monopolised again all the orders of royalty or nobility. We must come down to the i8th century, and to Cradoek, VVoolton, Samuel Scott, yames Thornhill, Jonathan Richardson, Charles Jei'vas, Joseph Highmore, George Knapton, Thomas Hudsoii, Francis Hay man, before we meet with any painters of worth. Then we reach an epoch when the British school, throwing off its foreign bonds, asserts its independence — and that mainly by the appearance of the most thoroughly original of its mas- ters, William Hogarth (1697-1764), the son-in-law of Thorn- hill, yoshua Reynolds, the pupil of Hudson, Thomas Gains- borough, who studied under Hayman. Striking fact, — it is at the moment when the art of Europe everywhere entered on a period of decay, that British art began to blossom in all its beauty ! With Hogarth, the satirist and moralist, with Reynolds, the great portrait painter, so truly English, with Gainsborough, his rival, and the precursor of modern landscape, the genuine British school was founded. R. Wilson tried in vain to preserve the Italian style of land- scape. There stood yohn Crome who looked on nature with an English eye and knew so well how to express it ; there went Turner, peculiar and alone of his kind, not only in England, but in the whole world of art ; and Th. LMwre7ice, Constable, G. Romney, Bamy, Th. Phillips, David Wilkie, Patrick Nasmyth, W. Mulready, W. Etty, W. Collins, C. Stansfield, Leslie, Edwin Landseer, Bonington, Creswick, George Lance, to say nothing of the living masters. Some bequeathed to us pictures of noble, elegant, and aristocratic beauty ; others left us true and faithful representations of rural life and scenery ; others, looking on their immediate surroundings, have humorously recorded the manners of their countrymen. One and all, speaking the Eng- lish tongue with a national accent and colouring, have in less c i 42 The Picture Amateur's Handbook. than a century and a half, founded the most original, the most varied and, it may be, the most national school which we read of in the whole history of art. X. An Explanation of the Principal Terms used in Painting. Accessories. — The objects which a painter introduces into his work (independent of the principal figures), which are not absolutely necessary to the subject represented, and yet give to it relief, beauty, or energy. Aerial Perspective. — See Perspective. Anachronism, in painting, is the draping of ancient per- sonages in modern costume, as practised by some of the old Dutch and Italian masters, or vice versa. Also the introduction of modern buildings, ships, or inventions in ancient subjects and vice versd. Antique. — This term is applied to the paintings and sculp- tures which were made at that period when the arts were in their greatest perfection among the ancient Greeks and Romans. But it is generally used for statues, basso-relievos, medals, intaglios, or engraved stones. It has been doubted whether the finest works of antiquity have come down to us, but the principal of those which have been the guide of the most distinguished artists are the Apollo Belvedere, the Laocoon, the Antinous, the Torso, the Gladiator, the Venus of Medicis, the Venus of Milo. The Elgin Marbles in the British Museum form a treasury of knowledge of the antique school. A pro- found study of the antique was the source from which the greatest artists of modern times, as Michael Angelo and Raffaelle, drew the perfection which has immortalised their names. Aquarelle. — See Water-Colours. Attitude in painting is the posture or disposition of the limbs and members of a figure, by which we discover the action in which it is engaged and the very sentiment supposed to be in Terms used in Painting, 43 the mind of the person represented. It comprehends all the actions of the body : but whatever attitude be given to any figure, it must show the beautiful parts, as much as the subject will permit, let it be what it may. It must besides have such a turn as, without departing from probability, or from the charac- ter of the figure, may diffuse grace over the action. The choice of fine attitudes constitutes one of the greatest beauties of grouping. Background. — This term denotes the field or space round the groups in historical pictures, or that which is placed to set off a single figure ; and it is likewise applied to the places and buildings in the distances of landscapes. The invention of backgrounds is considered one of the most difficult as well as the most important parts of paintings. Bambocciate. — A term applied to homely and rustic sub- jects,—fairs, village feasts, &c. The name comes from the painter Peter de Laer, nicknamed, for his deformity, 11 Bam- boccio (the cripple). Beauty, Ideal.— This term is made use of to express that degree of perfection in a form, especially of the human figure, which does not actually exist in nature, but only in the creative fancy of the artist. ‘ It is this intellectual dignity,’ says Rey- nolds, ‘ that ennobles the painter’s art ; that lays a line between him and the mere mechanic ; and produces those great effects in an instant, which eloquence and poetry are scarcely able to attain.’ Boldness, in art, is directly opposed to timidity or laboured execution. Breadth. — This term, as applied to a picture, denotes grandeur of expression or distribution, as opposed to contrac- tion and meanness. Breadth is usually indicative of a master, as the want of it almost always accompanies the performance of an indifferent artist. When the lights in a picture are so arranged that they seem to be in masses, and the darks are massed to support them, so that the attention of the spectator is powerfully arrested, we have what is called bixadth of effect 44 The Picture Amateur s Handbook. or breadth of light and shade. Breadth conveys the idea of greatness. Correggio is perhaps the master in whose works breadth appears pre-eminently conspicuous. Carnations are the flesh-tints in a picture. Cartoon (from the Italian ca7'tone^ pasteboard). — Hence the word came to be applied to the drawings or coloured de- signs on paper, intended to be transferred to the walls in fresco painting, or wrought in tapestry. The most famous cartoons in the world are the celebrated cartoons of Raffaelle, designs for tapestry executed for Pope Leo X., whi :h were for many years admired at Hampton Court Palace, and are now in the South Kensington Museum. Chalky is that cold or unpleasant effect which arises from an injudicious combination of colours that do not agree well together. Thus, white mixed with vermilion, without being tempered with the ochres or burnt sienna, will appear crude and chalky. Charged is a term used by artists to signify anything that exceeds : such as exaggerating the outlines, in order to show a superior degree of skill, or to heighten the effect. De Piles advises artists to avoid chargings and says that the antique statues never have this pedantry or affectation ; that there is nothing of the kind in the works of those great masters who always imitated them, as Raffaelle, Annibale Caracci, Domeni- chino, Nicolas Poussin, and others. ‘Yet,’ he observes again, ‘ there are charged outlines that please, because they are above the lowliness of ordinary nature and carry with them an air of freedom, with an idea of great taste, which deceives most painters who call such excesses the grand manner. And although to such persons, who have a true idea of correctness, simplicity and elegance of nature, these excesses may seem superfluous, as they only adulterate the truth, yet one cannot forbear to commend some things that are overcharged in works, when the distance from whence they are to be viewed softens them to the eye ; or when they are used with such discretion as makes the character of truth more apparent.’ Terms used in Painting, 45 Chiaro-oscuro (Italian), light and shade. This term refers to the general distribution of lights and shadows in a picture, and their just degradation as they recede from the focus of ligh"
