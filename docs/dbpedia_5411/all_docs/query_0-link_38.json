        "text": "When I was studying professional entomology for my ACE, the terms Hemimetabolous for gradual metamorphosis and Holometabolous for “Complete” metamorphosis came into the equation. For years, I’ve placed insects that I know of: (Bed bugs, cockroaches, grasshoppers, etc) as hemimetabolous, even recently made a tiktok about it. I was wrong. Taking the deep entomology course with Hugo Ponce I’ve leaned the true clasificación. Hemimetabolous insects are those whose immature are not necessarily larvae, but don’t resemble fully the adults either. These immatures are called “naiads”, they live most of their life underwater until they become adults. True Hemimetabolous are in three orders: Odonàta, Ephemeróptera, and Plecóptera. Great examples are Mayflies, Dragonflies and Stoneflies, respectively. So, if cockroaches and bed bugs are not hemimetabolous, what are they? The correct term is Paurometabolous. Those classified in here resemble adult body plan in their nymph stage, and are called nymphs. In the image you can have a clear view of how this is actually classified. Chatgpt and Wikipedia will tell you cockroaches are hemimetabolous, yet again, another reason not to trust those.

This comes from not understanding labels, biology, Ecology or following simple maintenance rules. I believe that should change, but the way we teach them doesn’t really connect with the day to day operations. It takes patience fellas, but once you start measuring it, you will find the same result. Look at the market, analize and calculate. #pestcontrol #pestmanagement #cockroaches #kitchenmanagement #entomology #biology #newyork"
