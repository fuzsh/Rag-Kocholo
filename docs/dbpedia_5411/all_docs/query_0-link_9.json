        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis is the first investigation into PTSD prevalence in an outpatient mental health setting with a semi-structured diagnostic interview to have been conducted outside of the United States. We found that although current PTSD is highly prevalent among psychiatric outpatients (20.5%), particularly women (27.9%), it went almost completely undiagnosed (97.6%).\n\nThe prevalence of current PTSD in our sample (20.5%) was higher than that found in other studies using semi-structured diagnostic interviews: 14.4%11 and 11.2%,9 in the United States. Although one other study has investigated current PTSD prevalence among U.S. psychiatric outpatients using a semi-structured diagnostic interview, it is not comparable since it assessed a specific preselected subsample of African-American individuals.27 Other potentially relevant studies have reported only lifetime or 12-month prevalence figures.6,10\n\nIn addition to these studies, four others4,5,7,8 have examined current PTSD prevalence in psychiatric outpatients, although they used self-report screening instruments rather than a semi-structured diagnostic interview. In these studies, the prevalence ranged from 7% in Norway5 to 46% in Sweden.4 It is widely acknowledged that self-report screening instruments are considered less appropriate for establishing a PTSD diagnosis than semi-structured interviews, which are the gold standard method.\n\nThe fact that PTSD prevalence in a Brazilian mental health outpatient setting was higher than that found in U.S. studies could reflect the higher rates of criminal violence in Brazil. Violence is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in all parts of the world; however, the numbers are more alarming in low-and-middle income countries. In 2000, 90% of violence-related deaths in the world occurred in these countries.28 In Brazil, homicides accounted for 28.9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2015.14 Indeed, Luz et al.15 showed that the general Brazilian population is exposed to high levels of violence – 86% of her sample were exposed to at least one potentially traumatic event during their lives. Considering that interpersonal violence has higher conditional risks for PTSD than accidents or natural events,29 and given the current levels of violence in Brazil, it would be expected that the population has a higher risk of developing PTSD. Furthermore, the general unreliability of public services, including health care and police, fosters a sense of insecurity and impotence,30 which further increases the tragic consequences of traumatic exposure, including PTSD.\n\nDespite the high prevalence of PTSD in our sample, this disorder was grossly underdiagnosed (97.6% of the cases). To our knowledge, this is the first study using a semi-structured interview to have found such a low detection rate for PTSD in psychiatric outpatients. Two studies using self-report screening instruments yielded detection rates comparable to ours: Howgego et al.7 found that a PTSD diagnosis was found in the medical records of only one in 27 PTSD-positive patients (3.7%), while Mkize8 reported that none of the 18 PTSD-positive patients were diagnosed in their medical records.\n\nThere are several reasons for such poor rates of PTSD detection in mental health outpatient settings. First, PTSD is a “tricky” diagnosis. It is a highly pleomorphic disorder, and can be diagnosed in 79,794 different forms when applying the DSM-IV criteria; the changes in the DSM-5 resulted in an eightfold expansion to 636,120 combinations.31 Although some have argued that DSM-5 defines PTSD too broadly in comparison with DSM-IV,32 others have found the opposite33; the fact is that the exact impact of these modifications in PTSD prevalence has not been well-established.34 For instance, a large national U.S. study of adults compared six different PTSD prevalence periods (lifetime, last month, etc.) according to the DSM-5 and the DSM-IV, and the DSM-5 prevalence rates were somewhat lower than those based on DSM-IV criteria, statistically significant in only two cases.35 Therefore, we could not estimate the impact of using DSM-5 criteria in studies involving mental health settings.\n\nPTSD is also frequently comorbid with other mental disorders, such as major depression, anxiety disorders, somatic symptom disorder, substance abuse and sleep disorders,36,37 which can mask post-traumatic symptoms and lead to a missed diagnosis or a misdiagnosis.37,38 Second, reporting traumatic events frequently evokes intense feelings of shame, humiliation and guilt.39 These painful feelings are in great part responsible for the avoidance behavior seen in these patients – especially in interpersonal violence and sexual abuse victims.5 Further, patients may not understand the link between trauma exposure and their own symptoms, failing to report the traumatic event.40 Third, psychiatrists are not usually fully aware of the potential impact of traumatic events upon the mental health of their patients and may not actively investigate their occurrence during routine assessment.11,41 Furthermore, psychiatrists may be reluctant to actively assess exposure to traumatic events due to the stigma involved and to time constraints.41\n\nThe present study has some limitations. First, our setting was an outpatient mental health clinic of a psychiatric teaching hospital. It is a well-established fact that, due to the Berkson’s bias, the rates of psychopathology and comorbidity are higher in tertiary care samples than in community or epidemiologic samples.42 This bias occurs because people with multiple disorders and greater disorder severity are more likely to seek treatment than those with only one disorder. Second, it could be argued that since the physicians in our outpatient mental health clinic are psychiatrists in training they might still lack the diagnostic skills necessary for adequate recognition of difficult diagnoses such as PTSD, and, consequently, this may have contributed to the high rate of underdiagnosis. Nevertheless, two other similar studies from non-tertiary settings7,8 involving experienced psychiatrists also found high rates of PTSD under-recognition. The third limitation is the relatively low response rate; however, since patients with more severe trauma (e.g., sexual abuse, rape), as well as those with PTSD, usually avoid talking about their traumatic event, this population may tend to refuse to participate in research. Finally, since we did not conduct formal inter-rater reliability testing, the potential bias would be in the direction of even higher rates of PTSD prevalence and underdiagnosis.\n\nThere are important clinical implications for both the high prevalence and underdiagnosis PTSD in the mental health outpatient populations. The finding that psychiatrists may be frequently failing to detect PTSD is not restricted to mental health outpatient settings but also occurs in primary care,3,41 hospitalized patients,43 and other highly comorbid samples.44 The general difficulty in diagnosing PTSD indicates that there should be a more consistent and vigorous screening process in mental health settings. Direct questioning about traumatic events is essential to adequately assess PTSD symptoms and to develop effective treatment planning.44 Therefore, the need to address trauma-related issues should be stressed in psychiatry curricula and psychiatrist training. From a therapeutic perspective, if traumatic events and PTSD are not correctly recognized, then effective treatment modalities, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, may not be implemented.11 Improved detection of PTSD and timely adequate treatment can lead to improved outcomes for those suffering from this devastating disorder.\n\nAlthough PTSD is highly prevalent among mental health outpatients, it is astonishingly underdiagnosed. In order to identify PTSD, it is crucial to directly question mental health patients about exposure to traumatic events and their consequences. Incorrect PTSD diagnosis jeopardizes the implementation of an appropriate treatment plan, perpetuating patients suffering and disability."
