        "text": "When I was studying professional entomology for my ACE, the terms Hemimetabolous for gradual metamorphosis and Holometabolous for ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù metamorphosis came into the equation. For years, I‚Äôve placed insects that I know of: (Bed bugs, cockroaches, grasshoppers, etc) as hemimetabolous, even recently made a tiktok about it. I was wrong. Taking the deep entomology course with Hugo Ponce I‚Äôve leaned the true clasificaci√≥n. Hemimetabolous insects are those whose immature are not necessarily larvae, but don‚Äôt resemble fully the adults either. These immatures are called ‚Äúnaiads‚Äù, they live most of their life underwater until they become adults. True Hemimetabolous are in three orders: Odon√†ta, Ephemer√≥ptera, and Plec√≥ptera. Great examples are Mayflies, Dragonflies and Stoneflies, respectively. So, if cockroaches and bed bugs are not hemimetabolous, what are they? The correct term is Paurometabolous. Those classified in here resemble adult body plan in their nymph stage, and are called nymphs. In the image you can have a clear view of how this is actually classified. Chatgpt and Wikipedia will tell you cockroaches are hemimetabolous, yet again, another reason not to trust those.

The science comprises many subdisciplines including, among its more theoretical aspects, insect morphology, taxonomy, ecology, ethology, physiology and biochemistry. Agricultural, forest, medical and veterinary entomology (aimed at pest and disease control) and related branches (eg, environmental and pollination biology, quarantine services and forensics) are among its applied aspects. Ethnoentomology studies the role of insects in human culture. For something that has been overlooked for so long, it‚Äôs significance is still valid and should therefore be supported and invested in. #Entomologist #womeninscience #vectorcontrol\n\nAre bumblebees aggressive towards other species of bees? If so, what circumstances lead to such behaviour? Bumblebees can indeed display aggression towards other species of bees under certain circumstances. This behavior is most commonly observed when there is competition for limited resources, such as floral nectar and pollen. Here are some situations in which bumblebees may exhibit aggressive behavior towards other bee species: 1. Resource Competition; 2. Nest Defense Aggressive Mating Behavior: Male bumblebees (drones) may exhibit aggressive behavior when competing for the attention of a receptive female. This aggression can involve chasing away rival males. Aggressive foraging: Bumblebees may aggressively forage in a specific area, excluding other bee species from accessing the same flowers. This behavior is more likely to occur when resources are limited.If you need any kind of assistance regarding Entomology then you are just one click away. https://lnkd.in/deaey9CY\n\nüêû Exploring the Fascinating World of the Amblyopinus Beetle: An Ally of Rodents! üêÄ In the world of entomology, we often come across astonishing surprises that challenge our expectations. Today, I want to share with you an incredible example: the Amblyopinus beetle. These small staphylinids, at first glance, may seem like common insects, but they hold an amazing secret: they are closely related to rodents. What's even more intriguing is that they use rodents as a means of transportation. How is this possible? Amblyopinus beetles hop aboard rodents to move from one place to another, taking advantage of their movements to explore new environments. This link between insects and mammals adds an extra layer of complexity to our understanding of nature. Have you heard of Amblyopinus before? Do you have stories or information to share? üçÑ #Entomology #Amblyopinus #Staphylinidae #Coleoptera"
