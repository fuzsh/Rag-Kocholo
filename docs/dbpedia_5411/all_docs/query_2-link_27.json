        "text": "Overlapping hotspots in CDRs are critical sites for V region diversification.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Lirong; Chahwan, Richard; Wang, Shanzhi; Wang, Xiaohua; Pham, Phuong T; Goodman, Myron F; Bergman, Aviv; Scharff, Matthew D; MacCarthy, Thomas\n\n2015-02-17\n\nActivation-induced deaminase (AID) mediates the somatic hypermutation (SHM) of Ig variable (V) regions that is required for the affinity maturation of the antibody response. An intensive analysis of a published database of somatic hypermutations that arose in the IGHV3-23*01 human V region expressed in vivo by human memory B cells revealed that the focus of mutations in complementary determining region (CDR)1 and CDR2 coincided with a combination of overlapping AGCT hotspots, the absence of AID cold spots, and an abundance of polymerase eta hotspots. If the overlapping hotspots in the CDR1 or CDR2 did not undergo mutation, the frequency of mutations throughout the V region was reduced. To model this result, we examined the mutation of the human IGHV3-23*01 biochemically and in the endogenous heavy chain locus of Ramos B cells. Deep sequencing revealed that IGHV3-23*01 in Ramos cells accumulates AID-induced mutations primarily in the AGCT in CDR2, which was also the most frequent site of mutation in vivo. Replacing the overlapping hotspots in CDR1 and CDR2 with neutral or cold motifs resulted in a reduction in mutations within the modified motifs and, to some degree, throughout the V region. In addition, some of the overlapping hotspots in the CDRs were at sites in which replacement mutations could change the structure of the CDR loops. Our analysis suggests that the local sequence environment of the V region, and especially of the CDR1 and CDR2, is highly evolved to recruit mutations to key residues in the CDRs of the IgV region.\n\nDiffusive transport of several hundred keV electrons in the Earth's slot region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMa, Q.; Li, W.; Thorne, R. M.; Bortnik, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe investigate the gradual diffusion of energetic electrons from the inner edge of the outer radiation belt into the slot region. The Van Allen Probes observed slow inward diffusion and decay of 200-600 keV electrons following the intense geomagnetic storm that occurred on 17 March 2013. During the 10-day non-disturbed period following the storm, the peak of electron fluxes gradually moved from L 2.7 to L 2.4, and the flux levels decreased by a factor of 2-4 depending on the electron energy. We simulated the radial intrusion and decay of electrons using a 3-dimentional diffusion code, which reproduced the energy-dependent transport of electrons from 100 keV to 1 MeV in the slot region. At energies of 100-200 keV, the electrons experience fast transport across the slot region due to the dominance of radial diffusion; at energies of 200-600 keV, the electrons gradually diffuse and decay in the slot region due to the comparable radial diffusion rate and pitch angle scattering rate by plasmaspheric hiss; at energies of E > 700 keV, the electrons stopped diffusing near the inner edge of outer radiation belt due to the dominant pitch angle scattering loss. In addition to plasmaspheric hiss, magnetosonic waves and VLF waves can cause the loss of high pitch angle electrons, relaxing the sharp `top-hat' shaped pitch angle distributions created by plasmaspheric hiss. Our simulation indicates the importance of radial diffusion and pitch angle scattering in forming the diffusive intrusion of energetic electrons across the slot region.\n\nSex-related differences in the thanatomicrobiome in postmortem heart samples using bacterial gene regions V1-2 and V4.\n\nPubMed\n\nBell, Courtnee R; Wilkinson, Jeremy E; Robertson, Boakai K; Javan, Gulnaz T\n\n2018-05-10\n\nRecent studies have revealed distinct thanatomicrobiome (microbiome of death) signatures in human body sites after death. Thanatomicrobiome studies suggest that microbial succession after death may have the potential to reveal important postmortem biomarkers for the identification of time of death. We surveyed the postmortem microbiomes of cardiac tissues from ten corpses with varying times of death (6-58 h) using amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene' V1-2 and V4 hypervariable regions. The results demonstrated thatÂ ampliconsÂ had statistically significant (p <0.05) sex-dependent changes.Â Clostridium sp.,Â Pseudomonas sp., Pantoea sp., and Streptococcus sp.Â had the highest enrichment for both V1-2 and V4 regions. Interestingly, the results also show that V4 amplicons had higher abundance ofÂ Clostridium sp.Â andÂ Pseudomonas sp.Â in female hearts compared to males. Additionally,Â Streptococcus sp.Â was solely found in male heart samples. The distinction between sexes was further supported by Principle Coordinate Analysis, which revealed microbes in female hearts formed a distinctive cluster separate from male cadavers for both hypervariable regions. This study provides data that demonstrates that two hypervariable regions show discriminatory power for sex differences in postmortem heart samples. This article is protected by copyright.

P.; Meza, A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe effect of the thermospheric vertical neutral wind on vertical total electron content (vTEC) variations including longitudinal anomaly, remaining winter anomaly, mid-latitude summer night anomaly, and semiannual anomaly is studied at mid-latitude regions around zero magnetic declination at midnight during high solar activity. By using the principal component analysis (PCA) numerical technique, this work studies the spatial and temporal variations of the ionosphere at midnight over mid-latitude regions during 2000-2002. PCA is applied to a time series of global vTEC maps produced by the International Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Service. Four regions were studied in particular, each located at mid-latitude and approximately centered at zero magnetic declination, with two in the northern hemisphere and two in southern hemisphere, and all are located near and far from geomagnetic poles in each case. This technique provides an effective method to analyze the main ionospheric variabilities at mid-latitudes. PCA is also applied to the vTEC computed using the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 2012 model, to analyze the capability of this model to represent ionospheric variabilities at mid-latitude. Also, the Horizontal Wind Model 2007 (HWM07) is used to improve our climatology interpretation, by analyzing the relationship between vTEC and thermospheric wind, both quantitatively and qualitatively. At midnight, the behavior of mean vTEC values strongly responds to vertical wind variation, experiencing a decrease of about 10-15% with the action of the positive vertical component of the field-aligned neutral wind lasting for 2 h in all regions except for Oceania. Notable results include: a significant increase toward higher latitudes during summer in the South America and Asia regions, associated with the mid-latitude summer night anomaly, and an increase toward higher latitudes in winter in the North America and Oceania regions, highlighting the\n\nDiffusive Transport of Several Hundred keV Electrons in the Earth's Slot Region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMa, Q.; Li, W.; Thorne, R.

In this article we investigated further the mechanism of coaggregation between S. gordonii DL1 and Actinomyces oris T14V. Previous mutational analysis of S. gordonii suggested that SspB was necessary for coaggregation with A. oris T14V. We have confirmed this by showing that Lactococcus lactis surrogate host cells expressing SspB coaggregated with A. oris T14V and PK606 cells, while L. lactis cells expressing SspA did not. Coaggregation occurred independently of expression of A. oris type 1 (FimP) or type 2 (FimA) fimbriae. Polysaccharide was prepared from cells of A. oris T14V and found to contain 1,4-, 4,6- and 3,4-linked glucose, 1,4-linked mannose, and 2,4-linked galactose residues. When immobilized onto plastic wells this polysaccharide supported binding of L. lactis expressing SspB, but not binding of L. lactis expressing other AgI/II family proteins. Purified recombinant NAVP region of SspB, comprising amino acid (aa) residues 41-847, bound A. oris polysaccharide but the C-domain (932-1470 aa residues) did not. A site-directed deletion of 29 aa residues (Î691-718) close to the predicted binding cleft within the SspB V-region ablated binding of the NAVP region to polysaccharide. These results infer that the V-region head of SspB recognizes an actinomyces polysaccharide ligand, so further characterizing a lectin-like coaggregation mechanism occurring between two important primary colonizers.

The primary V-region repertoire is created by the rearrangement of immunoglobulin (Ig) V-region, D- and J-segments with the insertion of N- and P-sequences during early B cell differentiation. Recent studies revealed that secondary diversification of the IgV-region generated in the peripheral lymphoid organs plays a critical role in the generation of effective Ab production for protection from various pathogens. NaÃ¯ve B cells that react with Ags initiate proliferation and differentiation in the follicular region and create the germinal centres (GCs), where activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent IgV-region somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination generate high-affinity and class-switched mature Ag-specific B cells. Our studies have discovered a 210-kDa nuclear protein, named GC-associated nuclear protein (GANP) that is up-regulated in GC B cells during the T cell-dependent (TD) immune responses. By studying mice with mutant forms of the ganp gene, we demonstrated that GANP is essential for the generation of high-affinity B cells against TD-Ag by affecting SHM at the IgV-regions. GANP is associated with AID in the cytoplasm and the GANP/AID complex is recruited to the nucleus, specifically, the chromatin, and targeted selectively to the IgV-region gene in B cells. GANP augments the access of AID towards IgV-regions in B cells. Here, we review the role of GANP in acquired immunity through the detailed analysis of the molecular mechanism generating SHM specifically at IgV-regions in B cells. Â© 2011 The Authors.

Here we explore the patterns of HIV-1 Env gp120 glycosylation, and particularly the enrichment in glycosylation sites proximal to the disulfide linkages at the base of the surface-exposed variable domains. To dissect the influence of glycans on the conformation these regions, we focused on an antigenic peptide fragment from a disulfide bridge-bounded region spanning the V1 and V2 hyper-variable domains of HIV-1 gp120. We used replica exchangemoreÂ Â» molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate how glycosylation influences its conformation and stability. Simulations were performed with and without N-linked glycosylation at two sites that are highly conserved across HIV-1 isolates (N156 and N160); both are contacts for recognition by V1V2-targeted broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. Glycosylation stabilized the pre-existing conformations of this peptide construct, reduced its propensity to adopt other secondary structures, and provided resistance against thermal unfolding. Simulations performed in the context of the Env trimer also indicated that glycosylation reduces flexibility of the V1V2 region, and provided insight into glycan-glycan interactions in this region. These stabilizing effects were influenced by a combination of factors, including the presence of a disulfide bond between the Cysteines at 131 and 157, which increased the formation of beta-strands. Together, these results provide a mechanism for conservation of disulfide linkage proximal glycosylation adjacent to the variable domains of gp120 and begin to explain how this could be exploited to enhance the immunogenicity of those regions. Furthermore, these studies suggest that glycopeptide immunogens can be designed to stabilize the most relevant Env conformations to\n\nEffect of glycosylation on an immunodominant region in the V1V2 variable domain of the HIV-1 envelope gp120 protein\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTian, Jianhui; Lopez, Cesar Augusto; Derdeyn, Cynthia A.\n\nHeavy glycosylation of the envelope (Env) surface subunit, gp120, is a key adaptation of HIV-1; however, the precise effects of glycosylation on the folding, conformation and dynamics of this protein are poorly understood.

A tissue-dependent role for collagen V in determining mechanical function was recently established, but its role in determining regional properties has not been addressed. The objective of this study was to define the role(s) of collagen V expression in establishing the site-specific properties of the supraspinatus tendon. The insertion and midsubstance of tendons from wild type, heterozygous and tendon/ligament-specific null mice were assessed for crimp morphology, fibril morphology, cell morphology, as well as total collagen and pyridinoline cross-link (PYD) content. Fibril morphology was altered at the midsubstance of both groups with larger, but fewer, fibrils and no change in cell morphology or collagen compared to the wild type controls. In contrast, a significant disruption of fibril assembly was observed at the insertion site of the null group with the presence of structurally aberrant fibrils. Alterations were also present in cell density and PYD content. Altogether, these results demonstrate that collagen V plays a crucial role in determining region-specific differences in mouse supraspinatus tendon structure. Â© 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

In addition to their conventional (heavy-light chain heterodimeric) isotypes, IgM and IgW, sharks produce the novel isotype, IgNAR, a heavy chain homodimer that does not associate with light chains. Instead, its variable (V) regions act as independent, soluble units in order to bind antigen. In this chapter, we detail our immunization protocol in order to raise a humoral IgNAR response in the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) and the subsequent cloning of the single-domain V regions from this isotype in order to select antigen-specific binders by phage display.\n\nA study of 2-20 KeV X-rays from the Cygnus region\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBleach, R. D.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nTwo rocket-borne proportional counters, each with 650 sq c, met area and 1.8 x 7.1 deg FWHM rectangular mechanical collimation, surveyed the Cygnus region in the 2 to 20 keV energy range on two occasions. X-ray spectral data gathered on 21 September 1970 from discrete sources in Cygnus are presented. The data from Cyg X-1, Cyg X-2, and Cyg X-3 have sufficient statistical significance to indicate mutually exclusive spectral forms for the three. Upper limits are presented for X-ray intensities above 2 keV for Cyg X-4 and Cyg X-5 (Cygnus loop). A search was made on 9 August 1971 for a diffuse component of X-rays 1.5 keV associated with an interarm region of the galaxy at galactic longitudes in the vicinity of 60 degrees. A statistically significant excess associated with a narrow disk component was detected. Several possible emission models are discussed, with the most likely candidate being a population of unresolvable low luminosity discrete sources.\n\nBiological characterization of HIV type 1 envelope V3 regions from mothers and infants associated with perinatal transmission.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatala, E; Hahn, T; Yedavalli, V R; Ahmad, N\n\n2001-12-10\n\nOur previous study has shown that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope V3 region minor genotypes of infected mothers were transmitted to their infants and predominated initially as a homogeneous virus population in the infants (Ahmad N, Baroudy BM, Baker RC, et al.: J Virol 1995;69:1001-1012). Here we have characterized the biological properties, including cellular tropism, replication efficiency, cytopathic effects, and coreceptor utilization, of these V3 region isolates from mothers and infants. Nineteen V3 region sequences from three mother-infant pairs, including the minor variants of mothers and the major variants of infants as characterized in our previous study, were reciprocally inserted into an HIV-1 infectious molecular clone, pNL4-3, and chimeric viruses were generated by DNA transfections into HeLa cells. Equal amounts of chimeric viruses were then used to infect T lymphocyte cell lines (A3.01 and MT-2), primary blood lymphocytes (PBLs), primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), and coreceptor cell lines. We found that the V3 region chimeras failed to replicate in T lymphocyte cell lines but replicated in MDMs and PBLs, albeit at reduced levels compared with R5 laboratory HIV-1 strains. In addition, the V3 region chimeras were able to infect the HOS-CD4(+)CCR5(+) cell line, suggesting CCR5 coreceptor utilization. Moreover, the V3 region chimeras were unable to induce syncytia in MT-2 cells, indicative of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotypes. In conclusion, the HIV-1 minor genotypes of infected mothers with macrophage-tropic and NSI or R5 phenotypes are transmitted to their infants and are initially maintained with the same properties.\n\nEvolution of Regions Containing Antibiotic Resistance Genes in FII-2-FIB-1 ColV-Colla Virulence Plasmids.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoran, Robert A; Hall, Ruth M\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThree ColV virulence plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes were assembled from draft genome sequences of commensal ST95, ST131, and ST2705 Escherichia coli isolates from healthy Australians. Plasmids pCERC4, pCERC5, and pCERC9 include almost identical backbones containing FII-2 and FIB-1 replicons and the conserved ColV virulence region with an additional ColIa determinant. Only pCERC5 includes a complete, uninterrupted F-like transfer region and was able to conjugate. pCERC5 and pCERC9 contain Tn1721, carrying the tet(A) tetracycline resistance determinant in the same location, with Tn2 (bla TEM ; ampicillin resistance) interrupting the Tn1721 in pCERC5. pCERC4 has a Tn1721/Tn21 hybrid transposon carrying dfrA5 (trimethoprim resistance) and sul1 (sulfamethoxazole resistance) in a class 1 integron. Four FII-2:FIB-1 ColV-ColIa plasmids in the GenBank nucleotide database have a related transposon in the same position, but an IS26 has reshaped the resistance gene region, deleting 2,069âbp of the integron 3'-CS, including sul1, and serving as a target for IS26 translocatable units containing bla TEM , sul2 and strAB (streptomycin resistance), or aphA1 (kanamycin/neomycin resistance). Another ColV-ColIa plasmid containing a related resistance gene region has lost the FII replicon and acquired a unique transfer region via recombination within the resistance region and at oriT. Eighteen further complete ColV plasmid sequences in GenBank contained FIB-1, but the FII replicons were of three types, FII-24, FII-18, and a variant of FII-36.\n\nIntracellular diversity of the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA in marine protists (radiolarians) assessed by high-throughput sequencing.\n\nPubMed\n\nDecelle, Johan; Romac, Sarah; Sasaki, Eriko; Not, Fabrice; MahÃ©, FrÃ©dÃ©ric\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMetabarcoding is a powerful tool for exploring microbial diversity in the environment, but its accurate interpretation is impeded by diverse technical (e.g. PCR and sequencing errors) and biological biases (e.g. intra-individual polymorphism) that remain poorly understood. To help interpret environmental metabarcoding datasets, we investigated the intracellular diversity of the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene from Acantharia and Nassellaria (radiolarians) using 454 pyrosequencing. Individual cells of radiolarians were isolated, and PCRs were performed with generalist primers to amplify the V4 and V9 regions. Different denoising procedures were employed to filter the pyrosequenced raw amplicons (Acacia, AmpliconNoise, Linkage method). For each of the six isolated cells, an average of 541 V4 and 562 V9 amplicons assigned to radiolarians were obtained, from which one numerically dominant sequence and several minor variants were found. At the 97% identity, a diversity metrics commonly used in environmental surveys, up to 5 distinct OTUs were detected in a single cell. However, most amplicons grouped within a single OTU whereas other OTUs contained very few amplicons. Different analytical methods provided evidence that most minor variants forming different OTUs correspond to PCR and sequencing artifacts. Duplicate PCR and sequencing from the same DNA extract of a single cell had only 9 to 16% of unique amplicons in common, and alignment visualization of V4 and V9 amplicons showed that most minor variants contained substitutions in highly-conserved regions. We conclude that intracellular variability of the 18S rRNA in radiolarians is very limited despite its multi-copy nature and the existence of multiple nuclei in these protists. Our study recommends some technical guidelines to conservatively discard artificial amplicons from metabarcoding datasets, and thus properly assess the diversity and richness of protists in the environment.\n\n76 FR 19380 - Notice of Entry Into Effect of MARPOL Annex V Wider Caribbean Region Special Area\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-04-07\n\n...

The central region covers fields of 240mm Ã 240mm Ã 30mm size at 1mm resolution. The calculation was also done at finer 0.25mm resolution covering fields of 30mm Ã 30mm Ã 4mm size to see the effects of 0.55mm horizontal width of the ion source window and the halted trajectories of positive proton beam. The simulations show up to 7 turns of orbital trajectories, reaching about 1 MeV of beam energy. The distribution of accelerating electric fields and magnetic fields inside the cyclotron were calculated in 3 dimension using Opera3D code and Tosca modules for static magnetic and electric fields. The trajectory simulation was carried out using Scilab 5.3.3 code.\n\nFebruary 3, 1997 Region V Letter Regarding Title V Permitting Issues\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThis document may be of assistance in applying the Title V air operating permit regulations.

G.; Walsh, A.; Fukui, Y.; Aharonian, F.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nHESS J1825-137 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) whose TeV emission extends across Ë1 . Its large asymmetric shape indicates that its progenitor supernova interacted with a molecular cloud located in the north of the PWN as detected by previous CO Galactic survey (e.g. Lemiere, Terrier & Djannati-AtaÃ¯). Here, we provide a detailed picture of the interstellar medium (ISM) towards the region north of HESS J1825-137, with the analysis of the dense molecular gas from our 7 and 12 mm Mopra survey and the more diffuse molecular gas from the Nanten CO(1-0) and GRS 13CO(1-0) surveys. Our focus is the possible association between HESS J1825-137 and the unidentified TeV source to the north, HESS J1826-130. We report several dense molecular regions whose kinematic distance matched the dispersion measured distance of the pulsar. Among them, the dense molecular gas located at (RA, Dec.) = (18h421h,-13.282Â°) shows enhanced turbulence and we suggest that the velocity structure in this region may be explained by a cloud-cloud collision scenario. Furthermore, the presence of a H Î± rim may be the first evidence of the progenitor supernova remnant (SNR) of the pulsar PSR J1826-1334 as the distance between the H Î± rim and the TeV source matched with the predicted SNR radius RSNR Ë 120 pc. From our ISM study, we identify a few plausible origins of the HESS J1826-130 emission, including the progenitor SNR of PSR J1826-1334 and the PWN G018.5-0.4 powered by PSR J1826-1256. A deeper TeV study however, is required to fully identify the origin of this mysterious TeV source.\n\nRegional spread of HIV-1 M subtype B in middle-aged patients by random env-C2V4 region sequencing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStÃ¼rmer, Martin; Zimmermann, Katrin; Fritzsche, Carlos; Reisinger, Emil; Doelken, Gottfried; Berger, Annemarie; Doerr, Hans W.; Eberle, Josef\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA transmission cluster of HIV-1 M:B was identified in 11 patients with a median age of 52 (range 26â65) in North-East Germany by C2V4 region sequencing of the env gene of HIV-1, whoâexcept of oneâwere not aware of any risky behaviour. The 10 male and 1 female patients deteriorated immunologically, according to their information made available, within 4Â years after a putative HIV acquisition. Nucleic acid sequence analysis showed a R5 virus in all patients and in 7 of 11 a crown motif of the V3 loop, GPGSALFTT, which is found rarely. Analysis of formation of this cluster showed that there is still a huge discrepancy between awareness and behaviour regarding HIV transmission in middle-aged patients, and that a local outbreak can be detected by nucleic acid analysis of the hypervariable env region.

Non-temperature-sensitive revertant viruses had mutations that re-formed secondary structure by a direct back mutation of changes in the opposite strand. We mutated unpaired regions and selected revertants of viruses with single base deletions, where no obvious back mutation was available in order to gain information on secondary structure. Results indicated that conservation of length of a three base loop between two double-stranded stems was essential for a functional domain V to form. The requirement for the unpaired \"hinge\" base at 484 which is implicated in the attenuation of Sabin 2 was also confirmed. Results also underline the necessity for functional folding over local secondary structure stability.

Key to their immune response are heavy-chain, homodimeric immunoglobulins called new antigen receptors (IgNARs), in which the variable (V) domains recognize antigens with only a single immunoglobulin domain, akin to camelid heavy-chain V domains. The 1.45 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the type I IgNAR V domain in complex with hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) reveals a minimal antigen-binding domain that contains only two of the three conventional complementarity-determining regions but still binds HEL with nanomolar affinity by means of a binding interface comparable in size to conventional antibodies.\n\n[Homology analysis of the extended-V region of the surface proteins in different serotype Streptococcus mutans].\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Kui-Fang; Liu, Jian-Guo; Liu, Tian-Jia; Yang, De-Qin; Zhuang, Heng; Li, Song\n\n2006-08-01\n\nTo analysis the homology among the extended-V region of the surface proteins in different serotype Streptococcus mutans (c, f, d, g) and to find out it's significance in anti-caries vaccine. The DNA of the bacteria (standarded serotype c, d, f, g and partial serotype c clinicals) was extracted and the extended-V region (SrV+, 1 384-2 514 bp) was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then the products were assessed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) by endonuclease Dde I. The genotypings were sequenced and analysised using the program of BLAST on NCBI Gene Bank database. About 1.13 kb fragments were produced both in serotype c and f, the serotype d and g were failed. The RFLP results showed that five different patterns(A, B, C, D, E) among the 117 PCR products were reveled by Dde I. The ration of the genotypings A and B were the most among the strains, the C was lower, the D and E respectively was 1 and 3 strains per genotype. OMZ175 (serotype f) was belong to B genotype. Selected one of the A, B, C genotypings to sequenced and blasted. Then the results of the blastn showed that the identities of the gene sequence were 92%-98% between the serotype c and serotype f, part sequence of the serotype g was homology with the SrV+ of the serotype c, the protein sequence among serotype c, d, f, g were 77%-82%. It is reasonable to use some putative pipetides to study the anti-caries vaccine among the extended-V regions of the surface proteins in different serotype (c, d, f, g) in S. mutans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of widely cultivated Ganoderma in China based on the mitochondrial V4-V6 region of SSU rDNA.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, X W; Su, K Q; Zhang, Y M\n\n2015-02-02\n\nGanoderma mushroom is one of the most prescribed traditional medicines and has been used for centuries, particularly in China, Japan, Korea, and other Asian countries. In this study, different strains of Ganoderma spp and the genetic relationships of the closely related strains were identified and investigated based on the V4-V6 region of mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal DNA of the Ganoderma species. The sizes of the mitochondrial ribosomal DNA regions from different Ganoderma species showed 2 types of sequences, 2.0 or 0.5 kb. A phylogenetic tree was constructed, which revealed a high level of genetic diversity in Ganoderma species. Ganoderma lucidum G05 and G. eupense G09 strains were clustered into a G. resinaceum group. Ganoderma spp G29 and G22 strains were clustered into a G. lucidum group. However, Ganoderma spp G19, G20, and G21 strains were clustered into a single group, the G. lucidum AF214475, G. sinense, G. strum G17, G. strum G36, and G. sinense G10 strains contained an intron and were clustered into other groups.\n\nGANP regulates the choice of DNA repair pathway by DNA-PKcs interaction in AID-dependent IgV region diversification.\n\nPubMed\n\nEid, Mohammed Mansour Abbas; Maeda, Kazuhiko; Almofty, Sarah Ameen; Singh, Shailendra Kumar; Shimoda, Mayuko; Sakaguchi, Nobuo\n\n2014-06-15\n\nRNA export factor germinal center-associated nuclear protein (GANP) interacts with activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and shepherds it from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and toward the IgV region loci in B cells. In this study, we demonstrate a role for GANP in the repair of AID-initiated DNA damage in chicken DT40 B cells to generate IgV region diversity by gene conversion and somatic hypermutation. GANP plays a positive role in IgV region diversification of DT40 B cells in a nonhomologous end joining-proficient state. DNA-PKcs physically interacts with GANP, and this interaction is dissociated by dsDNA breaks induced by a topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide, or AID overexpression. GANP affects the choice of DNA repair mechanism in B cells toward homologous recombination rather than nonhomologous end joining repair. Thus, GANP presumably plays a critical role in protection of the rearranged IgV loci by favoring homologous recombination of the DNA breaks under accelerated AID recruitment.

Variable V3 regions of 21 reference strains and 34 wild strains referred to species belonging to the genera Pediococcus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Weissella, and Streptococcus were analyzed. DGGE profiles obtained were species-specific for most of the cultures tested. Moreover, it was possible to group the remaining LAB reference strains according to the migration of their 16S V3 region in the denaturing gel. The results are discussed with reference to their potential in the analysis of LAB communities in food, besides shedding light on taxonomic aspects.\n\nThe Hidden Dynamics of Relativistic Electrons (0.7-1.5 MeV) in the Inner Zone and Slot Region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClaudepierre, S.

E.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe present Van Allen Probes ECT/MagEIS observations of relativistic electrons (0.7-1.5 MeV) in the inner zone and slot region. We describe several approaches that are used to remove background contamination from the measurements, which in these regions is primarily due to very energetic inner zone protons. This careful analysis reveals that electrons with energies in excess of 1 MeV penetrated the slot region and into the inner zone following both the March and June 2015 geomagnetic storms. We also present evidence that electrons of these energies were present in the inner radiation belt region during earlier times in the Van Allen Probes era (e.g., in 2013). For both the March and June 2015 events, we examine pitch-angle distributions that shed light on the relevant physical processes responsible for the growth and decay of such relativistic electron enhancements in the inner zone and slot. We briefly discuss initial attempts to place an upper limit on the MeV electron flux intensity in the inner zone.\n\nInvestigation of the effective atomic numbers of dosimetric materials for electrons, protons and alpha particles using a direct method in the energy region 10 keV-1 GeV: a comparative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurudirek, Murat; Aksakal, OÄuz; AkkuÅ, Tuba\n\n2015-11-01\n\nA direct method has been used for the first time, to compute effective atomic numbers (Z eff) of water, air, human tissues, and some organic and inorganic compounds, for total electron proton and alpha particle interaction in the energy region 10 keV-1 GeV. The obtained values for Z eff were then compared to those obtained using an interpolation procedure. In general, good agreement has been observed for electrons, and the difference (%) in Z eff between the results of the direct and the interpolation method was found to be <10 % for all materials, in the energy range from 10 keV to 1 MeV. More specifically, results of the two methods were found to agree well (Dif. <10 %) for air, calcium fluoride, kapton polyimide film, paraffin wax and plastic scintillator in the entire energy region with respect to the total electron interaction. On the other hand, values for Z eff calculated using both methods for protons and alpha particles generally agree with each other in the high-energy region above 10 MeV.\n\nMasses, Dimensionless Kerr Parameters, and Emission Regions in GeV Gamma-Ray-loud Blazars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXie, G.-Z.; Ma, L.; Liang, E.-W.; Zhou, S.-B.; Xie, Z.-H.\n\n2003-11-01\n\nWe have compiled sample of 17 GeV Î³-ray-loud blazars, for which rapid optical variability and Î³-ray fluxes are well observed, from the literature. We derive estimates of the masses, the minimum Kerr parameters amin, and the size of the emission regions of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) for the blazars in the sample from their minimum optical variability timescales and Î³-ray fluxes. The results show that (1) the masses derived from the optical variability timescale (MH) are significantly correlated with the masses from the Î³-ray luminosity (MKNH); (2) the values of amin of the SMBHs with masses MH>=108.3 Msolar (three out of 17 objects) range from ~0.5 to ~1.0, suggesting that these SMBHs are likely to be Kerr black holes. For the SMBHs with MH<108.3 Msolar, however, amin=0, suggesting that a nonrotating black hole model cannot be ruled out for these objects. In addition, the values of the size of the emission region, r*, for the two kinds of SMBHs are significantly different. For the SMBHs with amin>0, the sizes of the emission regions are almost within the horizon (2rG) and marginally bound orbit (4rG), while for those with amin=0 they are in the range (4.3-66.4)rG, extending beyond the marginally stable orbit (6rG). These results may imply that (1) the rotational state, the radiating regions, and the physical processes in the inner regions for the two kinds of SMBH are significantly different and (2) the emission mechanisms of GeV Î³-ray blazars are related to the SMBHs in their centers but are not related to the two different kinds of SMBH.\n\nThe hidden dynamics of relativistic electrons (0.7-1.5Â MeV) in the inner zone and slot region\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nClaudepierre, Seth G.; O'Brien, T. P.; Fennell, J. F.\n\nWe present measurements of relativistic electrons (0.7â1.5 MeV) in the inner zone and slot region obtained by the Magnetic Electron and Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) instrument on Van Allen Probes. The data presented are corrected for background contamination, which is primarily due to inner-belt protons in these low-L regions. We find that ~1 MeV electrons were transported into the inner zone following the two largest geomagnetic storms of the Van Allen Probes era to date, the March and June 2015 events. As ~1 MeV electrons were not observed in Van Allen Probes data in the inner zone prior to these twomoreÂ Â» events, the injections created a new inner belt that persisted for at least 1.5 years. In contrast, we find that electrons injected into the slot region decay on much faster timescales, approximately tens of days. Furthermore, we find no evidence of >1.5 MeV electrons in the inner zone during the entire time interval considered (April 2013 through September 2016). The energies we examine thus span a transition range in the steeply falling inner zone electron spectrum, where modest intensities are observed at 0.7 MeV, and no electrons are observed at 1.5 MeV. To validate the results obtained from the background corrected flux measurements, we also present detailed pulse-height spectra from individual MagEIS detectors. These measurements confirm our results and also reveal low-intensity inner zone and slot region electrons that are not captured in the standard background corrected data product. Lastly, we briefly discuss efforts to refine the upper limit of inner zone MeV electron flux obtained in earlier work.Â«Â less\n\nThe hidden dynamics of relativistic electrons (0.7-1.5Â MeV) in the inner zone and slot region\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nClaudepierre, Seth G.; O'Brien, T.

It primarily works at above the Sc-L edge (Î»â=â3.11ânm) under near normal incidence while a second peak appears at above the V-L edge (Î»â=â2.42ânm) under grazing incidence. The V/Sc multilayer fabricated with a d-spacing of 1.59ânm and 30 bilayers has a smaller interface width (Ïâ=â0.27 and 0.32ânm) than the conventional used Cr/Sc (Ïâ=â0.28 and 0.47ânm). For V/Sc multilayer with 30 bilayers, the introduction of B 4 C barrier layers has little improvement on the interface structure. As the number of bilayers increasing to 400, the growth morphology and microstructure of the V/Sc layers evolves with slightly increased crystallization. Nevertheless, the surface roughness remains to be 0.25ânm. A maximum soft X-ray reflectance of 18.4% is measured at Î»â=â3.129ânm at 9Â° off-normal incidence using the 400-bilayers V/Sc multilayer. According to the fitted model, an s-polarization reflectance of 5.2% can also be expected at Î»â=â2.425ânm under 40Â° incidence. Based on the promising experimental results, further improvement of the reflectance can be achieved by using a more stable deposition system, exploring different interface engineering methods and so on.\n\n[Distribution of a deletion-insertion polymorphism in intergenic region V of mitochondrial DNA among the aboriginal population of Tuva].\n\nPubMed\n\nGolubenko, M V; Puzyrev, V P; Saliukov, V B; Kucher, A N; Sanchat, N O\n\n2000-03-01\n\nMitochondrial DNA region V deletion-insertion polymorphism was examined in three Tuvinian populations inhabiting western, northeastern, and southeastern parts of the republic. The 9-bp deletion was characterized by nonrandom distribution across the Tuva territory: its frequency in the western population (13.37%) was statistically significantly higher than that in the northeastern (4.62%), and southeastern populations, as well as in Mongols, who are territorially and ethnically close to Tuvinians. The insertion mutation in the region V was detected with a frequency of about 3% in two out of the three populations tested.\n\nA small XY chromosomal region explains sex determination in wild dioecious V. vinifera and the reversal to hermaphroditism in domesticated grapevines.\n\nPubMed\n\nPicq, Sandrine; Santoni, Sylvain; Lacombe, Thierry; Latreille, Muriel; Weber, Audrey; Ardisson, Morgane; Ivorra, Sarah; Maghradze, David; Arroyo-Garcia, Rosa; Chatelet, Philippe; This, Patrice; Terral, Jean-FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Bacilieri, Roberto\n\n2014-09-03\n\nIn Vitis vinifera L., domestication induced a dramatic change in flower morphology: the wild sylvestris subspecies is dioecious while hermaphroditism is largely predominant in the domesticated subsp. V. v. vinifera. The characterisation of polymorphisms in genes underlying the sex-determining chromosomal region may help clarify the history of domestication in grapevine and the evolution of sex chromosomes in plants. In the genus Vitis, sex determination is putatively controlled by one major locus with three alleles, male M, hermaphrodite H and female F, with an allelic dominance Mâ>âHâ>âF. Previous genetic studies located the sex locus on chromosome 2. We used DNA polymorphisms of geographically diverse V. vinifera genotypes to confirm the position of this locus, to characterise the genetic diversity and traces of selection in candidate genes, and to explore the origin of hermaphroditism. In V. v. sylvestris, a sex-determining region of 154.8 kb, also present in other Vitis species, spans less than 1% of chromosome 2. It displays haplotype diversity, linkage disequilibrium and differentiation that typically correspond to a small XY sex-determining region with XY males and XX females. In male alleles, traces of purifying selection were found for a trehalose phosphatase, an exostosin and a WRKY transcription factor, with strikingly low polymorphism levels between distant geographic regions. Both diversity and network analysis revealed that H alleles are more closely related to M than to F alleles. Hermaphrodite alleles appear to derive from male alleles of wild grapevines, with successive recombination events allowing import of diversity from the X into the Y chromosomal region and slowing down the expansion of the region into a full heteromorphic chromosome. Our data are consistent with multiple domestication events and show traces of introgression from other Asian Vitis species into the cultivated grapevine gene pool.\n\nPremature Aging Phenotype in Mice Lacking High-Affinity Nicotinic Receptors: Region-Specific Changes in Layer V Pyramidal Cell Morphology.\n\nPubMed\n\nKonsolaki, Eleni; Skaliora, Irini\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe mechanisms by which aging leads to alterations in brain structure and cognitive deficits are unclear. Î deficient cholinergic system has been implicated as one of the main factors that could confer a heightened vulnerability to the aging process, and mice lacking high-affinity nicotinic receptors (Î²2(-/-)) have been proposed as an animal model of accelerated cognitive aging. To date, however, age-related changes in neuronal microanatomy have not been studied in these mice. In the present study, we examine the neuronal structure of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP(+)) layer V neurons in 2 cytoarchitectonically distinct cortical regions in wild-type (WT) and Î²2(-/-) animals. We find that (1) substantial morphological differences exist between YFP(+) cells of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and primary visual cortex (V1), in both genotypes; (2) in WT animals, ACC cells are more susceptible to aging compared with cells in V1; and (3) Î²2 deletion is associated with a regionally and temporally specific increase in vulnerability to aging. ACC cells exhibit a prematurely aged phenotype already at 4-6 months, whereas V1 cells are spared in adulthood but strongly affected in old animals. Collectively, our data reveal region-specific synergistic effects of aging and genotype and suggest distinct vulnerabilities in V1 and ACC neurons. Â© The Author 2014.

W.; Burke, S.\n\n1989-12-01\n\nData on the reactions v Î¼ pâ Î¼- pÏ+ and bar v_Î¼ p to Î¼ ^ + pÏ ^ - in the Î(1232) region are presented and a test of the PCAC hypothesis, using a modified version of the Adler model, is performed. The analysis is based on 1081 events in the neutrino and on 180 events in the antineutrino reaction, obtained in a bubble chamber experiment with BEBC at CERN. The experimental cross-sections for an invariant hadronic mass W<1.4 GeV and an (anti-)neutrino energy E {/v L }>10 GeV are determined to be (0.628Â±0.059)Â·10-38 cm2 for the neutrino and (0.168Â±0.023)Â·10-38 cm2 for the antineutrino reaction. The Q 2 and W distributions, the density matrix elements of the Î resonance, and moments of the pion angular distribution are discussed. The data are found to be in good agreement with the Adler model in the Q 2 region below 1 GeV2. A maximum likelihood fit for the axial mass m A in the axial-vector form factor yields a value of m A =1.31Â±0.12 GeV. At low Q 2 the data confirm the PCAC hypothesis and the discrepancy, formerly observed between the experimental and theoretical cross-sections for v Î¼ pâ Î¼- pÏ+ at low momentum transfers ( Q 2â²0.2 GeV2), is understood as being due to inadequate pion âoff-mass-shellâ corrections.\n\nRegional correlations of V s30 and velocities averaged over depths less than and greater than 30 meters\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBoore, D.M.; Thompson, E.M.; Cadet, H.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nUsing velocity profiles from sites in Japan, California, Turkey, and Europe, we find that the time-averaged shear-wave velocity to 30 m (V S30), used as a proxy for site amplification in recent ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and building codes, is strongly correlated with average velocities to depths less than 30 m (V Sz, with z being the averaging depth). The correlations for sites in Japan (corresponding to the KiK-net network) show that V S30 is systematically larger for a given V Sz than for profiles from the other regions. The difference largely results from the placement of the KiK-net station locations on rock and rocklike sites, whereas stations in the other regions are generally placed in urban areas underlain by sediments. Using the KiK-net velocity profiles, we provide equations relating V S30 to V Sz for z ranging from 5 to 29 m in 1-m increments. These equations (and those for California velocity profiles given in Boore, 2004b) can be used to estimate V S30 from V Sz for sites in which velocity profiles do not extend to 30 m. The scatter of the residuals decreases with depth, but, even for an averaging depth of 5 m, a variation in log V S30 of 1 standard deviation maps into less than a 20% uncertainty in ground motions given by recent GMPEs at short periods. The sensitivity of the ground motions to V S30 uncertainty is considerably larger at long periods (but is less than a factor of 1.2 for averaging depths greater than about 20 m). We also find that V S30 is correlated with V Sz for z as great as 400 m for sites of the KiK-net network, providing some justification for using V S30 as a site-response variable for predicting ground motions at periods for which the wavelengths far exceed 30 m.\n\nTwo-photon double ionization of helium in the region of photon energies 42-50eV\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIvanov, I. A.; Kheifets, A. S.\n\n2007-03-01\n\nWe report the total integrated cross section (TICS) of two-photon double ionization of helium in the photon energy range from 42to50eV . Our computational procedure relies on a numerical solution of the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation on a square-integrable basis and subsequent projection of this solution on a set of final field-free states describing correlation in the two-electron continuum. Our results suggest that the TICS grows monotonically as a function of photon energy in the region of 42-50eV , possibly reaching a maximum in the vicinity of 50eV . We also present fully resolved triple-differential cross sections for selected photon energies.\n\nSerotype-Specific Neutralizing Antibody Epitopes of Human Adenovirus Type 3 (HAdV-3) and HAdV-7 Reside in Multiple Hexon Hypervariable Regions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQiu, Hongling; Li, Xiao; Tian, Xingui; Zhou, Zhichao; Xing, Ke; Li, Haitao; Tang, Ni; Liu, Wenkuan; Bai, Peisheng\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHuman adenovirus types 3 and 7 (HAdV-3 and HAdV-7) occur epidemically and contribute greatly to respiratory diseases, but there is no currently available licensed recombinant HAdV-3/HAdV-7 bivalent vaccine. Identification of serotype-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) epitopes for HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 will be beneficial for development of recombinant HAdV-3/HAdV-7 bivalent vaccines. In this study, four NAb epitopes within hexon hypervariable regions (HVRs) were predicted for HAdV-3 and HAdV-7, respectively, by using bioinformatics. Eight hexon chimeric adenovirus vectors with the alternation of only one predicted neutralizing epitope were constructed. Further in vitro and in vivo neutralization assays indicated that E2 (residing in HVR2) and E3 (residing in HVR5) are NAb epitopes for HAdV-7, and E3 plays a more important role in generating NAb responses. Cross-neutralization assays indicated that all four predicted epitopes, R1 to R4, are NAb epitopes for HAdV-3, and R1 (residing in HVR1) plays the most important role in generating NAb responses. Humoral immune responses elicited by the recombinant rAdH7R1 (containing the R1 epitope) were significantly and durably suppressed by HAdV-3-specific NAbs. Surprisingly, the rAdÎE3GFP-specific neutralizing epitope responses induced by rAdMHE3 (R3 replaced by E3) and rAdMHE4 (R4 replaced by E4) were weaker than those of rAdMHE1 (R1 replaced by E1) or rAdMHE2 (R2 relaced by E2) in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, rAdMHE4 replicated more slowly in HEp-2 cells, and the final yield was about 10-fold lower than that of rAdÎE3GFP. The current findings contribute not only to the development of new adenovirus vaccine candidates, but also to the construction of new gene delivery vectors.

In the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) become activated (aNSCs), and generate transit amplifying cells (TACs), which give rise to neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb. The vasculature is an important component of the adult neural stem cell niche, but whether vascular cells in neurogenic areas are intrinsically different from those elsewhere in the brain is unknown. Moreover, the contribution of pericytes to the neural stem cell niche has not been defined. Here, we describe a rapid FACS purification strategy to simultaneously isolate primary endothelial cells and pericytes from brain microregions of nontransgenic mice using CD31 and CD13 as surface markers. We compared the effect of purified vascular cells from a neurogenic (V-SVZ) and non-neurogenic brain region (cortex) on the V-SVZ stem cell lineage in vitro. Endothelial and pericyte diffusible signals from both regions differentially promote the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of qNSCs, aNSCs, and TACs. Unexpectedly, diffusible cortical signals had the most potent effects on V-SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis, highlighting the intrinsic capacity of non-neurogenic vasculature to support stem cell behavior. Finally, we identify PlGF-2 as an endothelial-derived mitogen that promotes V-SVZ cell proliferation. This purification strategy provides a platform to define the functional and molecular contribution of vascular cells to stem cell niches and other brain regions under different physiological and pathological states.

In this work we introduced the E442A mutation, which abrogates a salt-bridge between switch I and switch II, and the G440A mutation, which abolishes a main-chain hydrogen bond associated with the interaction of switch II with the Î³ phosphate of ATP, into myosin V. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer between mant-labeled nucleotides or IAEDANS-labeled actin and FlAsH-labeled myosin V to examine the conformation of the nucleotide- and actin-binding regions, respectively. We demonstrate that in the absence of actin, both the G440A and E442A mutants bind ATP with similar affinity and result in only minor alterations in the conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP). In the presence of ADP and actin, both switch II mutants disrupt the formation of a closed NBP actomyosin.ADP state. The G440A mutant also prevents ATP-induced opening of the actin-binding cleft. Our results indicate that the switch II region is critical for stabilizing the closed NBP conformation in the presence of actin, and is essential for communication between the active site and actin-binding region.

Here, plasma IgG responses were assessed in three HIV-1 gp120 vaccine efficacy trials (RV144, Vax003, Vax004) and in HIV-1-infected individuals by using arrays of overlapping peptides spanning the entire consensus gp160 of all major genetic subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of the virus. In RV144, where 31.2% efficacy against HIV-1 infection was seen, dominant responses targeted the C1, V2, V3 and C5 regions of gp120. An analysis of RV144 case-control samples showed that IgG to V2 CRF01_AE significantly inversely correlated with infection risk (OR= 0.54, p=0.0042), as did the response to other V2 subtypes (OR=0.60-0.63, p=0.016-0.025). The response to V3 CRF01_AE also inversely correlated with infection risk but only in vaccine recipients who had lower levels of other antibodies, especially Env-specific plasma IgA (OR=0.49, p=0.007) and neutralizing antibodies (OR=0.5, p=0.008). Responses to C1 and C5 showed no significant correlation with infection risk. In Vax003 and Vax004, where no significant protection was seen, serum IgG responses targeted the same epitopes as in RV144 with the exception of an additional C1 reactivity in Vax003 and infrequent V2 reactivity in Vax004. In HIV-1 infected subjects, dominant responses targeted the V3 and C5 regions of gp120, as well as the immunodominant domain, heptad repeat 1 (HR-1) and membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41. These results highlight the presence of several dominant linear B cell epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. They also generate the hypothesis that IgG to linear epitopes in the V2 and V3 regions of gp120 are part of a complex interplay of immune responses that contributed to protection in RV144.

It is known that the hMT+/V5 complex, an early visual cortical region, is recruited during explicit and implicit motion imagery, in addition to real motion perception. This study tests the feasibility of training healthy volunteers to regulate the level of activation in their hMT+/V5 complex using real-time fMRI neurofeedback and visual motion imagery strategies. We functionally localized the hMT+/V5 complex to further use as a target region for neurofeedback. An uniform strategy based on motion imagery was used to guide subjects to neuromodulate hMT+/V5. We found that 15/20 participants achieved successful neurofeedback. This modulation led to the recruitment of a specific network as further assessed by psychophysiological interaction analysis. This specific circuit, including hMT+/V5, putative V6 and medial cerebellum was activated for successful neurofeedback runs. The putamen and anterior insula were recruited for both successful and non-successful runs. Our findings indicate that hMT+/V5 is a region that can be modulated by focused imagery and that a specific cortico-cerebellar circuit is recruited during visual motion imagery leading to successful neurofeedback. These findings contribute to the debate on the relative potential of extrinsic (sensory) versus intrinsic (default-mode) brain regions in the clinical application of neurofeedback paradigms. This novel circuit might be a good target for future neurofeedback approaches that aim, for example, the training of focused attention in disorders such as ADHD.\n\nVisual motion imagery neurofeedback based on the hMT+/V5 complex: evidence for a feedback-specific neural circuit involving neocortical and cerebellar regions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBanca, Paula; Sousa, Teresa; Catarina Duarte, Isabel; Castelo-Branco, Miguel\n\n2015-12-01\n\nObjective.

It is shown that, in the 16-20 eV region, there are excellent correspondences in the peak positions and spacings among the photoabsorption, photoionization spectra, and fluorescence functions of OH(A) and H(n).\n\nGeV Emission in the Region of HESS J1809â193 and HESS J1813â178: Is HESS J1809â193 a Proton Pevatron?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAraya, Miguel\n\n2018-05-01\n\nHESS J1809â193 is an unidentified TeV source discovered by the High Energy Stereoscopic System and originally classified as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) candidate associated with the pulsar PSR J1809â1917. However, a recent study of deep radio observations and the interstellar medium near the source has found evidence for a hadronic scenario for the gamma-rays. Here, a detailed study of the GeV emission in the region using data from the Fermi-LAT is presented. The GeV emission has an extended morphology in the region of the TeV emission and the overall spectrum can be accounted for by a cosmic-ray population having a simple power-law spectrum with energies extending up to 1 PeV. However, the spectrum at tens of TeV should be observed more deeply in the future to confirm its hadronic nature, and other scenarios involving combinations of leptonic and hadronic emission from several of the known supernova remnants in the region cannot be ruled out. The nearby TeV source HESS J1813â178, thought to be a PWN, is also studied in detail at GeV energies and we find a region of significant emission that is much more extended than the TeV emission and whose spectrum is softer than expected from a PWN but similar to those seen in several star-forming regions that are believed to accelerate protons. There is marginal evidence for a GeV point source at the location of the X-ray PWN, beside the extended emission.\n\nMagnetized Converging Flows toward the Hot Core in the Intermediate/High-mass Star-forming Region NGC 6334 V\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJuÃ¡rez, Carmen; Girart, Josep M.; Zamora-AvilÃ©s, Manuel\n\nWe present Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations at 345 GHz toward the intermediate/high-mass cluster-forming region NGC 6334 V. From the dust emission we spatially resolve three dense condensations, the brightest one presenting the typical chemistry of a hot core. The magnetic field (derived from the dust polarized emission) shows a bimodal converging pattern toward the hot core. The molecular emission traces two filamentary structures at two different velocities, separated by 2 km s{sup â1}, converging to the hot core and following the magnetic field distribution. We compare the velocity field and the magnetic field derived from the SMA observations with magnetohydrodynamicmoreÂ Â» simulations of star-forming regions dominated by gravity. This comparison allows us to show how the gas falls in from the larger-scale extended dense core (â¼0.1 pc) of NGC 6334 V toward the higher-density hot core region (â¼0.02 pc) through two distinctive converging flows dragging the magnetic field, whose strength seems to have been overcome by gravity.Â«Â less\n\nGeology of the Bellona Fossae (V15) Region of Venus\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZimbelman, J. R.\n\n2002-05-01\n\nA preliminary geologic map of the the Bellona Fossae (V15) quadrangle on Venus was produced as part of the NASA-funded planetary mapping program. Geologic interpretations are based primarily on the basis of morphology, texture, radar reflectance, and relative stratigraphy derived from Magellan Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, based on FMAP mosaics showing SAR data at 75 m/pixel resolution, and compiled on a digital base map at 1:5M scale produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. This quadrangle covers approximately 5 million square kilometers of the northern lowlands of Venus, and it includes the Bellona Fossae and Fee Fossae fracture systems of western Kawelu Planitia and northern Ulfrun Regio, along with an arcuate chain of volcano-tectonic centers called coronae (e.g., Ki and Tituba Coronae). Exposed materials are dominated by relatively featureless regional plains and several centers of lobate plains (e.g., Uzume Fluctus) interpreted to be lava flow fields emplaced by effusion from separate vents. Based on stratigraphic relationships at unit contacts, the oldest exposed material units are isolated patches of complex-faulted tessera terrain, restricted to the eastern and southwestern margins of the quadrangle. Relatively small exposures of lineated plains, mountain belt, ridged plains, and dark plains materials are scattered throughout the quadrangle, with only a few impact craters and their associated ejecta and impact-induced flows (e.g., Mumtaz-Mahal crater) representing the latest materials. The tectonism associated with the coronae appears to predate the regional plains for the most part, but individual coronae are the source for lobate plains volcanism which implies that activity at these structural features encompasses much of the time span portrayed in the regional stratigraphy. Northeast-southwest-oriented lineaments exposed in Bellona Fossae not only are generally coincident with the coronae structures, but also cut patches of the stratigraphically\n\nSequence variation in the env gene of simian immunodeficiency virus recovered from immunized macaques is predominantly in the V1 region.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlmond, N; Jenkins, A; Heath, A B; Kitchin, P\n\n1993-05-01\n\nThree cynomolgus macaques were immunized with recombinant envelope protein preparations derived from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Although humoral and cellular responses were elicited by the immunization regime, all macaques became infected upon challenge with 10 MID50 of the 11/88 virus challenge stock of SIVmac251-32H. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify proviral SIV gp120 sequences present in the blood of both immunized and control macaques at 2 months post-infection. A comparison of the predominant sequences found in the region from V2 to V5 of gp120 failed to differentiate provirus recovered from either immunized or control animals. A detailed investigation of sequences obtained from the hypervariable V1 region identified a mixture of sequences in both immunized and control macaques. Some sequences were identical to those previously detected in the virus challenge stock, whereas others had not been detected previously. Phenogram analysis of the new V1 sequences found in immunized animals revealed that they were quite distinct from those from the virus challenge stock and that they included alterations to potential N-linked glycosylation sites. In contrast, new sequence variants recovered from the control animals were closely related to sequences from the virus challenge stock. The difference in diversity of new V1 sequences recovered from immunized and control macaques was highly significant (P < 0.001). Thus, the presence of pre-existing immune responses to SIV envelope protein is associated with greater genetic change in the V1 region of gp120. These data are discussed in relation to the epitopes of SIV gp120 that may confer protection from in vivo challenge.\n\nSelf-focusing of a high current density ion beam extracted with concave electrodes in a low energy region around 150 eV.\n\nPubMed\n\nHirano, Y; Kiyama, S; Koguchi, H; Sakakita, H\n\n2014-02-01\n\nSpontaneous self-focusing of ion beam with high current density (Jc â¼ 2 mA/cm(2), Ib â¼ 65 mA) in low energy region (â¼150 eV) is observed in a hydrogen ion beam extracted from an ordinary bucket type ion source with three electrodes having concave shape (acceleration, deceleration, and grounded electrodes). The focusing appears abruptly in the beam energy region over â¼135-150 eV, and the Jc jumps up from 0.7 to 2 mA/cm(2). Simultaneously a strong electron flow also appears in the beam region. The electron flow has almost the same current density. Probably these electrons compensate the ion space charge and suppress the beam divergence.\n\nRelative Abundances of Cosmic Ray Nuclei B-C-N-O in the Energy Region from 10 GeV/n to 300 GeV/n.

ATIC is comprised of a fully active bismuth germanate calorimeter, a carbon target with embedded scintillator hodoscopes, and a silicon matrix that is used as a main charge detector. The silicon matrix produces good charge resolution for the protons and helium but only a partial resolution for heavier nuclei. In the present paper a charge resolution of ATIC device was essentially improved and backgrounds were reduced in the region from Be to Si by means of the upper layer of the scintillator hodoscope that was used as an additional charge detector together with the silicon matrix. The flux ratios of nuclei B/C, O/C, N/C in the energy region from about 10 GeV/nucleon to 300 GeV/nucleon that were obtained from new high-resolution and high-quality charge spectra of nuclei are presented. The results are compared with existing theoretical predictions.\n\nSingle Ï+ electroproduction on the proton in the first and second resonance regions at 0.25GeV2V2\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEgiyan, H.; Aznauryan, I.

For the first time, to our knowledge, the absolute cross sections were measured, covering nearly the full angular range in the hadronic center-of-mass frame. We extracted the structure functions ÏTL,ÏTT, and the linear combination ÏT+ÉÏL by fitting the Ï dependence of the measured cross sections and compared them with the MAID and Sato-Lee models.\n\nIndian Long-term Non-Progressors Show Broad ADCC Responses with Preferential Recognition of V3 Region of Envelope and a Region from Tat Protein.\n\nPubMed\n\nKulkarni, Archana; Kurle, Swarali; Shete, Ashwini; Ghate, Manisha; Godbole, Sheela; Madhavi, Vijaya; Kent, Stephen J; Paranjape, Ramesh; Thakar, Madhuri\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHIV-specific antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) is likely to be important in governing protection from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and slowing disease progression. Little is known about the ADCC responses to HIV-1 subtype C. We characterized ADCC responses in HIV-1 subtype C-infected Indian subjects with slow disease progression and identified the dominant antigenic regions recognized by these antibodies. ADCC responses were measured in plasma from 34 long-term non-progressors (LTNPs), who were asymptomatic and maintained CD4 count above 500 cells/mm 3 for the last 7âyears in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 58 ART naÃ¯ve progressors with CD4 count <500 cells/mm 3 against overlapping HIV-1 peptides using a flow cytometry-based antibody-dependent natural killer (NK) cell activation assay. The assay measured CD107a expression on NK cells as a marker of antibody-dependent NK cell activation and IFN-Î³ secretion by NK cells upon activation. The ADCC epitopes were mapped using the matrix of overlapping peptides. Indian LTNPs showed higher and broader ADCC responses compared to the progressors. The Env-C and Tat-specific ADCC responses were associated with lower plasma viral load, whereas the Env-C responses were also associated with higher CD4 counts. Five of 10 LTNP responders targeted epitopes in the V3 region (amino acids 288-330) of Env-C. Additionally, three Tat regions were targeted by ADCC antibodies from LTNPs. ADCC responses were associated with slow HIV progression in Indian subtype C-infected cohort. The frequently recognized peptides from the V3 loop of Env and the novel epitopes from Tat by the LTNPs warrants further study to understand the role of ADCC responses to these regions in control and prevention of HIV-1 infection.\n\nStorm/Quiet Ratio Comparisons Between TIMED/SABER NO (sup +)(v) Volume Emission Rates and Incoherent Scatter Radar Electron Densities at E-Region Altitudes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFernandez, J. R.; Mertens, C. J.; Bilitza, D.; Xu, X.; Russell, J. M., III; Mlynczak, M. G.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBroadband infrared limb emission at 4.3 microns is measured by the TIMED/SABER instrument. At night, these emission observations at E-region altitudes are used to derive the so called NO+(v) Volume Emission Rate (VER). NO+(v) VER can be derived by removing the background CO2(v3) 4.3 microns radiance contribution using SABER-based non-LTE radiation transfer models, and by performing a standard Abel inversion on the residual radiance. SABER observations show that NO+(v) VER is significantly enhanced during magnetic storms in accordance with increased ionization of the neutral atmosphere by auroral electron precipitation, followed by vibrational excitation of NO+ (i.e., NO+(v)) from fast exothermic ion-neutral reactions, and prompt infrared emission at 4.3 m. Due to charge neutrality, the NO+(v) VER enhancements are highly correlated with electron density enhancements, as observed for example by Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR). In order to characterize the response of the storm-time E-region from both SABER and ISR measurements, a Storm/Quiet ratio (SQR) quantity is defined as a function of altitude. For SABER, the SQR is the ratio of the storm-to-quiet NO+(v) VER. SQR is the storm-to-quiet ratio of electron densities for ISR. In this work, we compare SABER and ISR SQR values between 100 to 120 km. Results indicate good agreement between these measurements. SQR values are intended to be used as a correction factor to be included in an empirical storm-time correction to the International Reference Ionosphere model at E-region altitudes.\n\nEnergy-dependent dynamics of keV to MeV electrons in the inner zone, outer zone, and slot regions.\n\nPubMed\n\nReeves, Geoffrey D; Friedel, Reiner H W; Larsen, Brian A; Skoug, Ruth M; Funsten, Herbert O; Claudepierre, Seth G; Fennell, Joseph F; Turner, Drew L; Denton, Mick H; Spence, Harlan E; Blake, J Bernard; Baker, Daniel N\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe present observations of the radiation belts from the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron and Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer particle detectors on the Van Allen Probes satellites that illustrate the energy dependence and L shell dependence of radiation belt enhancements and decays. We survey events in 2013 and analyze an event on 1 March in more detail. The observations show the following: (a) at all L shells, lower energy electrons are enhanced more often than higher energies; (b) events that fill the slot region are more common at lower energies; (c) enhancements of electrons in the inner zone are more common at lower energies; and (d) even when events do not fully fill the slot region, enhancements at lower energies tend to extend to lower L shells than higher energies. During enhancement events the outer zone extends to lower L shells at lower energies while being confined to higher L shells at higher energies. The inner zone shows the opposite with an outer boundary at higher L shells for lower energies. Both boundaries are nearly straight in log(energy) versus L shell space. At energies below a few 100âkeV, radiation belt electron penetration through the slot region into the inner zone is commonplace, but the number and frequency of \"slot filling\" events decreases with increasing energy. The inner zone is enhanced only at energies that penetrate through the slot. Energy- and L shell-dependent losses (that are consistent with whistler hiss interactions) return the belts to more quiescent conditions.\n\nEnergy-dependent dynamics of keV to MeV electrons in the inner zone, outer zone, and slot regions\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nReeves, Geoffrey D.; Friedel, Reiner H.
