Smith is reportedly frustrated at not getting enough playing time due to the arrival of Shaun Wright - Phillips.(17)(2)Terrible player anyway about the same level that watford could hope for or should i say no hope\n\n04 Jan 2012 22:48:54\n\nAlastair Slowe is set to join Colchester from Yeovil(4)(2)\n\n04 Jan 2012 22:48:32\n\nMates mate works for Stevenage. Says Robin Shroot will sign for Crawley before the weekend. Gutted to see him go but he reckons deal is worth 80-100k, not bad considering we got him for a free!(5)(3)\n\n04 Jan 2012 22:44:12\n\nBoro apparently swooping in for Steve Howard from Leicester on a loan deal till the end of the season to help boost boro's diminutive strikeforce(3)(10)\n\n04 Jan 2012 22:01:03\n\nED, Any reading fc rumours in?(2)(8)Kebe to leicester\n\n04 Jan 2012 22:32:07\n\nMore and more rumours circulating that Saints are tracking \"injured\" Kris Commons in a deal that could see Jason Puncheon heading the other way in a player + cash deal(12)(12)How badly injured is he?

Bolton and Stoke are said to be the only other suitable options. Onuoha is said to be in favour of the stoke move due to Europa League football and the current league position of the established team. A £2.5 Million fee is said to be enough to get the service of the pacey defender.\n\nAlso at Stoke Hoillet looking highly likely to come in and add competition with Pennant and Etherington.\n\nEls(12)(7)QPR will wade in and take them bothSeems QPR fans think if you pay over the odds on transfers and wages players will automatically sign, the reality is that some players actually care about the quality of football played and the management, so don't assume all these players will jump at the chance to join QPR especially since they look like relegation contenders based on current form.\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:59:38\n\nPaul Lambert lining up bid for Snodgrass if things do not work out will then got for Millwall's James Henry(7)(15)Henry's on his way to IpswichWhy on earth would he go to ipswich?! Should come home to ReadingGive it a rest on snods joining little norwich.wasting there time.Little Norwich, that comes from a team who were once a force and aren't no more. but still think they are .....league One at the best.\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:57:46\n\nIpswich try and buy Eastwood from coventry, James Henry from Millwall and Matt Ritchie from Shrews(7)(11)Shame Richie plays for Swindon and he's linked to a return to fratton park\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:57:19\n\nColchester manager John Ward has enquired the possibility of taking Derby striker Chris Maguire on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nMaguire has failed to force himself into the Derby first team.(6)(1)\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:47:51\n\nWest Bromwich Albion have been in touch with Nacho Novo over a proposed loan to permanent deal from the Sporting Gij�n forward.(7)(7)He would be a great signing for us.Thats about your level!Novo says he wont move till end of season.\n\nsky sports.\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:47:00\n\nLeicester have placed a bid in Chesterfield Keeper Tommy LEE for 350k which is higher than Leeds 275k bid at the weekend the Spireites have accepted the deal just LEE to agree personnel terms\n\nKasper deal to Blackburn done deal(3)(19)If Kaspar does leave I really don't think he would go to a team that is struggling at the bottom of the Premiership. Spurs yes, Blackburn no.M8 this is bs kasper will never leave leicester and anyway why would Blackburn want him they have got Paul RobinsonThis guys just jealous at how good kasper is\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:44:09\n\nsheffield united ins anthony wordsworth colchester liam boyce werder bremen nathan ellington swap chad evans plus cash out- quiny middlesbrough long man utd montgomery leeds(3)(13)\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:33:04\n\nLol qpr think their big time now! Utter rubbish. Samba is spurs/arsenal bound. And Hoillet I've heard Stoke city are very interested(12)(3)\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:28:24\n\nFriend who works in Posh Commercial Office tells me that Peterborough will make a club record bid this week for a forward, currently playing in League1.\n\nCould well be May from Stevenage.\n\nStrong rumours about Lewis and Bennett.\n\nBennett to Bolton if Cahill goes( £3m) and Lewis to Southampton or Hull(£1m) both with add ons\n\nLots of enquiries about Taylor but nothing concrete yet. Hasn't signed new contract because agent thinks he can get him a big deal awy from London Road(2)(2)I,d be very surprised if Hull City were interested in Lewis as we have just brought in Vito Mannone from Arsenal until the end of the season and now have 4 keepers.Hull City are looking to add a keeper on a permanent, Mannone doesn't have the best injury record, Gulacsi could be out long term, Basso can't play more than 45 minutes without his leg falling off and Oxley has the back of an 80 year old woman. I doubt �1m will be spent on one though.\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:21:44\n\nMan United Ins:\n\nMatt Hummels from Borussia Dortmund on a short loan deal\n\nCheick Tiote from Newcastle in a permanent deal\n\nKaka from Real Madrid on a permanent or loan deal(5)(36)Hummels on a loan deal .... , Kaka no way, he will stay in madrid...With Subotic injured and Dortmund in close contention for the BL title why on earth would they loan out Hummels?\n\nThey simply won't do itHere they come, the prawn sandwich brigade. If its not working.....throw money at it, typical Man U.Wishfull glory hunnting thinking. Provided me woth a laugh though.All Manu for spending it is moving club on if it was not for players Manu bring in to game teams like hull would not have chance so befor u start calling them look at players in game from man uIs that not what every football team does? buy players to strengthen your squad?\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:56:37\n\nAny Cardiff rumours ed?(4)(7)\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:14:28\n\nfulham to bid £ 8 mill for newcastle star Demba ba(4)(41)He is worth twice that and why would he go to team that are struggling when big teams would love a chance to sign himBa is locked in where he is for a long while no matter how well he does. Newcastle would want a great deal for him (especially in January) and no team is going to shell out 15m+ on a striker with his injury past. So as long as he stay fit, Newcastle have won the lotto (free signing), everyone else missed their chance.\n\n04 Jan 2012 21:01:23\n\nWesley hoolahan is coming back to blackpool in a deal that will see Matt Phillips go the other way.(2)(23)Were did you get thisfrom! never will hoolahan leave norwich to go bk to you wow people ruin this site with lies like that. this is as funny as the 1 involving michael owen. SUPERHOLTYou might be right bout one thing, matt phillips is possible target. but Wes back in the championship, thats laughable.This wont happen. Hoolahan wont go back to Blackpool and Phillips wont move to Norwich unless they bid silly money as hes only been here a year and we paid nearly 1m for him.\n\nThanks for Gilks best keeper in the championship by a mile325,000 we payed for him actuallyThis is a very silly rumour. Hoolahan isn't even that good. He's too lightweight and he wastes too much possession and dwells on the ball too much. Plus he's a liability as he is out every night night pissing it up. I would be suprised if a premiership team comes in for Phillips as he has been so inconsistent this season. He's only had about 2 decent games.Bpool dont need hoolahan and he wont go back there, as for matt philips if he goes will be to a big club (sorry norwich)at end of season.\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:56:59\n\nBeen to the ground today to pick up my tickets for saturday and I seen turner walk in with 2 players it looked like one was calvin Zola from burton and the other keith southern from Blackpool talking to jacko! Hopefully get them both in!(1)(5)Keith Southern is recovering from testicle cancer and is a firm part of our Blackpool Squad so you really think it was him?\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:50:36\n\nJust heard that Steve harped us to rejoin Brighton on loan until the end of the season(7)(3)He's already joined hullHe has not joined Hull City as Pardew did not want him cup tied and we needed a keeper for this saturday, Vito Mannone has joined us on loan until the end of the season, Hull Citys official website confirms this.Hul don't need a keeper on Sat, they are playing Ipswich so enough said ... (and I am a tractorboy!)\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:49:30\n\nWest Ham to make a bid for Jason Puncheon.\n\nMillwall to sign David Cotterill from Swansea.\n\nCharlton to sign John Bostock and Dean Parrett from Spurs , Anthony Wordsworth from Colchester and their former youth player Danny Shittu from QPR .(7)(9)Wordsworth will be going nowhere this window unless someone can pay a considerable sum of money. Charlton do not have the funds for him. - Robbie Cowling.Are charlton signing them permanently ? and where did you hear that from ?Charlton do have the funds you spanner they are half owned by billionaire kevin cash how ha s been giving them their money for tranfers so they can afford him even though we wont sign him because he is league 2 standard (wordsworth), and no-one on your team is over 1 million\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:48:09\n\nMark Stimson has resigned as manager of Kettering as speculation sees him linked with the job at Bristol rovers. Seen at the club this evening possibly to sign a deal to take over. Would be a good catch even until the end of the season as previous success with Stevenage and gillingham. Also a name mentioned is Steve tilson. Both of these managers mentioned would bring a new lease of life to the club still trying to aim for the playoffs now that automatic promotion looks uncertain(6)(3)Geraint Williams is to be interviewed.\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:24:34\n\nive just been doing some work at hillsbrough in the conferance centre wen i spotted leigh bromby got talking says hes going to sign for us and is glad to be back(4)(10)Hes injured..He's only 2 week away so could be true, Grayson wants rid and rumour of 900 k for killgallon\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:21:50\n\nDerby County appear to have renewed their interest in Notts County's Neal Bishop. Derby coaching staff have been spotted at Meadow Lane scouting Bishop.\n\nWhile the future of Paul Green remains uncertain, it seems Clough is a fan of the Notts County midfielder(5)(6)\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:18:39\n\nHuddersfield town\n\nIn -\n\nJon Stead on loan from Bristol or Ian Hulme from QPR\n\nSean St Ledger - Leicester - Loan\n\nDamion Stewart - Bristol - Loan\n\nBen Marshall - Stoke - Were buying him not sure how much for yet\n\nplus maybe 1 or 2 more\n\nJORDAN RHODES IS GOING NOWHERE\n\nOut-\n\nRobbie Simpson - Selling to Oldham\n\nNathan Clarke\n\nNick Colgan\n\nJoey Gudjohnson - Northampton on loan?\n\nTommy Miller\n\nAidan Chippendale\n\nWatch this space...(3)(19)Is this iain hume from preston? or rob hulse from QPR because it looks like you have no idea what you are talking aboutWell its plain you know nowt abt football iain hume plays for preston north end and is out for upto 8/9 weeks ,also he himself as stated he is happy to stay at prestonJon Stead plays for Bristol City, he got that right at least.\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:12:34\n\njelavic to sign for west brom for a fee in the region of 5.5mil and with the money rangers will sign leigh griffiths nacho novo(free) and make kyle bartleys move permanent(3)(17)Jelavic is also wanted by liverpool..As a gers man the way big jelavic is playin the now i think we would be lucky to get 5.5m for him. However, Ally will not sell for anything less than 7. As for the ins, griffiths wont be a target, wee nacho is definatley a possibilty after Ally stated he wouldn't rule anything out after he impressed in training over the Christmas perios while he was back home in Scotland. After Jelavic is sold, IF any of it is put into a transfer budget, it wont be used to make Bartley a perminant Rangers player, but to find a cheap replacement untill the case with HMRC is settled.Big step backward then lolIn other words celtic for the trebleWon't sell for less than 7 million ? Will sell for anything the bank tell them to sell for.Keep dreaming you balloon.What's it got to do with the bank, we don't owe them anything?\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:05:54\n\nWycombe striker and out performer this season, Stuart Beavon is in talks with Peterborough United.(4)(3)Watched beavon sat at bmth never gota sniff of anything and got the right hump very ordinary cant see peterbro wanting himI watched him too at bmth,hes very fast but cant hit a barn door with a banjo!!\n\n04 Jan 2012 20:01:09\n\nIpswich are to make a bid for Walsall Dynamo Richard Taundry after been recomended to Paul Jewell by former Walsall Manager ans Assistant Chris Hutchings(4)(5)Is this the same Chris Hutchings who could\n\nnot get any Saddlers players to perform to a half decent standard whilst he was manager?\n\n04 Jan 2012 19:55:55\n\nAdam Chambers could leave Walsall for Championship side Burnley for a fee in the region of £75,000(0)(9)Get a grip too old for us... we want young players to carry on building a future!! hope fully we will complete the signing of mee asap to add to trippier\n\n04 Jan 2012 19:55:02\n\nSurprisingly, Reading winger Jimmy Kebe is close to agreeing a new deal with the club, despite the fact that he's being heavily linked with a whole host of clubs, including west ham, leicester, wolves and qpr.\n\nSource: Reading chronicle twitter feed(4)(13)Seen before players sign a contract then leave shortly after, Gylfi, Hunt and Doyle just a few examples...\n\n04 Jan 2012 19:54:24\n\nKasper Schmeichel recieving interest from premier league clubs(11)(12)Expect Kasper Schmeicel to be an ex leceister player come the summer.\n\n04 Jan 2012 19:46:06\n\nCharlton are set to sign West Brom defender Joe Mattock on loan until the end of the season. Mattock is wanted by a number of Championship sides but the former England under 21 full back is keen on working with Chris Powell, of whom was Mattock's idol.\n\nAnother player set to leave Albion is goalkeeper Luke Daniels. The former England youth international is in talks with League 1 side Leyton Orient after the London side had a bid accepted permanently over last weekend.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo way are Orient signing Luke Daniels. We've got two fantastic young keepers in Lee Butcher and Jamie Jones (not to mention academy keeper Tom Lovelock) so why would we sign a player who never really proved himself in League 1 and is having a poor season in League 2?(4)(6)\n\n04 Jan 2012 19:45:55\n\ntevez to inter for sneider and 10 mil . you heard it hear first(14)(18)Heard this as well.mancini wants a midfielder and Inter Tevez.I think it will happen if Milan dont sell Pato quickly to PSG to use that money to buy Tevez\n\n04 Jan 2012 19:45:30\n\nasmoah gyan to be recalled from al ain as martin o'neill loses patience with Bendtner.\n\nLakaku loan to Stoke City until end of the season(10)(17)What aload a rubbish, Gyan can not leave Al Ain till end of AGREED contract.Lukaku cant change team twice in 1 season so thats a load of poopThen how come i've just seen them at the petrol station on viccy road duck.Both wrong . Gyan can be recalled it was a possibility that was mentioned by Niall Quinn. Secondly lukaku can now change team, a player cannot be move twice in one window. Look it upSorry mate but your wrgon, Gyan CAN NOT be recalled. otherwise he'd be back by now, also lukaku can be loaned out he just couldn't in the last window since he joined chelsea in the last window as well.\n\n04 Jan 2012 19:44:34\n\nHull City interested in taking Fraizer Campbell back to Hull, Loan untill end season possible perm.

The guy has never played premier league.

Simple. None of you ignorant persons believed that sum for Chamberlain either. We don't want or need to sell any of our best players so if your desperate then get your cheque books out or shut up.Im a saints fan and yes 12m is ridiculous ,but we are still there at moment and will strengthen so we will still be in the hunt come april. watch this spaceThat may not be what he's worth, in you oppinion. But that's the sort I fee it would take to get him to leave Saints.\n\nOtherwise Cortese will but it straight in the bin12m? you can't be serious! i suppose you think that lambert would only be sold in a straight swap for ronaldo? southampton fans need a reality check.Saints fans, make me laugh, �12,000,000 for a untried and untested hunk of junk, think your point is in the wrong the place pal �1,200,000 it would've made more sense if you'd put Cortese doesn't need to sell so will reject all bids.You are missing the point. His value, whether 12p or �12M, is irrelevant unless it really is stupid money that's offered and the same applies for all important members of Saints relatively thin squad at this time. By saying we need a reality check you are, in fact, simply demonstrating your ignorance.Alex Chamberlain was not tried and tested in the Premier League, he had had one decent season in League One, it is rumoured that Arsenal's original bid was �3m and Cortese would not budge. We all know he eventually went for �12m-15m... However, Schneiderlin is not worth �12m.

Lallana, Schneiderlin, Lambert, Fonte. Wonder who is next and who is posting these rumours?I think people need to live in the real world and accept that footballers occasionally may tell lies. Do you really think Lallana would put on twitter, what a great game to play in for my 150th appearance but now I want to leave and join a bigger club? Erm, no, footballers say what fans want to hear (well the sensible one's do) and although yes I agree that Lallana may be a Saints fan and love the club if a team like Man Utd come calling, you won't see him in Southampton for the dust of his Ferrari, but personally whilst pushing for promotion I can't see him leaving yet.Im a saints fan and lallana wouldnt even get on there bench! he has hardly put in a good performace for saints in the last 3 months\n\n04 Jan 2012 15:39:50\n\nRumours flying about that Paul Jewell will sign Jonnie Jackson from Charlton Ath and Jason Scotland will go to Charlton Ath.(4)(10)\n\n04 Jan 2012 15:37:46\n\nsteven pienaar is going to everton on loan with a chance to sign in the summer, its going to be announced tonight!(8)(14)He,s carp,Im sure Everton could find someone better than him !Hasn't been anounced yet!\n\n04 Jan 2012 15:37:10\n\nreports of takeover talks at Northampton town.

Paterson is wanted by a number of Championship teams.\n\n(8) (11)\n\nCompletley unbelievable Paterson is nowhere near championship or celtic standards\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a southend fan I can honestly say he is one of the worst players to ever put on a Southend shirt and there has been a few. If this rumour is true the Celtic are planning life in scots division three\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nPaterson is a big Rangers fan, hence the thread! As a Stockport County fan I can say he's the best striker I saw at Edgeley Park last season! He had a magnificent debut and scored a humdinger - how he doesn't get a game for Southend i will never know. As for being the worst player you've ever seen at Southend - Blair Sturrock, I rest my case.\n\nThe Scarf\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nHaHa, well done Scarf! Would love to see Paterson back at Edgeley Park - a great young player with a great attitude and a big heart. Southend have mugged him off - Gannon sign him up please!\n\n--------------------------------\n\nUnderstand he has turned down a L2 club to join a Conference side in time for this Saturday. Maybe it is Stockport, maybe not.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAs an Accies fan just want to say that Pato scored a couple of crackers for us and won us at least 5 penalties! We didn't get to see enough of him because of a hamstring injury. Hope he finds a good club, great young lad.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nToo all you Celtic, Stockport, Southend and Accies fans, I understand that Matt has turned down a L2 club and agreed to sign for Forest Green Rovers and play for his old Southampton Coach Dave Hockaday. Green Army!(15)(5)I know this site is full of crap but wanted by rangers and celtic haha\n\nHe is woeful, he hasnt been mugged off Tilson didnt want him he only came as part of the Barnard deal.As a Southend"
