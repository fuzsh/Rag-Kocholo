Introduction\n\nGlobal climate change now threatens all ecosystems on Earth and the species they support, and the services and resources they provide to humans [1]. Freshwater is a precious resource and its future, along with that of the species and ecosystems it supports (almost 7% of global biodiversity in spite of freshwaters being tiny in their areal extent and relative volume [2]) is uncertain. Freshwater ecosystems are among the most endangered. Threats from climate change, contamination, water harvesting, impoundment, and other stressors are widespread, and no freshwater ecosystem is secure in the face of these threats [3]. Springs have been usurped for human consumption globally, and lakes in alpine, Arctic, and boreal areas are impacted by climate warming and airborne pollutants (e.g., [4]). De Graaf et al. (2019) [5] estimate that two-thirds of the world’s developed watersheds will reach environmental flow limits due to groundwater pumping by 2050. These impacts on freshwater ecosystems call for improved understanding of these threats, how they affect biodiversity, and how to counter them. Among the key knowledge gaps are accurate and precise global lists of freshwater-dependent species. Only relatively recently have major steps been taken towards compiling such lists [6]. Addressing such gaps will bring us closer to solving these challenges to sustainable freshwater ecosystem stewardship. Each of the papers in this Virtual Special Issue (VSI) addresses knowledge gaps, with most papers focused on an individual major ecosystem type.\n\nAll kingdoms of life are found in freshwaters. At least 126,000 animal species may be dependent on freshwater ecosystems [6]. Many groups of freshwater organisms are still poorly known, particularly microbes and protists. As advocated for cyanobacteria [7], a polyphasic approach integrating information gained from morphology, molecular phylogeny, bioorganic chemistry (e.g., [8]), and ecology should be applied whenever possible to the taxonomy of freshwater taxa. Organisms do not occur in isolation outside of a biotic assemblage and ecosystem, and individual species cannot be protected unless whole systems are conserved (e.g., [9]). Some recent global initiatives have focused on this issue. For example, the Red List of Ecosystems of IUCN [10] provides a “Collapse” (CO) category, the analog of the extinct (EX) category for species proposed by IUCN [11]. The only ecosystem classified in this way was a freshwater ecosystem, the Aral Sea. A severe reduction in freshwater biodiversity there by 2050 was predicted more than 15 years ago [12]. However, there is a general bias towards terrestrial conservation in general biodiversity assessment, and a plea was recently published to include freshwater species [13]. To counter negative trends, the Alliance for Freshwater Life was recently launched [14] as a global, united call to protect freshwater biodiversity. This conservation expert network aims to provide the critical mass for effective representation of freshwater biodiversity, to develop solutions balancing the needs of development and conservation, and to more effectively communicate the important role of freshwater ecosystems.\n\nContinental aquatic ecosystems are among the most threatened and altered natural systems. Commonly, water is considered a free resource, and wetlands are perceived by people as wastelands that should be transformed into “useful” systems [15]. Considering coastal and inland waters, there is a continuous loss of natural wetlands and a continuous increase in man-made wetlands [16]. A review by Davidson (2014) [17] showed that the reported long-term loss of natural wetlands averages between 54%–57%, but the loss may have been as high as 87% since the 18th Century. Moreover, the author notes the lack of sufficient data to obtain a comprehensive overview of changes in wetland areas worldwide, particularly for Africa, Neotropics, and Oceania. Data are missing, especially for temporal trends, and also for some of the world’s major flooded forest areas such as those in the Amazon and Congo River basins [18].\n\nIn a compendium aiming at synthesizing global freshwater biodiversity in the different types of ecosystems, biogeographical patterns must be carefully considered. Since the early 19th century, the famous explorer-naturalist Alexander Von Humboldt realized that the tropics were richer in species than the temperate zones. Over time, many scientists formulated hypotheses to explain that pattern (e.g., reviews in [19,20,21]), yet the mechanisms responsible are still debated. But are tropical freshwater ecosystems richer in biodiversity than temperate ones [22]? As noted by many experts, the Palearctic region has the highest number of recorded species (for all taxa except vertebrates), but this result might not be representative of global patterns. Many scientists point out the lack of data for Central Africa, South-East Asia, and several parts of South America: in other words, most tropical regions [6,23,24]. Considering mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, crabs and crayfish, Collen et al. (2014) [25] found the greatest biodiversity for freshwater animals in the Pantropical area. The Indo-Malay region has the greatest proportion of freshwater taxa and the Palaearctic the lowest. Brazil is the most diverse single nation, with over 12% of all freshwater species, followed by the southeastern USA (sub-tropical/temperate climate), West Africa across to the Rift Valley lakes, the Ganges basin, and the Mekong basin. In that study, the distribution of restricted-range species also was highlighted as they are irregularly distributed across the tropics. Centers of endemism exist in the African Rift Valley lakes (particularly Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika), Thailand, Sri Lanka, and New Britain (Papua New Guinea). The diversity of fishes in tropical South America includes more than 5600 species, representing a majority of the world’s freshwater fishes [26]. In particular, the Amazon River basin is a center of fish megadiversity, with about 2500 species described and probably more than 1000 not yet described. Most of these are small-range endemic species. This high diversity is not a result of recent in situ radiations, but the effect of biogeographical events over geological time, in which high levels of geographic isolation and ecological specialization have strongly contributed to the maintenance of high biodiversity [6,27,28,29]. As mentioned before, data on insect diversity should also be interpreted with caution, as many experts report strong sampling and study biases [30]. Especially, the Holarctic insect fauna is clearly better studied than that of the Neotropical, Afrotropical, and Oriental regions [6].\n\nHowever, the western Amazon Basin and South-East Asia are the regions of highest dragonfly species richness [23]. According to Crow (1993) [31], who studied the distribution of aquatic plants across North America, aquatic plants did not show an increase in diversity towards the tropics, with some families dominating in temperate latitudes (i.e., Potamogetonaceae and Juncaginaceae) and others dominating in tropical latitudes (i.e., Podostemaceae and Hydrocharitaceae). Instead, a more recent study indicates that vascular macrophyte generic diversity for the tropics is greater than for temperate regions, and also species diversity may be greater for certain tropical regions compared to temperate ones. Tropical regions are also rich in endemic species compared with high latitudes, particularly Africa, where 64% of the total species present are endemic, and Central America and South America with 61% endemism [32]. Tropical freshwater ecosystems also encompass a great number of flood-tolerant tree species, as demonstrated in South America, where, in Amazonian wetlands, there are 53% of all tree species occurring in the overall Amazon [33]. Micro-organisms, such as bacteria (s.l.), viruses, protozoans, and fungi, are drastically understudied components of aquatic biodiversity [6]. Micro-algae and cyanobacteria are well studied, especially in Europe, North-America, Australia, and several South-American countries. So far, studies of freshwater diatoms indicate that there is no uniform response of diatom species richness across latitude: some authors find no pattern or even an inverse latitudinal gradient [34,35,36,37], while others found a positive response of species richness with a decrease in latitude [38,39]. Despite the scarcity of complete data (especially critical for the least-known groups such as Arthropoda, Nematoda, and micro-organisms) of the Oriental, the Neotropical, and the Afrotropical regions, the freshwater hotspots in terms of richness and endemicity are often located in these less-studied areas [6].\n\nIn this paper, we provide an overview of these different ecosystem types as an introduction to the VSI. We describe the characteristic features of each major type of freshwater ecosystem, the species and assemblages they support, and the threats they face. We also briefly explore what can be done to protect or restore these ecosystems. We thus aim at addressing the multiplicity of still and running freshwater environments, from headwaters down to large rivers and lakes (papers published in the VSI are cited in the following): groundwater and dependent ecosystems, springs and spring-fed streams [40,41,42,43,44,45], headwaters [46,47], glacial streams [48], streams, large rivers, ancient and large lakes, high-mountain lakes, oxbow lakes, reservoirs, urban freshwater habitats (fwh) [49], mires [50], small wetland ecosystems [51], Boreal and Arctic fwh, Antarctic fwh, Mediterranean fwh, tropical fwh [52], arid-climate fwh (Table 1; the ecosystem types addressed and flagship organisms are illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2).\n\nWe expect that the overview presented in this paper, together with the specific and more detailed information provided in each of the papers of this VSI, will guide scientific research and management aimed at protecting and restoring freshwater ecosystems around the world.\n\n2. Ground Water and Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystems (GDEs)\n\n2.1. Ground Water and Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystems\n\nGroundwater (GW) is one of the most essential freshwater resources. As the world’s largest reservoir of freshwater (glaciers excluded), GW plays a significant role in supporting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and enabling human life and activities. Globally, GW is the source of one-third of all freshwater withdrawals, supplying an estimated 36%, 42%, and 27% of the water used for domestic, agricultural, and industrial purposes, respectively [53,54]. In Europe, 65% of drinking water originates from GW [55]. The baseflow of rivers, lakes, and wetlands during periods of little or no rainfall relies upon GW discharge. Hydrologists have long recognized the connectivity between GW and surface water (SW), and therefore management approaches that consider GW and SW as a joint resource are needed for effective management of water resources [56].\n\nGW can be the main factor controlling the distribution and functionality of GDEs. GDEs are ecosystems whose species composition and ecological processes are influenced more or less directly by GW. GDEs vary in the degree of dependence on GW: some SW bodies are highly dependent on GW (for example, some SW bodies, such as GW-fed springs and upwelling sectors of streams and rivers across the hyporheic zone). Some GDEs are optionally dependent on GW when the subterranean water supports habitat conditions intermittently over time. It should also be noted that the dependence of an ecosystem on GW can be constant over time, or restricted to a particular period of the year, for example, during periods of drought (GDEs opportunistically dependent on GW). Subsurface groundwater-dependent ecosystems (SGDEs) are aquifers, also including in part and when present, their unsaturated portion (i.e., the vadose zone or the epikarst of some fractured aquifers and in caves).\n\nThe pressures acting on GDEs have significantly increased in the last decades and have determined the deterioration of their quantitative and qualitative status [57]. The database WATERBASE (the database containing data on the chemical quality and the characteristics of the GW bodies of European Union member states) revealed that 25% of GW bodies are characterized by a qualitative–quantitative state altered due to the co-occurrence of different anthropogenic factors [54,58,59]. Climate change [54], chemical pollution [60], overexploitation for irrigation [60], alteration of water flow, morphological alteration of SW bodies, drainage of wetlands, deforestation, and dam construction [59,61,62] are only a small portion of the activities that determine and have resulted in significant alterations of GDEs, with irreversible loss of biodiversity and severe changes in the composition of communities [63].\n\nThe main contaminants in groundwater are heavy metals [58,63], volatile organic compounds [63], pesticides [64], inorganic contaminants [58], and emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors [65]. In GDEs, the contaminants transported by the water flow infiltrate into the subsoil, giving mixtures of toxic substances [64,65]. Mining and manufacturing industries and waste disposal activities are the main cause of contamination by heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, nickel, chromium, and copper [66]. The contamination by organic compounds originates from point sources of fuel production, refining and distribution, textile production, and the industries producing paints and pesticides [66]. Among the main organic pollutants present in GDEs, aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX), and organochlorine hydrocarbons are widespread [66]. Pesticide contamination is mainly due to the presence of intensive agriculture, industry processes of timber, and activities of control of vegetation on road edges. Some chlorinated pesticides, organophosphates, carbamates, phenoxyacetic acids, and triazines [58,66] are persistent in groundwater, and as such, turn out to be particularly harmful to GDEs that are characterized by low-resilience communities, exposed for a long time to these pollutants.\n\nIn addition to pesticides, agricultural and agro-pastoral activities are among the main hazard centers that may determine the contamination by inorganic N-based compounds such as ammonium [63], nitrites, and nitrates [67], together with GW overexploitation for irrigation [60,68]. With regard to nitrates, the stygobionts (obligate GW dwellers) do not appear to be particularly sensitive [60], differently from what happens for ionized ammonium, which turns out to be lethal at concentrations ten times lower than the threshold value (0.5 mg L−1) established for groundwater in Italy [63].\n\nThe primary source of contamination from pharmaceutical compounds and endocrine disruptors in GW bodies is represented by urban and agricultural activities, which determine a load of wastewater in GDEs [69]. Among these hazard centers, there are hospital companies, food processing plants, municipal wastewater treatment plants, and industrial or agricultural production facilities [69,70]. As these endocrine disruptors are relatively new compounds, the ecotoxicological effects are still uncertain, even if their mode of action is known. Concern for EOCs in GW is expanding globally [71]. EOCs are natural or synthetic substances, not routinely monitored, that can induce known or suspected undesirable effects on humans and ecosystems [72,73]. EOCs’ family includes different classes of compounds such as disinfectants, industrials, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and illicit drugs, some of which are being detected in groundwater with concentrations exceeding 0.1 μg L−1 [74,75]. Such compounds present in traces, under chronic exposure conditions (>4 days), alter the endocrine system with consequences for the development and reproduction of invertebrates living in groundwater [76].\n\nClimate change is one of the leading factors threatening GDEs [77]. It can seriously affect the qualitative and quantitative components of GW resources, altering the interactions between GW and SW environments [62,78]. Together with GW overexploitation for many anthropic uses, climate change can help reduce seasonal water intake in the subsoil and determine an increase in the average temperature, a condition that is reflected not only on the quantitative and chemical-physical status of the GDEs but also on community composition. The effects of temperature increase due to climate change on GW fauna is still a matter of debate, even if recent studies have shown potential metabolic damage [79]. In particular, as regards the effect of climate change on the sensitivity of the invertebrates to agricultural pollutants, several studies [80,81,82] confirmed that an increase in temperature can alter the physiology of invertebrate species that live occasionally or permanently in the hyporheic habitat (for example, doubling the locomotion activity, altering the development time from the larval stages to the adult, increasing oxygen consumption rates, and even inducing death when the critical threshold is reached), increasing their sensitivity to pollutants, especially in those species with limited thermal tolerance (stenotherms) [79]. As a matter of fact, climate change may interact with many other stressors (e.g., pollutants). The toxicity of ionized ammonium to some GDE invertebrate species increases with temperature. Some other invertebrates are significantly stressed by a temperature increase of less than 3 °C relative to their thermal optimum [79]. For the GDE biota, the consequences of this double twine challenge may get worse than for SW communities. Hence, warm tolerant regional taxa may replace cold stenothermic ones, with probably complementary effects on ecosystem functioning but, at the same time, this will cause the non-substitutability extinction of one or more stenothermic species. In addition, in view of the predicted increases in water drought, pollution, marine intrusion, as is occurring in several GDEs, even the taxa most tolerant to warming will be unable to face the challenging chemical conditions or water depletion [81,82].\n\nIncreasing GW abstraction detrimentally affects coastal aquifers, leading to changes in the subsurface flow regime and inducing saltwater intrusion. Global-warming effects can increase GW salinity, altering GDE invertebrate physiology and diversity, especially for species with restricted tolerance to variation in salinity. If of prolonged duration, such stress leads to increased mortality [83] and potentially extirpation. Thus, an improved understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between GDE ecological processes and climate change is crucial for the development of appropriate solution-oriented strategies and measures for biodiversity conservation of GW and dependent ecosystems and cost-effective ecosystems-based climate change adaptation and mitigation. Multidisciplinary collaboration is needed to face these challenges [84].\n\nSGDEs are expected to be at risk under a climate warming scenario [85]. For lotic ecosystems, vertical hydrological connectivity is crucial to conserve freshwater biodiversity and maintain ecosystem functioning. Climate change is predicted to alter flow regimes of many rivers and may disrupt these connections, with severe ecological and societal impacts (loss of their ecosystem services). However, the extents of these impacts, from a simple compositional shift in benthic and hyporheic assemblages [86] to more severe consequences on food web structure and ecosystem processes [86], have been mainly investigated in naturally intermittent streams from arid or semiarid regions, and little is known about the ecological effects of surface/subsurface flow alterations in perennial temperate rivers and streams [87]. These studies highlight the role of climate change in freshwater biodiversity loss and changes in assemblage structure in SW bodies; conversely, the effects generated in GW ecosystems and how they are reflected in GDEs are almost completely unknown. Global change can quickly trigger threshold switches between fresh and saline conditions, and water levels can be rapidly lowered to the extent that even perennial rivers, springs, ponds, and aquifers will dry.\n\nGW harbors a unique fauna of unexpectedly high diversity that is not limited simply to the saturated zones of karst (e.g., caves) (Figure 1B) and the subsurface habitats of springs (Figure 1C). Stygobionts include bacteria, protists, invertebrates (e.g., platyhelminthes, annelids, molluscs, copepods—Figure 2A; syncarids, amphipods—Figure 2B; isopods, thermosbaenaceans, mysids, decapods), and vertebrates (amphibians and cavefish) [88,89]. Stygofaunal assemblages are commonly found in alluvial aquifers (Figure 1A) and the hyporheic zone of streams and rivers [90,91]. Stygobionts are strictly dependent on groundwater in which they complete their entire life cycle, and they have evolved traits to cope with the peculiarity of the GW environments. They generally are colorless and eyeless, small-sized, and may display a slender body [92,93]. These species have a low metabolism [82], slow development, and considerable longevity. Stygobionts have low fertility and long life-spans and are the basis of the low-resilience of GW communities [78,92,94].\n\nA high degree of endemism characterizes stygobiotic assemblages, with most stygobionts being narrowly endemic and restricted to a single GW site, low local diversity, and truncated food webs for the absence of photoautotrophy [92], at places replaced by chemoautotrophy [95]. The total number of stygobiotic taxa worldwide is still underestimated, with many undescribed [96,97,98]. Although the ecological dimensions of GW and GDEs have been recognized for decades [77,99,100] routine biological monitoring programmes are still omitted in the current legislation at the global scale [85,101].\n\nGW ecosystems have a biodiversity of great intrinsic conservation value, made up of rare, often endemic and particularly vulnerable species. Most taxa, at different taxonomic hierarchical levels (e.g., Crustacea Remipedia, Copepoda Gelyelloida, several genera of Copepoda Harpacticoida and Cyclopoida, Syncarida, Spelaeogriphacea, Thermosbaenacea) are phylogenetic and distributional relicts, the sole survivors of an ancient fauna whose ancestors lived in SWs and as a result of past climatic events have become extinct at the surface of the planet, thus now being the sole remnants of a fauna disappeared elsewhere. Many of these unique taxa, sometimes called “living fossils”, are considered to be at high risk of extinction at the global scale. However, to date, no tools are available to set biodiversity conservation priorities in GW habitats and the GDEs under the increasing anthropogenic pressures on the biological communities. Moreover, despite some SGDEs being Habitat Natura 2000 sites, most of these ecosystems and their outstanding biodiversity remain mostly unknown due to their \"hidden\" position. This, in turn, hinders efficient management planning, which, in a holistic view, includes, along with protection of the freshwater biodiversity, the GW component also. The conservation of GW biodiversity is limited by both intrinsic characteristics of taxa, and management issues. To acquire data for conservation purposes of the vast majority of invertebrates is extremely difficult, if not impossible, due to impediments such as (1) invertebrates and the high relevance of their ecological services are largely ignored by the public (social problem); (2) politicians and stakeholders are not informed about the problems of invertebrate conservation (political problem); (3) basic research and funding on invertebrates is insufficient (scientific problem); (4) most species remain unknown (Linnaean shortfall); (5) their distributions as described are poorly understood or unknown (Wallacean shortfall); (6) the number of populations and their variation in time and space is unknown (Prestonian shortfall); and (7) lifestyles and sensitivity to environmental changes are mostly unknown (Hutchinsonian shortfall) [102]. Recently the “Racovitzan shortfall” [103] has been added to explain the limits to collecting and discovering GW species. For these reasons, the development of international research programs for the less known invertebrate biodiversity is extremely important.\n\nIn 2001 the European Union granted the PASCALIS project (Protocols for the Assessment and Conservation of Aquatic Life in the Subsurface) to establish a strict protocol for the assessment of the biodiversity of aquifers, springs, and hyporheic environments at the Southern European scale, useful for defining effective sampling strategies and developing tools for conservation of subterranean fauna. GW biodiversity was mapped and analyzed [104], a few “hot spot” areas were identified by rarity, either of specific or generic richness of monotypic or exclusively European genera. The degree of endemism as a whole was high, but the results did not offer a reliable explanation as to the distribution of species or endemic taxa and underestimated stygodiversity due to the uneven availability of data. The BioFresh project [105] offered a further opportunity to refine the state of knowledge of the European stygobiotic fauna by creating a continental-scale database. It was populated with 21,700 records of a total of 1570 stygobiotic species. Analyses of those data indicated that Quaternary glaciation played a primary role in the spatial distribution of stygodiversity [106]. Stygofaunal richness increases significantly in the Balkans and other areas below 43° N [97]. However, the role of paleogeography and paleoclimatology since the Miocene [107], in the distribution of contemporary Balkan paleoendemics, remains outstanding. Robust data, such as those in the BioFresh database, should stimulate the European Union to include GW biodiversity in biomonitoring networks, to integrate the Habitat Directive by including GW habitats of priority interest, and identify rare or narrowly endemic taxa in the Annexes of the Habitat Directive 92/43/CEE [108] to develop a European network of priority sites for GDE and SGDE conservation. Given that the conservation of entire stygofaunal assemblages within aquifers is practically impossible and, in most cases, would be incompatible with socio-economic activities, identifying a network of priority sites is needed to understand long-term responses of GDEs and species to environmental changes [109]. The AQUALIFE project [110] proposed a new index for assessing priority sites of GDE biodiversity conservation based on the intrinsic conservation value of the species comprising the assemblages in each GDE site or cluster of sites. The Groundwater Biodiversity Concern (GBC) index is designed to assess the conservation value of GDE and SGDE assemblages within an aquifer by using a wide array of traits that represent different aspects of species conservation importance. The main advantage of the GBC index is its flexibility: It can be applied at any spatial scale (from single sites to an entire aquifer) and to any GDE type (e.g., springs, the hyporheic zone of streams and rivers, aquifers). To facilitate the application of the protocol, it has been fully implemented in the free software AQUALIFE available on the project website [110].\n\nSystematic conservation planning methods [111] can also help to prioritize the protection of GW biodiversity and ecosystems. It was recently demonstrated that spatial prioritization for conservation that considers connections between rivers, wetlands, and GW ecosystems is likely to produce much more efficient conservation plans than separate prioritizations for these systems [112]. It was emphasized that these efficiency gains are conditional on integration at the planning stage but major efficiency gains are also likely if rivers, wetlands, and GW ecosystems are simultaneously considered in taking local actions.\n\n2.2. Springs\n\nAs sites at which GW is exposed at the Earth’s surface, springs are abundant—highly individualistic [113], relatively self-contained, subsurface-surface linked, GW-dependent headwater wetland ecosystems that manifest high ecological, evolutionary, and socio-cultural interactivity, and which are globally threatened by human activities. With these characteristics, springs conservation is rapidly becoming a global concern. Although springs commonly emerge beneath the surface of streams, rivers, lakes, and the sea (subaqueous springs), our focus here is primarily upon terrestrial (subaerial) freshwater springs. Here, we review the derivation, distribution, typology, physical, biotic, eco-evolutionary, and socio-cultural characteristics and processes of spring ecosystems, as well as stewardship issues.\n\nGW is almost entirely derived from meteoric precipitation. Depending on the regional tectonic and hydrogeological and climate setting, GW becomes altered through the infiltration process, with the emerging spring’s water quality typically related to flowpath length (ranging from <1 to hundreds of km) and duration (ranging from 0.01 to 106 y) (e.g., [114]). In karstic (limestone) aquifers, the long-term process of GW movement enlarges complex pathways that store and facilitate GW passage. Avenues to surface expression are usually driven by gravity, but sometimes by geothermal or gaseous pressures.\n\nEstimates of springs abundance vary widely, ranging up to 50 million [115]. However, mapping of springs, even in developed countries, is incomplete and often inaccurate, and much more research is needed to better comprehend springs distribution, water production, and conservation threats. Our studies indicate that every natural stream in non-ice-dominated landscapes is sourced by springs or from lakes, many of which themselves are spring-fed [116].\n\nThe emergence environment of springs typically is where the interests of the hydrologists wane, but those of the ecologists intensify [84]. Recent attempts to classify springs have been based on physical, geographic, geochemical, geomorphological, biological, ecological, and human use variables [115,117], among which source geomorphology provides the least ambiguous typology [118,119,120,121]. Thirteen major terrestrial springs types, and several common sub-types, have been described, including cave, exposure (standing, exposed GW), fountain (artesian), geyser (geothermally or chemically driven), gushet (cliff emerging), hanging garden (seepage along a geologic contact), helocrene (floodplain and hillslope), hillslope (floodplain and upland), hypocrene (shallow subsurface flow expressed through wetland vegetation), mound-form (ice-form, chemical precipitate, and organic mounds), limnocrene (springfed pool with outflow), and rheocrene (emerging on the floor of a channel), as well as paleosprings that have not flowed in historic times [119,120]. Most GW emergence is gravity-driven, but some mineral-precipitating mound springs, geothermal, and CO2-gas driven GW flow occurs. Biological processes, such as biofilm-mediated precipitation of calcium carbonate, can influence flow emergence and the geomorphology at mineral-precipitating springs. Also, it is worth remembering that all spring types can be directly or indirectly altered or created by anthropogenic actions [120]. Several attempts have successfully distinguished within and among-taxon biological assemblage differences among springs types [84,118].\n\nSprings ecosystems often support multiple geomorphological microhabitats including cave mouths, channels, madicolous (whitewater) flow, terraces, pools, spray zones, hyporheic habitats, peripheral riparian zones, and other microhabitats [117,120]. Each microhabitat may support its own soils or other substrata and suites of species that may or may not interact with others, but in combination, create a unique microhabitat mosaic. Springs geomorphic diversity can be calculated using the Shannon–Wiener diversity metric [122] based on the number and relative area of springs-associated microhabitats. Such calculations reveal positive correlations between springs geomorphic diversity and plant species richness at springs in arid and semi-arid landscapes across western North America [123,124]. Also, diatom species richness increases with habitat complexity in near-natural Swiss springs across elevation [45].\n\nThe disproportionately high biodiversity of springs includes a high percentage of threatened Red List species (e.g., [125]), rare and new-to-science taxa (from diatoms and invertebrates, to fishes [126,127], and many least-impaired habitat relicts, i.e., species requiring high-integrity environments and surviving only in near-natural springs in areas that are otherwise detrimentally affected by human activities [40]. We estimate that >10% of federally listed animal species in the USA are springs-dependent, at least for one phase of their life cycles. Although many springs are hotspots of biodiversity [127], arid land springs in Australia, Africa, and southwestern North America are particularly noted for supporting high levels of rare, threatened [43], and springs-endemic crenobiontic biodiversity [44].\n\nEach springs ecosystem is subject to its own distinctive environmental disturbances and, depending on the source location, elevation, and aspect may have vastly different potential productivity. Interactions between disturbance and productivity (e.g., [128,129,130]), mediated by source geomorphology, springs type, regional climate, microclimate, elevation and latitude-dependent aspect, strongly control the shape, habitat area, and “hospitability” of springs to potentially colonizing biota. Thus, physical interactions strongly shape the physical geomorphological microhabitat mosaic on which the spring ecosystem develops, and springs should be regarded as “bottom-up” ecosystems [120]. Biological colonization involves both active and passive biogeographic colonization–extinction patterns, at least sometimes including assemblage nestedness (e.g., among desert springs fishes [131]). Trophic interactions in springs vary from simple systems with only a few, widespread species occurring in harsh or shaded settings, to highly productive (NAPP >5 kg·m−2·year−1) systems with remarkably complex trophic interactivity [132,133], and a significant amount of endemic species [134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141].\n\nAs a result of interactions among the above factors, shallow-aquifer springs ecosystems can be highly dynamic, changing across temporal scales of days to millennia. However, deep-aquifer/long flowpath springs can lag behind climate events by months to many (>100) years [142]. This relative ecological stability over evolutionary time permits adaptation and the evolution of complex assemblages of highly endemized taxa in harsh, constant environments, such as Montezuma Well in Arizona, Ash Meadows in Nevada, Cuatro Ciénegas in northern Mexico, Dalhousie Springs in Australia, and many other sites [120,133,137,140]. Increased incidence of spring-dependent endemism in such springs is common among aquatic invertebrates [127] but is relatively rare among vascular plants in North American, European, and Australian studies of springs. For example, there are only a few endemic, springs-dependent vascular plant species in the American Southwest, although many dozens of rare wetland plant species occur at springs. This pattern poses yet another unexplained evolutionary mystery about springs. Diatom and algae communities (e.g., [125,143]) include species that occur preferentially in springs sources (e.g., [144,145]; Figure 2C) and associated habitats, such as the peculiar desmid Oocardium stratum [146] that occurs only in springs-associated limestone deposits precipitated by petrifying springs [147]. The comprehensive study of springs diatom communities is urgently needed because of anthropogenic threats (e.g., [42]), in particular, alteration of the morphology of the springhead and increased nitrate (e.g., [148]) or orthophosphate [41] concentrations. Also, perennial, near-natural springs are stable environments that integrate indirect spatio-temporal impacts, making them invaluable natural laboratories for long-term ecological research (e.g., [149]).\n\nHuman evolution is uniquely tied to springs, as demonstrated in the paleohydrological reconstruction of the Olduvai Gorge in Kenya [150], and springs have played an important role in human history (e.g., [151,152]). Despite their value to humans, springs and the aquifers that support them are globally threatened by human activities. Springs-dependent species are among recently documented extinctions in the American Southwest (e.g., Stephan’s riffle beetle Heterelmis stephani, Pahrump killifish Empetrichthys latos, Fish Lake pyrg Pyrgulopsis ruinosa, and other species). GW pumping, livestock and other agricultural uses and pollution, mining impacts, urbanization, and the introduction of non-native species have altered most of the springs on Earth, and many marine sulfide springs now are threatened by sea-floor mining [153]. The extent of ecological impairment of springs often exceeds 70% among many landscapes in Europe, North and Central America, and Australia, and urbanization of arid regions often depletes local GW, eliminating springs altogether [40,44]. Virtually every study of spring ecosystems indicates the need for improved conservation of springs and spring-dependent species. However, the only springs currently recognized for protection by the European Union are petrifying springs [147], and national protection of springs elsewhere in the world is rare. Several conservation organizations have begun to promote improved scientific and public understanding and management of springs, including the Howard T. Odum Florida Springs Institute (floridaspringsinstitute.org) and the Museum of Northern Arizona Springs Stewardship Institute in Flagstaff (www.SpringStewardshipInstitute.org and SpringsData.org) in Florida and throughout the world, respectively. Given the great biological, cultural, and socioeconomic value of springs and the crucial role of sustainable GW for continued human existence and cultural well-being, spring ecosystems warrant far more immediate conservation attention than they have previously received.\n\nFuture basic inquiries into spring ecosystems should include mapping, inventory, and ecosystem assessment using comparable, standardized protocols; ecosystem trophic dynamics analyses on different springs types; biogeographic analyses of colonization and extinction dynamics; and improved understanding of the role of springs in relation to adjacent non-spring ecosystems and across climate variation through analysis of differential subsidy exchange [154]. In terms of applied research, far more attention should be devoted to understanding the cultural and historic significance of springs, as well as their socio-economic importance in different landscapes.\n\n3. Running Waters\n\n3.1. Headwaters\n\nWe distinguish headwater streams as those lacking perennial tributaries, which one could also refer to as “source streams” [47,155]. This separates the source streams from those that have their own tributaries in any network. According to the map-scale dependent system of stream orders [156], they may be smaller than first order streams, which are the first blue lines, for example, on a 1:50,000 topographic map. As the source streams in a network, and typically small habitats, they often provide refugia from larger-bodied predatory species. They also offer unique combinations of physical, chemical, and biological conditions from what is available in larger channels downstream [48]. Headwater streams may arise from several sources and may be a mixture of GW inputs, springs, and glacier or snowmelt, as described below (Figure 1D and Figure 2D).\n\n3.1.1. Spring-Fed Streams (Crenal)\n\nSprings can be extremely isolated (e.g., desert springs) or well connected to the surface running-water system. This connection is usually provided by spring-fed streams (e.g., [126]). Being GW fed, these streams typically have reduced fluctuations of physical and chemical factors and reduced solid transport and turbidity (Figure 1E). The diatom species Cymbella tridentina (Figure 2E) was consistently found in springs and the uppermost section of running-water systems, and thus to be typical of carbonate, high-ecological-integrity spring-fed streams [126].\n\n3.1.2. Glacial Streams (Kryal)\n\nSupraglacial meltwater channels [157] play a crucial role in transferring water and heat across and into ice. The supraglacial ecosystem is characterized by a diverse consortium of microbes (typically bacteria, algae, fungi, viruses, and occasional rotifers, tardigrades) in the supraglacial streams, and melt pools (cryoconite holes) [158].\n\nIn the high mountains, the most common origins of running-water systems are glaciers, springs, snowfields, surface runoff, and lakes [159]. Proglacial river systems, glacial or glacier-fed streams and rivers that flow from large alpine glaciers are extreme habitats (Figure 1F), in particular, because of the very high turbidity due to the fine suspended glacial debris and the very low temperatures (e.g., [160]). It has been highlighted that the disappearance of glaciers among the water supply sources leads to a significant reduction in the alpine invertebrate diversity (α-, β-, and γ-diversity; [161]) of proglacial river systems [162]. This is partly due to the fact that the turbid streams present extremely low-diversity and highly specialized invertebrate communities that also include a few endemic taxa. This situation does not seem to apply to benthic algae and cyanobacteria since the relatively few species that colonize turbid streams [163] are also found in high-altitude running waters of different origin. However, the genetic characteristics of these species and the possible presence of cryptic diversity have not been verified. Turbid streams fed by large, active glaciers are among the few aquatic habitats that seem to be only scarcely colonized by diatom microalgae, probably due to mechanical damage (i.e., scouring effect) and the extreme reduction in transparency caused by fine mineral detritus in suspension. They appear to be colonized only by very low-diversity and simplified diatom communities [163]. Gesierich and Rott (2012) [164] demonstrated an increase in the diversity of diatom communities with a decrease in the percentage of glacial coverage of the basins. Brown et al. (2018) [165] also found that predictable mechanisms govern river-invertebrate community responses to decreasing glacier cover globally (e.g., increase in functional diversity as glacier cover decreases, dispersal limitation as the dominant process underlying these patterns, environmental filtering evident in highly-glacierized basins). Most research on the biology of glacial streams focused on the relationship between species presence/absence and prevailing environmental conditions, while functional strategies and potentials of glacial stream specialists were hardly investigated so far [48]. However, distinct functional properties (e.g., feeding strategies, early life development, body mass and growth) of invertebrates that typically dominate glacier-fed streams (usually chironomids of the subfamily Diamesinae; Figure 2F) and show significant relationships with declining glacier cover in alpine stream catchments can be recognized (e.g., [166]).\n\n3.2. Streams (Rhithral)\n\nA great deal of research has focused on mid-sized streams (Figure 1G), which we define as streams beyond headwaters, i.e., second-order or larger, up to a size where they are navigable by motorized boats (see rivers below, Section 3.3.) or approximately fifth- to sixth-order. Another definition of the divide between rhithral and potamal streams would be that when they reach a size where streams are not wadeable, i.e., they are too deep, they are potamal streams.\n\nA landmark publication in stream ecology was the River Continuum Concept, which provided a coherent, if idealized, framework for how stream networks functioned [167]. This work portrayed a gradient or continuum in process rates from headwaters to downstream. The most obvious characteristics being that as stream size increased, gradients would get lower, geomorphology would become dominated by smaller materials, canopies would open relative to channel width allowing more light and primary productivity, and the relative contribution of leaf litter and other vegetation would diminish. These characterizations were extended to considerations of food webs and ecosystem metabolism. Moving from headwaters and other small streams to larger streams, the relative contributions of inputs from the catchment (i.e., leaf litter, wood, dissolved organic carbon) decrease and downstream food webs are supported by exports of particles from upstream (i.e., organic matter, invertebrates) and more local production (autochthony). These shifts result in the characteristic organization of food webs.\n\nFlowing waters create environments different from lentic waters. The force of flowing water, particularly at high flows associated with floods, can rearrange elements of stream channels, creating a range of habitat types (e.g., [168]). The relatively frequent rearrangement of channel morphology results in a dynamic ecosystem with heterogeneous features, providing niche space for hundreds of species across many taxonomic groups.\n\nThe unidirectional flow of water leads to some unique features of streams. Many stream organisms take advantage of flow to move around, particularly downstream, which is referred to as drift for animals [169] or hydrochory for plants [170]. Another consequence is that organic materials and nutrients being recycled actually create a spiral as the open water phase moves those particles downstream as they are released from organisms and then they are taken up [171]. The idea of spiraling has been important to the development of predictions in stream ecology. The movements of particles in open flow also results in a range of organisms that depend on flow to deliver food. A diverse set of species are known as filter-feeders, particularly within the caddisflies, flies (e.g., black flies, midges), mussels, and a few others [172]. In addition, a foraging style of fishes, known as drift-feeders, use flow to deliver food to them, of which trout (Figure 2G) is a well-known example [173].\n\nLakes, wetlands and reservoirs can interrupt downstream fluvial ecology through serial discontinuity [174]. This discontinuity also leads to special cases of streams, such as lake outlet streams (also applicable to reservoir outflows), where large densities of filter feeders can capitalize on high densities of high-quality plankton and often on higher concentrations of suspended organic matter caused by high densities of some fish [175,176,177].\n\nFood webs of streams often are highly heterotrophic, but in recent decades, the significance of primary production has once again been recognized, even in the smallest of streams. A typical view of a stream network portrays small streams as dependent on particulate organic matter, such as leaf litter, seeds, wood and more, and this material is processed and exported as a range of particle sizes to downstream environments.\n\nA general conclusion about the relation between stream size and species richness is that species richness increases with stream size, a pattern often attributed to a greater diversity of habitat types, and this pattern often peaks at intermediate stream order. Surveys often have shown a positive, and sometimes asymptotic pattern in species richness across a gradient of stream sizes (e.g., [178]). Heino et al. (2005) [179] found positive relations for macroinvertebrates, fish, and bryophytes across a large stream gradient in Finland, even though slopes were not the same. A systematic review of patterns in fish and macroinvertebrate richness through stream-size gradients taken from 165 studies across first- to eighth-order streams generally showed positive relations, but not always [180]. In some large datasets, they found that species richness increased from lower to intermediate-sized streams, then declined in the largest of streams, i.e., seventh- to eighth-order [180]. The range of explanations for this often-positive pattern, including larger habitat area and complexity, habitat stability or variability, and a greater range of trophic resources, demonstrate the difficulty in testing for responsible mechanisms [180].\n\nRunning waters are all vulnerable to anthropogenic use and alteration. Exploitation and contamination of GW and its subsequent impacts on springs and headwaters have been addressed in other articles in this series (e.g., [42,46]). Many of the same threats affect streams across the size spectrum (see Conservation Issues under Section 3.3).\n\n3.3. Large Rivers (Potamal)\n\nThere is no simple definition of the size of stream that we call large; however, a list of the 139 largest rivers of the world on Wikipedia all have annual mean discharges of >2000 m3/s average annual discharge. Another definition would be streams with catchments of ≥10,000 km2 [181]. Large streams (rivers) (Figure 1H,I) are difficult systems to study due to their large size, lack of replication, and reliance on specialized sampling gear [182]. Their geomorphology depends on parent rock geology and the amounts and sizes of substrates available to rework, and the characteristic flows that reshape morphology [183]. Large streams typically have low gradients with fine sediments, but there are many exceptions to this with steeper gradients and boulder substrates. Another generalization is that larger streams tend to be naturally turbid, carrying suspended sediments eroded from upstream.\n\nDownstream, rivers are often bounded by estuaries, which create a highly biodiverse transition zone or ecotone that combines features of freshwater and sea. Floodplains (alluvial) that are typically inundated seasonally along large streams can provide important habitats to freshwater species, e.g., the floodplains of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers. The energy expended by moving water can create meanders and braiding that can subsequently create oxbows (see Section 4.3), as channel avulsions occur and cut off some meanders (e.g., [183]).\n\nLarge stream food webs are typically considered as dependent on the transport of fine organic materials from their catchments, and their turbidity and light attenuation by depth limiting of primary production (e.g., [167]). However, some rivers can support plankton species, including phytoplankton, in their slower-moving sections (e.g., [184]). A combination of inputs from upstream, shoreline inputs, and autochthony provide for the energetic basis of potamal food webs (Figure 2H,I).\n\nThere is a large variety of species in large streams, especially larger-bodied species such as sturgeons (Figure 2I), paddlefish, crocodiles and caimans, freshwater dolphins, and others. Many of these large and charismatic species are seriously endangered due to heavy use of rivers by humans (e.g., [185]). In fact, large freshwater megafauna (body mass >30 kg) have declined by 88% between 1970 and 2012, which is twice the loss rate of vertebrate populations on land or in the ocean [186]. Freshwater dolphins, turtles, hippos, and large fish species such as sturgeon and paddlefish, are particularly vulnerable. Current threats to the remaining megafauna are primarily overexploitation and the loss of free-flowing large rivers.\n\nThe biodiversity patterns of these larger river systems are frequently known in terms of commercially important fish (e.g., salmon, eels, smelt) and other charismatic species, but often the other species are less well known. Fish diversity is highest in tropical river basins, especially the Amazon, Congo, Mekong, Paraná, and Orinoco, each with over 500 species of freshwater fishes (BioFresh website: http://www.freshwaterplatform.eu/). Likewise, freshwater mammal diversity is highest in these five basins. For freshwater crayfish, the highest diversity in the world is found in the Mississippi River catchment, with well over 100 species. In contrast, two of the largest rivers in Europe, the Danube (Figure 1H) and the Volga, have only about 67 to 75 native freshwater fish species in their entire catchments [187]. Most groups of freshwater organisms reach their highest species richness in tropical regions, but a large fraction of diversity in flowing waters remains unknown. This lack of information concerns especially bacteria, algae, and many groups of invertebrates.\n\nMost large and medium-sized rivers have been anthropogenically altered or impaired [2,188]. They are harnessed for hydroelectric power production, used as transportation corridors, diked to protect infrastructure, and drained for irrigation. There are over 57,000 large (>15 m) dams and over 300 megadams (>150 m) worldwide (International Rivers Network web page). Additional 3700 large dams are planned or under construction. More than 800 of these planned dams are located in the diversity hotspots of freshwater megafauna, including Amazon, Congo, Mekong, and Ganges basins.\n\nConservation issues resulting from cumulative effects of dams involve declines in native freshwater biodiversity at regional scales. Many large rivers have been transformed into a series of reservoirs (dominated by introduced exotic species) connected by highly regulated flows that contain remnant populations of native riverine species. For example, of the 51.2 million km of streams in the lower 48 USA states, only 2% of the rivers remain free-flowing and are relatively undeveloped. Only 42 free-flowing rivers exist that are more than 200 km or more in length. The other 98% of USA streams have been developed [189].\n\nThe natural seasonal variability in discharge of these heavily dammed rivers has been significantly reduced, interfering with the life cycle of native freshwater organisms that are adapted to different flow regimes. Regional effects of dams in North America include extirpation/extinction of (1) native migratory taxa (salmonids, sturgeons), (2) small bodied-obligate riverine taxa (darters), (3) flood-dependent taxa, and (4) taxa dependent on freshwater inflows to estuarine habitats (e.g., delta smelt) [189]. There also have been regional increases in lentic exotic taxa, which now abound in many reservoirs and regulated reaches [189].\n\nCumulative impacts of dams exert other landscape-scale effects on biodiversity through (1) greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs, (2) methylmercury mobilization and bioaccumulation in aquatic foodwebs, and (3) reduced transport of sediments and silica to coastal waters [190]. All reservoirs emit greenhouse gases for a minimum of decades and contribute significantly to climate change. The fuel for these greenhouse gases is rotting organic matter from vegetation and soils flooded when the reservoir is filled. Anaerobic sediments in reservoirs also contribute to the mobilization of methylmercury into freshwater food webs. All water bodies in the northern hemisphere are contaminated with mercury which biomagnifies within freshwater food webs, resulting in toxic effects on fish-eating wildlife and human fish consumption advisories for reservoirs throughout parts of the US (https://www.epa.gov/). Finally, the retention of sediment and silica in reservoirs behind dams results in sediment-starved beaches and reductions of silica that can discourage silicate-using diatoms and favor nuisance cyanobacteria [190].\n\nCumulative effects of irrigation on river ecosystems are also of great conservation concern in many regions across the globe. About 70% of the water that is abstracted from freshwater systems is used for irrigation, and irrigated areas are expected to increase rapidly due to population growth and an increase in food demands [190]. Under current conditions, 30% of irrigated crop production compromises environmental flow requirements in streams and rivers [190]. Rivers and associated wetlands in arid areas are becoming increasingly degraded and contaminated from irrigation return flow with severe negative effects on freshwater biota and associated wildlife.\n\nStewardship of large rivers has increasingly involved changing dam management criteria and strategies to improve flow regimes in rivers [191]. In many developed countries, the removal of obsolete dams is increasing. In 2018, eighty-two dams were removed across eighteen states within the USA (with 35 in CA). In 2019, the largest dam removal project in Europe began on the Selune River (Brussels) with the 36 m-high Vezins Dam.\n\nCountries around the globe differ in their stewardship approaches to protect rivers and streams (e.g., [9]). As just one example, non-governmental organizations (e.g., American Rivers, Washington, DC, USA; Pacific Rivers Council, Portland, OR, USA; the Nature Conservancy, Arlington, VA, USA) in the US play a central role in the development of river conservation for natural values, ranging from developing conceptual paradigms to both collaborating with and litigating against government agencies. This is in contrast to other countries such as the UK, where strong stewardship is more centralized and characterized by relatively less NGO activity [192].\n\nIn some countries, such as Bangladesh, the case has been made that rivers should have their own rights. The first country to grant a specific river legal rights was New Zealand in 2017, followed by the Indian state of Uttarakhand. In July 2019, Bangladesh became the first country to grant all of its rivers the same legal status as humans. This landmark ruling by the Bangladeshi Supreme court is meant to protect the world’s largest delta from further pollution. Anybody accused of harming the rivers can be taken to court by the new government appointed National River Conservation Commission.\n\nInternational NGOs are playing an increasingly important role in river stewardship across the globe. As just one example, International Rivers (https://www.internationalrivers.org/) protects rivers by empowering the public, stopping destructive projects (often dams) and addressing legacies, raising public awareness, and promoting sustainable alternatives/solutions.\n\n4. Lakes\n\n4.1. Ancient and Large Lakes\n\nGlobally, there are 253 freshwater lakes with a surface area >500 km2 and over 75 lakes with a maximum depth >100 m [193]. Out of the 14 largest lakes worldwide, five are ancient lakes. Others, like the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America, are relatively young, and their species assemblages are mainly composed of postglacial colonists [194]. Nevertheless, some endemic species are also known from postglacial large lakes (e.g., the Lake Garda (Figure 1L) salmonid fish Salmo carpio; [195], Figure 2L). Moreover, many large lakes are oligotrophic habitats which are frequently species rich (e.g., [196]). In North America, nearly 500 diatom species were found in a sample of bryophytes from deep waters of Lake Superior (Figure 1K) [197].\n\nThe term “ancient lake” is applied to any lake that existed across the last glacial cycle, >130,000 y [198]. Most lakes around the globe are younger than 10,000 y (post-glacial origin), and only a few have survived more than 100 ka [199]. Ancient lakes are considered paleorefugia (sensu [200]), qualitatively differing from younger (post-glacial) lakes because they hold relatively higher proportions of endemic species [201]. High diversity and endemism can be observed across almost all eukaryotic groups in most, if not in all, ancient lakes [202]. However, the level of endemism and diversity varies among lakes. There are many well-documented examples across biological groups (from diatoms to fish) of endemism in ancient lakes [203,204,205]. The success of endemism with elevated species diversity can be attributed to the long-term persistence and ecological stability of ancient lakes. However, all global environments are subjected to stress events including catastrophic events. For example, lakes Tanganyika, Malawi, and Victoria experienced episodes of megadroughts [206], with some evidence of complete desiccation [207]. Also, Lake Titicaca in South America went through drought and salinization during the Marine Isotope Stage (124,000–119,000 years ago) that caused significant changes in diatom species composition [208].\n\nMost ancient lakes originate from shifting tectonic plates (tectonic graben or tectonic uplift, also called drift valleys) or impact craters which fill with the long-term storage of water [198]. The retention time of water in ancient lakes can vary from 49 to 5500 years (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_retention_time). Thus, the scale of impact (millennia+) will dictate a climate driver of major change with finer levels of change under local physical, chemical, and biological pressures (e.g., decadal to centuries) [209]. Trapped waterbodies with continuous atmospheric and riverine water inputs, coupled with evapotranspiration, will naturally concentrate ions. Unless other environmental stressors (override) the system (e.g., flooding events), lakes will naturally become more brackish. Lakes Titicaca and Hövsgöl are examples of waters with ionic salt accumulation [208,210]. Less abundant metals (including heavy metals) can also accumulate in ancient lakes when local geology provides erosional material. Lake Matano (Indonesia, Figure 1AE) has metal accumulation (e.g., iron) under these circumstances [211,212]. In contrast, Lake Baikal (Figure 1J) has not shown clear increases in ions and metals [213]. The volume of water (including surface area to volume ratios), lake water retention, surface flow, and northern location have buffered Lake Baikal from detectable changes over centuries [213]. The African rift lakes from Lake Malawi to Lake Victoria show a wide gradient of ion and metal accumulation (Lake Tanganyika with high conductivity to Lake Victoria with low conductivity), demonstrating both age and differentiated environmental selecting factors. Talling and Talling [214] even classified the African lakes into three classes according to total ionic concentrations. The aforementioned chain of rift lakes in Africa shows that regional climate, along with physical and chemical factors, can have a totalistic impact on ancient lakes.\n\nTwo types of ancient lakes can be distinguished: (i) lakes that did not undergo major catastrophic events during their history, and (ii) lakes that sustained major catastrophic events in relatively recent geologic time. Both types may contain lakes with a high level of biodiversity and endemism; however, these lakes evolved and function biologically differently. Species radiations can occur in both lake types but (i) mainly include taxon points of dispersal while (ii) act predominantly as taxon refugia. Extinctions caused by some catastrophic events create new ecological opportunities for colonization by alternative species changing the evolutionary path of the lake. The ultimate question is how important are these lakes in stabilizing regional and global diversity, i.e., are the lakes species sinks (refugia) or species sources (dispersal centers)?\n\nOne of the prominent features of ancient lakes is “species flocks” or closely related species that evolve sympatrically and coexist [215]. Species flocks have been documented in many groups, including invertebrates [216], fish [215,217], and photosynthetic organisms like diatoms [218]. These flocks are characterized by elevated species richness, shared origins, high levels of endemicity, and restricted geographic occurrence [219]. The most prominent hypothesis suggests that flock diversity is the result of long-term lacustrine speciation events after the colonization of ancestor species. However, the initial colonization of species may have happened at various times in a lake basin’s history, including early phases of lake formation, or after desiccation events and drainage reversals. One of the main trigger factors for intra-lacustrine speciation is the availability of empty niches, which happen after limnological changes or extinction of existing species. In both cases, stochastic factors force the evolution of novel traits, allowing organisms to exploit new niches. It is significant that temporal changes in the environment typically do not catastrophically impact the biotic community, but may alter the direction of taxa radiations. A consistent and interesting phenomenon in ancient lakes is higher endemism in littoral microhabitats [199]. Further, in most cases, littoral taxa are also intra-lacustrine (neo-) endemics, while species living in deeper parts of the lake share morphological characters and are even genetically more closely related to ancestor species (relicto-endemic). There are few examples of total extinction events in ancient lakes [202].\n\nHere, we briefly address the organisms of ancient-lake biota. Although bacteria play an important biological function in aquatic systems, little is known about bacteria in ancient lakes. Lakes Vostok and Vida are permanently covered (ice-block lakes) in Antarctica with microbial-driven communities [220,221]. Lake Vostok has been isolated for at least 420,000 years [222]. Accretion ice in Lake Vostok contains thousands of unique gene sequences, at least half with taxonomic classifications to genus and/or species [220]. The autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial communities originate from regional inputs representing aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, acidophilic, and desiccation-resistant life forms [220]. Tropical Lake Matano (Figure 1AE) also sustains a significant presence of limnetic and benthic bacteria drivers [212]. Within sulfur-poor, iron-rich waters of Lake Matano, anoxic phototrophic green sulfur bacteria are prominent. The predominance of green sulfur bacteria in marine ecosystems would suggest that taxa in the freshwaters of Lake Matano are genetically different, with possible endemic species. Diatoms are an extremely diverse eukaryotic group of organisms in ancient lakes (Figure 2J) (e.g., [223]). In particular, the benthic communities show extraordinary diversity. One of the most diverse diatom genera in ancient lakes is Surirella Turpin (including Iconella Jurilj) with many endemic species [223] and/or species flocks [205]. It is also evident that more basal “primitive” organisms have higher percentages of endemism. For instance, triclads (Order: Tricladida) are diverse in Lake Baikal with 74 species recorded, and almost 100% are endemic [218]. Nematodes are species rich and characterized with high levels of endemism in Lake Baikal [224]. Oligochaetes are common in the benthos and have been well studied in ancient lakes. Gastropods are one group characterized by the highest diversity and endemism in ancient lakes. According to Strong et al. [225], the gastropod fauna from continental waters comprises ca. 4000 species and ancient lakes are considered hotspots of diversity. Crustaceans abound in lakes, and for example, Amphipoda is a diverse group in Lake Baikal, with 257 species and 74 subspecies [226]. Such a large diversity is influenced by many factors including habitat partitioning by depth, trophic differentiation, and differentiation by season of reproduction (allopatric) differentiation. The ostracod fauna in ancient lakes is very diverse and comprise about 20% of known species worldwide [227]. Freshwater sponges are much younger in origin (48–40 Mya) compared to marine species (500+ Mya) [97,228]. Morphologic and phylogenetic analysis of 25 freshwater sponge taxa from Sulawesi (Indonesia), Siberia (Russia), and South-East Europe show frequent and independent origins of species endemism to different freshwater systems through cosmopolitan founder species [229]. Possible founder species (e.g., Ephydatia spp. and Trochospongilla spp.) are freshwater taxa with cosmopolitan and neotropical origins. Fish have been the most studied in ancient lakes. From sculpins to sailfins and cichlids, endemism and radiation studies have consistently demonstrated the importance of sexual selection, body form, and niche breath within lake ecosystems. The largest and most significant ancient lake for fisheries (gross domestic product, GDP) is Lake Baikal [230]. The biological impact of fisheries (selected fish removal) on this ancient lake is likely not significant, due to the size and location of the lake, although we have no information to support this observation. Lake Baikal has 52–60 species mainly native and endemic. Endemic species flocks are observed in the sculpins (Cottidae, Comephoridae, and Abyssocottidae) [231]. The most economically important species is Omul (Salmonidae: Coregonus migratorius), the symbol of Lake Baikal since time immemorial. Sailfins (Telmatherinidae) have demonstrated the greatest levels of endemism and species radiations in the Indonesian Malili lakes (Figure 2K) [232,233]. The unique fish fauna of the African rift lakes has been recognized for more than 120 years with ca.1800 species in the five most species-rich lakes [234]. There are no cichlid species occupying more than one African Great lake [235,236].\n\nClassic ecological principles can be used to study lake ecosystem services and functions. For example, Salzburger et al. [219] report that macroecological principles can be applied to ecological patterns found in the African Great Lakes; these functions include (i) taxonomic diversity tends to increase with area of the lake, (ii) more ecological niches allow greater taxonomic diversity, and (iii) the degree of ecosystem stability determines the periods during which adaptation can occur. However, these principles are interconnected and depend on the global location and structural morphology of the lake. Larger lakes have greater habitat diversity, are more stable and have larger resistance and resilience to disturbances [237]. Still, there are examples where large lakes such as Titicaca and Kivu have low levels of species richness and endemism [208,238]. Restricted endemism might be explained by unstable environmental conditions (physical and chemical) that are unfavorable for diverse floras and faunas. Further, poor seed populations at the origin of lake formation might provide a biotic explanation of why some lakes have low endemism.\n\nLitoral zones are the nexus of human interactions with lakes and are often highly modified for diverse human uses [194,239]. However, littoral processes are poorly integrated into the understanding of lakes’ ecosystem functions (e.g., [240]).\n\nAncient and large lakes have societal and economic importance linked to drinking-water supply, commercial fisheries, subsistence fisheries, international shipping, recreation, and waste disposal [194,241]. However, they are sustaining an onslaught of anthropogenic impacts leading to the extinction of endemic species [198]. Eutrophication threatens native species and economies reliant on clean water, fisheries, and tourism [198]. However, these economies are potentially destroying the ecosystem services and biological significance of ancient lake resources. Lake Ohrid suffers from increasing anthropogenic pressure and a biodiversity crisis [242], while Lake Biwa is the best example of anthropogenic eutrophication with massive cyanobacteria blooms [243]. In another example, Lake Victoria has experienced eutrophication since the mid-1980s [244,245]. Eutrophication has also been reported in lakes Baikal, Matano, Poso, and Titicaca, although these reports are localized events in selected regions of the lakes [246,247]. Commercial fisheries are also affected. The catch for Lake Tanganyika for 1995 was estimated at 178,700 million tons (http://www.fao.org/fi/oldsite/ltr/fish.htm). Over one million people are dependent on the Lake Tanganyika fisheries. A major ten-fold decline in catch per-unit-unit-effort (CPUE) has been recorded 1983–1993 within Burundi waters (http://www.fao.org/fi/oldsite/ltr/fish.htm). Although climate warming has been cited [248] as a significant factor, anthropogenic fishing pressures are clearly having an impact; the ultimate impact on ecosystem services for Lake Tanganyika is yet to be realized. Invasive species have become a problem over the last 50 years in many ancient lakes (e.g., [249]). The introduction of rainbow trout and silversides in the 1950s (Odontesthes bonariensi) into Lake Titicaca has induced the extinction of Oestias cuveri [250]. Likewise, massive destruction of African rift lake fisheries resulted from the introduction of invasive fish [251]. The introduction of cichlids and carp into lakes Matano and Poso (Indonesia) through small-scale fish farming has altered the littoral zone composition of boned fish [252].\n\nHydrological alterations, including those produced through climate change, have altered lake flows, levels and niche habitats [198]. Newly constructed dams (projected massive development globally) will have significant impacts on lake ecosystem services into the next century. Lake Biwa has strict annual water level control, lower than high water level (−0.2 m) during the flooding season and higher than the high-water level (0.3 m) during the dry season. It is not clear how water-level control impacts native and endemic species, but it would be expected that a reduction in the number of stress events would affect niche habitats and natural speciation. Lake Victoria has two hydroelectric dams controlling the outflow into the Nile River. With the alteration of the natural outflow weir in 1952, discharge rates were set to mimic historical discharge levels [253]. However, since 2002, discharge levels have increased and Lake Victoria water levels have reached historically low levels [254,255]. Lower water levels, in part, will contribute to the eutrophication of water impoundments, including ancient lakes.\n\n4.2. High-Mountain Lakes\n\nClimate change affects glacial masses and the lakes dependent on them. Reduction and disintegration of ice impact epi- and periglacial lakes directly. Sometimes, changes in glacial mass result in sudden, catastrophic events. Surprisingly, relatively-high surface temperatures could be found even in proglacial lakes, which turned out to be discontinuous cold polymictic rather than dimictic as the typical clear alpine lakes [256]. In general, highly simplified food webs are characteristic of lakes fed by glacial meltwaters, though specific habitats are present. Climate change and glacier retreat can rapidly shift turbid periglacial lakes towards a clear-state, high-alpine lake type, with loss of the typical features of periglacial lakes. Conversely, the retreat of large glaciers will also form new glacially-fed lakes but whether this will buffer the mentioned habitat and biodiversity loss remains unclear [257].\n\nNon-glacial alpine lakes are likely among the most comparable ecosystems across the world but the largest contrast occurs between lakes in temperate (Figure 1M,N) and tropical areas with a water-column structure based on the temperature in temperate lakes, and oxygen in tropical lakes [258]. They provide important ecosystem services ranging from the supply of resources (in particular water for various uses) to tourism and recreation.\n\nThe lake basins located above the tree line are often still poorly known environments [259] that can harbor organisms of particular interest (Figure 2M,N). A few mountain lakes are large and ancient, and host endemic species (e.g., the graben Lakes Tahoe in the USA and Hövsgöl in Mongolia; [260]). However, isolated, small post-glacial lakes can also be inhabited by populations that have interesting local genotypes. The phytoplankton of high-mountain lakes is typically dominated, both qualitatively and qualitatively, by flagellate algae (in particular, Chrysophyceae; [261]). A high genetic diversity, far beyond what is described from high-mountain lake plankton, was recorded in high-mountain lakes in the European Alps and the Himalayan mountains [262]. Mixotrophic algae usually dominate the planktic community under P-deficit and are the main factor controlling bacterioplankton [263]. Depth variation in benthic communities can be substantial and must be considered in monitoring programs and biodiversity inventories and comparisons, as was shown, e.g., for ancient mountain lake benthic invertebrate communities [260], and small, postglacial, mountain lake cyanobacteria and algal pigments [264].\n\nSeveral high-mountain lakes are remote environments that are relatively far from centers of human activity and potentially subject only to broad-scale environmental changes and diffuse pollution. This kind of high-mountain lakes has thus received an important role as indicators of climate change in recent decades [265]. On the contrary, other high-altitude lakes suffer from a series of direct anthropogenic impacts. According to Catalan et al. (1993) [266], these impacts include grazing, tourism, the introduction of non-native fish species, changes to the shoreline and the basin for exploitation for hydroelectric purposes. Although this latter type of impact affects a large number of lakes in the Italian Alps, its effects on hydrochemistry and biota are still poorly known globally [267].\n\nThe introduction of non-native fishes has been recognized to be one of the main impacts on high-mountain lakes both in Europe [259,268] and in North America [269]. Most or all small high-mountain lakes were probably fishless but have been extensively stocked with domestic fish species. This was in some cases favored by the belief that some species might be native, such as the alpine charr considered a glacial relict in the Alps [268]. Especially in natural preserves, some essential conservation measures (e.g., fish-stocking ban, and protection against eutrophication) have already been taken, but efforts to restore invaded lakes through fish eradication might be necessary [259].\n\nOn holocrystalline substrates (e.g., granites) and microcrystalline substrates (e.g., porphyries), lakes with minimally-mineralized waters with alkalinity <50 µeq L−1 are relatively common (Figure 1M), and are exposed to the effects of airborne pollutants, especially acid substances [270]. The lakes with extremely low alkalinity (sentinel environments, e.g., [258]) also offer an important long-term monitoring opportunity, as they are particularly sensitive to direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts. Climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in alkalinity due to changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation that, combined with a general increase in air temperature, lead to greater weathering in the catchment, a decrease in snow cover, and an increase in the leaching of the basin [271]. It is also possible to predict a decrease in the period of ice cover and an increase in primary production. Thies et al. (2007) [272] not only observed a substantial rise in solute concentration at two remote high mountain lakes in catchments of metamorphic rocks in the European Alps but also an unexpectedly high nickel concentration increase, and attributed these changes to solute release from the ice of an active rock glacier in the catchment as a response to climate warming. Mountain lakes are among the lakes warming the fastest: Warmer temperatures favor different species and assemblages, and greater primary production [269].\n\nAfter decades of exploitation for hydroelectric purposes in recent decades, water from high-altitude lakes is now often considered with renewed interest for the production of artificial snow [273]. Climate change, resulting in an increase in temperatures and a decrease in snowfall, potentially leads to an increase in withdrawals for snow production, which changes water storage and water levels. This impact also alters the lake morphology and the induced, pronounced water-level fluctuations result in the emergence of a large part of the littoral [274]. The most common alternative to these water withdrawals is the construction from scratch of artificial reservoirs for artificial snow production. From a limnological point of view, these newly-formed environments, often located on carbonate mountains where other surface water bodies at high altitude are rare due to karst phenomena, can represent an interesting opportunity as a summer habitat for rapidly developing aquatic species with resistance forms and as reproduction sites for amphibians. For these artificial basins to perform these functions, it is important to adopt naturalistic engineering criteria in their realization, with particular attention to slope and structure of the banks (Cantonati, unpublished).\n\nIn the face of increasing rates of the exploitation of water, it is essential to protect significant numbers of high-altitude lakes in natural and semi-natural conditions. An important element in favor of their conservation could be represented by the fact that many of these lakes are included in Natural Parks (e.g., [259,274]). The illustrious ecologist Ramon Margalef wrote in 1983 [275] (translated from Spanish): “Against these threats, it is worthwhile to move in favor of the conservation of mountain lakes. Many of these are located in protected areas or parks, one more reason not to sacrifice them for hydroelectric interests”.\n\n4.3. Oxbow Lakes\n\nOxbow lakes include lowland fluvial stagnant lakes, generally shallow and isolated from parent rivers (Figure 1O). They are typical of floodplains and take origin from channel shifting and associated geomorphic processes (e.g., braiding, erosion), namely, when a river bend—called meander—gets cut off, thus creating a water body that remains adjacent to their parent river [276,277]. Indeed, the rivers that flow across wide river valleys and snake across flat plains tend to create menders that slowly evolve and give rise to complex oxbow lake systems.\n\nDue to their pivotal contribution in modulating alluvial behavior, the oxbow lakes are generally acknowledged as one of the most distinctive landforms of floodplains [278]. For instance, the presence of an oxbow lake largely improves the topographic, hydrological, and habitat diversity of river valleys [279]. Oxbow lakes rely on periodic flooding events or local rainfall and, over time, can turn into wetlands, and then into terrestrial ecosystems. Specifically, their transition rates towards terrestrial habitat are regulated by the intensity of sedimentation processes [280]. These lakes are typically connected to parent rivers during extreme floods, but the frequency, duration, and timing of the reconnection vary according to river stage, riverbank elevation, and the presence of a direct channel between the oxbow lake and river [281]. Often, they ultimately dry up in a few decades after having been cut off from the main river channel.\n\nBoth the peculiar origin of oxbow lakes and their specific hydrological regime make them dynamic, biologically diverse as well as extremely sensitive ecosystems. Several papers have clarified the key role of oxbow lakes in supporting the phyto- and zooplankton assemblages in river valleys and main streams [282]. They also are fundamental for the conservation and reproduction of fish, as they guarantee feeding and breeding habitats for many different species, and act as refugia during extreme flood events [283]. Zeug and Winemiller (2007) [284] found that the oxbow lakes held greater juvenile abundances of most fish taxa relative to the main river channel and were particularly important for the typically nest-building species. Nevertheless, their observations suggested the existence of a combined positive effect of both hydrology and habitat heterogeneity in providing optimal conditions for fish recruitment. Similarly, Bolpagni and Piotti (2015, 2016) [285,286] confirmed the pivotal contribution of riverine natural lentic sites, including oxbow lakes, to preserve high values of heterogeneity (expressed in terms of physical complexity of water bodies) and vegetation diversity (plant communities per site) in heavily exploited floodplains. This reinforces the clear dependence of aquatic plant communities on aquatic ecosystem origin, thereby confirming the intimate relationships between heterogeneity and vegetation diversity and, therefore, with the inter- and intra-annual hydrological cycles of water bodies colonized.\n\nOxbow lakes tend to be largely colonized by macrophytes that can act as engineer species [287]. During the growing season, the development of dense stands of submerged or free-floating plant species as Vallisneria spiralis or Trapa natans (Figure 2O) exerts a strong influence on water and sediment chemistry. In presence of pleustophytes, like Spirodela polyrhiza or Lemnaceae, frequent anoxia events can be recorded during warmest months due to the exhaustion of sediment geochemical buffers (i.e., ferric iron pool) and the associated release of nutrients (NH4+ and PO43− to the water column [288]. These processes do no more than increase the availability of nutrients in the water column, boosting the hypertrophic status of the ecosystem and stressing the relevance of trophic disservices mediated by anoxia events in aquatic ecosystems. In this context, the water level variations induced by human activities deeply affect the physical and chemical features of oxbow lakes with huge cascading effects on biota. Disturbed water regimes largely depress organisms with a full aquatic life cycle (phyto- and zooplankton, fish), whereas the biodiversity of unstable oxbow lakes (i.e., those with most marked water level variations) decreased along with increasing isolation from the river. In riverine contexts, long dry phases induced, for example, by excessive exploitation of water resources or by local effects of climate change, can stimulate the spread of terrestrial species in ecotonal and aquatic sectors of oxbow lakes [289].\n\nAccordingly, hydrology completely controls the survival time of oxbow lakes, making them extremely vulnerable to human actions, stressing the key relevance of isolation, damming, and agricultural practices in driving oxbow dynamic trajectories. This has significant implications for the benthic and aquatic metabolism of oxbow lakes. Indeed, the denitrification efficiency was higher in connected oxbow lakes than isolated ones [290]. On the other hand, oxbow lakes play a relevant role in modulating the river C budget as a function of season and hydrology [291].\n\nThe increasing interest in levee construction, as well as in snagging, dredging and wing dike construction to control flood events and restrict meandering have essentially impaired the natural river processes [292]. As a result, riverine aquatic ecosystems are not being newly created, at least not at historical rates. This calls for urgent actions to maintain and restore existing oxbow lakes, particularly as the above-mentioned processes appear to be irreversible, or are not expected to be effectively counteracted in the short term [293].\n\nIn summary, river valleys and floodplains have been strongly modified by human activities such as channelization, water regulations, and land reclamation and use change. All this translates into inadequate conservation status for oxbow lakes, despite their major contribution to a myriad of species as well as to fundamental ecological processes [294]. The challenge of efficient functional restoration depends not only on improving hydraulic connectivity of riverine wetlands—in order to maintain important biogeochemical functions such as nitrogen removal via denitrification—but also through providing a mosaic of diverse habitats aiming to support the widest range of species possible.\n\n5. Man-Made Freshwater Habitats\n\n5.1. Reservoirs\n\nFreshwater reservoirs are artificial water bodies (Figure 1P,Q) of particular interest as they provide various ecosystem services such as the supply of drinking water, irrigation, transportation, industrial and cooling water supplies, power generation, flood control, or recreation. The purpose of the reservoir often strongly influences the hydrological regime within the reservoir. At the same time, reservoirs have a significant environmental impact since their dams disrupt the ecological connectivity of rivers, whereas reservoirs’ water storage and release patterns affect the quantity, quality, and timing of downstream flows [295]. Reservoirs differ from natural lakes in several important aspects, particularly the very common canyon-shaped reservoirs, constructed by damming a river valley and representing a transition between lotic and lentic systems [296]. Compared to natural lakes, these reservoirs have elongated morphology, shorter water residence time, pronounced water-level fluctuations and irregular water withdrawal, which can be realized from various strata [297].\n\nMajor threats to biodiversity in reservoirs can be grouped under several interacting categories: overexploitation; habitat degradation through disappearance of the littoral zone due to water level fluctuation; water pollution, including processes such as eutrophication or acidification; inappropriate management practices (e.g., fish overstocking); climate change and subsequent shifts in mixing regime, changes in precipitation and runoff patterns, wind speed, invasion by non-indigenous species, and more. Pronounced fluctuations in reservoir water level impair the development of structured macrophyte vegetation, which fulfills the vital functions in the littoral zone. Such altered hydrology has no correspondence in natural freshwater systems, as few plant species have adaptations to their specific aspects [298]. For example, the rooted submerged plants face both physiological and physical constraints because of the shifts between submergence and drainages, wave actions, ice scours, sediment erosion, and more [299,300,301]. Alterations of macrophyte communities (Figure 2P) lead to a decrease of habitat structural complexity and significant losses of the diversity of other associated organisms in the littoral zone of reservoirs (e.g., [302,303,304,305]), and have the potential to change biogeochemical processes in the whole reservoir ecosystem.\n\nIncreased discharge of domestic wastewaters and non-point pollution from agricultural practices and urban development have recently led to excessive nutrient loading into SWs and is considered to be one of the major driving forces of reservoir eutrophication [306,307,308]. Eutrophication effects on elongated reservoirs can be highly variable spatially as gradients from hyper- to oligotrophy can establish across the inflow-transition-lacustrine parts of the water body. Nutrient enrichment affects competition for light among aquatic macrophytes as well as between the macrophytes and either epiphytic and/or planktonic algae [309,310]. Initially, macrophytes are lost from the deepest and near tributary parts; as the process gets worse, all submerged plants are eventually lost from the reservoir, which becomes dominated by phytoplankton, often experiencing cyanobacterial or algal blooms. Nowadays, harmful (toxic, food-web altering, hypoxia generating) phytoplankton blooms recurrently threaten the ecological integrity and sustainability of many eutrophicated reservoirs [311].\n\nThe absence of zooplankton due to the excessive predation of planktivorous fish has been widely recognized to contribute to cyanobacterial bloom formation (top-down effect). In most Eurasian meso-eutrophic reservoirs, fish assemblages are dominated by planktivorous cyprinids like common bream (Abramis brama), roach (Rutilus rutilus), bleak (Alburnus alburnus) and white bream (Blicca bjoerkna) [312], due to their efficient foraging in the turbid (algal-dominated) and food-limited conditions [313], and high abilities to escape predators [314]. In spite of clearly the highest biomass and productivity, these cyprinid-dominated systems are not considered to be valuable from the view of biotic integrity and rather they are classified as an indicator of degraded conditions [315]. Nevertheless, the superdominant cyprinid fish could be eliminated by drying their very-shallow-laid eggs even during controlled low-range water-level fluctuation (on tenths of cm per day). Then, percids (Figure 2Q) may become dominant species in some eutrophicated lowland cascade reservoirs [316]. Interestingly, cascade reservoirs were found partly to support salmonid fish which are otherwise very scarce in lowland reservoirs. The low-range water-level fluctuation or stable water level may further increase the fish diversity since the growth of submerged macrophytes is not prevented and assemblages of strictly phytophilous fish, like pike (Esox Lucius) and tench (Tinca tinca), can fully develop. In bankside reservoirs, the pump storage water bodies with concrete or asphalt banks and relatively frequent water-level fluctuation, macrophyte growth and related cyprinid fish reproduction are prevented [317]. Like with cascade reservoirs, bankside reservoirs have less fish production but may be important hotspots of fish biodiversity in lowland nutrient-rich systems.\n\nReservoirs can maintain characteristic biological assemblages, but often feature novel combinations of native and introduced species. Introduced species become established, naturalized or invasive, but it is often not clear whether they have negative effects on native biota that might also be present or, alternatively, occupy niches that have been left empty due to the original habitat modification in reservoirs [318,319,320]. Obviously, invasive species thrive and often become dominant in ecosystems modified by humans (e.g., [319]), where they are largely contributing to biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, and impairment of ecosystem services (e.g., [321]). It has been clearly shown that reservoirs harbour more invasive species than natural lakes and rivers in the same areas [322,323]. For instance, Eichornia crassipes and many other floating weeds cover water surface in tropical and subtropical reservoirs, impairing water quality (e.g., light conditions, oxygen content, organic matter accumulation), or recreation and transport (e.g., [324,325]). Some submerged invasive plants, such as Elodea canadensis, E. nuttallii (Figure 2P), Chara vulgaris, and Myriophyllum spicatum form monospecific vegetation in hypertrophic reservoirs and play a key role in structuring and homogenization of aquatic plant communities (e.g., [325,326]).\n\nTo summarize this section on reservoirs, recent origin, intensive human use, and water-level instability often cause a lower diversity of biota of reservoirs compared to lakes. If we consider comparable undisturbed lakes as the reference condition for reservoirs, it would be desirable to minimize the disturbances and to facilitate diverse littoral development. This could be possible in less-exploited reservoirs and may lead to the balance between algal and macrophyte production as well as diverse macrophyte-associated fauna. At the same time, we should keep in mind that stable conditions can, in a high-nutrient regime, create cyprinid fish-dominated systems with high productivity, low wate"
