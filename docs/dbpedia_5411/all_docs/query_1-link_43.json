        "text": "Nowadays, there is an increasing concern about environmental challenges ranging from emissions to overconsumption. Most of the environmental problems today are direct consequences of human consumption. Understanding the factors that affect consumer purchasing decisions is critical to developing demand for and commitment to sustainable consumption. In this regard, this study aims to explore the environmentally sustainable consumption behavior of Ethiopian consumers by using an extended model of the theory of planned behavior. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire having open and closed-ended questions. A total of 523 Ethiopian consumers were selected using convenience sampling technique. Structural equation modeling with AMOS V.26.0. was applied for data analysis. The findings show that Ethiopian consumers have very low awareness about the impact of their clothing consumption and disposal. Their consideration of sustainability attributes during purchasing decisions is also low. The structural equation model analysis showed that all variables had a positive and significant effect on the dependent variables at p<0.05, except the effect of personal norms on an environmentally responsible purchasing intention. These results provide additional evidence on the role of environmental labels in purchasing sustainable apparel products. The results of the study allow a better understanding of the factors determining sustainable consumption behavior and suggest practical solutions to their producers. As theory-building activities, with implications for the conceptualization of sustainable consumption behavior are sparse in the literature, this work has also been able to detect sustainable consumption behavior trends and practices by using the availability of a sustainable apparel product and consumers price perceptions of environmentally responsible apparel as a mediating effect of intention and behavior in developing countries, particularly Ethiopia.\n\nField of Research This research study investigates the role of distributed leadership and culture within small enterprises in Malta, an area in which there has been very limited research. It focuses on the interaction between these two elements and their impact on organizational behaviour and effectiveness. Several studies (Jardon et al 2019; Cope et al., 2011; de Oliveira et al., 2015; Mohanty et al., 2012;) suggest that effective leadership and culture are vital elements in the successful endeavours of small organizations. Schein (2006) further asserts that they are two different faces on the same coin and the dyadic interaction characterizes “how leaders create culture and how culture defines and creates leaders”. Distributed Leadership is a systematic practice of interactions and synergies between leaders, followers, and the situation (Spillane 2013). It is different from traditional leadership, which involves top-down management because it tends to be more democratic and participatory, whereby influence and decision-making are shared among multiple individuals rather than being controlled by a single leader. (Xhemajli et al. 2022) Methodology Adopting a naturalistic approach and guided by an interpretivist, constructivist epistemological stance, this research delves into the intricate interplay between leadership and culture within small businesses. The chosen research methodology employs Grounded Theory, recognized for its robust and systematic process facilitating the observation of patterns through intensive iterative and highly analytical procedures (Charmaz, 2015).In the initial stages of field research, characterized by 'responsive interviewing' (Rubin and Rubin, 2012), data sampling commenced with convenience sampling. This initial phase gradually evolved into a refined strategy incorporating selective sampling and theoretical sampling (Corbin and Strauss, 2015). The shift in sampling approaches reflects a deliberate focus on collecting data based on its specific contribution to the development and comprehension of the dimensions, properties, and characteristics of key concepts.The induction of theory is a product of successive comparative analyses, involving the systematic comparison of data points to identify both similarities and variations. Abductive reasoning is integral throughout the analytical process, with particular emphasis during constant comparative analysis of categories, leading to theoretical integration (Charmaz, 2006). This meticulous approach aligns with the assertion of Strauss and Corbin (2015) that grounding theory in data enhances the likelihood of deriving theories that authentically reflect reality.The key advantage of using this approach is that the analysis carried out goes beyond deep exploration and rich description and actually develops a framework that explains the phenomena observed (Parker and Roffey, 1997, p.218). This is very important if the findings are to contribute to the knowledge enhancement of any field of practiceThe culmination of this research effort is the presentation of a set of interconnected concepts, intricately woven together into an emergent parsimonious model (Corbin and Strauss, 2015). This model serves to explain the dynamic interplay between leadership and culture, elucidating its tangible impact on the effectiveness of small enterprises. Research Contribution:Implications for Practice This research contributes to the literature on leadership and organizational culture in small enterprises, particularly in the context of Malta where such studies are scarce. By providing an initial exploration of these phenomena and their impact on organizational behavior, this paper lays the groundwork for further inquiry into this important area. Furthermore, the study offers practical insights for leaders of small enterprises by elucidating leadership behaviors observed in established organizations. Through applied cases, it demonstrates how the abstract concept of culture can be translated into a practical instrument that supports leadership and organizational development. This not only enriches the understanding of leadership dynamics but also provides tangible strategies for implementation. Moreover, the research contributes empirical evidence on the development of leadership functions within small enterprises, emphasizing the potential of shared and distributed leadership models. By grounding its findings in data, the study equips leaders with a deeper understanding of how these leadership approaches can shape organizational development, fostering more effective management practices in small businesses. Methodologically, the adoption of Grounded Theory methodology showcases its efficacy in exploring complex management phenomena. By employing this approach, the researchers were able to gather rich descriptions and develop an explanatory framework, highlighting its applicability in studying nuanced organizational dynamics. Implications for Policy and Theory This research also holds significant implications for policymakers, academic researchers and institutions involved in supporting small businesses. By providing insights into distributed leadership and cultural influences on organizational effectiveness, it offers a basis for informed policy formulation and support mechanisms. The conceptual model emerging from this study serves as a foundation for designing more targeted policies that cater to the unique needs of small enterprises. By understanding the intricacies of leadership dynamics and cultural contexts, policymakers can develop interventions that foster a conducive environment for small business growth and sustainability. Additionally, academic researchers can use these findings to further refine theoretical frameworks and empirical studies in the field, contributing to ongoing scholarly dialogue and knowledge advancement.\n\nABSTRACT CONTEXT: Agriculture is the largest sector of Nepalese economy among the south-Asian developing countries that contributed 26.98 % share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the year 2018/19. The capacity to derive maximum output by per unit of resource is resource use efficiency. Resource use efficiency of a producer explains the comparison between inputs and output value. Potato is staple vegetable in every parts of Nepal. Cobb-Douglas production function is used to predict the significance of inputs in income from cash crops. Due to lack of optimum utilization of available resources in cultivation of vegetable like lack of technical knowledge, low education level, and extensive service the productivity and production is low in Nepalese economy. It ensures vegetable security in Nepal. Though, there are extensive researches on the resource use efficiency and productivity issues on agriculture, very few papers explored in the case of Sudurpaschim province of Nepal OBJECTIVE: This study had the specific purposes: (1) To identify the factors affecting in resource use efficiency and productivity of potato production (2) to utilize the resource use efficiency and productivity in potato production and (3) to show the type of returns to scale in potato production. METHODS: Applying post-positivist paradigm and quantitative causal survey research design, it explored the resource use efficiency and productivity through the semi-structured questionnaire from 140 households by random sampling. Data analysis was carried out by multiple regression model using Cobb-Douglas production function. SPSS software was used to find quantitative results. From the analysis of data using mean, and SD, t-test, analysis of variance, Durbin-Waston test, Marginal Value Product and marginal Factor cost, findings of this research was emerged. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The major findings: education level, extension service, farm size and pesticide cost were significant variables in potato production; seed, hired labor, Family Yard Manure and pesticide cost were overused and needed to decrease their cost for optimum allocation and there was decreasing returns to scale in production. This study emphasized on increasing education level, extensive service and farm size for optimum utilization of resources and increasing returns to scale. SIGNIFICANCE: Barriers to Indian potatoes and increasing returns to scale are only possible through protection policy of government. For optimum use of resources and increasing returns to scale, government can introduce capital intensive technique. This study can be implied in policy making and improving existing situation of agriculture, and allocating budget.\n\nThe refugee crisis has been one of the most challenging problems in the European in recent years, causing sudden and significant political turmoil in most of its member states. Notwithstanding the international treaties on refugee protection, a crucial issue is the reluctance of many local commu-nities to offer refugees access to the labour market and daily social activities. In addition to the dif-ficulties regarding social acceptance, there are also many other legal, social, ethical and political obstacles for refugees. This discussion is mainly limited to the realm of politics and ethics with very few references to the field of management, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and corporate sustainability (CS) where the issues of marginalized people, minorities and vulnerable people are frequently addressed. To fill this gap, this article aims to discuss the role of CSR and CS in over-coming obstacles for refugees in their effort to integrate into the labor market. Through a narrative literature review and snowballing techniques, a theoretical framework is developed to outline the ways that CSR and CS can assist refugees in overcoming different types of obstacles in host coun-tries. Finally, in the discussion, ways in which CSR and CS literature could play a critical role in this discussion are highlighted and how the private sector could relieve the refugee crisis through CSR strategies.\n\nFinancial institutions are currently undergoing a significant shift from traditional robo-advisors to more advanced generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies. This transformation has motivated us to investigate the factors influencing consumer responses to GenAI-driven financial advice. Despite extensive research on the adoption of robo-advisors, there is a gap in understanding the specific contributors and differences in consumer attitudes and reactions to GenAI-based financial guidance, particularly in the context of GenAI. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing the impact of personalized investment suggestions, human-like empathy, and the continuous improvement of GenAI-provided financial advice on consumers' perceived authenticity, their utilitarian attitude towards the use of GenAI for financial advice, and their reactions to GenAI-generated financial suggestions. A comprehensive research model was developed based on Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) and Artificial Intelligence Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA). The model was subsequently employed in a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of survey data from 822 mobile banking users. The findings of this study indicate that personalized investment suggestions, human-like empathy, and the continuous improvement of GenAI's recommendations have a positive influence on consumers' perception of its authenticity. Moreover, we discovered a positive correlation between utilitarian attitudes and perceived authenticity, which ultimately influences consumers' responses to GenAI's financial advisory solutions. This is manifested as either a willingness to engage or resistance to communication. This study contributes to the research on GenAI-powered financial services and underscores the significance of integrating GenAI financial guidance into the routine operations of financial institutions. Our work builds upon previous research on robo-advisors, offering practical insights for financial institutions seeking to leverage GenAI-driven technologies to enhance their services and customer experiences.\n\nThe aim of this work was to classify the business incubators in Spain according to the four phases of the startup’s incubation process. Considering that the graduation rate implies greater survival and business success of the incubated companies, they have been identified at each stage of the incubation (spread of entrepreneurship, pre-incubation, advanced incubation, and graduation). The activities that present higher impacts on the success of the incubated companies and the activities carried out by the business incubator that have a greater relevance on the graduation of the companies have concretely been considered. Principal component (PC) cluster analysis has been applied. All the incubation variables were used simultaneously, reducing their number, and grouping them into factors. Finally, the cases were grouped according to these latent variables. Principal components analysis reduced dimensionality to 8 factors with a 74 % of explained variance. Factor 1 was positively related to pre-incubation variables, factor 2 was linked to training and collaboration variables within the entrepreneurship diffusion phase. Factor 3, named activity monitoring and control, was related to phase 3 or basic incubation variables. Cluster analysis facilitates the grouping of business incubators into three clusters: Group 1 (16 % of the total), incubators with strong deficits in incubation phases 1, 2 and 3. They are small sized business incubators, often located in rural areas or cities and low graduation rate. Group 2 (30 %), business incubators with very high graduation rate, and strongly positive values in factors 1 and 2. Factor 3, although positive, it is susceptible to improvement. They are the largest group of business incubators and usually located in industrial and technological parks. Group 3 (54 %) is the majority, with values close to cluster 2 and 3.\n\nAn ambitious per capita GDP target has been envisioned by the Chinese government since 2020 to project its sustainable economic growth rate by 2035. Can China fully achieve its goal? This is a question worth investigating. By inserting relevant TABLO modules of the final goods trade, the intermediate goods trade, and factor-strengthening technology spillovers, along with technology absorption thresholds effects of the global value chain, this study builds a global dynamic recursive computational general equilibrium (CGE ) model on basis of GTAP-RD. This approach allows considering the 'dual circulation' system strongly advocated and pointed out as the sole way to realize China’s technological (total factor productivity (TFP)) progress by the Chinese government, which integrates both domestic internal and international external circulations (trade and foreign direct investment (FDI)). We simulate China's technological progress under eight scenarios, and use the latest GTAP Version 11 production and trade data (released in April 2023) for 141 countries and regions and results are aggregated into 10 countries groups with 9 activity sectors and 10 commodities. Main conclusions are as follows: (1) If China maintains its trade opening policy, the 2035 vision goal can be achieved, with external circulation being more important than internal circulation for technological spillovers. (2) The economic growth impacts of external and internal circulation operate relatively independently. However, FDI provides a relatively larger synergistic effect for all forms of external trade circulation than to the internal one. Regarding factor-strengthening effects, spillovers are more favorable to 'capital' than to labor factors. (3) We find that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement is the most important strategic partner for China. (4) It appears that FDI is not an effective way to lift the productive services sector's total factor productivity (TFP), and more realistic for China is to open up the productive services market more widely, as its efficiency is a pivotal reflection of China's independent innovation capability. (5) China–US decoupling has an enormous global impact. In all the Scenarios we consider, the United States is always the country that loses the most, and Europe would be the group of countries that benefits when there is a large increase in TFP in the US.\n\nThe digital transformation of the global economy presents new challenges and opportunities for businesses and nations. With the growing role of digital technologies and the dynamic changes in the structure of the economy, there is a need for a better understanding of the processes shaping contemporary enterprises. This article analyzes the impact of digital transformation on businesses and the global economy, identifying key areas where these changes are most evident. As part of this discussion, a modification of the “9 Pillars of Industry 4.0” concept is proposed, incorporating solutions that have emerged since its inception. The resulting model, “11 Pillars of Industry 4.0,” enabled the analysis of the “born digital” and “born global” concepts, highlighting their numerous common features in the context of the digital transformation of economies. This became the basis for proposing a new concept: “born digibal” — enterprises that from the outset operate in multiple markets, with their main sphere of activity based on digital solutions.The conclusions of the article provide an assessment of the changes occurring in businesses and the global economy in the digital age. They suggest that the dynamics of globalization in the 21st century will be shaped by complex interactions between digital transformation and the actions of businesses and nations, requiring flexibility and innovation in adapting to new economic realities.\n\nThe purpose of this manuscript is to examine the extent to which Polish SMEs use digital marketing tools in the context of their impact on economic performance. The choice of the objective is due to the research gap related to the lack of studies on the impact of the use of digital marketing tools on economic performance by SME companies in Poland. In order to achieve the objective, a two-stage approach was used. The first stage identified the degree of use of digital marketing tools by Polish SMEs compared to EU countries based on secondary data. The second stage analyzed the impact of the use of selected digital marketing and sales communication tools on the economic performance of Polish SMEs. The analysis was based on primary data, which were the results of surveys conducted on a sample of 574 Polish SMEs in the industrial sector. The analysis used statistical methods such as difference significance tests (Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc tests), Kendall's rank correlation coefficient and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARSplines). The results obtained have theoretical and practical values. The theoretical implications are the enrichment of the marketing concept of customer value creation taking into account the digital customer, which is also the originality of the research. Practical implications refer to indicating to SME managers the need for, as well as ways of implementing and financing digital technologies within the framework of various EU programs for digital transformation of member states.\n\nThe risk factors and positive factors of teleworking have been widely analyzed. Emotional exhaustion has been one of the most studied among them. However, the impact of ethical leadership in virtual environments has remained completely unnoticed. There is no clear answer to whether the ethical leader is a factor that buffers or accelerates stress-related processes in teleworking. Furthermore, the role of perceived work autonomy as a theoretical mechanism that protects against specific adverse psychological outcomes requires more scientific evidence because the results obtained so far are confusing and contradictory. Therefore, this study explores how and when ethical leadership influences emotional exhaustion through work autonomy and teleworking intensity (TI). The sample consisted of 448 professionals from six organizations in the Colombian electricity sector. The mediation effect was evaluated through a four-step procedure, and the moderated mediation model was analyzed using statistical tools such as PROCESS and AMOS macros for SPSS. Surprisingly, our results revealed a positive relationship between ethical leadership and emotional exhaustion, with work autonomy potentially mediating this relationship. However, teleworking intensity (TI) was found to moderate this mediation process. Specifically, the negative impact of ethical leadership on emotional exhaustion was nullified when TI was high. Moreover, a high level of TI strengthened the relationship between ethical leadership and work autonomy, while weakening the positive relationship between work autonomy and emotional exhaustion. In conclusion, our study suggests a potential positive relationship between ethical leadership and emotional exhaustion from the follower's perspective. However, the number of teleworking days can influence this trend, potentially even reversing it. In other words, teleworking intensity (TI) is a resource as its intensity increases, and it can alter the direction of work autonomy and reconfigure the relationship between ethical leadership and emotional exhaustion. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to analyze these variables, significantly contributing to our understanding of the attributes of ethical leadership and its impact on employee well-being.\n\nBy introducing final goods trade, intermediate goods trade, and factor-strengthening technology spillovers, along with technology absorption thresholds into the global value chain, this paper builds a global dynamic recursive general equilibrium model. This model can simulate China's technological progress driven by both 'internal' and 'external' (trade and FDI) dual circulations. Eight scenarios are employed to test and demonstrate whether China can follow the dual-circulation pattern and achieve the 2035 economic vision. The main conclusions are as follows:: (1) If China maintains its trade opening policy, the 2035 vision goal can be achieved, with external circulation being more important than internal for technological spillovers; (2) The economic growth impacts of external and internal circulations operate relatively independently. However, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) provides a relatively larger synergistic effect to all forms of external trade circulation; (3) Regarding international trade partners, we find that RCEP is the most important strategic partner to China; (4) Apparently, FDI is not an effective way to lift the productive services sector's TFP, and China's realistic choice is to open the productive services market wider, as its efficiency is a pivotal reflection of China's independent innovation capability; (5) For factor-strengthening effects, spillovers are more favorable to 'capital' than to other kinds of labor; (6) The impact of China-US decoupling is enormous to the world. In all the scenarios we have envisioned, the United States is always the country that loses the most, and Europe would be the group of countries to benefit when there is a large increase of TFP in the US.\n\nIn order to help the transportation industry achieve the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, this study is based on the selection of eight variables, such as population size, per ca pita GDP, personal vehicle ownership, passenger and freight turnover, and green space coverage, as the factors influencing the carbon emissions of the transportation industry in Jiangsu Province, and the prediction and analysis of the transportation carbon emission trends from 2000 to 2021, and the prediction and analysis of the carbon emissions of the transportation industry and the time of the peak of the carbon emissions in Jiangsu Province. The trend of transportation carbon emissions from 2000 to 2021 was predicted and analyzed, and the carbon emissions and peak time of carbon emissions in the transportation industry in Jiangsu Province were predicted and analyzed. Comparing the predicted results with other models to verify the accuracy of the results, it was found that the WOA-SVM model had the smallest error among several models. On this basis, targeted measures are proposed to accelerate the process of carbon peak and ensure the smooth achievement of carbon neutrality goals in Jiangsu Province. The results indicate that under the current policy measures, the peak carbon emissions in Jiangsu Province will occur in 2038, with a peak of 48.72 million tons. Jiangsu Province should actively adopt energy-saving and emission-reduction measures, build a green and low-carbon transportation development model, and achieve the carbon peak target ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0) is transforming the global economy, necessitating mall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and cloud computing. Therefore, SMEs need to assess their readiness to identify capabilities and areas for improvement to remain competitive. However, existing IR4.0 readiness assessment such as the Industry4WRD Readiness Assessment and Industry 4.0-Readiness by IMPULS German are time-consuming and restrict the participation of various sectors. Using the understanding of theories such as Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Technology Readiness Index (TRI), and Diffusion Of Innovation (DOI), this study developed an initial research model that identifies the dimensions of IR4.0 readiness; (i) organization, (ii) data, (iii) infrastructure, (iv) analytics, and (v) IT, development and operations. This study carried out qualitative methods through four different phases. The first phase is a systematic literature review, and data collection through participant observation (PO) in IR4.0 skills training programs, seminars, and workshops. The second phase is the development of an initial research model to identify the dimensions of IR4.0 readiness that will be used in the next phase. The third phase is a survey on SME’s IR4.0 readiness via the IR4.0 e-Readiness Checker (IR4.0 eRC) readiness assessment system, which produces the final research model, IR4.0 SME Readiness Model. In the fourth phase, the IR4.0 Readiness Model is confirmed for use by SMEs in Malaysia through interviews with three industry experts in Malaysia. Based on the 50 responses in the IR4.0 eRC evaluation, the average IR4.0 readiness of SMEs is 66%, and only 10 SMEs with less than 50%, showing room and improvement opportunities for the continuous research and development of IR4.0 transformation. This study developed IR4.0 readiness model for SMEs to assess readiness for IR4.0 transformation, support investments in IoT projects and employee upskilling programs.\n\nIn the evolving landscape of digital marketing, cross-channel attribution modeling plays a crucial role in understanding and optimizing the customer journey across various touchpoints. As consumers interact with brands through multiple channels—such as social media, email, search engines, and display ads—accurately attributing conversions to the right channels is vital for optimizing marketing strategies and budgets. However, the advent of stringent privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), has significantly impacted the data collection and analysis processes in digital marketing. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities presented by cross-channel attribution modeling in the age of heightened privacy awareness. It examines how traditional data-driven attribution models, which often rely on tracking individual user behavior, are being adapted or replaced in response to privacy concerns and regulatory requirements. The paper discusses the emergence of privacy-preserving techniques, such as aggregated data analysis, differential privacy, and the use of anonymized data, which aim to balance the need for accurate attribution with the protection of consumer privacy. Furthermore, the paper highlights the role of first-party data and the growing importance of consent management in the collection and utilization of consumer information. It also investigates how marketers are leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance attribution models in a privacy-conscious world. The study concludes by offering best practices for businesses seeking to navigate the complexities of cross-channel attribution in the context of evolving privacy regulations, emphasizing the need for transparency, compliance, and ethical data handling. This research provides valuable insights for marketers, data scientists, and policymakers on how to effectively manage the interplay between accurate attribution and privacy, ensuring that marketing efforts remain effective while respecting consumer rights."
