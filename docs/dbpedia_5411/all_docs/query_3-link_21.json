The unique characteristics of the young immune system make it prone to altered responses to infections and vaccinations, requiring a tailored approach to disease prevention. The recent approval of the maternal RSV vaccine (brand name ABRYSVO) represents a pivotal advancement in preventive strategies among newborns and infants, marking a milestone in RSV research as the first market-approved maternal vaccine. The present review examines clinical trial data on both recent and previous vaccine candidates, as well as the licensed vaccine, focusing on the prevention of RSV disease in newborns and young infants through the passive acquisition of antibodies following maternal immunization. Additionally, it evaluates the safety profile of these vaccines.

Study design: Quasi-experimental study. Methods: Phases 1–4 of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model were used to identify the needs for COVID-19 prevention. Strategies to address predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors in the PRECEDE-PROCEED model were developed, and an intervention package was generated thereafter. A pre–post experimental study was conducted among 50 participants to preliminarily assess the effects of the intervention based on Phases 5 and 8 of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model. Results: The 3-month intervention package contained 16 health education videos, 36 health tips, individual consultations, regular reminders of vaccination, incentive of anti-epidemic packages, and vaccine booking services. By the third month, 33 participants took a new dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 5 participants withdrew. The vaccination rate for new dose achieved 73.3% (95% CI: 58.06–85.40%). Compared with the Hong Kong population in the same period, our study demonstrated higher increase in vaccination rate (9.97 vs. 1.36 doses per 1000 person-days). The percentage of early testing in personal and family level increased to 86.7% and 84.4%, respectively (both p < 0.05). For correct mask wearing and hand washing, the scores increased from a baseline score of 9.1 ± 1.6 and 4.9 ± 1.3 to 9.5 ± 1.0 and 5.3 ± 1.2, respectively (both p < 0.05). Conclusions: The application of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model effectively facilitated the stepwise development, implementation, and evaluation of a health education program for improving vaccination rates and fostering self-protective behaviors against infections.

One participatory research approach used to engage CALD communities around vaccination is participatory action research (PAR), but we know little about the use of PAR to engage priority migrant and CALD communities around school and HPV vaccination. To address this gap, we partnered with our local Multicultural Health Service to understand how the largest CALD group in our region of New South Wales, Australia, engages with their local school and HPV vaccination program. Through a long-standing PAR relationship, we used a participatory research method (World Café) approach to explore the level of awareness and engagement a multi-generational community member had concerning HPV vaccination. We acted by sharing a co-designed information website to answer the community’s questions about HPV vaccination. We then evaluated these engagements with surveys, focus groups and online analytic platforms. Last, we reflected with project partners and health service stakeholders on the overall project outcomes and shared our learnings. In our discussion, we shared our lessons learned and contributed to a wider conversation about the benefits, challenges, and practicalities of using PAR to engage a priority CALD community around HPV vaccination.

These features make it a significant target for understanding virus–host interactions and developing vaccines to combat COVID-19. Recent structural studies provide valuable insights into the conformational dynamics and membrane topology of the SARS-CoV-2 env protein, shedding light on its functional mechanisms. The strong homology and highly conserved structure of the SARS-CoV-2 env protein shape its immunogenicity and functional characteristics. This study examines the ability of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 env protein to stimulate an immune response. In this study, recombinant envelope proteins were produced using the baculovirus expression system, and their potential efficacy was evaluated in both in vivo and in vitro models. Our results reveal that the env protein of SARS-CoV-2 stimulates humoral and cellular responses and highlight its potential as a promising vaccine candidate for combating the ongoing pandemic.

This study sought to uncover the potential effects of the pandemic on attitudes about the HPV vaccine, and factors associated with changes in attitudes. We conducted a national survey (n = 3968) of U.S. mothers with children aged 9–17 years. Outcome variables measured changes in attitude toward the HPV vaccine following the pandemic. Two logistic regression models identified predictors of (1) those who did not have attitude changes (always negative vs. always positive), and (2) those who reported attitude changes (change to negative vs. change to positive). Attitudes toward the HPV vaccine remained unchanged in 78.9% of participants (58.1% positive, 20.8% negative). Of the 21.1% reporting changed attitudes, 9.6% changed to positive and 11.5% to negative. Those reporting changing to a negative attitude had a greater odds of reporting conservative political views, and being unsure/undecided about vaccinating their child against HPV compared to those who reported changing to a positive attitude. Targeted strategies are needed to address erosion in confidence in the HPV vaccine and other vaccines resulting from mis- and disinformation associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.

In this study, we evaluated a potentially universal influenza vaccine based on single-component self-assembling protein nanoparticles (1c-SApNPs) presenting the conserved matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) from influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV, respectively). We previously designed a tandem antigen comprising three IAV M2e domains of human, avian/swine, and human/swine origins (termed M2ex3). The M2ex3-presenting 1c-SApNPs conferred complete protection in mice against sequential lethal challenges with H1N1 and H3N2. To broaden this protection to cover IBVs, we designed a series of antigens incorporating different arrangements of three IAV M2e domains and three copies of IBV M2e. Tandem repeats of IAV and IBV (termed influenza A-B) M2e arrayed on the I3-01v9a 60-mer 1c-SApNP, when formulated with an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, generated greater M2e-specific immunogenicity and protective efficacy than the soluble influenza A-B M2e trimer, indicated by higher survival rates and reduced weight loss post-challenge. Importantly, one of the influenza A-B M2e SApNP constructs elicited 100% protection against a lethal influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) challenge in mice and 70% protection against a lethal influenza B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata lineage) challenge, the latter of which has not been reported in the literature to date. Our study thus provides a promising M2e-based single-component universal vaccine candidate against the two major types of influenza virus circulating in humans.

Pneumococcal vaccine composition is based on the polysaccharide capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is one of the most important identified contributors to the pathogen’s virulence. Similarities in the structural composition of polysaccharides included in licensed pneumococcal vaccines may result in cross-reactivity of immune response against closely related serotypes, including serotypes not included in the vaccine. Therefore, it is important to understand whether cross-reactive antibodies offer clinical protection against pneumococcal disease. This review explores available evidence of cross-reactivity and cross-protection associated with pneumococcal vaccines, the challenges associated with the assessment of cross-reactivity and cross-protection, and implications for vaccine design and development.

Of these conditions, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the most prevalent, impacting over 55 million people worldwide. Given the staggering financial toll on the global economy and their widespread manifestation, NDs represent a critical issue for healthcare systems worldwide. Current treatment options merely seek to provide symptomatic relief or slow the rate of functional decline and remain financially inaccessible to many patients. Indeed, no therapy has yet demonstrated the potential to halt the trajectory of NDs, let alone reverse them. It is now recognized that brain accumulation of pathological variants of AD- or PD-associated proteins (i.e., amyloid-β, Tau, α-synuclein) begins years to decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to pursue therapies that prevent the neurodegenerative processes associated with pathological protein aggregation long before a clinical diagnosis can be made. These therapies must be safe, convenient, and affordable to ensure broad coverage in at-risk populations. Based on the need to intervene long before clinical symptoms appear, in this review, we present a rationale for greater investment to support the development of active immunotherapy for the prevention of the two most common NDs based on their safety profile, ability to specifically target pathological proteins, as well as the significantly lower costs associated with manufacturing and distribution, which stands to expand accessibility to millions of people globally.

The pathophysiology of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is mainly associated with the immune system, which involves adhesion molecules and growth factors disruption, excessive expression of inflammatory mediators, decreased levels of anti-inflammatory mediators, and immune cell infiltration in the kidney. Dendritic cells are professional antigen-presenting cells acting as a bridge connecting innate and adaptive immune responses. The anti-inflammatory subset of DCs is also capable of modulating inflammation. Autologous anti-inflammatory dendritic cells can be made by in vitro differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes and utilized as a cell-based therapy. Treatment with anti-inflammatory cytokines, immunosuppressants, and substances derived from pathogens can induce tolerogenic or anti-inflammatory features in ex vivo–generated DCs. It has been established that targeting inflammation can alleviate the progression of DKD. Recent studies have focused on the potential of dendritic cell–based therapies to modulate immune responses favorably. By inducing a tolerogenic phenotype in dendritic cells, it is possible to decrease the inflammatory response and subsequent kidney damage. This article highlights the possibility of using anti-inflammatory DCs as a cell-based therapy for DKD through its role in controlling inflammation.

A total of 43,875 day 8 surveys matched with day 3 survey responses were sent, with a response rate of 71.5% (N = 31,355). Half (50.7%) of respondents reported any adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) in the 0–3 days after vaccination and 24.6% reported any AEFI 4–7 days after vaccination. Fatigue, local pain, headache, and myalgia were the most frequently reported symptoms for both vaccines in both periods. After adjusting for respondent characteristics, vaccination clinic type, jurisdiction, and medical conditions, the odds for reporting AEFI increased with age from 16–19 years to highest odds at 30–39 years, after which it declined. Females had greater odd of reporting AEFI than males across most age groups, vaccine types, and doses. Respondents with a history of anaphylaxis had greater odds of reporting any AEFI (adjusted OR range: 1.50–2.86). A total of 3.1% of respondents reported seeking medical review 0–3 days after vaccination. This study affirms the short-term safety of Spikevax and Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine priming doses in a large sample in Australia.

Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a related emerging alphavirus with epidemic potential with circulation overlap potential with CHIKV. We previously reported the ability of a non-replicating human adenovirus (AdV)-vectored vaccine expressing the MAYV structural polyprotein to protect against disease in mice following challenge with MAYV, CHIKV and UNAV. Herein, we evaluated mouse immunity and protective efficacy for an AdV-CHIKV full structural polyprotein vaccine in combination with heterologous AdV-MAYV prime/boost regimens versus vaccine coadministration. Heterologous prime/boost regimens skewed immunity toward the prime vaccine antigen but allowed for a boost of cross-neutralizing antibodies, while vaccine co-administration elicited robust, balanced responses capable of boosting. All immunization strategies protected against disease from homologous virus infection, but reciprocal protective immunity differences were revealed upon challenge with heterologous viruses. In vivo passive transfer experiments reproduced the inequity in reciprocal cross-protection after heterologous MAYV challenge. We detected in vitro antibody-dependent enhancement of MAYV replication, suggesting a potential mechanism for the lack of cross-protection. Our findings provide important insights into rational alphavirus vaccine design that may have important implications for the evolving alphavirus vaccine landscape.

We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the immunogenicity and safety of all chikungunya vaccines that have been progressed to clinical trial evaluation (VLA1553; mRNA-1388/VAL-181388; PXVX0317/VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP; ChAdOx1 Chik; MV-CHIK). We included trials retrieved from MedLine, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The outcomes were the rates of seroconversion/seroresponse and serious adverse events (SAEs) after the primary immunization course. We retrieved a total of 14 datasets, including >4000 participants. All candidate chikungunya vaccines were able to elicit an immunogenic response in ≥96% of vaccinated subjects, regardless of the vaccination schedule and platform used, and the seroconversion/seroresponse rates remained high 6 to 12 months after vaccination for most vaccines. Four of the five candidate vaccines showed a good overall safety profile (no data were available for ChAdOx1 Chik), with no significant increase in the risk of SAEs among the vaccinated, and a low absolute risk of product-related SAEs. Overall, the present findings support the potential use of the candidate vaccines for the prevention of chikungunya and the current indication for use in adult travelers to endemic regions of the licensed VLA 1553 vaccine. In order to extend chikungunya vaccination to a wider audience, further studies are needed on individuals from endemic countries and frail populations.

This review describes the general theory of bactofection and its advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and expectations, compiling the most notable advances in 14 vaccination studies, 27 cancer therapy studies, and 13 clinical trials. It also describes the current scope of bactofection and promising results. The extensive knowledge of Salmonella biology, as well as the multiple adequacies of the Ty21a vaccination platform, has allowed notable developments worldwide that have mainly been reflected in therapeutic efforts against cancer. In this regard, we strongly recommend the creation of a recombinant Ty21a model that constitutively expresses the GtgE protease from S. typhimurium, allowing this vector to be used in animal trials, thus enhancing the likelihood of favorable results that could quickly transition to clinical trials. From the current perspective, it is necessary to explore a greater diversity of bacterial vectors and find the best combination of implemented attenuations, generating personalized models that guarantee the maximum effectiveness in cancer therapy and vaccination.

One of the strategies for pandemic control was mass vaccination. In Brazil, the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (RCV) was produced on a large scale and offered at no charge to the population. The specifications for quality control analyses of RCV included identity and infectivity determination. To validate the results, a reference material (RM) must be analyzed in parallel with the sample vaccine. This research aimed to establish the RM for use in the identity and infectivity assay for RCV. The candidate RM was analyzed using homogeneity and stability studies. The RM was considered homogeneous for identity (cycle threshold (Ct) ≤ 25.19) and infectivity (average x- was 9.25 log10 infectious units/mL). The RM was considered adequately stable for identity during the total period in all studies, being stable at −70, 5, and 22.5 °C for 380, 313, and 14 days, respectively (Ct ≤ 21.81). For infectivity, the RM was stable at −70, 5, and 22.5 °C for 380, 97, and three days, respectively. Since the property identity and infectivity values of the RM were established, the new RM could be used in quality control analysis.

This study aims to explore the hypothesis that engaging in physical exercise at the time of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination may promote a cardiac inflammatory response, leading to the development of myopericarditis. Male BALB/c mice underwent treadmill running or remained sedentary for five weeks. Subsequently, two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or vehicle were administered with a 14-day interval, while the exercise regimen continued. The animals were euthanized days after the second vaccination. Vaccination was followed by body weight loss, increased hepatic inflammation, and an antigen-specific T cell response. Small foci of fibrovascular inflammation and focal cell loss were observed in the right ventricle, irrespective of vaccination and/or exercise. Vaccination did not elevate cardiac troponin levels. Cardiac tissue from the vaccinated mice showed upregulated mRNA expression of the genes IFNγ and IL-1β, but not IL-6 or TNFα. This pro-inflammatory signature in the heart was not exacerbated by endurance exercise. Ex vivo vascular reactivity remained unaffected by vaccination. Our data provide evidence for the cardiac safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. The role of exercise in the development of pro-inflammatory cardiac changes post mRNA vaccination could not be established.

While deploying these spike-based vaccines saved millions of lives worldwide, it has become clear that the immunological mechanisms of protection against severe disease are multifaceted and involve non-neutralizing antibody components. Here, we describe a novel pan-sarbecovirus T-cell vaccine, ChAdOx1.COVconsv12, designed to complement and broaden the protection of spike vaccines. The vaccine immunogen COVconsv12 employs the two regions in the viral proteome most conserved among sarbecoviruses, which are delivered by replication-deficient vector ChAdOx1. It directs T cells towards epitopes shared among sarbecoviruses including evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we show that ChAdOx1.COVconsv12 induced broad T-cell responses in the BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In the Syrian hamster challenge model, ChAdOx1.COVconsv12 alone did not protect against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but when co-administered with 1/50th of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 spike vaccine protective dose, faster recovery and lower oral swab viral load were observed. Induction of CD8+ T cells may decrease COVID-19 severity and extend the T-cell response coverage of variants to match the known (and as yet unknown) members of the β-coronavirus family.

Since we are observing the first MPXV outbreak outside the African continent, the general population probably does not have a pre-existing memory response for MPXV but may have immunity against the previous smallpox vaccine based on a live replicating Vaccinia strain (VACV). Using a whole blood platform, we aim to study the MPXV- T-cell-specific response in Mpox-cured subjects. Methods: We enrolled 16 subjects diagnosed with Mpox in the previous 3–7 months and 15 healthy donors (HD) with no recent vaccination history. Whole blood was stimulated overnight with MPXV and VACV peptides to elicit CD4 and CD8 T-cell-specific responses, which were evaluated by ELISA and multiplex assay. Results: Mpox-cured subjects showed a significant IFN-γ T-cell response to MPXV and VACV. Besides IFN-γ, IL-6, IP-10, IL-8, IL-2, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP1-α, MIP-1β, IL-1Rα, and IL-5 were significantly induced after specific stimulation compared to the unstimulated control. The specific response was mainly induced by the CD4 peptides MPX-CD4-E and VACV-CD4. Conclusions: We showed that MPXV-specific responses have a mixed Th1- and Th2-response in a whole blood platform assay, which may be useful for monitoring the specific immunity induced by vaccination or infection.

However, a major side effect of the current method of intramuscular (IM) administration of oil-adjuvanted FMD vaccines is the formation of granulomas in the muscles of pigs. To address this issue, we assessed the possible application of intradermal (ID) vaccination. Initially, we compared the serological immune response in specific pathogen-free pigs inoculated with FMD vaccines formulated with eight different adjuvants, administered twice at the neck site using a syringe with a needle via the ID route. Among the formulations (water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W), oil-in-water (O/W), and polymer nanomaterials), ISA 207 of W/O/W was the most effective in inducing immunogenicity followed by ISA 201 of W/O/W. ISA 207 was further tested in formulations of different antigen doses (12 or 1.2 μg) delivered via both IM and ID routes. All four treatments successfully protected the pigs against FMD virus challenges. To assess the feasibility of the field application of the vaccines with ISA 207, we conducted ID vaccination of conventional pigs using a needle-free device, resulting in the detection of significant levels of neutralizing antibodies. ISA 207 was shown to be superior to ISA 201 in inducing immunogenicity via the ID route. In conclusion, ISA 207 could be a suitable adjuvant for ID vaccination in terms of vaccine efficacy for FMD, allowing for alternate use of ID vaccination and subsequent reduction in the incidences of granuloma formation in the field.
