        "text": "Rates of escalation to triple COPD therapy among incident users of LAMA and LAMA/LABA.\n\nPubMed\n\nHahn, Beth; Hull, Michael; Blauer-Peterson, Cori; Buikema, Ami R; Ray, Riju; Stanford, Richard H\n\n2018-06-01\n\nImproved outcomes have been reported for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving combination long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting Î² 2 -agonist (LAMA/LABA) therapy compared with LAMA monotherapy. However, little is known about the relative characteristics of these patients and their rates of escalation to triple therapy (TT, combining a LAMA, LABA, and inhaled corticosteroid). This study aimed to characterize patients initiating treatment with the LAMA tiotropium (TIO) and the fixed-dose LAMA/LABA combination therapy umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI), and to compare rates of escalation to TT between patients receiving these therapies. Retrospective study of patients with COPD enrolled in a US health insurance plan during 2013-2015 and newly initiated on TIO or UMEC/VI. Patients were â¥40 years of age at index (date of therapy initiation) with continuous enrollment for 12 months pre-index and â¥30 days post-index. LAMA users were propensity score matched 1:1 to LAMA/LABA users, with TT initiation rates reported by cohort using pharmacy claims. 35,357 patients initiating on TIO and 2407 patients initiating on UMEC/VI were identified. After propensity score matching, the rate of TT initiation was significantly higher in new TIO users (nâ¯=â¯1320) than in new UMEC/VI users (nâ¯=â¯1320) (0.92 vs 0.49 per 100 months of exposure, respectively; pâ¯<â¯0.001). Relative to the UMEC/VI cohort, the TIO cohort had an 87% higher risk of TT initiation (hazard ratio: 1.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.4-2.5; pâ¯=â¯0.001). Patients receiving UMEC/VI progressed to TT more slowly, and were at lower risk of progressing to TT, than patients receiving TIO. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Forestomach].\n\nPubMed\n\nLuciano, L; Voss-Wermbter, G; Behnke, M; von Engelhardt, W; Reale, E\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe mucous membrane of the first and second compartments (ventral regions) as well as of the third compartment of Lama guanacoe and Lama lamae stomach shows tubular glands opening into pits. Below the surface epithelium blood capillaries of the fenestrated type form a regular network, each mesh of which surrounds a gastric pit. From a morphological point of view (thin section and freeze-fracture replicas) the columnar cells of the surface epithelium and those of the pits closest to the capillaries are largely similar to the epithelial cells of the rabbit gallbladder. This similarity suggests that at the level of the columnar cells sodium-dependent water reabsorption occurs. This reabsorption has already been demonstrated in the abovementioned compartments by physiological methods. The surface and foveolae epithelial cells as well as some cells of the tubular glands have a secretory function. Their secretory granules contain mucosubstances, as indicated by light-(PAS- and Alcian blue reactions) and electron microscopic (PA-TCH-Ag-reaction) histochemistry. The secretory granules originate from the Golgi complex which shows a positive histochemical reaction in its innermost sacculi at the electron microscope level. Endocrine cells (s. second part of this investigation) are rare. The mucosal membrane of each muscular lip separating the glandular sacs in the first compartment shows a stratified, not keratinized, squamous epithelium.\n\nCharacteristics and health care resource use of subjects with COPD in the year before initiating LAMA monotherapy or LAMA+LABA combination therapy: A U.S. database study.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagar, Saurabh; Patel, Jeetvan; Stanford, Richard H\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTo characterize subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) newly initiated on long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) or dual LAMA/long-acting Î²2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) therapy. This pilot/preliminary analysis was a retrospective crosssectional study of subjects with COPD from the Optum Impact National Managed Care Benchmark Database. Subjects with at least one LAMA prescription in the index period (July 2008-June 2009) were included and stratified by treatment. Data were collected in the year before the index date and included comorbidities, medication use, COPD-related costs, health care resource use, and exacerbations. Of 5,311 eligible subjects, 2,057 initiated LAMA therapy (LAMA cohort) and 191 initiated LAMA+LABA therapy (LAMA+LABA cohort). The Charlson comorbidity index was slightly lower in the LAMA+LABA cohort than the LAMA cohort (meanÂ±SD: 0.63Â±1.13 vs. 0.66Â±1.28), but the number of prescriptions was higher (meanÂ±SD: 42.9Â±23.2 vs. 30.5Â±27.2). The LAMA+LABA cohort had higher short-acting inhaled Î²2 agonist (56.0% vs. 35.7%), oral corticosteroid (37.7% vs. 32.6%), and home oxygen therapy use (14.1% vs. 3.2%) than the LAMA cohort. Total medical costs were greater in the LAMA+LABA cohort than the LAMA cohort (meanÂ±SD: $3,320.40Â±4085.9 vs. $1,226.20Â±3602.9), although emergency department ($11.00Â±66.8 vs. $30.70Â±259.2) and outpatient visit ($39.60Â±163.1 vs. $41.70Â±424.3) costs were lower. Resource use and exacerbation incidence were similar between cohorts. In this first look, subjects with COPD initiating LAMA or LAMA+LABA therapy exhibited different clinical and resource use characteristics in the year before treatment. Subjects receiving LAMA+LABA were older, with higher COPD co-medication use, more prescriptions, and associated higher pharmacy costs compared with subjects initiating LAMA. These differences may reflect a higher severity of COPD in those starting LABA+LAMA treatment.\n\nLAMA2-related myopathy: Frequency among congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ¸kken, Nicoline; Born, Alfred Peter; Duno, Morten; Vissing, John\n\n2015-10-01\n\nMuscular dystrophy caused by LAMA2-gene mutations is an autosomal recessive disease typically presenting as a severe, early-onset congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). However, milder cases with a limb-girdle type muscular dystrophy (LGMD) have been described. In this study, we assessed the frequency and phenotypic spectrum of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy in CMD (n = 18) and LGMD2 (n = 128) cohorts identified in the last 15 years in eastern Denmark. The medical history, brain-MRI, muscle pathology, muscle laminin-Î±2 expression, and genetic analyses were assessed. Molecular genetics revealed 2 pathogenic LAMA2 mutations in 5 of 18 CMD and 3 of 128 LGMD patients, corresponding to a LAMA2-mutation frequency of 28% in the CMD and 2.3% in the LGMD cohorts, respectively. This study demonstrates a wide clinical spectrum of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy and its prevalence in an LGMD2 cohort, which indicates that LAMA2 muscular dystrophy should be included in the LGMD2 nomenclature.

Laminin-211, a heterotrimeric glycoprotein that contains the Î±2 chain, is crucial for muscle stability establishing a bond between the sarcolemma and the extracellular matrix. More than 215 mutations are listed in the locus specific database (LSDB) for LAMA2 gene (May 2014). A limited number of large deletions/duplications have been reported in LAMA2. Our main objective was the identification of additional large rearrangements in LAMA2 found in CMD patients and a systematic review of cases in the literature and LSDB. In four of the fifty-two patients studied over the last 10 years, only one heterozygous mutation was identified, after sequencing and screening for a frequent LAMA2 deletion. Initial screening of large mutations was performed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe application (MLPA). Further characterization implied several techniques: long-range PCR, cDNA and Southern-blot analysis. Three novel large deletions in LAMA2 and the first pathogenic large duplication were successfully identified, allowing a definitive molecular diagnosis, carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis. A total of fifteen deletions and two duplications previously reported were also reviewed. Two possible mutational \"hotspots\" for deletions may exist, the first encompassing exons 3 and 4 and second in the 3' region (exons 56 to 65) of LAMA2. Our findings show that this type of mutation is fairly frequent (18.4% of mutated alleles) and is underestimated in the literature. It is important to include the screening of large deletions/duplications as part of the genetic diagnosis strategy.\n\nLaboratory Animal Management Assistant (LAMA): a LIMS for active research colonies.\n\nPubMed\n\nMilisavljevic, Marko; Hearty, Taryn; Wong, Tony Y T; Portales-Casamar, Elodie; Simpson, Elizabeth M; Wasserman, Wyeth W\n\n2010-06-01\n\nLaboratory Animal Management Assistant (LAMA) is an internet-based system for tracking large laboratory mouse colonies. It has a user-friendly interface with powerful search capabilities that ease day-to-day tasks such as tracking breeding cages and weaning litters. LAMA was originally developed to manage hundreds of new mouse strains generated by a large functional genomics program, the Pleiades Promoter Project ( http://www.pleiades.org ). The software system has proven to be highly flexible, suitable for diverse management approaches to mouse colonies. It allows custom tagging and grouping of animals, simplifying project-specific handling and access to data. Finally, LAMA was developed in close collaboration with mouse technicians to ease the transition from paper- or Excel-based management systems to computerized tracking, allowing data export in a popular spreadsheet format and automatic printing of cage cards. LAMA is an open-access software tool, freely available to the research community at http://launchpad.net/mousedb .\n\nDevelopmental evolution of flowering plant pollen tube cell walls: callose synthase (CalS) gene expression patterns\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground A number of innovations underlie the origin of rapid reproductive cycles in angiosperms. A critical early step involved the modification of an ancestrally short and slow-growing pollen tube for faster and longer distance transport of sperm to egg. Associated with this shift are the predominantly callose (1,3-Î²-glucan) walls and septae (callose plugs) of angiosperm pollen tubes. Callose synthesis is mediated by callose synthase (CalS). Of 12 CalS gene family members in Arabidopsis, only one (CalS5) has been directly linked to pollen tube callose. CalS5 orthologues are present in several monocot and eudicot genomes, but little is known about the evolutionary origin of CalS5 or what its ancestral function may have been. Results We investigated expression of CalS in pollen and pollen tubes of selected non-flowering seed plants (gymnosperms) and angiosperms within lineages that diverged below the monocot/eudicot node. First, we determined the nearly full length coding sequence of a CalS5 orthologue from Cabomba caroliniana (CcCalS5) (Nymphaeales). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated low CcCalS5 expression within several vegetative tissues, but strong expression in mature pollen. CalS transcripts were detected in pollen tubes of several species within Nymphaeales and Austrobaileyales, and comparative analyses with a phylogenetically diverse group of sequenced genomes indicated homology to CalS5. We also report in silico evidence of a putative CalS5 orthologue from Amborella. Among gymnosperms, CalS5 transcripts were recovered from germinating pollen of Gnetum and Ginkgo, but a novel CalS paralog was instead amplified from germinating pollen of Pinus taeda. Conclusion The finding that CalS5 is the predominant callose synthase in pollen tubes of both early-diverging and model system angiosperms is an indicator of the homology of their novel callosic pollen tube walls and callose plugs. The data suggest that CalS5 had transient expression and pollen\n\nGenetics Home Reference: LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... weakness of the facial muscles and tongue, but intelligence is usually normal.

Part of this interest stems from the awareness that peopleâplace bonds have become fragile as urbanization, increased mobility, and encroaching environmental problems threaten the existence of/and the connections to, places influences sense of attachment in Pasar Lama, Kota Tangerang. Despite its stauts as a Chinatown, the amount of Chinese inhabitant in Pasar Lama is only 1/5 compared to then total number of Native. Therefore an investigation is needed whether the advances of Kota Tangerang and increasing number of people affecting the formation of place attachment at Pasar Lama Communities. The analysis were conducted through eight factors, such as: physical, social, cultural, personal, memories and experiences, place satisfaction, interaction and activity features, and time factor. Qualitative method (ethnography approach) participatory observation and in-depth interview used as the method of research. The informant of this research are the local figure, local citizen, and local authority. Research concludes that the rapid development of Kota Tangerang and the number of citizens do not significantly affect the formation of place attachment, since both communities in Pasar Lama are considered having high attachment. The other factor is, Place Attachment is valued in contribution, a qualitative value instead sheer number of population. These contributions can be seen in the social, cultural and religious aspect based on factors on Place Attachment.\n\nGenetic variants in the LAMA5 gene in pediatric nephrotic syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nBraun, Daniela A; Warejko, Jillian K; Ashraf, Shazia; Tan, Weizhen; Daga, Ankana; Schneider, Ronen; Hermle, Tobias; Jobst-Schwan, Tilman; Widmeier, Eugen; Majmundar, Amar J; Nakayama, Makiko; Schapiro, David; Rao, Jia; Schmidt, Johanna Magdalena; Hoogstraten, Charlotte A; Hugo, Hannah; Bakkaloglu, Sevcan A; Kari, Jameela A; El Desoky, Sherif; Daouk, Ghaleb; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P; Shril, Shirlee; Hildebrandt, Friedhelm\n\n2018-03-09\n\nNephrotic syndrome (NS), a chronic kidney disease, is characterized by significant loss of protein in the urine causing hypoalbuminemia and edema. In general, â¼15% of childhood-onset cases do not respond to steroid therapy and are classified as steroid-resistant NS (SRNS). In â¼30% of cases with SRNS, a causative mutation can be detected in one of 44 monogenic SRNS genes. The gene LAMA5 encodes laminin-Î±5, an essential component of the glomerular basement membrane. Mice with a hypomorphic mutation in the orthologous gene Lama5 develop proteinuria and hematuria. To identify additional monogenic causes of NS, we performed whole exome sequencing in 300 families with pediatric NS. In consanguineous families we applied homozygosity mapping to identify genomic candidate loci for the underlying recessive mutation. In three families, in whom mutations in known NS genes were excluded, but in whom a recessive, monogenic cause of NS was strongly suspected based on pedigree information, we identified homozygous variants of unknown significance (VUS) in the gene LAMA5. While all affected individuals had nonsyndromic NS with an early onset of disease, their clinical outcome and response to immunosuppressive therapy differed notably. We here identify recessive VUS in the gene LAMA5 in patients with partially treatment-responsive NS. More data will be needed to determine the impact of these VUS in disease management. However, familial occurrence of disease, data from genetic mapping and a mouse model that recapitulates the NS phenotypes suggest that these genetic variants may be inherited factors that contribute to the development of NS in pediatric patients.\n\nIn the Lab with the Dalai Lama\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSchmidt, Leigh E.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader was invited to speak at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in November 2005 to promote the idea that through meditation, an emerging meeting point for science and religion in contemporary culture can be reached.

L.; Jones, D. J.; Ferreira, I.; Chen, Z.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nCalSimHydro, the CalSim 3.0 Hydrology Preprocessor, is an application designed to automate the various steps in the computation of hydrologic inputs for CalSim 3.0, a water resources planning model developed jointly by California State Department of Water Resources and United States Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region. CalSimHydro consists of a five-step FORTRAN based program that runs the individual models in succession passing information from one model to the next and aggregating data as required by each model. The final product of CalSimHydro is an updated CalSim 3.0 state variable (SV) DSS input file. CalSimHydro consists of (1) a Rainfall-Runoff Model to compute monthly infiltration, (2) a Soil moisture and demand calculator (IDC) that estimates surface runoff, deep percolation, and water demands for natural vegetation cover and various crops other than rice, (3) a Rice Water Use Model to compute the water demands, deep percolation, irrigation return flow, and runoff from precipitation for the rice fields, (4) a Refuge Water Use Model that simulates the ponding operations for managed wetlands, and (5) a Data Aggregation and Transfer Module to aggregate the outputs from the above modules and transfer them to the CalSim SV input file. In this presentation, we describe a web-based user interface for CalSimHydro using Google Earth Plug-In. The CalSimHydro tool allows users to - interact with geo-referenced layers of the Water Budget Areas (WBA) and Demand Units (DU) displayed over the Sacramento Valley, - view the input parameters of the hydrology preprocessor for a selected WBA or DU in a time series plot or a tabular form, - edit the values of the input parameters in the table or by downloading a spreadsheet of the selected parameter in a selected time range, - run the CalSimHydro modules in the backend server and notify the user when the job is done, - visualize the model output and compare it with a base run result, - download the output SV file to be\n\n[Thirty years of laser-assisted microvascular anastomosis (LAMA): what are the clinical perspectives?].\n\nPubMed\n\nLeclÃ¨re, F M; Duquennoy-Martinot, V; Schoofs, M; Buys, B; Mordon, S\n\n2011-02-01\n\nSince the first studies by Jain and Gorisch (1979), laser-assisted anastomoses have been steadily developed to a stage where clinical use is within reach. The laser-assisted vascular microanastomosis (LAMA) procedure is performed more quickly than conventional anastomosis, the surgically induced vessel damage is limited, and reduced bleeding after unclamping is observed. A Medline literature search, for the January 1979 to February 2010 period, was performed to review articles focusing on the LAMA technique. The search yielded a total of 354 publications, of which 87 were relevant: 82 were animal series and five clinical studies. Microsurgical techniques and principal characteristics of LAMA in patients are the focus of the analysis. This study discusses the technological innovations and new orientations in laser welding. The first two clinical series using the 1.9-Î¼m diode laser appear promising. Technical innovation will most likely lead to greater ease of use of the laser handpiece in the operating room.

Genetic studies have reported a significant association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the LAMA2 gene with myopia. This study aimed to evaluate the association of the tagging SNPs (tSNPs) in the EGR1 and LAMA2 genes with high myopia in two independent Han Chinese populations. Four tSNPs (rs11743810 in the EGR1 gene; rs2571575, rs9321170, and rs1889891 in the LAMA2 gene) were selected, according to the HapMap database (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and were genotyped using the ligase detection reaction (LDR) approach for 167 Han Chinese nuclear families with extremely highly myopic offspring (<-10.0 diopters) and an independent group with 485 extremely highly myopic cases (<-10.0 diopters) and 499 controls. Direct sequencing was used to confirm the LDR results in twenty randomly selected subjects. Family-based association analysis was performed using the family-based association test (FBAT) software package (Version 1.5.5). Population-based association analysis was performed using the Chi-square test. The association analysis power was estimated using online software (http://design.cs.ucla.edu). The FBAT demonstrated that all four tSNPs tested did not show association with high myopia (P>0.05). Haplotype analysis of tSNPs in the LAMA2 genes also did not show a significant association (P>0.05). Meanwhile, population-based association analysis also showed no significant association results with high myopia (P>0.05). On the basis of our family- and population-based analyses for the Han Chinese population, we did not find positive association signals of the four SNPs in the LAMA2 and EGR1 genes with high myopia.\n\nZeroCal: Automatic MAC Protocol Calibration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeier, Andreas; Woehrle, Matthias; Zimmerling, Marco; Thiele, Lothar\n\nSensor network MAC protocols are typically configured for an intended deployment scenario once and for all at compile time. This approach, however, leads to suboptimal performance if the network conditions deviate from the expectations. We present ZeroCal, a distributed algorithm that allows nodes to dynamically adapt to variations in traffic volume. Using ZeroCal, each node autonomously configures its MAC protocol at runtime, thereby trying to reduce the maximum energy consumption among all nodes. While the algorithm is readily usable for any asynchronous low-power listening or low-power probing protocol, we validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of ZeroCal on X-MAC. Extensive testbed experiments and simulations indicate that ZeroCal quickly adapts to traffic variations. We further show that ZeroCal extends network lifetime by 50% compared to an optimal configuration with identical and static MAC parameters at all nodes.\n\nAbsence of microRNA-21 does not reduce muscular dystrophy in mouse models of LAMA2-CMD.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoreira Soares Oliveira, Bernardo; Durbeej, Madeleine; Holmberg, Johan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Current evidence suggests that miR-21 plays a significant role in the progression of fibrosis in muscle diseases. Laminin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) is a severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the gene encoding laminin Î±2 chain. Mouse models dy3K/dy3K and dy2J/dy2J, respectively, adequately mirror severe and milder forms of LAMA2-CMD. Both human and mouse LAMA2-CMD muscles are characterized by extensive fibrosis and considering that fibrosis is the final step that destroys muscle during the disease course, anti-fibrotic therapies may be effective strategies for prevention of LAMA2-CMD. We have previously demonstrated a significant up-regulation of the pro-fibrotic miR-21 in dy3K/dy3K and dy2J/dy2J skeletal muscle. Hence, the objective of this study was to explore if absence of miR-21 reduces fibrogenesis and improves the phenotype of LAMA2-CMD mice. Thus, we generated dy3K/dy3K and dy2J/dy2J mice devoid of miR-21 (dy3K/miR-21 and dy2J/miR-21 mice, respectively). However, the muscular dystrophy phenotype of dy3K/miR-21 and dy2J/miR-21 double knock-out mice was not improved compared to dy3K/dy3K or dy2J/dy2J mice, respectively. Mice displayed the same body weight, dystrophic muscles (with fibrosis) and impaired muscle function. These data indicate that miR-21 may not be involved in the development of fibrosis in LAMA2-CMD.\n\nFond Memories of Cal Council\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMinnis, Douglas L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis article describes the author's personal involvement in the California Council for the Education of Teachers (Cal Council), beginning in 1960 and spanning four decades, which involved associations with key people in California teacher education and credentialing.

More recently, CDC was reported in seven children without neuromuscular involvement (Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome). Using a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified biallelic mutations in LAMA1 as the cause of CDC in seven affected individuals (from five families) independent from those included in the phenotypic description of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Most of these individuals also have high myopia, and some have retinal dystrophy and patchy increased T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2/FLAIR) signal in cortical white matter. In one additional family, we identified two siblings who have truncating LAMA1 mutations in combination with retinal dystrophy and mild cerebellar dysplasia without cysts, indicating that cysts are not an obligate feature associated with loss of LAMA1 function. This work expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with the lamininopathy disorders and highlights the tissue-specific roles played by different laminin-encoding genes.

This book is the carefully edited record of the fascinating discussions at a Mind and Life conference in which five leading physicists and a historian (David Finkelstein, George Greenstein, Piet Hut, Arthur Zajonc, Anton Zeilinger, and Tu Weiming) discussed with the Dalai Lama current thought in theoretical quantum physics, in the context of Buddhist philosophy. A contribution to the science-religion interface, and a useful explanation of our basic understanding of quantum reality, couched at a level that intelligent readers without a deep involvement in science can grasp. In the tradition of other popular books on resonances between modern quantum physics and Zen or Buddhist mystical traditions--notably The Dancing Wu Li Masters and The Tao of Physics , this book gives a clear and useful update of the genuine correspondences between these two rather disparate approaches to understanding the nature of reality.\n\nCal OES Internet Home Cal OES Home\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nSign In You may be trying to access this site from a secured browser on the server.

It is based on the TLA + specification language, and a PlusCal algorithm is automatically translated to a TLA + specification that can be checked with the TLC model checker and reasoned about formally.\n\nImpact of managed MediCal on California family practice programs.\n\nPubMed\n\nZweifler, J A\n\n2001-05-01\n\nAn important source of patients for California's family practice program is MediCal. During the past 5 years, MediCal has established a variety of capitated managed care plans. To assess the impact of California's managed MediCal program on the state's 38 family practice training programs. A cross-sectional, retrospective descriptive survey. A 3-page, 11-question survey was developed by family practice residency directors and staff from the California Academy of Family Physicians, San Francisco. The 38 family practice programs in existence in California in September 1997 were stratified by type of managed MediCal in their county and by type of sponsoring institution--university, county, community based, staff-model health maintenance organization, or managed care system. Of the 38 family practice programs, 27 responded; 19 of 27 programs participated in managed MediCal. The total number of family health center patients, and the percentage of MediCal patients (48%-60%) at family practice programs was similar when stratified by programs with and without managed MediCal and by type of sponsorship. Most programs reported that they were able to compete effectively, although most also reported increased administrative, nursing, and front office costs. Managed MediCal patients were directly assigned to residents in only 3 of 19 programs. The introduction of managed MediCal has not adversely affected the number of patients cared for in California's family practice programs. Continued vigilance regarding California family practice programs' involvement in managed MediCal, including collection of accurate data on the number of MediCal patients and the financial and educational implications for California's family practice programs, is warranted.\n\nThe Efficiency of Delone Coverings of the Canonical Tilings cal T}(*(A_4)) -> T^*(A4) and cal T}(*(D_6)) -> T^*(D6)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPapadopolos, Zorka; Kasner, Gerald\n\nThis chapter is devoted to the coverings of the two quasiperiodic canonical tilings cal T}(*(A_4)) -> T^*(A4) and cal T}(*(D_6)) equiv {cal T}(*(2F)) -> T^*(D6) T^*(2F), obtained by projection from the root lattices A4 and D6, respectively. In the first major part of this chapter, in Sect. 5.2, we shall introduce a Delone covering cal C}(s_{{cal) T}(*(A_4)}) -> C^sT^*(A4) of the 2-dimensional decagonal tiling cal T}(*(A_4)) -> T^*(A4). In the second major part of this chapter, Sect. 5.3, we summarize the results related to the Delone covering of the icosahedral tiling cal T}(*(D_6)) -> T^*(D6), cal C}_{{cal T}(*(D_6)}) -> CT^*(D6) and determine the zero-, single-, and double- deckings and the resulting thickness of the covering. In the conclusions section, we give some suggestions as to how the definition of the Delone covering might be changed in order to reach some real (full) covering of the icosahedral tiling cal T}(*(D_6)) -> T^*(D6). In Section 5.2 the definition of the Delone covering is also changed in order to avoid an unnecessary large thickness of the covering.\n\nFixed Combination Aerosol Foam Calcipotriene 0.005% (Cal) Plus Betamethasone Dipropionate 0.064% (BD) is More Efficacious than Cal or BD Aerosol Foam Alone for Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTyring, Stephen; Bukhalo, Michael; Alonso-Llamazares, Javier; Olesen, Martin; Lowson, David; Yamauchi, Paul\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy of fixed combination aerosol foam calcipotriene 0.005% (Cal) plus betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% (BD). Design: Patients were randomized (100:101:101) to receive Cal/BD foam, Cal foam, or BD foam once daily for four weeks. Setting: Twenty-eight United States centers. Participants: 302 patients (â¥18 years) with Psoriasis vulgaris (plaque Psoriasis; â¥mild disease severity by physicians global assessment). Measurements: Treatment success of the body (âclearâ/âalmost clearâ from baseline moderate/severe disease; âclearâ from baseline mild disease). Involved scalp treatment success was an additional endpoint. Results: Most patients (76%) had moderate Psoriasis of the body (66% for scalp). At Week 4, 45 percent of Cal/BD foam patients achieved treatment success, significantly more than Cal foam (14.9%; OR 4.34 [95%CI 2.16,8.72] P<0.001) or BD foam (30.7%; 1.81 [1.00,3.26] P=0.047). Fifty-three percent of Cal/BD foam patients achieved treatment success of the scalp, significantly greater than Cal foam (35.6%; 1.91 [1.09,3.35] P=0.021), but not BD foam (47.5%; 1.24 [0.71,2.16] P=0.45). Mean modified Psoriasis area and severity index (population baseline 7.6) improved in all groups, with statistically significant differences in Week 4 Cal/BD foam score (2.37) versus Cal foam (4.39; mean difference -2.03 [-2.63][-1.43] P<0.001) and BD foam (3.37; -1.19 [-1.80][-0.59] P<0.001). Four (Cal/BD), 10 (Cal), and 8 (BD) adverse drug reactions were reported. Conclusion: Cal/BD foam was significantly more effective than Cal foam and BD foam in providing treatment success at Week 4 and effective on involved scalp. Trial registration: NCT01536938.

Lesions were raised or plaque-like, erythematous, firm to soft in consistency and were observed on the face and skin of the axillary, abdominal, perineal and inguinal regions. The lesions were not painful or pruritic. Microscopical examination revealed an irregular parakeratotic lamellar hyperkeratosis associated with diffuse proliferation of arterioles and venules in the superficial dermis. Immunohistochemical analysis determined that the cells forming these vessels and perivascular cells expressed factor VIII-related antigen, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD31 and smooth-muscle alpha-actin. These studies confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous angiomatosis. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The data presented here, part of a larger ongoing study, assess its use in emergency hand surgery. Between 2011 and 2014, 11 patients were operated on for hand trauma with laser-assisted microanastomoses (LAMA) and prospectively analysed. LAMA was performed with a 1950-nm diode laser after placement of equidistant stitches. For vessel size <1.5 mm, the following laser parameters were used: spot size 400 Î¼m, five spots for each wall, power 125 mW, and arterial/venous fluence 100/90 J/cm(2) (spot duration 1/0.9 s). Mean operating time for arterial and venous microanastomoses was 7.3âÂ±â1.4 and 8.7âÂ±â1.0 min, respectively. Three anastomoses required a secondary laser application. Arterial and venous patency rates were 100 % at the time of surgery. The success rate for the 11 procedures assessed clinically and with the Doppler was 100 %. The technique is compared to the current literature. The 1950-nm LAMA is a reliable tool with excellent results in emergency hand surgery. The system is very compact and transportable for utilization in the emergency operating room.\n\nCal-Adapt: California's Climate Data Resource and Interactive Toolkit\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThomas, N.; Mukhtyar, S.; Wilhelm, S.; Galey, B.; Lehmer, E.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nCal-Adapt is a web-based application that provides an interactive toolkit and information clearinghouse to help agencies, communities, local planners, resource managers, and the public understand climate change risks and impacts at the local level. The website offers interactive, visually compelling, and useful data visualization tools that show how climate change might affect California using downscaled continental climate data. Cal-Adapt is supporting California's Fourth Climate Change Assessment through providing access to the wealth of modeled and observed data and adaption-related information produced by California's scientific community. The site has been developed by UC Berkeley's Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF) in collaboration with the California Energy Commission's (CEC) Research Program. The Cal-Adapt website allows decision makers, scientists and residents of California to turn research results and climate projections into effective adaptation decisions and policies. Since its release to the public in June 2011, Cal-Adapt has been visited by more than 94,000 unique visitors from over 180 countries, all 50 U.S. states, and 689 California localities. We will present several key visualizations that have been employed by Cal-Adapt's users to support their efforts to understand local impacts of climate change, indicate the breadth of data available, and delineate specific use cases. Recently, CEC and GIF have been developing and releasing Cal-Adapt 2.0, which includes updates and enhancements that are increasing its ease of use, information value, visualization tools, and data accessibility. We showcase how Cal-Adapt is evolving in response to feedback from a variety of sources to present finer-resolution downscaled data, and offer an open API that allows other organization to access Cal-Adapt climate data and build domain specific visualization and planning tools.

(Apicomplexa: Sarcocystidae), and redescription of Sarcocystis aucheniae from llama (Lama glama), guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and alpaca (Vicugna pacos).\n\nPubMed\n\nMorÃ©, GastÃ³n; Regensburger, Cristian; Gos, M Laura; Pardini, Lais; Verma, Shiv K; Ctibor, Juliana; Serrano-MartÃ­nez, Marcos Enrique; Dubey, Jitender P; Venturini, M Cecilia\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThere is considerable confusion concerning the species of Sarcocystis in South American camelids (SAC). Several species names have been used; however, proper descriptions are lacking. In the present paper, we redescribe the macroscopic sarcocyst forming Sarcocystis aucheniae and describe and propose a new name, Sarcocystis masoni for the microscopic sarcocyst forming species. Muscles samples were obtained from llamas (Lama glama) and guanacos (Lama guanicoe) from Argentina and from alpacas (Vicugna pacos) and llamas from Peru. Individual sarcocysts were processed by optical and electron microscopy, and molecular studies. Microscopic sarcocysts of S. masoni were up to 800 Âµm long and 35-95 Âµm wide, the sarcocyst wall was 2Â·5-3Â·5 Âµm thick, and had conical to cylindrical villar protrusions (vp) with several microtubules. Each vp had 11 or more rows of knob-like projections. Seven 18S rRNA gene sequences obtained from sarcocysts revealed 95-96% identity with other Sarcocystis spp. sequences reported in the GenBank. Sarcocysts of S. aucheniae were macroscopic, up to 1Â·2 cm long and surrounded by a dense and laminar 50 Âµm thick secondary cyst wall. The sarcocyst wall was up to 10 Âµm thick, and had branched vp, appearing like cauliflower. Comparison of the 11 sequences obtained from individual macroscopic cysts evidenced a 98-99% of sequence homology with other S. aucheniae sequences. In conclusion, 2 morphologically and molecularly different Sarcocystis species, S. masoni (microscopic cysts) and S. aucheniae (macroscopic cysts), were identified affecting different SAC from Argentina and Peru.\n\nSolar CalPoly\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStannard, Sandra\n\nThe target budget of INhouse was about $650,000 for all materials and student expenses of the Solar Decathlon competition. In order to reach our goal, Cal Poly students and faculty worked with the College of Architecture and Environmental Designâs External Relations office to actively fundraise for INhouse. Students connected with Cal Poly alumni through phone calls, postal mail, email, and live presentations to reach as many alumni in the state of California as possible. Before construction begun, students and faculty met on a weekly basis to determine what brands of materials for the home to use and who would bemoreÂ Â» responsible for reaching out to the company to seek a donation. Our College of Architecture and Environmental Designâs administration was essential in helping us fundraise. For some time, the college was hoping to depend on about half of our fundraising expenses to be covered through the sale of INhouse. However, plans to sell the home fell through during the design development phase; the college turned to the sale of a different asset in to help us meet our goal. If we were to do this project again, completing the design concept and securing a future location of our home sooner would have enhanced our fundraising activities.Â«Â less\n\n1.9-Î¼m diode-laser-assisted anastomoses (LAMA) in reconstructive microsurgery: results of the preliminary clinical study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMordon, Serge R.; Schoofs, Michel; Martinot, Veronique L.; Capon, Alexandre; Buys, Bruno; Patenotre, Philippe; Pellerin, P. N.\n\n2001-05-01\n\nThe authors report an original 1.9-micrometers diode laser assisted microvascular anastomosis (LAMA) in human. This technique has been applied in 20 patients during reconstructive surgery for digital replantations (nequals6), for digital revascularizations (nequals4) and for free flap transfers (nequals10). LAMA were always performed on vessel (16 arteries and 6 veins) which did not impede the chance of success of the surgical procedure in case of thrombosis. LAMA was performed with a 1.9-micrometers diode laser after placement of 2 equidistant stitches at 180 degrees. The diode spot was obtained by means of a 300-micrometers optic fiber transmitted to the vessel wall via a pencil size hand piece. The following parameters were used: spot size equals 500 micrometers , power equals 70 to 220 mW, pulse duration equals 0.7 to 3 seconds. Ten to 15 spots were applied on each face. The mechanism involved is a thermal effect on the collagen of the adventitia and media leading to a phenomenon which the authors have termed 'heliofusion'. Immediate assessment consisted in evaluating the permeability by patency test (O'Brien) and water tightness. Secondary assessment consisted in evaluating the clinical success, confirmed by Doppler at one month.\n\nThe Return of Two-Class MedicineâIII Effects of Medi-Cal Reform\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWaitzkin, Howard\n\n1985-01-01\n\nCalifornia's drastic Medi-Cal reforms have created great difficulties in health care for the poor. Patients' clinical problems seldom are apparent in descriptions of changes in public insurance programs. Rapidly escalating costs of Medi-Cal led to irresistible pressures for reform, especially from the business community. The new Medi-Cal regulations provide for prospective contracts with hospitals for inpatient services, the transfer of âMedically Indigent Adultsâ to the responsibility of county governments and various other straightforward funding cutbacks. Confusion, disruption of services and adverse health outcomes have accompanied the Medi-Cal reforms. PMID:3892917\n\nUSS Cal Builders, Inc.

The graduation rate among CAMPARE scholars is 98%, and of the CAMPARE scholars who have graduated with a Bachelorâs degree, more than 60% have completed or are pursuing graduate education in astronomy or a related field, at institutions including UCLA, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, USC, Stanford, Univ. of Arizona, Univ. of Washington, and the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masterâs-to-PhD program.Now entering its third year, the Cal-Bridge program is a CSU-UC Bridge program comprised of over 75 physics and astronomy faculty from 5 University of California (UC), 9 California State University (CSU), and 14 California Community College (CCC) campuses in Southern California. In the first three years, 22 Cal-Bridge Scholars have been selected, including 11 Hispanic, 3 African-American and 8 female students, 5 of whom are from URM groups. Nineteen (19) of the 22 Cal-Bridge Scholars are first-generation college students.

PAS-cal is expressed at high yields in Escherichia coli as a Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) fusion protein, which is easily purified and allows isolation of the PAS-cal moiety after SUMO protease cleavage. Upon subsequent in situ treatment with trypsin, the PAS-cal polypeptide yields a set of four defined homogeneous peptides in the range from 2 to 8 kDa with equal mass spacing. ESI-MS analysis revealed a conveniently interpretable raw spectrum, which after deconvolution resulted in a very simple pattern of four peaks with similar ionization signals. MALDI-MS analysis of a PAS-cal peptide mixture comprising both the intact polypeptide and its tryptic fragments revealed not only the four standard peptides but also the singly and doubly charged states of the intact concatamer as well as di- and trimeric adduct ion species between the peptides, thus augmenting the observable m/z range. The advantageous properties of PAS-cal are most likely a result of the strongly hydrophilic and conformationally disordered PEG-like properties of the PAS sequences. Therefore, PAS-cal offers an inexpensive and versatile recombinant peptide calibration standard for mass spectrometry in protein/peptide bioanalytics and proteomics research, the composition of which may be further adapted to fit individual needs.\n\nOSD CALS Architecture Master Plan Study.

A.; Corrigan, A. L.; Russell, L. M.; Liu, S.; Takahama, S.; Taylor, J. W.; Allan, J.; Coe, H.; Zhao, Y.; Goldstein, A. H.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nObservations during CalNex and Cal-Mex field campaigns at Bakersfield, Pasadena, Tijuana, and on board the R/V Atlantis show a substantial contribution of fossil fuel emissions to the ambient particle organic mass (OM). At least two fossil fuel combustion (FFC) factors with a range of contributions of oxidized organic functional groups were identified at each site and accounted for 60-88% of the total OM. Additional marine, vegetative detritus, and biomass burning or biogenic sources contribute up to 40% of the OM. Comparison of the FTIR spectra of four different unburned fossil fuels (gasoline, diesel, motor oil, and ship diesel) with PMF factors from ambient samples shows absorbance peaks from the fuels are retained in organic aerosols, with the spectra of all of the FFC factors containing at least three of the four characteristic alkane peaks observed in fuel standards at 2954, 2923, 2869 and 2855 cm-1. Based on this spectral similarity, we estimate the primary OM from FFC sources for each site to be 16-20%, with secondary FFC OM accounting for an additional 42-62%. Two other methods for estimating primary OM that use carbon monoxide (CO) and elemental carbon (EC) as tracers of primary organic mass were investigated, but both approaches were problematic for the CalNex and Cal-Mex urban sites because they were influenced by multiple emission sources that had site-specific and variable initial ratios to OM. For example, using the ÎPOM/ÎCO ratio of 0.0094 Î¼g ppb V-1 proposed by other studies produces unrealistically high estimates of primary FFC OM of 55-100%.\n\nCal-Bridge and CAMPARE: Engaging Underrepresented Students in Physics and Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRudolph, Alexander L.; Smecker-Hane, Tammy A.; Cal-Bridge Team; CAMPARE Team\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe describe two programs, Cal-Bridge and CAMPARE, with the common mission of increasing participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in astronomy, through summer research opportunities, in the case of CAMPARE, scholarships in the case of Cal-Bridge, and significant mentoring in both programs, creating a national impact on their numbers successfully pursuing a PhD in the field.

We report here a severe defect of neuromuscular transmission in a consanguineous patient with a homozygous variant in the laminin alpha-5 subunit gene (LAMA5). The variant c.8046C>T (p.Arg2659Trp) is rare and has a predicted deleterious effect. The affected individual, who also carries a rare homozygous sequence variant in LAMA1, had muscle weakness, myopia, and facial tics. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed mild volume loss and periventricular T2 prolongation. Repetitive nerve stimulation revealed 50% decrement of compound muscle action potential amplitudes and 250% facilitation immediately after exercise, Endplate studies identified a profound reduction of the endplate potential quantal content and endplates with normal postsynaptic folding that were denuded or partially occupied by small nerve terminals. Expression studies revealed that p.Arg2659Trp caused decreased binding of laminin alpha-5 to SV2A and impaired laminin-521 cell-adhesion and cell projection support in primary neuronal cultures. In summary, this report describing severe neuromuscular transmission failure in a patient with a LAMA5 mutation expands the list of phenotypes associated with defects in genes encoding alpha-laminins.

The graduation rate among CAMPARE scholars is 97%, and of the 37 CAMPARE scholars who have graduated with a Bachelor's degree, almost 60% (21) have completed or are pursuing graduate education in astronomy or a related field, at institutions including UCLA, USC, UC Riverside, Stanford, Univ. of Rochester, Georgia Tech, Kent State, Indiana Univ., Univ. of Oregon, Syracuse, and the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to-PhD program. The Cal-Bridge program is a CSU-UC Bridge program comprised of faculty form 5 University of California (UC), 8 California State University (CSU), and 8 California Community College (CCC) campuses in Southern California. Cal-Bridge provides much deeper mentoring and professional development experiences over the last two years of undergraduate and first year of graduate school to students from this diverse network of higher education institutions. Cal-Bridge Scholars benefit from financial support, intensive, joint mentoring by CSU and UC faculty, professional development workshops, and exposure to research opportunities at the participating UC campuses.\n\nLong-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) plus long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) versus LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nPubMed\n\nHorita, Nobuyuki; Goto, Atsushi; Shibata, Yuji; Ota, Erika; Nakashima, Kentaro; Nagai, Kenjiro; Kaneko, Takeshi\n\n2017-02-10\n\nThree classes of inhaler medications are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). When two classes of medications are required, LAMA plus LABA (LAMA+LABA) and LABA plus ICS (LABA+ICS) are often selected because these combinations can be administered via a single medication device. The previous Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidance recommended LABA+ICS as the first-line treatment for managing stable COPD in high-risk people of categories C and D. However, the updated GOLD 2017 guidance recommends LAMA+LABA over LABA+ICS. To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of people with stable COPD. We performed an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (2 February 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (4 June 2016), and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal (4 June 2016), followed by a handsearch (5 June 2016). Two review authors screened and scrutinised the selected articles. We included individual randomised controlled trials, parallel-group trials, and cross-over trials comparing LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS for stable COPD. The minimum accepted trial duration was one month and trials should have been conducted in an outpatient setting. Two review authors independently extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR), and continuous data as mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI) using Review Manager 5. Exacerbations were measured by counting the number of people experiencing one or more exacerbation. We included 11 studies comprising 9839 participants in our quantitative analysis. Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD, without recent exacerbations.

B.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe CalWater 2015 field experiment was conducted between January and March and consisted of more than fifty science flights, a major research cruise, and continuous ground-based observations coordinated to study phenomena driving the incidence of extreme precipitation events and the variability of water supply along the West Coast of the United States. CalWater 2015 examined key processes linked to (1) atmospheric rivers (ARs) in delivering much of the precipitation associated with major winter storms, and (2) aerosols, originating from local sources as well as from remote continents, within and between storms and their modulating effects on precipitation on the U.S. West Coast. As part of a large interagency field effort including NOAA, DOE, NASA, NSF, and the Naval Research Laboratory, four research aircraft from three government agencies were deployed in coordination with the oceangoing NOAA Ronald H. Brown and were equipped with meteorological and chemical observing systems in near-shore regions of California and the eastern Pacific. At the same time, ground-based measurements from NOAA's HydroMeteorological Testbed (HMT) network on the U.S. West Coast and a major NSF-supported observing site for aerosols and microphysics at Bodega Bay, California provided continuous near surface-level meteorological and chemical observations, respectively, during CalWater 2015. The DOE-sponsored ARM Cloud Aerosol and Precipitation Experiment (ACAPEX) was executed in close coordination with NOAA and NASA facilities and deployed airborne and ship-based observing systems. This presentation summarizes the objectives, implementation strategy, data acquisitions, and some preliminary results from CalWater 2015 addressing science gaps associated with (1) the evolution and structure of ARs including cloud and precipitation processes and air-sea interaction, and (2) aerosol interaction with ARs and the impact on precipitation, including locally-generated aerosol effects on orographic\n\nThe X-ray eclipse of the LMC binary CAL 87\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchmidtke, P.

M.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nROSAT-PSPC observations of the LMC eclipsing binary CAL 87 show a short-duration, shallow X-ray eclipse which coincides in phase with the primary optical minimum. Characteristics of the eclipse suggest the X-ray emitting region is only partially occulted. Similarities with the eclipse of the accretion-disk corona in X 1822-37 are discussed. However, no temperature variation through eclipse is found for CAL 87.

Clinical studies combining different classes of bronchodilators, in particular a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and a long-acting Î²2-agonist (LABA), have demonstrated greater improvements in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1) in patients with COPD than monotherapy. FEV1 has served as an important diagnostic measurement of COPD, and the majority of clinical studies of currently available pharmacotherapies grade effectiveness of treatment regimens based on improvements in FEV1. However, FEV1 alone may not adequately reflect the overall health status of the patient. Published evidence suggests that LABA/LAMA combination therapies demonstrate greater improvements in patient-centred outcomes such as dyspnoea, symptoms, rescue medication use, and quality of life than individual drugs used alone. Evaluating patient-centred outcomes associated with COPD is likely to play an important role in future research as a measure of overall treatment effectiveness. Raising awareness of the importance of outcomes beyond lung function alone, particularly in primary care where most patients initially present themselves for medical evaluation, should form a fundamental part of a more holistic approach to COPD management.\n\nCubiCal - Fast radio interferometric calibration suite exploiting complex optimisation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKenyon, J. S.; Smirnov, O. M.; Grobler, T. L.; Perkins, S. J.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIt has recently been shown that radio interferometric gain calibration can be expressed succinctly in the language of complex optimisation. In addition to providing an elegant framework for further development, it exposes properties of the calibration problem which can be exploited to accelerate traditional non-linear least squares solvers such as Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt. We extend existing derivations to chains of Jones terms: products of several gains which model different aberrant effects. In doing so, we find that the useful properties found in the single term case still hold. We also develop several specialised solvers which deal with complex gains parameterised by real values. The newly developed solvers have been implemented in a Python package called CubiCal, which uses a combination of Cython, multiprocessing and shared memory to leverage the power of modern hardware. We apply CubiCal to both simulated and real data, and perform both direction-independent and direction-dependent self-calibration. Finally, we present the results of some rudimentary profiling to show that CubiCal is competitive with respect to existing calibration tools such as MeqTrees.\n\nLens-Aided Multi-Angle Spectroscopy (LAMAS) Reveals Small-Scale Outflow Structure in Quasars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGreen, Paul J.\n\n2006-06-01\n\nSpectral differences between lensed quasar image components are common. Since lensing is intrinsically achromatic, these differences are typically explained as the effect of either microlensing, or as light path time delays sampling intrinsic quasar spectral variability. Here we advance a novel third hypothesis: some spectral differences are due to small line-of-sight differences through quasar disk wind outflows. In particular, we propose that variable spectral differences seen only in component A of the widest separation lens SDSS J1004+4112 are due to differential absorption along the sight lines. The absorber properties required by this hypothesis are akin to known broad absorption line (BAL) outflows but must have a broader, smoother velocity profile. We interpret the observed C IV emission-line variability as further evidence for spatial fine structure transverse to the line of sight. Since outflows are likely to be rotating, such absorber fine structure can consistently explain some of the UV and X-ray variability seen in AGNs. The implications are many: (1) Spectroscopic differences in other lensed objects may be due to this ``lens-aided multi-angle spectroscopy'' (LAMAS). (2) Outflows have fine structure on size scales of arcseconds, as seen from the nucleus. (3) Assuming either broad absorption line region sizes proposed in recent wind models, or typically assumed continuum emission region sizes, LAMAS and/or variability provide broadly consistent absorber size scale estimates of ~1015 cm. (4) Very broad smooth absorption may be ubiquitous in quasar spectra, even when no obvious troughs are seen.\n\nTheraCal LC: From Biochemical and Bioactive Properties to Clinical Applications\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRabi, Tarek\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground Direct pulp capping is a popular treatment modality among dentists. TheraCal LC is a calcium silicate-based material that is designed as a direct/indirect pulp capping material. The material might be very attractive for clinicians because of its ease of handling. Unlike other calcium silicate-based materials, TheraCal LC is resin-based and does not require any conditioning of the dentine surface. The material can be bonded with different types of adhesives directly after application. There has been considerable research performed on this material since its launching; however, there are no review articles that collates information and data obtained from these studies. This review discusses the various characteristics of the material with the aim of establishing a better understanding for its clinical use. Methods A search was conducted using search engines (PubMed and Cochrane databases) in addition to reference mining of the articles that was used to locate other papers. The process of searching for the relevant studies was performed using the keywords pulp protection, pulp capping, TheraCal, and calcium silicates. Only articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals were included in the review. Conclusion This review underlines the fact that further in vitro and in vivo studies are required before TheraCal LC can be used as a direct pulp capping material. PMID:29785184\n\nNavy CALS Vision.

W.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) California Volcano Observatory (CalVO) aims to advance scientific understanding of volcanic processes and to lessen harmful impacts of volcanic activity in California and Nevada. Within CalVO's area of responsibility, ten volcanoes or volcanic centers have been identified by a national volcanic threat assessment in support of developing the U.S. National Volcano Early Warning System (NVEWS) as posing moderate, high, or very high threats to surrounding communities based on their recent eruptive histories and their proximity to vulnerable people, property, and infrastructure. To better understand the extent of potential hazards at these and other volcanoes and volcanic centers, the USGS Volcano Science Center (VSC) is continually compiling spatial databases of volcano information, including: geologic mapping, hazards assessment maps, locations of geochemical and geochronological samples, and the distribution of volcanic vents. This digital mapping effort has been ongoing for over 15 years and early databases are being converted to match recent datasets compiled with new data models designed for use in: 1) generating hazard zones, 2) evaluating risk to population and infrastructure, 3) numerical hazard modeling, and 4) display and query on the CalVO as well as other VSC and USGS websites. In these capacities, spatial databases of CalVO volcanoes and their derivative map products provide an integrated and readily accessible framework of VSC hazards science to colleagues, emergency managers, and the general public.\n\nM2 .50-cal.

The 1861 event and two other earthquakes (Ms = 5.7 in 1929 and Ms = 5.6 in 1967) were generated on the Cal thrust fault, which extends over a distance of 31 km north-south and runs straight through the center of Mendoza. In the city, which has now more than 1 million inhabitants, the fault forms a 3-m-high fault scarp. Although the Cal thrust fault poses a serious seismic hazard, the paleoseismologic history of this fault and its long-term slip rate remains largely unknown (Mingorance, 2006). We present the first results of an ongoing paleoseismologic study of the Cal thrust at a site located 5 km north of Mendoza. Here, the fault offsets Late Holocene alluvial fan sediments by 2.5 m vertically and exhibits a well developed fault scarp. A 15-m-long and 2-3-m-deep trench across the scarp reveals three east-vergent folds that we interpret to have formed during three earthquakes. Successive retrodeformation of the two youngest folds suggests that the most recent event (presumably the 1861 earthquake) caused ~1.1 m of vertical offset and ~1.8 m of horizontal shortening. For the penultimate event we obtain a vertical offset of ~0.7 m and a horizontal shortening of ~1.9 m. A vertical displacement of ~0.7 m observed on a steeply west-dipping fault may be associated with an older event. The cumulative vertical offset of 2.5 m for the three inferred events is in excellent agreement with the height of the scarp. Based on the retrodeformation of the trench deposits the fault plane dips ~25Â° to the west. In the deepest part of the trench evidence for even older seismic events is preserved beneath an angular unconformity that was formed during a period of erosion and pre-dates the present-day scarp.

Version 4.0(Beta)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMcKone, T.E.; Enoch, K.G.\n\n2002-08-01\n\nCalTOX has been developed as a set of spreadsheet models and spreadsheet data sets to assist in assessing human exposures from continuous releases to multiple environmental media, i.e. air, soil, and water. It has also been used for waste classification and for setting soil clean-up levels at uncontrolled hazardous wastes sites. The modeling components of CalTOX include a multimedia transport and transformation model, multi-pathway exposure scenario models, and add-ins to quantify and evaluate uncertainty and variability. All parameter values used as inputs to CalTOX are distributions, described in terms of mean values and a coefficient of variation, rather than asmoreÂ Â» point estimates or plausible upper values such as most other models employ. This probabilistic approach allows both sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to be directly incorporated into the model operation. This manual provides CalTOX users with a brief overview of the CalTOX spreadsheet model and provides instructions for using the spreadsheet to make deterministic and probabilistic calculations of source-dose-risk relationships.Â«Â less\n\nDelayed deglaciation or extreme Arctic conditions 21-16 cal. kyr at southeastern Laurentide Ice Sheet margin?\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPeteet, D.

Atlantic, showing significant freshwater input and sea level rise only after 19 cal kyr with a cold meltwater lid, perhaps delaying ice melt.Â«Â less\n\nHot deformation behaviors and processing maps of B{sub 4}C/Al6061 neutron absorber composites\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLi, Yu-Li\n\nIn this study, the hot deformation behaviors of 30 wt.% B{sub 4}C/Al6061 neutron absorber composites (NACs) have been investigated by conducting isothermal compression tests at temperatures ranging from 653 K to 803 K and strain rates from 0.01 to 10 s{sup â1}. It was found that, during hot compression, the B{sub 4}C/Al6061 NACs exhibited a steady flow characteristic which can be expressed by the Zener-Hollomon parameter as a hyperbolic-sine function of flow stress. High average activation energy (185.62 kJ/mol) of B{sub 4}C/Al6061 NACs is noted in current study owing to the high content of B{sub 4}C particle. The optimum hotmoreÂ Â» working conditions for B{sub 4}C/Al6061 NACs are found to be 760â803 K/0.01â0.05 s{sup â1} based on processing map and microstructure evolution. Typical material instabilities are thought to be attributed to void formation, adiabatic shear bands (ASB), particle debonding, and matrix cracking. Finally, the effect of the plastic deformation zones (PDZs) on the microstructure evolution in this 30 wt.% B{sub 4}C/Al6061 composite is found to be very important. - Highlights: â¢The hot deformation behavior of the 30 wt.% B{sub 4}C/Al6061 NACs was first analyzed. â¢The 3D efficiency map and the instability map are developed. â¢The optimum hot working conditions were identified and validated by SEM and TEM. â¢The hot deformation schematic diagram of 30 wt.% B{sub 4}C/Al6061 NACs is developed.Â«Â less\n\n78 FR 1252 - CalAmp Wireless Networks Corporation (CWNC), Satellite Products Division, Including On-Site...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-01-08\n\n...

Human blood-derived pDCs have been reported to be refractory to ex vivo LCMV infection. In the present study we show that human pDC CAL-1 cells are refractory to infection with cell-free LCMV, but highly susceptible to infection with recombinant LCMVs carrying the surface glycoprotein of VSV, indicating that LCMV infection of CAL-1 cells is restricted at the cell entry step. Co-culture of uninfected CAL-1 cells with LCMV-infected HEK293 cells enabled LCMV to infect CAL-1 cells. This cell-to-cell spread required direct cell-cell contact and did not involve exosome pathway. Our findings indicate the presence of a novel entry pathway utilized by LCMV to infect pDC.
