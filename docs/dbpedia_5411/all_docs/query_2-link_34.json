        "text": "Increasingly, society and standards require &quot;risk-informed&quot; decisions. The paper demonstrates the benefits of implementing reliability and risk concepts in dam engineering as a complement to conventional deterministic analyses. Reliability evaluations can range from qualitative estimates, to simple statistical evaluations, to full probabilistic modelling of the hazards and consequences for a system of dams. The paper gives an overview of basic concepts of reliability-based approaches and illustrates their use with three case studies. The paper discusses the strengths of reliability-based analyses and key issues such as tolerable and acceptable risk, the meaning of factor of safety, the targets for a margin of safety and the selection of characteristic value for analysis. Reliability-based approaches provide useful insight and complementary information. They enable the analysis of complex uncertainties in a systematic and more complete manner than deterministic analyses alo...\n\nhttps://www.ijert.org/geotechnical-uncertainties-and-reliability-theory-applications https://www.ijert.org/research/geotechnical-uncertainties-and-reliability-theory-applications-IJERTV1IS6207.pdf Slope engineering is nowadays in great demand of proper risk management. Predictions regarding slope performances are subjugated by uncertainties. This includes uncertainties related to soil properties, model uncertainties and human uncertainties. In this study author discusses reliability analysis principles in relation with conventional practices and to prove its efficiency three case studies of Malaysian slope failures has been taken for further clarification. It is also mentioned that the concluded probability of failure still needs more refinement as no human uncertainties has been considered in this probabilistic analysis. Probabilistic analysis afford greater insight into design reliability, hence, supporting the engineering judgment and recuperating the decision making process. So, the intelligibility, effortlessness and cost/time effectiveness are indispensable essentials in order to successfully express and commune a probabilistic methodology to practicing engineers .\n\nThis paper proposes a new probabilistic methodology for analyzing the stability of Earth Dams, based on the technique of the First Order Reliability Method for Structural Reliability. Differently from others methodologies present in literature, the proposed method interprets the involved variables as random ones. So, three results are provided here: the Structural Reliability Index, the Probability of Rupture and the most probable values of the random variables for the occurrence of a dam break. In order to illustrate it, real data from a cross section of the Left Bank Earthfill Dam of Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant (IHPP), located on the city of Foz do Iguaçu, Paraná, Brazil were used. The numerical results achieved by the proposed methodology evidence that IHPP dam has currently good structural conditions, confirming that the safety procedures adopted in Itaipu Dam may be considered as appropriate. The use of the proposed method enables to complement the previously existing knowledge about the structural conditions, improving the process of risk management."
