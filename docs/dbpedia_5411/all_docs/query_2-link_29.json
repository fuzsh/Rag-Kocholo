For that reason, an intensive search for new, effective anistaphyloccocal agents can currently be observed worldwide. In recent years, there has been growing interest in nanoparticles, as compounds with potential antibacterial effect. The antibacterial activity of silver containing substances has been well recognized, but thoughtful studies focused on the effect of silver nanoparticles on bacterial biofilm are scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with particle sizes in the range between 10 and 100 nm, and a concentration range from 1 to 10 µg/mL, upon Staphylococcus epidermidis strains with different biofilm-forming abilities (BFAs). The studies revealed the highest level of antimicrobial activity for AgNPs in relation to S. epidermidis strains with BFA, and what is more, the observed effect was proportional to the increasing particles’ size, and strains not forming biofilm were more susceptible to silver nanoparticles with the smallest examined size, which was 10 nm.

Nanodispersion and stabilization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were achieved via non-covalent adsorption and with an organic polymeric dispersant and inorganic carbon-based nanomaterials—nano-carbon black (CB), carbon nanotubes (CNT), and graphene oxide (GO). The new polymeric dispersant—polyisobutylene-b-poly(oxyethylene)-b-polyisobutylene (PIB-POE-PIB) triblock copolymer—could stabilize AgNPs. Simultaneously, this stabilization was conducted through the addition of mixed organic/inorganic dispersants based on zero- (0D), one- (1D), and two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, namely CB, CNT, and GO. Furthermore, the dispersion solution was evenly coated/mixed onto polymeric substrates, and the products were heated. As a result, highly conductive thin-film materials (with a surface electrical resistance of approximately 10−2 Ω/sq) were eventually acquired. The results indicated that 2D carbon-based nanomaterials (GO) could stabilize AgNPs more effectively during their reductNion and, hence, generate particles with the smallest sizes, as the COO− functional groups of GO are evenly distributed. The optimal AgNPs/PIB-POE-PIB/GO ratio was 20:20:1. Furthermore, the flexible electrode layers were successfully manufactured and applied in wearable electronic sensors to generate electrocardiograms (ECGs). ECGs were, thereafter, successfully obtained.

Protein self-assembly enables atomic scale precision over the final architecture, with a remarkable diversity of structures and functionalities. Self-assembling protein nanovaccines are associated with numerous advantages, including biocompatibility, stability, molecular specificity and multivalency. Owing to their nanoscale size, proteinaceous nature, symmetrical organization and repetitive antigen display, protein assemblies closely mimic most invading pathogens, serving as danger signals for the immune system. Elucidating how the structural and physicochemical properties of the assemblies modulate the potency and the polarization of the immune responses is critical for bottom-up design of vaccines. In this context, this review briefly covers the fundamentals of supramolecular interactions involved in protein self-assembly and presents the strategies to design and functionalize these assemblies. Examples of advanced nanovaccines are presented, and properties of protein supramolecular structures enabling modulation of the immune responses are discussed. Combining the understanding of the self-assembly process at the molecular level with knowledge regarding the activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses will support the design of safe and effective nanovaccines.

The influence of post-growth annealing modes on the electroforming voltage and the resistive switching effect in ZnO nanocrystalline films is investigated. We demonstrated that nanocrystalline zinc oxide films, fabricated at certain regimes, show the electroforming-free resistive switching. It was shown, that the forming-free nanocrystalline ZnO film demonstrated a resistive switching effect and switched at a voltage 1.9 ± 0.2 V from 62.42 ± 6.47 (RHRS) to 0.83 ± 0.06 kΩ (RLRS). The influence of ZnO surface morphology on the resistive switching effect is experimentally investigated. It was shown, that the ZnO nanocrystalline film exhibits a stable resistive switching effect, which is weakly dependent on its nanoscale structure. The influence of technological parameters on the resistive switching effect in a forming-free ZnO nanocrystalline film is investigated. The results can be used for fabrication of new-generation micro- and nanoelectronics elements, including random resistive memory (ReRAM) elements for neuromorphic structures based on forming-free ZnO nanocrystalline films.

We introduced a novel group IV side-emitting laser at a wavelength of 1550 nm based on a 3-layer Ge/Si quantum well (QW). By designing this scheme, we showed that the structural, electronic, and optical properties are excited for lasing at 1550 nm. The preliminary results show that the device can produce a good light spot shape convenient for direct coupling with the waveguide and single-mode light emission. The laser luminous power can reach up to 2.32 mW at a wavelength of 1550 nm with a 300-mA current. Moreover, at room temperature (300 K), the laser can maintain maximum light power and an ideal wavelength (1550 nm). Thus, this study provides a novel approach to reliable, efficient electrically pumped silicon-based lasers.

The TiO2–Bi2O3 composite rods with β-Bi2O3 phase and α/β-Bi2O3 dual-phase decoration layers were designed, respectively, via in situ radio-frequency magnetron sputtering growth and post-annealing procedures in ambient air. The crystal structure, surface morphology, and photo-absorption performances of the pristine TiO2 rods decorated with various Bi2O3 phases were investigated. The crystal structure analysis reveals that the crystalline TiO2–Bi2O3 rods contained β-Bi2O3 and α/β-Bi2O3 crystallites were separately formed on the TiO2 rod templates with different synthesis approaches. The morphology analysis demonstrates that the β-Bi2O3 coverage layer on the crystalline rutile TiO2 rods showed flat layer morphology; however, the surface morphology of the α/β-Bi2O3 dual-phase coverage layer on the TiO2 rods exhibited a sheet-like feature. The results of photocatalytic decomposition towards methyl orange dyes show that the substantially improved photoactivity of the rutile TiO2 rods was achieved by decorating a thin sheet-like α/β-Bi2O3 coverage layer. The effectively photoinduced charge separation efficiency in the stepped energy band configuration in the composite rods made from the TiO2 and α/β-Bi2O3 explained their markedly improved photoactivity. The TiO2-α/β-Bi2O3 composite rods are promising for use as photocatalysts and photoelectrodes.

The aggregation of the same type of bacteria leads to biofilm formation on the delicate tissue, dental plaque, and skin. In the present investigation, a Graphene (Gr)-based nano-formulation containing Curcumin (C.C.M.) and Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) showed a wide range of anti-microbial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm and demonstrated the anti-microbial mechanism of action. The anti-microbial effect of GrZnO nanocomposites, i.e., GrZnO-NCs, suggests that the integrated graphene-based nanocomposites effectively suppressed both sensitive as well as MRSA ATCC 43300 and BAA-1708 isolates. The S. aureus inhibitory effect of GrZnO-NCs improved >5-fold when combined with C.C.M., and demonstrated a M.I.C. of 31.25 µg/mL contrasting with the GrZnO-NCs or C.C.M. alone having M.I.C. value of 125 µg/mL each. The combination treatment of GrZnO-NCs or C.C.M. inhibited the M.R.S.A. topical dermatitis infection in a mice model with a significant decrease in the CFU count to ~64%. Interestingly, the combination of C.C.M. and GrZnO-NCs damaged the bacterial cell wall structure, resulting in cytoplasm spillage, thereby diminishing their metabolism. Thus, owing to the ease of synthesis and highly efficient anti-microbial properties, the present graphene-based curcumin nano-formulations can cater to a new treatment methodology against M.R.S.A.

Nanomaterials have attracted much attention due to the special properties they have over their bulk form. We studied nanostructured copper (Cu-NPs), investigating the potential for improved antifungal properties derived from its special properties and studied any effect that the oxidation of copper (CuO-NPs) may have. We conducted this research against Colletotrichum gloeoesporioides, a devastating pathogen to plants/crops worldwide. Research on the effects of copper on this fungus are limited. Our studies showed that nanoforms of copper had significant antifungal activities, with Cu-NPs offering the most sustainable efficacy and was more effective than its oxidative form (CuO-NPs). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the treated pathogen show that the hyphae had a swollen appearance, lost their filamentous structure, and the mycelia had a powder-like structure, indicating the probable destruction of the hyphal tubular cell wall. X-ray Difractogram (XRD) outputs showed substantial changes in the physical characteristics of the Cu-NPs after interaction with the fungus. This is the first report to demonstrate chemo-physical changes in the metal compounds, opening new insights for further studies on the mechanism of copper’s antifungal properties.

The catalysts were characterized by a set of physicochemical methods (X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction by H2, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, crushing strength) and tested in the oxidation of CO and burning of brown coal in a fluidized bed. It was found that the catalysts have high mechanical strength (16.2 MPa), and their catalytic properties in the oxidation of CO are comparable to the characteristics of industrial Cr-containing catalysts. It was shown that the addition of pseudoboehmite at the stage of drop formation contributes to the production of uniform spherical high-strength granules and facilitates the stabilization of the phase state of the active component. The use of CuFeAl nanocomposite catalysts for the burning of brown coal provides a low emission of CO (600 ppm) and NOx (220 ppm) and a high degree of coal burnout (95%), which are close to those of the industrial Cr-containing catalysts (emission of CO is 700 ppm, NOx—230 ppm, and degree of coal burnout is 95%).

Herein, we show some properties of a candidate antifungal nanocomposite made from copper oxide (CuO; otherwise an essential soil nutrient) nanoparticles (NPs), with definite size and shape, decorating the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets. The successful preparation of the rGO-CuO NPs was confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic analyses, and its antifungal activity against wild strains of Fusarium oxysporum affecting tomato and pepper plants was successfully confirmed. A comparative analysis in vitro indicated that this nanocomposite had higher antifungal activity at only 1 mg/L than the conventional fungicide Kocide 2000 at 2.5 g/L. Further investigation suggested that rGO-CuO NPs creates pits and pores on the fungal cell membranes inducing cell death. In planta results indicated that only 1 mg/L from the nanocomposite is required to reduce Fusarium wilt and root rot diseases severity below 5% for tomato and pepper plants without any phytotoxicity for about 70 days. Comparatively, 2.5 g/L of Kocide 2000 are required to achieve about 30% disease reduction in both plants. The present study contributes to the concept of agro-nanotechnology, showing the properties of a novel ecofriendly and economic nanopesticide for sustainable plant protection.

First, the Raman reporter 4-Aminothiophenol (4-ATP) and DNA (partially complementary to AFB1 aptamer) were attached to the surface of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) by chemical bonding to form a 4-ATP-AgNPs-DNA complex. Similarly, the surface of a PAA membrane was functionalized with an AFB1 aptamer. Then, the PAA surface was functionalized with 4-ATP-AgNPs-DNA through base complementary pairing to form AgNPs-PAA sensor with a strong Raman signal. When AFB1 was added, AgNPs would be detached from the PAA surface because of the specific binding between AFB1 and the aptamer, resulting in a reduction in Raman signals. The detection limit of the proposed biosensor is 0.009 ng/mL in actual walnut and the linear range is 0.01–10 ng/mL. The sensor has good selectivity and repeatability; it can be applied to the rapid qualitative and quantitative detection of AFB1.

This represents a significant societal and economic burden. Staff training, hand hygiene, patient identification and isolation and controlled antibiotic use are some of the standard ways to reduce HAI incidence but this is time consuming and subject and subject to rigorous implementation. In addition, the lack of antimicrobial activity of some disinfectants against healthcare-associated pathogens may also affect the efficacy of disinfection practices. Textiles are an attractive substrate for pathogens because of contact with the human body with the attendant warmth and moisture. Textiles and surfaces coated with engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have shown considerable promise in reducing the microbial burden on those surfaces. Studies have also shown that this antimicrobial affect can reduce the incidence of HAIs. For all of the promising research, there has been an absence of study on the economic effectiveness of ENM coated materials in a healthcare setting. This article examines the relative economic efficacy of ENM coated materials against an antiseptic approach. The goal is to establish the economic efficacy of the widespread usage of ENM coated materials in a healthcare setting. In the absence of detailed and segregated costs, benefits and control variables over at least cross sectional data or time series, an aggregated approach is warranted. This approach, while relying on some supposition allows for a comparison with similar data regarding standard treatment to reduce HAIs and provides a reasonable economic comparison. We find that while, relative to antiseptics, ENM coated textiles represent a significant clinical advantage, they can also offer considerable cost savings.

The synthesis process was empirically modeled and optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). Input variables adopted for optimization dealt with the weight ratio of precursors (r) and the sonication time (t), representing the used factors in the synthesis procedure. With regard to application, the synthesized TiO2 samples were tested for the photodegradation of two water-soluble organic pollutants under UV–Vis irradiation. Optimal conditions for the efficient pollutants’ photodegradation were found to involve a precursors ratio of 3 and a sonication time of 60 min. Thus, the M5 sample prepared under the founded optimal conditions yielded the maximal removal efficiencies of 98.4% and 46.3% for the photodegradation of CR dye and 2,4-D herbicide, respectively. In addition, the photodegradation kinetics revealed the pseudo first-order rate constants, showing the photodegradation of CR (k1 = 8.86 × 10−2 min−1) by M5 sample is about 1.3-fold faster than the photodegradation of 2,4-D pesticide (k2 = 6.84 × 10−2 min−1).

A selective and sensitive colorimetric probe for the determination of streptomycin and kanamycin was proposed based on chlortetracycline-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs–CTC) as the sensing element. Almost all of the tested aminoglycoside antibiotics can rapidly induce the aggregation of AgNPs, along with a color change from yellow to orange/red. The selective detection of aminoglycoside antibiotics, including tobramycin, streptomycin, amikacin, gentamicin, neomycin, and kanamycin, with other types of antibiotics, can be achieved by ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy. This developed colorimetric assay has ability to detect various AMGs using in-depth surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies. With this determination of streptomycin and kanamycin was achieved at the picomolar level (pM) by using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. Under aqueous conditions, the linear range of the colorimetric sensor for streptomycin and kanamycin was 1000–1,1000 and 120–480 pM, respectively. The corresponding limit of detection was 2000 pM and 120 pM, respectively. Thus, the validated dual colorimetric and ratiometric method can find various analytical applications for the ultrasensitive and rapid detection of AMG antibiotics in water samples.

Nanosized photocatalyts were prepared from TiO2-P25 by wet impregnation, and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and adsorption studies. No oxide phases of the metal dopants were found, although their presence in the TiO2-P25 lattice induces tensile strain in Cu-impregnated TiO2-P25, whereas compressive strain in Cr- and V-impregnated TiO2-P25. Experimental evidences support chemical and mechanical stability of the photocatalysts. Type IV N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, with a small H3 loop near the maximum relative pressure were observed. Metal surface impregnated photocatalysts are mesoporous with a similar surface roughness, and a narrow pore distribution around ca. 25 Å. They were chemically stable, showing no metal lixiviation. Their photocatalytic activity was followed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and HPLC–UV. A first order kinetic model appropriately fitted the experimental data. The fastest phenol degradation was obtained with M (0.1%)/TiO2-P25, the reactivity order being Cu > V >> Cr > TiO2-P25 under 366 nm irradiation, while TiO2-P25 > Cu > V > Cr, when using 254 nm radiation. TOC removal under 366 nm irradiation for 300 min showed almost quantitative mineralization for all tested materials, while 254 nm irradiation for 60 min led to maximal TOC removal (ca. 30%). Photoproducts and intermediate photoproducts were identified by HPLC–MS, and appropriate reaction pathways are proposed. The energy efficiency of the process was analysed, showing UV lamps are superior to UVA lamps, and that the efficiency of the surface impregnated catalyst varies in the order Cu > V > Cr.

Therefore, several in vitro and in vivo studies have addressed their safety evaluation. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge regarding their potential detrimental effect on human kidney. To evaluate this effect, AuNPs with different sizes (13 nm and 60 nm), shapes (spheres and stars), and coated with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) or with sodium citrate, were synthesized, characterized, and their toxicological effects evaluated 24 h after incubation with a proximal tubular cell line derived from normal human kidney (HK-2). After exposure, viability was assessed by the MTT assay. Changes in lysosomal integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), reactive species (ROS/RNS), intracellular glutathione (total GSH), and ATP were also evaluated. Apoptosis was investigated through the evaluation of the activity of caspases 3, 8 and 9. Overall, the tested AuNPs targeted mainly the mitochondria in a concentration-dependent manner. The lysosomal integrity was also affected but to a lower extent. The smaller 13 nm nanospheres (both citrate- and MUA-coated) proved to be the most toxic among all types of AuNPs, increasing ROS production and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (p ≤ 0.01). For the MUA-coated 13 nm nanospheres, these effects were associated also to increased levels of total glutathione (p ≤ 0.01) and enhanced ATP production (p ≤ 0.05). Programmed cell death was detected through the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (caspase 8 and 9) (p ≤ 0.05). We found that the larger 60 nm AuNPs, both nanospheres and nanostars, are apparently less toxic than their smaller counter parts. Considering the results herein presented, it should be taken into consideration that even if renal clearance of the AuNPs is desirable, since it would prevent accumulation and detrimental effects in other organs, a possible intracellular accumulation of AuNPs in kidneys can induce cell damage and later compromise kidney function.

In this study, the memristive switching characteristics of a nitride-based device with two amorphous layers (SiN/BN) is investigated. We demonstrate the coexistence of filamentary (abrupt) and interface (homogeneous) switching of Ni/SiN/BN/n++-Si devices. A better gradual conductance modulation is achieved for interface-type switching as compared with filamentary switching for an artificial synaptic device using appropriate voltage pulse stimulations. The improved classification accuracy for the interface switching (85.6%) is confirmed and compared to the accuracy of the filamentary switching mode (75.1%) by a three-layer neural network (784 × 128 × 10). Furthermore, the spike-timing-dependent plasticity characteristics of the synaptic device are also demonstrated. The results indicate the possibility of achieving an artificial synapse with a bilayer SiN/BN structure.

Moreover, since the inert shell surrounding the luminescent active core allows for dispersal of the nanoparticles in water and biological compatible fluids, we investigated the penetration depth that can be realized in biological tissues with their emissions in the NIR range, achieving a value of 0.8 mm when excited at powers of 50 mW. After their internalization in HeLa cells, a low toxicity was observed and the potentiality for biolabelling in the visible range was demonstrated, which facilitated the identification of the location of the nanoparticles inside the cells, and the temperature determination.

The nickel carcinogenicity is known to be dependent on the chemical form of nickel, since only certain nickel compounds can enter the cell. This study investigates, for the first time, the cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and molecular targets of nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) in human skin cells in comparison with other chemical forms of nickel. The dose-response curve that was obtained for NiNPs in the cytotoxicity assays showed a linear behavior typical of genotoxic carcinogens. The exposure of keratinocytes to NiNPs leads to the release of Ni2+ ions and its accumulation in the cytosol. A 6 kDa nickel-binding molecule was found to be synthesized by cells exposed to NiNPs at a dose corresponding to medium mortality. This molecule was identified to be tumor-related p63-regulated gene 1 protein.

As conventional MFNs usually show low heating efficiency with a lower specific loss power (SLP), extensive efforts to enhance the SLP of MFNs have been made by varying the particle compositions, sizes, and structures. In this study, we attempted to increase the SLP values by creating core-shell structures of MFNs. Accordingly, first we synthesized three different types of core ferrite nanoparticle of magnetite (mag), cobalt ferrite (cf) and zinc cobalt ferrite (zcf). Secondly, we synthesized eight bi-magnetic core-shell structured MFNs; Fe3O4@CoFe2O4 (mag@cf1, mag@cf2), CoFe2O4@Fe3O4 (cf@mag1, cf@mag2), Fe3O4@ZnCoFe2O4 (mag@zcf1, mag@zcf2), and ZnCoFe2O4@Fe3O4 (zcf@mag1, zcf@mag2), using a modified controlled co-precipitation process. SLP values of the prepared core-shell MFNs were investigated with respect to their compositions and core/shell dimensions while varying the applied magnetic field strength. Hyperthermia properties of the prepared core-shell MFNs were further compared to commercial magnetic nanoparticles under the safe limits of magnetic field parameters (<5 × 109 A/(m·s)). As a result, the highest SLP value (379.2 W/gmetal) was obtained for mag@zcf1, with a magnetic field strength of 50 kA/m and frequency of 97 kHz. On the other hand, the lowest SLP value (1.7 W/gmetal) was obtained for cf@mag1, with a magnetic field strength of 40 kA/m and frequency of 97 kHz. We also found that magnetic properties and thickness of the shell play critical roles in heating efficiency and hyperthermia performance. In conclusion, we successfully enhanced the SLP of MFNs by engineering their compositions and dimensions.

Their catalytic activity, as well as many other chemical and physical properties are intimately related to the nano- and mesoscale structure. An efficient and fast in situ monitoring of the structural changes involves non-destructive techniques which can probe macroscopic volumes of multicomponent systems, such as small-angle scattering (SAS). However, the interpretation of scattering data is often a difficult task since the existing models deal only with symmetric AnJPs, thus greatly restricting their applicability. Here, a general theoretical framework is developed, which describes scattering from a system containing randomly oriented and placed two-phase AnJPs with arbitrarily tunable geometric and chemical asymmetries embedded in a solution/matrix of different chemical composition. This approach allows an analytic description of the contrast matching point, and it is shown that the interplay between the scattering curves of the two phases gives rise to a rich scaling behavior which allows extracting structural information about each individual phase. To illustrate the above findings, analytic expression for the scattering curves of asymmetric AnJPs are derived, and the results are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. The broad general features of the scattering curves are explained by using a simple scaling approach which allows gaining more physical insight into the scattering processes as well as for the interpretation of SAS intensity.

On the one hand, nanosized Fe3O4 particles with spherical morphology were synthesized by an aqueous-based reflux method employing different Fe (II)/Fe (III) molar ratios (2 or 4) and reflux temperatures (80, 95 or 110 °C). The solids obtained from a Fe (II)/Fe (III) nominal molar ratio of 4 showed higher specific surface areas which were also found to increase on lowering the reflux temperature. The starting 80 m2 g−1 was enhanced up to 140 m2 g−1 for the resulting optimized Fe3O4-based solid consisting of nanoparticles with a 15 nm average diameter. On the other hand, Pd or Pd-Ag were incorporated post-synthesis, by impregnation on the highest surface Fe3O4 nanostructured substrate, using 1–3 wt.% metal load range and maintaining a constant Pd:Ag ratio of 8:2 in the bimetallic sample. The prepared nanocomposite materials were investigated by different physicochemical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry (TG) in air or H2, as well as several compositions and structural aspects using field emission scanning and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques coupled to energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Finally, the catalytic results from a preliminary reactivity study confirmed the potential of magnetite-supported (Ag)Pd catalysts for CH4 partial oxidation into formaldehyde, with low reaction rates, methane conversion starting at 200 °C, far below temperatures reported in the literature up to now; and very high selectivity to formaldehyde, above 95%, for Fe3O4 samples with 3 wt.% metal, either Pd or Pd-Ag.

The microstructure and photocatalytic properties of the as-synthesized TiO2 nanocomposites, as well as the as-prepared PET filaments, are systematically characterized. The photocatalytic performance of the PET filaments coated with the Ag-N co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles sensitized with disperse blue dyes is evaluated via its capacity of photo-degrading methyl orange (MO) dyes under visible light irradiation. It is found that the holes are the predominant reactive radical species and the hydroxyl and superoxide radicals play a subordinate role in the photocatalytic reaction process. The reaction rate constant of the photocatalytic composite filaments is nearly 4.0 times higher than that of the PET filaments loaded solely with TiO2 nanoparticles. The resultant photocatalytic composite filaments are evident to be capable of repeatedly photo-degrading MO dyes without losing its photocatalytic activity significantly.

Systemic cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressant agent, is included in the current therapeutic armamentarium of these diseases. Despite being highly effective, it is associated with several side effects, and its topical administration is limited by its high molecular weight and poor water solubility. To overcome these limitations, cyclosporine A was incorporated into solid lipid nanoparticles obtained from Softisan® 649, a commonly used cosmetic ingredient, aiming to develop a vehicle for application to the skin. The nanoparticles presented sizes of around 200 nm, low polydispersity, negative surface charge, and stability when stored for 8 weeks at room temperature or 4 °C. An effective incorporation of 88% of cyclosporine A within the nanoparticles was observed, without affecting its morphology. After the freeze-drying process, the Softisan® 649-based nanoparticles formed an oleogel. Skin permeation studies using pig ear as a model revealed low permeation of the applied cyclosporine A in the freeze-dried form of the nanoparticles in relation to free drug and the freshly prepared nanoparticles. About 1.0 mg of cyclosporine A was delivered to the skin with reduced transdermal permeation. These results confirm local delivery of cyclosporine A, indicating its promising topical administration.

A surgical retractor was replicated from a commercial polylactic acid (PLA) thermoplastic filament, while a thin layer of silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) was developed via a simple and scalable sonochemical deposition method. The PLA retractor covered with Ag NPs (PLA@Ag) exhibited vigorous AM properties examined by a reduction in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria viability (%) experiments at 30, 60 and 120 min duration of contact (p < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the surface morphology of bare PLA and PLA@Ag retractor, revealing a homogeneous and full surface coverage of Ag NPs. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated the crystallinity of Ag nanocoating. Ultraviolent-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) highlighted the AgNP plasmonic optical responses and average particle size of 31.08 ± 6.68 nm. TEM images of the PLA@Ag crossection demonstrated the thickness of the deposited Ag nanolayer, as well as an observed tendency of AgNPs to penetrate though the outer surface of PLA. The combination of 3D printing and sonochemistry technology could open new avenues in the manufacturing of low-cost and on-demand antimicrobial surgery equipment.

Specific synthesis conditions, in homogeneous phase and at low temperature, have allowed limitation of S2− concentration, hence, as a consequence, there is restricted growth of the nanoparticles (NPs). This fact allows binding with BSA in the most favorable manner for the biomolecule. The presence of Cd2+ ions on the surface of the CdS nanoparticle is counteracted by the negatively charged domains of the BSA, resulting in the formation of small NPs, with little tendency for aggregation. Temperature and pH have great influence on the fluorescence characteristics of the synthetized nanoparticles. Working at low temperatures (4 °C) and pH 10–11 have proven the best result as shown by hydrolysis kinetic control of the thioacetamide precursor of S2− ion. Biological activity of the coupled BSA is maintained allowing subsequent bioconjugation with other biomolecules such as antibodies. The chemical conjugation with anti-Glutathione S-transferase (α-GST) antibody, a common tag employed in human recombinant fusion proteins, produces a strong quenching of fluorescence that proves the possibilities of its use in biological labelling. Finally, p53, onco-human recombinant protein (GST tagged in COOH terminus), has been in situ IVTT (in vitro transcription-translation) expressed and efficiently captured by the α-GST-CdS QD conjugate as a proof of the biocompatibility on IVTT systems and the functionality of conjugated antibody.

The thermal decomposition strategies have a vital effect on the structures and physicochemical properties of functional MOF derivatives. Nevertheless, what effect does the pyrolysis strategy have on MOF derivatives need further study. In this work, one-step (under dry air) and two-step (first under N2 and then dry air) pyrolysis are chosen to prepare the functional ceria-based MOF derivatives with novel hierarchical pore structure. In comparison with the derivatives prepared by one-step pyrolysis, the two-step pyrolysis composites exhibit better catalytic activity for toluene oxidation due to the higher contents of surface absorbed oxygen species and surface oxygen vacancies. The reusability and durability test demonstrates perfect stability of such functional MOF derivatives. The in-situ UV Raman reveals that two-step strategy is favorable for enhancing the gaseous oxygen activation ability of the functional MOF derivatives. Those findings may instruct the synthesis of functional MOF derivatives via different pyrolysis strategies as well as afford a further understanding of the crucial role of oxygen vacancies.

Electrospun nanofiber membranes are promising materials for the separation of various species such as particles, biomolecules, dyes, and metals from liquids because of the combined properties of a large specific surface, light weight, high porosity, good connectivity, and tunable wettability. This paper reviews the recent progress in the design and fabrication of electrospun nanofibers for chemical separation. Different capture mechanisms including electrostatic, affinity, covalent bonding, chelation, and magnetic adsorption are explained and their distinct characteristics are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and future aspects of nanofibers for membrane applications are discussed.
