Swindon boss Paolo di Canio has confirmed he wants to sign a loan goalkeeper as cover for Phil Smith.

Smith, 31, came off injured in their 2-0 defeat by Macclesfield, external on Friday and Di Canio confirmed he has suffered a hernia problem.

"I will lose him for probably for three to four weeks," the Robins manager told BBC Wiltshire.

"To win at the top level you need proper cover - we are now searching for a new goalkeeper."

Mattia Lanzano, who holds the number one jersey, came on as Smith's replacement in the defeat at the Moss Rose and deputised again in their Johnstone's Paint Trophy victory over Exeter on Tuesday, external, with youngster Leigh Bedwell on the bench.

"Mattia did very well [against Exeter], I'm happy because he was more relaxed, free in his head and did well," continued Di Canio.

"But even though Mattia did well, we want to challenge for the title and we should have the right cover. Bedwell is a good, talented keeper but he needs to improve a lot."

Di Canio went on to claim that he had been left frustrated by Smith's situation as no one in his backroom staff had informed him of the keeper's injury history.

"I got angry at the situation because when I moved to this club nobody helped me in this way," he said.

"I discovered just after the Macclesfield game that Phil Smith had had surgery three years ago on a double hernia - he has the same problem now.

"In a professional club once a new manager comes in he should know all the information about his players.

"Obviously, maybe I should ask but in my position I've had to bring in 15 new players, read the new rules and understand the league. Someone should come to me with a list of the players in the past who had a problem otherwise.

"But it's the past, it is done now."
