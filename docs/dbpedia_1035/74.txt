Diva Zappa‘s contributions to the recent aaafnraaa birthday bundle digital release on Frank’s 68th birthday are excellent… very quirky, she’s very much a Zappa offspring. It’s on iTunes. The whole album’s worth owning, especially for a Zappa fan. Diva’s tracks are “Alice” (my fave) and “Espanoza.” Melanie Starks take on “Dumb All Over” is another gem… of course, I’m quite fond of the lyrics to that one…

~Dan – np: the aforementioned aaafnraaa

PS- “aaafnraaa” stands for “anything anytime anywhere for no reason at all again,” a motto of Frank’s.
