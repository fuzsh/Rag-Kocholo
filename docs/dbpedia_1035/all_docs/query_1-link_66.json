Arf! Arf! You are reading an enhanced (corrected, enlarged and more detailed) PDF edition in English of my printed book Frank Zappan sävellykset (Suomen musiikkikirjastoyhdistys 2015, in Finnish). I try to explain shortly the reasoning behind this yet-another-Frank-Zappa-monograph. The idea of listing all the compositions by Frank Zappa is an obsessive project typical for music librarians. It was matured during the years I was forced to tell many Finnish Zappa fans that the book Zappa äänitteillä [Recorded Zappa, 1995] by me and HEIKKI KARJALAINEN was out of print and in no circumstances was I willing to compile a new edition of its material. There were a lot of useful discographic listings available on the internet in the beginning of 2000 and no real need for a printed book. And it would have been out-of-date in two weeks. Feeling still little guilty I started to figure out another way of approaching the monumental oeuvre of Frank Zappa. I found out that though there are a lot of discographies, no one seemed to offer a listing of Zappa’s compositions. Of course there are simple lists of “Frank Zappa Songs”available, but from a music librarian’s point of view none of them was really satisfying. OK for an occasional Zappa listener, but not comprehensive enough for more devoted hardcore fans and aficionados. So I decided to do the work by myself. I have dealt with composers’ catalogs quite a lot, even compiled some (Finnish classical composers OSKAR MERIKANTO, ERKKI MELARTIN, and SELIM PALMGREN). As an active music cataloger I have been using some 50 to 100 work catalogs. I was aware of the general challenges and some more: being a listener of Frank Zappa’s music for about 50 years I had a preconception of the special problems with his output. I knew that Zappa would not be like his predecessors, who carefully produced more or less complete scores on paper. As we all know, Zappa did not work like this. For him a composition was not so simple and limited concept. For the compiler of a composer’s work list Frank Zappa is just a nightmare. I stopped my initial work for the printed book, when Dance Me This, the last 100 % ready product by Frank Zappa was finally published in June 2015. Of course I knew that there would be more Zappa products in the future, but if one wants to publish something, one has to stop and put the final dot on its place. For me it was quite easy, because I knew that I would be publishing a corrected, enhanced and a more complete edition of the content on the internet later. The first edition was a handbook for Finnish Zappa fans, this second one tries to be the same for anybody reading and understanding at least some English. I have tried to compile a preliminary, but still both comprehensive and reliable overview of the musical output of Frank Zappa, not forgetting the enormous amount of “unofficial” and fictional titles the bootleggers and other creepy entrepreneurs have created during the past 50 years. As a Zappa fan I may find this bootleg fiction even funny, but as a music librarian I do not have any respect for these distributers of false, fake and usually also stupid information. In addition I have wanted to offer especially the less specialized readers an easy tool to make a difference between the real Frank Zappa compositions and the motley group of other items Zappa did put on his records in honor of the life on the road. It’s okay with me, if someone wants to listen to the Mothers chatting and singing out of tune in the back of the touring bus. I just want you to know when an interesting sounding title is genuine Frank Zappa music and when it is not.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 5\n\nThese kinds of listings are always based on the work of earlier enthusiasts and researchers, some of whom I think are real Giants with broad shoulders to sit on. I send my sincere thanks to all of you! I hope my work inspires someone else to carry this work on. Special thanks to MARKO NAKARI, a true Zappa fan and an excellent artist and OLLI VIRTAPERKO, who kindly gave me his time and irreplaceable knowledge of Frank Zappa’s music from a composer’s point of view.\n\nViikki, Helsinki, October 2017 Heikki Poroila\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 6\n\nFrank Zappa and a composer’s work catalog Compiling a comprehensive list of compositions by Frank Zappa is not an easy job to do. The main reason for this is the way Zappa reconsidered and recomposed his oeuvre again and again during his life. Usually Zappa worked with his musical ideas until the results were good enough for a recording or he lost his zeal and put the work aside. The evolution of some compositions is possible to follow thanks to the several audience recordings. It is, however, not so simple to decide, when it is reasonable to talk about versions of the same musical composition and when we are dealing with independent compositions. All this is even more difficult, usually impossible, with the ideas that never made their way to the concert repertoire or commercial recordings. Frank Zappa used musical ideas (mostly his own, but not only) very freely and creatively. An instrumental piece turned quickly to a song and vice versa. Zappa and his singers felt no obligation to stick to the original text, if there was a possibility to enrich the performance with current news, local special features or just for extra fun. Zappa’s habit to use “secret words” was a factory of countless variations, simply too many and complex to be treated each as a new version of a certain composition. Zappa did exploit other unconventional composing practices as well. His “conceptual continuity” and “xenochrony” have been documented quite well, but from the catalogers point of view they are mainly scary. When Zappa utilized his material and created connections, which had never existed before, he was not the first composer to do that. But his habit to combine bits from different concert performances to create a new work was something that most composers don’t do. His retrospective stories about the conceptual continuity of his works are an endless target for speculation and research. The challenge has become quite unsurpassed, when the original creator is no more available and even while he still was, how you knew, if his explanation of the connections were genuine and credible. Zappa had the right to lie to us, if he felt it necessary. Zappa did also use a kind of reverse xenochrony, when he picked satisfying bits – usually his own guitar solos – and publish them as independent compositions. In theory an improvisation is not a composition, but with Frank Zappa, can you really make the difference? I think Zappa was delighted, when he got a successful solo taped and could use it as such. Zappa’s solos are usually very independent and not so much thematically connected with the “mother composition”. This makes it easier to accept that they are more compositions than just another moment of twanging your electric guitar during a rock concert. The biggest problem is that while there are more than 50 entitled and recorded – sometimes even transcribed for score readers – Zappa guitar solos, the unreleased concerts and rehearsal recordings contain hundreds more. From a cataloger’s point of view they do not exist, because they did not pass Zappa’s hawk eyes. Then there is The Vault and the hard disc of the Synclavier. Zappa would probably think that it is ridiculous to look for “compositions” from the Synclavier files; nobody is losing anything, because you do not know, what there is. For him all that was just musical material for composing work, nothing else. It seems that the Zappa Family Trust has not challenged this principle, and there are not available lots of albums filled with spurious Synclavier “compositions” entitled in fictional “funny Frank Zappa style”. On the other hand we do not know for sure, which ones of the Compositions by Frank Zappa 7\n\nposthumous releases are entitled by Frank Zappa or if he would have accepted the publication of all of them. I have a feeling that should Frank Zappa have lived 20 years more, the list of official releases would have been totally different and we knew nothing about Joe’s Corsaga… *** For practical reasons a catalog of compositions by Frank Zappa is possible only with several preconditions. In this book a composition must be entitled entitled and published (in a way or another). To get a proper entry there must be a composition, composition improvisation (band or solo), significant ararrangement or lyr lyr ics by Frank Zappa. Entitled Entitled means a permanent “name” by Frank Zappa himself or in some cases a name, which is widely recognized, accepted and used by the posterity. We do know that Zappa’s own attitude was quite variable. In some cases he argued that naming a song was just a practical necessity (e.g. the guitar solo albums), but in other cases he seems to have been thinking the titles very carefully (all thematic albums and even the classical compositions). In many documented cases Zappa changed the name of his novelty compositions during the testing period. The mess is worse among the several unofficial titles the fans have invented to be able to talk about specified concert performances. I have tried to make it clear, when the title is by Zappa and when it is not. Published means in this catalog that the composition has been played in a public concert or distributed on a commercial recording or as printed music or as an unofficial, but otherwise known release. Many of Zappa’s compositions exist so far only as catalog entries, since Zappa or The Family Trust – or any of the bootleggers – have not made a public release. There are a lot of unknown and unreleased titles in the copyright databases like ASCAP. I have incorporated these entries, because it is possible that some of these compositions will be released in the future. We know at least one example of this kind of releases: Wreckelection recorded by WARREN CUCCURULLO in 2006. According The Zappa Family Trust this is a Frank Zappa composition, though Cuccurullo has said that it is basically his guitar solo from 1978. All these “ghost compositions” have been entered in a way the reader should easily understand. The main catalog does not contain compositions, in which Frank Zappa has had no creative part. There is still an extra listing of cover versions Zappa and his bands did perform and sometimes record as an appendix to the main catalog. The main reason for this is to clarify the deep haze of erroneous information especially the bootleg manufacturers have distributed during the decades. In many cases these errors are just result of misunderstanding and -hearing, but going through the song lists of many bootleg albums makes one think that the misleading titles have been added in purpose to give a false impression of “new” or “unreleased” compositions. Commercial reasons for these stupidities are obvious. How much Frank Zappa did use other people’s musical ideas without giving them public credit that is more or less beyond the scope of this catalog. Zappa made his own opinion clear: as a leader and employer of the band he had the right to exploit his employees’ output. This is of course not that simple, if you think the European or American copyright principles. On the other hand – and Frank Zappa did not forget to remind us about it – no one was forced to play with or for Zappa. Joining the band contained a speechless agreement, which allowed Frank Zappa to determine, whether he wanted to share the credits or not. Shared credits were never usual for Zappa, but they do still exist. It is hard to judge, how fair Zappa was in his decisions. None of his sidemen have ever Compositions by Frank Zappa 8\n\nshowed a creative capacity even near to Zappa’s. That does not mean that all of Zappa’s decisions were fair, but how many fair geniuses there are? Improvisation was a steady feature for Frank Zappa during his whole career. It is quite widely accepted that an improvisation is by definition not a composition, unless the creator is capable of repeating it. With Zappa there are at least three different types of improvisations and three different relations to real compositions. First there are the live solos. Zappa encouraged improvised solos by his musicians, but then again his own guitar solos constitute the majority of the solos he ever released. Whether these solos should be treated as compositions, that is a justified question. We do know that Zappa appreciated his own solos and treated them (at least the best) as unique creations. Many listeners agree, since Zappa’s solo playing concentrated in evolving musical ideas, not in showing technical virtuosity (Zappa hired STEVE VAI for that). On the other hand it is obvious that even Zappa did not think that every improvised solo was an independent musical creation or worth a release. Audience recordings have proved that Zappa’s standards were quite demanding. There are literally hundreds of unreleased guitar solos that the fans like to listen to, but which did not possess the qualities Zappa insisted for a public release. If the creator himself had no need to name these solos and give them a higher status, why should anybody else have? In this catalog only those improvised solos which Zappa – or The Zappa Family Trust – picked, named and released, have gained the status of a musical composition. There are only a few exceptions to this principle, like Improvizace v A dur s Frankem Zappou. The other group of improvisations came into being in concerts, when Zappa instructed the band to play following his hand cues, or, in some cases, just let the musicians play on their own. Especially the early incarnations of Mothers of Inventions were known for long band improvisations, of which not all have ever been released or entitled. I have accepted the ones Zappa released and named as his own compositions. Theoretically they should be credited to all the musicians, but since Zappa did not normally do that, this catalog gives – in most cases – the sole credit to Frank Zappa. The legal complaints the members of The Mothers of Inventions in United States have not been successful, and I have decided to settle down with these rulings with only a few exceptions of retrospective shared credits. The third group of improvisations consists of different elements like speech, dance and other human activities backed by a simple musical tapestry. It is not so easy to accept that these performances should get the status of a musical composition. However, since Frank Zappa decided to compile, edit, name and release these kinds of objects, I have with reluctance made catalog entries of them as well. Simple documentary recordings of conversations without creative editing have however been mentioned without the status of a composition. Lyrics by Frank Zappa may be dived in three main groups: (1) original lyrics to own music, (2) variations of own lyrics especially in concerts, and (3) lyrics to other composers’ songs (e.g. unpublished Beatles covers of 1988 tour and lyrics on Shankar’s Touch Me There). All the lyrics from groups 1 & 3 have an entry in this catalog, but the texts in group 2 only partially (the ones released with a new title). Reason for this is the lack of information, not a general judgment. It would have been really amusing to analyze every secret word variation ever published and released, but time ran out.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 9\n\nThe listing of cover versions Zappa and his bands performed or even released is not complete, but still quite comprehensive. The main reason for the imperfection is the fact that Zappa loved to hide short snippets of quotes in his own musical texture. It would take a researcher’s life to be sure that every one of them has been traced, recognized and identified. More than that I have tried to give basic information about the music that has too often incorrectly attributed to Frank Zappa, especially by bootleggers. While most of Zappa’s covers are more or less parodies (lyric or music or both), in the beginning and end he also produced versions that at least seem to be serious interpretations of classic blues and doo wop, or in the case of the 1988 tour band, also pieces like MAURICE RAVEL’s Boléro, LED ZEPPELIN’s Stairway To Heaven and I Am The Walrus by THE BEATLES. Even if the several short quotes have not earned their own entries, I have tried my best to give interesting extra information about these quotes in the info text. An early example is Invocation And Ritual Dance Of The Young Pumpkin, where there’s a direct quote from the orchestral suite The Planets, op. 32 (from the part Jupiter) by GUSTAV HOLST, and the whole 1988 tour was filled with references to both classical and popular music. In the world of classical music the year of composition has always had cultural value. Many work catalogs have even been compiled according to the chronology, certainly the best known being the one LUDWIG RITTER VON KÖCHEL did with the music by WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART (Köchel-Verzeichnis). This has been possible because an original, dated and signed manuscript was not a rare exception but a normal result of “composing music”. If the composer decides to remake an old composition, the new version is normally documented with a new date note. Of course the situation is not always this good, especially with the older music, but still we do have a lot of dating information available. Dating the compositions by Frank Zappa is a completely different story. He was able to produce traditional notation and authorized manuscripts and he used this ability several times during his career. But in Zappa’s world it is hard to answer, when a composition was “ready”. If we stick to the “classical” compositions, it might be possible to reconstruct quite reliable years of completing a score, which was used in rehearsals and performances. Most of Zappa’s compositions were still created in a dynamic process, which escapes attempts to define any specific year. This is why this catalog does not contain systematic information about the composing years. In some rare cases we happen to know, when or even where a song was composed. Majority of Zappa’s output cannot be dated in any sane way, though the releases help to determine that a certain composition existed during the recording process, at the least. My distinguished colleague Román García Albertos has offered a brave attempt (see http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/compositions.html), but in most cases the individual years and the chronology of compositions are just guessing. Certainly very civilized guesswork, but still not the same as a documented fact. Any attempt to master this complex net of dating information must fail in the end. As Zappa put it in 1988 to Bob Marshall, “But as far as I’m concerned, it’s all part of the same continuity. It’s all one piece.” I am sure that Zappa would have rejected our date aspirations in a crude manner. He just did not work or think that way. ***\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 10\n\nThe following lines try to explain the main differences between a traditional composer’s work catalog and the one you are now holding in your hands. You can skip this part, if you want to hurry to the real thing. But if you know anything about these classical catalogs, this might be interesting. A modern composer’s work catalog is based on scientific research, which covers – at least after the composer’s death – the manuscripts, concert programs, critics, correspondence etc. In most cases the lack of this basic research is a permanent obstacle for an ambitious catalog compiler. Frank Zappa has been the target of different studying for decades, but mostly as a performing and recording artist or a vivid and colorful cultural personality. Most of the interest has been nonacademic and untraditional, but no one has yet been able – or willing and able – to write a decent standard work about the life and music of Frank Zappa in the tradition of classical composers. Another precondition for a work catalog is the existence of relevant source material and an access to it. This is rarely a problem with historical composers from the Baroque and Renaissance periods. Talking about Frank Zappa the main problem is not the lack of source material as such but the access. Zappa left behind a vast archive – The Vault –, which has never been officially impossible to access, but in practice you needed to be a trusted friend of GAIL ZAPPA to get the permission. I do not know the situation after Gail Zappa’s death, but before that The Vault was mainly used by paid assistants, not by detached researchers. There has been a very ambitious project called Who The F*@% Is Frank Zappa? in order to save The Vault by digitizing it. All this is fine, but still not the same as a scientific research of all the original source material. The third precondition for a decent catalog is the general awareness of what Frank Zappa really did compose. While I am writing these lines, The Vault and the memory of Zappa’s Synclavier are still unavailable and unrevealed. If we believe that Zappa and his closest relatives did take care of the copyright status of Zappa’s compositions, the released titles added to the ones found in the database of ASCAP should form the main corpus. At least I am made my decisions about the general structure of this catalog on this basis. Though it is still possible, I do not expect to hear about hundreds of “new Frank Zappa compositions” from outside this listing. At least I am not holding my breath waiting for this news nor suggesting it for anybody else. Best classical work catalogs offer the possibility to identify composition by a short notation called incipit from the beginning of the work or each part of the work, like this piano introductory to House I Used To Live In:\n\nSince there are just a few examples of Zappa’s printed music available, the only reasonable way to help in identifying different works would be the official releases of the recordings. While a thematic catalog would be impossible (unless someone makes a good transcription of every composition\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 11\n\nby Zappa), a multimedia publication would solve the problem. According to the European copyright legislation a short bit of a composition could be published a citation, but it might be quite challenging to find common understanding with the copyright holders in the United States, although in theory the tradition of fair practice could and should make it even easier. The idea of identifying individual musical works with a special code (usually letter and number, like KV 503) has been used extensively among the classical composers’ catalogs. This would have possible with Zappa’s works as well, but after serious thinking I abandoned the idea. Most of the entries are easily identified by their original titles, problematic cases are quite few. In some cases I have edited the otherwise similar titles with explaining words and numbers. The conclusion is, unfortunately, that the preconditions for a real work catalog of compositions by Frank Zappa are by now simply too demanding. We need more basic research and knowledge about the contents of Zappa’s archives. So this catalog is just a meager compromise and – hopefully – the beginning of a long process. A complete catalog of the compositions by Frank Zappa is a distant goal, and I won’t be around witnessing it. I still hope that my compiling work benefits both the lovers of Zappa’s music and the hardy researchers who one day reveal the secrets of The Vault and The Synclavier.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 12\n\ninstructions The catalog has been divided in two sections: the main catalog in alphabetical order and the appendix catalog of cover versions. The main catalog contains works entirely by Frank Zappa and works of shared responsibility, in which he has provided music or lyrics. In many cases Zappa’s renditions of other composers’ works are very unique, but in this context a cover version is still a cover version. In most cases Zappa did give the credits to the original composers and lyricists. The main catalog contains some non-Zappa entries as well. The reason to this solution is simple: too many titles have been incorrectly connected with Frank Zappa (especially in bootleg recordings), and I have wanted to make the status of these titles as clear as possible. I have added several other non-compositional entries as well to clarify things even more. If you are not interested, just skip these entries. The same with some notes I have added. The information in these notes is not vital, just possibly interesting background stuff. In all basic entries in the main catalog both the composition and possible lyrics are by Frank Zappa. All exceptions to this are given in parenthesis under the title. If the entry is not a known Zappa composition, a different font and smaller font size have been used. The endless universe of Zappa bootlegs has been seriously treated only in those cases, in which a bootleg recording contains officially unreleased compositions or renditions. I have added a selection of well-known bootleg titles, but I don’t have much motivation in researching this scene. Most bootleg recordings are simply not interesting at all with their crappy layout and poor sound quality, false information and usually ridiculous prices. I am not making a moralistic stance here, just making the situation clear. I do appreciate the valuable work of concert tape collectors and traders as long as they are in it for the music, not for the money. Alphabetical order follows the first meaningful word, articles “A”, “An” and “The” have been systematically bypassed. The (American) English way of favor upper case letters in titles has been adopted. The titles of compositions and albums have been written in italics, except in entry titles. The album information entry gives only the first official release and later releases with clearly different renditions (for other releases see Information Is Not Knowledge). Only the year of release has been given, since the years of composition are so poorly documented. Additional information for a work entry contains mostly facts and assumed facts from mixed sources. I have cultivated some moderate speculation, but tried to avoid personal comments pro or against in situations where there are no facts to lean on. I have used expressions “Frank Zappa” and “Zappa” in the same meaning. Other members of the Zappa family have always their first names mentioned. I have not used the popular abbreviation “FZ”, but it can be found in titles and quotes. Finally, I ask the reader to remember that English or American English is not my native language. I have done my best, but you will find errors, mistakes, misprints and misunderstandings, absolutely. Any corrections are welcomed. In the future this free web publication will offer better language with a little help from you readers. E-mails to [email protected] thank you! Huomautus suomenkielisille lukijoille. lukijoille Tässä verkkoversiossa on korjattu suuri määrä painettuun kirjaan Frank Zappan sävellykset jääneitä virheitä sen lisäksi, että mukaan on otettu kirjan painatuksen jälkeen tulleita uusia tietoja ja teoksia.

Tämä uudistettu laitos on yksinkertaisesti paljon ensimmäistä parempi.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 13\n\nprinted sources It is really hard to list all the sources exploited during over two decades, but here are at least the sources I have directly used and cited. Booklets of Zappa’s records should all be on the list, since I have used the liner notes a lot, but this general statement must suffice. It is the same with the hundreds of sources on the internet. However, I want to make it clear that there are a lot of very ambitious and professionally compiled services for Zappa lovers around. Without them this publication would not been possible, it is that simple. ASCAP (The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) The database ACE Repertory contains information about more than 1150 Frank Zappa references. The data contains a lot of unreleased and mainly unknown entries. There are obvious mistakes and misunderstandings, but also a lot of works that Frank Zappa or Gail Zappa in some cases wanted to protect with copyright, even they were not used during Zappa’s life time. I have not accepted automatically any of these entries, but if there have been other sources as well, I have added them to the main catalog as a possible composition entry. The database searches were done mostly in 2015, and it is possible that some details have changed after that and mistakes have been corrected.

Other exploited publications are in rough chronological order between the numbered titles. Of unofficial recordings only those are mentioned, which contain officially unreleased entries. This is not a Frank Zappa discography. It is not always easy to know, what category a release really belongs to. In this catalog the category official release is used for the ones numbered by the Zappa Family Trust. Then there are semisemiofficial releases by the Zappa Family Trust and Zappa’s record companies without numbering (like the The Frank Zappa AAAFNRAA Birthday Bundles). The third category is the complex world of legitimate releases. releases This group includes several legal tribute releases and the often partially legal releases of Zappa’s concerts and other performances, which were aired by some radio or television company and are now legal for release on CD’s. I have not really entered the world of copyright details here, since the fundamental thinking in copyright is so different in the United States of America and The United Kingdom compared to the European copyright legislation. It is therefore possible that a certain release is legitimate in the United States of America, but not in Europe or Japan and vice versa. Since I am not a copyright lawyer, I am happy with the concept of legitimate release. The last category includes all illegitimate releases like counterfeits (not a relevant group here) and bootlegs (a very relevant group in some cases). It is not my task to moralize the production and selling of bootlegs, but an illegitimate release is interesting only if it contains otherwise unreleased and generally hard-to-access material. The listing of other bootlegs in this catalog is for general awareness only. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 – 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19\n\nTitle of the release\n\nPublished\n\nFreak Out!

The exact details of Munchkin Music or Frank Zappa Music are hard to find, but both have been there to sell and hire arrangements of Zappa’s compositions. Munchkin Music used to be an essential part of Zappa.com, but it seems that the Zappa Family Trust has now made a contract with Schott, one of the leading music publishers in the world. The older Munchkin Music catalog codes are no longer used by Schott, but I have left them for historical reasons. If you are interested in Zappa scores, please visit Schott Music’s web site. The deal with Schott Music is for Zappa’s classical output only. All other publishing rights were represented by the music publisher Kobalt Music from August 2013 on. However, in 2017, Frank Zappa is no more a Kobalt artist. The current owner of the publishing rights is unknown. An interesting question that nobody seems to have asked or answered seriously, is the whereabouts of Zappa’s manuscript notes and the copied material that Frank Zappa handed to the people coming for an audition. Since Zappa expected a true memorizing of his compositions from his musicians, this material must have been properly prepared and taken to musicians’ homes in large quantities. Of course a couple of songs were created on the spot and learned without any charts, but most of Zappa’s compositions played in concerts are so complex that the musicians had to have the details on paper as well. A natural answer to this question would be The Vault. However, nobody seems to have talked, as far as I know, about massive collections of manuscripts and copies of them on the shelves of The Vault. There’s only one exception to this, BILLY “ANT-BEE” JAMES, who made some copying work for Zappa in 1980’s. In an interview with FRED TOMSETT he opened the curtain a little bit: “Frank had a bunch of file cabinets with charts in, some very early stuff, like the drum piece ‘Mice’ that Frank wrote as a kid, and he saw a couple of my charts in there which made me feel pretty neat at that time. I was happy about that.” (T’Mershi Duween #31, June 1993). Probably the amount of people interested in manuscripts and scores is not as big as the amount of people hungry for unreleased recordings in Zappa’s tape collections. For the one studying the compositions any manuscript material would be valuable. Let’s hope that the digitizing project by ALEX WINTER will sometime in the future give us hundreds of now unknown and unpublished manuscripts. Meanwhile, here is an old listing of the products Munchkin Music used to offer via Barfko Swill. I have organized the titles according to their original publisher’s code.

I have therefore used one of the dating styles I have found in authentic sources, namely “October 28, 1978”, though also other styles do occur. I let the Zappa fans in UK and USA to determine, which one is the most authentic, or easier to use and perceive. Places are a little bit easier. I have tried to use always the authentic name of the venue regardless of the language of the name. Name of the city or other “big” place is instead in the form that also the people in UK and USA can understand (Köln = Cologne, München = Munich and Venezia = Venice). “New York”, “New York City” and “NYC” all refer to the same thing, the city, not the state. Names of the US states have been used only occasionally, when the venue has been located in a less known city. I trust that my readers are educated enough to understand the rest.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 23\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 24\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa\n\nA A Minor Blues Unofficial title for a 13 minutes improvisation by THE PETIT WAZOO recorded December 2, 1972.\n\nAaawk (John Lennon & Yoko Ono & Frank Zappa) Album: Playground Psychotics (1992) Frank Zappa and JOHN LENNON together June 6, 1971 at Fillmore East.

The program contains compositions, which were later released on Everything Is Healing Nicely and The Yellow Shark, but also some unreleased and untitled segments. There are no commercial releases, but the program has been circulating for years as a valuable insight documentary. The title “Anything Anytime Anywhere For No Reason At All” is the well known musical-ideological motto by Frank Zappa. The Zappa Family Trust used the acronym for several digital download releases entitled The Frank Zappa AAAFNRAA Birthday Bundle.\n\nAbsolutely Free Album: We’re Only In It For The Money (1968) First line: Discorporate and come with me / Shifting, drifting, cloudless, starless velvet valleys and a sapphire sea It is possible to read the lyrics as praise for hallucinatory drugs, but in case of Frank Zappa the correct interpretation is probably a merciless laughter at the hippie jargon. The key phrase is no doubt “YOU’LL BE ABSOLUTELY FREE / ONLY IF YOU WANT TO BE”. The song was recorded at Mayfair and/or Apostolic Studios, NYC, July-October 1967. The lyrics were censored by MGM (”balling” and ”flower power sucks” were too much). It is possible that the working title Electric Banana referred to Absolutely Free.

Napoleon is instructed to play Guy Lombardo’s ‘Little Coquette’ on sax while Don Preston gets Bing Crosby’s ‘Sweet Leilani’.

The song was recorded at Armadillo World Headquarters, Austin, May 20-21, 1975, but it was performed for the public already at Bridges Auditorium, Pomona College, Claremont, April 11, 1975. Advanced Study World Pop Domination (bootleg)\n\nThe Adventures Of Greggery Peccary Albums: Studio Tan (1978) – Joe’s Domage (2004) First line: The adventures of Greggery Peccary! Oh here comes Greggery! The first version on Studio Tan was recorded at Caribou Ranch, Nederland, December 1974, The Record Plant, January 3-14, 1975 & Royce Hall, UCLA, September 18-19, 1975, but the first ideas were presented already in 1969 and the whole suite was performed in Boston, September 24, 1972. On the original album the title is simply Greggery Peccary due to Warner Brothers’ decision without Zappa’s permission. Zappa has described the initial ideas of this work: “It was originally conceived as a ballet with recitation telling the adventures of a little pig who belongs to a doomed race. Not much potential in this idea.” (Chevalier 1986, p. 115) The work is divided in six parts: I Greggery’s Apartment, II The Steno Pool At Big Swifty’s, III Greggery Invents The Calendar, IV Greggery Is Attacked, V The New Brown Clouds, VI The Philostopher Speaks Part The New Brown Clouds was rehearsed and performed as an independent song as well. On Joe’s Domage there is some documentation of the process of recording. The bootleg The Lone Ranger offers us the title The Adventurous Stories. GREG RUSSO believes that the title plays on the name of actor GREGORY PECK (Russo 2017, p. 149).

An arrangement for orchestra by HUBERT STEINER has been published by Munchkin Music. Many compositions by Frank Zappa have been arranged after his death to fit different groups of performers. It is hardly possible to trace them in any reasonable way. I have added this kind of information only in those cases, where the arrangement is well documented and is of general interest. So if you wonder why I have omitted some nice performances of Zappa’s music played using the bow and a saw, there is no reason to get nervous.\n\nAfter Dinner Smoker Album: Trance-Fusion (2006) Zappa’s guitar solo in The Torture Never Stops at Palasport, Genova, June 9, 1988.\n\nAgency Man Albums: Mystery Disc 2 (1992/1998) – Ahead Of Their Time (1993) Probably recorded in 1967 at Apostolic Studios and usually released on bootlegs as a longer version than on official releases. In concerts 1968 this was part of the larger set Progress?\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 26\n\nThe text has been seen as a prophecy of RONALD REAGAN’s presidency. More likely Zappa was just trying to imagine the worst possible alternative. In 1989 he explained the text like this: “Agency Man is about advertising agencies selling political candidates. The song was written because at a certain point in American political history, politicians discovered Madison Avenue, and it changed the face of American politics. Because the Republicans always had more money that the Democrats, they were the first to hire a real Madison Avenue agency. I believe it was BBD&O, Batten, Barton, Durston, and Osborne, that took on the Republican campaign. I think it was for the Nixon campaign. The amount of money they started to spend on the campaign became science fiction.” (Simms 1990) Ah, look, you know they tried SEE Bathtub Man Ahead Of Their Time (official release) Ahoy Eighties (bootleg) Ahoy Rotterdam (bootleg)\n\nThe Air Album: Uncle Meat (1969) First line: The air escaping from your mouth The song was recorded at Apostolic Studios, 1967-1968. For some reason practically nothing has been said or written about the lyrics, which seem to be about a violent man on the run. The Air escaping from your mouth SEE Air, The Airline Debris SEE Cosmik Debris Albert In Paris (unreleased and generally unspecified item, see Russo 2017, p. 328-329) Alcohol + Razor Blades (entry on Zappa’s MUST RECORD list) Alice In Blunderland SEE Chronicle\n\nAlien Orifice Albums: Frank Zappa Meets The Mothers Of Prevention (1985) – You Can’t Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 6 (1992) This is a combination of the Synclavier and the band playing. Earliest known version (The Palladium, New York City, October 31, 1981) was released in You Can’t Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 6. The recording location of the version on Frank Zappa Meets The Mothers Of Prevention in unknown, date is c. 1981-1982.\n\nAll Aboard For The Electric Banana Unreleased track from MGM 1966 sessions (Russo 2017, p. 327).\n\nAll Night Long Album: Animalism (The Animals, 1966) First line: I ain’t go nobody TOM WILSON asked Zappa to arrange two songs to THE ANIMALS album Animalism (the other was Other Side Of This Life by FRED NEIL). The recordings were made at TTG Studios, June 4, 1966. Zappa used the melody with new words in No Matter What You Do, released on Tis The Season To Be Jelly. All Over The Road (tribute release)\n\nAll Skate/Dun-Dun-Dun (The Finnish Hit Single) Album: Road Tapes Venue #2 (2013) This is a long improvised section (All Skate) ending with Zappa inciting the Finnish audience to imitate voices from monster movies (Dun-Dun-Dun). The recording has been done at the Finlandia Hall, Helsinki in August 1973, but it is unknown, if the title is authentic.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 27\n\nAll The Equipment In The World There are a lot of references to assumed documentary recordings – like this one – in the ASCAP database. Zappa wanted to protect them at least in cases he wanted to use them in his own releases. In this catalog these titles have not been treated as Zappa’s composition, even though he usually credited them for himself.\n\nAll The Way Down To The Tonsils Title for a short snippet of sound effects on a demo version of Uncle Meat vinyl album.

Additional musicians were ELLIOT INGBER (slide guitar) and JOHN FRENCH (drums). “That’s (…) recorded downstairs in the basement in 1969. On a Scully 2-track with a couple of mikes.” (Frank Zappa in the liner notes of The Lost Episodes)\n\nAlmost Chinese Album: Lumpy Gravy (1968) – Lumpy Money (2009) Part of the Lumpy Gravy set.

The movie contains a lot of background music mainly extracted from Zappa’s known orchestral compositions, but some enthusiastic have found also unreleased portions. The movie was written, produced, directed and composed by Frank Zappa, who can be seen with Bickford in action as well. It was released by Honker Home Video possibly in 1987, and then by Video For Nations VFN 4 in 1989. This movie has not yet been released as a DVD or Blu-Ray.\n\nAmen Album: Lumpy Gravy (1968) – Lumpy Money (2009) Part of the Lumpy Gravy set. America (entry in the ASCAP database, probably a misspelling of Amnerika)\n\nAmerica Drinks Album: Absolutely Free (1967) First line: One, two, buckle my shoes / Da-doop doop doop Frank Zappa made a comment on this song in his interview August 31, 1978: ”On this side of the album there are two versions of this set of lyrics. This version, which opens side two, is in effect an abstraction (in\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 28\n\nadvance of) the set of lyrics which close side two. The opening lines of ‘One, two, buckle my shoes’ and ‘doopie doopie’ are derived from a tune called ‘My Little Red Book’.” (Zappa 1978) The working title of this song was “No Regrets”.\n\nAmerica Drinks & Goes Home Album: Absolutely Free (1967) First line: I’ve tried to find how my heart could be so blind, dear ”America Drinks & Goes Home is an unsubtle parody of adult conduct in neighborhood cocktail lounges in America. The humor is aimed at (1) the type of music your parents like to listen to, (2) the manner in which they like to have it performed (the insincerity of the night-club crooner in his closing address the alcoholics at the bar), (3) the manner in which the audience persists in talking above the level of the music while it is being performed (which belies their disrespect as an art and for anyone involved in the performance of music).” (Zappa 1978) According to Greg Russo, HERB COHEN was operating the cash register and the club patrons were TERRY GILLIAM and his girlfriend. (Russo 2017, p. 65)\n\nAmerica The Beautiful (Composed by Samuel A. Ward, words by Katharine Lee Bates, some new words by Frank Zappa) Album: Beat The Boots III (2009) – Frank Zappa For President (2016) First line: O beautiful for spacious skies The performances were recorded in Burlington March 12, 1988 and at Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, March 25, 1988. Zappa did not rewrite the whole text, but changed the line ”God shed his grace on thee” to ”The only place to be”. Zappa justified the change saying: ”I’m not sure God did shed his grace on this country.” (Greenaway 2010, p. 141) The ASCAP database contains an entry of America The Beautiful credited to Frank Zappa. This could refer to the changed lyrics. The music was composed by SAMUEL AUGUSTUS WARD (1847-1903) in 1882, as Materna. The poem was written in 1893 by KATHARINE LEE BATES (1859-1929) and published for the first time 1895. It was not until 1910 when Materna and the poem were published together with the title America The Beautiful. Before that the poem was sung to just about any popular tune that would fit with the lyrics, like Auld Lang Syne.\n\nAn American Dissident An extract from this video program in Video From Hell is all we now have of this video release, which Frank Zappa planned for 1988. It is still possible that the material exists. American Pageant – Nullis Pretii (bootleg) Am-nerika SEE Amnerika\n\nAmnerika Album: Thing-Fish (1984) – Civilization Phaze III (1994) First versions of this composition can be heard as Synclavier renditions in Thing-Fish songs That Evil Prince, The White Boy Troubles and Drop Dead, all recorded at UMRK, c. 1982-84. On Civilization Phaze III there is a simple Synclavier version recorded at UMRK, 1991-92. For the chamber orchestra arrangement see Amnerika Goes Home.\n\nAmnerika Goes Home Album: Everything Is Healing Nicely (1999) Zappa arranged his Synclavier composition Amnerika for a chamber orchestra to be performed as a part of The Yellow Shark concerts, but the performances were not good enough for the official Yellow Shark album, even though SPENCER CHRISLU believed that an accurate version could be edited using all the material (Russo 2017, p. 222). The Zappa Family Trust has not yet released any concert version of it, just a rehearsal version recorded in July, 1992. The new title is probably by Gail Zappa.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 29\n\nAmnerika (Vocal Version) Album: Frank Zappa For President (2016) This vocal version was recorded at UMRK, c. 1982-84 with just NAPOLEON MURPHY BROCK adding his voice on top of Zappa’s Synclavier. The quite dreadful text, in which the Evil Prince declares the death sentence to the “creatives” and “natives”, has been published in The Yellow Shark concert booklet and in the text book Zonx (Zappa 1996, p. 614). Brock has told that the character of The Evil Prince was more or less portrayed by him: “I have the original tape of ‘The Evil Prince’ that Frank and I did together. He and I were sitting there at the piano laughing with Frank plunking it out, creating the melody with words in front of him.” (Russo 2017, p. 170) In an interview with ANDREW GREENAWAY in 2002 Brock described the process in more details: “But the whole Evil Prince thing we developed together. We did that before he did Thing-Fish, because he hadn’t even met Ike Willis yet. (…) The whole idea of the Evil Prince came just by chance. (…) I would turn into this person who was a mad scientist [in The Torture Never Stops] that I found out later was called the Evil Prince.” (Greenaway 2017, p. 57) That “later” was in 1983, when Zappa called Brock again: “’Okay, come on, into my studio to the piano and we’re gonna do the song The Evil Prince.’ He says, ‘Bring your tape recorded’, which I always did. I put in on. He says, ‘Here are the lyrics, now I’m gonna play the notes. I’m creating it right now and I need you to tape it so you can learn it and when you come back I’ll have the tracks ready and you can sing on it’. So he played one line at a time, then I’d record it. That’s how we did the whole song. And it’s a very long song.” (Greenaway 2017, p. 71) It is not known why Zappa did not want to release this version. The recording was not released until 2016.\n\nAmnesia Vivace Album: Absolutely Free (1967) First line: Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke of Prunes, Prunes, Prunes, Prunes Middle part of the three-part suite (The other parts are The Duke Of Prunes and The Duke Regain His Chops), recorded at TTG Studios, November 1966. Its working title was “Remember”.\n\nAncient Armaments Album: Halloween (2003) Zappa’s guitar solo from the concert at The Palladium, October 31, 1978. Exceptionally this musically rich solo was heard as the starting number. The solo was originally released on B-side of I Don’t Want To Get Drafted (Zappa Records, ZR 1001, April 28, 1980) as a shorter edit. The content of the Halloween DVD-Audio disc was compiled and mixed with four channels by Frank Zappa for the first time in 1978 and released in 2003 in cooperation with the DTS Entertainment and its 5.1channel technique. Dweezil Zappa produced the album, which contained mostly well known songs, but also a couple of rare items like Ancient Armaments and Zeets. There are thirteen audio tracks plus two videos, Dancin’ Fool from Saturday Night Live, October 21, 1978, and Suicide Chump in black and white footage. The extras include also a 10-minutes radio interview with MARK SIMONE on the eve of Halloween 1978, the transcript lyrics and spoken texts of all tracks (“The Libretto”), the discography and more or less the whole liner notes text on your screen.

Traditional but quite meagerly proved interpretation has been that Andy is about Western actor ANDY DEVINE. According to NIGEY LENNON, this song is Zappa’s bitter ”answer” to Lennon, who had put an end to their long lasting and secret affair. (Lennon 1995, p. 136 and 151) The first known public performance was February 16, 1974 at Berkeley Community Theatre, Berkeley with working title Something /Anything. A couple of weeks later (March 5, 1974, Convention Center, Dallas) the title was Is There Anything Good Inside Of You? The released version was recorded at The Record Plant, January 8, 1975. Another Cheap Aroma SEE For The Young And Sophisticated\n\nAnother Variation Of The Formerly Secret Album: The Frank Zappa AAAFNRAA 2011 Birthday Bundle (2011) Zappa’s guitar solo in City Of Tiny Lites at The Palladium, October 30, 1980. The title is probably not by Frank Zappa himself.\n\nAnother Whole Melodic Section Album: Joe’s Domage (2004) This music – entitled at that time simply Interlude – was performed for the first time April 20, 1968 (Fillmore East, NYC, early show). SCOTT PARKER describes the performance of February 8, 1969 like this: ”… a beautifully melodic instrumental piece in the vein of some of FZ’s ‘nice tunes’ pieces such as ‘Holiday in Berlin’ and ‘Peaches En Regalia’.” It is possible the same music, which Zappa let DENNY WALLEY to listen to and tape in August 1971 and which is circulating by the name Boogie For Berkeley. The version on Joe’s Domage was recorded c. 1972. Scott Parker has been one of the key figures for this catalog, because he has opened the content of officially unreleased concerts. His invaluable series The Recordings of Frank Zappa (1-6 up to this point plus a few special bonus books) is simply irreplaceable for a lazy fan like me, who has never got the time and energy to obtain and listen to all of those lovely tapes circulating. I would like to add that Scott Parker has constantly improved the quality of his books and he publishes corrections promptly. So, thank you, thank you, and thank you!

Anxiety Of Influence (tribute release)\n\nAny Downers? Album: You Are What You Is (1981) First line: And all around, at the side of the grave The better known version of this song was part of the 1980 tour medley of songs criticizing the empty life of white, wealthy society circles and drug use. This version was recorded at UMRK, July-September 1980. For the earlier version see Any Downers (1974).\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 31\n\nAny Downers? (1974) Album: Joe’s Camouflage (2014) First line: Are you holding any downers The world premiere of this early version of Any Downers? was at Spectrum Theater, Philadelphia, November 17, 1974. The released version was recorded August 25, 1975 at Sunset Boulevard studios. This early version is so different musically and for the lyrics that I have given it an own entry. Officially there is only one Any Downers?.\n\nAny Kind Of Pain Album: Broadway The Hard Way (1988) First line: You are the girl someone invented in a grim little office on Madison Ave The song was performed already in concerts in 1976 and 1981, but only in 1988 Zappa decided to release it officially. The released version is a combination of four performances (February 12, Tower Theater, Upper Darby, February 9, Warner Theatre, Washington DC, March 5, Music Hall, Cleveland & April 25, 1988, Falkoner Teatret, Copenhagen). Any Vegetable SEE Call Any Vegetable\n\nAny Way The Wind Blows Album: Freak Out! (1966) – The Lost Episodes (1996) – MOFO (2006) First line: Any way the wind blows, Is-a fine with me In the original album’s sleeve note Zappa tells: “Any Way The Wind Blows is a song I wrote about three years ago when I was considering divorce. If I had never gotten divorced, this piece of trivial nonsense would never have been recorded. It is included in this collection because, in a nutshell, kids, it is… how shall I say it? … it is intellectually and emotionally ACCESSIBLE for you. Hah! Maybe it is even right down your alley!” The standard version on Freak Out! was recorded at TTG Studios, March 9 & 11, 1966. On MOFO (2CD) there is a new mix by Zappa in 1978 (the ASCAP database gives it an individual entry). On The Lost Episodes there is an early version recorded at Pal Recording Studio, Cucamonga, March 1963 (probably the year of composition as well). RAY COLLINS sings and Zappa takes care of drums, bass and guitar. Songs on Freak Out! were most likely written in 1965 and recorded as demo versions (see I’m Not Satisfied for extra information).

Zappa placed the song in the end of Be-Bop Tango (Of The Old Jazzmen’s Church on Roxy & Elsewhere without mentioning it in the sleeve note. Not a big harm done. The performance was recorded in Los Angeles, December 8-10, 1973.

During 1978 and 1980 one of these suggestions was “Ave Maria” without any reference to a specific composition, just to imitate some “church music” (see Zappa 1989, p. 178). This is also the name of a bootleg recording.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 35\n\nAybe Sea Album: Burnt Weeny Sandwich (1970) IAN UNDERWOOD plays piano and harpsichord, Zappa some acoustic guitar. Especially the impressionistic ending might be Underwood’s improvisation, which would be a good reason for shared credits. At least it is stylistically very unusual for Zappa. The exact date of the recording is not known, but probably this was recorded during the Hot Rats sessions in 1969. Aybe Sea was not performed in concerts often, but at least at Convocation Hall, Toronto, c. FebruaryMarch 1969 it was heard: “Played by Frank and (presumably) Don Preston solo, this sweet, delicate piece is an absolute treat to hear live. It makes you wish they had developed it further!” (Parker 2007a)\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 36\n\nB Babbette SEE Babette\n\nBabette Album: You Can’t Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 1 (1988) First line: Don’t tell me no, Babette This 1950’s style ballad is from the beginning of 1970’s. Probably the first public performance was at State University of New York, Stony Brook, December 1, 1973 (late show). The released version was recorded at Capitol Theatre, Passaic, November 8, 1974. The song is dedicated to roadie MARTY PERELLIS, who had an important role in Zappa’s tour stories. Babette is also part of the unrealized set The Red Throbber, in which Babette is the sniffer dog of a customs officer. (Troccoli 1991, p. 54) The title is sometimes spelled Babbette.

There are very different readings of this text. Some believe that “baby snakes” is a reference to the endless mess of power lines and plugs in a recording studio, since there is a reference to Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers. The other interpretation is that “baby snakes” is a reference to young prostitutes or even more graphically to anatomic details of female genitals because of the text “Sure you know what I’m talkin about / Pink n wet / They make the best kinda pet”. The “sexy” pose on cover of Baby Snakes album is, according to Zappa, just a coincidence: “That was the make-up girl. It was a candid shot, y’know. She just happened to have her tongue stickin’ out when she was touchin’ up my make-up on the thing.” (Simms 1990) Baby Snakes (official release)\n\nBaby Snakes Rehearsal Album: Baby Snakes Soundtrack (2012) Documentary part of the official Baby Snakes soundtrack. Baby Snakes Soundtrack (official release)\n\nBaby Snakes (The Movie) In October 1987 Zappa released a documentary film about his own Halloween concert at The Palladium, 1977. According to some sources a 90 minutes long version was released already in 1985 (the original version is two hours and 47 minutes). The film was released on DVD in 2003, but many of the talking sections on CD Baby Snakes Soundtrack only in 2012.

When MATT GROENING interviewed Zappa for Zappa!, he remembered the occasion well: “That particular song was concocted at a soundcheck at the place where this concert was taking place in Frankfurt.” Baby What’s You Doin’ (unreleased and generally unspecified item, see Russo 2017, p. 328-329) Back about a hundred years ago SEE Diptheria Blues Back On The Straight And Narrow (bootleg) Back Page #1 SEE Black Page #1 Back To The Red World (entry in the ASCAP database)\n\nBacon Fat (Andre Williams & Dorothy Brown, new words by Frank Zappa) Album: Our Man In Nirvana (1968) – Broadway The Hard Way (1988) This song, originally released by Andre Williams & His New Group in 1956 (Fortune 831), was a popular cover song both in the beginning and in the end of The Mothers of Invention. The released versions were recorded in Fullerton, November 8, 1968 with original lyrics and at Frauenthal Auditorium, Muskegon, Michigan, March 1, 1988 with totally new text by Zappa.\n\nBad Acting Album: Playground Psychotics (1992) Documentary talking from the film The True Story Of 200 Motels.\n\nBaked-Bean Boogie Album: You Can’t Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 5 (1992) Zappa’s guitar solo, probably in King Kong July 8, 1969 in Boston. Baker’s Dozen (tribute release)\n\nBamboozled By Love Album: Tinsel Town Rebellion (1981) First line: Bamboozled by love, oh Lord, the shit done hit the fan A realistic story of the violent and chauvinistic male jealousy. The song was written and performed already in 1978, but the released version was recorded at Hammersmith Odeon, February 19, 1979. The Band From Utopia : A Tribute To The Music Of Frank Zappa (tribute release)\n\nBand Introduction At The Fillmore West Album: Mystery Disc 1 (1991/1998) Band presentation recorded in the end of 1965 or in the beginning of 1966, while The Mothers of Invention was the warm-up band for LENNY BRUCE.

It contains alternate mixes of The Man From Utopia Meets Mary Lou and Cocaine Decision on side A, while the whole B-side is filled by the third movement of Mo ‘N Herb’s Vacation.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 38\n\nBasement Music #1 Album: The Lost Episodes (1996) A home recording realized with a synthesizer c. 1977-1978. This and Basement Music #2 can be seen as the predecessor of Zappa’s work with his Synclavier in 1980’s. Some bootlegs – e.g. Apocrypha – offer a longer version of the same music. Frank Zappa talks about this music in the liner notes of The Lost Episodes: “At the time Warner Bros. made it impossible for me to record anywhere, I had a 4-track and decided to record in my basement. That’s me wasting time with a very primitive rhythm box, a Rhythm Ace, fed into a flanger. The music was done on a synthesizer called a Synkey. It was all played live, with no overdubs.”\n\nBasement Music #2 Album: QuAUDIOPHILIAc (2004) – Baby Snakes Soundtrack (2012) According to the album booklet this music has been released in the film Baby Snakes. It seems that this is the same as She Said on Baby Snakes Soundtrack. In the film it is preceded by City Of Tiny Lites. The version on QuAUDIOPHILIAc was recorded at Zappa basement, c. 1977-1978 and mixed at Village Recorders, LA, April 30, 1978. The Basic Primer: Z to A (bootleg)\n\nBass And Drum Song Album: Officially unreleased This song was recorded at The Record Plant, March 3, 1970 with Zappa, Ian Underwood, DON HARRIS and MAX BENNETT. At the same session were recorded The Clap, Sharleena and I’m A Rolling Stone, another otherwise unknown title. It is also possible that Bass And Drum Song is just a working title for a song we now know with another title.\n\nBathtub Man (Napoleon Murphy Brock & George Duke & Frank Zappa) Album: One Shot Deal (2008) First line: Ah, look, you know they tried to tell me Improvised segment at Palais des Sports, Paris, September 26, 1974. Napoleon Murphy Brock and GEORGE DUKE are chatting on top of a simple blues accompaniment.

The song was recorded at UMRK, c. 1982-84. On You Can’t Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 39\n\n1 (recorded at The Pier, NYC, August 26, 1984) there is a current rendition of the text, while the refrain ”and then we’ll dance the blues” has turned to ”and then we’ll mine the harbor”, a reference to the mining of Nicaragua’s harbors in president Reagan’s attempt to isolate the poor country. The Beach Song SEE Lemme Take You To The Beach Beat Club SEE Lieder-Liches\n\nBeat It With Your Fist Album: Shut Up ´N Play Yer Guitar (1981) Zappa’s guitar solo in The Torture Never Stops October 30, 1980 at The Palladium. Arthur Barrow has told that during this performance he played his bass trying on purpose to disrupt the rhythmic flow because he was pissed at Zappa’s remarks of him playing “too busy”. (Barrow 2016, p. 113) Beat The Boots [I] (semiofficial release) Beat The Boots II (semiofficial release) Beat The Boots III (semiofficial release)\n\nBeat The Boots Frank Zappa did not appreciate the work of the bootleggers much. In 1990’s he started a campaign to encourage his fans to stop buying illegal released by releasing them by himself. Zappa did not do any hard work, he just picked up the “best” titles from a list a Rhino Records official gave him. Zappa’s idea was to release and sell his “legal bootlegs” just as the originals without enhancing the quality in any way (the cover details were corrected a little). The first box was released in July 7, 1991, the second in June 16, 1992, both by Rhino Records. The third and presumably the last box was released by Amazon.com as digital downloads between January 21 and February 2, 2009. The construction of this box was different. While the two first contained exact replicas of bootleg released with original covers, the third one was compiled from several bootlegs without using them as such. This must have been a decision by Gail Zappa. Frank Zappa did not make any comments on the selections he chose, but as the result of these releases several unreleased tracks are now legally released. It is, however, important to remember that while hating to be ripped off Zappa also understood very well the need to “find out”: “Well, look, it depends on what the intent is. If the intent is to rip me off, then I hate it. If the intent is to find out what’s going on, then I think it’s fabulous. I’m glad that somebody takes an interest in it, and I’m glad they enjoy it, and whatever I do is for other people’s enjoyment here, y’know? But just like anybody else, who wants to get ripped off? I’m not interested in bending over. So ... there you have it.” (Simms 1990)\n\nBeat The Reaper Album: Civilization Phaze III (1994) Frank Zappa describes this Synclavier composition recorded at UMRK, 1991-1992 in the liner notes like this: “With the thunderclap, various types of inexplicable social actions break out all over the piano. Each of the nine movements within this piece should alternate the focus from piano interior, region by region, with the exterior, region by region. The actions should illustrate the current fetish for life extending or ‘youthening’ trends, including meditation, bizarre diets, pill and algae consumption, violent aerobics, ‘The Easy Glider’, stair-steppers, etc.” An arrangement for chamber orchestra was performed in The Yellow Shark concerts, but it was omitted from the CD release for unknown reasons. Maybe there were no excellent performances available, but probably the Zappa audience would warmly welcome any of them even over 20 years later. The Beatles Medley SEE Texas Medley Beauty is not love SEE Packard Goose\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 40\n\nBeauty Knows No Pain Album: You Are What You Is (1981) First line: Beauty knows no pain, so what you’re cryin’ about, girl? Part of the 1980 tour medley of songs criticizing the empty life of white, wealthy society circles. The song was recorded probably at Tower Theater, Upper Darby, Philadelphia, April 29, 1980 (late show), with overdubs recorded at UMRK, July-September 1980. The creating of the song started in December 26, 1975 at Paramount Theater, Oakland, where Zappa’s band touched the musical material of it inside Chunga’s Revenge.\n\nBe-Bop Tango Album: The Yellow Shark (1993) This is a shorter arrangement of the Be-Bop Tango (Of The Old Jazzmen’s Church) for chamber orchestra and with a shorter title. It was recorded in September 1992 in Europe by Ensemble Modern. The performances on The Yellow Shark album are all composites of best performances from different concerts melded together by Frank Zappa. “And when you listen to the CD, it’s quite amazing were able to pull it off. The way it all fell together, Frank was able to make some very suave edits. You really can’t hear the ambience change.” (Spencer Chrislu in the liner notes) This is why the recording place information is always “in Europe”. There were eight concerts, three in Frankfurt (Alte Oper, September 17-19), two in Berlin (Philharmonie, September 22-23), and three in Vienna (Konzerthaus, September 26-28, 1992).\n\nBe-Bop Tango Contest Album: Transmission Impossible (2015) This audience participation routine with lots of band playing was performed and recorded at University of Waterloo, Canada, November 18, 1973.\n\nBe-Bop Tango (Of The Old Jazzmen’s Church) Album: Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) First line: Some of you may know that the tango, which is not a very popular dance anymore The released version, recorded at Roxy, Los Angeles, December 8-10, 1973, contains an introduction to tango’s history by Zappa. After five minutes Zappa introduces the rhythmically tough melody to which the audience is supposed to dance.\n\nBeen To Kansas City In A Minor Album: Imaginary Diseases (2006) A group improvisation at Cowtown Ballroom, Kansas City, December 2, 1972. This music is also known among the tape-traders as “KC Blues”.\n\nBeer Shampoo Album: Playground Psychotics (1992) Documentary tour chatting recording from the beginning of 1970’s. Before The Beginning SEE History And Collected Improvisations Of The Mothers Of Invention\n\nThe Beltway Bandits Album: Jazz From Hell (1986) A Synclavier composition from 1985-1986. The title refers to a term that was used of private companies around Washington DC, whose major business was to provide consulting services to the US government. The phrase was originally an insult, implying that the companies preyed like bandits on the largesse of the federal government.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 41\n\nBeneath Contempt Album: Officially unreleased First line: So low / you go very low / Low is where you come from / Low is where you go / Beneath contempt! / Beneath contempt! / You’re the vicious sleaze / We call The Government These lyrics are in the text book Zonx (Zappa 1996, p. 620). Nothing is known about possible music to these words. Since Zonx is most likely produced in cooperation with the Zappa Family Trust, all similar texts in the book have been regarded as genuine Frank Zappa works.

Big Klown Dancer (entry in the ASCAP database) Big Mother Is Watching You (bootleg)\n\nBig Leg Emma Album: Absolutely Free (1967) First line: There’s a dilemma about my big leg Emma We have an official statement from Zappa that at least sometimes he was “in it for the money”: “(…) it was a straight commercial attempt to just go in with a piece of absolute shit for a market that is based on shit. It is an experiment.” (Kofsky 1970, p. 27) The song was first released only as a single that was recorded at TTG Studios, March 6, 1967. Unofficially the song was called Dilemma. Big Oil In America (entry in the ASCAP database)\n\nBig Sequence Album: Officially unreleased Unreleased Synclavier composition from 1986, the beginning of which Zappa used later as Religious Superstition. This and other unreleased Synclavier stuff have been circulating as a cassette (see Resolver + Brutality). All of its music is from 1986 and is thematically linked with the albums Frank Zappa Meets The Mothers Of Prevention and Civilization Phaze III.\n\nCompositions by Frank Zappa 42\n\nThe Big Squeeze Album: The Lost Episodes (1996) – Finer Moments (2012) In 1967 animator ED SEEMAN, who was also a great fan of Frank Zappa, asked him to do the music for a Luden’s Cough Drop ad. Zappa wanted $2000 and a studio. The result won a Clio Award for “Best Use of Sound”. Zappa used Ed Seeman also for filming 14 hours of footage for the movie Uncle Meat. The ad was recorded at Mayfair with DICK BARBER (voices and noise) and Frank Zappa (kazoo, celesta and percussion), with ending voice by Ed Seeman. On The Lost Episodes the title is The Big Squeeze and on Finer Moments for some reasons Music from The Big Squeeze although it is the same recording.\n\nThe Big Surfer Album: Paul Buff Presents The Pal And Original Sound Studio Archives.

Brian Lord was a radio personality, who was known for his impersonation of JOHN F. KENNEDY. In this song “JFK” is visiting the beach people at Santa Monica.
