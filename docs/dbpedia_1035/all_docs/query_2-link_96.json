        "text": "Album notes by Dweezil Zappa - August 1996 Greetings music lovers, Dweezil here. The Zappa family would like to thank you for choosing this particular audio experience. We’ve tried to create an album that celebrates some of Frank’s greatest musical achievements not only as a composer but as a guitarist. When Frank was asked whether or not he felt he had written or recorded anything that was unique or special to him he replied: “Yes”. He then mentioned the names of 3 guitar instrumentals: “Black napkins”, “Zoot allures” and “Watermelon in easter hay”. He considered these his “signature pieces”. We would like to share Frank’s signature guitar compositions with you. We felt the title “Frank Zappa Plays the Music of Frank Zappa - A Memorial Tribute” was appropriate because only Frank can play his signature guitar pieces. His tone, his phrasing and his personality are what defines them. The best way to honor him is to listen with what Frank would refer to as “big ears”. Without the conscious use of reason or technical command of music language you will immediately find yourself understanding the complex musical conversations that inhabit this record. Frank’s most fearless improvisational guitar solos or “air sculptures” as he liked to refer to them ▲, often revolved around deceptively simple themes. A few of those simple themes transformed themselves into Frank’s signature guitar compositions. Rare combinations of beautiful melodies and raw creativity blended with unusual guitar tones, constructed on top of perspicaciously astute drumming make these compositions instantly recognizable to those already familiar with his music. “Black napkins”, “Zoot allures” and “Watermelon in easter hay” are collected here for the first time. For those of you experiencing Frank’s music for your first time as well as his longtime aficionados, here’s the part that makes this record unique: the UMRK Vault, which is full of modern day archaeological treasures, was meticulously scoured for several weeks in search of early recordings of the above-mentioned tunes. To our delight and hopefully yours, we were able to locate versions of these compositions in forms that predate the originals. We have combined these never-before-released performances with the well-known album performances to allow your ears to hear the intriguing developmental process. Without words Frank was able to communicate his ideas, emotions and his personality to international audiences. All he needed was his guitar. “Black napkins”, “Zoot allures” and especially “Watermelon in easter hay” speak volumes about Frank and his vast imagination. And they certainly speak to me like no other guitar compositions I’ve ever heard. Frank’s guitar playing, however enigmatic or idiosyncratically phrased, was also firmly rooted in the blues. I’m extremely thrilled for you to be able to hear what we were surprised to find, a bonus track. “Merely a blues in A” is the most wicked, obstreperous, bad ass blues jam I’ve heard Frank play. Never known to stick to the rules, what makes this performance so unique is Frank’s adherence to standard blues form and his wonderful homage to his friend and guitar hero, Johnny “Guitar” Watson. You even hear a moment of “Big Swifty” if you listen carefully. When you run out of songs to play in Paris and all else fails, play the blues. I hope you enjoy this record. Here’s to Frank and his guitar!\n\nNotes by Gail Zappa - November 15, 2012 “Frank Zappa Plays the Music of Frank Zappa - A Memorial Tribute” is a title that remains wildly amusing to all of us Other Zappas. So far no one else has taken up the challenge and who could do it better than FZ anyway? Right. And yes, this is also the origin and inspiration for the name of what is now Dweezil’s band, “Zappa Plays Zappa”. And who could do that better? Exactly. Round about 20 years or so ago it occurred to me to ask Frank if he wanted to restrict any works in any way. I realize this is an odd question but in 1992 he had done so with a couple of the pieces from the “Yellow Shark” performances - because he himself IS the main instrument necessary to the performance of the Work. This was the context and his answer was immediate. He named “Zoot Allures”, “Black Napkins” and “Watermelon in Easter Hay”. He said he did not want anyone to play them because they are his “Signature Guitar Compositions.” Simple. Direct. Like the Wave that rises in the One Great Deep - the Weighty Ocean Blanket - when tectonic havoc murks about and messes up her bed. I was at once unmade and undone. And salty. No one can own Frank Zappa’s signature - by pen, baton, or guitar. It is of his hand to his last note - and his last rest. Many people have asked why FZ’s gravesite is unmarked. Still. I have my answer albeit in the form of a question: How is it possible that a mere stone, a stele, a tablet, a monolithic memorial marker could possibly serve proper notice of the existence of this man? This Human who is no longer Being. He is exactly Still. Infinitely Silent. So I decided differently. Frank told me I would know what to do. He was correct. This is what I came to understand. This is his mark. These 3 Guitar Songs. They are forever fixed in the now of the anytime you want to hear them. HERE. Go on. Dance on his Humor (which is very much the opposite of Grave)."
