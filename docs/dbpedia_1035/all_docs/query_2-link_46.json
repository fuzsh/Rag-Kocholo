He was rarely out of the public eye, releasing more than 60 albums during his lifetime. Many more have been released posthumously.\n\nHe played Vancouver several times, beginning in 1968.\n\n“Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention won yet another battle last night in their war against uptight society,” Ken Spotswood reported in The Province on Aug. 26, 1968. “The battlefield was the Kerrisdale Arena, a dismal hall usually inhabited by the teenage ice-skating population, but with the implements of guitars, electricity and a dash of musical virtuosity, was quickly transformed into an electric icebox.”\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nFrom the get-go, Zappa’s use of satire and naughty words upset many people.\n\n“Some people think we’re obscene, but that’s just a lot of poop,” Zappa told the Kerrisdale Arena crowd. “We’re relatively competent musicians and we will attempt to provide you with some musical accompaniment not usually provided in underdeveloped countries.”\n\nZappa’s name would also become a synonym for weird music and behaviour. Some critics loved him, others slagged him for being uneven.\n\n“Face it, Frank Zappa’s 20 years as a master of composition now amounts to the most artful of trivial pursuits,” wrote Tom Harrison of The Province in 1984. “You can watch the band clowning around onstage and be impressed, or listen to its virtuosity and be awed. But it would be hard to deny that Zappa has ‘pooched’ himself into the litter-box of no return.”\n\nZappa was dismissive of his critics, defining rock journalists “people who can’t write, doing interviews with people who can’t think, in order to prepare articles for people who can’t read.”\n\nHis lyrics were often hilarious, but he was deadly serious when the Parents’ Music Resource Centre attacked rock lyrics in the mid-1980s. Zappa donned a suit to defend musicians before a Senate committee.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, (and) infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children,” he stated.\n\n“No one has forced Mrs. Baker or Mrs. Gore (of the PMRC) to bring Prince or Sheena Easton into their homes. Thanks to the Constitution, they are free to buy other forms of music for their children. Apparently, they insist on purchasing the works of contemporary recording artists in order to support a personal illusion of aerobic sophistication.\n\n“Ladies, please be advised: The $8.98 purchase price does not entitle you to a kiss on the foot from the composer or performer in exchange for a spin on the family Victrola.”\n\nZappa died of prostate cancer at his home in Los Angeles. He was just 52.\n\njmackie@vancouversun.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
