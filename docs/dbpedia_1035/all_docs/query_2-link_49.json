        "text": "Tom Fowler, the bassist for Frank Zappa, Mothers of Invention and Ray Charles, died on Tuesday, July 2 due to complications from aneurysm he suffered the previous week. He was 73.\n\nEngineer and producer Dennis Moody shared the news and wrote a tribute for Fowler in a post on Facebook.\n\n“Tom Fowler. One of the most creative, intelligent, and wackiest people I’ve ever met,” Moody wrote in the caption with a photo of him posing with Fowler. “Tom played bass on a half dozen Frank Zappa albums, and as well of the last 10 years with Ray Charles. I met Tom and his brother Walt when I was 20 years old. He and I remained friends forever, touring the world and making lots of incredible music. Tom passed away yesterday from complications of an aneurysm he suffered last week. He will be truly missed. Condolences to his wife Kai and the rest of his family.”\n\nArthur Barrow, who was the bassist for Frank Zappa in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, also shared a tribute of Fowler in a Facebook post.\n\n“He was a hero to me,” Barrow wrote in the caption of Fowler posing with a woman assumed to be a fan. “The first time I heard Echidna’s I almost fell over when he played the big 5/16 lick on the bass! I had no idea that a clumsy bass could do such a thing! He was an inspiration for me to buy a bass and start practicing. I have known him since about 1976. RIP old friend — missing you very much.”\n\nFowler was born on June 10, 1951 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and played the violin at early age before eventually switching over to bass. He made his debut working with Zappa on 1973′s “Over-Nite Sensation,” which also featured his brother, Bruce Fowler, on the trombone. Fowler played the bass for Zappa albums throughout the rest of the ‘70s until 1978′s “Studio Tan.”\n\nFowler played bass for other artists like George Duke, Jean-Luc Ponty and Steve Hackett as well as jazz fusion band, Air Pocket, which featured his brothers Bruce, Walt and Steve. He also played with Ray Charles from 1993 to 2004 and worked on his final studio album, “Genius Loves Company,” which was posthumously released and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2005.\n\nMore music coverage\n\nLegendary country and gospel star’s son dead at 65\n\nIconic record producer who worked with Rush and Alice Cooper dead at 73\n\nIconic singer of popular rap-rock ‘90s band dead at 49\n\nPopular ‘90s punk band’s founding member dead at 45\n\nNashville rock legend who worked with Elvis, dead at 84"
