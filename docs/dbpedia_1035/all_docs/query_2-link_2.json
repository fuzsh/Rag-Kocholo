That's why there are two Discography lists -- this one and Discography by recording date. This list documents when the albums were released themselves. Compilations are listed with underlines. Albums made with The Mothers of Invention are listed in italics. (Primarily) live releases are listed in bold. [However, if the live album contains all original music I will consider it \"studio\", as a venue is just a giant studio anyways.]\n\n1960s[]\n\nFreak Out!
