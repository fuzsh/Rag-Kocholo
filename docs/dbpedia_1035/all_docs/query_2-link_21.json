        "text": "“The poodle bites, the poodle chews it”- Dirty Love\n\nIf Frank Zappa hadn’t existed, it would certainly be necessary to invent him. As I look at the vast wasteland of garbage that passes for today’s music, I shudder to think how a Zappa would fit into this environment. I suppose he’d still be producing rock-oriented jazz/prog stuff with a bizarre sense of humor and totally juvenile attitude towards all things sex.\n\nAnd that’s why we love him. I’ve written about Zappa here,and here. It’s kinda hard to pick six tunes as, according to Wikipedia, “During his lifetime, Zappa released 62 albums. Since 1994, the Zappa Family Trust has released 57 posthumous albums, making a total of 119 albums.” But I’ll give it a shot but I will just scratch the surface. I categorized this post under rock and jazz-rock but you might just as well have a category called Frank Zappa and be done with it.\n\nOne Size Fits All is the tenth studio album by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, released in June 1975. It is the band’s last studio album. According to some dude on a chat board:\n\n“Zappa was inspired to write “Po-Jama People” by those in his band at the time, about 1973-74 . He felt that they were all such intellectuals that they were actually just boring.” Is that true? I don’t know. Frankly, it sounds more like Frank is bragging than complaining.\n\nYou know what you’re like. You are like a “Penguin in Bondage,” boy. As FZ himself explains,”The name of this song is Penguin in Bondage. It’s song that deals with the possible variations on a basic theme… And then the variations include maneuvres that might be executed with the aid of extra-terrestrial gratification.”\n\nIt goes on from there but you get the idea:\n\nFrom the great Apostrophe (‘) album comes “Uncle Remus” with a nice George Duke piano intro. This song, and in fact the whole album, really indicate what a strong R&B/blues/doo-wop background Zappa had in addition to his classical leanings and overall weirdness:\n\nI can’t wait ’til my fro is full-grown\n\nI’ll just throw away my do rag at home\n\nI’ll take a drive to Beverly Hills\n\nJust before dawn\n\nAn’ knock the little jockeys\n\nOff the rich people’s lawn\n\nAn’ before they get up\n\nI’ll be gone, I’ll be gone\n\nOver-nite Sensation was recorded more or less at the same time as Apostrophe (‘) but precded the latter. Fun story – Zappa hired Tina Turner and the Ikettes to sing backup.\n\nIke came in, listened, said “What is this shit?” and insisted that they remain uncredited. So you will hear Tina and the lovely Ikettes singing not only on “Montana” but also on one of Zappa’s more juvenile (yet funky) tunes, “Dirty Love.” I bet Tina dug the whole thing:\n\nGive me your dirty love\n\nLike some tacky little pamphlet\n\nIn your daddy’s bottom drawer\n\nGive me your dirty love\n\nJust like your mama make her fuzzy poodle do\n\nAs you may well know, Zappa wasn’t entirely about jerking around in songs and sometimes just played the tunes.\n\n“Joe’s Garage is a three-part rock opera.The story is told by a character identified as the “Central Scrutinizer” narrating the story of Joe, an average adolescent male, from Canoga Park, Los Angeles, who forms a garage rock band, has unsatisfying relationships with women, gives all of his money to a government-assisted and insincere religion, explores sexual activities with appliances, and is imprisoned. After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized, he lapses into insanity.”\n\nTommy it is not. And in fact, this tune, “On the Bus,” sounds less like any of that and more like something that would have fit in nicely with with Wired-era Jeff Beck:\n\nThere are times in “San Ber’dino” where it sounds more like you’re listening to ZZ Top. Again, from One Size Fitas All:"
