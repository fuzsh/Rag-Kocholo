        "text": "Guitarist Dweezil Zappa will take “like father, like son” quite literally when he and his band, Zappa Plays Zappa, perform Sunday, July 26, at the Sherman Theater.\n\nZappa Plays Zappa's tour marks the 40th anniversary of Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention's final studio album, “One Size Fits All.” The tribute band performs said album in full, plus an additional 70 to 75 minutes worth of music from Frank's catalog. As he does on other select tour dates, Dweezil will teach a guitar masterclass prior to Sunday's concert.\n\nA self-taught composer and performer, Frank — who died in 1993 — wrote and produced rock, jazz, classical, electronic and experimental music. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.\n\nAside from Dweezil — who like his dad, is a singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist — Zappa Plays Zappa consists of: Ben Thomas, lead vocals and multi-instrumentalist; Scheila Gonzalez, multi-instrumentalist and vocals; Ryan Brown, drums; Chris Norton, keyboards and vocals; and Kurt Morgan, bass.\n\nPrior to the Pocono show, Dweezil took time to discuss his father's music, the tribute band and his new album (which includes a track co-written with Frank), among other topics.\n\nWhat are your earliest memories of hearing your father's music?\n\nI remember hearing it around the house. I also remember going to his concerts when I was young, around 5 or so. I loved watching him play guitar. There were some red loud speakers covered in a fuzzy material that I used to sit on by the side of the stage. I remember falling asleep while they were vibrating to the music. I always loved his music and especially his guitar playing.\n\nAt what point did you realize you wanted to pursue music?\n\nI was 12. I had been playing guitar for only nine months. I was given a great opportunity to record two songs with my little teenage band in my dad's studio. So it was early on that I was serious about music.\n\nYour official solo debut was 1986 (at nearly 15), but I read that Eddie Van Halen produced material for you when you were 12?\n\nThe songs Edward worked on were not allowed to be credited to him as a producer because of his contract with Warner Bros. at the time. It was a single I made. The songs were called “My Mother is a Space Cadet” and the flip side “Crunchy Water.” It was an amazing experience. I got to learn how to do overdubs in the studio from Edward. Things like playing along with what you previously played before punching in, etc. I got to watch him get a guitar tone with Don Landee engineering. He had his main Frankenstein guitar at the studio, but we never used it on the record. He had given me a Kramer guitar and I used that on the record. Three years later, my dad produced my full-length debut album “Havin' a Bad Day.” That too was quite a learning experience.\n\nHow did you prepare for Zappa Plays Zappa? I know you were against it being a revolving door of Zappa alumni.\n\nI studied the music for two years and retooled my approach to playing guitar at that time. I was against using alumni then and now because my goal was to put a band together that was new young musicians that could play the music commensurate with the way it was played by my dad. A younger band was important because, as you can imagine, a band of 70-year-old musicians (great as they may be) have less of a chance of attracting a younger audience. For the music to carry forward into the future, a younger audience needs to discover the music for themselves and a younger band is easier to relate to.\n\nAfter years of alternate picking skills, was it a challenge to change your approach to playing guitar?\n\nI have described it as getting a lobotomy and then training for the Olympics. I had to unlearn more than 25 years of ingrained technique and habits, and then replace them with new techniques and thought processes. So, yes it was a huge challenge. I knew I could do it because I related it to what I knew about Randy Rhoads' transformation between Quiet Riot and Ozzy. He improved so much so fast. I knew it was possible with a lot of work.\n\nYour band has had some special guests — Steve Vai, Napoleon Murphy Brock, Terry Bozzio and Ray White, among others. Are others planned for the future?\n\nWe've played with other guests, as well. We had George Duke join us in 2010. His performances will be released on an upcoming DVD; we play the entire “Apostrophe” record and a bunch of other songs. We have no plans for any future guests at this time.\n\nAside from performing “One Size Fits All” in full on the current tour, do you alter the setlist for the additional songs?\n\nWe do change the setlist sometimes. It all relates to how we are feeling and what we are inspired to play that day. It is complicated to change things a lot because of how my gear is programmed. I need to be able to access specific sounds for specific songs. That programming takes time so there is usually a pool of about 30 songs to choose from and I plan accordingly. A typical show may have as many as 22 songs, so that means eight to 10 rotate in and out.\n\nWhat are some of your favorites from your father's catalog?\n\nAlbums? “Apostrophe,” “Over-Nite Sensation,” “Joe's Garage,” “Zappa in New York,” “Zoot Allures,” “Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar,” “The Yellow Shark.” So many of my favorite songs are on those records.\n\nTalk a little bit about your guitar class. Do you get a good mix of skill levels?\n\nI decided to start teaching because I had so many people asking me how I had made such a big difference in my own playing. I felt I had some good shortcuts that could help people quickly gain a new perspective on the guitar neck. I also had some ideas to share about utilizing complex rhythms in improvisation. I recently put all of that together in two courses for truefire.com. The courses are called Dweezology Fretboard Freedom and Phrase Generators. At my classes, I do get a good mix. I like teaching all levels. I have also done an immersive music camp called Dweezilla. I've taken a hiatus from that, but I plan to bring the event back next year.\n\nYour last solo album was in 2006. Any plans for a follow-up?\n\nI have a new album I just finished, “Via Zammata'.” It is coming out in August. It's a mixture of different material, mostly vocal tunes. It has a few instrumentals, though. I played fretless guitar on many tunes.\n\nYou've played guitar on other act's recordings, such as Spinal Tap and “Weird Al” Yankovic. Any plans for more guest appearances?\n\nI like playing on other people's records. I recently played on Nellie McKay's record. She did a cover of “Hungry Freaks, Daddy.”\n\nWhat's the latest on your 75-minute “What the Hell Was I Thinking?” project? Back in the 2000s, you said it had about 35 guitar players on it, including Brian May of Queen, Eddie Van Halen, Eric Johnson, and Angus and Malcolm Young of AC/DC.\n\nThat record is best described as an audio movie. I have a lot more work I still have to do on it. It will be a very interesting record when it's completed. It changes textures, timbres and styles from moment to moment. I'd like to mix it in surround sound.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nZappa Plays Zappa: “One Size Fits All” 40th Anniversary Tour\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Sunday\n\nWhere: Sherman Theater, 524 Main St., Stroudsburg\n\nCost: $44.50, $34.50 and $27.50 for standard admission; $69.50 for VIP, which includes a soundcheck party at 5:30 p.m.\n\nInformation: 570-420-2808 or shermantheater.com\n\nKEY NOTES\n\nDweezil Zappa\n\nBirthplace: Los Angeles\n\nParents and siblings: Frank and Gail Zappa; older sister, Moon; younger sister, Diva; and younger brother, Ahmet\n\nSpouse and children: Megan Marsicano and daughters, Zola Frank and Ceylon Indira Zappa\n\nMusic Highlights: Recording six solo albums, plus two with Ahmet under the group name “Z”; playing guitar on multiple Frank Zappa albums, as well as tracks like Don Johnson's “Heartbeat,” The Fat Boys' “Wipe Out” and Winger's cover of \"Purple Haze\"; launching Zappa Plays Zappa in 2006 and since releasing multiple live albums; and snaring, with Zappa Plays Zappa, the 2009 Best Rock Instrumental Performance Grammy for the band's take on Frank's “Peaches en Regalia”\n\nTV/Film Highlights: MTV VJ in the 1980s; roles in the 1980s films “The Running Man” and “Pretty in Pink,” as well as voicework on the 1990s animated series “Duckman: Private Dick/Family Man”; and co-host, with then-flame Lisa Loeb, of the 2004 cooking show “Dweezil & Lisa” on Food Network."
