        "text": "Diva Zappa‘s contributions to the recent aaafnraaa birthday bundle digital release on Frank’s 68th birthday are excellent… very quirky, she’s very much a Zappa offspring. It’s on iTunes. The whole album’s worth owning, especially for a Zappa fan. Diva’s tracks are “Alice” (my fave) and “Espanoza.” Melanie Starks take on “Dumb All Over” is another gem… of course, I’m quite fond of the lyrics to that one…\n\nThe tracklist for the album:\n\nDancin’ Fool (Disco Version) by Frank Zappa\n\nMore Trouble Every Day by FZ\n\nGorgeous Inca by FZ\n\nAncient Armaments by FZ\n\nAmerica The Beautiful by FZ\n\nYou’re A Mean One Mr. Grinch by Dweezil & Ahmet Zappa\n\nSaturday Girl by Dweezil\n\nAlice by Diva Zappa\n\nEspanoza by Diva\n\nDumb All Over by Melanie Starks\n\nTwenty Small Cigars by Joe Travers\n\nLacksadaisial by Joe Travers\n\nDirty Love by Cree Summer (Dweezil & Ahmet)\n\n~Dan – np: the aforementioned aaafnraaa\n\nPS- “aaafnraaa” stands for “anything anytime anywhere for no reason at all again,” a motto of Frank’s."
