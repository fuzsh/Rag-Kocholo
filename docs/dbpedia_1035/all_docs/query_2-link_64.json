        "text": "The loss of a famous musician often feels like that of a good friend, and the best posthumous rock albums act as a great way to remember the fallen artists who mean so much to us. This list features full-length albums from some of history's top rock (and alternative rock) musicians that were released after we lost the artists behind them. Suffice to say, even though these rock stars did not get to appreciate the success of these LPs during their life, we're very thankful for the fact that we have them now.\n\nPosthumously released records like Jimi Hendrix's The Cry of Love and Valleys of Neptune stand up to the rest of his discography, while Janis Joplin's Pearl and Joy Division's Closer (released two months prior to singer Ian Curtis's passing) perhaps the fallen artists' most-beloved works, and are typically considered among the best posthumous albums of any genre. Some albums on this list aren't always considered posthumous releases because the bands in question went on to record further albums with a replacement member. Such is the case for the Rolling Stones' Let It Bleed, but we have included it because we consider Brian Jones to have been as important a part of the group as Mick or Keith.\n\nWhat do you think are the best posthumous rock albums of all time? Vote up your favorites below, and be sure to add any that you think we might have missed.\n\nAlbum Released: 1998\n\nMusician's Death: 1997\n\nSketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk is a collection of polished studio tracks and four-track demos recorded by Jeff Buckley. Buckley was dissatisfied with material recorded in the summer of 1996 and early in 1997 and continued working on demo recordings to refine his sound. The album was to be titled My Sweetheart, the Drunk, but was never finished, as the rest of the band were traveling to meet Buckley at the time of his death. The album was released posthumously on May 26, 1998. Despite its unfinished state, the album garnered many positive reviews; The Onion's AV Club called it \"frustratingly incomplete, but mostly remarkable.\" The album's original sessions were produced by Television frontman Tom Verlaine. \"My Sweetheart the Drunk\" was the working title that Buckley used while writing and recording the album. The title was intended by his mother and sole heir of his estate, Mary Guibert, to be rendered with parentheses, as Sketches. This was because Jeff's work was not finished, and therefore was just an outline, or \"sketch,\" of what would have been released.\n\nAlbum Released: 1994\n\nMusician's Death: 1994\n\nMTV Unplugged in New York is a live album by the American grunge band Nirvana. It features an acoustic performance taped at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993, for the television series MTV Unplugged. The show was directed by Beth McCarthy and first aired on the cable television network MTV on December 16, 1993. As opposed to traditional practice on the television series, Nirvana played a setlist composed of mainly lesser-known material and cover versions of songs by The Vaselines, David Bowie, Meat Puppets, and Lead Belly. MTV Unplugged in New York was the first Nirvana album released following the death of Kurt Cobain. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has become the group's most successful posthumous release, having been certified 5x platinum in the United States by 1997. It also won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996. The performance was released on DVD in 2007.\n\nAlbum Released: 2006\n\nMusician's Death: 2003\n\nAmerican V: A Hundred Highways is the 93rd overall album and a posthumous album by Johnny Cash released on July 4, 2006. As the title implies, it is the fifth entry in Cash's American series. Like its predecessors, American V: A Hundred Highways is produced by Rick Rubin and released on Rubin's American Recordings record label via Lost Highway Records, as they currently distribute country releases from the American Recordings label. It was certified Gold on 8/18/2006 by the RIAA.\n\nAlbum Released: 1974\n\nMusician's Death: 1973\n\nGrievous Angel is the second solo album by Gram Parsons, compiled from summer 1973 sessions and released four months after his death from a heroin and alcohol overdose in September 1973. It received great critical acclaim upon release, but failed to find commercial success, a fate shared with his previous efforts solo and with The Flying Burrito Brothers. Grievous Angel peaked at number 195 on the Billboard charts. Despite its modest sales, it is viewed as a successful example of the hybrid between country and rock and roll Parsons called \"Cosmic American Music\". In 2003, the album was ranked number 429 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n5\n\nPearl\n\nJanis Joplin\n\nAlbum Released: 1971\n\nMusician's Death: 1970\n\nPearl is a musical album by Janis Joplin.\n\nAlbum Released: 1995\n\nMusician's Death: 1991 (Freddie Mercury)\n\nMade in Heaven is the fifteenth album by British rock band Queen, released on 6 November 1995 on Parlophone and Hollywood Records. Until the release of Queen Forever in 2014, it was the final album featuring the band's original line up. After Freddie Mercury's death, bass player John Deacon, drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May worked with vocal and piano parts that Mercury recorded before his death, adding fresh instrumentation to the recordings. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album debuted at #1 in the UK where it went 4× platinum. According to The Guardian, it has sold 20 million copies worldwide."
