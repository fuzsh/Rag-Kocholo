        "text": "What Is Cree Summer Francks' Net Worth?\n\nCree Summer Francks is a Canadian-American actress, voiceover artist, and musician who has a net worth of $4 million. Cree Summer Francks' professional acting career began in the world of voiceovers when she was cast as Penny in the original \"Inspector Gadget\" cartoon. Her work on \"Inspector Gadget\" led to voiceover roles in such projects as \"The Care Bears Movie\" and \"Ewoks.\" Since then, she has built an impressive resume of cartoon and video game projects, including, \"Robot Chicken,\" \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" \"Rugrats,\" \"All Grown Up, \"Sonic the Hedgehog,\" \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire,\" \"My Life as a Teenage Robot,\" \"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance,\" \"Final Fantasy X,\" \"X-Men Legends,\" \"Mass Effect,\" and \"World of Warcraft.\" She also had co-starring and guest-starring roles on such television shows as \"A Different World,\" \"Living Single,\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\"\n\nEarly Life\n\nCree Summer Francks was born on July 7, 1969, in Los Angeles, California. She grew up in Saskatchewan and Toronto, Canada. Her parents are both Canadian actors – Don Francks and Lili \"Red Eagle\" Francks. Her mother is part Plains Cree, one of Canada's largest First Nations. While Cree was a child, she traveled often with her parents around British Columbia and did not start public school until the age of nine when the family moved to Toronto. She grew up with her brother, Rainbow Sun Francks, who also became an actor and public figure.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1983, Francks began her acting career when she was cast as Penny in the first season of the original version of \"Inspector Gadget.\" She then was cast in voice acting roles in \"The Care Bears Movie\" and \"Ewoks\" in 1985. In 1988, she was cast as Winifred \"Freddie\" Brooks in \"A Different World,\" a spin-off of \"The Cosby Show. She remained on the show as a regular cast member through its conclusion in 1993.\n\nWhile on \"A Different World,\" she continued working in voice acting. From 1983 to 2006, Francks voiced over 100 animated characters in video games, cartoon series, animated films, and commercials. Some of her most famous roles were in \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" as Elymra Duff, \"Rugrats\" as Susie Carmichael, \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" as Cleo the Poodle, \"As Told by Ginger\" as Miranda, \"Drawn Together\" as Foxxy Love, \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" as Dulcy the Dragon, \"Danny Phantom\" as Valerie Gray, \"Codename: Kids Next Door\" as Numbah 5 and Cree Lincoln, \"Barbie as Rapunzel\" as Penelope, \"Transformers: Animated\" as Blackarachnia, and \"My Life as a Teenage Robot\" as Tiff.\n\nIn terms of video games, Cree can be heard as characters in \"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance,\" \"Diablo III,\" \"Heroes of the Storm,\" \"Fallout,\" \"Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits,\" \"Final Fantasy X,\" \"The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,\" \"Pitfall: The Lost Expedition,\" \"World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria,\" \"Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinite Gauntlet,\" \"Skylander,\" \"Batman: Arkham Asylum,\" and \"Wildstar,\" among others.\n\nIn addition to acting and voice acting, Francks has also had a career in music. She began singing at an early age and joined her first band at the age of 13. In 1985, she recorded the theme song for \"OWL/TV.\" In 1990, she sang background vocals on two tracks for her friend Jasmine Guy's self-titled album. In 1993, she released an album with her band Subject to Change, in which she sang lead vocals. However, Capital Records, where she was signed, did not release the album due to creative differences. The tracks were produced and distributed separately. Despite the setback, the band remained popular and developed a fanbase who enjoyed their rock-soul fusion sound and the political undertones of the music.\n\nIn 1999, Francks released her solo album \"Street Faërie,\" which was produced by Lenny Kravitz, who is also featured on the album. She then toured with Kravitz as his opening act. However, her label soon after dropped her, though they continued to promote her album. Cree then recorded a song called \"Savior Self\" and directed the music video for the song, which starred Zoë Kravitz. The video was screened online, but the track was never made available commercially. In 2008, Francks appeared on \"The Frank Zappa AAAFNRAAA Birthday Bundle\" and performed a cover of Zappa's song \"Dirty Love.\" Cree has cited Frank Zappa, Al Green, and Dinah Washington among her musical influences.\n\nFrancks can also be heard singing through many of the animated characters she provided voices for. Some of these include Foxxy Love in \"Drawn Together,\" Numbah 5 from \"Codename: Kids Next Door,\" and Elmyra Duff in \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" among others.\n\nCree has also had a few live-action roles throughout her acting career. She appeared in the short-lived television series \"Sweet Justice\" in 1994 until it was canceled in 1995. She also starred in the primetime drama \"Courthouse,\" though it was canceled after two months. She made a number of guest appearances on shows like \"Living Single,\" \"Better Things,\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 2013, Cree married producer Angelo Pullen. They had their first child, a daughter named Brave Littlewing, in 2011. In 2013, they had a second daughter named Hero Peregrine. Francks also has a son, Miles Franklin, who was born in 1998 while she was in a previous relationship. Pullen adopted Miles while they were married. The couple announced their divorce in 2022 after nearly ten years of marriage.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 1991, Cree paid $550,000 for a home in Sherman Oaks, California. She appears to still own this home today. Its current estimated value is $2 million."
