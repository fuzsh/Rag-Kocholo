        "text": "Frank Zappa’s final album, Dance Me This, will be posthumously released this June, and it will serve as the late musician’s 100th official release, according to Gigwise.\n\nDespite the fact that the news of the release was posted on April Fool’s Day, JamBase reports that an email sent by Zappa’s family confirmed the release. The email said that Dance Me This \"is the last title FZ finished in 1993 along with Trance-Fusion; the last chapter in his Master Work, Civilization, Phase III; and of course, The Rage & The Fury, The Music of Edgard Varèse.\"\n\nThe release of Dance With Me has supposedly been in the works for over a decade. While Zappa’s estate has released other posthumous albums since his death, there were said to have been promo cassettes for Dance With Me that surfaced in 2004.\n\nNo release date for the album has been set, but Dance With Me is reportedly expected to ship on or around June 1. You can pre-order the album now.\n\nZappa first discussed Dance With Me in an interview with Guitarist Magazine released in June 1993, months before his death. \"And what I'm working on right at the moment is a Synclavier album called Dance Me This, which is designed to be used by modern dance groups,” he said. “It's probably not going to come out until next year.”"
