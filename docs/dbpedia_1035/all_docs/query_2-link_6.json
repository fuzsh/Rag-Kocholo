        "text": "I picked up the Yellow Shark this week. It is my first foray into this type of Zappa music so I am proceeding with caution.\n\nReally? Both of you picked this one? I dont remember you guys saying much about it on the thread we had on Monkies.\n\nGuess I'll have to pick this one up. Two heavy hitters cant be wrong...\n\nAbsolutely! I got it when it first came out. I couldn't stop raving about it. I was listening to it constantly.\n\nIt is as important an album as anything he released during his lifetime.\n\nLather, as it was originally conceived plus some bonus material, was released after his death.\n\nHence, I only voted for three..... Lather would have easily been my fourth.\n\nMystery Disc was 2 LPs during Frank's lifetime, providing you shelled out the $$$ for the boxes.\n\nWell, there are a lot of these that I haven't heard, so no vote from me. I actually have a couple of the project/objects on order right now and, from what I've read, I'd expect them to do very well, but Wazoo and Lost Episodes are probably the ones jumping out at me right now.\n\nLather would be a given if it were on the list: it's one of my main go-to albums for Zappa.\n\nSomebody please tell me, are these posthumous titles not available in shops? I almost never see one. There's one shop here in the Netherlands that has some of them, but they don't exactly come cheap, which makes me think they buy them online themselves at full-price .\n\nThe only shop in the Netherlands where I've seen the posthumous titles released on the Vaulternative label is Concerto in Amsterdam. You can get them a little cheaper online at www.jpc.de\n\nThanks for the link!\n\nCorrect, Concerto is the place where I'd seen them. And the various Plato shops (which I believe Concerto is a part of nowadays).\n\nWazoo and Imaginary Diseases are available on Amazon for reasonable prices, but most are sold through the Zappa site.\n\nThat is titled \"FZ:OZ\" and is on the list.\n\nThis is a tough call. I really enjoy QuAUDIOPHILIAc, Trance-fusion, One Shot Deal. Halloween is from one of my favorite Zappa bands (wish there was more available from this October 78 run), while the other new live discs (ID, Buffalo, Wazzoo Hammersmith ... keep 'em coming) are great. Imaginary Diseases I also like as a document from an under documented band. The 4 disc MoFO was a real tour de force. But in the end, Lumpy Money is my top choice. Two seminal albums with all the extra material and a great booklet make it essential and a great listen. Hopefully more to come from the ZFT. So my 4:\n\n1 Lumpy Money\n\n2 MoFO\n\n3 QuAUDIOPHILIAc\n\n4 Halloween\n\nLumpy Money is by far my most listened to and favourite apres-Frank release. Other choices would be Hammersmith, Imaginary Diseases, and Mofo. Even though it never gets much disussion, I always loved FZPTMOFZ, which was an amazing study in Franks guitar playing, and even though it had some versions we already heard, it made me appreciate them even more.\n\nTo me, Buffalo is the best of the lot. Frank had a very inspired evening that night and his solos on Pick Me, I'm Clean, City Of Tiny Lites, Easy Meat and Torture Never Stops shows are beyond this world. If you like Frank's solos and haven't heard this yet you have bliss ahead of you."
