        "text": "The last album that guitarist Frank Zappa worked on prior to his death in December 1993 will finally be released this June. Titled Dance Me This, the LP is considered the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer’s 100th and final official release, ending a legacy that began with the Mothers of Invention’s landmark 1966 album Freak Out! According to a pre-order page on the Zappa official site, Dance Me This is due out June 1st.\n\nIn talking to Guitar Magazine prior to his death at the age of 52, Zappa described his final LP as “a Synclavier album called Dance Me This, which is designed to be used by modern dance groups. It’s probably not going to come out until next year,” the Guardian reports. The album was ultimately shelved indefinitely, and while a steady stream of posthumous releases and reissues have satisfied Zappa fans in the following decades, Dance Me This was all but forgotten until Zappa’s widow Gail Zappa began hinting at the final album’s eventual arrival in 2011.\n\nTrending\n\nAccording to the Zappa Family Trust, Dance Me This is “the last title FZ finished in 1993 along with Trance-Fusion; the last chapter in his Master Work, Civilization Phaze III.” “This is it. #100. The LAST album by Frank Zappa. Tap your foot algorithmically to this, ” the estate adds. The album’s title track reportedly features a recording of Tuvan “throat singers,” members of a northern China tribe that Zappa accompanied with a Synclavier composition."
