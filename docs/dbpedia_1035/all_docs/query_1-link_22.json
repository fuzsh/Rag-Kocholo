        "text": "I believe the 2012 re-release is identical to the original Ryko.\n\nI've probably not made myself clear\n\nThe list is really for myself and those who came to Zappa's catalogue since the 2012 reissues. I wanted to compile a list of individual songs and albums that existed in different form before these editions.\n\nThe compilations are all pre-2012. I was not aware that they had been re-issued as part of the 2012 program. If you have them, then you are set. If not, then you need some of them for the different versions.\n\nThe Discogs page for that CD lists the time as 4:48 but has scans of the artwork listing it as 3:53. The 4:48 listing is probably a mistake.\n\nEDIT: in fact it is 4:48, as it includes the beginning of \"Don't You Ever Wash That Thing,\" apparently a custom edit for that compilation.\n\nI didn't buy either but the tracklists were interesting. Fitting for their bands, Fishman went with more of the 70's fusion style material while LaLonde's disc had more of the snide 80's stuff.\n\nYes, I remember seeing them back in the day. I was tempted at one point as I like an El-Malo album I have, but after all the Zappa comps, Ryko comps (Cheap Thrills, etc.) and Zappa Picks, I figured I could live without them having already bought the catalog on CD a few times over.\n\nTotally. Same reason I never bought the Zappa Picks comps. Those Cheap Thrill ones were a gateway for me. At the time I had a few Zappa cds, but mostly just listened to tapes a friend had made. I recall several of the cds in the catalogue were given a bargain price for a while, and it started me on a slow train to completism. I listened to those CT comps endlessly.\n\nI have this one too: Frank Zappa - Ditties And Beer\n\nAs a side note. The Strictly Commercial CD has several different versions of songs than the LP version does. I have them both, but cannot remember enough to post the details.\n\nYes, there are 4:\n\nDon't Eat The Yellow Snow (single version) Now available on 'ZAPPAtite'\n\nJoe's Garage (single version)\n\nMontana (single version)\n\nDancin' Fool (12\" version) Now available on 'The Frank Zappa AAAFNRAAA Birthday Bundle'"
