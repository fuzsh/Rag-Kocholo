        "text": "In 2012 there was a poll on Frank Zappa's posthumous releases:\n\nYour Favorite Frank Zappa Posthumous Releases\n\nI have been on a Zappa kick lately and I think it's time for an update. The top albums in the 2012 poll were Lumpy Money, MOFO, Wazoo, Lost Episodes, Imaginary Diseases, and Greasy Love Songs. The OP chose not to include Lather and Civilization III as he considered them part of the canon; also the poll has a 25 choice limit. That limit prevents me from doing a combined poll. There have been 20 releases since then!\n\nPlease vote for up to four.\n\nGlad that pre-2012 releases got discarded because I would have a hard time picking only four.\n\nMy two absolute favourites from the poll listing are: Road Tapes #2 and Roxy Performances. The cream of the live cream.\n\nThen I pick Little Dots and A Token of His Extreme, recorded by two great lineups.\n\nAnd if I had the fifth slot it would get filled by Halloween '77.\n\nAgreed! I love Steve Vai's line in the Imaginary Diseases liner notes, which I re-read just yesterday: \"... this plethora of unreleased recordings is so vast that even in the remainder of your life (no matter how old you are reading this) you will never get to hear all of it.\"\n\nAfter I found the 2012 poll I wasn't going to do this one, and then I looked at the list and couldn't believe how much quality music has been released in the past six years. My latest Zappa binge was kicked off by The Roxy Performances, which would probably be in my top 4 anyway.\n\nPS... I couldn't find the scene I was looking for;\n\nWhen Homer covers his ears and says, \"Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!\"\n\nI haven't heard the ROXY box yet, so....\n\nMy choice is:\n\nFiner moments: I don't know why, I love this double Lp (It's the only album from the list that has been issued on official vinyl format). Perhaps because it was created and planned by FZ himself and was almost released in 72 ?\n\nIt is the missing link between pre-70 Mothers and Chunga's revenge, to me\n\nChicago 1978: For me that's the best of the posthumous live albums. The sound and the mixing are just incredible. Just the drum sound alone makes this release a must-have\n\nCrux of the biscuit: Another great Projetc/Object making-of thing. Frankly I would have prefered to vote for Meat Light, but I was quite disapointed by it. So there.\n\nRoad Tapes: I voted for volume 2, but my vote goes for the whole series. I absolutely love the Road Tapes series ! I really wish it will go on and on, and that one day we will have something like \"Road Tapes Volume 32\" or something This is a collection that screams for multiple volumes.\n\n[QUOTE=\"Zongadude, post: 18267818, member: 26592]\n\nChicago 1978: For me that's the best of the posthumous live albums.

Frankly I would have prefered to vote for Meat Light, but I was quite disapointed by it. So there.\n\n.[/QUOTE]\n\nThese 2 would be my 5th and 6th choices.\n\nSo if you were a Zappa fan on a budget, would you recommend going for the Token of His Extreme DVD or CD? How is the 5.1 mix? It's a little weird, but I find that I rarely watch concert DVDs more than a few times, whereas I'm much more likely to listen to the CD.\n\nThere is no 5.1 mix. It's stereo only, mixed in 1974. The sound quality is phenomenal, but the mastering is a bit too loud."
