Next month Zappa Records will issue two posthumous new Frank Zappa albums. The new releases are made up of previously unreleased recordings stored in the Zappa Vault.

On July 15, Frank Zappa For President and The Crux Of The Biscuit will be released by Zappa Records/UMe. An album of Synclavier compositions and recordings, along with other appropriate selections, Frank Zappa For President features unreleased recordings of songs with a political theme throughout, including a remix of “Brown Shows Don’t Make It,” “If I Was President” and live versions of “When The Lie’s So Big” and “America The Beautiful.”

Culled from alternative rare mixes, studio outtakes and live performance tapings, The Crux Of The Biscuit was produced in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the 1974 Zappa LP Apostrophe (‘). It includes alternate renditions of such Apostrophe (‘) tracks as “Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow,” “Nanook Rubs It,” “Cosmik Debris,” “Uncle Remus” and the title track, along with other unreleased gems like “Down In De Dew” and “Energy Frontier.”
