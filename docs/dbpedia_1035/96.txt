Two albums of previously-unreleased Frank Zappa music are to come out on July 15.

‘Frank Zappa For President’ and ‘The Crux Of The Biscuit’ are the latest in a total of 40 posthumous albums released since Zappa’s death in 1993.

‘Frank Zappa For President’ consists of music mainly composed on the Synclavier. Zappa turned to the instrument on learning in 1990 that he had terminal prostate cancer. He mainly wrote modern classical music for the rest of his life.

A statement said: “We know that Frank wanted to run for office at various times. In the spirit of the dramatic 2016 presidential election adventures comes a release that gives us a glimpse into what could have been.”
