        "text": "Herman Brood (Zwolle, November 5, 1946 - Amsterdam, July 11, 2001) was a Dutch musician, artist and media personality. Herman Brood was the Dutch personification of sex and drugs and rock 'n roll.\n\nAfter playing in Cuby and the Blizzards and several other bands since 1964, in 1977 Herman started the group Herman Brood and his Wild Romance, which in the next year had the hit single Saturday Night. But even more than his music, it was his open statements about sex and drug use in the press that made Herman Brood famous in the Netherlands. He enjoyed this attention, and became the most famous hard drug user of the Netherlands. In the 1990s he took up painting, and he was as successful as a painter as he was as a singer/piano player.\n\nBy 2001, however, Herman's body was destroyed by alcohol and drugs. When it seemed that he had only a few months left, Herman took matters into his own hands and, depressive because of his drug rehabilitation, he committed suicide on 11 July by jumping off the Amsterdam Hilton.\n\nDiscography\n\nStreet (1977)\n\nShpritsz (1978)\n\nCha Cha (1978)\n\nGo Nutz (1980)\n\nWait a Minute...
