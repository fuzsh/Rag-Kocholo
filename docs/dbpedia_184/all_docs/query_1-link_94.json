        "text": "The Marshall Tucker Band is an American rock band from Spartanburg, South Carolina. Noted for incorporating blues, country, and jazz into an eclectic sound, the Marshall Tucker Band helped establish the Southern rock genre in the early 1970s. While the band had reached the height of its commercial success by the end of the decade, it has recorded and performed continuously under various line-ups for 50 years. Lead vocalist Doug Gray remains the only original member still active with the band.\n\nThe original line-up of the Marshall Tucker Band, formed in 1972, included lead guitarist, steel guitarist, vocalist, and primary songwriter Toy Caldwell (1947–1993), lead vocalist Doug Gray (born 1948), keyboard player, saxophone player, and flautist Jerry Eubanks (born 1950), rhythm guitarist George McCorkle (1946–2007), drummer Paul Riddle (born 1953), and bassist Tommy Caldwell (1949–1980). They signed with Capricorn Records and released their first album in 1973, The Marshall Tucker Band.\n\nAfter Tommy Caldwell was killed in a car accident in 1980, he was replaced by bassist Franklin Wilkie. Most of the original band members had left by the mid-1980s.[2] The band’s current line-up consists of Gray on vocals; keyboard player, saxophonist and flautist Marcus James Henderson; guitarists Chris Hicks and Rick Willis, bassist Tony Black, and drummer B.B. Borden.\n\nTogether Forever was the Marshall Tucker Band’s seventh studio album. It was produced by Stewart Levine, founder of CHISA records. This was the band’s last album produced for Capricorn Records. The name of the album reflects the Platonic love of the members towards one another.\n\nThe band’s follow-up album, their eighth and final album on the Capricorn label, would be a compilation album entitled Greatest Hits. (wikipedia)\n\nTogether Forever boasts a more mainstream rock approach than any of its predecessors, halfway between the country-tinged Long Hard Ride and the pop-oriented Carolina Dreams. Although the band sounds good, the songs don’t match the strength of their performances. (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine)\n\nThis is an overlooked gem in the catalog. Of course the first 4 albums are a must, but this one has plenty to offer. Lets not forget that The Marshall Tucker Band was one of the early jam bands who came out of the southern scene. This album really showcases the impeccable and adventurous musical chops that defined the best of Southern Rock. I’ll be Loving You opens the album and its a doozy. The guitar playing of Toy Caldwell is nothing less than superb, and this song absolutely smokes and cooks. Doug Grays voice soars majestically above it all.\n\nLove is a Mystery has a beautiful melody and features the usual brilliant horn arrangements of Jerry Eubanks; a trademark The MTB is known for. Once again, the intoxicating combination of Grays vocals and Caldwell’s screaming thumb-picked leads take the listener to a magical place where all is right in the universe. The second side of the album features another smoking track called Change is Gonna Come, which really combines all the elements of the band into one monster, mother of a song which should be played loudly, in the true spirit of Southern Rock. By all means give this album a serious listen, you won’t be disappointed.

He studied classical piano and toured South America for four and a half years in the 1930s with the Don Dean Orchestra. This tour began Denny’s fascination with Latin rhythms. Denny collected a large number of ethnic instruments from all over the world, which he used to spice up his stage performances.\n\nAfter serving in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, Denny returned to Los Angeles, in 1945 where he studied piano and composition under Dr. Wesley La Violette[5] and orchestration under Arthur Lange at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. He later studied at the University of Southern California.\n\nIn January 1954, Don the Beachcomber brought Denny to Honolulu, for a two-week engagement. He stayed to form his own combo in 1955, performing under contract at the Shell Bar in the Hawaiian Village on Oahu and soon signing to Liberty Records. The original combo consisted of Augie Colon on percussion and birdcalls, Arthur Lyman on vibes, John Kramer on string bass, and Denny on piano. Lyman soon left to form his own group and future Herb Alpert sideman and Baja Marimba Band founder Julius Wechter replaced him. Harvey Ragsdale later replaced Kramer.\n\n“We traveled a lot on the Mainland, but we came back every 12 weeks because the guys had their families here [in Hawaii],” recalled Denny. In 1955, the musician met his future wife, June, and married her the following year. His daughter, Christina was born a few years later. “I loved the lifestyle and my career was built here,” said Denny.\n\nDenny described the music his combo played as “window dressing, a background”.[8] He built a collection of strange and exotic instruments with the help of several airline friends. They would bring Denny back these instruments and he would build arrangements around them. His music was a combination of ethnic styles: South Pacific, the Orient and Latin rhythms.\n\nDuring an engagement at the Shell Bar, Denny discovered what would become his trademark and the birth of “exotica”. The bar had a very exotic setting: a little pool of water right outside the bandstand, rocks and palm trees growing around, very quiet and relaxed. As the group played at night, Denny became aware of bullfrogs croaking. The croaking blended with the music and when the band stopped, so did the frogs. He thought it was a coincidence at first, but when he tried the tune again later, the same thing happened. This time, his bandmates began doing all sorts of tropical bird calls as a gag. The band thought it nothing more than a joke. The next day, someone approached Denny and asked if he would do the arrangement with the birds and frogs. He agreed. At rehearsal, he had the band do “Quiet Village” with each doing a bird call spaced apart. Denny did the frog part on a grooved cylinder and the whole thing became incorporated into the arrangement of “Quiet Village”. It sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.\n\nThe album jacket was an influential factor guiding the fantasy of Denny’s music. Denny’s first dozen albums featured model Sandy Warner on the cover.\n\nArt designers always changed her looks to fit the mood of the package. For instance, we called one album with an African sound Afro-desia and Sandy dyed her hair blond for the photo session; she’s seen against a background of colorful African masks. When we did Hypnotique, which is surrealistic, she had dark hair. For Primitiva, she was photographed standing waist-deep in water.\n\nThe Exotica album was recorded in December 1956 and released in 1957. In 1958, Dick Clark hosted Denny on American Bandstand. “Quiet Village” reached #2 on Billboard’s charts in 1959 with the Exotica album reaching #1. He rode the charts of Cashbox and Variety also. Denny had as many as three or four albums on the charts simultaneously during his career. He had national hits with “A Taste of Honey”, “The Enchanted Sea”, and “Ebb Tide”.\n\nDenny died in Honolulu on March 2, 2005, aged 93. Following a private memorial service, his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nHis combo spawned two successful offshoots: Julius Wechter (of Tijuana Brass and Baja Marimba Band fame) and exotica vibist Arthur Lyman.\n\nDenny’s “Firecracker” is well known in Japan as the number which inspired Haruomi Hosono to establish Yellow Magic Orchestra; a “subversive” version of the song, according to Hosono, appears on the band’s eponymous debut album and was released as a single to promote it, charting at No. 60 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 18 on the Billboard R&B Singles charts. The song was later adapted into Jennifer Lopez’s “I’m Real”.\n\nFormer Psychic TV member Fred Giannelli released an album in 1991 entitled Fred;[16] the second track on that album is “Mr. Denny”, an instrumental tribute to Martin Denny that features excerpts of an interview with him.\n\nDenny’s recordings are prominently featured in the 1999 film Breakfast of Champions, based on the Kurt Vonnegut novel. This is primarily because the car dealership featured in the film is having a Hawaiian-based promotion.\n\nDenny’s music is a recurring theme in the Sandman Slim series of fantasy novels by Richard Kadrey, where his music is always playing on the jukebox in the Bamboo House of Dolls, “LA’s only punk tiki bar”.(wikipedia)\n\nOriginally released in 1958, Primitiva is a rhythmically rich and inimitably exotic Martin Denny experience. Reissued by Jackpot Records on limited edition lagoon blue color vinyl, Primitiva highlights the burgeoning sound of ’50s exotica music, with Denny’s diverse soundscape ranging from vibraphones and marimbas, to Burmese gongs and Buddhist prayer bowls. This third outing from the father of exotica shines in style with stand-out tracks like “Burma Train”, “M’Gambo Mambo”, and “Jamaica Farewell” spanning from the Caribbean coast, to the South Pacific islands, and beyond. Pairing perfectly with beachside Mai Tais and ornamental umbrellas, Primitiva is a hallmark of the mid-century’s lounge music fascination, and is replete with animal cries, pulsing percussion, and enough groovy goodness to keep it a mainstay of your rotation.\n\nReally great exotica, and really hard to find in the wild!

He rose to prominence as a member of the rock band the Yardbirds, and afterwards founded and fronted the Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice. In 1975, he switched to an instrumental style with focus on an innovative sound, and his releases spanned genres and styles ranging from blues rock, hard rock, jazz fusion and a blend of guitar-rock and electronica.\n\nBeck was ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone and other magazines’ lists rankings of the greatest guitarists. He was often called a “guitarist’s guitarist”. Rolling Stone described him as “one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock”.\n\nAlthough he recorded two successful albums (in 1975 and 1976) as a solo act, Beck did not establish or maintain commercial success like that of his contemporaries and bandmates. He recorded with many artists.\n\nBeck earned wide critical praise and received the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance six times and Best Pop Instrumental Performance once. In 2014, he received the British Academy’s Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: first as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and secondly as a solo artist (2009). (wikipedia)\n\nStanley Clarke (born June 30, 1951) is an American bassist, film composer and founding member of Return to Forever, one of the first jazz fusion bands. Clarke gave the bass guitar a prominence it lacked in jazz-related music. He is the first jazz-fusion bassist to headline tours, sell out shows worldwide and have recordings reach gold status.\n\nClarke is a 5-time Grammy winner, with 15 nominations, 3 as a solo artist, 1 with the Stanley Clarke Band, and 1 with Return to Forever.[4][5] Clarke was selected to become a 2022 recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship.\n\nA Stanley Clarke electric bass is permanently on display at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. (wikipedia)\n\nJeff Beck’s notable temperament is the source for much of his creativity onstage. It’s also the cause for his desire to expand his musical vocabulary and expression with other artists. The Jeff Beck Group is one such project, which was followed by works with Tim Bogart, Carmine Appice, and most notably with Jan Hammer.\n\nBut the project with Stanley Clarke stands out. According to the Jeff Beck Fanzine, when Beck was recording Blow By Blow he “was really into Stanley Clarke’s music. When he toured to promote Blow By Blow, he performed Clarke’s song Power in concert. Clarke heard about this and was knocked out by it. When Beck was around the area he dropped by his Long Island home and introduced himself. The two immediately began a friendship and Beck ended up playing on a few of his records.”\n\nThis tour of Japan and a tour of Europe in 1979 would be their only live appearances.\n\nClarke’s reputation among bass players is similar to Becks among guitarists. He’s known for his creativity, innovation and expanding the instrument’s use in musical composition and performance attaining star status as a solo artist. He was the first bass player to tour solo and each provides a fascinating foil for the other.\n\nSome suggest that Clarke’s efforts live were obscured by Beck, but that’s not exactly true. Most of the set is dominated by Beck’s numbers, but there are a fair number of Clarke’s songs which allow him to display his talent. Hearing them compliment (not dueling against) one another is a treat as well since Beck had never had such a lyrical bassist before.

He is widely recognized as one of the greatest orchestrators in jazz, playing an important role in the development of cool jazz, modal jazz, free jazz, and jazz fusion. He is best known for his acclaimed collaborations with Miles Davis. (wikipedia)\n\nA superb jazz arranger and bandleader, Gil Evans rivaled Ellington and Mingus in his ability to provide imaginative frameworks for individual voices within a large orchestra. He wrote elaborate, intricate arrangements that didn’t weaken or threaten his band’s spontaneity. His most renowned work came in the late ’50s, when Miles Davis signed with Columbia and brought Evans into the studio with a large ensemble. The resultant albums — Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), Sketches of Spain (1959) — became milestones in the careers of both men. Evans was hardly a purist; he began using electronics in his bands in the ’70s and scandalized some by recording Jimi Hendrix material. His style got looser in later years, with more space and less precision, but certainly his music remained compelling. Evans’ harmonic language, compositional and arranging skill were immense, and he was responsible for many masterpieces through either his arrangements, compositions, or conducting. (by Ron Wynn)\n\nA gifted pianist, composer and bandleader, Gil Evans is widely recognized as one of the greatest orchestrators in jazz, playing an important role in the development of cool jazz, modal jazz, free jazz, and jazz fusion.\n\nGil Evans is best known for music he wrote between 1957 and 1963 for his 19-piece orchestra, which backed trumpeter Miles Davis. The albums Sketches of Spain and Porgy and Bess were hailed for their rich harmonies and use of instruments not usually associated with jazz big bands. But in a 1980 interview, Evans said he wanted to use orchestral instruments in a new way: “Many great compositions have been written with the traditional sound of the orchestra. You know what I mean? Nothing much has been added to it as far as sound is concerned.”\n\nEvans gave the orchestra a different sound by creating unusual harmonies, using colors he borrowed from Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky. “I got the harmonic language from the French, Spanish and Russian Impressionists,” he said in the same interview. “That’s where the harmony comes from.”\n\nIn the 1960s, Evans updated his orchestra with electric guitars and synthesizers, but he continued to harmonize with his “close” note chords. In 1983, a week before his 71st birthday, Evans sat at the piano in his cramped New York apartment, took a toke on the marijuana in his pipe and showed me how he harmonized the Jimi Hendrix song “Up From the Skies.”\n\n“It’s got a certain spice to it, right? Because the notes are close,” he said.\n\nEvans said he never made a cent off any of his records — but he was cool with that. “I started out as an arranger,” he said. “If I’d known at the time it was such a loser’s game, I wouldn’t have done it, because the arranger doesn’t get any royalties. But I had so much fun doing it, I never even thought of that at the time.”\n\nEvans said there was no use complaining about the past; he was only interested in what was happening now. He died at the age of 75 in 1988.

They were active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1991 to 1995.\n\nTheir first single, “Sultans of Swing”, from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by hit singles including “Romeo and Juliet” (1981), “Private Investigations” (1982), “Twisting by the Pool” (1983), “Money for Nothing” (1985), and “Walk of Life” (1985). Their most commercially successful album, Brothers in Arms (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies; it was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc and is the eighth-bestselling album in UK history. According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK albums chart, the fifth most of all time.\n\nDire Straits’ sound draws from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who lasted from the beginning of the band’s existence to the end. After their first breakup in 1988, Knopfler told Rolling Stone: “A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There’s not an accent then on the music, there’s an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.” They disbanded for good in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has since declined reunion offers.\n\nDire Straits were called “the biggest British rock band of the 80s” by Classic Rock magazine; their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold over 120 million units worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists.\n\nDire Straits is the debut studio album by the British rock band Dire Straits released on 9 June 1978 by Vertigo Records, internationally, Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Mercury Records in Canada. The album has the hit single “Sultans of Swing”, which reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. The album reached the top of the album charts in Germany, Australia and France, number 2 in the United States and number 5 in the United Kingdom. Dire Straits was later certified double platinum in both the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nDire Straits was recorded at Basing Street Studios in London from 13 February to 5 March 1978. Knopfler used a few guitars for the recording, including a pair of red Fender Stratocasters—one from 1961 (serial number 68354) and one from 1962 (serial number 80470). He played his 1938 National Style O 14 fret guitar (serial number B1844) on “Water of Love” and “Wild West End”. He also used a black Telecaster Thinline (serial number 226254) on “Setting Me Up”. David played a black Fender Stratocaster and a Harmony Sovereign acoustic guitar. The album was produced by Muff Winwood, and engineered by Rhett Davies,assisted by Greg Cobb\n\nThe album was released in the US on 20 October 1978. The first single released was “Sultans of Swing” which first broke into the United States top five early in the spring of 1979, becoming a hit a full five months after the album was released there, and then reached number eight in the UK Singles Chart. “Water of Love” was also released as a single in some countries, and charted in Australia, reaching number 54, and in the Netherlands, reaching number 28.\n\n“Sultans of Swing” was re-released as a single in the UK in November 1988 to promote the greatest hits compilation Money for Nothing, released in October that year.[8]\n\nThe album was remastered and reissued with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 to most of the world excluding the U.S. and on 19 September 2000 in the United States.[9]\n\nArtwork\n\nThe album cover artwork is designed by Hothouse, who commissioned the cover painting from Chuck Loyola. The Dire Straits Fender logo, which appears on the back cover, was designed by Geoff Halpern.\n\nDire Straits promoted the release of their first single and album with the Dire Straits Tour, which started on 6 June 1978 at the Lafayette Club in Wolverhampton, included 55 shows, ending on 18 November 1978 at the College of Education in Hitchin. The European tour included concerts in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. These concerts presented Dire Straits with their largest audiences to that date. The first leg of the tour promoted their first single, “Sultans of Swing”. This first leg took the band around Great Britain in June and July 1978, performing in England, Scotland and Wales. The band typically performed in small halls with a maximum capacity of 1,000. The second leg of the tour promoted the band’s debut album. This leg took the band to several European countries, where they met journalists and performed on television programmes.\n\nIn his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Ken Tucker wrote that the band “plays tight, spare mixtures of rock, folk and country music with a serene spirit and witty irony. It’s almost as if they were aware that their forte has nothing to do with what’s currently happening in the industry, but couldn’t care less.” Tucker singled out “Sultans of Swing” for its “inescapable hook” and “Bob Dylan-like snarl in its vocal”. He also praised “Setting Me Up” as a “heavenly number, funny and bitter”\n\nDire Straits’ minimalist interpretation of pub rock had already crystallized by the time they released their eponymous debut. Driven by Mark Knopfler’s spare, tasteful guitar lines and his husky warbling, the album is a set of bluesy rockers. And while the bar band mentality of pub-rock is at the core of Dire Straits — even the group’s breakthrough single, “Sultans of Swing,” offered a lament for a neglected pub rock band — their music is already beyond the simple boogies and shuffles of their forefathers, occasionally dipping into jazz and country. Knopfler also shows an inclination toward Dylanesque imagery, which enhances the smoky, low-key atmosphere of the album. While a few of the songs fall flat, the album is remarkably accomplished for a debut, and Dire Straits had difficulty surpassing it throughout their career.

As a musician he achieved artistic and commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s, and was called “the greatest and only Dutch rock ‘n’ roll star”. Later in life he started a successful career as a painter.\n\nKnown for his hedonistic lifestyle of “sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll”, Brood was an enfant terrible and a cultural figure whose suicide by jumping from a hotel roof, apparently influenced by a failure to kick his drug and alcohol habit, strengthened his controversial status; according to a poll organised to celebrate fifty years of Dutch popular music, it was the most significant event in its history.\n\nHerman Brood was born in Zwolle, and started playing the piano at age 12. He founded beat band The Moans in 1964, which would later become Long Tall Ernie and the Shakers. Brood was asked to play with Cuby and the Blizzards, but was removed by management when the record company discovered he used drugs. For a number of years Brood was in jail (for dealing LSD), or abroad, and had a number of short-term engagements (with The Studs, the Flash & Dance Band, Vitesse).\n\nIn 1976, Brood started his own group, Herman Brood & His Wild Romance (and started work with photographer Anton Corbijn),[5] initially with Ferdi Karmelk (guitar), Gerrit Veen (bass), Peter Walrecht (drums), and Ellen Piebes and Ria Ruiters (vocals). They played the club and bar circuit, first in Groningen (the northeasternmost province of the Netherlands). In 1977 the band released their first album, Street.\n\nThe band played all over the Netherlands, playing as many gigs as possible. And Herman’s drug habit became public: In 1977 for instance the Wild Romance played a gig in a high school in Almelo, the Christelijk Lyceum; during the break Brood was caught on the toilet taking heroin or speed (there are different reports on the type of drug, but it is a well-known story amongst former students), the rest of the concert was cancelled, and this also was the last time a rock concert took place at this school for many years.[citation needed]\n\nMurals by Brood on a parking garage in Leidschendam\n\nThey are still best known for their second album, Shpritsz—a play on the German word Spritze for syringe—from 1978. This album contained Brood anthems like “Dope Sucks,” “Rock & Roll Junkie,” and their first Dutch hit single, “Saturday Night.” The band went through many personnel changes over the years; the best-known formation was Freddy Cavalli (bass), Dany Lademacher (guitar) (later replaced with David Hollestelle), and Cees ‘Ani’ Meerman (drums). A frequent contributor was Bertus Borgers (saxophone).\n\nBrood’s outspoken statements in the press about sex and drug use brought him into the Dutch public arena even more than his music. He was romantically involved with the German singer Nina Hagen, with whom he appeared in the 1979 film Cha-Cha. He is reputed to be the subject of her song “Herrmann Hiess Er” (English title “Herrmann Was His Name”) from the 1979 Unbehagen album, a song about a drug addict. Brood relished the media attention and became the most famous hard drug user in the Netherlands. “It is quite common for an artist to use drugs, but not for him to tell everybody. I admit that it scared me that my popularity could make people start using drugs,” he once said in an interview.\n\nIn the summer of 1979, Brood tried to enter the American market, with support from Ariola’s US division, which was attempting to expand into rock music. Following on the success of Shpritsz, the band was booked as a support act for The Kinks and The Cars, playing in auditoriums; “Herman Brood and His Wild Romance Tour Cha Cha ’79” headlined in New York’s (Bottom Line) and Los Angeles’ (Roxy).[8] A re-recorded version of “Saturday Night” peaked at number 35 in the Billboard Hot 100,[9] but the big break Brood hoped for didn’t happen.[10] When he returned to the Netherlands in October 1979, his band had begun to fall apart, and soon his popularity went downhill.[4] Go Nutz, the album Brood had recorded while in the States, and the movie Cha-Cha, which finally premiered in December 1979, were considered artistic failures, even though Go Nutz produced three charting singles in the Netherlands and the Cha Cha soundtrack attained platinum status. The 1980 album Wait a Minute… was a minor success, but the follow-up albums Modern Times Revive (1981) and Frisz & Sympatisz (1982) failed to make the Dutch album charts.\n\nBrood continued to record throughout the 1980s and had a few hits—a top-10 single, “Als Je Wint” with Henny Vrienten, and a minor hit with a reggae song, “Tattoo Song,” but he spent more and more time on his art work. At the end of the ’80s he made a comeback of sorts; Yada Yada (1988), produced by George Kooymans, was well-received, and he toured Germany with a renewed Wild Romance (which saw the return of Dany Lademacher). In 1990, he won the BV Popprijs, one of the highest Dutch awards for popular music, and recorded Freeze with Clarence Clemons of the E Street Band and Tejano accordion player Flaco Jiménez. A live “best of” album, Saturday Night Live, appeared in 1992. His 50th birthday, in 1996, was celebrated with a show at the Paradiso music and cultural center in Amsterdam, and the album (of duets) was released the same year.\n\nSelf portrait:\n\nAfter his career in music, Brood turned to painting and became a well-known character in Amsterdam art circles. His art is best described as pop-art, often very colorful and graffiti-inspired screen prints, and he achieved some commercial success and notoriety by, for instance, creating murals in various public spaces in and around Amsterdam.[12] He continued to remain in the public eye, by appearing in the media and by his cooperation with biographical films such as 1994’s Rock’n Roll Junkie.\n\nToward the end of his life, Brood vowed to abstain from most drugs, reducing his drug use to alcohol and a daily shot of speed (“2 grams per day”[13]). On 11 July 2001, depressed by the failure of his drug rehabilitation program and facing serious medical problems because of his prolonged drug use, he committed suicide by jumping from the roof of the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel at the age of 54. He left a note, stating “Party on. I’ll be seeing you.”\n\nExtensively covered by the national media, his cremation took place five days later. Before the cremation, Brood’s casket was driven from the Hilton hotel to Paradiso, Amsterdam, the streets lined with thousands of spectators. A commemorative concert was held in Paradiso, with performances by Hans Dulfer, André Hazes, and Jules Deelder, and the leading Dutch music magazine Muziekkrant OOR devoted an entire issue to him. His ashes were inurned at Zorgvlied cemetery.\n\nSoon after his suicide, Brood’s version of “My Way” spent three weeks as number one in the Dutch singles charts; the market value of his art work also increased greatly. A characteristic note is that Brood’s paintings had often been targeted by vandals during his life,[20] but after his death they were stolen for their value. His popularity (or notoriety) was confirmed by the fact that his name turned out to be the strongest brand of the year.\n\nWhen U2 performed in the Netherlands three weeks after Brood’s suicide, they paid tribute to him at each of the three shows. They dedicated a version of “Stuck in a Moment You Can’t Get Out Of” (written for Michael Hutchence after his death) to him, with Bono singing Brood’s “When I Get Home” as an a capella intro.\n\nAt the third show in Arnhem they also dedicated their own “Gone” to him and had his version of “My Way” played over the PA as outro music. In the middle of the show Bono delivered an emotional eulogy to Brood before the band performed “In a Little While”.[citation needed]\n\nOn 5 November 2006 the Groninger Museum opened an exposition devoted to Herman Brood’s life and work, comprising paintings, lyrics, and poetry, portraits by photographer Anton Corbijn, a collection of private pictures (from the family album), and concert photos and videos. The exhibition continued until 28 January. It was centered on Herman’s atelier (studio) where he created most of his paintings. The atelier had been entirely re-built in the museum. During the 1990s, Herman Brood’s studio was located on the second floor of the gallery in the Spuistraat in Amsterdam and has remained untouched since his death.\n\nIn 2007 the film Wild Romance, a movie about Brood’s life, premiered in the Netherlands, with Brood portrayed by Daniël Boissevain. He continues to inspire other artists: the 2007 album Bluefinger by Black Francis is based on Brood’s life and works. A tribute band called the Brood Roosters (“bread toasters”) was active in the Netherlands until they split up in early 2009. Another tribute band called Yada Yada is still active in the Netherlands, often appearing with original members of the Wild Romance (Dany Lademacher, Ramon Rambeaux).\n\nIn 2010 the Catastrophic Theatre Company collaborated with Frank Black on a rock opera based on the Bluefinger album. The opera’s first performance, with Matt Kelly portraying Brood, was on 12 November 2010 in Houston, Texas. (wikipedia)\n\nCha Cha is the first live album by Dutch rock and roll and blues group Herman Brood & His Wild Romance. The album produced one single, “Still Believe.” On the Dutch album chart, the album reached #2 on 13 January 1979, and stayed on the chart for 18 weeks.[1] The album was certified gold in 1979.\n\nCha Cha is also the name of a movie filmed in 1979 with Herman Brood, Nina Hagen, and Lene Lovich, whose soundtrack was released separately on LP, also called Cha Cha. In the movie, he marries Nina Hagen; in reality they had a brief affair.\n\nCha Cha was re-released on CD in 1991 by Sony BMG/Ariola. (wikipedia)\n\n‘Cha Cha’ is Herman Brood’s third album with ‘His Wild Romance’. They already toured throughout Western Europe successfully for a couple of years and Herman Brood with his sex & drugs & rock ‘n roll lifestyle build up a reputation as a notorious rock ‘n roll junkie. In 1978 Herman Brood recorded an album LIVE in the studio in front of a small selected audience with ‘His Wild Romance’.\n\nWhat Cha Cha demonstrates is that Brood and Wild Romance were able to capture and build on the excitement of some of the songs on their first two records live. On ‘Street’ and ‘Sphritz’ there are a number of unparalleled Dutch rock and roll classics. Enormously uptempo, full of thrills and excitement. Rock And Roll Junkie’, ‘Hit’, ‘Dope Sucks’, to name but three, are a huge blast from this record. With Bertus Borgers on board, ‘Still Believe’, one of Brood’s hit singles, but co-written by Borgers, also comes to life. The three backing vocalists, José van Iersel of Gruppo Sportivo, Floor van Zutphen and Monica Tjen A Kwoei, do complete the sensation.\n\nMost striking is actually the absence of Brood’s best-known song ‘Saturday Night’. The band also serves up a number of covers, Little Richard and Lou Reed’s ‘Can’t Stand It Anymore’. Especially the latter fits so well in Brood’s repertoire that I almost get the idea that this song has been the model for Brood’s solo career.

This band, rightfully listed in the eclectic progressive genre, mainly plays a hybrid of symphonic prog, space/atmospheric prog and fusion.\n\nThe band originated from the early seventies, with their initial name being SILESIAN BLUES BAND. The band was formed by composer, keyboardist, bass-player and extravert vocalist Józef SKRZEK. Young, but skill-full guitar-player Antymos APOSTOLIS added his great solo’s and drummer extraordinaire Jerzy PIOTROWSKi freely experimented with his recognizable fast fills and break-up rhythms.\n\nIn the end of ’71, after a year full of gigs, the band started a fruitful cooperation with one of Polish most important musicians and song-writers: Czes³aw NIEMEN. ((by friso/progarchives)\n\nMore informations about SBB: here.\n\nAnd here´s their 8th album:\n\nThis is a great album… it consists in two very long tracks, but beautifully made. almost instrumental, it has a very fluid but complex sound, with lots of different combinations of keyboard sounds and atmospheres, tpically from the seventies, always changing and each time bringing new delightfull harmonies. Sometimes, there are some calm vocal parts from Skzrek, in polish, adding a dreamy atmosphere to the music. The guitar in this album is rare, at least as a lead instrument, but when Apostolis plays, he can grab all the attentions to his notes, which proves that is a discreet but a top notch guitar player. This is an essencial album, highly recommended, with a sound totally different from other bands, including polish bands. Excelent!

(by Melos)\n\nI started listening to this album lying in my bed because i couldn’t sleep so I took my headphones and started rolling it. My first impression was really good (two 20-minute epics is not bad) and was very pleasent in that precise moment, due to the quiet character of the first part of Going Away. I kept listening to every detail in the beginning of the song. There are lots of things going on, lots of sounds, nice sounds, very calming. The voice is espectacular too, I’ve no complains about Józef Skrzek’s way of singing. When 3th Reanimation started I was completly blown away, after being so calmed with Freedom with us, the entrance to 3th Reanimation is like a slap of the face, but then you get to realize the idea and you can enjoy the song. The rest is (not technically) very much like Freedom with us, but just a little bit harder. Then comes the tipical end of an epic song, for about 4 minutes which is calles Mountain Mellody. WHAT AN ENDING!. Speaking of song’s endings i’ts nothing compared with As sure as eggs is eggs or It, but is a great ending though.\n\nAfter getting out of that psychedelic, technic and jazzy voyage I got into another one, but this time was different. Even when the structure of both of the songs in the album are very simila, they both have a distinctive mark that makes them different, i mean, imagine that each song is a picture on an exhibition; now, they both have the same height and width, in the same figure painted, but in diferent colours. Now, I don’t want to give more clues to the readers. This album is a MUST HAVE. I’ve no doubt that you wont be dissapointed with it, i’ts a remarcable sample of what this polish guys have to offer, along with Memento Z Banalnym Tryptykiem but in my opinion this is far much noble and better. and for the people who likes it, ¿why isn’t among the 50 top albums?

The band was founded by bass guitarist John Wetton and drummer Bill Bruford, formerly the rhythm section of King Crimson. The band was rounded out by violinist/keyboardist Eddie Jobson, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth. Bruford and Holdsworth left in 1978, and Bruford was replaced by drummer Terry Bozzio. Jobson, Wetton and Bozzio reformed U.K. for a world tour in 2012.\n\nJohn Wetton (formerly of Family, Uriah Heep and Roxy Music) and Bill Bruford (formerly of Yes) had worked together in King Crimson from 1972 to 1974, when guitarist Robert Fripp disbanded the group. In July of 1976, Bruford assisted Wetton on demos originally proposed for a Wetton solo album (two of these demos were later released on the compilation Monkey Business in 1998). In September of 1976, they formed a band with keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who had previously worked with Bruford in Yes. The project was stopped after rehearsals by Wakeman’s label. According to Bruford, “A&M Records were unwilling to let their ‘star’, Wakeman, walk off with a used, slightly soiled King Crimson rhythm section, and the idea failed”.\n\nBruford and Wetton next approached Robert Fripp to reform King Crimson. When Fripp eventually declined, Bruford and Wetton decided that each would choose a musician in order to form a new band. Wetton brought in Eddie Jobson (formerly of Curved Air, Roxy Music and Frank Zappa’s band), whom he had met during his brief time as touring bassist with Roxy Music, thus “stealing” him from Zappa. Bruford recruited Allan Holdsworth (formerly of Soft Machine, Gong, Tempest and The Tony Williams Lifetime) who had played on Bruford’s debut solo album, Feels Good to Me (1978).\n\nThe band’s formation coincided with the introduction of the Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer, and this instrument became an integral part of their developing sound.\n\nU.K. released their self-titled debut album in 1978 and followed it with a supporting tour. Following two lengthy American tours (June to October of 1978), Wetton and Jobson decided to fire Holdsworth over musical differences, and since Bruford had indicated to Wetton that he would favour Holdsworth’s more improvisational approach in the event of a disagreement on the direction of the band, they lined up Terry Bozzio (another one-time Frank Zappa band member) to replace Bruford. Bruford took several instrumentals with him that he had developed for the live U.K. repertoire (“Forever Until Sunday”, “Sahara of Snow”), that he instead recorded with his solo band Bruford on his second album One of a Kind (1979).\n\nU.K. attempted unsuccessfully to find another guitarist before resolving to continue as a trio. They recorded the studio album Danger Money, released in March 1979, and spent much of that year touring North America as opening act for Jethro Tull. The album spawned a minor hit single, “Nothing to Lose”, which reached number 67 on the UK charts. A live album, Night After Night, was recorded in Japan that spring and released in September 1979. Following a final European tour in December 1979, and in spite of plans to record a new studio album in America in March 1980, U.K. disbanded as Jobson and Wetton had different ideas on how the band should develop. Jobson wanted UK to go on with more long instrumental pieces, while Wetton thought that performing shorter, more commercial songs was a better idea. Jobson stated that one particularly pop-oriented song contributed to the band dissolving: “When Will You Realize”, a non-LP B-side featured on the “Night After Night” single, which Wetton would re-record (with slightly different lyrics) in 1980 on his solo album Caught in the Crossfire.\n\nJobson worked with Jethro Tull on the album A (1980) and went on to a solo career. Wetton, following the recording of his solo album Caught in the Crossfire (summer 1980) and a brief stint with Wishbone Ash (October–December 1980), eventually left E.G. Records to sign with Geffen Records and ex-Yes manager Brian Lane and started Asia with Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and Geoffrey Downes. Bozzio formed Missing Persons with his then-wife Dale Bozzio, guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, bassist Patrick O’Hearn and Chuck Wild on keyboards– the first four also from line-ups with Zappa. Holdsworth and Bozzio played together in HoBoLeMa almost three decades later. John Wetton and Allan Holdsworth both died in 2017.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Jobson and Wetton worked together on a proposed U.K. reunion album, also recording contributions by Bruford, Tony Levin, Steve Hackett and Francis Dunnery. When Wetton departed, “Legacy” became an Eddie Jobson solo project, with Wetton replaced on vocals by Aaron Lippert. However, Jobson eventually abandoned this project. Three tracks intended for it were included on Voices of Life, a compilation by Bulgarian Women’s Choir organised by Jobson.\n\nIn October 2007, Jobson announced a new band, UKZ, with Lippert and former King Crimson bassist/guitarist Trey Gunn among others, which released an EP called “Radiation” in March 2009. In late 2009, Jobson and Wetton both talked about a possible reunion of U.K. A reunion tour in February/March 2010 with Jobson, Wetton, Marco Minnemann on drums (from UKZ) and Greg Howe (Victor Wooten, Vitalij Kuprij, Michael Jackson) on guitar was described to promoters, but would not happen until 2011.\n\nWetton and Jobson performed three concerts in Poland in November 2009 as part of Jobson’s Ultimate Zero (U-Z) project. The line-up also featured Minnemann, Howe, and Tony Levin (stick). They performed music from UK and King Crimson. A CD compiled from various U-Z performances from 2009, entitled Ultimate Zero Tour – Live, including multiple tracks from the Polish shows, was then released.\n\nIt was announced on 11 February 2011, and later confirmed by John Wetton on his website, that U.K. had reformed to play two shows in Japan on 15 and 16 April 2011. The line-up was Jobson and Wetton, with Minnemann and Alex Machacek performing drums and guitar respectively. US dates, including a show in San Francisco, were also announced and performed in April 2011. A DVD called “Reunion: Live in Tokyo” was culled from these shows and officially released in 2013.\n\nFormer drummer Bozzio then rejoined for an American tour in 2012. The line-up for the subsequent European tour included additional musicians Gary Husband (drums) and a returning Alex Machacek on guitar.\n\nIn 2013, U.K. did an “Azure Seas” tour with Machacek once again taking on guitar duties, and an East Coast tour with Virgil Donati performing drumming duties in place of Bozzio, who had once again departed the band. On 8 November of the same year, the band did also a special concert performance of their two studio albums in Kawasaki, in Japan. The drummer for that special concert was Marco Minnemann.\n\nU.K. appeared in the 2014 edition of Cruise to the Edge progressive rock festival. The line-up once again included both Machacek and Donati. In 2015 the band announced their final world tour, with the band being joined by Donati and Machacek. Donati was then replaced by Dream Theater drummer Mike Mangini for the final dates in the USA and Japan.\n\nThroughout their brief existence, U.K.’s music was characterised by skilled musicianship, jazzy harmonies, close harmony vocals, mixed meters, electric violin solos, and unusually varied synthesiser (Yamaha CS-80) sonorities. Relative to specific styles, the band spans various genres ranging from progressive rock to jazz fusion.\n\nU.K. is the debut album by the progressive rock supergroup U.K., released in May 1978 through E.G. Records and Polydor Records. It features John Wetton, Eddie Jobson, Bill Bruford, and Allan Holdsworth. “In the Dead of Night” and “Mental Medication” were both edited for single release. The album was well received by FM album rock radio and by the public during the summer of 1978. The LP sold just over 250,000 copies by 1 September 1978, with further sales through the rest of the year. The album was remastered in 2016 and included as part of the box-set “Ultimate Collector’s Edition”.\n\n“Alaska” was written by Eddie Jobson for the Yamaha CS-80.[6] The first three tracks belong to a suite entitled “In the Dead of Night”, which began as a chord sequence by Jobson, to which Wetton added the melody and lyrics.[6] Early versions of “In the Dead of Night” and “Thirty Years” were written before the formation of the band.[7]\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 2015, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it as the 30th best progressive rock album of all time.\n\nIn an interview with the TeamRock site in 2016, Ty Tabor of King’s X selected the album as his top pick in a “5 Essential Guitar Albums” list, stating, “I had never heard anybody think about playing guitar the way that [Holdsworth] plays on that record.” (wikipedia)\n\nThe debut album from amalgamated progsters John Wetton, Bill Bruford, Eddie Jobson, and Allan Holdsworth has the edge over both Danger Money and Night After Night because of the synthesis of melody and rhythm that is inflicted through nearly every one of the eight tracks. While not as commercial sounding as Wetton’s 1980s supergroup Asia, U.K. mustered up a progressive air by the use of intelligent keyboard and percussion interplay without sounding mainstream. Jobson’s work with the electric violin and assorted synthesizers adds to an already profound astuteness carried by Wetton. Former Yes and Genesis drummer Bill Bruford is just as important behind the kit, making his presence felt on numbers like “Thirty Years” and “Nevermore.” Without carrying the same rhythms or cadences through each song, U.K. implements some differentiation into their music, straying from the sometimes over-the-top musicianship that occurs with the gathering of such an elite bunch. The melodious finish of such tracks as “By the Light of Day” and “Alaska” showcases the overall fluency of each member, and shows no signs of any progressive tediousness that could have easily evolved. All three of U.K.’s albums are enjoyable, but the debut sports the most interest, since it spotlights their remarkable fit as a band for the first time.

Craig Frost (keyboards) joined the band in 1972. Farner has Cherokee ancestry from his maternal side.\n\nFarner was the guitarist and lead singer for Grand Funk Railroad as well as the songwriter for most of their material. His best-known composition is the 1970 epic “I’m Your Captain (Closer to Home)”. He also wrote the 1975 hit “Bad Time”, the last of the band’s four singles to make the top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAfter Grand Funk initially disbanded in 1976, Farner released his self-titled debut solo album in 1977, and his second, No Frills, in 1978 (both Atlantic Records). In 1981, Farner and Don Brewer launched a new Grand Funk line-up with bassist Dennis Bellinger and recorded two albums, Grand Funk Lives and What’s Funk?[citation needed] Farner went solo again with 1988’s Just Another Injustice on Frontline Records.\n\nHis third Frontline release was 1991’s Some Kind of Wonderful, which featured a revamped Jesus version of the Grand Funk classic of the same name. Farner became a born again Christian in the late 1980s and enjoyed success with the John Beland composition “Isn’t it Amazing”, which earned him a Dove Award nomination and reached No. 2 on the Contemporary Christian music charts.\n\nIn the 1990s, Farner formed Lismark Communications with former Freedom Reader editor Steve Lisuk. Soon after, Farner began reissuing his solo albums on his own record label, LisMark Records.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1995, Farner toured with Ringo Starr’s Allstars, which also featured Randy Bachman, John Entwistle, Felix Cavaliere, Billy Preston, and Starr’s son, Zak Starkey.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Farner reunited with Grand Funk, but left after three years to resume his solo career. He currently tours with his band, Mark Farner’s American Band, which plays a mixture of Grand Funk songs and Farner’s solo offerings.\n\nFarner had a pacemaker installed October 22, 2012, having struggled with heart troubles for the previous eight years.\n\nMark Farner was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 2015. He had previously been inducted as a member of both Grand Funk Railroad and Terry Knight & The Pack.\n\nFarner was honored with the Lakota Sioux Elders Honor Mark in 1999. During the concert in Hankinson, North Dakota, a special presentation was held honoring Mark’s Native ancestry and his contributions. Members of the Lakota Nation presented him with a hand-made ceremonial quilt. He has also been honored with the Cherokee Medal of Honor by the Cherokee Honor Society.\n\nAn authorized biography of Farner, entitled From Grand Funk to Grace, was published in 2001.\n\nThis section appears to contain trivial, minor, or unrelated references to popular culture. Please reorganize this content to explain the subject’s impact on popular culture, providing citations to reliable, secondary sources, rather than simply listing appearances. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2018)\n\nMark Farner is mentioned by Homer Simpson in The Simpsons episode, “Homerpalooza”, in season 7, episode 24 of the series. As Homer drives his children and their friends to school, Grand Funk is on the car radio. The children do not like it and ask him to change the station when he responds, “you kids don’t know Grand Funk? The wild, shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner. The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher. The competent drum work of Don Brewer?”\n\nMark Farner was mentioned in episode 9 of season 8 of the HBO comedy series Curb Your Enthusiasm in September 2011. (wikipedia)\n\nAnd here´s his second solo-album after leaving Grand Funk Railroad:\n\nGrand Funk Railroad’s most potent and primal recordings (such as Closer to Home and their 1970 live album) were cut as a power trio, and even their more polished later work on We’re an American Band and Shinin’ On only added a keyboard player to the mix, so when GFR guitarist and singer Mark Farner went into the studio to cut his second solo album in 1978, the LP’s title summed up the approach: No Frills. Producer Jimmy Iovine set Farner up with a good rhythm section (bassist Dennis Bellinger and drummer Andy Newmark), took them into the studio and rolled tape. What could go wrong? Well, Farner’s songwriting chops weren’t what they once were, and while he could pen a worthy mass of power chords earlier in his career, the mixture of pop, soul, and hard rock that informs most of these tunes lack the clarity and force of his best work.\n\nThe lyrics aren’t especially inspired, either, though “If It Took All Day” is at least funny and “He Sent Me You” anticipates the tone of his later Christian recordings. The lack of musical focus also impacts Farner’s guitar work, which doesn’t approach the full-bodied grit of Grand Funk’s glory days (and who told the guy to go crazy with the flanger, anyway?). Bellinger and Newmark play just fine, but it’s clear they don’t have quite the same empathy for this music as Mel Schacher and Don Brewer, and the engineering is too slick and doesn’t have the muscle to give this the loud and proud punch it needs. No Frills may have been a good philosophy for Mark Farner, but he needed a bit more than that to make an album worthy of his hard rock legacy.
