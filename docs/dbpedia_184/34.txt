Lindsy is described as a helpful little girl, sometimes timid; one of her favourite activities is chatting on the phone. Lotte is said to be open-minded and honest, and she loves animals. Samantha loves dancing and singing.

The three girls met in a dancing school in Eindhoven, where their dancing skills were discovered by a record producer who signed them up for their first single "Hide and Seek" under the Djumbo Project. Their first two singles entered top 5 in their homeland and they succeeded, in less than six months, to become one of the most popular pop groups there.

Their sound is quite similar to K3, who are based in Belgium. Both have the fun bouncy 'childish' style that makes it popular amongst childrenâ€”happy pop music for children.

The lyrics of most Djumbo songs are written in a combination of English and Dutch, with the majority of a song being in Dutch and the chorus (and title) being in English.
