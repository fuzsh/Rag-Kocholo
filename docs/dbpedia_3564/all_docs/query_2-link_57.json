        "text": "Ferry from the port island of La Maddalena - Ph. eli77/iStock\n\nSardinia is one of the most fascinating lands in Italy and beyond; it is a mix of tradition and innovation, as if the island had been divided in two: one side full of unbridled luxury and entertainment belonging to the Costa Smeralda, and on the other a strong attachment to the past and tradition now largely rooted in the Sardinian people and their land. It is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean and boasts coastlines stretching some 2,000 kilometers, giving rise to spectacular scenery between sea and rocks that is truly unique.\n\nSardinia ferries are daily and departures take place from most Italian ports, so that it is a perfectly accessible destination at all times of the year. In fact, although Sardinia is ideal for a visit in the summer or at any rate in the warmer seasons, in order to take a dip in its splendid waters and to visit its very special beaches, it can be visited all year round because of the beauty it has to offer. In Sardinia there are many small villages where time seems to have stopped, which really deserve to be visited at least once in a lifetime. In this article we will tell you about the 4 villages that are absolutely not to be missed if you plan to spend a vacation on the island, perhaps taking advantage of the many bridges that 2023 will give us.\n\nFrom the Port of Cagliari - Ph. RomanBabakin/iStock\n\nVillages not to be missed\n\nWe begin in the north of Sardinia with Santa Teresa di Gallura located on what are called the Straits of Bonifacio, a strait that acts as a separator between Corsica and Sardinia. In ancient times its name was Longosardo and this is also where the name of its most important monument, which is the Tower of the same name, comes from.Nearby you can admire splendid Nuraghe archaeological sites.\n\nSpiaggia Rena Bianca - Ph. Daniele Macis/iStock\n\nThe colorful little town of Bosa, the center of Planargia, which dates back as far as the Phoenicians, is really worth a visit. For centuries it was dominated by different factions, so much so that it is a town of many facets and styles. It has a very long history and many monuments, among the most important: the Church of Our Lady of Sos Regnos Altos, dating from the time of Spanish rule, the Catalan church of Sant'Antonio Abate, the Ponte Vecchio of Savoy origin, and the church of San Pietro.\n\nPh. Jürgen Scheeff/Unsplash\n\nNestled in the center of Ogliastra is a village of medieval origin, clinging to a mountain: Ulassai. The surrounding areas are sprinkled with archaeological sites where you can admire the famous Nuraghi, the village has numerous sites of historical interest within it, such as the medieval town hall, to the church of San Sebastiano or the Byzantine complex dedicated to Santa Barbara.\n\nNuraghe ad Ulassai - Ph. Jürgen Scheeff/Unsplash\n\nFinally, not to be missed is Castelsardo, whose foundation dates back to around 1100. The village is perched on a promontory from which on clear days you can admire wonderful sunsets. This is the one overlooking the most famous Gulf of Asinara, and towering above it is the Doria Castle, whose towers and walls are still visible today. Also worth visiting is the co-cathedral of Sant'Antonio Abate, the medieval civic palace, and finally, near it is also the Elephant Rock, a massif so called because of its peculiar shape, where inside are two Domus de Janas."
