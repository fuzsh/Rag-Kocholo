        "text": "Olbia, an important Sardinian tourist city\n\nOlbia, vintage image of the famous tourist resort of the Costa Smeralda\n\nThis beautiful city of Sardinia, is located in the province of Sassari, and is a very tourist city known and coveted by millions of tourists from all over the world. It is the ideal destination for those who love the sea and are looking for cultural tourism. Olbia is mystical and sunny.\n\nThe first testimonies of human presence on the island date back to the Neolithic Age and dates back to the Bronze Age the tomb of the giants on Monte de s'Ape. In Roman times, 238 BC, Olbia was an important shopping center and its port was a strategic military naval base; it is believed to have more than 5000 inhabitants. Don't forget to visit the historic center of the city, full of charm and architectural beauty. In 1999, new finds were found to testify to Roman life (pieces of ancient ships were found) and medieval.\n\nThe city is developing rapidly in the industrial, commercial and economic sectors, having tourism as its main engine.\n\nOlbia is a city where many events and shows take place and with a very rich gastronomic culture; you can find a large number of clubs there where to eat or make a stop. You must definitely visit Olbia and you will have an unforgettable holiday!\n\nscritto da Mark Dutton - ultima modifica il 01/11/2021\n\nCosta Smeralda: beautiful town and beaches of Sardinia\n\nThe jet-set strip of Sardinia, Costa Smeralda is a six-mile (10km) stretch of coastline between the gulfs of Cugnana and Arzachena on the island's northeast coast, which has become a developer's paradise and extremely popular with holidaymakers.\n\nLegend has it that a fabulously wealthy consortium of businessmen first exploited this beautiful wild coastal strip in the 1960s, backed by the Aga Khan. Today the local villages and towns around Costa Smeralda have become discreet up-market resorts crammed with private villas, luxurious holiday villages, contrived Mediterranean-style shopping malls, low-rise high-priced hotels and huge yachting marinas packed with gleaming yachts.\n\nThe main town of the area is Porto Cervo, a crime and litter-free playground of the rich with its ranks of pale pink and red villas climbing the hill from the busy marna. The other favourite retreat for celebrities is the town of Porto Rotondo, situated on a natural cove about 10 miles (16km) from Olbia, site of the international airport. The town offers a wealth of beaches, nightclubs, bars and restaurants, most clustered around its Piazza San Marco, and the marina.\n\nThe main attractions of the Costa Smeralda are the numerous sequestered beaches, none signposted, which can be discovered simply by following a dirt track down towards the sea. Among the most scenic are Cappriccioli, Rena Bianca and Liscia Ruja, all south of Porto Cervo.\n\nscritto da Chiara Guzzetti - ultima modifica il 05/08/2019\n\nThe Coast is Emerald!\n\nPorto Cervo\n\nOn Sardinia's north-eastern coast, Costa Smeralda offers breathtaking views, crystal-clear water, great food and night-life. Take a walk along Porto Cervo's streets,shop in fancy boutiques or just sunbathe on one of the beautiful beaches.\n\nCosta Smeralda is located on the north-eastern coast of Sardinia, in the Gallura area. It basically follows the panoramic road from Cugnana to Baia Sardinia. The coast morphology is called \"a rias\" and offers endless coves, headlands, inlets, islands and cliffs. Although great efforts have been made to increase tourism, this area is still ascinating and charming, due to the fact that its natural beauty has not been destroyed. Costa Smeralda is famous for its pure emerald green sea, its granite rocks shaped by the wind and sea over the millennia, its wonderful small beaches and luxuriant Mediterranean vegetation.\n\nscritto da Chiara Guzzetti - ultima modifica il 17/08/2019\n\n10 things not to miss on the Emerald Coast\n\n1. The \"Roccia dell'Orso\" (Bear Rock) - Palau mentioned by Tolomeo, it is large granite natural monument, shaped like a bear looking towards the sea. 2. Agriturismi - Farms Stazzi are today used as agriturismo and are ideal for those who love nature, traditions and good food. 3. \"Sas Tiliccas\" Typical Logudoro and Gallura sweets. They consist of a flour pastry, kneaded with lard, with a sinuous shape, filled with honey, almonds, nuts and sapa. They were once prepared on important occasions.\n\n4. \"Sa suppa cuatta\" Typical Gallura soup: it is made with bran-bread soaked in sheep broth, covered with fresh pecorino cheese and tomato sauce, all cooked in the oven. 5.
