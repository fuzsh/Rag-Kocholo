Municipality in the province of Olbia-Tempio, located in Gallura region, on a hill surrounded by woods, not far from the Costa Smeralda, the territories of Sant'Antonio di Gallura border with those of Olbia. The local economy is mainly devoted to agriculture, livestock breeding and production of corks.

In the Middle Ages, at the foot of Lu Naracu, arose a village called Villa de Castro, which became part of the Parish of Unali and was abandoned in the second half of the XIV century. At the end of the XVIII, a church dedicated to St. Andrew was built, which was sold by its owners to the local pastors who agreed to maintain and preserve it in good condition. During the early years of the XX century, in the area established a Parish dedicated to Saint Anthony Abbot and only a few years later, a new church was built. Around this developed the present town, known as Sant'Antonio di Gallura. Gradually it became very popular thanks to the fact that the inhabitants of surrounding areas decided to move here. Only in 1979 it was granted with a certain autonomy and was divided from the nearby town of Calangianus.
