        "text": "ONE serious question—one only—troubles the critical mind in connection with the presentation of \"Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy,\" a compilation of scenes from Mr. Lloyd's old pictures, which opened yesterday at the Beekman and the Embassy. That question is, Who is likely to be more delighted and amazed by this highly felicitious opportunity to sample the works of Mr. Lloyd—the oldsters who dimly remember him from thirty to forty years ago or the youngsters who have never seen him and will be meeting him here for the first time?For the thing about which there is no question is the evidence served up that Mr. Lloyd was a wonderfully skillful and appealing comedian in the days of his most prolific output of silent and early talking films—a comedian of joyous elasticity and boundless inventiveness. And the quality of his frantic humor has not withered or staled with the years. It is as dazzling today as ever, whether one is seeing him freshly or reminiscently.This is adroitly made apparent by the arrangement of the scenes in this sweeping compilation, which Mr. Lloyd has produced himself. Early along he hits us with no more than teasing little clips from two of his most memorable pictures—a bit of the building-climbing scene and the famous clock-hanging business in his silent \"Safety Last\" and the little bit of \"The Freshman\" in which Harold gets hold of the ball in the football game.Having teased us with those samples—those \"touches\" of action and thrills, as he explains in a slightly florid commentary that bubbles up now and again—Mr. Lloyd proceeds to give us much longer sections from less remembered films. And, by George, they're as lively and funny as we remember \"Safety Last\" or \"The Freshman\" to have been.Indeed, Mr. Lloyd ends this picture (except for a couple of fade-out clips) with the long and intensely energetic building-scaffold scene — the one in which he hangs and falls and catches himself high up on the outside of a building—from \"Feet First,\" a picture he made in 1930, seven years after \"Safety Last.\" And it's as thoroughly thrilling and hilarious as anything we can recall from that later film.So it goes all through this picture, which has the bespectacled Harold, the usually shy, nervous, sometimes timorous but always tenacious \"average guy,\" rushing into and out of all kinds of trouble and taking heroic punishment from all sides.There are beautifully complicated chases, such as the one from \"Girl Shy\" in which Harold goes by automobile, motorcycle, trolley car, horse-and-wagon and afoot to rescue the innocent maiden from marrying a leering bigamist. There's the mad slapstick comedy sequence of escape from a Mexican jail from \"Why Worry?\" and the barely remembered but grandly inventive scene of Harold in the trick coat of the magician from \"Movie Crazy\" (1932).As one views this eclectic compilation, it becomes evident that Mr. Lloyd did incline to repeat his better sight gags and that his character of the \"average guy\" was just a bit shallow and obvious. He did not have the poignancy, the universality of a Charlie Chaplin of the physical grotesquerie of a Buster Keaton. But he had glorious energy and comic verve. This grand selection of his inventions should be a joy and delight in this sad world.\n\nThe ProgramHAROLD LLOYD'S WORLD OF COMEDY; a feature-length compilation of sequences of Harold Lloyd films from 1923 through 1938—\"Safety Last,\" \"The Freshman,\" \"Hot Water,\" \"Why Worry?\" \"Girl Shy,\" \"Professor Beware,\" \"Movie Crazy\" and \"Feet First\"; produced by Mr. Lloyd; narration written by Art Ross and spoken by Mr. Lloyd; released by Continental Distributing, Inc. At the Beekman Theatre, Second Avenue and Sixty-fifth Street, and the Embassy Theatre, Broadway and Forty-sixth Street. Running time: Ninety-four minutes."
