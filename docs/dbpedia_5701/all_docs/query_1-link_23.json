        "text": "Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It’s Monday, March 27. I’m Gustavo Arellano, writing from Orange County. I’m also a columnist, which means I’m allowed to have opinions like:\n\nHarold Lloyd is cool.\n\nThe silent film star was one of the most popular screen comedians in the 1920s, outdrawing even Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. His films almost always had the same plot: a wimpy striver in round horned-rimmed glasses tries to better his lot in life, finds himself in hijinks that lead to outlandish stunts, and gets the girl in the end.\n\nIt was a recipe that made Lloyd one of the richest actors in Hollywood — the famously massive Beverly Hills estate Greenacres was where he and his family lived for decades. But his simple story lines and cherubic face fell out of favor with critics, and Lloyd today doesn’t have the same cachet as Chaplin’s Little Tramp or Keaton’s Great Stone Face.\n\nExcept for one immortal scene.\n\n“If you tell most people, ‘Harold Lloyd,’ they’ll look at you with a blank face,” said his granddaughter, Suzanne Lloyd. She runs Harold Lloyd Entertainment, which manages its namesake’s likeness and films. “You show the photo, they’ll say, ‘I know that guy!’”\n\nThat photo, of course, is the one at the top of this newsletter: Lloyd hanging off the arms of a clock 12 stories up, as a mesmerized crowd watches. It’s one of the most famous images of the silent era, and the climax to “Safety Last!,” which Lloyd filmed across downtown L.A. and released on April 1, 1923, making this week the film’s 100th anniversary.\n\nI didn’t see “Safety Last!” until I took a silent movie class at Orange Coast College in the late 1990s. But the image was already part of my Southern California upbringing — did I see it on a car insurance commercial? Parodied in a Bugs Bunny cartoon? In a compilation that I rented from the Anaheim Public Library? Maybe on a matinee on KCAL-TV Channel 9, back when its programming was more creative than wall-to-wall judge shows and “Family Feud”?\n\nI digress.\n\n“Safety Last!” holds up a century later with good gags and Lloyd’s indefatigable optimism. He plays a small-town boy who ends up poor in the big city, working as a lowly clerk in a department store. His sweetheart (played by his wife, Mildred Davis), who’s staying back home until he has enough money to bring her, surprises Lloyd by showing up one day, fully believing in his letters that he’s a company bigwig. Desperate to make quick cash, Lloyd tells his bosses that he’ll climb their store building for $1,000.\n\nHilarity ensues. Come for the footage of a time when Pacific Electric Red Cars still dominated downtown, stay for the bumbling cop who makes the Keystone lads seem as savvy as Capt. Olivia Benson. It received almost universal praise at the time — Variety wrote, “It will make all of the nation laugh,” while the New York Times stated, “There will be roars of rollicking laughter.” Really, the only major hater was... this paper.\n\n“It is a breathless thrill picture, perfectly made, as [Lloyd’s] pictures always are,” our reviewer wrote, “but lacking the spark of originality he usually [e]ndows his work with.”\n\nSuzanne said her grandfather got the idea one day while walking downtown and seeing Bill Strother — who went by the nickname “The Human Spider” — scale a building. He told Strother the two of them should make a movie together replicating his feat.\n\n“Harold thought, ‘My God, if it could scare me and scare people on the street, I gotta make a film out of this,’” Suzanne said. “He happened to be at the right place at the right time to see him.”\n\nYou can and should buy a DVD off Harold Lloyd Entertainment’s website, because the two-disc collection offers all sorts of goodies. But you should also catch “Safety Last!” this Saturday evening at the Frida Cinema in Santa Ana, where you can see it on the big screen with live music.\n\nSuzanne loves to see new audiences connect with her grandfather, who she argues “goes really well” with modern audiences. “He looks like someone off the street,” she said. “He’d have an iPad and cellphone hanging off of him. He could be your best friend, he could be your cousin.”\n\nShe especially loves to screen Lloyd’s movies at schools across Los Angeles (during the pandemic, she did it via Zoom). “The kids go, ‘He’s like Harry Potter’s older brother.’ Another time, the kids said, ‘Well, we just love how he texts us.’”\n\nSuzanne stayed quiet. I was about to ask if she had misspoken, then she went for the punchline.\n\n“What do you think they think the texts are? It’s the title cards.”\n\nThat Lloyd funny bone, I’m telling ya.\n\nAnd now, here’s what’s happening across California:\n\nNote: Some of the sites we link to may limit the number of stories you can access without subscribing.\n\nL.A.

Former Times restaurant critic and overall food legend Ruth Reichl’s Substack inevitably swings to SoCal, and the latest edition remembers L’Ermitage founding chef Jean Bertranou and sketches out two days of romantic dining (although, Ruth: You left out a late-night run to Tommy’s or King Taco, the true marker of whether someone is The One).
