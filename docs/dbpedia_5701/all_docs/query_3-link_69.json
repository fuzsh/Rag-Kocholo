        "text": "BiographyHarold Lloyd was an American actor, comedian, and stunt performer who appeared in many silent comedy films. One of the most influential film comedians of the silent era, Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and talkies, from 1914 to 1947. His career began with a series of jobs as an extra and a bit part player, until he teamed up with comedy producer Hal Roach. His \"glass character\" was a resourceful, ambitious go-getter who matched the zeitgeist of the 1920s-era United States. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand (the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove). He often experimented with makeup, to disguise his youthful appearance.\n\nPerson TypeIndividual"
