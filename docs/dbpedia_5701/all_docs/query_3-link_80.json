        "text": "HAROLD LLOYD in SPEEDY (1928) 86 minutes\n\nLloyd's last comedy to be released in the silent era was shot on location and is a valentine to New York City. He plays Harold \"Speedy\" Swift, who is baseball-crazy and can't seem to hold a job, but he does find the time to take his girlfriend to Coney Island, drive legendary baseball player Babe Ruth to Yankee Stadium, and save the city's last horse-drawn trolley in a climactic chase, and film, that is the culmination of his silent movie career.\n\nDirected by Ted Wilde\n\nDoors at 5:30PM and screening at 6PM.\n\n*Please note that children under the age of six will not be admitted to the screening."
