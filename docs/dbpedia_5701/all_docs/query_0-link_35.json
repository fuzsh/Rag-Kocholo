        "text": "coisasequimeras:\n\nWayne Miller, 1958\n\nOne of my favorite memories living abroad in Paris was going to the neighborhood cinema to watch Buster Keaton films with live piano accompaniment. When I entered the theater for the first time to see Sherlock Jr., I was shocked to see that over 50% of the audience members were children (at about the age of those in the photo above) and their parents. Maybe I haven’t been to enough Buster Keaton or Chaplin films screened in California to notice the presence of children (if any), but this seemed so interesting to me and a novel idea to start kids on a good film diet with silent comedy.\n\nBefore the screening, the cinema owners came out with goodies to give to the children if they answered some film trivia correctly. I could not stop smiling as a bespectacled boy sitting in front of me between his parents raised his hand shyly at “Who is the funny silent film actor who wears glasses?” He answered, “Harold Lloyd.” The boy accepted his winnings graciously and gave it to his mother to hold in her purse.\n\nHave you ever heard a group of children laugh? It is the most lovely cacophony in the world. I usually don’t laugh too loud in a theater and hardly ever during a silent film where it would stand out against the film’s score. But with the children laughing unabashedly at Buster’s pratfalls and their nervous anticipation whenever a booby trap was set for Buster (the billiards scene!), I couldn’t help it. It was hard not to get caught up in their reactions.\n\nI’ve never felt happier leaving a cinema full of children who saved their candy for later and kept their focus on the screen. I often think of their futures. If that little boy would someday make films and thank his parents for introducing him to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. In all honesty, I can’t think of a better start for a filmmaker."
