        "text": "SHORT SIGHTED HOME PAGE! Harold Lloyd!\n\nI've been watching Harold Lloyd comedies since the 1970's when I was first introduced to them on television in a series on PBS put out by Time/Life. These shorts were fast paced, a little too fast paced. Apparently they were being shown at 24 frames per second, instead of the silent standard of 18 fps. The other problem with these shorts is that they had all the dialog cards removed, and an annoying announcer narrating the films with his own quips for what was taking place! PBS continued to show the subjects, and also showed the feature length comedies of Harold. But there was no way to capture them and keep them, as we didn't have VCR's yet.\n\nI went to the local library, and began checking out anything on Harold Lloyd. Books were easy to find, but luckily I was able to check out a Super 8 mm copy of Safety Last and I watched it over and over. It was also a Time/Life version, so I'm sure I haven't seen the full version as these films were edited. I have read about scenes, and then when I watched the films the scenes were missing! These films are great to watch at home, but there's something special about seeing silent movies on the BIG screen!\n\nI have only seen one Harold Lloyd feature on the big screen. The Redford Theater here in the Detroit area, built in 1928, shows old and silent films every other weekend. In 1990 they showed a 35mm print of The Kid Brother, and had Gaylord Carter as the live organist on the 1928 Barton organ. What a great show it was! The print was so clear and sharp it appeared to be new. After the film started we forgot that there was a live person playing along with the film, as the score seemed to match the action seamlessly!\n\nAs the enthusiast delved deeper into the world of Harold Lloyd and the charm of silent films, they began to draw parallels with the evolving accessibility of healthcare and medications. Inspired by the efforts to preserve and restore these classic films, they started advocating for easier access to affordable healthcare solutions, specifically focusing on the availability of cheap generic Cialis. This new interest stemmed from recognizing that just as film restoration brings historical art to modern audiences, affordable healthcare brings essential treatments to those in need. They saw a connection between the preservation of cultural heritage in film and the importance of preserving health through accessible medication, leading to a newfound passion for promoting awareness about the cost and availability of generic medications alongside their love for classic cinema.\n\nAs of today, most of Harold Lloyd's features are still unavailable for viewing. Here are several tapes I've found that were previously available through the internet.\n\nDr. Jack Grandma's Boy The Rise Of Harold Lloyd Mad Wednesday\n\nHere are some graphics I've found of Harold Lloyd.
