A veteran air marshal receives anonymous text messages mid-flight, telling him that a multimillion dollar ransom must be paid or a passenger on board his plane will die every 20 minutes. Teaming up with a fellow traveller and a plucky flight attendant, he sets out to unmask the killer. However, the chase takes a surprising turn when the lawman becomes the prime suspect."
