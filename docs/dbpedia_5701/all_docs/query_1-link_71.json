        "text": "New Date: Harold Lloyd in Safety Last! – Sunday, October 22nd, 6:00 PM\n\nOur Summer series of monthly screenings under the stars in Glendale’s Brand Park now concludes on a new date: Sunday, October 22nd with a 100th anniversary screening of Harold Lloyd’s silent comedy masterpiece, Safety Last!, featuring live, original music by Retroformat Musical Director Cliff Retallick\n\nIn the film, Harold moves to the big city to seek his fortune so that he can afford to marry his sweetheart. Finding work as a clerk in a department store, Harold soon learns that fortunes are hard to come by, but sends inflated descriptions of his progress back home. Reality sets in as his sweetheart arrives, and he must go to great lengths to create the illusion that he’s as successful as he’s claimed. In the final set piece, he climbs a 12-story building to win $1,000, resulting in the iconic image of Harold hanging from the hand of the clock with the street far below.\n\nVirtual Introduction and Harold Lloyd Home Movies\n\nSuzanne Lloyd, granddaughter of Harold Lloyd, will appear onscreen to introduce the film. In addition, she’ll be providing “home movies” showing Harold relaxing with friends and family.\n\n35mm Silent Movie Camera on Display\n\nThanks to our friends at the History for Hire prop house, we’ll have a Bell & Howell Model 2709 35mm movie camera on display – the same make and model that was used to film Harold Lloyd’s silent comedies through Speedy in 1928.\n\nThese outdoor screenings are being presented on the expansive lawn of the historic Doctors’ House in Brand Park. Admission is free. Gates will open at 4:00 PM to allow time for picnicking and socializing before the program begins at 6:00 PM. Please bring blankets, lawn or beach chairs for seating.\n\nThe series is a presentation of Alex Film Society, Retroformat Silent Films, The Glendale Historical Society, Brand Associates and the Northwest Glendale Homeowners Association, with generous support provided by the City of Glendale’s Community Services & Parks.\n\nDirections to Brand Park and The Doctors’ House\n\nIn Northwest Glendale, follow Grandview Ave. up the hill and into the park. Grandview can be accessed from San Fernando Rd., W. Glenoaks Blvd. and Kenneth Rd. Once in the park, follow the signs to the Doctors’ House or Brand Motorway. Note that vehicular access ends at the red barrier shown on the map below."
