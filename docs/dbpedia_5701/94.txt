Harold Lloyd (1893-1971) is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest silent comedians, considered by many to be even funnier than Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Now film historian John K. Carpenter ("The Movie Man") sheds light on the beginning of "The Boy's" career with this collection of Lloyd's early work. "In my decades of collecting rare 16mm film prints, I discovered Harold Lloyd's creativity first flourished in the one-reel comedies he made for Hal Roach. These 1918 and 1919 rarities show him growing more confident in terms of plot, gag construction and character development. It was because of these films that Path√© started giving him bigger budgets and expanded the length of his shorts from one reel to two reels. Theaters didn't hesitate to book a Lloyd film, because they were guaranteed hits!"
