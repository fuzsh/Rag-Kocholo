At various points in its history, Fraunces Tavern served as a military headquarters for George Washington, a venue for peace negotiations with the British, and a federal office building in the Early Republic. Learn more in the museum upstairs from the pub.\n\n• Browse the stalls at Essex Market, New York City's most historic public market. Essex Market has been a fixture of the Lower East Side since 1818, and the current iteration of the market has been continuously operating for over a century. The vendors at Essex Market sell a variety of goods from fresh cut flowers to groceries to prepared meals.\n\n• Try the pastrami on rye at Katz's Delicatessen, also known as Katz's of New York City. It is located at 205 East Houston Street and has been a popular spot since it first opened in 1888. The pastrami on rye served here is often considered to be the best in the city.\n\n• Sample the food at Russ & Daughters, an appetizing store that dates back to 1914. An appetizing store refers to a store that sells Jewish cuisine in New York City, and includes bagels, smoked fish, pickled vegetables, and cream cheese spreads.\n\n• Enjoy a variety of New York City's craft beer while learning about the city's brewing history on the New York Beer and Brewery Tour. The tour includes stops at many of the city's famous and historic breweries, including some in Brooklyn. (The neighborhood once dominated America's brewing industry.)"
