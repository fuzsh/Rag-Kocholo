        "text": "New York City’s food scene is world-renowned, but that didn’t happen overnight. Home to more than 24,000 restaurants (many of which open and close at breathtaking speed), there’s a handful of iconic NYC restaurants that have withstood the test of time. Let’s discuss.\n\nNote to the reader: If you feel like I’m missing one of the most iconic NYC restaurants please drop me a comment below and I’ll check it out ASAP!\n\nIconic New York City Restaurants\n\n(Table of Contents)\n\nVisiting New York City? If you haven’t decided where to stay (yet) check out my helpful guide on Where to Stay in New York City (The 10 Best Neighborhoods for First Timers +3 to Avoid). Don’t have time? Here’s my favorite hotel in NYC, hands down.\n\nKatz Delicatessen\n\nServing New Yorkers since 1888, Katz is officially the oldest deli in NYC. Not hard to see why, they make the best pastrami sandwiches in New York. Fighting words, I know. But I stand by them.\n\nThe melt-in-your-mouth pastrami is generously seasoned and dons charred outer layers, it’s an irresistible culinary masterpiece well worth the wait. But heads up, the mile-high thick-cut pastrami sandwiches are huge, I suggest splitting one between two people (plus, it makes the $30 price tag easier to stomach — some pun intended).\n\nDon’t make the mistake of billing this a tourist trap. Katz is one of the most iconic restaurants in New York City with standards as high as their pastrami on rye. Don’t just take my word for it, the deli dishes out 15,000 pounds of pastrami a week and locals love it as much as tourists.\n\nWebsite: Katz Deli\n\nNeighborhood: Lower East Side\n\nAddress: 205 E Houston St, New York, NY\n\nWhat to order: Pastrami sandwich, skip the corned beef (it’s too salty in my opinion).\n\nRuss & Daughters\n\nRuss & Daughters is a beloved Jewish deli that’s been serving the Lower East Side for more than a century. A family-run business spanning four generations, this place embodies the age-old story of resilience for many Jewish Americans.\n\nUnparalleled for traditional Jewish fare, you’ll find premium hand-sliced lox, herring, and other delicacies, but the bagel and lox is the biggest draw (folks wait up to an hour to get their hands on it). If you feel like indulging, add a scoop of caviar to the party, or opt for some caviar spread.\n\nIt seems that Russ & Daughters attracts mostly tourists these days (the lines are too long for locals), but it’s still worth a detour. I consider this a must-visit destination for anyone visiting NYC for the first time.\n\nWebsite: Russ & Daughters\n\nNeighborhood: Lower East Side\n\nAddress: 179 E Houston St, New York\n\nWo Hop\n\nDishing out Cantonese comfort food since 1938, Wo Hop was named an American Classic by the James Beard Foundation in 2022.\n\nThe menu is a roll-call of everyone’s favorites: chop suey, lo mein, and orange chicken. Don’t expect fancy plating or amuse-bouche; the appeal of this subterranean Chinatown establishment lies in unpretentious hearty fare.\n\nGenerous portions, fair prices and efficient service, there’s a reason Wo Hop’s iconic red booths and flickering fluorescent lights have been the backdrop for many late night meals.\n\nWebsite: Wo Hop\n\nAddress: 17 Mott St, New York, NY 10013\n\nWhat to order: Pork lo mein, wonton soup, chicken fried rice\n\nPeter Luger\n\nPeter Luger has earned the loyalty of stalwart locals for dishing out some of the best steaks in New York. Opened in 1887, this no frills, cash-only establishment takes great pride in spoiling New Yorkers with tantalizing dry-aged steaks.\n\nThe restaurant’s unapologetic commitment to time-honored traditions and quality make it a beloved staple for locals. Savvy tourists know to make the trek as well, eager to experience a meal at this quintessential New York dining institution.\n\nWhat to order:\n\nMain: Ribeye for two\n\nSides: Bacon & creamed spinach\n\nDessert: Don’t sleep on the cheesecake or ice cream sundae\n\nWebsite: Peter Luger\n\nNeighborhood: Williamsburg\n\nAddress: 178 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY\n\nLocal’s Tip: If you’re visiting for lunch make sure to order the burger, considered one of the best burgers in New York City.\n\nKeens Steakhouse\n\nWhat do Teddy Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, and Babe Ruth have in common? They’ve all enjoyed a meal at this iconic New York City restaurant. Contrary to what the name suggests, Keens Steakhouse is best known for delectable 1.5-pound mutton chops (the restaurant averages 400+ orders a week).\n\nThe endearing old-world charm is part of the experience. There’s more than 90,000 smoking pipes adorning the ceilings and walls. The reason? Ages ago, patrons were asked to check their pipes before sitting down for a meal (similar to coat checks). Abandoned pipes found permanent homes on the walls of this iconic restaurant in NYC.\n\nWebsite: Keens Steakhouse\n\nAddress: 72 W 36th St, New York, NY\n\nWhat to order: Mutton chops (honestly, I was underwhelmed by the steak).\n\nGood to Know: The bar at Keens makes my husband’s list of best whisky bars in New York City.\n\nDelmonico’s\n\nOpened in 1827, Delmonico’s reemerged after a lengthy hiatus post-pandemic (and some trademark disputes, go figure). Delmonico’s was a pioneering force in fine dining in the United States during the 19th century and was the first restaurant to introduce an à la carte menu in 1834 (before then restaurants served set meals).\n\nThroughout its history, Delmonico’s has been a favored haunt for the city’s elite. Celebrating 200 years in 2027, stylish locals still rely on Delmonico’s for celebratory meals. Heavy hitters include tender Rib eyes, fresh oysters and luxurious caviar.\n\nWebsite: Delmonico’s\n\nNeighborhood: Financial District\n\nAddress: 56 Beaver St, New York, NY\n\nWhat to order: Steak, steak, steak\n\nJG Melon\n\nJG Melon is a cash-only establishment known for classic no-frills burgers and irresistible cottage fries. Established in 1972, this iconic New York City restaurant is the youngest on the list, but try scoring a table on the weekend and tell me they don’t deserve the recognition.\n\nServed in a cozy tavern setting chock-full of watermelon decor, enjoying a burger at JG Melon is the quintessential New York experience. The plump seven-and-a-quarter ounce patty is griddle-cooked to perfection and comes with a side of onions and pickles, to be customized to your liking.\n\nI always top mine with cheese and consider the cottage fries a non-negotiable order. Don’t just take my word for it. Former mayor Michael Bloomberg calls these the best burgers in New York City.\n\nWebsite: JG Melon\n\nNeighborhood: Upper East Side\n\nAddress: 1291 3rd Ave, New York, NY\n\nWhat to order: Bacon cheeseburger with cottage fries.\n\nNom Wah Tea Parlor\n\nOpened in 1920 (more than 100 years ago), Nom Wah Tea Parlor is the oldest dim sum restaurant in NYC. You couldn’t miss it if you tried because the line normally snakes the block, everyone eager to try the restaurant’s famed shrimp dumplings and roasted pork buns.\n\nAs such, getting a meal at this iconic NYC restaurant is one of the best things to do in Chinatown for foodies. Admittedly, I wouldn’t recommend waiting in line if the wait time exceeds 30 minutes because while the food is good, the restaurant’s history and vibes are the biggest draw.\n\nWebsite: Nom Wah Tea Parlor\n\nAddress: 13 Doyers St, New York, NY 10013\n\nWhat to order: Dim sum and dumplings\n\nJohn’s of Bleecker Street\n\nFounded in 1929, John’s of Bleecker Street is an iconic New York City restaurant serious pizza enthusiasts can’t afford to miss. Walls adorned with photos of celebrities, windows dressed in prestigious awards collected over (nearly) 100 years, John’s holds a special place in the heart of locals.\n\nUsing a grandfathered coal-fired pizza oven, the pizza is cooked at a high temperature for a short time, resulting in blistered crust that remains chewy at the center. Served piping-hot, resist the temptation to dive right in and let the pizza cool for a minute (speaking from personal experience, unfortunately).\n\nWebsite: John’s of Bleecker Street\n\nAddress: 278 Bleecker St, New York, NY\n\nWhat to order: Classic cheese (plain pie) or pepperoni\n\nNote: John’s does NOT sell pizza by the slice, you need to purchase a whole pie. But don’t worry, after your first bite, you would have regretted having anything less.\n\nBarney Greengrass\n\nDating back to 1908, Barney Greengrass is an Upper West Side institution famous for knock-out smoked fish. No, seriously, U.S. Presidents have had it shipped to the White House. They churn out some of the best lox in New York City and the Upper West Side is lucky to have them.\n\nWebsite: Barney Greengrass\n\nAddress: 541 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10024\n\nWhat to order: lox bagel\n\nFraunces Tavern\n\nWebsite: Fraunces Tavern\n\nAddress: 54 Pearl St, New York, NY 10004\n\nFraunces Tavern holds historical significance that can’t be beat. In operation since 1762, this is where George Washington bid an emotional farewell to his troops in 1783 after the Revolutionary War, shortly before assuming the office of President.\n\nThe pub was also frequented by the likes of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr (who both attended an event at the tavern a week before their infamous duel). As one of the most iconic restaurants in NYC, it’s surprising that locals frequent this place more than visitors.\n\nThere’s a small museum upstairs ($10) depicting the room where Washington gave his farewell speech, it’s pretty cool to check out. Visiting Fraunces Tavern is always on my list of the best things to do in the Financial District for first time visitors.\n\nTavern on the Green\n\nDating back to 1934, Tavern on the Green is famous for being one of two restaurants within Central Park. Historic and picturesque, the building originally served as a sheepfold before transforming into a dinning venue for New York’s high society.\n\nIn the late 1970’s Tavern on the Green was rumored to be John Lennon’s favorite birthday venue.\n\nServing traditional American cuisine, the restaurant offers a memorable dining experience, especially during the holiday season when the restaurant is completely decked out with Christmas decorations.\n\nYou might enjoy reading: 10 Festive New York City Christmas Restaurants You’re Sure to Love\n\nWebsite: Tavern on the Green\n\nAddress: W 67th St, New York, NY\n\nWhat to order: I’m partial to the seafood and meat dishes, the cocktails are great too!\n\nMinetta Tavern\n\nDating back to 1937, Minetta Tavern is a storied establishment that has served the likes of Ernest Hemingway and E.E. Cummings. Dining at Minetta Tavern gives you a chance to experience the city’s rich history in a historic New York City restaurant that exudes old-world charm and timeless elegance.\n\nThe pièce de résistance these days is the heart-stopping Black Label burger which is made from a blend of prime dry-aged beef enhanced by the unusual addition of caramelized onions. The burger strikes a delicate balance between simplicity and sophistication, it’s a personal favorite of mine.\n\nWebsite: Minetta Tavern\n\nAddress: 113 MacDougal St, New York, NY\n\nMust Order: Black Label Burger\n\nGrand Central Oyster Bar\n\nGrand Central Oyster Bar, an endearing subterranean bar in Grand Central Terminal, has been serving fresh oysters to busy New Yorkers for more than 110 years (since 1913). Sure, there are other things on the menu— like grilled branzino and lobster pan roast — but they’re all supporting actors.\n\nThe oysters are the show and there’s more than 30 varieties to choose from (don’t sleep on the shigoku if you see them on the menu). Hell, at this point most would agree the Grand Central Oyster Bar is as much a NYC institution as Grand Central Station itself.\n\nWebsite: Grand Central Oyster Bar\n\nAddress: 89 E 42nd St, New York, NY\n\nWhat to order: Oysters, there’s 2 dozen varieties to choose from\n\nFun Fact: Oysters have played a pivotal part in the Big Apple’s history. It’s estimated that roughly half of the world’s oyster population was once located in New York Harbor.\n\nLombardi’s Pizza\n\nSome people make the mistake of assuming Lombardi’s Pizza is reserved for tourists, don’t make the same mistake. This iconic New York City restaurant has an undisputable claim to fame: it’s was the first pizzeria in America. If that’s not enough to entice you, Lombardi’s makes some of the best pizza in New York City.\n\nWebsite: Lombardi’s Pizza\n\nAddress: 32 Spring St, New York, NY\n\nWhat to order: The clam pie (trust me)\n\nList of the Most Iconic Restaurants in New York City (Post Summary)\n\nDelmonico’s\n\nPeter Luger\n\nTavern on the Green\n\nKatz Delicatessen\n\nJ.G.
