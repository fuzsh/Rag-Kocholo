        "text": "Originally built in 1719 as the mansion of Étienne de Lancey, the Fraunces Tavern on the corner of Pearl and Broad streets in Manhattan became the most famous establishment of businessman and innkeeper Samuel Fraunces (1722?–95). It served as a site for rebel activity during the American Revolution, including George Washington’s farewell address, and is now a museum.\n\nFirst named the Queen Charlotte’s Head, then the Queen’s Head, the tavern opened in 1762 and became popular with Manhattan’s elite. The first New York Chamber of Commerce meeting took place there, and members of Manhattan’s anti-British upper class, such as the New York Sons of Liberty, met at the tavern frequently before and during the American Revolution. In 1776 it was renamed Fraunces Tavern.\n\nWhen the British took New York during the first year of the war, Fraunces took his family to New Jersey to escape, but he was captured there in 1778 and put to work back in New York City as a cook, probably for British general James Robertson. When the war ended in 1783, Fraunces reopened the tavern, from which Washington delivered his famous farewell address to his staff when he left New York. Fraunces Tavern was purchased and restored by the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York in 1904 as a historic site and public museum."
