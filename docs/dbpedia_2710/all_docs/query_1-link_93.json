        "text": "The oldest neighborhood in New York City, the Financial District (FiDi) dates all the way back to the 17th century New Amsterdam era, and has been a staple of the city ever since. What was once an original Dutch settlement founded in 1624 is now one of NYC’s most popular areas, home to some of the city’s most historical buildings, businesses, and landmarks! In this guide, we’ll chat all about the best things to do, see, and eat when you’re in FiDi…from the world famous Wall Street to the oldest bar in NYC.\n\n1. One World Observatory\n\nThere’s plenty of observation decks in NYC, but One World Observatory is absolutely one of the best. Its location at the southern tip of Manhattan makes it the perfect viewing point to look uptown and see the entirety of NYC. Not to mention, it’s actually the tallest observation deck in the Western Hemisphere, offering towering city views at 1,268 feet above the Big Apple. If you’re in the neighborhood, be sure to bookmark this attraction for the stunning views, and lovely conjoining restaurant/bar and interactive experiences that lie within it.\n\n🏙️ Grab your tickets to One World Observatory here!\n\n2. 9/11 Memorial & Museum\n\nPaying tribute to the victims of September 11, 2001, the 9/11 Museum & Memorial is one of the most emotional landmarks that FiDi, and NYC has to offer. It consists of twin reflecting pools at the site of the former Twin Towers, honoring the nearly 3,000 people killed in the terrorist attacks on that day. The cascading waterfall and etched names of those lost makes it one of the most solemn things to see in person.\n\nPlus, there’s an accompanying 9/11 Museum, which includes all sorts of multimedia displays, archives, narratives, and authentic artifacts that recollect the tragic events through the eyes of those who experienced it. From the “In Memoriam” section to the “Last Column,” a 36-foot high steel column that was the final piece of steel removed from Ground Zero, it’s one of the most powerful accounts of human history in recent memory.\n\n🇺🇸 Purchase your tickets to the 9/11 Memorial & Museum here!\n\n3. South Street Seaport\n\nSouth Street Seaport is one of our favorite little neighborhoods, and it serves as the backdrop of the city’s rich maritime history. It dates all the way back to the 19th century when historic ships and fish markets used to be the center of attention for NYC as it began to grow. Nowadays, it continues to have some of some of the oldest architecture in downtown Manhattan, with preserved buildings and cobblestone streets that you won’t find elsewhere in the city.\n\nPlus, it’s turned into a cultural hub…with attractions like the South Street Seaport Museum, renovated Pier 17 (which hosts concerts, movie screenings + more), and array of restaurants, bars, and shops. It’s definitely worth a stroll through the area to check out some ships, grab some ice cream, and maybe hit the museum while you’re there.\n\n4. Battery Park\n\nFor a little splash of green, head to Battery Park in FiDi, which is a 25 acre waterfront park on Manhattan’s southern tip. The historic spot is a great spot to lounge around and take in incredible views of the New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island. It’s a great spot to take in some blooming gardens, historical landmarks, and good views. Learn more about Battery Park here!\n\n5. Stone Street\n\nOne of FiDi’s most buzzing streets continues to be Stone Street, a cobblestone road that dates not only back to the 17th century, but is home to some of the city’s most well known restaurants and bars. The car-free street is perfect for a stroll over for some food and drink…we recommend spots like Stone Street Tavern, Adrienne’s Pizzabar, and Ulysses’ Folkhouse for a pint of Guinness and live Irish music.\n\nPlus, Stone Street always goes all out for events and seasonal festivals. Holidays like St. Patrick’s Day and Cinco de Mayo are just a few occurrences when they shut down the whole street and it turns into one massive block party,\n\n6. Oculus / Westfield World Trade Center\n\nFor all your shopping needs, stop by The Oculus, one of the area’s most stunning modern architectural marvels of the past few decades. It’s a stunning transportation hub and shopping center located at the World Trade Center site, and features plenty of retail stores, dining options, and services. Browse their shopping mall full of attractions and take in the one-of-a-kind futuristic, bird-like design of the interior…which we promise is worth a photo.\n\n7. Wall Street\n\nA financial hub and main piece of FiDi’s neighborhood identity is that of Wall Street, a significant sector which is home to some of the globe’s highest financial markets and economic power. For those interested in that area of culture, it’s cool to stop by and see famous landmarks like the New York Stock Exchange, Federal Hall National Memorial (where George Washington took the oath of office as the first U.S. President), and the Charging Bull sculpture (which we’ll touch upon later).\n\n8. Overstory\n\nLooking for somewhere to eat and drink in the Financial District? Reserve a spot at Overstory, a sky-high cocktail bar that serves sensational skyline views and one-of-a-kind signature cocktails. Once you arrive to the 64th floor of 70 Pine Street, you’ll be greeted do a dimly lit oasis that feels so sultry and swanky. There’s a reason this spot has won awards for “The World’s 50 Best Bars” in recent years, and it’s because of concoctions like The Last Frontier (Gin, Sherry, Mandarin, Bee’s Wax, Yellow Chartreuse) and the Pink Tuxedo (Vodka, Cherry Blossom, Vermouth, Strawberry, Absinthe).\n\nTheir menu offers snacks if you’re looking for a bite with your drink, or you can parlay it with the incredible SAGA Restaurant that’s one floor below. Learn more about Overstory here!\n\n9. The Charging Bull\n\nA symbol for Wall Street and the financial optimism and prosperity that takes place in the area (just a stone’s throw from the New York Stock Exchange), this iconic statue is recognized everywhere and cool to see in person. The bull stands at the northern tip of Bowling Green Park, and NYC visitors can stop by and grab a photo…with many also touching the bull as a sign of good luck.\n\n10. Fraunces Tavern\n\nStop by NYC’s oldest bar in existence, to get a little glimpse of history! Fraunces Tavern (54 Pearl Street) dates all the way back to 1762, and is famous for where George Washington bid farewell to his officers at the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783. Nowadays the tradition of the era lives on, with a ground floor restaurant and bar serving a colonial-inspired American menu amongst period decor."
