        "text": "In 1674, after ten years of war and ownership battles between the Dutch and British, the Treaty of Westminster was signed, giving the official ownership of Manhattan to the British.\n\nThe land on which Fraunces Tavern stands was occupied by water until the end of the 1600s. By the last decade of the 17th century, New York City was rapidly growing into a leading colonial port. With its naturally protected harbor and its open, multi-ethnic population devoted to commerce, such growth was unstoppable. In order to raise funds for a new market house and ferry building, the city sold lots created by landfill in part of the Great Dock along Pearl Street in 1691. The new block also protected the city hall on the north side of the street from high tide flooding.\n\nThe plot of land that is 54 Pearl Street* (landfilled water lot) was purchased from the city by Stephanus Van Cortlandt (1643-1700/01) in 1686. Van Cortlandt was the son of the wealthy and well positioned Olaff Stevenson Van Cortlandt, who immigrated to New Amsterdam (Dutch New York) in 1638.\n\nStephanus Van Cortlandt’s daughter, Ann, married a young upcoming French Huguenot merchant, Stephen (Etienne) De Lancey in 1700. That same year De Lancey purchased the 54 Pearl Street lot from his father-in-law.\n\nIn 1719, De Lancey applied to the Common Council for three and a half more feet to be added to his plot of land on the northwest corner where he planned to build “a large brick house.” It is believed that sometime between 1719 and 1722 De Lancey built a house on the property. The house was probably three stories and constructed with brick, tile, and a lead roof. It is unclear if the De Lanceys ever lived in it, or used it as a rental property.\n\nFrom 1737 until 1740, Henry Holt rented 54 Pearl Street where he taught dance and held balls. Holt advertised himself as having learned from “one of the most celebrated masters in England” and “dances a considerable Time at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane.” For New Yorkers striving to keep up with European styles, dance masters like Holt were welcome additions to society.\n\nFrom 1740 to 1759, the building was most likely used for mercantile and/or residential use, as was fitting for the neighborhood at the time. In 1759, the firm De Lancey, Robinson, & Co. purchased the building. The firm, composed of Stephen De Lancey’s son Oliver, Beverley Robinson, and James Parker, dealt in imported European, West Indian, and East Indian goods, such as rum, sugar, and textiles. Despite its prime location, business was slow. In 1761, the Company offered rooms for rent but were forced to sell in 1762.\n\nSamuel Fraunces purchased 54 Pearl Street in 1762.\n\nLittle is known about the famed tavern owner, Samuel Fraunces before the year 1755. It is estimated that he was born around 1722. He is first documented in New York City in 1755 when he registered with the City as a “freeman” and “innholder.” This admission was required by law of all merchants, shopkeepers, and tradespeople who had not been born in the City or served a regular seven-year apprenticeship to a trade.\n\nIn 1762, Fraunces opened a tavern under the sign of Queen Charlotte (Queen’s Head Tavern), named for England’s Queen Charlotte, at 54 Pearl Street. In 1765, Fraunces leased management of the Tavern. He resumed proprietorship of the Tavern in 1770.\n\nTaverns were centers of community in the 18th century. Fraunces Tavern was a place where travelers and locals would exchange the latest news and ideas. Entertainment, such as musicians, could be found at the Tavern. The New York Chamber of Commerce was founded at the Tavern in 1768. Many New York clubs and organizations held meetings at the Tavern such as the New York City Sons of Liberty, New York Society Library, the Social Club, the Friendly Brothers of St. Patrick, the Knights of the Order of Corsica, and the Saint Andrew’s Society.\n\nIn May 1775, Fraunces opened his doors to the New York Provincial Congress, which was founded in the Long Room. The Provincial Congress acted as a temporary government for the colony throughout the Revolution. They were initially formed as a convention to choose delegates to participate in the Second Continental Congress. Many other revolutionaries subsequently passed through the Tavern.\n\nOn August 23, 1775, John Lamb and his artillery company attempted to steal a dozen cannons from the Battery and exchanged fire with the HMS Asia. The battleship bombarded the city from midnight until 3 o’clock in the morning. One of the 18-pound cannon balls from the HMS Asia crashed through the roof of Fraunces Tavern.\n\nThe Provincial Congress hosted a banquet in the Long Room on June 18, 1776, for General Washington, his staff, and officers to express their gratitude for the defense of the colony. The party raised 31 toasts throughout the evening, starting with the Congress and the American Army, and ending with “Civil and religious liberty to all mankind.” It was a raucous affair, with officers singing campaign songs accompanied by fife and drum. The final bill presented by Samuel Fraunces, totaling £91, included 78 bottles of Madeira, 30 bottles of port, and sixteen shillings for “wine glasses broken.”\n\n1686 The site of 54 Pearl Street was granted to Stephanus Van Cortlandt by Mayor Nicholas Bayard.\n\n1700 The property, created from the first landfill of Manhattan, was given to van Cortlandt’s daughter Ann and son-in-law, Etienne De Lancey, as a wedding present.\n\n1719 Etienne De Lancey constructed the three-story building at 54 Pearl Street as a family residence. This building is now the main building of Fraunces Tavern Museum.\n\n1738 Dance instructor Henry Holt rented the building and hosted dancing assemblies.\n\n1759 The building was occupied by De Lancey, Robinson & Company, a merchant firm, which used it as office and warehousing space.\n\n1762 The building was purchased by Samuel Fraunces and opened as the Queen’s Head Tavern (also known as the Queen Charlotte).\n\n1768 The New York Chamber of Commerce was founded in the Long Room. Its offices were situated there until 1770.\n\n1774 The Sons of Liberty plotted the New York Tea Party at the Tavern.\n\n1775 The British warship HMS Asia bombarded the city on August 24; an 18-pound cannonball went through the roof of Fraunces Tavern.\n\n1776 In May and June, the New York Provincial Congress met at the Tavern. After the city was occupied by the British, Fraunces fled to New Jersey, but was later captured and forced to return to New York City to cook for British generals. The Tavern was frequented by British soldiers.\n\n1783 After the British evacuated New York on November 25, Governor George Clinton hosted a party at the Tavern in honor of the British Evacuation of New York City and George Washington. George Washington bade farewell to his officers in the Long Room on December 4.\n\n1785 Fraunces leased part of the building to the Department of Foreign Affairs, under John Jay, and the Departments of War (under Henry Knox). He then sold the building to George Powers who leased additional space to offices of the Board of Treasury until 1788.\n\n1788 After the government moves elsewhere in New York, and then on to Philadelphia, and later to Washington, D.C., 54 Pearl Street became a tavern once again, operated and rented by John Francis.\n\n1790-1791 Powers did not have tenants in the 54 Pearl Street building.\n\n1791 Merchant, John Delafield leased the property. Under Delafield the building was operated by tenant, Benjamin Stout. Stout leased the property’s bake-house to baker, Andrew Inderweek.\n\n1793 Stout was replaced by Charles Bernardi, who ran the boarding house at 54 Pearl Street and operated a dry-good store.\n\n1795 Powers sold 54 Pearl Street to Dr. Nicholas Romaine. Under Romaine’s ownership widow, Orcet ran a boarding house.\n\n1798 Ballerina Anna Gardie, who was living with her husband in the boarding house, was murdered. Her husband was also found dead of stab wounds; the coroner ruled it a murder/suicide.\n\n1800 Orcet was replaced by Daniel Coughlen who opened a grocery store and tavern at 54 Pearl Street. That same year Romaine sold the building to builder, John Moore.\n\n1802 Coughlen was replaced by Mrs. Barde.\n\n1804 David Ross (Tavern Keeper) The Society of Cincinnati held a meeting at 54 Pearl Street. Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton attended.\n\n1813 Ruddphus Kent (Tavern Keeper)\n\n1832, 1837, 1852 The building suffered serious fires. After each fire, the owner rebuilt and added modern additions, so by the end of the 19th century the building bore little resemblance to the original structure.\n\n1837 John H. Gardner (Tavern Keeper)\n\n1845 Ernst Beurmeyer (Tavern Keeper)\n\n1866 William Stubner (Tavern Keeper)\n\n1881 Jacob Etzel (Tavern Keeper)\n\n1883 The Society of the Sons of the Revolution was founded in the Long Room on the centenary of Washington’s farewell speech.\n\n1890 The first floor was dropped to street level and the exterior was remodeled with cast iron and glass storefronts. The original timbers were sold as souvenirs.\n\n1895 Edward Michels (Tavern Keeper)\n\n1900 The building was threatened with demolition and a number of patriotic groups, notably the Daughters of the American Revolution, formed a committee to try to save it. This committee was the nucleus of the later American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society.\n\n1903 To prevent the owners from destroying the building the City of New York exercised its rights of eminent domain and designated it as a park.\n\n1904 The owners of the Tavern agreed to sell it to the Sons of the Revolution℠ in the State of New York, Inc. The City rescinded its park designation and the Sons took title in July.\n\n1905 William Mersereau was hired as restoration architect to return the building to its colonial appearance. He did extensive research and site analysis, but could not locate any image of the building prior to the first fire, which had changed its appearance greatly.\n\n1907 The restoration was completed and the building was dedicated on December 4, the anniversary of the Washington’s Farewell to his officers. The Fraunces Tavern Museum & Tavern were opened. The Tavern was managed by Emil Westerburg.\n\n1917 World War I bonds were sold in the Long Room.\n\n1937 Robert Norden Family (Tavern Keepers)\n\n1940s-1960s The Sons of the Revolution℠ in the State of New York, Inc. purchased four additional buildings: 58 Pearl Street, 101 Broad Street, and 24 and 26 Water Street, which became part of the Museum Complex.\n\n1965 The site was designated a New York City Landmark.\n\n1974 The SRNY hire the first professional curator for Fraunces Tavern Museum.\n\n1975 On January 24 a bomb exploded in the 101 Broad Street building of the Fraunces Tavern five building complex, killing four people. The “Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional Puertorriquera” claimed responsibility for the bombing.\n\n1977 Fraunces Tavern Block was designated as an Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n1979 The Museum was accredited by the American Association of Museums.\n\n1981 The Long Room was re-interpreted and exhibited as a colonial urban tavern public room as part of a Museum-wide exhibition Taverns: For the Entertainment of Friends and Strangers.\n\n1999-2000 No tenant operating as Tavern Keeper.\n\n2001 Testaverde Family (Tavern Keeper)\n\n2007 Fraunces Tavern Museum celebrated 100 years as a museum!\n\n2008 54 Pearl Street was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n2010-Present Broadwater & Pearl Associates (Tavern Keeper)\n\n2019 Celebrated 300 years since the construction of 54 Pearl Street for the De Lancey Family!\n\n2020 Tavern and Museum were closed to the public by the State of New York for five and six months respectively in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."
