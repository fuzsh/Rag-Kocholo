Free for commercial use, no attribution required. For more information see HABS No. NY-267, Fraunces Tavern Block\nSheet # 11 not received in 2008xx01 transmittal\nSignificance: It is located in the oldest settled district in Manhattan. It occupies a site that was originally below the high water line of New York Bay. The blocks immediately to the north are the site of the 17th century settlement of New Amsterdam. The water lot on which the tavern now stands was originally granted to Stephanus van Cortlandt in 1686. In 1719 the lot was prepared for construction of a large brick house by Stephen de Lancy, son-in-law of the first owner. Samuel Fraunces purchased in 1762 and established one of the finest taverns in the American colonies. \nSurvey number: HABS NY-6321 \nNational Register of Historic Places NRIS Number: 08000140 .
