        "text": "10. Fraunces Tavern\n\nIf you are looking for George Washington’s tooth, Fraunces Tavern is the place to be. The building on the corner of Pearl Street and Broad Street was constructed in 1719 in the Georgian style as a home for the Delancey family. Samuel Fraunces, an American revolutionary, turned the yellow brick structure into a tavern called the Queen’s Head. It was a meeting spot for the Sons of Liberty, and George Washington gave his farewell speech here on December 4, 1783.\n\nSince 1904, the tavern has been under the ownership of the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York. Though the many reconstructions it has undergone have attempted to restore the original edifice, several fires in the 19th century made it impossible to know the original building plan. Nowadays, Fraunces Tavern multitasks as a museum and a functioning restaurant and bar. It holds a spot on the National Register of Historic Places and was declared a landmark in 1965 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission."
