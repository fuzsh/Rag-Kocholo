        "text": "NEW YORK CITY (SBG) — A few days before I was due to visit the Fraunces Tavern Museum in Manhattan’s Financial District, I texted a friend who had already agreed to join me for a midday meal at the restaurant on the museum’s ground level and asked if she’d also be interested in taking a tour of the museum prior to our lunch reservation.\n\nI had decided that visiting some of New York City’s most haunted spots would be a fun way to spend the month of October, but I had a feeling that my friend wouldn’t necessarily agree that a history museum tour sounded “fun,” even if there was the possibility of running into a Revolutionary War-era ghost or two.\n\nAs soon as I sent my text, I received an instantaneous response. In fact, the message, which simply said “Okay!” with a degree of enthusiasm that I hadn’t expected, came so quickly that it actually appeared above the text I had sent. I figured that my ancient iPhone 6S had just glitched, and besides, her message didn’t make sense as a continuation of the conversation that we had been having earlier that day. But just to be sure, I asked her if she was agreeing to go to the museum.\n\nSome say that you’re less likely to encounter ghosts when you’re actively looking for them, as if ghosts have a strong preference for catching the subjects of their hauntings entirely off-guard. In operating with a firm mission of seeking out spirits, I may have inadvertently persuaded some of them to stay hidden in the shadows, or wherever ghosts might choose to hang out when they aren’t stomping across the floor above you or knocking over heavy objects in unoccupied rooms, for as long as I remained in their territory.\n\nBut with ghosts at the very forefront of my mind, any unexplained occurrence that had even the slimmest chance of serving as a sign of the paranormal became, to me, just that.\n\nDespite the large construction project happening just outside of the St. John Cloister Mausoleum in St. John Cemetery, the faint thuds coming from an undetermined location probably stemmed from the spirits sharing a final resting place with organized crime boss John Gotti. When my voice memo stopped recording during the tour at the Fraunces Tavern Museum, that, too, was the work of ghosts. The face that I saw in the leaves of the Hangman’s Elm at Washington Square Park? Ghosts, without a doubt.\n\nAnd who’s to say that the random pressure that built up in my ears as soon as I pointed my camera at a second-floor window at the Morris-Jumel Mansion didn’t come from a spectral being watching my every move while masked by the glare of the afternoon sun? In fact, as I diligently searched each of my photos for ghostly forms that I hadn’t noticed in the moment, I swore that I could just barely make out his profile, almost completely camouflaged by the reflection of the trees on the glass windowpane but still visible with a sharp enough eye, or maybe just with a vivid enough imagination.\n\nDespite living mere blocks from the 478-acre cemetery for as long as I’ve been in Brooklyn, I’ve never considered the fact that it could be haunted during any prior visits. But midway through an early morning bird walk in the beginning of October, I aimed my camera directly at a headstone to capture misty beams from the rising sun perfectly illuminating the angelic figure that stood atop it in a soft glow. My camera took the photo — and then immediately became unresponsive. For the rest of the bird walk, the screen continued to freeze periodically on a setting that I’ve never touched, eventually righting itself each time but only after several minutes of patience.\n\nThe next day, I used my camera for upwards of five hours. Not even once did it freeze during that entire period of extensive use, and it hasn’t frozen in the weeks since either.\n\nScouring that photo from Green-Wood for ghosts, however, proved to be unfruitful. So did my attempts to discover any meaningful message in the headstone, which I found belonged to a woman named Minnie Dorney, the wife of a theater manager. But during my research, I did stumble upon several accounts from others who had also experienced camera issues of some sort within the Brooklyn cemetery.\n\nAnd if you’re a true believer, your mind might very easily jump to conclusions in spooky scenarios to reaffirm your preexisting notions. In fact, the very impression that the scenarios are, indeed, spooky can be a product of your attitudes toward ghosts. Awareness of the purportedly haunted nature of a specific location can lead to a heightened sensitivity to one’s surroundings, such that creaking floorboards in distant rooms and traces of movement seen only out of the corner of one’s eye become more likely to be observed than they would be otherwise.\n\nBecause the power of suggestion is often extremely successful in its ability to influence a person’s perception of reality based on the information presented to that individual and their resulting expectations, any good paranormal investigator knows that jumping to conclusions would only further put the legitimacy of their work into question. An honest effort, then, is needed to debunk the very theories that the investigator is hoping to prove.\n\nEstablished as a family chapel in 1660 by Petrus Stuyvesant, the final director-general of New Netherland, St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bowery has been the site of frequent paranormal disturbances since Stuyvesant's death. It’s not only this timing that has long had people convinced that it’s the former governor haunting the Episcopal church but the peculiar sounds of stomping that seem best explained by pointing to Stuyvesant's wooden peg leg and even several alleged sightings of “Peg Leg Pete” on the grounds.\n\nSo the clock’s unusual patterns of movement, described as “positively skittish” and “undignified” in a New York Times article about the incident, could have easily been accepted as yet another way that Stuyvesant was making his presence known over three centuries after his death. But eager to once again have a working clock, the assistant sexton summoned a repairman. A crowd of thousands watched as the repairman identified the cause of the timepiece’s strange behavior — a pigeon in desperate need of rescue from an entanglement with a kite string. Ultimately, the pigeon was freed and nursed back to health, while the clock resumed its normal operations.\n\nThe Morris-Jumel Mansion is another spot that frequently tops lists of New York City’s most haunted places. The mansion, built in 1765 on a bluff in what is now the neighborhood of Washington Heights, is the oldest standing house in Manhattan. It’s a favorite trivia fact that George Washington very briefly set up a temporary headquarters in the mansion during the Revolutionary War, but the house’s resident ghost is a wealthy socialite named Eliza Jumel who lived there for most of her adult life.\n\nThe mansion gained its spooky reputation in the 1960s, when Eliza Jumel, who had died a century prior, appeared on the second-floor balcony and told a noisy group of children to stop making so much noise. A follow-up seance all but confirmed, for those who believe in the afterlife, that Eliza Jumel’s spirit was still residing in her former home. It’s also been speculated that a Hessian soldier haunted the house even during the socialite’s lifetime.\n\nIt was initially assumed that the sound was a tree branch hitting against the house, but unable to find the source of the thumping during thorough examinations of the house’s exterior, staff members began to consider the possibility of paranormal involvement. Eventually, though, Lynch squashed those theories when she discovered that the top pane of a window was knocking into its bottom pane. Each time that the bottom pane fell back into place, there was an accompanying thud.\n\nBut not every attempt to debunk the paranormal has been quite so successful. There’s no entrapped bird that can be blamed for the apparition of a woman in period clothing sitting at the end of a pew inside of St. Mark’s or the distinct sound of a peg leg echoing throughout.\n\nAmong those unexplained phenomena at the Morris-Jumel Mansion are increased signals from electromagnetic field detectors in areas where a spike wouldn’t otherwise be expected and audio recordings capturing mysterious voices and startling sounds that weren’t heard in the moment but show up clearly after the fact.\n\n“There’s a question as to whether or not the recording has picked up on something that’s been said in the room that we couldn’t hear, or are these devices manipulable for these entities?” said Lynch.\n\nIn trying to debunk the possibility, I came up empty-handed. She hadn’t been holding her phone at the time of the enthusiastic text message, and she wasn’t wearing her smartwatch either. She lives alone, so there were no roommates, family members, or even pets who could have sent it. And she still insists that she was not responsible for it.\n\nOver the past 302 years, the building now occupied by the Fraunces Tavern Museum served a wide variety of purposes, from a tavern to dancehall to a boarding home. It was the site of multiple serious fires, a widely publicized murder-suicide during its stint as a boarding home, and a 1975 bombing that killed four men and injured 43 others. With a history like that, the Fraunces Tavern Museum seems like a reasonable guess as to where you might find a few ghosts.\n\nIn the nearly six years that Tsaltas-Ottomanelli has worked for the museum, she has sensed the presence of ghosts on numerous occasions, but she’s never ascribed a malicious intent to the footsteps, banging, and laughter that frequently punctuate an otherwise silent room.\n\nAllie Delyanis, communications and marketing manager at Fraunces Tavern Museum, has one simple request that she asks of the ghosts, which is to please not scare her. “I don’t want to see you. You can be here, you can hang out, and you can do your thing, but I don’t want to be made aware of you, please,” she said.\n\nThankfully, the spectral residents at 54 Pearl Street have thus far been willing to comply with Delyanis’ plea. She agreed with Tsaltas-Ottomanelli that the unexplained incidents that tend to occur outside of the museum’s operating hours, while startling, have never truly frightened her.\n\nTo better understand how to peacefully coexist with those longtime occupants who are unwilling to leave, the Fraunces Tavern Museum formed a partnership with Gotham Paranormal. Angela Artuso, director of Gotham Paranormal, visits the museum on a consistent basis with recording devices and a spirit box in hand, ready to ask questions of the ghosts in hopes of receiving meaningful responses through the spirit box and capturing EVP in the recordings.\n\nA spirit box, according to paranormal investigators who make use of the technology, will scan radio frequencies to create white noise through which ghosts are able to communicate. One question is asked at a time, followed by a pause to allow the spirits time to respond, if they so choose.\n\nFrom their personal experiences using a spirit box with Artuso, both Delyanis and Tsaltas-Ottomanelli believe that the device truly does enable them to receive communications from the other side. They described a fairly heartwarming moment, at least as far as interactions with the paranormal go, during which the investigators asked the spirits if they “knew these girls” and received an enthusiastic amount of feedback as a response. Recent interactions through the spirit box have also given Delyanis and Tsaltas-Ottomanelli the impression that the entities present in the Fraunces Tavern Museum missed them during the museum’s temporary closure at the start of the pandemic.\n\nMany of the ghosts in New York City, or at least those who have most famously made their presence known in public places across the five boroughs, are of the historical type, often choosing to haunt well-preserved locations that offer a lingering glimpse into life long ago. So even if you fail to connect with any spirits on a personal level during your ghost hunt, you’re likely to still walk away feeling better acquainted with those who called the city home long ago.\n\nFor instance, as many times as I’ve gone shopping on Spring Street in SoHo, I’ve never had any idea that there was a centuries-old well in the basement of the H&M-owned clothing store COS. The well in its existing form, which stands out quite a bit against the shop’s minimalist fashion, is a curious sight to see even without any backstory. Learning about the well’s history as the location of a gruesome murder makes it all the more unsettling, and the building is still said to be haunted by the ghost of the woman whose body was found at the bottom of the well.\n\nAnd the Morris-Jumel Mansion had never crossed my radar, either, which meant that the tour provided me with a slew of interesting information beyond accounts of the paranormal. Through the facts that I learned about Eliza Jumel’s life and the picture that was painted of her personality, her ghost became a more well-rounded character as well, fully distinguishable from the immediate image of a conventional ghost that tends to pop into someone’s head in general discussions regarding the paranormal.\n\nAt the Merchant’s House Museum in Manhattan, there’s a similar focus on those who called the building home from the earliest years of occupancy in the 1830s until the death of the last remaining member of the Tredwell family in 1933.\n\nFor the past 13 years, the museum has worked exclusively with paranormal investigator Dan Sturges in hopes of finding explanations, paranormal or otherwise, for some of the strange happenings that have taken place in the 19th-century home. Through years of thorough investigations, Sturges has accumulated a wealth of data, including a significant body of EVP recordings.\n\n“We have to remember that these are people who just don’t have a body anymore,” Struges said. “According to this one fellow, he has connected with the Tredwells and also with some of the servants who worked there. They know what we’re doing, they understand what we’re doing, and they think it’s great. They enjoy how much we enjoy the house.”\n\nSturges credits the stories that his grandmother would tell him about the Loch Ness Monster for sparking his interest in ghosts from a young age, but regardless of his affinity for the paranormal, debunking is still a major aspect of his approach to investigations. Before deciding to visit a location, he’ll look into it as much as possible and talk to the current residents, as well as any former occupants that turn up during his research. Often, answers are found without even needing to travel to the location of the suspected paranormal activity.\n\nBut at the Merchant’s House Museum, simple explanations are few and far between. “You almost take it for granted sometimes that something strange is going to happen at the Merchant’s House,” said Sturges. “It just blows your mind.”\n\nFor years, the museum has been fighting against plans for a massive hotel next door whose construction would almost certainly cause irreplaceable damage to the 19th-century brick building. It’s been a costly battle with more than $275,000 spent on legal fees and engineering studies, and the reduced income as a result of the temporary closure was a harsh blow in their fight to preserve this important piece of New York City history.\n\nBut one silver lining to the museum’s pandemic-induced closure came in the opportunity to up the ante of the paranormal investigations. Without having to worry about interference from guests touring the museum, Sturges could set up recording devices for longer periods of time and started tuning in at all hours from his living room, proving that even paranormal investigations were immune to the virtual treatment. He also partnered with a neuroscientist who goes by the pseudonym of Dr. Lee to introduce scientific methods into his process.\n\n“He’s got all kinds of really cutting-edge equipment that, as far as I can tell, hasn’t been used in paranormal investigations before,” said Sturges of Dr. Lee. “It’s really groundbreaking stuff that we’ve been able to do.”\n\nRoan ended up getting the tour guide job and now shares this spooky knowledge with all who attend her tours. She finds that people are particularly surprised to learn just how haunted Washington Square Park is, given how centrally located the park is compared to those haunted spots that are tucked away into the furthest corners of the five boroughs. So many ghosts, after all, seem to have a preference for isolated, abandoned areas. So when Roan tells groups that the consistently busy Washington Square Park was once a massive public burial ground, they’ll immediately look down at the land on which they’re standing with new eyes.\n\nMany of my experiences within New York City have taken place in neighborhoods that I’ve deemed easy to reach from my Brooklyn apartment, my criteria being that it takes me less than an hour to get there on a single subway line. Exceptions to this rule have been made, but I can count the number of times I’ve gone to the Bronx on a single hand. While my exploration of Queens has been a bit more thorough, I’ve primarily stuck to neighborhoods accessible via the subway. And in the decade that I’ve spent living in the city, I’ve visited Staten Island twice.\n\nA trip to the Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum broke several of my commuting rules. It required not only two different subway lines but also a short ride on something called the Bee-Line bus. Provided that both of these transfers went smoothly, which is far from a guarantee when dealing with the MTA, it would take me approximately two hours to reach the mansion.\n\nThe mansion, situated within Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx on land that once belonged to the Lenape tribe, was built in 1842 and occupied only until 1888 when the city purchased the property from the Bartow family. But despite the lack of living residents, the estate is said to be home to numerous spirits. There’s the ghost of a murdered traveler who roams the grounds in pursuit of vengeance, the spectral form of a child seen wandering around the third floor, and an angelic presence that inspires a feeling of peacefulness in the North Parlor. Indentations often form overnight on a mahogany bed crafted in the early 19th century, and the faint sound of hypnotic music sometimes floats through the mansion.\n\nBecause I’m not always the best planner, I headed directly from the Bartow-Pell Mansion to the Conference House on the southern edge of Staten Island, a nearly three-hour expedition involving the Bee-Line bus, a subway transfer, the Staten Island Ferry, the entire route of the Staten Island Railway, and finally, a 20-minute walk.\n\nI arrived well after sunset to discover that the Conference House Park is not particularly well-lit. The Conference House itself was in complete darkness and devoid of any other visitors, which meant that I found it to be one of the creepiest places that I visited, even if I didn’t see the candlelight of the maid that British Loyalist Christopher Billop had murdered in accordance with his belief that she was a spy, nor did I hear the broken-hearted pleas of the fiancee that Billop had abandoned.\n\nWhile the pitch-black park in which the Conference House stood had enhanced the historic home’s creepiness, I felt a similar level of unease during my visit to Fort Totten on a bright, sunny afternoon. Even the blue skies above couldn’t sufficiently shake my apprehension as I wandered through a maze of tunnels with some trepidation and peeked around dark corners with the constant expectation of encountering a paranormal entity.\n\nThe former army base, located on such a distant peninsula in Queens that I caved and called a cab there from St. John Cemetery, serves as a training ground for both the NYPD and the FDNY, a park for New Yorkers with a fondness for abandoned buildings, and a home for a plethora of mostly unidentified spirits.\n\nThe foreboding feeling that I experienced within the fortress could very well have been provoked by those spirits, but a psychological principle presented an admittedly stronger case in way of an explanation. The “prospect and refuge” theory suggests that humans will be more frightened of places that don’t offer a sufficient opportunity to clearly observe their surroundings while still remaining concealed. Fort Totten’s long tunnels, multiple entry points, and dense greenery detracted from my perception of both prospect and refuge.\n\nIn Queens, there’s St. John Cemetery in Middle Village, where the most notorious members of New York’s Italian-American Mafia have been given the opportunity to reunite in the afterlife, and the more run-down Machpelah Cemetery, a small Jewish burial ground located within the borough’s massive cemetery belt and a top destination for devotees of magic looking to pay their respects at the grave of famed escape artist Harry Houdini. Phantom noises have been reported at both, as well as shadowy figures at Machpelah.\n\nThe Bronx has Woodlawn Cemetery, and Staten Island, Moravian Cemetery; neither has any shortage of documented encounters with the afterlife. Manhattan’s St. Paul Churchyard is haunted by a headless specter to rival the horseman of Sleepy Hollow, a successful English actor by the name of George Frederick Cooke whose missing skull is surrounded by legend. According to one of the most popular rumors, Cooke’s skull somehow ended up as a prop during a production of “Hamlet.” Now, he roams the churchyard in hopes of retrieving his head.\n\nBut I made my way from one cemetery to the next, it was only in the aforementioned Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn where I experienced even the slightest hint of communication from the other side.\n\nIf all of that ghost hunting has you craving a stiff drink, several bars will serve you guaranteed spirits to go along with those that you can only hope to encounter.\n\nPredictably, haunted bars tend to be inhabited by spirit-loving spirits. At the White Horse Tavern, you might have the opportunity to drink with the long-deceased Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who has not lost his appetite for alcohol despite dying shortly after a drinking binge involving 18 straight whiskeys. In Thomas’ honor, the cocktail menu includes “The Dylan Thomas,” a double pour of Jack served neat. Attempts to break the poet’s record, though, are not recommended.\n\nAnd over at the Ear Inn, a tavern whose operations date back, in some form, to the early 19th century, a former patron named Mickey the Sailor, who used to beg the bartenders to stay open past closing time, still refuses to leave. One story cites alcohol poisoning as the sailor’s cause of death, while another claims that he was struck by a car upon exiting the bar and soon succumbed to the injuries he suffered in the crash. Mickey’s spirit has since taken to bothering female waitresses and guests and sneaking sips of customers’ drinks.\n\nMy bartender at the White Horse Tavern had never personally encountered Thomas’s spirit during his tenure behind the bar. But while I guarded my espresso martini from Mickey the Sailor’s undying thirst, the bartender at the Ear Inn acknowledged that he had been witness to several strange incidents.\n\nObviously, the jury is still out on that one. “We’ve never been dead,” said Lynch. “I’ve never been dead. You’ve never been dead. We don’t really know for sure what happens.”\n\nBut given the peculiar situations that she has personally experienced at the Morris-Jumel Mansion, Lynch isn’t ready to dismiss the possibility. She suspects that we may receive more clarity into the matter years down the line.\n\n“If you lived in 1750 and someone told you, ‘Oh, Benjamin Franklin just discovered this energy that comes out of the sky, but it’s invisible,’ you’d probably be like, ‘Yeah, right.’ Or what if someone told you that there was this ability to call someone across the world and talk real-time and hear each other’s voices? Who knows what else we don’t know and what future technologies will reveal to us?” Lynch said.\n\nShould they actually exist, the spirits of past New Yorkers who continued to call the five boroughs home long after their deaths have had a front-row seat to this changing world that Lynch described? They’ve watched almost wordlessly as the city has undergone a major transformation into something that bears almost no resemblance to the home that they once knew. Only fragments of a familiar world remain for the spirits, found in these carefully preserved places like the Merchant’s House Museum and Fraunces Tavern that have recognized the crucial importance of protecting the lingering memories of New York City’s past.\n\nAccordingly, there seems to be a consensus among paranormal investigators that the spirits appreciate the work that is being done to allow them to share snippets of their life with those still living.\n\n“I think most places might have a story to tell,” said Sturges. “It just takes somebody going in there with the right frame of mind and good intentions, and places start talking to you.”"
