        "text": "I like spending my weekends on little adventures throughout NYC to visit neighborhoods I rarely get to. I use these adventures to try restaurants that are new to me but are truly historical within the context of the city. For me, it is the epitome of sightseeing to dine in a historic location, marvel at the rooms and furniture, and think about all the history these sites have seen. Here are a few options to go back in time as you explore this great city.\n\nFraunces Tavern (Downtown / FiDi)\n\n54 Pearl Street, New York, NY 10004\n\nhttps://frauncestavern.com/\n\nEstablished in 1762, this is the oldest on the list and the longest-standing tavern in NYC. George Washington hosted his officers here at the end of the Revolutionary War. A museum above the restaurant is worth checking out for the $10 admission fee. It wasn’t continuously operated as a tavern for all of the 260-plus years, but it is truly impressive just the same. There are differing dining and serving areas throughout the building.\n\nThis building is most famous as the site where, on December 4, 1783, George Washington gathered a group of his officers, nine days after the last of the British troops left American soil, to thank them for their service and bid them an emotional farewell before returning home. The only first-hand account of the Farewell comes from The Memoirs of Colonel Benjamin Tallmadge, which Fraunces Tavern Museum has on display. Fraunces Tavern® Museum is the only Museum in New York City that allows visitors to discover the American Revolutionary past in NYC’s oldest standing structure. (https://frauncestavern.com/new-york-fidi-battery-park-downtown-lower-east-side-tribeca-city-hall-south-street-seaport-fraunces-tavern-about\n\nFood — Just okay\n\nAtmosphere — The best! We were seated in the bar with a jazz trio playing lightly in the background. But the building and rooms exude history that I’ve never before experienced.\n\nPrice — Surprisingly reasonable\n\nPete’s Tavern (Gramercy)\n\n129 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003\n\nhttps://www.petestavern.com/\n\nThis is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city, established in 1864. Similar to Fraunces in the atmosphere. This is a must-see if you are in NYC during the holiday season. I discovered the tavern on a list of the best holiday-decorated restaurants in the city, and it did not disappoint. There is a large dining room past the main bar area pictured here.\n\nFood — Good\n\nAtmosphere — You can feel old NYC seeping out of the walls and woodwork\n\nPrice — Average for NYC at about $20 a plate for lunch\n\nFanelli Cafe (Downtown / SoHo)\n\n94 Prince Street, New York, NY 10012\n\nhttps://fanellicafe.nyc/\n\nI stumbled across this spot when out shopping in the neighborhood. I didn’t know what I was walking into, but I was at once mesmerized by the vibe. It was clearly a historic building, from the woodwork of the bar to the stained tin ceiling. I looked it up online to find it had been operating since 1847.\n\nFood — The breakfast I had wasn’t particularly special, but it was good. I seem to recall limited options in things like the choice of bread for toast or potatoes.\n\nAtmosphere — It’s worth taking the time to pay attention to the details of the dining room.\n\nPrice — In line with a NYC diner at about $20 per plate. But it’s a bit more casual than many spots in NYC, so you’ll likely be less tempted to indulge in appetizers and desserts.\n\nKatz’s Deli (Lower East Side)\n\n205 East Houston (pronounced How-Stun), New York, NY\n\nhttps://katzsdelicatessen.com/\n\nThis place is famous in its own right as the oldest Jewish Deli in NYC, having gotten its start in 1888. When Harry Met Sally catapulted its popularity as the site of the famous scene ending with a restaurant patron saying, “I’ll have what she is having.” Fun fact: the woman with that line was Estelle Reiner, Rob Reiner’s mom and Carl Reiner’s wife. There are a few things to know before you go here. This review on TripAdvisor aligns with what I recall.\n\n“I think you go for the experience. We waited outside for about 15–20 minutes to get in. Then, I walked into a chaotic room packed with people. We found a short line and waited another 15 minutes to order.”\n\nThere will likely be a line out the door. Get on in and hang tight for the wait. It does go surprisingly fast.\n\nOnce at the front of the line, you will be given a ticket and then wait to order at a counter.\n\nA pastrami sandwich is $26, but it is huge. Share or save half. The truth is that you won’t find a pastrami sandwich in NYC under $20 unless it is a fast food joint, but they are always big enough to feed two easily. You will also be able to order a side or two to share.\n\nGrab a seat at a community-style dining table in the packed dining room.\n\nLook for the hanging sign to find Harry and Sally’s table.\n\nFood — Excellent. It’s been around for 135 years for a reason.\n\nAmbiance — It is a large, loud, crowded dining hall, but the old-world charm abounds.\n\nPrice — Expensive for a sandwich but in line with what to expect in NYC. Plan on sharing, and it won’t be so bad.\n\nPastrami Queen\n\n1125 Lexington Ave #2, New York, NY 10028 (Upper East Side)\n\n138 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023 (Upper West Side)\n\nhttps://www.pastramiqueen.com/\n\nThis one isn’t quite as historic as others on the list, only having been around since 1956, but I wanted to offer up this viable alternative to Katz’s Deli. They have locations on either side of Central Park on the Upper West and Upper East Sides and a third location on Moynihan Food Hall (Penn Station). The Upper East Side location is a hole in the wall with just a few dining tables, but always huge on flavor. Prices are comparable to Katz’s, but there is a more extensive selection here. You could easily load up on food to go here and then head the step of The Metropolitan Museum or into Central Park to people-watch while you picnic.\n\n“The real deal pastrami sandwich.” — Anthony Bourdain\n\nPrice — Expensive but in line with NYC norms for a classic, quality Jewish Deli\n\nAmbiance- I can only speak to the Upper East Side location, but it feels like a hole in the wall. They have a deli counter with a glass case where you can choose from various sides and a few dining tables available.\n\nFood — Also excellent, you won’t be disappointed\n\nUpdated October 15, 2023 — I just found this post on Instagram. Check out number 1 and 2.\n\nI’ll share about how to eat like a local without breaking the bank in a future post. Stay tuned!\n\nPlease let me know if you have a historical favorite I should consider adding to the list in the comments. I welcome a good excuse to check out a new neighborhood and new eatery."
