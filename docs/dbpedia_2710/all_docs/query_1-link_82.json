        "text": "We were looking for a place for dinner on a Friday evening and were looking for reservations, when we stumbled upon Fraunces Tavern. We knew this place after going there years ago with our friends Jen and Gary for brunch, but never went back, the Financial District not being an area we consider often. Until now. This place has a lot of history, as I wrote previously:\n\n“ Fraunces Tavern is said to be the oldest surviving building in Manhattan per the Sons of Liberty who are the lucky owners since 1904. This building is filled with history! According to the Fraunces Tavern Museum website, the current building was built in 1719 by Etienne \"Stephan\" Delancey, a French Huguenot who married the daughter of New York's Mayor Stephanus Van Cortlandt. Delancey's heirs then sold the building to Samuel Fraunces who decided to open a tavern called the Queen's head. It is in this tavern that, before the revolution, gathered regularly the Sons of Liberty, a political group of American patriots that was formed, pre-independence, to protect the rights of the colonist from the rules set by the British government.\n\nBut, one of the most famous story about this place lies in the dinner that took place on December 4th 1783: the \"Turtle Feast\". After British troops evacuated New York, the General (soon to be President) George Washington organized a farewell to his troops and said, in the long room: \"with a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you. I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable.\"\n\nAfter that, Samuel Fraunces became Washington's Chief Steward and, after the war, at the time New York was the Nation's Capital, the place was rented to the Government to house the Departments of War, Treasury and Foreign Affairs.”"
