        "text": "About the database\n\nLaunched in 2017, Fraunces Tavern Museum's Online Collections database offers users unprecedented access to objects in the collection, and documents the histories of the American Revolutionary era, its cultural legacy, and 54 Pearl Street itself.\n\nWe are continually working to add records to this catalogue and improve this site. Please note that the collections database may be unavailable if updates are being made. If you notice any errors or have additional information about an image, please let us know by emailing collections@frauncestavernmuseum.org.\n\nAbout these records\n\nThe database is an inventory of the Museum's collections and aims to record what we know about them. It is primarily designed to support curatorial and research work, so the text may be specialized in nature and terminology.\n\nWe are continuing every day to improve the information recorded in it and changes are being added on a regular basis. In many cases, a record may not yet represent the best available knowledge about the objects. Information held on it, therefore, needs to be read with care. As there may be occasional mistakes or omissions, users may provide feedback through the link on each record to help us improve the information.\n\nTips for Searching\n\nKeyword Search\n\nThe Keyword Search button allows you to perform a general search across multiple fields for any catalog records online. Keyword searches use OR as the default connector between words (e.g. a search for George Washington will return records associated with George OR Washington). If you want to find records where both keywords are found, type in AND between the two words. To search for a specific phrase, be sure to put the phrase within quotes (e.g. \"Valley Forge\"). You can also use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard (e.g. a search for histor* would come up with records containing history, histories, historical, etc.). Searches are not case sensitive.\n\nAdvanced Search\n\nThe Advanced Search button can help you be more specific with your search. You can search for a word or phrase within a particular search category or use multiple categories to further narrow down your search results. For example, searching White in the People field will bring up any records associated with a member of the White family, without having to sift through black & white photographs. You can also search People and Creator records through Advanced Search. Phrase searching with quotes and use of wildcards (*) are available in Advanced Search.\n\nCatalog Searches (Archives / Objects)\n\nThe catalog buttons can also help narrow down your search, by only searching with a selected catalog. If you only want to search for Objects, click the Objects button and type in your keyword(s) or phrase. You can also browse records within that catalog without performing a search. Phrase searching, wildcards (*) as well as AND/OR statements are available when performing catalog searches.\n\nSpecial Collections\n\nClick the links below to see special object collections, including selected past and current exhibitions.\n\nTools of the Tavern\n\nSpecial digital collection\n\nThe Long Room\n\nCurrently on display\n\nOn the second floor of 54 Pearl Street is the Long Room. It is the site of General George Washington’s famous farewell to his officers at the end of the Revolution. This period room is a re-creation of an 18th century public dining room based on extensive research of inventories and estates of tavern keepers during this period.\n\nA Stoic Countenance: Portraits of George Washington\n\nCurrently on display\n\nFew individuals have been as honored and revered in American history as George Washington. Elected as the rebellion’s military leader in 1775 as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, and eventually unanimously elected as the first American President, he embodied the spirit of the American people.\n\nWashington was a symbol of popular political participation and resistance to authority, while also being a champion of law and order. He possessed numerous virtues including duty, bravery, and loyalty that continue to inspire respect and emulation. These attributes, along with his impressive physical stature, moved numerous artists to create portraits of Washington during his lifetime.\n\nThe majority of the prints on display in the exhibition were issued during the last quarter of the 18th century, and seen together they give a rare glimpse into the attitudes and perspectives of that period.\n\nHistory of the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York (SRNY)\n\nCurrently on display\n\nLocated above the Long Room, this exhibition explains the history of the organization that saved Fraunces Tavern. Visitors can learn about the SRNY and its community involvement through the displays of artifacts, images, and plaques which are kept in original early 20th century museum cases, built by Tiffany & Company.\n\nThe Clinton Room\n\nDisplayed until December 2021\n\nFraunces Tavern featured a number of private rooms like this one for the accommodation of private clubs and companies. A number of clubs, societies, and business groups met regularly in Fraunces Tavern and enjoyed the famous hospitality and fine food that the tavern was known for. It would not be uncommon for a small group of gentleman to dine in a room such as this one (women would rarely have come to dinner at a tavern).\n\nThe Federal style furnishings in this room date from the first quarter of the 19th century. This style of cabinet making was adopted in America after the Revolutionary War, from the late 18th century English cabinetmakers who crafted classical style furniture from designs inspired by objects found in the archaeological excavation at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Duncan Phyfe, for example, was a well renowned local cabinetmaker of the time that was known for his work in the Federal style.\n\nA Flash of Color: Early American Flags and Standards\n\nDisplayed until March 2020\n\nConfidential: The American Revolution's Agents of Espionage\n\nSeptember 2017 - September 2019\n\nValuable\n\nNovember 2016 - November 2018\n\nDunsmore: Illustrating the American Revolutionary War\n\nJune 2016-June 2018"
