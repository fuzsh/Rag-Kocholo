        "text": "Every patriotic New Yorker worth his or her weight in saltpeter knows that the 253-year-old Fraunces Tavern (the actual edifice was built in 1719) is the site where, in 1783, a war-weary George Washington bade a tearful farewell to his troops. Six years later the former commander in chief retook the title as America’s first president in the country’s first capital.\n\nBut that’s barely skimming the storied surface of Manhattan’s most historical saloon. “Sam Fraunces spied for the Continental Army and he was an amazing host,” said Jessica Phillips, the 32-year-old executive director of the tavern’s upstairs museum. “Washington hired him to be the first steward at the presidential household — can you imagine how many taverns Washington went to in his lifetime?”\n\nIt was also rumored that Fraunces might have played a little fast and loose with the title of “free white man” on the tavern’s contemporary deed.\n\n“There are people that claim to be descendants of Fraunces and have done DNA testing, that has proven to have genetic links to Africa,” explained Ms. Phillips, “but that doesn’t necessarily mean that those genetics have come from him.”"
