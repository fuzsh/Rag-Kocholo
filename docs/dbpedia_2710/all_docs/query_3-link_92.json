        "text": "AFTER you've rubbed your eyes once or twice and shaken off the notion that it's impossible, the delightfully incongruous truth becomes clear. A bow-backed, Federal-style town house from the early 19th century -- perhaps the work of Pierre L'Enfant, who planned the city of Washington -- still stands in Manhattan's financial district.\n\nYou won't find the Robert Dickey House in most guide books. It is not an official landmark. What was once a garden was long ago covered by an ugly one-story addition. Perched precariously near the yawning entrance to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, its Flemish-bond bricks painted battleship gray, the house almost disappears into the background.\n\nAs such, it is a trophy for anyone rambling through lower Manhattan in search of little-known remnants from the past, architectural and historical odds and ends tucked among the bulky skyscrapers of the financial empire. What follows is a walking tour of such buildings; places that few people have heard of back home, even if home is New York City.\n\nTrinity Church and St. Paul's Chapel are not central to this itinerary. Neither are Federal Hall or City Hall, the Stock Exchange or Merchants Exchange, the Custom House or India House, the Chamber of Commerce or \"Cathedral of Commerce,\" as the Woolworth Building was called. (A visit to the lobby will instantly tell you why.) These and other worthy destinations at the southern tip of Manhattan all are covered in depth in several excellent guidebooks.\n\nFor the sake of orientation, and perhaps a cup of coffee or a bite to eat, the tour begins and ends at two tourist landmarks: Battery Park City and the South Street Seaport.\n\nAt Battery Park City, the freshly minted commercial and residential complex built on 92 acres of landfill, visitors can begin the day with a stroll on the esplanade along the Hudson River. From there, it is a short journey over the Liberty Street pedestrian bridge back to the beginnings of this century, when the area was a vital Greek and Syrian quarter. Still functioning is St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church (155 Cedar Street), which looks almost Aegean in its whitewashed plainness. The sanctuary occupies the ground floor of a little 19th-century building with a cross-topped bell gable on its roof.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
