The closest options are the 4 and 5 trains to Bowling Green, the R train to Whitehall, and 1 train to South Ferry.\n\nOpen from 11:30 am - 12 am on Sun-Wed and from 11:30 am to 2:30 am on Thu, Fri, and Sat.\n\nHistory of Fraunces Tavern\n\nThe property was originally owned by the Mayor of New York Stephanus Van Cortlandt.\n\nVan Cortlandt was the first native-born mayor of the city.\n\nHe decided to relocate his home and gave the property to his daughter Anne and her husband Etienne “Stephen” DeLancey.\n\nDeLancey built a home at 54 Pearl Street in 1719.\n\nThe yellow brick house was considered a sizeable mansion at the time of its construction.\n\nThe DeLancey family lived there until 1762 when Stephen DeLancey’s children sold it to Samuel Fraunces.\n\nAs Fraunces Tavern (Colonial Era)\n\nFraunces converted the home into a tavern called the Queen’s Head Tavern, named for Queen Charlotte of England.\n\nTaverns were a cornerstone of 18th-century colonial social life, and the tavern thrived.\n\nThe colony of New York was heading for drastic changes, however.\n\nA series of new laws and restrictions were placed on the colonists by the Crown and general unrest spread throughout the colonies.\n\nDespite the tavern’s Loyalist-sounding name, it was used as a meeting place for the secret Sons of Liberty society, a group that sought to protect the rights of the American colonists.\n\nThey plotted the lesser-known New York Tea Party in Fraunces Tavern in 1774.\n\nBy 1775, tensions between the British and the colonists continued to mount in New York.\n\nA group of men tried to steal cannons from the Battery on August 23, 1775, and exchanged fire with the H.M.S. Asia, which was situated in the harbor.\n\nThe Asia pelted the city with cannonballs until 3 am the next morning. One of these 18-pound cannonballs crashed through the roof of Fraunces Tavern.\n\nSamuel Fraunces actually left New York in 1775 for New Jersey, getting out of the way of the oncoming conflict.\n\nFraunces’ Loyalist son-in-law took over the running of the tavern during the time that Fraunces spent in New Jersey. Fraunces returned in 1778.\n\nDuring The American Revolution and Its Aftermath\n\nThe tavern remained open during the British occupation of New York during the Revolution.\n\nThe Royal Governor of New York, Governor Tyron, hosted a diner for 70 distinguished British guests at the tavern in 1780.\n\nAfter the British surrender at York in 1781, the tavern took on a new role. Throughout the war, African-American slaves had left their Patriot masters and gone to fight for the British Crown.\n\nThey were promised freedom in exchange for their service.\n\nGeneral Birch held weekly trials at Fraunces Tavern for these men to come and prove their loyalty and service to the Crown and ensure their freedom and safe passage out of New York.\n\nThe tavern was also used as the headquarters for the American Commissioners while they negotiated with the British for their evacuation from the city.\n\nEvacuation Day came on November 25, 1783, and Governor George Clinton held a celebration at the tavern.\n\nNine days later, on December 4, 1783, George Washington invited the officers of the Continental Army to a dinner in the Long Room at Fraunces Tavern.\n\nWashington used to dinner to retire from public life (before he was unanimously chosen as the first President of the United States.)\n\nGathered with his officers in Fraunces Tavern he said, “With a heart full of love and gratitude, I take leave of you.\n\nI devoutly wish that your latter days may be as happy and prosperous and your former ones have been glorious and honorable.”\n\nFraunces Tavern had seen a lot, but its time wasn’t over. In the early days of the United States, while New York served as its short-lived capitol city, the tavern was home to the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nShortly after leasing space to the new government, Fraunces sold the tavern to a Brooklyn butcher named George Powers so that he could retire to New Jersey.\n\nPowers later also rented space to the Department of War and Department of Finance, making Fraunces Tavern the home of some of our very first government offices.\n\nLike Washington, Fraunces did not get to retire as intended. During the Revolution, he had become acquainted with George Washington.\n\nHe was asked to serve as the Head Steward of Washington’s Presidential household in New York, retiring briefly once the capitol was moved to Philadelphia, and then returning to the President’s service until 1794.\n\nInto the Modern Era…\n\nFraunces Tavern continued on through the years. Though it changed owners several times and became primarily a boarding house in the 1800s, it was always known as Fraunces Tavern and its place in history was not forgotten.\n\nA series of fires forced parts of the tavern to be rebuilt several times until it looked very little like the original structure.\n\nTwo extra floors were added and the roof was changed. On the centennial of George Washington’s Farewell Dinner in 1883, the Sons of the Revolution in the State if New York was founded in the Long Room of Fraunces Tavern.\n\nOn the outside, however, the building continued to change and modernize. A cast iron façade was added and the entrance was changed.\n\nBy 1900, 54 Pearl Street, along with many other older buildings, was facing demolition. The Daughters of the American Revolution fought to save the building, even trying to purchase it.\n\nThe owners refused. The City of New York joined in the effort. On the basis of eminent domain, the city declared the building a park so that they could save it.\n\nOnce they had taken over the property, it was sold to the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York, who own it to this day.\n\nThey have restored the 18th-century appearance as best they could (with no known pictures of the original building to work off of.)\n\nThe modern additions were stripped away and the brick structure underneath was painstakingly restored for a re-opening on December 4, 1907.\n\nToday, the Fraunces Tavern Museum operates on the second and third floors, while a full restaurant and bar is open on the first floor, taking the building back to its colonial roots.\n\nWritten by Katherine Weatherford\n\nRelated Content:\n\nThings to Do in Lower Manhattan\n\nWalk the Brooklyn Bridge\n\nVisit the Statue of Liberty"
