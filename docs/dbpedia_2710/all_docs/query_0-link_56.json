        "text": "Fraunces Tavern is a survivor of the early days of New York City. Located at the corner of Broad and Pearl Street, the building was originally built in 1719 as an elegant residence for the Delancey family and became one of the most popular taverns under the ownership of Samuel Fraunces by the mid-18th century. Though it is best known as the site where Washington bade farewell to the officers of the Continental Army in 1783, the tavern also played a significant role in pre-Revolutionary activities. As Manhattan's oldest surviving building, 54 Pearl Street has witnessed nearly three centuries of the city's history and is now registered as a National Historic Place with the United States National Park Service."
