        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to New York City and feeling a little overwhelmed, rest assured you’re not alone. There are so many things to see, do, and eat that even after reading a 300-page guide book or watching hundreds of YouTube videos, you may still feel like you don’t know where to begin. We’re constantly asked for recommendations when friends and family are heading to New York City. So as a labor of love, we put together a checklist of our favorite things to do in NYC. These are the places we enjoy even as locals, in a city where a million shiny objects are constantly vying for attention. Whether you’re asking “Can I do all these things in one day?” or requesting off-the-beaten-path recommendations, we hope this guide has a little something for everyone.\n\nMuseum Mile is located on Fifth Avenue, from about 82nd Street to 110th Street, which is where you’ll find such stalwart institutions as The Met and the Guggenheim Museum. Across the park, there’s the Museum of Natural History, where the new Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation is the talk of the town. But for something a little off the beaten path, you could try the Frick Collection, which used to be the home of magnate Henry Clay Frick and houses a stunning collection of paintings, sculptures, ceramics and more from the likes of Vermeer, Veronese and El Greco. [Note: The Collection has temporarily relocated to Frick Madison, at the Marcel Breuer-designed building on Madison Avenue while its historic buildings are renovated. The reopening is scheduled for late 2024.]\n\nThe Museum of the City of New York is a criminally overlooked option. It runs interesting exhibits that explore different facets of the city’s past, present and future, allowing you to see more than what lies on the surface. For a museum that doesn’t feel like a museum, check out the hidden gem that is the Society of Illustrators, a tiny space that holds fun exhibits based in the art of illustration. They also hold sketch nights and other fun activities.\n\nPro Tip: Many museums have certain days of the week or month where the admission is free or pay-what-you-wish, so a quick jaunt to their individual websites might save you some cash. Just note that major institutions like MoMA are very crowded during the free hours, so take that into consideration.\n\nCentral Park\n\nCentral Park is huge, and you could either lose several days trying to explore all of it, or pick different pockets to visit. If you could only see one portion of the park, enter at the 65th Street Transverse and walk The Mall up to Bethesda Terrace and Bethesda Fountain. Along The Mall you’ll get to enjoy the Literary Walk, which features statues of famous literary figures. Bethesda Terrace is one of the most beautiful and iconic spots in the park, and is a favorite setting for wedding photo shoots. You'll probably recognize the Angel on the Water statue at Bethesda Fountain from countless movies and television shows.\n\nPro Tip: If you exit through 72nd Street on the west side of the park, you’ll see the Strawberry Fields memorial to John Lennon. You can also pop into the 72nd Street subway station, which features artwork by Yoko Ono. Both are located right by The Dakota, where they both lived.\n\n2nd Avenue Subway\n\nThere are two prominent options in Midtown for views of the city: Top of the Rock and the Empire State Building. Ticket prices for observation decks are pretty steep, so you might want to consider your options. The biggest advantage of Top of the Rock is that you see more of Central Park and have a clear view of the Empire State Building (which you wouldn’t have if you were, say, on the Empire State Building). But the Empire State Building is an icon. Both are tourist attractions, so expect some upselling. However, you can buy tickets for both online to reduce some of the wait. If you’re obsessed with getting the best views, try Top of the Rock during the day--since Central Park is not lit up when it's dark--and the Empire State Building at night so you can see the lights of Times Square.\n\nThe recent years have delivered a spate of new options for anyone hankering for a dramatic skyline view. As we mention in our guide to Chelsea, Hudson Yards has become a destination for art, food and entertainment. Now, you can top your visit off with an unbeatable view of the city. The Edge isn’t the tallest observation deck in the city, that honor still belongs to the One World Observatory. But it’s the tallest open-air option, with angled glass walls that allow you to feel like you’re flying high above the city. And if you want an experience that goes beyond the view, Summit One Vanderbilt creates interactive experiences like mirrored rooms that help you truly enjoy the thrill of being miles above ground.\n\nGrand Central Station\n\nGrand Central Station is one of those spots both tourists and locals love. There are fantastic tours that explore its rich history, but if you just want to take pictures of the beautiful interior, that’s okay too. Don’t miss the Whispering Gallery, where you and a friend can stand at opposite corners of the arches and whisper sweet nothings into the wall. The acoustics are such that the other person can hear you perfectly, despite the distance between you.\n\nGrand Central Madison opened in January 2023 to provide some relief to the overburdened Penn Station. Even if you’re not a commuter, it’s worth popping by to check out the impressive artwork featuring the likes of Yayoi Kusama and Jordan Bruner.\n\nThe Chrysler Building is one of the most recognizable skyscrapers in the New York City skyline, but unlike the Empire State Building you can’t pay for a ticket and ride up to the top. The Art Deco treasure is a private building accessible only by its tenants, but the lobby is open to the public during the week. The entrance is just across the street from Grand Central Station, so it’s worth popping by just to see the amazing deco details like the red Moroccan marble walls, the fluorescent lights placed in a step pattern, the elevator doors with metal and wood veneers, and Edward Trumbull’s ceiling mural named \"Transport and Human Endeavor\".\n\nNew York Public Library’s Stephen A. Schwarzman Building\n\nThe flagship branch of the New York Public Library system is one of our must-see NYC destinations for book lovers. It’s worth a visit just to see this incredible Beaux-Arts landmark, including its iconic feline sentinels, Patience and Fortitude. But there’s also a really nice prelude to your visit that you should definitely take the time to experience: a walk along Library Way. If you approach the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building promenade from the east and walk along 41st Street, you’ll be rewarded with bronze sidewalk plaques with inspirational quotes about reading, writing, and literature.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that there’s much more to see and do at the New York Public Library’s main branch than just snap some pretty pictures of the exterior. Take a free tour and discover such visual delights as the gorgeous murals adorning the ceiling of The Rose Main Reading Room and learn all about the library’s amazing history. In addition, make sure to check the schedule for New York Public Library’s fantastic programs and events, which include talks by noted authors. Just make sure to register and show up early, as many such events are free of charge and first come, first seated.\n\nFor another quirky (and family-friendly!) ideas around Midtown, you could check out the Spy Museum, where you can get your Bond on.\n\nSo what is the High Line, what’s so important about it, and why should you visit it? Very simply, The High Line is an elevated, linear park. It’s a monumental example of grass-roots community mobilization for a cause, where land earmarked for demolition was returned to public use. But the project also inspired cities all around the country to rethink how they utilized obsolete infrastructure. The former defunct elevated railway became a park that stretches nearly two miles in length from Gansevoort St. to West 34th St. between Washington St. and 11th Ave in Manhattan’s West Side. With an easily walkable railway trail, you’ll find lush gardens and impressive public art exhibits.\n\nPro Tip: You can exit the High Line at 17th Street and make your way to Chelsea Market for some food and shopping. Don’t miss Artists & Fleas, which brings a number of local artisans and designers together, as well as New York City staple Pearl River Mart for Asian and Asian-inspired goods.\n\nLittle Island\n\nThe Oculus, for all intents and purposes, is a transportation hub and a shopping mall. But the beautiful design by architect Santiago Calatrava makes it a destination in and of itself. A combination of steel, glass and marble, the white winged structure is meant to resemble a bird being released from a child’s hand.\n\nBesides The Oculus, there are a host of options to explore while you’re here. You can head through the west concourse tunnel to Brookfield Place to enjoy the light-filled atrium and all things French at Le District. Or you can stop by the 9/11 Memorial Plaza to see the twin pools--the largest man-made waterfalls in the country--in the exact spots where the Twin Towers stood. Or you can head to the other Observation Deck option, the One World Observatory at One WTC. One WTC is the tallest of all three options we've mentioned here, and it offers 360-degree views of the city. It’s also the newest, so there are more tech-inspired offerings to enhance your experience.\n\nAmerican History\n\nNew York City has a rich and storied history, and it played a pretty big role in the national landscape too. History lovers can visit Federal Hall, where the first United States Congress met on March 4, 1789 and where George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States. Not too far away, there’s Trinity Church, where Alexander Hamilton is buried. (You might also recognize it from movies The Day After Tomorrow and National Treasure). There are numerous NYC historic landmarks which played a prominent role in the American Revolution.\n\nBesides these highlights, there are also plenty of neighborhoods to explore. You can take a walk along Canal Street then linger in Chinatown afterwards. Or you can visit the Lower East Side, a neighborhood which masterfully mixes the past and present. The South Street Seaport district has become a buzzy hotspot attracting the best names in food and fashion. And there’s always Battery Park, where you can ride in a Seaglass Carousel if the spectacular views start to bore you. The Museum of Illusions and the Museum of Street Art are great indoor options.\n\nAnd if I've done all that already?\n\nBefore relocating to the area, we made trips annually--sometimes twice or three times a year--and never ran out of things to see, do and eat in New York City. But if you find all these ideas boring or a touch too touristy (not a bad word in our books), then here are some other things to consider:\n\nVenture into the outer boroughs\n\nLet’s be honest, the question we are most often asked by our friends and family is: Where should we eat? And they ask for good reason, too, because if there’s one thing you should know about us, it’s that we love to eat. We could send you to Hell’s Kitchen, which has an incredibly high concentration of eateries. But what we’ve decided to do here is provide a map of some of the cafes, restaurants, and bakeries that we love to visit. It’s absolutely not a comprehensive list by any means. Take, for instance, the fact that you won’t find a bunch of Michelin-starred establishments, though there are plenty at your disposal in New York City. Nor will you find every trendy spot in the city with a current wait time of 3 hours and line snaking around the corner. What you will find are places we enjoy regularly.\n\nOurs is a penchant for New York City institutions, as well as lesser known neighborhood gems. Most of them have reasonable prices and reasonable wait times (by New York City standards, at least, if at all). The goal, originally, was to include around 50 restaurants and cafes, but we quickly decided we would be remiss not to mention some dessert options as well. In the end, we’ve decided to field a list of 55 total establishments. You’ll find everything from quick grab-and-go breakfast sandwiches to dinner where a former president dined, and plenty in between. And, of course, if you have a sweet tooth, we have you covered there as well.\n\nYour New York City\n\nNow, there will undoubtedly be locals and visitors alike that will disagree with some of our choices. Maybe you hate museums. Or perhaps you don’t really care about food or coffee (register our collective horror at such a statement). New Yorkers, in particular, are renowned for their disagreements about things like where to get the best slice in the city, who makes the best bagel and which borough is king. And let’s face it, they can occasionally be snobbish or territorial. But the fact that the city can afford pleasures to any taste on the spectrum is what makes it special. The real beauty of The City That Never Sleeps is that it offers you the opportunity to find your New York City. So go forth and conquer!\n\nLike it? Pin it!"
