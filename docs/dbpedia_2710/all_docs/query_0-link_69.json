        "meta_description": "Fraunces Tavern Museum, 54 Pearl St, Manhattan, NYC   See their website:  http://frauncestavernmuseum.org/  Perhaps best known as the place where General Washington bade an emotional farewell to his officers at the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, this tavern played a part in the Arnold story. The proprietor, Samuel Fraunces, overheard British officers in the tavern (during the years of occupation) toasting Benedict Arnold, who was to turn West Point over to the British. He told New Jersey farm wife Jane Tues, who carried produce into the city to sell. She told her brother, who alerted Gen. Anthony Wayne, who took him to Gen. Washington. The suspicion cast on Arnold was confirmed just a few days later when Major Andre was arrested.",
