        "text": "What is it? Thanks to its strategic position in the middle of New York Harbor, Governors Island was a military outpost and off-limits to the public for 200 years, but now it's a verdant public park.\n\nWhy go? It's open year-round with fun activities for every season. The island provides a peaceful setting for cycling (bring a bike on the ferry, or rent from once there). The island hosts a program of events, such as concert series and art exhibitions (see the park's website for schedule), and where else can you have a picnic directly across from the Statue of Liberty?\n\nOur take: \"I love Governors Island because I haven’t had a backyard in over a decade. It fills that necessary need for safe, wide open, green space and gives me a chance to cycle, play and relax with friends without leaving the city.\" — Editor Shaye Weaver\n\nWhat is it? Oh, Mary!, which our theater critic calls \"the funniest Broadway play in years.\"\n\nWhy go? Cole Escola’s Oh, Mary! is not just funny: It is dizzyingly, breathtakingly funny, the kind of funny that ambushes your body into uncontained laughter. In this hilariously anachronistic historical burlesque, Escola plays—who else?—Mary Todd Lincoln, in the weeks leading up to her husband’s assassination.\n\nOur take: I can’t remember the last time I saw a play that made me laugh, helplessly and loudly, as much as Oh, Mary! did—and my reaction was shared by the rest of the audience, which burst into applause at the end of every scene. — Theater Editor Adam Feldman\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?

Apart from picturesque views of Manhattan and Queens, island offers art shows, a beautiful park, and historic sites.\n\nWhy go? Be sure to book a reservation for drinks at The Panorama Room, a rooftop bar atop the hotel Graduate New York with unmatched views. There's even an outdoor area, which is perfect for photos at sunset. Make a staycation out of it and stay the night.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A new exhibit, titled Lost New York, at New-York Historical Society.\n\nWhy go? It transports viewers to a time when pigs roamed the streets, shopping was a radical act, and New Yorkers used to brave polluted waters for a swim. The exhibition also documents long-gone landmarks like the original Penn Station, Met Opera House, Chinese Theater, and Croton Reservoir.\n\nDon't miss: More than 90 paintings, photographs, objects, and lithographs combine to tell the story of the city’s history and the importance of preserving pieces of our otherwise vanishing past.\n\nOur take: The exhibit includes quotes from real New Yorkers, which helped me feel connected to this fascinating history. — Things to Do Editor Rossilynne Culgan\n\nWhat is it? A beloved pizza shop with locations in Williamsburg and the West Village.\n\nWhy go? Considered by many to be one of the best places to get pizza in NYC, L'Industrie was established by owner Massimo Laveglia, a Tuscany native, in Williamsburg back in 2017. And people have been lining up for slices ever since.\n\nOur take: L'Industrie has the perfect slice—the hot pizza and cold burrata combo is delicious every single time. I also love the dedication the owner has to creating a place that has character, which is evident the second you walk into either location. — Sarah Iandoli, social media editor\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?

Expect a gigantic showcase of some of the coolest, newest, and most provocative art at a big New York City museum.\n\nWhy go?

This year, the Biennial is themed “Even Better Than The Real Thing” and features the work of 71 artists and collectives.\n\nOur take: The Whitney Biennial never disappoints, but this year, I got to see some of the boldest art I’ve seen in awhile; some of it that changed over time and at different perspectives—which feels quite timely. — Editor Shaye Weaver\n\nWhat is it? A Mexican-American bar in the East Village. It's a certified good time, and we aren't just saying that because of the name.\n\nWhy go? In just one year of business, Superbueno nabbed a number two spot onWorld’s Best 50 Bars North America list. And it's no surprise with Ignacio “Nacho” Jimenez behind the bar, stirring up tajin-flecked martinis and negronis infused with a kick of mole.\n\nOur take: \"Come for the cocktails, but stay for the vibe, with DJ tunes spinning all night long.\" — Food & Drink Editor Morgan Carter\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?

Each intro class includes a chance to learn about different parts of the bow and safety requirements. After the lesson, you'll get a chance to shoot the bow trying to pop a balloon pinned onto the bullseye.\n\nOur take: This is the closest I've ever felt to being like Katniss Everdeen.

And in the bathroom, a surprise DJ spins a soundtrack for patrons to dance to as they wash their hands, a cheeky setup Kataria calls, “Club Flush.”\n\nWhat is it? The Broadway adaptation of Sara Gruen’s 2006 romance novel of the same name, which operates on the level of a fairy tale.\n\nWhy go? Although Water for Elephants is set at a circus, and includes several moments of thrilling spectacle, what makes it so appealing is its modesty, not glitz.\n\nDon't miss: Where Water for Elephants soars is in the real-life physical talents on display. Members of the ensemble perform impressive aerial routines on ropes, silks, hoops and straps, and show off a dazzling variety of skills: acrobatics, tumbling, balancing, juggling, Cyr Wheel.\n\nOur take: \"Step right up, come one, come all, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, step right up to the greatest—well, okay, not the greatest show on Broadway, but a dang fine show nonetheless.\" — Theater Editor Adam Feldman\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?

A Mexican-style taqueria in Greenpoint from Tania Apolinar and Giovanni Cervantes.\n\nWhy go? The venue's usage of a choricera, a round-shaped pot used in Mexico that is shallow in the middle and deep on the sides. In this vessel alone, longaniza bubbles next to tripe. The suadero, one of Mexico’s most popular cuts, also takes a dip, cooked in fat for three hours before it's chopped up.\n\nOur take: \"While lingering inside to eat is possible (there are only a handful of seats), standing outside with the rest of Brooklyn over a few tortillas feels just right.\" — Food & Drink Editor Morgan Carter\n\nWhat is it? Untable, a new restaurant in Carroll Gardens, calls itself an \"unconventional\" Thai restaurant.\n\nWhy go?

The pizzeria's chef, Anthony Mangieri, first started wood-firing pizzas in New Jersey in 1996, so he's definitely a pro.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Auditory art by the late artist Max Neuhaus. The installation called \"Times Square\" sounds like the echo of a bell ringing. It's hard to place this droning tone among all the other noises there, especially because the sound emanates from a typical grate right beneath your feet.\n\nWhy go? It's a revolutionary art project that's been a part of the city for decades but most people step right over it.\n\nDon't miss: This art! Head to the Broadway Pedestrian Plaza between 45th and 46th Streets (between Broadway and Seventh Avenue) and listen.

There’s also something cathartic about the ferry ride back to the city after a relaxing day. — Ian Kumamoto, staff writer\n\nWhat is it?
