        "text": "Aly & AJ are all grown up, and you can hear it in their music.\n\nNot that they didn't always pour their hearts into singing, but now, \"We've actually experienced a lot of things that we've written about,\" AJ Michalka told E! News in a recent interview from Denver, where she and big sister Aly Michalka were busy working on new material in between coffee and snack breaks.\n\nReally healthy snack breaks, thanks to co-writer Jorge Elbrecht, who apparently prefers to stay fueled with bee pollen and kale chips. \"Everything's delicious,\" noted AJ, short for Amanda Joy. \"Lots of matcha.\" Added Aly, \"I mean, it's good, it forces us to not be eating like junk. But yeah, I'm like, 'Where's the chips? Where's the popcorn?'\"\n\nYet the inspiration has flowed all the same, the duo having tapped a wellspring of experience that simply wasn't there yet when, in between acting jobs, they started recording in their teens.\n\nThey worked with a number of writers, including Elbrecht, for their fourth studio album, A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun, which dropped in May—almost 14 years after the release of their last album—to strong reviews.\n\nAnd before they embark on their A Touch of the Beat Tour of the U.S. and Europe in 2022, they'll enjoy a return to performing in front of a massive audiences on the main stage at Lollapalooza, which returns July 29 to Chicago's Grant Park after last year's festival was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen the lineup was announced, \"I think we were the only artist trending, which is hilarious,\" A.J. said, acknowledging that the last time they commanded such a perch, \"trending\" on Twitter wasn't really a thing yet.\n\nE!: You mentioned earlier that obviously your tastes have changed. Who do you guys love now that are inspiring you?\n\nAJ: People like Saint Vincent and the lead singer of Wolf Alice [Ellie Rowsell]. I love Angel Olsen, I love Haim. There are some women that are really making great music. And Aly and I are also really inspired by male-lead rock bands, My Morning Jacket, War on Drugs, The National, Ray LaMontagne. And that was all music that we just weren't listening to back when we were younger because, A: Some of those people hadn't even really come out yet, and also like, we just weren't savvy to that kind of music. Growing up, it's so interesting once you leave the nest, you get introduced to a whole new world of sounds that you weren't introduced to when you were a kid.\n\nAly: And that's in response to what your friends are listening to, or who you're dating or even just the producer that you're working with who's like, 'You should check out this band.' So I think our tastes change a lot just because of that. And then there's obviously the bands that we always enjoy listening to that were on in our house, whether that's like listening to a Heart record or Fleetwood Mac, or The Police.\n\nAly: A younger generation. They probably didn't know who we were, or maybe they did from a sibling, but, like, were newly introduced?\n\nAJ: But a lot of people thought it was a new song, too.\n\nAly: It's hilarious.\n\nAJ: It's crazy when it's 14 years old and we ended up basically just saying, 'Well, let's embrace this moment and let's re-record it, and just completely redo the vocals and remaster it and remix it. And I think the song is actually better now, truly. But that moment was bizarre, I mean that was the end of last year.\n\nAly: And we had already kind of been in the mix of putting out new music. We just dropped, I think, \"Slow Dancing\" at that point and it really started to have this momentum. I mean, it was a great coincidence. You probably couldn't have planned it better.\n\nAJ: Friends just started sending us viral videos on TikTok of people using \"Potential Breakup Song\" as their main song. And weeks went by where this was happening and it wasn't stopping, and we were like, \"This is wild.\"\n\nAM: We were like, \"This is really weird. Why is it this song and why is it happening now?\" And maybe it was a mixture of the pandemic, people wanting to feel nostalgic in some way. But it was a happy accident. It was.\n\nAJ: It was and I think it only kind of informed people that Aly & AJ are back and they're making new music, you know? I think it just kind of helped move everyone to the new direction.\n\nSo you're like, Well, I guess there is power behind the fact that we've been doing this for this-many years, and there is a certain level of importance behind the Aly & AJ brand. So that was a terrible idea and we just said, forget it, let's go back down to Aly and AJ. I just remember it being not our best moment in terms of our self-confidence as artists. We were still writing with people we really cared about and really respected, and I think it was important for us to make that record to get to the records that we make now. It also just showed us that the partnerships that we make with our producer are very important. And I think that that was a perfect example of working with a producer that we really respected and very much looked up to, but we also let him take control of the project in a way that then got away from us.\n\nAJ: And then you listen to the record and you go, \"Well, yeah, my sister was kind of right. Like, this doesn't really fit. \"\n\nAly: Yeah, I think as we've gotten older, I think we've gotten more forgiving on that. Whereas I think when we were younger, we were a little bit more hard-headed like, \"No, this is the lyric,\" and we're just ready to die on the spot for it. But now we're not nearly as precious about it. And then I think when we do feel really strongly, then that's taken very seriously because it really shows that you really, actually, truly care about that.\n\nE!: Disney is very much part of where you guys came up from. How do you feel your experiences have been different from others like Miley or Demi or Selena?\n\nAJ: It's weird because everyone went off and did their own thing like, we truly don't know any of those people anymore. As kids we all kind of knew each other. But, as adults, not really. And I'm looking forward to Lollapalooza because we get to open for Miley, and I haven't seen, we haven't seen her in years, and I'm excited to just congratulate her on the new music and I really think she's found her sound. Other people like Demi and Selena we never even really got to know. But it's interesting. How are we different?\n\nAly: I think we didn't have the global success of those artists, not nearly. So I think that our journey was just different in that way.\n\nAJ: We also took a really big break and everyone else kept just chugging along.\n\nAly: Yeah, judging you or even putting you up on a pedestal because you're an item to them or whatever.\n\nAJ: The one thing we all do have in common is nothing any of us did at such a young age is really normal. Like Aly said, we were really young in an adult world and it's not really normal to be, even though we all loved it and we were like, \"This is exciting.\" If I have kids in the next 10, 15 years, I probably would tell them this isn't something you should do until you're like 18 or 19. Because it's really kind of bizarre and you do have to grow up really fast and you're protected as much as possible by your parents, but it's a very weird world to be in at such a young age.\n\nAly: And I think some people handle it better than others because of the parents they have, the support system they have, the management they have. I think it helped that we had each other. That we were like this duo together and then we had another sibling that was in the industry at the exact same time going through it. I think that, if anything, that was like our superpower.\n\n(This conversation was edited for length and clarity.)\n\nA Touch of the Beat... is on sale now. Aly & AJ will be performing on the main stage at Lollapalooza on Thursday, July 29."
