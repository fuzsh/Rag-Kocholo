        "text": "When Aly Michalka of the hit pop group Aly & AJ found out she was pregnant with her first baby, she knew she had to tell her sister AJ Michalka in a special way. But first, she had to get through a concert!\n\nThe “Potential Breakup Song” singer opened up about the heartwarming way she broke the baby news to her sister in a new interview with PEOPLE, and it is so sweet.\n\nSister Love\n\nIt all started when she took a pregnancy test the morning of a sold-out concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles back in September. “In another world I could have waited to take a test another day, but for whatever reason I was like, ‘I’m past a week being late, and I should just take the test,'” she told the outlet. The test was positive — and she had to keep it to herself. “And then it was just like, ‘Oh my gosh. We play this huge show tonight, and now I’m holding in this huge secret,’” she explained, adding that she told her husband Stephen Ringer but didn’t want to distract her sister from the show.\n\n“I didn’t want [the pregnancy] to take away from the special meaning of that night, and we already had so much on our minds that we were juggling,” the iZombie star told PEOPLE.\n\nA few days after the concert, Aly planned a special way to tell her sister. (BTW, we love how she put so much thought into this, but just casually told her husband. It really proves how close these two are!) She took AJ out to dinner at Pace in L.A. and let her in on the secret.\n\n“I was like, ‘There was a special guest that was at the Greek that you didn’t know was there,’ and she was like, ‘Who?'” Aly recalled the conversation going. “I was like, ‘There’s a baby,’ and I touched my stomach, and then she was like, ‘What?!’ She was just really excited and overjoyed. From there, we told the rest of the family.”\n\nI’m crying! As someone with two amazing sisters, I also remember being super excited to tell them about my pregnancies. There’s just something about a sister bond that is so special and unique, and it’s awesome to see that theirs goes beyond the band and extends into real life, too.\n\nPregnancy Update\n\nThe former Disney Channel actress announced her pregnancy on Instagram as well, as part of her partnership with Natalist, which makes pregnancy tests and a belly oil. “Our little one has been on stage with me across three states already and has even done some international traveling!” Aly quipped in her caption.\n\nThe actress and singer, who is due in May, shared that she is waiting until the birth to find out her baby’s sex. “We’re waiting to find out the gender cuz I’ve always loved a good surprise, but in the meantime we’ve been busy getting the nursery ready, meeting with my birth team, eating more protein than usual, going to Pilates, getting good sleep, and drinking lots of water,” she wrote on Instagram. Aly continued, “Somehow we’ve been able to still spend days in the studio writing music which hopefully finds its way into baby’s soul. I’m so grateful for all the amazing women I’ve leaned on these past 6 months (you know who you are) it makes me hopeful about the goodness in the world 💜”\n\nShe also shared some of her hopes for the future, including teaching her baby to have a well-rounded diet (“we cannot just do chicken fingers and plain hamburgers”) and being “thoughtful and kind.”\n\n“[We want to teach them] they do have some privilege, obviously, growing up in Los Angeles with two white parents,” she told PEOPLE. “I think putting that as a topic to talk about with your kid early on is really important because then they’ll be empathetic toward all kinds of people in their future.”\n\nCouldn’t agree more!\n\nSweet Bond\n\nAly has been married to her filmmaker husband since 2015. Meanwhile, AJ has been dating actor Josh Pence since 2017. In a March 2023 interview with E! News, the “With Love From” singers opened up about their sweet relationship.\n\n“We finish each other’s sentences,” Aly told the outlet. “It’s unlike any other friendship [or] relationship you have in your life. A sibling is very sacred.”\n\nShe continued, “The fact that we were able share this space together for so many years and to have each other to lean on, to support each other, makes the ride so much better. We always talk about how we wouldn’t be interested in doing this if we were solo artists.”\n\nWe bet AJ is going to be the best aunt to Aly’s baby!"
