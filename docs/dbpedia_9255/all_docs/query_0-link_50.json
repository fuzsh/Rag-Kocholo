        "text": "It took too long, it took too long, it took too long for them to come back.\n\nA decade since releasing Disney Channel hits including Potential Breakup Song (which is referenced above), Aly and AJ Michalka are back with an ‘80s-feeling EP that’s pop perfection. USA TODAY can exclusively share Aly & AJ’s Ten Years, here in a YouTube playlist.\n\nThe four new songs — two of which have been released previously — have a synth sound inspired by Peter Gabriel, Depeche Mode and Duran Duran. Yes, that’s a departure for the ladies, who spent the last few years focusing on acting (iZombie for Aly; The Goldbergs for AJ, among other projects).\n\nThe EP is “a palate cleanser for people to adjust to the new music, because it’s different from anything we’ve ever released,” says AJ, 26. She and sister Aly, 28, self-funded the music and are looking to release a full record next year with a major label.\n\nThey’d also love to show off their new sound in a live setting by perhaps touring with another band. How about with another family band with a nostalgic sound, HAIM?\n\n“I kind of love that idea,” says Aly. “Sister empowerment!”\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the four new songs, according to Aly & AJ:\n\n1. Take Me\n\nThe first catchy single is “an ode to everyone that has been gun-shy about meeting someone in person” for a date, says AJ, who’s single. Aly is married.\n\n2. I Know\n\nIt’s a groovy tune “about friendship (and) being there with someone when they need you most,” says Aly about their second single.\n\n3. Promises\n\nThis is a dreamy ditty about the fear that someone’s cheating on you; that you’re not “the only one that’s being loved by that person,” says AJ.\n\n4. The Distance\n\nIt’s a song you can dance to about “the distance you feel in a relationship that isn’t working anymore,” says Aly."
