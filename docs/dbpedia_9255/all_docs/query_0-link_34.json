        "text": "Holy nostalgic flashback, Batman! Aly and AJ Michalka, the actor-musician sister duo known for dominating Radio Disney in the late aughts (they‚Äôve also released some very good music since then), just sent us straight back to our tweens by wearing none other than iconic mall brand Limited Too.\n\nYeah, Limited Too is back. Again. Kind of. The current offerings seem to be super limited (no pun intended), but as ever, the name recognition has investors trying to capitalize, and the rights to the name have reverted back to the original‚Ä¶something? Listen, I don‚Äôt know business, but what I can tell you is that their new stuff is very athletic preppy and not glow in the dark glittery, but one can hope that‚Äôs coming in the future.\n\nAly, star of the iconic Phil of the Future and a new mom, took a mirror selfie in an ‚ÄúLTD TOO‚Äù quarter-zip captioned ‚ÄúCool Moms wear @limitedtoo #iykyk,‚Äù and while it looks totally comfy, what‚Äôs way more exciting is the pattern on her phone case. Do you recognize that flower? If you do, it may be time for retinol (it‚Äôs a variation on the Limited Too logo). That flower was the millennial aesthetic before people started overusing the word aesthetic.\n\nHer sister AJ also got a sweatshirt‚Äîa pullover crewneck‚Äîand thankfully, blessedly, it has rhinestones. ‚ÄúCool aunties wear @limitedtoo ü©µ,‚Äù she wrote under her sunset-soaked selfie. Rhinestones!"
