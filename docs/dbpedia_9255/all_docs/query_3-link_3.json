        "text": "Aly & AJ released a deluxe version of A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun in 2022. Here’s what we know about the meaning behind this extra-long album title, as explained by Aly Michalka.\n\nAly & AJ debuted their album ‘A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun’\n\nThe sister duo of Aly and AJ Michalka has come a long way from their Disney days. In 2019, they released their Sanctuary EP. In 2020, these artists released an explicit version of “Potential Breakup Song,” the 2007 hit popularized by Disney Channel.\n\nAfter months of anticipation, the artists debuted A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun, the 2021 album featuring a refreshed sound and exciting new songs.\n\nWhere does the ‘A Touch of the Beat’ album name come from?\n\nAlthough the title of this album is wordy, it still holds special meaning for Aly & AJ and their fans. The most apparent connection to this title is the lyrics to “Don’t Mean Nothing.” The artists also elaborated on the lofty album title during an interview with Good Morning America.\n\n“We actually came up with the title while we were making the record,” Aly Michalka said. “We were in the lunch break area of sunset sound, which is an iconic studio here in Los Angeles, and it derives from a song off of the record called ‘don’t mean nothing.’”\n\nBased in California, that summer-inspired sound is showcased on A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun. One of the most popular songs from that album, “Slow Dancing,” earned over 11 million Spotify plays.\n\nWill Aly & AJ release another album in 2022?\n\nThe most recently released single by Aly & AJ was “Dead on the Beach,” featuring the American actor Josh Pence as a vocalist. Since its debut, this track earned over 250 thousand Spotify plays, with some fans sharing their excitement at the new music potentially debuting.\n\nIn 2022, the artists released a deluxe version of A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun. That premiered on Feb. 11, 2022, several months after the original album dropped. This deluxe album includes tracks “Am I Alright” and “Way Way Back,” as well as the 2021 single “Get Over Here.”"
