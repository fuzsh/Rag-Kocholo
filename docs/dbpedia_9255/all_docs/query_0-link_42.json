The Aly & AJ musician and actress is expecting her first child with her filmmaker husband, Stephen Ringer, whom she's been married to since 2015.\n\nThe iZombie alum took to social media to share the news with her followers on Instagram, posting several photos of her journey since discovering her pregnancy, including a sweet photo of her cradling her baby bump.\n\n\"We found out the morning of our sold-out show at The Greek Theatre back in September. Our little one has been on stage with me across three states already and has even done some international traveling,\" Aly began her caption, referring to her and sister AJ Michalka performing a sold-out concert at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last fall.\n\nThe former Disney Channel star thanks her go-to brand, Natalist, which she's currently partnering with, before opening up about why she and Stephen are waiting to find out the sex of their unborn baby.\n\n\"We're waiting to find out the gender cuz I've always loved a good surprise, but in the meantime we've been busy getting the nursery ready, meeting with my birth team, eating more protein than usual, going to Pilates, getting good sleep, and drinking lots of water,\" Aly wrote. \"Somehow we've been able to still spend days in the studio writing music which hopefully finds its way into baby's soul. I'm so grateful for all the amazing women I've leaned on these past 6 months (you know who you are) it makes me hopeful about the goodness in the world üíú.\"\n\nThe singer shares more details on her \"really easy\" pregnancy with People in an article published on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was nice that it ended up happening quickly,\" the singer says, explaining that she originally wanted to wait until she wrapped up her With Love From Aly & AJ tour to start family planning. \"But also I think that took us by surprise in a way where we were like, 'Oh, we thought that maybe this would take us eight, nine months to get pregnant or a year,' and it didn't.\"\n\nWhile Aly told Stephen immediately, she waited to tell her sister until after the concert because she didn't want to \"take away from the special meaning of that night.\"\n\nShe recalls taking AJ out to dinner a few days after the show, saying, \"I was like, 'There was a special guest that was at the Greek that you didn't know was there,' and she was like, 'Who?' I was like, 'There's a baby,' and I touched my stomach, and then she was like, 'What?!' She was just really excited and overjoyed. From there, we told the rest of the family.\"\n\nThe mother-to-be says she wants to make sure her child learns to have a \"thoughtful and kind\" outlook toward others.\n\n\"[We want to teach them] they do have some privilege, obviously, growing up in Los Angeles with two white parents. I think putting that as a topic to talk about with your kid early on is really important,\" she says, \"because then they'll be empathetic toward all kinds of people in their future.\"\n\nAnd as far as baby names go, Aly and Stephen are looking for something \"unique\" but not too outlandish.\n\n\"We want the name to feel unique, but I also don't want people to roll their eyes, like, 'This is such a celebrity kid name. This is so ridiculous,'\" she admits. \"So I'm like, let's just stick with a cool classic name, maybe something that sounds like an author or a writer or a musician.\"\n\nCongratulations to the growing family!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nAly & AJ Talk Touring With Ben Platt and 'Phil of the Future' Reboot\n\nWhy Aly & AJ Gave 'Potential Breakup Song' an Explicit 'Makeover'\n\nAly & AJ on Return to Music and Figuring Out the Balance With Acting (Exclusive)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Aly & AJ Talk First Single in 10 Years 'Take Me' and Dish on New Music"
