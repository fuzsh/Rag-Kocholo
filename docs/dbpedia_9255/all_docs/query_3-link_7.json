        "text": "The sprawling title of Aly & AJ’s latest album also functions as its mission statement: A Touch of the Beat Gets You up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun.\n\n“Aly and I wanted to capture and bottle up that West Coast energy of the music we loved growing up,” AJ Michalka told Vogue over a recent Zoom call. “We wanted to translate how California makes you feel into this record, and I feel like we accomplished that.”\n\nThe two sisters grew up in California and currently live “four minutes away from each other” in Laurel Canyon, the mythic L.A. neighborhood where artists like Joni Mitchell and the Byrds once flourished. You can hear their influence on A Touch of the Beat, the duo’s most dynamic collection of songs to date and the perfect album to usher listeners into the summer.\n\nAly & AJ were originally signed to Hollywood Records under Disney Music Group in the early aughts. They found success penning tween-friendly hits like “Potential Breakup Song,” which, while earning them a devoted fan base, never completely spoke to their artistic intentions. It wasn’t until the sisters started self-releasing singles as “a little experiment” in 2017 that they started coming into their own musicianship.\n\n“We made our last record [2007’s Insomniatic] when we were much younger,” says Aly Michalka. “Those songs were very special to us at the time, but it feels good to be making music as a more fully formed person. At the end of the day we’re adult women now, and we’ve grown a lot together and separately.”\n\nPreceded by a set of ’80s-inspired EPs—Ten Years and Sanctuary—Aly & AJ’s new album is more rooted in songwriting than production. It’s a quieter and more thoughtful listen, a pop-rock stunner unlike anything the duo have ever put out. The fluttery “Pretty Places” has a melody so timeless it could’ve been plucked from any given era while the synth-heavy “Listen!!!” roars to life like a lost U2 song. Featuring 12 tracks brimming with sisterly harmonies, A Touch of the Beat often sounds like the album Aly & AJ were born to make.\n\n“Aly and I figured out so many things about ourselves making this record,” AJ says. “We leaned into the alternative-rock shades of our music that we’ve always wanted to embrace but weren’t quite brave enough to.”\n\nWith A Touch of the Beat available now, Vogue caught up with the sisters to discuss making their latest record, working with Nancy Wilson, and being independent artists.\n\nVogue: Up until recent years you two were on hiatus from music and mostly focused on acting. Was the plan always to eventually make another album?\n\nAJ Michalka: I think deep down we always knew we’d want to get back into music. For a while I thought Insomniatic might be it, but we never stopped working on music. We just didn’t have a plan in place.\n\nAly Michalka: It was a matter of seeing if there was still a fan base out there. The response to Ten Years reassured us that we could get back on the road and keep writing music. An EP is kind of the perfect holdover project if you can’t make a full record. After Sanctuary we looked at each other and said, “We can’t keep making EPs the rest of our lives.” I think we would’ve made an album if we had the time but I was busy with iZombie and AJ had Schooled.\n\nHow long have you been working on the new material?\n\nAly: When it comes out it’ll have been a year and nine months in the making. Pretty much every song that ended up on the album was written well before the pandemic hit. There was one called “Stomach” that we created from the ground up over a two-hour Zoom session.\n\nAJ: Aly and I chose 12 songs that told a cohesive story. We have more that didn’t make this record so I think we’re definitely gonna be releasing some down the line. But this album felt very completed by the 12.\n\nAly: We recorded at Sunset Sound with our producer Yves [Rothman] and a group of five musicians. That’s the place where artists like Fleetwood Mac and Heart and Prince made some of our favorite records. When you’re in that studio there’s an energy that comes through in the recording that we wouldn’t have had if we’d made it anywhere else.\n\nYou’ve worked with a handful of producers the past few years—what about Yves’s process made him the right choice for this project?\n\nAly: He just had this vision. He was behind the board letting the musicians have their freedom while at the same time honoring our songs the way they were written.\n\nAJ: We worked with him on the Sanctuary EP under a very different style. During that time he had this discussion with Aly and I where he said, “I really see you guys making an Americana record that has a really organic, live feeling.” We talked about focusing on the songwriting and bringing in top-notch musicians to make something that would sound timeless.\n\nAly: We realized that we didn’t have to be all slick and made-over like we’d been in the past. We don’t really wear a lot of makeup and usually wear jeans with T-shirts and beat-up boots. AJ and I wanted to just start looking the way we would if you ran into us on the street.\n\nWere there times where you felt pressured to present yourselves otherwise?\n\nAly: There was a little bit of pressure because we thought people expected a certain image from us. There was an expectation to have hair and makeup teams, a wardrobe stylist, and all these things that get deemed “pop star necessities.” But then we thought about all the people we looked up to and realized they wore whatever the fuck they wanted. Mick Jagger and Janis Joplin didn’t have stylists!\n\nAJ: The process of making this record unraveled everything we were taught in terms of what one needs to be a pop star. We stripped everything back so it wasn’t necessarily about how we looked. Now it’s how does the music make us feel? How’s it gonna sound live? That’s become the most important part for us, not who’s the best hair and makeup team.\n\nYou two did a recent Instagram Q&A where you referred to A Touch of the Beat as a “coming-of-age record.” Can you elaborate?\n\nAJ: I kind of call it our first record because it really does feel like the start of a new chapter for Aly & AJ. Plus I feel like there’s a “coming-of-age” element to the storytelling. Aly and I were still figuring out where we wanted to go when we made Ten Years and Sanctuary. And I love those EPs—they got us where we are now and made us more confident songwriters. But we couldn’t have written these songs just a few years ago. I think a lot of that has to do with the collaborators we work with, but it’s also because Aly and I are grown women now.\n\nWhat are your personal favorite songs on the record?\n\nAly: When I think of the record, I think of three songs that tether it together: “Pretty Places,” “Hold On,” and “Don’t Need Nothing.” I’m pretty sure AJ feels the same.\n\nAJ: Literally the same. “Don’t Need Nothing” just sums up the album perfectly. It’s the reason we named it A Touch of the Beat Gets You up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun. We’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel so our goal is to inspire people to get back out into life again.\n\nAly: The title came from the chorus lyric and sort of set the tone for all of the other songs that followed. We wrote “Don’t Need Nothing” in December of 2019 and it was one of the three or four songs we realized formed the beginning of a record. That was the one that led the pack as far as what we wanted to say musically. “Pretty Places” was an old song that we’ve had in our repertoire for years. We knew it was special when we wrote it but it didn’t fit in the Ten Years era. We held on to it and eventually did a huge rewrite of the lyrics, but the bones of the melody pretty much stayed intact. “Hold Out” is very personal to Aly and me. So much of that song is about allowing yourself to ask for help during times that feel hopeless. It speaks to our mental health struggles over the years but also the stories our fans have told us about how our music has helped them throughout their lives.\n\nI noticed that Nancy Wilson [of Heart] and Melissa Etheridge both have credits on the record. How’d they get involved?\n\nAly: Getting both of them felt like a kismet miracle.\n\nAJ: We had a list of iconic women that we really wanted to work with, and Melissa and Nancy were at the top. We thought Melissa’s style made so much sense for “Hold Out,” so we asked her to lend her guitar skills. We’re huge fans but didn’t know her personally so this was a connection through management—which sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t. We thought it’d be amazing if she sang too, but we gave her the liberty to just contribute whatever felt right. She ended up sending back this incredible guitar part that completely transformed the song.\n\nAJ: And we’ve been friends with Nancy for a while now. We wrote a ton of songs with her 10 years ago that just never came out for one reason or another. She’s always been such a pillar of support for Aly and me. She and her sister really solidified who they were as women in the rock industry at a time when it was dominated by men. I think she’s seen the connection that Aly and I have as sisters and feels it’s like a direct correlation to her relationship with Ann. We sent her three songs from A Touch of the Beat and she really responded to “Listen!!!” She ended up playing guitar and harmonizing with us on the chorus. We weren’t sure how it would sound with Aly and me but it ended up working really well. She said, “I love this song, I just hope it really comes out!”\n\nAly: We kept telling her, “Don’t worry! We’re actually releasing music this time!”\n\nWhat can you tell me about navigating this phase of your careers as independent artists versus the experience of having a major label behind you?\n\nAly: It’s been a major learning experience. We were definitely involved in the musical processes at a young age because we were writing our own songs, but we were still just 14 and 16, so we only knew so much. Now we’re looking over budgets for equipment, seeing what goes into producing music videos, analyzing streaming revenue. It adds more stress because we’re in the loop on every detail but it also ensures nothing slips through the cracks. It’s great to have a huge corporation behind you as far as the financial support. The politics of being at a major label also help you in the streaming world because that’s our new form of radio. But they can also take away some of your artistry.\n\nAJ: I think the learning curve really started when we made the Ten Years EP. We owned our masters and we started understanding what that really means for an artist.\n\nAly: I hope that record companies get to a place where they understand the importance of an artist needing to own their voice—or at least get to a point where an artist doesn’t feel like they’re negotiating their life away in order to put out music. AJ and I have come a long way and it feels really empowering to know our business and the kind of music we want to make in the future.\n\nAJ: We’re at a place where we have control over our careers more than we ever have before. We’re at the helm for the first time.\n\nAly: And it feels really, really fucking good.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity."
