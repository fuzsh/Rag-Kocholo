AJ Michalka is to play a recurring role on The CW's cheerleading drama Hellcats.

Zap2it reports that the actress, the younger sister of series star Alyson Michalka (Marti Perkins), will make her debut appearance in the second half of the show's first season.

The Secretariat star will apparently play a girl who works at a local record store and befriends Marti. A CW source has confirmed that a musical performance between the pair, who front real-life band 78violet, is "very likely".

"AJ is so excited about [appearing on] the show," said Alyson Michalka. "She's sad that I'm in Vancouver [filming] so I'm away a lot, but we still talk every day and we're still always working on our music together."

She added: "One of the major differences between myself and Marti is that her relationship with her family is really volatile and can be sort of toxic, but I've always been incredibly blessed when it comes to my family."

Hellcats continues on Wednesdays at 9/8c on The CW.
