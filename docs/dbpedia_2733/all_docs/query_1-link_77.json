        "text": "Lovely BBC Christmas graphics open this tape.\n\nWe’re straight into the movie. And what a movie. Educating Rita is Lewis Gilbert’s film of Willy Russell’s screenplay of his stage play, with Julie Walters reprising the role she created on stage, and Michael Caine taking the role of the grumpy professor. Both are superb, earning Oscar nominations and winning Bafta and Golden Globes for their performances.\n\nI also like the music, by David Hentschel, which resonates with Wendy Carlos and Switched On Bach.\n\nI don’t think I can say enough good things about this movie. It’s funny, thoughtful, slightly melancholic, but also uplifting.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 25th December 1986 – 22:40\n\nAfter the movie, there’s a plug for the Open University, and why not?\n\nThere’s a trailer for Paul Newman in The Verdict. Then some weather, and BBC1 closes down. And because it’s Christmas, the national anthem plays over the holly skating round the Christmas tree."
