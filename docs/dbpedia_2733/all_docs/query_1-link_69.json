Books are hardly ever the same as the movies nowadays. I don’t know if it was just me but the play was starting to get quite boring. The emotion of Mrs. Frank going off on Mr. Van Daan made me question about how I felt about Mrs. Frank. She was a gentle mother at the\n\nThe play version of The Diary of Anne Frank tells the story of a young girl who is hiding away with her family from the Nazis during World War II. In this play, Anne struggles with the changes of life and finding who she wants to be while trapped in the annex with multiple other people. While the play of Anne’s diary is still read and viewed today, there is a newer version of her diary; a movie. The movie has slightly changed the events of the play to share Anne’s story with a modern audience. In the movie, the audience see Anne change from a regular life in Amsterdam to a completely new life in the secret annex. Although the play and the movie versions of Anne Frank’s life differ in their organizational structure, both works contain the same\n\nWhilst in the book, everyone’s death is inevitable and looming; but in the movie, Vera and Philip Lombard (who is actually a man named Charles Morley) went skipping off the island with Fred Narracott, the captain of the boat that brought the guests to Soldier Island. The ending left the readers with satisfaction and with the hope that Vera and Charles live happily ever after. Regardless of how the book ended, countless number of fans enjoyed watching the movie even with all it’s changes. This pleased the audience and gave them an inspiration that the book did not\n\nSpectacle was very important in using visual elements to show changes in characters, as well as showing a difference between characters. By the clothes worn by Emma Lockwood and Herny Lockwood, the audience was able to tell that there they were a wealthy successful couple. Miriam and Duplay both wore clothes that didn’t seem expensive. However, after Duplay \"helped\" Henry Lockwood his choice of clothing changed. He wore a more professional suit, which was tied with career gain. This change in kind of clothing worn showed how much Duplay life changed and how much he gained after the mystery was resolved. Throughout the play, there were many times where the audience became invisible. The characters would either have their back to the audience\n\nEducating Rita is the tale of one working class women 's struggle to find an escape to a boring, repetitive life and to find new things to conquer. To acheive this she begins university on a literature course despite the discouragement from family and baby-obsessed husband Denny. The play features only two characters, Rita and Frank. Frank- a middle class, well-educated, eloquent professor and Rita, an abrupt, crude excuse for a lady with no regard for or more precise, no knowing of social nouce. Throughout the play Rita 's character must reach two social extremities before she can learn to be true to herself. Arriving in Frank 's office loud and sarcastic\n\nHer job and dialect optimize the way she grew up, and how the expectations of her upbringing limit her future, as being a working class woman she is expected to get married, have children and then become a housewife, ‘I should've had a baby by now. Everyone expects it.’ There were no further expectations for women and certainly no need for them to have an education, ‘Denny gets dead narked if I work at home’. Rita doesn’t like the housewife stereotype and decides to rebel against it by taking the pill and starting a formal education, ‘But I mean, I don't want a baby yet. No. I wanna discover meself first.’ Rita’s family refuse to see the benefits that this could give her and this leads her father to feel sorry for Denny and to feel annoyed at Rita’s lack of commitment to her family, ‘Denny, I'm sorry for you, lad. If she was a wife of mine I'd drown her.’ When Rita thinks about quitting the course to please her family, it’s her mother’s unintentional comment at the pub, ‘There must be better songs than this,’ which drives her forward in the course, ‘And I thought, ‘All I'm doing is getting an education. Just trying to learn. And I love it. It's not easy, I get it wrong half the time, I'm laughed at half the time but I love it because it makes me feel as\n\nThe Effect of Summer School on Rita in Educating Rita by Willy Russell 'Of course; you don't do Blake without doing innocence and experience, do y?' When Frank explains to Rita that after summer school they will study William Blake, Rita says that she has already studied Blake and implies in such a way that she almost disgraces Frank. Before summer school Rita has only been taught Frank and has only learnt his ideas, when she gains her own confidence she then challenges Frank on his views to do with poetry by telling him about William Blake. This confidence reflects the effect which summer school ultimately had upon Rita. Willy Russell was born in Whiston, near Liverpool, England, in 1947."
