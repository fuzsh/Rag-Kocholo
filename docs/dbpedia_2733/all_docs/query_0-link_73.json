        "text": "Review: Educating Rita – Chesil Theatre, 6th October 2022\n\nReview by David Cradduck\n\nImages: Jonathan Hawkins\n\nThis week, Winchester’s Chesil Theatre continues its run of excellent sell-out productions with a classic, Educating Rita, by Willy Russell. It is a comedy / drama and one of the best of its kind – a very British humour, with a self-deprecating, sharp, and acerbic wit.\n\nThe storyline appears at first to be very straightforward – 26 year old hairdresser Rita (not her real name but one she has adopted after a chick lit author she admires) enrols on an Open University course in English Literature in an effort to get away from her drab working class life dominated by her selfish ‘husband’ and inane customers. She aspires to knowing everything there is to know about the subject, to be able to hold her own in an academic world.\n\nShe is not thick, she’s just never had the opportunities to learn. She is nervous, energetic, driven, feisty and opinionated, and desperately wants more to her life. Her tutor is Frank, an academic, weary, middle aged once-poet who has taken to drink to cover his own inadequacies and failures. He hides his bottles of Scotch behind Dickens, Eliot, Blake and other great works on his packed bookshelves to appease the university authorities who (just about) tolerate his habit.\n\nFrank is sceptical about taking Rita on as a student. In fact he is sceptical about Open University teaching itself, which for him means unsocial hours working when he could be in the pub. But he is equally taken aback by Rita’s energy and enthusiasm and so begins a year- long relationship which sees both develop in more ways than they could ever have dreamed. This is not a physical relationship (although Frank is undeniably attracted to her.\n\nWhen he asks her why she couldn’t have come to him 20 years ago, she replies that they might not have allowed her in since she was only six). This is a gently humorous but poignant tale about class distinction, snobbery, unfulfilled ambitions, a quest for knowledge and learning and a desire to be someone else. There is a touch of Pygmalion about the tale and you detect similarities to Willy Russell’s astute observations of class divides and personal aspirations from his other works like Blood Brothers and Shirley Valentine.\n\nEducating Rita is set in the late 70s/early 80s but it is every bit as relevant to today as it was then. The odd reference here and there dates it but otherwise it could be set in 2022.\n\nAs the dialogue progresses – and gosh what a lot of dialogue there is, it being a standard length play with just two actors – we see Rita develop and learn despite the odds, embrace the student life she once shied away from and which Frank despises so that there is almost a role reversal in which she is the tutor trying to get Frank to realise his own potential instead of drowning in self-pity and booze.\n\nBeing a two hander, there is obviously a bond between the two characters and that bond is equally apparent between the two actors playing them here. Gary Nicholson, a 30-year veteran of Chesil, and Francesca Waters in ony her second appearance there, have nailed this one from start to finish. It’s not just their polished performances, nor their immense ability to absorb page after page of wordy script that’s impressive – I was not aware of any slip-ups, pregnant pauses or awkward moments whatsoever. I had to check to see if Francesca hails from somewhere like Liverpool or Manchester, such was the consistency and quality of her accent throughout. I was impressed, too, by the way they both totally inhabit their characters.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, one of the finest performances I have seen on this stage; if there were such a thing as awards for local theatre anymore these two actors would undoubtedly be up there clutching some silverware.\n\nDavid James’s set is appropriately untidy, musty and academic and as is usual at Chesil, attention to detail is top notch– although the painted backdrop outside the deliberately large sash window is something of a distraction depicting a few sparse fir trees that seem a little out of place in a university setting.\n\nCostume changes are restricted because of the time needed so although jackets and tops change it seems that Rita only has one pair of leggings and Frank has only one tie. A picky detail and I’m not sure it could be improved easily.\n\nThe many scenes come and go with subtle set changes covered by as many arrangements and variations I’ve ever heard of the first movement of Mozart’s 40th Symphony played on an equally diverse variety of instruments. Lighting is simple but effective and there are no sound effects to distract.\n\nIn fact, the whole piece is more straightforward than Russell’s 1983 film version starring Michael Caine and Julie Walters, with just the one box set and only two people to tell the story rather than a host of extra cast, locations and unnecessary actions.\n\nThe stage version, to my mind, knocks spots off the film and Chesil’s production is one of the most convincing and entertaining pieces of theatre I have seen for a long time, whether it be on the professional or non-professional stage.\n\nKudos to new director Terrance Lohr, who took inspiration for the choice of play from his experiences of the working class streets of Philadelphia. The combination of his astute direction and superb performances from the two actors has proved a formidable partnership and the result is slick and seamless.\n\nEducating Rita is a sell-out for the remaining performances (I told you it was dead good). But as an interesting aside, Willy Russell’s play agent, Peggy Ramsay, is the subject of Chesil’s next production, Peggy For You by Alan Plater 19-26 November.
