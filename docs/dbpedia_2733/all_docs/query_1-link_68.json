        "text": "OVERVIEW\n\nEducating Rita, a 1983 British comedy-drama film starring Michael Caine (Frank) and Julie Walters (Rita), is a film about class, education, and personal development, the male monopoly on literature, and gender roles. The film tells the story of a 26-year-old working-class woman’s journey, which she started by enrolling in the Open University class, and the difficulties she faces. Rita is assigned to Frank, a literature professor who is an alcoholic and a narcissist, and this dual relationship results in Rita breaking gender roles as well as contributing to Frank’s perspective.\n\nRita, the main character of the film, proves the positive effect of education on becoming a confident and independent woman with her journey, breaking the prejudice that women are inherently lacking in critical thinking. Just as the power of education is witnessed in the film, the positive impact of the feminist perspective in a classless society can also be witnessed. As a result of the bond formed between Frank and Rita, we see that Rita began to defy traditional values and get closer to feminist ideals. With the development of her educational life, we see that Rita has faced many changes, from her outlook on life to her external appearance.\n\nThe struggles of women in the years in which the film is made also shed light on the present and have a motivating quality in the way of striving for equality. In this study, I will examine the topics of maternal oppression, gender discrimination, the glass ceiling in education, and the feminist movements of the 1980s in Britain through the film Educating Rita.\n\nOPPRESSION OF MOTHERHOOD\n\nThe maternal role imposed on women has been seen in all patriarchal societies and exists today as it existed in the 1980s. In addition to the impact of these impositions on women’s psychology, women have also been denied access to certain medical resources, and their right to make decisions on behalf of their bodies has been ignored. Feminist movements have challenged the pressure of a patriarchal society by continuing to work on improving maternity leave policies for their access to medical care.\n\nA large part of the global problem also arises from gender inequality. The pressure on women to become mothers creates a butterfly effect and reduces their access to education and their visibility in the social and political spheres. For this reason, women cannot make decisions about their own lives and play an active role in the development of society. Gender norms are formed as a restriction of women’s freedom to make their own decisions, and this situation exposes women to physical, sexual, and psychological abuse in society, as we have witnessed, albeit covered up in the film. Feminist ideologies meet at a common denominator in their struggle for a just world and equal opportunities through many tools, including education.\n\nMotherhood is not only loaded with great meanings in a social sense but is also a multifaceted experience in an individual sense. Motherhood may be more difficult for some women due to different factors such as an individual’s social class, sexual preferences, and being single. Society’s perspective on motherhood is that motherhood is a woman’s only and most important source of pride. But just as the experience of motherhood contains many difficulties and can be a woman’s life goal, it may not be what many women choose or at the center of their life goals.\n\nAs can be seen in the example of the film Educating Rita, women were seen as lacking the ability to think analytically, and their creativity was transmitted only through fertility. But men’s analytical thinking skills and creativity can manifest themselves in any field, as exemplified in the field of literature. In the film, we also see that literature is a male-dominated field. We are witnessing these prejudices broken by Rita, who is struggling to be visible in a male-dominated area. Although there may be areas where the struggles of the 1980s were effective in an individual sense, these efforts should continue to be carried out to achieve equal opportunities for both sexes in the field of literature in a global sense.\n\nHOUSEWIFIZATION\n\nMany scholars have spoken about the theory of ‘’ Housewifization’’ and made contributions to the literature. This theory, basically and in its simplest form, tells us that in capitalist societies, women became more limited to domestic life and “housewifized” in the process. Luxemburg cites as the reason for this the tendency of the capitalist system to cheapen the cost of reproducing labor power. For this reason, the capitalist system tends to place the burden of jobs such as housework and childcare on women. According to Luxemburg, the infrastructure of this whole process is the roles assigned due to the biological differences between men and women and the idea that women are more prone to housework in this role distribution.\n\nAccording to Luxemburg, housewifization is a phenomenon shaped around the interests of the capitalist system. To be able to fill the gaps in the labor force within the need, women who are not officially employed have been “housewifized.” In doing so, attempts have been made to destroy women’s economic and political decision-making mechanisms and prevent their participation in the labor force. This situation has revealed a social order in which women are always exploited because of their gender as well as their class. When we examine Luxemburg’s theory from a feminist perspective, we see that capitalism condemns women only to domestic life and deprives them of their chances of choice. The struggle waged by women is not only for social life but also for the economic system in general.\n\nThe image of Luxemburg’s theory in the film Educating Rita can be studied as the pressure placed on Rita to limit herself to domestic life by her husband and family as a working-class woman. With Rita’s progress in her educational life, her perspective expands, and she realizes that she does not have to stick to embodied traditional roles. In this way, we see that educating Rita is a revolt against the “housewifization” process and a good example of the impact of education on women’s freedom and independence to make their own choices.\n\nGLASS CEILING IN EDUCATION\n\nThe term glass ceiling\" refers to invisible barriers to the advancement of women in their careers as a minority group. There are many reasons why these barriers can be seen as hard as a ceiling in front of women, such as gender stereotypes, gender roles, and inequality in access to resources and opportunities. With the existence of the glass ceiling, the visibility of women in the economic, social, and political spheres decreases, the representation rate of women decreases, and therefore the development process of society slows down because women are not allowed to use their potential. The restriction of women’s progress in workplaces and higher education also includes psychological harassment and mobbing at work. Because the public sphere, work, and educational life have come under male hegemony. To increase the visibility of women, the glass ceiling theory should be studied more, and studies on it should be increased.\n\nThe glass ceiling is a phenomenon that exists in educational life as well as in business life and can be observed in many countries around the world. The glass ceiling in educational life can also be explained as the merging of differences such as race, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and especially gender, inequality of opportunity, and obstacles that minorities face. We see that women are the most affected by the glass ceiling in education, just like in working life. But as the theory of intersectionality that we will talk about puts forward, the inequality that an individual suffers may not be limited only to her gender. In the film Educating Rita, the example of Rita is exposed to the glass ceiling in education because of her social status as much as she is exposed because of her gender. We can see the existence of a glass ceiling in education through a lack of access to quality education, more limited access to resources, and a lack of support from teachers, which is the clearest example in the film. We can see in Rita’s example that breaking the glass ceiling in education is not enough to break social judgments. Rita is breaking the glass ceiling on herself, but in the meantime, she is forced to choose between her decadent appearance and her educational life. In other words, we cannot say that the individuals who broke the glass ceiling also reached completely equal opportunities. That is why these transformations should shift from the individual to society and lead to global change.\n\nWhen studying the film Educating Rita, the concept of intersectionality is something that should be considered. To briefly explain the concept of intersectionality put forward by Kimberle Crenshaw, Kimberle Crenshaw argues that different personal aspects of an individual (such as gender, religion, class, and sexuality) interact with each other, and the formation of an individual’s identity is influenced by different aspects. Just as individuals have different aspects, their experiences are also unique. Just as their experiences are unique, the discriminations they may face do not cover a single phenomenon that forms their character; they may be exposed to many discriminations.\n\nBy improving their education to make her own decisions, she wants to change her perspective on life and living standards. Rita has been exposed to gender stereotypes along the way. The fact that she is a working-class woman has caused her to have more difficulty realizing her dream of working in a male-dominated field. While watching the film, I noticed that certain aspects of Rita’s personality have been placed in certain patterns by her teachers, family, and peers, and certain prejudices are visible. Because of the social class he is in, he is seen as an outsider and is not taken seriously. Because of her gender, she also experiences the pressure of continuing her life with the roles assigned to her. Through the intersection of these different aspects of her identity, we witness Rita’s unique experience. The intersection of different aspects of Rita’s identity is the glass ceiling that Rita must face.\n\n1980’s FEMINIST MOVEMENT IN BRITAIN\n\nWhen we examine the feminist movements in Britain in the 1980s, we see that there was an increase in feminist activities. In Britain, which is a patriarchal society, gender inequality was also visible at that time. Women’s rights activists are also challenging and acting against the patriarchy to break down these stereotypes, which we can also witness in the film Educating Rita. Studies have been conducted on equal pay, physical and psychological violence against women, pressure on childbirth, expanding women’s economic, social, and political rights, and their active participation in politics. While continuing these studies, they also focus on the contributions of women to society by being active in society. We can also attest to the development of feminist movements in the 1980s with the emergence of Beatrix Campbell, Sheila Rowbotham, and Germaine Greer, who were very influential writers and thinkers. These women have contributed a lot to feminist literature and have made a lot of progress in breaking down gender roles. The activities against gender inequality, which seemed to strengthen in Britain in the 1980s, were also reflected in the popular culture of the period in films such as Educating Rita, which examines the power of education in the construction and destruction of gender inequality and prejudices against women.\n\nThe feminist movement that gained momentum in the 1980s has carried out several activities such as repealing the 1967 abortion law, launching the National Abortion Campaign, ensuring access to all reproductive health services including birth control, advocating for the 1983 Equal Pay Law to draw attention to the equal pay gap, laying the foundations of many organizations such as the Women’s Rights Commission to draw attention to physical and sexual harassment against women in the workplace, working on various policies and services to prevent violence against women in all areas, supporting measures such as gender quotas to increase women’s representation and visibility in political life, and supporting the presence of women with initiatives such as the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp.\n\nIn the 1980s, the rapidly growing feminist movement was evident in the film Educating Rita at certain key points. Rita initially has a father and husband who impose pressures such as having children or taking on domestic responsibilities. But as the story progresses, she gains the ability to make decisions of her own, such as reproductive choices or how actively involved she wants to be in home life. Rita’s husband, a plumber, earns more money than her. As Rita’s level of education increases, her perspective on paid work changes. At this point, the film also touches on the issue of equal pay. Lastly, the film serves as a motivational tool in the fight against gender-based violence by showing Rita leaving her husband, who was physically and psychologically abusive toward her.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEducating Rita is the story of a woman who faces the social gender roles, oppression, class conflict, and gender discrimination of the 1980s but still manages to find her path. The film takes place in Britain in the 1980s but sheds light on the oppression that takes place in a timeless and placeless way. The obstacles and sacrifices Rita makes on her journey to self-discovery also shed light on the feminist movements of the period. With this feature, the film portrays how education has a positive effect on the struggle that many women face behind unseen walls in their home lives.\n\nSOURCE:\n\nArslan, S. (2015).
