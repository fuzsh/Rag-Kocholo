        "text": "While my hubby and I only got married last Halloween this is actually our 11 year anniversary. So we wanted to do something that was meaningful, this was the very first film we watched together. We had known each other some months but only been together a couple of weeks. This was on BBC1 for the millionth time so we watched it, discussed it and sat up talking till about 5am. Not drunken ramblings, completely sober and telling each other the most personal things. It was that night we both really knew. <3 <3 <3\n\nAnyway this is such a good film with amazing chemistry between the 2. Michael Caine is fantastic as the jaded pisshead lecturer and Julie Walters…\n\n\"Doctor, are you drunk?!\"\n\n\"Drunk? Of course I'm drunk. You don't really expect me to teach this when I'm sober.\"\n\nFirst watch for me of this adaptation of Willy Russell's stage play. For anyone who doesn't already know, the premise see's Julie Walters' hairdresser Rita striving to break from her husband's/family's expectations that her future holds only marriage and kids. In order to unlock her academic potential, enter Michael Caine's jaded alcoholic professor...\n\nDirector Lewis Gilbert handles the material almost as if it's still a stage production. For the majority of the running time, most of the meat on the script is essentially a two hander between Caine and Walters. And it's there that the magic lies. Caine has referenced…\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's Irish play Pygmalion has given birth to multiple adaptations of very different stylistic and thematic focal points over the years, with the Audrey Hepburn musical My Fair Lady and the 1999 teenage modernization She's All That as the two examples that will at least ring a bell for most people. Now largely forgotten, however, is the British retelling Educating Rita with Michael Caine and Julie Walters, which is a shame since it's a charming story brought to screen with witty and profound writing and two phenomenal lead performances by Caine and newcomer Walters, who brightens up the screen with her commanding presence from the first minute.\n\nOne of my pet peeves in movies is when they intentionally…\n\nLost count of the amount of times I've seen this since I first clapped eyes on it as a teenager in my bedroom when BBC1 broadcast one Friday night in 1995 (thanks BBC Genome).\n\nIt is arguably the film that gave me two things, my appreciation of Michael Caine (still my favourite movie star) and my appreciation of theatre. The latter developed because I went to my local library and found a book of Willy Russell's play off the back of seeing the film, and I was surprised to see that the play only features two characters, Rita and Frank, and one room! I was amazed I think that theatre could be so contained and yet still deliver the core…\n\nBased on Willy Russell’s stage play of the same name, this endearing British comedy-drama follows a Liverpudlian working-class hairdresser as she tries to broaden her horizons. Sick of spending time with her narrow-minded boyfriend and his unsophisticated chums, pressured into starting a family by her conservative parents, and frustrated by a lack of opportunity and the mundanity of her daily life, 26-year-old Rita seeks to better herself by enrolling in an Open University English Literature course. The course is tutored by a bitter, alcoholic professor named Frank Bryant, who has grown jaded through long years in the classroom teaching students who he thinks are too caught up in their own affectations to be worthy of his time. He’s initially very…"
