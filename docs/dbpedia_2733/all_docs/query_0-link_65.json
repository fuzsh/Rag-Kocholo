        "text": "Characters\n\nDan Tunbridge as Frank\n\nHolly Hallam as Rita\n\nPlot\n\nFrank is a tutor of English in his fifties whose disillusioned outlook on life drives him to drink and bury himself in his books. Enter Rita, a forthright 26 year-old hairdresser who is eager to learn. After weeks of cajoling, Rita slowly wins over the very hesitant Frank with her innate insight and refusal to accept no for an answer. Their relationship as teacher and student blossoms, ultimately giving Frank a new sense of self and Rita the knowledge she so craves. The play became a hit film with Michael Caine and Julie Walters in 1983.\n\nDirector’s note\n\nThe beauty of a play like Educating Rita is the underlying meaning, the thoughts and feelings expressed by the characters throughout the show, are timeless and shared by many of us. Feeling out of place, wanting more from life, seeking knowledge, finding ways to cope with things we don’t like or enjoy. It also shows us how two people of completely different classes, upbringings, and perceived social status, can have more in common than one might think and actually get on very well. It’s a light-hearted, yet serious and truthful look into their journeys through their lives together with some odd twists and turns. This play has some drama, some comedy, and a sprinkle of romance – overall delivering something really quite charming and enjoyable to watch."
