        "text": "A brand-new production of the blueprint for the modern thriller, Dial M for Murder is back. When married hairdresser Rita enrols on a university course to expand her horizons, little does she realise where the journey will take her. Her tutor Frank is a frustrated poet, brilliant academic and dedicated drunk who’s less than enthusiastic about taking Rita on, but they soon realise how much they have to teach each other. This hilarious and heart-warming comedy won the Olivier Award when it was produced in London’s West End by the RSC and was adapted into the multi-award-winning film starring Julie Walters and Michael Caine. Written by the great playwright Willy Russell (Blood Brothers) and directed by Max Roberts of Live Theatre, this production of Educating Rita stars well-loved actor Stephen Tompkinson as Frank and introduces Jessica Johnson as Rita."
