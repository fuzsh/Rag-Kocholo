        "text": "Tally Ho! Productions is proud to present its new production of Willy Russell’s classic comedy, EDUCATING RITA.\n\nRita White, a young Liverpudlian hairdresser enrolls in an Open University course to study literature to better herself and escape from her drab and dreary working-class world. Along the way, she meets her tutor, Frank Bryant, a jaded professor who quickly becomes fascinated by Rita's offbeat take on the world of academia.\n\nEDUCATING RITA was originally commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare company and opened to great acclaim in 1980. The play was adapted in 1983 to a multi-award-winning film starring Michael Caine and Julie Waters.\n\nFeatured in the titular role of Rita is Fleur du Cap and Naledi nominee, Zoë McLaughlin, last seen in “The Last Five Years” as Cathy Hiatt. Playing opposite her as Professor Frank Bryant is multi-award-winning actor Jason K. Ralph, last seen as Lord Wessex in the Fugard Theatre production of “Shakespeare in Love”. The South Africa production features a brand-new score by internationally recognised composer Jonathan M. Blair and is being directed Paul Griffiths.\n\nWith dialogue radiant with the wit and charm of 1980s England, EDUCATING RITA is an intimate, funny, and moving classic about two people trapped in their lives, who in meeting, offer one another an unexpected breath of fresh air.\n\nThe production has a running time of 120 minutes with a 20-minute intermission and carries an age-restriction of PG for mild-language usage.\n\nEducating Rita will be running at Theatre on the bay from 5 July 2022 to 15 July 2022 for a limited season. Tickets are selling from R150,00 to R 250,00 through Webtickets. Book online, at any Webtickets vendor or by calling the Theatre on the bay box-office at 021 438 3300 or 021 438 3301."
