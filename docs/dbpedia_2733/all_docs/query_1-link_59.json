        "text": "Yesterday was Christmas Eve, which also happened to be the first night of Hanukkah. One of the gifts from my uncle was an edition of “Roger Ebert’s Movie Home Companion” from 1988. This book was sitting on his shelf for probably 20+ years when he took it down and thought that it would make a perfect holiday gift for his only nephew. I thought that this would start off the beginning of a series of posts where one film critic (yours truly) goes after one of the most famous and recognized of all film critics (Ebert) and takes apart their review piece by piece to see where he went wrong. I thought I would begin with one of my favorite films of all time; one that I revisit from time to time on Youtube. Lewis Gilbert’s adaptation of Willy Russell’s stage play “Educating Rita” seemed to be something that Roger Ebert would fall in love with, but surprisingly I was wrong.\n\nMichael Caine plays Frank Bryant, a literature professor with a weakness for the drink. He has a wife who lives hundreds of miles away and a girlfriend named Julia (Jeananne Crowley) who is having an affair with his colleague Brian (Michael Williams). He has lost his spark for teaching, has failed as a writer and has nothing to look forward to in his boring life. In walks in his tutorial student Rita (Julie Walters) a cockney hairdresser wanting to get her basic education degree. Rita is married to the uncouth Denny (Malcolm Douglas) who is against her educative ambitions and whose priority is to start a family. Frank’s office becomes a refuge where the two figures can discuss literature and their own troubles and the student/teacher relationship blossoms where one helps the other live life to the fullest.\n\nEbert’s approach to his critique was how Russell adapted his stage play to the screen. As a two character play, Russell’s purpose was to exclusively show the evolution of Frank and Rita’s relationship from teacher and student to confidants and potential romantic partners. It also shows Frank’s desire to quit teaching and devote his life to publishing poetry and Rita’s hesitation towards starting a family, during which she secretly takes the pill behind Denny’s back. Ebert believes that including the other characters like Julia, Brian, Denny and Rita’s Mahler loving flat partner Trisha (Maureen Lipman) were unnecessary distractions. He did say that Caine’s portrayal of Frank was “weary and kind” and “funny and self-hating”, something that is indisputable, given the amazing performance from this legend. Overall, Ebert saw that Russell’s uneven screenplay and the characters having “delivering speeches, tak[ing] decisions and mak[ing] decisions” because of the way the plot was set up, made “Educating Rita” worthy of a two star review.\n\nI cannot help but see that a veteran film critic like Roger Ebert completely missed the point of the film. To begin with, the film is adapted from the play, which means that it provides license to give each character a visual backstory as opposed to them recounting their life to the other. I thought it was great to see why Frank copes with alcohol and why Rita wants to enrich herself culturally and scholarly. And for the way that both characters assert themselves by “delivering speeches...” which Ebert disliked, it only made the audience cherish Frank and Rita a lot more. It also provided the opportunity for Caine and Walters to put all the passion and emotion into their performances which were both Oscar-worthy, even as they both won Golden Globes and BAFTA awards.\n\nTo finish off this post, Ebert had the gall to see the last scene of Frank and Rita at the airport as a “cop out...by the screenplay”. Far from it. When I first saw this scene, I saw it as a coda to a symphony of struggling and perseverance. Rita has passed her exams and Frank goes back to writing poetry. They both don’t need the other’s guidance and instead are free to restart their lives respectively. It has to be in the history of cinema, one of the most gratifying endings to any film of any genre that I have seen. It’s a happily ever after without the two of them getting together romantically. Frank and Rita totally deserve their happy endings wholeheartedly, but they didn’t deserve a mediocre review from Roger Ebert."
