        "text": "A young, working class hairdresser from Liverpool and a middle-aged professor locked into the world he chose for himself come to terms with where they are – or aren't – going in life in \"Educating Rita,\" now being staged at The Majestic Theater in West Springfield.\n\n\"There are some interesting threads that run through all five of our plays this season, despite their very different settings and storylines. All of them are truly contemporary, celebrated works that show both the workings of the human mind and the dynamics of personal interactions,\" said producing director Danny Eaton.\n\nThe plot centers around Frank, a disillusioned professor whose outlook on life has turned him to drink, and his relationship as mentor to Rita, a forthright 26-year-old hairdresser who is eager to learn anything and everything and refuses to take \"no\" for an answer. The friendship between the unlikely pair gives Frank a renewed sense of self and Rita the knowledge and skills she so craves.\n\nA comedy by Willy Russell, who also wrote \"Blood Brothers,\" which was successfully staged twice during the Majestic's past 17 seasons, the play made its debut in London in 1980 and was later adapted for film in 1983 with Michael Caine and Julie Walters as the leads.\n\nEaton has tapped Rand Foerster to direct the play. An actor, director and now teacher in Amherst, Foerster worked with many of the most talented actors, playwrights, and directors of the American theater while serving as artistic director of the West Bank Café Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City during the eighties and nineties. He has previously directed several plays at the theater including \"Barefoot in the Park\" and \"The Fantasticks.\"\n\n\"The play is a great piece for two actors... a really great celebration of the character Rita,\" said Foerster.\n\n\"I had basically forgotten about the play. I saw the movie when it came out and enjoyed it, but it wasn't really my cup of tea. But, when I read the script recently, I discovered it was really well-written... the conversations between Frank and Rita and within it the commentary on education and class and social hierarch, and its unspoken romance,\" he added.\n\nFoerster, a teacher himself, understands the world of academia."
