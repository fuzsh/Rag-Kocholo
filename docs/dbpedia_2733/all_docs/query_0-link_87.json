Advocates for women’s rights to education rose up and soon, teaching became a feminine job and a wide arrange of seminaries and academies for young ladies were built. This boom in education for both genders happened during the years leading up to the Woman Suffrage Movement in 1848, where those in support of women’s suffrage gathered in Seneca Falls, New York to pass a resolution that gave women the right to vote. So the question is asked: did women’s rights to education lead up to their suffrage? Women’s Education in the United States by Margaret A. Nash gives insight into how women’s education came about and what its purpose was.\n\nShe again stresses that it is the equality of education that is being sought after. The essay by Murray is important because it demonstrates just one of the many thoughts that were increasingly being expressed by women of the time.

For example, Anna in the Tropics uses the idea of gender roles in the way in which females take the role a man would normally take. However, when reading through the play roles are played in many ways. However, I believe that when reading this play the reader must read and understand the play with an open mind for the opposite sex as at times he and or she does a task that can be difficult for the opposite sex. Anna in the tropics, in my opinion, is a play that can provide an excellent insight into how women can do the same things men can or are expected to do.\n\nA Doll House And Trifles Comparison Essay\n\n558 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn comparing and contrast both drama A Doll House by (Henrik Ibsen), and Trifles by (Susan Glaspell).

Slight rebellious acts of women bending gender norms can be seen as far back as Shakespearean plays, in particular, Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing. Olivia from Twelfth Night, and Beatrice from Much Ado About Nothing showcase characteristics of being opinionated, assertive, and strong-willed; qualities that were rarely seen during that time period. Much Ado About Nothing was written around 1598 and Twelfth Night was written around 1601, which was the Elizabethan era. During the Elizabethan era, women were raised to think that they were inferior to men.\n\nFeminist Criticism In Othello\n\n1360 Words | 6 Pages\n\nA Modern View of Feminist Criticism William Shakespeare 's \"Othello” can be analyzed from a feminist perspective. This criticism focuses on relationships between genders, like the patterns of thoughts, behavior, values, enfranchisement, and power in relations between and within sexes. A feminist examination of the play enables us to judge the distinctive social esteems and status of women and proposes that the male-female power connections that become an integral factor in scenes of Othello impact its comprehension. I believe that the critical lens that provides modern society with the most compelling view of literature is Feminist Criticism because it analyzes distrust and disloyalty among relationships, women being treated as possessions\n\nRhetorical Analysis Of We All Should Be Feminist\n\n1076 Words | 5 Pages\n\nSome key points she made were that we should raise our children differently and that gender matters.

Indeed, even in the investigation of Mr. Wright’s murder, men are playing the core role of investigators while women are simply left in the kitchen to play the minor of collecting things requested by Mrs. Wrights. The social stereotypes of men playing important roles than women in the society is set and advanced by the setting of the play.\n\nFeminist Theatre History\n\n1521 Words | 7 Pages\n\nFeminist theatre came into being as a by product of the experimental theatre movement of the 1970s’ and 1980’. It was an alternate theatre which enabled women to explore their creative talents on stage independently. Feminist theatre served as a means of constructing an exclusive feminist discourse on stage that questioned the patriarchal norms of female subjugation. Its movement was towards the construction of a theatre space where women are no longer mere stage props. They started functioning as the creators of drama rather than being confined to the roles of wife, lover, mother or lunatic.\n\nFeminist Roles In Pygmalion\n\n2825 Words | 12 Pages\n\nThis play consists of a lot many themes.
