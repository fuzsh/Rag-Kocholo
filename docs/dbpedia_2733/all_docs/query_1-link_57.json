        "text": "The Great British Comedy\n\nEducating Rita was commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company and first performed in 1980 with Julie Walters as Rita. It has been revived many times with actors such as Con O’Neill, Lenny Henry and EastEnders’ Larry Lamb as Frank. Julie Walters also revived Rita in the BAFTA award winning 1983 film version, opposite Michael Caine.\n\nUnlike that film adaptation, the original stage version of Educating Rita is a two-hander, featuring only Rita and Frank. Frank is a lecturer in English Literature at a Liverpool university. In his early fifties, he is well into a self-destructive spiral that he thinks whiskey will help him escape. Rita on the other hand is seeking to use knowledge and education to prevent herself following a similar path. She is unlike anyone Frank knows, and is as loud and chaotic as her first entrance.\n\nThe play follows the sometimes startling effect they have on each other over a year of Open University tutorials. It draws on themes common to author Willy Russell’s other work, which includes worldwide successes such as Shirley Valentine and the musical Blood Brothers. The British class system, its educational institutions, and personal freedom to change; all these and more are treated to Rita’s humour or Frank’s indignation as Rita turns to the OU in her search for a way to grow as a person. It turns out to be far from a one-way street, as Frank finds himself being taught a great deal by Rita along the way. Even the author’s own teenage experience as a ladies’ hairdresser gets some time in the spotlight.\n\nEducating Rita is an absolute joy of a play, treating the audience to scenes that are serious, emotional, and laugh-out-loud funny - often all at once. In Frank and Rita, Willy Russell has created characters that are both loveable and loathable, but who keep the audience on side to the very end.\n\nThis production is a departure from Stage Two Downham’s normal schedule, appearing in an experimental summer slot. It is something of a passion project for Jen and Richard, and these Stage Two Downham stalwarts are looking forward to drawing the Downham audience along for the journey.\n\nInterval Refreshments\n\nIn a first for Stage Two Downham, there will be a bar selling glasses of prosecco (and equally nice non-alcoholic alternatives) during the interval or each performance.\n\nPre-Theatre Meal at The Assheton Arms\n\nWe are delighted that once again The Assheton Arms in Downham will be offering a pre-theatre meal exclusively for Stage Two Downham ticket holders.\n\nThey will provide a two course meal for just £20, and will also make sure your meal is complete in time for you to make short journey to Downham Village Hall. Once you have bought your theatre tickets, call The Assheton Arms on 01200 439699 to reserve your table."
