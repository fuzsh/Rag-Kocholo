Educating Rita follows 26 year old Liverpudlian hairdresser, Rita, and her experience in returning to education. Tutor, and failed poet, Frank, is initially reluctant to take on the enormity of trying to teach this needy but unconventional would-be student, preferring to continue easing his way through his life, relationship and career with the help of booze he keeps stashed behind the literary works on his office shelves. Educating Rita performs at Titchfield Festival Theatre from 22 – 27 April.

Bex Macdonald is director of Educating Rita:

“During my drama studies at school, I vividly remember immersing myself in the play Educating Rita and later feeling captivated by the performances of Julie Walters and Michael Caine in the film adaptation. Our class had the opportunity to watch the film on a rainy afternoon, and it left a lasting impression on me. Willy Russell has a remarkable talent for crafting incredibly rich, three-dimensional characters that resonate deeply with audiences. His work effortlessly balances humour and tragedy, a skill also evident in Blood Brothers, another favourite of mine. The characters in Russell's works feel authentically real, flawed yet inherently funny, making his storytelling truly exceptional.

“The play remains highly relevant to today's audiences, as class, gender, and ethnicity unfortunately continue to significantly influence people's choices and opportunities, as well as societal expectations. In contemporary society, "postcode lotteries" continue to influence these factors, while social media exacerbates them. However, many individuals opt for the Open University as a more accessible means of studying and learning outside of traditional institutions, helping to dismantle some of the barriers to education that persist today.

“Educating Rita is a play which is funny, poignant and real. I think everyone can see elements of themselves in the characters, and the actors who play Frank and Rita respectively really give a masterclass of how to bring three dimensional characters to life as well as a lesson in endurance… they hardly leave the stage for the entire show!”
