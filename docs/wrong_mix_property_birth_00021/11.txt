Biography

Prince Nelson is Notable.

Prince was a Jehovah's Witness

Prince Rogers Nelson, known throughout the world simply as Prince, the prolific, flamboyant, multi-talented singer-songwriter-performer, was born on 7 June 1958 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Prince had a prolific output, releasing 39 albums during his life.... He released hundreds of songs both under his own name and multiple pseudonyms during his life, as well as writing songs that were made famous by other musicians, such as "Nothing Compares 2 U" and "Manic Monday". Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. Prince sold over 150 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award [1985 Best Original Song Score], and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and will be inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.[1]

He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, and at the ceremony played an electrifying lead guitar solo in the performance of George Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps with an all-star band. Prince's riveting guitar solo comes at the end. (George Harrison, as a solo artist, was also inducted to the Hall of Fame in 2004.)

In a memorial interview in the Washington Post, guitarist Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top praised Prince's technique and singled out the opening guitar solo for Prince's When Doves Cry as "defying description."
