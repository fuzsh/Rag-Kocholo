Let me explain.\n\nDuring Royal Week in Scotland, Prince William joined King Charles, Queen Camilla and his uncle, Prince Edward, at St. Giles’s Cathedral in Edinburgh for the Order of the Thistle service held on July 3.\n\nAndrew Milligan - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThough the future king, 42, normally goes by the Prince of Wales, Prince William and his wife, Princess Catherine, 42, are called the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay whenever they visit Scotland.\n\nAccording to People, dating back to 1469, the Duke of Rothesay is a traditional royal title that is often given to the male heir to the Scottish throne and the wife of the heir becomes the Duchess of Rothesay.\n\nIn September 2022, King Charles named his oldest son as the new Duke of Rothesay as well as the new Prince of Wales in his first televised speech following the passing of his mom, Queen Elizabeth II. “Today, I am proud to create him Prince of Wales,” the newly crowned monarch said at the time. “With Catherine beside him, our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations.”\n\nKing Charles bestowed another moniker upon the royal couple: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Cornwall. You see, the “Duchess of Cornwall” title was previously held by King Charles’s wife, Queen Camilla. Before Queen Elizabeth’s passing, Charles was also known as the Prince of Wales—the royal title he was given by the queen after tying the knot with his late ex-wife, Princess Diana, in 1981.\n\nAll hail the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton Share Steamy Moment on Royal Balcony—and I Totally Almost Missed it"
