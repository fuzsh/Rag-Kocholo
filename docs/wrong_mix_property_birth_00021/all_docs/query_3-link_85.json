        "text": "Tatler chronicles the couple’s royal relationship as they celebrate their wedding anniversary\n\nPrince Albert II and Princess Charlene of Monaco have found their marriage under the microscope many times. Over the last few years, European tabloids have reported the couple are living in separate countries. Charlene was said to be living in Switzerland while Albert remained in Monaco with their twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\n\nRead More\n\nIs Princess Charlene of Monaco living in Switzerland? Marriage with Prince Albert is simply ‘ceremonial’, reports claim\n\nFresh rumours are swirling around the state of the relationship between Prince Albert and Princess Charlene of Monaco\n\nWhispers surrounding the state of the royal marriage have resurfaced intermittently over the years. Paternity suits, wedding day tears and awkward public appearances have led to widespread speculation. Most notably, Princess Charlene, 46, a former Olympic swimmer, spent the majority of 2021 in South Africa while Prince Albert, 66, remained at home.\n\nThe Monaco royal palace has not commented on the claims. However, last year Prince Albert publicly dismissed separate rumours of an estrangement, branding the tabloid reports ‘malicious’ and untrue. This was the latest twist in the tumultuous marriage of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene.\n\nRead More\n\nA sign of trouble? Princess Charlene of Monaco’s Instagram account is deactivated amid rumours of marriage woes\n\nReports published this week suggest Princess Charlene is living apart from her husband Prince Albert II\n\nPrince Albert, son of Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly, met South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock in the early 2000s, yet the couple waited before exchanging vows in the twin civil and religious ceremonies. Although undoubtedly grand – the Earl and Countess of Wessex (now Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh) were among the dozens of royals in attendance – it was a day marred by rumours and speculation as to the state of the bride and groom's relationship.\n\nReports swirled in the days leading up to the wedding that Charlene had gotten cold feet (possibly due to a paternity suit) but the big day went ahead as planned. The three-day proceedings began on 30 June with a concert by The Eagles. This was followed by a civil ceremony on 1 July in the Throne Room of the Prince’s Palace, for which Charlene wore a custom-made aquamarine Chanel suit. Then finally there was a religious ceremony on 2 July, when Charlene wore an off-the-shoulder Armani Prive gown with 40,000 Swarovski crystals, and which was attended by supermodels, sports personalities and world leaders. As photos from the wedding began to circulate around the world, there was much comment on how visibly upset Charlene appeared (the newly titled princess was photographed with tears in her eyes) – but she brushed these rumours off, insisting all brides are emotional on their wedding day.\n\nRead More\n\nIs this Princess Charlene of Monaco’s most glamorous look ever?\n\nThe Hollywood actors on the red carpet at the Monte Carlo TV Festival paled in comparison to the classic elegance of Princess Charlene of Monaco\n\nThe concerns as to the state of Princess Charlene's marriage were not without their grounding: Prince Albert had previously admitted to fathering two children out of wedlock, although these relationships pre-dated his one with Charlene. However, rumours have continued to swirl in the almost 13 years since the wedding. In early 2023, Princess Charlene and Prince Albert of Monaco have found their relationship back in the spotlight once again after a French magazine claimed the couple have started to separate. The royal couple issued a statement dismissing the ‘malicious rumours’. ‘I would like to formally deny the malicious rumours peddled by the French magazine Royauté. Please disregard this article which is totally unfounded,’ a spokesperson said.\n\nThe couple have worked hard to dismiss this chatter and continue to put on a united front on important occasions, including the coronation of King Charles and Queen Camilla (they even joined other foreign VIPs at Oswald’s on the eve of the service). To mark their 12th anniversary, they released a low-key photo via their Instagram account which shows Prince Albert and Princess Charlene smiling into each other’s eyes at a royal engagement. It is notable for its lack of flashiness – for their 10th anniversary, which coincided with Princess Charlene’s extended stay in South Africa in 2021, the royal palace released a series of slickly-produced videos trumpeting their royal romance."
