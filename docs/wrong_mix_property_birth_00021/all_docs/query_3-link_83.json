        "text": "William and Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales, celebrated their 13th wedding anniversary with a never-before-seen photo from their ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 2011.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton shared a black-and-white photo on their official social media accounts April 29, featuring Kate wearing her wedding gown and veil and William sporting his military uniform.\n\n“13 years ago today!” the post is captioned.\n\nThe post comes over a month after the former Kate Middleton publicly shared on March 22 that she is undergoing chemotherapy treatment after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\nKate revealed the health news in a video in which she also asked for “some time, space and privacy” for her family, including her three children with William: Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.\n\nIn her video about the “early stages” of her treatment, the princess mentioned her husband and children.\n\n“This, of course, came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family,” Kate said.\n\n“Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance, too, as is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you. It means so much to both of us,” she added.\n\nThe couple have been supporting each other for more than two decades. They were pictured together for the first time 20 years ago, launching the public's first glimpse of their royal romance.\n\nThe two were spotted skiing together on the Swiss slopes in April 2004. At the time, Will and Kate were trying to keep their relationship under wraps, but the public went into a frenzy once The Sun published photos from their ski trip with the headline, “Finally..Wills gets a girl.\"\n\nIn the cover photo, Will and Kate were seen hitting the slopes together in matching red and black outfits.\n\nOnce the pics hit newsstands, a tabloid obsession for the couple quickly took off. Royal fans watched the couple's love story unfold right before their eyes. In 2011, Will and Kate got married and later welcomed their three kids.\n\nRead on to find a full timeline of William and Kate's relationship in their own words.\n\n2002: William and Kate met in college\n\nWilliam and Kate met while attending the University of St. Andrews — and thanks, in part, to a 2002 fashion show.\n\nThe future king first caught sight of Kate when she wore a sheer, see-through dress at a college fashion show called “The Art of Seduction.\" The dress was later auctioned off for more than $125,000 per People.\n\nIn their first joint interview together after their 2010 engagement, conducted with ITV News’s Tom Bradby, Kate said that she remembered William telling her that she actually turned \"bright red\" when she met him for the first time and \"sort of scuttled off.\"\n\n“(I was) feeling very shy about meeting you,” she said.\n\n2002: Kate and William become 'very close friends'\n\nAfter their first encounter, the pair became \"very close friends,\" William said in their first joint interview after their engagement.\n\n“We were friends for over a year first,” William explained. “It just sort of blossomed from then on.”\n\n“(We) realized we shared the same interests,” he added. “(We) just had a really good time.”\n\nWilliam and Kate move in together\n\n“We moved in together as friends,” William said in his first joint interview with Kate since their engagement, adding, “We lived with a couple of others, as well, and it just sort of blossomed from there, really, we just saw more of each other, hung out a bit more and did stuff.”\n\nKate also talked about their early days together when she filmed \"A Berry Royal Christmas\" with baking expert Mary Berry in 2019.\n\nAccording to Insider, Kate said that William used to \"cook all sorts of meals\" for them when they were in their \"university days.\"\n\n\"I think that’s when he was trying to impress me, Mary,” Kate said. “Things like Bolognese sauce and things like that.”\n\nHowever, in the book \"A Taste of Home,\" William admitted that his cooking skills are subpar.\n\n“When I was trying to impress Kate, I was trying to cook these amazing, fancy dinners and all that would happen was that I would burn something, something would over spill, something would catch on fire. And she’d be sitting in the background just trying to help and basically taking control of the whole situation. So I was quite glad she was there at the time,” William wrote.\n\nWilliam and Kate briefly break up\n\nWilliam confirmed that he and Kate briefly broke up in their early stages of dating during their first joint interview.\n\n“We did split up for a bit, but that was just, we were both very young, it was at university, and we were both sort of defining ourselves as such and being different characters and stuff,” he said. “It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up.”\n\nOctober 2010: Kate and William get engaged\n\nIn October 2010, William popped the question to Kate during a private holiday in Kenya, Clarence House announced in a statement.\n\nClarence House also announced that William \"informed the queen and other close members of his family\" of their engagement and he \"sought the permission of Miss Middleton’s father\" before he asked for his girlfriend's hand in marriage.\n\nAs for the ring? Buckingham Palace confirmed that William gave Kate his late mother Princess Diana’s sapphire engagement ring.\n\nGiving it to her was “my way of making sure my mother didn’t miss out on today,” William said at a press conference, according to The Guardian, adding that the engagement ring was \"very special\" to him.\n\n“The timing is right now, we are both very, very happy,\" he said. \"We both have a very good sense of humor and we take the mickey out of each other a lot.”\n\nApril 2011: William and Kate get married\n\nIn April 2011, onlookers watched as Kate and William walked down the aisle together at Westminster Abbey in London.\n\nFor their nuptials, Kate wore a gown designed by Sarah Burton with lengthy sleeves and a long train.\n\nOn that same day, Queen Elizabeth II gave William and her new granddaughter-in-law new royal titles: the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nAfter their wedding, William and Kate jetted off to Seychelles in East Africa for their honeymoon.\n\nJuly 2011: Kate and William move into Kensington Palace\n\nIn July 2011, Kate and William made their big move into Kensington Palace, their first official royal home as a couple.\n\nThe couple chose to move into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the Hyde Park-enclosed palace.\n\nThe duo stayed there for a few months before they moved into a larger apartment in Kensington Palace, which was last occupied by Elizabeth's late sister, Princess Margaret, according to People.\n\nThe outlet reported that their new space was the size of a \"small mansion,\" which is perfect for them to start a family. In 2022, they relocated to a house on the grounds of Windsor Castle.\n\nDecember 2012: Kate and William announce they're expecting their 1st child\n\nIn December 2012, palace officials happily announced that Kate was pregnant with her first child with William.\n\nWhile pregnant with George, Kate was hospitalized with hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe type of morning sickness.\n\nJuly 2013: William and Kate welcomes Prince George\n\nIn July 2013, William and Kate became parents when they welcomed their first child, son Prince George Alexander Louis.\n\nA statement released at the time said that George would be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge, and that he was born at St. Mary’s Hospital in London at 4:24 p.m. local time.\n\nDuring a 2020 interview on the “Happy Mum, Happy Baby” podcast, Kate said that she didn't know if she was going to have a boy or a girl.\n\n“It was a surprise,” she said, according to Insider. “But also seeing … you know, your husband, William ... seeing the pure joy of his face, it was really special.”\n\nSeptember 2014: William and Kate announce they're expecting another child\n\nIn September 2014, Kensington Palace announced that Kate and William were expecting their second child. \"The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news,\" the palace said in a statement.\n\nAs with her first pregnancy, Kate experienced hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme pregnancy sickness.\n\nOn May 2, 2015, at 8:34 a.m. local time, Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana was born at London’s St. Mary’s Hospital, per NBC News.\n\nAfter their little girl was born, NBC News reported that William left the hospital in the afternoon and returned a little while later with George.\n\n“How’s your daughter? How’s she doing?” a woman in the crowd yelled to him, according to the outlet.\n\n“I am very happy, thank you,” William responded.\n\nSeptember 2017: Kate becomes pregnant with baby No. 3 in 2017\n\nIn September 2017, Kensington Palace announced that Kate and William were going to expand their family once again.\n\n\"The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news,\" the palace said in a statement.\n\n“As with her previous two pregnancies, The Duchess is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum,” the statement continued.\n\nIn a 2020 interview on Giovanna Fletcher’s “Happy Mum, Happy Baby“ podcast, Kate talked about the morning sickness she experienced in her pregnancies and said she’s never been the “happiest of pregnant people.”\n\n“Lots of people have it far, far worse. It was definitely a challenge. Not just for me, but also for your loved ones around you and I think that’s the thing — being pregnant and having a newborn baby and things like that, impacts everybody in the family,” she said.\n\n“William didn’t feel he could do much to help and it’s hard to see you’re suffering without actually being able to do anything about it,” Kate continued.\n\nApril 2018: William and Kate welcome Louis in 2018\n\nIn April 2018, William and Kate welcomed their third child, a son named Louis, at St. Mary’s Hospital in London. At the time of his birth, Louis weighed 8 pounds and 7 ounces, the palace confirmed.\n\n\"The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news. Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well,\" Kensington Palace said.\n\nShortly after he was born, his siblings, George and Charlotte, came to visit him at the hospital.\n\nApril 2021: William and Kate celebrate their 10-year anniversary\n\nThe couple commemorated their 10-year anniversary on Instagram, posting a clip of them and their kids having fun together outside.

My three children have got to spend holidays with her and create memories that will last their whole lives. She was by my side at my happiest moments. And she was by my side during the saddest days of my life.”\n\n“I knew this day would come, but it will be some time before the reality of life without Grannie will truly feel real,” the statement continued.\n\nFebruary 2023: William and Kate match at the BAFTAs\n\nIn February, William and Kate dazzled fans when they walked the red carpet at the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), both wearing black-and-white outfits.\n\nFor the event, William wore a black velvet tuxedo, while Kate opted for a white Alexander McQueen gown that she originally wore to the BAFTAs in 2019.\n\nApril 2023: William and Kate celebrate their 12-year wedding anniversary\n\nIn April 2023, William and Kate celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary when they shared a photo of themselves riding bikes together on Instagram.\n\nIn the caption they wrote, \"12 years ❤️.\"\n\nMay 2023: William and Kate attend King Charles III's coronation\n\nIn May 2023, William, Kate and their kids attended Charles' coronation, where the son of Elizabeth was crowned the new monarch.\n\nThe day kicked off with Charles and Camilla’s procession to Westminster Abbey, then the coronation ceremony at the church and the procession back to Buckingham Palace.\n\nAt the palace, the royal family headed to the balcony where they waved to onlookers and watched the Royal Air Force perform a pared-down flyover in the area.\n\nDecember 2023: William and Kate release their Christmas card\n\nKate and William shared a family photo for their 2023 Christmas card.\n\nThe photo shows the couple posing with their three children in Windsor.
