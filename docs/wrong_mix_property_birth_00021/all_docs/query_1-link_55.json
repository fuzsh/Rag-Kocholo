        "text": "Before the Rain\n\nPhotography by Allen Beaulieu\n\nForeword by Dez Dickerson\n\nIntroduction by Jim Walsh\n\nContribution by Eloy Lasanta\n\nMinnesota Historical Society Press ( )\n\nDescription\n\nAn inside look at the early years of Prince, presented through both iconic and never-before-seen images taken by the photographer who was at his side through it all.\n\nPhotographer Allen Beaulieu worked with Prince from the late 1970s into the early ’80s, capturing the musician’s progression from rising star to his ultimate purple superstardom. Always at Prince’s side with camera in hand, Beaulieu helped Prince carry forward his vision with legendary album cover images and promotional photos during the groundbreaking Dirty Mind, Controversy, and 1999 era, while also capturing live performances on tour with Prince.\n\nPrince: Before the Rain puts into focus the hallmark imagery—including behind the- scenes, candid, and casual shots—with recollections from Beaulieu on his personal and professional relationship with Prince. Going deeper into the context of these crucial years, supplemental text brings it all together with reminiscences from former bandmates, including Bobby Z., Dez Dickerson, André Cymone, and more.\n\nPrince: Before the Rain paints another important picture in the mythology of the celebrated, influential, and endlessly invigorating performer while providing an intimate portrait of the Minnesota artist about to take over the world.\n\nAuthor information\n\nAllen Beaulieu was Prince's photographer and friend beginning in the late 1970s. He photographed three album covers and toured extensively with the artist. He also worked for Rolling Stone, for IndyCar racing, and as a fashion photographer.\n\nDez Dickerson is a guitarist, singer, songwriter, producer, and record executive and was a member of the Revolution with Prince from 1978 to 1984. He currently runs Pavilion Synergies, a social marketing and music entertainment company.\n\nJim Walsh is a writer, columnist, journalist, and songwriter from Minneapolis and writer of the liner notes for the 1995 Prince album The Gold Experience and author of The Gold Experience: Following Prince in the '90s.\n\nEloy Lasanta has carved out a niche for himself as a Prince Rogers Nelson historian in the world of music fandoms. As YouTuber \"Prince's Friend,\" he is aligned with the mission of keeping Prince's legacy alive.\n\nReviews and news\n\nPitchfork's Best Music Books of 2018\n\nThe A.V.

He was the only photographer that I ever remember just hanging around with us. Prince trusted him more than anyone since, I think. Al was allowed to be around in the dressing rooms and at rehearsals. . . . He was there in beginning, and we were really close, and he was a punk like we were. I am so glad to see someone unearthing his stuff.”\n\nLisa Coleman\n\n“Working with Al was very natural; it flowed. The magic of how Al worked—and I think it’s the thing that really appealed to Prince—is he had a way of conducting things along without being overbearing or reducing people to action figures or something. It was very organic, and he managed to pull something out of this disparate set of human beings.”\n\nDez Dickerson\n\nThe Current's Rock and Roll Book Club\n\nStar Tribune\n\nCity Pages\n\nTwin Cities Live\n\nPrince's Friend\n\nWCCO TV\n\nInsight News\n\nRock It Poole (UK) Interview\n\nRock It Poole (UK) Video of Electric Fetus Book Launch\n\nKUMD MN Reads\n\nChuck Earling blog\n\ndance/music/sex/romance blog\n\nCNN interview with Allen in 2017\n\nThe Fader\n\nBillboard\n\nMinneapolis Sound News\n\nBBC Manchester\n\nMinneapolis Insider podcast\n\nRelated resources\n\nMNopedia articles\n\nPrince\n\nPaisley Park\n\nFirst Avenue and 7th Street Entry\n\nAfrican Americans in Minnesota\n\nMinnesota History Magazine\n\nThe Purple One\n\nPunkFunkRockPop\n\n​Funky Towns\n\nOther MNHS links\n\nPrince's Purple Rain Costume\n\nPrince Lyrics\n\nFeatured Objects\n\nNew Prince Items Help Document the Life of a Minnesota Musical Icon\n\nNew Prince Artifacts Chronicling His Career Pre-Stardom Join Minnesota Historical Society Collections\n\nImages"
