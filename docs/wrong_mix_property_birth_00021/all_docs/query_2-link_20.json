        "text": "Prince will have a major road named after him in his home town of Minneapolis, after a vote by state politicians.\n\nThe artist, who is known for tracks such as Purple Rain, When Doves Cry and Raspberry Beret, died in 2016 after an accidental fentanyl overdose at age 57.\n\nIn an almost unanimous vote, the road that travels past his Paisley Park museum and studios will be renamed the Prince Rogers Nelson Memorial Highway.\n\nIt is a seven-mile stretch of the Minnesota State Highway 5 that goes through the Minneapolis suburbs of Chanhassen and Eden Prairie.\n\nThe new signs showing the road's name will be purple.\n\nAccording to the bill's lead sponsor, Republican senator Julia Coleman, the friends and family of the star are footing the bill to have the road's name changed.\n\n\"Prince was a true genius, a visionary artist who pushed the boundaries of music and cultures in ways that will never be forgotten,\" Ms Coleman told her fellow senators.\n\n\"His influence can be heard in the work of countless musicians who came after him, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists to this day.\"\n\nBefore his death, the 65,000 square feet Paisley Park was Prince's home and studios, but now draws visitors from around the world as a tourist attraction and site of musical pilgrimage.\n\nPrince's oldest sister, Sharon Nelson, was among those watching the vote take place, with the bill now heading to the state governor's desk - who is expected to approve the move.\n\nMs Nelson said her brother's music will live on forever, adding his spirit \"sneaks up on me sometimes\", urging fans to visit the estate in Minnesota.\n\nRead more:\n\nPrince's estate attacks Trump for playing Purple Rain at campaign rally\n\nNo charges to be brought after Prince's 2016 overdose\n\nPrince's purple is now an official colour called Love Symbol #2\n\nMark Webster, who works in security at the estate and was a long-time friend of Prince, came up with the idea to rename the road. He was among those at the Capitol celebrating the vote.\n\nPrince had his breakthrough in the 1970s, and ended up being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 2004.\n\nAmong other honours, his 1984 album, widely considered to be one of the greatest records ever made, was added to the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nPrince never left a will when he died, meaning his six surviving siblings were designated as his heirs - though three of them ended up selling their interest to the music company Primary Wave."
