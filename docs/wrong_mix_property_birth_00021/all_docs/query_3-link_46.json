        "text": "Prince William and Princess Kate have fascinated the world since they first went public with their relationship nearly two decades ago. Now, the couple have come to be emblematic of the British royal family, representing the kind of stability that Queen Elizabeth II once provided while also acclimating to today’s values and principles.\n\nThey first met as students at St. Andrews University, where William studied geography while Kate, then known as Kate Middleton, studied art history. “I knew there was something very special about her, and then I knew there was possibly something I wanted to explore there, but we ended up being friends for a while,” William recalled during their 2010 engagement interview. “I do genuinely believe now that being friends with [each other] is a massive advantage.”\n\nSince then, William and Kate have experienced massive amounts of change together within the royal family, from Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan’s exit in 2020 to the ascension of King Charles III to the British throne. They have also welcomed three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis.\n\nAhead, we break down the complete timeline of the Prince and Princess of Wales’s decades-spanning love story.\n\n2001: They meet at St. Andrews University.\n\nThe two first met as students at Scotland’s St. Andrews University, where they initially started out as friends. They both studied art history, though William later changed his degree to pursue geography.\n\nSome have speculated that Kate specifically chose to attend St. Andrews University to be in closer proximity to the future king.\n\n“Kate was very strategic,” royal historian Robert Lacey wrote in his 2020 book Battle of Brothers: William and Harry—The Inside Story of a Family in Tumult, per Elle. “She gave up her place at one of Britain’s premier universities, Edinburgh, and opted for another one [St. Andrews] that probably didn’t have the same academic standard. She had already been to Edinburgh to get her flat accommodations sorted out, but switched universities and switched her courses to history of art because that was William’s. She delayed her own education by a year” and took the chance of not getting into St. Andrews, Lacey wrote.\n\nLacey noted that Kate wasn’t the only incoming student who changed her academic plans for William. After William announced his intention to study at St. Andrews, applications reportedly increased by 44 percent.\n\nPrince William visits St. Andrews University’s campus.\n\n2002: They move in together and start dating.\n\nTo start their second year at St. Andrews, Kate and William, along with friends Fergus Boyd and Olivia Bleasdale, moved into a four-bedroom, two-story town house off campus. At this point, the two were still just friends—but not for much longer.\n\nDuring their time as roommates, Kate and William’s relationship took a romantic turn. Rumor has it, William became romantically interested in Kate after seeing her walk the runway for a charity fashion show, wearing a see-through minidress over a bra and underwear set. The dress, designed by Charlotte Todd, later sold at auction for $125,000.\n\nApril 1, 2004: Their relationship becomes public.\n\nAfter about a year of dating, William and Kate’s relationship became public knowledge when The Sun published photos of the two enjoying a ski trip in the Swiss Alps. The breach of privacy led to the then-Prince Charles threatening to sever his media relations with the tabloid.\n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for Charles said he was “very disappointed” by the outlet’s actions and that The Sun would “face the consequences,” according to The Guardian. “They do understand that they have broken the agreement and they are aware they will have to face the consequences. It's not set in stone but that could include being excluded from photo calls.”\n\nPrince Harry, then-Prince Charles, and Prince William pose during a 2002 photo call at Swiss ski resort.\n\nJune 23, 2005: They graduate from St. Andrews.\n\nThe couple ended their journey in higher education together, joining their class of about 260 students for an intimate graduation ceremony. Also in attendance were William’s grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, as well as dad Prince Charles and stepmother Camilla.\n\nApril 1, 2007: They break up.\n\nDuring their 2010 engagement interview, William reflected on his and Kate’s brief time apart. “We were both very young, it was at university, and we were both sort of defining ourselves as such and being different characters,” he said. “It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up.”\n\nKate added, “I at the time wasn’t very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person. You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn’t realized. I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you’re younger, and I really valued that time for me, as well.”\n\nJune 2007: They reconcile.\n\nTheir split was short-lived, with the couple reconciling just a few months later.\n\nRoyal reporter Katie Nicholl in her book Kate: The Future Queen. William, who initiated the breakup, apparently had to convince Kate to get back together with him.\n\n“Kate didn't want to rush anything. She had been badly hurt and told William she needed some time,” Nicholl wrote. When William invited his ex to a costume party, Kate showed up dressed as a “sexy” nurse “in fishnet tights and a short dress.” Subsequently, the prince “followed her around like a lost puppy all night.”\n\nTheir reunion was publicly confirmed when Kate attended the Concert for Diana, organized by William and Prince Harry in honor of the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death, in July 2007.\n\nHarry, William, and Kate watch a rugby match together in 2007.\n\nOctober 20, 2010: William proposes.\n\nWilliam got down on one knee during a romantic getaway the two took to Kenya, where they stayed in a cabin hut on a wildlife reserve about 10,500 feet above sea level.\n\n“We had a little private time away together with some friends, and I just decided that it was the right time, really,” William later said, during their joint engagement interview. “We’d been talking about marriage for a while, so it wasn’t a massively big surprise, but I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya, and I proposed.”\n\nKate said the proposal was “very romantic,” a sentiment that William shared. “It just felt really right to ask in Africa,” he added. “And I had done a little bit of planning of sorts to share my romantic side.”\n\nWilliam popped the question with Princess Diana’s iconic engagement ring: a 12-carat oval sapphire surrounded by a white gold halo featuring 14 solitaire diamonds.\n\nNovember 16, 2010: They publicly announce their engagement.\n\nThe couple formally announced their engagement a month later, when they appeared for a photo call at London’s St. James’s Palace. That same day, they participated in their first televised joint interview to discuss their engagement with ITV’s Tom Bradby.\n\nFebruary 10, 2011: Kate makes her first royal appearance.\n\nKate completed her first-ever duty as a member-to-be of the royal family by joining William on an engagement in Wales. There, the couple helped launch the new Hereford Endeavour lifeboat, which Kate was photographed breaking a bottle of champagne on for good luck.\n\nApril 29, 2011: They get married.\n\nKate officially became Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, upon her Westminster Abbey wedding to Prince William, who formally received the Duke of Cambridge title a few days prior. The highly anticipated nuptials were watched live by over 72 million people across the globe.\n\nFor the grand occasion, Kate wore a fairy-tale lace bridal gown designed by Alexander McQueen’s then–creative director, Sarah Burton. She topped off the look with the Cartier Halo tiara, which she borrowed from the queen. Meanwhile, William wore a red tunic, his military uniform as a colonel of the Irish Guards.\n\nJune 2011: They embark on their first royal tour.\n\nFor their first official trip abroad as a married couple representing the royal family, the two traveled to Canada.
