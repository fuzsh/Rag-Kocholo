        "text": "ROLLINGSTONE BRIAN HIATT, MAY 2, 2016\n\nIt is, in theory, a mundane sight, nothing 2 get excited about: just a 55-year-old man in his suburban Minneapolis workplace, scrolling through a Windows Media Player library on a clunky Dell computer. An equally ordinary multi-line phone sits beside it, near a lit candle, bottled water and some expensive-looking lotion. A huge old Xerox machine looms over the desk; a window at the far end of the room looks out onto barren trees and an empty, snow-lined highway. It’s early evening on Saturday, January 25th, 2014, in Chanhassen, Minnesota.\n\nThe office is on the second floor of the 65,000-square-foot Paisley Park compound. The little guy sitting at the keyboard owns it all, had it all built back in the Eighties. And Prince being Prince, it’s fascinating to watch him do just about anything. The more ordinary the activity – clicking a mouse, say – the weirder it feels. Prince has a large Afro, and he’s dressed in dark, diaphanous layers, with a vest over a flowing long-sleeved shirt, form-fitting grayish-black slacks, and sneakers with high Lucite heels that light up with every step. He’s wearing obvious makeup – foundation, eyeliner, probably more. His thin, precision-trimmed mustache extends just past his lips in a semicircle.\n\nOn characteristically short notice, Prince invited me here to report what we intend to be his seventh Rolling Stone cover story. I spend seven hours at Paisley Park, and he sits for two lengthy, thoughtful, amiable interviews. I was told not to curse or to ask about the past; though I eventually violate both rules, he invites me to join him on the road later. In the end, however, he won’t sit for a photo shoot, instead offering us pre-prepared, heavily retouched pictures. The whole thing falls through. I hold on to my reporting, assuming, all too correctly, that we will save the material for our next Prince cover.\n\nThat night, Prince doesn’t look his age – doesn’t look any particular age, really. He’s very thin, but not fragile – a strict vegan who, by his own account, sometimes doesn’t eat at all (“I have gone long periods with no food, and also water – people have to remind me to drink water because I always forget to do that”). He doesn’t sleep enough, either, and he avoids sex: One of the most deliriously sensual performers who ever lived – the one who sang “Jack U Off” and “Gett Off” and “Do Me, Baby” – insists he’s celibate. His reasons are both religious and “energy”-related (“The hunger turns into something else,” he says), though he maintains close relationships with several young female singer-songwriters. He is, at this stage in his life, a kind of cheerful musical monk. “I am music,” he says. Playing it is his greatest and perhaps only pleasure. But he’s been an ascetic even on that front as of late, recording less than ever, waiting four years between albums. It’ll stand as the longest break of his career.\n\nPrince famously liberated himself from his record deal with Warner Bros. in 1996, and it apparently took him years to realize that his freedom extended to not releasing music. “I write more than I record now, and I also play live a lot more than I record,” he says. “I used to record something every day. I always tease that I have to go to studio rehab.\n\n“I’m a very in-the-moment person,” he continues. “I do what feels good in the moment. … I’m not on a schedule, and I don’t have any sort of contractual ties. I don’t know in history if there’s been any musicians that have been self-sufficient like that, not beholden. I have giant bills, large payrolls, so I do have to do tours. … But there’s no need to record anymore.” He makes a direct connection between fasting, celibacy and his abstention from recording. “After four days, you don’t want food anymore. … It’s like this thing that says, ‘Feed me, feed me.’ When it realizes it’s not going to get fed, it goes away. … It’s the same with music. I had to see what it’s like to stop making albums. And then you go, ‘Oh, wait a minute, I don’t feel the need to do that anymore.’”\n\nPrince brings me up to the office to play tracks from Plectrum-Electrum, the album that would finally break his recording fast. He chose from 100 or so songs laid down in one of the downstairs studios with his recently formed backing band, 3rdEyeGirl – the hardest-rocking ensemble he ever assembled. “All recorded live, no punch-ins,” he says. “You just do it till you get the take you like.” (The album doesn’t come out for another eight months, by which time it’s accompanied by a more traditional Prince LP called Art Official Age.)\n\nPrince and I meet for the first time a few minutes earlier, as he emerges from a rehearsal space with the young women of the band. Hannah Welton, the drummer, a bubbly 23-year-old who looks like Carrie Underwood and plays like John Bonham, introduces herself brightly: “Hi, I’m Hannah!” Prince laughs, not unkindly, and imitates her, chirping “Hi, I’m Prince” in a high voice, as he reaches out a firm, businesslike handshake. His actual speaking voice is deep, soft and calming, like a DJ on a smooth-jazz station.\n\nAs we walk along, he shows no sign of reported double-hip-replacement- surgery – no limp, no cane, no apparent discomfort. His brown eyes are alert, and his wit is quick – looking back, it’s nearly impossible to square his affect with posthumous rumors of an opioid addiction. He claims not to feel the passage of time, and says mortality doesn’t enter his thoughts: “I don’t think about ‘gone.’” To the contrary, he is immersed in the moment, invested in a creative future that he believes will be long and bright. The pause between albums seems to have been healthy for him, as is the youthful, enthusiastic, near-worshipful presence of the 3rdEyeGirl members. For the first time in years, he’s been opening up Paisley Park to local fans for spontaneous events. There’s talk of staging one of these shows on the night of my visit, though it evaporates with no notice.\n\nOn his way upstairs, Prince struts past a hallway decorated with a photographic timeline of his career – there’s “Batdance” Prince, “Slave”-on-his-face Prince and even his 1985 Rolling Stone cover (he notes that he refused to do a photo shoot, so we ran a still from a video that, in his considered opinion, made his teeth look strange). “There’s room for Purple Rain or the Super Bowl here,” he notes of one empty space, murmuring something about eventually turning Paisley Park into a museum. It already seems a bit like one: a huge, dark, nearly empty space with only a skeleton crew on hand.\n\nWe stop at a mural where a painted image of Prince, arms spread, stands astride images of his influences and artists he, in turn, influenced. He tests me, making sure I can recognize Chaka Khan and Sly and the Family Stone, while giving me a pass on missing Tower of Power and Grand Funk Railroad.\n\nPlaying the album in his office, he charmingly takes pains to turn the player’s visualizer function on, providing state-of-2002 fractal accompaniment to the music. On a stand in the corner is a century-old Portuguese guitar with a teardrop-shape body. A Canon telephoto lens with no camera attached sits atop a couple of coffee-table books: Vanity Fair’s Hollywood; Palaces of Naples. The walls of the office are painted in a blue-skies motif, with the words “Dream Style” on one of them. Hanging on another wall is a clock emblazoned with the cover of his 2007 album Planet Earth – the only timepiece of any kind I see anywhere in Paisley Park.\n\nBetween songs, Prince laments the state of a music industry he thinks is focused on anything but music. “You’re trying to find the personality first, make sure you’ve got that locked in,” he says. “And it’s better if they got scandal on ’em or a reality show or sex tape. And they have it down to an art. They’re getting street cred for Justin Bieber now!”\n\nHe puts on one of the album’s poppier tracks, the sweet throwback “Stopthistrain,” with vocals from 3rdEyeGirl drummer Welton and her husband, Josh. I suggest, gently, that the song might fare best on the charts if no one knows of its Prince connection. He nods. “That’s kind of the blessing and a curse these days,” he says, “that I’m competing with [my] older music. And I don’t know anybody who has to do that. They always play Beyoncé’s latest track. But I go on Oprah and they want me to play what they remember.”\n\nHe ends by previewing a couple of songs from what will become Art Official Age, excusing himself from the room when he gets to the wailing ballad “Breakdown.” The breakup-themed lyrics seem particularly personal: “I used to throw the party every New Year’s Eve/First one intoxicated, last one to leave/Waking up in places that you would never believe/Give me back the time, you can keep the memories.” Afterward, he confirms that the song comes from a “sensitive … nude” place: “You could touch it and it would just hurt instantly.”\n\nBefore Prince sits for an interview, there is another test. I sit and chat with the members of 3rdEyeGirl in a cavernous atrium, where the black carpet is decorated with Prince’s old symbol and the words “NPG Music Club,” and the motorcycle from Purple Rain is on display above. We gather on a purple couch that is noticeably frayed, and they explain their unlikely origins. The bassist, taciturn Denmark native Ida Nielsen, arrived first, joining Prince’s bigger funk band, the latest incarnation of the New Power Generation, which he’s still gigging with as well. Prince tells me how she beat out an old bandmate of his who re-auditioned: “She was eight times better than him, and she was new.”\n\nPrince specifically wanted a female band, seeking out members via YouTube – back in 2010, he had discovered Nielsen on MySpace. “We’re in the feminine aspect now,” he says. “That’s where society is. You’re gonna get a woman president soon. Men have gone as far as they can, right? … I learn from women a lot quicker than I do from men. … At a certain point, you’re supposed to know what it means to be a man, but now what do you know about what it means to be a woman? Do you know how to listen? Most men don’t know how to listen.”\n\nI ask 3rdEyeGirl’s guitarist, Donna Grantis, who has a half-shaved head and Hendrixian chops, about her influences. “Prince,” she says, flatly. Her husband, a pleasant rocker dude named Trevor Guy, came along with her and ended up working closely with Prince, serving some managerial functions. (Prince believes artists shouldn’t have managers: “You should be a grown man, be able to man-age yourself.”) Josh, Welton’s husband, an R&B-singer-turned-producer, also became part of the Paisley family, working on some of Prince’s final albums. They’ve all been living in a nearby hotel for a year and a half, spending at least six days a week in Paisley Park. They come off as members of a benign cult. “It’s sort of like an alternate reality,” says Grantis. “It’s an alternate universe being here, because we’re in this awesome bubble of, like, making music all day. I have no idea what the date is or what day it is.”\n\nAs we talk, I glance over my shoulder and realize that Prince has at some point materialized behind me, silently eavesdropping. He nods and moves away again into the darkness. The band and I go into the industrial kitchen, where we’re served dinner, and I am soon summoned into the control room of the complex’s Studio A, where Prince sits at the mixing desk. “This room was built in ’87, and the first record I did in here was Lovesexy,” he says. “We never really got this room clickin’ like any of my home studios or the hot-rodded boards I used in Los Angeles when I had a record deal. It’s real cozy and private – I just kinda wished it sounded like what goes on in my head. And I’ve been tinkering with things forever. … I suppose I will keep messing with it – or another generation will.”\n\nWe talk of many things, and his ban on discussing the past turns out to be slightly flexible. He makes a point of noting that his reputation as the puppet master behind the Time and even Vanity 6 was exaggerated. “It was all collaborative,” he says. “It’s not just my vision. It’s one thing to say, ‘You know what would be cool?’ and visualize it … but then you’ve got to actually find the people. [The Time’s] Morris Day is as good as any funk drummer who ever did it. And Vanity? Nobody could talk like her.” He’s most passionate and lucid when he talks about music: “‘Rock Steady’ by Aretha Franklin, ‘Cold Sweat’ by James [Brown], all the Stax records, Ike and Tina Turner – we took it for granted, thinking that music would always be like that. That was just normal to us.”\n\nThere are frequent, sometimes tricky-to-follow digressions: He seems to have branched out from his study of the Bible, which began in earnest when he became a Jehovah’s Witness under the tutelage of bassist Larry Graham. “It’s just all expanded,” he says. “Anything I believed then, I believe even more now – it’s just expanded.” While still deeply Christian, he’s also spent time studying what appears to be an Afro-centric interpretation of history, along with the physics of sound, some Eastern ideas (chakras are “science,” he says) and a selection of unabashed conspiracy theories. He has thoughts on the JFK assassination (“The car slows down – why doesn’t it speed up?”); AIDS (“It’s rising in some communities, and it’s not rising in others – any primate could figure out why”); and the airplane trails known in some circles as chemtrails (“Think about where they appear, why they appear, how often and what particular times of the year”).\n\nAt one point, the phone rings: It’s the young British singer-songwriter Delilah. Prince’s voice suddenly gets even deeper. “I know it’s late there,” he purrs into the handset. “I’m going to will you awake.” On a possibly related note, Prince says he’s unsure if he’ll marry again. “That’s another thing that’s up to God,” he says. “It’s all magnetism anyway – something would pull me into its gravity, and I wouldn’t be able to get out from it.”\n\nWe take a break and head to Paisley Park’s empty nightclub, where 3rdEyeGirl are waiting onstage. “I can take you out there and hit this guitar for you,” Prince promised earlier, “and what you’ll hear is sex. You will hear something where you’d run out of adjectives, like you do when you meet the finest woman.” He wants to prove that 3rdEyeGirl can activate my chakras, so he seats me on a stool onstage, no more than three feet away from him. He picks up a custom Vox guitar – the brand some of James Brown’s guitarists played. “You’re gonna start vibrating in a second,” he tells me, and kicks the band into the fiery Seventies fusion instrumental “Stratus,” tearing through solos that arc endlessly upward. He warned of goose bumps, and delivers.\n\nAfterward, the band does a photo shoot in Studio C – one shot is intended for the cover of a “Stopthistrain” single that never actually comes out. Prince disappears for a while before returning with a MacBook that has Delilah live on Skype – he shows her the shoot via webcam. It’s past midnight when we begin talking again. He mentions a desire to mentor Chris Brown, says he invited him to Paisley Park. I note that some people think what Brown did to Rihanna was unforgivable. He’s shocked. “Unforgivable?” he says. “Goodness. That’s when we go check the master, Christ. … Have you ever instantly forgiven somebody?” I shake my head. “It’s the best feeling in the world, and it totally dismantles that person’s whole stance.”\n\nHe talks more about mentoring and helping peers, so I wonder aloud if he thinks he could’ve forestalled Michael Jackson’s fate. “I don’t want to talk about it,” Prince says at first. “I’m too close to it.” He goes on: “He is just one of many who have gone through that door – Amy Winehouse and folks. We’re all connected, right, we’re all brothers and sisters, and the minute we lock that in, we wouldn’t let anybody in our family fall. That’s why I called Chris Brown. All of us need to be able to reach out and just fix stuff. There’s nothing that’s unforgivable.”\n\nHe seems to be hinting at past problems of his own, so I ask if he was ever self-destructive. His eyebrows shoot up. “Self-destructive? I mean … do I look self-destructive?” This leads him to a disquisition on why he avoids talking about the past. “People say, ‘Why did you change your name?’ and this, that and the other. I’m here right now, doing what I’m doing right now, and all of the things I did led up to this. And there is no place else I’d rather be than right now. I want to be talking to you, and I want you to get it.”\n\nWe talk about retirement. “I don’t know what that is,” he says. “There’s always some way to serve. … It feels like I’m teaching at a school, but also a student at one. I never felt like I had a job – does that make sense? So those words, ‘job’ and ‘retire’ …”\n\nHe tries to explain why he can imagine playing into old age, with a dizzying detour into mysticism via the Wachowskis. “Life spans are getting longer,” he says. “One of the reasons is because people are learning more about everything, so then the brain makes more connections. Eventually, we’ll be in eternal brain mode because we’ll be able to hold eternity in our minds. A lot of people can’t do that. If you can’t think all the way back eternally, you can’t think all the way forward eternally. Everybody usually thinks about a beginning, a big bang. If you take that event out, then you can start to see what eternity is. Remember in The Matrix where they said the only thing that has an ending had a beginning, and vice versa?”\n\nIt’s nearly 2 a.m., and Prince is done for the night. He walks me through the depths of Paisley Park, his shoes glowing in the dark, to retrieve my jacket and bag. As we walk, I hear doves cry – actual doves that live in a cage somewhere in the rafters. As I put on my coat, Prince invites me to join the band in London. The zipper catches badly on the way up. “Fuck,” I say, and my host looks stricken.\n\n“So much for not cursing,” he says.\n\nI apologize. Prince looks me in the eyes, and wraps me in a tight hug. I am, as promised, dismantled by his instant forgiveness. I can still feel that embrace as I walk outside, where moonlight shines on a thick layer of immaculate, freshly fallen snow.\n\nPlease note that I have taken the liberty of replacing the year “1999” with “2020” for obvious reasons. Everything that Prince spoke about we are experiencing, even more intensely, today.\n\n“IN MAN’S DECISION TO FURTHER SEPARATE FROM GOD HIS RE-CREATION OF HIMSELF LEAVES HIM IN A DYSFUNCTIONAL STATE OF CONFUSION.”\n\n2020, and the illusion continues\n\nOne begs to ask, “When will it end?”\n\nUnnatural disasters happen seemingly every week: Train crashes, shootings, NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS. Is there any place of refuge one can flee from this insanity? Very few of mankind’s creations are designed to make you feel good unless you get pleasure from seeing the human body desecrated by guns, explosions, fights and any other things these so-called “artists” create.\n\n“In man’s decision to further separate from God His re-creation of himself leaves him in dysfunctional state of confusion.”\n\nIn the name of freedom, many have used art as a means to destroy the human mind. As an excuse to continue we hear “Art reflects society.” How many times has this lie been repeated: “creations are not real” they say and yet any one of these people can call to mind images and complete scenes of horror in graphic detail. They will carry these so-called “unreal” creations around with them for the rest of their lives. These images are now a part of their being.\n\nIn the name of recreation these people in fact are recreating themselves in their own images. Society then reflects art. In man’s decision to further separate from God His re-creation of himself leaves him in dysfunctional state of confusion. The mind becomes a burial ground for dead waste. Isolated from the wholeness of God, Earth and his fellow brothers and sisters his man seeks solace in activities he thinks will stimulate his mind.\n\nThe Tree of Knowledge or the Tree of Life?\n\nHe begins downloading into his brain a series of manmade creations designed to destroy it. All manmade creations originate from one of two sources: The Tree of Knowledge or the Tree of Life. One of these trees contained deadly fruit, the other, Fruit of Everlasting Life. The one who disregards this fact recreates himself and his kind into extinction.\n\nYou are reading these words on a machine created by man. As you read, you hear a voice speaking to you the words that you perceive. They make sense to you because you understand (stand under) the spelling. The words are what bind this spell to your illusion.When you hear the truth, like a memory you recognize it and this recognition releases you from all illusion.\n\nMany languages are brilliant in their attempt to confuse you: Con meaning: against; fuse meaning: together. Words and their spellbinding illusions have the power to keep man separate from God. You were born in an all-knowing state of mind. The first words spoken to you begin the spell. The words come from one of two sources: The Tree of Knowledge or the Tree of Life.\n\n“This creates a pyramid-like structure with the dictator on top …”\n\nIn ignorance or simply lack of respect for God, many use words that confuse the minds of humans and turn them into projections of their own illusions. Because of this fact, many people grow up and blindly assume their pre-selected role under a dictatorship without even being aware of it. When asked what they are doing here on earth, most will answer with statements that do not reflect their natural God-given desires. This creates a pyramid-like structure with the dictator on top and each level under it knowing less and less. Upon reaching the bottom level, which is where the majority is you will find chaos, disorder, and illusion. With ill as its prefix, illusion is a state of insanity. In the name of democracy, supreme power is vested unto the people in this insane state instead of God.\n\nA future re-created, to be ruled by man, is one of isolation and despair. Returning the leadership back into God will allow mankind to achieve its original collective goal, which is union with God.\n\nIdeas contrary to this goal should not be blamed or persecuted, just simply ignored. They originated when man first chose to ignore God’s rule. Simply put, in the beginning, the Human was made perfect in God’s image.\n\nThey had no need for knowledge. They were also given freedom of choice. The Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life are reflections of this freedom. The human is now a reflection of their choice.\n\nThey could have simply chose not to choose. God being centrifugal in nature, freedom was the cause and choice was the effect. In knowing their perfection made in God’s image, there was no need to choose. In fact, their were no needs. There was only love in an all-knowing state before the fall.

How could we not be? Not only is Kirk a superlative player and a great guy, but his favorite axe is one of the rarest–and coolest–Kalamazoo-made Epi electrics, the Crestwood. Kirk has been performing steadily with his ’61 Crestwood for years with The Roots as well as many other music endeavors.\n\nSo when Kirk’s longtime favorite musician Prince appeared on Late Night and borrowed his prized ’61 Crestwood to perform “Bambi,” Kirk was thrilled. And so were we when we saw the performance. Prince on an Epiphone? Fantastic!\n\nBut then came the mother-of-all guitar tosses–a true iconic rock and roll TV moment–but not the kind you want to be part of. At the end of “Bambi” in a moment of performance bravado, Prince threw down the Crestwood and crack went the headstock, and crack went Kirk’s heart (and ours too). Within minutes, word of the incident went out around the world: How dare he? What was Prince thinking?\n\nThere have been rumors and misquotes for months about what really happened. So, during our recent visit to the Big Apple to check out Crossroads, we stopped by the Late Night studio at 30 Rock on Kirk’s invitation to hear the true story, once and for all.\n\nSo Kirk, set the record straight. What happened?\n\nBasically, Prince arrived to sound check sans guitar. I guess his guitar was on its way and in the meantime, he had to do a sound check. Our stage manager, Keith, offered Prince one of my guitars for him to play. I had several guitars there and this guitar, my Epiphone Crestwood, was one of them.\n\nI think to him it had a very inviting strap, given its purple hue, so he went for this guitar. I think, too, that Keith offered it to him because of how it looked. I’ve never seen one like this and people have been so cool after the incident to forward me information about these available from this year, which is ’61 or ’62.\n\nAnd so he used the Crestwood for soundcheck. Then his guitar arrived and Prince finished soundcheck with his guitar. Just before the show, Keith came to me and said: “Prince would like to use your guitar for the performance and would like to buy it from you.”\n\nI replied he can certainly use it but he most definitely cannot buy it from me and then my guitar disappeared for a moment and then came back to me moments later after the rehearsal break.\n\nAnd then Prince came on. I was very excited to see him do the first song. He then came to me and said: “you’ll let me see that other guitar?” And I’m enough of a Prince fan to respond: “yeah!” He asks to see my guitar in between his two performances. And then he went on to play the song and he’s playing “Bambi,” a Prince classic, and he’s playing my guitar and I can’t express how amazing it was to see that.\n\nThis is your baby, after all.\n\nYeah! It was amazing just to hear the tones that I’m so familiar with–hear these tones–reimagined sonically by his hand and it sounded amazing. At the end of the song, I thought he was going to play behind his head because he took the guitar off like this (demonstrates) but he kept going and then I just saw the thing sail in the air I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing when it came flying to the ground.\n\nPrince has done this before.\n\nYes, in the past, he’s pretty famous for tossing guitars in the air and someone being there to catch it. Since this incident, I’ve heard from several people that he’s taken other people’s guitars and tossed them and not arranged for anyone to catch it. He’d take care of it in some way later. But he’s built a career of sort of being eccentric and it’s one of those ways he expresses his eccentricities.\n\nAnd I do think he was in the moment and sort of… I don’t think good judgment was going on in his mind but there’s a point when you’re making music and somebody like him just ceases to be and you’re just the sound that you’re making. I guess it probably sounds like I’m making excuses for him. But who knows what goes on in the mind of the person who conceived the movie Purple Rain? Just look at his entire career! There were numerous head scratchers and this is another one of them. This time I was the recipient of the inconvenience.\n\nSo what happened immediately after the incident?\n\nRight after this happened I went right into the control room and he was there and he apologized and he said he would take care of it. And still I was holding the broken guitar and I did ask him for him to sign it. I said, “well, you broke it, can you at least sign it?” To which responded: “No, I haven’t signed anything since the 70s.” So, when I look at that, it’s like damn do I have a story! Just like Dave Chappelle had his Prince story or Kevin Smith had his Prince story, I now have my own run-in.\n\nBut the most amazing part of it is, the only reason this guitar was in this building for him to get anywhere near was because I was using the Epiphone guitar for a tribute to Prince at Carnegie Hall the following week. The whole reason the guitar was in the building was for the man who broke the guitar (laughs). So, you gotta have a sense of humor about stuff like that. I just imagine the Gods laughing at me.\n\nDo think Prince wanted to buy the guitar because he was already considering that he might throw it down after the performance?\n\nThat could easily have been the case. He could have been thinking: I like this guitar. I wanna throw it at the end of the show and I’ll buy it from him to make it all good. But I have my own attachments to this guitar for my own reasons.\n\nWhat is the story behind your Epiphone Crestwood?\n\nI found this guitar years ago, probably in 2004, at 30th Street Guitars in New York from a guy named Matt Brewster, who also put it back together. And I felt good with him doing that since I bought it from him in the first place. And ever since I bought it from him, he periodically jokes and asks to buy it back from me because he knows how special it is, too. I remember going to the store when I plugged it in, I was blown away by its singularity and tone. It had a beautiful snarly sound to it and if you look at the pickups here, these are the pickups normally found in Firebirds, they say Gibson on them. So much of this guitar is not original.\n\nI always say if I had the opportunity to live life again and go through everything again, I’d be happy to relive this experience because of the dialogue that it’s created, because of the people who have reached out to me expressing their condolences about it. People reached out to say how much they felt for me as fellow musicians and how they would feel if something like that happened to them. A lot of people said it felt like it did happen to them because they know me. So that was good to hear from people. It was great to hear the dialogue created by this. When something like this happens, do you go and frame the instrument? Some people said “you gotta leave it like this!”\n\nI’m not sure there’s been an incident like this in the era of instant Social Media. Everyone loves Prince and everyone loves The Roots so the word went out very fast.\n\nWe all went through something there, seeing an ugly side of someone that you admire. But for reasons like Epiphone reaching out to me and expressing their condolences–it was great. I didn’t even know that these were being reissued. I wouldn’t have found out as quickly. So yeah, it was an example of how social media is all-accessible to us and how positive it can be. As far as having a dialogue with such a large group of people without leaving my apartment, I could participate in my life with my wife and my kids and in the middle of that, I’m hearing from Vernon Reid from Living Colour and Pete Stroud from Sheryl Crow’s band and I’m hearing from Prince fans–I’m hearing from so many people. And that was so cool. There was a feeling of unity that came about from this. And then when the guitar came back and it was repaired, I felt a renewed sense of attachment because I went through something else with it.\n\nIn the end, It wasn’t freaking that hard. Part of it was the emotion about the incident. This guitar has a special tone and I’ve made recordings with it that I hope will one day will come out.\n\nWith the Roots?\n\nActually with my band the Dust Rays, which is an opportunity for me to just plug into an amp and turn it up. It’s my chance to be Marty McFly, standing in front of a huge amplifier.\n\nWhenever you find a guitar and it reacts with a particular amplifier, it’s really special. There’s a real union there. There are a lot of guitars out there but this Epiphone is special to me. I think of all the people who have played it, all the people who have played it before me, and whoever did these customizations. It’s a total mystery to me and all I have with me now is all those vibes to put into a recording. That’s something I want to live on. It was a complete honor for Prince to play this guitar but I can’t give him the honor of being the last person to play this guitar. So that’s why it was such a joy to have it back. And I actually got the Epiphone back just hours before the tribute concert. And Prince totally made good on it and took care of it. I don’t regret Prince borrowing the guitar. Sometimes, what seems like something negative can turn positive and this was definitely a blessing in a very heavily shrouded disguise.\n\nWill The Roots be staying with Jimmy Fallon when he takes over the Tonight Show?\n\nWhat I keep hearing is The Roots are going along for the ride, too. And I’m really happy about that. I’m happy we’re staying in New York, and I’m happy the show recognizes us as being part of the fabric and I feel really honored and blessed to be a part of it.\n\nHarriette Cole, The Root, 4/25/16\n\nI first saw Prince as an audience member back in 1981, when I was on a first date. My proper Bermudian beau and I had dressed in our Sunday best. We awkwardly sat front and center in orchestra seats watching this superhuman little being gyrate across the stage performing music that defied anything I had heard before. When the Purple One jumped to the highest pillar of his stage, grabbed a guitar and ejaculated light into the audience, I thought I was going to turn purple myself. Barely 20 years old and far more naive than my tender age belied, I dared not look at my date for fear that he might imagine that any such thing might happen with us!\n\nWhile we do not have a piano today (my daughter has chosen to play the cello), I will never forget his generosity. Prince gave, endlessly, usually privately, with no need or desire for acknowledgment. As much as he was a wildly sexual being, he was also a consummate gentleman and visionary.\n\nOur connector was Tavis Smiley, his unlikely ace. Tavis was slated to do the interview. After Prince and I met and immediately dove deep into talking about God, spirituality, the cosmos and politics, he decided that I was going to do the honors. Never mind that interviewing Prince meant hand-scribbling notes, attempting to capture his transcendent funk poetry because his paranoid ass refused to let me record anything electronically.\n\nWe made magic during our brief time together. He did what he did best. He mesmerized us with his sense of self, with his specificity, with his good manners, with his musical artistry, with all that made Prince Prince. He liked us, the Ebony team, and kept us with him well into the night, even performing, with a few band members on his soundstage, some songs he had been working out only hours earlier.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, after I left Ebony and reopened my own business, I got a call from Prince’s manager wanting to know what I was doing and if I would be interested in doing some work with them. Huh? He invited me to join the Welcome 2 America tour to interview the opening acts, with the intention of creating a publication featuring them. An easy yes. There was Maceo Parker (James Brown’s No. 1 man), Esperanza Spalding (before her Grammy), Cassandra Wilson (whom I knew from my Essence days), Chaka Khan (who couldn’t have been more forthcoming), Mary J. Blige (my former client), Mint Condition (his homeboys) and the list goes on.\n\nPrince announces the Welcome 2 America Tour at The Apollo on October 14, 2010\n\nI relished intimate moments with these legends, but mostly I enjoyed being with Prince. He was brilliant beyond definition. His mind worked differently from that of anyone else I’ve met. He often spoke in riddles. Well-read puzzles that called upon the listener/participant to think bigger thoughts.\n\nPeople describe him as shy. Not. He was the freest spirit I have ever met. He was private, fiercely so. But in his controlled personal space he enjoyed soaring the clouds of history, music, racial tension, black life and the future of our people. He loved challenging people on their beliefs, especially religious ones. He was unafraid to discuss any topic, and generally he had far more insight on any topic than anyone else in the room.\n\nThe greatest lesson I learned from Prince was that anything good is possible now. Prince did not clock time the way others do. His sense of now was often literally now. Like when we were already on the Welcome 2 America tour and he decided to host 21 nights of concerts at the Forum in Los Angeles with all $25 tickets so that the folks could afford to attend. He damn near drove the promoter LiveNation crazy with this impossible requirement, even firing them for a spell. He put his high-heeled foot down and said it would happen.\n\nAt the same time, he implored me and my friend Paula Madison, whom I had introduced to him, to make a documentary of the groundbreaking moment that was about to happen. Paula happened to own a cable channel, so even though we were days away from the opening of the shows at the Forum, we did it. We transformed the decaying space into a film studio, interviewed everybody from George Lopez to Chaka Khan, edited and aired a special on Paula’s Africa Channel, all within a week. And we were nominated for an NAACP Image Award. We did the impossible because Prince did not believe in impossible. He imbibed the heartbeat of possibility in the now.\n\nI have a thousand amazing memories of this amazing man. Perhaps the most tender is when he took time out from directing a rehearsal in Los Angeles to talk to my daughter, who was then about 7. She had been learning one of his songs in school, and I had told him. He rode his bike over to see her just before a rehearsal and said, “I hear you are learning one of my songs in school.”\n\nWith eyes wide open, she quietly said, “Yes, ‘Starfish and Coffee.’”\n\nHe countered, “Well, I will change the playlist tonight and add that song. Will you perform it with me?”\n\nTo which her eyes grew to saucer size and she stammered, “I haven’t memorized all the words yet.”\n\nPrince said, “I don’t want you to sing it, I want you to play. Do you play the piano?”\n\nShe said, “I am learning.”\n\nPrince: “Every princess must learn to play the piano,” and then he looked to my husband and me and added, “Every home should have a piano. It brings good energy and helps to grow the plants.”\n\nI loved the awake-all-night year that I spent traveling the country with him. I will never forget the gut-level conviction he had that we are all expressions of God and that we all should step up and live our God selves. And now that he is gone, I remember the haunting lines of a song he sang beautifully, though he did not write: “What if God was one of us?”\n\nHarriette Cole is the author of the book of meditations 108 Stitches: Words We Live By and a contributing editor at The Root. Follow her on Twitter.\n\nBy Duane Tudahl, The Current, December 20, 2017\n\nTo truly understand Prince, it is important to not just enjoy his music: it is vital to listen to it, study it, absorb it, and place it in the proper context of his life. Throughout Prince’s career, he often spoke in riddles and misdirection, laying the groundwork for confusion and contradiction, but his music, in its purest form, provided keys that unlocked his private thoughts and chronicled the highs and lows of his amazing career.\n\nIt is impossible to describe Prince without using words like “genius” and “talented,” but it is also fairly common to add “mysterious,” “private,” and even “reclusive” because at the peak of his popularity he gave very few interviews, so people assumed they couldn’t understand him. That behavior functioned to maintain some mystery about him, but even if he was less than forthcoming about his life, there was one place that his words could be clearly heard.\n\nAccording to Prince, “I’ve always been honest in my music.”\n\nLet’s go back to December 1984. Prince was in the middle of the biggest tour of his life and riding high on the success of Purple Rain. The movie and the album had been released earlier in the year and were so successful that few could imagine what it would be like to be Prince.\n\nPrince was, in every aspect of his career, an artist — and like many in the arts, he enjoyed sharing his most recent works with the world because it best represented where he was at that moment, and at this moment in his life he was on a new spiritual path. However, the Purple Rain Tour was structured so that he was performing what people expected him to play. Many of these “new” songs were actually years old and had been recorded, rehearsed, filmed, edited, reviewed, revised, rehearsed again, and performed live in concert as a stage version of his movie.\n\n“I nearly had a nervous breakdown on the Purple Rain Tour because it was the same every night,” Prince explained to the Chicago Tribune. “It’s work to play the same songs the same way for 70 shows.”\n\nThe tightly choreographed tour was proving to be frustratingly claustrophobic for him and that was reflected in his personal life, which found him withdrawing from the outside world with the exception of those closest to him in the eye of his storm. Prince was hungry for something new, even if that meant wrapping up the Purple Rain celebration prematurely. “We looked around and I knew we were lost,” Prince revealed to Paper Magazine. “There was no place to go but down. You can never satisfy the need after that.”\n\nPrince had recently explained to his band and his management that after this tour, he was going to take some time off from the road so he could “look for the ladder,” a spiritual quest that can only be done privately. Few outside his core group understood that, despite having four more months left of the tour, he was secretly finished withPurple Rain and was ready to move on.\n\nInstead of celebrating his new success, he had been spending his time creating the follow-up to Purple Rain, an album called Around the World in a Day. After a Christmas Eve matinee show in his hometown of Minneapolis, Prince spent the rest of the night and part of Christmas morning putting the final touches on the record, a collection of music that expressed this spiritual journey. Like the album itself, Prince’s world seemed filled with joy, regret, fresh love and conflicts — both internal and external — and the album’s lyrics projected hints of his isolation, with five of the nine tracks containing words like “loneliness,” “alone,” and “lonely.”\n\nAccording to those around him, after he decided on the structure of the Around the World in a Day album, Prince spent Christmas at his home alone, probably using the quiet to recharge his batteries away from distractions. The following night he performed a song called “Another Lonely Christmas” during his show at the St. Paul Civic Center — right before playing “Purple Rain.” Although he’d recorded the seasonal track the previous February, the theme of the song, spending Christmas alone, seemed to accurately reflect his emotional state at that moment. This was the first and last time he performed the track for an audience.\n\nLabel art for ‘Another Lonely Christmas,’ the B-side of Prince’s 1984 ‘I Would Die 4 U’ 12-inch single. (Warner Bros.)\n\nOver the previous two years, Prince had grown from cult hero to international superstar, and along the way he had selectively invited a small circle of people into his life who shared his vision and helped him achieve his goals, but more than a few were left behind in the wake of his new success. Many of them had known him as far back as high school and felt able to voice their opinions directly to him, but as his fame grew he distanced himself from several of those who were influential to his music — including his former girlfriend Vanity, bandmate Dez Dickerson, his home engineer Don Batts, his childhood best friend Andre Cymone, and members of his protege band the Time, including Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Jesse Johnson, Monte Moir, and Morris Day.\n\nAs a result, Prince would be drawn closer to the ever-shrinking group of people he had chosen to know him intimately — not just physically but emotionally, which was likely the hardest part of himself to share. The reality was that once those who had been close to him were gone and contact between Prince and the outside world became limited, he would have to be even more selective about those who helped him create his music. “He became a little more paranoid with newer people coming in,” acknowledges Jill Jones. “He didn’t understand who to really trust. And as it progressed on, I think he had a harder time.”\n\n“The amount of security at that time was over the top,” agrees the tour’s lighting director Roy Bennett. “This was the beginning of the negative side, because up to that point there was always this interrelationship between the band and the crew. Although the band still associated, it was just between Prince and everybody else, and all of a sudden a wall came up. He retreated quickly because he saw what was happening. He’s a complex man.”\n\nDuring this period, Prince chose not to do interviews with the press, so his music spoke for him, allowing him another layer of privacy. All of this was by design resulting in the insulated world where his genius shined. “In order to write that much, and be that prolific, you must protect your psyche, because you go to this dangerous place, really easily and often,” explained his engineer Susan Rogers. “You put up a wall, and you tell your management, ‘Don’t let anyone approach me. Here’s the system that allows me to create. These are my people who I’m familiar with. These are my places.’ That allows you to have a very long career, because you’ve figured out an armor to protect yourself.”\n\nPrince was never completely gregarious by nature and the white-hot spotlight that shined on him ended up isolating him even more. He withdrew from people to maintain his focus. Perhaps he recorded so many songs not just because he wrote so often, but maybe it was because he had so much to say and his songs were the avenue to conduct the conversation in the way he knew best.\n\nPrince explained to El Pais in 1996: “When I write a song, it’s my spirit speaking.”\n\nIf you want to know Prince, put on some headphones and truly listen to the story he was telling. Even though he is gone, he left many of his most intimate thoughts waiting to be unlocked by someone willing to do the work.\n\nAs he himself said, “All my life is in my records.”\n\nDuane Tudahl is a documentary director and producer and the author of the recently released Prince and the Purple Rain Era Studio Sessions 1983-1984 (Rowman Littlefield publishing).\n\nJIM WALSH, Southwest Journal, March 10, 2015\n\nWhen Gene Andersen saw the photo of Prince’s junior high school basketball team flying around the Internet last week, he said, “I’ve had that photo for 40 years. I might’ve even taken it, I can’t remember for sure.”\n\nThe 1971 Bryant Junior High basketball team included (front row, right-to-left) Russell Gary, Herb Wilburn, Joey Wilburn, Prince Rogers Nelson, and (back row) Greg Boone, Calvin Anderson, Duane Nelson and Paul Mitchell. Credit:\n\nWhat Andersen does remember for sure is his days as basketball coach at Bryant Junior High, the feeder school for the former Central High School that, in the early- and mid-‘70s, was located at the current Sabathani Community Center at 310 E. 38th Street. No school basketball team existed at Bryant at the time, until Andersen helped launch an after-school intramural program.\n\n“In 1968 they were having some trouble at Central High School as a result of some of the crap that was going on in this country,” said Andersen, 73, a grandfather of three who taught for 32 years in the Minneapolis school system and now lives in Taylors Falls with his wife Marian, who once upon a time ran Guse Hardware and wrote and published The Guse News, a lively and informative one-sheet straight outta the corner store on 46th and Bryant.\n\n“I started teaching social studies and geography in 1969, and we had all these little boys in this school and the principal was looking for someone to run the intramural program after school and I volunteered. That’s how I got to know these kids,” said Andersen. “Some nights we’d have a hundred kids show up. It grew and grew and grew and so I started putting them all on teams and gave ‘em all NBA team names and my classroom was right next to the boy’s gym. I put the schedules on the gym door and all these kids would just be looking at it and looking at it, and we’d have games three nights a week after school.\n\n“What was happening in the Minneapolis public schools then was that all the athletics money went to the senior highs, and the junior highs didn’t get anything. But yet, 13- and 14-year-olds have all that energy and they needed something to do. We came up with a play-off situation and all that, and the kids just loved it.”\n\nEventually, Andersen and crew outgrew intramural play and wanted to play other schools in Minneapolis – though no money existed to support a team.\n\n“Somehow we came up with the money and I contacted Folwell and Sanford and some of those other schools, and they all had similar experiences going on. So we all put together traveling basketball teams and that’s what you see in this picture,” said Andersen.\n\n“We had to come up with money to buy the uniforms, but nobody had any money. So the principal chipped in a few bucks, I chipped in some, the kids might’ve even chipped in, and I went over to St. Mane [Sporting Goods] over by Roosevelt High School and got the cheapest things I could get. They were green and white and we were able to give ‘em a little pair of shorts and a shirt with a number on the back and those kids were so happy. It was really fun.”\n\nThe picture’s most famous ballplayer is Prince, which is why it went viral last week, and why members of Prince nation are undoubtedly lusting after Bryant #3 throwback jerseys right about now. For added clickbait, the Deadspin article that blew up the Jon Bream-penned StarTribune clip came with the headline, “Prince was once an afro-rocking, coach-hating high school basketball player.”\n\nCoach-hating?\n\n“I don’t know who said that, but I never saw that. I never felt that at all,” said Andersen. “He had a little bit of an attitude, but what junior high kid doesn’t? In my estimation, he was a normal junior high kid and he was with a bunch of guys who were really good guys.\n\n“I told him to study, and you know how a 13- and 14-year-old kid can be. He was already getting accolades for his music from people, about how good he was. And I was always trying to keep him on the ball and off the streets and I’d just goof with him, ‘Man, you’re smart, you can make it wherever you go.’ I did tell him I didn’t think he could live off of his music; ‘Do something you can live off of.’\n\n“But on my little basketball team, when we needed to kill something, we’d give the ball to Prince. He could dribble like crazy. He’s a real good athlete. He just didn’t have the size that some of those other kids did, but he was quick, and he was really smart. He didn’t have to study too hard to do junior high work; he’d do it once and he had it. I always said, ‘Make sure you put your education before music,’ and he was like, ‘Yeah, sure.’”\n\nIn addition to being one of the first photos of Prince, the yearbook photo is historic for the fact that it includes future members of Central’s 1975-76 basketball team, long regarded as one of the best high school basketball teams in the state: Greg Boone, who was runner-up to Kevin McHale for Mr. Basketball in 1976; Prince’s late half-brother Duane Nelson, a smooth Puma-wearing shooting guard; the equally smooth Wilburn brothers; Russell Gary, who played football for Nebraska and was an all-pro defensive back in the NFL with New Orleans and Pittsburgh, and others – Larry Travis, Matt Bolden, Kenny Trawick, Gary Fisher – whose names roll off Anderson’s tongue like he coached them yesterday.\n\n“We had some kids on that team that were some of the best athletes to ever go through the Minneapolis school system,” he said. “Calvin Anderson was a man-child, he was our center. He was an offensive guard at the University of Nebraska. Robbie Robertson, who was the football coach at North, where I was towards the end of my career, said that Calvin Anderson was maybe the best athlete he’s seen in 30 years.\n\n“I was a teacher for 32 years in the Minneapolis school district, and this team happened in the first couple years I was teaching. This may have been the best group of boys I’ve ever seen, as a group, and not only were they good athletes, they were good students. They were good people, and somehow or another, through all the chaos those kids went through, they were there on that team.\n\n“They all hung together, and Prince hung with those kids all the time, but he was kind of his own guy. He was already starting a little band, and [Time member and Flyte Time and Jam and Lewis co-founder] Terry Lewis from North High School – he won the 100-yard-dash in the state tournament – he and Prince and all those guys were starting to form up and getting together to jam, even in junior high.”\n\nIn terms of a budding genius’s initial inspiration, it’s hard to beat the combination of a high school basketball powerhouse made up of peers and the music of the day (Parliament-Funkadelic, Ohio Players, Al Green, Earth, Wind & Fire, Marvin Gaye, Wild Cherry, Stevie Wonder), all of which led to a career as Minneapolis’s most well-known and influential musician – the fruits of which Prince’s old coach has never partaken in.\n\n“I’ve heard his music but I’ve never seen one of his performances,” said Andersen. “The only other time I’ve ever talked about this is one night when ‘Purple Rain’ was about to come out, some guy from the New York Times called me at home and said ‘I heard you had Prince in school, what was he like?’ I said, ‘If you’re looking for dirt, you’ve come to the wrong place because he was a good kid.’ He was a smart kid. He was a very smart kid and he pretty much paid attention to business in school.”"
