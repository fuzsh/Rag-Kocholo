        "text": "Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9 people who married into the British royal family: from Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton, to Italian property CEO Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and Jack Brooksbank, who once worked with George Clooney\n\nSTORYFaye Bradley\n\nNov 21 , 2023\n\nThe British royal family members get plenty of press, but sometimes it’s their spouses that garner the most attention.\n\nFor example, Prince Harry’s wife Meghan Markle or Prince William’s wife Kate Middleton. From their style to their pre-royal life, it’s often the non-blue-bloods whose every move attracts the public’s attention. After all, they used to be just like us, right?\n\nWhether you’re watching The Crown season six or not, you may already be familiar with some of the most recognisable names who have joined the clan. Here’s an update and a who’s who of the British royal family members’ partners as of 2023:\n\n1. Queen Camilla\n\nSpouse: King Charles\n\nCamilla, now 76, has been in the public eye for years, having met husband-to-be Charles for the first time in 1970. She too comes from a wealthy background.\n\nAs queen consort, Camilla continues to play an important role as a working royal. She is the 75-year-old monarch’s second wife, after the late and much-loved Princess Diana.\n\n2. Kate Middleton\n\nSpouse: Prince William\n\nKate Middleton, aka the Princess of Wales, may be known as a gracious and ever-elegant British royal today, but before she joined the family, she was a socialite and party girl who used to go out on the town with her sister Pippa.\n\nThe 41-year-old ended up living the fairy tale when she married Prince William, now also 41, in 2011.\n\n3. Meghan Markle\n\nSpouse: Prince Harry\n\nMarkle, 42, is probably one of the most famous – though perhaps not the most popular – newbies to join the British family.\n\nThe Hollywood actress married Prince Harry, 39 – who was something of a former party boy himself – in 2018. They’ve since caused a stir by “stepping back as senior royals” in January 2020, and moving to California to raise their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.\n\n4. Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh\n\nSpouse: Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh\n\nSophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, 58, has been married to Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, 59, the youngest sibling of King Charles, since 1999.\n\nShe previously worked in public relations. The couple share a 20-year-old daughter, Lady Louise Windsor.\n\n5. Timothy Laurence\n\nSpouse: Anne, Princess Royal\n\nThe second child and only daughter of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip married Timothy Laurence, 68, her mum’s former equerry, in 1992, per Town & Country Mag.\n\nNow 73, Anne shares two children, Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips with her first husband, British equestrian Mark Phillips.\n\n6. Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester\n\nSpouse: Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester\n\nDanish-born Birgitte is married to 79-year-old Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who, like Queen Elizabeth, is one of George V’s grandchildren. They have three children.\n\n7. Katharine, Duchess of Kent\n\nSpouse: Prince Edward, Duke of Kent\n\nThe Duchess of Kent rarely makes public appearances, but this year she stepped out to celebrate her 62nd wedding anniversary with her husband, Prince Edward.\n\nKatharine, 90, and Prince Edward, 88, have been married since 1961. They have three kids and one of their grandchildren, Lady Amelia Windsor, has been making waves as an environmental activist. Amelia is also signed with Storm Models.\n\n8. Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\n\nSpouse: Princess Beatrice\n\nPrincess Beatrice, 35, is technically not a working royal, but she’s been a notable member of the famous British family for years. The daughter of the disgraced Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson tied the knot with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 39, in 2020. According to Town & Country Mag, Mozzi hails from a noble Italian family and is the CEO of a property firm.\n\n9. Jack Brooksbank\n\nSpouse: Princess Eugenie\n\nBeatrice’s sister Eugenie, 33, is married to Jack Brooksbank, 37, who also reportedly has aristocratic connections. Per the Evening Standard, he used to work as a European Commercial Manager for George Clooney’s tequila brand Casamigos. The Hollywood actor runs the business with Cindy Crawford’s husband Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman.\n\nIt’s odd to think these royals were once ‘normal people’ before marrying into the world’s most famous family – from Prince William’s wife Kate Middleton to Princess Anne’s husband Timothy Laurence\n\nKing Charles’ second wife after Princess Diana, Queen Camilla, has known her monarch husband for over half a century, while Katharine, Duchess of Kent has been married to Prince Edward for over 60 years"
