        "text": "Today marks the 50th anniversary of beloved Minneapolis nightclub, First Avenue. Of course, one of the reasons this club has become as iconic as it is, is due to the legacy left by hometown hero, Prince. Throughout the '80s, Prince made a name for First Avenue while simultaneously, First Avenue made a name for Prince. Whether it was due to the club's appearance in the movie Purple Rain, or because so many Minnesotans associate their memories of Prince with First Avenue, the combination of this artist and this venue is dynamic. In celebrating 50 years of First Avenue, it feels important to pay tribute to Prince and talk about his various performances at the venue throughout the years.\n\nMarch 9, 1981\n\nPrince's first performance at First Avenue, back when it was still called Sam's, was in 1981 for a sold-out room. Prince was still a budding solo artist nationally, but in Minneapolis, he had a lot of buzz behind his name. It was rare for Prince to perform a hometown show; when he did, it was a big deal. The crowd at this show knew that Prince was about to blow up.\n\nSetlist\n\nDo It All Night\n\nWhy You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\n\nGotta Broken Heart Again\n\nBroken\n\nWhen You Were Mine\n\nSexy Dancer\n\nSister\n\nI Wanna Be Your Lover\n\nHead\n\nStill Waiting\n\nPartyup\n\nUptown\n\nCrazy You\n\nGotta Stop (Messin' About)\n\nDirty Mind\n\nEncore:\n\nEverybody Dance\n\nBambi\n\nOctober 5, 1981\n\nThis gig was essentially a warm-up for Prince's Controversy Tour. It wasn't very heavily promoted; in fact, Prince and his band were listed as \"Controversy\" on the bill. The show ended up selling out simply by word of mouth. It also was the debut of bassist Mark Brown, often known as BrownMark.\n\nSetlist:\n\nSexuality\n\nWhy You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\n\nJack U Off\n\nHead\n\nAnnie Christian\n\nDirty Mind\n\nLet's Work\n\nControversy\n\nPartyup\n\nMusic History Spotlight: Prince’s First Avenue debut on March 9, 1981\n\nMarch 8, 1982\n\nThis was a late night show that followed a performance from jazz fusion band Defunkt. In fact, Defunkt were asked to end their show early so that Prince could perform.\n\nSetlist:\n\nBambi\n\nAll The Critics Love U In New York\n\nWhen You Were Mine\n\nSexy Dancer\n\nStill Waiting w/ Sue Ann Carwell\n\nHead\n\nSexuality\n\nDance To The Beat\n\nThe Stick\n\nPartyup\n\nAugust 3, 1983\n\nTwo years after Prince's sold-out show at the venue formerly known as Sam's, Prince returned to First Avenue, now officially rebranded to the be the venue we know and love today. This was the show at which recordings of songs including \"Purple Rain\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" were used on the Purple Rain soundtrack. The show was also quite a successful fundraiser for Minnesota Dance Theatre, raising $23,000.\n\nSetlist:\n\nLet's Go Crazy\n\nWhen You Were Mine\n\nA Case of You (Joni Mitchell cover)\n\nComputer Blue\n\nDelirious\n\nElectric Intercourse\n\nAutomatic\n\nI Would Die 4 U\n\nBaby I'm a Star\n\nLittle Red Corvette\n\nPurple Rain\n\nD.M.S.R.\n\nOn this Day in 1983, Prince played “Purple Rain” for the first time\n\nJune 7, 1984\n\nAfter the Purple Rain tour, Prince returned to First Avenue in June of 1984 to perform a surprise birthday party. Setlist: 17 Days Our Destiny Roadhouse Garden All Day, All Night Free Noon Rendezvous Erotic City Something in the Water (Does Not Compute) When Doves Cry Encore: Happy Birthday to You Irresistible Bitch Possessed\n\nAugust 14, 1984\n\nIt wasn't uncommon for Prince's shows to be scheduled last-minute and only advertised by word of mouth. This show was no different, in that sense. Of course, despite the lack of advertising, the club was packed, so much so that police had to manage the crowd. The show took place on a Tuesday night, which meant that members got into the club for free with a +3. Prince actually played for free this night, along with opening act Curtiss A. Setlist Controversy (instrumental jam) Let's Go Crazy Delirious 1999 Little Red Corvette Computer Blue Darling Nikki The Beautiful Ones When Doves Cry Baby I'm A Star Purple Rain\n\nMarch 3, 1986\n\nThis performance was essentially a public rehearsal before Prince and the Revolution headed out on their Parade Tour with a revamped lineup. The lineup featured Wendy Melvoin and Miko Weaver on guitars, Brown Mark on bass, Dr. Fink and Lisa Coleman on keyboards, Eric Leeds on saxophone and flute, Atlanta Bliss on trumpet, Bobby Z. on drums, and Jerome Benton, Greg Brooks, and Wally Safford dancing and singing backing vocals. Prince reminded the audience that they had only been rehearsing for about a week before this performance, and essentially used it to show off the talent of his new band members. This was one of Prince's more low-key shows. It presented Prince as a bandleader, was more stripped-down and a bit less extravagant than, for example, his Purple Rain Tour. Setlist: Around the World in a Day Christopher Tracy's Parade New Position I Wonder U Paisley Park Alexa de Paris Raspberry Beret (with \"Alexa De Paris\" reprise) Controversy Mutiny Soft and Wet I Wanna Be Your Lover Head Under the Cherry Moon Pop Life Girls & Boys Life Can Be So Nice Encore: Purple Rain Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On (Big Maybelle cover) Anotherloverholenyohead Mountains Encore 2: A Love Bizarre America Kiss\n\nMarch 21, 1987\n\nApproximately one year after his previous performance at First Avenue, Prince performed another set with a similar purpose. This time he performed at a sort of public rehearsal ahead of his Sign o' the Times Tour, which was sold out. At this time, construction on Paisley Park was beginning, and this show actually turned out to be his last performance at First Avenue until 2007.
