        "text": "English: patronymic from the personal name Nell or Nele, either of which might be a pet form of Elias or less commonly of Niel (from Latin Nigellus). See also Neal .\n\nHistory: The Nelson name was an important one in 18th-century VA, starting with Thomas âScotch Tomâ Nelson, who emigrated to VA at the close of the 17th century from Penrith, Cumbria, where the Nelsons were numerous. Scotch Tom settled c. 1700 at Yorktown, VA, where he became a successful merchant and landholder. His son was sheriff and a member of the VA Council, and his grandson, Thomas Nelson (1738â89), a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was governor of VA."
