Aside from his many musical hits, the icon’s personal style—both on and off the stage—was also in a league of its own, and his influence on the fashion world is still felt today. Now, a new exhibit from Paisley Park—Prince’s former home and studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota, which has since been turned into a museum—is offering a closer look inside Prince’s inimitable wardrobe. Specifically, his otherworldly collection of heels, which were a signature element of his look.\n\nRead the full article here- https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/prince-shoe-exhibit-paisley-park\n\nThe Beautiful Collection: Prince’s Custom Shoes Opens July 9, 2021\n\nMay 18, 2021\n\nCelebrating the legacy and artistry of the incomparable Prince, The Beautiful Collection: Prince’s Custom Shoes is the largest ever display to spotlight Prince’s footwear, featuring over 300 pairs of his iconic shoes. The exhibition opens at Paisley Park on Friday, July 9 and will be included in all tours.\n\nThe limited-run installation further highlights Prince’s impact on fashion, music, and popular culture. Prince challenged conventional fashion norms, inspiring designers and consumers to rethink how people should dress. His unique fashion sensibility, drawing on inspirations both masculine and feminine, and accessorizing nearly every outfit with a pair of custom made high-heeled boots, fearlessly pushed the envelope.\n\n“Prince continuously pushed the boundaries of fashion, music, and culture in general,” said Mitch Maguire, Paisley Park Managing Director and The Beautiful Collection Curator. “His expansive, incredible shoe collection is just one example of his artistic expression, personality, and lasting impact on fashion. When guests visit this exhibition, they will be immersed in the drama, taste, and complexity of Prince while also revealing some of the collaborators who worked so closely to bring his vision to life.”\n\nVisitors will become acquainted with Prince’s vibrantly patterned, custom-built collection of boots, platform sneakers, roller skates, and the stories behind them, in a newly designed area that provides a truly unique experience. Bringing the exhibition to life will be carefully crafted displays, video clips of Prince and his shoes in action, and recorded accounts from the shoemakers who created an extraordinary collection durable enough to withstand dancing, doing the splits, and jumping off pianos. Among the designers featured are Donatella Versace with whom Prince had a long standing collaboration, and longtime Prince shoemakers Andre No.1 and Cos Kyriacou.\n\nThe over 300 pairs of shoes on display will include some of Prince’s most iconic pairs. Among them are the blue ankle boots hand-painted with white clouds featured in the “Raspberry Beret” music video, his signature Versace fabric heeled boots, the blue beaded pair worn to the 57th Academy Awards where Prince accepted the Academy Award for Best Original Score for Purple Rain, and more. Also included will be shoes he wore to make a statement like the pair adorned with the gold metallic “Free Music” sticker highlighting the complex relationship between recording artists and record labels, and the wooden shoe last crafted to emulate Prince’s foot in order to create his custom made shoes.\n\nPaisley Park confirmed today that Celebration, the annual festival honoring and celebrating the legacy of Prince, will not be held in 2021 due to COVID-19 safety protocols and current restrictions in the state of Minnesota. “We can see the light at the end of the tunnel and look forward to when we can safely gather in the way this event deserves,” said Executive Director Alan Seiffert. Plans for smaller events, keeping in accordance with COVID-19 restrictions, are in the works and will be announced soon. Seiffert added, “We have some exciting plans on the horizon that are sure to excite our fans, especially our fashion fans, whether here in Minnesota or connecting with us virtually.”\n\nPaisley Park remains open for tours. For the most up to date information about future events, Celebration 2022, and the exciting developments to come, subscribe to Paisley Park e-news.\n\nReservations now open for visitation on April 21, 2021\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the passing of the incomparable Prince, Paisley Park, his home and creative sanctuary, is opening its doors for fans to pay tribute and celebrate his life. The Paisley Park Atrium, 7801 Audubon Road, will be open for free visitation on Wednesday April 21 from 9 AM – 9 PM. Advance reservations are required.\n\n“Prince’s passing remains incomprehensible to all of us,” said Alan Seiffert, Paisley Park Executive Director. “We celebrate his life and legacy every day at Paisley Park, a place that Prince wanted to share with the world. So, on this day especially, we acknowledge the incredible force and inspiration Prince is in people’s lives and open up our doors for them to pay their respects.”\n\nLimited on-site parking will be available and guests are encouraged to use ride share applications. Visits will be timed, and masks required, keeping in accordance with Covid-19 restrictions currently in place. Limited reservations are available. Reservations do not include tickets for a tour; the museum will not host tours on April 21.\n\nWe're taking inspiration from Prince's 3121 and celebrating the album and era on Monday, 3.1.21 with late hours and special tours, accompanied by music from 3121.\n\nReleased on March 21, 2006, 3121 shared its name with “the 3121 house” Prince was renting in the mid-2000s, which was the site of legendary recording sessions and late-night parties. The album included collaborations with many of Prince’s past and future bandmates, and its name, title track, and the name of his subsequent concert residency in Las Vegas all reflected his affinity for certain numbers and numerical patterns.\n\nGet in the spirit of 3121 at Paisley with late-night tours on 3.1.21.\n\nPaisley Park today announces the passing of Divinity, the female white dove once owned by Prince Rogers Nelson, following a recent decline in health due to age.\n\nDivinity died peacefully on Tuesday, February 2, 2021 after 28 years of life. One of the original doves Prince kept at his iconic Paisley Park complex, Divinity was an ever-present fixture for countless Paisley Park tours, events, and productions. “Divinity’s beautiful coo has welcomed visitors since Paisley Park first opened its gates to the public in October 2016,” said Alan Seiffert, Executive Director of Paisley Park. “She was one of the enduring links to Prince for thousands of fans. She will be missed.”\n\nAt 28, Divinity far surpassed the average lifespan of doves. “Although the original doves have passed on, visitors to Paisley Park will continue to enjoy the warm greetings from a new generation of doves that will continue to grace Prince’s home.” said Mitch Maguire, Legacy Preservationist.\n\nPaisley Park invites you to feel the love this Presidents’ Day and Valentine’s weekend, February 12-15, as we reveal a few unique elements and add evening tour hours.
