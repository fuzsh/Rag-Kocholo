He released hundreds of songs both under his own name and multiple pseudonyms during his life, as well as writing songs that were made famous by other musicians, such as \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" and \"Manic Monday\". Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. Prince sold over 150 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award [1985 Best Original Song Score], and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and will be inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.[1]\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, and at the ceremony played an electrifying lead guitar solo in the performance of George Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps with an all-star band. Prince's riveting guitar solo comes at the end. (George Harrison, as a solo artist, was also inducted to the Hall of Fame in 2004.)\n\nIn a memorial interview in the Washington Post, guitarist Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top praised Prince's technique and singled out the opening guitar solo for Prince's When Doves Cry as \"defying description.\"\n\nSong: Purple Rain (performed in the pouring rain at SuperBowl XLI, 2007)\n\nSong: Little Red Corvette\n\nSong: (Party Like It's) 1999\n\nHis parents were John L. Nelson and Mattie Della (Shaw) Baker.[2]\n\nAdditional sibling and half sibling:\n\nTyka Nelson (1960)\n\nOmar Baker (c.1969)\n\nHis father played piano in nightclubs after work, using the stage name Prince, and his mother was a nightclub singer.[3] Prince suffered from seizures as a child until the age of 7.[4] His parents divorced when he was about 10. He played basketball and trained in classical ballet.[5][6][7]\n\nHe married Mayte Garcia on 14 February 1996.[8][9][10] The marriage was annulled in 1999 and they formally divorced in June of 2000.\n\nChildren:\n\nGregory Nelson, born October 16, 1996 - died a week after birth.\n\nMayte also says that the couple lost a second child, a girl, apparently prior to term.\n\nHe married Manuela Testolini in 2001.[11] The marriage ended in 2006. There were no children.\n\nPrince died at home in Chanhassen, Minnesota at age 57 on 21 April 2016.[12][1] His body was cremated, and the urn, at one time viewable at his Paisley Park Studios, is currently not on display.[13]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Wikipedia contributors, \"Prince (musician),\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prince_(musician)&oldid=1067502964 (accessed January 25, 2022).\n\n↑ \"Minnesota Birth Index, 1935-2002,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VC5V-NTC : accessed 21 April 2016), Prince Roger Nelson, 07 Jun 1958; from \"Minnesota Birth Index, 1935-2002,\" database, Ancestry (http://www.ancestry.com : 2004); citing Hennepin, Minnesota, United States, Minnesota Department of Health, Minneapolis.\n\n↑ Woodworth, Griffin (2013). \"Prince, Miles, and Maceo: horns, masculinity, and the anxiety of influence\".
