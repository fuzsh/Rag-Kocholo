        "text": "The world premiere of Purple Rain the musical, an adaptation of Prince's 1984 album and film, will debut at the State Theater in Minneapolis in spring 2025 before heading to Broadway, according to an announcement from Hennepin Theatre Trust.\n\nFeaturing music and lyrics by Prince, the musical is being adapted by playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (a twice-finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, who directed The Bluest Eye at the Guthrie Theater in 2017) from the original screenplay by Albert Magnoli and William Blinn, with direction by the Tony Award-nominated Lileana Blain-Cruz.\n\n“Prince talked about adapting Purple Rain for the stage for years,” said former Prince manager L Londell McMillan, and Larry Mestel, CEO of Primary Wave Music, in a joint statement. “It’s only fitting that we launch this world premiere musical version in the city where it all began, Prince’s hometown, Minneapolis.”\n\nPurple Rain, which won two Grammys and the Academy Award for Best Original Score, grossing close to $100 million, has been widely considered one of the greatest musical films ever made, especially for us Minnesotans. It tells the story of The Kid (played by Prince himself), an up-and-coming musician making a name for himself in Minneapolis. The film is somewhat autobiographical, inspired by Prince’s own origin story, and prominently features local sights—including notable performances at First Avenue.\n\nHennepin Theatre Trust’s historic State Theatre is a fitting first home for the musical, just blocks from First Avenue itself, plus the 100-foot Hiero Veiga mural of Prince nearby. The last time a Broadway show premiered in Minneapolis before its New York run was The Lion King in 1997."
