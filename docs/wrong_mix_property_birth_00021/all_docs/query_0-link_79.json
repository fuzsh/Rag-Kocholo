        "text": "Dig, if you will, the picture: It was 2010 and Prince set out on his \"Welcome 2 America\" Tour, threading the world and playing sold-out venues. He delivered a mix of anthems and pop hits drawn from his 39 studio albums. And yet, there was something curiously missing from that \"Welcome 2 America\" tour: songs from the album \"Welcome 2 America\" – an album Prince wrote and recorded right before the tour, but then never released or performed in public. That music - which you'll hear for the first time tonight - went into Prince's vault, a trove of material this blazingly prolific artist secreted away. Five years after Prince's death, administrators of his estate are cracking open the vault. \"Welcome 2 America\" and welcome to the singular ways of Prince.\n\nHere he is on that 2010 tour, the riddle, wrapped in a mystery, wrapped in gold lamé. Let's Go Crazy was one of five number one hits. When Prince died, he was still selling more albums than any other living musician.\n\nTo unravel the Prince paradox, we started here: Paisley Park in Chanhassen, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis - his hometown. From the outside, there's nothing Paisley about it. Enter and the place is a trippy dreamscape, Oz accented in purple, not green - though a pair of doves overhead is still white…\n\nNow a museum, Paisley Park wasn't just where Prince worked; he lived above the shop so he could make music anytime inspiration struck - which was basically always.\n\nThe Prince estate invited us inside Studio B. We sat at Prince's soundboard with his longtime keyboardist and musical director Morris Hayes.\n\nMorris Hayes: Have to ease into it, you know.\n\nHe gave us a preview of that missing album, \"Welcome 2 America.\"\n\n\"Welcome 2 America\": Land of the free home of the brave. Oops I mean land of the free home of the slave. Get down on your knees. Hit me. Welcome to America.\n\nDeliriously versatile, Prince wrote the songs, sang the songs and played most instruments. He asked Hayes to add production value.\n\nMorris Hayes: like he said, \"Man, here's the record. I want you to overproduce it. Anything I don't want I'll take it away.\"\n\nJon Wertheim: Is there another song from the album?\n\nMorris Hayes: Sure. This one's called-- \"Check the Record.\"\n\n\"Check the Record\": Let's check the record. See what it said. Seems like your girlfriend was in my bed…\n\nTypical Prince, the album resists genres. Lyrically, it's, by turns, sly, suggestive and subversive.\n\n\"Check the Record\": Let's check the record. See what it said. Seems like your girlfriend was in my bed…\n\nJon Wertheim: Did he ever say why he didn't put this out there?\n\nMorris Hayes: No. And I remember asking him-- about it. And he says, \"Well, we'll just have to revisit that down the line.\" 'Cause he was just onto the next project.\n\nJon Wertheim: You think that's what it was, he's just--\n\nMorris Hayes: Just I'd never seen anybody that had that much work inside of them. It's just this unending stream of just music.\n\nHayes isn't exaggerating. For four decades, Prince worked to a furious beat, releasing an album roughly every year. Yet most of the music Prince created and recorded was never released. By one estimate 8,000 songs, that's hundreds of albums, never left Paisley Park.\n\nShelby J.: Well, music, you know, it ain't milk. It don't expire. You know.\n\nPrince vocalist Shelby J. recalls the music factory was open 24/7.\n\nShelby J.: It was nothing strange about getting that call at 2:00 a.m. and he got inspired. And he wants to record something.\n\nMorris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nShelby J.: So it's, like, what-- he'd say, \"What are you doin', Shelby?\" I'm, like, \"I'm asleep. It's 2:30 in the morning.\" (LAUGH) \"What--\" he's, like, \"You wanna sing? Feel like singing?\" And I'm, like, \"Y-- you-- yeah, Prince. I feel like singing.\" He's, like, \"How soon can you get here?\"\n\nJon Wertheim: How often would you guys record something that was great that wasn't released?\n\nMorris Hayes: That was all the time.\n\nShelby J.: Ooh, all the time. And I asked him about that. I'm, like, \"What's gonna happen to this music?\" And he's, like, \"Oh, somebody'll-- somebody will do somethin' with it,\" very cavalier. Like, \"I won't be here.\" But he knew it would see the light a day.\n\nPrince warehoused all this music one floor below the studios in what he called the vault. Our cameras weren't allowed beyond this door to the vault's exterior, but the Carver County's Sheriff's Office got inside during a 2016 investigation into Prince's death at Paisley Park, eventually ruled an accidental overdose of painkillers.\n\nAt age 57, Prince died with no spouse, no children and, crucially, no will. His sister and his five half-siblings have been named heirs, but, five years on, are locked in a legal dispute over the estate. Meanwhile, the bank overseeing the estate, called in Troy Carter, one-time Lady Gaga manager and Spotify executive, to sort out the music collection and unlock its value.\n\nTroy Carter: The Prince Vault is this legendary thing. So my first visit to Paisley, of course the first place that I wanted to go was to-- to see the vault. It's literally a vault. (LAUGH) It's a room full of shelves floor to ceiling, with tapes. You have recorded music. A video archive. Then you have a written archive. You know, just looking at the penmanship, the drawings that he would do.\n\nTroy Carter: You know, \"Little Red Corvette,\" there's a picture of a little red Corvette in the lyrics. I have literally have chills on my arm right now because I remember the first time seein' the lyrics.\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you have favorite songs that are down there?\n\nShelby J.: Wow. Same page, (SNAP) but a different book. So much more in common if we only look. Yeah.\n\nOn the rare occasions he mentioned it at all, Prince downplayed the music he didn't release. Here he is in 2014.\n\nArsenio Hall: Is there a huge vault of material…?\n\nPrince: I don't go back in time and listen to it. I worked on it and brought it as far as I could right then. A lot of it I didn't even finish.\n\nMaybe so, but we learned that for all its—and his—mystique, Prince stayed out of the vault for the most mundane of reasons.\n\nTroy Carter: When they told me that he hadn't been in the vault in years, I thought there was gonna be this story about how he left behind his old materials to focus on new artistic endeavors. And they said, \"No, he just forgot the password to the vault. And so he started putting stuff in his pre-vault. And then that turned into more and more rooms.\n\nCarter had the contents moved here to be digitized. Iron Mountain is a secure repository in California. A team of archivists bears the responsibility of listening to the music and proposing new releases. The Estate has kept pace with Prince, putting out roughly an album a year since his death - a mix of re-releases and newly mined gems.\n\nTroy Carter: Sometimes when we think we have the plan, we'll come across something that blows our mind.\n\nHere's an example: In 1983, one year before the release of Purple Rain, the album that cemented Prince as a star, he recorded this rehearsal session. Just him at the piano, working out new arrangements.\n\nTroy Carter: And there's a piece on that project of him crafting Purple Rain. To hear the seeds of the idea and to see how that song was sorta formed, and then to finally get to, you know, that song being one of the most iconic songs of all time, it was r-- really special.\n\nFast forward 25 years: that little tune Prince worked out at the piano? He played it on one of the world's largest stages: the 2007 Super Bowl halftime show. Morris and Shelby backed him that night.\n\nJon Wertheim: A little wet that night.\n\nShelby J.: A little wet.\n\nMorris Hayes: A little bit.\n\nShelby J.: Just a little. (LAUGH)\n\nJon Wertheim: Was he worried about that?\n\nMorris Hayes: No.\n\nShelby J.: Not at all. Not at all. He was unbothered.\n\nMorris Hayes: He even asked for more rain--\n\nJon Wertheim: He asked for more rain?\n\nShelby J.: Yeah.\n\nShelby J.: \"Can you make it rain harder?\"\n\nMorris Hayes: Listen when you get Purple Rain in the rain--it don't get no better than that.\n\nThe ultimate showman, Prince was at his most meticulous on guitar. He could deliver searing solos on stage that sounded, unmistakably, like they do on his album.\n\nJon Wertheim: What did Prince tell you about his approach to playing a guitar solo?\n\nMorris Hayes: He said, \"Morris, if you wanna do a great solo. Like, write it out, think it out so that, when you go to play it, you can play it again…\"\n\nShelby J.: And-- he would make that ugly face, you know, the face.\n\nMorris Hayes: Gotta make the ugly face.\n\nShelby J.: Gotta make the ugly face.\n\nMorris Hayes: You had to get some contortion face. Or the note won't even get out right unless you make a ugly face.\n\nShelby J.: And I would watch him play guitar and sound out what he's doing with his mouth. And I could see that connection.\n\nFor all the music he churned out, Prince performed with the spontaneity of a human jukebox, rearranging songs and set lists on the spot and zinging his band members when they hit sour notes.\n\nMorris Hayes: And he'd just say, \"Well, looks like Morris just bought me a new pair a boots (LAUGH) this week,\"\n\nJon Wertheim: What does that mean?\n\nMorris Hayes: That means you just got fined. You just got docked because you messed up. And now he's gonna take your money and go buy some new boots with it.\n\nJon Wertheim: Was there a flipside to that, though, but could he be too controlling?\n\nMorris Hayes: Well, he micromanaged. I think, you know, the-- the--the key to Prince is that you always knew who was runnin' the ship.\n\nThe seas weren't always smooth. Prince famously chafed against a music business he said didn't treat artists fairly. In 1993, he changed his name to a symbol and splayed the word \"slave\" across his face — part of an ongoing battle with his record label to control his own output.\n\nPrince eventually won ownership of his master recordings and his estate now controls the music. The challenge: monetizing the catalog, while trying to do right by Prince.\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you sort of have this \"What would Prince do,\" echoing?\n\nTroy Carter: I wanna make sure that Prince isn't somewhere in heaven giving me the side-eye. You know, that-- that famous Prince side-eye.\n\nJon Wertheim: \"Carter, why'd you put that out there?\"\n\nTroy Carter: Exactly. (LAUGH)\n\nHard to fathom Prince's final act of ambiguity - not leaving behind a will. As his heirs wrangle over his estate—and try to put a value on something awfully hard to quantify—Prince fans remain loyal, making the pilgrimage to Paisley Park, and awaiting the next musical motherlode from his vault.\n\nTroy Carter: You know, the fans think they've heard everything. So whenever we can find things that the fans haven't heard is like a victory.\n\nMorris Hayes: This one's called \"Born 2 Die.\"\n\nThis summer will mark the release of \"Welcome 2 America,\" an album about racial inequality and social injustice. Recorded more than a decade ago just outside Minneapolis, it crackles with relevance today.\n\nShelby J.: The injustice inequality, Prince knew about that firsthand, you know, growing up as a black man. He knew what that was. And he could - he could write about it and he could sing about it. When you got Breonna Taylor, you got Ahmaud Arbery, you got the George Floyd goin' on, it's like we are/the movement is happening. And I think that the world is ready to absorb what he's saying on this album. I mean it's right on time. You know, right on time.\n\nPrince will stay right on time for years, even decades. We've done the math and with so many songs in a vault now cracked open, we could get a Prince album every year for the rest of the millennium. Or, as The Artist himself might put it, until three-thousand-zero-zero.\n\nProduced by Nathalie Sommer. Associate producer, Kaylee Tully. Broadcast associate, Elizabeth Germino.
