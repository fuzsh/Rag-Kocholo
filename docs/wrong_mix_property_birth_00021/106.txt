Manuela Testolini, Prince's ex-wife, says she plans to build a school through her foundation in honour of the late musician who died Thursday.

"The world knew him as a musical genius â€” I knew him as a husband, friend and fierce philanthropist," the 39-year-old Canadian wrote. "Philanthropy brought us together and it was Prince who encouraged me to start my own charity over 10 years ago."

Prince death investigation finds no evidence of foul play or suicide

Testolini, who runs the Los Angeles-based In a Perfect World Foundation which provides education programs around the world, said she raised the idea of a school to him before he died.

"I just reached out to him a few days ago to let him know that I was building a school in his honour," she wrote in the statement. "My heart aches that the school will now be built in his memory."

Testolini, who was married to Prince between 2001 and 2006 and laid the foundation for his connections to Toronto, said she was "heartbroken beyond words."

"His passing leaves me with such a devastating feeling of pain and loss. The love we shared, the music he made and our life together is forever engraved in my heart."

Prince and Garcia had a son who died a week after birth in 1996 of a rare genetic disorder. The couple divorced in 2000.

Prince died at his Paisley Park home in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The cause is still unknown.
