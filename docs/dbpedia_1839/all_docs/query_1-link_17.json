        "text": "I was about to pay for the coffee the interpreter had ordered when ­Karagounis, who had not spoken a word of English during our hour-long chat, gestured to the waiter and said: “No, no I pay.” With that he smiled and went off for the English lessons he has been taking since arriving at Fulham on a free transfer last month after being released by Panathinaikos.\n\n“There has been mismanagement [of the economy] from some people but Greece will recover. We will not leave the euro and go back to the drachma. There have been many mistakes over the last years. At the moment it’s a hard situation without question but I shall always be very proud to be Greek.\n\nAs a well-paid footballer, he admits: “I cannot feel the way common people feel it but I have relatives who have problems. When you see people suffering it affects you and you are not in a good mood.”\n\nThat booking ruled him out of the quarter-final and he admits Greece’s elimination was “a really bad experience”. Given the anger about the austerity programme the Germans have imposed on the Greeks this was billed as a grudge match but Karagounis says the wider economic situation had no bearing on the match.\n\nAnd then, recalling how Greece won Euro 2004, with Karagounis scoring the first goal of the tournament in a surprise victory over hosts Portugal, he says: “It is more important to win with your country than your club. I want to play until the next World Cup in 2014 and terminate my career playing for the national team.”\n\nHowever, he insists his decision to leave Greece was not because of the economic situation but the usual football reason — falling out with the coach, who in this case was Jesualdo Ferreira. “We had a few disagreements. I did not play as much as I wanted to. Most of the time he didn’t play me at all. It was very hard for me to accept that.”\n\n“Fulham are one of the eight best teams of the Premier League and of course the League is one of the best leagues in the world,” says Karagounis, who made his debut in Saturday’s defeat to Manchester City. “Most of the things here are the way I expected them to be. Fulham are very well organised, maybe in some particular things more organised than Inter Milan, not that I want to compare the two clubs.\n\n“The Greeks are very loud during the whole of the game. They are singing and doing crazy things. Here the crowd cheer the athletes at the moment that they’re going to score. They have to have proof that something good will happen before they react.\n\n“Another big difference is that in Greece, if you are the loser then the athletes have a big problem. They can’t even leave their house because the crowds are very upset. They are asking them ‘why did you lose?’ all the time. In Greece, if you are the winner you are like God; if you are the loser, you’re nothing. The English crowds are very good, they’re more controlled. If you win they are happy but if you lose it is still okay, they allow you to go home. Not like Greece. Also, the Greek media are very ferocious. We have 12 sports newspapers. It’s a country of 10 million people and there is a lot of pressure by the media.”\n\nKaragounis accepts the England team also have to deal with an intense media focus, a view he formed during Euro 2004. That tournament was yet another one when England exited after a penalty shoot out and, says Karagounis: “In Euro 2004 people said there was a lot of stress in the English team. This is what’s believed about the English team, that the players were very stressed.”\n\nThe only stress in moving to London that Karagounis seems to be experiencing is from the weather. As we speak, he looks out at the rain and says: “It is 350C in Athens.” Nothing can be done about that although his move later this week from the Battersea hotel where he has been staying to a flat should help him feel more at home.\n\nThe matches he is looking forward to are against Manchester United and Arsenal. Back in 2000, he hit a memorable goal from a free-kick at Old ­Trafford for Panathinaikos in a Champions League group game and the following year scored with a thumping diving header at home to Arsenal.\n\nKaragounis will not get a chance to repeat his Old Trafford performance this season but is determined that by the time United visit Craven Cottage in February his English should have improved. However, should he disagree with the referee’s decision, he says: “I will speak Greek.”"
