        "text": "There's something peculiar about Georgios Samaras as a footballer: whether it's his gangly frame, the combination of facial hair and flowing locks, or the fact that he is frustratingly inconsistent despite possessing immense talent.\n\nWherever he plays, he is sure to divide opinion and attract the attention of commentator and fan alike.\n\nWhat is undisputed about Samaras -- who is probably remembered by most as a 6-million-pound failure at Manchester City -- is his importance to the Greek national team. That is not to say that Samaras has been Greece's best player over the past eight years, but he has been ever-present and talismanic.\n\nThe general rule has been that when Samaras has played well, so have Greece. The best example of this was at Euro 2012, where Samaras single-handedly led the line in a famous 1-0 win over Russia. That performance exhibited all of the striker's best traits: his strength and dexterity on the ball, his hold-up play and the ease with which he can beat players.\n\nPut simply, Samaras was the catalyst for Greece's progression to the knockout stages. They had been unimpressive up until the Celtic striker lifted his game, at which point his countrymen were inspired and the unit rallied around him.\n\nOf course, the 29-year-old won't be playing for Celtic next season and his club future remains shrouded in pre-transfer-buzz mystery. Speaking about Samaras' departure last month, his then-manager Neil Lennon said the player \"had considerable interest from bigger clubs\" and would find himself in the top eight of Spain, Italy or Germany.\n\nI'm not so sure.\n\nSamaras isn't getting any younger and his well-documented inconsistency at club level is the reason he's been unable to move away from Scottish football. If big clubs really wanted him, they surely would have tabled a serious offer to Celtic by now.\n\nGiven he is about to be out of contract, Samaras is at a crucial juncture in his career.\n\n- Lennon leaves Celtic\n\nFor both his international and club future, this World Cup will be a defining moment. If he were to inspire his country to a place in round of 16, we might be talking about a move to a big European league this summer. We could then be talking about a future captain of Greece.\n\nBut a disappointing tournament in Brazil would serve to confirm the many doubts caused by Samaras' inconsistency. Big clubs would probably be scared off taking a gamble on a player who is 29 and could potentially demand high wages. A return to Greece, in that case, would be the logical result.\n\nWere Samaras forced to continue his club career in the Greek Super League, it would have a tangible impact on his international career. Continuing to play at a high level outside of Greece is a mantra that has served Greece captain Giorgos Karagounis well. He was still playing in the English Premier League at age 37 -- how Samaras would love to emulate his captain.\n\nIf he is lacking in motivation, however, Samaras need only look at the way Angelos Charisteas' career petered out after Euro 2004. Famous for his goals in Portugal a decade ago, a series of poor club choices and a lack of consistency meant Charisteas -- now 34 -- has all but disappeared from world football. The former Ajax striker could well have been one of the veterans in Brazil this year but instead is considering his future in the game altogether.\n\nIt would be a shame if the same fate were to befall Samaras, who on his day is an incredibly effective player. His natural build and his technical ability are potent weapons when harnessed.\n\nAt times the striker can give the impression that he is disinterested or at the very least, lacking in motivation. Whether this is reflective of his actual mindset or a result of his languid style of play is open to debate.\n\nRegardless, Greece will need him to lead the line at the World Cup given he is one of the squad's most experienced and influential figures.\n\nIf all of these factors don't spur Samaras on to fulfill his potential in Brazil, nothing else will."
