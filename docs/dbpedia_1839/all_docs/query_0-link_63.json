        "text": "Three matches, four goals and one dream: Argentina star Lionel Messi and Brazilian idol Neymar remain on collision course as the most entertaining World Cup in decades enters the knockout rounds on Saturday.\n\nThe mouthwatering possibility of Brazil and Argentina meeting in the July 13 final has loomed closer ever since the South American giants were kept in opposite sides of the draw.\n\nSo far Barcelona team-mates Messi and Neymar have done everything in their power to stick to the script, almost single-handedly steering their teams through the first round into the last 16.\n\nMessi, who began the tournament looking to cement his place in the pantheon of the game's greatest players - if he isn't there already - has produced man-of-the-match performances in each of his three games.\n\nA jinking individual goal against Bosnia, an inspired injury-time winner against Iran and a two-goal contribution against Nigeria have dispelled the theory that Messi may buckle under the weight of expectation.\n\n\"Now we can't make any mistakes as any error will see us getting knocked out,\" said Messi after Argentina's win over Nigeria.\n\nMessi and his team-mates now travel to Sao Paulo to face Group E runners-up Switzerland in the last 16 on Tuesday.\n\nBefore that, Brazil's poster-boy Neymar will aim to inspire the hosts once more when they face an awkward tie with Chile in Belo Horizonte on Saturday.\n\nLike Messi, Neymar has thrived on the responsibility of being his team's main man. He scored twice as Brazil came back from 1-0 down against Croatia to win their opening game 3-1, and added two more in the 4-1 rout of Cameroon as Brazil topped Group A.\n\n\"We are on the right track and are growing all the time as we get closer to making our dream come true,\" the 22-year-old said.\n\nYet if Argentina and Brazil are to meet in the Maracana Stadium in a little over a fortnight, there will be obstacles along the way.\n\nThe first round may have been notable for the shock demise of European heavyweights such as defending champions Spain and Euro 2012 finalists Italy, but other threats remain.\n\nBeaten 2010 finalists the Netherlands have looked in formidable form so far, maintaining a 100 percent record to top Group B including a sensational 5-1 destruction of Spain.\n\nIn Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben, the Dutch have two of the deadliest attackers in the tournament, and in a competition where high-quality defending has been notably absent, that could be crucial.\n\nThe Dutch will fancy their chances of beating Mexico in the second round to remain on course for a possible meeting with Argentina in the semi-finals.\n\nGermany also look to be building formidable momentum after coming out on top of a demanding Group G ahead of the United States, Ghana and Portugal.\n\nBayern Munich striker Thomas Mueller has notched four goals in three games, including a superb hat-trick in the 4-0 drubbing of Portugal, and Joachim Loew's side ought to be too strong for Algeria in Porto Alegre on Monday.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to a possible semi-final meeting with Brazil is likely to come in the quarter-finals where the Germans could face a revitalised France who have produced some of the most scintillating attacking play so far.\n\nAlthough a changed France line-up was held to a 0-0 draw against Ecuador in their final Group E game, Didier Deschamps' side excelled in big wins over Honduras (3-0) and Switzerland (5-2), with Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema finally producing his form for Les Bleus.\n\nFrance play Nigeria in the last 16 in Brasilia on Monday.\n\nArguably the dark horses of the knockout round could be a burgeoning Colombia, who wrapped up their third win of the tournament with a 4-1 demolition job of Japan.\n\nThe Colombians face a Luis Suarez-less Uruguay at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday where the prize would be their first ever appearance in the quarter-finals.\n\nKNOCK OUT ROUND SCHEDULE\n\nROUND OF 16\n\nDate\n\nUAE Time\n\nNo\n\nTeams\n\nResult\n\n28 June\n\n8pm\n\n49\n\nBrazil vs

Curitiba\n\nAlgeria 1 (Slimani 60) Russia 1 (Kokorin 6)\n\nAlgeria reached the World Cup last 16 for the first time after fighting back for a 1-1 draw against Russia to clinch second place in Group H.\n\nBelgium topped the group after a 1-0 victory over South Korea who were eliminated along with Fabio Capello's Russians.\n\nRussia grabbed the lead in the sixth minute when Alexander Kokorin met a perfect Dmitry Kombarov cross with a full-blooded header which flew into the net.\n\nBut there will again be questions about Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, who was at fault for Algeria's 60th-minute equaliser, coming off his line but failing to reach a Yacine Brahimi free kick which was headed home by Islam Slimani.\n\nMatch #47: Group H at Sao Paulo\n\nBelgium 1 (Vertonghen 78) South Korea 0\n\nBelgium strolled into the World Cup last 16 on Thursday after Jan Vertonghen's late goal gave them a 1-0 win over a South Korean side unable to take advantage of a 45-minute numerical advantage and who exit the tournament.\n\nBelgium were in cruise control until Steven Defour was sent off for a two-footed lunge at Kim Shin-wook just before halftime.\n\nSouth Korea rarely looked like scoring and were caught out in the 78th-minute when Vertonghen banged in the rebound after Divock Origi's shot was parried by goalkeeper Kim Seung-gyu.\n\nMatch #46: Group G at Arena Pernambuco, Recife\n\nUnited States 0 Germany 1 (Mueller 55)\n\nA 55th minute Thomas Mueller goal gave Germany a 1-0 win over the United States on Thursday but the result allowed both teams to progress to the second round of the World Cup.\n\nThe Germans dominated the game with Juergen Klinsmann's team, with their backs against the wall, creating very few chances.\n\nThe breakthrough came when Tim Howard parried out a Per Mertesacker header but Mueller collected the loose ball on the edge of the area and superbly side-footed into the bottom corner.\n\nMatch #45: Group G at Estádio Nacional de Brasilia, Brasília\n\nPortugal 2 (Boye 31-OG Ronaldo 80) Ghana 1 (Gyan 57)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored his first goal of the tournament as Portugal beat Ghana 2-1 on Thursday but both teams were eliminated from the World Cup as the United States held on to second place in Group G despite their defeat by Germany.\n\nStarting the day on a point each, both teams knew they needed a victory to have any chance of progress and Portugal started strongly as Ronaldo hit the bar and sent a close-range header straight at goalkeeper Fatawu Dauda before Ghana's John Boye sliced a cross into his own net after 31 minutes.\n\nAsamoah Gyan headed the equaliser from a lovely Kwadwo Asamoah cross 12 minutes into the second half and Abdul Majeed Waris missed the chance to put Ghana ahead when he headed wide from point-blank range five minutes later.\n\nRonaldo finally found the net in the 80th minute.\n\nMatch #44: Group E at Estádio Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro\n\nEcuador 0 France 0 France and Ecuador drew 0-0 in their final World Cup Group E game on Wednesday to send the French into the last 16 as group winners and eliminate their opponents due to Switzerland's 3-0 win over Honduras.\n\nEcuador keeper Alexander Dominguez made two great saves to deny Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann but the South American side's chances were dealt a mortal blow five minutes into the second half when captain Antonio Valencia was sent off after catching Lucas Digne as both men slid into a tackle.\n\nCristian Noboa missed a great chance for Ecuador soon after but, having started the day level on points with Switzerland, they never looked likely to find the win they needed and they escaped defeat only because of some poor French finishing.\n\nMatch #43: Group E at Arena Amazônia, Manaus\n\nHonduras 0 Switzerland 3 (Shaqiri 6, 31, 71)\n\nXherdan Shaqiri netted a hat-trick as Switzerland beat Honduras 3-0 in Manaus on Wednesday to secure the runners-up spot in World Cup Group E and a last 16 clash against Argentina.\n\nThe Swiss went ahead after six minutes when Shaqiri held off left back Juan Carlos Garcia and unleashed a curling strike from outside the box past Honduran goalkeeper Noel Valladares.\n\nHe made it 2-0 in the 31st minute after being put clean through on goal by Josip Drmic, and the pair combined again in the 71st minute as Shaqiri completed his hat-trick.\n\nMatch #42: Group F at Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador\n\nBosnia 3 (Dzeko 23 Pjanic 59 Vrsajevic 83) Iran 1 (Ghoochannejhad 82)\n\nBosnia beat Iran 3-1 in their Group F finale on Wednesday to record their first World Cup win and deny the West Asians any chance of reaching the knockout stage.\n\nAlready eliminated after two losses, Bosnia, appearing at a major tournament for the first time as an independent nation, went ahead in the 23rd minute through Edin Dzeko, who drilled a left-foot shot past Iran goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi.\n\nBosnia doubled their lead just before the hour through Miralem Pjanic's cool finish in the box before Reza Ghoochannejhad pulled a goal back for Iran in the 82nd minute.\n\nAvdija Vrsajevic restored Bosnia's two-goal cushion with a fine strike a minute later.\n\nMatch #41: Group F at Estádio Beira-Rio, Porto Alegre\n\nNigeria 2 (Musa 4, 47) Argentina 3 (Messi 3, 45+1 Rojo 50)\n\nLionel Messi scored twice as Argentina beat Nigeria 3-2 in another wonderful World Cup match on Wednesday but both teams advanced to the second round after Iran lost to Bosnia in the other Group F game.\n\nIn an explosive start, Messi lashed in a rebound after three minutes but Nigeria equalized a minute later thanks to a superb finish by Ahmed Musa, only for Messi to curl in a brilliant 20-metre free kick for his fourth of the tournament in first-half stoppage time.\n\nMusa leveled again with a clever finish two minutes after the restart but Argentina, who were assured of qualification before kickoff, got a fortunate third eight minutes later when a corner bounced in off the knee of Marcos Rojo.\n\nMatch #40: Group C at Estádio Castelão, Fortaleza\n\nGreece 2 (Samaris 42 Samaras 90+3-pen) Ivory Coast 1 (Bony 74)\n\nA stoppage time penalty from Giorgios Samaras sent Greece into the last 16 of the World Cup for the first time with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Ivory Coast.\n\nThe Africans were seconds away from heading into the second round themselves after Wilfried Bony's 74th minute equalizer looked to have given them the point they needed to progress.\n\nBut Samaras went down inside the box and rose to convert the penalty and send his team through to play Costa Rica in the second round.\n\nSubstitute Andreas Samaris gave Greece the lead in the 42nd minute beating Boubacar Barry following a mix-up in the Ivory Coast defense.\n\nMatch #39: Group C at Arena Pantanal, Cuiabá\n\nJapan 1 (Okazaki 45+2) Colombia 4 (Cuadrado 17-pen Martinez 55, 82 Rodriguez 90)\n\nJackson Martinez scored twice as Colombia beat Japan 4-1 to top World Cup Group C with maximum points on Tuesday, earning a second-round meeting with Uruguay in Rio de Janeiro and ending Japan's interest in the tournament.\n\nAlready assured of progress, Colombia went ahead with a 17th-minute Juan Cuadrado penalty, only for Shinji Okazaki to equalize with a diving header before the break as Japan sought the win they needed to have any chance of progressing.\n\nMartinez restored Colombia's lead with a sharp strike after 55 minutes and then produced a cool finish to make it 3-1 eight minutes from time before James Rodriguez added a delightful fourth goal with a clever run and chip over the keeper.\n\nMatch #38: Group at Estádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte\n\nCosta Rica 0 England 0\n\nCosta Rica marched into the second round of the World Cup proudly top of a Group D containing three former winners after a 0-0 draw with already-eliminated England on Tuesday.\n\nMatch #37: Group D at Estádio das Dunas, Natal\n\nItaly 0 Uruguay 1 (Godin 81)\n\nUruguay captain Diego Godin scored with an 81st-minute header to secure a 1-0 win over Italy in World Cup Group D on Tuesday and send the south Americans into the last 16.\n\nThe Italian players were still complaining after Uruguay striker Luis Suarez appeared to bite Giorgio Chiellini minutes before Godin rose to head in the winner.\n\nItaly had been reduced to 10 men in the 59th minute when midfielder Claudio Marchisio was harshly sent off for a challenge on Egidio Arevalo Rios.\n\nMatch #36: Group A at Arena Pernambuco, Recife\n\nCroatia 1 (Perisic 87) Mexico 3 (Marquez 72 Guardado 75 Hernandez 82)\n\nMexico marched into the last 16 of the World Cup after second-half goals from Rafael Marquez, Andres Guardado and Javier Hernandez gave them a 3-1 win over Group A rivals Croatia on Monday.\n\nMexico, who finish second in the group behind hosts Brazil, will face the Netherlands in the second round in Fortaleza on Sunday.\n\nSkipper Marquez broke the deadlock with a thundering header in the 72nd minute before Andres Guardado finished off a swift counter-attack.\n\nHernandez made it 3-0 with a back post header from a corner and although Croatia pulled a goal back in the 87th minute through Ivan Perisic they had Ante Rebic sent-off for an awful challenge two minutes later.\n\nMatch #35: Group A at Brasilia national stadium, Brasilia\n\nCameroon 1 (Matip 26) Brazil 4 (Neymar 17, 34 Fred 50 Fernandinho 85)\n\nRed-hot striker Neymar helped fire Brazil into a World Cup second-round meeting with Chile when he scored twice in the first half as the hosts survived an early scare against already-eliminated Cameroon to win 4-1 and top Group A on Monday\n\nBrazil's leading striker tucked in the first after 17 minutes from a Luiz Gustavo cross - the 100th goal of the tournament in Brazil's 100th World Cup match - but the delirious home crowd were silenced nine minutes later when Joel Matip equalized moments after he had hit the bar with a header.\n\nNeymar cut inside to fire in his second, and fourth of the this World Cup, in the 35th minute and Brazil cruised home with a Fred header four minutes into the second half and a goal for substitute Fernandinho six minutes from time.\n\nMatch #34: Group B at Baixada arena in Curitiba\n\nAustralia 0 Spain 3 (Villa 36, Torres 69, Mata 82)\n\nDavid Villa and Fernando Torres crowned potentially their last ever appearance at a World Cup finals with a goal apiece as deposed champions Spain ended their campaign with a consolation 3-0 win over Australia.\n\nThe Spanish - for whom Juan Mata scored the third goal - had been eliminated from the tournament after defeats by the Netherlands and Chile.\n\nMatch #33: Group B at the Corinthians Arena, Sao Paulo\n\nNetherlands 2 (Fer 77, Depay 90+2) Chile 0\n\nGoals by substitutes Leroy Fer and Memphis Depay gave the Netherlands a 2-0 victory over Chile on Monday that put them top of World Cup Group B and likely to avoid a second-round meeting with Brazil.\n\nFer produced a prodigious leap to head home Daryl Janmaat's angled cross two minutes after coming on.\n\nDepay then ran on to a telling Arjen Robben pass to complete the win in stoppage-time.\n\nMatch #32: Group G at the Amazonia arena, Manaus\n\nUSA 2 (Jones 64 Dempsey 81) Portugal 2 (Nani 5 Varela 90+5)\n\nSilvestre Varela equalised in the dying seconds to earn Portugal a 2-2 draw against the United States in World Cup Group G on Sunday and keep alive their hopes of progressing into the next round.\n\nUntil Varela's diving header from Cristiano Ronaldo's cross from the right, Portugal looked dead and buried after the US had come from behind to lead 2-1.\n\nThe result left Germany and the US level at the top of the group on four points and Portugal and Ghana on one.\n\nThe opening Portugal goal came in the fifth minute after a mistake by Geoff Cameron saw the ball fall kindly to Nani who smashed it high into the net past a helpless Tim Howard.\n\nJermaine Jones equalised in the second half with a blistering right-foot shot from outside the area and Clint Dempsey put the Americans ahead after bundling the ball home from close range in the 81st minute.\n\nMatch #31: Group H at the Beira Rio stadium, Porto Alegre\n\nSouth Korea 2 (Son Heung-min 50, Koo Ja-cheol 72) Algeria 4 (Slimani 26, Halliche 28, Djabou 38, Brahimi 62)\n\nAlgeria put themselves in pole position to reach the World Cup knock-out stages for the first time with a 4-2 win over South Korea in Porto Alegre on Sunday.\n\nIt was the first time an African team had scored four goals in a World Cup match and ended a 32 year win drought at the finals for the 'Desert Foxes'.\n\nFirst half goals from Islam Slimani, Rafik Halliche and Abdelmoume Djabou put Algeria in total control.\n\nYacine Brahimi's second half strike, sandwiched by efforts from Son Heung-Min and Koo Ja-Cheol, ensured Algeria moved up to second in Group H behind Belgium.\n\nMatch #30: Group H at Estádio Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro\n\nBelgium 1 (Origi 88) Russia 0\n\nDivock Origi sent Belgium into the last 16 of the World Cup when the teenager struck an 88th minute winner to secure a 1-0 victory against Russia in a largely lifeless Group H match at the Maracana on Sunday.\n\nThe striker rifled in following great work from Eden Hazard just minutes after Kevin Mirallas crashed a free kick against the base of the Russian post to give Belgium six points from two games.\n\nMatch #29: Group F at Cuiaba\n\nNigeria 1 (Odemwingie 29) Bosnia 0\n\nBosnia-Hercegovina's maiden appearance at a World Cup finals ended in disappointment as Peter Odemwingie's goal condemned them to a 1-0 defeat by African champions Nigeria in Cuiaba and ensured they could not qualify for the second round.\n\nPeter Odemwingie's 29th-minute goal, crashed home at the Pantanal arena after a muscular run and cross by Emmanuel Emenike, lifted Nigeria to second place in the group with four points, behind already-qualified Argentina who have six.\n\nBosnia, beaten 2-1 by the Argentines in their opener, could be forgiven for feeling aggrieved, however, as TV replays showed a disallowed goal by Edin Dzeko after 21 minutes had been incorrectly ruled out for offside and the big striker also hit a post in stoppage time.\n\nMatch #28: Group G at Estádio Castelão, Fortaleza\n\nGermany 2 (Gotze 51 Klose 71) Ghana 2 (Ayew 54 Gyan 63)\n\nMiroslav Klose scored a landmark goal as Germany and Ghana drew 2-2 with all the goals coming in a terrific second half of another rip-roaring World Cup clash on Saturday.\n\nMario Goetze nodded Germany ahead in the 51st minute, but Ghana instantly roared into attack.\n\nAndre Ayew headed an excellent equaliser three minutes later, and the Ghanaians went ahead when a great interception and pass by Sulley Muntari set up Asamoah Gyan to lash home in the 63rd.\n\nGermany levelled in the 71st minute with a sharp finish by Klose as the substitute claimed his 15th World Cup goal to move level with former Brazil striker Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time leading scorer.\n\nMatch #27: Group F at Estádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte\n\nArgentina 1 (Messi 90+1) Iran 0\n\nLionel Messi curled in a superb injury-time goal to give Argentina a 1-0 World Cup win over battling Iran to send them into the second round on Saturday.\n\nArgentina dominated possession but rarely looked like penetrating the massed ranks of defenders and Iran, growing in confidence after the break, were twice denied as headers by Reza Ghoochannejhad and Ashkan Dejagah were saved by Romero, the second a spectacular tip over the bar.\n\nThe game looked to be heading for a draw until Messi scored his second of the tournament to put the Group F favourites on six points following their opening win over Bosnia.\n\nMatch #26: Group E at Arena da Baixada, Curitiba\n\nHonduras 1 (Costly 31) Ecuador 2 Valencia 34, 65)\n\nHonduras scored their first World Cup goal for 32 years on Friday, but Enner Valencia replied twice to earn Ecuador a 2-1 Group E victory that gives them a fighting chance of making the knockout phase.\n\nCarlo Costly drove in a crisp shot after 31 minutes to register Honduras's first finals goal since a 1-1 draw with Northern Ireland in the 1982 tournament, but their dreams of a first-ever win disappeared within three minutes when a mishit shot from Juan Carlos Paredes was tapped into the net at the far post by Valencia.\n\nJerry Bengston had the ball in the net for Honduras at the end of the first half but the goal was ruled out for a combination of offside and handball and Ecuador won another exciting game in the 65th minute when Valencia headed home.\n\nMatch #25: Group E at Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador\n\nSwitzerland 2 (Dzemaili 81 Xkaka 87) France 5 (Giroud 17 Matuidi 18 Valbuena 40 Benzema 67 Sissoko 73)\n\nFree-flowing France blew away in-form Switzerland with a three-goal first-half barrage en route to a thumping 5-2 World Cup Group E win on Friday that virtually assures them of qualification for the second round.\n\nFrance blasted two goals within 66 seconds as Olivier Giroud headed them into the lead after 17 minutes and Blaise Matuidi added a second almost straight from the restart, while Mathieu Valbuena got a breakaway third late in the half after Swiss keeper Diego Benaglio had earlier saved a Karim Benzema penalty.\n\nBenzema added the fourth and his third of the tournament in the 67th minute and Moussa Sissoko came off the bench to complete the rout six minutes later before Blerim Dzemaili's free kick and a smart volley by Granit Xhaka made things look better for the Swiss.\n\nMatch #24: Group D at Arena Pernambuco, Recife\n\nItaly 0 Costa Rica 1 (Ruiz 44)\n\nCosta Rica produced another huge upset to reach the knockout stages of the World Cup for the second time on Friday with a 1-0 Group D win over Italy that also ensured England were eliminated.\n\nBryan Ruiz headed powerfully home a minute before halftime to leave Costa Rica fans dancing in the sunshine at Recife's Pernambuco arena, while Mario Balotelli missed Italy's best efforts.\n\nMatch #23: Group C at Estádio das Dunas, Natal\n\nJapan 0 Greece 0\n\nTen-man Greece held Japan to a goalless draw in a largely forgettable World Cup Group C clash on Thursday that kept both sides in with a chance of making the knockout phase\n\nThe Greeks had midfielder and captain Kostas Katsouranis sent off after 38 minutes for a second yellow, leaving his team mates facing a tough second 45 minutes.\n\nMatch #22: Group D at at the Corinthians arena, Sao Paulo.\n\nUruguay 1 (Suarez 39 85) England 1 (Rooney 75)\n\nLuis Suarez emerged from a month of treatment on his injured knee to score both goals as Uruguay beat England 2-1 to keep his team's World Cup hopes alive and leave England's hanging by a thread on Thursday.\n\nWayne Rooney hit the bar with a header in the first half but England looked badly off the pace, and the same loose marking that cost them dear against Italy in their first match allowed Suarez space to nod home Edinson Cavani's chipped cross after 39 minutes\n\nEngland equalised in the 75th minute when Rooney touched in a low Glen Johnson cross for his first-ever World Cup goal, but Suarez - the scourge of Premier League defences all season - lashed in the winner in the 85th minute after England failed to deal with a length-of-the field punt by goalkeeper Fernando Muslera.\n\nMatch #21: Group C at Estádio Nacional de Brasilia, Brasília\n\nColombia 2 (Rodriguez 64 Quintero 70) Ivory Coast 1 (Gervinho 73)\n\nColombia beat Ivory Coast 2-1 in yet another action-packed World Cup clash on Thursday to top Group C on six points and move within touching distance of making the knockout phase for the first time since 1990.\n\nAfter a tight first half the game exploded into life with three goals in nine minutes midway through the second, starting when Colombia's James Rodriguez thumped in a header from a 64th-minute Juan Cuadrado corner.\n\nJuan Quintero ran clear to make it 2-0 after 70 minutes after Rodriguez intercepted an Ivorian clearance but Gervinho cut in through three defenders to score an excellent individual goal three minutes later to halve the deficit.\n\nMatch #20: Group A at Arena Amazônia, Manaus\n\nCameroon 0 Croatia 4 (Olic 11 Perisic 48 Mandzukic 61, 73)\n\nCroatia gave themselves a fighting chance of reaching the World Cup knockout phase when they thrashed toothless Cameroon 4-0 on Wednesday, helped by a needless first-half red card for Alex Song as defeat condemned the African side to an early exit.\n\nIvica Olic put Croatia ahead after 11 minutes and Ivan Perisic seized on a poor clearance by Cameroon keeper Charles Itandje to race forward and drive in the second after 48. An unmarked Mario Mandzukic headed the third just after an hour and tapped in his second after 73 as Croatia strolled to a comfortable victory.\n\nCameroon, who have won only one game in five World Cups following their 1990 heroics, were reduced to 10 men five minutes before halftime when Song bizarrely elbowed Mandzukic in the back as the two man chased back in a benign situation on the halfway line and, without injured striker Samuel Eto'o, barely managed an attack all night.\n\nMatch #19: Group B at Estádio Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro\n\nSpain 0 Chile 2 (Vargas 20 Aranguiz 43)\n\nHard-working Chile overwhelmed an out-of-sorts Spain 2-0 to secure their - and the Netherlands' - place in the World Cup second round and eliminate the holders on a memorable night at the Maracana on Wednesday.\n\nChile had never beaten Spain in their 10 previous meetings but always looked the more enterprising, taking the lead with a brilliantly-worked Eduardo Vargas goal after 20 minutes and doubling their lead just before halftime when Charles Aranguiz banged in the rebound from a meek punch by keeper Iker Casillas.\n\nSpain, beaten 5-1 by the Netherlands in their opening Group B match, looked a shadow of the team that triumphed four years ago and won back-to-back European titles, with Sergio Busquets missing the best of their few chances early in the second half.\n\nMatch #18: Group B at Estádio Beira-Rio, Porto Alegre\n\nAustralia 2 (Cahill 21 Jedinak 54-pen) Netherlands 3 (Robben 20 van Persie 58 Depay 68)\n\nThe Netherlands beat Australia 3-2 in a sensational World Cup Group B match featuring stunning goals and non-stop action on Wednesday as the 2010 runners-up made it two wins out of two following their opening demolition of Spain.\n\nDutch winger Arjen Robben opened the scoring in the 20th minute when he ran from the halfway line before tucking the ball beyond Mat Ryan for this third goal of the tournament.\n\nTim Cahill replied immediately, however, by crashing a fantastic 20-metre volley into the roof of the net for what will be a strong contender for goal of the tournament.\n\nAustralia took a shock 2-1 lead with a 54th-minute Mile Jedinak penalty after Oliver Bozanic hammered the ball straight at Daryl Janmaat's arm but Robin van Persie levelled with his sharply-taken third of the tournament four minutes later.\n\nSubstitute Memphis Depay won it for the Dutch after 68 minutes when his low long-range shot somehow escaped the diving Ryan and went just inside a post.\n\nMatch #17: Group H at Arena Pantanal, Cuiabá\n\nRussia 1 (Kerzhakov 74) South Korea 1 (Keunho 68)\n\nRussia's Alexander Kerzhakov came to the rescue, scoring three minutes after coming on as a substitute to secure a 1-1 World Cup draw with South Korea after his goalkeeper had gifted the Asians the lead in their Group H match on Tuesday.\n\nHorrified Igor Akinfeev allowed a straightforward Lee Keun-ho shot from 25 metres to slip through his fingers after 68 minutes of the final match of the tournament's opening round of fixtures.\n\nNeither team had looked dangerous until that point, but the goal shook Russia into life and Kerzhakov pounced after more scrappy goalkeeping by Jung Sung-ryong in the 74th minute.\n\nMatch #16: Group A at the Castelao arena, Fortaleza\n\nBrazil 0 Mexico 0\n\nGoalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa made two outstanding saves to deny Neymar as battling Mexico held Brazil to a 0-0 draw in their World Cup Group A match on Tuesday, ending the hosts' 10-game winning streak in the process.\n\nOchoa went full length to brilliantly beat out a header from Neymar in the first half, blocked a fierce shot from the forward in the second and then stopped a thumping Thiago Silva header on the line late on, as they denied the hosts.\n\nMatch #15: Group H at Estádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte\n\nBelgium 2 (Fellaini 70 Mertens 80) Algeria 1 (Feghouli 25-pen)\n\nTwo goals in 10 second-half minutes by substitutes Marouane Fellaini and Dries Mertens gave Belgium a 2-1 comeback victory over Algeria after the north Africans had threatened a shock result in their World Cup Group H match on Tuesday.\n\nAlgeria had not scored in more than eight hours of World Cup tournament play dating back to 1986, but ended that streak with a Sofiane Feghouli penalty after 25 minutes, awarded when he was clumsily pulled back by Jan Vertonghen.\n\nBelgium struggled to make an impact until Kevin De Bruyne picked out Fellaini, on as a substitute four minutes earlier, to cleverly head in from 13 metres after 70 minutes.\n\nYet another World Cup comeback was completed 10 minutes later when fellow sub Mertens lashed in the second from a tight angle.\n\nMatch #14: Group D at Estádio das Dunas, Natal\n\nGhana 1 (Ayew 82) United States 2 (Dempsey 1 Brooks 86)\n\nUnited States beat Ghana 2-1 in their World Cup Group G clash on Monday with Clint Dempsey scoring the first goal after just 30 seconds and German-born John Brooks getting a dramatic winner.\n\nAndre Ayew equalised for Ghana eight minutes before the end.\n\nBut Brooks' first goal for his adopted country made Jurgen Klinsmann's 50th match in charge of the United States a memorable one.\n\nMatch #13: Group F at Arena da Baixada, Curitiba\n\nIran 0 Nigeria 0\n\nIran and Nigeria laboured to the first stalemate of a scintillating World Cup on Monday with a dismal 0-0 draw that left both sides still chasing their first victory at a finals since 1998.\n\nMatch #12: Group G at Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador\n\nGermany 3 (Mueller 12-pen, 45+1, 78\" Hummels 32\") Portugal 0\n\nThomas Mueller's hat-trick inspired Germany to a 4-0 mauling of 10-man Portugal in their opening World Cup Group G match on Monday.\n\nTwo Mueller goals and a thumping Mats Hummels header blew away a Portugal side whose misery was compounded by a needless 37th-minute red card for Pepe.\n\nHummels powered home the second from a corner on 32 minutes before Mueller, top scorer at the World Cup four years ago, stole in ahead of a sleepy Bruno Alves to smash in the third in first-half stoppage-time.\n\nMatch #11: Group F at Estádio Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nArgentina 2 (Kolasinac 3\"-OG Messi 65\") Bosnia 1 (Ibisevic 85\")\n\nLionel Messi scored a stunning second-half goal to push staggering Argentina to a 2-1 victory over Bosnia Sunday at the Maracana in the Group F opener for both teams.\n\nMessi lifted Argentina in the 65th minute, moving in from the right and striking a low left-footed shot off the inside of the post behind Bosnian keeper Asmir Begovic.\n\nIt was Messi's second World Cup goal, adding to one he scored eight years ago in Germany.\n\nArgentina took a 1-0 lead in the third minute on an own-goal by defender Sead Kolasinac.\n\nFor the remainder of the half, Argentina showed little with Messi seldom touching the ball and Bosnia - a World Cup debutant - looking more threatening.\n\nMatch #10: Group E at Estádio Beira-Rio, Porto Alegre.\n\nFrance 3 (Benzema 45-pen 72 Valladares 48-OG) Honduras 0\n\nA moment of madness in the first half and a landmark goalline technology ruling in the second helped France to a 3-0 victory over Honduras in their Group E World Cup clash on Sunday.\n\nWilson Palacios charged into French midfielder Paul Pogba seconds before the break in a reckless challenge that had him sent-off for a second booking, and Karim Benzema smashed home the resulting penalty to give France a lead they deserved having dominated the first 45 minutes.\n\nFrance doubled their advantage after 48 minutes when Benzema lashed the ball against the inside of a post and saw it rebound against keeper Noel Valladares and though he scooped it clear, the goal was awarded after the intervention of goalline technology that said the whole ball had crossed the line.\n\nBenzema made it three with a piledriver in the 72nd minute to complete the win that put France top of their group on goal difference ahead of top seeds Switzerland, who beat Ecuador 2-1 in the dying seconds of their clash in Brasilia earlier on Sunday.\n\nMatch #9: Group E at the Brasilia national stadium, Brasilia\n\nSwitzerland 2 (Mehmedi 48 Seferovic (90+3) Ecuador 1 (Valencia 22)\n\nA stoppage-time goal by substitute Haris Seferovic gave Switzerland a 2-1 World Cup Group E win over Ecuador on Sunday.\n\nThe teams had looked as if they were about to produce the first draw of the tournament, until Seferovic's dramatic winner.\n\nEnner Valencia headed Ecuador into the lead after 22 minutes as the South Americans showed plenty of attacking invention, but Admir Mehmedi headed an equaliser three minutes after coming on as a halftime substitute.\n\nSwitzerland thought they had won it in the 70th minute when Josip Drmic latched onto a through ball to score, only for a linesman to flag it offside.\n\nBut Seferovic did get the winner after a length-of the field breakaway following a brilliant advantage play by the referee.\n\nMatch #8: Group C at Arena Pernambuco, Recife\n\nIvory Coast 2 (Bony 64 Gervinho 66) Japan 2 (Honda 16)\n\nTwo sharply-headed goals within three second-half minutes gave Ivory Coast a 2-1 Group C victory over Japan as the World Cup's four-game 'Super Saturday' concluded with yet another hugely entertaining match.\n\nKeisuke Honda's fierce left-foot drive after 16 minutes had Japan ahead, but the introduction of substitute Didier Drogba just after the hour seemed to lift the Africans and almost immediately they turned the game on its head.\n\nWilfried Bony headed the equaliser after 64 minutes and the Ivorians had only just concluded their dancing celebrations when Gervinho glanced in the second, both goals coming from pinpoint crosses by Serge Aurier.\n\nIvory Coast join Colombia on three points atop the open-looking group after Colombia's 3-0 victory over Greece earlier on Saturday.\n\nMatch #7: Group D at Arena Amazônia, Manaus\n\nEngland 1 (Sturridge 37) Italy 2 (Marchisio 35 Balotelli 50)\n\nMario Balotelli headed the decisive goal as Italy emerged 2-1 winners over England in another high quality World Cup match in the Amazon jungle on Saturday, to gain a key early advantage in a Group D containing three former tournament winners.\n\nClaudio Marchisio fired Italy ahead after 35 minutes when England were wrong-footed by an Andrea Pirlo dummy, but Daniel Sturridge levelled within three minutes after Wayne Rooney picked him out with a perfect left-wing cross.\n\nBalotelli, who had a clever lob cleared off the line at the end of the first half, made it 2-1 five minutes into the second when he took advantage of ragged defending to head home.\n\nEngland played some confident football trying to find the equaliser but Italy's defence buckled down and kept them at bay to take them to three points alongside Costa Rica, who upset 2010 semi-finalists Uruguay 3-1 earlier on Saturday.\n\nMatch #6: Group D at Estádio Castelão, Fortaleza\n\nUruguay 1 (Cavani 24-pen) Costa Rica 3 Campbell 54 Duarte 57 Urena 84)\n\nTwo goals in four dramatic second-half minutes set lowly Costa Rica on their way to a deserved 3-1 victory over Uruguay in the biggest upset of the World Cup so far.\n\nThe Uruguayans took the lead in the Group D clash thanks to a disputed Edinson Cavani penalty midway through the first half before the Central Americans turned the match on its head after the break.\n\nYoung striker Joel Campbell chested down a cross from the right and slammed a low shot past keeper Fernando Muslera after 54 minutes.\n\nThen centre back Oscar Duarte gave Costa Rica the lead in the 57th minute with a brave diving header at the back post from a Christian Bolanos free kick.\n\nMarco Urena completed the remarkable victory with a third in the 84th minute, silencing an army of sky blue-clad Uruguayan fans in Fortaleza's Castelao arena.\n\nUruguay's misery was compounded in stoppage time when their defender Maxi Pereira became the first man to be sent off at this World Cup.\n\nMatch #5: Group C at the Mineirao stadium in Belo Horizonte\n\nColombia 3 (Armero 5 Gutierrez 58 Rodriguez 90+3) Greece 0\n\nColombia marked their return to the World Cup after a 16-year absence with an attacking display that earned a 3-0 victory over Greece on Saturday, and the early initiative in what looks to be a really tight Group C.\n\nThe South Americans went ahead after five minutes when great work by Juan Cuadrado set up Pablo Armero.\n\nTeofilo Gutierrez poked in the second after 58 minutes and James Rodriguez drove in a left foot effort in stoppage time at the end of another game full of high-paced action.\n\nGreece struggled to get a foothold in the match and their hopes of a comeback fell away after Theofanis Gekas crashed a header against the bar from point-blank range after 63 minutes.\n\nMatch #4: Group B at Arena Pantanal, Cuiabá\n\nChile 3 (Sanchez 12 Valdivia 14 Beausejour 90+2) Australia 1 (Cahill 35)\n\nChile got the victory they needed if they are to have any chance of progressing from a daunting Group B when they held off a strong Australian fightback to emerge 3-1 winners in another open and entertaining World Cup clash on Friday.\n\nAlexis Sanchez put Chile ahead from close range after 12 minutes and two minutes later Jorge Valdivia made it 2-0 with a well-struck shot as the South Americans looked in control.\n\nAustralia fought back strongly, though, and Tim Cahill replied with a header after 35 minutes and thought he had equalized with another early in the second half only to have it ruled offside by an excellent linesman's decision.\n\nBoth sides went close in an end-to-end second half before Jean Beausejour grabbed a third for Chile in stoppage time.\n\nMatch #3: Group B at the Fonte Nova arena, Salvador\n\nSpain 1 (Xabi Alonso 27-pen) Netherlands 5 (van Persie 44, 72, Robben 53, 80, de Vrij 64)\n\nTwo goals each by Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben helped the Netherlands destroy world and European champions Spain 5-1 in a sensational World Cup Group B opener on Friday - a repeat of the 2010 final.\n\nSpain, who lost their opening game of the 2010 tournament to Switzerland, went ahead with a 27th-minute Xabi Alonso penalty but Dutch captain Van Persie equalised with an audacious diving, looping header a minute before the break.\n\nThe Netherlands, playing with swagger and working tirelessly to close down the holders, went ahead in the 53rd minute when Robben pulled down a long ball from Daley Blind, delivered his trademark cutback and swept the ball home.\n\nStefan de Vrij bundled in the third in the 64th minute, Van Persie, who also crashed a shot against the bar, got the fourth following a blunder by Spain keeper Iker Casillas and Robben completed the amazing victory in the 80th minute.\n\nMatch #2: Group A at Natal\n\nMexico 1 (Peralta 61) Cameroon 0\n\nMexico overcame the setback of having two early goals harshly disallowed to beat Cameroon 1-0 with a second-half strike by Oribe Peralta and join Brazil at the top of World Cup Group A with three points on Friday.\n\nMexico, on top throughout, were goalless at halftime after Giovani Dos Santos had a neat volley and a header from a corner both ruled out for offside in decisions TV replays showed were wrong.\n\nIn relentless rain they continued to dominate, though, and broke through after 61 minutes when a Dos Santos shot was parried by the keeper into the path of Peralta who tucked it in.\n\nSamuel Eto'o clipped a post early on for Cameroon but they did little in attack and have now still won only one game in their last five World Cups, having become the first African team to reach the quarter-finals in 1990.\n\nMatch #1: Group A at Sao Paulo\n\nBrazil 3 (Neymar 29, 71-pen, Oscar 90+1) Croatia 1 (Marcelo 11-og)\n\nNeymar hit two goals including a bitterly contested penalty to lead Brazil to a 3-1 victory over Croatia in the opening match of the World Cup on Thursday.\n\nCroatia took a shock lead in the Group A game when Marcelo scored an own goal in the 11th minute.\n\nNeymar pulled Brazil level after 30 minutes and Croatia reacted with fury when Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura pointed to the penalty spot in the second half after Fred backed into Croatian defender Dejan Lovren and fell.\n\nCroatian coach Niko Kovac said that Nishimura was \"out of his depth\" and called the penalty \"ridiculous.\"\n\nBarcelona golden boy Neymar, who was also booked and lucky not to be sent off, converted the penalty to put Brazil ahead. Chelsea midfielder Oscar scored a brilliant individual goal to seal the crucial victory.\n\nPREVIEWS\n\nGroup A\n\nGroup B\n\nGroup C\n\nGroup

saving two spot-kicks in a shootout against Chile to send them into the last eight 3-2 on penalties following a pulsating 1-1 draw after extra time.\n\nFour years to the day since Brazil eliminated Chile at the same stage of the 2010 tournament, they did it again when Gonzalo Jara crashed his spot-kick against the post after Cesar had twice denied the battling Chileans.\n\nMan-of-the-match Cesar, heavily criticised four years ago after Brazil's World Cup exit to the Netherlands, also made an outstanding save in the second half of normal time as the five-times champions moved unconvincingly into a quarter-final against Uruguay or Colombia.\n\nDavid Luiz had put Brazil ahead after 18 minutes but Alexis Sanchez equalised for battling Chile before halftime and the host nation watched with bated breath as Brazil were on the brink of elimination after Willian and Hulk had failed to convert their spot-kicks.\n\nFortunately for Brazil, Cesar also saved penalties from Mauricio Pinilla and Alexis before Jara's doomed attempt.\n\n\"It was complicated,\" Cesar said. \"The pressure of representing Brazil and playing at home is really great. We played well in the first half but after Chile equalised they got into the game.\"\n\n\"My team mates gave me support and strength. My big dream is that Brazil have a party,\" said the keeper after helping avoid Brazil's first home defeat in a competitive game since 1975.\n\nFor Chile it was a bitter end to a promising World Cup after beating holders Spain in the group stage to cement their status as tournament dark horses.\n\nThey failed, however, to exorcise their Brazilian demons once again and fell to them at the same stage as in 1998 and 2010, the last two times they were in the tournament.\n\nThey have never managed to beat Brazil at home and have won just seven of 69 games against them.\n\nThe Brazilians, who have now eliminated their fellow South Americans in four World Cups including in the 1962 semi-finals in Chile, set a blistering pace and Marcelo took a first crack at goal with a volley that sailed wide.\n\nChile quickly lost the battle in midfield but their defence kept tournament joint top scorer Neymar in check.\n\nThey were helpless, though, when Neymar whipped in a corner in the 18th minute, Thiago Silva headed it on and Luiz, with what looked like some help from Chile's Jara, bundled it in for his first international goal in his 40th appearance.\n\nPOURING FORWARD\n\nWith the small red patches of Chile fans in the Mineirao stadium swallowed up by a vast sea of yellow shirts, five-times champions Brazil kept pouring forward and Neymar should have done better when he raced clear, only to drive a low shot wide.\n\nChile, however, levelled 14 minutes later after making the most of a throw-in mix-up between Hulk and Marcelo to send Alexis into the box and the forward drilled the ball in to stun the crowd into temporary silence.\n\nNeymar went agonisingly close with a header that scraped past the post and controlled a superb deep cross-field ball to set up Fred who fired over.\n\nDani Alves tested Claudio Bravo with a thundering long-range effort but the Chile keeper did well to tip it over the bar.\n\nBrazil, who had won nine of their previous 10 games against Chile, thought they had scored again early in the second half when Hulk controlled a deep cross and scuffed the ball in but referee Howard Webb booked the forward for handball.\n\nWith the clock ticking and Brazil getting more nervous, the Chileans felt confident they could pull off a huge upset, similar to Brazil's shock defeat in the 1950 World Cup final against Uruguay, known as 'Maracanazo'.\n\nCesar pulled off a sensational save to deny Charles Aranguiz from point-blank range in a scintillating game in front of 58,000 spectators in which one wrong pass would potentially prove costly.\n\nChile, running on empty in extra time, almost snatched a dramatic last-minute winner when Pinilla rattled the crossbar with a tremendous shot but Brazil survived the scare with their fans looking to the skies and praying before the penalties started.\n\n\"That near goal right at the end has been really hard for us,\" Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli told reporters.\n\n\"If we had scored, we would have made history for ever. It would have been the 'Mineirazo'. We so nearly won,\" he said.\n\nLuiz, Marcelo and Neymar converted their penalties and although Willian missed the target and Hulk's effort was saved, Cesar denied Pinilla and Alexis and when Jara sent his effort against the inside of the post the stadium erupted in celebration.\n\n\"It's at time like this you get your support from friends and team mates and thanks to Julio who made great saves,\" Hulk said.\n\n\"God willing we will go to the end and make the final. We suffered but we made it. We knew this would be a very hard game, it went to extra time but even with cramps we ran till the end.\"\n\nPENALTY SHOOT-OUT\n\nBrazil 3 Chile 2: Gonzalo Jara's kick hits the right post to send Brazil into the quarter-finals.\n\nBrazil 3 Chile 2: Neymar slides the ball into the centre sending Bravo the other way.\n\nBrazil 2 Chile 2: Hulk's shot is blocked by Bravo.\n\nBrazil 2 Chile 2: Diaz makes no mistake.\n\nBrazil 2 Chile 1: Aranguiz scores the first one for Chile blasting into the roof of the net.\n\nBrazil 2 Chile 0: Marcelo makes no mistake.\n\nBrazil 1 Chile 0: Chile can't seem to get past Cesar who blocks Sanchez's shot.\n\nBrazil 1 Chile 0: Willian misses with Brazil's second kick even as Bravo goes the wrong way.\n\nBrazil 1 Chile 0: Pinilla fires Chile's kick straight to Cesar.\n\nBrazil 1 Chile 0: David Luiz makes no mistake with the first kick.\n\nFULL TIME\n\nBrazil 1 (Luiz 18\") Chile 1 (Sanchez 32\")\n\nWebb has blown the final whistle in extra-time as the match is taken to a penalty shoot-out, the 23rd in World Cup history.\n\n120+1\" Neymar and Hulk break to win a corner while Ramires is just wide of the near post.\n\n120\" Chile comes agonisingly close with Pinilla hitting the cross bar.\n\n119\" Hulk fires a last ditch attempt to score the winning goal way off target.\n\n118\" A long range Willian free kick comes up against the red wall.\n\n116\" Brazil pass the ball around deftly but fail to break of solid ring in defence of Chile.\n\n113\" Diaz sends a shot sailing into the back of the stand.\n\n112\" Alves fires a long range shot wide after Willian plays a free kick to him.\n\n110\" Two Chile players are down at the moment as they seem to play for the penalty shoot-out.\n\n108\" Chile are forced to make a change as Rojas comes on for the injured Medel.\n\n107\" Jo heads a Neymar corner over the cross bar.\n\n106\" Oscar makes way for his Chelsea team mate Willian as Brazil get the second period of extra-time under way.\n\nHALF-TIME\n\nBrazil 1 (Luiz 18\") Chile 1 (Sanchez 32\")\n\n105+1\" YELLOW!

Alexis Sanchez leads the attack for 'La Roja' (The Red) at the Mineirao stadium in Belo Horizonte.\n\nHulk and Fred add to Brazil's firepower in the hosts' widely-expected lineup.\n\nTeams for Saturday's 2014 World Cup Round of 16 match between Brazil and Chile at the Mineirao stadium, Belo Horizonte.\n\nTEAMS\n\nBrazil: 12-Julio Cesar; 2-Daniel Alves, 3-Thiago Silva, 4-David Luiz, 6-Marcelo; 5-Fernandinho, 11-Oscar, 17-Luiz Gustavo, 7-Hulk; 9-Fred, 10-Neymar\n\nSubstitutes: 1-Jefferson, 8-Paulinho, 13-Dante, 14-Maxwell, 15-Henrique, 16-Ramires, 18-Hernanes, 19-Willian, 20-Bernard, 21-Jo, 22-Victor, 23-Maicon\n\nChile: 1-Claudio Bravo; 4-Mauricio Isla, 17-Gary Medel, 18-Gonzalo Jara, 2-Eugenio Mena; 20-Charles Aranguiz, 21-Marcelo Diaz, 5-Francisco Silva, 8-Arturo Vidal; 7-Alexis Sanchez, 11-Eduardo Vargas\n\nSubstitutes: 3-Miiko Albornoz, 6-Carlos Carmona, 9-Mauricio Pinilla, 10-Jorge Valdivia, 12-Cristopher Toselli, 13-Jose Rojas, 14-Fabian Orellana, 15-Jean Beausejour, 16-Felipe\n\nGutierrez, 19-Jose Pedro Fuenzalida, 22-Esteban Paredes, 23-Johnny Herrera\n\nReferee: Howard Webb (England)\n\nPREVIEW\n\nBrazil know that their outstanding past record against Chile will count for nothing when the sides meet in an all-South American World Cup last-16 tie at the Mineirao in Belo Horizonte on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe tournament hosts have lost just eight of 68 previous meetings with Chile, and have emerged triumphant in all three past encounters in the World Cup, scoring 11 goals in the process.\n\nThat run includes a comfortable 3-0 win against Marcelo Bielsa's Chile side at the same stage of the 2010 finals in South Africa, but midfielder Willian insists that Brazilian fans should not automatically expect a repeat performance.\n\n\"Football nowadays has changed so much. Of course Brazil have beaten Chile a few times before, which is good. But we must not think about this. Every game has its own story. I am sure that Chile will be motivated and confident too,\" said the Chelsea player.\n\nBrazil have yet to live up to the high expectations surrounding them at these finals despite collecting seven points from a possible nine in the group stage.\n\nIn contrast, Chile have impressed, notably in sending the holders Spain packing from the competition with a 2-0 win at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOnly a 2-0 defeat to the Netherlands in their final Group B match on Monday condemned them to second place and another meeting with Brazil.\n\nHowever, Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has admitted that he would have chosen different opponents for his side than Chile, who drew 2-2 at the Mineirao in a friendly in April last year and narrowly lost 2-1 when the teams clashed in Canada last November.\n\nStriker Fred, who scored his first goal of the tournament in Brazil's 4-1 win against Cameroon on Monday, believes it will be an open encounter against a Chile side who operate with a three-man defence and look to the class of Alexis Sanchez and Arturo Vidal going forward.\n\n\"Chile are tactically very strong and play with great commitment. And going forward they have players who can make the difference,\" said the 30-year-old.\n\n\"We have seen some of their games. The way the tournament has been I think they will look to attack and Brazil will do the same.\"\n\nChile have not reached the quarter-finals since they hosted the tournament in 1962, when they were eventually eliminated in the last four by Brazil.\n\nHowever, the current side, coached by Argentine Jorge Sampaoli, are confident that they can capitalise on the enormous weight of pressure on Brazil and upset the odds.\n\n\"If I thought we were going to lose, I would go back to my room, collect my things and go home,\" said Sanchez, who will come up against his Barcelona club colleagues Daniel Alves and Neymar.\n\n\"We have respect for them, but I think we are going to beat them. We came to this World Cup to make history. We beat the world champions, and although we had a slip-up against Holland, we are going out to try and win the Cup.\n\n\"These games are to be enjoyed. We are confident and at the same time we know what we have to do to beat a team containing some of the best players in the world.\"\n\nSampaoli was left fuming on Thursday when a helicopter from Brazilian television station O Globo hovered over his squad's training session in the Belo Horizonte suburbs in an apparent attempt to glean clues as to the possible Chile line-up.\n\nDefender Gary Medel picked up an ankle knock in training, but if he recovers, Chile should be at full strength, with Vidal set to feature after being rested for the Netherlands defeat.\n\nBrazil are monitoring a slight back injury suffered by centre-back David Luiz in training, while Fernandinho could come into the midfield at the expense of Paulinho after impressing as a substitute against Cameroon.\n\nThe winners will go through to another all-South American tie in the quarter-finals, against either Colombia or Uruguay in Fortaleza.\n\nBrazil hit back at Chile referee concerns\n\nMeanwhile, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) on Friday said questioning the integrity of the referee for Saturday's World Cup last-16 tie between Brazil and Chile was \"primitive and immature\".\n\nChile forward Alexis Sanchez and the president of the country's Football Association Sergio Jadue have expressed concern in the build-up to Saturday's game in Belo Horizonte that English referee Howard Webb might be influenced by the huge home support at the Mineirao.\n\n\"The only thing I fear is the refereeing,\" said Sanchez on Thursday when asked about the prospect of facing the tournament hosts.\n\nHowever, when Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was asked to offer his thoughts during Friday's eve-of-game press conference, CBF press officer Rodrigo Paiva intervened.\n\n\"To talk about this subject is primitive and immature. Applying this kind of pressure is ridiculous,\" he said.\n\n\"Not only is it disrespectful towards Fifa, the referee and the Brazil team with their 100-year history of winning, but it is also disrespectful towards the people of Brazil.\"\n\nJadue called for a \"top-level referee\" to take charge of Saturday's game, and Webb has plenty of experience, having notably been the man in the middle for the 2010 World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands in South Africa.\n\nFive previous Brazil-Chile clashes\n\nAhead of their World Cup last 16 clash in Belo Horizonte on Saturday, AFP Sport takes a look at five of the best past meetings between Brazil and Chile:\n\nSantiago, June 13, 1962. World Cup semi-final: Brazil 4-2 Chile\n\nThe holders faced the hosts in the last four of the 1962 finals and a Brazil side inspired by the brilliant Garrincha triumphed to move a step closer to retaining the Jules Rimet trophy.\n\nGarrincha scored twice in the first half for Brazil, and Vava added two more in the second period, with Jorge Toro and Leonel Sanchez netting, in vain, for Chile.\n\nGarrincha was sent off towards the end but was allowed to play in the final, which saw Brazil beat Czechoslovakia 3-1. Chile, meanwhile, went on to finish third.\n\nRio de Janeiro, September 3, 1989. World Cup qualifier: Brazil 2-0 Chile\n\nBrazil's defeat to Uruguay in the deciding game of the 1950 World Cup is remembered as the 'Maracanazo'. But in Chile the word describes the events of September 3, 1989.\n\nThat night at the famous venue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Chile clashed in a crucial qualifier for the 1990 World Cup.\n\nThe hosts were leading 1-0 midway through the second half when a firecracker thrown from the crowd appeared to hit Chile goalkeeper Roberto Rojas on the head.\n\nThe bloodied Rojas left the field on a stretcher, but it was later discovered he had inflicted the wound himself using a razor blade hidden in his glove.\n\nBrazil were awarded a 2-0 win and Chile were banned from qualifying for the 1994 World Cup, while Rojas was given a lifetime ban.\n\nParis, June 27, 1998. World Cup round of 16: Brazil 4-1 Chile\n\nBrazil were the holders while Chile were appearing in their first finals since 1982. However, the latter had scraped through their group with three draws and were outclassed at the Parc des Princes.\n\nCesar Sampaio and Ronaldo both scored twice for Brazil, who went on to lose the final to France, while Marcelo Salas got one back for Chile.\n\nJohannesburg, June 28, 2010. World Cup round of 16: Brazil 3-0 Chile\n\nOnce again Brazil proved too strong in a World Cup showdown for their South American rivals, who had looked good in South Africa under Marcelo Bielsa.\n\nJuan and Luis Fabiano scored in the first half before Robinho added another late on as the Selecao cruised into the last eight, where they lost 2-1 to the Netherlands.\n\nBelo Horizonte, April 24, 2013: Brazil 2-2 Chile\n\nThe first of two entertaining friendlies between the sides last year was played at the Mineirao, the same venue where they will meet on Saturday.\n\nRever and Neymar scored for Luiz Felipe Scolari's team either side of strikes by Mark Gonzalez and Eduardo Vargas for Chile.\n\nHowever, the majority of players who featured in that match will not be involved on this occasion."
