The Fred Smith (footballer) article is exactly as per the info on www.allfootballers.com. Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nI have now created a stub article on the above player at Frederick Smith (footballer). As there are at least 11 Fred or Frederick Smiths (including one who played for Southampton) listed at www.allfootballers.com, there will be a problem with disambiguation at some time. Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nThis Ashton/Hurst site gives a bit more detail on his non-league career. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nAnd for that matter, are Fred Howard and Fred Howard (footballer born 1893) different guys? The birth dates differ, but one might be a typo. Both seem to have connections with Walkden and both played for Ayr United, but the former makes no mention of Derby County or Gillingham....... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nAccording to www.allfootballers.com, Julian Frederick Howard, born Long Eaton (no date given) played for Derby County in 1919-20, then joined Gillingham in January 1920, before moving to Ayr United in 1921 or 1922. He played as an inside forward (No. 8 or 9).\n\nFrederick J Howard, born Walkden 1893, played as centre-forward for Walkden United, joining Manchester City in 1912. He then played for various Welsh & Scottish sides (including Ayr United) before joining Port Vale in 1923, followed by spells with New Brighton, Wrexham and Welshpool. Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nI have now added infoboxes to both articles incorporating the details from www.allfootballers.com, but this now leaves a problem with regard to the article names. It seems that Fred Howard was born in 1893, but the player in the article Fred Howard (footballer born 1893) probably wasn't and his birth year is unknown, so his article title is misleading, but what should it be moved to? Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nFor the sake of completeness, I should add that there was a third Fred Howard, date of birth unknown, who played over 50 games for Barnsley in the 1890s. Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nFWIW, a search of FreeBMD returns\n\nonly one variant on Fred Howard born in the Shardlow district, which covers Long Eaton, which is a Frederick James Howard birth registered in the first quarter of 1895, so born in late 1894 or early 1895.\n\nA Fred (not Frederick) Howard birth registered in q1 1894, i.e. born late 1893 or early 1894, in Salford district which i think covers Walkden.\n\nNo Julian Howards at all.\n\nI realise none of this proves anything, but just a bit of additional information, in case it helps. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nI have now moved Fred Howard (footballer born 1893) to Frederick Howard (footballer). Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nFor the record, both the books cited in Frederick Howard (footballer) do give his DOB as 1893...... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\n..before and after a significant overhaul. Any opinions on further improvements or is it just fine as it is now? --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nIt is better, but could really do with some prose for context rather than being just a set of tables. The bright colours on \"Round by round\" cause accessibility problems. Oldelpaso (talk)\n\nAh, that \"special\" table. I think that it should be dropped because of various concerns including redundancy (wins and losses are already represented in the Results table) and size (that table alone has a whopping 20k). The color accesibility problems might just add to this argument. --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nIs there any need for Top 10 english football clubs? King of the North East\n\nCould easily be merged into English football records or something like that. I dont know if a whole new article is needed chandler ···\n\nI agree with Chandler, its very similar to the summary tables in both List of football clubs in England by major honours won, List of English football champions and Football records in England#Most successful clubs overall (1871 - present). Surely a seperate list for this isn't needed. Partial content fork of those articles. Sunderland06 (talk)\n\nI have redirected it to List of football clubs in England by major honours won, since the content is the same as the first 10 entries. Cheers for the replies. King of the North East\n\nGiven that nothing links to it, and it is a most unlikely search item, is there any value in retaining it? Kevin McE (talk)\n\nNot really, I wouldn't object if it was deleted entirely. King of the North East\n\nSporting Limburg was a planned project for a merger involving Roda JC and Fortuna Sittard. However, this project was cancelled days ago due to the Limburg province refusing to financially back it. So, we have an article about a club that never existed and will not. What to do about this? --Angelo (talk)\n\nAttach a short summary of what happened to each of the club articles and nuke the cinderella. Wiggy! (talk)\n\nHi guys, I am having a dispute with a user regarding the Fabio Liverani article. This user is still continuously indicating him as a Somali-Italian, using a source from Goal.com that does not really mention about Liverani having Somali citizenship, but just calls him a Somali-Italian. However, if you call him a Somali-Italian, it means he has both citizenship, which is unproven. All I know is that his mother is Somali, which not necessarily means he has Somali citizenship. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. --Angelo (talk)\n\nHi, user User:Stlunatic071 is insisting that some players like Edin Džeko‎ (born 1986), Vedad Ibišević‎ (born 1984) are born in Bosnia and Herzegovina (which didn't exist at that time) instead of SFR Yugoslavia. I (and some other users) keep reverting him because as far as I am aware, it is consensus to use the country's name at the time of birth. Is this still consensus? --Jaellee (talk)\n\nI think its a wikipedia wide consensus to yes, use the country of birth, not the current country the city is in chandler ···\n\nIs this consensus written down somewhere? I'd like to point people at it from time to time, because like Jaellee, I'm bored with the reverts--ClubOranjeT\n\nHow about WP:Proper_names 'An article about Junipero Serra should say he lived in Alta Mexico not the U.S. state of California because the latter entity did not exist at the time of Junipero Serra.' That seems to be the best in this case. Sometimes WP:PLACE is also useful, but that doesn't really have anything to say in this instance. Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nThanks for pointing out WP:Proper_names, I will try to explain this to the user, but I'm afraid that he won't see reason. --Jaellee (talk)\n\nUser:Stlunatic071 insists on his point of view, the edit warring goes on and I'm afraid I'm in it. So maybe some others might keep an eye on Edin Džeko‎ and Vedad Ibišević‎. --Jaellee (talk)\n\nI'm happy to keep an eye on this too. I've been involved in the editing of the Bosnian guy's pages (I have the same POV as you). --JonBroxton (talk)\n\nThe problem is the way the Cup used to be scheduled, in the past some seasons the league cup would finish in the first half of the season but some would be spread over two years which means that some years there would be two finals which results in articles like this. Surely the article cannot stay there when the match was not even played in the year shown in the title. Also when a competition is within one year (i.e. the first part of the season) should it not just show the year in which the competition was played so Scottish League Cup 1957-58 could be Scottish League Cup 1957. Darryl.matheson (talk)\n\nSounds like everything should be at a season-based title, as that way there would be no ambiguity. Oldelpaso (talk)\n\nIf it was the final of the 1983-84 competition and it was held in 1984, why on earth is it at 1983 Scottish League Cup Final in the first place???!?! I'd say for consistency the articles on each season's competition should have the full season in the title, but the finals should use whatever calendar year they took place in. Although presumably (thinking aloud) there may have been the odd year when two finals took place.......? -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nThe problem is that there were two Scottish League Cup finals in 1984. The 1983–84 competition was finished in March 1984, and the 1984–85 competition was finished in October 1984. There also weren't any finals in 1999, because the 1998–99 final was played in the autumn, whereas the 1999–2000 final was played in the spring. All of the finals since then have been in the spring. Jmorrison230582 (talk)\n\n1984 Scottish League Cup Final (March) and 1984 Scottish League Cup Final (October)? It's obviously completely ridiculous to have an article entitled 1983 Scottish League Cup Final when it took place in 1984..... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nNo, that's right, it's the same thing as the two 1974 General Elections, an event which commonly happens once in a year happening twice is then disambiguated by the month (February 74 and October 74 in that case). Jmorrison230582 (talk)\n\nBest to avoid the format March 1984 Scottish League Cup Final, though, as it would throw out the sequencing in the category...... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nI have moved the articles as suggested, The template will now have to be changed. Darryl.matheson (talk)\n\nAn editor under the name User:Waterspaces and IPs beginning 79.66... has been making disruptive edits on a number of articles including Everton F.C., Liverpool F.C., Anfield and Goodison Park. Disruptive edits include worsening of the prose, disparaging the current prose as amateurish without clear rationale, personal attacks, straying off-topic, POV pushing. Basically everything. I'd appreciate it if others could help resolve this situation as it's getting to be quite a handful. Sillyfolkboy (talk)\n\nHe certainly has some interesting opinions about what constitutes good prose. – Toon(talk)\n\nI have semi-protected Everton F.C., Anfield and Goodison Park for three days to bring a halt to the disruption. Liverpool F.C. is already semi-protected. More eyes would be useful. --Malcolmxl5 (talk)\n\nI've raised it to full protection for a week since the dispute hasn't stopped. – Toon(talk)\n\nSame disruptive and abusive editor has started on History of Everton F.C. too. Dancarney (talk)\n\nI've just discovered the ancestry.co.uk website and after performing this search, in which I entered the name \"Emile William Ivanhoe Heskey\" and the date of birth 1978, the search hasn't brought a definite result. But the one with the most relevant result is a \"Emily William I Heskey\", born in either \"Leicestershire, Rutland, Derbyshire or Nottinghamshire\". Quite a bit like Emile Heskey. Um... err... have I just stumbled upon quite an embarrasing cover-up?! Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nTypos or misinterpretaitons of handwriting are common on that site, so it wouldn't be unlikely that the birth certificate has been misrepresented. If you can view the scanned image of the birth certificate (assuming you're only referring to the text entry), you can decide for yourself. Heightwatcher (talk)\n\nThere are multiple discussions going on in American soccer land that could use commenting from people who have been following footy on WP for more than a month. I was tentative to post this, given the attitude most editors have about American soccer, but things have stagnated, so here goes:\n\nTemplate talk:2009 Major League Soccer season table has a discussion about whether berths to a secondary international competition, SuperLiga, should be displayed in the standings from the beginning of the season, even though the exact places awarded berths might change due to cup competitions, etc. The fact that Europa League berths are displayed from the beginning of the season in all European articles, despite the fact that they might be altered by cup competitions, etc. has been largely ignored.\n\nTemplate talk:2009 Major League Soccer Western Conference table has a discussion about whether the links in the standings table should go to the club article (Seattle Sounders FC for example) or the club's season article (2009 Seattle Sounders FC season for example). Those arguing that we should link to club season articles don't care what is done in every other soccer competition article in the encyclopedia, or that most clubs don't have season articles. They are even advocating the creation of stubs purely so that they can be linked to.\n\nTalk:2009 Women's Professional Soccer season has a discussion about the displaying of results and statistics. Despite the broad consensus to display American sports results in the Away-Home format (an example of that discussion can be found here), the page is currently using Home-Away format. Additionally, statistical leaders are sourced in a way that might violate WP:OR, despite a summary of those statistics being available as an alternative.\n\nI would like to remind editors that MLS and WPS are simultaneously North American sports articles (which comes with format and other expectations) and soccer articles (which also comes with format and other expectations). We are also having a problem with the concept of consensus, mainly in the context of having changes supported by consensus before they are made. Enjoy. -- Grant.Alpaugh\n\nAlso note the corollary Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Grant.Alpaugh after repeated edit-warring, ownership, harassment, personal attacks, etc. Grsz11\n\nA quick look at Fußball-Bundesliga 2008–09, La Liga 2008–09, Premier League 2008–09 and Serie A 2008–09, to name the biggest, shows, that displaying the qualification/relegation places before they are decided is the done thing, at least in Europe. As the the second question, I would link to the clubs article, if there is a season article, you will find it there at the top in the infobox. As to the Away-Home, I'm used to the European format, but then I'm also used to calling the game football, not soccer and you won't rename the article 2009 Major League Football season table for me, will you? EA210269 (talk)\n\nExpressing those opinions on each of those talk pages would be most appreciated, even if they are just in a sentence or two. -- Grant.Alpaugh\n\nThe Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Football/United_States_and_Canada_task_force has purposefully been skipped on these issues because Grant knows he has little to no support in these departments. Grant has gone as far as creating a new puppet account to try to increase his numbers and claims it is his brother- either way I move that these issues be removed and discussed by the appropriate group.Morry32 (talk)\n\nEl Salvador was forced to abandon a UNCAF Nations Cup 2009 semi-final match against Costa Rica in the 60' minute earlier this year. Does anyone know whether FIFA awards caps (and tracks goals scored) for abandoned matches (Costa Rica was awarded a 3–0 victory)? Best regards. Jogurney (talk)\n\nWell FIFA doesn't award caps, the individual countries do. England awarded caps for the match against Ireland that was abandoned a few years back. It's probably at the discretion of the country's FA....... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nScotland awarded caps for this abandoned match in 2004, and allowed James McFadden's goal to count towards his international total. I'd agree with Chris that it's up to the relevant FA. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nI dont know about Denmark, but Sweden awarded goals and apps for the abandoned Euro 2008 qualifier chandler ···\n\nThank you all for the replies. I'll check the Costa Rica FA and El Salvador FA sites for detail on whether they awarded caps for the match. Best regards. Jogurney (talk)\n\nThere are a couple of UEFA season articles (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway and Serbia, to be exact) which list every single season scorer. However, the Serbian article is the only one not giving a least one source for the entire list; it rather links to the single match reports. Is this allowed or does a similar case from last summer apply where the respective list was eventually classified as original research and removed? As far as I can see, there is no complete list available, just the usual top 10 or 15 (via Soccerway). There is currently also a discrepancy between league table (317 goals) and list (311 goals) which cannot be fixed without much effort.\n\nAside from the encyclopaedic value of any of those lists (which should not be discussed here) - what should be done with the Serbian list? --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nThis page is neither comprehensive nor even moderately maintained right now. I'm having difficulty deciding what it even wants to be (does anything which is never transcluded belong in templatespace?) - requesting some thoughts on what to do with it. I'm tempted to take it to TfD, but on the off chance that anyone actually finds value in it then speak now or forever hold your peace. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nIt looks very similar to Template:Football kit, are they related/the same? EA210269 (talk)\n\nIt's transcluded onto template:football kit/doc. But why is it not just merged there? Is there any need to show a selection of patterns on that doc page? Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nCould someone please convert this to make it look more like this, I tried it myself but could not figure it out. I take it that since the English one is not being destroyed like the Scottish one, it is perfectly acceptable to use columns. Darryl.matheson (talk)\n\nErr... Actually, I would prefer the current version over something similar to the English template. The latter looks a bit too crowded for me, especially when the fb series will eventually be converted to full screen width. But that's just my two cents... --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nYes, the current Scottish one looks much more friendly to me as well. - fchd (talk)\n\nTry running a text-to-speech program over the English one and see if you get an intelligible set of results from it. I doubt it. The reply I made to you on the original discussion explains why simply converting to use a {{navbox}} wrapper and keeping the weird internal layout is suboptimal; rather than shopping for people to back you up, I'd advise you to read back over that response and see if my arguments are better than your \"user-friendly\", \"better\" or \"not being destroyed\" rationales. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nRednessInside has suggested to me that results which are lost on penalties are actually recorded as draws within manager stats boxes. Is this true? And if so, why? Sillyfolkboy (talk) (edits)\n\nAll matches that end after 90 minutes are usually treated as draws in my experience. chandler ···\n\nAgreed. It's treated that the result of the match is that after 90 or 120 minutes (as applicable), and the kicks from the penalty mark are used just to determine who goes through to the next round. That's how it seems to be as how it's been treated for decades now. - fchd (talk)\n\nI think it's an odd approach, but what do I know compared to Mr. Decadesofusage? Fair enough, I think that's clarified it. Sillyfolkboy (talk) (edits)\n\nHello teammates, i have a doubt, could it be reasonable?...\n\nI made a couple of page moves the last weeks; two players, both nicknamed MICHEL (Miguel Ángel Sánchez and Miguel Ángel Carrilero), because that is how they are known in their respective \"field of work\" (this here being soccer). Since there is a more famous known MICHEL (born 1963), i proceeded to make the necessary adjustments in the title of the article. Unfortunately, User:Matthew hk did not find any of this to his satisfaction and undid my move, without a word in edit summary.\n\nI have already tipped him about this subject, but would also like to know the opinion of \"The Project\"; am i doing something wrong? Last time i knew, pages could be moved, as long as the title of the article and its defaultsort matched in some way.\n\nAttentively, VASCO AMARAL, Portugal - --NothingButAGoodNothing (talk)\n\nHi Vasco. Ideally all page moves should first be discussed - unless they are non-controversial. Personally, I think the articles should remain at their current locations (Miguel Ángel Sánchez and Miguel Ángel Carrilero) as opposed to being placed at Míchel (footballer born ????). GiantSnowman\n\nI'm sure a couple of \"other uses\" hatnotes would help in any case. Sillyfolkboy (talk) (edits)\n\nSome editors are insisting on linking to club season articles in the league tables, rather than to the club articles (e.g. in a Premier League table, Manchester United would be piped to Manchester United F.C. season 2008-09 rather than Manchester United F.C.). What are editors' thoughts on this? пﮟოьεԻ 57\n\nI believe you should link to the team, not the season. Most teams don't have season articles to link to anyways. GiantSnowman\n\nSeconded, the link should point at the club article. If a season article exists for the particular club, it is linked in the infobox anyways. --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nAt the very bottom. Grsz11\n\nWhat we're linking to should always be made clear in the body text. See WP:PIPE#Intuitiveness. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nThe body text in this case is the 2009 season table. I don't think it's a big stretch to expect the links to take you to more information about that team in 2009. In the MLS template discussion another reason brought up for linking to club season articles in the case of MLS was to follow the practice of other American sports such as baseball, American football, and hockey. Given that most visitors to MLS related articles will be American this would be consistent with other American sports club season articles they may visit. --SkotyWATalk|Contribs\n\nWhen the league template is specific to a season, why wouldn't you link to the season article for a team if it exists? Seems to be the most appropriate, especially considering next year there won't be a link to the season article from the main article at all. --Bobblehead (rants)\n\nThe link to the season should always still be available from the club template at the bottom. I guess, there is no reason for not linking to the clubs season article, provided that every club has a season article. Half-half should be avoided, I think. EA210269 (talk)\n\nThis may work for some of the bigger teams, who are likely to have season articles, but would they be kept up to date for all teams? And if you link to seasons for MLS teams, will the same be done for USL and PDL, for example? Linking to teams strikes me as the easiest way to maintain consistency throughout. It would be nice if links to teams' season articles could be made more prominent, but that's another discussion. Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nYou're definitely looking at a case by case basis. Most USL and PDL teams probably are not going to have season articles, so it would be silly to have the season specific templates for those leagues link to season articles for each team. However, I also don't see a problem with having a mixture of links to season specific articles and the team main page. Red links in templates are discouraged, so I would think some links to team season specific articles where those articles exist and others going to a team's main article where a season specific article doesn't exist is fine. You're still making the \"most appropriate\" link based on the context of the template. Although, with the MLS articles specifically, I am going through and slowly creating a season specific article for each team, so that shouldn't be an issue in a week or two for MLS articles. As far as keeping them updated. They'll be as accurate as any other article we have on Wikipedia. --Bobblehead (rants)\n\nMaybe some of you have noticed I have been creating Port Vale player articles for awhile now. Over 1,000 now and (other than a few I missed first time round) I have created an article for every player who has made a football league appearance. Now there are 425 players who failed to do that, about 200 of those there are initialled amateurs with no details, but perhaps 100 others have played league games for other clubs. There any many wartime guests, as well as 19th century players and players active 1907-1919 (the clubs non-league phase).\n\nIt would be unreasonable to ask you to check your databases/books for all 425 names, but I wrote 'big' clubs that they played for and maybe played league/FA Cup matches for. So for those of you with a one-club interest you can CTRL+F (note I may have shorted the names of a few, e.g. Accy Stan or West Brom or QPR).\n\nSo here it is, enjoy! Thanks everyone! Oh, if you find a player who has met the notability criteria then give me a bell!--EchetusXe (talk)\n\nYour level of devotion to the Vale is hilarious. Well done. Such obscure names \"E.C.Brundrett\"? \"Dr C.T.Forsyth\" is my personal favourite. Good luck! Sillyfolkboy (talk) (edits)\n\num, thnx lol. heh, Forsyth must have been a medical doctor or a Phd graduate, I thought I'd put the Dr in on the obscure chance he made himself notable through another field. Would be a far off chance but worth the effort of putting in the two letters! But yeah, I started the job so I thought I might as well take it through to the bitter end.--EchetusXe (talk)\n\nThink you could move the list to the \"user\" tab of that page? The \"talk\" page could then be used for any questions we might have. Excellent work so far, by the way. - Dudesleeper / Talk\n\nSure! thnx.--EchetusXe (talk)\n\nSurely if a) they're so obscure you're having trouble finding their first names, and b) are \"amateurs\", they fail both WP:N and WP:ATHLETE? - fchd (talk)\n\nHe doesn't actually state that he's planning on creating articles on any of them unless other people can confirm that they played league/FA Cup matches for other clubs and therefore meet the guideline...... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nBTW congrats to Echetus on this very impressive feat - I've still got nearly 300 Gillingham players to go...... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nCheers!--EchetusXe (talk)\n\nGreat job, mate! E. Chadwick could be Edgar Chadwick. Also, does your Eric Jones is Eric Norbert Jones? If so, he coached in Switzerland and Belgium: perfectly notable.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nhmm, no E.Chadwick was at Vale whilst Edgar was playing for Everton. And not quite, Eric Norman Jones, though he did coach in the Netherlands so even if they are different people he should still be notable. thnx!--EchetusXe (talk)\n\nFrank Soo has nine appearances for England listed in his infobox, but every one was in a wartime international match, which the FA don't regard as official - should they be in there? Within the text it's clearly stated that all the matches were \"semi-official\", so my query's really only about the listing in the infobox...... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nI'd say there's no reason they shouldn't be there, but it needs (wartime) or suchlike after England to clarify. Something like User:Djln did with Billy Hughes (footballer born 1918). cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nGood article that Hughes one. Can't see any reason not to include it as long as the team's status is made clear. Wartime England national football team might make a decent article, or at least a section on the main England page if the sources are out there.Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nThe teams and results for all England wartime internationals are listed at the RSSSF site. Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nHow about a wider Football during World War II? From the the aforementioned Home Internationals held for morale-boosting to the Austrian league becoming the Gauliga Ostmark, there should be plenty of material around. Oldelpaso (talk)\n\nThe article exists at Association football during World War II. There is also Association football during World War I.

Occuli (talk)\n\nI got a question about the naming conventions of articles that cover stage of a continental club tournament:\n\nAre there any?\n\nIs it dependent on the rules and regulations of the tournament, or do we use a generic term? Example: the regulations of the CONCACAF Champions League call the knock-out phase the \"Championship Round\". So I suppose that's why the article on it was called CONCACAF Champions League 2008–09 Championship Round. The same goes for the Group Stage (note the capitalization, which is the same capitalization as in the regulations). UEFA rules don't have group stage capitalized in the same way, so it makes sense that this is as it is.\n\nI ask this for the Copa Libertadores tournament. According to their rules, the names of the stages in Spanish, is Primera Fase, Segunda Fase, Octavos de Final, Cuartos de Final, Semifinales, y Finales (English: First Phase, Second Phase, Round of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals). The First Phase corresponds to this, and the Second Phase corresponds to this. Would those articles have to be renamed to match what CONMEBOL's rules call them? (Although in the English version of the website, they use \"First Stage\" as opposed to \"First Phase\", even though \"fase\" translates primarily to \"phase\" in English). Digirami (talk)\n\nAnd I suppose capitalization would be whatever CONMEBOL uses (if they use First Stage, use that. But if it's first stage, then use that). Digirami (talk)\n\nIf that is what they are officially called, then that's what their names should be. Wikipedia is here to record information, not to create it.--[|!*//MarshalN20\\\\*!|] (talk)\n\nCould I politely remind all WikiProject Football members that WP:FOOTYN is merely an essay, and is NOT official policy or guideline to be cited in deletion discussions. It is not accepted by the wider Wikipedia community; WP:ATHLETE, however, is. Regards, GiantSnowman\n\nWP:ATHLETE was just dreamt up by one user, never subject to debate or consensus building and is only accepted through precedent, at least WP:FOOTYN was discussed, debated and agreed before it was formalised by WP:FOOTY. Regarding WP:ATHLETE perhaps we should ask User talk:CalJW whether we can supercede his criteia? Since he unilaterally changed it to the way it is now, it seems some other users see him as the oracle of sports notability its a shame he retired over 2 years ago. FOOTYN has been accepted through rigerous debate and consensus building here at WP:FOOTY and there have been repeated calls to formalise WP:FOOTYN or include it in a revived WP:SPORTS [1] [2], the only real opposition to it I have ever seen is from people who claim that WP:N supercedes everything, which in itself is not an argument against WP:FOOTYN supercedeing WP:ATHLETE at all, its an argument against both of them. King of the North East\n\nAlso, I suggest you read the essay tag at the top of the page which reads \"it may be consulted for assistance during an AfD discussion or when considering creating a standalone article. The degree of consensus that went into creating this essay (a potential measurement of the reliability of the advice) can be judged by consulting the history and talk pages\" I can't see where it tells us that it \"is NOT official policy or guideline to be cited in deletion discussions\" as you claim. King of the North East\n\nAnother thing - this is the discussion that led to the creation of WP:ATHLETE. No support for its adoption at all, just a lack of opposition, (perhaps very few people were watching that particular page back in Sept 2005?). The opposers came along pretty soon after it was added, and the Wikipedia talk:Notability (people) page has seen a chorus of complaints about WP:ATHLETE ever since. King of the North East\n\nThat's all very well and good - and I for one would love to see FOOTYN become accepted - but whenever FOOTYN is cited, editors immediately say \"oh, that's just what WP:FOOTY thinks.\" However, WP:ATHLETE at least has a wider acceptability about it. GiantSnowman\n\nSorry to bother you once again, but can someone please have a look at Liga I 2008–09? Since the [article overhaul] four days ago, an IP editor with changing addresses (89.33.128.101 and 86.121.116.xxx, both registered to Romanian providers) has become involved in an edit war with User:Riveststein over the look of the goalscorer table. The IP insists on a table while Riveststein prefers a list. Any tries to moderate, including contacting the IP via hidden comment and inviting him to the article talk page, were fruitless as the guy is resistant to any discussion. Since then, warnings have been issued to stop, but he still keeps on reverting.\n\nI would have tried to mediate myself, but I might have gotten too involved in the whole story as well, so I don't know if I'm neutral enough to be a credible mediator. Any help would be appreciated! --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\ne.g. Bradford City A.F.C.. Right at the bottom, in the 'Football in England' box.

The problem is that his list of teams is dubious; the Soccerbase info is incomplete (and contains factoids like playing for a team 0 times and scoring 5 goals) and it's incongruous with the list of teams given in the article body (which, while not sourced, was presumably written by a fan with an idea of where he's been).

Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nTry NonLeague Daily. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nIs it me or are the Copa Mustang articles (the top Colombian league) a mess, especially when compared to other leagues? Take the 2008 season as an example.\n\nFirst off, there are two articles per season, one per tournament (2008 I & 2008 II). I for one would prefer one article per season, especially since there is information that pertain to the entire season as a whole. Open a discussion for merging them?\n\nThe scores in each tournament are done by fixture, not through a results table as the majority of leagues use. Should the scores be changed to a results table?\n\nI would have discussed the article titles, which were not inline with the standard, but I fixed that.\n\nStanding should be done through templates, right?\n\nShould the article on the Finals be deleted? How notable is it, really.\n\nA big fix in order for this league, right?\n\nDigirami (talk)\n\nHow is this player notable? I've noticed it has been deleted and re-created several times. Hubschrauber729 (talk)\n\nHe passes WP:N, see the section on this page #Lauri Dalla Valle chandler ···\n\nThe deletion review is here. If you have a look at it, the first reviewer suggests recreation be allowed, with no objection to its being sent back to AfD, and another, while supporting recreation, wasn't totally impressed by the WP:N argument: \"I would agree that WP:N superceded WP:ATHLETE if the context of coverage was non football related (for example, a footballer who didn't meet WP:ATHLETE but was covered due to something unrelated, like a mid range clothing brand and a scandal). In this case however, the press coverage is about the football and events directly related to the football (like moving away from his mother or being bought out by Liverpool), which is exactly what WP:ATHLETE regulates. Being good at PR and thus getting more coverage in news than other players in the same situation doesn't necessarily make one notable. All things considered however, Allow Recreation, give interested editors a few days to add sources and create a meaningful article, and then, if anyone still wants to, defer to AfD.\" cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nWell I see it as, WP:ATHLETE is to HELP (for example) footballers to gain notability when they're not meeting general notability. That is, to lower the standard for notability. This young player doesn't need WP:ATHLETE just like Pele doesn't need WP:ATHLETE for his notability chandler ···\n\nFirst of all, let me note the related DRV is missing comments from users participating actively in this WikiProject. Personally I think we all (including and startig from me, of course) should look a bit more to AfD and DRV cases. Then, I agree about the point that WP:N itself (which is a guideline that gives presumption of notability, please note this) makes no sense when news do not point to something significant the subject has made. All of the provided source point to him as a perspective player, also evidencing the youngster's unusual origins (Italian father, Finnish mother, but signed with an English club) - which, I might say, probably raised some interest from a number of football journalists. This is wrong presumption of notability, because all sources do not mention any significant achievement that makes the subject actually notable. And your comparison with Pele just makes no sense: Pele won a couple of World Cups, Dalla Valle still has to play a competitive senior game. --Angelo (talk)\n\nThe comparison is made because neither need WP:ATHLETE (imo) to be notable, you can change Pele for any known footballer. chandler ···\n\nThe deletion review only decided that there was enough assertion of notability to allow recreation; it didn't decide that the coverage was enough under general notability criteria for it to stay undeleted. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nHowever, your claim clashes with the content present in the article's talk page... So, who's right? --Angelo (talk)\n\nOn !votes, the talk page. On arguments, me. In my opinion, obviously :-) Incidentally, I have no view on the notability or otherwise of Mr Dalla Valle, as I haven't checked out the sources: I just find it interesting how the outcome of the DRV can be interpreted so differently by different people. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nDoes anyone have any stats on Pinamonte's career in Italy (and possibly elsewhere) before and after his stint in the English Football League? Cheers guys, --Jimbo[online]\n\nI have expanded the article a little bit, he currently plays in Serie D with Brindisi (Serie D is Italian's top amateur level). --Angelo (talk)\n\nHi soccer lovers, I allready have \"on papper\" a list of foreign players that have played in First Leagues in serbian clubs. The list is still incomplete and I need someone to tell me where can I find the complete squad lists of: Serbian Superliga, First League of Serbia-Montenegro, First League of FR Yugoslavia, First League of SFR Yugoslavia and if possible the First League of Kingdom of Yugoslavia. A long time ago I had a Belgrade based magazine called \"Tempo\" that contained a full list of the squads participating in the 1987/88 Yugoslav First League, but I think the magazine ended some years ago. I also have incomplete lists of foreigners that have played in all the other countries that were members of the old Yugoslavia. I will like to do someday the lists starting with the serbian one. The way that I would like to do the lists is based on today countries, their National First Leagues plus the team squads that participated in the First League of Yugoslavia. I will apply all the rules that are used in Foreign Players lists that already exist. I´m still gathering information about players and I will like if somebody can give me sources and I will also like to hear opinions from the rest of wikisoccerpedians. Thanks. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nThis can help you [3]. It is in Serbian, but statistics are easy to read^^. If you nead more details, I have some panini-like albums from Yugoslav 1st league.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nThank you very much. From what years the albums are? FkpCascais (talk)\n\nI have the full 1975-76, 1976-77, 1983-84, 1989-90 and 1990-91 seasons, and partially 1970-71, 1971-72, 1973-74, 1981-82.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nWow, you have some serious colectionaire stuff. What I need (foreign players,not inside Yugoslavia,real foreigners)may say or not in your albums. Ex-Yugoslav clubs really started importing players in the 90´s, but I wanted to be sure about the years before becouse there were some foreigners but its hard to me to find sources. These are the only ones that I have and even some of them mast be cheked:Miodrag Belodedici,d64,ROMint,C.Zvezda89/92;and now starts the doubts: Francisco Garraffa ,m10,ARG,SK Jugoslavija Belgrade41/42; Milan Ivanovic,d60,AUSint(Australia/International),C.Zvezda78/89,OFK Belgrade82/85,Radnicki Nis87/88; Dragan\"Doug\"Utjesenovic,d46,AUSint,OFK Belgrade67/69; Branko Buljevic,s47,AUSint,OFK Belgrade in 68?; Goran Kartalija,d66,AUTint,Vojvodina88/91; Miroslav Polak,Pos:?,birth:58,nat:AUT,Partizan,seasons:?.; Dimitri Davidovic,m44,BEL,Partizan62/67; Panaiot Panajotov,s30,BULint,C.Zvezda62; Olegs Karavajevs,gk61,LETint,OFK Bekgrade90/93; Kestutis Ruzgys,s62,LITint,OFK Belgrade91/92; Sorin Vlaicu,m65,ROM,C.Zvezda92; Kazimir Gajdos,s34,CZEint,C.Zvezda58; Vojislav\"Scoop\"Stanisic,gk63,USAint,Partizan,?; Predrag\"Preki\"Radosavljevic,m,63,USAint,C.Zvezda83/85. Some of them have wiki pages(Ivanovic,Utjesenovic,Buljevic,Kartalija,Davidovic,Karavajevs,Gajdos and Stanisic) but for Gajdos page dosn´t mention Red Star. It is in Weltfussbal site that says they(Garraffa,Panajotov and Gajdos) played. What happends is that a long time ago my grand-father told me about some hungarian,czech,bulgarian and other players that used to play in old Yugoslavia, maybe around the time of WWII, I think, and I´m interested in finding those gays. It´s also posible/probable that they played in slovenian or croatian clubs, but that will also be interesting for me. As you are french, I supose you know that for now no serious french player played in ex-Yuga. Only Fondja played in Slovenia. But, for serbian case I have 4 players FRA/SRB wich I really wasn´t thinking of including in the list but your opinion intereses me. The cases are: Ognjen Lekic,m,82,Zeleznik04/05,Zemun?01?/04?,also played in Slovenia; Marko Muslin(son of coach Muslin),m,85,C.Zvezda03/04; Ivan Bek/Yvan Beck,s,09,YUGint+FRAint,BSK Belgrade25/27,Macva Sabac27/28; Ivica/Yves Todorov,m,50, C.Zvezda72,Proleter67/69. Non of this players is real french but a lot of sites put them as french. P.S.:I really hope we both pass in the WC group. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nThis is a hard work. Real foreigners in Yugoslav league I can confirm: Miodrag Belodedici, Jia Xiuquan (Partizan 1986-88), Eddie Krncevic, Hernan Medford, Alexey Prudnikov (USSR/Russia). Kazimír Gajdoš seems correct but I am not 100% sure. About French/Yugoslav: I don't know any French players in Yugoslavia, I know LOTS OF Yugoslav in France. I think only Marko Muslin can be considered French as he was born there, I don't know the story of O. Lekic. Bek and Todorov obtained French citizenship when they moved to France, so they were not really foreigners when they played in Yugoslavia, such as Dimitri Davidovic. You also forgot Dusan Maravic who was born in France. I'll do further researchs. PS:We'll both pass!--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nThank you again. In the lists I want to make I find a lot of cases of \"half\" foreigners, and I know that some serbian editors don´t agree with putting them with foreign flags, and I agree too. Just wanted to chek the opinion of \"wiki seniors\"like you. I only toth of including this two cases: Yugoslav, not international, players who are International for other countries and players that clearly indicated that want to be considered as...australian,canadian,etc. I am not going to put any of this players in France list, even Muslim, becouse he can still be option for some NT. I also understand that players like Muslim, while playing in Bulgaria,as he did, may use their french passport so they wan´t count as extracomunitarian. I also travel as portuguese... Thanks for Prudnikov, I didn´t knew about him. Willy Fondja played as french in NK maribor in 2007/08. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nFondja has full French citizenship (born & bread in France). Indeed, there are lots of half-foreigners/dual nationality in this list. Lots of Yugoslav changed their nationality abroad (Ilija Mitic also). Your criterias looks wise. Think about writing them up the list. Have also a look at the list I built List of foreign Ligue 1 players, where my main criterium is \"a player who came in France as a foreigner\".--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nI know. Your list is great and I can´t even imagine the houch amount of effort you must have made to do it. I cheked all the existing lists many times, and I even raised the question of Dujkovic so there wan´t exist discrepancies between lists. Latouffedisco, can we continue to exchange ideas in your or my talk page so we could extend the issues and not enlarge exesivly this page? FkpCascais (talk)\n\nSure, he's saying you're right, so you can't imagine the amount of his efforts. But you can imagine mine...! However, for Yugoslav league I can contribute with a couple of Italians that came up in my mind: Gino Gardassanich, brothers Renzo (Italian B national team) and Otmar Gazzari, Ettore Valcareggi (brother of Ferruccio). --necronudist (talk)\n\nOh, and let me know if you're going to start a List of foreign Yugoslav League players or something like... I'll be happy to contribute, following your criteria. --necronudist (talk)\n\nMolte grazie. User talk: FkpCascais\n\nI have a dispute with Necronudist about the nationality of some players in the La Liga foreign players list. The player in question is the today renamed coach Ratomir Dujkovic. He is a Croatia born Serbian coach and former player. The thing is that necronudist made a role that he puts the players in the list of their country of birth and he is reverting the corrections. I would like to have some roles about the nationalities of ex-Yugoslavia players since they appear in all the lists. What I propose is: For International players:\n\nIf they played for any of this selections(Slovenia,Croatia,Bosnia&Herzegovina,Macedonia,Montenegro and Serbia) they should be in that country list, wherever their birth place is.\n\nIf they played for FR Yugoslavia, since it was made in 1992, was composed only of Serbia and Montenegro, and the other selections were already active, those players can only be Serbian or Montenegrin, the list editor will have to see the NATIONALITY of the player, to see wich of this two is.The same applies for Serbia-Montenegro National Team players.\n\nIf players played for SFR Yugoslavia(the old big Yugoslavia dismembered in 1992,1945-1992) or Kingdom of Yugoslavia(1918-1941), thay should be in the list of their nationality, not their birth place.\n\nIf they are not International,only the nationality should apply, since if they would, they would play for their nationality national team prefering it to the birth place national team.\n\nIf they played for the Croatia National team in the period of (1941-1944)they should be in Croatia list,even if they played for Yugoslavia before or after.\n\nThere is a lot of pages of ex-Yugoslav footballers already existing in Wikipedia, and they all start with the sentence telling the nationality of the player. Since there is a lot of mixture of nationalities ( a big number of members of Croatia National team are born in Bosnia and Germany, Serbia nt are born in Bosnia and Croatia, Montenegro nt in Serbia, etc.),and the subject may be touchy, I find this the most exact way. Since people in this cases may have even stronger national feelings towards their nationalities(cases like Sinisa Mihajlovic, big serbian nationalist in the past, born in today Croatia) it would be very wrong to put them in birth place list.\n\nI remember 3 exemples of dispute from the La Liga foreign players talk page (Dragi Kanatlarovski,Hristo Vidakovic and Ratomir Dujkovic),and I don´t understand wy are they controversial. Kanatlarovski was born in Belgrade in Serbia and he played for the SFR Yugoslavia National team and after the creation of Macedonia National team, since he ia ethnic macedonian, he played some games for Macedonia. By my standards he should be in Macedonia list, regardless being born in Serbia. Hristo Vidakovic is a serbian (ethnic)player born in Bosnia. He played for Yugoslavia, and when the Bosnian National team already existed, he choused to play for FR Yugoslavia (composed of Serbia and Montenegro) National team. He choused Serbia-Montenegro over Bosnia and since he is a serbian from Bosnia he should be in Serbian list.Not Bosnia,and not Montenegro. Ratomir Dujkovic is a serbian from Croatia, played for Yugoslavia before the creation of the new national teams so, I understand that there may be some confusion for laics in the matter, but even croats recognise that he is serbian, the first sentence in his wiki page starts with \"...serbian manager and former player...\"so, wy is Necronudist complicating it? I´ve just corrected the nationalities of Dujkovic,putting him in Serbia list,instead of Croatia, and put Barbaric, who is a croat born in Croatia, in Croatia list(so even by his standards-birth place-Necronudist was wrong),since he was in Serbia list. The rest is OK. Necronudist insists in reverting this change insisting that he must stick with the birth place theory. What about french footballers? Are they in Senegal,Martinique,Guinea list becouse they were born there? If there is no dispute about Dujkovic being serb, wy can´t we put him in the list that he (Dujkovic) feels like belonging? We are not in XV century, and people travel and live and work, and have kids abroad for some time. Should Kuranyi be in Brazil list? Someone can´t be this inflexible,specially if a laic in a matter. Lets please make roles about it. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nI've already discussed this with Necronudist. He uses the birth place criteria because it is easier to back it up with a valid reference rather than an \"ethnic\" criteria. (which means nothing to me as I am French). Cheers.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nOh my God... they're only criteria...! There aren't only ex-Yugoslavian, but also ex-Czechoslovakian, ex-Soviet... it would be an endless work! Please stop it! --necronudist (talk)\n\nWe can not go by ethnicity, it would be impossible to source and especially for non-Yugoslav editors they won't have a clue why someone supposedly is Serbian or Croatian. Secondly, as in the player in question only competed under Yugoslavia he should be listed as a Yugoslavian player not as a Croatian player. chandler ···\n\nOK Necronudist,but can you explain wy is Barbaric in Serbia list, since he is ethnic croatian, born in Croatia (Metkovic is a town in Croatia), and never played in Serbian clubs? You did very well the list. Wikipedians allready congratulated you, but you are not owner of the list and you may be wrong, and since I´m very familiarised with this issue wy don´t you accept the advice of just this two cases? I´m not asking to change the entire list, just two small corrections that I´m SURE are wright. OK, I´m gonna be honest. People may use wikipedia like a source of information (jurnalists, etc.) and since Dujkovic is corrently a coach it may matter if we put him in a wright or wrong list. I don´t know about Czekoslovakia or the URSS, but I can see that there are a lot of wikipedians from ex-Yugoslavia and if some of them offers help to correct the list, wy not accept it? And if the criteria is birth place, half a list is wrong. Please, its only two cases in a huge list, not a change in hole Wikipedia. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nOk, three things: first, I use a \"combined birthplace+national team\" criteria, to be as more flexible as possible. That's why Kuranyi would never be Brazilian, in MY lists, but German. Second: yes, for Barbarić you're right... mistakes happen. If you're going to alert me of other mistakes following the criteria of the list you're welcome, as everybody else has always been. Third, I consider that list MINE 'cause I have spit sweat over that list, and over the Premier League one, and over the Serie A one. I know Wikipedia is stupid for these kind of things (it's the Encyclopedia everyone can vandalize, isn't it?), and that's why I'm not gonna manage/update MY lists anymore from the next season on. And then everyone will be able to disrupt every criteria he wants. --necronudist (talk)\n\nI hope you understand that vandalizing was never my objective,right the oposite,I would really like the wikipedia to be the perfect as posible. I also, even if I didn´t express towards you that way,understand that the list is yours since you did all the hard work. It has been pased allready months since I started preparing my lists (foreigns in all ex-Yugoslavia countries). Speaking of them,the Dujkovic case may also create a problem to my lists. If he appears as \"from Croatia\" in some list, I´ll have to consider him a croat in Serbia. If I exclude him from my list in Serbia, it will appear as he never played in Serbia. I still don´t know if I´ll use the internal ex-yu states, but that puts me a question. I will insist in Ratomir Dujkovic case. He has no links to the country called Croatia in wich you´ve put him. He´s born in Yugoslavia and is a holder of Serbian passport. Even croats consider him serbian, you can chek this by looking to the list of notable players of NK Osijek.He clearly appears with the serbian flag.If you don´t change it I´ll really have to ask for arbitration. There is only you that defend your theory, there is one neutral point of view(the one that will put a Yugoslavia section in the list,wich will make a big work to do all the changes) and me. If I didn´t find it important I wouldn´t insist. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nDo what you want. If the criteria will change, I'll stop managing all my lists immediately. --necronudist (talk)\n\nWow, that's just lists: adding a footnote would be simple. \"Dujkovic was born in what is today Croatia but is an ethnic Serb\". And that's over.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nBut footnotes will complicate even further... There was a same case with italians from Dalmatia. Parts of what is today the coast of Croatia and Slovenia were part of Italy untill 1945,more precisely the Istria peninsula and the cities of Rijeka (called Fiume in italian), Zadar (Zara) and for a short period Trst(Trieste). All of this territories, exept of Trieste wich returned to Italy, were incorporated to the SFR Yugoslavia and a great number of the italian population that lived there emigrated to Italy. So the players that were born in those territories were allways and everywhere considered as italian, not yugoslav or croat. It´s also truth that some italians remained and may even be considered \"croatian\"(Marenzi for exemple) but those cases were rare and the vast majority went to Italy and continued their lives as italians. For the majority of serbs from Croatia (Dujkovic´s case)the situation is preatty much the same. They were born in a region of the country that was united with the motherland(Italy for italians and Serbia for serbs)and when those territories went to be part of another country the majority emigrated and continued to consider themselfs as italian or serbian. I´m just in favor of respecting the will of these people. I have nothing against Croatia,they have this cases too,croats from Bosnia and Srijem(today Srem). It may sound complicated but I offer help to anyone with doubts about some players and if not sure I can do some reserch, but is not fare to put the right way only the players that have played for National Teams and the others forcefully in the country their birthplace today belongs. So if borders change again we have to change the entire lists again? My way is much more correct and independent of politics. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nCan anyone verify Giorgos Kanthias? No g-hits except for Wikipedia. ~EdGl ★\n\nLooks very hoax like. Inconsistencies throughout the article (birth place), unlikely accomplishments (630 games, 986 goals), sections not related to the player copied from elsewhere (euro 1980/1996, world cup qualifying 1994/1998 etc). No results on FIFA.com that should be present if he played in a major tournament for Greece. Camw (talk)\n\nI love this hoax- if anyone can read Greek it might be good to search the http://el.wikipedia.org/ in Greek? Morry32 (talk)\n\nOkay, I proposed it for deletion. ~EdGl ★\n\nMy knowledge of Greek is limited to transliteration of Biblical texts, but I can conclude from that that the only Giorgos Kan... listed at el.Wikipedia is Giorgos Kansos, an Olympiakos player of the same era but but different dates, subsequently played for a minor team in Nicosia. If Kansos, not an international player, has an article on el.wiki, it seems at best odd that this alleged contemporary, with such a prolific goalscoring record and held in such regard, is not recorded there. No mention of him in the various player lists at the Olympiacos article in el.wiki. Vast majority of the article doesn't even refer to this alleged player or his alleged career. Although the greek version of Karagounis' name is given, no part of the article refers to the obviously real presently active player. Kevin McE (talk)\n\nThere is an article on the Greek Wikipedia [4] about a \"Γιώργος Καραγκούνης\" although the details don't correlate at all. Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nI realise now this relates to Giorgos Karagounis (I was going by the Greek name in the \"Fact File\" section of the Giorgos Kanthias article. It's all Greek to me.) --Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nThis category is looking remarkably sparse.

GiantSnowman\n\nThe same problems will exist and they'll be public - one of the reasons our list of fully professional leagues is incomplete is because it's so difficult to find cited sources that explicitly state a league's professional status. I spent quite a few hours searching the web trying to make the list we've got as complete as possible, and there are still tons of gaps on it in which I simply cannot find the information out. Putting it in infoboxes still requires tracking down the information, and then we'll just have the problems of adding the material publicly instead of trying to work it out on our project page. matt91486 (talk)\n\nIn addition, the league itself often won't be pro/semi-pro/amateur - at least in England there are no official distinction between those categories anyway and everyone is just players. It's the clubs themselves who conform to those statuses (and sometimes, it's not even uniform amongst a club), not the leagues. - fchd (talk)\n\nJust want to make sure I've not gone mad before prod-ing. This is someone's hoax made-up team right? Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nCould probably speedy it as a blatant hoax. – PeeJay\n\nYeah tried that but was denied with no reason given; that's why I thought I must be missing something Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nJust bringing attention to David Beckham 334 (talk · contribs), who seems to ply his trade in adding false information to articles. Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nSince you gave him about 6 \"last warnings\" I think you should have an administrator block him for a few days. ~EdGl ★\n\nBlocked. Such cases can be reported at WP:AIV. Rettetast (talk)\n\nHaving looked at the project's notability page and its talk page I was struck by two things.\n\nFirstly, there was a lot of discussion about player notability but the final outcome seems to have fizzled out somewhat. Not only is this a non-binding guideline, but it has also been left unfinished as the list of fully professional leagues is incomplete according to the article's lead.\n\nSecondly, there seems to have been little discussion for some time about the notability of anything else; for example: clubs, leagues, competitions, managers, selection teams, national teams, pseudo-national teams etc. Most important of these would seem to me to be clubs and leagues. For example, What makes a league at level 21 of the English football pyramid notable? If the league is notable, are the clubs in that league notable? I have my own thoughts on these issues but seeing as most people don't want to read massively long comments I'll leave them for another time. I've put down some sections for comment below (currently hidden) and look forward to hearing some opinions.\n\nI know the notability section's talk page might seem the more sensible destination, but seeing as BigDuncTalk asked a similar question there on April 8 and got no reply I thought I'd ask on a page that gets more traffic, and put a redirect there. Thanks Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nAt least one very minor league has gone to AfD in the past but was kept based on lots of comments which essentially said \"this is part of the English football league system and therefore notable\". Despite this, there seems to be very little to prove that any leagues below about level 12 can actually legitimately claim to be part of the pyramid - the only source for the levels assigned to leagues below the National League System on WP appears to be thepyramid.info, which essentially comprises one fan's OR. -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nRight, with regards to clubs I've looked through the AfD archive back to January '07. This discussion suggests that the notability criteria for English clubs rest on eligibility for national cup competition. This seems to be an idea that was followed for a while (as mentioned here) but has been ignored on other occasions, with the general requirements of WP:N reasserted (e.g. here). A comment in this AfD implies that eligibility for cup competition is the criteria for notability in other countries too. However, this AfD says level 3 of Australian football isn't notable, with no reference to other criteria. Here we find the assertion that 'A football club that plays in the third highest division in Switzerland is definitely notable', but no more criteria (although if the Cup eligibility criteria were applied, they would be notable). This AfD says that Serie D is a high enough level for Italy, but doesn't mention that teams at that level can't compete in the Coppa Italia. This AfD allows a team to remain because the league they compete in is professional- no mention of any other criteria (although if national cup criteria were applied they would have been eligible) . This team remained because it sounded like their league might be something like the Conference, no other criteria mentioned (although eligibility for the Emperor's Cup is open only to the top half of the league, I imagine the whole league's teams would be allowed to remain with the national cup criteria). This AfD again suggests the national cup eligibility as a reason for notability.\n\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, these teams were kept as they were members of the SJFA, but not eligible for the Scottish Cup. Scottish 'junior' football is fine but apparently this winner of the Scottish Amateur Cup was not notable.\n\nIn all these examples it seems that notions of what is and isn't notable are often tied up with what level of football the team play at rather than necessarily whether any sources can be found.\n\nAs far as leagues go there is very little discussion on anything that isn't a Sunday league or kids' league (both of which tend to be deleted)- at least not since January 07, which is as far as I looked. The only pertinent AfD I could find for leagues in English football was this, which seems to be a fairly meaningless WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS argument but decided that all levels of the pyramid, down to 24 were notable without any obligation to show notability. I imagine this is what ChrisTheDude was talking about. Which brings me too...\n\nProposal\n\nHow about adding these 2 to WP:FOOTYN and attempting to get wider acceptance across Wikipedia?\n\nAll teams that are eligible for the national cup (or the highest league in countries where no cup exists) are assumed to meet WP:N criteria. Teams that are not eligible for national cups must be shown to meet broader WP:N criteria.\n\nAll leagues whose members are eligible for national cups are assumed notable. All leagues that are a country's highest level are assumed notable. All other leagues must be shown to meet broader WP:N criteria. Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nThis may work for some countries but in Germany, for example, every first (non-reserve) team playing in senior league football can qualify for the national cup by going through the qualifying process. Therefore every league and every club would be notable by this rule. And I don't think my home-town tier-twelve club is notable by any means. I think, the rules should be strikter then that. EA210269 (talk)\n\nI wouldn't necessarily be opposed to Germany being allowed 2 tiers more of clubs than England- it is a larger nation so that would make sense. However, my interpretation would be that unless the team actually won the regional cup they were not eligible for the DFB-Pokal that season. Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nYou are pretty much right, a club has to win a regional cup (or finish runners-up in Bavaria or Lower Saxony), but theoretically any club could do so. In any case, I personally don't consider a German club notable unless it has played in tier five or above or has taken part in the DFB cup. Just a personal view and really only applies to Germany because the league pyramid broadens much quicker then in England where tier five is still nationwide, compare to twelve leagues at this level in Germany. In any case, any form of notability criteria will be an improvement as we don't really have one right now and yours is a good start. EA210269 (talk)\n\nOf course there will always be exceptions to the rules but I think a slightly flawed notability guideline is better than none. Currently there are approx 75,000 articles with this project's tag and if nothing else it would be useful to have at least a vague idea of how much further this project would expand before covering every relevant team, league, player, nation, association etc. etc. etc. It allows not only for deletion of material that doesn't make the grade, but also encourages creation by making the gaps easier to detect. Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nI like the proposal. It makes a lot of sense and will keep the notability guidelines within FOOTY more focused and less subjective than what they have been. JohnnyPolo24 (talk)\n\n(reindent) The Footyn giudeline was meant to be expanded to cover leagues, clubs, stadia, games, referees etc, but after the player guideline we worked so hard to acheive was immediately attacked by people fromWP:BIO most of us lost our motivation to continue. As for the proposal, it looks pretty good to me, although perhaps the wording could be changed to \"All teams that have played in the national cup\"? King of the North East\n\nThat sounds like a sensible suggestion, consider it changed. Is there any reason for me not to be WP:BOLD and put this up on WP:FOOTYN? If (as I expect) I need to demonstrate more of a consensus, what's the best way to go about it? Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nGo ahead. It should get people more interessted into something that, I think, is quite important for this project.EA210269 (talk)\n\nRight, I've moved them onto the FOOTYN page (with my amendment) and copied this discussion to the FOOTYN talkpage. We still need some kind of consensus on: managers, stadia, referees, cups, chairmen/owners, specific games etc. Anyone wanting to pick one and start a discussion feel free......King of the North East\n\nOops, completely forgot abouth this! Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nWhy don't you just use and abuse Foxhill's old suggestion from the FOOTYN talkpage, it seems quite comprehensive. Nanonic (talk)\n\nFurther Proposals\n\nOk, here are some more suggestions:\n\nReferees\n\nReferees are considered notable if they have refereed a match in a World Cup Finals tournament or a Confederation finals tournament (e.g. European Championships, CONCACAF Gold Cup).\n\nReferees who have refereed the final of the main domestic cup are also considered notable.\n\nOther referees are presumed unnotable. However, they may be notable if they meet the broader WP:N criteria.\n\nI would prefer it if all referees that had officiated in a fully professional top-flight league were considered notable, or we would end up with half of the articles on English referees being deleted as soon as these guidelines came in. – PeeJay\n\nI imagine they would have enough outside info to meet WP:N. This avoids having someone refer to the guideline in support of including, say, a ref who featured in one First Division match in 1920 Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nManagers/Head Coaches\n\nManagers are considered notable if they have managed a fully professional team or a national team.\n\nIf already qualified under 'player' criteria, an individual's managerial career is also notable.\n\nAll other managers are presumed unnotable. However, they may be notable if they meet the broader WP:N criteria.\n\nIndividual Games\n\nThe final game of a cup or tournament is notable, however notability must still be shown as per the general notability criteria.\n\nAll other games are presumed unnotable. However, they may be notable if they meet the broader WP:N criteria.\n\nNational Teams\n\nAll FIFA-recognised national teams are notable.\n\nNational teams from non-FIFA nations need to demonstrate notability\n\nRepresentative Teams\n\nTeams competing at the following tournaments may be considered notable. List of tournaments (to be created if/when consensus is reached)\n\nOther representative teams are presumed unnotable. However, they may be notable if they meet the broader WP:N criteria.\n\nInput for the above\n\nFor matches:\n\nI think you should specify what kind of tournament the final is for (ex: international club tournament, etc.). If you mentioned just \"final of a tournament\", it'll sound as if this, the final match-up of one of the league season's tournaments, as notable... which it isn't. Digirami (talk)\n\nhow about 'cup finals'? Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nWell you specified that already, so that's understood. But when you say tournaments, you gotta specify which kinds. I think international club tournaments finals are more than OK, but finals for a league season, like the example I linked above, maybe not.

Right now all the articles on Wikipedia as far as I know does not recognize this (I don't know if this perhaps is a recent request by the Slovak FA to FIFA or something), and it should really be fixed. (I have also looked at some old YUG/USSR nations and they dont seem to get the old honours, excluding Serbia and Russia). Just of the top of my head some articles that would need amending are UEFA, UEFA European Football Championship, and the statistic articles for both World Cup and European championship chandler ···\n\nYes,there is one strange thing in one list in UEFA Euro.fot.champ. and that is that appear both the Czech Rep. and Slovakia as having won once. I think that there was already a debate on the succesion issues and has been decided to folow the FIFA and UEFA decitions to recognise Russia as the succesor of URSS and Serbia as the succesor of Yugoslavia. I´m not sure for the Czechoslovakia case if the Czech R. is officially or not the succesor, but the issue here is that we can´t put all the countries(Czech R. and Slovakia) as winners of the EURO 1976. USSR also won once so,should we put then all the ex-USSR republics as winners? That´s crazy. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nYes I know we follow FIFA and UEFA that's why we NEED to note that FIFA considers Slovakia and Czech Republic as equal successors (as in both inherits the record and honours). The same is not for Croatia, Bosnia, Ukraine, Belarus etc. on FIFA.com they are not listed with Yugoslavia/Soviet Union match record or honours. chandler ···\n\nThis user has been adding \"UK\" on to the end of all the stadium locations.

Sandwiched in between, however, was some fairly tasty football. No sooner had the legislators rebranded the competition as the UEFA Champions League [5]\n\nA user has moved the finals away from \"1993 UEFA Champions League Final\" and \"1994 UEFA Champions League Final\", because the tickets/match programmes say \"European Champion Clubs' Cup final\". Now I feel this is against common name, and common sense. The finals are not separate from the competitions which were rebranded. UEFA have called the 2009 and 1997 (and therefore presumingly all other) Champions League finals \"European Champion Clubs' Cup finals\" (first sentence). So that would not make 1993 and 1994 unique to be called both. I also feel that it would confuse readers to see\n\nEuropean Cup 1991–92 / 1992 European Cup Final\n\nUEFA Champions League 1992–93 / 1993 European Cup Final\n\nUEFA Champions League 1993–94 / 1994 European Cup Final\n\nUEFA Champions League 1994–95 / 1995 UEFA Champions League Final\n\nI believe the 1993 and 1994 finals are commonly known as UEFA Champions League finals not European Cup finals. As we can see here l'OM are winners of the \"UEFA Champions League 1992/93\", while Barca are winners of the \"European Champions Clubs' Cup 1991/92\". I would say the finals are not separate from the competition, if we had semi finals articles they would be located at \"1993 UEFA Champions League Semi-finals\".

Rettetast (talk)\n\nCan someone familiar with Czech football briefly explain the difference/connection between Bohemians 1905 and Bohemians Praha (Střížkov)? I The Hack\n\nFunny, I asked the same question on the articles talk pages a while ago and it was answered by somebody with some knowledge but never added to the articles. Have a look at the talk pages, it should still be there. EA210269 (talk)\n\nJudging by the comments you are referring to, FC Bohemians Praha 1905 is the successor to the traditional Bohemians and FC Bohemians Praha basically bought the Bohemians name, colours and logo. This all assumes that information is correct...The Hack\n\nYes, thats pretty much it. Its a mess but, on a personal note, I think, Bohemians 1905 is the \"real\" Bohemians while the other is the \"fake\" one. When I last checked, the website of the former was quite good and in English and German, too, while the later didn't offer that service. Bohemians 1905 also claims the Bohemians traditions on its website. EA210269 (talk)\n\nIt is a situation with parallels to Wimbledon/MK Dons/AFC Wimbledon. Bohemians 1905 were formed by fans who regarded the identity of their club as being stolen. They play at the ground where the original Bohemians used to play. Oldelpaso (talk)\n\nThere really could then be three articles - one for the original Bohemians to capture the history and one each for the two current teams. If it as oldelpaso says, there are issues with the Bohemians 1905 page being POV by claiming the history of the original club...The Hack\n\nIf the Czech FA give the 1983 title to Bohemians 1905 they are the legal continuators of Bohemians. The president is Antonin Panenka who is the historic player of the club, too.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nIs there a reference for Bohemians 1905 being credited with the 1983 title?The Hack\n\nDon't know. If anyone is able to find it, this would solve the problem. I'm gonna try a little search.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nI had a bit of a look and there seems to have been some litigation over the name.The Hack\n\nI found some links in English (looks reliable, this is Czech radio) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]. Till 2005 no problem. Then money problems and they were relegated to third division by Czech FA, thanks to supporters who held a collection. But they promoted back in 2007 to the first division. About the honours of Bohemians; no information, but since the club was not dissolved (only relegated), they should have kept it.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nThis is probably a bit pedantic but the first article seems to indicate that the traditional Bohemians had ceased to exist. It uses the sentences \"After a series of efforts to save Bohemians, the club finally went under at the beginning of this year\" and \"The collapse of Bohemians football club\".The Hack\n\nBut the title \"revive bankrupt Bohemians football club\" indicate Bohemians 1905 are the successor, no? It is said \"This money will be used to save Bohemians. If we raise enough money we can make it into the third league\" that's what happened, no? There are clearly a connection between old Bohemians and Bohemians 1905. Clubs change their name when they have financial difficulties, but are still the same.--Latouffedisco (talk)\n\nDon't know if this requires as much alteration as the Czech problem listed above, but from what I can tell from the FIFA website no team has inherited the records of the Ireland team that existed before the partition of Ireland, even though the Northern Irish FA is the same FA that governed the original team. Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nWell fifa lists the FA as a affiliate since 1911 but in the archive for some reason you can't find the matches Ireland played played pre-1924, but not only not under NIR, but if you search Englands early match record you can't find them... So I don't know whats going on there from FIFA's side. So as I see it, currently (mistake or not) the history just doesn't exist on FIFA.com to be inherit for anyone, so it's hard to really be sure on that. chandler ···\n\nHmm I see what you mean. Seems like the old Ireland team is defunct as far as FIFA is concerned. Stu.W UK (talk)\n\nI dont know, for example you can still see East Germany's matches, Ireland's are just not there, as if the pre-split team was never a part of FIFA or its matches recognized. chandler ···\n\nRemember that all the Home Nations resigned from FIFA in the 1920s, hence why none of them participated in a World Cup until 1950. The IFA rejoined in 1946, stopped picking players from the 26 counties soon afterwards and first participated in a World Cup finals tournament as \"Northern Ireland\" in 1958. Jmorrison230582 (talk)\n\nBut FIFA has retrospectively recognised the Home Nations' results going back to the 1870s.

If it's readily available from reliable published sources, then the presence of a reference will at least demonstrate to the IP that it isn't a secret.

Very bizarre.--EchetusXe (talk)\n\nI got a question for the Mexican league's tournaments. As it stands, each tournament has an article that covers the tournament in general, an article for the playoff round, and an article of the finals (I remind everyone that there are two tournaments per season in Mexico). Take a look at this article for example.\n\nI'm wondering if this league's tournament should exist in three article? One of the reasonings behind this current way of doing things in this league is because MLS seasons have three articles: one for the season in general, one for the playoffs, and one for the final. That seems like faulty reasoning since it seems, at least to me, that MLS season articles are handled differently because American sports leagues have a certain way of doing things. But Mexico isn't in the US, so it should be similar to other league season's articles (only one article)... right? (FYI, Mexico is not the only league to have multi-stages seasons/tournaments for their top league. Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay also have multi-stage leagues/tournaments, but in different formats. So a decision here has the potential to affect articles in those leagues aswell). Digirami (talk)\n\nIn my opinion it would be much better if all the seperate stages of a season were combined into one overview article, if there is enough content to justify seperate articles for the individual stages these can be linked from the overview article, in a similar way to recent editions of Copa Libertadores. Hope this helps King of the North East\n\nYes, and no.\n\nYes, because it is also my opinion that one league season, in this case league tournament, should be in one article.\n\nNo, because you bring in the Copa Libertadores, an international club tournament, for a basis to do something in a league tournament. But, an international club tournament is different from a league, and as such I think it should, and have seen, that it is dealt differently because of notability reasons and most likely article size, too. Thus you are sorta saying an apple should be like an orange, even though they are different. But I want to know how to deal with those apples because they are apples. Digirami (talk)\n\nThe reason I brought up the Copa Libertadores as an example is the fact that I know you are familiar with it. If all the stages of the season can be fitted into one article, then do it that way, but if this would create a page in excess of 30-40kb, it could be better to create an overview page and subpages for the seperate stages for reasons of size. King of the North East\n\nBut then the question becomes how much detail should go into a league tournament article. Going back to comparing the two, I can understand why editors display the details of international tournament stages (goals, etc): those articles are really important. But one league season's tournaments is not as important, so is it really necessary to have the same amount of detail? Taking a look at the main Apertura 2008 article, the one linked in my initial post, the current article size is at 30kb with two tables, club information, top-scorer table, a results table for the first round, and a bracket with scores to show the progression of the last round. The information in the main article has the same level of detail found in any league article in that it has the scores, standings, and some season stats. So how much detail do we really need to have for the final stage to merit it's own article? Then there is the question of if the final, found here, is notable enough under any current notability guidelines for matches to even merit its own article. Digirami (talk)\n\nThe second tier is at Czech 2. Liga (capital L) but the top tier is at Gambrinus liga (lower-case L) - any reason for this? Also, the official name of the top tier appears to be 1. Liga and the sponsored name 1. Gambrinus Liga, so the current article title doesn't actually match either...... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nI would suggest to move all of the \"Gambrinus liga\" articles to Czech 1. Liga or a similar name. Although the league has been known under that name since its beginnings in 1993, it seems to be consensus to not include sponsoring companys or brands in article names. Even Norway's Tippeligaen, to my surprise, is listed as Norwegian Premier League. --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nUser:Kengi1982 created some unsourced footballer from Thai top division, except they were full internationals to fulfill notability guidelines, did Thai Top division is fully-professional to fulfill notability guideline? Matthew_hk tc\n\nThe article for the Thai Premier League states that it is professional - this statement is unsourced, but there a few sources that seme to back this up. For exmaple, this news story mentions this twice, and the AFC states that the league has bene fully profesisonal since 1995. The second source in particular seems strong enough for us to say that, yes, the Thai league is fully professional. Bettia it's a puppet!\n\nWith the end of the season coming upon us, a few procedural things perhaps should be discussed. I remember in the past there's been some differences over when a club's article should be changed to their new division. I.e. \"Exeter City are a football club in League One\"/changing the infobox etc. Similarly in the past the league team templates have been changed, typically at first by ips, with asterisks saying \"promoted/relegated\" and so on. Thirdly, once a club's season has ended, I presume we immeadiately send the players they have on loan back to their parent club? I know some loans are listed as until June 2009, but seems a bit pointless keeping them on. Anyway, thoughts? HornetMike (talk)\n\nChanges of division take place from the beginning of the season, which in England is, I believe, officially 1st July: Wolves should not be described as a Premiership team until then, nor Luton as a conference side, nor any other divisional change. This is the way that it has been consistently reported by the FA, the BBC, and responsible members of the press.\n\nAs to player moves/releases, strictly speaking that should be reported consistently with the terms of their contracts, in the case of loans, that is rarely known exactly, although care should be taken when either club is involved in play-offs. For players at the end of their contracts who are being \"released\", I suspect that it is most unusual for players to voluntarily waive two months of income, and standard contracts (in English football) run until the end of June, so I believe that players, although described as \"released\", remain on the payroll, and potentially a disciplinary liability, to the club that they were with, until the end of June. \"Carlos Kickaball is a Fooian footballer registered to for Everpool FC, although it has been announced that hos contract will not be renewed when it expires in June 2009\" seems more accurate to me than \"Carlos Kickaball is a Fooian footballer currently without a club since his release in May 2009 from Everpool FC\" Kevin McE (talk)\n\nCan someone of our \"Navbox converters\" please have a look at Template:Serie A seasons, which I have converted to Navbox style earlier today? The little bugger displays a blank line after its content (see Serie A 2008–09 for an example), but even after a full hour of code review, I cannot find the error. *grumbles* Any help would be gladly appreciated. --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nfixed the break before noinclude on {{Serie A}} chandler ···\n\nAnother problem with a composite template? I am über annoyed. Thanks for the fix! --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nIn the article of A.C. Siena, it is said that the club returned Serie A in 2003 after last playing in Italy's top division in 1946. However, in the \"history\" section as well as the article Serie A, it is said that in 2003 it saw the first Serie A season of Siena in the club's history. So which one is true? Has Siena played in Serie A in 1946 and before? Salt (talk)\n\nIn 1945-46 a mixed wartime league composed by Serie A and Serie B teams was played; it was not officially recognized as 'Serie A' by the federation, since it was not even a single league (it was composed by a Northern and a Southern league, which Siena was part of, with top teams from them then playing a playoff tournament) but the league winners (Torino) were officially awarded the title. In short, it is not Serie A, so the first time for Siena in the Serie A league is in 2003. Details about the 1945-46 season can be found here: Serie A 1945-46. --Angelo (talk)\n\nThank you for the answer. I am going to add the relevant information to the article as currently it is a little bit unclear for those not familiar with the Serie A history like me. Salt (talk)\n\nCan one of our administrators within the project please execute the move in the section title? The latter is currently a redirect to La Liga and thus blocking a regular move via the respective button. Thanks in advance, Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nI have tagged the page with {{db-move}}. – PeeJay\n\nThe lists of statistics and records have three naming styles; examples follow:\n\nArsenal F.C. records\n\nHereford United F.C. statistics (seems to be a records page)\n\nList of Ipswich Town F.C. statistics and records\n\nI don't care whether statistics or records (or the combination of both) are used in the page title, but \"List of\" needs to be the beginning of the page title. Dabomb87 (talk)\n\nYes, all similar pages should have identical naming patterns...personally, I would go with List of Ipswich Town F.C. statistics and records as the guide. GiantSnowman\n\nThere seems to be a trend towards using the \"List of...\" beginning in articles on Wikipedia. Why is this? What benefits does this provide over, say, the \"Blah F.C. records\" style? Especially when the \"list of\" titles can be redirects anyway. It seems to me to be a bit a of a pointless addition. Sillyfolkboy (talk) (edits)\n\nAgree. Where exactly does it specify that \"List of\" needs to be at the front? --Jameboy (talk)\n\nAnswering my own question, I think it is covered by WP:LISTNAME. --Jameboy (talk)\n\nLocated at Chris Cummins (footballer), he only ever played semi-professionally (although there's no mention of that on the article), he's now interim manager of Toronto F.C.. I know established tradition is to disam as (footballer) even if a person is better known as a manager, but I reckon using \"(football coach)\" or \"(football manager)\" would be better in this instance. Thoughts? HornetMike (talk)\n\nI'd say if he never played at a notable level, we shouldn't diambiguate him as a footballer. If there were two equally notable Russell Crowes, we wouldn't disambiguate the one out of Gladiator as \"Russell Crowe (musician)\" based on that terrible band he was also in. A precedent exists at Robert Brown (football manager), who never played professionally..... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nLooks to me like someone's been messing around with Template:Infobox Football biography 2 - and it looks terrible. Can we revert this, or has the move been WikiApproved? GiantSnowman\n\nI'd normally just leave Ms2ger to get on with it as he generally knows templatespace very well, but I agree that these particular changes were questionable (or entirely baffling: bodyclass=geography?) - if changes need to be made then it'll need to happen gradually and preferably with some discussion as to the rationale. Chris Cunningham (not at work) - talk\n\nThe {{fb}} tag produces an automatically-generated link to a national football team page in a player's infobox when accompanied by the three-letter FIFA trigramme like this - England - and, in my opinion, is extremely helpful. It reduces the need to remember long link text when linking to national team articles, makes infobox cleaner and easier to read when editing, and (if properly maintained) would negate the need to change lots and lots of the links in the (admittedly unlikely) event the page for a national football team was moved, as a simple change to the fb tag would automatically change all the links to that page.\n\nThe bone of contention seems to be that the tag produces a flag, which a number of edits believe contravenes the guidelines on flag use at WP:MOSFLAG. The section of this guideline relating to sportspeople states \"Where flags are used in a table, it should clearly indicate that the flags represent sporting nationality, not nationality, if any confusion might arise.\" It is my thought that using the fb tag does not contravene this guideline, as the flag being used CLEARLY relates to sporting nationality (i.e. the country the player represents internationally), and therefore is perfectly acceptable.\n\nAnother sticking point in the past has been the fact that using flags in infoboxes messed with line formatting in the infoboxes and made the resulting box ugly; however, this problem is no longer is an issue with the new Football Infobox 2, which puts each line of text on an individual line rather than being broken by <br>'s.\n\nSo, I would like to formally propose that editors allow the use of the {{fb}} tags in infoboxes, and that the resulting flags be allowed as an indicator of sporting nationality - and ONLY sporting nationality (i.e. flags by places of birth/death and to show the nationality of a team still would not be allowed). --JonBroxton (talk)\n\nYep, sounds good to me - flag is OK next to national team but NOT club teams etc, place of birth etc. GiantSnowman\n\nPlease, not any more flags. What is the problem in manually creating the national team link? You have to do this once in a players career. I vote against that proposal. Formally. Madcynic (talk)\n\nBecause it's handy. No-one is saying you HAVE to use it. The proposal is just to allow it if you want to. --JonBroxton (talk)\n\nI can't really see the point in putting a flag next to the written name of the national team, this type of usage seems to be purely decorative. Putting flags next to club teams makes more sense to me, since it is not always obvious at a glance where a player has plied his trade to those readers that do not have an encycolpaedic knowledge of world football. Having said this, I am still opposed to the use of any flags in infoboxes. King of the North East\n\nIt's not about the flag, it's about the tag. The only reason I mention the flag is because the fact that the tag produces a flag seems to be the entire reason people have for not using the tag. My reasoning is: \"the tag is useful and helpful, so can we please ignore the fac that there's a flag in this particular instance\". --JonBroxton (talk)\n\nIf you want a simple way to link to England, instead of writing [[England national football team|England]], why not just write {{subst:nft|England}}. It produces exactly the same result as {{fb|ENG}} except without the flag. – PeeJay\n\nI had no idea that other tag existed.--JonBroxton (talk)\n\nThe only problem with nft over fb are for teams like the USA, which does produce a redirect in nft but a correct link in fb, perhaps nft could be reconfigured to use the flag template system without the flag, because for example now you can't use United States chandler ···\n\nA possibility would perhaps be to amend {{fb}} to create a link without the flag (this would create the possibility of using United States and give correct links to all teams, and sort of fork nft by not using subst:), if this was the fb template United States would create a link without the flag, while [[|]] with a flag... this could either be done inside the fb, or make a new separate or remake nft to use without "
