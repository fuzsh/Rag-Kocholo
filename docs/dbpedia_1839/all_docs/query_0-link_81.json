        "text": "5 Former Super Eagles Legends Who Have Gone Totally Broke Now\n\nThey earned colossal amounts of pounds and dollars in careers that spanned many years from Europe to Asia but they most probably did not put enough aside to tide them over a football career that could end almost as soon it started.\n\nThey flew and rode the best cars at the heights of their careers and bought things without batting an eye.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive though some of the players are trying to regain their footing after some of their investments went kaput!\n\n1. Celestine Babayaro\n\nThe former Super Eagles star and most probably the best cultured left-back that has played for Nigeria played for some of the biggest clubs in both England and Belgium declared himself bankrupt at a court in Croydon in 2011.\n\nAt a time in his career, Cele, as he was famously known, was amongst the highest paid African players in the world as he earned a tidy pile of ‘cash’ stated to be between £25,000 and $30,000 per week at Chelsea.\n\nHe was reported to have lived an expensive lifestyle both here in Nigeria and England. Stories went round of how he blew thousands of Pounds in buying exotic items and also partied hard with friends.\n\nAccording to a BBC report, Celestine Babayaro “financial troubles became apparent to his neighbours, with one saying that his usually beautifully kept house, began to look a bit unkempt, with the garden overgrowing and the conservatory falling down”\n\n2. Ifeanyi Udeze\n\nMost Super Eagles supporters in the early years of the new century will be familiar with Ifeanyi Udeze, the explosive left-back was a key member of the national team between 2000 to 2004.\n\nSadly, things have took a turn for the worse for Udeze as sources close to the player revealed that the former World Cup star is neck deep in debt after squandering the substantial fortune he gained during his playing days on high stake gambling and other luxuries.\n\nUdeze who featured for AEK Athens, PAOK FC, and West Brom while active, is also said to have a particular preference for locally manufactured gin (Kparaga) and he can also been seen indulging in street gambling with some undesirable elements around his neighbourhood.\n\n3. Taribo West\n\nFormer Super Eagles defender, Taribo West is perhaps the most successful Nigerian centre-back in history.\n\nAt the height of his career, he was regarded as one of the best defenders in Europe and was a key member of the Inter Milan squad between 1997 and 1999 and was also part of the victorious Olympic gold winning dream team side in 1996.\n\nHowever, despite featuring for top sides in Europe such as AC Milan, Derby County, Kaiserslautern, Partizan and a brief spell in the Middle East with Qatari side, Al-Arabi Doha, Taribo is said to be in financial deep waters as the millions he made during his playing days seems to have been washed away by in a Tsunami.\n\nHe also made a bad investment in his marriage but now can be seen on Lagos streets preaching and trying his hands in winning souls for God a vocation he undertook towards the end of his career.\n\n4. Victor Agali\n\nVictor Agali formed a formidable striker partnership with Nwankwo Kanu which was fondly dubbed the ‘Twin Towers’.\n\nThe tall and lanky stubborn forward was particular loved by Super Eagles fans due to his proficiency in aerial duels. His tall physique and his imposing stature saw him lace his boots for top European sides such as Olympique Marseille, Hansa Rostock, Schalke 04, and Nice.\n\nHowever, sources close to the player revealed that the former Super Eagles star is not doing too well financially. Apparently, despite earning an average pay of £25, 000 per week while in Germany, some failed investments and a clearly lavish lifestyle has seen him scrapping financially. Agali was last seen hosting a Reality TV show in Lagos.\n\n5. Chikelue Iloenyosi\n\nChikelue Iloenyosi may not be up to the pedigree of players mentioned earlier in terms of achievement, but he did made a career playing football and quite a profitable one at that. He was part of the national U-20 side that featured in the World Youth Championship in Nigeria in 1999.\n\nHe also won four caps with the Super Eagles. He is famous for his marriage to Nollywood star, Stephenie Okereke that was annulled by a Lagos court after it was discovered that he was legally married to another woman in the United States at the time he took Stephenie to the altar.\n\nHowever, despite featuring for clubs in Turkey, Libya, Australia and Saudi Arabia, Iloenyosi is not doing too well financially at present. Sources claim that the defender has delved into fashion designing with a keen interest in men’s clothing.\n\nSource: Fcnaija.com\n\n3 Football Clubs Included In Forbes Most Valuable Sports Team In 2014 [SEE TOP 10]\n\nForbes have released their 2014 figures for brand value in sports, with the most valuable sports team brands on the planet being one of the section of data to have been analysed by Forbes, who have come to the figures used through their own calculations and methods.\n\nThree soccer teams made the list.

Meet the top ten highest paid Chelsea players.\n\nChelsea celebrate against Everton\n\n10. Branislav Ivanovic – £75,000\n\nThe Serbian born Ivanovic signed for Chelsea from Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow in January 2008 and has remained a bulwark in the team. He can play either as a right back or as a centre back.\n\n9. John Mikel Obi – £75,000\n\nMikel Obi, the Nigerian international came into international prominence when he was voted as runner-up to Lionel Messi at the 2005 edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup.\n\nIn 2005, Chelsea and Manchester United were in a tug of war over the midfielder’s signature before he finally settled for Chelsea.\n\n8. Didier Drogba – £80,000\n\nIn the history of Chelsea, one man holds a special place and that person is Didier Drogba.\n\nIn 2012 he led Chelsea to the Holy Grail of club football – the UEFA Champions League, little wonder he was named as the greatest player of all-time at the club by thousands of Chelsea’s fans.\n\n7. Gary Cahill – £90,000\n\nThe former Bolton defender has grown in leaps and bounds since he joined the Blues for £7 million in January 2012.\n\nHis partnership with club captain, John Terry has become the bedrock for the team and even warranted the sale of David Luiz to PSG last summer. Cahill is now England’s assistant captain.\n\n6. Petr Cech – £120,000\n\nThe long-serving Czech goalkeeper has shed blood for the Blues though he has had to play second fiddle to the newly arrived Thibaut Courtois.\n\nBut when Cech joined Chelsea in 2004, he became an instant hit and in that season, where he kept 21 clean sheets, Chelsea marched to a first league title in 50 years.\n\n5. John Terry – £175,000\n\nChelsea’s captain and leader for the past 11 years joined the Blues from West Ham at 14 and has been at the Bridge ever since except for a brief period in 2000, when he went on loan to Nottingham Forest.\n\nHe has played over 500 games for the club in the EPL and is their most successful captain.\n\n4. Fernando Torres – £175,000\n\nThough he is out on loan at AC Milan, the former Liverpool menace is contracted to Chelsea for the next two seasons though he will be spending it on loan at the San Siro.\n\nHe was bought for £50 million in ??? but over three years he could not justify the humongous purchase price.\n\n3. Eden Hazard – £185,000\n\nHazard is the wunderkind in Jose Mourinho’s constellation of stars. He is highly thought of and could increase his salary if he decides to quit Stamford Bridge to join PSG, who are serious courters.\n\n2. Diego Costa – £200,000\n\nThe new goals king at Chelsea has hit the ground running and seems tailor-made for the tactics that Jose Mourinho wants to employ.\n\nThe £32 million used to get his services from Atletico Madrid seems like pittance with the benefit of hindsight. If he continues at the present rate, Chelsea will be a crowned EPL champions come May 2015.\n\n1. Cesc Fabregas – £200,000\n\nFabregas\n\nThe supposed final piece in Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea team for the 2014/15 season and with the amount of assists he has provided already, especially in the EPL, he is worth every penny of the £200,000 weekly salary.\n\nFabregas is making the Chelsea engine tick over nicely as the season progresses.\n\nCheck Out The Top 10 Highest Paid Players In The MLS\n\nFormer AC Milan and Real Madrid midfielder Kaka has been revealed as the highest earning MLS player, despite never having played for his club.\n\nThe 32-year-old Brazilian, who signed for Orlando City in June and was immediately loaned to Sao Paulo, earns just over £4.4million a year, which works out at £84,000 per week.\n\nLA Galaxy forward Robbie Keane (£2.76m), meanwhile, earns more than Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (£2.67m) does at the New York Red Bulls.\n\nMLS TOP 10 EARNERS 2014\n\nKaka £4.4m (£84,000 per week)\n\nClint Dempsey £4.1m (£78,000 per week)\n\nMichael Bradley £3.9m (£75,000 per week)\n\nJermain Defoe £3.8m (£73,000 per week)\n\nLandon Donovan £2.8m (£53,000 per week)\n\nRobbie Keane £2.76m (£53,000 per week)\n\nThierry Henry £2.67m (£51,000 per week)\n\nTim Cahill £2.22m (£42,000 per week)\n\nJermaine Jones £1.99m (£38,000 per week)\n\nMarco Di Vaio £1.59m (£30,000 per week)\n\nFrank Lampard Reveals His All Time Greatest XI.

It is filled with abundantly talented lads.\n\nFrom the green pastures of the west to the north and the beautiful terrain of the south and east, Africa boasts of exceptional football talents.\n\nThis has led us to compile a shortlist of the brightest prospects from Africa that may become future world stars. Here are seven players that we think can be big success in the future.\n\n8. Victor Wanyama\n\nThis 23 year old Kenyan has amazed everyone with his athletic qualities and football talent. He plays as a defensive midfielder and he has been praised severally for his physical style of play.\n\nWanyama became the first Kenyan to play in the English premier league when he completed his transfer from Celtic FC to Southampton F.C a year ago. Wanyama is the captain of the Kenyan national team and a lot is expected from him in the near future.\n\n7.Bertrand Traore\n\nA lot has been said about this young lad in recent times for the potentials he showed at a very young age.\n\nBertrand became the youngest player to feature in a continental qualifier match at just 17 for the Burkinabè. Traore plays for Chelsea F.C and is currently on loan to Vitesse Arnhem in Holland.\n\nJose Mourinho described him as an exciting prospect and could become a world class midfielder in the future.\n\n6. Youssef M’sakni\n\nThis talented midfielder is one of the bright prospects to emerge from the desert nation of Tunisia. Often likened to Ronaldo for his dribbling exploits, M,sakni burst onto the scene with the Desert Foxes at AFCON 2011.\n\nHe was courted by several top European teams before opting to join Lekhwiya SC of Qatar due to Arabic connections. It is yet to be seen if M’sakni will fulfill potential already 24.\n\n5. Serge Aurier\n\nSerge Aurier has been touted for great things, at just 21 he is a regular for the Ivorian national side.\n\nSerge possesses great athletic qualities, a hard tackler and a dangerous weapon going forward. Aurier has earned praises for his ability to deliver excellent crosses, he plays at right back on loan at PSG from his parent club Toulouse in France.\n\n4. Christian Atsu\n\nOf course we have all heard about him from his exploits during Ghana short run at the World Cup this year in Brazil. I talked about the qualities of this young man in my preview of Ghana prior to the showdown.\n\nThis diminutive attacker likes to play on the right or left of attack and possess great abilities for his age, Atsu is currently on loan at Everton F.C from Chelsea in England.\n\n3. Kenneth Omeruo\n\nIt is hard to believe that 6″1 tall Omeruo is already a regular for Nigeria at just 20. Having passed through all the age grades of the National teams, Kenneth is one of few center backs with so much experience at such a young age.\n\nOf all the players on this list, Omeruo stands out. Already fulfilling his potentials and showing the world his defensive prowess. He is one his second stint on loan at Middleborough from his parent club Chelsea.\n\n2. Mohammed Salah\n\nMohammed Ghaly Salah has already made a name for himself at the world stage for his exploits in Europe.\n\nBorn and bred in Egypt, he played in Egypt before signing for Swiss side Basel in 2012. CAF named him the Most Promising African Talent that year and he won the SAFP Golden Award for best player in the league the following year.\n\nAt just 22, the exciting winger is a regular for the Pharaohs scoring six goals in 2013 AFCON qualifiers. Salah plays with Chelsea in England.\n\n1. Kelechi Iheanacho\n\nHis name is on everyone’s lips, He is a young prodigy, due to his abilities to play in any role attack. Iheanacho who finished top scorer of the recent Under 17 World Cup with six goals, and also won the tournament with the Golden Eaglets has been touted by many to be the next ‘big thing’ from our continent.\n\nVoted CAF Most Promising African Talent this year, Iheanacho has been banging goals for his English side Manchester City F.C in their pre-season games.\n\nConsidering the fact that he is just 17, I am sure this young lad will not join the list of talents who never made their make at the biggest stage.\n\nFollow@ Olar_switch\n\nTwo Nigerians Included In Top 10 Strongest Footballers In The World!

Players To Watch Out For In Every Team At Brazil 2014\n\nBrazil – Neymar\n\nA lot is expected of the young Barcelona man and the weight of a nation will be propped up on the 22 year old’s shoulders and his ability to deliver, or otherwise, could reflect just how well Felipe Scolari’s side fare as the host nation.\n\nNeymar put in a sterling display during the Confederations Cup last summer but will be all too aware that there is a world of difference between that competition and the 2014 World Cup finals.\n\nCroatia – Luka Modric\n\nThe schemer has been in outstanding form for Real Madrid this season and the experienced midfielder will be pulling the strings in a creative Croatian side that has it’s work cut out just to make it out of the Group A.\n\nThe former Tottenham man made 51 appearances in all competitions in 2013/14 so coach Niko Kovac will have to hope the pint sized performer isn’t worn out by the exertions of a busy season at the Bernabeu.\n\nMexico – Marco Fabian\n\nThe 24 year old attacker has been in fine form of late and will look to continue in a similar vein as his side looks to fight their way out of Group A.\n\nFabian has scored in recent friendlies against Ecuador and Israel and whilst on loan at Cruz Azul helped the Mexico City side to a CONCACAF Champions League.\n\nThe Most Important Player for Each National Team Competing at the 2014 World Cup Finals\n\nCameroon – Samuel Eto’o\n\nThough not used regularly the veteran striker did make an impact during his season at Chelsea, scoring against top sides and going some way to challenge Jose Mourinho’s assertion that he was in fact older than he claimed to be.\n\nExperienced forward knows this is more than likely his last major tournament and will want to go out with a bang, likely to be more than a handful against even the best defences.\n\nSpain – Andres Iniesta\n\nVicente del Bosque’s all conquering side is certainly aging and a player who will be expected to make a real impact at the finals is Barcelona’s Andres Iniesta.\n\nThe 30 year old can always be counted upon to deliver the goods at the highest level and will look to offer a commanding presence in the final third whilst keeping hold of the ball and rarely losing possession and on hand to score a crucial goal or two.\n\nChile – Alexis Sanchez\n\nFresh from his most productive season at Barcelona and the subject of a ton of transfer speculation the adaptable attacker has shown great form in warm-up matches and is a player that coach Jorge Sampaoli will be relying upon to provide the spark in the final third.\n\nHolland – Robin Van Persie\n\nBack to full fitness after a tough second season at Old Trafford the experienced forward will lead Louis van Gaal’s front-line and is more than capable of causing opposition defences all sorts of problems.\n\nThe Man United man is rightly considered one of the favourites for the Golden Boot and would hope to grab a hat-ful against the Aussies.\n\nAustralia – Mile Jedinak\n\nThe tough tackling midfielder had an excellent season, more than proving himself in the English top tier, and playing a key role in keeping Tony Pulis’s side not just clear of the drop but up towards the top half of the table.\n\nThe uncompromising enforcer may however want to tone it down a notch or he could be the recipient of more than a few cautions, or worse.\n\nColombia – Jackson Martinez\n\nWith Radamel Falcao failing to recover from injury in time for the finals a lot will depend on how FC Porto man Jackson Martinez performs.\n\nThe powerful forward will be the man enlisted with the job of busting past defences as Jose Pékerman’s side look to continue with the fine form that saw them finish second in the South American qualifying group.\n\nGreece – Giorgos Karagounis\n\nWith 134 caps to his name the Fulham midfielder will be looked upon as the man to get the most of a hard working, if not spectacularly skillful, Greek side as they look to qualify from a very average group.\n\nHaving suffered relegation to the Championship the much traveled veteran may look upon the World Cup as something of a shop window for his talents.\n\nIvory Coast – Yaya Toure\n\nMan City man cracked in 20 Premier League goals and was one of the big successes of the 2013/14 season and is a player in the peak of his powers.\n\nThe rangy attack minded midfielder should have a field day in a group that The Elephants should comfortably qualify from.\n\nJapan – Shinji Kagawa\n\nThough something of a bit-part player at Old Trafford the 25 year old is a key member of the Japanese international squad and a player who bears a great deal of responsibility.\n\nOn his day the former Borussia Dortmund man can be a joy to watch and a player who can make something out of nothing, however he is also frequently guilty of vanishing from the action and drifting in and out of games.\n\nUruguay – Luis Suarez\n\nEven though the Liverpool man is something of an injury doubt his importance to his national team’s ability to make real progress at the World Cup can not be underestimated.\n\nWhilst PSG forward Edinson Cavani is more than capable of netting regularly Suarez offers a far more rounded attacking weapon for Oscar Tabarez and the Uruguayan coach will be praying the 27 year old is fighting fit for his side’s encounters with Italy and England.\n\nCosta Rica – Celso Borges\n\nThe rangy central midfielder will be a player coach Jorge Luis Pinto counts on as his Costa Rica side prepare for three monumental fixtures.\n\nBorges has been in good form with Swedish side AIK and impressed in the qualification campaign.\n\nEngland – Steven Gerrard\n\nAfter a superb season with Liverpool, his best for years, Roy Hodgson will hope that the veteran skipper can make an impact in Brazil where his ability to link midfield and attack will be key.\n\nGiven the conditions Gerrard may well be employed in a similar withdrawn role to the one he has enjoyed under Brendan Rodgers and clearly has the experience to cope with the incredible pressure the England squad will be under during the competition from expectant fans back home and an insatiable media ready to tear the team to shreds if they are deemed to have\n\nItaly – Andrea Pirlo\n\nAnother veteran performer who is at the top of his game and another player who’s ability to shine on the highest stage could be key to their nation’s performance in Brazil.\n\nThe Juventus midfielder has been outstanding for his Turin side in 2013/14 and Cesare Prandelli will look to the bearded magician to produce the usual level of expert distribution and provide his fair share of inch perfect set piece deliveries.\n\nSwitzerland – Xherdan Shaqiri\n\nYoung winger has struggled to retain a foothold in the Bayern Munich first team set-up and will be looking to impress this summer in the hope of persuading Pep Guardiola of his worth or alternatively helping to attract interest from Europe’s ‘Elite’.\n\nShaqiri is arguably one of the only members of Ottmar Hitzfeld’s defensively sound but attackingly unspectacular squad able to make something out of nothing.\n\nEcuador – Luis Antonio Valencia\n\nHugely important member of Reinaldo Rueda’s squad and a player who regularly delivers the good for his country and a player who may well benefit from playing without the same level of pressure he’s been under at Man United during the Old Trafford side’s disastrous season.\n\nFrance – Karim Benzema\n\nReal Madrid forward received a fair amount of abuse during a barren run that saw the 26 year old go 16 months without a national team goal but is now back to somewhere near his best.\n\nBenefited from Gonzalo Higuain’s sale to Napoli, leaving Bernabeu boss Carlo Ancelotti to use Benzema almost exclusively as his starting centre-forward and Benzema netted 24 goals in all competitions and goes into the finals on a high after helping the Spanish giants to ‘La Decima’.\n\nHonduras – Carlo Costly\n\nExperienced striker scored seven goals in qualifying and has netted in friendlies against Ecuador and Israel since booking their spot in the finals.\n\nNational team favourite will hope to be up for the challenge against the top defence of France and could fancy his chances against Ecuador and Switzerland.\n\nArgentina – Lionel Messi\n\nAfter an average, by his own high standards, season during which the Barcelona man managed just 41 goals in 46 appearances the 26 year old captain’s his national team in Brazil and we expect Lionel Messi to deliver the goods.\n\n2013/14 was very much a troubled season for Messi, with court cases, in-fighting at Barcelona and the loss of a La Liga title no doubt taking it’s toll on the diminutive attacker but free from the Nou Cam shackles Messi will be a player Alejandro Sabella pins a lot of hope on.\n\nBosnia – Edin Dzeko\n\nMan City man’s form at the tail end of the 2013/14 campaign made all the difference as Manuel Pellegrini coped with the absence of first choice striker Sergio Aguero for much of the final months of the season.\n\nPowerful forward is a good outside bet for the Golden Boot as he seeks to help his nation to a solid showing in their first World Cup finals campaign.\n\nIran – Reza Ghoochannejhad\n\nCharlton Athletic forward netted three goals in World Cup qualifying and top-scored for Iran in their Asian Cup qualifying campaign and is a player who is likely to lead Carlos Queiroz’s attack.\n\nIran are expected to be the whipping boys of group F and a goal or two would be considered something of an achievement.\n\nNigeria – Vincent Enyeama\n\nQuality keeper had an excellent 2010 World Cup finals and will once again be expected to provide a strong last line of defence as Stephen Keshi looks to secure passage to the last 16.\n\nEnyeama enjoyed a phenomenal season at Lille during which he racked up 11 consecutive clean sheets.\n\nGermany – Mesut Ozil\n\nPlaymaker will look to make a impact in Brazil after an average debut season with Arsenal, very much a player Joachim Low will look to cause real problems in the final third.\n\n25 year old had a superb qualifying campaign, netting eight goals for Germany as they breezed into the finals and cause all sorts of problems for opposition defences.\n\nThe Most Important Player for Each National Team Competing at the 2014 World Cup Finals\n\nPortugal – Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nInjury fears are rife and Paulo Bento knows full well that without the Real Madrid man his side could struggle to book their way to the knockout stages, such is the importance of the 29 year old national team captain.\n\nIt would be impossible to overplay the importance of Ronaldo to Portugal’s hopes, his hat-trick during the A Selecção play-off win over Sweden goes some way to illustrating just how the attacker can make or break his nation’s chances.\n\nGhana – Sulley Muntari\n\nThe AC Milan man will provide the Black Stars both midfield bite and creative endeavour, the 29 year old has the experience for the occasion and will hope to drive his side through the Group of Death to the second phase.\n\nCould benefit from a less than spectacular San Siro campaign now that he can perhaps play with some more freedom where in many ways not a lot is expected from his Ghana side given the level of opposition they face.\n\nUnited States – Clint Dempsey\n\nFormer Tottenham man has enjoyed a return to his native United States and is a member of Jurgen Klinsmann’s squad truly capable of causing a nuisance against the best defence, that’s if he is at his very best.\n\nDempsey has netted nine goals in 15 appearances for the Seattle Sounders and goals in friendly action against Belgium and Germany bodes well.\n\nBelgium – Eden Hazard\n\nPint sized Chelsea man enjoyed a good season at Stamford Bridge on a personal level, finishing the campaign as the west London club’s leading assist maker and top-scorer.\n\nA lot is expected of Marc Wilmots side at the 2014 World Cup finals and the Belgium coach will want Hazard to be at his very best if his side is to push on to the later stages of the tournament.\n\nAlgeria – Sofiane Feghouli\n\nValencia wide-man had an excellent season at the Mestalla, the 24-year-old scoring seven goals and providing 10 assists, and is key to Vahid Halilhodzic’s hopes of guiding Algeria through group H and into the knock-out stages.\n\nFeghouli scored in Algeria’s narrow key victory over Burkina Faso in the final round of African qualifiers.\n\nRussia – Alan Dzagoev\n\nTalented playmaker who can turn a game on it’s head with his attacking abilities and a player who has previously proven himself at the highest level.\n\nThe 23 year old scored three goals in Euro 2012 and was a key performer for a Russian side that under-performed in Poland & Ukraine but could be ready to repeat the trick in Brazil having helped his CSKA Moscow side to a domestic title.\n\nSouth Korea – Son Heung-Min\n\nHugely talented youngster is rightly considered one of the hottest prospects in Asian football who has impressed during his debut season at Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThe strong forward could help South Korea to mount a genuine push to make it through Group H."
