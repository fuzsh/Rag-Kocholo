There is evidence from genetic epidemiology research that DNA sequence differences contribute to human variation in physical activity level, cardiorespiratory fitness in the untrained state, cardiovascular and metabolic response to acute exercise, and responsiveness to regular exercise. Methodological and technological advances have made it possible to undertake the molecular dissection of the genetic component of complex, multifactorial traits, such as those of interest to exercise biology, in terms of tissue expression profile, genes, and allelic variants. The evidence from animal models and human studies is considered. Data on candidate genes, genome-wide linkage results, genome-wide association findings, expression arrays, and combinations of these approaches are reviewed. Combining transcriptomic and genomic technologies has been shown to be more powerful as evidenced by the development of a recent molecular predictor of the ability to increase VO2max with exercise training. For exercise as a behavior and physiological fitness as a state to be major players in public health policies will require that that the role of human individuality and the influence of DNA sequence differences be understood. Likewise, progress in the use of exercise in therapeutic medicine will depend to a large extent on our ability to identify the favorable responders for given physiological properties to a given exercise regimen.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis chapter is devoted to the role of genetic variation and gene-exercise interactions in the biology of adaptation to exercise. The basic principles of genomics, genetics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics are introduced for the reader less familiar with these concepts and the underlying technologies and science. The evidence accumulated from quantitative genetics and genetic epidemiology research is summarized, as it provides a foundation for the advances that were later made at the molecular level. The role of genetic differences in the inclination to be physically active or to exercise vigorously is then reviewed. This is followed by comprehensive sections focused on the role of genetic variation in cardiorespiratory endurance and skeletal muscle strength and power. The contribution of genetic variation to the ability to respond to regular exercise is discussed. Studies on gene expression and the global transcriptome, as they pertain to adaptation to exercise and exercise-induced changes in performance indicators, risk factors, and disease outcomes are summarized. Emerging data on approaches combining genomics and transcriptomics with an emphasis on the physiological adaptation to regular exercise are highlighted. A brief discussion of the most promising research strategies and technologies for the discovery of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hormonal, and metabolic adaptation to acute exercise and exercise training and their influences on health indicators and disease outcomes completes the chapter.\n\nDefinitions, concepts, and models\n\nGenomes and genes\n\nThe blueprint of the human organism is specified in the genetic code in the form of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence of the 23 pairs of chromosomes found in every nucleated cell and the genes encoded in the mitochondrial DNA. The term human genome refers to the total genetic information in human cells. The human nuclear genome consists of 22 pairs of autosomes (non-sex-specific chromosomes) and two sex chromosomes. Individuals inherit half of their genome from their father (22 autosomes and either X or Y sex chromosome) and half from their mother (22 autosomes and X chromosome).\n\nA chromosome is constructed of two complementary strands of DNA. DNA molecules are large polypeptides in which the backbone of the molecule is composed of five-carbon sugar residues, deoxyribose. The adjacent deoxyribose molecules of a DNA strand are linked by covalent phosphodiester bonds. The genetic information in each chromosome is stored in a long string of the four DNA bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The order and number of the bases determine the information content of each gene. The DNA bases are attached to a deoxyribose molecule by a covalent bond with a carbon atom in the l′-position of the molecule. A unit formed by a deoxyribose sugar, an attached base, and a phosphate group forms the basic repeat unit of a DNA strand, i.e., the nucleotide. The complementary DNA strands are held together with relatively weak hydrogen bonds between the complementary nucleotides (C pairs with G, A with T). The linear structure of bases in the DNA strands is called the primary structure of the chromosome. The secondary structure of the chromosome arises when the two complementary strands of DNA twist to form a double helix.\n\nA typical gene consists of coding sequences (exons), noncoding regions (introns), and regulatory sequences located both before (5′-end; promoter region) and after (3′-untranslated region [UTR]) the coding regions of the gene. The number of exons is quite heterogeneous, with a range from one (e.g., intronless G-protein-coupled receptor genes) to several hundreds (e.g., titin gene with 363 exons). Introns may harbor several regulatory elements, such as alternative promoters, and splicing enhancers and suppressors. More recently, they were found to also contain small, noncoding RNA genes, such as microRNAs (miRNAs). DNA is constantly exposed to insults that cause damage, which is repaired by compensatory mechanisms that have specifically evolved for this purpose.\n\nA genome refers to the complement of all genes of an organism. Human genomics is the science that investigates the features and properties of the human genome. With the completion of the first draft of the sequence of the human genome in 2001 (160, 348), it became possible to begin to investigate in depth the architecture of the human genome. An excellent expose of the organization of the human genome can be found in Strachan and Read (313). It was confirmed that the length of the genome is of the order of 3 billion base pairs of DNA. Most importantly, since then, the definition of what is a gene has been evolving. The number of human protein coding genes is slightly more than 20,000 but with each of these sequences generally encoding more than one protein through alternative splicing, reverse strand transcripts, and other mechanisms. Bidirectional transcription is also recognized to be a common occurrence. Some evidence suggests that there may be on average as many as five encoded transcripts per gene sequence. The sequences of the human genome that actually encode proteins represent only about 2% of the DNA complement. Of great importance, it is now realized that there are thousands of genomic regions encoding “noncoding RNA transcripts.” These RNAs are involved in the regulation of gene expression and of translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (185). More than 6,000 small RNA transcripts have been identified thus far. They fall into several categories: small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), miRNA, and short interfering RNA (siRNA), plus a few others. Noncoding RNAs are viewed as major regulatory molecules involved in embryonic development, adaptation to cellular stresses, cancer, and a variety of biological processes. Their role in adaptation to exercise is just beginning to be examined.\n\nEpigenome\n\nAs alluded above, the double-stranded DNA of a chromosome is packaged very tightly. The basic unit of this packaging is the nucleosome, which is composed of 147 DNA base pairs wrapped around 8 histones, 2 each of the histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Each nucleosome is linked with the next one by a fragment of free DNA, stabilized by H1, the linker histone. A number of chemical modifications may alter the histone of nucleosomes, including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. Histone modification patterns can influence the conformation of chromatin and thus potentially transcription activity. Moreover, DNA can also be modified when a cytosine base is methylated in the 5′-position. Methylation occurs when cytosine is followed by a guanine, a sequence known as a CpG island. DNA methylation has been linked with the repression of transcription (although it can occur at a binding site for a repressor and thus enhance transcription). The methyl group constitutes a signal recognized by methyl CpG binding proteins, which play a role in chromatin structure and gene expression. Most of the CpG islands in the genome are methylated in the basal, natural state. However, other sites can be methylated, as occurs during development or with the repression of tumor suppressor genes and as is commonly seen in the inactivation of one X chromosome in the complement of cells of females.\n\nEpigenetic alterations do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. However, they are often transmitted from one cell to daughter cells at mitosis. Some of the epigenetic changes have also been shown to be passed from one generation to the next through the germ lines. It is widely accepted that epigenetic modifications can occur at all ages as a result of exposure to nutrients, cellular insults, stress, etc. Whether exercise or profound levels of inactivity are stimuli that can trigger epigenetic events remains to be established.\n\nGene expression\n\nSince all somatic cells of mammalian organisms have the same set of chromosomes and genes of the species, the various types of cells result primarily from differential expression of informative DNA sequences of these cells. The main control point of differential expression regulation from the perspective of this chapter is at the level of transcription, but it is important to recognize that differential expression can also occur at the translation phase. The latter depends on key cellular elements and especially siRNAs and miRNAs, with miRNA being the predominant endogenous small, noncoding RNA regulatory species. Binding sites are commonly found for these noncoding RNAs in the 3′-untranslated segments of mRNA molecules, where binding can lead to transcript degradation or translation block in vivo.\n\nHuman studies based on large-scale exploration of transcript abundance have indicated that most of the nuclear DNA is actually transcribed. Since most of the DNA is in so-called noncoding regions, the significance of this observation is not clear yet. Comparisons of transcript abundance across tissues are needed to understand how the transcriptome profile relates to tissue type and function. This is an area in which exercise–focused studies are warranted. Chromatin conformation at sites of interest is a key determinant of transcription. Transcription requires at the site of initiation a large complex of tissue-specific transcription factors plus a number of activator or repressor elements. Transcription activity is also modulated by proteins that bind to specific DNA enhancing or repressing sequence motifs that can be at some distance from the initiation site. The key transcription molecule for peptide-encoding sequences and small, noncoding RNAs that needs to access the targeted DNA region and be activated is RNA polymerase II in humans.\n\nGene expression being so dependent on chromatin state, it is easy to see that epigenomic events altering DNA methylation levels and histone chemistry can have a strong influence on the transcription of a given gene or noncoding sequence. Again, this is a cutting-edge area of cellular biology that needs to be thoroughly investigated for the potential role of activity and inactivity.\n\nMitochondrial genome\n\nA mitochondrion carries a simple circular DNA sequence of 16,569 DNA pairs that encode 37 genes, 13 of them coding for peptides of the oxidative phosphorylation system, 2 for mitochondrial ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) molecules, and 22 producing mitochondrial transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Mitochondrial DNA is derived from the mother and is characterized by cytoplasmic inheritance. The nuclear-encoded POLRMT gene serves as the RNA polymerase for mitochondrial DNA. Most of the proteins necessary for mitochondrial structure and function are encoded in the nuclear DNA and are exported to the mitochondria. Further, recent evidence suggests that several nuclear-encoded mRNAs are translated into protein in the mitochondria. Cells can contain thousands of mitochondrial DNA molecules. Mitochondrial DNA exhibits a higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA. The latter phenomenon has important consequences for the aging process and for disease risks, particularly in tissues that have a high oxidative capacity. However, in somatic cells, mutant mitochondrial DNA molecules generally cohabit with perfectly normal DNA molecules, a phenomenon known as heteroplasmy. The traits or diseases associated with defects in mitochondrial DNA may show variable penetrance depending on the population of mutated DNA relative to the normal DNA molecules in affected cells and tissues.\n\nGenetics and inheritance\n\nIf genomics is the science of the characteristics of the genome, genetics is the science focused on the transmission of traits or phenotypes across generations. In the simplest situation, the observed trait is determined by a single gene with two alleles. In this case, the pattern of inheritance can be recognized in a pedigree analysis, is defined as Mendelian, and can be specified as recessive, dominant, or codominant. Whether the penetrance of the gene is variable and is associated with the sex of the parent or the offspring or some other characteristic can also generally be defined. Examples of such traits can be found in blood serology and in tissue antigenic properties. However, traits of interest to exercise biologists are rarely of this type. They tend to be influenced by many genes and are referred to as quantitative and polygenic phenotypes.\n\nQuantitative traits such as total adiposity, heart size, or maximal oxygen uptake exhibit large interindividual differences. This human variation persists even if we divide subjects into more homogeneous groups based on sex, age, and body mass. The distribution of phenotype scores often approximates a normal Gaussian curve, but it can also be skewed. Given this large heterogeneity, it is a challenge to define the pattern of inheritance, as the effects of single genes are typically not recognizable. The study of these quantitative traits has given rise to the field of genetic epidemiology, whose aim is to define the contribution of genetic factors to human biological and behavioral traits and to specify the inheritance patterns. Genetic epidemiology has played a key role in providing evidence for a role of genetic differences in exercise-related phenotypes and in providing the foundation for ongoing studies at the molecular level. The next section reviews the methods used and the evidence obtained from genetic epidemiology approaches over the past few decades.\n\nAs progress is being made in defining the genetic anatomy of complex human traits, such as those of interest to exercise physiologists, it is becoming obvious that a major challenge is and will continue to be understanding what is driving the association between genotype and phenotype. It is clear that knowing one’s genotype is not sufficient to explain entirely the variation in a trait, as there are many modulating variables including epigenomic status, cellular and tissue energy and nutrient levels, role of alternate or compensatory pathways, and other contributing factors.\n\nEvidence from genetic epidemiology\n\nTwo topics are discussed in this section. First, we briefly review the methods commonly used to determine whether a quantitative exercise-related trait has a genetic component significantly different from the null. Second, we summarize the evidence for the presence of a significant genetic variance for a number of traits of interest to exercise biologists.\n\nMethods\n\nThe first question to address when dealing with quantitative traits of relevance to exercise biology is whether a phenotype is influenced by genetic differences at all. In rodent models, comparisons among strains and various breeding strategies between inbred or outbred strains have been used successfully to quantify the magnitude of the genetic effect in a trait variance or to select for a particular trait, assuming that there is a significant additive genetic component.\n\nIn humans, statistical genetic approaches have been traditionally used to investigate the contribution of genetic determinants to quantitative phenotypes and to test hypotheses regarding a variety of models of inheritance. In this regard, designs encompassing monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, nuclear families, and/or families with adopted children have been the most commonly used. Genetic epidemiology has traditionally asked a series of interrelated questions that were designed to set the stage for molecular and gene-based studies.\n\nFamilial aggregation\n\nA classical first step is to establish whether or not a quantitative trait aggregates in families. This is usually achieved by comparing the variance between families for a given trait to the variance among family members. A significantly higher between-family than within-family variance (significant Fratio) suggests that individuals of the same family are more similar than individuals of different families, which in turn suggests familial resemblance.\n\nThe presence of familial aggregation for a discrete trait or a disease can be quantified by the occurrence within families of cases (affected or exhibiting a high or a low level of a trait) as compared to families of controls (unaffected or normal level of a trait, etc.) or the population at large. If a reliable estimate of the trait prevalence in the general population is available, the familial aggregation (familial risk) of a discrete trait can be expressed by the lambda coefficient:\n\nλR = P(A∣R)/P(A),\n\nwhere P(A) is the population prevalence of the trait, and P(A|R) is the trait prevalence among relatives of an affected proband (268). For quantitative traits, the lambda coefficient is defined as:\n\nλR(h, l) = PR(l∣h)/P(l),\n\nwhere P(l) is the probability that a randomly selected person in the general population has a trait value in the lth segment of the trait distribution, and PR(l|h) is the probability that a person has a trait value in the lth segment given that a relative of type R has a trait value in the hth segment (103). For instance, using this approach, familial risk ratios for physical fitness phenotypes have been reported for a stratified sample of the Canadian population (140).\n\nHeritability level\n\nIf a trait aggregates in families, the next step is to quantify the estimated contribution of genetic factors to the familial aggregation. The genetic analysis of multifactorial phenotypes is based on a partitioning of the total phenotypic variance (VP) into genetic and environmental components as follows:\n\nVP = VG + VC + VE\n\nwhere VG is the genetic component of the variance, VC is the common (shared) environmental variance, and VE is the residual or non-shared environmental variance. These variance components can be further partitioned to include specific components such as gene-by-environment interaction (GxE), gene-by-gene interactions, epistasis, or dominance deviations. The heritability (h2) of the trait is defined as the proportion of total phenotypic variance explained by the genetic factors (h2 = VG/VP).\n\nThe components of variance can be estimated from phenotypic covariance between pairs of relatives. The expected additive genetic, dominance genetic, and shared environmental covariances for different types of relatives are summarized in . The heritability estimates are based on comparisons of phenotypic similarities between pairs of relatives with different levels of biological relatedness. For example, biological siblings, who share about 50% of their genes identical by descent (IBD), should be phenotypically more similar than their parents (biologically unrelated individuals) if genetic factors contribute to the trait of interest. Likewise, a greater phenotypic resemblance between MZ twins (100% of genetic variation IBD) than between DZ twins (50% of genetic variation IBD) suggests a genetic contribution to the phenotype.\n\nTable 1\n\nTypes of relativesCoefficient for Additive geneticDominanceShared environmentSpouse-spouse001Parent-child (living together)1/201Full sibs (living together)1/21/41Full sibs (living apart)1/21/40Half sibs (living together)1/401Half sibs (living apart)1/400Aunt/uncle-niece/nephew1/400First cousins (living apart)1/800Dbl. first cousins (living apart)1/41/160DZ twins (living together)1/21/41MZ twins (living together)111\n\nThe quantification of the heritability of complex, multifactorial traits requires data on relatives with different degrees of relatedness. The study designs fall into one of the following broad categories: twin studies, adoption studies, and family studies.\n\nTwin studies\n\nThe classical twin design compares the resemblance of MZ to DZ twins. MZ twins are considered genetically identical since they originate from the division of a single fertilized egg (one zygote), while DZ twins grow from two independent fertilization events and share only about one-half of their genes IBD. In this design, any difference in the resemblance between MZ and DZ twin pairs is ascribed to genetic factors, assuming that both types of twins are exposed to similar environmental conditions. This assumption is the most critical, is seldom met, and represents a major limitation of the twin method.\n\nThe analysis of twin data was traditionally based on analysis of variance (ANOVA). If genetic factors are involved in determining the phenotype under study, the within-pair variance will be lower for MZ twins than for DZ twins. The F ratio of the ANOVA was thus used to test for the presence of a genetic effect. Several methods have been proposed to estimate heritability from twin data, but the most widely used in the past was from twice the difference between the MZ and DZ intraclass correlations:\n\nh2 = 2[rMZ - rDZ].\n\nNowadays, twin data are analyzed with more complex modeling and variance decomposition methods. The total phenotypic variance (VP) is decomposed into genetic (VG), shared environmental (VC), and unique environmental (VE) components, and the genetic heritability is defined as the proportion of total phenotypic variance explained by the genetic component (VG/VP). An example of a basic univariate path model to estimate the variance components is shown in . The shared environmental component is assumed to affect phenotypic covariance similarly in both types of twins, whereas the effect of the genetic component on covariance is two times greater in MZ twins as compared to DZ pairs. Hypotheses about genetic and nongenetic effects can be tested using a number of structural equation modeling-based software packages that have been developed to deal specifically with twin data and continuous or discrete traits, e.g., LISREL (55) and MX (211).\n\nSeveral extensions of the classical twin method can be used to assess genetic and environmental sources of variation in a quantitative phenotype. One extension requires data on the spouses and offspring of adult twins, the so-called twin-family method. The twin-family method provides more information on environmental sources of variance and on the contribution of assortative mating to familial resemblance. Another useful strategy is to compare twins discordant for exposure to a factor in the environment. This is known as the co-twin control method. It is a useful design to control for host characteristics like age, sex, and genetic background. Of considerable interest for the study of physiological and metabolic phenotypes is the comparison of MZ twins discordant for a relevant trait. For instance, the design has been used for twins discordant for BMI to study a number of physiological, metabolic, and clinical traits (205, 238–242, 270, 271).\n\nAlthough such pairs are rare, twins reared apart have also been used to assess the heritability of a trait. This design requires twins to have been separated shortly after birth and reared in different circumstances. Needless to say, these conditions are seldom met today. Few of the “reared apart” observational studies have been performed with traits of relevance to physiology, metabolism, or exercise.\n\nMZ and DZ twin designs have been helpful in the effort to understand whether a trait exhibited a genetic component. However, there are several limitations inherent to the various twin designs. Twins share prenatal as well as postnatal environments to a unique extent, and they may not be representative of the population at large. The heritability coefficient is a ratio of variances and is, therefore, dependent on fluctuations in either the numerator or the denominator. If a given sample of twins is characterized by less heterogeneity than what is commonly observed in the population, the denominator may be artificially diminished, leading to an inflated heritability estimate. It is also plausible that twins, especially MZ pairs, may have a more similar epigenomic signature as a result of the shared intrauterine environmental conditions, resulting in a higher phenotypic resemblance over and above the genetic covariation.\n\nAdoption studies\n\nThe study of adopted children and their foster and biological parents is a powerful design to assess genetic heritability as well as cultural transmission. The basic principle is that the resemblance between an adopted child and members of his/her biological family can be attributed largely to the genes they share in common, while the resemblance between an adopted child and his/her adoptive family is due primarily to shared environmental conditions (complete adoption design). If data on the biological parents of an adopted offspring are not available, the study is known as a partial adoption design. In the partial adoption design, the resemblance between foster parents and biological and adopted siblings living in the same family environment is compared. For example, the absence of a significant correlation between adoptive parents and their adopted children combined with a significant correlation between the same parents and their biological children would suggest that the trait is more influenced by genetic factors than by the family environment.\n\nAdoption studies offer an attractive alternative to assess heritability, but they also have limitations. Age at adoption is always a critical issue: adoption should ideally have taken place shortly after birth. An assumption underlying the adoption design is that there should not be any selective placement of adoptees. The latter occurs when adoption agencies match adoptive parents and biological parents on a variety of characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status, complexion). In addition, it is assumed that adoptive families represent an unbiased sample of the population. These three requirements are seldom met in adoption studies. This design has not been used to any extent for traits of interest to physiology and metabolism.\n\nFamily studies\n\nFamily studies, including nuclear families (parents and their offspring) and extended pedigrees (grandparents, parents, offspring, cousins, uncles/aunts, etc.), are the most widely used designs to investigate the genetic basis of quantitative phenotypes. One major advantage is that families are typically more representative of the general population than sets of relatives like twins or adoptees. However, it is important to realize that data on nuclear families alone do not allow for the precise quantification of the relative contribution of genetic and shared environmental components of a trait variance. They can be used to assess only overall “familiality”, i.e., the fraction of phenotypic variance attributable to the combined effects of all familial influences. This is often defined as the maximal heritability.\n\nThe estimation of heritability from nuclear family data is based on fitting various familial correlation models. In addition to a full model, which includes all available familial correlations, several reduced models are tested. The reduced models test specific null hypotheses by restricting some of the covariances (e.g., no sibling resemblance, no spouse resemblance, no sex differences in parents or offspring). The most parsimonious model (or a combination of models) is selected based on the Akaike’s Information Criterion (4) and the familial correlations (r) from this model are used to estimate the maximal heritability of the trait. A commonly used equation to calculate heritabilities (h2) in nuclear family data is:\n\nh2 = (rsibling + rparent-offspring)(1 + rspouse)/(1 + rspouse + 2rspouserparent-offspring)\n\nIn summary, even though we have a number of relevant study designs to undertake the delineation of the genetic and shared environmental components of a trait variance, none of these methods is completely satisfactory. They all require that several key assumptions be made and those are seldom met in practice. Despite their obvious limitations, they remain useful to address the central question: is there a significant component to the variance in a given trait? Moreover, it is always important to remember that these methods are used only for the relative quantification of the variance components from a population perspective. They should never be used to infer about the quantitative importance of the genetic component for a trait in a given individual. Of great importance also is the fact that estimates of heritability can vary among populations depending on genetic and environmental circumstances. Finally, at this time, we cannot define the exact role played by epigenetic signatures in the heritability estimates.\n\nOverview of genetic epidemiology findings for relevant traits\n\nWhat is the evidence for a genetic contribution to a number of morphological, physiological, and metabolic traits that are of importance to exercise biology? There are published human data for cardiorespiratory fitness and selected cardiovascular and skeletal muscle phenotypes, and they are briefly reviewed here.\n\nEndurance performance phenotypes\n\nRodent models support the hypothesis that there is a significant genetic component to endurance performance. In one study, 6 untrained rats of each sex from 11 different inbred strains were tested for maximal running capacity on a treadmill (20). It was found that Copenhagen (COP) rats were the lowest performers while the DA rats were the best runners based on duration of the run, distance run, and vertical work performed. There was a 2.5-fold difference between the COP and DA strains. These observations are depicted in for male and female performance scores combined. The heritability of endurance performance was estimated at 50% in these untrained rodents. Subsequently, selective breeding for three successive generations mating lowest performing pairs versus highest performing pairs resulted in divergent lines for endurance performance; in a run test to exhaustion, the high-performance line averaged 659 m of running distance (SD=36 m) and the low-performance line 388 m (SD=28 m) (150). It was estimated that 39% of the variation in running performance between the high and low lines was determined by genetic differences.\n\nThese results are concordant with those reported in mice by Meek et al. (193) and Kelly et al. (146). Mice bred for high voluntary wheel activity run about 3-fold more revolutions per day compared to unselected control lines. In contrast to the study paradigm of Britton and Koch, in which the selection of rats is based on an imposed endurance run, the mice selection in these studies pioneered by Garland and Pomp is dependent on voluntary wheel running.\n\nMaximal oxygen uptake\n\nThe heritability of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) has been computed from family and twin studies. summarizes intraclass correlations in DZ and MZ twins from several studies. These studies are quite heterogeneous, with differences in test protocol, number of twin pairs, age or sex distributions, and means or variances between twin types. The intraclass correlations for MZ twins ranged from about 0.6 to 0.9, whereas correlations for DZ twins with one exception ranged from 0.3 to 0.5. The largest of the twin studies (316) was derived from a population-based twin panel of conscripts. The data were based on predicted VO2max values, which were subsequently transformed to categorical scores, from low to high maximal aerobic power, but intraclass correlations for the categorical scores were similar to those found in other twin studies (316). Globally, these twin studies have yielded heritability estimates ranging from 25% to 65%, with some outliers.\n\nTable 2\n\nSourceN Pairs CohortTestMZDZMZDZKlissouras (1971)1510MalesVO2max/kg0.910.44Klissouras et al (1973)2316Males and femalesVO2max/kg0.950.36Bouchard et al (1986a)5333Males and femalesVO2max/kg0.710.51Fagard et al (1991)2919MalesVO2max/kg0.770.04Maes et al (1993)4150Males and femalesVO2max/kg0.850.56Sundet et al (1994)436622MalesVO2max/kg\n\nPredictedA)0.620.29Maes et al (1996)436110-year-old boys and girlsVO2maxB)0.750.32\n\nVO2max in the sedentary subjects is characterized by a significant familial resemblance, as demonstrated by several studies (164, 173, 197). The most comprehensive of these is the HERITAGE Family Study in which two cycle ergometer VO2max tests were performed on separate days in parents and their adult offspring from sedentary families of Caucasian descent (33). An F ratio of 2.72 was found when comparing the between-family variance to the within-family variance for VO2max in the sedentary state adjusted for age, sex, body mass, and body composition ( ). The concept of family lines with low and high VO2max phenotypes in the sedentary state is clearly demonstrated by the data shown in the figure. The intraclass coefficient for the familial resemblance was 0.41 (33). Maximum likelihood estimation of familial correlations (spouse, four parent-offspring, and three sibling correlations) revealed a maximal heritability of 51% for VO2max adjusted for age, sex, body mass, fat-free mass, and fat mass. However, the significant spouse correlation suggested that the genetic heritability was lower and was estimated to be at about 47% (33).\n\nInterestingly, VO2max adjusted for body mass differed markedly among lines selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running and unselected control mice. For instance, after generation 36 of selective breeding, the high-wheel-running mice achieved a VO2max 24% higher than control mice under normoxic conditions (261, 262). Comparable differences were also observed under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions.\n\nSubmaximal exercise capacity\n\nIn 1630 subjects from 375 families of the Quebec Family Study (QFS), submaximal exercise capacity was measured on a cycle ergometer as the power output at a heart rate (HR) of 150 beats per minute (bpm) and expressed per kilogram of body weight (PWC150/kg) (37). The same trait was obtained in the Canada Fitness Survey (CFS) in which PWC150/kg was estimated from a progressive step test in more than 15,000 subjects from thousands of households representing the Canadian population. In both studies, it was found that submaximal exercise capacity was characterized by significant familial resemblance (37, 232, 233). However, this familial resemblance was apparent not only among biological relatives, but also among spouses and relatives by adoption, suggesting the contribution of both genetic and common familial environments. The estimates of heritability for submaximal exercise capacity were quite similar in both populations, with values of 22% in QFS (233) and 28% in CFS (232). These observations were concordant with the estimates of familial risk ratios in the CFS sample, in which the ratio for high values (exceeding the 95th percentile of the distribution) of PWC150 reached 1.63 and 1.81 for spouses and first-degree relatives, respectively (140).\n\nFamilial aggregation for several indicators of submaximal exercise capacity was also investigated in the HERITAGE Family Study (33, 90, 230). Phenotypes included VO2 at an absolute power output of 50 watts (VO250W), VO2 at relative power outputs equivalent to 60% and 80% of subjects’ VO2max, and also VO2 at the ventilatory threshold (VO2vt). The heritability estimates ranged between 29% and 70% for submaximal aerobic performance and reached 58% for VO2vt.\n\nCardiac performance phenotypes\n\nThe ability to deliver oxygen to the active tissues is thought to be a major determinant of endurance performance. For instance, when comparing 11 inbred strains of rats, the highest performing DA line had also the highest cardiac output (Q) while the COP rats that ran for the shortest distance had the lowest Q per minute. The correlation between average distance run and Q per minute among the 11 strains reached 0.868, corresponding to a common variance of about 75% (20). Even though selection for high or low endurance performance was primarily associated with a greater oxygen uptake and utilization by skeletal muscle in the high-endurance line in the early generations (119), which correlated with skeletal muscle capillarity and enzyme activities at markers of oxidative metabolism (127), the capacity to deliver oxygen to the exercising muscle became progressively more important. Thus, at generation 15, the high-endurance line exhibited a VO2max normalized for body weight 50% higher than the low-performance line (98). This higher VO2max in the high-performer line was accompanied by a 41% higher Q per minute and a 48% higher stroke volume (SV) under normoxic conditions than the low-performing animals. In humans, endurance performance defined as total work output over 90 minutes of exercise correlates only weakly with VO2max (174, 357), suggesting that peripheral adaptations are very important.\n\nLarger SV and Q are commonly associated with larger heart volume and left ventricular (LV) mass. A few studies performed in humans have investigated the question of a genetic component to LV structure adjusted for body mass. In one experiment, 32 MZ and 21 DZ pairs of healthy males were studied for echographic heart dimensions (24). The phenotypic variance was partitioned into genetic, shared, and non-shared environmental components using a defined path analysis model with data adjusted for age and body mass. All heart structures, except LV internal diameter, were significantly influenced by genetic factors, with heritability estimates ranging from 29% to 68%. The strong correlation between body size and heart size suggests that some of the covariation between these two variables could be accounted for by common genetic factors. This issue was addressed in a bivariate genetic analysis of LV mass and body mass using a larger sample of 147 MZ and 107 DZ twin pairs of both sexes (349). The heritability of adjusted LV mass reached 39% in males and 59% in females, figures that are quite concordant with the findings of Bielen and collaborators. Bivariate genetic analyses showed that the correlation between LV mass and body mass was almost entirely of genetic origin, 90% being attributed to common genes (349). These studies suggest that genetic factors are important in determining cardiac dimensions under resting conditions. In a study of 21 MZ and 12 DZ twin pairs, the inheritance of cardiac changes during submaximal supine cycle exercise at a fixed HR of 110 bpm was considered (25). The increases in LV internal diameter and fractional shortening in response to exercise were characterized by significant genetic effects of 24% and 47%, respectively.\n\nIn the HERITAGE Family Study, subjects completed two submaximal exercise tests at 50 W and at 60% of the untrained VO2max both prior to and after completing a 20-week endurance training protocol. Steady-state SV and Q were measured twice during each test. Submaximal exercise SV and Q per minute were characterized by a significant familial aggregation in the sedentary state. Maximal heritabilities reached 40% and 42% for SV and Q at 50 W and were 46% for both phenotypes at 60% VO2max (10).\n\nSteady-state HR during submaximal exercise at a workload of 50 W (HR50) also was measured using an electrocardiograph twice before and twice after a 20-week endurance training protocol in HERITAGE. The reproducibility of the HR50 measurements was high, with baseline and post-training coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.6% and 4.6% and intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficients for repeated measures of 0.91 and 0.89, respectively. The average reduction in HR50 was 12 bpm (8.9%), with a standard deviation of 10.1 (p<0.0001). There were marked interindividual differences in the ΔHR50, ranging from a reduction of 44 bpm to an increase of 13 bpm. The strongest predictors of ΔHR50 were baseline HR50 (R2=33%) and familial aggregation (h2=34%) (9). Furthermore, complex segregation analysis supported the hypothesis of a major dominant gene effect on ΔHR50 in the same set of families (8). These observations support the hypothesis that genetic factors are involved in ΔHR50 regulation.\n\nA similar picture emerged for the changes in exercise blood pressure in response to exercise training. Steady-state systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) during submaximal exercise at a workload of 50 W (SBP50 and DBP50) was measured twice (on different days) before and twice (on different days) after completing 20 weeks of endurance training using an automatic device (Colin STBP-780). Pulse pressure (PP) was calculated as a difference between SBP and DBP (PP50=SBP50–DBP50). The average training-induced reductions in SBP50 and PP50 were 7.0 mm Hg SD=11.4 mm Hg) and 4.5 mm Hg (SD=11.6 mm Hg), respectively. Both ΔSBP50 and ΔPP50 showed large interindividual differences, with the changes ranging from decreases of as much as 40 to 45 mmHg to increases of the order of 10 to 15 mmHg. The strongest predictors of the training responses were baseline phenotype level (R2=30%) and familial aggregation (h2= 22%) (9).\n\nIn the aggregate, these studies indicate that there is a significant genetic component to the interindividual differences in cardiac dimensions, resting and exercise SV, and Q per minute in the untrained state. A significant genetic effect is also observed in HR, blood pressure, SV, and Q changes during submaximal exercise intensities in response to exercise training.\n\nSkeletal muscle phenotypes\n\nThere is compelling evidence to the effect that there is a significant genetic component to human variation in skeletal muscle strength and endurance [see reviews by (22, 23, 38, 229)]. In the CFS, muscular performance was measured in a sample of 13,804 subjects as follows: muscular endurance was assessed by measuring the maximum number of sit-ups performed in 60 s and the number of push-ups completed without time limit, while muscular strength was assessed by measuring handgrip strength. Perusse and colleagues reported heritability estimates of 37% for sit-ups, 44% for push-ups, and 37% for grip strength (232). In the same population, the familial risk ratios for first-degree relatives of individuals exceeding the 95th percentile of the distribution were 3.98 for muscular endurance and 3.16 for muscular strength, while the corresponding values for spouses were 2.63 and 2.38 (140). The higher risk ratios for first-degree relatives compared to spouses suggest strong contributions of genetic factors. Moreover, 7-year changes in these muscular fitness phenotypes were also investigated using data from the 1981 CFS and a follow-up examination of the same individuals conducted in 1988 (139). It was found that 54% to 63% of the variance in the 7-year changes in muscular strength and endurance could be accounted for by family lines. The heritability levels for the 7-year changes reached 41% for sit-ups, 52% for push-ups, and 32% for grip strength (139).\n\nThe familial aggregation of muscular endurance and muscular strength was also investigated in the QFS, with heritability estimates of 21% for muscular endurance and 30% for muscular strength (232, 233). In a sample of 748 young male siblings from 335 Belgian families, the genetic and shared environmental variance accounted for 63% to 87% of the variance in concentric strength measures of knee, trunk, and elbow, while it reached as high as 82% to 96% for isometric strength measures (129). Elbow flexion, hand grip, and knee extension strength tests were performed in a large sample of siblings (154,970 sibling pairs), DZ twins (1,864 pairs), and MZ twins (1,582 pairs), and the study revealed that more than 50% of the variability in strength performance could be accounted for by additive genetic factors (292).\n\nIn large samples of adults, skeletal muscle fiber type distribution is a significant determinant of endurance performance. Human variation in the proportion of a given fiber type is strikingly large, even among sedentary individuals, as illustrated in . Tissue sampling variation and laboratory error variance are critical issues to consider when quantifying the importance of genetic differences using human muscle biopsy material. For instance, repeated biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle in sedentary adults indicate that sampling variability and technical error together account for about 15% of the variance in the proportion of type I muscle fibers (293, 295). Differences between brothers or sisters of MZ pairs in the percentage of type I fibers provide critical information on the magnitude of the contribution of nongenetic factors. In one such study, the mean difference in percentage of type I fibers between a member of a MZ pair and his/her co-twin reached 9.5 ± 6.9% in 40 pairs of MZ twins (293). The difference was less than 6% in 16 pairs but ranged from 18% to 23% in 8 other pairs. It is remarkable that about 25% of sedentary adult Caucasians exhibit quite low (35% or less) or quite high (65% or more) proportions of skeletal muscle type I fibers in the vastus lateralis, which remains the most studied skeletal muscle in humans. Genetic variation has undoubtedly something to do with this extensive human heterogeneity, but it is likely not the only cause.\n\nThese results combined with those on pairs of DZ twins and regular brothers (36, 295) have led to the conclusion that a genetic component accounts for about 45% of variance in the proportion of type I muscle fibers in humans (293). A summary of genetic, environmental, and methodological sources of variation in the proportion of type I fibers in human skeletal muscle is illustrated in . Fiber type distributions were also examined in 78 sedentary subjects from 19 families of the HERITAGE Family Study (265). The results suggested an even weaker genetic component than observed in prior twin-based studies. For instance, no evidence was found for a genetic contribution to the proportion of the various fiber types, although a trend was observed for the proportion of type I fibers. However, significant familial aggregation was found in the same study for the number of capillaries around fiber types I and IIA. To-date, the central question is not satisfactorily answered: what are the factors driving the wide range of fiber type distributions among adults, and what is the contribution of genetic and epigenetic differences?\n\nThere are considerable interindividual differences in the enzymatic activity profile as assayed in skeletal muscle homogenates. One can distinguish individuals with high or low activity levels of enzymes associated with the catabolism of different substrates in the skeletal muscle among healthy sedentary or moderately active individuals of both sexes (294). Even though several factors can potentially contribute to these interindividual differences, it is likely that the genotype plays a role in determining gene transcription and mRNA translation influencing the amount of protein for several key skeletal muscle enzymes.\n\nStudies of MZ (n=35) and DZ (n=26) twin pairs of both sexes and pairs of biological brothers (n=32) suggested that there was a significant genetic effect for variation in skeletal muscle enzyme maximal activities (42). There was significant within-pair resemblance in MZ twins for all skeletal muscle enzyme activities (r=0.30 to 0.68), but the correlation patterns for DZ twins and brothers were more supportive of a weaker genetic component. After adjusting for variation in age and sex, genetic factors were responsible for about 25% to 50% of the total phenotypic variation in the activities of the regulatory enzymes of the glycolytic (phosphofructokinase, PFK) and citric acid cycle (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, OGDH) pathways and in the ratio of glycolytic to oxidative activities (PFK/OGDH ratio) (42). Results from the HERITAGE Family Study based on biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle as defined above confirmed that there was significant familial aggregation for activities of enzymes of the glycolytic and oxidative pathways (256, 265).\n\nResponsiveness to exercise training\n\nThe concept of heterogeneity in the response to standardized exercise programs was first introduced in the early 1980s (30). In a series of carefully controlled and standardized exercise training studies conducted with young and healthy adult volunteers, it was shown that individual differences in training-induced changes in several physical performance and health-related fitness phenotypes were large, with the range between low and high responders reaching several folds (30, 31, 34, 36, 174). This phenomenon was subsequently confirmed in other laboratories.\n\nLater, the most extensive data on human variation in trainability came from the HERITAGE Family Study, in which healthy but sedentary subjects followed a highly standardized, well-controlled, laboratory-based endurance-training program for 20 weeks. The average increase in VO2max was 384 mL of oxygen, with a standard deviation of 202. The training responses varied from no change to increases of more than 1,000 mL of oxygen per minute (32, 40). The distribution of VO2max response adjusted for age, sex, and baseline VO2max is depicted in . This high degree of heterogeneity in responsiveness to a fully standardized exercise program in the HERITAGE Family Study was not accounted for by baseline level, age, gender, or ethnic differences. These data underline the notion that the effects of endurance training on cardiovascular and other relevant traits should be evaluated not only in terms of mean changes, but also in terms of response heterogeneity.\n\nA similar picture emerged for training-induced changes in SV, Q, and skeletal muscle traits. For instance, in the HERITAGE Family Study, at the same absolute power output (50 W), HR and Q decreased significantly (9.5% and 5%, respectively), whereas SV increased by 4% after 20 weeks of endurance training. At 60% VO2max, HR decreased 3.1%, while Q and SV increased 7.3% and 10.8%, respectively (370, 371). There were marked interindividual differences in all these training-induced changes, as revealed by the magnitude of the standard deviations for the training-induced changes and as illustrated in .\n\nA similar pattern of variation in training responses was observed for other phenotypes, including insulin and plasma lipid levels, submaximal exercise HR, and blood pressure (44, 163, 371). For example, SBP and DBP measured during steady-state submaximal (50 W) exercise decreased, on average, by 7 and 3.5 mmHg, respectively, in response to exercise training (371). However, the responses varied from marked decreases (SBP>25 mmHg and DBP>12 mmHg) to no changes or, in some cases, even to slight increases (40, 371). Similar heterogeneity in responsiveness to exercise training has been reported also in other populations (116, 151). Notably, wide variation in skeletal muscle metabolic response (as defined by intramuscular ΔPCr) is observed following supervised exercise training, and such variation occurs in a manner unrelated to the gains in VO2max (357).\n\nTwo questions come to mind as a result of the observations such as those depicted in and . Are the high and low responses to regular exercise characterized by significant familial aggregation, i.e., are there families with mainly low responders and others in which all family members show significant improvements? Is individual variability a normal biological phenomenon reflecting genetic diversity?\n\nOf relevance to the first question are the early studies that we undertook with MZ twins. The VO2max response to standardized training programs showed six to nine times more variance between genotypes (between pairs of twins) than within genotypes (within pairs of twins) based on the findings of three independent studies (34, 110, 246). Thus, gains in absolute VO2max were much more heterogeneous between pairs of twins than within pairs of twins. The results of one such study are summarized in . The MZ twins exercised for 20 weeks using a standardized and demanding endurance training program (34, 246).\n\nThese observations were corroborated by the results of the HERITAGE Family Study. The increase in VO2max in 481 individuals from 99 two-generation families of Whites showed 2.6 times more variance between families than within families, and the model-fitting analytical procedure yielded a maximal heritability estimate of 47% (32). Thus the extraordinary heterogeneity observed for the gains in VO2max among adults is not random and is characterized by a strong familial aggregation ( ). These observations support the notion that individual variability is a normal biological phenomenon, which may largely reflect genetic diversity (31, 40).\n\nIn addition to VO2max, the heritability of training-induced changes in several other phenotypes, such as submaximal aerobic performance, resting and submaximal exercise blood pressure, HR, SV, and Q, as well as skeletal muscle characteristics, have all been investigated in the HERITAGE Family Study. Submaximal exercise SV and Q were characterized by a significant familial aggregation in response to endurance training. The between-family variation in age, sex, body surface area, and baseline phenotype level-adjusted SV and Q training responses at 50 W were 1.5 to 2.2 times greater than the within-family variation. The maximal heritability estimates were 29% and 38% for SV and Q training responses at 50 W and 24% and 30% for the training-induced changes in SV and Q at 60% of VO2max (10).\n\nTwo experimental studies of the responses of young adult MZ twins to relevant training programs provide some insights into potential genotypic contributions to the skeletal muscle training response. The studies included male and female MZ twins, and there were no sex differences in training-related gains. The effects of high-intensity, intermittent training are summarized in . The training program involved 15 weeks of both continuous and interval cycle ergometer work in 12 pairs of MZ twins of both sexes. Program-related changes in fiber type proportions showed no significant within-pair resemblance. However, about 50% to 60% of the response of hexokinase (HK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), OGDH, and the PFK/OGDH ratio to the intermittent training program was genotype-associated, while about 80% of the creatine kinase (CK) training response appeared to be determined by the genotype (36) as inferred from the within-pair resemblance in response levels.\n\nTable 3\n\nEnzymeBefore training mean ± SDAfter training mean ± SDGenotype-training interaction F ratioIntrapair resemblance in responseCK237.0 ± 48278.0 ± 989.8**0.82HK1.3 ± 0.41.41 ± 0.363.8*0.59PFK152.0 ± 27155.0 ± 522.20.38LDH239.0 ± 122201.0 ± 934.6**0.64MDH220.0 ± 56246.0 ± 44*3.0*0.50HADH3.7 ± 1.25.03 ± 1.55**1.30.15OGDH0.7 ± 0.21.04 ± 0.23**3.0*0.50PFK/OGDH ratio558.0 ± 173231.0 ± 1094.5**0.64\n\nThe second study followed six pairs of young adult MZ twins (three male and three female) through 15 weeks of endurance training on a cycle ergometer (110). Genotype-training interactions were evaluated for the proportion of muscle fibers and several enzymes after 7 and 15 weeks of training. There were no significant changes in the proportions of type I and type IIA and IIB fibers. Changes in skeletal muscle enzyme activities during the first half of training were characterized by weak within-pair resemblance. However, changes in the activities of PFK, MDH, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HADH), and OGDH across the whole 15 weeks were characterized by much more significant within-pair resemblance. This suggests that early in the program, adaptation to endurance training may be under less stringent genetic control; however, as training continues and as one gets closer to the maximal trainability zone, the response becomes more genotype dependent. Taken together, these two studies provide strong support for the notion that genetic variation accounts for some of the heterogeneity in skeletal muscle metabolic responses to exercise-training.\n\nTraining-induced changes in muscle enzyme activities were also investigated in the HERITAGE Family Study (256, 265). Results confirmed that there was consistent familial resemblance for the training responses in activities of marker enzymes of the glycolytic and oxidative pathways ( ). In contrast, no evidence for familial aggregation was found for the changes in capillary density, even though capillarity increased around all fiber types in response to 20 weeks of endurance training. The issue of microvascular adaptation to regular exercise and the role played by genetic and epigenetic factors deserve further investigation.\n\nTable 4\n\nPhenotypePretraining Training Response NFpNFpPCr Metabolism CK786.25<0.0001763.97<0.0001Glycolysis PHOS786.85<0.0001752.140.0169 HK781.690.069754.01<0.0001 PFK783.83<0.0001761.850.043 GAPDH785.62<0.0001762.390.0072Oxidative metabolism CPT782.550.0039752.470.0058 HADH783.80<0.0001762.130.017 CS781.660.076762.730.0023 COX783.030.0008762.070.0213\n\nThe human heterogeneity described in this section is an example of normal biological diversity. It is observed in all populations that have been studied thus far. This degree of heterogeneity in the ability to adapt to regular exercise is well beyond measurement error and day-to-day fluctuation and is potentially very informative in terms of the adaptive physiological and metabolic mechanisms involved.\n\nIdentifying genes, sequence variants, and other genomic markers\n\nThe identification of genes and sequence variants influencing human variation in a complex, multifactorial trait relies on several complementary and constantly changing technologies. A thorough review of this field would require a lengthy chapter and is well beyond the scope of this section. Rather, we plan here to provide a succinct overview of the main approaches that can be used to define the genetic anatomy of exercise traits.\n\nCandidate genes\n\nIn the search for a relevant gene, scientists often pursue so-called “candidate genes”. A candidate gene is one that has, on theoretical ground or based on some data, a relationship with the physiological and metabolic systems of relevance to the trait of interest. Candidate genes are often defined on the basis of animal models. For instance, the ob mouse, whose genetic deficiency was shown to be in a gene that became known as the leptin gene (382), was at the origin of a large number of studies performed on LEP in human populations. Transgenic (TG), knockdown, and knockout (KO) mice have likewise generated many candidate genes that were subsequently investigated for their potential involvement in human variation for given phenotypes.\n\nThe expression level of a gene or noncoding transcript can also serve as a candidate phenotype against which DNA variants can be tested for associations. As a matter of fact, the complete transcriptome, which is, simply put, the full set of RNA transcripts in a given cell or tissue, is used to define new panels of candidate genes for further genomic studies [e.g., (99, 328)]. The approach can be extended to the proteome, i.e., the complete set of proteins and their amounts in a cell or tissue.\n\nCandidate gene studies have been very prominent in the early research phase of exercise genomics and genetics. Many of them were quite simple in design and were launched primarily because whole blood had been stored in freezers. Human study designs are quite straightforward, being typically case-control or cross-sectional cohort studies with unrelated subjects. In the case-control design, testing for a relation between a trait and a gene marker is based on the comparison of allele and genotype frequencies between two informative groups of subjects, one having the phenotype of interest (e.g., elite endurance athletes—the “cases”), the other not having the phenotype of interest (the “controls”). On the other hand, for continuous traits, the association is tested by comparing mean trait values across genotype groups or between carriers and noncarriers of a specific allele, as defined by a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism, or other types of genomic markers.\n\nMost of the candidate gene studies reported thus far in exercise biology are plagued by their small sample sizes and lack of appropriate statistical power (45, 258). Studies with small sample sizes get lucky occasionally, especially if they include several traits and perform multiple statistical tests for association. Fortunately, their positive findings seldom get replicated, and they are soon forgotten. Another concern involves the inclusion and exclusion criteria for membership in a cohort or case and control groups. Many of the early studies were designed to fail in this regard, for instance by comparing VO2max values among three genotypes at a given locus with subjects who varied in their level of exercise participation.\n\nOne potential issue in studies with unrelated subjects that has received a lot of attention is an increased risk of false-positive findings due to population stratification. Population stratification can be defined as the presence of distinct subpopulations within a study cohort. The basic rationale is that if these subpopulations differ from each other in terms of both allele frequencies and trait values, a statistically significant association between a genetic marker and a trait may occur even if such an association does not exist. Stratification is truly an issue when a cohort combines individuals from different ethnic groups, but it is less clear when a sample is from a single ethnic group. A number of statistical procedures have been developed to test for the presence of population stratification in cohort studies.\n\nFamily-based association tests avoid the potential bias arising from the presence of population stratification. The transmission of a given allele to children with a specific trait (e.g., high BMI, low muscle mass) more often than would be expected by chance alone suggests that this particular allele is potentially contributing to the trait. Statistical models have been developed to test for the preferential transmission of alleles to informative individuals; these tests are known as transmission disequilibrium tests (TDT) (303). TDT models are not affected by population stratification, as they depend on the randomness of allele transmission within families. The original TDT models were developed to use so-called “trios” (mother, father, and informative offspring). The TDT models were later extended to families with multiple offspring and to quantitative traits (1, 249).\n\nLinkage studies and quantitative trait loci\n\nGenes influencing complex, multifactorial traits are referred to as quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In animal models and in human studies, QTLs are defined as positions on chromosomes and are the products of positional cloning efforts. In rodent models, QTLs are typically identified on the basis of crosses between informative strains, with the goal of discovering a clear co-segregation of the smallest possible chromosome segment with the trait of interest. This approach works best for loci with substantial effect sizes.\n\nIn humans, positional association studies between genetic markers and a trait are based on linkage analysis across generations. The statistical linkage test is performed using a regression-based method or variance components modeling. Briefly, in the regression method, the phenotypic resemblance of siblings is modeled as the mean-corrected cross-product of the siblings’ trait values (224). In the variance components linkage method, the trait variance is decomposed into additive effects of a trait locus, a residual familial background, and a residual nonfamilial component (6, 245). The phenotypic covariance of the sibling pairs is modeled as a function of allele sharing or IBD. The linkage testing is performed using the likelihood ratio test contrasting a null hypothesis model of no linkage with an alternative hypothesis model in which the variance due to the trait locus is estimated. Although the approach has had some success with disease traits, the application to complex, multifactorial phenotypes has been more laborious. One of the reasons seems to be that QTLs for such traits have generally small effect sizes, and linkage analysis does not seem to have sufficient sensitivity to detect them. Unfortunately, exercise biology traits fall generally into this category.\n\nA difference between linkage and association studies is that association targets alleles or genotypes at a specific gene or genetic marker, whereas linkage aims to identify a specific general chromosomal region. Thus, linkage analysis is used to identify chromosomal regions that harbor gene(s) affecting quantitative traits (hence QTLs), even if there is no a priori knowledge of the gene(s). Linkage studies require family or pedigree data; the basic observation unit is a pair of relatives (usually siblings), not an individual subject.\n\nThe identification of a QTL is always a major undertaking, but it is only a first step in the effort to associate allelic variation with a trait variance. A typical QTL may span several millions of DNA base pairs and may encode a large number of transcripts or genes. Progressing from the QTL to the causal sequence and alleles requires positional cloning. The goal is to reduce the size of the targeted region to the smallest possible stretch of DNA. This is usually done using more dense set of markers and ultimately DNA sequencing in informative subjects. Even if the genomic markers used in fine mapping do not include the specific DNA sequence variant(s) affecting the trait, they can provide useful leads as they may co-segregate with the true variant influencing the trait. This is called allelic association or linkage disequilibrium. Once the results are deemed strong enough, the final step is to sequence the candidate gene and flanking regions for DNA variants. The confirmation of the relevance of detected mutations generally includes replication association studies in samples from the same population and in other populations.\n\nWhen a solid target has been uncovered and replicated, further validation is necessary using combinations of in vitro functional assays (expression studies in various cell lines) and in vivo in humans, which are commonly complemented by rodent experiments (TG studies). The linkage and positional cloning approach has been used successfully to identify genes causing diseases such as long QT syndrome 1 (364) and autosomal dominant familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (158, 317). Both traits are characterized by increased incidence of cardiac events during exercise. The positional cloning efforts of the response to exercise QTLs in the HERITAGE Family Study have yielded a number of strong candidates for the changes in submaximal exercise capacity with regular exercise (CREB1) and in SV and Q (KIF5B) (16, 253).\n\nGenome-wide association studies\n\nEven though genome-wide linkage analyses were productive lines of research as evidenced by a meta-analysis of more than 300 publications pertaining to 11 common chronic diseases (170), technological and analytical advances have made them almost obsolete in the search for genes contributing to complex traits. The introduction of microarray-based, high-throughput SNP-genotyping methods has drastically increased the ability to capture the existing variation in the genome of thousands of individuals at a reasonable cost. There are about 10 million SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 5% or more in the human genome. Subsets of common variants are linked together (i.e., there is no or infrequent recombination among them) and transmitted across generations as a unit or a block. SNPs in a block are correlated, often highly correlated. In the latter case, it becomes possible to tag a set of SNPs by genotyping only the most representative SNP, the so-called tagSNP. From a practical point of view, genotyping 500,000 to 1 million SNPs has been seen as sufficient to capture most of the common SNPs of the human genome. However, important differences have been observed among the major ethnic groups for allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns.\n\nIn brief, the recent ability to assay hundreds of thousands of DNA sequence variants in a single experiment has made genome-wide association studies (GWASs) a reality, and the first study based on this technology was published in 2005 (147).\n\nOf considerable interest to exercise biology scientists was the early series of GWA reports focusing on type 2 diabetes (279, 286, 299, 309, 380). The field has moved ahead at a very rapid pace since 2005. We now have more than 600 published GWASs covering 150 diseases and complex traits. About 800 SNPs have been associated with a trait at the genome-wide significance level (P<5×10−8) (180). The catalog of these studies and their findings can be accessed at http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies.\n\nAfter a while, it became evident that panels of SNPs and GWASs were not covering well a major fraction of human genomic polymorphisms, which are commonly referred to as copy number variants or CNVs. The full significance of CNVs for complex traits continues to be a topic of research and debate. There are reasons to believe that CNVs may be important as some of them are transcribed, resulting in multiple copies of given RNA sequences. However, it is early in the scientific exploration of this issue. One major report published in 2010 genotyped 3432 CNVs in 3000 controls and 2000 cases each of eight common diseases (bipolar disorder, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, Crohn’s disease, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes). Three CNVs were associated with diseases, but they had been identified before in SNP-based studies. The main conclusion of this study performed by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium was that the common CNVs typed on these patients are unlikely to contribute greatly to the genetic basis of common diseases (66). It is still early in this journey, and a more definitive assessment of the true value of CNV genotyping, especially for physiological and metabolic traits, will have to await the findings of additional research.\n\nThus, GWASs have become an essential tool in the effort to identify genetic loci and SNPs contributing to human variation in complex biological and behavioral traits. The main challenge arising from GWAS findings is to go beyond a significant SNP to the true causal mutation and the gene or transcript involved. Indeed, few of the significant SNPs uncovered and replicated to date have been resolved at the gene or transcript level. Exercise biologists are just beginning to take advantage of this new technology, but we are likely to see a growing incorporation of GWASs in exercise genomics. However, it should be appreciated that a GWAS remains a major intellectual and financial undertaking.\n\nDNA sequencing\n\nThe ultimate goal of genomic and genetic research is to identify specific DNA differences causing diseases, predisposing to diseases, associating with high or low values of a trait, or predicting the ability to adapt to lifestyle or environmental changes. Most of these DNA variants are likely to be single-nucleotide changes, but there will be more complex DNA alterations, as well. Here we briefly review the nature of the DNA changes that we are looking for in the genome, with a comment on future approaches and the technologies that will support them.\n\nDNA sequence differences may vary from a substitution of a single base to a loss or gain of entire chromosomes or large chromosomal regions. Mutations that occur in germ line cells can be transmitted to future generations, whereas somatic cell mutations are restricted to a single individual and the population of cells derived from the mutated cell. Large-scale germ line chromosomal abnormalities are relatively rare, but they usually show a clear phenotype, which is generally pathogenic and often lethal. Large-scale somatic mutations are more common and often occur in tumor cells.\n\nDNA base mutations can be grouped into three types: base substitutions, deletions, and insertions ( ). A base substitution is by definition a change in a single base (i.e., a SNP). Synonymous or silent substitutions are the most frequently observed in coding DNA. They do not change an amino acid in the final gene product. However, they may have functional consequences by changing the splicing pattern of the gene. Non-synonymous substitutions result in an altered codon that specifies either a different amino acid (a missense mutation) or a termination codon (a nonsense mutation). A missense mutation can induce either a conservative or nonconservative amino acid substitution. A conservative substitution does not significantly change the chemical properties of the amino acid encoded by the new codon, whereas the amino acid introduced by a nonconservative substitution has different chemical characteristics. Thus, nonconservative substitutions are more likely to change the properties of the gene product than conservative substitutions. Deletions and insertions refer to the removal or addition, respectively, of one or a few nucleotides from the DNA sequence. These variations are relatively common in noncoding DNA. They are less frequent in exons where they may introduce frameshifts, i.e., alter the normal translational reading frame of the gene and thereby change the final gene product ( ).\n\nSingle-base mutations used to be viewed as functionally significant only if they affected the amino acid sequence. However, silent substitutions in exons, as well as mutations in the noncoding sequence, may also have significant effects on gene transcription and on the final gene product. For instance, mutations in the 5′-regulatory region may disrupt transcription factor binding sites, response elements, or enhancer or silencer sequences and thereby affect the rate at which a gene is transcribed. Although the 3′-UTR of a gene is typically thought of as not being as critical for its expression control as the coding and promoter regions, it does contain sequence elements affecting nuclear transport, polyadenylation, subcellular targeting, miRNA targeting, and stability of mRNA (65). However, mutations in the 3′-UTR have been shown to alter binding sites for miRNAs (319). Mutations in these sequences can therefore also influence gene transcription and translation. Both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in the coding sequence may alter splicing sites between coding and noncoding regions, as well as splicing enhancers and silencers, with potentially dramatic effects on the mature polypeptide (56).\n\nWith the extraordinary progress made in sequencing technologies, it has become feasible to sequence long stretches of DNA in many samples. Although the SNPs selected for a GWAS by providers or customized to meet the specific needs of an investigator can cover a substantial fraction of the genomic variants, they do not capture all of them. There is a trend for investigators to undertake “deep sequencing” of genomic regions of interest as generated by significant associations with SNPs and other lines of evidence. Sequencing allows for the identification of all existing rare and common variants, which can then be further tested in larger samples if warranted. Moreover, we are closer to the day when it will be technically and economically advantageous to simply sequence the whole genome of all participants or patients of a study. Capturing the whole sequence for all individuals of a study, combined with the ability to analyze the enormous amount of information generated, will remove once and for all the uncertainty about the representativeness of the set of markers retained for a given study, as is the case now. There are several companies that have sequencing platforms in development with the goal of being able to perform whole-genome sequencing on large numbers of individuals at reasonable cost, with a high degree of reproducibility and the necessary supportive software (e.g., Illumina, Applied Biosystems, Helicos BioSciences, Pacific Biosciences).\n\nGenetics and exercise level\n\nWe begin our reviews of specific traits with a section on physical activity level. It will be followed by sections on cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength and the responsiveness to exercise training. Subsequently, we present an integrated discussion of pathways and genes that have the potential to generate new candidates for targeted genetic studies.\n\nRegular physical activity is a central component of current public health recommendations. While psychological, social, and environmental factors contribute significantly to physical activity behavior, it has been recognized that activity behavior has a biological basis and that genetic variation could affect individuals’ propensity to be physically active or sedentary. Studies in nuclear and extended families have provided maximal heritability estimates ranging from 15% to 60% for total physical activity as well as for sedentarism, leisure-time activity, and sports participation (51, 61, 198, 231, 234, 296). Likewise, several twin studies have investigated various domains of physical activity behavior and reported consistently that phenotypic resemblance is significantly higher among MZ than DZ twins [see reference (255) for details]. For example, analysis of pooled data from seven large studies with a total of 37,051 twin pairs (13,676 MZ pairs, 17,340 same-sex DZ pairs, and 6,035 opposite-sex DZ pairs) reported that median heritability estimates across all individual cohorts reached 62% (314).\n\nData on molecular genetics of physical activity levels in humans are still scarce, although the first GWAS for activity level was recently published. However, animal studies provide several examples of how naturally occurring mutations and artificially induced changes in key genes may affect physical activity patterns. For example, modification of genes encoding key molecules for the dopamine pathway have been shown to affect activity levels; mice lacking the solute carrier family 6 (dopamine transporter), member 3 gene (Slc6a3) exhibit marked hyperactivity (88), whereas dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2) -deficient mice are significantly less active than wild-type animals (145). Along the same lines, disruption of the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) pathway leads to hyperactivity. Mice lacking the pro-melanin-concentrating hormone (Pmch) gene or carrying an inactive form of the Pmch gene are lean and hyperactive, although their food intake is normal (152, 288, 383). A similar hyperactivity phenotype is generated if the MCH action is blocked by knocking out the MCH receptor 1 (Mchr1) gene (17, 182, 383).\n\nLightfoot and colleagues reported on a major effort to define the genetic map of the spontaneous level of activity in mice. Voluntary wheel-running activity was measured at about 9 weeks in 41 inbred strains of mice (165). Thirty-eight strains could be used for haplotype association mapping with more than 8 million SNPs (85). Twelve QTLs were identified—three observed in males and females, five in males only, and four in females only. Three QTLs were identified for daily distance run, which remained significant under most analytical scenarios. Surprisingly, no QTLs for duration of daily activity or for running speed could be identified that were significant in both sexes. Confirming that there is a genetic predisposition in rodents to engage in exercise, Kelly and colleagues identified 32 significant QTLs for daily running traits in mice using a panel of 530 SNPs (146). An example of the potential involvement of a spontaneous gene mutation in physical activity regulation comes from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). These insects exhibit distinct activity patterns related to food-search behavior; rovers move about twice the distance while feeding, compared to sitters. This activity pattern is genetically determined and is regulated by the foraging dg2 gene (now known as for), which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (221). PKG activity is significantly higher in wild-type rovers than in wild-type and mutant sitters, and activation of the for gene reverts foraging behavior in a sitter to that found in a rover. Furthermore, overexpression of the for gene in sitters changed a sitter’s behavior to that of the rover phenotype (221).\n\nIn humans, molecular genetic data on physical activity level come from candidate gene studies and genome-wide screenings. Candidate gene selection for physical activity and sedentarism traits is challenging because of the multifactorial nature of the phenotypes and limited knowledge of the biology of exercise participation. In studies based on a priori hypotheses, candidate gene selection has been motivated by neurotransmitter and energy balance pathways that are potentially involved in activity behavior regulation (DRD2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 1 [ACE], leptin receptor [LEPR], and melanocortin 4 receptor [MC4R]) (45). In the Quebec and HERITAGE Family Studies, a C/T transition in codon 313 of the DRD2 gene was associated with physical activity level; Caucasian women who were homozygous for the T-allele were significantly less active than the other genotypes in both studies (297). In the QFS cohort, Loos and colleagues reported significant associations between a C/T polymorphism located in the 5′-region of the MC4R gene and physical activity phenotypes (172). Homozygotes for the T-allele had significantly lower moderate to strenuous physical activity levels and higher inactivity scores than the other genotypes.\n\nIn Pima Indians, a glutamine (Gln) to arginine (Arg) substitution in codon 223 of the LEPR gene was associated with total physical activity level, calculated from the division of 24-hour energy expenditure by sleeping energy expenditure measured in a respiratory chamber. The Arg233Arg homozygotes showed a 5% lower physical activity level than the Gln223Gln homozygotes (308). In a group of never-treated stage I hypertensives (372), the ACE I/D genotype was associated with physical activity status assessed by a questionnaire. The frequency of the D/D genotype was significantly higher in the sedentary group than among physically active subjects. Approximately 76% of the D/D homozygotes were sedentary, whereas the corresponding frequency in the I-allele homozygotes was 48% (372).\n\nFour studies have reported genome-wide linkage scans for physical activity traits. In the QFS, the strongest evidence of linkage was observed on chromosome 2p22-p16 for the physical inactivity phenotype (298). Suggestive linkages were found on 13q22 with total activity and moderate to strenuous activity and on 7p11 with both inactivity and moderate to strenuous activity (298). De Moor and colleagues reported genome-wide linkage scans for participation in competitive sports in 700 female DZ twins (1946 markers) and for exercise participation in Dutch sibling pairs (361 markers). Suggestive QTLs were identified on chromosomes 3q22-q24, 4q31-q34, and 19p13.3 (71, 72). A genome-wide linkage scan with a 10 centiMorgan microsatellite panel in the Viva La Familia Study revealed QTLs on chromosome 18q12.2-q21.1 for sedentary and light activities with logarithm of odds (LOD) scores of 4.07 and 2.79, respectively. Maximum LOD scores of 2.28 and 2.2 for total and moderate activities, respectively, were detected about 20 centiMorgans downstream at 18q21.32, near the MC4R locus (51).\n\nThe first GWAS on habitual physical activity level was published in 2009, and the report included results from two cohort studies: 1,644 unrelated individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register and 978 subjects living in Omaha, NE (70). Leisure-time physical activity level was quantified using questionnaires, and MET-hours were calculated based on the type, frequency, and duration of reported activities. Work and commuting-related (e.g., biking to work) activities as well as activities such as gardening were excluded from the MET-hour calculations. Exercisers were defined as subjects who reported at least 4 MET-hours per week, while those with less than 4 weekly MET-hours were classified as non-exercisers. The exerciser/non-exerciser classification was used as the primary phenotype for the GWA analyses. The GWAS SNPs were derived from Perlegen Sciences (Dutch cohort: 435,291 SNPs) and Affymetrix (American cohort: 381,000 SNPs) platforms. In addition, approximately 2.5 million SNPs from the International HapMap Caucasian database were imputed in both cohorts to standardize the SNPs from the two different platforms. The final genotype data set included 1.6 million SNPs. The proportion of genotyped SNPs was 17.5% and 18.9% in the Dutch and American cohorts, respectively (70).\n\nNone of the 1.6 million SNPs reached the commonly used threshold of genome-wide significance (p=5×10−8), although SNPs in three genomic regions showed p-values less than 1×10−5. The strongest associations were observed on chromosome 10q23.2 at the 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthase 2 (PAPSS2) gene locus; the odds ratio (OR) for being an exerciser was 1.32 (p=3.81×10−6) for the common T-allele of SNP rs10887741. PAPSS2 encodes an enzyme that is involved in sulfation of various molecules, including glycosaminoglycans. Mechanisms by which PAPSS2 could affect exercise participation are unknown, but mutations in the PAPSS2 have been reported to cause spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, which is characterized by short stature and short limbs both in humans and in mice (343). The other two SNPs with p<1×10−5 were rs12612420 (p=7.61×10−6, OR=1.43), located about 12 kb upstream of the first exon of the DNA polymerase-transactivated protein 6 (DNAPTP6) gene (now known as spermatogenesis associated, serine-rich 2-like [SPATS2L]), and rs8097348 (p=6.68 × 10−6, OR=1.36), located about 236 kb upstream of chromosome 18 open reading frame 2 (C18orf2). The associations with previously reported physical activity candidate genes and physical activity linkage regions were explored as well. The strongest candidate gene association was detected with SNP rs12405556 (p=9.7 × 10−4, OR=1.24) at the LEPR locus. However, the pooled p-value reflected mainly the strong association observed in the American cohort (p=9.79 × 10−5; p=0.226 in the Dutch sample). The strongest association among the previously identified linkage regions was found on chromosome 15q13 with SNP rs8036270 (p=4.61 × 10−5) in the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor, gamma 3 (GABRG3) gene locus.\n\nThe major advantage of the GWAS strategy is that it is not restricted by a priori hypotheses, as is the case in candidate gene studies. Moreover, a GWAS covers the entire genome uniformly and in more detail than microsatellite-based linkage scans and thereby has much better sensitivity to detect small to moderate gene effects of relatively common sequence variants than the linkage scans. A critical feature of genetic studies is replication: findings of an individual study should be tested in other large cohorts with a similar phenotype and study design. If the associations are replicated, the case for the contribution of a gene and DNA sequence variant to the trait of interest becomes considerably stronger. Given that several large cohort studies with habitual physical activity questionnaire data have also recently completed GWAS SNP genotyping, we could have interesting new data with replication panels in the next few years.\n\nThe studies summarized here indicate that physical activity-related traits are influenced by genetic factors, with maximal heritability estimates ranging from 15% to 60%. The majority of the data available are based on genetic epidemiology studies, but the first molecular genetic studies support the notion that it is possible to detect biologically relevant genetic effects on habitual physical activity at the molecular level. The major limitation at the moment is the paucity of studies addressing the genetics of physical activity behavior in humans. Additional genetic studies on physical activity level would be particularly important for replication of the positive association studies. Currently, most of the findings are based on single reports, although in some cases the associations were found in multiple cohorts [e.g., reference (297)]. Larger studies would also allow us to investigate gene-gene interactions as well as potential pleiotrophic effects on physical activity and health outcomes. A recent study reported that phenotypic association between exercise participation and self-rated health status observed in over 5000 adult twins and their siblings was fully accounted for by additive genetic correlation (73). This observation raises the interesting question of whether activity behavior and health-related phenotypes are affected at least to some extent by some of the same genes. One clear limitation has been the measurement of physical activity level. Random variation in activity level estimates obtained from questionnaires and diaries can be quite high, which seriously limits the statistical power to detect small or moderate genetic associations. However, improvements in objective activity level-recording technologies will alleviate, if not solve, the problem.\n\nThe future for the genetic studies of physical activity behavior looks promising. Several stumbling blocks that have slowed progress in the field have been either eliminated or significantly alleviated. Once these improvements can be combined with the most recent advancements in molecular genetic techniques, our understanding of the genetics of physical activity behavior should improve drastically. One untouched area is that of DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications and how they influence physical activity levels.\n\nGenetics, cardiorespiratory endurance, and muscle strength\n\nAs summarized previously, a considerable amount of evidence indicates that cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength and power aggregate in families and are heritable traits. This section summarizes the current evidence from animal and human studies related to the molecular genetic architecture of exercise performance phenotypes. First, genome-wide studies in mice, rats, and horses, as well as a single-gene case in dogs, are reviewed. Then, we summarize exercise intolerance conditions caused by single-gene defects and review candidate gene studies in humans. Finally, genome-wide linkage scans for cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength phenotypes are reviewed.\n\nEvidence from animal studies\n\nIn rats, a genome-wide linkage scan was performed using an intercross of two inbred strains, one with low (COP) and one with high (DA) running capacity. A genome-wide linkage scan found a significant QTL on chromosome 16 at 30 cM with a maximum LOD score of 4.0 ( ). In addition, suggestive QTLs were detected on chromosomes 16 (62 cM; LOD=2.9) and 3 (~4 cM; LOD = 2.2) (365). In a follow-up study, chromosomes 16 and 3 of DA rats were introgressed into the genetic background of COP rats. The DA chromosome 16 congenic COP rats had significantly greater aerobic running capacity than the COP rats (366). Using a similar paradigm, Lightfoot and colleagues intercrossed inbred mouse strains displaying high and low maximal exercise endurance capacity (166). A genome-wide linkage scan detected a significant QTL on the X chromosome with a maximum LOD score of 2.26 at 57.9 cM ( ). In addition, a suggestive evidence of linkage (LOD=1.19) was found on chromosome 8 at 36.1 cM (166).\n\nTable 5\n\nChrLocusMb*LODHumanRat:3D3Rat563.582.29q3416D16Rat1753.484.08p2216D16Rat5576.622.98p23Mouse:8D8MIT35976.551.1919p13.1XDXMIT31160.412.26Xp22.2\n\nModern thoroughbred horses provide an interesting model for high exercise performance capacity. These horses have been selected for exceptional racing performance during the past 300 to 400 years, and they originate from a small number of founders. It has been estimated that the majority (95%) of the paternal lineage comes from one founder stallion while ten founder mares contribute about 72% of the maternal lineage. The selection process has brought about several physiological characteristics that contribute to the running capacity, including a large lung volume, high hemoglobin concentration, and high Q, as well as large skeletal muscle mass with high mitochondrial density, oxidative enzyme activity, and glycogen storage capacity. The average VO2max in thoroughbreds is over 200 mL of oxygen per kilogram per minute.\n\nUsing a panel of 394 equine microsatellite markers in 112 thoroughbreds and 52 non-thoroughbred horses, Gu and coworkers performed a genome-wide scan to identify selected genomic regions in thoroughbreds (104). Evidence of positive genomic selection was screened by testing deviation of observed marker heterozygosities from expected values (assuming neutrality) within the thoroughbred population and by testing allele frequency differences between thoroughbreds and non-thoroughbreds. Statistical significance was reached (p<0.05) in 17 genomic regions, 9 of which were also detected in the intrapopulation loss of heterozygosity tests ( ). While this approach can be used to detect positively selected chromosomal regions, it does not have sufficient sensitivity to identify specific genes. However, gene ontology analysis of the nine regions detected by both statistical methods returned 369 genes, allowing for some interesting observations. Biological processes and molecular functions that were found significantly more frequently than expected among these genes included cellular calcium ion homeostasis, sexual reproduction and spermatogenesis, porphyrin biosynthetic process, skeletal development, anatomical structure formation and regulation of osteoblast differentiation, hydrogen peroxide catabolic and metabolic processes, G-protein coupled receptor binding, oxidoreductase activity acting on peroxide as acceptor, and mitochondrial functions (104).\n\nTable 6\n\nChreMapRegionInter-populationIntra-populationHumanFSTp-valueDh/sdp-value438.634.4 – 40.10.450.005−6.117<0.0017q21.3-q22512.27.8 – 21.80.4040.01−2.1510.0421q25-q25.31136.821.9 – 39.70.3920.013−2.9160.00217q21-q231720.710.2 – 23.80.380.018−3.6020.00713q13-q142525.715.7 – 28.10.3520.02−6.775<0.0019q32-q34.11616.014.7 – 17.30.3150.028−2.5710.0142q361741.423.8 – 59.90.310.033−2.5690.01313q14-q311831.123.1 – 31.90.3090.036−2.5340.012q22.32729.627.3 – 35.30.3090.038−2.8630.0174q34 & 8p23\n\nWhile genome-wide studies in animals have not yet yielded any specific genes for exercise performance, the myostatin (MSTN) gene provides an interesting example of a naturally occurring mutation that has relevance for exercise capacity. Myostatin is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, and it acts as a negative regulator of muscle mass in mammals. Mstn mutations leading to inactive or defective gene product have been shown to double or even triple skeletal muscle mass in mice, cows, and sheep. Functional MSTN mutations are very rare in humans, but one case study described a young boy who was a homozygote for a G/A mutation located five nucleotides downstream of exon 1. The mutation abolishes a normal splice donor site and activates a cryptic splice site further downstream on intron 1, which leads to a severely truncated, inactive myostatin molecule. The boy appeared extraordinarily muscular already at birth, and at the age of 4.5 years, he was described to be both muscular and very strong (285).\n\nA two-base pair deletion in exon 3 of Mstn leading to a premature stop codon at amino acid 313 was reported to cause the “bully” phenotype in the whippet dog breed (201). Homozygotes for the mutation have the characteristic double-muscled “bully” appearance, while heterozygotes have intermediate musculature. Interestingly, while the mutation was only rarely seen in dogs competing in dog shows, there was a significant excess of the mutant allele among the fastest dogs based on their racing grades. Thus, it seems that the muscular appearance due to the Mstn mutation is considered undesirable for breed standards, but it may provide an advantage for racing performance (201).\n\nExercise intolerance in humans\n\nAlthough exercise-related traits are mainly polygenic and multifactorial in nature, much can be learned from some monogenic disorders characterized by compromised exercise capacity or exercise intolerance. These disorders affect only a few individuals, but they provide examples of biological defects that have profound consequences on the ability to perform physical activity, usually because of compromised energy metabolism. However, although these genetic defects compromise exercise capacity, there is no evidence that overexpression of the same genes leads to improved physical performance. We believe that important lessons can be learned from a brief review of the genes harboring mutations that result in diminished endurance performance.\n\nThe majority of the mutations found in exercise-intolerant patients are located in genes involved in energy production pathways, especially carbohydrate metabolism. A classic example is McArdle disease, a skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency due to mutations in the PYGM gene resulting in impaired glyco"
