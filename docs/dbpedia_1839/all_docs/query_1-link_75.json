        "text": "While the European Championship is the second-most prestigious tournament to win next to the World Cup, it’s first in terms of quality of competition. Even this year, with co-hosts Poland and Ukraine guaranteed a place in the field when they normally might not have earned it, just about every game has been highly competitive and fairly exciting.\n\nThat also explains how the Netherlands could enter the Euros ranked No. 4 in the world and, two weeks later, slink back home following three straight losses, the final one to Portugal, 2-1, Sunday.\n\nTaking nothing away from Portugal, which finally played a game worthy of its talent after an embarrassing World Cup performance two years ago, nobody could have forseen the Dutch demise.\n\nSo we pose the question. What happens to the Dutch now?\n\nCoach Bert van Marwijk selected a roster that was similar to the one he picked for the 2010 World Cup. That group propelled the Netherlands to the final, where it lost to Spain in overtime.\n\nBut that game also was a black mark on the country’s soccer history. Rather than match its free-flowing style of play against a similar Spanish attack, the Dutch instead resorted to a physical style of play, where they committed 28 fouls, were issued nine yellow cards and finished the game with 10 men.\n\nGetting to the World Cup final was a tribute to van Marwijk, who skillfully massaged all the big egos into a team-first mentality.\n\nThis team was expected to continue that quest for the country’s first title since the 1988 Euros, and it seemed on track as the Dutch breezed through qualifying. Slotted into Group E, the Netherlands won their first nine games, losing their final game to Sweden, 3-2, after wrapping up a Euro berth.\n\nMore important, the Dutch racked up 37 goals in 10 games and seemed unstoppable.\n\nBut the team had questions coming into the Euros. Their defense had a few injuries and there were inexperienced players filling in. Even more worrysome, there was division in the team on who should start at striker, Robin van Persie or Klass-Jan Huntelaar?\n\nBoth had led their respective leagues in scoring, van Persie in England and Huntelaar in Germany. But in van Marwijk’s system, only one would start, and he chose van Persie.\n\nThat would have been fine if all went well, but when it didn’t, well, you saw the result. The griping started following an opening loss to Denmark, and when the Dutch lost to Germany in the second game the panic really set it. Sunday’s loss to Portugal, in which van Marwijk started both strikers in an effort to generate some much-needed offense, resulted in the Netherlands’ worst result since it failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup.\n\nThe retooling, however, must begin now, especially with the team’s first World Cup qualifier in three months, and it will be interesting to see if van Marwijk will still be there moving forward. When a team is fractured, the message gets lost, and when players believe a coach screwed up, a fresh voice is usually needed.\n\nBut this is not a country devoid of talent. On the contrary, not many countries develop players as talented as the Netherlands. Among the key players in the squad, goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg and midfielder Rafael van der Vaart are 29, while Huntelaar, van Persie and midfielders Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben are all 28, so they should still be at the top of their game at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nWhat will also help is that come September, the Netherlands won’t be under such duress to qualify, having been drawn in a relatively easy group with Andorra, Estonia, Hungary, Romania and Turkey.\n\nTheir their first game, however, is against the second-best team in the field, Turkey on Sept. 7. And if the long qualifying process begins with yet another loss, things could turn ugly pretty quickly.\n\nFrank Giase: fgiase@starledger.com\n\nETC....\n\nEgypt, which had been unbeaten in 13 games this year under Bob Bradley, was upset, 3-2, at home by the Central African Republic in the first leg of their African Cup of Nations qualifier.
