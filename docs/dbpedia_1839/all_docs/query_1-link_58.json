        "text": "Euro 2020 is almost upon us, arriving fashionably late after it was so rudely interrupted by the product of a bat shagging a pangolin (I may have my science slightly confused here). We’ve not been exactly starved of football (indeed, there’s been more of it on TV than ever before), but it’s three years since we’ve been able to watch our team in a major tournament. Or, um, 23 years if you’re Scottish.\n\nAnyhoo, there’s an almost unbearable period of about 20 minutes between the end of the football season and the start of Euro 2020, so there’s woefully little for parochial football fans to fall out about. Which is why, at GQ, we’ve decided to swan in, chuck a virtual hand grenade into world of European football and swan out again. (We appreciate that, as far as chucking a virtual hand grenade into European football goes, we have a fair amount to learn from the Big Six…)\n\nSo here, for your delectation/irritation, are our rankings of every European Championship winner. Now, where have we placed England? Oh…\n\n15. Greece (2004)\n\nThe tournament opened with Portugal vs Greece and you would have got bloody good odds on it ending with the same fixture, even more so on Greece coming out on top. Before Euro 2004, Greece had never won a single match at a major tournament. Their squad wasn’t so much a who’s who of international football as a who’s that? Names such as Nikos Dabizas and Giorgos Karagounis may have been vaguely familiar, but this was hardly the stellar squad other nations boasted.\n\nBut damn, were they effective. They finished above Spain in the group and knocked out France (including Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and Robert Pires) and the Czechs (Petr Cech, Karel Poborsky, Pavel Nedved, Tomas Rosicky) in the later rounds. But most impressively, they beat hosts Portugal twice – a Portugal featuring Luis Figo, Rui Costa, Deco, Cristiano Ronaldo and Quim. OK, Quim was only the reserve goalkeeper, but he’s always worth a mention.\n\nThe Greek defence was outstanding: they didn’t concede once in the knockout rounds. And their underdog victory was a delight. So why the lowly ranking? Well, they were lacking in flair, creativity and attacking verve – they only scored seven goals in six games. They lost to Russia, who didn’t even score against anyone else. But, mostly, they rank so low because of the nagging suspicion that if you played the tournament again a hundred times they probably wouldn’t win it.\n\nKey player: Theo Zagorakis. The Greek skipper and combative, all-action midfielder virtually dragged his team to victory, leading by example and covering every blade of grass. He was named Uefa Player Of The Tournament.\n\nUnsung hero: Giorgos Seitaridis. The Greek right-back was part of the side’s fabulous defence and was named Man Of The Match in the final, for keeping Figo and Ronaldo quiet. He was also a decent attacking threat and won the corner that led to the game’s only goal.\n\n14. Denmark (1992)\n\nThe side that failed to qualify for a tournament and still managed to win it. The Danes were only given a place in Euro ’92 after Yugoslavia were disqualified following the outbreak of a terrible war in the country. That they went on to win it was a fairytale story and one that brought considerable joy well beyond their own borders.\n\nPlaced in a group with Sweden, France and England, the assumption was that both Scandinavian teams would be eliminated. Far from it. Both went through, with Denmark’s second place seeing them face reigning champions the Netherlands in the semifinal. Nobody gave them a prayer: they were facing the ’88 team of Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten, Ronald Koeman and Frank Rijkaard, strengthened by the arrival of the de Boers (Frank and Ronald) and Dennis Bergkamp. Yet they drew 2-2, scored all five penalties and went through when van Basten, of all people, saw his spot kick saved.\n\nIn the final, they ran out comfortable 2-0 winners against world champions West Germany, including Jurgens Klinsmann and Kohler, Matthias Sammer and Andreas Brehme. Jon Jensen scored, gaining an entirely unwarranted reputation as a goalscoring midfielder, as Arsenal were to discover to their cost.\n\nThis Denmark team featured only two genuinely world-class players: Brian Laudrup and Peter Schmeichel. Their achievement was extraordinary, for a country of five million people, but this wasn’t even the best Danish team of the era. The 1986 vintage of Morten Olsen, Michael Laudrup, Jan Molby, Soren Lerby, Jesper Olsen and Preben Elkjaer was vastly superior. And had a killer shirt too.\n\nKey player: Peter Schmeichel had just completed his first season at Manchester United, but was already every inch the world’s best keeper. He saved van Basten’s penalty in the semifinal shoot-out and made two brilliant stops from Klinsmann in the final.\n\nUnsung hero: Henrik Larsen (not that one). Finished joint top-scorer in the tournament, with three, including both his side’s goals in the semifinal draw with the Netherlands.\n\n13. Portugal (2016)\n\nIf Portugal go on to win Euro 2020, it won’t be a massive surprise. In the last five years, they have discovered six or seven world-class young players, many of whom now play in the Premier League. But in Euro 2016, they really weren’t all that. They failed to impress in squeaking through the group stages, drawing all three matches against Iceland, Hungary and Austria. They needed extra time to beat Croatia, only overcame Poland on penalties and beat an Aaron Ramsey-less Wales in the semifinal. There never was an easier route to a major final.\n\nAs a result, they went into the final heavy underdogs to hosts France, who had a brilliant all-round team that would go on to win the World Cup two years later. When Cristiano Ronaldo, the side’s talismanic, inspirational skipper, injured a knee in a challenge with Dimitri Payet after seven minutes (he finally went off, in tears, in the 25th minute) the game was all but up. Nobody gave the Portuguese a prayer – particularly as the previously excellent Renato Sanches wasn’t having one of his better games.\n\nBut amid the atmosphere (and moths) of an extraordinary night in Paris, the Portuguese defensive titans of Pepe, Jose Fonte and goalkeeper Rui Patricio held firm in the face of a French onslaught, before unheralded substitute Eder scored a belter in extra time to win the match. Ronaldo, who had been frantically coaching on the sidelines, broke down again at the final whistle, this time with tears of joy.\n\nKey player: Ronaldo (surprise, surprise). Of the eight goals scored by Portugal en route to the final, he scored three and assisted three.\n\nUnsung hero: Pepe. The defender is frequently (and entirely justifiably) seen as a mendacious bellend by opposition supporters, but the painful truth is that he’s also an extraordinarily good defender and was never better than in this tournament.\n\n12. Soviet Union (1960)\n\nThe first ever winners of the European Championships (or European Nations’ Cup, as it then was) only had to win three ties to lift the trophy. And that includes qualification! That’s reason enough to put them near the bottom of this list, combined with the fact that many of Europe’s strongest teams (including Italy, West Germany and England) didn’t enter the tournament.\n\nThe actual tournament in France began at the semifinal stage. To qualify, the Soviets had beaten a decent Hungary side 4-1 (though this was by no means the fearsome proposition of Ferenc Puskas and Sándor Kocsis of the 1950s) before being drawn to play Spain in the quarterfinals. But the Spanish, under the fascistic Franco regime, refused to play a tie against the communist Soviets, who were handed a bye to the semifinal. Here, they ran out 3-0 winners against Czechoslovakia, with winger Valentin Ivanov scoring twice.\n\nIn the final, they faced Yugoslavia, who had come back from 4-2 down with 15 minutes left to beat France 5-4 in a dramatic semifinal. This time, it was the Soviets who came from behind to draw 1-1, before claiming a winner in extra time with a Viktor Ponedelnik header. It was the only major tournament the Soviet Union would ever win.\n\nKey player: Lev Yashin wasn’t just the goalkeeper of the tournament, he was arguably the best goalkeeper of all time. The Soviet custodian for 16 years, he was at his athletic best in his nation’s march to glory in 1960.\n\nUnsung hero: Igor Netto was one of those useful types who could play anywhere, although he was most often deployed in central midfield. He captained the national team from 1952-65 and also played ice hockey for Spartak Moscow.\n\n11. Italy (1968)\n\nYou might think penalties are a brutally unfair way to settle a tie, but try telling that to the Soviet Union. Unbelievably, in the semifinal of the 1968 European Championships, following a 0-0 draw after extra time, the captains of (host nation) Italy and the Soviet Union stepped forward for a coin toss to decide who would go through to the final. Italy skipper Giacinto Facchetti successfully called tails (the only possible answer, as it never fails) and the Azzurri were through – sweet revenge after the Soviets had knocked them out of the World Cup two years previously.\n\nIn the final, they faced Yugoslavia, who had beaten world champions England 1-0 in their semi. The match finished 1-1 and in the absence of penalties, and reluctant to award an actual trophy on a coin toss, the game was replayed two days later. This time Italy won 2-0, with the first goal from one of their all-time greats, Luigi Riva (whose record of 35 goals from his 42 caps stands alongside the best in the game). Along with Sandro Mazzola, he formed a devastating attacking partnership that would lead Italy to the World Cup final two years later.\n\nKey player: Giacinto Facchetti. The defender wasn’t only adept at calling coin tosses. In a 15-year international career, he won 94 caps and was one of the first fullbacks to employ his skills going forward as well as defensively. He was named in the team of the tournament, an honour bestowed on him again two years later at the World Cup.\n\nUnsung hero: In the quarterfinals of the tournament, Italy gave a debut to a young goalkeeper by the name of Dino Zoff. He would keep hold of the gloves for the next 15 years, winning 112 caps. He was named best goalkeeper at the tournament and he just got better from there.\n\n10. Germany (1996)\n\nIt would be tempting to name this Germany side as the best to ever set foot on a pitch – only that could explain how they managed to beat England at Wembley in that agonising semifinal 25 years ago. But the slightly more mundane truth is that the side that stopped football from coming home wasn’t one of the strongest of the Mannschaft teams.\n\nThey moved through the group stage with what an unimaginative journalist might refer to as “clinical Teutonic efficiency”, beating the Czech Republic 2-0, Russia 3-0 and drawing 0-0 with Italy. But, thereafter, they never entirely convinced. They struggled to a 2-1 win over Croatia in the quarterfinals, in spite of their opponents being reduced to ten men for the final 40 minutes.\n\nIn their semifinal against England, they would have gone out if Paul Gascoigne had been three inches taller. Instead, a 1-1 draw led to penalties, at which point it became apparent that there was only ever going to be one winner. They didn’t really even need to bother with the actual shoot-out. (Incidentally, whatever happened to that Southgate chap who missed for England?)\n\nIn the final, they came up once again against the Czechs, an attractive but hardly world-beating team, featuring the likes of Nedved, Poborsky and Patrik Berger. It was the latter who put the Cezchs ahead in the final, before Oliver Bierhoff netted twice (the second a 95th-minute golden goal) to sent the trophy back to Germany.\n\nKey player: Matthias Sammer had been converted to a libero role for the tournament and marshalled the German back line superbly. He also chipped in with two goals, including the winner against Croatia, and was named Player Of The Tournament.\n\nUnsung hero: Dieter Eilts, an unfancied midfield anchor from unfashionable Werder Bremen, was appearing at his first major tournament. His superb work ethic and tactical nous was the rock upon which endless attacks foundered and his positional sense allowed Sammer’s frequent attacking forays.\n\n9. Czechoslovakia (1976)\n\nThe chances are, if you know anything at all about this team’s European Championship win, it relates to one thing: Antonin Panenka’s audacious chipped penalty to win the final. As a moment of audacious sporting bravado, it is peerless, but it shouldn’t obscure what was a remarkable achievement by a relatively unfancied team.\n\nCzechoslovakia came through a qualifying group that included England and Portugal, in spite of losing their first game 3-0 at Wembley. Indeed, they finished the qualifiers having scored more goals than any other side in Europe. They then overcame the Soviet Union 4-2 in a two-legged quarterfinal, with midfielder Jozef Moder scoring three goals over the tie, the only international goals of his career.\n\nBut it was the semifinal that contained the biggest shock of them all. Many maintain that the Dutch side of the 1970s, featuring Johan Cruyff, Johan Neeskens, Johnny Rep, Robbie Rensenbrink and Ruud Krol, was the best international side in history. What is beyond dispute is that they had just demolished Belgium 7-1 in the quarterfinals and were considered near certainties to go beat the Czechs. Instead, the Czech captain Anton Ondrus scored at both ends and a bad-tempered match went into extra time with both teams reduced to ten men after Jaroslav Pollak and Neeskens were sent off. Half an hour later, and following another Dutch red card (Willem van Hanegem), the Czechs had triumphed 3-1.\n\nThe Czechs were also firm underdogs going into the final, but turned things on their head by going 2-0 up inside 25 minutes. The Germans soon pulled one back, but it wasn’t until the 89th minute that Bernd Holzenbein equalised for the world champions. Extra time produced no goals and so it went to penalties. When Uli Hoeness missed his spot kick, all eyes fell on Panenka and history beckoned.\n\nKey player: Ivo Viktor. The goalkeeper made a series of miraculous saves against both the Netherlands and West Germany, was named Goalkeeper Of The Tournament and finished third in the voting for the 1976 Ballon d’Or.\n\nUnsung hero: Skipper Anton Ondrus was one of seven Slovan Bratislava players in the squad and was the team captain. He played magnificently against the Netherlands, in spite of his own goal, and produced another titanic performance in the final, including scoring his effort in the shoot-out.\n\n8. Spain (1964)\n\nSpain’s qualification for the latter stages of the tournament (the semifinals and final were held in Spain) involved two straightforward wins: 7-3 against Romania and 7-1 against the Republic Of Ireland. But between these two rounds, there was a two-legged fixture against (pre-George Best) Northern Ireland that they only scraped through 2-1, thanks to a 1-0 away victory at Windsor Park in front of 46,000 fans.\n\nIn the semifinal they beat Hungary 2-1, winger Amancio Amaro netting the winner in the 112th minute. And so to the final and something of a grudge match against the Soviet Union. Four years before, Spain (under Franco’s fascist rule) had been disqualified from the Championships for refusing to play their quarterfinal tie against the Soviets on political grounds. Now, the fixture still had political spice, but also the added sense of revenge for disqualification.\n\nFranco himself attended the final and was rewarded with a 2-1 victory. Spain took the lead after only six minutes, Chus Pereda converting a cross from the right (all four of Spain’s goals in the tournament came from the right – Franco would have approved). The holders equalised thanks to a free kick by Galimzyan Khusainov two minutes later. And 1-1 it remained, until the 84th minute, when Marcelino Martinez headed in Perada’s cross.\n\nKey player: Luis Suarez. No, not the perma-hungry Uruguayan, but the creative midfielder known as “El Arquitecto”. Suarez was Man Of The Match in the final and, one of Spain’s all-time greats, he went on to coach them at the 1990 World Cup.\n\nUnsung hero: Amancio Amaro wasn't even the best winger on the team (Paco Gento was strutting his stuff on the other flank). But in this tournament, he was dynamite and went on to finish third in the Ballon d’Or for this year – Suarez was second; Denis Law won it.\n\n7. West Germany (1980)\n\nThe first proper full tournament, with eight teams split into two groups, saw the top team in each group progress to the finals. West Germany did so thanks to wins over the holders Czechoslovakia and a strong Netherlands outfit, along with a slightly less impressive 0-0 draw with Greece. Klaus Allofs scored all three in the 3-2 win over the Netherlands.\n\nThen final saw West Germany take on a Belgium team that was the best the country had ever produced (until the current iteration). The team included Jean-Marie Pfaff, Eric Gerets, Francois van der Elst and Jan Ceulemans. They gave a decent account of themselves in the final, coming from a goal down to equalise with a penalty in the 75th minute, but with extra time looming Horst Hrubesch, the SV Hamburg striker nicknamed “The Header Beast”, scored his second of the game, a trademark bullet header.\n\nTo get an idea of just how good this German side was, the team of the tournament contained no less than six Germans, including Bernd Schuster and the brilliant Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. And poor Allofs, the tournament’s top scorer, wasn’t even among them!\n\nKey player: Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was the complete striker: good with both feet and his head. He was also brilliant at bringing others into play and although he scored just once in the tournament, his all-round play was a key factor in the German success. He went on to win the Ballon d’Or later in the year.\n\nUnsung hero: Horst Hrubesch only made the squad because Schalke’s Klaus Fischer had broken his leg and back home in Germany many were unsure that Hamburg’s big striker was the man for the job. Needless to say, that debate didn’t continue after the final.\n\n6. France (1984)\n\nIt might seem odd for a side containing the likes of Manuel Amoros, Maxime Bossis, Patrick Battiston, Luis Fernandez, Alain Giresse, Didier Six and Jean Tigana, but this was as close to a one-man team as you’re likely to get in international football. And that man, of course, was Michel Platini. His record of nine goals in the tournament is unlikely to be bettered anytime soon – and that was in only five games! From a midfielder! He scored hat-tricks against Belgium and Yugoslavia, as well as the only goal of the game against Denmark, as France won all three group games.\n\nPlatini also grabbed a 119th-minute winner in the semifinal as France came from behind to win 3-2 in extra time against Portugal. France’s other two goals were the only two defender Jean-Francois Domergue ever scored for his country.\n\nIn the final they played Spain, whose own qualification for the tournament had something of the miraculous about it. They had needed to win their final qualifier, against Malta, by eleven goals. At half time they were only 3-1 up, but scored a further nine in the second half to run out 12-1 winners. However, having beaten Denmark on penalties in the semifinal, they failed to trouble France in the final. Platini – who else? – put Les Bleus ahead in the 57th minute. When Bruno Bellone scored his side’s second, in the 90th minute, it was France’s 14th goal of the tournament – and their first by a striker.\n\nKey player: Take a wild guess.\n\nUnsung hero: Alain Giresse, known as “Le Moteur”, certainly had a decent engine on him. The small, industrious midfielder allowed those around him to display their skills, confident in the knowledge he’d put in the hard yards. Giresse was very much a precursor to Didier Deschamps, Claude Makelele and now N'Golo Kante.\n\n5. West Germany (1972)\n\nWest Germany made their first ever European title look ridiculously easy. They sailed through their qualifying group (containing Poland, Turkey and Albania) undefeated and were never behind in any of the knockout matches. In Gerd Muller, they had an irrepressible goal machine, who scored six goals in six qualifiers.\n\nThey made easy work of England in the quarterfinals, winning 3-1 at Wembley (including their inevitable Muller goal) in front of almost 100,000 fans, before playing out the calmest of 0-0 draws back in Berlin.\n\nThe last two matches of the tournament took place in Belgium and West Germany set about destroying their hosts’ dreams by going 2-0 up, with both goals from Muller. A late Lon Polleunis goal for Belgium wasn’t enough to stop the German’s relentless progress.\n\nThe game against the Soviet Union looked a foregone conclusion. West Germany had played them in a pre-tournament friendly and beaten them 4-1, with all four goals from you-know-who. But there’s no such thing as a foregone conclusion in football. Oh, apart from this one. West Germany ran out comfortable winners once again, a 3-0 victory capped by Muller’s tenth and eleventh goals of the campaign.\n\nTo get an idea of the scale of West Germany’s dominance, no fewer than seven of their team featured in the tournament’s best eleven. Little wonder this team, boasting such names as Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer, Paul Breitner, Uli Hoeness, Gunter Netzer and Gerd Muller, would go on to win the World Cup two years later.\n\nKey player: You really can’t look further than Gerd Muller. Eleven goals in ten games looks like an absurd run of form, until you realise it is very much in keeping with his overall international record of 68 goals in 62 games.\n\nUnsung hero: Gunter Netzer was only in the team following an injury to playmaker Wolfgang Overath. With his long blond hair and good looks, Netzer was something of a tabloid darling, a status cemented by outstanding performances in the semifinal and final. He went on to be voted German Footballer Of The Year.\n\n4. Netherlands (1988)\n\nThe 1988 tournament is remembered with great affection by many, for a number of reasons – no goalless draws, no penalty shoot-outs and a popular and deserving winning side. It was also Ireland’s first major tournament and they marked the fact by recording a historic win over England (who were abject in losing all three games).\n\nThe Netherlands, meanwhile, got off to a disappointing start, losing 1-0 to the Soviet Union, but swept all before them thereafter. The side featured an irresistible spine of Hans van Breukelen in goal, the cultured pairing of Koeman and Rijkaard at the back, with captain Gullit and Jan Wouters in midfield and Milan’s super-striker van Basten up front.\n\nVan Basten took the tournament by storm in scoring a hat-trick against England in a 3-1 defeat, before the Netherlands overcame an obdurate Ireland 1-0 thanks to an 82nd-minute Wim Kieft goal in the final group match.\n\nThe Dutch faced hosts and favourites West Germany in the semifinal, a team boasting the likes of Brehme, Klinsmann, Voller and the magnificent Lothar Matthaus. It was the latter who put his side ahead with a penalty early in the second half, but van Basten won a penalty for his side after 74 minutes, which Koeman converted. Finally, van Basten himself sealed victory with two minutes to go, sliding in for a cute finish beyond keeper Eike Immel.\n\nThe final offered the chance of revenge against the Soviets, who had surprised everyone with their comfortable 2-0 victory over an excellent Italy side in the other semifinal. The Soviet Union were organised and disciplined and with seven of the starting line-up from Dynamo Kiev they knew each other very well. But, in the end, they were no match for the Dutch, for whom Gullit scored with a thumping header, before van Basten went down in football history with perhaps the best goal ever to grace a major final, volleying in veteran Arnold Muhren’s cross from an impossible angle. When van Breukelen saved a penalty from Igor Belanov, it became clear that this was not going to be the Soviet Union’s day.\n\nKey player: While Ruud Gullit had an outstanding tournament, his Milan teammate Marco van Basten edges him out, finishing tournament top scorer, with vital goals in the semifinal and final.\n\nUnsung hero: Jan Wouters never gained as much attention as his more illustrious colleagues – defensive midfielders rarely do – but he was brilliant in this tournament. The foundation upon which the team was built, he played 90 minutes of all five matches and was named in the Team Of The Tournament.\n\n3. Spain (2008)\n\nSpain came into this tournament as favourites and it wasn’t difficult to see why. Their midfield was an absolute wonder, featuring Xavi, Andres Iniesta, David Silva, Cesc Fabregas and Marcos Senna, up front they had the mercurial duo of Fernando Torres and David Villa and their back line included Carles Puyol, Sergio Ramos and goalkeeper Iker Casillas.\n\nThey duly won all three group matches, recording a 4-1 victory over Russia and 2-1 wins against Greece and Sweden. Their quarterfinal was a dour 0-0 draw against Italy, with Casillas saving two penalties in the shoot-out before Fabregas scored the winning spot kick. The game, which took place on 22 June, ended something of a Spanish hoodoo – they’d played quarterfinals in major tournaments on that date three times and lost all three matches on penalties.\n\nIn the semifinal, they again faced Russia, who had surprised everyone by beating the Netherlands in their quarterfinal. Once again, Spain won a one-sided encounter by three goals. But it was the final where they really impressed. They limited a German attack consisting of Michael Ballack, Lukas Podolski, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Miroslav Klose to just two shots all match, only one of them on target. Torres scored the game’s only goal in the 33rd minute, running on to a Xavi pass before clipping the ball over Jens Lehmann. Thereafter, an experienced German side looked utterly bewildered at the way Spain kept the ball, as if they were playing a different sport. To be fair, with that midfield, they pretty much were.\n\nKey player: At this point in time, Xavi wasn’t just the best midfielder in the Spanish team, he was the best in the world. He opened the scoring in the semifinal and set up Torres for the winner in the final.\n\nUnsung hero: For all the gloriously intricate tiki-taka passing among Spain’s cultured midfielders, one of the players who most caught the eye was the barnstorming box-to-box merchant Marcos Senna, who brought a physical presence to midfield that his more refined teammates lacked. He was brilliant in this tournament.\n\n2. France (2000)\n\nThe French came into this tournament as world champions. In 1998 they’d won the biggest prize of them all and had effectively done so without a striker. It helped, of course, that they had an artist in the team in the form of Zinedine Zidane, but, still, they had no decent striker in that squad. But by 2000 they had solved that problem, thanks to the presence of a callow 22-year-old winger-turned striker called Thierry Henry.\n\nBehind Henry was a world class line-up, with Zidane accompanied by Patrick Vieira, Laurent Blanc, Youri Djorkaeff, Didier Deschamps, Marcel Desailly, Lilian Thuram and Emmanuel Petit. There’s little doubt that this side was the superior of the one that won the World Cup two years before.\n\nThey qualified from their group stage in spite of losing a brilliant match 3-2 to the Netherlands, having already beaten Denmark and the Czech Republic. In the quarterfinals they beat a Spain side featuring Pep Guardiola (whatever happened to him?) 2-1, thanks to goals from Zidane and Djorkaeff. In the semifinal, they came from behind to draw 1-1 with Portugal in normal time before a nerveless 117th-minute penalty from Zidane saw them over the line.\n\nIn the final, they looked set to be thwarted by Marco Delvecchio, who was left utterly unmarked by France’s vaunted defence. But in the 94th minute, substitute Sylvain Wiltord scored an equaliser from a tight angle. In extra time, two more subs combined, with Robert Pires’ clever run and cross smashed home by the left boot of David Trezeguet for a match-winning golden goal.\n\nKey player: With key goals in the quarter and semifinals, and bewitching artistry throughout, it was no surprise that the supremely elegant Zinedine Zidane was named Player Of The Tournament.\n\nUnsung hero: This was the tournament where Thierry Henry came of age. Three goals in earlier rounds and a Man Of The Match performance in the final meant that Arsenal’s 22-year-old genius was now a global superstar.\n\n1. Spain (2012)\n\nThe Hungary of the 1950s. The Dutch total football outfit. England in the Carlton Palmer era. Debate will always rage about the best international side ever, but this Spain side will always garner a mention. The reigning European champions, they were also the world champions and came into this tournament as strong favourites. They more than justified the hype.\n\nThey’d won all eight of their matches in qualifying, with a goal difference of +20. They stormed through the tournament undefeated and conceded just one solitary goal in their six matches. That was in part due to a defence featuring Gerard Pique and Sergio Ramos in front of Iker Casillas. But, more importantly, it was because nobody could get the bloody ball off them. It was hardly surprising, given that their midfield consisted of such silky practitioners as Fabregas, Silva, Xavi, Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Xabi Alonso. They kept the ball so well, some people accused them of being boring, as if looking after the football made them akin to Wimbledon in the late 1980s.\n\nFor the record, this wonderful side drew with Italy 1-1, before beating Ireland 4-0 and Croatia 1-0. They overcame France 2-0 in the quarters and beat Portugal 4-2 on penalties in the semis, before coming up against Italy again in the final.\n\nThe first half of the final was an absolute masterclass – perhaps the greatest 45-minute performance in any major final. Goals from David Silva and Jordi Alba saw them 2-0 up at the break, before later additions from subs Fernando Torres and Juan Mata gave the scoreline a realistic 4-0 look. They were that good. After the match, Alan Hansen declared them “the best team in history”.\n\nKey player: Andres Iniesta lived much of his career in the shadow of Barca and Spain teammate Xavi, but a winning goal in the World Cup final and a Player Of The Tournament accolade in these European Championships assured the great midfielder of legendary status.\n\nUnsung hero: The hugely decorated Jordi Alba isn’t exactly unsung, but he was magnificent in this tournament. Part of an absurdly miserly defence, he was also (typically) the furthest man forward when he latched on to Xavi’s pass in the final to score his team’s second goal.\n\nNow read\n\nEvery Premier League-winning team, ranked: from the Invincibles to the treble winners\n\nFootball was unremarkable on the pitch this season and unforgettable off it\n\nNeymar Jr: ‘The English created football, but Brazil is the country of football’"
