        "text": "The Most Popular Sports in Greece\n\nThe Top 5 Most Popular Sports in Greece\n\nMany sports have their roots in Ancient Greece - and modern Greeks continue to win big across the world!\n\nBut what are the most popular sports in Greece? And who are the country’s greatest athletes?\n\nRead on to find out!\n\nGreece’s Influence over Sports\n\nYou can’t deny the profound impact that Greece has had on the world of sports!\n\nFrom the creation of the ancient Olympic Games to Greek influence on modern sports and their rules - Greece has done it all.\n\nGreece is one of the most influential countries in the world of sports.\n\nInteresting facts about the influence of Greek history and culture on modern sports:\n\nModern athletics originate from the Ancient Greek Olympic Games, which were held every 4 years in Olympia as a way to celebrate athletic excellence. This was the most prestigious sporting event in the world!\n\nMarathons, wrestling, weightlifting and gymnastics can all be traced back to these Olympic Games. They significantly influenced and shaped these modern sports.\n\nThe word “gymnasium” derives from the Greek word gymnós, meaning “naked”. This comes from the Greek Olympic athletes who used to compete nude.\n\nGreece influenced a lot of famous brands that are now closely connected with sports. This includes the famous sports brand Nike, which got its name from Greek mythology: Nike originally was the name of the winged goddess of victory. There is a similarity between Nike's wings and the famous symbol found on their sneakers.\n\nBut, what are the most popular sports in Greece today? What sports do Greek people enjoy watching or playing the most?\n\nLet’s take a closer look!\n\n1. Football\n\nThe Hellenic Football Federation oversees football in Greece\n\nGreece won the UEFA Euro 2004\n\nAt its height, Greece’s national football team was ranked 8th by FIFA\n\nFootball (soccer) is both the most popular and most watched sport in Greece, according to Greek City Times. This is no surprise as football is the most popular sport in the world.\n\nWithin the country, football is overseen by the Hellenic Football Federation which was founded in 1926.\n\nResearch by the EPO- Hellenic Football Federation showed that there are around 300,000 registered football players in Greece, but the number of people who watch this sport greatly exceeds this number!\n\nGreece’s national football team first appeared in international football tournaments in 1980, when they participated in the UEFA Euro 1980.\n\nSince then, the team has qualified for the UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup several times.\n\nGreece gained international recognition when their national team surprised everyone with their performance in the UEFA Euro 2004 - and Greece ended up winning this championship.\n\nThis put Greek football on the map!\n\nAt its height, Greece’s national football team was ranked 8th by FIFA (October 2011). However, their current rank is significantly lower, as they rank 52nd (as of October 2022).\n\nSome of the most famous Greek football players include:\n\nGiorgos Karagounis\n\nAngelos Basinas\n\nTheodoros Zagorakis\n\nAntonios Nikopolidis\n\nKostas Katsouranis\n\nStratos Apostolakis\n\nSokratis Papastathopoulos.\n\n2. Basketball\n\nBasketball first came to Greece in the 1910s\n\nThe men’s national basketball team won the 1987 EuroBasket in Athens\n\nThe women’s national team won the FIBA EuroCup in 2009/10\n\nA close second, basketball is increasing in popularity in Greece; but interestingly enough, this wasn’t always the case.\n\nThe sport was first introduced to Greece in the 1910s by American missionaries, and it was only played by American expatriates and Greeks who had studied in the US.\n\nHowever, it soon became widely recognised across the country, and played by many Greek young people.\n\nIn 1949, the Greece men's national basketball team participated in their first FIBA European Championship (EuroBasket) and managed to win the bronze medal.\n\nGreece opened the doors to its first professional basketball indoor arena in 1959 in Athens.\n\nHowever, the sport truly erupted in popularity after the men's national basketball team won the 1987 EuroBasket in Athens. This caused basketball euphoria in the country.\n\nSince then, the Greek national basketball team has ranked among the top 10 teams worldwide.\n\nThe national team won the European championship twice, so it is no surprise that the national league is one of the most competitive leagues in Europe.\n\nTheir national women’s team has also done pretty well, as they won the FIBA EuroCup for Women in 2009/10.\n\nFaidon Matthaiou is considered the father of Greek basketball. Some of the greatest European NBA players also come from Greece, including Giánnis “Greek Freak” Antetokoúnmpo.\n\nOther famous Greek basketball players include:\n\nPanagiotis Giannakis\n\nTheodoros Papaloukas\n\nVassilis Spanoulis\n\nDimitris Diamantidis\n\nPanagiotis Fasoulas\n\nNikos Zisis\n\n3. Athletics\n\nGreek athletes have won 29 medals at the Olympic Games\n\nFani Chalkia and Periklis Iakovakis are two famous Greek athletes\n\nGreek athletes have won 19 medals in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics\n\nConsidering that athletics pretty much originated in Greece and it was the world centre for athletics, it’s no surprise that the sport still enjoys great popularity among the Greek population.\n\nCollectively, Greek athletes have won 29 medals in total at the Olympic Games, as well as 19 medals in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics.\n\nIndividually, Greece has some of the best athletes in the world, including:\n\nFani Chalkia\n\nPeriklis Iakovakis\n\nAnastasia Kelesidou\n\nPeriklis Iakovakis\n\nHaralabos Papadias\n\nVoula Patoulidou\n\nLambros Papakostas\n\nEven though Greeks particularly excel at this sport, it is still seen mostly as a recreational activity - and it’s not followed quite as much as the other team sports on this list.\n\n4. Water Polo\n\nGreek players have won FINA World League titles\n\nOlympiacos is one of the most successful Greek water polo clubs\n\nAngelos Vlachopoulos is one of the most famous Greek water polo players\n\nGreece is often referred to as an international powerhouse in both men's and women's water polo.\n\nGreek clubs and national teams have achieved a great number of distinctions in international competitions - and it comes as no surprise that water polo is one of the most popular sports in the country!\n\nGreek water polo victories include:\n\nWinning medals at the World Aquatic Championships\n\nWinning categories at the Olympics\n\nFINA World League titles\n\nLEN Championship League titles\n\nSeveral Greek water polo clubs have also enjoyed international success.\n\nOlympiacos is one of the largest and most successful Greek water polo clubs, winning the LEN Euroleague title and the European Super Cup in 2002.\n\nThis makes it the only Greek club to earn the prestigious title of European champions.\n\nEthnikos Piraeus has also won a LEN Trophy and it is considered one of Greece’s greatest water polo teams of all-time.\n\nClose behind them are Vouliagmeni who achieved success in water polo by winning a LEN Cup Winner's Cup in 1997.\n\nThey also came close to winning the LEN Trophy, finishing as runners-up once, a feat also accomplished by NO Patras and Panionios.\n\nThe father of Greek water polo is Dimitrios Diathessopoulos.\n\nOther famous Greek water polo players include:\n\nAngelos Vlachopoulos\n\nDimitrios Skoumpakis\n\nChristódoulos Kolómvos\n\nKonstantinos Genidounias\n\nIoannis Fountoulis\n\n5. Volleyball\n\nThe Hellenic Volleyball Federation oversees volleyball in Greece\n\nTwo-time runners-up in the CEV Champions League\n\nNikos Samaras is one of the most famous Greek volleyball players\n\nVolleyball’s popularity in Greece truly is a no-brainer, considering the fact that Greece has some of the world’s biggest, most beautiful sandy beaches with incredible sea-sights.\n\nVolleyball is also one of the most popular sports in the world!\n\nWhile other sports may be more popular for watching, volleyball is one of the most popular sports among the young Greek population. They enjoy playing it all through middle and high school.\n\nIn Greece, volleyball is overseen by the Hellenic Volleyball Federation, which is a member of CEV.\n\nThey have their own national league, the A1 Ethniki, which is considered one of the top volleyball leagues in Europe. Greek clubs have achieved significant success in European competitions.\n\nOlympiacos has established itself as the top-performing volleyball club in the nation by clinching the highest number of domestic championships. It’s also the only Greek team to secure European titles.\n\nGreek volleyball victories include:\n\nTwo CEV Cups\n\nTwo-time runners-up in the CEV Champions League\n\nNumerous appearances in the final fours of European competitions\n\nThese victories make them a prominent force in European volleyball. Iraklis, Panathinaikos and Orestiada have also made it to the final in continental tournaments.\n\nSome of the most famous volleyball players from Greece include:\n\nNikos Samaras\n\nEléni Kiósi\n\nDimitrios Gkaras\n\nOlga Strantzali\n\nAnthí Vasilantonáki\n\nMaria Oikonomidou\n\nWhat Are the Most Popular Sports in Greece?\n\nGreece has a rich history in sports and it is known for its contribution to the historic Olympic Games, as well as modern-day sporting events.\n\nFrom football to volleyball, Greeks thrive in both individual and team sports. They put their country on the map!\n\nOther popular sports in Greece include swimming, weight lifting, wrestling, sailing, rowing and diving.\n\nDo you follow any Greek sports?
