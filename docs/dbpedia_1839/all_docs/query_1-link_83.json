        "text": "We identify the oldest goalscorers in European Championship history, including a record broken at Euro 2024 this summer.\n\nEuropean Championship Oldest Scorers: Top 10\n\nLuka Modric (Croatia vs Italy on 24 June 2024) – 38 years, 289 days old.\n\nIvica Vastic (Austria vs Poland on 12 June 2008) – 38 years, 257 days old.\n\nGoran Pandev (North Macedonia vs Austria on 13 June 2021) – 37 years, 321 days old.\n\nZoltán Gera (Hungary vs Portugal on 22 June 2016) – 37 years, 61 days old.\n\nGareth McAuley (Northern Ireland vs Ukraine on 16 June 2016) – 36 years, 194 days old.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo (Portugal vs France on 23 June 2021) – 36 years, 138 days old.\n\nLuka Modric (Croatia vs Scotland on 22 June 2021) – 35 years, 286 days old.\n\nAndriy Shevchenko (Ukraine vs Sweden on 11 June 2012) – 35 years, 256 days old.\n\nGiorgos Karagounis (Greece vs Russia on 16 June 2012) – 35 years, 102 days old.\n\nJan Koller (Czech Republic vs Turkey on 15 June 2008) – 35 years, 77 days old.\n\nChristian Panucci (Italy vs Romania on 13 June 2008) – 35 years, 62 days old.\n\nLuka Modric – 38 years, 289 days old\n\nCroatia vs Italy, 24 June 2024\n\nLuka Modric broke the record for the oldest player to score at the Euros with his opener against Italy on 24 June 2024.\n\nHis goal came just 33 seconds after he’d seen a penalty saved by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in Leipzig.\n\nIt was to turn out to be an unhappy occasion for Modric, however, with a last-gasp Italian equaliser sending Croatia home. At least he’s got this record to show for his efforts at Euro 2024.\n\nIvica Vastic – 38 years, 257 days old\n\nAustria vs Poland, 12 June 2008\n\nIvica Vastic became the oldest player to score at a European Championship, with the Austrian forward aged 38 years and 257 days old when scoring at Euro 2008 versus Poland. That record was taken by Modric, 16 years later.\n\nVastic’s 93rd-minute penalty proved to be one of few positives for co-hosts Austria at the tournament, as it was their only goal and secured their solitary point of the finals before a disappointing group stage exit.\n\nHis substitute appearance in this match proved to be his 50th and final cap for Austria, as he scored with his final shot for his national team and broke a European Championship record in the process.\n\nGoran Pandev – 37 years, 321 days old\n\nNorth Macedonia vs Austria, 13 June 2021\n\nGoran Pandev scored North Macedonia’s first ever goal at a UEFA European Championship tournament thanks to his 28th-minute strike versus Austria in their opening game of Euro 2020.\n\nThe veteran forward became the second-oldest player to score at a Euros aged 37 years and 321 days old, but his goal was in vain as the Austrians eventually prevailed 3-1 in Bucharest.\n\nThings didn’t improve for North Macedonia as they exited the tournament in the group stage with zero points.\n\nZoltán Gera – 37 years, 61 days old\n\nHungary vs Portugal, 22 June 2016\n\nZoltán Gera scored the opening goal in one of the most entertaining matches at Euro 2016, with Hungary and Portugal sharing the points in a 3-3 group-stage draw in Lyon.\n\nThe draw helped Hungary top Group F, while Portugal qualified as one of the best third-place teams before going on to seal a famous tournament win in the final against hosts France.\n\nGera’s 19th-minute strike in this game meant he became the second-oldest player to score at a European Championship at the time, but he was knocked down a place five years later following Pandev’s strike for North Macedonia at the delayed Euro 2020.\n\nThe former Fulham and West Brom midfielder scored 26 times for Hungary over his career, but this would be his only strike scored in a major international tournament.\n\nGareth McAuley– 36 years, 194 days old\n\nNorthern Ireland vs Ukraine, 16 June 2016\n\nThis was Northern Ireland’s first ever goal at a European Championship, with Euro 2016 their first appearance. Having lost their Group C opener 1-0 to Poland, they bounced back on Matchday 2 against Ukraine.\n\nGareth McAuley headed in Oliver Norwood’s free-kick early in the second half in Lyon on route to an eventual 2-0 victory.\n\nIt was an impressive feat for the 36-year-old, who was the first Northern Ireland player to score at a major tournament since Colin Clarke at the 1986 World Cup (vs Spain). The defender scored nine times in 80 caps for his country overall.\n\nNorthern Ireland made it to the last 16 of Euro 2016 before losing 1-0 to Wales.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo – 36 years, 138 days old\n\nPortugal vs France, 23 June 2021\n\nCristiano Ronaldo ended Euro 2020 as joint-top goalscorer alongside Czech striker Patrik Schick, with five goals each. Goals four and five of the tournament came in Portugal’s 2-2 draw with France in the group stage, making him the fifth oldest scorer at a European Championship (36 years, 138 days old).\n\nRonaldo, the all-time European Championship top scorer, is also the fifth-youngest goalscorer at a UEFA Euro finals ahead of the 2024 edition.\n\nThe Portuguese legend could go on to break the record as the oldest scorer at a European Championship should he play and net at Euro 2024."
