        "text": "Manchester United and Arsenal, the only two remaining English sides, will be looking to avoid the big guns in the draw for the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League, which takes place in Nyon (Switzerland) on Thursday 10:30am GMT.\n\nManchester United qualified as Group H winners and so are seeded in the draw but they still could be drawn against the big sides, while Arsenal finished as runners-up and like United could face the top guns especially Barcelona (third time in the past four seasons) in the knockout stages. On the other hand, Chelsea became the first holders to be eliminated in the group stages, while Manchester City were completely knocked out of Europe as they ended bottom of their group.\n\nGroup Winners: Paris Saint-Germain, Schalke, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United\n\nGroup Runners-Up: Porto, Arsenal, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, Valencia, Celtic, Galatasaray\n\nBelow we have a look at each of the above 16 teams in detail..\n\nPARIS SAINT-GERMAIN\n\nCountry: France\n\nCoach: Carlo Ancelotti\n\nKey Player: Zlatan Ibrahimovic\n\nOther Star Players: Thiago Silva, Ezequiel Lavezzi & Javier Pastore\n\nRising Star: Marco Verratti\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Semi-final 1995\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Arsenal, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, Valencia, Celtic, Galatasaray\n\nChances: PSG are one of the richest clubs in the world and have ambitions to win the Champions League this term. If striker Ibrahimovic can continue his superb form from the group stages, it might just happen.\n\nPrediction: Quarter-Finals\n\nSCHALKE 04\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nCoach: Jens Keller\n\nKey Player: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar\n\nOther Star Players: Benedikt Howedes, Lewis Holtby & Kyriakos Papadopoulos\n\nRising Star: Julian Draxler\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Semi-final 2011\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, AC Milan, Shakhtar Donetsk, Galatasary, Valencia, Celtic, Real Madrid\n\nChances: The Germans were unbeaten through their group which consisted the likes of Arsenal, Olympiakos and Montpellier, which shows they are not a team to be taken for granted. One their day they could upset the big guns.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nMALAGA\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nCoach: Manuel Pellengrini\n\nKey Player: Isco\n\nOther Star Players: Joaquin, Martin Demichelis & Eliseu\n\nRising Star: Francisco Portillo\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Debutants\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Arsenal, Shakhtar Donetsk, Celtic, Galatasaray\n\nChances: Have been very impressive so far in their debut season in the Champions League, but their inexperience in the competition may prove costly in the knockout stages.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nBORUSSIA DORTMUND\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nCoach: Jurgen Klopp\n\nKey Player: Marco Reus\n\nOther Star Players: Roberto Lewandowski, Mats Hummels & Mario Gotze\n\nRising Star: Moritz Leitner\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1997\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, Arsenal, AC Milan, Shakhtar Donetsk, Valencia, Celtic,Galatasaray\n\nChances: The reigning Bundesliga champions have very much caught the eye in the group stages after finishing at top of the Group of Death and are the team to beat. Considered as the dark horses for the title.\n\nPrediction: Quarter-Finals\n\nJUVENTUS\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nCoach: Antonio Conte\n\nKey Player: Arturo Vidal\n\nOther Star Players: Andrea Pirlo, Gianluigi Buffon & Giorgio Chiellini\n\nRising Star: Paul Pogba\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1985, 1996\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Valencia, Celtic, Galatasaray\n\nChances: The reigning Serie A champions remained unbeaten in the group stages and topped their group by winning on the final matchday. The Italians are expected to step it up when the competition resumes in February.\n\nPrediction: Quarter-Finals\n\nBAYERN MUNICH\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nCoach: Jupp Heynckes\n\nKey Player: Franck Ribery\n\nOther Star Players: Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger & Philipp Lahm\n\nRising Star: David Alaba\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1974, 1975, 1976, 2001\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, Arsenal, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, Celtic,Galatasaray\n\nChances: The current Bundesliga leaders ended as the beaten finalists last season and will be looking to make amends for it. They have been in fine form so far and are one of the favourites to lift the trophy in May.\n\nPrediction: Semi-Finals\n\nBARCELONA\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nCoach: Tito Vilanova\n\nKey Player: Lionel Messi\n\nOther Star Players: Andres Iniesta, Xavi & Sergio Busquets\n\nRising Star: Christian Tello\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1992, 2006, 2009, 2011\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk, Arsenal, Galatasaray, AC Milan\n\nChances: The Catalans were the pre-tournament favourites to win the competition and there has been very little so far to suggest that they won’t win it this term. Vilanova has done brilliantly since taking over from Pep Guardiola in the summer.\n\nPrediction: Winners\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED\n\nCountry: England\n\nCoach: Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nKey Player: Wayne Rooney\n\nOther Star Players: Robin van Persie, Nemanja Vidic & Antonio Valencia\n\nRising Star: Rafael\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1968, 1999, 2008\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, Valencia, Celtic\n\nChances: Unlike last season, United have marched pretty easily into the knockout stages and with Van Persie & Rooney both in form they are a team to fear. Surely one of the contenders for the title.\n\nPrediction: Semi-Finals\n\nPORTO\n\nCountry: Portugal\n\nCoach: Vitor Pereira\n\nKey Player: Jackson Martinez\n\nOther Star Players: Joao Moutinho, Lucho Gonzalez & Nicolas Otamendi\n\nRising Star: James Rodriguez\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winner 1987, 2004\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Schalke, Malaga, Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United\n\nChances: The Portuguese champions have gone all the way before but its very unlikely it will happen again this season. They have a very good squad with some very talented players but its highly unlikely they will trouble the big teams.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nARSENAL\n\nCountry: England\n\nCoach: Arsene Wenger\n\nKey Player: Santi Cazrola\n\nOther Star Players: Jack Wilshere, Thomas Vermaelen & Lukas Podolski\n\nRising Star: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Runner-up 2006\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Malaga, Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona\n\nChances: The Gunners have had a stuttering season both domestically and in Europe – especially at home. They will need to improve a lot in the second half of the season if they want to be genuine title contenders.\n\nPrediction: Quarter-Finals\n\nAC MILAN\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nCoach: Massimiliano Allegri\n\nKey Player: Stephan El Shaarawy\n\nOther Star Players: Philippe Mexes, Ricardo Montolivo & Kevin-Prince Boateng\n\nRising Star: Mattia De Sciglio\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United\n\nChances: Like Arsenal, the Rossoneri are struggling this term domestically and in Europe. They are not the force of the old, although their pedigree and experience in this competition means they should not be taken lightly.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nREAL MADRID\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nCoach: Jose Mourinho\n\nKey Player: Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nOther Star Players: Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos & Mesut Ozil\n\nRising Star: Raphael Varane\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United\n\nChances: Its been over a decade since Real Madrid last won the Champions League and the boss Mourinho has never appeared more determined to win the tournament for the club this season. With the team they have they are regarded as the joint favourites alongside Barca.\n\nPrediction: Runners-Up\n\nSHAKHTAR DONETSK\n\nCountry: Ukraine\n\nCoach: Mircea Lucescu\n\nKey Player: Luiz Adriano\n\nOther Star Players: Darijo Srna, Willian & Fernandinho\n\nRising Star: Henrikh Mkhitaryan\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Quarter-final 2011\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Malaga, Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United\n\nChances: Like Dortmund, Shakhtar are another side that have grabbed the attention of many in the group stages. They are the ones who dumped Chelsea out of the tournament and a side very few people would want to face in the knockout stages.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nVALENCIA\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nCoach: Ernesto Valverde\n\nKey Player: Roberto Soldado\n\nOther Star Players: Jonas, Sofiane Feghouli & Adil Rami\n\nRising Star: Daniel Parejo\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Runner-up 2000, 2001\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Dortmund, Juventus, Manchester United\n\nChances: The Spaniards have been very impressive in the group stages with their star striker at the top of his game but do not appear equipped for a really extended run in competition this season.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nCELTIC\n\nCountry: Scotland\n\nCoach: Neil Lennon\n\nKey Player: Giorgos Samaras\n\nOther Star Players: Fraser Forster, Victor Wanyama & Gary Hooper\n\nRising Star: Anthony Watt\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1967\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Málaga, Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United\n\nChances: Had little hopes of making it through to the knockout stages after being grouped with Barcelona, Benfica and Spartak Moscow but they did it. Anything else from now will be a bonus for the Scottish champions.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nGALATASARAY\n\nCountry: Turkey\n\nCoach: Fatih Terim\n\nKey Player: Burak Yilmaz\n\nOther Star Players: Felipe Melo, Nordin Amrabat & Hamit Altintop\n\nRising Star: Semih Kaya\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Semi-finals 1989\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Málaga, Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona\n\nChances: Snatched the second spot from CFR Cluj on the final matchday. Like Celtic, anything else they achieve from now on will be a bonus for the Turkish side and very few teams will fancy making the trip to the intimidating Turk Telekom Arena in Istanbul.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nJoachim Low’s Germany will have to defy history if they are to beat Italy today at the National Stadium in Warsaw and set up a repeat of the 2008 final against Spain on Sunday.\n\nGermany boss Joachim Low knows his side must disturb Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo, who was allowed to dictate play in Italy’s quarter-final victory over England. Low said: “He’s the Italian player who directs the game. “We have to disturb him, stop him playing, get in his way, and think of a way how we can do better than Italy in midfield.” But Low has also called for focus from his own side, believing they must play to the strengths which has seen them win all their games so far. “It’s a confidence thing. We have to be cheeky, strong and brave,” he said. “We have to concentrate and work very hard. I don’t think we have to worry too much about our opponents. We have to impose our own ideas.”\n\nDespite never having lost a competitive match against Germany, Italy coach Cesare Prandelli knows it will be tough to beat their opponents. “The Germans, alongside Spain, are the favourites to win the European Championship,” he said. “I’m not the first to discover how good they are, they are playing very well.”\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nGermany\n\nLow has received a boost with the news influential midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger will be fit after shrugging off a sore ankle following the 4-2 win over Greece. But he has decisions to make after surprisingly leaving Arsenal new-boy Lukas Podolski, Thomas Muller and tournament top scorer Mario Gomez out of his starting line-up against Greece. He is expected to restore the trio to his side, despite Marco Reus and Andre Schurrle adding pace to the German attack in their place, while Miroslav Klose scored against the Greeks.\n\nItaly\n\nFor Italy, the team’s medical staff are doing their bets’ to get injured Daniele De Rossi, Ignazio Abate and Giorgio Chiellini back to fitness for the game, with the trio undergoing intensive physiotherapy. Midfielder De Rossi and right-back Abate were substituted with muscle injuries in Sunday’s quarter-final penalty victory over England, while Chiellini missed the game with a thigh problem. Chiellini has since returned to training and will probably come in for Leonardo Bonucci if he is fit, while Antonio Nocerino will likely replace De Rossi should he miss out. Coach Prandelli has a big decision to make if Abate fails to recover as fellow right-back Christian Maggio is suspended.\n\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\n\nPlayed – 30\n\nGermany Wins – 7\n\nDraws – 9\n\nItaly Wins – 14\n\nFORM GUIDE\n\nGermany – WWWWW\n\n22-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Germany 4-2 Greece\n\n17-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Denmark 1-2 Germany\n\n13-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Netherlands 1-2 Germany\n\n09-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Germany 1-0 Portugal\n\n31-May-12 – Friendly – Germany 2-0 Israel\n\nItaly – DWDDL\n\n22-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – England 0-0 Italy\n\n18-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Italy 2-0 Ireland\n\n14-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Italy 1-1 Crotia\n\n10-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Spain 1-1 Italy\n\n01-Jun-12 – Friendly – Italy 0-3 Russia\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger (Germany)\n\nThe 27-year-old Bayern Munich midfielder has been struggling with an ankle injury and looked uncharacteristically wasteful in possession against Greece in the quarter-finals. With the Italian midfield packed with skillful passers of the ball, the German star will be under pressure to cover plenty of ground and set the rhythm and tempo of the team in the middle of the park.\n\nMesut Ozil (Germany)\n\nThe Real Madrid playmaker has had a quiet tournament until the quarterf-inal game against Greece where he showed his true best setting up two goals. The former Werder Bremen midfielder is the main creator of chances in this German lineup. His smart passes and brilliant through balls would be the key to unlocling the solid Italian defence. If he is kept quiet then the Italian would have a real chance.\n\nAndrea Pirlo (Italy)\n\nThe former AC Milan player has been Italy’s best player in the tournament so far and he singled handedly dominated the previous game against England. He has been an inspirational and the guiding force behind the Italian success till now. He has been dictating the game from his defensive midfield posituon and has shown his quality time and time again. Another classy performance today and his side will have a huge chance of upsetting the favourites.\n\nMario Balotelli (Italy)\n\nThe Manchester City forward was one of the star performers for Italy during their penalty shoot-out win over England. The former Inter Milan striker has shown he has got the talent and potential to be the best in the world but has failed to perform on a consistent basis. His pace, his ability to get in the right position at the right time and to shoot from distance, can trouble the opposition but he needs to work more on his finishing and convert the chances he gets.\n\nPROBABLE LINEUPS\n\nGermany (4-2-3-1): Manuel Neuer; Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Holger Badstuber, Philipp Lahm (C); Sami Khedira, Bastian Schweinsteiger; Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski; Mario Gomez.\n\nThe Germans are set to bring back their three big guns Mario Gomez, Thomas Muller and Lukas Podolski after handing them rests in the quarter-finals against Greece. Joachim Low is set to stay with his 4-2-3-1 formation that has worked like a dream till now. However, the only worry is a nagging injury to the experienced Bastian Schweinsteiger, however, the German campaign has declared that the midfielder will play through the pain and is expected to take the field against Italy today.\n\nItaly (4-3-1-2): Gianluigi Buffon (C); Ignazio Abate, Andrea Barzagli, Leonardo Bonucci, Federico Balzaretti; Claudio Marchisio, Andrea Pirlo, Daniele De Rossi; Thiago Motta; Mario Balotelli, Antonio Cassano.\n\nThe Italians will start with the same 4-3-1-2 formation that started against England in the previous game. However they might have to make a couple of chances with Ignazio Abate and Daniele De Rossi struggling with injuries. If Abate fails to recover in time then Prandelli will have to change back to the 3-man defence with second-choice right Christian Maggio suspended. Antonio Nocerino may come in for De Rossi, if he fails to pass the fitness test. Thiago Motta will be another chance in the side and will replace Ricardo Montolivo in the lineup.\n\nMATCH ODDS\n\nGermany 5/6 Draw 12/5 Italy 18/5\n\nPREDICTION\n\nIf last night’s drama was anything then this match is going to be a cracker of a game. Germany have been the team of the tournament, while Italy have been the best defensive side. The fact that Germany had 48 hours more than Italy to prepare and rest for this match is a huge advantage. The Italians were too good against an average England side, but beating the pre-tournament favourites – who have won all their matches so far – is a huge task. The history is on Italy’s side and if they are able to get past Germany today then it will surely be an upset.\n\nPredicted Score – Germany 2-1 Italy\n\nThe pre-tournament favourites Germany take on massive outsiders Greece in the quarter-finals in Gdansk today – with the Germans looking to join Portugal in the final four, while the Greeks will be hoping for an upset.\n\nGreece provided arguably the biggest shock of Euro 2012 so far by jumping from the foot of Group A to second with a 1-0 win over Russia in their final group game. And their unexpected title triumph at Euro 2004 is another indication of how dangerous the Greeks can be. Greece coach Fernando Santos believes the example of eight years ago is giving his squad belief as they enter the knockout stages. “I would like to seize this opportunity to say what an inspiration for us the 2004 success is,” said Santos. “We showed great resolution and strength and we were written off before that tournament, but we still reached the final and won the cup. That should be a source of inspiration for us this time.”\n\nIt may need more than inspiration if they are to beat Joachim Low’s team. Germany are the only team at Euro 2012 to win all their matches so far – even also winning all 10 qualifying games. Although Low is not taking Greece for granted, he remains convinced his team will progress to the semi-finals. “Logically we are favourites, but we can deal with that,” he said. “But remember – knockout games have their own character so it will not be the case that the favourite automatically reaches the next round. We saw that in the group when Russia were the big favourites and we have all seen what happened. But if we show all of our inner strength and belief, then we are strong enough to beat the Greeks of course. I am convinced we will win.”\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nGermany\n\nGermany welcome Jerome Boateng back after he missed the 2-1 win over Denmark due to suspension. Lars Bender should therefore return to the bench despite scoring the winner against the Danes. The rest of the team is expected to be the same, meaning the likes of Miroslav Klose, Mario Gotze and Toni Kroos must continue to wait for a start.\n\nGreece\n\nFernando Santos must do without skipper Giorgos Karagounis and left-back Jose Holebas, who were both suspended in the win over Russia. Georgios Tzavelas had already usurped Holebas in the left-back slot so will continue, but the likes of Sotiris Ninis, Grigoris Makos and Giorgos Fotakis will battle for Karagounis’ midfield berth.\n\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\n\nPlayed – 8\n\nGermany Wins – 5\n\nDraws – 3\n\nGreece Wins – 0\n\nFORM GUIDE\n\nGermany – WWWWL\n\n17-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Denmark 1-2 Germany\n\n13-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Netherlands 1-2 Germany\n\n09-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Germany 1-0 Portugal\n\n31-May-12 – Friendly – Germany 2-0 Israel\n\n26-May-12 – Friendly – Switzerland 5-3 Germany\n\nCzech Republic – WLDWD\n\n16-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Greece 1-0 Russia\n\n12-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Greece 1-2 Czech Republic\n\n08-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Poland 1-1 Greece\n\n31-May-12 – Friendly – Greece 1-0 Armenia\n\n26-May-12 – Friendly – Greece 1-1 Slovenia\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nMesut Ozil (Germany)\n\nThe Real Madrid star has had a relatively quiet tournament so far with just one assist to his name, but Joachim Low has backed the playmaker to “explode” in the knockout rounds just like he did in the World Cup two years ago. Indeed, a return to the form he showed in South Africa which earned him a move to Real Madrid may just be what is needed to get the zip back into Germany’s build-up play in the final third, which has at times looked a bit lifeless.\n\nMario Gomez (Germany)\n\nComing from a highly successful season with Bayern Munich and with already three goals in three group games, the German striker is the favourite to win the Golden Boot award. But with Greece boasting a record of the least number of goals conceded during qualifying, the former Stuttgart striker will have to be at his very best to score today and help his side reach the semi-finals.\n\nKyriakos Papadopoulos (Greece)\n\nWith Greece most likely to sit on the backfoot and defend rather than playing some free-flowing, eye-catching attacking football, their defending will have to be up to the task to give them any chance of pulling off an upset against the slick passing game of the Germans. The 20-year-old Schalke defender, Papadopoulos was reliable at the back in the group stages and his physical strength and ability to read the game will aid him well in his duel with Mario Gomez.\n\nGeiorgios Samaras (Greece)\n\nThe Celtic striker was impressive against the Russians the other night, holding up the ball and going past the defenders with ease. Often played out on the wide, the 27-year-old put in some dangerous crosses and also tracks back to help out his defenders. Although he hasn’t scored in the tournament yet, he remains an integral part of the Greece as justified by manager Fernando Santos by handing him a start in all the games till now.\n\nPROBABLE LINEUPS\n\nGermany (4-2-3-1): Manuel Neuer; Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Holger Badstuber, Philipp Lahm; Sami Khedira, Bastian Schweinsteiger; Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski; Mario Gomez.\n\nGermany have stuck with their best players all through the tournament and coach Joachim Low will not wish to mess with the winning eleven much. Bayern stopper Neuer will start in between the sticks and will be hoping to deal with the Greek attacks. The defence will see the return of Jerome Boateng in place of Lars Bender after serving his suspension, despite the later scoring the winning goal against Denmark. Hummels, Badstuber and Lahm are expected to make up the rest of the defence. Khedira and Schweinsteiger will protect the defensive line while also assisting the attacking midfield trio of Muller, Ozil and Podolski. Star striker Mario Gomez, who is the joint topscorer in the competition with 3 goals and will get the nod again ahead of the veteran Miroslav Klose.\n\nGreece (4-2-3-1): Michalis Sifakis; Vasilis Torosidis, Kyriakos Papadopoulos, Avraam Papadopoulos, Giorgos Tzavelas; Kostas Katsouranis, Giannis Maniatis; Dimitris Salpigidis, Giorgos Fotakis, Geiogios Samaras; Theofanis Gekas.\n\nGreece coach Fernando Santos will be without captain Giorgos Karagounis and Jose Holebas, who are both suspended, while goalkeeper Kostas Chalkias is unlikely to recover from his hamstring injury in time. Sifakis who has yet to concede a goal in his two appearances since coming on as a substitute against the Czech Republic will start in the between the sticks for the Greeks. The back four of Torosidis, Kyriakos Papadopoulos, Avraam Papadopoulos and Tzavelas will guard the goal ahead of Sifakis. Katsouranis and Maniatis will play in the midfield protecting their defence as well as assisting in the attack. Ninis might get a chance over here with skipper suspended but Santos may go for the experience of Fotakis to play behind the striker Gekas and in between Samars and Salpigidis.\n\nMATCH ODDS\n\nGermany 3/10 Draw 21/5 Greece 10/1\n\nPREDICTION\n\nThe Germans are known for their free-flowing attacking football, while the Greeks are known to be defensively very sound and they showed it against the Russians. It’s going to be a contest of attack versus the defence, as the Germans would look to attack from the first minute and look score an early goal, while the Greeks would look to defend and try to hit their opponents on the counter or from the set-peices. Greece have some very hardworking players who gave their best to win the match against Russia, but the Germans have talent and quality in their side alongwith some game changing individuals and that might be too much for Fernando Santos’ men to handle.\n\nPredicted Score – Germany 2-0 Greece\n\nWith the group stages done & dusted on Tuesday and the knockout stages to begin from today, with the Czech Republic v Portugal match at the National Stadium in Warsaw, we have decided to create the team of the group stages. A team consisting of the best performers in every position from the three group game. Here is the team below using the 4-2-3-1 formation..\n\nIKER CASILLAS (GK) – SPAIN\n\nCasillas has been by far the most consistently performing goalkeeper in the this year’s European Championship. The Real Madrid shot stopper has been an inspirational skipper and has led his country from the front making several very important saves in the three games he has featured in. The most important of all his saves has to be the terrific save from a Ivan Rakitic close range header in the second half against Croatia which kept Spain in that game and most importantly in the tournament.\n\nTHEODOR GEBRE SELASSIE (RB) – CZECH REPUBLIC\n\nSelassie has been one of the gems of the the tournament. The right back from African origin was completely unknown outside Czech Republic before the European Championships, but with his energetic performances for his country in the three group games so far he will surely attract many and bigger European clubs in the summer. The Slovan Liberec full back has impressed everyone with his pace and work rate on the right side of the Czech defence and also created his side’s second goal in the important win over Greece.\n\nPEPE (CB) – PORTUGAL\n\nPepe has been the rock in the center of the defence for both Portugal and Real Madrid this season. The former FC Porto man has been a determined customer at the back and at times has been seen shouting out instructions to his fellow defenders and kept them well organised. He is not only a very good defender but also an attacking threat from the set-pieces. He scored his side’s opener from a corner against Denmark in the second group game and was very close of doing the same against Germany in the first game.\n\nMATS HUMMELS (CB) – GERMANY\n\nIf Pepe was the reason for Portugal’s success from the so called Group of Death, then the Dortmund defender has been Germany’s reason for success in the same group. Hummels has been an imperious presence in the heart of the German defence that have conceded just two goals in the three group games they have played. His aerial ability and no-nonsense defending has been the keys aspects to his defending. At the same time he is a threat from the set-pieces and is also good going forward with ball, as he showed against the Dutch.\n\nJORDI ALBA (LB) – SPAIN\n\nThe Valencia full back, who is expected to sign for Barcelona in the summer, has been one of the players to watch during the European Championship and he has not let anyone down by his performances. The fast improving left back has been very impressive for La Furia Roja in Poland/Ukraine, as he has been a threat to deal with when going forward, and at the same time solid at the back. He has been the important part of the Spanish defence that has kept two cleans during the group stages and will be hoping to do the same against France in Donetsk.\n\nSTEVEN GERRARD (CM) – ENGLAND\n\nIn the absence of Wayne Rooney, all eyes were on Gerrard on how he would lead his team in the European Championship and he has done a brilliant job. Played in a bit defensive role by Roy Hodgson, the Liverpool skipper has shown his class in all the three group games he has played in, and has led his team from the front with some clam performances. He has been the inspiration figure on and off field, and at the same time has been his side’s and tournament’s top goal creator with three assists. His good form in the knockout stages will be the key for England success in the competition.\n\nCLAUDIO MARSCHISIO (CM) – ITALY\n\nComing from winning the Serie A with Juventus, Marschiso has carried his club form for his country in the European Championship. The center midfielder has been Italy’s top performer in Poland/Ukraine. The Juventus man has put in energetic displays in all the three group games but the game against Spain stands out. He showed some great stamina to run the Spainish defence to the end and force a late save from Casillas. At the same time, he was solid in the midfield and often stole possession for his side.\n\nCRISTIANO RONALDO (AML) – PORTUGAL\n\nRonaldo was not at his best against Germany in the opening group game and missed a couple of golden chances against Denmark in the second game but when it mattered the most, he scored twice against the Dutch in the final game and guided his country to the last eight. The Real Madrid star has been a constant threat to defences in this tournament with his pace, trickery and his ability to shoot from distance. The Czech defence will have to be at their best to deal with threat possessed by Ronaldo, and if they succeed in keeping him quite then Petr Cech’s side are in with a huge chance.\n\nZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC (AMC) – SWEDEN\n\nEven though Sweden are not through to quarter finals, Ibrahimovic makes the team as he has been the most valuable player of the tournament. Playing just behind the main striker, the AC Milan hitman has been very impressive for Sweden by scoring goals and creating chances for his teammates. He scored a goal against Ukraine but it was all overshadowed by Andriy Shevchenko’s brace and Ukraine’s victory, he was his team’s best player against England and scored most probably the goal of the tournament against France which won him the Man of the Match in the final group game. Sweden ended at the bottom of Group D, but Ibrahimovic has been one of star performers this summer.\n\nANDRES INIESTA (AMR) – SPAIN\n\nCesc Fabregas grabbed the headlines for scoring the equaliser against Italy, Fernando Torres did the same after scoring a brace against Ireland and Jesus Navas got took the back pages with the winner against Croatia, but the real hero in all three three matches was Andres Iniesta. The Barcelona playmaker has been Spain’s unsung hero in the tournament so far. The Spainiard has been superb throughout the tournament creating numerous chances for his teammates and has hardly misplaced a pass. He has adapted very well to the advanced role when Vicente Del Bosque has opted to play without a striker.\n\nMARIO GOMEZ (ST) – GERMANY\n\nGomez has scored 41 goals this season for Bayern Munich and he has continued his club form for his country in the European Championships. The German striker has been deadly in front of goal and leads the race for the Golden Boot award with three goals in three matches so far. The former Stuttgart striker scored a powerful header that turned out to be the winner against Portugal in the first game and then scored a brilliant brace against the Netherlands in the second game that guaranteed his side a place in the quarter finals.\n\nSUBSTITUTES\n\nManuel Neuer (Germany), Stipe Pletikosa (Croatia), Alvaro Arbeloa (Spain), Olof Mellberg (Sweden), Joleon Lescott (England), Fabio Coentrao (Portugal), Vaclav Pilar (Czech Republic), David Silva (Spain), Mario Mandzukic (Croatia), Alan Dzagoev (Russia), Bastian Schweinsteiger (Germany), Karim Benzema (France).\n\nNetherlands meet Germany in today’s do-or-die Group B clash in Kharkiv, knowing that another defeat will mean the end an early exit in the group stages for the 2010 FIFA World Cup finalist.\n\nBert van Marwijk’s side have to pick themselves up after Saturday’s 1-0 defeat to Denmark, in a match the Dutch had largely dominated but were very wasteful. They now have to beat rivals Germany at the Metalist Stadium, then Portugal on Sunday to be sure of qualifying from the group, which has been dubbed ‘The Group of Death’. While the Dutch will be fighting for survival, Germany know another win will put them in the quarter-finals following their 1-0 victory over Portugal.\n\nClashes between Holland and neighbours Germany are amongst the biggest in world football and always tend to be spicy affairs and there will be no quarter given when they renew their historic rivalry. This will be the eighth time the teams have met at a finals tournament and the fifth occasion at a European Championship. Germany have three wins against two for the Dutch and two draws. And there have been some classic matches between these countries such as the 1974 World Cup final, when Johan Cruyff’s team scored an early penalty, only to lose 2-1 to the Germans in Munich. The Euro ’88 semi-final in Hamburg was a special moment for the Oranje Army as Marco Van Basten scored a last minute winner to beat the hosts 2-1. And then there was the tempestuous 1990 World Cup second round encounter at the San Siro in Milan which Germany won 2-1, after their striker Rudi Voeller and Dutch stalwart Frank Rijkaard were sent-off before Andreas Brehme curled home a late winner.\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nNetherlands\n\nNetherlands have received a boost with the return to fitness of veteran defender Joris Mathijsen ahead of Wednesday’s crucial Euro 2012 showdown with Germany. The Malaga centre-back missed the 1-0 defeat to Denmark with a hamstring problem but looks set to return to the Dutch lineup in place of Ron Vlaar. Midfielder Wesley Sneijder should feature despite sustaining a minor knock, while coach Bert van Marwijk will have to make a very big decision of either playing Robin van Persie or Klaas-Jan Huntelaar or maybe both.\n\nGermany\n\nOn the other hand, Germany boss Joachim Low has no pressing injury concerns but could make changes to liven up his attack after a low-key performance against Portugal. Andre Schurrle, Marco Reus and Mario Gotze are all vying for starting berths, with Lukas Podolski or Thomas Muller likely to make way.\n\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\n\nPlayed – 38\n\nNetherlands Wins – 10\n\nDraws – 14\n\nGermany Wins – 14\n\nFORM GUIDE\n\nNetherlands – LWWLL\n\n09-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Netherlands 0-1 Denmark\n\n02-Jun-12 – Friendly – Netherlands 6-0 Northern Ireland\n\n31-May-12 – Friendly – Netherlands 2-0 Slovakia\n\n26-May-12 – Friendly – Netherlands 1-2 Bulgaria\n\n23-May-12 – Friendly – Bayern Munich 3-2 Netherlands\n\nGermany – WWLLW\n\n09-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Germany 1-0 Portugal\n\n01-Jun-12 – Friendly – Germany 2-0 Israel\n\n26-May-12 – Friendly – Switzerland 5-3 Germany\n\n01-Mar-12 – Friendly – Germany 1-2 France\n\n16-Nov-11 – Friendly – Germany 3-0 Netherlands\n\nKEY PLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nWesley Sneijder (Netherlands)\n\nThe Inter Milan playmaker was impressive in the first game against Denmark but yet he was on the losing side. Sneijder was Netherlands’ star at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa helping them reach the finals, but ever since the final against Spain he has not produced the same kind of form. He has been troubled by injuries and has had a very poor season for Inter Milan. If Netherlands have to progress from the so called ‘Group of Death’ then Sneijder will have to be in top form today.\n\nArjen Robben (Netherlands)\n\nLike Sneijder, Arjen Robben is very important to Netherlands success this summer. The Bayern Munich winger reached the Champions League final and ended runners-up in the Bundesliga this season, but the reality is that Robben has been less than impressive. The former Chelsea man missed a penalty against his old employees in the Champions League and was too selfish the other day against Denmark. Robben will have to be at his very best against a very strong German defence and especially Philipp Lahm to help his country reach the quarter finals.\n\nMesut Ozil (Germany)\n\nThe Real Madrid playmaker has had a very successful season both personally and as a team. The 23-year-old has made his mark in world football and is now one of the best attacking midfielders around. The elegant midfield provides guile and craft to the German midfield and his probing passes are sure to test the Dutch backline, which looked vulnerable against Denmark. The former Werder Bremen star hardly losses possession and enjoyed a lot playing in the possession-heavy style adopted by Joachim Low.\n\nMario Gomez (Germany)\n\nThe Spanish origin striker is Joachim Low’s first choice striker ahead of the veteran Miroslaw Klose and is expected to start again today after the scoring the winner against Portugal the other night. The former Stuttgart hitman has been in top goal-scoring form for Bayern Munich this season scoring 41 goals 52 matches and has also netted ten goals for his country in the past one. His ability of being in the right position and at the right time will be the key and a threat to deal with for the Dutch defence.\n\nPROBABLE LINEUPS\n\nNetherlands (4-2-3-1): Maarten Stekelenburg; Gregory van der Wiel, Joris Mathijsen, Johnny Heitinga, Jetro Willems; Nigel De Jong, Mark van Bommel (C); Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie; Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.\n\nWith Joris Mathijsen fit, the Malaga man will be back in the side in place of Ron Vlaar, who had a poor game, in the center of the defence alongside Heitinga. The young Jetro Willems impressed many the other day and he will keep his position in the side with Van der Wiel on the right. The experience of Nigel De Jong will see him get the nod ahead of Kevin Strootman along side Mark van Bommel, while Ibrahim Afellay who had a poor game against Denmark in the Group B opener, will be demoted to the bench and Robin van Persie will be moved out on the left wing. The top scorer in the qualifiers, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will lead the lineup for the Dutch with Wesley Sneijder just playing behind him and Arjen Robben on the right wing.\n\nGermany (4-2-3-1): Manuel Neuer; Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Holger Badstuber, Philipp Lahm(C); Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira; Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski; Mari Gomez.\n\nJoachin Low said in his pre-match press conference that he is not afraid to chance winning team, but I don’t think there will be any chances for this game especially against the Dutch. This is Germany’s best team and Low will stick with it. Gomez will lead the line with Muller and Podolski join him from the wings. Ozil will operate just behind them and will try and find the killer through balls. Schweinsteiger and Khedira will play center of midfield connecting the defence and attack. Lahm will again start on the left-back with Jerome Boateng on the right-back and the pair of Hummers and Badstuber, who looked well organised against the Portuguese, in the heart of the defence. The ever safe hands of Manuel Neuer will be in the between the sticks for the Germans.\n\nMATCH ODDS\n\nNetherlands 19/10 Draw 23/10 Germany 7/5\n\nPREDICTION\n\nWith the Dutch having to win this game to stay in the tournament, they will attack from the start. On recent form, one has agree the Germans are favourites to win and with a settled side & an opening game victory under their belt, the German players will play with less pressure compared to their opponents. The Dutch will need their star players to perform and play as a team. The 2010 FIFA World Cup finalist have a huge task of beating Germany – who have one the most settled units and the best defence in the tournament – and so we are going for a narrow win for the 2008 UEFA European Championship finalist.\n\nPredicted Score – Netherlands 1-2 Germany\n\nMunich is the place to be on Saturday night when two giants of the game, Chelsea and Bayern Munich go head to head against each other with European glory up for grabs in the Champions League final at the Allianz Arena.\n\nBayern Munich, who are only the 4th team in the history of the Champions League to make it through to the finals in their own backyard, have won four European cups compared to Chelsea’s none. Both teams have had fair share of pain heartbreaks, as far as this competition is concerned, and on both occasions, it was Manchester United that inflicted all the pain. While the Bavarians will never forgot what happened in the dying minutes of the final in 1999 at Nou Camp, the Blues still have nightmares of John Terry’s fateful slip during the penalty shoutout in 2008.\n\nBoth sides earned surprise victories over their fancied Spanish opponents in the semi-finals, thus killing the dream of an El-Classico Champions League final. Munich have history on their side as the record twenty-two-time Bundesliga winners march into their 9th Champions League final, while Chelsea on the other hand have made it to the big stage only once previously. Bayern have a good record against English sides in the competition, winning 7 of the 17 ties against teams from the United Kingdom. Although they have lost the final to English opposition on two occasions, against Aston Villa in 1982 and Manchester United.\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nChelsea\n\nChelsea will have defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill available for selection, with the duo appearing to be winning their fitness battles following hamstring injuries. The news will come as a boost to interim boss Roberto Di Matteo, as regular defenders John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic are serving suspensions along with Ramires and Raul Meireles. Winger Florent Malouda (hamstring) is a doubt, while Didier Drogba should get the nod up front ahead of Fernando Torres.\n\nBayern Munich\n\nBayern Munich will be without suspended trio Holger Badstuber, David Alaba and Luiz Gustavo. Defender Breno (knee) is out and Daniel Van Buyten is short of match fitness, so Anatoliy Tymoshchuk and Diego Contento are likely to deputise for Badstuber and Alaba respectively. Thomas Muller should get a recall to the starting XI, with Toni Kroos dropping into a deeper midfield role alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger.\n\nROAD TO MUNICH\n\nChelsea\n\n13 Sep – Group E – Chelsea 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Torres, Mata)\n\n28 Sep – Group E – Valencia 1-1 Chelsea (Lampard)\n\n19 Oct – Group E – Chelsea 5-0 Genk (Meireles, Torres(2), Ivanovic, Kalou)\n\n01 Nov – Group E – Genk 1-1 Chelsea (Ramires)\n\n23 Nov – Group E – Bayer Levekusen 2-1 Cheksea (Drogba)\n\n06 Dec – Group E – Chelsea 3-0 Valencia (Drogba(2), Ramires)\n\n21 Feb – Rnd of 16, 1st Leg – Napoli 3-1 Chelsea (Mata)\n\n14 Mar – Rnd of 16, 2nd Leg – Chelsea 4-1 Napoli (Drogba, Lamaprd, Terry, Ivanovic)\n\n27 Mar – Quarter Finals, 1st Leg – Benfica 0-1 Chelsea (Kalou)\n\n04 Apr – Quarter Finals, 2nd Leg – Chelsea 2-1 Benfica (Lampard, Meireles)\n\n18 Apr – Semi Finals, 1st Leg – Chelsea 1-0 Barcelona (Drogba)\n\n24 Apr – Semi Finals, 2nd Leg – Barcelona 2-2 Chelsea (Ramires, Torres)\n\nBayern Munich\n\n14 Sep – Group A – Villarreal 0-2 Bayern Munich (Kroos, Rafinha)\n\n27 Sep – Group A – Bayern Munich 2-0 Manchester City (Gomez(2))\n\n18 Oct – Group A – Napoli 1-1 Bayern Munich (Kroos)\n\n02 Nov – Group A – Bayern Munich 3-2 Napoli (Gomez(3))\n\n22 Nov – Group A – Bayern Munich 3-1 Villarreal (Ribery(2), Gomez)\n\n07 Dec – Group A – Manchester City 2-0 Bayern Munich\n\n22 Feb – Rnd of 16, 1st Leg – Basel 1-0 Bayern Munich\n\n13 Mar – Rnd of 16, 2nd Leg – Bayern Munich 7-0 Basel (Robben(2), Muller, Gomez(3))\n\n28 Mar – Quarter Finals, 1st Leg – Marseille 0-2 Bayern Munich (Gomez, Robben)\n\n03 Apr – Quarter Finals, 2nd Leg – Bayern Munich 2-0 Marseille (Olic(2))\n\n17 Apr – Semi Finals, 1st Leg – Bayern Munich 2-1 Real Madrid (Ribery, Gomez)\n\n25 Apr – Semi Finals, 2nd Leg – Real Madrid 2-1 Bayern Munich (Robben)\n\nOVERALL FORM\n\nChelsea – WLWLW\n\n13 May – Premier League – Chelsea 2-1 Blackburn\n\n09 May – Premier League – Liverpool 4-1 Chelsea\n\n05 May – FA Cup Final – Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea\n\n03 May – Premier League – Chelsea 0-2 Newcastle\n\n29 Apr – Premier League – Chelsea 6-1 QPR\n\nBayern Munich – LWWLW\n\n12 May – DFB Pokal Final – Dortmund 5-2 Bayern Munich\n\n05 May – Bundesliga – FC Koln 1-4 Bayern Munich\n\n28 Apr – Bundesliga – Bayern Munich 2-0 Stuttgart\n\n26 Apr – Champions League SF, 2nd Leg – Real Madrid 2-1 Bayern Munich\n\n21 Apr – Bundesliga – Werder Bremen 1-2 Bayern Munich\n\nHEAD TO HEAD\n\n12 Apr 05 – Champions League QF, 2nd Leg – Bayern Munich 3-2 Chelsea\n\n06 Apr 05 – Champions League QF, 1st Leg – Chelsea 4-2 Bayern Munich\n\nPROBABLE LINEUPS\n\nChelsea\n\nDavid Luiz and Cahill have been training this week and Chelsea will hope the centre-backs can make it in time for Saturday. Di Matteo needs at least one of the pair to be fit to avoid a major catastrophe. If they do make it through, Jose Bosingwa and Ashley Cole will start on either side, with Jon Obi Mikel holding fort ahead of the backline. Frank Lampard will drop into a deeper midfield role and although Michael Essien is available, the Ghanaian is unlikely to garner a starting berth. With Malouda suffering from an injury too, Di Matteo must decide f he wants to go with both Dider Drogba and Fernando Torres, with the Spaniard starting on the right. Juan Mata will once again be the creative force in the centre while Salomon Kalou is expected to take the left-wing position.\n\nProbable XI (4-3-3): Cech; Bosingwa, David Luiz, Cahill, Cole; Mikel, Lampard(c), Mata; Kalou, Torres, Drogba.\n\nBayern Munich\n\nThe suspensions could actually force Heynckes into a more attacking line-up although Bayern will start in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation. Antoliy Tymoschuk might move into the centre-back position alongside Jerome Boateng, with Danijel Pranjic also an option. For the full-back positions, Rafinha could come in at right-back while Phillip Lahm moves to the left or the manager could stick with Lahm on the right and bring in Diego Contento on the left. Bastian Schweinsteiger will be the general in midfield and he is expected to have Kroos for company. With Kroos dropping deep, Muller looks set to join the attack, sandwiched between Ribery and Robben and behind Gomez.\n\nProbable XI (4-2-3-1): Neuer; Rafinha, Boateng, Tymoschuk, Lahm(c); Kroos, Schweinsteiger; Robben, Muller, Riberty; Gomez.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nMario Gomez – Bayern Munich\n\nHe has been phenomenal for Bayern Munich this season. He has completely defined the world ‘goalscoring machine’. The German international who joined Bayern from Stuttgart in 2009, has managed to score 40 goals this season out of which 12 have come in the Champions League.\n\nDidier Drogba – Chelsea\n\nHe is the man for the big games. Drogba loves playing high-profile matches as it tends to raise his game. He was Chelsea’s key man against Barcelona in the first leg where he scored the all important winner. This may be his last game for Chelsea and he would love to finish his Blues career on a high by winning the coveted Champions league trophy.\n\nArjen Robben – Bayern Munich\n\nThe ex-Chelsea plays has been Bayern’s star since joining the Reds from Real Madrid. The ex-Chelsea man, who scored the all important goal from the penalty in the 2nd leg of the semi finals at the Bernabeu, would be eager to showcase his skills and talent against his former employees.\n\nTHE STADIUM\n\nHome to FC Bayern München and TSV 1860 München, the Fußball Arena München will host the 2012 UEFA Champions League final following a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee in January 2009. The showpiece will take place on Saturday 19 May 2012.\n\n• The Fußball Arena München took less than three years to build from start to finish, and was completed on 30 April 2005. It was conceived following a referendum in October 2001 when 65.8% of Munich’s citizens voted to construct a new arena rather than regenerate the Olympiastadion, venue for the 1972 summer Olympic Games and previous home of Bayern and 1860 München.\n\n• A year to the day after that vote, work commenced on the stadium, including the construction of the unique exterior. The Fußball Arena München’s transparent outer wall is comprised of foil panels which are lit from the inside and can change colour depending on who is playing; red for Bayern, blue for 1860 München and white for Germany.\n\n• The arena opened its doors to competitive football on 5 August 2005 when a full house of 66,000 watched Bayern defeat VfL Borussia Mönchengladbach 3-0. In January 2006, city authorities approved a 3,901 increase in capacity which means the stadium can now house 69,901 supporters. Some of these reside in standing terraces which are created for domestic games by converting 10,400 seats in each of the north and south stands.\n\n• Located on Werner-Heisenberg-Allee – named after famous German atomic physicist and 1932 Nobel Prize for Physics winner Werner Heisenberg – the Fußball Arena München played host to the opening game of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Germany’s 4-2 victory against Costa Rica. A further five matches in the tournament were played at the arena, including France’s 1-0 semi-final win against Portugal.\n\n• While some 106 VIP boxes, 400 media seats and 11,000 parking spaces cater for those attending the game, the players make do with two warm-up rooms, a nursery and four changing rooms – one each for Bayern, 1860 München and their respective opponents.\n\n• The Olympiastadion hosted three European Champion Clubs’ Cup finals. Trevor Francis’s strike earned Nottingham Forest FC victory against Malmö FF in 1979 and there was also only one goal in it 24 years later when Olympique de Marseille beat AC Milan to claim the inaugural UEFA Champions League title. In 1997 two Karl-Heinz Riedle efforts set BV Borussia Dortmund on course for a 3-1 win against Juventus.\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nTHE MATCH BALL\n\nThe official match ball for the 2012 UEFA Champions League final – the adidas Finale Munich – has been officially presented at the venue for this season’s showpiece match, the Fußball Arena München.\n\nAs the 12th adidas supplied match ball for a UEFA Champions League final, the adidas Finale Munich will be the first “final ball” to be used throughout the UEFA Champions League knockout stages and not just for the final itself.\n\nThe ball’s graphics are inspired by the shape of the Fußball Arena München and they enhance its iconic starball logo design, while the blue and acqua tones are strongly influenced by the reflection of modern local architectural materials, which also build the UEFA Champions League Final Munich 2012 brand identity.\n\nThe adidas Finale Munich makes its debut tonight when the UEFA Champions League resumes with two of the eight round of 16 ties – the first leg matches between Olympique Lyonnais and APOEL FC, and Bayer 04 Leverkusen and FC Barcelona. The UEFA Champions League final takes place in the Bavarian city on Saturday 19 May.\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nTHE TROPHY\n\nThe current UEFA Champions League trophy, which stands 73.5cm tall and weighs 8.5kg, is the sixth overall and dates back to 2006.\n\nA rule introduced in the 1968/69 season allowed the cup to become the property of any club which won the competition five times or three years in a row. That means Real Madrid CF, AFC Ajax, FC Bayern München, AC Milan and, since 2005, Liverpool FC all have an original in their trophy rooms. Under new regulations, any club which wins the trophy three consecutive times or five times in total receives a special mark of recognition, with the club then starting a new cycle from zero.\n\nThe trophy that the winning captain will lift at Wembley Stadium in London is the fifth version of the current design. After Real Madrid were allowed to keep the original in 1967, UEFA’s General Secretary, Hans Bangerter, decided to create a new design and called in a local specialist in Berne, Jürg Stadelmann.\n\n“My father Hans and I went along to Herr Bangerter’s office and covered the whole floor with the drawings,” recalled Stadelmann. “He made comments like, ‘The Bulgarians would like the bottom of that. The Spaniards would like that, but the Italians would prefer that and the Germans would go for this bit.’ We put the design together like a jigsaw puzzle. It was a design constituted of many parts yet I like it and I think everyone in football likes it as well.\n\n“I remember that it had to be finished before 28 March,” Stadelmann added, “because I was getting married and taking my wife on a ten-day boat trip to Los Angeles. The trophy took 340 hours to make. I did the finer work, then it was finished off by the engraver, Fred Bänninger. On time, I am glad to say.”\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nTHE REFEREE\n\nPedro Proença of Portugal will take charge of Saturday’s UEFA Champions League final between FC Bayern München and Chelsea FC at the Fußball Arena München (Munich, 20.45CET).\n\nProença, a financial director from Pinhal Novo, will be assisted by countrymen Bertino Miranda and Ricardo Santos. The fourth official will be Carlos Velasco Carballo from Spain. The two additional assistant referees are Jorge Sousa and Duarte Gomes, while reserve assistant referee – Tiago Trigo – completes the lineup of the officiating team.\n\nThe 41-year-old Proença, who made his international debut in 2003, has officiated more than 65 UEFA matches in a refereeing career that has been on the rise ever since he took charge of UEFA European Under-19 Championship final in 2004.\n\nHe refereed the 2007 and 2010 Portuguese Cup finals and also ran the rule over two FC Porto successes in the domestic Super Cup in August 2003 and 2006. The Portuguese took charge of two UEFA EURO 2008 qualifiers and was at the 2009 UEFA European U21 Championship, overseeing three games as a referee and acting as fourth official in Germany’s 4-0 final defeat of England.\n\nPromoted to UEFA’s Elite category at the start of 2009/10, he oversaw four games in that season’s UEFA Champions League group stage and five in the 2010/11 competition, including Manchester United FC’s defeat of FC Schalke 04 in the semi-final second leg.\n\nProença has handled five UEFA Champions League matches since the beginning of the current season, including, among others, the round of 16 second leg between FC Internazionale Milano and Olympique de Marseille, as well as two UEFA Europa League matches, including the first leg of the quarter-final between FC Schalke 04 and Athletic Club.\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nTHE AMBASSADOR\n\nHaving lifted the European Champion Clubs’ Cup for FC Bayern München, scored in Germany’s victorious FIFA World Cup final in Munich and been brought up just 50km away there are few people better placed than Paul Breitner to act as ambassador for the 2012 UEFA Champions League final at the Fußball Arena Munchen on 19 May.\n\nThe former Real Madrid CF midfielder saw it all in a glittering 13-year player career, but the return of club football’s biggest game to Munich for a fourth time, and first at the new stadium, is a source of great pride for the 60-year-old. “The Champions League final next year in May is the highlight of the whole season, for the city of Munich and for Bayern,” he told UEFA.com. “The people of Munich, including me, think we have the most beautiful city in the world.”\n\nAs well as being a tourist attraction, Munich is also a footballing hotbed and the Fußball Arena Munchen, which opened in 2005 and houses almost 70,000 spectators for Bundesliga matches, is home to both TSV 1860 München and Bayern, Germany’s most successful club. And it was with the three-time European champions that Breitner first made his name in some 41 years ago.\n\n“In 1970, it was a time of evolutionary change at Bayern Munich. Uli Hoeness, the current club president, and I arrived at the right time to grow into the team, to learn from Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller. We went through a development phase which led us, after our fourth season, to play in our first European Cup final, winning against Atlético Madrid in a replay after drawing the first match.”\n\nThat victory came in May 1974, two years after Breitner had helped West Germany win the UEFA European Championship, and two months before he lifted the World Cup. He would go on to become one of his country’s most successful footballers, winning five Bundesliga titles with Bayern and two Spanish championships with Madrid. In 1982 he became only the third player after Brazilians Vavá and Pelé to score in two World Cup finals (an elite club since joined by Zinédine Zidane).\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nBETTING ODDS\n\nMatch Result\n\nBayern Munich – 5/6\n\nDraw – 14/5\n\nChelsea – 16/5\n\nCorrect Score\n\nBayern Munich 1-0 – 11/2\n\nDraw 0-0 – 10/1\n\nChelsea 1-0 – 10/1\n\nBayern Munich 2-0 – 7/1\n\nDraw 1-1 – 11/2\n\nChelsea 2-0 – 20/1\n\nBayern Munich 2-1 – 15/2\n\nDraw 2-2 – 16/1\n\nChelsea 2-1 – 12/1\n\nBayern Munich 3-0 – 14/1\n\nDraw 3-3 – 66/1\n\nChelsea 3-0 – 50/1\n\nBayern Munich 3-1 – 12/1\n\nDraw 4-4 – 150/1\n\nChelsea 3-1 – 33/1\n\nHalf Time/Full Time\n\nBayern Munich / Bayern Munich – 15/8\n\nDraw / Bayern Munich – 7/2\n\nChelsea / Bayern Munich – 20/1\n\nBayern Munich / Draw – 16/1\n\nDraw / Draw – 5/1\n\nChelsea / Draw – 16/1\n\nBayern Munich / Chelsea – 28/1\n\nDraw / Chelsea – 17/2\n\nChelsea / Chelsea – 13/2\n\nUnder/Over 2.5 Goals\n\nUnder 2.5 Goals – 4/5\n\nOver 2.5 Goals – 10/11\n\nBoth Teams to Score\n\nYes – 5/6\n\nNo – 5/6\n\nTo Lift the Trophy\n\nBayern Munich – 4/9\n\nChelsea – 7/4\n\nGoalscorer\n\nNo Chelsea Goalscorer – 11/8\n\nDidier Drogba – 11/4\n\nMario Gomez – 11/4\n\nFernando Torres – 3/1\n\nArjen Robben – 7/2\n\nNo Bayern Munich Goalscorer – 7/2\n\nFranck Ribery – 4/1\n\nFrank Lampard – 9/2\n\nNils Petersen – 9/2\n\nDaniel Sturridge – 9/2\n\nWinning Margin\n\nBayern Munich by Exactly 1 Goal – 5/2\n\nChelsea by Exactly 1 Goal – 11/2\n\nBayern Munich by Exactly 2 Goals – 4/1\n\nChelsea by Exactly 2 Goals – 14/1\n\nBayern Munich by 3 or more Goals – 11/2\n\nChelsea by 3 or more Goals – 40/1\n\n(source: skybet.com)\n\nPREDICTION\n\nThe defensive absentees could make this game an open game of football and as with any final one can only hope this doesn’t turn out to be one boring cagey affair. Drogba will be a threat for any centre-back pairing that Bayern start with but at the same time the same thing can be said about Mario Gomez at the other end. With John Terry suspended and both David Luiz and Gary Cahill just coming back from injuries it would be very difficult for the Blues to defend against a very strong and attacking Bayern side. Expect Bayern to attack a lot, while Chelsea would be happy to hit the hosts on the counter.\n\nBayern Munich 2-1 Chelsea"
