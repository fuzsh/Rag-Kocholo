It's unreferenced, and I'm not aware of reliable sources collating clubs in this way. In any case, it is actually only a partial list of clubs that have played at the ground. Eldumpo (talk)\n\nDoesn't seem notable. -Koppapa (talk)\n\nUnreferenced and, more importantly, pointless! TonyStarks (talk)\n\nNow subject to an AfD. Cloudz679\n\nCan anyone verify whether this guy has actually played for Lithuania? Transfermarkt seems to think so, but I doubt that can be considered reliable. J Mo 101 (talk)\n\nNot even Transfermark does it say that he played for Lithuania... – Kosm1fent I am an idiot. Kthanks. 14:14, 11 June 2012 (UTC)\n\nThis (linked from the RSSSF international matches page) would say not. Unless it spells his name significantly differently, anyway. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nCheers for that, looks pretty conclusive to me. Sent it to AfD. J Mo 101 (talk)\n\nThis site says he played twice at U-21 level. He is not listed on www.eu-football.info. -- Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nIn Transfermarkt, on players main page it says \"Lithuania 4 (0)\" but they don´t have match reports to back it up: match reports... That is what I say when I say that only the part backed by match reports (which are admin inserted) is usefull. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nHi, I just declined a CSD on Stoke City LFC, but I'm not sure if the team is notable. Do you guys have a guideline for football teams? P.S. Hope you guys took a break from the Euros to watch the Australia v Japan World Cup qualifier – absolutely bizarre refereeing in the second half! Cheers, Jenks24 (talk)\n\nIf the club has played in either the FA WSL or FA Women's Premier League then the club is 100% notable. For future reference see Wikipedia:WikiProject Football/Notability. And no I did not see the match but I kept track of it. Very good from what I saw from the stats. Japan should have won. --Arsenalkid700 (talk)\n\nThere is a persistent editor MonkeyKingBar (talk · contribs), who keeps reverting edits made I have made to 1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season the last few days. I've tried to notify him about why his changes are unacceptable via his talkpage and Talk:1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season (on the basis that what he has added is largely unsourced, a Goal.com poll holds no significance and if he was going to add an 'Aftermath' section, he may as well add a 'Background' one for balance -- yet it would probably be unsourced too and could jeopardise it's GA standing), yet the user refuses to agknowledge. After doing some digging, he has some previous; could it just be that he is a sock puppet? -- Lemonade51 (talk)\n\nFollowing today's Announcement that Green is pushing ahead with Luqudation there is a discussion on the talk page of what to do once or when this happens.\n\nThere have already been unsourced changes made to this article and its disambiguation page. It will need watching, and possibly protecting, until the situation becomes clearer. Britmax (talk)\n\nRangers page is already long term protected. It appears to be happening now anyway. [1]. There was debate on whether it could be said its a company Liqudating or whether it's the club but sources now clearly indicate club and new name. It's just a matter of best way I to handle it. More input eithier way would be helpful. Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nFor the time being it doesn't make sense to use the past tense, or declare the club \"defunct\", anyway. If it were as straightforward as that the newspapers still wouldn't be in overdrive churning out potential future scenarios. I've reverted recent changes to that effect: this is going to need very close monitoring even above the semiprotection. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nI may be reading the situation incorrectly but I believe that the club itself isn't being liquidated, the company that owns it will be - which means the club will remain intact? GiantSnowman\n\nThat's why this is going to be a problem the club an company are intertwined since the late 1800s. Things weren't official when the club was formed but were later.\n\nSources dont distinquish the two at the moment see link above. Also its the club holds the licence which it looses and also see new name. The main problem as I see it is there will be two camps one who deems it as a continuation and one who see the old as defunct and a new club formed. Sources indicate the later but there are so many different precidents. Most of the English clubs were Dealt with as a continuation and kept same page, however the Scottish ones have mostly become separate clubs such as Airdrie and Gretna. I actually don't have a preference but we must go with ultimately what the sources say once this sorry saga has concluded. Going to be tricky either way. Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nthis BBC piece from yesterday quotes one of the administrators who says \"the history of the club remains with the club, so the club moves from Rangers Plc into the new company and all of the titles and 140-year history will remain with the club.\" GiantSnowman\n\nAnd now do you see the problem. In that way the club is still liable for previous issues which is what we have been debating about. . We need to wait and see but most say club only ones directly quoting the admins say that. Also half the statements issued by those twits have been false. For instance player contracts don't transfer and no club has ever been allowed in the Spl following Liqudation contrary to their statements. . They make statements that are lies so will need to wait and see. It is possible for the deal to transfer history and them still be a new club. Airdrie we and most deal with as a new club but they see themselves as a continuation of Airdrieonians. Now given the club hold the licence not the company in that way they would still have it which is why the previous bidder wanted to do it that way however he would still of had a claim with HMRC for the yet announced tax case. The issue is whether we accept it as a new one or keep as the old we are going to have edit wars eithier way and source won't help because they contradict each other. Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nThere's little point in us arguing over what it means. Nobody actually knows what it means, which is why the Scottish media is going crazy right now. Suffice to say that we should be conservative in our approach and not going altering the main article (especially the lead) in light of every new news conference held by the administrators, potential buyers, supporters' groups et cetera. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nAgree just needs to be kept a very close eye on. And honestly if we believed everything those admins said we would be in trouble. They don't know what's happening any better than we do. Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nI probably should have brought this up before my project on Indian football but never late then ever. Anyway in India we have the national league (I-League) which has 14 clubs but all 14 clubs also play in there respective state leagues in which most of them also use there first-team players in. Now I am wondering how I should write it on a player article. For example Dempo S.C. play in the national I-League and the state league (Goa Professional League)... now what if one of the players play a match in the national league and state league. Do I state the state league stats as Dempo B (to indicate state league stats) in the infobox and career stats box or do I not put anything in the infobox (cept for caps and goals in national league) and add an extra column in the career statistics box saying state league. And just so people dont get confused on what I am asking...\n\nAnd then for career stats box do I keep it like this....\n\nClub Season League Cup AFC Total Apps Goals Assists Apps Goals Assists Apps Goals Assists Apps Goals Assists Dempo 2011-12 0 0 0 0 0 0 — — — 0 0 0 Career total 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nor should I do this...\n\nClub Season League State League Cup AFC Total Apps Goals Assists Apps Goals Assists Apps Goals Assists Apps Goals Assists Apps Goals Assists Dempo 2011-12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 — — — 0 0 0 Career total 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThank you. Cheers. And Sorry for the complicated question. --Arsenalkid700 (talk)\n\nThere is a similar situation in Brasil where beside the national leagues (exemple, the top one Campeonato Brasileiro Série A) you have the state championships (exemple: Campeonato Carioca). What was agreed here was to add only the national league stats in the infobox, and if necessary to make a separate stats table in the article where the state stats are also included. See exemple Bruno Mezenga and see how the national stats are the ones included in the infobox, while a separate column is added in a career statistics table for the state championships.\n\nIs the Indian case similar to this Brazilian one? FkpCascais (talk)\n\nI think what you've done in the second career stats box is best; include the state league info separately. However, do you have sources for his assists in all those competitions? Eldumpo (talk)\n\nAssists should never be included in stats tables. Ever. GiantSnowman\n\nWhy not, if they're suitably sourced? Eldumpo (talk)\n\nBecause not every source agrees on number of assists, and stats are not available for the vast majority of players. GiantSnowman\n\nI totally agree. I see a lot of people relying on the Premier League fantasy football site for assist figures as well, and they give assists to the guy who wins a penalty! There is no universal definition of an assist, and different sites all have different figures. Get rid. – PeeJay\n\nSorry for not replying back earlier (work) but the way it works in India is weird. Dempo, Salgaocar, Sporting Goa, Churchill, East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, and Prayag United are the only clubs to admitidly play in the national I-League and the first-team in the state leagues as well. United Sikkim, Shillong Lajong, ONGC and Air India are unknown (lack of match reports from there respective state leagues. And Pune FC and Mumbai FC have admitted to using \"B\" teams like FC Barcelona B. So basically what I plan to do is only have \"B\" team caps and goals for players with Pune and Mumbai (as they admit they do that; and of course source will back it up) then for clubs in a state league and unknown I will not add to infobox and just write those stats in the carrer stats box. This shall be applied to all Indian footballers but of course I still need the opinion of someone else. So if I did this career box like Giantsnowman wanted...\n\nClub Season League State League Cup AFC Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Mohun Bagan 2011-12 8 0 6 2 0 0 — — 14 2 Career total 8 0 6 2 0 0 0 0 14 2\n\nor should I do one with the state league name in them like this...\n\nClub Season League State League Cup International Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals India I-League West Bengal Federation Cup AFC Total Mohun Bagan 2011-12 8 0 6 2 0 0 — — 14 2 Career total 8 0 6 2 0 0 0 0 14 2\n\n--Arsenalkid700 (talk)\n\nI think I remember verbatim a British TV commentator saying \"Laudrup, Laudrup, still Laudrup, still Laudrup, Michael Laudrup... brilliant.\" as Laudrup scored a goal for Denmark. I loved the commentary so much, I memorised it. I think.\n\nIt was probably in the 1986 World Cup, but I can't find the goal or the footage. I thought it might have been one of the six Denmark got against Uruguay, but the YouTube video I found with British voiceover wasn't what I was after. Can anyone help? --Dweller (talk)\n\nThis? Thought it was Barry Davies at first. -- Lemonade51 (talk)\n\nI don't think it was Barry Davies, he has a far more distinctive voice. – PeeJay\n\nYeah, I assumed it was Davies, but his voice is recognisable as you say. Turns out it was David Icke doing the commentating. Lemonade51 (talk)\n\nLemonade, still Lemonade, still Lemonade... brilliant. If we give you some CO2, maybe you'll be fizzy, but either way, you're brilliant. And my memory has held that almost perfectly for 26 years. --Dweller (talk)\n\nI remember another commentary of exactly the same goal with the commentator saying \"this boy's got class\" maybe on the other channel? Valenciano (talk)\n\nOn ITV, they said \"The boy's a genius!\", might have been that. Lemonade51 (talk)\n\nJust a note, Euro 2012 has been fully protected. There is an unprotection case at WP:RRP. Adam4267 (talk)\n\nSince the new leagues are official should Mexican Primera División be moved to Liga MX and should the Liga de Ascenso be moved to ASCENSO MX or should new pages be created. GoPurple'nGold24\n\nThe name of the articles should reflect what the reliable English-language sources call the leagues. Soccerway refer to it as Primera Division; if the sources do change over time then it may be appropriate to move them. Eldumpo (talk)\n\nThe league name change corresponds to changes in the format as well. Reliable sources (e.g., Medio Tiempo) are already using the new name Liga MX. I think we need to have a strong link between the Primera history and the new Liga MX - so maybe moving the page is best. Perhaps we should wait until it is close to the start of the new season? Jogurney (talk)\n\nThe official FMF website officially announced it. [2] GoPurple'nGold24\n\nWe should wait and see what the English-language sources (e.g. Soccerway, ESPN) are calling them before we think of moving the pages. Eldumpo (talk)\n\nI agree that the English-language media have been slow to use the new name (the league doesn't begin until July), but the Spanish-language media certainly have (including all of the Spanish-language US media outlets like Univision, ESPN Deportes, FOX Sports). I'm okay with moving the articles now, but it won't hurt to wait a few weeks and see if the English-language sources start picking up on the new name (I wouldn't worry about Soccerway - that isn't a reliable source, is it?). Jogurney (talk)\n\nI believe Soccerway to be a reliable source, and others at Footy have said the same. Have you any reason to think otherwise? Eldumpo (talk)\n\nI don't know if Soccerway is a reliable source, but seeing that it was a statistics database, I was unsure. I'm willing to consider it as one if there is a concensus that it meets the standard, but I would weigh more heavily what sources like ESPN or Fox Sports call the new league than Soccerway. Jogurney (talk)\n\nJust a passing thought - all current men's national teams are at 'xxxx national football team', while the women's teams are at 'xxxx women's national football team'. Is there an argument saying that we should move all the 'national football team' to 'xxxx men's national football team'? It could certainly be argued that this naming policy is non-neutral? Looking at the five principles of naming - Recognizability; Naturalness; Precision; Conciseness; Consistency - I'd say that the current situation favours naturalness and conciseness, while changing to include men would favour precision and consistency. Recognizability, I'm less sure - arguably, as clearer, \"men's national team\" is more recognizable; however, as \"national team\" is generally recognised as being men, I'm not sure if this point holds.\n\nFrankly, I think they should be changed - what do others think? I realise that this may have impacts on other national sport articles too. Pretty Green (talk)\n\nDue to the prevalence of the men's game compared to women's, it should stay as it is. GiantSnowman\n\nTechnically women are not excluded from playing in a national side (as far as I know at least), it's just that none do. The Women's national side does preclude men so is specifically different. Changing the titles as suggested would be akin to changing the Olympics to be the 'Able-bodied Olympics' to fit in with the convention of the Paraolympics. Bladeboy1889 (talk)\n\nBladeboy makes a great point. I don't think there's anything that says women can't play in the England national football team (for example), whereas men are specifically excluded from playing in women's teams. – PeeJay\n\nI think technically FIFA does ban women from playing in men's teams (at least national teams) after a few certain high-profile female players said they wanted to try to join men's teams. Can't remember the names (I think Brazilian, Mexican and/or Swedish?) and sources though. But I agree that in most countries, the national football team is the men's team. Chanheigeorge (talk)\n\nI think you're right - certainly in England mixed football cannot be played over the age of 11 or 13 by the rules of the Football Association. Number 57\n\n[3], 4.1: \"For FIFA men's competitions, only men are eligible to play. For FIFA women's competitions, only women are eligible to play.\" Chanheigeorge (talk)\n\n<reduce indent> They are indeed separate, and over a certain age men and women cannot play together in FIFA football. Equally, the Olympics/Paralympics analogy doesn't work - they already have different names. I also wouldn't want to invoke any changes to named competitions or clubs eg FIFA World Cup, which is the name of the men's tournmanet.\n\nHowever, England national football team is not an official name, it's a description. The FA, for example, just use England Football Team, or 'Men's senior' team to differentiate from other national selections. On FIFA's website, you click on England and then select 'men'. The only serious argument against the change, I'd have thought, would be WP:COMMONNAME - which GiantSnowman sort of invokes. I agree that under commonname we wouldn't probably change it. However, this is just one of the principles of naming that Wikipedia follows, and one we often ignore (eg Manchester United Football Club rather than Manchester United). It is a guide, not a rule. I'd suggest that under the majority of Wikipedia's naming principles, and under the principle of general objectivity, these should be changed to \"...men's national football/soccer team\" Pretty Green (talk)\n\nWe use a particular per-country naming format (i.e. with the \"F.C.\" for British clubs) because it's the least-worst way of enforcing some degree of consistency above what would be a difficult situation if we defaulted to an unmodified COMMONNAME. There does not appear to be such an argument in this case, as we already have a consistent presentation. As the men's international game is in general vastly more popular than the women's at this point in time, the least-worst option is to use the present format. Any argument to revisit that would need to be accompanied by some evidence to the contrary. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nSurely we don't have consistency across the two genders though? --Pretty Green (talk)\n\nBe wary of mistaking \"consistency\" for \"equality\". We are not obliged to assign equal weight to each sex's football, but due weight. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nI'm not convinced, but I do get the point - there's clearly no appetite for the idea, which is how Wikipedia ultimately works! Cheers for your comments. Pretty Green (talk)\n\nFWIW I agree with you, Pretty Green, but Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) also makes a decent point about due weight. As long as women's football articles do start to get due weight around here. Incidently, no-one should assume that men's football ascended naturally to its current dominant position; women's football (in the UK) was forcibly suppressed in the 1920s. It was one thing for them to draw huge crowds when they were raising money for injured \"servicemen\" - quite another when they started supporting striking miners! Clavdia chauchat (talk)\n\nHi, would someone mind keeping an eye out at Jordan Henderson; there are some IPs and a newly-registered user who seem intent on adding an unsourced table listing each of the player's England caps. And there was this addition by one of the IPs at Simon Mignolet too. Cheers, Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nIs that something which is not allowed. I've seen it in other articles and personally don't like it. However, I didn't realise there was actually any reason not to have it. Adam4267 (talk)\n\nInternational goals tables are relatively common. They're not too impractical when one considers that the vast majority of international players never score more than a dozen goals for their country (if they score any). Caps is a different story, especially when accompanied by all the flagcruft that Just Won't Die. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nPersonally I do not see a problem listing all international caps. The record of most caps is below 200, and only a small percentage of players go over 100. Verifiable and manageable. I have also found it weird to just have tables of listing international goals, seems to me quite biased towards attackers and against defenders! Chanheigeorge (talk)\n\nGood lord, the idea of having a table in an article detailing every one of a player's professional appearances is insane! Can you imagine what the article on Terry Paine would look like..........? -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nOr Tony Ford/Steve Claridge? I'm not keen on listing every internatioanl match on a player's article either really. --Pretty Green (talk)\n\nI put a table listing all the caps for both David Healy and Andy Townsend. The Townsend one is a bit out of fashion and has an unnecessary flag column on the end which I can't be bothered to remove but yeah, cannot see how they can possibly be a bad thing. They go to the trouble of stitching together a cute little hat for the occasion so a table recording them all is no bother at all.--EchetusXe\n\nI personally think that if these tables have are hidden so they only take up one line there's nothing wrong with them. Every match a player plays in is probably listed somewhere so its feasible to do for most players. Altough I personally wouldn't go to the trouble of making one and don't think they add much, I don't think there is anything wrong with them if someone wants to add one that's ok by me. I actually quite like the idea of a table with every players' club appearance though. If it was formatted the same way as David Beckham's Awards £ England templates. So you have one line; David Beckham club appearances. Then that opens up and you have each season which can be opened up further. So it doesn't take up to much space. Also these could have goals, cards, sub appearances etc for each match. For most modern players these things are all notable and widely reported on, so I don't see the problem with it. Of course you dont have to have it, it would be optional. So please don't say to me, \"What about player X who made loads of appearances.\" Adam4267 (talk)\n\nWe don't hide tables in the article body. See MOS:COLLAPSE. So that particular way to duck the issue is off the cards. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nMy mistake, I didnt know about that policy. I thought it was ok because I'd seen it before in other articles. I think, seeing as we have club career statistics, that we should have international statistics listed in some way. Some articles just have a very small list with the number of apps made in each year. Adam4267 (talk)\n\nFor me a table listing caps/goals year-by-year, as Adam refers to, is the way to go, as it is analogous with the club career stats tables. Whereas, listing each international cap leaves a disparity between what we list; it seems unequitable to list each international cap while not listing each club app (not that I would advocate that). Personally, I'd forward this type of format for career stats sections. Cheers, Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nCan somebody undo the redirect on 2012 Nehru Cup because when you click it, it just leads to Nehru Cup. The tournament dates have already been announced thus meaning that an article on the 2012 tournament can be created. Cheers. --Arsenalkid700 (talk)\n\nDone. Not sure if I did it the proper way but you can go ahead and create the article now. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nI've gone a step further and restored the first version of the article which has an infobox and a small intro. Have a look and please fix/update/reference the article. Take care. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nAccording to a previous AfD, the article was redirected due to a lack of reliable sources and being WP:TOOSOON for a stand-alone article. Are there any sources now, other than those which got the article redirected? [4] – Kosm1fent\n\nWhen proposing an article about a non-notable football player to get deleted .. should it be done through AfD or PROD? I don't see the difference and the list of WP:FOOTY has both. I know unreferenced articles about living people go through BLPProd but I'm talking about referenced ones that don't meet notability guidelines. I thought AfD was the way to go since PROD just seems like it can be removed without discussion if someone disagrees with it. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nPROD, then AfD if the PROD is removed. Cheers, Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nThanks. I just had a look at WP:PROD and WP:AfD (which I probably should have done before asking) .. and you're right, PROD first! TonyStarks (talk)\n\nPersonally, the only articles I'm taking directly to AfD are borderline WP:N cases per WP:COMMONSENSE, as common sense doesn't fare well at a PROD and will certainly be rejected. Cheers. – Kosm1fent\n\nWatching the video link given above from the 1986 World Cup reminded me of this extraordinary Brazillian rightback who scored two of the best ever World Cup goals in that year's competition. I thought his first name was Paulo, and the video linked above does indeed give that name. But our article doesn't. Help welcomed at Talk:Josimar. --Dweller (talk)\n\nOkay I should have done this earlier. I am trying to do my own work with Indian football but yet my watchlist is filled with edits on this page by Mgomes neca (talk · contribs) who admitted that he is indeed Manuel Gomes himself. He made a lot of edits and all of them are not referenced or constructed at all. I told him that I would come back and revamp his page when I can. Sadly I have been busy I will get to it. I just manually undid his edit again and would like the page protected for around a week so I can revamp it. I should have time to do so. Cheers. --Arsenalkid700 (talk)\n\nIs it okay to remove this stuff on sight? I think they are not referenced and are a violation of WP:NOR. Some claim that this falls under routine calculations part, which states that: \"Routine calculations do not count as original research. Basic arithmetic, such as adding numbers, converting units, or calculating a person's age, is allowed provided there is consensus among editors that the calculation is an obvious, correct, and meaningful reflection of the sources.\" Same page also states the following: \"Material for which no reliable source can be found is considered original research. The only way you can show your edit is not original research is to cite a reliable published source that contains the same material....The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.\" Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nI think they are a clear case of original research and should be deleted on sight, they go beyond simple calculations. – Kosm1fent\n\n(edit conflict) Definitely remove it. GiantSnowman\n\nNot Okay WP:NOR does not disallow these calculations, they simpel calculations made from well sourced simple rules. They are only used in highprofile tournaments, such as currently in the EURO 2012, where they are updated on a daily basis and they are all removed after the end of the tournament. It is a fine way to keep the tournament articles updated. Jack Bornholm (talk)\n\nSo, this is okay???\n\nOn the next match day (16 June):\n\nRussia will win the group if\n\nthey defeat Greece OR\n\nthey draw with Greece and Poland draw with Czech Republic OR\n\nthey draw with Greece and Poland defeat Czech Republic by 1 or 2 goals† OR\n\nthey lose to Greece by less than 6 goals and Poland draw with Czech Republic.\n\nRussia will qualify as a runner up if\n\nthey draw with Greece and Czech Republic defeat Poland OR\n\nthey draw with Greece and Poland defeat Czech Republic by at least 4 goals.†\n\nCzech Republic will win the group if\n\nthey defeat Poland and Russia do not defeat Greece.\n\nCzech Republic will qualify as a runner up if\n\nthey defeat Poland and Russia defeat Greece OR\n\nthey draw with Poland and Greece do not defeat Russia by at least 6 goals.\n\nPoland will win the group if\n\nthey defeat Czech Republic and Greece defeat Russia OR\n\nthey defeat Czech Republic by at least 4 goals and Russia draw with Greece.†\n\nPoland will qualify as a runner up if\n\nthey defeat Czech Republic and Russia defeat Greece OR\n\nthey defeat Czech Republic by 1 or 2 goals and Russia draw with Greece.†\n\nGreece will win the group if\n\nthey defeat Russia by at least 3 goals and Poland draw with Czech Republic.\n\nGreece will qualify as a runner up if\n\nthey defeat Russia by 1 or 2 goals and Poland draw with Czech Republic OR\n\nthey defeat Russia and Poland do not draw with Czech Republic.\n\n†If Russia draw with Greece and Poland defeat Czech Republic by 3 goals, the team between Russia and Poland with higher overall number of goals will win the group. The other team will qualify as a runner up. If they still level on the overall number of goals, Russia wins the group and Poland is the runner up. Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nThat's not okay, because it's an endless list of indiscriminate information, not because it's unverifiable. Just because something isn't cited straight from an inline reference does not mean it's unverifiable or original research. I would limit them, perhaps to \"if x wins or loses\".. scenarios, but the idea that this counts as \"original research\" is silly. The rules for calculating group stats are perfectly clear and verifiable, it is a routine calculation. - filelakeshoe\n\nI have no problem with that and support it. Don't see why this can't be used. Kante4 (talk)\n\nEven if the rules/materials for making the calculations are available, it's still original research to do the calculations if it has not been published elsewhere. Due to the short-lived nature of such 'what ifs', however, it seems easier to let them stay if editors insist on doing them. Pretty Green (talk)\n\nAbsolutely OK I think. The next day stats follow clear reason, because the rules that define the ranking are known before hand and published. This does not mean that the first person to edit a list similar to the above always gets it right immediately. However, more than in most other topics, differing opinions here are always resolved easily. Another reason for me to allow this is the simple information content. People are simply happy to find this information in our articles. Last point to consider: The whole stuff is deleted again within one week. Is it really worth fighting for it exclusion based on OR? I think not. This policy aims at excluding baseless claims. Tomeasy T C\n\nSo because people are happy it's fine to include this. And how do that people know if the information is correct? They need to run every possible outcome listed to verify that, and how is that no original research. Second thing, it maybe gets deleted within one week but it's not used only on Euro 2012, but on every qualifying competition out there plus European competitions. What's next? Soon there will be something like this on league season aticles: On the next match day this team will qualify for Europa League if blah-blah yada-yada... Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nWhat you are doing is simply to overcalculated any event possible when a simple next matchday scenario is nothing more than to give a overview over the situation. In this case who will qualify to the quarterfinals. It can be done, and are being done, much more simple. I fully support the scenarios. Jack Bornholm (talk)\n\nI didn't overcalculated anything, I just copied what was on the page. And it's funny that you can't agree who can qualify to quarterfinals in Group A Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nTrue, it is fun. Why not let the people have their fun. It is only a matter of math so it will be correct in the end. Jack Bornholm (talk)\n\nA list like the above would be too detailed as per my own taste. When I edit such an article, I would try to keep the content reduced to the basic information, i.e., what do team's need to do in the last match in order to qualify for the next round. However, I understand this discussion to be rather about the fundamental question: Should we allow people to publish consequences of future results. Here, i think yes, because it does not hurt and, which seems most important to Dr. Vico, it is clearly not against the spirit of WP:OR. these editors are not trying to publish unbased claims. Tomeasy T C\n\nI do not understand the focus of some people on the Wiki rules to the point of appearing to be a rules nazi, but I apologise for using this term since it will not appear to be polite of me.\n\nAs stated in the OR page, Routine Calculations are excluded from OR. Why would next day scenarios not be routine calculations, when they are just a result of the calculations based on published tournament rules? No doubt, it often requires a meticulous person to do it correctly, but it is much easier for others to verify any answers, and this again can be done by anyone without the need for any secret mathematical formula. Kiwi8 (talk)\n\nI think this is another one of those \"effort outweighs the benefit\" situations. Yes, these are pointless, amateurish, ephemeral, and generally non-conducive to the long-term improvement of articles. But on the other hand, the fanboys who are responsible for them aren't magically going to work on something which actually does benefit the project if they're prevented from adding this cruft. So yeah, don't feel bad about removing it on sight: on the other hand, don't waste precious moments of your life holding a vigil over articles to prevent its return. That said, no regular members of this project should be wasting the community's time defending these (or, God forbid, contributing to them). They're no more defensible on the grounds of being \"simple mathematics\" than adding weather forecasts would be. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nI agree with all of thumperward's points. The matter really needs discussion at Wikipedia talk:No original research rather than here. Anything complicated enough to need a proof worked out on the talk page is not a routine calculation, it's an elementary theorem, and hence OR. jnestorius(talk)\n\nAs somebody who have been editing and/or watching these articles for a while, let me offer some (very long) perspective of how these \"next-day scenario\" came to be: They are originally computed to answer the \"green or red\" question as soon as possible; i.e., during the progress of a tournament and before its completion, we color a team green if they have certainly qualified, and red if they have certainly been eliminated. Sometimes the calculations are quite difficult, e.g. for Euro 2012 qualifying, it involved head-to-head records and cross-comparison between groups on the best runner-up. For example at some point an editor concluded that the Netherlands were certain of qualifying either as group winner or best runner-up (see Talk:UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying#Netherlands Qualified?). After some debate and calculations back-and-forth, the editors seem to agree that Netherlands have qualified, even though UEFA still said they were \"on the verge of a finals place\". The next day, UEFA also confirmed that Netherlands have qualified. That is good, but well UEFA is pretty well-organized. Let's say we have the CAF, which never tell you about those stuff. So I read that \"team X still needs one more point to qualify\" or \"team Y is on the brink of elimination\", where in fact, based on my calculations (maybe a lot, maybe not a lot), team X has definitely qualified and team Y has definitely been eliminated. Or what about if one newspaper claimed that team X has qualified while another newspaper claimed that team X has not yet qualified. So we need to do some calculations to verify those claims, right? And then somebody thought, \"well let's just pre-compute all the next-day scenarios, so we can answer this green or red question as soon as the new results come in\". Full disclosure: once I even wrote a computer program to do these kinds of calculations. So this becomes a trend for all the pages of the tournaments. The calculations become so good that you can be reasonably sure that news sources are using wikipedia as some sort of \"confirmation\" that a team has qualified (for example, Libya as one of the best runners-up for 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualification before the completion of all groups; pretty doubtful that the journalists know how to calculate themselves or can find any source elsewhere). Oh, so where am I? Well, I guess most people will agree that the \"green or red\" question is quite important (they are not next-day scenarios since they are not hypothetical anymore). We kind of want to know whether a team has qualified or not, and they involve calculations that are sometimes \"original\" (as in nobody else have published them) and complicated, as for whether they are OR then that is debatable (as in many things in wikipedia). As for next-day scenarions, I am sort of ambivalent nowadays; sometimes I am interested in those, say what result Greece needs in their last match to qualify, so I compute the calculations in my head. I do not actively publish them, but if somebody publishes them I check whether they are correct to verify my own calculations; if I find them incorrect I edit to correct them. I do not think they are OR per se (they are just calculations, complicated or not), and on the one hand there are certainly enough people interested in calculating, reading and discussing about them. But on the other hand you can argue that wikipedia should not really be discussing so much about possible future scenarios (which will be deleted once the future arrives) that can read like a math textbook. Chanheigeorge (talk)\n\nI don't see anything close to a consensus here yet, so I don't know why Dr. Vicodine (talk · contribs) and IPs are continuing to edit war on the group articles, it's getting a bit disruptive and it would be most beneficial to the project if these articles were NOT fully protected. Has anyone tried looking for sources which list next match scenarios? - filelakeshoe\n\nI don't see who's edit warring here, I removed this shyte only two times. The only thing that's disruptive is 200 edits of constant changing of next match day scenarios and players positions. Btw, I'll be tagging this as OR since there's no way these are routine calculations. Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nwhat part of it isn't routine? Group A example: Russia have 4 points - that means for them not to qualify, two teams have to get past them. since they two immediately below are playing each other, a win or draw clearly puts them through. You can then do the calculations for a loss - a loss puts them and Greece both on 4 - and since results is the first tiebreaker, they'd lose that - thus they need both the other teams to be below them. again, both the other teams are playing, so that match would clearly need to be a draw. this now puts 3 teams on 4 points. results is the first tiebreaker - so look at the results. since each team would have drawn with Poland, head to head is simple - the net GD among teams = overall GD, therefore Russia's GD would have to go to less than Czech Republic's GD in order to not qualify- thus they need to lose by more than 5. it's simply doing additions and looking at the tiebreakers along with remaining matches. 188.221.79.22 (talk)\n\nIf you need a paragraph and a significant understanding of the tournament tie-break rules to understand it, it isn't routine. We get this all the time from people who assert that anything they can work out on a napkin during a flight is too trivial to warrant sourcing. It isn't. This isn't a news blog, and people should be strongly discouraged from making it so. It's not like there aren't already sites on the Internet that publish these predictions. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) Agreed. These go way beyond simple calculations as instructed by WP:NOTOR, especially for someone who is not an avid football fun... – Kosm1fent\n\nAdding 3 points or 1 point is very routine. The tiebreakers are sourced on the main page - and like I said, results is the first one. Looking at a result is not that difficult. GD might be slightly more difficult, but that is just adding and subtracting the goals in the results. 188.221.79.22 (talk)\n\nHey, one can argue that even applying tiebreakers at the end of the competition is not routine. Have you seen the UEFA tiebreakers, listed here? And what happens when the only source we have of who have qualified are the \"smart\" people of the South African Football Association? I know I may be taking it to the extreme here, but I think so are some of the arguments listed here (e.g. that everything listed has to be verifiable). Chanheigeorge (talk)\n\nBy that assertion, anything short of differential equations is routine. Anyway, you're going to stop edit warring on this matter immediately regardless. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nok, first - see WP:BITE (then WP:AGF) - second, are you really comparing adding 1 or 3 to differential equations?!!! 188.221.79.22 (talk)\n\nOK, you have a list of integrals that is sourced, so it's now routine to give me the result for: ∫ 4 7 3 2 x + 3 c o t 3 x d x {\\displaystyle \\int _{4}^{7}{\\frac {3}{2x+3}}cot3x\\;dx} . Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nwow - so we really are comparing 3+1 = 4 to differentiation? ok then - I'll go delete every thing that says \"1+1 = 2\" that doesn't have a source. 188.221.79.22 (talk)\n\nin actual fact, can we even have the group tables? - that involves working out that one win (3pts) + 1 draw (1 point) means a team has 4 points - that's OR (!) they also have stuff like \"5 goals scored - 2 against = 3 goal difference\" - that's OR (!) - heck even working out that teams have played two games after they've won one and lost one is OR too (!) 188.221.79.22 (talk)\n\nI'm just going with your reasoning that if we have some sourced rules like tiebreakers, every mathematical and logical operation used is routine calculation. Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nexcept that you're still comparing adding (such as adding 3 points or one point to an existing total) to differential equations - when there is no comparison. if the tiebreakers invovled calculating differential equations then you'd have a point - but they don't. 188.221.79.22 (talk)\n\nBasic calculations are indeed considered simple, but tiebreaking rules are not. And since we can't only include scenarios in groups where no tie-breaking will take place, for consistency we remove scenarios all together. Simple. – Kosm1fent\n\nWikipedia:These are not original research for Simple calculations clearly states: \"Any relatively simple and direct mathematical calculation that reasonably educated readers can be expected to quickly and easily reproduce. For example, if given the population and the size of a specific area, then the population density of that area may be included. Complex calculations (for instance, those involving statistics) should not be used to build an argument, because they require skills that common educated readers do not possess, or involve a large number of steps that may not be obvious, making it difficult to detect errors.\" How can anyone quickly and easily reproduce this when you argue for a half a day which version is correct? And I think this is a classic example of complex calculations part. Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nOkay, what's the next step here? People are removing OR tag repeating same bullshyte: This is standard in wikipedia, This is routine calculation, Discussion is over. To start a section at Wikipedia talk:No original research or Wikipedia:No original research/Noticeboard? Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nReading through this debate I see no clear consensus made, only you trying to push your opinon through and a lot good discussion with different opinions. You are making your own opinion to be standard for Wikipedia. Jack Bornholm (talk)\n\nThat's because my opinion is based on Wikipedia Core content policies and the only ones against it are obviously the ones which are putting this crap instead contributing with something useful. Dr. Vicodine (talk)\n\nDudes. Half the internet has got its calculators out doing the Euro 2012 maths. Can't we just find a reference or two? I already put one for Group A. LukeSurl t c\n\nBut you are the only person who really want to avoid those scenario sections. People giving good opinions but you just don't want to hear it and want to make your opinion the only one that counts. Like i see it from raeding, most people don't care if there is such a section with you being the only one against them. So the consensus is leaning towards allowing them, different from your edit summaries. Kante4 (talk)\n\nAnd here's a ref for groups A AND B. [5]. Sorted. --LukeSurl t c\n\nHere's a ref for Groups A, B and C from ESPN. Yesterday they only includes Group A and B and now it has been updated to include Group C. I expect them to update it with scenarios for Group D soon after today's matches. — 125.161.247.198 (talk)\n\nRetain (until redundant) but simplify: the sources above give details of what is needed for teams to qualify for the knockout stage. The example section above makes that situation far more complicated by adding analysis of what is necessary to top the group. That greatly extends such sections, and makes them far more daunting to read. There is no additional reward for topping the group, and no certainty that doing so will result in an easier semi-final. Kevin McE (talk)\n\nGiven that the only objection above was based on working out tiebreakers, Can we agree that Group D as it is just now is not OR, since that DOES only only involve adding points (1 or 3) and not doing tiebreakers. 188.221.79.22 (talk)\n\nNo. The problem is with making forecasts in general. The specific difficulty of the mathematics involved is irrelevant. We have no need to tell readers what might happen a week on Tuesday: if the calculation is as elementary as you constantly profess it to be, they should be able to work it out for themselves. All it does is make our articles look like fan pages. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nwhich is another debate entirely, and not one about whether the stuff is OR or not. Also, the line\n\n\"if the calculation is as elementary as you constantly profess it to be, they should be able to work it out for themselves\"\n\ncould apply that to any 'easy calculation' that WP:OR currently allows - so is a debate for that page. this debate is about the current interpretation of the current OR page. 188.221.79.22 (talk)\n\nNo. Addition and subtraction is really easy, but no one wants to spend an afternoon calculating shit just because.\n\nI think this entire discussion casts the wiki-community as a bunch of retarded aspergers. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 84.215.32.199 (talk • contribs)\n\nA user has gone and created a template (like the ones we use at the bottom of competition pages to link to past editions) and transformed into an infobox and added it to every single related page. The template in question is the following {{Qualification for championships (CAF)}} and can be seen on pages such as the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, etc. Not only is the wording retarded but the template is just a redundant version of the one found at the bottom of the page, and has no place at the top in my opinion. Thoughts? Approach to fix this? TonyStarks (talk)\n\nAlso, it's super ugly. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nAlso, it combines two competitions in one template !! Someone please answer, or else I'm going to keep pointing out flaws lol. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nWell, there are two possibilities – either keep, but under a different name and as an navbox, or delete. I tend to lean to the latter as the benefit of having a navbox containing every qualification phase for a competition is questionable at best since the qualification stages are not linked to each other. --Soccer-holicI hear voices in my head...\n\nWhatever is decided, it certainly doesn't belong at the top of the article. It is clearly a navbox, and they go at the bottom..... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nYou mean the top right infobox type template found on this version of the article? It could be usefull as both are being played now, so one interested in seing African ntional team results could jump from one to another, but still fails to be an ideal solution. A delete in my view, as the two competitions are unrelated. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nHe announced those here. -Koppapa (talk)\n\nThat was for the AFC one and by a different user .. nevertheless, I didn't know they had them for the other associations as well. What is everyone's thoughts on these? Keep or delete? Seems like most people so far don't see the need for them since they involved different competitions. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nThere is a bit of problem with the above AfD obviously he plays in a non-notable league that isn't up for debate. But national-football-teams & Soccerway state he has played for the Armenia national team which means he would pass WP:NFOOTYbut UEFA seem to think it was Kamo Hovhannisyan that played against Kazakhstan. I don't think we should take UEFA's word as gospel further clarification is needed. ★☆ DUCKISJAMMMY☆★\n\nAgree with you, I can´t recall exactly which, but I do remember finding a few mistakes specially among players with same surname, on behalve of FIFA.com and UEFA.com. The best way would be to consult some local Armenian sources like daily or sports news websites which cover national team events, the problem is that Armenian is written in a different alphabet which is quite hard to read and understand, and while one can spot a player name in a foreign-language report of some latin-scrypt language, in this case it is impossible. I´ll try to see if I can find one Armenian football website which had individual players pages in English and then see if I can find him there. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nAs I alraedy said on the above deletion discussion, there is Armenian Weekly (an English-speaking source) which states that Kamo was the one who got in: [6] It's the only source I could find that featured the full squad & substitutions of the game (apart from Soccerway). – Kosm1fent\n\nYes, you did exactly that, I should have checked the discussion first before posting here. Case closed then! FkpCascais (talk)\n\nBad news... the electronic archives of Athlitiki Echo (an invaluable source of information for pre-2007 Greek football) now require authorisation. Don't know why, especially as there is no announcement for that closure. Damn. – Kosm1fent\n\nYou guys fixed the redirect because there is information from the All India Football Federation about the format and dates of the tournament which thus make it notable but Spartaz does not agree. The page has been once again redirected as for some reason this says that the Nehru Cup 2012 page should not be made till the tournament starts BUT only 1 user on that Afd said so. Snowman said it to but he also said that if more information comes out it is notable. Anyway could use some help for this. Cheers. --RedBullNewYork2012 (talk)\n\n\"says that the Nehru Cup 2012 page should not be made till the tournament starts\" -> NONSENSE. If there is enough reliable sources talking about the 2012 edition then an article can be made. We don't wait until kick off to make pages for the World Cup/Euro/ACN/etc. and it's not any different for this tournament either. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nThis is an invitational friendly tournament organised by the All India FF, so with respect, their announcement of format and dates doesn't remotely count as significant independent coverage. We don't have to wait until it starts, just until there's a decent amount of independent coverage, i.e. not just other sources reproducing the AIFF info about format and dates. But until there is a decent amount of independent coverage, it isn't notable by definition. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nAs I said above, more independent reliable sources are needed in order for the 2012 edition to stand as a stand-alone article. Undoing the redirect without providing such sources goes against consensus established in the previous AfD. Cheers. – Kosm1fent\n\nHere you go... [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. That should be enough. I mean everything about this tournament is out, format, amount of teams, prize money, dates. The only things missing are venue and 3 teams. Still till then it would be best to keep the article not on redirect to Nehru Cup. I could then make a section outlining the teams invited but not confirmed yet and I could also make a critical section based on what the new India coach said. --RedBullNewYork2012 (talk)\n\nMore than enough sources for an article in my opinion. If others are not still convinced, you can always create the article in your sandbox with all the relevant information and references .. and that could convince the skeptics with regards to the notability of the tournament/article.

Anyone fancy lending a hand on talk to establish what exactly is going on and (if possible) to rein in some of the hystrionics?

Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nI would imagine that if the club were actually going to be liquidated then it would be front page BBC News, let alone front page BBC Sport News. Someone always comes along to save the big dawgs so talks of \"Rangers F.C. were a football club\" are premature.--EchetusXe\n\nThat seems like canvas to me but even if it aint to say you would use admin tools if you wasnt involve seems like a threat to me. ive already said the article needs correcting what that will be is hard to say, you have said yourself the sources are contradicting each other there no way to really establish until more is know over the new few weeks what is really correct and what is really wrongAndrewcrawford (talk - contrib) 16:55, 15 June 2012 (U\n\nChris has abused everyone on that page. He cant use his tools A) because he forced a change through against consensus on that page and he knows it. B) He hates me and isn't ashamed to bring that into every situation that he gets involved in, he is an admin that pushes a pov against consensus and attacks other editors. So what did he do he ran to his mates. Well Chris you have proven what you are. If anyone is thinking about getting involved you will see that the consensus was massively against a new article and for keeping as one entity and explaining the situation i.e transfer to new company and the new company not having a licence to play or a league. This was all done yesterday and it stopped an edit war, today chris removed all that and now we have a massive edit war started by an admin who is supposed to be impartial and go with consensus. Plus a new club article The Rangers Football Club which he has also edited falsely he has no proof that company cant use the old crest he just assumes they cant. Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nI think it's just a restructuring. The new company is a reorganization of the legal, ownership and operational and to reduce tensions between debt and equity. I dispute the 2012 disolving because the decision on if the new company is a new club is the Scottish Football Association's decision. They decide if the new company can continue the history of the club. Kingjeff (talk)\n\nIt's rather more that that, actually. The club really is being dissolved, which is quite a bit more serious than e.g. what Leeds went through. The question of whether a phoenix club will be allowed into the SPL, or Scottish football at all, is very much still a live one. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nEchetusXe you removed Andrews comment nor have you read the talk page no one wanted the article to be like that apart from Chris we wanted that page to be a continuation of the old after there liquidation chris does not want that and has went against consensus.Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nIts not restructuring they are being liquidated we cant deny that but we did not want the page like that chris did.Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nYes unfortunately a POV editor has come along to exasparate the situation. We had some form of consensus yesterday but that has changed today. Adam4267 (talk)\n\nAs we speak he is going against consensus making edits to the infobox and leads he is out of control and won't follow consensus that had been bult, if this was a non admin the would have been blocked for pov pushing and ignoring consensus that was built for several days before he got involved today. He clearly used the above statement as a threat. This is getting ridiculous and we all know Chris is the pov pusher so you can say that. Admins cant do that its unbelievable behaviour. Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nEchetusXe this is the version that had consensus[12] that should a the club the entity still had some form without having to go down the route of creating the new article and closing the old one. Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nI'm sorry but if a club finishes its league programme for one season and turns up the following season in the same league with the same name, the same stadium, the same fans, the same manager and the same players then I don't think media sources are going to consider it a new and separate club and therefore neither can we. Burslem Port Vale F.C. were liquidated in 1907 and Cobridge Church F.C. changed its name to Port Vale F.C., bought the club's old stadium and began a new league programme in a league several steps below on the pyramid. It says 1876 on the badge (even though evidence points to 1879 as the founding date) and all media sources state that the club has existed since 1876. De facto is a greater concern than de jure, whether you like it or not.--EchetusXe\n\nWhere are you getting i want them to have separate pages. I don't i want that the consensus we all agreed on which is to keep one article. Chris has said they should be treated as separate because they are not one in the same i.e. newco and oldco. He forced changes against that Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nMost people so think they should be kept at the same page. They might be in the 3rd division nest season though. Adam4267 (talk)\n\nyip parts of the article will neeed to be updated when the information is known but there no need for serperate article since they are all the same according to sources and if we are to use sources and then go against that it is POVAndrewcrawford (talk - contrib)\n\nAll well and good: the problem is that it hasn't actually happened yet, and there's still a significant chance that it won't happen. The most recent example of a club's parent company changing was Leeds, who went to extraordinary lengths to avoid liquidation, for instance. In the Football League, it means automatic demotion to Step 5 at best with at least some degree of visible club name change. Even assuming that the new club is voted in in place of the old, there's still a significant chance that it will be stripped of its titles and forced to change its name, and there's more than one vote to get through to get back into the SPL. If either the SPL member clubs or the SFA refuse to transfer the old club registration then they'll be out, and have to find a new league to enter (there is no procedure by which they would automatically enter the SFL). And yet despite all this, you've got EW insisting (with no lucid argument at all, save \"we all think this\") that the new company be treated as if it's already the same thing as the football club, despite having made no petition for a membership transfer. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nThey have requested a meembership transfer though. The page yesterday said basically that Rangers had been liquidated (or on the verge of it) and a new company had been formed which owned the assets and was trying to transfer the membership across. But that that might not be accepted by the authorities. I do not see what's wrong with that. Adam4267 (talk)\n\nrangers football club plc have been liquidated the rangers football club isnt this is what people do not get there heads round, ill be honest i thought the club was liquidated yesterday and in my own personal opinion they have been but the sources are contradicting some suggest the club hasn't been liquidated but the plc has and not interconnected other than the plc owned the club and the newco now own it as the newco bought the brand and are hoping for what you have said, adam good work on trying to et edinburgh and chris to either work or not work instead of the fighting good luck :)Andrewcrawford (talk - contrib)\n\nI think (I may be wrong) but this is the current situation. The club, in terms of the body that holds a licence to play football. Has not yet been liquidated but is in the process of it. Rangers still listed as a club on SPL's website. However, that \"club\" has no stadium players etc. All they have is the licence and £5.5m in there bank (from Charles Green) to pay off creditors then go bust. Green's company owns the parts that were used to make up Rangers (maybe not the players) and want to trasnfer the old membership over. That might or might not be accepted by either both SFA or SPL (they need a licence with both). If that is the case they will have to apply to the Third Division as a gap will have opened up through teams being promoted. (That again may or may not be succesful as other teams will apply) Adam4267 (talk)\n\nWhere is the problem with what was there, there was no speculation and we had worked towards it via consensus. Now we have two articles The Rangers Football Club & Rangers F.C. the first one may never get of the ground. Neither article makes any sense at its making an arse out of us all. They have requested a membership transfer and that was sourced. The new article is not needed nor was the change in line with the consensus which was to keep them together until we knew what was happening, only detailing facts not speculating what may or may not happen, just the pure facts that they are currently applying for their membership to be transferred and currently do not have any league to play in until that has been accepted or not. It also explained properly that green had purchased the assets and was reforming and the process is ongoing. Sourced info and consensus if being ignored that is the real problem we cant put in what we don't know so where is the issue as adam says with the consensual text we had.Edinburgh Wanderer\n\n(edit conflict)All you really need are sources per WP:RS for all that and you've got some content that can be included. Leaky Caldron\n\nWould you believe it we actually did and it all got removed.Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nFrom an encyclopaedic point of view I think the best thing is to wait until the football licensing authorities, the SFA & the SPL recognise the newco (or not). The football aspect of the article will then take care of itself. Haggling about oldco, newco, crests and shares is rather mindless from a football article perspective. Of course, if there are credible WP:RS for the status of every aspect of ownership that's fine but it seems rather elusive. There seems to be a lot of POV being pushed on all sides, not much of which is neutral. Leaky Caldron\n\nThe problem now is we have an edit war one group who wish to close the oldco and list as defunct and another who would rather wait and see what happens. All the old co hold is the licence the newco hold everything else. The best way was to say they had applied for the licences to be transferred and then see what happens. Only citing the facts and waiting to see what happens as we cant speculate whether they will or won't get a licence or say they are in a league that they technically are not. this[[13]] was the version we had but it wasn't perfect but at least there was no edit warring over it, that allowed us to wait and see how it played out and whether the club continued in the same form with the same perceived identity in sources or a totally new club and start a new article. There was consensus for that for the time being. The main feeling was we shouldn't consider them as two separate entities until that actually happened but yet we have it.Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nIn regard to neutral it had been requested that the page be protected until we all could agree on the best option and make it neutral. However i was basically told its me thats in the wrong despite the consensus. This means its open to edit warring and pov pushing. Ill be honest i don't care less which way it happens but it needs to be done properly and not have lies or censored info. I do not support Rangers nor do i dislike them either. As long as its done properly an we aren't misleading people which we are now then I'm happy. What dosent make me happy is misinformation and casing confusion all we need are the basic facts and no speculation like they will play in the SPL. We don't know that nor do we know if they will ever play again.Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nTBH, I cannot see much wrong with the current version [14]. \"The Rangers Football Club\" certainly has no football licence yet and it would be incorrect to imply that it has. Leaky Caldron\n\nIt depends whether we accept that Rangers are a continuation or they will be a new club. Consensus was they will be a continuation. If we go with that the problems are a) We cant say they play in the SPL because we cant factually say they will again. b) It lists Craig Whyte in the infobox if its a continuation then we can factually say Charles Green owns the majority share. C) It fails to mention they are currently in the process of applying for their licences to be transferred and do not in fact have them. If we go with that is the old Rangers then it should be in past tense and players and stadium details removed as they have no ownership over these and new article updated although that will always be speculative. So whatever way you look at it there is a problem. Edinburgh Wanderer\n\nChris Cunningham and Edinburgh Wanderer, I still think it is debt restructuring. The new owner is using insovency of one corporation and created a new corporation to deal with the current debt. Kingjeff (talk)\n\nthis is the problem no one knows, is it true liqudation, ie the club is dissolved, is it debt restructing, is it a new club no one knows this is why the articles needs to be tlaked about before changesAndrewcrawford (talk - contrib)\n\nread this, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18452212 \"Season ticket income looks vital if he's to avoid pitching the club back into administration. So Charles Green now has control of the assets, but faces hostility from his customers.\" if it is indeed a new club then you can tpitch the club back into administration, this wher ethe confusion lies sources are stating the club contunies and sources state teh club is disolved but no one knows just now, the article itself also makes it seem like the club is dissolved so it is contradiciting itself never mind other sources contradict itAndrewcrawford (talk - contrib)\n\n[Section courtesy blanked.

Cheers, Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nI noticed that the UEFA Euro 2012 statistics does not list assists. The information about assists is widely available for this competition, should it be included or is there a reason it is being left out? TonyStarks (talk)\n\nAre those official figures? The reason we don't typically include figures on assists in European football is that they aren't officially tracked, so all sorts of different media and betting organisations keep their own figures. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nWould appreciate input from other editors at Florent Cuvelier and the associated talk page. I removed categories based on the fact the player hasn't represented these clubs, however another editor has twice reverted my changes claiming you include clubs regardless if they have played for the first team. For me, being a member of these clubs - especially as just as part of the youth team - is not notable, only by playing should the player receive this categorisation. What do you think? Thanks - Cloudz679\n\nI tend to only add categories for clubs where the player has had a senior/pro contract. BigDom\n\nI agree with BigDom. If they've signed a pro contract, add them to the category. It's slightly different with competition categories, however, such as Category:Premier League players, where the player in question would have had to make an appearance in that competition. – PeeJay\n\nThere's certainly no requirement for them to have played first-team football to get the club/player category. Agree that competition/player categories require an appearance in that competition. Personally, I don't require a senior, or particularly a pro contract, even for clubs at a high enough level to have professional contracts; by that definition, Theo Walcott wouldn't qualify for Southampton F.C. players, because he made his 21 Football League apps for them when he was still too young to turn pro. If the player has been associated with the club at a formal level, I give them the category; e.g. a player who was released after their two-year scholarship at Foo F.C. but then became notable elsewhere would get the Foo F.C. players category. Helpful to the reader, and all that. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nEcho what these guys are saying; if a player has been on the books at a club then the relevant category should be added. Cheers, Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nIf a player is at a club during his youth career, it should be added to his categories. The categories are not exclusive for the first team, unless we're talking German/Spanish football where the first team can sometimes be a considered \"separate entity\" from the reserve/youth team (eg. Bayern Munich players, Bayern Munich II players). In Cuvelier's case, he should have Mouscron, Portsmouth and Stoke in his categories. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nNice to see you all in agreement but I don't think it's very encyclopaedic to not have proper inclusion criteria for these categories. Triallists will be having these extra categories added in that case \"because he played in a friendly match for this club\", etc. I think that is clearly wrong. I don't see why it can't be the same case for international teams, either you played for them in a sanctioned match and you have the category, or not. Should someone on Wikipedia who has an article but is not notable for being a football player have a category added for Foo F.C. players because he spent a few weeks in their youth set up at the age of 12? I don't think so. Where is the common sense, or am I missing something here? Cloudz679\n\nI agree, all such club footballer categories should have the inclusion criteria explained at the top of the category, although we'd need to agree appropriate wording. Eldumpo (talk)\n\n\"Should someone on Wikipedia who has an article but is not notable for being a football player have a category added for Foo F.C. players because he spent a few weeks in their youth set up at the age of 12?\" - Steve Harris (musician) is in Category:West Ham United F.C. players......... -- ChrisTheDude (talk)\n\nOn that basis, should Rod Stewart not be included under the Brentford F.C. players category. -- Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nStewart 'kicked a ball about a bit' and served what appears to have been two weeks of an apprenticeship. Guess in the most tenuous sense that makes him a Brentford player? [15]--Egghead06 (talk)\n\nI believe that if a player has been registered with a club, either as a youth or as a non-playing professional, the category should be included. GiantSnowman\n\nSo basically, inclusion criteria being any individual who has been associated with the football club in a playing capacity, including at youth and reserve levels. Is this the criteria everyone is applying? Cloudz679\n\nYep. A trialist does not qualify since they were never on the books of the club, they just tried out to be a part of it. TonyStarks (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) At the risk of misinterpreting other people's posts, I think what we've been saying is \"contracted to\", \"registered with\", \"associated with at a formal level\", \"on the books of\", i.e. a formal or contractual relationship with the club, but some people are stricter than others about whether they count youth players. Don't think anyone's said anything as loose as \"any individual who has been associated with the football club in a playing capacity\", because as you said above, we'd end up with trialists, guests in testimonials, kids who trained with the club for a few weeks at the age of 12, whatever. Mr Cuvelier, who started all this off, was in Mouscron's youth system for six years and had a pro contract with Portsmouth. If the categories were called Foo F.C. first-team players, it'd be different, but they're not. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nSo what you're saying is there's no clear criteria supported by notability and verifiability and as such these categories don't meet the same strict guidelines as the articles themselves. What a shame. Cloudz679\n\nMay I ask a question? Nery Castillo hasn't played for the Mexican national team since 2009, but he hasn't announced his retirement. Should the \"nationalyears\" parameter in his infobox read \"2007–2009\" or \"2007–\" since he could potentially play again for his country? An editor seems to support the latter option. Cheers. – Kosm1fent\n\nMy rule is if they haven't played in the current or previous campaign then it should be closed (there's nothing to stop it being re-opened if he does get recalled). ArtVandelay13 (talk)\n\nActually, Nery Castillo just turned down a Red Star Belgrade offer and moved back to Mexico and signed with Pachuca in order to increase his chances in gaining back his spot in the national team. But anyway, when he receves a call again it can allways be reopened. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nWe've generally been undecided on this one. I'm strongly in favour of leaving it open unless there's a reliable source indicating that the player's international career is over, but there's significant disagreement on this. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nYou have to draw the line somewhere. I doubt, for example, that Lee Hendrie has announced his international career is over, but no-one would list that as 1998– ArtVandelay13 (talk)\n\nThere should be no hard-and-fast rule about this, but merely common sense - if a player hasn't played for the national team for a few years (2-3?) then it's reasonable to add an 'end date'. GiantSnowman\n\nIn updating Portuguese club articles I am coming across a number of outdated \"squad player lists\" (e.g. F.C. Famalicão) even when some are described as \"current squad\". I have little time for updating such lists as within 12 months they will be out of date again. Do you advise me to retain the outdated lists and tag them or can I delete them? My preference is to follow the latter course of action unless the listing relates to 2011/12 season. League Octopus (League Octopus ).\n\nHow about not using the word \"current\"? Instead titling the section as \"First team squad\" or similar, and using {{As of}}, the sections will just date, rather than become incorrect. U+003F?\n\nI usually update the ones I care about and delete any which are horribly out of date. At the very least renaming the section to \"Playing squad\" and then adding the note about \"as of...\" will help out. Cloudz679\n\nI don't see a problem with having an outdated roster, as long as it says 2009-10 for example in the section title. At least that way a reader knows its not the current squad. I prefer an outdated squad than no squad at all. If the majority of the team is unchanged it will be easier to fix it in the future than having to start from scratch. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nI agree with Tony, and the kind of solution U+003F mentioned is what I have mostly followed around. Adding at top of the squad list a date \"As of...\" and removing the word \"Current\" which is disencouraged to be used on WP anyway seems the best solution. An outdated squad is even so a better peace of information than having nothing. So I never favour the \"delete\" option. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nSquad lists without a reference should be removed, as they cannot be verified, regardless of how out-of-date they are. For referenced lists that are out of date, I personally would say remove them - what use or relevance does a 4 year old squad list have? GiantSnowman\n\nFrom my experience, having the squad, even if not updated, motivates others to update it. Also, I favour allways having a date at top of the section, and for me is more important to have a correct squad at certain date (exemple, March 2012) than having IP´s running around adding and removing players as soon as some rumor is published somewhere... Regarding the referencing issue, it is not that easy, as often squads lists in official websites themselfs are only updated at the start of the season, and often editors don´t wait as long s that to add and remove players. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nIf you do delete content, please remember to use the edit summary to explain why you're doing it, to avoid your edits being confused with casual vandalism. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nThanks for your helpful comments - I will take on board the concensus view. League Octopus (League Octopus )\n\nI created a page for Widnes F.C. back in March when the North West Counties Football League reported that a new club (which involved Mark Wright, the former Liverpool and England international, and Stephen Vaughan Jr, who played for Chester City and was chairman at one point during his father's ownership of club) were going to apply for membership of the league for 2012 entry.\n\nThe league AGM happened at the weekend and they have not been admitted. I contacted the league secretary today questioning if they had rejected an application to the NWCFL and he responded:\n\n\"There was no actual application, as any new club entering the National League System above Step 7 requires approval from the FA Leagues Committee. My understanding is that they did not have a suitable ground for Step 6 so they did not formally apply.\"\n\nObviously, there has been coverage of the club (as per the references) but it seems that this is going nowhere. I suppose it may be possible that they could end up in the Liverpool County Premier League (whose AGM is at the end of June) or a similar level league, but unlikely given the complete lack of a club website or any other press coverage since March 2012.\n\nAny views on AFD?\n\nZanoni (talk)\n\nRedirect to, and mention on, Widnes#Sport for now?

GiantSnowman\n\nSources in the article say he played there. Guardian and Washington Post seem reliable. -Koppapa (talk)\n\nCould very be lazy journalism. GiantSnowman\n\nThe WaPo article is from the Associated Press and it never mentions that Sarsak has actually played for Palestine in a senior international. The article simply reports that he is a \"member\" of the \"Palestine national soccer team\" - which could mean he has received a call-up but never played or that he represented a youth or \"B\" side. There is simply no way to verify he played in a FIFA \"A\" international, so I would recommend we don't indicate that he has played for the Palestine national football team. Jogurney (talk)\n\nThis was previously asked here. Seems that we concluded he did not win a cap.--EchetusXe\n\nI'll search again tonight and see if I can find anything in Arabic. Either way, he is notable given all the media attention he has received, but I'm guessing the question was just to verify if he actually played for Palestine or not. TonyStarks (talk)\n\nThis was discussed a few days ago - see archive here. According to this article, at the age of 17 he participated in a Norwegian youth tournament. He was then called up for a Palestine training squad but was arrested before he could join up with them. Consequently, IMHO, he should not be referred to as \"a member of the Palestine national football team\" as he was never a member of a match squad, let alone actually playing for Palestine. Unfortunately, \"samidoun.ca\" is considered to not be a reliable source so as a result this information has been commented out of the article.

Outstanding cleanup work. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nThere was some discussion on this point a little while back. I'm referring to players who are listed wifh a flag/nationality on a stats website that is generally regarded as reliable (e.g. Soccerbase, Soccerway), when they have not played representative football for a country. I believe the consensus here was that such flags should not be regarded as reliable, as the website has probably just taken the players birth place and used that to record his 'nationality'. Is that the consensus, and if so can we add it as guidance somewhere? Eldumpo (talk)\n\nI'm in favour of making clearer that we shouldn't rely on spurious sources for nationality. Just a side comment, the big problem with Soccerbase is that they are inaccurate even for some people who have played international football. Lee Hodson, Adrian Mariappa and Jonathan Bond for example. [20] —WFC—\n\nI'm guessing you mean for players about which their nationality is a matter of some debate? For example a player born in London who had no international call-ups would be referred to as English, barring a source saying he considers himself German or whatever.--EchetusXe\n\nMy original post related to all instances, although the issue becomes more important when there is some debate. And yes the only other way of deternining 'nationality' would be for some kind of sourced statement by the player. Eldumpo (talk)\n\nIf there is any doubt at all, leave the flag out. That's the rule pretty much everywhere except at WP:FOOTY, where we still have this awful \"if in doubt, guess\" mentality. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nHi, just a quick question regarding ethnic descent in the opening sentence of leads. I've had a disagreement with MarkMysoe (talk · contribs) at Mario Balotelli regarding this issue after I removed \"of Ghanaian descent\" from the lead's opening sentence. From what I've seen, it doesn't seem standard practice to include ethnic descent in the opening sentence and believed this edit be justified through WP:OPENPARA, which states \"Ethnicity or sexuality should not generally be emphasized in the opening unless it is relevant to the subject's notability. Similarly, previous nationalities or the country of birth should not be mentioned in the opening sentence unless they are relevant to the subject's notability\". Perhaps I misinterpreted what this says. However, if anyone can affirm what the standard or correct practice on this is that would be greatly appreciated. Cheers, Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nI doubt Mario's Ghanian nationality has anything to do with his notability, so I'd say you did the right thing removing this part from the lead per WP:OPENPARA. Cheers. – Kosm1fent\n\nAgree that standard practice is to not include ethnicity/descent in the opening unless there is an excellent reason, and I don't believe there is one in this case. I routinely remove \"of x descent\" from players when I come across it. Camw (talk)\n\nI'm slightly torn on this one. In Balotelli's case his adoption etc was quite well reported and is somewhat significant (and was often mentioned early on in his career). It'd be more of a problem for me if for instance Thierry Henry's article said \"former French International of Guadeloupe and Martinique descent\" as it's completely unremarkable in his case. I would otherwise agree with you Matty.Koncorde (talk)\n\nAgree with Koncorde - lots has been made about Balotelli's origin, questions asked if he would play for Ghana or Italy etc. etc. - it should be mentioned but not given undue weight. GiantSnowman\n\nWhat everyone said, between them. There's no problem with mentioning his being the son of Ghanaian immigrants (not being \"of Ghanaian descent\") in the lead, in fact it probably should be mentioned, given that the lead is supposed to summarise the article. But it absolutely doesn't go in the opening sentence, per WP:OPENPARA. cheers, Struway2 (talk)\n\nI've made what I believe to be a fair edit, keeping it in the lead but moving it out of the first sentence. Hopefully it's okay now. Cloudz679\n\nQuestion, the last paragraph of intro states \"becoming one of the first black players to play for the Italian national football team.\" Who is the first? Matteo Ferrari? Is Balotelli the second? If so, it might be better to mention it like that? \"becoming just the second black player to play for Italy after Matteo Ferrari\". TonyStarks (talk)\n\nIt used to say he's the third, but that was removed with an amendment earlier today, although no explanation was given. Mattythewhite (talk)\n\nMaybe somebody thinking Claudio Gentile is the first? But with no reliable source to back it up, any claim of that nature should not be made. GiantSnowman\n\nAh yes, I forgot about Liverani. Balotelli would be the third after those two (Liverani and Ferrari). TonyStarks (talk)\n\nIs being third notable? Koncorde (talk)\n\nWhat do reliable sources think? – Kosm1fent\n\nI don´t beleave that content should go in the lede, much less about being the 2nd or 3rd \"black\" player for Italy, that is an unecessary racial content put directly against OPENPARA. It can and should be mentioned in a separate section definitelly. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nGreetings pals. There is one question that's baffling me. The infobox table for football biographies says that play-off games shouldn't be counted as league games, as most statistical sources (including Soccerbase) don't count them. However, in the case of this chap here, Soccerbase counts his 4 play-off appearances & 1 goal with Atromitos as normal league games (compare with Guardian). Should his play-off appearances count as \"Others\" or not? Thanks. – Kosm1fent\n\nOthers, definitely. Soccerbase really shouldn't be used for anyone outside England & Scotland, and even then not if better sources are available. I'm praying for the day Soccerway begins a historical endeavour. GiantSnowman\n\nOkay, I hear you. Thanks. By the way, Soccerway also counts them as normal league games (at least they always did). Cheers. – Kosm1fent\n\n[Section courtesy blanked. See history for contents. Daniel (talk) ]\n\nShould the title of the article be as it is right now at Lewisham Borough F.C. (as supported by the Kent Invicta League, their old website) or should it be moved to Lewisham Borough (Community) F.C. (as seen here and on their Footbally Club History Database page). I'd leaning towards moving it to the latter but wondered what others thought. Del♉sion23 (talk)\n\nWP:COMMONNAME. We don't title articles by obscure \"correct\" names if they have a well-known common one. I dare say very few people pronounce the parentheses even if the proposed title were more \"accurate\". Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nBut we don't do WP:COMMONNAME for football clubs - we do the full name and then an abbreviation (AFC or FC) - we wouldn't do Brighton F.C.. I would be in favour of the full name with the appropriate F.C. or A.F.C. ending. Number 57\n\nWhile we have a convention for certain countries, it is not a hard override of COMMONNAME. We don't use parentheses in any other club names, and if the league they play in is happy enough to refer to them by the shorter title then I don't see what the problem is. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nInteresting case - we have Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C. and not Bradford A.F.C. or Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C. GiantSnowman\n\nAn excellent example indeed. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nThat article used to have parentheses, but they were removed by what looks like a cut & paste move sometime between 2007 and 2009. Also, there are articles with parentheses in their names, including Newport (IOW) F.C.. Number 57\n\nThere was a histmerge in July 2009. That means that for at least three years one of the highest-profile non-league club articles has remained at a title which compromises between COMMONNAME and our general British club naming conventions. Which would see to be evidence of a silent consensus for such exceptions. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nThe club category and subcategories remain Category:Bradford A.F.C. GiantSnowman\n\nThe above merger proposal was closed by a newbie, the MP was only open for less then 4 days although it was a Snow so closing early was probable justified. Not knowing much about MP's myself but clearly he doesn't have the authority to close, could some close it properly or reopen if necessary & warn the user appropriately. ★☆ DUCKISJAMMMY☆★\n\nSigh. There is no official merge process. You agree with the close, as does everyone else, so why on Earth would you want the user who closed it to be reverted and warned? Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy. Go and edit some articles. Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward) (talk)\n\nAs I said I was unfamiliar with the MP process & wasn't aware there was no official merge process unlike AfD only wanted the user warned if appropriate other wise a would done it myself. So there's no need for you smart ass comment Go and edit some articles yet again acting inappropriately on this talk page everyone's sick of your attitude at this stage you just put people off this project. ★☆ DUCKISJAMMMY☆★\n\nAgree that the \"Go and edit some articles\" comment was uncalled for. GiantSnowman\n\nBefore this escalates, who is correct? This player has played internationally for Guadeloupe, and my previous intro \"read\" FRENCH-BORN GUADELOUPEAN FOOTBALLER. User:Joao10Siamun reverted me removing precisely the nation the player represents, leaving \"...is a French footballer...\". Odd no? I have just read (where else, on WP!) Guadeloupe is a region of France, but still, the national team plays games on its own, so the player \"should be\", if only one nation is allowed in intro, GUADELOUPEAN, methinks...\n\nInputs please - --Vasco Amaral (talk)\n\nLike you say, Guadeloupe isn't a nation but an overseas region of France, so you can't really have \"Guadeloupean\" nationality. But it isn't really necessary to force any nationality on him in the lead sentence, just mention that he is a footballer who plays for the Guadeloupe national football team. BigDom\n\nShouldn't mention French born as it's irrelevant for the lead. I have made an edit that I believe reflects the ideal structure. Koncorde (talk)\n\nYes, what BigDom said is exactly the best way to solve this type of situations. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nIf nationality is ambiguous, then simply remove it, and do what Koncorde has done - 'John Smith is a footballer who plays for Wikipedia F.C. and the Wikipedia national team' GiantSnowman\n\nHello project.\n\nIs there anyone who has a suggestion as how to design football squad tables in a nice and tidy way? I don't think tables made up of Template:Nat fs g start etc (like those in Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's team squads) look good enough. I'd like to see a design that presents the relevant information (obviously), sortable, and not overly colorful (like those in Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's team squads).\n\nHandsomeFella (talk)\n\nThe first example is ideal, the second should never be used. Who has decided that a certain colour indicates a certain position? GiantSnowman\n\nOk, just so I know what goes. HandsomeFella (talk)\n\nSee post at [21], and if you have comments respond there. Thanks. Eldumpo (talk)\n\nOK, I need help. An user is inserting by a copy/paste move an entire content of another club, Gragjanski Skopje, without any reason, just to somehow claim the history of that club and use it as \"Origin\" section of FK Vardar one. I fixed it, added a \"See also\" template, but the user keeps reverting. I contacted him on his talk page but seems that he doesn´t even speak English. I need help as I reverted twice already. FkpCascais (talk)\n\nOh, he just called me a \"retarded\" in my talk page (diff)... FkpCascais (talk)\n\nOK, he removed himself the strong words and initiated dialog at his talk page. There is some hope :) FkpCascais (talk)\n\nWith me in a particularly jingositc mood today (\"Rooooooneeeeey\"), I've taken a mini-challenge for myself onboard to get the above article to FLC in due course. This is just a tiny plea to ask for help with providing more references other than the primary source that (until I added a couple today) solely references the whole article"
