        "text": "In the domain of cultural studies, we focus on the sociology of sports and fanship (Brown, 1998) as it is represented on the logos of fan clubs of Aris FC Thessaloniki. In specific we are interested in the cultural perception of icons-symbols and linguistic messages in slogans, produced by the fans. Amongst Gelder’s six key way proposal in which subcultures can be identified, we use, to interpret our corpus, those that refer to the negative relations to work/class; the association with territory, rather than property; the refusal of the banalities of ordinary life and massification (Gelder 2007). We apply the socio-semiotic analysis (Kress, 1996) in order to de-construct the references to new identities and transculturalism. As far as it concerns to the linguistic messages, content analysis is used applying the quantitative thematic methodology. The total sample consists of 79 fan stickers and 100 fan slogans, taken from ARIS fan clubs (1988-2010). Amongst them there are 25 fan stickers and 15 slogans containing political references about citizenship and transculturalism. As it appears, young people tend to construct their fan identity through the post-modern perception of citizenship. Many signifiers have been found about the youth demonstration against government’s, police’s and fascism’s power. The youth’s new identity is revealed through inter-cultural symbolism: “A.C.A.B. (All Caps Are Bastards)” and aggressive icons typically produced by anarchist, socialistic, young people. It seems that even in the context of sports subcultures young students need to produce discourses versus the majority of adult’s established power as Foucault (1966) had already determined.\n\nA register formation is a reflexive model of behavior (Irvine & Gal 2000) that evaluates a semiotic repertoire (or set of repertoires) as appropriate to specific types of conduct (such as the conduct of a specific social practice), to classifications of persons whose conduct it is, and, hence, to performable roles (personae, identities) and relationships among them (Agha 2007: 147). This chapter seeks to develop the so-called “sports announcer talk” register (Ferguson 1983) into a more integrated “football” register, i.e. “the language of football”, which is used not only for describing a football game, but also for commenting on the impact a game has on the society. Such a significant game was for the Greeks the final of EURO 2004, where Greece played against Portugal, and the players got the victory and conquered the European Championship for the first time in their football history. On the basis of the description of this game by the Greek sports announcer Kostas Vernikos and the impact it had on the media (newspapers, magazines), this chapter will argue in favour of ‘triumphalese’, a sub-register whose repertoire characteristics interact with the social practice of football, and hence should be considered as a salient dimension of the umbrella term ‘football language’.\n\nMay, 12th, 1976, in Glasgow, nearly thirty years after the end of the Second World War, two of the most renowned soccer team from France and Germany faced each other in the final of the European clubs championship. International sports events provide great evidence of the way national cultures frame their view of other nationalities. I will seek through various examples to point out links between the operation of media sports discourse and the possible interests of countries as they occur in practice. This is examined through qualitative discourse examples from the transcription of the French television broadcast. Past and present issues of identity politics between France and Germany can be illuminated through this analysis. Attention is paid to whether national stereotyping, I/we images, established/outsider identities/relations were evident in the direct broadcast of this soccer game. I will examine how television has transformed sport as a form of popular culture, focusing on sp...\n\nThis paper examines the sport and different sporting disciplines like: football, basketball, handball etc. and their influence in the construction and maintenance of different national and cultural identities. The paper approaches sports as part of the popular culture and, as it's often popularly said about football, as \"one of the most important, unimportant, things in the world\". Having this in mind, the role of sports and sporting teams will be examined in relation with two concrete examples. First, the role of the Football Club Barcelona, as one of the most popular sporting brands in today's world and its importance for the Catalan national and cultural identity. The Second example considers the domestic Macedonian matters; the importance of Macedonian sporting teams and their successes for the promotion of Macedonia and the contemporary Macedonian identity. By combining the two examples together, the paper will try to show, on the one hand, the symbolic importance of sporting teams in the cultivation and promotion of individual national identities, and on the other hand, also, the influential role that they play in the construction of new transnational identities.\n\nThe relationship between sports and patriotism is defined by a country’s historical involvements, present-day preoccupations and the prevailing beliefs held by the general public. Football commentators employ this background to fashion their narration according to the spectators’ patriotic tendencies. This paper scrutinizes patriotic expression in the 2014 FIFA World Cup as discernible in the match commentaries. I contend that acts of patriotism demonstrated take the form of positive, constructive or extreme chauvinism. Patriotism finds expression in the exhibition of national colors and the veneration of important personalities and national days. I further argue that the commentators’ interpretation of the matches is influenced by the patriotic predilections of the participating teams. In addition, commentators employ various literary forms to adorn the exposition of patriotism with drama and spectacle. I conclude that the use of these artistic devices in the presentation of a disc...\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the growth of international sport events as media spectacles has provided one of the most powerful tools for the projection of national identities. Traditional media, such as newspapers and private and public broadcasters, have been instrumental in this process. Media discourses around sporting events have historically tended to legitimise exclusionary versions of the idea of the nation, reproducing hegemonic gender divisions and marginalising ethnic minorities and immigrants. At the same time, sport is also a contested vehicle for nation-building, providing to some degree opportunities for the expression of different versions of the idea of the nation. The deep changes in the media industry, and particularly the emergence and success among young people of interactive and transnational media, open the way for counter-narratives and alternative media discourses. For example, sport celebrities can use social media to expose and criticise the racialisation of immigrants in sport and beyond. But can the millions who follow them on Instagram or Twitter be counted as a ‘public’?"
