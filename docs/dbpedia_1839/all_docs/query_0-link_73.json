Words to li e y for the inept Tunisian modern pentathlon team in the 1960 Rome Games. In the first event, the entire team fell off their horses. One athlete almost drowned during the swimming competition, and the team was forced out of the shooting event after a team member nearly grazed the judges. However for the fencing event the Tunisian management decided to do something taking advantage of a certain thing in the game, and they were faring pretty well in this. However the hoax was discovered soon after and the team was disqualified. What did the Tunisian team decide to do for the fencing event? QUESTION 10\n\n225. They had one expert swordsman and they sent him each time hoping that no one would look behind the mask. But their ploy was caught when the same fencer came out the third time. Answer\n\n226.

However, the script did not play out as smoothly as the dream team slumped to defeat against the Canadian wild card duo of Vasek Pospisil and Milos Raonic in three tight sets.

Patrick Berger scored from a penalty in 59th minute to put the Czechs ahead. German substitute Oliver Bierhoff then scored to make it 1–1 at the end of the regulation time.

Their rivalry was influential in reviving national attention to the faltering league. They are said to have saved NBA from bankruptcy, as millions tuned in to watch them play against each other.

After their final and sixth fight (named “ai t Vale ti e’s Day Massacre ), in which Y beat X brutally, but as ’t able to knock X down, X managed bars and became a stand-up comedian.

Some sports moments simply defy all reasonable comprehension—Mickey Mantle blasting a 565-foot home run, Secretariat winning the 1973 Belmont Stakes by 31 lengths, and Tiger Woods winning the U.S. Open by 15 strokes. But the feat that may top them all came in the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. X, a 22-year-old New York native, barely qualified for the Olympic long jump finals after fouling in two of his qualifying runs. Fortunately, he did. The following day in the finals, X took off down the runway in the thin air of Mexico City. After exactly 19 loping strides, he hit the board perfectly, stretched out with his legs and flew through the air like no one ever had. And finally, he hit the sand in the pit below.\n\n415. There was no doubt that he had broken the world record, the only question was by how much. X was so excited and emotionally drained that doctors claim he suffered a \"cataplectic seizure.\" Some critics devalued the jump, claiming the rarified air and the wind of 2.0 meters per second was more responsible for the record. But all the other competitors jumped in the same elements and strangely, none of them came close. The defending Olympic champion Lynn Davies told X, \"You have destroyed this e e t.” Such as his perfor a ce that superlati e performances like that came to be called as Y after his name in future.

Former Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers defender X has revealed that he plays in football boots bought on online marketplace eBay. The Cameroonian, who currently plays for Ligue 1 side St Etienne, said that the pair in which he currently plays cost him just €30 (£23) from the website. He said that the decision was because he didn't want to be at the beck and call of boot manufacturers. \"I'd rather be free than prostitute myself for a sponsor,\" the 31-year-old told French website Canal+. He added: \"Being fashionable is expensive, but you're more distinguished to be vintage. I buy shoes for €30 [£23]. It's a good price for comfortable boots.
