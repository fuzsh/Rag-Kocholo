        "text": "This World Cup has been full of surprises, none greater than the fact that after Sunday’s round of 16 game in Recife, either Greece or Costa Rica will claim a place in the quarter-finals. No one would have predicted that at the start of the tournament, and while Costa Rica have rightly earned plaudits for topping a group that included three previous World Cup winners, Greece have prevailed in their now customary fashion, never looking likely contenders but somehow forgetting to get knocked out.\n\nIn terms of surprise, your average Greek would have expected less than your average Costa Rican after the opening two games. A comprehensive 3-0 defeat by Colombia was followed by a scoreless draw with Japan after the dismissal of Kostas Katsouranis before half time had reduced the Greeks to 10 men. Greece went into their final game against Ivory Coast with one point and no goals, yet managed to stick around long enough for Georgios Samaras to turn the expected outcome on its head with a last-minute penalty.\n\nStickability is becoming a Greek trademark. They are unlikely to repeat their Euro 2004 success any time soon – let’s face it, that triumph was unlikely in 2004 – but they usually make their mark. “We cast the critics aside and fought for our country,” said Dimitris Salpingidis, who said almost exactly the same thing after Greece reached the second stage at Russia’s expense in Euro 2012. “We have given the Greeks a reason to smile.”\n\nTwo years ago the Greeks needed a reason to smile more than most, with their football success being played out against a backdrop of severe austerity measures at homeand little sympathy from their wealthier European neighbours. While their economy is not yet healed it is no longer at the forefront of events. If Greeks are smiling at the moment it is because their footballers have proved more determined and durable than those of fancied teams such as Spain, Portugal, England and Italy.\n\nBetween them, Greece and Costa Rica have exploded the myth that the major leagues of Europe exert a lunar pull on football’s highest honours. It is probably still true that the best players in the world can be found within the small cadre of European clubs with eligibility for the Champions League. What no longer seems so certain is that at least a smattering of those players are necessary to make an impression at the World Cup.\n\nCosta Rica have only one Champions League player, Joel Campbell, and apart from Bryan Ruizand the injured Bryan Oviedo, who have Premier League experience, most of their exports to Europe can be found in the outposts of Scandinavia. Greece are composed of players either rejected by the Premier League – Samaras; not pulling up any trees in the Premier League – Giorgos Karagounis, Konstantinos Mitroglou; or not thought to be good enough – Salpingidis and others.\n\nWhile we all know that the Premier League is not as good as it thinks it is, and on recent evidence perhaps La Liga and Serie A are overrated too, can it really be the case that to get ahead in World Cups you should send your best players to be relegated with Fulham or station them at minor clubs in Denmark and Norway?\n\nThe only reason that Greece were not expected to topple Ivory Coast, apart from their abysmal performances in the two previous games, is that their squad was not peppered with illustrious Champions League names such as Yaya Touré and Didier Drogba, or Premier League performers like Chieck Tioté and Wilfried Bony. It has become commonplace to argue that England’s international development will always be stunted while there are so many foreign players in the Premier League – the situation is certainly unhealthy in terms of encouraging home-grown talent – but it is beginning to look as if the foreign players themselves are also affected by some sort of malign influence due to playing in England.\n\nNo English player distinguished himself in Brazil, but how many foreign players with Premier League experience have done so? Yohan Cabaye and Olivier Giroud, possibly, Robin van Persie, Mesut Özil and Per Mertesacker, Fernandinho and the ever-reliable Pablo Zabaleta. Even with most of Belgium the list is quite short. Maybe the Premier League is harmful to everyone. Or maybe what you need in a tournament situation is a togetherness and a willingness to fight – Salpingidis’s word – your corner.\n\nEngland seemed to expect the World Cup to happen to them rather than the other way around, and Spain and Italy possibly made the same mistake, even though the latter looked set when they won their first game. To an extent Greek progress can be explained by the mundane reality that they found themselves in a relatively easy group, although it could not have appeared that way when they had shipped three goals to no reply with Ivory Coast still to come.\n\nAt the very least it was handy to be able to play a team as weak as Japan when Greece were on the ropes, most other opponents would have taken advantage of 10 men. There are no rules for getting out of a World Cup group, though it is helpful if there is a whipping boy so the contest is narrowed to a three-way fight.\n\nIt was England’s mistake – come on, admit it – to imagine Costa Rica would be that whipping boy. Now that Roy Hodgson, Greg Dyke, the Football Association and the vast majority of football writers, this one included, have a clearer view of England’s true position in the scheme of things – Group D whipping boys – it should be easier to avoid such a monumental error in future.\n\nDue to the style in which they progressed, from what was certainly a difficult group, Costa Rica should now be favourites to reach the last eight. Greece will not mind. They are familiar with the position. There is not much romance in their football but plenty in their attitude. “We were the better team in the last match,” Karagounis said. “Something in the heart of the Greeks makes us play against the odds.”"
