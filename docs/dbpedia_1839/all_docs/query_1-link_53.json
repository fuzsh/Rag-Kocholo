        "text": "People often say sport and politics don’t mix but try telling that to the Greek supporters who will be urging their team on against Germany on Friday in what has been billed as Euro 2012’s ultimate grudge match.\n\nBy throwing together Greece and Germany at a time when the eurozone debt crisis appears to be reaching its zenith football has once again proved it has a knack for impeccable timing.\n\nFriday’s match in Gdansk is a chance for the Greeks to show that even if Germany might be pulling the strings of the country’s crippled economy, it cannot dictate terms so easily on the football pitch.\n\nGreek supporters have had special T-shirts printed for the game which read, “Its time we kicked you out of the Euros”.\n\nThe clash promises to be one of those occasions when even Greeks who normally care little for the ‘beautiful game’ will be urging their team on to victory.\n\n“This is more than a football match,” managing editor of Athens News Thrasy Petropoulus told FRANCE 24. “Playing Germany is going to be huge.\n\n“The players will be up for this because they will know exactly what it means back home. The good thing is that the match will bring unity, because there is precious little of that around at the moment.”\n\nRich vs poor\n\nThe Greeks have not been afraid to stir up the tension ahead of the match. “Bring us Merkel” was the headline in the newspaper Goal News the day after Greece qualified for the quarter-finals with a shock 1-0 win over Russia.\n\nThe German Chancellor has answered the call, and her presence in the Gdansk’s PGE arena could make the occasion feel more pantomime than football match. Expect the chancellor, the evil villain in the eyes of Greeks, to be booed and whistled every time her image appears on the stadium’s big screen.\n\nGreek bitterness towards Germany and Merkel stems from the perception among much of the population that crippling austerity measures inflicted on Greece as part of multi-billion dollar EU/ IMF bailout deal are far too harsh.\n\nGreeks are also fed up with Berlin meddling in the affairs of Athens.\n\n“Throughout the whole crisis Germany has failed to understand that smaller nations do not like being pushed around by bigger ones,” Petropoulos told FRANCE 24.\n\nThe economic and political backdrop has helped to spawn a healthy array of jokes that have been doing the rounds on the internet this week.\n\n“Will Angela Merkel try to tell the Greeks how many goals they have to concede,” pondered @Nndroid on Twitter.\n\nEven Greece’s embattled politicians took time out from their crucial coalition talks this week to joke about Friday’s fixture.\n\n“The result is definitely not up for negotiation”, joked the country’s new Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, in reference to his desire to renegotiate the strict terms of the bailout deal with Germany and the EU.\n\nThe resentment goes both ways as German daily Bild demonstrated with its provocative headline “Poor Greeks, we’ll give you your next bankruptcy for free.”\n\nUnsurprisingly though the Germans on the other hand have by and large been trying to take the sting out of Friday’s fixture.\n\n“Politics won’t play such a big role. We have to forget about all that and concentrate on football,” said Lars Bender scorer of the winner over Denmark in Germany’s final group match.\n\nDavid vs Goliath\n\nGreece may not lack a will to win in Gdansk, but the odds are severely stacked against them pulling off what would go down as one of the most remarkable upsets in footballing history.\n\nGermany, one of the pre-tournament favourites to win Euro 2012, have won 13 consecutive competitive matches. Despite being drawn in the supposed Group of Death, the Germans eased through without breaking a sweat with three victories over Portugal, Holland and Denmark.\n\nThe four time European Championship winners boast world class names such as Bayern Munich’s Bastian Schweinsteiger and Real Madrid’s Mesut Özil. With respect to Greece’s squad, very few of its players are known outside their own country.\n\nFuthermore they will be without their suspended captain and talisman Giorgos Karagounis who scored the winner against Russia in their final group match.\n\nBut names and titles are not likely to faze a Greek team which has a history of upsetting the odds in this tournament. In Euro 2004 no one gave them a hope of beating European Champions France in their quarter-final clash, but Greece beat Zinedine Zidane and co and went on to win the tournament.\n\nGreece are carefully plotting to upset Europe once again and are expected to use the same tactics of soaking up pressure against the might of the German attack and hoping to nick a goal on the break or from a set piece."
