Being a habitual being, the prospect of writing another FAQ for this series was irresistible. I have been a fan of Konami's football games ever since the \"ISS Pro\" series on the Super Nintendo, and to the best of my knowledge, it's the only football series that has substantially improved with each new instalment. In comparison to the \"boring\" FIFA series and the inappropriately-titled This Is Football, Winning Eleven 7 is the finest football simulation ever to grace a home gaming system. In this years instalment, there have been multiple improvements, the most noticeable of which being in the graphical department. Players, stadiums and weather effects are now so convincing that the casual observer might mistake it for the real thing! Even the commentary has been markedly improved, although it's still not quite up to the level of some of EA's games. Can't win them all, I guess. The number of club teams have also been massively expanded -- 64 are now selectable, including many of the more famous clubs from around Europe, and they've even thrown in Tottenham for a laugh! The legendary Master League is a beast, with improved player-search abilities, as well as a more realistic \"reputation\" factor included, meaning a team like West Ham in Division 3 cannot simply sign Ronaldo on a free transfer, much like real life. Remember the UMBRO Pro Training Challenge in WE6? Well, that's been expanded too, and now each category (Dribbling, Passing, Free-Kicks, Attacking, Defending and Possession) has five separate challenges. By the time you have beaten each category on Level 5, your skills will be God -like! Also, you will want to check out the WE-Shop mode, which is where all the bonus features can be \"bought\" with points earned by winning the various cups and leagues in the game. So, in short, there's a hell of a lot to cover here, so I'd better get started! Thanks for reading this document. I hope you find it useful and entertaining. -Rich * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 01.b Legal Notice -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- This guide can only be viewed on the following web sites: - GameFAQs.com <http://www.gamefaqs.com/> - IGN FAQs <http://faqs.ign.com/> - Guitarfreak86.tk <http://www.guitarfreak86.tk/> If you see or have found this document on any sites other than those listed, please notify me immediately; they are in breach of international copyright law.

Seriously, if you don't know this stuff then you really won't stand a chance when you play against even the most simple competition.

I would personally recommend using the d-pad as -- being digital -- it offers a more immediate response. Also you are less likely to run in the wrong direction as there are only 8 directions available on the d-pad and there are around 64 when using the analog sticks. Player movement is dealt with the same if you have the ball or not. The only other thing to remember is that if you have the ball at your feet, turning takes slightly longer than when you are not in possession. Switching Players (L1) ------------------------ Absolutely crucial when defending, pressing (L1) switches control to the player closest to the ball. If an attacker runs past the player you are controlling, tap (L1) immediately to switch your cursor to a player who will be more able to win the ball back and turn possession over. Sprinting (R1), (R2) ------------------------ Hold (R1) + the desired direction to make your player sprint in that direction. This is very effective when defending as the defensive player can make up lost ground (if your defender is fast, of course) on the attacker who is considerably slower with the ball to deal with as well as normal running. For this reason, the (R1) sprint should only be employed when there is a large amount of space to run into. For a more controlled dash hold the (R2) button + the direction you want the player to run in. This makes the player dribble at a slightly slower speed than the (R1) dash. Although there is a noticeable loss in speed, the increase in manoeuvrability means that it is much easier to outfox the opposition's defenders. Maximum effectiveness can be achieved by alternating between the two running techniques, e.g. (R1) in a straight line, (R2) when twisting and turning to try and outfox a defender. Short Pass (X) ------------------------ This is executed by pressing the direction you wish to pass in and the (X) button simultaneously. Normally, the pass aims automatically towards the nearest player from your team in the specified direction. Of course, if you are foolish enough to press a direction where no player is situated, your pass is going nowhere. When using the analog stick, the AI is less forgiving than when aiming digitally, so heightened accuracy is required. Note that the further you are from the player receiving the ball, the less likely it is that the pass will be successful. As a general rule, never use (X) to pass the ball a distance of more than about 15m. Clearance ------------------------ The equivalent of a \"get out of jail free\" card in Monopoly. When in your own half, pressing the () button hoofs the ball up the field and away from danger. A clearance from within your own box can also be performed with the (O) button. This one's a life saver... LEARN THIS WELL! Long Passes (O) ------------------------ All long passes are controlled with the (O) button. If your player is in advance of the 18-yard line then an automatic cross is performed. If the player is within 18 yards of his own goal-line, the player will clear the ball upfield to prevent the opposition from continuing their attack. A gauge is used to control the height and length of the pass. I can't show you how to do this effectively, it just takes practise on your part. However, I would suggest that the gauge should not be filled more than half -way, except to perform a clearance. This is because after the gauge is more than half full it is hard to determine where the ball is going to go. Just take my word for it! :-) Crossing ----------------------- \"The Route #1 Hoof\" - (L1) + (O) Pressing this from anywhere on the field results in a high ball played into the opponent's 18-yard box. This can be effective against weaker opposition but completely useless against any team worth their salt. Only employ this move if you are desperate, ideally after defending a corner. Ideal for quick, on-the-break plays, but is reliant more upon luck than skill. Far Post Cross - (O) When you are past the opposition 18-yard line (edge of the box), press (O) to execute a cross to the attacker closest to the far post. Unlike the last two instalments of Winning Eleven, it's relatively easy to score from crosses, especially against defence-lite teams like Manchester City. Near Post Cross - Double-Tap (O) As above, but to the forward closest to the near post. Lightning-quick and very potent. Low Cross - Triple-tap (O) Plays a very fast ball across the face of the goal. Ideal if you have short forwards who aren't suited to headers (Owen, Nuno Gomes). NOTE > The last three techniques can be performed -- with limited success -- from all areas of the pitch if the (L1) button is held while doing so. Shooting ([]) ------------------------ All shots are performed with the ([]) button. Again, this is gauge-operated, with the power and height of the shot determined by the length of time the ([]) button is held for. Holding the directional button towards the goal will increase the likelihood that the shot will be on target. Depending on which player makes the shot, the accuracy can vary wildly. For example, a shot from Ronaldo will be more likely to create a goal-scoring opportunity than a similar effort by Gary Neville, obviously! Standing Tackle (X) ------------------------ This tackle is the one you should be using 90% of the time. It's very effective and your chances of being penalised for a foul are much smaller than when performing a sliding tackle. The (X) button is used to perform this, but the (X) button is cleverly shared between two moves. Don't worry if this sounds complicated, it couldn't be easier! Basically, by holding the (X) button when in defence, your player will press towards the attacker and try to force an error. When you have approached the attacking player, any further taps of the (X) button results in your player putting a foot in to try and win possession forcibly. There, not so hard, is it?! Sliding Tackle (O) ------------------------ Performed with the (O) button and requires extremely good skill and timing. This is a much more aggressive tackle, which if used wrongly can result in serious repercussions such as a booking or even a sending off. ONLY use this if you are confident of it succeeding, e.g. you have a clear chance of making contact with the ball. Whatever you do, do NOT attempt a sliding tackle if you are behind the player in possession. 9 times out of 10, this will result in at least a booking, if not a dismissal. Just BE CAREFUL!!! * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 02.c Advanced Controls -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- This section contains controls and manoeuvres that require a little more skill to perform than those listed in the previous section. These can be extremely effective, although they should be used sparingly (unlike the \"skill moves\" of other soccer). In short, you should only use them in specific situations. Conveniently, then, I will give an example of where each technique can be used most effectively. How nice of me! Through Pass ------------------------ Performed with the (^) button, this is an extremely useful move as it makes fools of even the stronger defensive line-ups. It is similar to a regular pass in that it is aimed using the left analog stick, but there is no fixed ball receiver. The benefit of this is that you can pass the ball ahead of your intended receiver, allowing him to run on towards the ball and make up ground. This ball should not be played straight, but diagonally across the defensive line. 80% of the time, the defenders will flounder and your forwards should be able to knock a goal in from close range. Especially satisfying in multi-player. In a neat touch by Konami, a lovely sweeping camera effect is used to give you a better view of the goal after the pass is released, making through passes all the more satisfying this time around! BEST USE: Splitting the defence for an easy chance on goal. Lofted Through Pass ------------------------ As above, but hold (L1) and press (^) to chip a delightful little pass over the heads of the back row and onto the boot of your striker. Works every time so LEARN THIS NOW!! BEST USE: Making a complete joke of that \"man-marking\" system your friend bangs on about. Keeper Charge ------------------------ Holding the (^) button when not in possession makes your 'keeper charge headlong towards the ball carrier. This move seems to get an overhaul in each new version. In WE7, I think They got it about right. When used intelligently, this can be a life-saver. Just don't use it when defending a corner or a free-kick, ok?! Good, you're not as stupid as you look after all! BEST USE: If your defence has left your keeper stranded, or if you want to stamp your authority. Defensive Assist ------------------------ Holding the ([]) button will cause the nearest defender to put pressure on the player in possession. This can be useful if you really need to close down the attacker, but you should be careful against pacy, counter-attacking teams (e.g. Brazil, Real Madrid), who will exploit the fact that one of your players are out of possession. One well-timed through-pass and your opponent will be given a goal-scoring opportunity on a plate. BEST USE: Hold ([]) and (X), \"sandwiching\" an attacker and quickly closing him down and preventing an attack. Make sure you don't expose yourself, though! The \"One-Two\" Pass ----------------------- Quite complicated and hard to master, this can bamboozle even the most experienced defenders. To perform it, hold (L1) and press (X). Then, when your team-mate receives the ball, tap (^) to return the ball or tap (O) to return a lofted ball. BEST USE: Making a mockery of your opponents \"offside trap\". The Chip ----------------------- Pressing (L1) + ([]) when the keeper is off his line will result in a lofted effort which will float into the goal leaving the keeper stranded in no -mans' middle of nowhere. This takes good timing, and you'll need loads of practice to get it just right, but it's more than worth it to see your pal's face seething with rage as the ball trickles slowly into an open goal! BEST USE: When the keeper charges you at the edge of the box. The Chip II ----------------------- By holding the (R1) button when the shot gauge is still visible, your player will perform a slightly lower-trajectory effort on goal. This method is far more effective than the (L1) chip shot as it is more likely to hit the target. BEST USE: When the keeper is off his line. Needs immaculate timing. First-Time Shot ----------------------- Press ([]) slightly before a pass reaches a player in an attacking position to blast a shot at goal with your first touch on the ball. If the ball is supplied to your attacker at pace, it will be translated into an unbelievably powerful shot. Obviously, your striker's accuracy will be impaired due to the nature of the technique, but your chance of scoring is high as the opposition's goalkeeper will have no time to prepare for the incoming shot. BEST USE: If the defence is constantly managing to close down your front line. Shooting early like this will catch out even the paciest defence. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 02.d Feints, Flicks & Tricks -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- This section lists the various little tricks and feints that are oh so satisfying against your friends in multi-play. Feint Shot ----------------------- Press ([]), and whilst the shot gauge is still filling up, quickly tap (X) to cause your player to fool the defender that you are about to take a shot before craftily scooping the ball of to one side and leaving the defender stranded. This looks really cool and is an immensely satisfying way to make your opponent look REALLY stupid. What's more, it's very effective, even against strong CPU opposition. BEST USE: Anywhere in the opponents half, it never gets old! NOTE > You can also feint long passes with much the same method, although the (O)-(X) control is slightly more cumbersome. Don't bother doing it, but if I don't write it down my inbox will be full of \"omg u n00b.\" emails ;P Dummy ----------------------- Holding (R1) just as a pass reaches the receiver's feet causes him to step over the ball and let it run on for another player. Simple enough, but it's because beginners (who hold (R1) with impunity) fall foul of it often that makes it an \"Advanced Control\". Can work spectacularly, or fail miserably. BEST USE: To avoid running the ball straight into a pack of defenders. Knock Forward ----------------------- Whilst dribbling with (R1), double-tap and then hold the direction you are running in to knock the ball a few paces further than usual. In the ensuing chase for the ball, you should be able to put half-a-yard between yourself and the defender marking you. BEST USE: Making the full-back eat your dust. Flat-Out Dribble ----------------------- When sprinting with (R1), press and hold (R2) and change your course by 45 degrees. This makes the player thump the ball several paces ahead a give chase. Works well if you have a speedy winger, but usually results in a turnover of possession. Both Foot Fakes ----------------------- To perform this, your player needs the \"B.F.Fake\" star ability. These feints are very difficult to do and, truth be told, they're not very effective. But they're in the game, so it's in the guide. - #1 - Whilst sprinting with the (R1) button, press an adjacent direction to the direction you are running (e.g. if you are running to the right, press either down-right or down-left) as the player's foot touches the ball and then revert to the original direction. This is a [female dog ;)] to master, but it is possible, I promise! - #2 - As above but with the (R2) dash. - #3 - Again, but without any shoulder button depressed. This is close to impossible due the precise timing needed. I still cannot do this every time. Stepovers ----------------------- One for the showboaters -- you know who you are! -- by double-tapping the (R2) button you will perform a stepover feint. This can do a good job of fooling defenders, especially when combined with a change in direction. If you're going for a more flamboyant piece of trickery, double-tap (L1) for a triple-stepover manoeuvre. Personally, I don't find the triple-feint quite so effective, but if anyone out there finds a good use for it, give me a shout via email NOTE > You can also perform a stepover by flicking the right analog stick twice rapidly in the direction opposite to the way your player is facing. For a triple-stepover, do the same but flick the analog stick in the direction you are running. Dummy Left/Right ----------------------- Similar to the both-foot fakes listed above, only slightly more effective. by quickly tapping the right analog stick to the side you want the player to feint in. If the feint is performed with the player's good foot, he will do a cunning little half-stepover before feinting in that direction, completely outfoxing most defenders. Side-stepping ----------------------- While dribbling with (R2) held, press a direction at right-angles to the way you are going to perform a little side-step, completely stranding any defender attempting a tackle. With practice, this little trick will become one of the most important in your armoury. BEST USE: Evading a tackle at the last second, leaving you clear on goal. \"Crabwalking\" ----------------------- A term coined by me and a few of my friends, releasing the analogue stick or d-pad while performing the side-step, your player will continue to side -step along, crab-fashion, until another direction or key is pressed. BEST USE: Err, there really isn't a practical application of this move... it just looks kinda cool! Dribbling Backwards ----------------------- While performing a side-step, press and hold backwards on the d-pad/analog stick to cause your player to walk backwards, dragging the ball underfoot. Another pointless one, but it's sure to cause your mates to gawp in amazement! And if you liked that... Spin Feint ----------------------- Often referred to in coaching manuals as the \"Rocastle Manoeuvre\", by performing a full rotation of the right analog stick, your player will spin 360 degrees in what is quite simply the biggest piece of showing off in the history of Winning Eleven. Pull this off in front of your mates and you'll have bragging rights for months, literally. Don't show your girlfriend though; it certainly didn't impress mine. In fact I got the same kind of look that a vet would give you before putting your puppy to sleep... Ah well, can't please everyone. BEST USE: To perform in front of your peers... then GLOAT!! Overhead Flick ----------------------- When receiving a shoulder-height ball, press (R2) and the opposite direction the instant that the ball reaches the player. This in itself is a useful way to get round a defender, but for ultimate show-off factor, try chaining multiple flicks together in an elaborate bout of juggling! Of course, this has no practical effect, but there is a certain \"wow\" element when watching someone perform it in the middle of an otherwise tense, serious game of footy! BEST USE: Another gloat-fest. NOTE > You could always follow this up with a tap of the ([]) button to try and catch their goalie off guard. Not always effective, but when it _does_ work... you'll be thanking God, Allah or whoever you give thanksgiving to for the \"Save Replay\" feature! * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 02.e - Penalties -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Penalties are awarded if a player is fouled in the opposition's 18-yard box (that is, the larger of the two white rectangles that surround the goalmouth) and are also used as a tie-breaker in some knockout competitions. When taking a penalty, a player is selected to take a single shot from 12-yards out, with only the goalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper may not move forward from his goal-line until the player taking the penalty strikes the ball. Sorry if that over-complicated things slightly. In truth, taking a penalty couldn't be simpler. Just press ([]) and hold the desired direction to shoot. If you're the goalie, just hold the direction you want to dive in and hope. Here is a crudely drawn goal with the available directions you can shoot in, marked with a '*': __________________________________________________ | | | * * * | | | | | | | | | | * (neutral) | | | | | | * * | That's all there is to it! It's pretty much pot-luck when it comes to actually scoring or not; there isn't any \"technique\" involved. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 02.f - Free-kicks -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Alas, one minor niggle from the previous games in the series is that the Free -kicks are still really, really hard to pull off. This section is about the Shooting free-kicks because the various passed free-kicks are pretty simple to understand. So, here goes, a guide to the most difficult thing you have to do, just about. Remember: Practise Often ----------------------------- By frequently practising your free-kicks, you will eventually develop a knack for them and your chances of scoring at a crucial stage in the game will improve. Practise makes perfect, so \"they\" say. DOWN + ([]) - Short range free-kick. Use this when you are within 22M from the goal. Aim between the heads of the defenders and fill the gauge _just_ over half-full. Hold left or right to add swerve to the ball, but usually this isn't necessary. This should be easy enough to learn. ([]) - Mid-range free-kick. When you're less than 30M out then this shot is effective. Aim between the heads of the far side of the wall. Fill the gauge no more than 2/3 full and hold the D-pad towards the goal. Eventually you'll get a 'feel' for this. I score about a third of all free-kicks from this range. UP + ([]) - Long range free-kick (30M or more away). Holding [U] causes the player to hoof the ball low and hard. Aim slightly wide of the goal, fill the gauge between 1/3 and 3/4 full and apply swerve -guess what!- towards the goal This seems impossible at first, but you'll get the hang of it soon enough! Dipping the shot - by holding (X) after the ball has been struck, the ball will dip sharply. This can be useful if you overhit it, but the significant loss in speed decreases the likelihood of scoring. Pressing (X) before the ball is struck will almost always result in the ball smacking into the \"wall\" formed by the defence. Low Trajectory Shots - performed very similarly to the \"Chip Shot 2\", holding (R1) whilst the shot gauge is still visible. This, when combined with UP, results in an extremely powerful, low trajectory shot on goal. This is a bit hit and miss, but when used effectively it can produce stunning results. BTW, it has come to my attention that pressing (^) after taking a free kick has a similar, albeit less drastic dipping effect. Use this on long-range efforts if you know you have overhit the shot slightly. Tip For Practice Mode ----------------------------- Use the \"Vertical Intermediate\" camera view obtain a better perspective of your free kicks. For example, from a side-on view the ball does not seem to curve at all. However, in vertical mode it is obvious that some players can bend the ball up to 40 degrees from long range. Defending Free-Kicks ----------------------------- Unlike previous games in the Winning Eleven series, you now have full control over the way your defensive \"wall\" deals with free kicks being taken by the opposition. If you hold the following buttons as the player strikes the ball, you can perform these actions: ([]) - The entire wall jumps to defend a high-trajectory shot/pass. (X) - No-one in the wall jumps, blocking all grounded balls. (O) - One or two players break from the wall, running towards the kick taker, increasing the likelihood of clearing the ball. > > > NOTE: The above controls can be combined to interesting effects. Rule for life - NEVER, EVER hold (^) when defending a free kick, unless you _want_ to be laughed at :-) Still finding it too hard? ----------------------------- There is a cheater's method to score free kicks from close range. It is in the \"Secrets\" section, but be warned! This method is so effective you might as well not bother learning how to take them properly. I would suggest only reading this if you are desperate. Remember, _CHEATING IS WRONG!_ ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ READER SUBMISSION ----------------- Augusto Lenzuen, a Brazilian schoolteacher and long-term fan of the Pro Evolution/Winning Eleven series, has this to say about the effect of tapping the ([]) button multiple times when taking a free-kick. It's interesting stuff, and of course, who in their right mind would shun the advice of a Brazilian when it comes to football?! Here is what he had to say about it all: \"There's a difference between filling up the meter all at Once, in two taps and in more than two (I mean mostly three, never tried it with 4 or more). I don't know exactly how this works, but I have a very good guess. First of all, you have to know the player you're kicking with, in some cases (like VERON, from Argentina, for example), it's best to fill the meter up all at once, while with Zidane, It's best to fill it up in two and Figo, for instance is best used with three taps. Also the distance plays an important role here: in short range free kicks (holding down in the control pad, of course), it's best if you fill up the meter all at once (this for me is till 23 meters of distance); in middle range free kicks (not holding any directional pad), you should fill up the meter with three taps (this range for me is from 24 to 27 meters), and in long range free kicks (holding up in the control pad) you should fill it up in 2 taps (from 28 meters on). This is how it's supposed to be done: It seems that when you fill up the meter with two taps, the first one will govern the speed of the shot, while the second will add height to it, without losing speed. This is hard to master, but can be very useful with some players at certain distances. The first tap should be long and the second very short, just adding some height, but not much. You must be able to calculate the distance/power relationship by yourself, I can't really explain it here. When you fill it up with three taps you should just worry that the first one is not too weak, the other two are just needed to get to the desired shot power. Basically, that's how it works. I have a friend that plays with France, and he wasn't able to get past the wall with Zidane [dear LORD! - *Rich]. After being told this information, he has become a free kick scoring machine!\" ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 02.g - Corners -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- This is a tricky one, as everyone will have their own preferred style that they follow when taking corners. Some like to pass it out for a cross, but I prefer a direct approach. This is how I take corners, feel free to send in your suggestions to me via e-mail. 1. Turn slightly towards the goal-line. 2. Fill the gauge about 3/4 full and hold the d-pad away from the goal-line for an outward-swinging cross. 3. The ball should sail directly to the far-post forward for and easy header. 4. Celebrate your goal. There ya go. It's pretty easy once you know how. 70% of my corners result in goals using this method. I'm not joking, it really is that effective, even on 5-star difficulty. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ READER SUBMISSION ----------------- \"OK, here this is simple. I just disagree with you when you say that you shouldn't try in-swinging corners. That all depends: This is just my point of view but here you have it, You may check this out if you want to see if it works for you. I think that players with high curling skills not only may but must try in-swinging corners. With Figo or someone with excellent \"curve\" stats, an in-swinging corner is almost a certain goal (you must press the cursor all the way away from the goal before hitting the corner and then the curve that the ball takes is incredible!) With A player like Bergkamp, on the other hand, this is not so useful.\" [*sigh* this guy is just putting me to shame isn't he -_-] ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ If you're playing your default Master League team or are playing strikers with poor 'Jump' and 'Header' stats, then you have no choice but to play a ground pass and try and to make a shot from the edge of the box. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 02.h - Throw-ins -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Hmm... I'm not sure whether throw-ins _really_ deserve a dedicated section, but I thought it better than cramming it in somewhere inappropriate... A throw-in takes place when the ball goes over either of the two sidelines. The team of the player who last touched the ball concedes the throw-in to the other side, who are allowed to throw the ball back onto the pitch to whoever they choose. Unlike previous games in the series, you control the player who will receive the ball, rather than the player throwing it in. Once you have positioned your player, you have three options: - Press (X) to throw the ball to the feet of the highlighted player. - Press (O) to throw the ball much further in the direction the thrower is facing. This is a good way to confuse human opposition. - Press (^) to throw the ball slightly in front of the highlighted player, allowing him to get up to speed before controlling the ball. ... and that's all there is to it! * * * * * * * * _____________________________________________________________________________ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- G A M E M O D E S ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- _____________________________________________________________________________ -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 03.a Match Mode -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- In this mode you choose two teams for a single match. You can choose from 56 National teams, 64 club teams or from six \"Classic\" teams, once they have been acquired from the WE Shop. To cycle between National, Club and Classic teams, press (L1) or (R1). Unlike previous versions of Pro Evolution Soccer, National Teams can be selected to play against Club teams, allowing for some interesting combinations. You can also select one of your Master League squads to compete in Exhibition mode. Once you have selected the competing teams, you will be taken to the General Settings screen to set-up the match to suit your ability and/or taste: Match Time ---------- Choose from 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 minutes match length. Difficulty ---------- Five difficulty levels (* to *****) increasing in difficulty. Condition --------- You can set the playing condition of each side. A red arrow means the chosen side will be on top form, while a white arrow means that they will play very poorly. Choose '?' for each players condition to be randomly selected. Injuries -------- Choose whether to enable players to become injured as a result of a heavy challenge. Max. no. of Substitutions ------------------------- Select how many players can be substituted during the course of the match. Extra Time ---------- Sets if extra time will be allowed in the event of the scores being level at full time. There are three types of extra time available: - Normal Extra Time - Golden Goal, where the first team to score a goal wins - Silver Goal, where the game is won if either team has a goal advantage at the end of each extra time period. P.K. ---- If the scores are level after extra time, selects whether a penalty shootout will be performed to decide the winner. Time ---- Select what time of day the match will be played (day or night). Season ------ Choose between a summer match or a winter match (affects the weather conditions if \"Weather\" is set as \"Random\"). Weather ------- Choose Fine, Rainy or random, to choose what kind of weather conditions will be present Stadium Effects --------------- Choose whether certain effects, such as the releasing of flares and fireworks, will take place during the match. > > > NOTE: In certain stadiums, or if the Japanese National team are playing, flares will not be released. Stadium Select -------------- Select the stadium in which the match will take place You can choose from: - San Siro, Milan - Catalonia Stadium (Nou Camp) - North-East Stadium (Highbury) - Orange Arena (Amsterdam Arena) - Bayern Stadium (Olympiastadion) - Monaco Stadium (Stade Louis II) - Trad Brick Stadium (Old Trafford) - Nakhon Ratchasima (Seol Sang-am Stadium)* - Estadio Gran Chaco (La Bambonera) - Cuito Cuanavale (Bloemfontein Rugby Stadium)* - Amerigo Atlantis (Estadio Nacional de Chile)* - Stadio Delle Alpi - Stadio Olimpico - Blue Bridge Stadium (Stamford Bridge) - Red Cauldron (Anfield) - Kanji Dome (Sapporo Dome)* - Dietro Monte Stadium (Kashima Stadium) - Porto Folio (International Stadium, Yokohama)* - Queensland Park (Lang Park Stadium)* - Haze Hills (Olympic Stadium, Tokyo)* (* special thanks to Cormac Boyle for these) Referee ------- Choose who is going to officiate the match. Oddly, Pierluigi Collina does not feature, despite being the man on the front of the box! Commentary Stance ----------------- Choose whether the commentators will take preference towards a particular side. It's quite amusing hearing Trevor Brooking lose it when the team he's backing scores! Support Stance -------------- Sets the bias of the crowd. Attendance ---------- Select how many fans turn out for their team. Setting both home and away to 0 leaves quite an eerie silence while playing. Once all of these options have been set-up, all that needs to be done is set -up your formation and starting line-up (dealt with later on) and start the match! * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 03.b League Mode -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Select 16 Nations to take part in a tournament against the CPU, or other human opponents for either 30 games (a season), or 15 games (a half-season). Extra Time and Penalty Shootouts do not take place. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 03.c Cup Mode -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Cup Mode is the place to go if you wish to recreate any of the famous International football competitions. There is also an option where you can create your own custom tournament, possibly for a multiplayer tourney with all of your friends Master League teams. International Cup -------------------- - 32 teams may participate. - All International Teams are eligible. - The cup consists of a single group stage, followed by a four-round knockout tournament. European Cup -------------------- - 16 teams may participate. - Only European teams are eligible for entry. - The cup consists of a single group stage, followed by a three-round knockout tournament. Africa Cup -------------------- - 7 teams may participate. - Only African teams are eligible for entry. - The cup is a straight knockout. American Cup -------------------- - 12 teams may participate. - Only North, Central and South American teams are eligible for entry. - The cup consists of a three- or four-round knockout tournament. Asia/Oceania Cup -------------------- - 6 teams may participate. - Only Asian/Australasian teams are eligible for entry. - The cup consists of a two- or three-round knockout tournament. Konami Cup -------------------- A customisable cup that allows you to create your own tournament with your own conditions and preferences. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 03.d Master League Mode -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- This mode allows you to manage one of 64 club teams, acquiring players and training your squad as you go. Your team starts off in division three (D3), and the objective is to win games and promote yourself into division one. Here you must continue battling (whilst avoiding relegation) until you are strong enough to come 1st in D1. The ultimate goal is to win the suspiciously named \"WEFA Masters Cup\", thus giving your team the best reputation in the World. [The Master League mode is dealt with in great length later on in this FAQ.] * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 03.e Training Mode -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Training Mode is divided into four main sub-categories: Free Training ------------- You choose your team and can set parameters such as the number of players on each side, then practice in open play or practice set-pieces such as corners and free-kicks. Challenge Training [covered extensively later on.] ------------------ You are set a variety of challenges in the following training disciplines: - Dribbling - Short Pass - Manual Pass - Free-kick long pass - Free-kick shoot - Ball possession - Attack - Defence Completing each challenge with be rewarded with a set amount of WE points. Beginner Lessons ---------------- You are presented with a series of very simple challenges, which you are guided through. Very handy as a method of learning the basic mechanics of attacking and defensive play. Controls -------- Gives instructions on how to apply the various player controls to real-life situations. Read above for target audience. If you read the \"Controls\" section in this document then you probably won't need to go through this stuff. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 03.f Edit Mode -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Winning Eleven 7 has one of the best editing facilities of any game I have ever played (losing out only to WWE Smackdown and maybe Tony Hawk's Underground). In this mode you can modify everything from the name and shirt number of a player right down to the size of his nose or the angle of his eyes. Team kits and flags are also totally customisable, meaning that you can include any team you like. Konami were seemingly expecting this, hence two of the default club teams are totally expendable... No, not Rangers and Celtic :P... PES United and WE United. Oh, ok, FOUR teams are totally expendable ;)! Edit mode consists of two main types of customisation: player modifications and team modifications. Player modifications enable you to create a new player, modify an existing one, register a particular player to a National team or enter a special 4 digit code (see the section entitled \"Stat Boosts\" for more info. Team edit allows you to change the name, flag, strip, team colours and default stadium of any chosen team. It's all pretty straightforward, and it's certainly very easy to use, however if enough people request further help when it comes to editing then I will consider adding another section devoted to it somewhere else in the FAQ. For now, though, you'll just have to fend for yourself. * * * * * * * * _____________________________________________________________________________ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- T A C T I C S & S E T T I N G S ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- _____________________________________________________________________________ Whether you are conscious of it or not, you are constantly applying a strategy when playing matches in Winning Eleven 7. Among first-time players, there is a very distinctive strategy that is common of them: run with the ball constantly until they are tackled or have a clear chance on goal. As players become experienced, they refine their playing style, inventing their own strategies as they go. It is, in fact, the implementation of a workable strategy that separates truly great players from merely good players. Naturally, a lot of tactical development is specific for each different person. There are, however, certain pieces of information that should help the learning curve between a novice and an expert. This chapter is designed to teach this very information, giving you a big advantage when taking your first steps on the way to football glory! -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 04.a Choosing Your Starting Line-up -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Easily the most crucial element of basic tactical employment is choosing the best eleven men to play in your initial team. With some teams boasting a forty-man squad to choose from, the permutations for making your starting line-up are many and varied. As you might expect, a certain amount of knowledge about your chosen side's squad is always a good start, as is being familiar with some of the big-name players like Ronaldo, Beckham and Henry. In most cases, you should use this knowledge when picking your team. If, however, you are a more casual \"fan\" of the sport, all is not lost. Using the following basic algorithm, you should be able to pick a very strong squad from the players available: 1) Look at the players stats. Substitute players possessing low attributes with players possessing higher attributes. For reference, you can press (R2) on the \"Formations\" screen for a polygonal graph that shows the distribution of the players skill. 2) Press (L1) once to view the stamina (a green bar) and the form (a coloured arrow) of each player. A rough guide to the arrows is as follows: Red - The player is on a \"hot streak\" and will play very well. Orange - The player is doing well and should be chosen. Green - Indicates an average performance will be had. Blue - Player performance is mediocre. Avoid playing. White - Player is in dreadful condition. AVOID! Red, Cross Shape - The player is badly injured and cannot play Orange, Cross Shape - The player is injured, and will play poorly if chosen Arrow surrounded with a Red Square - Recovering from serious injury Arrow surrounded with an Orange Square - Will reach full fitness after one game. (If you have a monochrome TV... hahahahahahahahahaha!) If you have any players on your team whose stamina is less than 70%, or their form arrow is blue/white, remove them from the team, and replace them with players of corresponding position and better playing condition. 3) Check that your team is suitable for your individual playing style. For example, if a long-ball strategy is desirable (is it ****?), substitute strikers who are lacking in height. If you want a passing game, remove midfielders and forwards with poor stats in that area. 4) You have chosen your best line-up. Go get 'em, tiger! * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 04.b Formations -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Your current formation is displayed in the panel above your squad list. The yellow dot is your goalie, the blue dots are defensive players, the green dots are your midfield and the red dots are your attackers. By pressing (L2) and (R2) you can change this to display each players attack attitude (covered later) and their squad number. In the Formation sub-menu, you can: - Choose a formation from a selection of 21 premade formations - Create a custom formation - Set a player's defensive role The default formations are as follows: Default - The formation the team plays in real life... supposedly. 4-5-1 A - A well balanced formation with two OMFs supporting a lone striker 4-5-1 B - A more defensive version of 4-5-1 A. 4-4-2 A - The classic \"Diamond\" formation played by Bayern Munich 4-4-2 B - Another variation on 4-4-2 formation with the Midfielders in the center 4-4-2 C - The most commonly used formation in English football. Sven swears by it, I tend to swear at it, but it's all personal preference. 4-3-3 A - Uber-attacking formation with 5 offensive players 4-3-3 B - As above, but with one of the OMFs moving into a more defensive position 4-3-3 C - A flat midfield line that is more likely to cut out forward passes 3-6-1 A - Offensive formation in more ways than one! Utter **** 3-6-1 B - Fills the midfield but leaves the CF stranded 3-5-2 A - Attacking formation that pays off with practise 3-5-2 B - Defensive variation of 3-5-2 A 3-4-3 A - In my opinion, the best formation available. 3-4-3 with a diamond midfield. Now if only it was this effective in Championship Manager! 3-4-3 B - Like above, but with two DMFs and two OMFs. Not enough width for my liking and can leave you exposed 3-4-3 C - Same idea but with a flat midfield. Good if you are weak defensively 5-4-1 A - Good. If \"good\" means a nil-nil draw. 5-4-1 B - Ditto. 5-4-1 C - Why did they bother? 5-3-2 A - Strong defence at the expence of the midfield. Good for when you are starting out at Master League. 5-3-2 B - Same idea but with a defensive twist 5-3-2 C - Like Marmite and Eurovision, you either hate it or you love it. No, wait... EVERYONE loves Eurovision!! (omg sarcasm) If you want to adapt your formation slightly to fit with your playing style, this is the place to go. WE7 has just about the most flexible formation editor I've seen! Basically, if you're good enough to use this, then you don't need me to explain it, you just select a player and move him to the desired position. You'll work it out ;-) * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 04.c Player Settings -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Defence Type ------------ Here you can toggle the method each player defends with. Here's a brief definition of what each one means. Covering (CV) - Player's priority is to not allow any ball to breach his line rather than focusing on any particular region or player. Zone Mark (ZN) - The player defending all balls within his region. The simplest way to defend. Man Mark (##) - Marks the selected player and tries to force him out of the game. Attack Attitude --------------- This is where you set each players attitude. Has less effect on the gameplay than you might expect, but it give you the opportunity of turning fullbacks into wingbacks by encouraging them to make forward run. Other than that it's fairly redundant as most players will respond more to their \"Attack\", \"Defense\" and \"Teamwork\" stats. It's a nice inclusion though. Kicker, etc. ------------ Here, you can set the team's captain, and who takes the free kicks and corners for your side. Captains should have a high Mentality stat, whilst set-piece takers requirve respectable stats for Free Kick Acc., Power, Curving and Shot Accuracy. Also, take heed of the player's prefered foot, as ideally you want a left-sided player taking the left corner kicks. Of course, if your player has the \"Outside\" special ability then you're sorted anyway! * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 04.d Strategies -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- A \"strategy\" is a very precise series of movements or actions, and in Pro Evolution Soccer 3 a wide range of strategies can be implemented by holding (L2) and pressing any of the face buttons (circle, triangle, etc.). You can assign any of these strategies to your team in the \"Formations\" screen before a match. The strategies you can perform are: Normal - Balanced play Centre Att. - Focus all attacking play into the centre by moving all wide players inwards R. Side Att. - Focus all attacks on the right wing L. Side Att. - Focus all attacks on the left wing Opp Side Att. - If your left winger has the ball, activating this causes all your right-sided players to flood the attacking area and vice versa. Change Side - All wide midfielders and attackers switch side, to confuse the opposition and leave their marking in tatters CB Overlap - Allow the centre back to join the attacking play Zone Press - Stifle the player with the pass to attempt to regain possession Counter Att. - Increase the gap between forwards and the midfield, making long ball, \"Route 1\" style play more effective. Offside Trap - Requires immaculate timing. Causes the defense to move forward simultaneously in an attempt to catch the opposing striker in an offside position. Needs to be executed exactly 2 seconds before the pass is made. 2x Formation - Change to the formation specified. * * * * * * * * _____________________________________________________________________________ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- S T A R S & S T A T S ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- _____________________________________________________________________________ -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 05.a - Attributes Explained -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- The ability of each player in Winning Eleven 7 is determined by a variety of numerical values called attributes. A high value indicates that the player is very able at the field specified. A low value means that they are very poor in this field. Here, I will explain what each attribute means and it's affect on the player possessing it. If you want to view your player attributes, then they can be found easily in the Formations screen, or in the Transfers screen if you are playing in Master League mode. If, for some reason, you would like to change the values of a particular player, this can be achieved in Edit Mode, under the \"Modify Player\" section. These are the definitions of each attribute: Attack ------- Sets the attacking ability of the player. A high attack stat favours attacking players such as strikers and wingers. Defence ------- Sets the defensive ability of the player. As you might expect, this favours defensive positions such as... drum roll... defenders and goalies. Balance ------- Determines how sturdy the player is, thus determining the players resistance to challenges by the opposition. As a general rule, if your player's Balance stat is higher by 20 than the challenging player's, your player will not be affected by a tackle. This, however, is not true of aerial challenges. Stamina ------- Determines the players endurance. A player with a high Stamina stat will fatigue less quickly, and is therefore likely to perform better than a player with low stamina during the closing stages of a match. Top Speed ------- Sets the players maximum speed when running. Increases the player's speed when dribbling to a certain extent. Particularly useful for wingers. Acceleration ------- This affects the amount of time required for a player to reach maximum speed. A high value means a player will reach maximum speed in a shorter time. Response ------- The higher this value, the more sensitive the player is to stray balls. For goalies, this means that the 'keeper is more likely to successfully perform a \"reaction save\". A striker with a high response will be able to make clever runs between pairs of defenders, but this creates a higher risk of being caught in an offside position. Agility ------- This attribute refers to how nimble the player is. A high value allows the player to make precise movements suddenly, for example a goal-keeper diving for the ball or a striker performing an overhead volley. Dribble Accuracy ------- Affects the player's capabilities when running with the ball. A high value means the player will run with the ball closer to his feet, thus allowing him to change direction more quickly. Dribble Speed ------- The higher this value, the difference in speed between running with or without the ball is lessened greatly. Short Pass Accuracy ------- Affects the accuracy of your players ground passes. A high value increases the success rate of passes by this player. Short Pass Speed ------- A high value equals quicker passes, which in turn reduces the likelihood of the opposition intercepting your ground passes. Long Pass Accuracy ------- The higher this value, the better the accuracy and success of long passes. Long Pass Speed ------- The higher this value, the greater the velocity of long passes and crosses. Shot Accuracy ------- Determines how likely a shot will be on target. A high value results in more accurate attempts at goal. Shot Power ------- The higher this value, the more powerful a player's shot is. Players with high power stats are more likely to score as the 'keeper has less time to react to shots. Shot Technique ------- This stat determines how likely a player is to score from difficult positions, e.g. long-distance or when the angle is tight. Free Kick Accuracy ------------------ The higher this value is, the more potent a players dead-ball attempts will be. Sets the error tolerance when taking free-kicks. Curling ------- Sets the amount of curve the player can put on the ball from free kicks and corners. Does not seem to have any effect in open play. Header ------- The higher this value, the more accurate a headed pass or shot will be. Jump ------- Determines how high the player can jump, thus increasing the likelihood of winning aerial confrontations. Technique ------- How skilful a player is. Players with a lower value tend to bounce the ball too much when controlling the ball, making it easier for the opposition to close the player down. The higher the value, the more quickly the player can collect a pass and make a useful move. Aggression ------- Players will commit to tackles more fiercely if they have high aggression stats. Goalies will be more likely to involve themselves in the tousle near the goalmouth when free kicks and corners are being taken. A player may also be more inclined to break through the defense single-handed when attacking. Mentality ------- The higher this value, the effect of fatigue on the player's performance will be lessened. The player will tend to make an extra effort and play better when his team is losing. A low value in this situation can result in the player refusing to apply himself fully during the later stages of the match. Consistency ----------- This value, scored out of eight, determines how well a player can hold his form. The higher the number, the more likely he is to maintain good performances in consecutive matches. Goal Keeping Skills ------------------- This value basically shows the user how appropriate it would be to play a player in the position of goalkeeper. Team Work ------- The higher this value, the more likely it is that passes to other players will succeed. Also, the player is more perceptive to the actions of other players and will make more intelligent plays to accomodate their style of playing. When signing players in Master League, players with good Teamwork stats will fit in to the squad much more quickly than players with lower stats in this area. Condition/Fitness ----------------- The general level of fitness of a player. The higher this attribute, the better he will maintain his stamina in consective league or tournament games. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 05.b - Special Abilities -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- These are the stars that can be seen under some players attribute lists. Players possessing these stars may be able to perform special abilities or they may be particularly adept in some areas such as dribbling or passing. These abilities, when combined with strong attributes can create exceptionally skilled players. To find out if a player possesses a particular ability, look for a star in the field you want to find out about, if a star is visible, the player has this talent. Here is a list of what all of the star abilities mean: Dribble ------- Computer controlled opponents or team-mates favour dribbling when in possession of the ball. Post Player ------- Improves the players ability when standing in the goalmouth during corners and free kicks. Also minutely affects the players teamwork and passing ability. Positioning ------- The player positions himself well in front of goal. Increases likelihood of a pass to him resulting in a chance on goal. Reaction ------- Increases the frequency of the player making darting runs at goals, but also increases the likelihood of being caught offside. Improves the effectiveness of goalkeepers. Scoring ------- Increases the player's goal-scoring rate. Essential for strikers. Playmaker ------- Allows the player to perform extremely well timed and paced passes towards the front line of attack. When controlling this player, other team-mates will assist you by running into helpful positions in front of goal. Passing ------- Players with this ability have increased awareness of his team-mates' position and his passes reflect this. Through passes are easier to time correctly when the passing player has this ability. Both Feet Feint ------- Allows the player to perform feints and \"dummies\" with both feet. See section 05.d (\"Feints, Flicks and Tricks\") for more information on how to perform these. Penalties ------- Increases the likelihood of scoring from a penalty kick. 1-1 Scoring ------- Makes a player more likely to score during one-on-ones. Also increases the effectiveness of chip-shots, in particular the low-trajectory, (R1), chip- shot. Long Throw ------- Throw-ins performed by this player can travel distances of up to 40m!! 1-Touch Pass ------- Improves the accuracy of direct-play or \"first-time\" passes. Outside ------- Allows the player to use the outside of his boot when taking free kicks or corners. Allows the player to curve the ball in either direction. Marking ------- A player with this ability is good at positioning himself, and he is able to stay with the player he is marking more effectively. D-Line Control ------- Increases the effectiveness of the \"offside trap\" by synchronising the forward movement of the defence. Penalty Stopper ------- Improves the goalie's ability to save penalty kicks. 1-on-1 Stopper ------- The 'keeper will be more responsive to shots from close range, and is more able to steal the ball from the feet of attackers. * * * * * * * * _____________________________________________________________________________ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- W I N N I N G S T R A T E G I E S ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- _____________________________________________________________________________ Short of coming round your house and showing you how to play, this is where you learn all the methods you will need to beat any opponent with (almost) any team. It won't happen overnight - it's taken me months! - but practise often and it will come. I have written each section so that each one corresponds to the level of skill required to win a game. Obviously, if you're an old hand at WE, then you might do cheeky things like rounding the 'keeper or shooting from 40 yards, but if this is the case then you probably don't need any help from me anyway. In Winning Eleven 7, there is much more to distinguish between the various difficulty settings than in previous games in the series. Now, CPU players behave with formidable intelligence in the harder difficulty levels, allowing the opposition players to intercept passes and mark your strukers more closely and effectively. They will also exploit the weaknesses of your team, relentlessly probing open spaces in your defence and pressuring your weaker defenders, sometimes ganging up on a particularly susceptible player, forcing a breakthrough and a chance at goal. So, you played WE6 and thought you were good? Think again, buddy! It'll take you weeks of playing this game before you're good enough to play 5-star! -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 06.a - 1-Star Difficulty -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Well, we all have to start somewhere. At this level, running with the ball trumps all other types of play due to the defenders' spontaneous bouts of narcolepsy. If you use a player with high dribbling stats (Owen, Babangida, Rivaldo) then this obviously helps. What you basically want to do is run with the ball until you are just inside the penalty area, tap ([]) and hold the d-pad/left analog stick in the direction of the goal. The opponent will very rarely intercept short passes, so full advantage should be taken of this opportunity. Make short passes from goal kicks or free kicks until your star-dribbler has the ball. All that needs to be done now is to nestle the ball neatly into the back of the net :-). In defence, just press the player with the ball and possession should be turned over to your team with ease. Avoid using slide tackles as the chances are it will land you in the ref's book. As long as you know the basic controls for the game, you really shouldn't have any trouble comfortably winning games at 1-Star Difficulty. I can win a ten minute game scoring 40+ goals, so the lack of a challenge means I rarely play games at this level. You should be too good for 1-Star within a couple of weeks of playing. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 06.b - 2-Star Difficulty -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- This mode is slightly trickier. Running with the ball is still encouraged, but now the defence are more vigilant in the box. Make sure the ball is always in motion by either passing or dribbling. Try to avoid confrontations with the opposition unneccesarily by passing early and running diagonally. Running in a straight line between the central defenders is a no-no. Sliding tackles need to become a part of your repertoire at this stage. You need to be able to effectively win the ball without giving away free kicks or penalties. Make good use of any corners or free kicks and don't be afraid of taking a direct shot if it's at close range. If you can, use one-twos to split the defence open for an easy chance on goal. Take advantage of the A.I. players' rigidity. Defensive players will converge around the ball carrier, leaving an awful lot of space for your speedy center-forward to dart in unmarked. Use your full-backs to support your wingers in attack. Get your winger to lure the opposite full-back out from their position, then unleash a through pass forward for your own full-back to run onto and make a cross. Depending on your knowledge of football as a sport, it may take between a fortnight to a few months to perfect. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 06.c - 3-Star Difficulty -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Right, this is where the difficulty curve takes a sharp incline. You can't simply rely on running around the opposition (a la FIFA). Instead, a certain degree of tactical nous is required to really succeed at this setting. Firstly, you need to find out what your team's strngths are and play your matches accordingly. For example, if you play as Nigeria, you need to take advantage of their high speed and attacking stats by attacking constantly in a barrage of shots and high-speed dribbling to frustrate their defence. If France is your choice then play like them and dominate the midfield and control the possession. Remember, if they don't have the ball, they cannot score. Don't be afraid to play \"negative football\" and concentrate on shutting down all their attacks. Of course if the opposition's defence is weak, then this method is not such a good idea. If, however, you are 3-2 up with 2mins on the clock, do not bother trying to get a fourth as the resulting counterattack could bury your lead. Pass intelligently. Do not simply hoof the ball upfield and hope for the best. Look for unmarked players in open space and give them the ball. Take every opportunity to score and do not get cocky (rounding the keeper, dribbling in your own box, trying to score with your goalie). Practise set-plays often to take full advantage of the opportunity to score without any defensive pressure. You should be able to construct a scoring opportunity with all of your corners, 80% of which should be capitalised on even at this level. Switch between the flanks to confuse the opposition. This takes a bit of practise but it is a very impressive technique. Trevor Brooking gets particularly excited about this. To switch, hold the d-pad towards the opposite flank and press the long pass button (usually (O)) and fill the gauge until it is roughly 2/3 full. Do all these things and before long you should be able to start taking on the big boys at Winning Eleven! * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 06.d - 4-Star Difficulty -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- NOTE: This is what separates the men from the boys. From here on the game starts to get seriously hard! Make sure you are a very competent player before taking this on. Simply being \"good at games\" is not enough, you need to think like a footballer and play at a very good standard. It took me months to get to a high enough level to play proficiently at 4- and 5-Star difficulty. Constantly try to find methods of creating goalscoring chances. Every pass should be forward and any confrontation with the opponent should be avoided by passing early. Take advantage of any \"star\" players you have in your team. Master the first-time pass and shot to catch your opponent on the break. You have to make every goalscoring chance count. Do not hesitate or make too many touches with one player as you increase the risk of losing possession. Use your own judgment to determine whether a shot is practisable and work upon improving your reaction times to allow you to react quickly to a defensive press. Once a player within arms length of you then you will almost certainly lose the ball unless you pass immediately. Use feints effectively to acquire free kicks near the edge of the box. You should be able to score most free kicks within 30m of goal. Do not waste a single set piece; scoring from corners is a particularly effective way to win matches. This is a relatively short section, but there's a lot to learn here. Learn it and you will be well on your way to winning regularly at this level. * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 06.e - 5-Star Difficulty -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Hmm, it doesn't get much harder than this. You've basically got to incorporate everything mentioned before, but you also need a bit of something that cannot be taught: LUCK! That's right, luck. There are some game where you will do everything right, and still you will fall foul of the other team getting a lucky deflection or a dubious penalty decision, and there is nothing you can do to avoid it! It can be frustrating, but it creates a very realistic and tense atmosphere in each and every game. Your best friend in 5-Star is the scanner. Using this, you can easily see where there is space for your players to run into. It never lies! This helps because you can view areas of the pitch otherwise invisible due to the restrictions of the camera angle. As a general rule, you should not pass the ball anywhere that you cannot see on screen. So, unless you are phenomenally talented, those 40-yard ground passes are not going to get through. Just keep it simple, and concentrate on building up a solid attack line. You will very rarely score more than three goals in a game, so once you have reached this amount you should concentrate on defending your own goal, as there is nothing more annoying than throwing away a solid lead through lapse defending. The opposition defence are extremely efficient at shutting you down, and will do so within a second or two of receiving the ball. Be swift in your actions, and try to hold the majority of ball possession. Wow, there isn't much else I can say to help you now. If you're good enough for this level, then you already know it all. Good luck in your matches... ... You'll almost certainly need it! * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 06.e - Scoring Strategies -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- In every football game I have ever played, there are always certain methods that practically guarantee a goal. Previous Winning Eleven games had many, many of these, but this year's effort has managed to iron out many of these. However, as the Zen Buddhist's say, \"only God is perfect\", and there are still a few defensive lapses that the CPU commits almost every time. What you need to know is how to exploit them. So far I have discovered five surefire ways to score, two of which come from set-pieces. So, in order of effectiveness, here they are: OVER THE TOP ------------ - What is it? A crafty, incisive ball played over the heads of the defence, allowing your striker to dart past, control the ball and nestle the ball into the back of the net. - How do I do it? With the ball in the possession of your midfielders, set your team's attack attitude to red (by holding (L2) and tapping (R1) to change the gauge) and hold-up the ball until your forwards have re-positioned themselves in front of goal. Once this is the case, dash diagonally away from the player you want to pass to and simultaneously hold (L1) and (^). The brief change in direction by your midfielder should sufficiently wrong -foot the defenders, leaving your forward with ample space to bear down on goal. My favourite discovery since buying WE7! Ease of use - 7/10 Effectiveness - 9/10 THE DIAGONAL THROUGH PASS ------------------------- - What is it? Another simple method that can be extremely useful when starting out in Master League, where your players are too slow to perform darting runs. Possibly the most satisfying way to score against human opponents. - How do I do it? This works best if one of your CFs plays slightly deeper than the other, creating a natural \"link-up\" style of play. For some reason, the CPU is nowhere near as good at judging diagonal passes as it is at straight ones. Exploit this frequently by passing diagonally between the central defenders. The defenders cannot deal with this easily, increasing your likelihood of scoring dramatically. Be careful about getting caught offside though! - Ease of use - 7/10 - Effectiveness - 8/10 THE LIGHTNING CORNER -------------------- - What is it? A low-trajectory corner that is too quick for the CPU goalie to deal with. Success rate from scoring with headers is greatly improved. - How do I do it? Don't adjust the direction of your corner, just hold [U] and fill the gauge to about 2/3 full. The resulting ball should provide your attackers with a simple header on goal. - Ease of use - 9/10 - Effectiveness - 7.5/10 THE \"DEFENSIVE BUNCH-UP\" METHOD ------------------------------- - What is it? By passing the ball in an unpredictable but precise manner, you should be able to lure the opponent's back line into clumping around one corner of the pitch, leaving the opposite corner critically exposed. - How do I do it? For best results, apply this strategy to a team that is good at counter -attacking (good pace, positioning, passing, etc.) like France, Brazil or the Netherlands (my personal favourite). Feed the ball to your central midfield player, and run forward with the ball until you are just a shade in advance of the centre circle. Hold-up possession briefly and use the shoulder buttons to increase your team's attacking mentality. Once your wingers and forwards are in the final quarter of the pitch, play a powerful long-pass towards either corner flag (almost fill the gauge with the (O) button). With a bit of luck, the ball should drop at the feet of one of your centre forwards, who has the choice of slamming a low cross across the face of the goal or turning inside for a shot. Alternatively, if you have two very attacking wingers, like Real Madrid, the pass may reach one of them instead of the striker, giving you much the same choices. At first, this may not seem all that useful, but practice your timing and it will be a very valuable addition to your teams creative armoury. Ease of use - 5/10 Effectiveness - 7/10 FORCING THE ERROR ----------------- - What is it? A good way to frustrate the defence and ensure a clear shot on goal. Good if your team has a couple of big shooters. - How do I do it? Once you are approaching the opponent's 18-yard box, use (L2) + (R1) to set your teams attitude to all-out attack (red). Keep passing the ball between players on the edge of the box. Patience is the key, so keep waiting for a gap to appear in the defense. When there's a clear shot available, take it. - Ease of use - 6/10 - Effectiveness - 8/10 THE \"ONE-TWO\" ------------- - What is it? A movement that involves two players making a quick exchange of passes to get the better of a defender. - How do I do it? Get to the edge of the box and pass using (L1)+(X), followed by a sharp tap of triangle. The return pass will go behind the defender, allowing your player to run onto it and score. - Ease of use - 6/10 - Effectiveness - 6/10 THE LOW CROSS ------------- - What is it? A very, very quick, low-trajectory pass that is performed by tapping (O) three times quickly. It's very good at getting behind the defensive line leaving your attacker with a tidy one-on-one with the keeper. - How do I do it? If you have two pacy attackers with good reactions, e.g. Argentina, give the ball to one of them and have him run out wide. Once you are nearing the corner of the field, cut inside the SB who is chasing you and unleash a low cross into the box. You should be able to half fill the shot gauge pre-emptively and allow your other forward to strike with his first touch. Speed is the key to this move's effectiveness, so the more you practice this, the more often you will score. Really, really useful when performed skilfully. - Ease of use - 5/10 - Effectiveness - 8/10 THE STRAY SB ------------ - What is it? This one has served me well during the years. It's a simple enough manoeuvre that manages to completely fool the CPU defenders practically every time. - How do I do it? Give the ball to one of your central midfielders and have him dribble down either wing. Don't hold (R1), normal pace should be enough. Eventually, the CPU side back will become frustrated and will stray out of his position, leaving a big gap for your winger to run into. Knock a through-pass forward for your SMF or WG and have him center the ball. The defence doesn't have enough time to react to this, leaving you with an uncontested header on goal. This takes a lot of practice to master. Its all about luring out the defender, without allowing him to tackle you. - Ease of use - 4/10 - Effectiveness - 6/10 * * * * * * * * _____________________________________________________________________________ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- M A S T E R L E A G U E M O D E ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- _____________________________________________________________________________ -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 07.a Introduction to Master League Mode -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Master League Mode is, without a doubt, the most addictive mode in any football game ever! The basic premise of the mode is to manage a team of nobodies and - via some intelligent player acquisition - turn them into World beaters. There are five difficulty settings, ranging from easy to near-impossible, and you have a choice of 64 teams to play as. As in the real World, doing well in various club competitions will reward you with more funding to transfer players from other teams. Some of the better players don't come cheap, so signing the big names like Del Piero or Thierry Henry needs to be backed up with some championship-winning form. You also need to keep the money coming in to pay each player's wages, other -wise you'll end up like Leeds United in no time at all! So, in this chapter of the FAQ, I hope to fill you to the brim with all the knowledge you'll need to take you from a novice to a master [no pun intend -ed!] of this mode. Hold on tight, and pin back your ears; I'm only gonna say this once... * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 07.b Setting Up a Season -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- From the main menu screen, select \"Master League Mode\" and choose the \"New Game\" option. Press (X) again to proceed to the General Settings screen. Here, you can tweak the various aspects of game-play in your Master League career. Most of the options here are fairly self-explanatory, but if you are having trouble then you can use the scrolling Help bar at the foot of the screen. If it is your very first season, set Difficulty to \"*\", Injuries and Accumulated Fatigue to \"No\". You can also set the Acquisition Difficulty field to one star to make transferring players much easier. After you have finished setting up your season, choose the \"Proceed to Team Select\" option and press (X) to be taken to the Select Team screen. Choose your team from the list and press (X) again to confirm your selection. The next screen you will arrive at is the \"Select League\" screen. The leagues on offer are Northern League, Southern League, Western League and - yep, you guessed it! - Eastern League. These titles all refer to the relative location of the teams that play within each competition, so you should chose your league based upon the origin of your selected teams. If you chose a British (i.e. English or Scottish) team, you will be best suited to the Northern League. Italian sides are all grouped into the Southern league, along with the Turkish and Greek club teams. The Eastern League is home to the German Bundesliga and Dutch Premier teams, while the French, Spanish and Portuguese teams are featured in the Western League. Regardless of the region you choose, your first season will be played in Division Two, with the league consisting of Fulham, Brescia, Monaco, Lens, Auxerre, Benfica, PES United and your chosen team. If you chose one of the default Division Two teams, them WE United will also be included in the starting Division. After you have chosen the appropriate region to play in, daintily tap the (X) button and your ML season will start! Exciting, eh? * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 07.c Competitions -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- In Master League (\"ML\" from now on) mode, you always start your first season in the bowels of Division Two (D2). Your ultimate goal to attain in your first season is to finish first or second in D2 and be entered into the play-offs, which is a four-team league comprising of the top two D2 teams and bottom two D1 teams in terms of their finishing league positions. These four teams will then play each other once, with the top two teams in the group being promoted to D1, and the bottom pair facing relegation to D2. In a standard league season, you need to play every other team in your group twice: one home fixture and one away fixture. If you go to your Division's Information screen, you will be shown a rankings table that bears this format... | Rank | Team | Pt | W | D | L | GF | GA | F/A | The Rank and Team fields go without explanation, while the W, D and L values refer to your teams number of Wins, Draws/Ties and Losses respectively. The \"Pt\" column refers to your teams league points (NOT the same as transfer points). Three points are awarded to your team for a win, and one point is earned for a tie. Teams are ranked based on the number of points held by each team, with the highest points team in first position. Should the points be level, the GF, GA and F/A columns come into play. Your GF column states the number of goals you have scored in a league season, while the GA column refers to your goals conceded. The F/A column simply states the difference between these values, and in the event of two or more teams being level on points, whoever has the highest \"goal difference\" will take the higher posit -ion. If you do manage to get promoted into D1, your initial (and most important) task is to avoid being relegated back into D2. Once your team is consoli -dated in D1, you will obviously want to be challenging for the D1 Champion -ship, which will be rewarded with big prize money. Another bonus for teams in the top six places in the league is the chance to be entered into the cleverly-name \"WEFA\" competitions. Finishing 1st or 2nd offers automatic qualification to the WEFA Championship, which is the most prestigious contest in Master League mode. Teams ranking between 3rd and 6th place have to pass a qualifying round, the winners of which also participate, while the losers take part in the lesser \"WEFA Masters' Cup\". Both of these competitions offer titanic sums of money for those teams and players competent enough to win it. Also, to supplement your team's income during the league season, there are two cups which run in parallel with the ordinary league fixtures. These are the Division 2 Cup and the Division 1 Cup, and every team from each respect -ive league are entered. The two cups are very much auxillary to the rest of the ML season, with no wages paid to players, no fatigue aggregated, and no effect on your overall league position. It is worth making an effort in the cups, though, as a substantial amount of funds is the bounty for the winning side. So, to summarise, there are seven competitions to participate in during Master League Mode: Division One \\___________ Playoff Division Two / Stage WEFA Championship WEFA Masters' Cup D1 Cup D2 Cup As you can see, there's plenty to keep you busy as you strive for glory in the Master League! Next up, the points system... * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 07.d Earning Points -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- In Master League Mode, \"points\" are your currency. You need points to pay the wages for your squad and to transfer players in from other teams. The latter is an especially costly business, so you'll want to be earning as many points as possible. Points are awarded at the end of each game, in accordance with this formula... Points Earned = Result Bonus + Goal Bonus The values for each criteria vary depending on the type of match you are playing, e.g. a Division One match win is worth more than a win in Division Two. During league matches, a \"wages\" total will be deducted from the Points Earned total, which is used to pay the players' wages for that week. Of course, the more top players you have on your payroll, the greater the amount deducted will be. Upon winning a competition, you will be awarded a vast amount of points. The higher the competition's reputation, the greater this points value will be. Here are the amounts awarded for winning any of the six ML trophies: Division One - Division Two - WEFA Championship - WEFA Masters' Cup - Division One Cup - 1,000 pts Division Two Cup - 1,000 pts (On top of this, you'll win a bonus of 1,000 points if one of your players is named top scorer or assistor in the division you are playing in.) * * * * * * * * -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 07.e Improving Your Squad -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- If you want success in Master League, you're going to need a strong squad of players behind you. Sadly, the 23 men supplied to you at the start of your campaign aren't exactly World Class talent. Because of this, you will need to draft in players from rival teams to strengthen your squad of nobodies into the zeitgeist of World football. Unfortunately, tempting players like Zidane, Shevchenko or Nedved to join your team is a costly business; not only must you meet the player's wage demands, you also need to compensate his club with a \"transfer fee\" in some cases. Also, the reputation of your club plays a big role in the likelihood of big-name players joining your team. If you're a Division Two straggler with no prospect of winning any silverware or being promoted, someone play -ing for the Division One champions is not likely to want to make the descent in both wages and reputation. Finally, if the player you are buying is a star player, who is a mainstay of his club's first team, expect to pay over the odds to acquire him. The first step when improving your team is to find a suitable player to transfer. How you do this is your own choice, but the three obvious methods would be: 1) Using your knowledge of the real World, signing players who are well known and established in the professional game. 2) Taking note of players who play particularly well against you. 3) Using Konami's \"Player Search\" function, which is found in the \"Negotiations\" screen. In your first couple of seasons in Master League mode, you should obey the simple rule: \"don't buy substitutes\". In other words, if you already have two good strikers in your team, but still retain your original defensive line, it is a defender rather than a forward that you should be scouting for. Once you have a player in your sights, you need to wait until the \"transfer window\" (which occurs in the off-season period and during a fixed number of weeks half-way through the season) opens, at which point you are able to make an offer for him. Choose \"Team Management\" from the Master League screen, then go to the \"Negotiations\" screen. The \"Negotiations\" screen has a lot of very important roles in the running of your team, but for now we will only deal with the functions involved in acquiring a new player. Select the \"Apply\" option (which is the very first item in the list) then choose your searching method. If you know what team your desired player plays for, then choose \"Select by team\" for the quickest route to finding him. The \"Conditional Search\" option is great if you need a particular type of player, but don't have anyone in mind. You can specify various information, such as player's position, height, foot bias and make the game search for the best players that fit that criteria. Once you have located your chosen player, press the (X) button to bring up a sub-menu, and choose \"Apply for transfer negotiations\", which is also the very first item in the list. Once you have selected this, press the Triangle button three times to return to the \"Negotiations\" screen. Highlight \"Set negotiation parameters (In)\" and press (X) to begin transfer talks with the player's current club. On this screen, highlight the player you just declared an interest in, and press (X) to allow you to adjust the player's contract conditions. There are three values you need to consider, with your most immediate concern being the \"transfer points\" value. For some of the best players in the game, this total can exceed 20,000 points, so make sure that your bank balance can take such a substantial pounding. Generally, if you make a final offer 10% more than the base transfer value of the player, the club will release the player. Your next problem is convincing the player in question that he really wants to play for you. As mentioned before, this is where your club's reputation really makes a difference. If you have just won the WEFA Championship, then practically every player will want to be on your payroll, however a newly -promoted Division One team will have a much harder time buying players.
