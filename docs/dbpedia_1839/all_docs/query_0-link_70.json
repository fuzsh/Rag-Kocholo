        "text": "Good article, Paul. You always manage to present a balanced argument, which some other journalists (who shall remain nameless!) seldom do.\n\nIt is an interesting debate, and yes indeed, beauty did fell the beast, but football was not always the fast flowing game it is today. I know it's a terrible generalisation, but it does have some truth in it - teams like the Hungary and Brazil sides of the fifties are often said to have created attacking football, certainly at international level. The archacic formations packed defence and midfield meaning often less atractive games often played out like chess matches. You only need to look to Italy today to see that this is still the process.\n\nIn my youth I was always told 'if you don't concede, you don't lose' and therefore always have a chance of winning (not that as a junior my team ever once thought about anything other than scoring as many goals as possible!), and it can pay dividens. When Spurs played Arsenal at White Hart Lane toward the end of the season, we relied on a sturdy defence (I use 'we' being a lifelong spurs fan!) to get us through, sure we created chances, but Arsenal were far superior in terms of possession and chances. We stifled them, Gomez played a blinder and we scored a wonder goal and a breakaway goal. That's football. If you're Greece, or anyone for that matter, setting out against one of the most potent attacking forces in world football then you could argue you have no choice. Samaras had the chance to put Greece ahead and if he did then perhaps a different reaction would be percieved in today's press.\n\nNow, I don't want to see anti-football taking over exciting football, but the object is to win the game, is it not? My memory may be hazy, but when England faced Argentina in the world cup in 2002, we spent most of the game on the back foot and defended like lions. Courage, defiant and warriors, the players were portrayed, but had we not 'won' a penalty, had David Beckham not despatched it then the story might've been different. In fact, the story was different come the quarters against Brazil and, after we took the lead we sat back, didn't cause a threat and were undone by a coalition of Ronaldinho, fluke and David Seaman...\n\nMy point being is that people remember results, not necessarily performances. It is only occasionally that one's abilities are remembered over one's accomplishments. Take the Dutch in 74. The best team in the world, stifled and defeated by the organised machine of West Germany and then again in 78 defeated by hosts, Argentina. As a contrast, take the Mathews' Final in '53 when Stan Mortensen scored a hat-trick and Stanley didn't even score, yet it is Matthews who is remembered for his performance though his inspiring second half performance.\n\nI think it is often forgotten that there is more to football than scoring goals, however some teams, as Greece showed last night, often forget that goals are part of the game altogether!\n\nHey everyone, I am Argentinean and I recently found this interesting posting on the BBC (the previous was Jonathan Stevenson’s https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jonathanstevenson/2010/06/are_argentina_the_new_brazil.html%29, after some wandering around over the international press in order to see what they think of the World Cup so far, and this time I couldn’t resist to drop a few comments.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely agree with the statement that the Greeks had nothing but to play like that, so what’s to say or complain about that (tough I do believe the arbiter should have given a couple of yellow cards earlier, when their defenders were coming out in turn of their imaginary lane to foul Messi); even ourselves have done that in, for e.g. Argentina Brazil in the 1990 World cup, when we were way inferior to them, and ended up winning. The most famous recent example, for that matter, is Mourinho´s strategy in the Champions final, against the very superior Barcelona team, which obviously paid off too. The point is that whoever wants to be an attacking team has to know that more often than not, you will have to deal with semi or full catenaccio (Italian for “Lock”) strategies, and of course you are the only responsible for breaking it, and if you can not, go cry at home but can not complain. It is as legitimate as any other.\n\nAbout Diego (as a coach or manager), I would like to throw some information that you probably don’t know: he was put there by the highly questioned and dictator like Grondona, known as the Argentinean, football “Godfather” (president of the AFA since 79, vice-president of FIFA since 1988, chairman of the billion U$S financials committee) only as a favour return for “prestige” earned as the AFA manager after Mexico 86, which catapulted him to FIFA later, under the likes of semi-mob people as Havelange and now Blatter (only to mention the 2, that for e.g., have resisted even to date the incorporation of technology to help the arbiters in name of objective justice, based naturally on ridiculous reasons to it, which just hide their obvious purpose) . Also, because he was the most claimed by the ignorant crowds, and some paid and arranged sectors of the sports media; not because his credentials as a coach. In the South Americans play-off he performed far from well, calling over 100 players in 15 months, never transmitting a game clear idea or system, losing vs. Chile, Brazil, Paraguay, and even Bolivia 0-6, and only qualifying in the last minute in two consecutive games. Finally, for the definitive list he left outside players even at their best like Cambiasso and Zanetti, but not for football reasons as you may be surprised. As it turns out, he also favours the internal semi-conspiracies groups, like the one with Veron and his followers, who had (and have) an internal fight with the formers stars of Inter, a similar case with the Gago case, that as we all know here, Higuain once asked out his girlfriend when team-mates in Madrid, and was never called again since by Diego. What about Heinze?, the most discussed player before the definitive 23 list: well, his brother runs a publicity company who very recently helped Diego a lot when he was broke (literally took him out of the hole), so they became sort of partners and secured the very dubious hardly skilled and far from his best, defender, a place in the final list. But did anyone know that before that list he made a semi-final list, with 30 players. As it was instantaneously discovered by the local press, most of the other players, virtually unknown even here, were represented by the same two or three managers, as most of the whole main team still are.\n\nWell, that tells quite a bit what I think of his style as a person, and also the people he surrounds himself with, and I haven’t told the half I know only because of space reasons.\n\nBut as for the selection of the players he has done a good (if even obvious) job; even here the statistics show (with the exception of Zanetti and Cambiasso) that they agree with at least 80% of the team, so the most respected coaches here when interview told so too.\n\nAnd once they stepped on African land, surprisingly enough, even for me, they all seem to be responding quite well among each other, and also to the coach orders too. Diego to his own luck, has taken mainly all good decisions too, with the exception of Jonas as a starter, and even in my view the inclusion of Veron as such too, although quite a lot of people disagree with that; in any event is not clear as we do not have an undisputed star to play in the classical number 8 position.\n\nBut obviously football players are not PHD holders and they seem to enjoy and feel better with a charismatic worm affectionate motivator type of person that with a clear conscious scientifically style like one (of course as long as they fell OK –and especially shut up about- with the 2nd paragraph statements that they all know).\n\nAnyway, I still hope that all keeps working out for the best- and we eventually win the Cup-, but I still have my doubts about the generally unskilled and unprofessional approach of Diego and his team could actually be rewarded with the World Cup. But except from Brazil, no one has shown even similar good level, so those are the guys to be afraid of (and Argentina too of course), and I hardly believe anyone else can rise to.\n\nBest regards from Argentina,\n\nAdolfo.\n\nBelieve me, unfortunately I cannot give you the specific sources as they are football political leaders and the players themselves which of course, they only give that information if they know you, you pay them, and above all keep their names in reserve. I am specifically from the city of Veron and Bilardo themselves and I’ve known them forever and talked to them uncountable times, as well as lots of other people who know them closely. I didn’t even mention (I let you to find out) the way Diego arrived after Basile, the forthcoming related issue with Riquelme, and only to give you a single source because he said that on public TV, the pitch helper from Basile (Jorge Ribolzi) told that Diego was “trash as a person” (my translation to “una basura como persona”. One source [Unsuitable/Broken URL removed by Moderator]In one of the most popular TV football shows which runs on Sundays, right before the start of the World Cup, a well known journalist explained openly live, exactly all I said before in the second paragraph of the 1st comment (43rd), a very long time after everyone around football indeed knew it long ago (and no one on air denied it, even one of his present closest friends and consultant –which Grondona did not allow to be part of Diego’s team-, but came up with lots of other crap against the journalist’s person)\n\nBut even if we didn’t know (or couldn’t confirm) any of the former, the question would remain: under what merits Diego earned the right to coach the national team? Whatever reason you may think about could be worth listening to, but for sure no one related to his merits as a coach.\n\nAnyway, regards to everybody again, and now that we know that England is in, we may even have to face you in the quarter finals if we beat Mexico, so with Capello coaching I would definitely bet that the guy from comment 46 (salamastra1) would have hit the right irony, but hope that he would be wrong (heh) as we all in fact hate defensive boring football. .\n\nRe39: Correct Paul. Nice commentary above. Let me add a couple of notes.\n\nIndeed from a neutral point of view, none wants to see matches with teams like Greece playing. Especially, none wants to see them playing against strong teams like Argentina with the potential to trash with ridiculing scores since Greece is one of those teams that developed in the 00s into a team that simply does not permit so easily large teams to perform any \"heroics\" (not that this did not occur at times). And it is not just the spectacle. Far from the spectacle, neutral viewers somehow have an inner need to divide the teams in hero-teams and worthless underlings and then see the hero-teams trash the underlings showing their superiority and then at the grande finale see the hero-teams do the clash of the Titans.\n\nWell commencing from the likes of Danmark back in Euro 96 and a number of other teams that rose in the mid 90s, like Cameroon, S.Korea, Croatia, Turkey, teams with different styles, competition increased and it would be never the same for the hero-teams. Football became much more democratic, more unpredictable and far more interesting than the usual Brazil, Italy, Germany, Argentina, France, Holland, Britain, Portugal, Spain. However, even today ask any such of the above \"neutral\" fans and he would pick 8 of the above 9 teams to have his dream quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\n\nThe offensive football (i.e. the basic tactic of putting the most capable attackers you have to score as many goals as possible) has been repeatedly beaten in the 70s and by the early 80s it was not even the main strategy (with the exception of Argentine). One only needs to note the fate of Brazil which throughout the 80s had remained with archaic tactics and managed to resurface in the 90s only after having done something for its defense, thus presenting a more balanced team. Yet, the 80s became almost a trauma and since the times of Italy it became an obcession to make everything possible to have on the top only offensive teams. Change this law, change that ball, etc. etc. Thus the overpraising of teams that run forward and the bashing of teams that play a more defensive style.\n\nHowever for the case of Greece there is a 3rd \"problem\". Not only it does not enter in the category of hero-teams, not only it plays defensively, but also it cannot even procide a hero-footballer. Back in 2004 this was obvious. What could the football-crazy kids in Poland, Britain, Spain, Hungary, Norway or... Luxemburg remember of Euro 2004? Which player out of the Greek team? Not only 85% of their names were unpronounceable, not only 100% of them were unknown but besides that, they did not have a particular player that distinguished; Greek team's EC was the result of a tight teamwork. But this does not sell. Teamwork does not appeal to kids and thus it does not sell. As much as defensive football does not sell. Hence the Greek team is double bashed - triple bashed if we take into account that many of the commentators are ex-footballers most of whom have seen the EC only from the tv. Sour grapes?\n\nPut it straight: even back in July 2004, no Greek ever claimed the Greek team was the best ever team to arrive on the planet and no-one claimed this or the other player to be of any status even close to the likes of the Portuguese superheros Figo, Costa and the prodigy back then Ronaldo. But the delight was to see the Greek team working in a tight system, under the given strategy of Rehagel, playing with perfect coordination a clean defense which was an international first: such a defense with no strong fouls - even yellow cards were given on the limit of clean-foul/yellow-card, such as the ones Maradona demanded for Greeks marking his shou-shou Messi. Which paid off in beating 2ice Portugal favorite, inside Portugal, and stealing the cup from the hands of little Ronaldo who was left on the pitch crying his sorrow out!\n\nIt would be difficult for Greece to repeat it in 2008 as everyone knew the tactics by heart. But did the less predictable team, Danemark, do anything else after 1996 either? No. People did not bash Danmark though, they did something worse: they totally forgot about them.\n\nBack in 2008 Greece indeed played 1 very dull first game, a slightly better second and a quite OK third (but was too late and left the competition). And a defensive team when plays dull it is plain bad. True. In this 2010 WC despite being 6 years older, the oldest team, the most tall, the most heavy, they started with a dull performance caused by momentary confusion, then they played much better in the second game winning 2-1 breaking not only the team's bad record in WCs but also being the first team of this WC to upturn a negative score, and last, they played an excellent game of defensive football of the exact style that got them the EC back in 2004.\n\nShearer perhaps he wants to forget about this last fact as well of the 2 following remarks:\n\n1) Ball possesion was about an impressive 80% for Argentina. Yet the first real occasion for scoring came from Samaras in the second half!!!! This alone says a lot of how it could evolved.\n\n2) Messi could only pass the ball. Others faired only slightly better.\n\n3) Greeks did some fouls but no foul was strong like the ones we saw in other matches. Maradona* protested especially over the marking of Messi but while young Messi was pushed around by the match more corpulent Greeks (tallest and most heavy team of this WC), this was over-exaggerated and one needs only see what happens to other matches (legs, knees, heads... total war) to understand this.\n\n4) ON THE CONTRARY: none ever cared to notice that it was Argentinians that really hit hard upon Greeks out of their frustration of beng unable to pass over them. In 2nd half they became so nervous that they hit Karagounis who could not march properly and Torosidis, forcing Rehagel into 2 unecessary substitutions in early 2nd half of defenders who were playing brilliantly till then. Yet French commentators (I saw it in French tv) did not even go into the trouble of commenting on Karagounis* & Torosidis and accused Rehagel of destroying his chances. Incredible!\n\n2) While anyone can claim that statistically with 80% ball possesions Argentina would at some time score, the dull reality is that both Argentinian goals came by chance. 1 scored by an (underperforming in this game) defender Demichelis, the other in the last minute when it was all over (given the result of S. Korea-Nigeria), by Palermo, a 36 years old veteran who enterred \"for the honour\".\n\n* Did anyone notice that after the game - and while later he naturally tried to justify his team's non-impressive performance down to Greek \"strong foul-prone marking\" - Maradona went on to the Greek side to apologise to Karagounis for what he had shouted to him during the game in the 1st half and when Karahounis was hit hard by the Argentinian midfielders. And it is really to the honour of Maradona that he did so.\n\nThe above do not imply that Greece had ever any more chances to pass over Argentina. What they imply is that despite the phenomena and despite the incapacity of Greece to go to the attack leaving Samaras dancing alone the tango with 3 and 4 Argentinian defenders while all others were dancing syrtaki back in the defense, despite all that, Argentinians really rarely managed to deploy a proper attack like the ones we all know they do, and that means that if Samaras had scored - which was not far from happening - we were not really that far from having the miracle happening.\n\nBut I guess, the super-hero team scored 2ice even without its super-hero players doing it, that is what is written on the paper, the unfashionable dull team is out of the competitoin and that is what counts for most \"neutrals\".\n\nAgain I clarify this: this is 100% understandable. But the reality out there was much much different. Up to the last minutes all chances had been played. Each from his own corner, each with his own tactic."
