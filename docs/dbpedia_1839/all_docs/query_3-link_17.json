        "text": "When two matches are being played simultaneously as we had in Group A, it is not only the Coaches who have to work out strategy and tactics. It applies to fans as well. Do you watch one game in its entirety (making sure to skip spoilers - no half -time show, no internet and certainly no answering calls that come within minutes of the final whistle of game one)?\n\nAnother option is to watch the first half of each - again skipping possible spoilers. If available split screen might be to your liking.\n\nI started with the split screen but that only lasted ten minutes. Greece versus Russia was my first choice and I watched the first half than flipped at half time to watch the first 45 minutes of Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nOnce updated on first half action it was back to Russia and Greece but the last 15 minutes I watched in silence in order to avoid any loose-lipped commentator.\n\nRight on the final whistle it was back to the half point on the DVR'd Czech - Poland match. From there on it was relatively stress-free.\n\nGoing into round three of play Russia was the hot favorite to not only go through but to go through as group winners.\n\nSecond place Czech Republic knew that a win guaranteed them a knock-out spot and if Russia beat Greece, a draw would suffice.\n\nOn the other hand Poland and Greece were confronted with a simple choice - win or go home. Or in Poland's case - stay home.\n\nThat was how it started.\n\nOnce Greece took the lead just before half time it was a case of Russia and Greece qualifying as long as the Czech Republic and Poland remained tied.\n\nWhen Jiracek gave the Czech Republic the lead with 18 minutes to go things changed and they were set to qualify along with Greece. Nonetheless, a Russian equalizer would have meant an exchange of positions with Greece. At that stage Poland simply needed two goals to overtake the Czechs, Russia and Greece.\n\nBut there were no more goals so the Czech Republic maintains their excellent record in the European Championships and Greece pulls off what looked highly improbable going into round three.\n\nIt is one thing to write-off the Greek economy but you cannot write-off the Greece national soccer team. They never led in any of their matches until just before half time of round three when captain Giorgos Karagounis took advantage of dreadful defending by Russia to score.\n\nThrough some resourceful defending and doing just enough to keep Russia off balance in the second 45 minutes Greece somehow manged to parley just 5 shots on target over three games into three goals and a place in the last eight.\n\nOnce their noses were in front Greece defended well as a unit and would not allow Russia to penetrate through the centre of their defence. When it was needed bodies were thrown in the way of Russian shots as Greece recorded 12 blocked shots in this match.\n\nGiorgos Samaras who can so often be a frustrating player as he flits in and out of games played a key part in Greece's second half stonewalling of Russia. Asked to play in a wide position on the left side of attack Samaras was often the out ball for a Greece defence and midfield that was under almost constant pressure.\n\nThe postmortem on Russia's exit will be long, pointed and will come with mheavy casualties. Russia hemmed Greece in for much of the game but Russia's passing was labored, predictable and lacked originality.\n\nRussia failed to consistently turn the deep lying Greece defence mainly on account of slow ball circulation and bad choices when confronted with multiple-options.\n\nThe most telling statistic is of course the scoreline but what about this one - Russia had 31 attempts on goal, 12 were blocked, 14 off target and only two tested Greece keeper Michalis Sifakis.\n\nBut even then this was a game that Russia only needed to draw in order to qualify. The Greece goal was a series of blunders by Russia.\n\nA throw-in was needlessly conceded to start with. Then Russia had at least one extra man defending the Greece throw-in down the line but all three were badly positioned and made poor marking choices.\n\nLeft back Zhirkov was sucked forward and midfielder Denisov who should have moved to mark a Greece player was isolated and in no position to offer cover to defender Sergei Ignashevich.\n\nIn the Russia system, Ignashevich is supposed to be the free man who mops up the problems of others. This time a misplaced header from Ignashevich was the problem and no one was able to bail him out as Karagounis waltzed in to score.\n\nThe Czechs were without injured playmaker Tomas Rosicky and it made for a nervy first 45 minutes. The Czechs took until late in the first half to record their first shot on goal and even then it was along-range effort. But it was a much more composed and relaxed Czech side that emerged for the second half.\n\nIt is also ironic that in their opening game of round one the Czech Republic was dismantled by a ruthless Russia counter-attack; in round three it was a counter attack from the Czechs that created the only goal against Poland and helped the Czechs into the last eight. It was Petr Jiracek that finished off the move but it also took fine play from Tomas Hubschman and Milan Baros to set him up.\n\nJiracek has had a fine tournament and the goal against Poland was second of the tournament. But there were still some hairy moments as Poland pushed players forward the vain hope of scoring two goals. As the minutes ticked away it became more of a case of Poland the potential spoiler rather than Poland the group qualifier. With goalkeeper Petr Cech out of the Czech goal it was lucky that centre-back Michal Kadlec was on hand to clear what looked to be a last second goal bound shot from Poland.\n\nA goal at that stage and Russia would have been the benefactors.\n\nThere is a strong sense that their inexperience cost Poland throughout this tournament. After starting so strongly against Greece in round one Poland was fortunate to survive with a draw after Greece regrouped for the second half. A poor first forty five minutes against Russia was generally overshadowed by a fight back that gave Poland a 1-1 draw.\n\nThe same inconsistency was on show against the Czech Republic. In the first half Poland willing sacrificed possession for territory as they pushed the Czechs back and peppered the Czech's with attempts on goal. But often the attempts were taken from bad angles and posed little threat.\n\nAt the start of the second half there were a rash of free kicks given away by Poland. It offered the Czechs a foothold in the game and was also a clear indication of Poland's growing impatience - The Poles knowing that a win was needed.\n\nThe goal when it came was from Poland trying to press just a little too much. Defensive midfielder Rafal Murawski pushed forward but he telegraphed his pass and when Hubschman intercepted Poland was caught with too many players on the wrong side of the ball. A few touches later and the Czech Republic scored what turned out to be the only goal of the game.\n\nIt is a feature of tournaments - nobody wants to lose their first game but by the same token it is rare that teams that score impressive wins in their opener go on to have a strong showing. So it was with Russia. A 4-1 win overshadowed the actual Russia performance that took advantage of a Czech Republic side that was foolish enough to field a starting line-up with a defensive midfield specialist in Tomas Hubschman. By the time Hubschman was inserted at half time much of the damage had been done.\n\nNonetheless the result made stories of an attacking Russia side and a porous Czech defence inevitable - but it did not make the analysis correct. Eight days later Russia is heading home and the Czech Republic has extended its stay.\n\nComing up tomorrow the Group of Death - Group B - moves to the final round of play with every team retaining some chance to progress. Netherlands (1 pt) must beat Portugal (4 pts) by at least 2 goals to finish as group runners up and they also need Denmark (3 pts.) to lose to Germany (6 pts.). Germany can still fail to move on should they lose by more than a goal to Denmark and Portugal win. A draw could take Portugal through as long as Denmark don't beat Germany. And at the other end of the spectrum if Portugal lose by a single goal to Netherlands and Denmark also loses, Portugal moves on.\n\nIt is not simple."
