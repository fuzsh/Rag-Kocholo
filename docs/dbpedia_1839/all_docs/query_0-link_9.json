How do I fulfill this and add films or events using my Package?\n\nClick here to access your Elevent account and then click on the blue “Fulfill Package” button at the top right of your screen.

You will receive a ticket order confirmation email with further instructions on how to access the films once they become available.\n\nNOTE: you don’t need to fulfill your entire package at once; you can add some films or events and return later to select more.\n\nHow do I watch the film or event I bought a ticket to?\n\nYour ‘virtual access’ email will include a ‘view’ button, which links directly to the film on the Hellenic Film Society’s online screening portal.\n\nNOTE: the ‘view’ button will only be visible and active once the film is available to watch, according to the film start date and time.\n\nHow do I know when the film or event is available to watch?\n\nThe date and time of when the content is available to view is noted in your order confirmation email and can also be found on the event organizer’s website. This information is also included on the event organizer’s Virtual Search Page, which you can access by visiting goelevent.com, scrolling to find the event organizer’s name, and finding the film or event you bought a ticket to via the ‘Search Events’ button.\n\nHow long is the film or event available to watch?\n\nMost content is available for 72 hours from when you first hit ‘play’ unless otherwise communicated by the event organizer.\n\nNOTE: If you purchase your ticket, for example, on the last day of a festival or the last day that an event is available to watch, it will only be viewable until midnight on that day and regardless of how many hours your link says it is valid for.\n\nCan I pause/stop the film or event and finish it later or re-watch it at a later time?\n\nYes, so long you do so within the specified availability period as communicated by the event organizer, but note, once you’ve seen 95% or more of the film or event you won’t be able to replay it.\n\nCan I watch the content using different personal devices?\n\nYes, you can start watching content on, say, your iPad or iPhone and finish watching it on you computer or TV so long as all of your viewing happens using the same WiFi network and thus the same IP address. Note, if you started watching on your iPhone using cellular data and then tried to finish viewing on your laptop connected to your home WiFi, this won’t work.\n\nI bought tickets to different films or events. Will I receive just one email with the links and voucher codes for all of the films/events?\n\nNo. You will receive a different ‘virtual access’ email including a unique voucher code for each film or event you purchased a ticket to.\n\nNOTE: different content may have different start dates and times; you will receive your ‘virtual access’ email for each accordingly and one hour before the content becomes available to view.\n\nCan I watch the movie or event on my TV? Is there an app for the screening portal?\n\nIf you have Roku, Apple TV or Amazon Fire, you can search for and download the Elevent TV app. Be sure to search for ‘Elevent TV,’ including the space. Once you’ve downloaded the app on your TV, enter your 9-digit voucher code on the left under ‘Ticket Holders.’ See our Technical FAQ for more details.\n\nCan I gift my ticket to someone else by forwarding them my ‘virtual access’ email?\n\nUnfortunately not.

Do I have to watch this live or can I watch it later on?\n\nYou will need to begin watching this event at the stated ‘live’ time. You may join late, but you will not be able to access the content once the live stream has ended.\n\nI believe there’s a live Q&A or discussion following the film that I purchased a ticket to. How do I access that?\n\nIf this is the case, a link to the live discussion will be issued in a second ‘virtual access’ email that you will receive at the same time as your ‘virtual access’ ticket email, and/or there will be a link to this on the film or event page itself, which you can access with your virtual ticket. If you can’t locate these details, please contact the directly to inquire.\n\nNOTE: At present, you can link to live bonus content via the online screening portal, but not via the Elevent TV app (e.g. not on Roku, Apple TV or Amazon Fire).\n\nI also bought a festival or event pass. How do I access that?\n\nVisit our Virtual Pass FAQ for more information.\n\nHaving technical difficulties and need some troubleshooting advice?\n\nVisit our Technical FAQ.\n\nHow do I access content with my virtual pass?\n\nYour virtual pass is what gives you access to the screening portal.

How do I find the films or events?\n\nNeed not worry, this simply means the event organizer hasn’t made their content available yet. Refer to the event organizer’s website or check in with them directly if you’re unsure of when the festival begins or when the content will be playable from.\n\nNOTE: you don’t need to fulfill your entire package at once; you can add some films or events and return later to select more.\n\nI’ve logged into the screening portal and can see content listed, even watch trailers, but not the films or events themselves. Why?\n\nThis is because the films or events haven’t yet been made playable.
