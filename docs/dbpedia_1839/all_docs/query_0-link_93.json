This leadership was also defended in the following months. In 1994, this idea was taken up again, initially at the initiative of the Federal Border Guard. In 2010 this sum was 22.1 million euros.

According to the European Commission, Roma aspects should be systematically taken into account in all relevant European and national policies.
