The World Cup is the gaping hole on his resume and, at age 26 (turns 27 on June 24), this is pretty much the one he needs to win.

Cox/Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. is going to be one of the oldest teams in Brazil. The spine of the team remains very similar to the 2010 team. Tim Howard, Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey and Jozy Altidore, though Landon Donovan was surprisingly left off the squad. At the same time, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann has tried to give the team as much European credibility as possible. Jermaine Jones and Fabian Johnson (Germany) Aron Johannsson (Iceland) and Mix Diskerud (Norway), have all played prominently during the past four years.\n\nStrength\n\nAthleticism\n\nWeakness\n\nCentral defense\n\nRoad to Brazil\n\nAfter an early stumble against Honduras, the U.S. mostly breezed through Concacaf, qualifying for Brazil after the eighth of 10 games in the tournament, which they won with 22 points, four points clear of Costa Rica and the most points a U.S. team has ever won in qualifying. Despite the dominance, the U.S. scored just 15 goals in the 10 games, and they struggled to put away teams that were often closer on the scoreboard than on the field.\n\nThe Pitch\n\nManager\n\nJurgen Klinsmann: GER\n\nKey Players\n\nClint Dempsey\n\nAge:\n\n31\n\nPosition:\n\nFW\n\nClub:\n\nSeattle Sounders\n\nMichael Bradley\n\nAge:\n\n26\n\nPosition:\n\nMF\n\nClub:\n\nToronto FC\n\nJozy Altidore\n\nAge:\n\n24\n\nPosition:\n\nFW\n\nClub:\n\nSunderland\n\nTim Howard\n\nAge:\n\n35\n\nPosition:\n\nGK\n\nClub:\n\nEverton\n\nBradley is the quarterback.
