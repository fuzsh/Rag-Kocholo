        "text": "The headline for today’s entry is a couplet from the lyrics of an old Meat Puppets song called “The Mighty Zero,” which is about that most intriguing of numerals. For some reason I’ve been thinking about zero lately, so I decided to compile a list players who’ve worn zero or double-zero in the major pro sports. Here’s what I have so far (those with asterisks wore double-zero; all others wore zero):\n\nMLB: Don Baylor, A’s*; Bobby Bonds, Cardinals*; Jack Clark, Padres*; Tony Clark, Mets*; Paul Dade, Indians*; Oscar Gamble, White Sox; Curtis Goodwin, Reds*; Cliff Johnson, Blue Jays*; Jeffrey Leonard, Giants, Brewers, and Mariners*; Curtis Leskanic, Brewers*; Terry McDaniel, Mets; Oddibe McDowell, Rangers; Bobo Newsom, Senators*; Omar Olivares, Cardinals*; Al Oliver, multiple teams; Rey OrdoÃ±ez, Mets; Junior Ortiz, multiple teams; Joe Page, Pirates*; Franklin Stubbs, Brewers; Brandon Watson, Nats and Reds*; Rick White, Phillies and Reds*.\n\n[There are also several other double-zero MLBers mentioned in Jack Looney’s book, Now Batting, Number…: Jerry Hairston (at the end of his career with the White Sox), Rudy Seanez (for five games with Cleveland in 1991), and Jim Poole (a few games with Texas in ’91). But none of these are confirmed by baseball-reference.com, which lists uniform numbers for every MLB player. My experience over the years is that Looney’s book has more errors than baseball-reference.com, but both are definitely fallible. For now, I’m treating these three players’ double-zero status as unconfirmed.]\n\nNFL: Ken Burrough, Saints and Oilers*; Obert Logan, Saints; John Olszewski, Redskins and Lions; Jim Otto*, Raiders; George Plimpton, Lions (preseason only).\n\nNHL/WHA: Paul Bibeault, Canadiens; Martin Biron, Sabres*; John Davidson, Rangers*; Bernie Parent, Blazers; Neil Sheehy, Whalers. (Special thanks to Teebz for his help with these.)\n\nNBA/ABA: Pro basketball appears to be the mother lode for zero-clad players. According to basketball-reference.com, 46 players have worn 0, and another 26 have worn 00. Interestingly, three players appear on both lists, meaning they wore single-zero and double-zero: Benoit Benjamin (he reportedly wore single-zero with the 76ers in the mid-1990s, but I couldn’t find a photo of that), Mike Bibby, and Eric Montross. To my knowledge, these are the only players in any major sport with this unique distinction.\n\nA few notes:\n\n• I know that only one MLB team has had a 0 and 00 on the roster simultaneously: the 1985 Blue Jays, who had Al Oliver (0) and Cliff Johnson (00). No NHL or NFL team has ever managed the 0/00 trick. I haven’t yet tried to cross reference those NBA lists to see if single- and double-zero players have ever been teammates. Anyone know?\n\n• Have there been zero-clad soccer players? If so, clue me in.\n\n• As is my frequent habit, I’ve ignored college sports here. If anyone wants to try to document zero-clad NCAA players, in any sport(s), please feel free.\n\n• If you have photos for any of the non-photo-linked names cited above, let’s have a look at ’em.\n\n• I’m also interested in why players have chosen to go zero-clad. I know the stories behind many of the MLB examples, Teebz has filled me in on the hockey backstories, we all know about Gilbert Arenas, etc. If anyone knows more, I’m all ears.\n\n• Although Benito Santiago never wore 0 or 00, I’m sure someone out there is dying to mention that he famously wore No. 09, because he didn’t like his 9 being bisected by the vertical strap of his chest protector. But here’s what’s never been clear to me: Did he not like the way it looked when the strap went over the 9, or did he not like the way it felt? If anyone knows, do tell.\n\nThat’s enough zero obsession for today. I’ll probably end up shaping all this info into an ESPN column at some point, so any insights or suggestions are welcome.\n\n+ + + + +"
