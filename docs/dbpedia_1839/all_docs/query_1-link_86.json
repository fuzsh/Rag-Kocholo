        "text": "Following Greece’s remarkable triumph at Euro 2004 under his stewardship, Otto Rehhagel has unfortunately come to be labelled as a master of “anti-football” and an exclusive proponent of negative tactics, an unfair assessment of a man who is arguably one of the finest tactical minds of the modern era.\n\nGranted, during his nine-year spell with Greece from 2001 until their exit from the recently concluded 2010 World Cup, the Galanolefki were stylistically founded upon pragmatic principles of defensive solidity, but, as Rehhagel himself said, “We will play exciting football when we have Messi, Kaka, Iniesta and Xavi on the team”.\n\nThe veteran German coach was employed by the Hellenic Football Association to maximise the ability of the players at his disposal, something he emphatically succeeded in doing even if it did result in some observers getting hot under the collar.\n\nBut more on Rehhagel’s international exploits later. If we are to reach an understanding of just how the former Kaiserslautern defender was able to achieve such success with the Greek national side, then that particular period of his career must be placed into context and understood, as it was, as the pinnacle of an ideological approach that Rehhagel had been refining for the best part of thirty years.\n\nAfter a frustrating series of brief and relatively unsuccessful stints in charge of Kickers Offenbach, Werder Bremen, Borussia Dortmund and Arminia Bielefeld throughout the 1970s, Rehhagel eventually began to build his excellent reputation at Fortuna Düsseldorf during the 1979/80 Bundesliga season. In his one and only campaign with the Rheinstadion-based outfit Rehhagel oversaw one of the most successful season in the club’s history, Fortuna winning the German Cup while also managing an eleventh place league finish despite the constraints of a relatively limited squad.\n\nBuilt around the attacking talents of the gifted Allofs brothers, Klaus and Thomas, Rehhagel’s Fortuna side was, in contrast to some of the team’s he came to manage later in his career, a team constructed with a predominantly offensive ethos. Indeed, during the 79/80 domestic season Fortuna had the second worst defensive record in the Bundesliga, their goalscoring ability and attacking endeavour proving a saving grace.\n\nHowever, Rehhagel, possibly frustrated with his team’s apparent defensive ineptitude, left Düsseldorf after the conclusion of the season and returned to Werder Bremen – who had just been relegated from the top flight – where he was to become recognised as one of the finest German coaches of his generation.\n\nDuring his fourteen years with Bremen, Rehhagel transformed the club from a fallen giant into one of Europe’s strongest teams. After guiding his side back into the Bundesliga at the first time of asking, Rehhagel began to develop his philosophy of kontrollierte Offensive, a style of play that favours powerful physical attributes to flair, often featuring two or three centre-halves, a libero, wingers and at least one target man in attack.\n\nIt is certainly not an approach for purists or aesthetes, but Rehhagel has used it to make his teams play to a level above and beyond the sum of their parts for years.\n\nNo better was this ideology demonstrated than with Bremen, as Die Grün-Weißen marched to the league title in 1988 and 1993 and claimed the German Cup in 1991 and 1994 as well as winning the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1992. Combining stifling defence with attractive forward play, Werder, with a wise and experienced squad, had risen to become one of the pre-eminent sporting institutions in Germany and Rehhagel’s impact on German football, whether you deem it a positive or negative influence, was beyond doubt.\n\nAfter some time managing both Bayern Munich and Kaiserslautern during the latter half of the 1990s, Rehhagel was appointed as the head coach of Greece in 2001 and the stage was set for kontrollierte Offensive’s greatest triumph. From the moment he took over the German implemented a strict man-marking system and greater levels of defensive organisation, seeing defence as the best form of attack if Greece were to become capable of matching “bigger” teams on the international stage.\n\nPlayers such as Traianos Dellas, Michalis Kapsis and Theodoros Zagorakis were all groomed to take on weighty defensive responsibilities and, by the time Euro 2004 came around, the Greeks had a side that, although not as talented as many other European teams, was more than able to hold its own even when confronted with the most potent of attacks.\n\nThe Greece of 2004 may now be remembered as a stale and negative unit, but – as Zonal Marking points out – was initially praised for its sleek passing and intelligent movement, the now prevalent incredulity towards the team not being felt until it looked like Rehhagel’s men might actually do the unthinkable and win the tournament.\n\nDuring Greece’s run to the title Rehhagel showed himself to be the brilliant tactical mind that we know him to be, outsmarting the likes of Luiz Felipe Scolari and Jacques Santini as he astutely altered his team’s defensive shape to deal with the various attacking threats posed by the opposition. It may have been reactive football, but it was extremely effective. Again, it wasn’t necessarily pretty to watch, but it was hard not to marvel at the Greek defensive discipline and their efficiency in converting the few attacking set-pieces that they won.\n\nRehhagel’s tactical legacy may not be universally admired, but the German has been one of the most influential men in European football for several decades and was, with Greece, the man behind what was arguably the game’s most incredible achievement. For his contribution to strategic thought and almost unparalleled ability to get the most out of any given group of players, Otto Rehhagel is more than deserving of his place amongst the greatest managers of the last 100 years.\n\nThe final team to be drawn in Group B, Greece enters its first World Cup since 1994 after coming second to Switzerland in a relatively straightforward qualifying pool before going on to beat Ukraine 1-0 on aggregate in one of the UEFA playoff ties. Under their German Coach of nine years, Otto Rehhagel, this is a Greek squad which has enjoyed a degree of stability in recent times and will be looking to rekindle the spirit 0f 2004, the country’s European Championship winning year, as it makes only the second World Cup appearance in its history.\n\nDespite the stereotype of Rehhagel’s Greece as an almost wholly negative side, a team centered around its defence and indulgent in spoiling tactics, this is not a group of players team that can be simply described as subscribing to any one particular tactical system. During qualification for South Africa Rehhagel used no less than five different formations, deploying 4-3-3, 3-4-3, 5-3-2, 4-5-1 and 4-4-2 on various occasions. However, this apparently haphazard approach to strategy is underpinned by the same method which saw Greece spring the biggest surprise of the modern era by winning Euro 2004. Rehhagel is a meticulous tactician, changing his approach for every opponent rather than regularly using the system supposedly best suited to the players at his disposal.\n\nAs the website zonalmarking.net notes, “Greece did brilliantly to adapt their shape to suit opposing formations (in 2004) – the only constant was to make sure they had a spare man at the back”. In that tournament Rehhagel frequently switched between a three and four-man defence, changing his system according to the tactics of his team’s opponents and winning four of six games as he and his players marched to success in Portugal. The German will surely look to pull off a similar conjuring trick in South Africa this summer.\n\nAlthough Rehhagel is something of a tactical chameleon, he did show a slight preference for the 3-4-3 system during qualifying, using the formation (although it’s certainly open to interpretation) in five of Greece’s 10 group games. When using the 3-4-3 Rehhagel has tended to select a back three of Traianos Dellas, Avraam Papadopolous and Sotirios Kyrgiakos, with an experienced midfield unit sitting behind an attacking trio of Georgios Samaras, Theofanis Gekas and Angelos Charisteas, the hero of 2004.\n\nWith a repeat of Greece’s efforts of six years ago being highly unlikely this summer, Rehhagel would probably see qualification from the group as constituting a succesful tournament for his side. However, with a squad lacking out-and-out pace and flair, the Greeks could struggle against their group opponents (Argentina, Nigeria and South Korea), all teams with quick wide players and, arguably, more attacking intent. This is a team with the undoubted capacity to surprise, but perhaps we shouldn’t expect too much from Greece in 2010.\n\nProbable starting XI: Konstantinos Chalkias (PAOK); Traianos Dellas (Anorthosis Famagusta), Avraam Papadopolous (Olympiakos), Sotirios Kyrgiakos (Liverpool); Giorgos Seitaridis (Panathanaikos), Konstantinos Katsouranis (Panathanaikos), Giorgos Karagounis (Panathanaikos), Vasilis Torosidis (Olympiakos); Georgios Samaras (Celtic), Angelos Charisteas (Nuremberg), Theofanis Gekas (Bayer Leverkussen)\n\nThe Road to South Africa:2nd place in UEFA Group 2 – UEFA play-off winners\n\nWorld Ranking: 12th\n\nOdds: 100/1"
