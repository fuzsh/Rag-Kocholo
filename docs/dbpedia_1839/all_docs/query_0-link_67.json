        "text": "If I have one rule in life, it’s that I refuse to lose a derby match against a club called Sweet Milk. That’s right, it turns out we’re not the only team in Sassari. But I’ll get to that in a moment.\n\nThere were heated discussions about our chances this year. Of course there were. There always are. We had just been promoted after completely rebuilding the squad from last year. And we’re amateurs in a semi-professional league. What chances could we possibly have?\n\nWell. We’re not going down. Hell, we might even go up again.\n\nNew to the series? Click here for the prologue and index of chapters\n\nIt’s an incredibly close race at the top of Serie D group G this year. Probably the closest I’ve ever seen any league. With four games left to play, the bookmakers are working overtime to set the odds as seven clubs are within range of finishing first. And even more incredibly: we’re right up there with them.\n\nLast year Latina already had the title in the bag by this point. As do a handful of clubs in the other Serie D groups this year. But not in ours. Serie D, Girone G is home of the most inconsistent top teams of the tier. No team has managed to break away from the rest and Nuorese lead the league with the lowest amount of points in any Serie D group.\n\nAs you may remember, we’ve been playing a 4-3-1-2 formation this season due to… less than great managing in the preseason. Long story short, I failed to notice that we had to field four U20 players in each game and thus we had no decent ones. Also, our wingers quit.\n\nBut it’s worked way better than expected, though for the life of me, I couldn’t explain to you why. I’m not a fan of narrow tactics. But the strik partnership between big guy Gianfranco Botrini and pacey-dribbler Vincenzo Campagnaro has worked wonders. 24 goals between them.\n\nWith four games left to play, the atmosphere in the club is electric. It goes without saying everyone is extremely proud of how we’re doing. Yet if you see me yelling perhaps a bit too harshly at the players for not giving it all at training, let me tell you why.\n\nWe’ve massively over-performed this season. We’re in third place, but we haven’t played well. We had a good October and November, sure. But other than that we’ve failed to get any form of consistency in our results. So I’m keen on not letting the players rest on the laurels.\n\nWe’re heading into the final four games on the back of a two-game win streak. That’s about as good as it’s been this season. But the last win was against Nuorese, the current no. 1 team in our league. We have a fighting chance, and I keep telling the players, unlike Steven Gerrard we will not let it slip.\n\nBut to be honest, the fear of falling short of back-to-back promotions is not the only thing getting on my nerves. Our next game is away against Latte Dolce. They’re in 10th, but we should do alright.\n\nBut that’s when I noticed this.\n\nVanni Sanna is OUR stadium. After all it was named after legendary Torres player Giovanni Sanna. There’s no other stadium with that name. Could it be…\n\nIt could. So it turns out we have a crosstown rival from the Sassari borough of Latte Dolce. Which translates to Sweet Milk. And they play at the Vanni Sanna. OUR VANNI SANNA!! Or at least I think it’s ours. I don’t actually know.\n\nAnyway. As I said in the beginning, if I have one rule in life, it’s that I refuse to lose a derby match against a club called Sweet Milk.\n\nStay tuned for the final four games\n\nLatte Dolce 2 – 3 Torres\n\nA hard fought victory in the Sassari Derby. I sent the players out with a “get stuck in” instruction. Of course I did, they’re called Sweet Milk for God’s sake. How could I not? We went two goals up before the milkmen pulled one back after a poor defensive mistake. Botrini took us to 1-3 before Latte Dolce scored again in overtime.\n\nOn a side note we only had 977 “away” fans at the Vanni Sanna. Which is a few hundred less than what we have when we play our home games at the same stadium. I’m guessing the ultras at the curva nord simply refuse to acknowledge Latte Dolce’s right to play on our pitch and boycott the game.\n\nLeague leaders Nuorese won against second-placed Aprillia. We move up to 2nd place.\n\nTorres 0 – 0 Lupa Roma\n\nA new league record of 1,920 frustrated fans in attendance in a dull game where we just couldn’t find the net. Found plenty of yellow cards, though. Danilo Angelini even found a second and was sent off in the 79th minute. The day turned especially bad for the two lonely spectators in the away-section when Lupa Roma missed a penalty in the 89th minute.\n\nIncredibly Nuorese lost against already relegated Vis Atena. We’re still in second, but only a point behind Nuorese.\n\nLanusei 1 – 2 Torres\n\nPandemonium in the away section in the 49th minute as Javier Martinez scores on direct free kick just outside the penalty box. Top right corner. Goalkeeper never had a chance. Obviously by then the Torres faithful already knew that Nuorese were trailing 0-2 at home against 8th placed Rieti.\n\nBotrini placed a brilliant header in the same top right corner in the 71st minute to take us to 2-0, before Lanusei scored in overtime.\n\nNo more goals at Stadio Franco Frogheri in Nuoro meant we advance to the first place.\n\nTorres 2 – 0 Trastevere\n\nA record 3,714 in attendance as we have the possibility to do the unthinkable and get a second promotion in as many years.\n\nA long ball over the top from our left back Baldassini found Campagnaro with plenty of space. He cooly placed it around the keeper. 1-0 Torres.\n\nTen minutes later a clearance from the Torres defence finds Campagnaro on the wing. He runs half the length of the pitch before getting knocked over in the penaly area. Javier Martinez converts the penalty as the curva nord explodes.\n\nTrastevere misses a penalty in overtime, but it wouldn’t have made any difference anyway. We did it.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThere are a lot of decisions ahead. I was determined to continue in Serie D as amateurs for another season. But we’re playing Serie C next year. That’s a full-time professional league. Do we risk it and continue as amateurs? Or do we go semi or full-time pro?\n\nAlso, I’m determined not to botch the preseason again. This time, I’m reading the rulebook on Serie C before the season starts.\n\nWe’ll need to strengthen the team, no doubt about it. But there’s at least a handful of the current players that should be able to compete in Serie C. Amateurs or not. I’m hoping to get a couple of wingers, so I can get back to playing a wide tactic again.\n\nOh, I almost forgot. This happened:\n\nThanks for reading. I’d love to get feedback from you, so please reach out with questions, comments, suggestions or whatever else you feel like. You can reach me on Twitter at @FM_Ponzie or in my Slack channel #Torres.\n\nGuten tag! Welcome back to Dirk van Oortveld’s quest to take MSV Duisburg into the Bundesliga and get into the upper echelons of European football teams! If you want to catch up on what’s happened previously, check out this link here.\n\nIf you speak German, you’re already aware of what this update is about. We’re taking a look at the youngsters in MSV Duisburg’s first youth intake since van Oortveld’s arrival.\n\nSince this is about the youngsters and a youth intake, I want to take a quick moment to plug Chris Samson’s March 8 article on Five Things to Do When Your Youth Intake Isn’t Great. It’s a brilliant read if you’re like me and your youth intake isn’t great, or you just want a different perspective on how to look at your youth.\n\nWe got in our youth intake in late February, and according to Uwe, this is a golden generation for the club. We’ll see about that. To be fair, my youth intake brought in 14 to 15-year-old kids, and I can’t field U17s in senior matches, so there will be plenty of time to give them development, but the youth intake could certainly be better. Take into account that my goal is to hit the Bundesliga by the end of next season, and they may not see game time with the club, but let’s take a quick look!\n\nAgain, bear in mind that the age of all of these youths is 14, with the odd 15-year-old in there, so they are nowhere near first-team capable, but we’ve got an average youth intake. We have a couple of players who could be the best in the club if they reach their fullest potential, but the quality quickly tapers off.\n\nOne of the better prospects is Tonci Simurina, a 14-year-old German kid. I’ve got him training with Borys Tashchy right now to see if we can get him to see where we can get him in the next couple of years as he grows as a footballer, but right now there’s nothing to look at. He’s special in that he’s got some excellent pace and acceleration, and he’s got leadership potential and determination right out of the gate. If he can prosper with another fairly professional and determined mentor guiding him, I’d like to think he could someday develop into a good player in the lower levels of the Bundesliga or in 2. Bundesliga.We’ll have to give him some training and see where he goes.\n\nCentral defender Fabian Apel received a special note in our news piece, so I want to take a special look at him. He’s got 1 full star for Current Ability relative to the squad, and he can almost max out at 4.5 stars for PA relative to the current squad. He needs a lot of technical development, but he’s ambitious and mentally he’s almost there right now. He’s being a bit on the stubborn side for choosing a good player to be a mentor to him, but I’m optimistic that in the coming years we can find someone who he will gel with and be able to receive training from.\n\nGoalkeeper Jans Benzel is another promising youth player. He’s brave, aggressive, and in excellent physical shape, though he is lacking in some areas, with some glaringly visible low points in his ability. He’s also unambitious, which I hope won’t be a problem down the road. If I am able to do so, I’m going to try and get him training on his game skills with Daniel Davaris, and I’m going to hope that the experience has an impact on his personality later on down the road.\n\nLaurenz Korb is another high-potential player, who’s going to be more comfortable on the left wing as a winger. I’ve opted out of wingers and am relying on wingbacks to charge down the flank, so I’m going to start early and see if he’ll take to receiving wingback training. He’s physically in great shape, except for his strength and balance, and he’s not quite as good mentally or technically as someone I’d want to play in the role, and he’s also unambitious, but we’ve got time to develop him with the right tutor, if one comes up in the next few seasons.\n\nAgain, these kids are all 14-years-old, so I’m not surprised to see that none of them are near ready for competitive football. We’re going to give them an honest amount of attention with the MSV Duisburg youth camp to see what comes of them in the coming seasons, and we’ll evaluate them from there. Right now, the potential is there to be great players relative to the current strength of the squad, but this is a team that just promoted from 3. Bundesliga and that is pushing as hard as it can to make it to the Bundesliga, so they may not be what I need a few years from now. We’ll see…\n\nThis is what our schedule has looked like since January, and these are the remainder of our competitive matches. All-in-all, there’s nothing to complain about. The recent loss was an embarrassing blemish to a good run of form thanks to the manner in which it happened, but we’re doing well to sit in the top half of the table right now, so there’s nothing to be concerned about for the long-term.\n\nAfter 24 games, MSV Duisburg sits in 5th place in the table. Kaiserslautern and Heidenheim are pulling away from the pack right now, and with the remaining fixtures, we can still step into an automatic promotion spot, but right now we’ve only been able to hold consistently 4th to 7th place in the league. While promotion would be fantastic, my goal is to secure this top 5 spot and gather our strength in the off-season to make that final push to promote into the Bundesliga in 2019.\n\nIn the next update, we’ll have the 2017/18 season wrapped up, and we’ll review our final league position and go over our objectives for the team in the off-season.\n\nLots to get through today before we head to Goodison Park later today for an 8pm kick-off.\n\nThe Premier League results saw Arsenal defeat Manchester United at the Emirates, a young man by the name of Alexis Sánchez scoring a goal in the 95th minute after Luke Shaw was sent off on the hour for Mourinho’s side. I don’t know what Arsenal would do without the Chilean. He’s now got 13 goals and 9 assists for the season as the Gunners sit in top spot. Let’s hope for all Arsenal fans they don’t consider selling him.\n\nAt one stage Leicester City looked certainties for relegation but have turned things around to now sit 17th, having defeated Bournemouth this weekend. Manchester City survived a scare to beat Crystal Palace 3 – 2 with all three City goals coming in the last half hour. They’re now 5th in the league under Luis Enrique.\n\nWest Ham United vs. Southampton was a boring 0 – 0 draw but a point apiece does mean that the Saints leapfrog Everton into 11th. In the Saturday late game on BT Sport, Liverpool came away from Wembley with a 1 – 0 win over Tottenham. Liverpool are 2nd behind Arsenal in the table, Tottenham struggling in 6th.\n\nOn Sunday Sean Dyche’s Burnley had the chance to put me in my place after suggesting they would struggle and go down this season, they went away to Brighton and it was a big game for them as I have pointed out, they play three top-six sides in their last six games. They needed a win over Brighton but could only secure a point for a draw.\n\nCongratulations are due to our Under 23 Manager Cameron Toshack, who saw our development side secure a massive 5 – 0 win over Peter Beardsley’s Newcastle Under 23’s in the U23 Premier Division Cup Quarter Final. They go into the semis with potential opponents Bristol City U23, Middlesbrough Under 23 and either Burnley U23 or Norwich U23. Obviously, Cameron Toshack’s men have been taking inspiration from our own FA Cup exploits. I did allow Mael Davies to play but the star performer was Botti Bia Bi, who scored two goals after I identified him as a potential star of the future last week.\n\nOn Friday I talked about our own injury concerns, Everton are similarly under the cosh. Ashley Williams has a twisted ankle, Oumar Niasse has a dislocated shoulder, Nikola Vlasic a pulled groin and Davy Klaasen is suffering from a tight calf. Yannick Bolasie will not be seen in another three-to-six months due to damaged cruciate ligaments.\n\nIn Everton’s last five games, they lost the first three against Liverpool, Leicester and West Brom (an aggregate score of 8 – 1) before overcoming Burnley by one goal to nil thanks to a Leighton Baines penalty and then put Colchester United to the sword in the FA Cup sixth round. It’s worth noting that we do play Everton again in a few weeks to contest the FA Cup semis.\n\nI do feel sorry for Wayne Rooney, his fairy-tale return to Everton has turned sour with only eight starts in the Premier League and five appearances as a substitute. He hasn’t scored a goal or provided an assist in the league, he’s been transfer listed and now finds himself in the Under 23 squad.\n\nI’m not entirely confident in that lineup for Everton, I think Baines will start after his goal against Burnley and Sandro has more often than not been selected as the central striker.\n\nIn terms of our selection, it will be the tried and tested 4-4-2 with Tom Carroll partnering Renato Sanches in central midfield. I did wonder about playing Roque Mesa beside Sanches but I feel Carroll’s presence dropping back to sweep up will be necessary. Ángel Rangel looks fit enough to start only his fourth league game of the season.\n\nJoin us on @TheHigherTempo for live coverage, starting at 7:45pm with the teamsheets and kick off is at 8pm.\n\nClick here to find previous episodes of the Inept International Manager\n\nThese days there are not many things keeping me awake at night but the plight of Louis Henrik is certainly one of them and I write this as he is stood in the background doing that annoying dance that managers do. What is that? Is he digging a hole? Getting down with his bad self? Whatever it is, he needs to stop. A man of his age shouldn’t be straining himself like that.\n\nLouis, like myself, is exasperated. He had planned for a final morale-boosting friendly win over local rivals New Zealand to head into the World Cup but it seems that the scouting department can’t actually put together a report on them. Very little statistical analysis available, apparently. They are on the next island! Ring them! Get a pair of binoculars out! Winston Reid and Chris Wood are Premier League players for crying out loud!\n\nI’m sorry, I’m stalling. I can see how the ‘morale-boosting’ friendly is going and I can tell you that Anthony Hudson, now of Colorado Rapids fame, is a complete and utter bastard. Here are the formations…\n\nHe’s packing out the defence with three and the three central midfielders are dropping back so they’re basically within touching distance. I don’t know what to do for the best and if I don’t know, you can guarantee that Louis Henrik doesn’t either. Good luck Colorado that’s all I can say.\n\nI’ve just noticed that Kosta Barbarouses is playing, he’s at Melbourne Victory. Tell me how again we don’t have a scouting report on them?\n\nI want you to know that the only pleasure I took from this game was New Zealand’s Bill Tuiloma suffering a concussion in a challenge with Kruse.\n\nWinston Reid brought down James Troisi in the box and Troisi, being tried out as a deep-lying forward, rolled up his socks to take the penalty himself and score past Stefan Marinovic in the All Whites’ goal.\n\nIt’s important to try out Troisi in this forward role, he has the movement to make it work and in truth, he’s just not as good as Matthew Leckie on the left or Robbie Kruse on the right but I think he might be at least better than Jamie Maclaren as a forward. Failing that, it’s Tom Rogic and while Louis likes him for his Celtic connection, he fills me with no confidence.\n\nSo the morale-boosting effort ended in a damp squib of a 1 – 0. Despite being a total bellend, maybe Anthony Hudson is onto something? His ploy of filling the middle of the park and dropping deep meant a long, frustrating afternoon. I might have to try that myself when we play Italy in our first World Cup group game.\n\nSpeaking of which, we are boarding the plane to make that fateful journey to Russia. Australia will be using Lada Togliatti’s training facilities during the tournament. They play in the Russian Second Division and have average training facilities. This screams of penny-pinching by FFA who have never liked Louis Henrik from the moment they realised that he wasn’t Luis Enrique and the attractive Spanish receptionist called the wrong manager.\n\nTo his credit though, Louis Henrik rolls up his sleeves and now he comes into his element. He might have worked as a scout for Manchester United but his real passion came out at Kidderminster, Blackpool, Stockport, Squires Gate and Fleetwood (before Jamie Vardy arrived). He looks around and he sees a real ‘muck and nettles’ training ground. He sees headers, tackles, clearances, it’s what football is all about… even at his age.\n\nJoin us next week when the World Cup gets underway and Australia play their first game against the mighty Italians. Wish us luck everybody, we’re going to need it.\n\nYou could say the heat is now on. You could say the temperature has suitably risen. Before the game on Teesside, there were only six points between Nuno and I with eight games left. If he slipped up and I won, it would’ve made it nine and I’ll be damned if I lose three of my last seven. Alternatively, if I was to slip up and Nuno won the gap would be three points which would make things much more interesting as the season draws to a close.\n\nYou can catch all the chapters of this majestic novel here!\n\nWe hadn’t won at Middlesbrough since 1951 going into the game, nonetheless, Nuno has never managed a Wolves side there and neither have I so hopefully something would have to give. You’ll recall last time that I berated my scout for getting the Arsenal formation wrong which effectively cost me the game and he was up to his old tricks again, at least he got the formation right this time, I guess. He just got the personnel wrong…\n\nNuno’s Wolves were faced with a Middlesbrough playing a 4-3-3 formation and Nuno opted to go with the side that has become the norm now. It picked itself especially when you consider that Jota still wasn’t 100% after getting whacked a couple of games ago. This is how Nuno lined up…\n\nWhile Nuno had Tony Pulis in the opposing dugout, I was up against David Moyes and if I’m totally honest, I’m not the biggest fan of either of them. We were controlling the opening exchanges as we forced three corners in as many minutes, we weren’t making them count, though, which is something we would be punished for only moments later when this happened…\n\nAdama Traore was causing Nuno’s side a lot of problems with his pace without doing any real damage, he caused a problem for me as he somehow skinned Vinagre (pace 17) and put the ball on a plate for Assombalonga who was only too happy to oblige by putting the ball in the back of the net.\n\nIt was annoying because we seemed to be getting in the habit of creating chances without taking them and if I was going to beat Nuno, something had to give.\n\nAll The Corners But Not Much Else\n\nWe had yet more corners with no end product and to make things worse Nuno went 1-0 up through Helder Costa who capped off a wonderful flowing move. Five minutes later, Nuno went 2-0 up when Ivan Cavaleiro nodded in at the back post which meant unless I could pull something out of the bag, the gap was going to be cut to three points.\n\nLuckily time was on my side as Cavaleiro got Nuno’s second in the 37th minute, so it wasn’t even halftime yet. A goal before the interval would do nicely!\n\nAye, it would’ve done if it went to me. Marvin Johnson pinged one in from twenty-five yards just before the referee sounded his whistle which ensured I had a mountain to climb. Saying that, we were 4-1 down at Arsenal at halftime and gave them a good run for their money, it was time for me to earn my money as a manager…\n\nFor the second successive game, my wing-backs had been dreadful and due to the fact I changed them over personnel-wise, one is beginning to wonder if it’s actually the system that is the problem. On the other hand, it has worked fine for the rest of season with the exception of the previous two games.\n\nKamikaze Special Incoming\n\nIf I couldn’t pull this back I’d probably go 3-2-3-2 from the beginning, as you can see Gibbs-White, Gomez and Coady came on for Vinagre, Ofosu-Ayeh and Bonatini respectively, if we were gonna go down, we were gonna down kicking and screaming. Neves got sent off for Nuno with fifty-six minutes on the clock for two quick yellow cards, surely they weren’t going to blow it from two goals up?\n\nI had my own troubles to worry about as when the clock hit the hour mark, we hadn’t made much progress, so it was time for a kamikaze special…\n\nThe way I saw it was, I’m quite a bit in front of Nuno goal difference wise so even if ‘Boro score a few more, it’s not going to make that much of a difference in the grand scheme of things and with Nuno down to ten men, if anything was going to happen in that game, it was likely to be for Middlesbrough.\n\nAs the game edged ever closer to the seventy-minute mark, I was beginning to resign myself to defeat, but then…\n\nKamikaze mission was go, go, go! This was followed by Nuno’s second red card of the evening when Matt Doherty got sent off for a second yellow which was a questionable decision, but an understandable one all the same. The annoying thing after that was I couldn’t score for toffee.\n\nGomez missed an easy looking chance but that aside there wasn’t much else going on. Nuno’s side conceded in stoppage time which meant his side won 2-1, no change in my game which meant it finished it like this.\n\nOne stat that immediately jumps out there is that we didn’t create a clear-cut chance despite having nine shots on target which is something that will be rectified on the training ground. So, while Nuno was fist-pumping like a maniac and ‘forgot’ to shake Pulis’ hand, I was left dejected as we sort of finished with a bit of a whimper. Such is the life of a managerial king like myself.\n\nThe only thing that is left to do is to look over the league table between myself and Nuno; it’s getting very close…\n\nTeam\n\nPlayed\n\nGoal Difference\n\nPoints\n\nFM Wolves\n\n39\n\n+47\n\n88\n\nNuno’s Wolves\n\n39\n\n+37\n\n85\n\nI’ll be back next week to preview the Hull game as I look to maintain that gap of three points. Or I might do it in one hit on Wednesday and do the preview and review all in one, could be a good idea. Either way, see you soon.\n\nUntil the next time.\n\nBronze-Wig\n\nMaking a Mountain out of a Mole Hill: Part 9\n\n‘Local craft beer,’ beep, ‘toilet rolls,’ beep, ‘dishwasher tablets,’ beep, ‘and finally some extra-large condoms,’ the shop assistant gave me a speculative look.\n\n‘They make good balloons,’ I shrugged.\n\nHe tallied up the total. ‘That is €15’s please.’\n\n‘Oh, I’m not paying.’\n\n‘Excuse me?’\n\n‘Yeah, this is all free. I’m the Braunschweig manager.’\n\n‘What’s that?’\n\n‘Football, we won the First Division back in May? Hello? Do you live under a rock?’\n\n‘Football is for pansies. I like basketball.’\n\nI screwed up my face in disgust and scooped up my free items, including my condoms, before storming out.\n\nSo, we did it. Last season we won the league. I still can’t quite believe it. This rag-tag, gang of misfits went above and beyond the call of duty and did something historic. I really can’t emphasis what an achievement this is. In the infamous words of Rafa Benitez, “I want to talk about facts”.\n\nThe average wage across my squad was £18k. Our highest earner was Nyman on £32k (this was after signing a new contract midway through the season). The highest transfer fee we paid for a player was Sergi Palencia and that was £5.5m, compared to Bayerns Andrea Belotti at £52m. In fact, Bayern spent £173m on transfers last year and recouped only £5.5m in sales. That’s a net spend of £167.5m. We spent £10.25m all year and recouped £9.5m in sales with a net spend of £750k. Insane.\n\nThe majority of my squad was inherited and much of them are the same squad which battled in the Second Division before I joined. To say I was proud is an overstatement yet I know we still had more in us. The lads had dipped into their reserves but now I wanted them to do more than tea-bag their talent, I wanted full penetration. As well as we played last year I know we could do better.\n\nWith those words in my mind I proceeded into this season. As newly crowned champions it means we’ll have Champions League football to contend with and I needed to sit down and review the squad. What areas could we improve? What position needed an upgrade?\n\nTransfers:\n\nIn:\n\nRodri Tarin, CB – Free – He played for me during my time at Barca. He’s a talented individual and I expect him to slot straight into the starting 11.\n\nBorja San Emerterio, RB – £575k – Backup option, with bags of potential. I’ve been keen to sign him for two seasons now and finally managed to convince him to join.\n\nAaron, LB – £1.8m – Couldn’t get game time at Bayern and so left for peanuts. This kid is potentially our best defender and may be the real deal.\n\nMarko Grujic, CM – £5m – I snagged Marko on loan when I first arrived here. I tried to sign him last season but as mentioned previously he opted for Porto, despite them offering less wages as he wanted to play Champions League football. With that sort of attitude I couldn’t not go back for him after he failed to settle there.\n\nTOTAL: £7,375,000\n\nAll players improve the team/squad massively.\n\nOut:\n\nMike-Steven Dismer, CB – £4m\n\nAlmsick, RW – £300k\n\nTOTAL: £4.3m\n\nI was sad to wave Dismer off but I couldn’t convince him to stay as a squad player so fuck him.\n\nSeason\n\nPre-season:\n\nFC Dordrecht, 2-0\n\nVVV, 4-1\n\nFC Oss, 12-0\n\nOlympiakos, 4-0\n\nAntalyaspor, 2-1\n\nFive games, 22 goals scored and only 2 conceded. To say I felt confident for the upcoming season is an understatement. The lads look fit, the squad looks strong and I couldn’t wait to get started.\n\nThe club set me the target of finishing in the top 7 and playing in the Champions League Group stages. As we have already qualified for the Group Stages by finishing as champions it was pretty easy to please them in that department. The weird bastards. Realistically though I’d be happy with a top 3 finish and to reach the knockout stages of the Champions League. That for me would be progress, as last year we pretty much only had the league to contend in and this season we’ll be playing double the games.\n\nAugust:\n\nSat in front of my TV at home, I watched as some old bastard fondled a load of balls and started picking them out of a glass bowl with the hunger of a fat kid lining up a chocolate cake. ‘Braunschweig’ he announced. My arse clenched. Here it is, Group D. Who would we get? Hopefully a piss easy group. Please be easy. Please be easy. ‘Atletico Madrid’, ‘Roma’, ‘Galatasaray’. Jesus Christ. We’d only gotten drawn into the group of death. Welcome to ‘European Football Braunschweig,’ the old twat grinned. If I was there I’d have attacked the prick.\n\nSo the clubs continual overhaul is still progressing alongside of the squad. The new stadiums construction is now underway and has a timescale of 2 years before completion; we have a new affiliate club in Munchen Lions who ply their trade in the German Second Division, and our own youth recruitment has been improved, the future of the club is looking bright. Along with all the boardroom level stuff we’ve also seen a small amount of internal staff changes too, with further improvements in coaching standards being made all the while. My former assistant’s contract ran out in the summer and instead of renewing I’ve decided to move in a different direction. By different I mean better. I was over the moon to welcome Javi Calleja in as my assistant. He’d only recently left his managerial role at Villarreal after two seasons a few months prior so I was somewhat surprised he wanted to be my second in command. But I guess he wants to learn from the best… er hem. Anyway… It must also be noted that Javi is 5’5. He’s fucking tiny.\n\nCUPS:\n\nSuper Cup – RBL, 0-2 – Disappointing this. Our first competitive game, a good shot at silverware and we lost. The lads received a right arse lashing after the game.\n\nGerman Cup 1st Round – Bischofswerda, 7-0 – That’s more like it. Nyman bagged a hat trick, Wilson grabbed a goal, as did fellow striker Daka and Rabello, our CB decided to go mad and score twice from two separate corner set-pieces.\n\nFirst Division:\n\nHertha, 4-0 – Opening game of the season with a comprehensive victory\n\nA good way to start the league. A strong home performance to set the tone.\n\nSeptember:\n\n‘Right lads, as you may well know, we are the champions now, people are gunna want to get up in our faces, take pictures, instagram you, ask you for a threesome with their wives, but I want you to put that all aside and try and remember the fundamentals. Which are…’ I put my bottle of dandruff free shampoo down and squinted into the mirror trying to think. ‘Which are…’\n\nMainz, 3-5 – Five twats that’ll probably never score again this season beat our keeper.\n\nChamps League – Galatasaray, 3-0 – A comprehensive victory in our first European game in living memory.\n\nStuttgart, 3-3 – A point away to potentially a tough team.\n\nHoffenheim, 3-1 – Back to winning ways in the league.\n\nWolfsburg, 1-2 – Or not. Another loss, we’re hit and miss on the road again this season so far.\n\nChamps League – Atletico Madrid, 2-6 – Griezmann proving why he’s one of the best with four goals. The worst thing about this result was a former loanee Bentancur scoring against us. He celebrated as if he’d just lost his virginity too the smelly twat.\n\nA bit of a hit and miss month, with too many losses and dropped points for my liking. I’m putting it down to the extra games and learning to rotate the team better. I must improve and so must the players.\n\nOctober:\n\n‘How are you settling in Javi?’ Javi shrugged. ‘Fine,’ he replied in Spanish. My face tweaked and I couldn’t fight back my smirk any longer. ‘Argh, come here, mate,’ I grabbed hold of him and gave the little bastard a cuddle, his face squeezed precariously against my rib cage. ‘I can’t look at you without thinking of Frodo Baggins.’\n\nDortmund, 3-0 – Very pleased with this. We have a very good record against Dortmund. We’ve beat them 3 times, drew once and lost only once.\n\nSchalke, 2-1\n\nChamps League – Roma, 4-1 – Another massive victory in Europe against a big name.\n\nBremen, 2-0\n\nGerman Cup 2nd Round – Freiburg, 5-3\n\nFreiburg, 3-0\n\nThat’s better, much better. A massive win against Roma in the Champions League which puts us in a much better position in the group. Also a massive win against Dortmund, who also seem to have started slow. We’ve also progressed in the German Cup.\n\nNovember:\n\n‘How would you rate the season so far?’ The journalist was a little piggy-faced man with a hairline running away quicker than a Russian Athlete from a dope-testing examiner.\n\n‘We could do better. We know this, if we have to compete we have to win matches, or if not win, don’t lose.’\n\n‘Would you say you may be a one-season wonder?’\n\n‘Would you say you are a one-thrust wonder?’ I said, my temper boiling over far too quickly. ‘Listen, it’s far too early in the season to project anything, Bayern are currently 8 points behind us, but do you think they’ll be finishing outside the top 3 places? No. So do us all a favour and accept you’re going bald. For fuck sake.’\n\nChamps League – Roma, 3-3\n\nRBL, 2-0 – massive this, RBL look a real threat this season.\n\nBielefeld, 1-1\n\nChamps League – Galatasaray, 5-4 – Galatasaray have been the drubbing team in the group.\n\nHannover, 2-0\n\nSee, we’re slowly turning them losses into draws and the difference it makes is palpable. We’ve slowly risen up the table and are sitting on top of the pile after the last two months good form. We need to try and cement ourselves here now.\n\nDecember:\n\n‘So what are your plans for Christmas Javi?’\n\n‘I guess I’ll go home to Spain and–’\n\n‘Are you getting a Christmas tree this year?’\n\n‘Well yes of course,’ he said, bemused. ‘Why?’\n\n‘Because you’re so small you could be the angel on top of your own tree,’ I sniggered. Javi stared at me like I was a badly behaved ten-year old. ‘You’re practically a dwarf.’\n\nHamburg, 2-1\n\nKoln, 4-0\n\nChamps League – Athletico Madrid, 1-2 – They’ve beat us 8-3 on aggregate, a different class these.\n\nLeverkusen, 2-2\n\nBayern, 1-1\n\nAugsburg, 1-1\n\nGerman Cup 3rd Round – Leverkusen, 4-1\n\nA bit of a slow month in terms of results, but you can never scoff at a draw with Bayern, Augsburg are flying this season and are currently 4th in the league and Leverkusen is Leverkusen and they are always a challenge. It does mean the trailing pack have made ground though, but its peaks and troughs at this stage.\n\nSo, we head into the winter break now. The good news is we’re still top of the table, albeit by a single point, as Dortmund and RBL are trailing us in smoking hot pursuit. We have also progressed into the knockout stages of the Champions League in second spot on 10 points. I’m really happy with that, a massive moment for the club in what was a horrific group to fight our way out of. We have also progressed to the Quarter-finals of the German Cup having beaten Leverkusen to get there. All in all we look in pretty good shape at the moment. Most of the team have managed to keep fit and that has been key to us fighting on all fronts.\n\nThis season was always about the cups for me, I’d love to win the league again but our mixed December might mean we’ve opened the door for one of the others. I would love to win a cup though, I’d like to have a real go in the Champions League but if Atletico Madrid have taught us anything it’s that the elite teams still may be another level to us.\n\nPlayer of the Episode:\n\nChristoffer Nyman. He’s been in unreal form. I can’t quite believe no one has lodged a bid for him in all my time at the club. The man is prolific for me. In this campaign so far he has scored 25 goals in all competitions and it’s only midway through the season.\n\nSo, can we make it two years on the bounce? Will be crowned champions of Europe? There’s only one way to find out. Waiting extremely patiently until this time next week.\n\nThat’s all for now folks.\n\nAuf Wiedersehen."
