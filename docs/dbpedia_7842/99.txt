History

Nardin Academy was founded by the Society of the Daughters of the Heart of Mary over 160 years ago. Ernestine Nardin began the first Catholic school in Buffalo on Pearl Street before relocating to Franklin and Church Streets as St. Mary's Academy. It wasn't until 1890 that Miss Nardin moved the school to its current location on Cleveland Avenue. The school was named "The Nardin Academy" in 1917 and was changed in 1951 to the current "Nardin Academy."

Irene Murphy, DHM started Buffalo's first Montessori with the opening of Nardin Montessori in 1963. It was moved to the former John R. Oishei Estate on West Ferry upon its purchase (and Varue Oishei's generous donation) in 1996. It was finally opened to students in 1998.

Its campus is a contributing property in the Elmwood Historic Districtâ€“East historic district.

Admission

In order to attend the high school, one must first take an entrance exam. The exam, held in November, lasts about three and one half hours and covers a variety of topics, including Logic, English and Math. A written application process along with short essay questions accompanies the exam. Most prospective students shadow a freshman girl during the selection process or after admission. If a girl is selected, she is sent a letter of acceptance in January.
