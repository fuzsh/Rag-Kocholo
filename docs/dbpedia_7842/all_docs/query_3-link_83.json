        "text": "Students at Nardin Academy are back inside the classroom Monday after recent changes to the state's COVID-19 regulations.\n\nSchools in red and orange zones now have an option to return students to the classroom as long as strict testing protocols are followed.\n\nFor schools in the Erie County orange zone, 20% of all in-person students, faculty, and staff need to be tested during the course of a month. If nine or more tests come back positive, the school will switch to remote learning.\n\nNardin Academy began testing students Saturday to meet the state's guidelines.\n\nFamily volunteers and health care professionals were at the school's gym and wellness center, which was transformed into a COVID-19 testing site.\n\nSchools in the orange zone that return to in-person classes also need to follow guidelines like wearing masks and completing a daily survey."
