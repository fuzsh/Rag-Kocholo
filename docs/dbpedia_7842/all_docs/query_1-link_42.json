As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\n\nAfter serving as an English teacher for second through 10th grade students for many years, Mrs. Braungart decided to pursue higher education. Due to her natural inclination toward technology, she earned a Master of Science in educational technology and digital media from Canisius College in 2018.
