        "text": "ECMCC Announces 9th Annual Summer Youth Intern Program\n\nHospital program continues to stand as the only such program in the region\n\nThe Erie County Medical Center Corporation’s (ECMCC) 9th Annual Summer Youth Intern Program today held an orientation for 125 high school students who will participate in a four-week comprehensive self-development program for area high school students administered by the ECMC Foundation. Fifty percent of the participating students come from Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown’s Summer Youth Employment and Internship Program.\n\nBuffalo Mayor Byron Brown said, “My annual summer youth employment and internship program has put thousands of young people from neighborhoods all throughout our city to work and this opportunity at ECMC will provide these high school students with real-life health care workplace experience, where they’ll see firsthand the demands of a critically important work environment that has such an important impact on the lives of citizens. I am very appreciative and thankful that ECMC partnered with my Administration on this very worthy summer youth employment initiative, providing valuable work experience that will lead our children to realize a brighter future.”\n\nECMCC President and CEO Thomas J. Quatroche, Jr., Ph.D. said, “Healthcare is a growing industry in Western New York, and ECMC is proud to play our part to educate our youth and provide opportunities to serve the patients of our community. These students are brought into the daily workings of ECMC and are provided an in-depth understanding of how our hospital functions and cares for the patients we serve. Thanks to the strong support of Mayor Brown and the ECMC Foundation, this an excellent opportunity for the students to become better acquainted with the important role hospitals play in serving our community.”\n\nThe program offers summer interns a hospital-based career exploration to stimulate interest in employment in health services and to help meet the future need for qualified personnel in this field. They are required to work two (2) six-hour days for a total of 12 hours per week, which includes a hospital-based career exploration program; a heart health education program, an accident prevention course and/or a CPR certification course.\n\nThe criteria in which interns are selected to be in the ECMC Summer Youth Intern Program include: an 80% overall GPA; two letters of recommendation from their school; 14 – 17 years of age; attendance of 10th, 11th or 12th grade in the Fall of 2016, medical assessments, working papers, parent permission and a successful completion of a personal interview. ECMC’s Summer Youth Intern Program is a two-year program, where participants, if they maintain the required academic GPA, can return the following summer for the second year of the summer internship.\n\nThis summer, participating high schools include: Alden; Amherst Central; Buffalo Academy for the Visual and Performing Arts; Buffalo Academy of Science; Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart; Bishop Timon St. Jude; Canisius; Cardinal O’Hara; Charter School of Applied Tech; Cheektowaga Central; City Honors; Clarence; Cleveland Hill; Depew; East Aurora; Global Concepts Charter; Grand Island; Hamburg; Health Science Charter; Hutchinson Central Technical; Kenmore West; Lakeshore Central; Lancaster; Leonardo DaVinci; Maryvale; McKinley; Mt.

The Mayor’s Administration is committed to preparing city youth for the jobs of the future and the Summer Youth Employment and Internship program helps ensure the success of the next generation by encouraging young people to start their career path with a summer job. Since 2006, the summer youth employment program has provided over 22,000 employment opportunities to city youth. This year, the city added funding to create 50 additional positions, increasing the city’s summer youth workforce to 1,500.”"
