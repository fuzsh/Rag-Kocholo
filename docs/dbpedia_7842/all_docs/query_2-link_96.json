        "text": "WHAT: Sixty-seven students from nine public and private high schools across Western New York have spent the last three months learning about robot-assisted surgery at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center using the same curriculum that is used to train surgeons from around the world. The final round of the Greater Buffalo Junior Robotic Surgeon Challenge will see the top two competitors going head-to-head using the da Vinci Surgical System in a Roswell Park operating room. The two students will perform an actual robot-assisted surgery on a synthetic bladder while the audience watches a telecast. Roswell Park surgeons will rate the finalists’ performance to decide the winner.\n\nThe program was designed by Khurshid Guru, MD, Director of the Roswell Park Center for Robotic Surgery, and Eileen O’Brien, PhD, STEM Coordinator for Immaculate Conception School, and organized by Erinn Field, program coordinator for Roswell Park’s Applied Technology Laboratory for Advanced Surgery.\n\nThe event is open to media and invited guests.\n\nWHEN: Saturday, April 26, 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; awards presentation 12:30 p.m.\n\nWHERE: Hohn Auditorium — Research Studies Center, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm & Carlton Sts., Buffalo"
