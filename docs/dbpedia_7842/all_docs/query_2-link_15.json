        "text": "Over 90 percent of American Catholic schools use some sort of 3rd party accreditation to prove to themselves and their stakeholders that they are excellent schools committed to ongoing improvement. The Diocese of Buffalo is the only diocese in New York state which does not require its elementary schools to engage in accreditation efforts. As we face enrollment decline, financial challenges, and questions of education quality & value, it’s time to change this.\n\nOriginally, we thought the Assembly's push for “substantial equivalency” would require this. While it’s true that accreditation would provide a pathway, our schools are taking state tests and STAR tests which qualify as appropriate pathways for substantial equivalency.\n\nThe reality is that we need to prove to our internal and external stakeholders that our schools are excellent. With the parish reorganizations taking place as part of the Road to Renewal, accreditation will bolster our argument for resources. Schools often ask how the department is responding to the Road to Renewal. This is strategy #1.\n\nThe second argument for accreditation is the shifting landscape of our schools. The challenges of enrollment, staff salaries, and balancing budgets alone necessitate a focus on sound business practices. We have found in the strategic planning process a need for focus in these areas as well as Catholic identity and academic excellence. Accreditation provides an ongoing process whereby best practices are studied and supported.\n\nAccreditation is a marathon which happens every seven years. But like a marathon, the true value comes in the preparation. If you’ve ever done a marathon, you know that 90% of the joy comes from making it to the starting line of the race. You’ve made it through the training, you’re in shape and injury free, and the race is the cherry on top. By preparing for an accreditation visit, our schools will be 90% there.\n\nAfter investigating multiple agencies, we have selected Middle States (MSA) for our accreditation partner. The question before us is whether we will engage in system accreditation or individual school accreditation. A quick pro/con:\n\nSchool Based Accreditation\n\nNeed for school based coordinator (teacher on special assignment)\n\nGoal setting, surveys, curation of evidence falls on school team alone\n\nVisit includes 6 team members in your school for three days. Arranging and paying for this visit is the school’s sole responsibility\n\nThe three days include classroom observations, interviews with parents, teachers, students, board as well as a deep dive into facilities, medical files, paperwork etc. This will be a very thorough look at your school.\n\nWith all schools adopting this, there will be a need for visitors from each school to participate in other school visits. This will mean a commitment of your teachers over many years.\n\nSystem Accreditation:\n\nCoordinated by the Diocese, the self-study will be a collaborative effort. Thus the amount of work for each school will be reduced\n\nCollaboration and goal setting based on strategic planning. There would be 4-6 Diocesan-wide goals (i.e. “math”) with each school charged with making it come alive in its context.\n\nDiocesan support with facilitating surveys, evidence, and crunching data\n\nVisit includes 12 people from outside the Diocese for three days visiting every school. Approximately 3 hours in each building. The visit will be thus be shorter for each school and less thorough\n\nDiocese will pay for the Accreditation team visit\n\nAnnual dues are lower (approximately $325 per school annually as opposed to $650 for school-based)\n\nDiocese of Buffalo Catholic schools will be required to be accredited by Middle States. The question before us is the process/protocol we’ll use–either system or school accreditation. I’ve created this Google Form to provide a forum for questions to be addressed. Please feel free to drop in and ask anything!\n\nOur hope is that we can begin the self-study process this fall and work toward a visit (or visits) in the fall of 2025 at the earliest. Our hope is that the process will result in stronger schools getting better every year.\n\nPrevious blogs can be found here. Want to keep up with the conversations surrounding Catholic education?
