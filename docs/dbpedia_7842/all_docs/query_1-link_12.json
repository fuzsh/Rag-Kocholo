The work of advancing diversity, equity and inclusion is about how every person is seen, valued, and treated with dignity. It is how we honor our shared humanity.\n\nWe must not only define these words, we must also be vigilant in our commitment to build and sustain a community that embraces it. Nardin is one of those communities.\n\nOver the past year we have accomplished a lot. And we are just getting started,yet recognize there is still much to do.
