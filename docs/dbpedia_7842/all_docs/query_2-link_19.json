        "text": "EDUCATION COLLABORATIVE OF WESTERN NEW YORK: A CONSORTIUM OF BUFFALO PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\nThe Education Collaborative of Western New York (EdCo / EdCo WNY) is a select consortium of independent schools located around the city of Buffalo in western New York state. Its membership is comprised of a number of leading private schools in the region who collaborate with one another on common academic and administrative initiatives.\n\nABOUT\n\nThe Education Collaborative of Western New York consortium was first assembled in 1999 and, at its peak, boasted 16 member schools with contribution from academics at the University at Buffalo. The organisation was established to foster collaboration and cooperation between its member schools and to provide a platform for sharing ideas and experiences in order to better improve the independent education offer in the Buffalo region.\n\nEDCO WNY also acts as a representative voice for its member schools, advocating on behalf of independent schools in Western New York state and, more widely, for the private education sector. The association regularly convenes training events, admissions and careers fairs for its members, boosting their marketing potential and proving that combining resources allows their efforts as a whole to be greater than the sum of their parts. Furthermore, the Education Collaborative of Western New York is a first port of call for parents and families that are seeking alternative and private education in the area.\n\nThe consortium’s members regularly meet to share best practice approaches on matters of administration and strategy and, moreover, to boost educational outcomes for their respective students and to demonstrate how EDCO schools can be pivotal in unlocking a pupil’s potential and future success. In recent years the organisation and its members have made significant efforts to increase diversity in admissions and faculty recruitment to ensure that their schools better reflect the communities which they serve. In this respect, the secretariat works with the John R. Oishei Foundation to manage the Oishei High School Scholarship which seeks to support outstanding students of colour attaining places at EDCO WNY member schools.\n\nThe member schools are all fully accredited independent schools, most being registered with the Middle States Association. Some are also accredited with the New York State Association of Independent Schools (of which EDCO WNY is also a member) and the National Association of Independent Schools. Some of the schools offer single-sex and/or faith-based educational environments. Boarding options are also available amongst the EDCO WNY membership. All of the member schools offer a college-preparatory high school programme, with some offering education from earlier ages (including pre-school).\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about the Education Collaborative of Western New York, please contact the organisation directly using the details provided below or get in touch with one of the member schools as listed here.\n\nWe welcome any unique insights that students, staff, alumni or family of any of these schools might share with our readers, particularly any thoughts that may be helpful to prospective applicants in the Buffalo area. Please feel free to share your comments with us below.\n\nMEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES\n\nCHOOSE LIST VIEW FOR A SIMPLE LIST OF ALL LISTED SCHOOLS.
