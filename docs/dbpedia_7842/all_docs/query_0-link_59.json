        "text": "Freeman shows how focused and clear the \"L\" consonant needs to be if the rhythm is to be truly precise.\n\n“I learned new techniques and new ways to improve my sound just from doing a little movement while singing.” Javone Sease, Senior\n\n“I very much enjoyed the master class. Dr. Freeman’s enthusiasm and ability to direct us effectively made me realize some of the areas we could do better in. From now on I will pay more attention to dynamics and enunciation.” Gabby Bruscia, Senior\n\n“It was remarkable how simply changing how you stand or sit can impact the energy with which you sing.” Mary Wilson, Junior\n\nKarl Jenkins wrote The Armed Man, A Mass for Peace in 2002, in memory of the victims of Kosovo. However, the work transcends that specific time in recent history. Like Brahms, he looks backwards in time and to other cultures for inspiration. Not only does he rely on the structure of the ages-old Catholic Mass to frame his message, but he incorporates Medieval music and texts, Renaissance-style counterpoint, text from ancient India, a poem born of the bombing of Hiroshima, and even the Muslim call to prayer. It's a work that has rhythmic immediacy and vivid dramatic impact.\n\nThere are movements in \"The Armed Man\" that are somewhat repetitive. Yet, if you listen carefully, you realize there is something different in each repetition. Each one is building toward something, or adding something, or doing something different each time. I didn't realize this learning my part alone. It was when all the singers came together that I got that \"Ah-ha!\" moment. Definitely goosebump time. It's so simple, and yet brilliant at the same time.\" - Steve Bench, BPC Bass\n\n\"The Jenkins is a piece that yanks you all over the range of human emotion - as does war itself. As a singer, I admire the mystery and rhythmic excitement.\" - Brad Felton, BPC Bass and Board Member\n\nKarl Jenkins\n\nOne of the most startling movements is called \"Torches\". It uses ancient text found in Sanskrit epics detailing the horrors of the Kurukshetra War. The chorus sings the text in a declamatory style, so that every word and gruesome image is clearly audible. In the first rehearsal of this, the chorus was speechless at the end of this movement. Jenkins, however, follows this horror with a prayer asking for forgiveness. The musical line descends as if the entire chorus and orchestra is genuflecting in humble prayer.\n\n“I can’t sing Torches without crying. There is a line, ‘some hugged their sons, others their fathers and mothers, unable to let them go;’ as a mother this drives home for me how those affected by war and unable to do anything to stop those horrors must feel. To be able to express this and a full range of emotions about war and peace is a privilege.” - Jennifer Davies, Soprano and BPC Board Member\n\n\"I have never sung anything like Torches, Its eerie harmony and shrieking dissonance perfectly expresses the holocaust described in the Mahabharata. One can feel the catastrophic pain when listening to it, but the dark scene turns beautiful with the serene Agnus Dei that follows.\" - James Bobak, BPC Bass and Composition Student at UB.\n\n\"The Jenkins work didn't appeal to me at first due to its many dissonances and repetitious, almost power-hungry insistence of rhythm. It's theme of war is unsettling on so many levels. As long as I held it at arms' length and thought of it as being about other people, other cities, other nations, it didn't affect me very much at all. But then I decided to let it in, and realized that it's about me...all of us. If we're not part of the solution, we're part of the problem. One of the most poignant moments for me-after the utter shock of \"Torches\"-- is the contour of the melody in the \"Agnus Dei\", almost like falling into the arms of the Redeemer. At the end of struggle and horror there is the hope of something better. But we have to choose it.\" - Melissa Herr, BPC Alto and soloist for the April 11 performance.\n\nBarker Central Student Reflections\n\nPerforming with the Buffalo Philharmonic was a once in a lifetime opportunity. There are many people who don’t get the chance to do a performance like this, and we did while we are still in high school. Working with the BPC was special because even just tips from Dr. Freeman have helped shape us as musicians. Lastly I would like to thank everyone involved in the BPC, Dr. Freeman and Mr. Burke for making this experience possible, and enjoyable.\n\nBen Schian, grade 11, male\n\nThe BPO and choir performance was a fantastic experience. Singing usually feels good, but that day it was glorious. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Dr. Freeman was very knowledgeable and fun to work with.\n\nMorgan Fay, grade 12, male\n\nSinging with the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus was an amazing experience. It was an honor to sing with so many talented people. I would gladly go and sing with them again. I am so grateful that I got the chance to sing with them while I’m in high school. It was truly a once in a lifetime chance.\n\nKatie Przybyl, grade 11, female\n\nBarker Central Concert Choir posing for a picture with BPC Music Director Erin Freeman before the BPO's Holiday Pops.\n\nThe Barker Concert Choir is the premiere vocal ensemble at Barker Central School. The northeastern most school in Niagara County, BCS has a student body of fewer than one thousand enrolled in K-12. Throughout the last 20 years numerous conductors have led the group, currently under the direction of Mr. Drew Burke. Over the last few years the choir has much to be proud of. The group has nearly doubled in size, and more than quadrupled the number of males involved. In addition to school events, the group performs each year at a Veteran's Day banquet, and has in the past performed in a fashion show to raise money for breast cancer research and at the Medina Railroad Museum’s annual Polar Express event. While budget cuts have affected schools across New York State, the Barker Concert Choir has continued to not only maintain a tradition of excellence, but exceed expectations and intends to do so for years to come\n\nDrew Burke is the director of choral activities for grades 5-12 at Barker Central School. A local of Niagara County, Drew is in his fourth year at Barker where he conducts five vocal ensembles and will serve this year as director of the school musical. A 2008 graduate from Houghton College with a BMus in music education in 2008 and a MMus in voice performance from the University of Buffalo in 2010, Drew has accomplished much in a short time. In addition to teaching, Drew is a member of vocal group Vox Lumine, the Somerset Barbershop Quartet, the rock group “Time Travelers” and has performed with numerous local theatre companies. In 2013, Drew was selected to conduct the Niagara County Jr. High All-County Chorus and co-directs the choir at St. George's Antiochian Orthodox Church in Niagara Falls."
