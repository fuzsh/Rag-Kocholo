        "text": "Since 1963, Nardin Montessori has guided students to develop their individual talents and cultivate their intellect, character, and courage to make a difference in the world.\n\nFounded on the belief that children learn best in an environment that supports and respects their unique development, Nardin Montessori students are instructed and encouraged by an expert faculty of Montessori certified teachers. Our carefully curated classrooms and deliberately designed materials create a unique space in which students have the opportunity to engage in learning, exploration, experimentation, and discovery. The program works to foster respect for others, independent learning, and an appreciation of nature; our students' experiences are complemented by our West Ferry campus' park-like setting, with beautiful gardens and play areas for them to enjoy.\n\nThe Montessori Elementary curriculum is characterized by individualized instruction, small group lessons, and long periods of uninterrupted work time. In addition to expanded academic subjects, including public speaking and performance, students' educational experiences are enhanced by shopping trips to the Lexington Co-Op for cooking class ingredients, multiple field trips to cultural institutions, rollerblading in the Fall, and ice skating in the Winter.\n\nThe Toddler and Early Childhood programs are nestled in a stately home on West Ferry while the Montessori Elementary classroom is housed on the Cleveland Avenue campus.\n\nThe creation of a strong community is the basis for establishing life-long connections; a solid relationship between the school and the family is imperative to each child's success. At the West Ferry campus, we host family meet and greets, parent breakfasts, an Easter Egg hunt, Grandparent's Day, among many other opportunities throughout the year. In addition, parents are able to witness their children's educational growth: parents are invited individually for guided classroom observations, parent/faculty conferences are held twice a year for each students, and the Elementary students present their Night of Research and Discovery in May; open communication between faculty and families is an active and ongoing practice of the Montessori program.\n\nWe invite you to come and discover for yourselves the amazing things that are occurring in our Montessori classrooms."
