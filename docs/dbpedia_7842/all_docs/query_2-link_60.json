        "text": "Cardinal O’Hara High School has created a life skills program for high school aged students with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities and is looking to spread the word to recruit for this program. The program will feature a 12:1:1 ratio, all related services, a certified special ed teacher, unified sports and unified chorus, and socialization as part of a comprehensive coed Catholic high school.\n\nWe should all celebrate this innovation and spread the word so O’Hara can build this program. This is a unique opportunity to increase inclusion in Catholic education. As the word spreads that all students are welcome, more doors should open for all of our Catholic schools.\n\nHere is the announcement that you can share with your community. There might be friends or relatives of your school families that might be interested in this program so your help in spreading the word is appreciated. Kudos to Cardinal O’Hara!\n\nCatholic Schools Week is right around the corner. This year, the Catholic Education Luncheon is taking place on Thursday, January 26th before the week itself. I hope you’re planning to attend to show our appreciation to the Foundation for its support of Catholic schools as well as helping to honor our Distinguished Principal, Karen Rahill, Distinguished Pastor, Fr. Jim Ciupek, and the Making a Difference Award winner, Vicky Petricca. Bishop Fisher is going to kick off the week with Mass on Sunday at a parish, Nativity of Our Lord. We will travel to OLV for Mass on Monday morning along with a visit to Notre Dame Academy. Tuesday’s travels will include Mass at St. John Vianney and a visit to Mt. Mercy HS. Wednesday will include visits to Catholic Academy of West Buffalo and St. Joseph University. On Thursday, we’ll travel to St. Stephen’s for Mass and a tour. When the week is complete, Bishop Fisher will have traveled to all Diocesan elementary and Catholic high schools in his first two years.\n\nMost of our schools are conducting their school spelling bees in preparation for the Diocesan Spelling Bee on Monday, January 30th. The end of Catholic Schools Week (Saturday, Feb 4th) is the Diocesan Chess Tournament. There is still room for more schools to send chess competitors. When we add the Diocesan 7th & 8th grade dance on February 11th, it becomes clear that we are opening up more opportunities for students to compete and enjoy their Catholic schools.\n\nOur Value Proposition to parents must include a community and activities-rich environment where students can come alive. It must also include reassurances that we’re offering a top-quality education. To that end, we’ll be discussing accreditation options this Thursday at the Principal’s meeting. Like the STAR test, we need to give parents concrete data that our schools are excellent and providing an excellent opportunity for their children.\n\nPrevious blogs can be found here.

Please take a moment to complete this google form to recognize one student from your school who best demonstrates appreciation.\n\nJanuary Value\n\nThe road to accomplishing good things is often a challenging one. Those who choose to face that challenge to reach success have a key characteristic we all need- determination. Determination may appear on the basketball court, while completing a science experiment, or when tackling a difficult word in a text. How can you help your students strengthen their determination? Consider trying the following:\n\nPraise effort more than accomplishments: Children want to continue actions that are positively reinforced. If they are praised during the process of accomplishing something, they will learn the benefit of hard work, effort, and practice, not just the outcome.\n\nGive specific praise: Avoid “good job” or “good try”; instead, be specific. “You worked so hard to learn your multiplication facts. Practicing with flashcards every night was a great tool.”\n\nDon’t underestimate your students: Let them have a chance to accomplish something, even if it takes them a bit longer, especially when trying something new. Avoid taking over and doing it for them.\n\nLet them fail: Let your students make mistakes. After they have, talk to them about it. Praise their effort and discuss what they could do differently next time.\n\nTalk about things you work hard at: Share a time when you had to exercise determination to accomplish something. Modeling mistakes made, problem solving, and outcomes achieved. This can help fuel your students’ thought processes when faced with a new challenge.\n\nResources for Teachers\n\nWhat is Determination: Short Film\n\nI Won’t Give up by Daniel Kenney\n\nDetermination Short\n\nKeep on Trying Jack Hartmann\n\nRead Alouds:\n\nIzzy Gizmo by Pip Jones\n\nEmmanuel’s Dream by Laurie Ann Thompson\n\nAfter the Fall by Dan Santat\n\nRosie Revere, Engineer by Andrea Beaty\n\nToday I Will Fly!

Tickets are $5 and the dress code is semi-formal. A follow up email including ticket information and a flyer to share with your school community will be sent via email to principals tomorrow. We kindly ask that each school provides at least one chaperone for the evening of the dance.\n\nSTREAM Updates\n\nThe Anchor Church Project final video submissions are due by midnight on Friday 13th January. Please submit your video to churchproject@wnycatholicschools.org All videos and other supporting materials will be posted on the Anchor Church Website. Results will be announced during Catholic Schools Week.\n\nComputer Based Testing Resources\n\nThis year our schools are transitioning to computer based testing. The New York State Assessment website has a plethora of resources to support your teachers and students as you make this transition. I’ve included some key resources below.\n\nGetting Started Tips\n\nNextera Setup and Installation Guide\n\nBest Practices: Computer-Based Testing “Tech Tips”\n\nCreating a Secure Computer-Based Testing Environment\n\n2022 Teacher’s Directions Sample\n\nTesting Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Manual\n\nNew York State Question Sampler- This site allows teachers and students to see sample questions in math, ELA, and science. You can select a specific subject, grade level, and choose from five question samples. Once a sample is selected the system will walk participants through the set up of the testing platform, and tools that are included before allowing students to complete the sample questions.\n\nLogging Into ELA Practice Tests\n\nLogging Into Math Practice Tests\n\nLogging Into Science Practice Tests\n\nEquation Editor Drawing Tool\n\nPrevious \"Academic Corner\" posts from Kari\n\n1/14/23 Deadline to Apply for Free UB Graduate Courses Starting 1/30/23\n\n2/6/23 Last Day to Submit Buffalo Public Schools Textbook Requisitions\n\n2/20/23 HS Scholarships for Academic Excellence (SAE) Nominations Due\n\n3/17/23 Last Day to Submit Erie 1 BOCES Textbook Requisitions\n\n3/24/23 Save Mandated Services Claim online for C. Riso Review\n\n3/31/23 NYSED Nonpublic Safety Equipment (NPSE) Claims Due\n\n3/31/23 NYSED Elementary School AIS Claims Due\n\n4/1/23 Online 2021-22 Mandated Services Claim Due to NYSED\n\nMandated Services – Online System Still Not Open: The online system is still not open for 2021-22 Mandated Services claims but there is a chance that it will open soon. I will notify you as soon as I am given a better idea of when it should open for new 2021-22 claims. In the meantime, I would be happy to look over your Excel spreadsheet if you have completed it. My biggest concerns are the salaries, benefits, and number of student attendance days you are claiming and how you arrived at those numbers because NYSED has been demanding proof of how you arrived at those numbers during audits (official payroll and benefits reports). If you want me to look your spreadsheet over, please also share the school calendar E-School/Student Management System report you used to calculate the number of student days, being sure to remove any snow days; I can also look over your payroll and benefits reports if you are not sure what amounts to claim. Please email me if you would like my assistance with this process or to request a review. If your spreadsheet looks good and matches your supporting documentation, you can use this information to complete “Form 2” to prepare for your online submission.\n\nChange to NYS Job Posting Requirements: The Diocese of Buffalo HR Department reminded me that Governor Kathy Hochul signed a NYS pay transparency bill into law on December 21, 2022. Beginning in September 2023, it will be mandatory to include a salary amount or range for all jobs postings. Please see below:\n\n“Similar to other pay transparency laws, Labor Law § 194-b requires employers to disclose an amount or a range of compensation for any open job, promotion or transfer opportunity that can or will be performed, at least in part, in New York State. The law defines “range of compensation” as “the minimum and maximum annual salary or hourly range of compensation . . . that the employer in good faith believes to be accurate at the time of the posting of an advertisement” for the job, promotion or transfer opportunity. Advertisements for jobs, promotions or transfer opportunities that are paid solely on commission must disclose that in writing. Additionally, the law requires employers to post a job description if one exists.”\n\nIt has been a popular option to put “commensurate upon experience/education” for the salary information, but that will no longer be allowed. Any posting that does not have salary information on September 16, 2023 will be removed from Diocesan and Department websites as the law goes into effect September 17, 2023. The Diocesan HR Department advises all of us that it would be best to get in the habit of providing this information now for all job postings.\n\nTextbook Orders: Buffalo Public Requisitions Due 2/6; Erie 1 BOCES Orders due 3/17 -\n\nErie 1 BOCES has asked that all textbook funds be used by 3/17/23. Please check to see if any funds remain and then place orders by 3/17/23. Also, please remember that the Buffalo Public Schools will only make requisitions for requests received through 2/6/23. Please make sure you use up all available BPS textbook, computer hardware, computer software, and library funds by that date.\n\n10-Year Elementary Enrollment Report Available to Principals upon Request: Our Department created a 10-Year Elementary Enrollment Report which shows total elementary enrollment for the Diocese, broken down by grade and separated into boys and girls. If any Diocese of Buffalo Elementary School Principal is interested in seeing this report, please email Laurie Wojtaszczyk at LWojtaszczyk@buffalodiocese.org.\n\nGraduate Courses available for Free through University at Buffalo (UB) and SUNY Empire: As an eligible nonpublic school teacher or leader, you can take select online courses through UB’s Graduate programs for free.\n\nUniversity at Buffalo Professional Development for Religious and Independent School Teachers\n\nAvailable online courses for Spring 2022 - University at Buffalo\n\nOnline application deadline for University at Buffalo Spring 2023 courses is January 14, 2023 (classes begin 1/30/2023) - click here to apply\n\nUniversity at Buffalo Academic Calendars (link is external)\n\nQuestions?
