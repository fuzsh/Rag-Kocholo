        "text": "As a freshman last season, I was blessed to play varsity softball for our State Championship in New York City. Although our team did not win, I learned that I am capable of playing at a high level of competition. As a fourteen year old, I found myself playing with and against much older, stronger, faster and bigger players. I remember thinking \"I should be intimidated by this\", but I wasn't. It was an opportunity to learn, compete and test myself against the best in the area. I learned to push my limits and used every ounce of all of my many years of practice. I was very proud of what I accomplished.\n\nThrough softball, I have found confidence, focus, discipline and work ethic. More importantly, I found family. I fell in love with the game because of the person I am allowed to become when I step on the field. For a few hours, I am a leader, competitor, friend and teammate.\n\nI experienced my fair share of setbacks over the past eleven years too. Three years ago I tore my ACL and broke my Tibial Spine while skiing. It was a very long recovery, that involved physical therapy almost daily for eight months. All while attending school, soccer and softball practice. I never missed a game or practice. I had a new position on the team now. I may not have been able to play but I was still able to be a leader, student, friend, and a teammate. I learned the game from a new position. I took notes, watched, learned, cheered and hit endless buckets of balls while seated on a bucket. The injury was a blessing. Therapy taught me hard work, perseverance and how to take care of my body properly. Remaining with my teams every step of the way taught me that the leader off the field is as important as the one on the field.\n\nAfter eleven years of playing this game, I am never bored. There is so much more for me to learn from this game. My goal for myself as a player, is to meet new people to play with and be coached by. I have so many goals in life and playing college ball is just one of them. I know the friendships, coaching and lessons learned will give me the skills and confidence to reach all of my life goals."
