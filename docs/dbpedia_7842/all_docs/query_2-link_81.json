        "text": "Cyber engineering workshop to be held\n\nLocal female high school students entering grades 10-12 will take part next month in a Cyber Engineering Workshop for Young Women to explore all the opportunities that the world of engineering has to offer.\n\nThe workshop, to be held Aug. 15-19, is run by the New York State Center for Engineering Design and Industrial Innovation (NYSCEDII), part of the UB School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.\n\nThe workshop will introduce the engineering-design process to students, who will gain hands-on experience using engineering tools and a better understanding of the wide array of job opportunities in the field of engineering.\n\nStudents come from 12 different high schools: Akron, Barker, Clarence, Holy Angels Academy, Lake Shore, Mt. Mercy, Mt. St. Mary, Nardin Academy, Orchard Park, Starpoint, Tapestry Charter and Williamsville North.\n\n“Our focus is on educating the young women about the options that exist in the different fields of engineering, while at the same time providing engaging experiences that demonstrate how engineering can be an exciting field,” says workshop director Ken English, deputy director of NYSCEDII and an adjunct assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering.\n\nThis year’s workshop will focus on transportation simulation and is funded in part by grants from the University Transportation Research Center - Region 2, Fisher-Price, Moog and Praxair. Students will work with simulations of the traffic on UB’s North Campus, and also will use NYSCEDII’s driving simulator to run vehicle dynamics experiments to explore how a car interacts with the road.\n\nThe driving simulator consists of a “car” mounted on a six-degree-of-freedom motion base that realistically simulates the sensations of turning, braking and traveling uphill or downhill. The cabin is outfitted with high-performance simulation controls, such as a steering wheel, accelerator, brake and clutch pedals, all of which combine to make the experience extremely authentic. While the platform is moving, four 10-by-8-foot display screens surround the car, simulating the world that the drivers are experiencing."
