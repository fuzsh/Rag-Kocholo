        "text": "Nardin Academy Elementary and High School:\n\nWe, the alumni of Nardin Academy, demand that our alma mater directly addresses and creates institutional change in regards to its deeply rooted issues of racism and discrimination. The alumni who sign this petition support the “Nardin: It’s Time We Talk About Racism” petition drafted by current Nardin high school students.\n\nWe demand that the administration and the Nardin community properly address all grievances and actions highlighted in the petition about the lack of accountability and safeguards in place to protect marginalized students, specifically Black students, students of color, LGBTQIA+ students, low-income students, and students of other faiths.\n\nWe are outraged by the lack of foresight used by the Nardin administration. Nardin sent out emails asking for donations to their Annual 24 Hour Alumni Challenge before showing solidarity with the Black Lives Matter Movement and acknowledging the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd. The only acknowledgement of the most recent Black lives lost by police killings was stating their “solidarity with those who experience racial injustice” in a two sentence statement on various social media platforms. After receiving dozens of emails and phone calls from Nardin community members calling out the administration’s insensitivity to the current issues of racial injustice, the administration postponed the fundraiser.\n\nWe acknowledge that Nardin Academy has upheld an oppressive and racist culture rooted in white supremacy that has alienated, ignored, harassed, and bullied students and alumni who are from marginalized communities. For years, students have been reporting these issues to staff and administration without an official reporting system to hold the assailant accountable. We firmly stand in support of students of color who have been and continue to be victimized by Nardin’s hostile environment. We acknowledge the years of pain and struggle that many of us have gone through while receiving an education at this institution; more importantly, we acknowledge our complacency and participation in these injustices.\n\nNardin Academy claims to be a premier, private Catholic school; however, the Nardin administration fails to follow the way of Jesus Christ, who uplifts and fights tirelessly for those who are oppressed.\n\nWe, the alumni of Nardin Academy, vow to withhold all future financial contributions to Nardin until:\n\n1. The Nardin administration creates tangible plans of action in collaboration with current and former students to address all demands from the “Nardin: It’s Time We Talk About Racism” petition;\n\n2. The Nardin administration publicly releases pre-approved plans of action with timelines to address systemic oppression at Nardin Academy;\n\n3. All plans of action must involve the input of and approval by student-leaders of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Rainbow Heritage Club, Black Student Union, Challenging Injustice in Society, families of these students, and all involved faculty;\n\n4. The Nardin administration publicly acknowledges the ways it has perpetuated systemic racism and apologizes for its lack of response to current students, faculty, and families;\n\n5. The Nardin administration publicly apologizes to the entire Nardin community for failing to properly acknowledge their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter Movement;\n\n6. The Nardin administration publicly apologizes to the entire Nardin community for their careless handling of the Annual 24 Hour Alumni Fundraiser; and\n\n7. The Nardin administration commits to donating all proceeds from the next Annual 24 Hour Alumni Fundraiser to Black Lives Matter Movement fundraisers chosen by current students who wrote the petition.\n\nThese demands go beyond ego, prestige, and tradition. This is about acknowledging the humanity of the students of color who walk the halls of Nardin Academy each day. As Nardin alumni, we were taught to value character, excellence, humanity, and “be someone who champions equity and justice.”\n\nIt is time that the Administration values the same."
