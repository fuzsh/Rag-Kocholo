        "text": "I have had the immense privilege of graduating from all three Nardin Academy schools. I am a proud alum of the Montessori, Lower School, and High School. Throughout my youth, I was aware of what a tremendous gift it was to attend a safe and welcoming school. It wasn't until my adult years where I began to realize how beneficial my education was to how I walk through life today. My biggest takeaway from Nardin are the relationships I have formed. I am still friends with people who I have gone to school with since Montessori. In addition, the teachers are the foundation of the school. Nardin is filled with individuals who truly want the best for their students. I'm very grateful for all the opportunities and the community Nardin has provided me.\n\nI have had an incredible experience at Nardin Academy. My freshmen year, I was a little disappointed when there were restrictions, due to Covid, on the fun activities and sports that I was looking forward to being apart of. After a year of feeling uncomfortably isolated, I wasn't sure that Nardin was the place for me; however, my sophomore year made me feel as though I made the right decision. House competitions, clubs, and many other incredible privileges Nardin invites us to involve ourselves in had returned. I felt a new sense of belonging, and each year I continued at Nardin I felt a stronger sense of community. I am incredibly grateful that I have been able to be a part of the Nardin community, not only for the fun, but also the rigorous academics. If I had not attended Nardin, I don't believe I would have been pushed to enroll in AP and Honors level courses. My teachers and counselors at Nardin pushed me to become the best student I could be.\n\nI was a student at Nardin from 7th grade (2016) to my senior year of High School (2022). I can confidently say that from an academic standpoint, Nardin is great, but I struggled socially. They were not a very diverse school and the lack of students and faculty of color had a deep negative effect on my mental health. I always felt ostracized, criticized, and misunderstood. The students were quite racist and some of the teachers were as well. I had a lack of support from the staff. Being a Catholic school, I expected more religion to be taught. I was highly disappointed in that. I enjoyed the activities they offered- very school spirit oriented. I have to say that Nardin taught me a lot. As a recent graduate, I find myself reflecting upon not only myself but the world around me. I ask myself; Am I embodying the characteristics of a Nardin student? What would Jesus do? What good have I done for the world today? If Nardin gave me anything, it gave me pride and a unique outlook on life.\n\nOne word can describe my high school experience at Nardin Academy; an Adventure. It had it’s ups and downs, but overall it got the job done of preparing me for the next step in my journey as a student. Nardin is a private, Catholic, all girls, predominately all-white school, and I was just transferring in to 9th grade from a charter school. Right of the bat I had my concerns and worries with a change in curriculum, pace, and academic regulations in this new environment. I was also starting with a clean slate with my social life, so making friends was a challenging category to complete. Overtime I did get the hang of things, and I did make some decent friends. However, one thing I would change is an increase and acknowledgment of diversity. Nardin just lost their diversity and equity counselors of 2 years. She was someone every black student went to for problems involving Nardin, racial slurs being a big one. I just worry for up coming high schoolers who are minorities.\n\nAs far as academics, Nardin was a great choice. I took 9 APs during my four years, and got a lot of experience with difficult work loads and well rounded classes. For some context, I’m going into STEM (bio chem) and I was the top of my class. I found the academic challenge overwhelming at times, but it pushed me as a student. I was close with a handful of my teachers, and they genuinely changed my life, and for that I am very grateful.\n\nHowever, the reason I only gave three stars is Nardin’s diversity is abysmal. I am a queer person of color, and while I would not be the majority anywhere, Nardin is overwhelmingly white and Catholic. As such, their views are outdated and often simply wrong. My friend group (3 of us) were all POC and we experienced similar struggles. There was some progress this year as a DEI faculty position and DEI committee of students and staff was active throughout the year.\n\nAll in all, Nardin was complicated, and difficult, but I am glad it was my high school.\n\nI loved the academics at Nardin as well as the teachers. I disliked the lack of inclusion and the heavy favoring of students who played in sports over those who participated in the arts. I disliked the lack of inclusion of LGBTQ+ members in the Nardin community as well as the lack of education on issues going on in the world. We often were told not to talk about current events in class in order to stop discussions and possible arguments from arising.\n\nNardin is a great private school that offers so many opportunities for their students. The teachers actually want to see they’re students succeed and are always willing to talk with the kids if there is an issue! The small class sizes allow for teachers to truly connect with the kids and the one on one treatment with teachers is great. Also, the school does focus on the children’s well being outside of the classroom, such as mental health and over all happiness! Mental health is extremely important to look after especially with young teenage girls and Nardin does a great job with handling it ! I could never imagine myself somewhere besides Nardin.\n\nDefinitely overrated. An average school but the same academics and experience can be found at public high schools like clarence and orchard park. The science department is extremely lacking. No ap physics course and teachers being replaced every year. Principal also constantly changing. Not much of a stable environment, as even scheduling has changed multiple times in my time there. Dress codes change every year and often students have to keep re purchasing skirts they deem “appropriate” for the next year. Food is probably the best plus of the school. Teachers are nothing to brag about, I honestly had a better experience with the ones from public school. Barely any diversity at the school and have heard of many students of color being bullied and treated differently by teachers. To end on a good note, our musical productions are very nice every year, yet the students involved are yet to receive a proper space to practice."
