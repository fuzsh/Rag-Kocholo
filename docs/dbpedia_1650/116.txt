Eleventh Hour

Adapted from British television, this CBS series features the investigations of Dr. Jacob Hood (Rufus Sewell) and his FBI handler, Rachel Young (Marley Shelton). Their mission: to head off “abuses of science”. The show is well funded, well written, superbly acted and backed by super producer Jerry Bruckheimer, on a major network. So why am I worried? Because it’s very, very similar to several other genre shows that cross science fiction with procedurals: The X-Files, Chuck, and Fringe come to mind.

Cancelled due to low ratings, May 2009. This series never did rise above the pack; it had great potential but nothing special in the way of storylines.
