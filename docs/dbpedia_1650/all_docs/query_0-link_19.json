        "text": "The Eleventh Hour was about psychiatry, both as it helped individuals deal with their problems and as it helped law enforcement agencies. The first season focused on psychiatrists Theodore Bassett and Paul Graham as they worked with people. The show's title related to \"patients who came to them 'in the eleventh hour' — on the verge of breakdown\".[2] In addition to Bassett's clinical practice, he advised the police department and the state's department of correction. Many episodes had him evaluating people charged with crimes with regard to their mental competency.[2]\n\nIn the second season, Bassett was replaced by L. Richard Starke, and he and Graham became more directly involved in cases.[2]\n\nWendell Corey as Dr. Theodore Bassett (season 1)\n\nRalph Bellamy as Dr. L. Richard Starke (season 2)\n\nJack Ging as Dr. Paul Graham\n\nSeason 1 (1962–63)\n\nMore information No. overall, No. in season ...\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air dateProd.\n\ncode11\"Ann Costigan: A Duel on a Field of White\"Fielder CookHarry Julian FinkOctober 3, 1962 ( )6701 22\"There Are Dragons in This Forest\"Boris SagalTheodore ApsteinOctober 10, 1962 ( )6715 33\"Make Me a Place\"Paul WendkosHarry Fink & S.S.
