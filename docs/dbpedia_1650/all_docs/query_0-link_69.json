        "text": "Sony Pictures Television has acquired a minority stake in Eleventh Hour Films, the U.K.-based indie behind the long-running period detective series Foyle’s War on ITV, plus BBC drama series New Blood, Vexed and, most recently, ITV’s Safe House.\n\nAs part of the deal, Sony will distribute EHF’s new content internationally. Financial details weren’t disclosed.\n\n“We are thrilled to be deepening our relationship with the passionate and visionary women of EHF, who are among the sharpest and most motivated producers we’ve met,” said Wayne Garvie, Sony Pictures TV’s president of international production. “We look forward to seeing their strong roster of projects develop further and helping them achieve their future vision for the business.”\n\nThe news follows the recent green-light announcement of the eight-episode adaptation of Anthony Horowitz’s best-selling teen spy novel series, Alex Rider, being produced by EHF and the first deal of its kind with SPT’s international distribution and production units collaborating to fully fund the series.\n\nEleventh Hour — led by the senior management team of Jill Green, Eve Gutierrez, Paula Cuddy and Nicole Finnan — are also in partnership on other projects, including an eight-part Anglo/American paranormal drama series Rendlesham, inspired by real-life events in the 1980s, and drama The Caine Mutiny, an eight-part event serial adapted by Horowitz from the Pulitzer Prize novel by Herman Wouk.\n\n“This is an exciting and natural extension of our already strong relationship with Wayne and his team,” said EHF md Finnan. “It will help fulfill EHF’s ambition for our content to have a truly global reach and adds greater strategic muscle worldwide.”"
