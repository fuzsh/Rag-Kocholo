        "text": "Eleventh Hour Films has announced Victoria Asare-Archer is adapting its new limited series ‘The House Hunt’, based on the novel by C.M. Ewan (‘The Interview’; ‘A Window Breaks’).\n\nThe Sony Pictures Television-backed EHF announced in August 2023 that it had optioned the novel.\n\nAsare-Archer is a London-born writer of Ghanaian heritage, and in 2020, she was included on the Radio Times list of the top 100 voices in TV. In addition to adapting ‘The House Hunt’, she is currently lead writing and executive producing the Harlan Coben adaptation ‘Missing You’ currently filming for Netflix. She previously wrote two episodes of ‘Stay Close’ for Red Production Company and Netflix and wrote the Emmy-nominated virtual reality game ‘Doctor Who: The Runaway’, and has written multiple episodes for the BBC and Netflix.\n\nVictoria Asare-Archer, says “All my years of Rightmove stalking have finally paid off! It’s a dream to be able to combine my love of property porn and tense domestic thrillers in one gripping series. Chris has written the most engrossing book about one young couple’s property nightmare. It’s an honour to have been asked to turn a bestselling book into a must-watch TV series.”\n\nPaula Cuddy, Creative Director at EHF says, “Victoria is the dream writer to adapt and deliver for screen the story of Lucy and Sam whose world is turned upside down when they put their house up for sale. Brilliant characters, jaw-dropping twists, turns and reveals. It’ll be a rollercoaster ride for the audience – we’re so excited to be on board with Victoria at the wheel.”\n\nC.M. Ewan’s ‘The House Hunt’ centres on the story of a young couple, Lucy and Sam who have put their recently renovated dream house up for sale, to clear their debts – and are under pressure to sell the house.\n\nWhen the estate agent tells Lucy she has the ‘dream buyer’ who wants to view today Lucy is reluctant, she has been clear that she doesn’t want to take any viewings alone and when Sam is at work. The estate agent reassuringly promises she’ll be there as soon as she can. Lucy agrees, feeling she has no choice as she knows they need to urgently sell.\n\nAs Lucy she begins the viewing something about the man feels wrong and as time passes with no sign of the estate agent Lucy’s unease grows. On the verge of panic Lucy asks the man to leave, but he refuses and turns on her, revealing something inconceivable – and as events spiral beyond Lucy’s control she fears for her own safety, as well as Sam’s, who is due home from work any moment.\n\nPaula Cuddy, Eve Gutierrez and Jill Green from Eleventh Hour Films will serve as Executive Producers on the adaptation alongside Victoria Asare-Archer and C.M. Ewan.\n\nJon Creamer\n\nShare this story"
