Some critics are likening the pilot to The X-Files.\n\nProduced by: Jerry Bruckheimer. The series is a joint venture between Jerry Bruckheimer Television, Granada Television and Warner Bros.

But i enjoyed the US version nevertheless. 8/10\n\nLast edited: Oct 11, 2008\n\nGoldenArms\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 30, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n193\n\nReaction score\n\n9\n\nPoints\n\n71\n\nLocation\n\nWashington, DC\n\nOct 19, 2008\n\n#6\n\nthought the premiere was quite solid and they definitely built on it in the second episode...the twist at the end completely fooled my fiancee...and shes usually pretty good at figuring thigns about before they happen...\n\nDVD-Man\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nJul 24, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n8,390\n\nReaction score\n\n1,824\n\nPoints\n\n1,581\n\nLocation\n\nAyrshire, Scotland\n\nApr 14, 2009\n\n#7\n\nSeen this advertised on Living so decided to check it out, 3 eps in it's a sort of Fringe clone without the comedy, not much chemistry going on between the two leads but we'll see if they get better.\n\nLiam"
