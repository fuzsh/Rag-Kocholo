        "text": "Well, where to start? New Doctor, new companion, new TARDIS, new theme tune and that's not even mentioning all the changes behind the scenes. It's pretty remarkable then that, with little continuity to work with beyond a man in a big blue box, \"The Eleventh Hour\" slipped so naturally into the Doctor Who canon. What's more, Stephen Moffat's inaugural outing as head writer was effortlessly effervescent, with Russell T. Davies' bold, brash Who making way for much darker fantasy fare and a genuinely magical sense of wonder and whimsy that's been missing from the show in recent years.\n\nFor that, we can largely thank Matt Smith's Doctor, who's infectious awkwardness and childlike exuberance had us from the get-go. If there was ever any worry that this relative newcomer might struggle to fill the sizable boots left by David Tennant, it quickly dissipated with Smith's confident, spritely and surprisingly subtle portrayal of the centuries-old Time Lord. Indeed, by the time things are wrapped up 65 minutes later, he owned the show. Tennant who?\n\nMeanwhile, Karen Gillan's beautiful, feisty Amy Pond slipped equally snugly into the vacant companion role. Introduced through a clever plot device which squeezed 12 years of back-story into 20 minutes of screen time, we first meet Amy as a young girl, all wide-eyed innocence, as the Doctor's malfunctioning TARDIS tumbles back in time, crash landing in the garden of her eerie country cottage.\n\nWith typically creepy Moffat touches hitting early on in the shape of a mysterious crack in the wall and something sinister lurking just out of view, it's classic behind-the-sofa stuff. Yet, there are poignant moments too as young Amy waits in vain for the Doctor's return. More so when, 12 years later, we meet the wary, cynical grown-up Amy, we're instantly given more insight into a companion character than we've ever had before.\n\nWith menace-of-the-week revealed to be the escaped shape-shifting Prisoner Zero, having slipped through the crack in time and space in Amy's wall, it's fair to say that the extraterrestrial calamity plot is the weakest link in an otherwise superb opening episode. With Prisoner Zero on the loose and captors the Atraxi poised to obliterate the Earth should their charge not be returned immediately, a whole bunch of disparate elements -- from coma patients, mobile phones and computer viruses -- hurtle in and out of the picture, never really gelling into a satisfying whole.\n\nNo, it certainly isn't perfect, with a saggy midsection and slightly naff CGI effects baring the brunt of any remaining criticism. Where things win out, though, is in the little details, with a pace and lightness of touch that positively crackle with infectious energy, thanks to countless classic Moffat one-liners (\"You're Scottish, fry something\") and a tone that fulfills all the promise of a dark fairytale -- particularly evident in the show's simply gorgeous Burton-esque cinematography and a genuinely excellent score from series' stalwart Murray Gold. \"The Eleventh Hour\" also finds time to sow the seeds for this season's intriguing story arc and offers an assured introduction to Amy's band of supporting characters, including Annette Crosbie's Mrs. Angelo, Arthur Darvill's Rory and Tom Hopper's Jeff.\n\nSure, its 65 minute run-time felt more of an extravagance than a necessity, but \"The Eleventh Hour\" is wondrous in so many ways. As the Doctor takes to the rooftops in the closing minutes against Gold's euphoric staccato score, stepping through a bubble of Time Lords past to caution the Atraxi, \"Basicallyâ€¦ run\", it's proper goose bump stuff. It's magical TV, the kind that makes you feel eight years old again and, ending with a season preview to end all previews, it looks like there's plenty more where that came from."
