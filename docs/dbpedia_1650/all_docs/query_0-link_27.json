        "text": "Sony Pictures Television (SPT) has increased its investment in Eleventh Hour Films to take a majority stake in the Magpie Murders and Alex Rider indie.\n\nEleventh Hour Films’ Magpie Murders, Moonflower Murders and the Alex Rider series were all adaptations of novels by Anthony Horowitz and are the result of an ongoing collaboration between the company and the award-winning novelist and screenwriter, which also includes the upcoming original mystery thriller Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue for MGM+ and the BBC.\n\nJill Green, who founded the company in 2010, will move from her role as CEO to provide strategic support to the management team and to exec produce on a number of bespoke dramas, including leading on those written by Horowitz, while remaining as chairperson. Eve Gutierrez and Paula Cuddy will now lead Eleventh Hour Films through its next phase of growth as co-CEOs. Sarah Woolway is joining the senior team in the newly created role of chief commercial officer.\n\nThe investment will see Eleventh Hour Films become the fourth majority-owned, U.K.-based scripted drama company in the SPT International Production group, alongside Left Bank Pictures, Bad Wolf and Eleven.\n\n“Over the past decade, Jill, Eve and Paula have built a remarkable company, and it has been a great joy for everyone at Sony to have been part of their adventure,” said Wayne Garvie, president of international production at Sony Pictures Television. “Starting with Alex Rider and right through to Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue, we’ve witnessed first-hand their ability for consistently delivering high-quality, commercial event television with global appeal. We are overjoyed that they are becoming a full member of our roster of world-leading drama labels. Their development pipeline suggests that the next few years are going to be even more remarkable, and Sony Pictures Television will be a proud partner.”\n\nGreen said: “Eve, Paula and I have been a tight team working together on an amazing EHF journey. Now with the full support of Sony Pictures Television and a strong senior team restructure, I have every confidence that an equally brilliant future lies ahead.”\n\nGutierrez and Cuddy added: “Together with Jill we have developed and produced a raft of shows we are incredibly proud of with brilliant writers and production teams. As co-CEOs we are delighted to now lead the company onwards into its next exciting chapter, remaining true to Jill’s founding principle of always striving to find ways to bring great stories to screen—on schedule and on budget!”"
