        "text": "Rufus Sewell may be best known for portraying aristocratic hotheads in movies like A Knight's Tale and The Illusionist, but the British actor sounds like he's happy to trade villainous intensity for a new role as a crime-fighting man of science.\n\nIn \"Eleventh Hour,\" which premieres Thursday on CBS, Sewell plays it cool as biophysicist Jacob Hood. The show is yet another British miniseries retooled for an American audience: Jerry Bruckheimer's U.S. version of Eleventh Hour casts Sewell as a special consultant to the FBI who helps agent Rachel Young (Marley Shelton) solve crimes involving cloning, cryogenics and other strange cases based on actual science.\n\nDespite a surface resemblance to \"The X-Files\" and \"Fringe,\" the first two episodes of \"Eleventh Hour\" stick to the Bruckheimer/CSI formula: For better and for worse, it's about the cases, not the characters.\n\nDuring a break in shooting earlier this month on the \"Eleventh Hour\" sound stage in Burbank, California, Sewell talked to Wired.com about trading in his bad guy roles to get inside the head of a brilliant scientist.\n\nWired.com: You have a thriving career on stage and film. What attracted you to doing this TV series?\n\nRufus Sewell: Because of a couple things I've done in the past, people tend to see me as this upper-class villain on a horse, blah blah blah. The opportunity to show people I could play a basically good guy, quite complex, American, not on a horse -- even if that becomes a stereotype that I'm stuck with for a while, there's so much more play than the other stereotype I was in danger of being caught up with.\n\nWired.com: The performance in \"Eleventh Hour\" seems kind of reined in, compared to other things you've done.\n\nSewell: You mean The Illusionist? where I'm playing a deranged psychopath who kills himself?\n\nWired.com: But you did it so effectively.\n\nSewell: That's not because I prefer a deranged style of acting. It's because I was playing a deranged person. It's all about the requirements of the role and that's one reason I wanted to play this part in \"Eleventh Hour.\" I bet a lot of people will be surprised but hopefully after they watch a few episodes, it'll be new typecasting for me.\n\nWired.com: Now that you've been working on \"Eleventh Hour\" for a few weeks, do you find science more interesting than before?\n\nSewell: Absolutely. In school, I was in the park with a bottle of cider for science (class), so this is all relatively new. Now I'm actually paying attention and, slowly, I'm beginning to learn. Jacob Hood is so much brighter than me but what I can bring to the role is my own enthusiasm. I think, increment by increment point, I'm probably going to gain about two IQ points a season (laughs). If only for that reason, I hope the show goes for a while.\n\nWired.com: Did you have any real people in mind in putting together your approach to play Jacob Hood?\n\nSewell: My way into this role is that even though he knows a lot, there is a kind of humility to him and a slightly scruffy way to the way he thinks. The great minds that I've had the privilege of working with sort of proffer these pieces of genius as if it were a humble suggestion, some silly thing that you're welcome to use if you like. Tom Stoppard is one of the great intellects who also has a certain humility. People walk away from a conversation with him feeling that they've been rather clever.\n\nWired.com: Explaining the science in a TV drama can be kind of tricky.\n\nSewell: My horror, my negative idea of what this (character) could be would be some kind of boring brain box person you sit next to on a Greyhound Bus and they ask, \"Are you interested in biology?\" and you say, \"Oh, for Christ's sake\" -- this kind of proper, unsolicited factoid -- I can't imagine anyone would want to watch that.\n\nWired.com: So instead of that ...\n\nSewell: Someone who might make you think, \"God, if I'd had a teacher like that I might have been interested in chemistry,\" somebody who shows you how the things around you are actually made in such a way that it ignites your interest, who doesn't make science seem like it's a million miles away but something you can actually understand. I'm not saying I'm achieving that but that's my ideal.\n\n- - -\n\nEleventh Hour premieres Thursday at 10 p.m. EST on CBS.\n\nI pretty much love him. I was rooting for him in Tristan + Isolde.\n\nsource"
