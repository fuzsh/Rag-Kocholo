        "text": "Paramount+ has greenlit new drama series The Killing Kind (6×60”).\n\nThe series, produced by Eleventh Hour Films, will begin filming in the UK early next year.\n\nThe Killing Kind is based on Jane Casey’s best-selling book of the same name. “Nobody understands the dark gap between justice and the law better than Ingrid Lewis. As a successful barrister, Ingrid is used to dealing with tricky clients, but no-one rivals John Webster – charming, good-looking, successful and clever. Webster was accused of coercive control by an ex-girlfriend and in court Ingrid successfully defended him, winning the case. Following the trial, Ingrid got close to Webster, too close and when she tried to exit the relationship, he turned on her and her world imploded. Now, just when she is rebuilding her life he suddenly reappears and tells her that someone is out to kill her and only he can protect her. Fuelled by a need to find out the truth and locked in a game of ‘cat and mouse’ Ingrid must decide if Webster is Friend or Foe, Murderer or Protector, Stalker or Saviour. Can Ingrid discover the truth before it is too late?”\n\nThe series was commissioned by Paul Testar, Commissioning Editor, Drama, Channel 5 & Paramount+ and Sebastian Cardwell, Deputy Chief Content Officer, UK, Paramount. The Executive Producers for the series are Paula Cuddy, Eve Gutierrez and Jill Green for Eleventh Hour Films, writer-director Zara Hayes (Showtrial, Battle of the Sexes), writer Jonathan AH Stewart (Devotion) and author Jane Casey. Andy Litvin (Roadkill, Ginger & Rosa) serves as Producer. Zara Hayes is Lead Director, directing episodes 1-3 of the drama.\n\nSony Pictures Television will distribute The Killing Kind internationally.\n\nOn the new series order, Sebastian Cardwell said: “The Killing Kind is another great example of the high-quality local content we have on Paramount+. With Eleventh Hour Films at the helm, we’re looking forward to seeing this adaptation come to life.”\n\nPaula Cuddy and Eve Gutierrez, Executive Producers at Eleventh Hour Films added: “EHF is delighted to be joining forces with Paramount+ to bring Jane Casey’s brilliant book to screen. We were totally gripped by the story of Defence Barrister Ingrid Lewis whose world is turned upside down when she gets too close to her client and are beyond thrilled to have Zara & Jonathan in the driving seat writing the adaptation. And with Zara as the lead director this will be must-see ‘popcorn’ Event TV.”\n\nThe Killing Kind, part of the streaming service’s strategy to commission 150 international originals by 2025, joins the growing list of UK originations, which includes A Gentleman In Moscow, The Ex-Wife, The Flatshare, Sexy Beast, No Escape and The Burning Girls.\n\nJon Creamer\n\nShare this story"
