        "text": "These are times when it’s hard to view flashbacks to the final days of the Nixon era  oil crisis, unemployment, wage and price controls, stagflation  and not wonder if that’s our post-bailout comeuppance.\n\nSo there is nothing escapist about “Life on Mars,” which begins on Thursday on ABC, an unusual cop show that is partly set in 1973 and exhumes a raunchier, dirtier, more dangerous New York City, the one depicted in “Serpico,” “Mean Streets” and, most recently, “American Gangster.” And it’s the show’s back-to-the-future feel, underscored by Harvey Keitel as a tyrannical police lieutenant and Michael Imperioli as a shaggy-haired, smart-mouthed detective, that lifts it above the ordinary and adds Scorsesian pizazz.\n\nPizazz is what’s missing from CBS’s new drama, “Eleventh Hour,” in which Rufus Sewell plays Dr. Jacob Hood, a biophysicist and special adviser to the F.B.I. who is so brilliant that he was considered for a Nobel Prize. Hood is dispatched to solve complex, scientifically baffling cases (human cloning is one) at the 11th hour  hence the title.\n\nEccentric and unpredictable, Hood is watched over by an F.B.I. agent, Special Agent Rachel Young (Marley Shelton), who serves as his muscle and minder. The show is a little like “Fringe,” on Fox, with the benefit of being based on science, not pseudoscience. But unlike the leads of “Fringe,” Hood and Young have no chemistry, and neither do Hood and viewers."
