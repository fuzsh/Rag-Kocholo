The series originally ran on CBS from October 9, 2008 to April 2, 2009 and aired on Thursdays at 10 pm (ET/PT).[1] The series was a joint venture between Jerry Bruckheimer Television, Granada Television International and Warner Bros. Television.\n\nContents\n\n1 Plot\n\n2 Characters\n\n3 Production\n\n3.1 DVD release\n\n4 Reception\n\n4.1 Ratings\n\n5 Episodes\n\n6 Cancellation\n\n7 References\n\n8 External links\n\nPlot\n\nEleventh Hour follows Dr. Jacob Hood (Rufus Sewell), a brilliant biophysicist and Special Science Adviser for the FBI who is brought in to investigate crimes of a scientific or paranormal nature that other agents may be unable to solve. Hood is the government's last line of defense, and it is his mission to keep scientific advances out of the hands of those with nefarious intentions. Special Agent Rachel Young (Marley Shelton), of the FBI's executive protection detail, is assigned to protect Hood. Both Dr. Hood and Special Agent Young are assisted by Special Agent Felix Lee (Omar Benson Miller), towards the end of the series.\n\nCharacters\n\nRufus Sewell as Dr. Jacob Hood – a science adviser to the FBI, called in to investigate crimes that may have a scientific explanation. Though Hood is extremely brilliant, he sometimes gets lost in his own thoughts, and this, coupled with his low attention span and poor social skills, causes him to be viewed as odd. He also has few instincts of self-preservation or danger, causing him to often do things that put his life in jeopardy, such as standing in front of a fleeing suspect's car to get the license plate, something that frequently annoys Rachel. Additionally, he does not know how to drive well, leading Rachel to insist she do all the driving. Hood appears to be an atheist and is knowledgeable on a number of scientific, mathematical and philosophical topics. He nursed his wife, who died of cancer, throughout her illness.\n\nMarley Shelton as FBI Special Agent Rachel Young – Hood's handler. Though she is employed to protect his life, she has also said that her job is \"to protect him from himself\" - something he makes very difficult for her. Hood might annoy her from time to time but she does care about his well-being, viewing his many techniques with a kind of exasperated affection, though she is frequently embarrassed by and for him. Rachel mainly gets annoyed when he gets too caught up in an investigation and does something stupid, or when he does things like accidentally sit on his panic button. It is noted throughout the series that Dr. Hood is her only friend, though male characters frequently flirt with her. She is the latest in a line of Hood's protectors, but she refuses to let him \"drive her away like he did those others.\"\n\nOmar Benson Miller as FBI Special Agent Felix Lee (Episodes 14-18) – introduced later in the series when he asks (although it is later discovered that he begged) to help Jacob Hood on a case. After solving the case, he asks to work with Hood full time, stating that the work they do is amazing. Felix is given the job and works as somewhat of a scout, helping out the team with heading to the location and gathering the material they need by the time Hood and Young get there. Though he likes the job, Felix feels underappreciated due to the lack of praise for the amount of work he does.\n\nProduction\n\nThe original ITV version ran for four 90-minute episodes. However, before the remade series had even premiered, CBS ordered 13 episodes for a one-hour time slot.[2] The pilot episode was produced with a budget of four million dollars, and the remaining episodes were given approximately two million dollars each.[2] Despite shooting \"Agro\" as a second possible pilot, CBS premiered the series with its original $4 million pilot, \"Resurrection\", instead.[3]\n\nDVD release\n\nEleventh Hour was released on DVD October 20, 2009. It was a limited Warner Brothers archive release. The website currently selling the 6 disc set is Warner Brothers Shop.[4]\n\nReception\n\nDespite the absence of any supernatural or science fictional elements, some critics are comparing the series to The X-Files.[2][5] Eleventh Hour debuted after CSI at 10:00 but at 11.6 million viewers retained only 50% of CSI's audience. The show came in second in its timeslot after the premiere of Life on Mars. However, where Life on Mars lost 27% of its audience in its second week, Eleventh Hour gained numbers and saw a further gain in its third week, leading CBS to increase its script order. On December 2, 2008, TV Guide reported that CBS has ordered five additional scripts bringing the series’ total number of first season episodes to 18.[6]\n\nThe Biotechnology Industry Organization launched a blog, EleventhHourFacts.com, which features subject matter experts discussing the scientific reality of each episode through video interviews, live episode blogging and posts.[7]\n\nRatings\n\nSeason Timeslot (EST) Premiere Finale Viewers\n\n(in millions) Rank 1 Thursday 10:00 PM 02008-10-09 October 9, 2008 02009-04-02 April 2, 2009 12.11[8] 22[8]\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Eleventh Hour.\n\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\n\nEpisodes\n\nEpisode # Title Directed by Written by Original air date Viewers\n\n(in millions) 1 \"Resurrection\" Danny Cannon Mick Davis (teleplay) & Stephen Gallagher (story) October 9, 2008 ( ) 11.59 An investigation reveals numerous attempts at human cloning. 2 \"Cardiac[9]\" Clark Johnson Mick Davis October 16, 2008 ( ) 12.04 Several 11-year-old boys die of heart attacks. 3 \"Agro[10]\" Danny Cannon Heather Mitchell October 23, 2008 ( ) 12.16 Hood investigates several cases of food-related paralysis in northern California. 4 \"Savant\" Danny Cannon Heather Mitchell October 30, 2008 ( ) 11.48 Several autistic teens are kidnapped. 5 \"Containment\" Danny Cannon Adam Targum (teleplay) & Stephen Gallagher (story) November 6, 2008 ( ) 10.97 A mysterious disease threatens Pittsburgh, PA. 6 \"Frozen\" Karen Gaviola André Bormanis November 13, 2008 ( ) 11.60 A series of mysterious deaths by way of freezing the person solid plagues the Western coast of the US. 7 \"Surge\" Guy Ferland Fred Golan (story) & Angel Dean Lopez (teleplay) November 20, 2008 ( ) 10.67 A government experiment, in which US troops were subject to inhumane tests, goes awry in Nevada. 8 \"Titans\" Nick Gomez Speed Weed December 4, 2008 ( ) 10.91 College students are dying from the bends. 9 \"Flesh\" David M.

They were involved in an unsuccessful orchestrated effort to have the series picked up by another television network.[15]\n\nReferences\n\nEleventh Hour Facts blog\n\nEleventh Hour at the Internet Movie Database\n\nEleventh Hour at TV.com\n\nWikimedia Foundation. 2010.\n\nDynamic Device Mapping\n\nSimanga Shiba"
