        "text": "New York's major public television station, WNET, yesterday canceled its award-winning nightly public affairs show, ''The 11th Hour,'' citing a lack of long-term financial support and the need to cut costs at the station.\n\nGeorge Miles, the executive vice president of Channel 13, said that the station faces a $13 million budget reduction in the next year and that the station's staff would be cut by about 10 percent.\n\n''The 11th Hour'' was too expensive to continue to produce, Mr. Miles said. ''We have to try to live within our means.''\n\nRobert Lipsyte, the program's anchor, said the demise of his show raised larger questions about the future of public television.\n\nMr. Lipsyte said the program was created to satisfy the mandate of local public television to provide relevant educational programming on local issues. ''If this represents a retreat to that other kind of public television programming, snakes eating weasels and the British on 'Upstairs, Outside,' what do you need public television for? You can get all those things on cable channels, so why bother with public TV? That's what's so distressing.''\n\nThe Answer Changes\n\n''The 11th Hour'' won five Emmy Awards last year, including one for best local anchor, which went to Mr. Lipsyte. Yesterday Mr. Lipsyte delivered a luncheon speech at the New York chapter of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences on the subject ''Do Talk Shows Have to Be Freak Shows to Survive?'' Mr. Lipsytee said he had planned to answer that question with a no until he learned of the cancellation, but the answer now is yes.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
