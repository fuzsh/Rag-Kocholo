        "text": "Sony Pictures Television backed Eleventh Hour Films has optioned author C.M Ewan’s (The Interview, A Window Breaks) highly anticipated new thriller The House Hunt, published today in the UK by Pan Macmillan.\n\nThe House Hunt centres on the story of an everyday young couple, Lucy and Sam who are selling their recently renovated dream house. Alone at home Lucy takes a call from their estate agent, she is running late and needs Lucy to show a potential buyer around the house. Lucy has been clear that she doesn’t want to take any viewings herself and Sam is out at work, but the agent tells Lucy that this buyer is keen to view, he could be the one, and reassures her that she won’t be delayed for too long.\n\nGiven the urgent need to sell the house to clear their debts Lucy reluctantly agrees, but as she begins the viewing something about the man feels wrong and as time passes with no sign of the estate agent Lucy’s unease grows. On the verge of panic Lucy asks the man to leave, but he refuses and turns on her, revealing something inconceivable – and as events spiral beyond Lucy’s control she fears for her own safety, as well as Sam’s, who is due home any moment.\n\nPaula Cuddy, Creative Director, and Eve Gutierrez, Executive Producer and Head Of Talent, Eleventh Hour Films, says: “Hot on the heels of our event drama series The Killing Kind coming to Paramount+ UK in September, we were searching for our next event thriller, and the manuscript of The House Hunt reeled us in. Chris, takes a relatable, ordinary situation and masterfully tilts it on a knife-edge, delivering a tense and gripping story that twists and turns to the very end. We can’t wait to bring it to screen and produce a nerve-shredding rollercoaster ride for audiences”.\n\nC.M. Ewan, author, The House Hunt, says: “Every writer dreams of finding a great partner for a TV adaptation of their work, and I knew from the first moment that Eleventh Hour Films expressed interest in ‘The House Hunt’ that they were the perfect team to develop my book with all the vision and flair I could hope for. The quality drama Eleventh Hour Films are responsible for speaks for itself, and I’m incredibly excited about their enthusiasm and vision for The House Hunt.”\n\nPaula Cuddy, Eve Gutierrez and Jill Green from Eleventh Hour Films will serve as Executive Producers on the adaptation alongside C.M. Ewan. ‘The House Hunt’ will be published in the US by Grand Central Publishing in 2024.\n\nC.M. Ewan is the critically acclaimed and bestselling author of many mystery and thriller novels about ordinary situations that tilt. His work includes The Interview’ and A Window Breaks and his writing has been called “truly compelling” (Daily Express), “chilling and thoroughly enjoyable” (Observer) and “outstanding” (US Publishers Weekly), and his books have been hailed as “popular fiction at its best” (The Spectator) and “crime writing at its best” (Sydney Morning Herald).\n\nThe deal was struck by WME on behalf of the Darley Anderson Literary Agency.\n\nPhoto Credit: Matt Sweeting\n\nPippa Considine\n\nShare this story"
