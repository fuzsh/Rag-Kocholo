        "text": "Sony Pictures Television (SPT) has revealed an increased investment in Eleventh Hour Films (EHF), taking a majority stake in the U.K.-based production company. This move makes EHF the fourth majority-owned, U.K.-based scripted drama company in SPT’s International Production group, joining Left Bank Pictures, Bad Wolf and Eleven.\n\nThe investment follows a period of growth for EHF, which has secured multiple commissions and recommissions. SPT aims to bolster EHF’s strategic growth and strengthen collaborative ties.\n\nEHF, founded in 2010, has produced several popular dramas, including “Magpie Murders” and its upcoming sequel “Moonflower Murders,” both based on novels by Anthony Horowitz, for PBS Masterpiece and the BBC. Other productions include a new adaptation of the “Rebus” crime novels for the BBC, “The Killing Kind” for Paramount+ U.K. and Hulu, and three seasons of the spy series “Alex Rider.” EHF is also set to produce an upcoming original mystery thriller, “Nine Bodies In A Mexican Morgue,” written by Horowitz for MGM+ and the BBC.\n\nJill Green, EHF’s founder, will transition from CEO to chair, providing strategic support and executive producing select dramas, including leading on those written by Horowitz. Head of talent and executive producer Eve Gutierrez and creative director Paula Cuddy have been promoted to co-CEOs to lead the company’s next phase of growth.\n\nSarah Woolway has joined EHF in the newly created role of chief commercial officer, overseeing commercial, legal and financial matters. Woolway previously held positions at Gaumont U.K. and BBC Studios.\n\nThe leadership changes will take effect immediately for Gutierrez and Cuddy, with Green assuming her role as chair in September. Helion Partners advised EHF on the transaction.\n\nThis investment aligns with SPT’s strategy to consolidate its international production group’s portfolio and expand its intellectual property in the scripted content market.\n\n“Over the past decade, Jill, Eve, and Paula have built a remarkable company and it has been a great joy for everyone at Sony to have been part of their adventure”, said Wayne Garvie, president, International Production, Sony Pictures Television. “Starting with ‘Alex Rider’ and right through to ‘Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue,’ we’ve witnessed first-hand their ability for consistently delivering high-quality, commercial event television with global appeal. We are overjoyed that they are becoming a full member of our roster of world-leading drama labels. Their development pipeline suggests that the next few years are going to be even more remarkable, and Sony Pictures Television will be a proud partner.”\n\nGreen added: “Eve, Paula and I have been a tight team working together on an amazing EHF journey. Now with the full support of Sony Pictures Television and a strong senior team restructure, I have every confidence that an equally brilliant future lies ahead.”\n\nGutierrez and Cuddy said: “Together with Jill we have developed and produced a raft of shows we are incredibly proud of with brilliant writers and production teams. As co-CEOs we are delighted to now lead the company onwards into its next exciting chapter, remaining true to Jill’s founding principle of always striving to find ways to bring great stories to screen – on schedule and on budget.”"
