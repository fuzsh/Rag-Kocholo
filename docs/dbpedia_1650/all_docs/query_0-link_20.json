Miller.\n\nTV show description:\n\nBased on the British television series of the same name, this science-based drama focuses on a biophysicist and Special Science Adviser. He helps the FBI investigate scientific or paranormal crimes that are too difficult for the regular agents.\n\nDr. Jacob Hood (Rufus Sewell) is used by the FBI as their last line of defense, and he makes sure that those with criminal intentions are kept away from potentially dangerous scientific advances. A widower since the loss of his wife to cancer, he sometimes gets lost in his own mind and doesn’t have very good street smarts. He doesn’t drive well and leaves his handler to do the lion’s share of the driving.\n\nSpecial Agent Rachel Young (Marley Shelton) is Jacob’s handler, assigned to the FBI’s executive protection detail. She sometimes feels like she’s protecting him more from himself than others. He’s her only friend but she’s often hit on by other guys. Jacob drove away all his other handlers, but she refuses to let him do the same to her.\n\nJacob and Rachel are assisted by Special Agent Felix Lee (Omar Benson Miller). He actually begged to get the tough assignment and acts as a scout for the team, getting everything ready for the investigation before the others get there."
