        "text": "I like both of those shows and I thought both had done well this season - good enough to secure another year, anyways.\n\nThe Wiki entry for \"Eleventh Hour\" has it ranked at #23 over the season with audiences usually between 11 and 13 million for each episode. Why would a relatively successful show be cancelled?\n\nThe Wiki entry for \"Numb3rs\" states that it was renewed.\n\nI finally think I'm done with Numb3rs after this year anyway. Same crap, interchangeable secondary players with bogus back-stories that exist seemingly to allow actors to go in and out at the whim of a focus group.\n\nAnd it's never going to go anywhere: just yer basic Scooby-gang talkin' tech and macho, catch the bad guy every episode, then gather in Dad's living room for a beer.\n\n(that's not the \"embarrassed\" smiley - that's me nodding-off in the last reel)\n\nI do (did, now) analogize \"The Mentalist\" and \"Eleventh Hour\" and enjoyed both as, at least, a pleasant diversion.\n\nI thought of \"Eleventh Hour\" as a low-key version of \"The Mentalist\".\n\n\"Numbers\" wasn't always even, but was often interesting, if a little pretentious; I liked the final pizza and beer gathering, as a nod to family and normalcy.\n\nIt was also always nice to see Judd Hirsch, alive and well (and working).\n\nWe only got Numb3rs a couple of years ago in the UK but they screwed it up by showing it on two different channels all at different times so now we are up to season 5 I think in two years. As you can imagine we have totally lost the plot there but to be honest it is rather samey and the maths bit does get a bit 'yeah right' seems they have reduced the maths bit quite a lot.\n\nAs for Eleventh Hour, good to know as this is about to 'premier' in the UK so we can miss that one.\n\nDid you say \"figures\" with regard to \"Numbers\" and \"11th hour\"? They may as well cancel 90125 and 30 Rock while they're at it...\n\nWhew. Scaring me. Gf and I love NUMB3RS.\n\nAlso for those who like to watch Ghost Whisperer with the sound off, you can do the same w/ NUMB3RS. Donny and Charlie's girlfriends aren't too hard to look at either.\n\nDidn't mean to scare anyone: heard about \"Numb3rs\" 'cancellation', checked it (at that time), searched the Forum, found nothing and started the thread. Learned consequently (here) that \"Numb3rs\" was NOT cancelled, although some here are apparantly not fans.\n\nOne idea I have: Might be useful to read the posts in a thread before posting - Beatles threads, obviously excepted - because, things change.\n\nNow, will someone please post that \"Eleventh Hour\" is NOT cancelled?\n\nThank you.\n\nThe US version of Eleventh Hour was much more interesting and entertaining than the UK Patrick Stewart version - which surprised me, as I dig Patrick.\n\nI'm sorry it's off. But I'm not surprised. But picking up Medium. I don't like the show, I don't like Arquette - I'd rather keep watching Flashpoint.\n\nI used to like Numb3rs but I got tired of it. (are any of these guys over 5'5\"?)\n\nI would have liked it better if Numb3rs got canceled and The Unit was on Fri. after Medium."
