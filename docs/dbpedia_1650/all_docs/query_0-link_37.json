        "text": "Only four episodes of this 2006 British version of the Eleventh Hour TV Show were broadcast during January and February. Their titles were, \"Resurrection,\" \"Containment,\" \"Kryptos\" and\"Miracle\".\n\nThis series inspired a U.S. version of Eleventh Hour in 2008.\n\nSeries creator Stephen Gallagher emphasized that Eleventh Hour would be based on \"hard\" science and would not be science fiction. Against his wishes additional material was added to the scripts of the latter episodes to spice up the plotlines and Gallagher left the series in disgust.\n\nEleventh Hour got huge attention in the media due to having a huge star like Patrick Stewart and the reported 4 and a half million pounds price tag!\n\nIt's ironic that both stars on this series are from the United Kingdom (Stewart from England and Jensen from Scotland) and both have made it big in both Hollywood and on American television. Not that many actors succeed in both mediums much less originate abroad and from the same part of the world!\n\nThree of the four episodes of this series were adapted for the 2008 U.S. series."
