        "text": "The Eleventh Hour (medical drama)\n\n(New York Local series on WNBT, 1954; NBC Primetime, 1962 - 1964) [Following on the success of their long-running Dr. Kildare medical drama, MGM produced this series about a court-appointed psychiatrist, which was adapted from a local drama series aired in New York ten years earlier starring Wendall Corey. Wendall Corey was again cast in the lead role, but after the ratings sagged, he was replaced by actor Ralph Bellamy; and a new THEME was written by Harry Sukman replacing the original one. The THEME was adapted from a library track, which had become a well-known melody through both instrumental and vocal records during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Neither cast change nor theme change boosted the ratings much. So after two network seasons the series was dropped from the NBC lineup.]\n\nTheme 1 (1954): \"The Film Opens\"\n\nComposer: Cedric King Palmer (British PRS/ASCAP) Original Publisher: W.

This adaptation of the music library THEME was made for the commercial release. During the 1950s and early 1960s both an instrumental and vocal version -- of what was re-named the \"Eleventh Hour Melody\" -- became popular as a romantic ballad. So by the time MGM revived the series for airing on the NBC network, some 10 years after its first appearance on local New York TV, its THEME had already established a national audience] Original Composer: Cedric King Palmer (British PRS/ASCAP), with music adapted by Winifred Palmer (British PRS/ASCAP), and lyrics added by Carl Sigman (ASCAP) Original Publisher: W.
