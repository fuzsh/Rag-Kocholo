        "text": "Given the overnight runaway success of medical dramas such as Dr. Kildare on NBC and Ben Casey on ABC, which both debuted on the Fall 1961 schedule, it was inevitable that more medical dramas would follow. CBS tried to play catch-up by introducing The Nurses on its Fall 1962 schedule, while NBC decided to double its medical offerings by launching a psychiatric-based drama, The Eleventh Hour, on Wednesday evenings following Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall. The Eleventh Hour revolves around the psychiatric practice of Dr. Theodore Bassett, played by veteran Hollywood character actor Wendell Corey, and his younger protégé, psychologist Dr. Paul Graham, played by Jack Ging. The Bassett character had a prior career as an attorney before entering psychiatry, and this past experience with the criminal justice system makes him a go-to for legal cases in which a defendant must be evaluated to determine whether they should be considered legally sane or insane, such as in the series pilot episode \"Ann Costigan: A Duel on a Field of White\" (October 3, 1962). Bassett's legal background also provides the series with the necessary cover to slide into the crime-solving formula that serves as the foundation for other police and legal dramas. It's worth noting that the Paul Graham character does not appear in this first episode, suggesting that perhaps he was a late addition after the series had been approved for production. Instead, Bassett consults in this case with psychologist Lucy Anderson and intern Dr. Edward Alden, neither of whom appear in any future episodes. However, it is also clear that Ging's Paul Graham character is a play for the younger demographic using the same formula seen in legal dramas such as Sam Benedict with Richard Rust and Carl Held's short tenure as David Gideon during the 5th season of Perry Mason in 1960-61. Graham's role on The Eleventh Hour consists largely of administering tests to patients and occasionally second-guessing Bassett's assessments, though he gets to take the lead on a couple of cases when Bassett has other obligations--\"Angie, You Made My Heart Stop\" (November 14, 1962) and \"Eat, Little Fishie, Eat\" (December 5, 1962). But in those episodes, Graham comes off as a mini-Bassett, employing the same techniques and resisting the same pressures as his older mentor. Bassett, on the other hand, is introduced to us as a kind of mental whisperer. The pilot episode opens with a melodramatic scene in which a patient in the mental ward of the county hospital goes berserk, assaulting the medical staff in an attempt to escape and running down the hallway until he reaches the elevator. Just then, the elevator doors open and there stands Bassett, calm and unflinching, meeting the patient's gaze without a trace of fear before exerting a calming influence that persuades the patient to desist and return to his room. The scene establishes Bassett as someone who cannot be pressured into deviating from what he believes to be the best course of action for each patient. When he is called in to evaluate a suspect's sanity, such as the title character Ann Costigan in this first episode, he refuses to make snap judgments despite a legal calendar requiring a decision by a certain date. In this case, Ann Costigan has killed her husband, but Bassett must determine whether she was legally sane when she did so. Costigan certainly gives off the appearance of someone who is insane with her petulant outbursts in court hurling insults at the judge and making other odd remarks as well as claiming that she killed her husband because he was planning to kill her and had tried to do so multiple times before. The judge and prosecuting attorney are concerned that her madness could be just an act and that she knows full well that being declared insane and committed to a mental institution could lead to being declared sane as soon as a year or so later, allowing her to be freed without ever serving any jail time. There is also concern about what she may do to her late husband's young daughter if given custody of her, so Bassett's job is to dig beneath her exterior behavior to see what she is really thinking and feeling. Which brings us to a discussion of the methods used by Bassett, and in later episodes Graham, to explore the buried feelings and events of their patients. First they administer Rorschach tests, followed by a series of crude paintings that invite the patient to create a story based on what they see in the paintings. The Rorschach ink blot tests, developed by Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, were intended to identify thought disorders in schizophrenics, which remains their most effective use. Over the years many have questioned the tests' validity and the objectivity of test administrators, but they remain in use for certain types of cases, and their popularity varies by country--they are very popular in Japan but mostly distrusted in the U.K. Not satisfied with the results of these tests on Ann Costigan, Bassett then has her reunited with her late husband's daughter at his office to see not only her reaction to the child but more importantly the child's reaction to her. This meeting does reveal any problems, so Bassett then arranges to have sodium pentothal administered to Costigan on the terrace of her home where she pushed her husband to his death, hoping that the location and effect of the \"truth serum\" will uncover what she was really feeling when she killed him. Sodium pentothal's use is also controversial. While it is generally recognized as able to reduce inhibition and the higher cortical brain function believed to be used when someone is lying, it is also a dangerous barbiturate and some have questioned the reliability of confessions obtained under its influence. Until recently it was used in this country in lethal injections until the overseas companies that made it refused to supply it for that use. In our story, the application of sodium pentothal on Costigan only makes her attempt to throw herself over the ledge where her husband died, or at least she appears to make an attempt. So Bassett then proceeds to playing his last card--putting Costigan under hypnosis and making a post-hypnotic suggestion that will force her to cut her hair short, after she had earlier claimed that her husband forbade her to do so, when she hears the triggering sound of the door clicking shut in her room. Bassett's intern Dr. Alden is at first skeptical of the technique's validity until Bassett puts him under and tells him that when he awakens he will have a powerful thirst that can only be quenched by water from the pitcher on Bassett's desk. Even though he recognizes where his thirst is coming from after awakening, Alden cannot quench it with anything other than the water from Bassett's pitcher. And so when Bassett puts Costigan under, she complies and cuts her hair, though it takes all night for her to finally succumb to the suggestion. Afterwards she finally confesses to killing her husband because he was old and ugly, to killing his first wife because she was fat, and to hating the daughter because she had to change her dirty diapers when she was a baby. Today testimony obtained through hypnosis is banned in almost every state, except Texas. Regardless of the mostly outdated methods used in the pilot episode, it establishes Bassett as a medical professional who insists on exploring each case thoroughly until he finds an explanation that appears irrefutable. He is also depicted as a man who listens carefully to what his patients tell him and offers a recommendation that he feels is in their best interests, which may not align with those in power. In the second episode, \"There Are Dragons in This Forest\" (October 10, 1962), Bassett and Graham are called to examine a World War II veteran accused of desertion in the last days of the War and who is extradited from Germany to face a court martial. The accused, Mark Tyner, does not dispute that he left his unit and stayed in Germany, marrying a German woman with whom he has had two sons, but he does not seem to remember the events surrounding his alleged desertion. Rather than using the methods employed in the previous episode, Bassett and Graham have Tyner and his German wife Carla reenact in a kind of mini-drama their first meeting just before the armistice with Germany was declared. When Tyner becomes mentally blocked in recalling his encounter with Carla's fiance Werner at the time, Bassett and Graham step in to portray the two, forcing Tyner to interrupt when they get the details wrong, which leads to Tyner having to admit that he killed Werner because he assumed he was a Nazi when he was actually working undercover for the Allies. So while this reenactment absolves Tyner from the charge of desertion because he was still acting as a U.S. soldier when he thought he was killing a Nazi, it also exposes to his German wife that he killed her fiance but never told her, making for a very difficult reconciliation after 17 years of marriage and the raising of their two sons. The usually snarky TV Guide reviewer Gilbert Seldes was apparently moved by this episode in his review in the November 17, 1962 issue such that he offered no criticisms of the series but instead praised the series for its adherence to reality. At the end of the episode, Tyner's wife forgives his killing perpetrated under the fog of war because the bonds of her current family are stronger than anything else, a resolution very similar to that in the Cold War-themed episode \"I Don't Belong in a White-Painted House\" (October 24, 1962) in which George C. Scott plays a Soviet defector who has created a new life with an American wife and son until he begins feeling the pull of the fatherland and feels compelled to return to Russia. After all his tests and interviews, Bassett is forced to tell FBI agent Sterne that he cannot deprogram Anton Novak in such a short time and with no legal justification to detain him, there is nothing they can do to stop him from returning to Russia, that is, until Bassett is able to make Novak see that Russia will expect him to bring his wife and son with him, meaning that his son will undergo the same sort of state programming that he did. Finally recognizing that he does not want his son to be stripped of his free will and self-determination, Novak abandons his return at the last minute because again the bond of family is stronger than that of nationality. One of the boldest episodes of those that aired in 1962 is \"Of Roses and Nightingales and Other Lovely Things\" (November 7, 1962), which deals with the issues of teenage pregnancy and abortion. In this story 15-year-old high school student Laura Hunter's increasingly hysterical behavior is revealed to be prompted by the fact that she is pregnant. When the school doctor recommends to her parents that they have her talk to Bassett, the parents at first tell him that at age 15 having a baby would be life-destroying, but he has to remind them that abortion is not legal and that getting an illegal one could be dangerous (a particularly poignant point from 60 years ago). However, Bassett does not object to abortion merely on legal or moral grounds, in talking with Laura he learns that she has an aversion to the idea of it because of an experience she had as a child with a mother cat who abandoned one of her kittens, allowing it to die. So Laura is determined to have the baby, but she also feels determined to keep it, which does not seem like the best choice for anyone involved. A gossipy neighbor of Laura's mother insists that the parents must pressure the parents of the boy who fathered the child to make the teenagers get married. But Laura admits that she is not in love with the boy and does not want to marry him, and once the parents drive by his house to get a look at him, they realize that he, too, is still a child and not ready for parenthood or marriage. All if which brings Bassett to the conclusion that the only real solution is for Laura to have the child and give it up for adoption. Laura is vehemently opposed to this option and even considers jumping out of the family treehouse to cause a miscarriage rather than surrender her baby, but her younger brother is able to talk her out of it, and finally the whole family comes to accept Bassett's proposed solution as the best for both Laura and the baby's future. While it might seem at first glance that the episode is a win for the so-called pro-life agenda, Bassett's approach is to let Laura make her own choice once she has carefully considered all the ramifications of that choice. The key to Bassett's character in the series, as he says in another episode, is that his job is not to tell people what they should do but to listen. The series also undertakes a sensitive treatment of post-partum depression in \"The Blues My Babe Gave to Me\" (December 12, 1962), which dramatizes overwhelmed new mother Christine Warren unable to cope with her new, more restrictive role as mother to her infant while also battling a repressed false memory of having killed her younger sister whom she was forced to take care of at a young age. While at first glance many viewers might be quick to judge a mother who wants to kill her own baby, the episode provides a foundation of childhood trauma to explain such a compulsion. Childhood trauma also plays a prominent role in the aforementioned \"Angie, You Made My Heart Stop\" in which a young woman thinks she caused her father's heart attack by startling him during a game of hide-and-seek, resulting in a twisted sense of self as a bringer of death and a string of lies that only leads to further tragedy to confirm that narrative. Though the series occasionally resorts to melodrama for sensationalist effect, such as the rampaging mental patient from the first episode mentioned above, or a tortured run through the city by co-dependent sister Ruth Radwin in \"Eat, Little Fishie, Eat\" in seeking out her brother whom she feels bonded to, it also should be praised for tackling difficult subjects and attempting to educate the viewer about many misunderstood mental disorders. Seeing these mental patients through the eyes of Dr. Bassett, we are encouraged to suspend initial snap judgments and to just listen to gain a better understanding of the misery that other people are going through. The theme song and single episode scores for The Eleventh Hour were composed by Harry Sukman. Sukman was born in Chicago on December 2, 1912 and made his concert debut on piano at age 12. In 1941 he was hired by the Mutual Broadcast System in Chicago as pianist and conductor and remained in that position until he moved to Paramount Studios in Hollywood in 1946. In 1954 he began getting assignments to compose scores for feature films for Ivan Tors Productions, including the science fiction dramas Riders to the Stars and Gog. He continued working on B-grade feature films throughout the 1950s such as The Phenix City Story, Sabu and the Magic Ring, and Verboten! His career in television began in 1957 when he was hired to score an individual episode for Tales of Wells Fargo. Three years later he began getting more assignments on Death Valley Days, Laramie, and Alcoa Theatre. Working with Morris Stoloff, he shared the Oscar for Best Score at the 1961 Academy Awards for Song Without End. The two were nominated again the following year for the score to Fanny but did not win. Sukman would garner one more Oscar nomination for the score to The Singing Nun at the 1967 Academy Awards. After scoring 4 episodes of Dr. Kildare for its first season, Sukman was tabbed to compose the music for The Eleventh Hour. He would score 56 more episodes for Dr. Kildare and began getting occasional assignment on other series such as The Virginian, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, and Peyton Place. After scoring most of the episodes for the short-lived 1966-67 western The Monroes, Sukman was hired to write the score for The High Chaparral in 1967, for which he received his first Emmy nomination. He worked on several other series during the late 1960s including Gentle Ben, Cowboy in Africa, and Bonanza as well as composing for occasional feature films and TV movies. He received his second Emmy nomination for his work on the 1979 TV mini-series version of Salem's Lot. He released a few albums of his piano instrumentals, beginning with Liberty Records in 1956, as well as a few more albums tied to his work on film scores. He died of a heart attack on his birthday in 1984 at the age of 72.\n\nThe first season has been released on DVD by Warner Archives.\n\nThe Actors\n\nFor the biography of Jack Ging, see the 1961 post on Tales of Wells Fargo.\n\nWendell Corey\n\nWendell Reid Corey was born on March 20, 1914 in Dracut, Massachusetts. His father was a Congregationalist minister who had a single feature film appearance in the 1951 western Rawhide and who traced his roots back to U.S. Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. The younger Corey attended high school in Springfield, Massachusetts and initially considered a career in professional tennis but instead wound up selling appliances in a department store. His entry into the theater was by chance: a friend was acting in a local production of Street Scene in 1934 and when another member of the cast had to bow out, Corey was invited to fill in. After spending a year with the same theater group, he made his professional debut with a Holyoke company in a 1935 production of The Night of January 16. In 1938 he was employed by the Federal Theatre Project, part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, which is where he met his wife Alice Wiley. He made his Broadway debut in a 1942 production of Comes the Revelation. Corey served in the military during World War II and received the Legion of Honor award from Czechoslovakia. He resumed his theatrical career after returning to civilian life and in 1945 was spotted by film producer Hal Wallis while acting in Dream Girl. Wallis had Corey signed to a contract with Paramount Studios for whom he made his feature film debut in the 1947 noir thriller Desert Fury along with another Wallis discovery, Burt Lancaster. Corey worked steadily in feature films thereafter, mostly in supporting roles, most notably in Sorry, Wrong Number with Barbara Stanwyck, Any Number Can Play with Clark Gable, The File on Thelma Jordon again with Stanwyck, Holiday Affair with Robert Mitchum and Janet Leigh, Harriet Craig with Joan Crawford, and Hitchcock's Rear Window with James Stewart and Grace Kelly. Beginning in the late 1940s, Corey also doubled up by appearing in radio dramas such as Cavalcade of America, Lux Radio Theatre, and Inner Sanctum. In 1951 he began appearing on television, at first on drama anthologies such as Schlitz Playhouse, Lux Video Theatre, and Robert Montgomery Presents. He played Lou Gehrig in a 1955 episode of Climax! while continuing to make a few feature films each year. He appeared in Elvis Presley's second feature Loving You in 1957 and began his first TV recurring role as Captain Ralph Baxter on Harbor Command. His next regular TV role came in the 1959 summer replacement series Peck's Bad Girl, which lasted 14 episodes. In 1961 he co-starred with Nanette Fabray on Westinghouse Playhouse, also known as The Nanette Fabray Show, in which he played her husband with two rude children from a previous marriage. During this period Corey also began getting involved in Republican politics. He was the Master of Ceremonies at both the 1956 and 1960 Republican National Conventions. He was elected President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1961, serving two years in that role, and was a board member of the Screen Actors Guild. However, Corey's career also began to be affected by his alcoholism. Despite being cast in the lead role as Dr. Theodore Bassett on The Eleventh Hour in 1962, he left the series after its first season and was replaced by Ralph Bellamy. After supporting Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Presidential Election, Corey was elected to the Santa Monica City Council in 1965, on which he served until his death. However, his feature film roles began declining into exploitation fare such as Women of the Prehistoric Planet, Cyborg 2087, and Picture Mommy Dead all in 1966. That year he also ran for an open Congressional seat but was defeated in the Republican primary. After appearing in feature films The Astro-Zombies and Buckskin in 1968, Corey played a washed-up movie director in The Star Maker later that year. After returning from filming in Berlin, Corey became ill and died from cirrhosis of the liver at the Motion Picture & Television Hospital on November 8, 1968 at the age of 54.\n\nNotable Guest Stars\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1, \"Ann Costigan: A Duel on a Field of White\": Vera Miles (shown on the left, starred in Wichita, The Searchers, The Wrong Man, The FBI Story, and Psycho) plays murderer Ann Costigan.
