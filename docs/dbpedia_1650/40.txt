Eleventh Hour is among six pilots to have been picked up to series by CBS on the eve of its upfront presentation.

The cult show - based on a short-lived British series starring Patrick Stewart and Ashley Jensen - follows a government scientist tackling threats such as global warming and deadly viruses. It is being reversioned for the US under the direction of Jerry Bruckheimer.

The network has also given series orders to the dramas The Mentalist, The Ex List and Harper's Island, as well as the comedies Worst Week and Project Gary.

CBS will unveil its full 2008-09 schedule tomorrow (Tuesday) afternoon.
