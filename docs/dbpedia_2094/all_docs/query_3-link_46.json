        "text": "Agitations for breakaway states in Nigeria are nothing new and a controversial car salesman has emerged as the latest figure calling for a Yoruba nation in the country's south-west.\n\nHailed as a hero by his supporters, Sunday \"Igboho\" Adeyemo is seen as a dangerous rabble rouser by his opponents, accused of inciting ethnic hatred and stockpiling illegal weapons.\n\nMr Adeyemo first achieved some national notoriety last October when he used the country's independence day to call for the creation of an independent Yoruba republic, although he was widely ridiculed for the idea at the time.\n\nHe is being taken more seriously now, as he has become a lightning rod for grievances related to land rights.\n\nIn early July, he fled the country after authorities raided his home in Ibadan as the authorities cracked down on separatists figures.\n\nJust days before the raid on Mr Adeyemo's home, Nnamdi Kanu, another separatist leader who wants a Biafra state in the country's south-east, had been arrested in a foreign country and brought back to Nigeria.\n\nMr Kanu is currently facing charges of felony.\n\nMr Adeyemo was arrested in neighbouring Benin three weeks later and Nigeria wants him extradited to face charges back home.\n\nHe is accused of stockpiling arms, which he denies.\n\nLionised in a feature film\n\nOnce only well-known in his part of south-western Nigeria, Mr Adeyemo became a national figure after he thrust himself into the heart of one of the country's deadliest conflicts - clashes between Fulani herders and other groups, over access to land and grazing rights.\n\nAfter the killing of a politician in January, Mr Adeyemo felt he had seen enough and captured attention with his demand that the Fulani herders, from northern Nigeria, leave the south-west, seen as the home of the Yoruba ethnic group, for all their alleged crimes.\n\nThis self-styled defender of the defenceless, popularly known as Igboho - after his hometown in south-west Oyo state - is no stranger to controversy and deadly conflict.\n\nThe 48-year-old has been lionised locally for his role, in the late 1990s, in age-old intra-Yoruba communal battles. His reputed exploits were acted out in a feature film that was a fantastical display of magic charms and juju.\n\nIn one scene where rival gangs face off, the actor playing Mr Adeyemo arrives on a motorcycle, picks up a poisoned banana and calmly eats half of it without feeling any ill effects. He then plucks a machine gun out of thin air and fires at his opponents who flee in every direction.\n\nThat film and other tales about him, such as that he walks around with a snake around his neck, have contributed to a local reputation of invincibility.\n\nWho is Sunday Adeyemo?\n\nBorn in 1972 in Igboho, Oyo state\n\nRuns a dealership selling new and second-hand cars\n\nWas a motorcycle mechanic in his early years\n\nHas a foundation named after him that caters to the needy\n\nIt is not clear how he came into the car business that he operates out of the city of Ibadan but he seems to have made a success of it, selling everything from new Rolls Royces to second-hand Toyotas. His clientele include powerful politicians and governors and he is often seen with them in public.\n\nLand rights were originally at the core of his grievances which morphed into agitations for nationhood.\n\nFulani herders and their families walk for hundreds of kilometres from the extreme north to central Nigeria and beyond at least twice a year to find the best grazing land for their cattle.\n\nBut this has often led to friction with local communities, who accuse their cattle of trampling on their crops, and sometimes accuse the herders of robbery and other crimes.\n\nSome of the herders are also employed by rich southerners who own cattle but employ Fulani to look after them.\n\nA federal government plan approved in 2019 to solve the problem by creating ranches for the herdsmen was rejected by most southern governors who accused President Muhammadu Buhari, a Fulani, of hatching a plot to grab land for his people.\n\nIn the past few years, clashes have become more deadly as both the Fulani and those opposed to them have set up armed self-defence militias.\n\nIn the south-west, state governors established a regional security outfit, Amotekun, to help deal with the problems.\n\nOpen grazing has also been banned in all six south-western states.\n\nTensions were ignited in December after the killing of politician Fatai Aborode in Oyo state.\n\nMr Adeyemo decided to take matters into his own hands and told the Fulanis to go, without providing any evidence of their involvement in that killing or other alleged crimes.\n\nEviction order for Fulani herders\n\nAfter his seven-day ultimatum expired in January, he held a rally in the area where the killing took place, after which the homes of some more settled Fulani, who had been part of the community for generations, were burned.\n\nMr Adeyemo denied responsibility for the trouble, saying that the police had been with him all through the time he was in the area.\n\nBut he also travelled to Yewa in Ogun state to \"evict\" Fulani herders.\n\nThere, he was received by a joyous crowd and whipped them up by saying that \"killer herdsmen\" had escaped justice \"because the herdsmen are close to the federal government\".\n\n\"Any Fulani herdsman who engages in kidnapping should be flushed out,\" he added.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nHis actions have been widely condemned, especially by groups in northern Nigeria who accuse him of inciting ethnic violence and engaging in the \"unlawful eviction\" of citizens.\n\nSome political leaders in the south-west have joined in the criticism but there were also massive support for him in the region.\n\nFederal lawmaker Shina Peller wrote a message on Instagram saluting Mr Adeyemo's \"courage, bravery, and participation in this struggle\".\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .
