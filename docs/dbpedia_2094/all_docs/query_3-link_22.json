Stavis provides an estimate of over one million deaths, Teiwes cites a figure of one to two million executed, while Domes believes that five million were killed during the campaign. See Benedict Stavis, The Politics of Agricultural Mechanization in China (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978), 29–30; Frederick C. Teiwes, “The Establishment and Consolidation of the New Regime, 1949–1957,” in The Politics of China: Sixty Years of the People’s Republic of China, ed.

Hurst, 1980), 8. Julia Strauss presents a good overview of the various estimated figures for deaths during land reform (and the concurrent campaign to suppress counterrevolutionaries), giving a figure of one to five million in total for both campaigns. See Julia Strauss, “Morality, Coercion and State Building by Campaign in the Early PRC: Regime Consolidation and After, 1949–1956,” China Quarterly 188, no. 1 (2006): 901 n. 17.

Research that has addressed the mass mobilization of violence in land Page 224 →reform has focused primarily on the prerevolutionary land reform campaign carried out in the northern Communist base areas between 1946 and 1948 during the Chinese Civil War. The CCP carried out land reform, violently and nonviolently, many times beginning in the 1920s; however, the civil war-era land reform campaign was the largest episode of violent land reform before 1949.

This number encompasses nearly all counties in Anhui and Jiangsu, apart from a few that did not publish local gazetteers.\n\n73. Until its dissolution in 1954, Rao Shushi (饶漱石) headed the East China Bureau, which oversaw the Northern Jiangsu Regional Government, the Southern Jiangsu Regional Government, the Northern Anhui Regional Government, the Southern Anhui Regional Government, Zhejiang Province, Shandong Province, Fujian Province, and the municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The Party used the Yangzi River to split Anhui and Jiangsu into its northern and southern administrative halves, before they were recombined into provinces after the land reform campaign, around 1952.\n\n74. For the precise division between Huaibei and Jiangnan, I follow G. W. Skinner’s division of Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces into the North China and Lower Yangzi Delta macroregions. See G. W. Skinner, “Regional Urbanization in Nineteenth-Century China,” in The City in Late Imperial China, ed. G. William Skinner (Taipei: SMC Publishing, 1995), 211–49.\n\n75. Both Huaibei and Jiangnan are nebulous geographic terms that refer roughly to the area around and north of the Huai River valley and the area around the Lower Yangzi Delta, respectively. In concrete terms, this study looks mainly at the provinces of Anhui and Jiangsu, which encompass a large part of both regions. See Chapter 3 for detailed descriptions of the geographic and socioeconomic contrast between Huaibei and Jiangnan.\n\n76. Peter A.

See The Hurricane [暴風驟雨], directed by Jiang Yue and Duan Jinchuan (Hong Kong: China Memo Films, 2006).\n\nRenmin Chuban She: 1951), 9.\n\n39. How local communities and Party work teams made use of this leeway in target selection is one of the central issues this chapter explores and the principal subject of Chapter 5.\n\n40.

According to the archival record, if cadres intervened they almost always reduced the severity of the crowd’s recommended punishment. There are no data that can determine how often cadres increased or decreased the harshness of punishments, but it is revealing that the Party tended to pull back the violence of the crowd. This is also in line with the finding I present in Chapter 5 that areas with a larger Party presence tended to exhibit lower rates of violence, which I argue is due to the Party’s insistence on carefully controlling the scope of violence. Lucien Bianco has made similar observations. See Bianco, Peasants without the Party, 235.\n\n42. According to data from eight struggle sessions (seven village level and one township level) from a “key point” township in Lutang District of Fengyang County in Northern Anhui, the number of accusers per struggle target ranged from fifteen to thirty-eight, while the number of overall attendees at each struggle session varied from 100 to 808. Accusers comprised at least 10 percent of those in attendance and, in the case of Wudai Village, almost one-third of attendees.

Oral history BS10, May 2015.\n\n45. In a group oral history with several residents in Jiading County, residents told me that, in their view, land reform was not violent in their village. However, when struggle targets were disobedient or talked back while being struggled against, they would be beaten—“only clapped a few times on the head” (打几次耳光)—until they relented and continued to cooperate. Minor physical abuse seemed so normalized during land reform that the term “violence” (暴力) seemed only to refer to lethal violence. Oral histories JD02, JD03, JD04, JD05, April 2015.\n\n46.

Goldberg et al.’s experimental work on outrage demonstrates the importance of morality in provoking and sustaining a desire for retributive reprisal. They find that priming outrage through the revelation of unpunished “normative violations” triggers an “intuitive prosecutor” mindset, whereby affected individuals will more readily accept and propose harsh punishment, not just of the original transgressors but future, unrelated transgressors as well. Significantly, they do not find this effect when they prime anger without embedding it in a moral frame. See Goldberg, Lerner, and Tetlock, “Rage and Reason.”\n\n50. Following Davenport, I treat the state’s belief in the efficacy of moral mobilization and the actual efficacy of this strategy to build popular solidarity as separate hypotheses to be tested in my analysis of the Maoist state.

Curiously, this is contradicted by the CCP’s own behavior in the region before 1949. Once the Communists returned to the region following the Japanese invasion in 1937, they mobilized locals across class lines and called for “class unity” against the Japanese, promising to help landlords collect rents from their tenants in exchange for their loyalty and a modest reduction in rent.

These findings accord with what other scholars have argued about landlordism in Jiangnan. Namely, local landlords who lived in the countryside tended to be tied to the local community through kinship ties; and most landlords rarely were in direct conflict with their tenants because they lived in the cities.

According to a 1952 Northern Jiangsu Regional Party Committee report, 12,241 unlawful landlords and evil tyrants were arrested by July 1952, which is almost double the number of arrests reported in the February 1951 report; however, these numbers do not disaggregate by sentencing. Nevertheless, the point of these figures is to demonstrate the relative proportions of those arrested and executed, which likely remained roughly the same throughout the campaign.

I do not include counties from Shandong, which was also part of the East China Bureau, because a majority of its counties experienced land reform before 1949.\n\n4. Philip C. C. Huang, The Peasant Economy and Social Change in North China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1985).\n\n5. Most notably, I gathered struggle target data for all of southern Jiangsu from Southern Jiangsu Regional Party Committee, “Statistical Table of Mass Struggles in the Land Reform Period in the Southern Jiangsu Region” [苏南区土地改革时期群众斗争情况统计表], August 28, 1952, SNTGWX, 801. Also available at Southern Jiangsu Regional Party Committee, “Summary of Southern Jiangsu Land Reform Work” [苏南土地改革工作的总结（附表）], August 28, 1952, BSDA, no. 1-2-001-066. I cross-checked these data with gazetteer data for all counties in southern Jiangsu; the discrepancies were nonexistent or extremely small. In cases with discrepancies, I used the number reported in the gazetteers, as they are presumably written on the basis of local documentation. In most cases, the numbers reported in the gazetteers were slightly higher than those from the southern Jiangsu regional report.\n\n6. For more on the historical genealogy of the county gazetteers, see Eduard B. Vermeer, “New County Histories: A Research Note on Their Compilation and Value,” Modern China 18, no. 4 (1992): 438–67.\n\n7. Huang notes that southern Jiangsu’s post-1949 land reform campaign tended to use the township as the level of policy implementation, often pooling together struggle targets from multiple villages within the same township and struggling against them at township-wide struggle sessions. In my own archival research in northern Anhui and southern Jiangsu I also observe that most land reform reports report statistics at the township level with only passing reference to individual villages under the township’s jurisdiction. This suggests that in the Page 248 →post-1949 era, villages in the same township carried out political struggle together, most likely, as Huang suggests, to deal with the difficulty of identifying struggle targets in every village. See Philip Huang, “Rural Class Struggle in the Chinese Revolution: Representational and Objective Realities from the Land Reform to the Cultural Revolution,” Modern China 21, no. 1 (1995): 116–17.\n\n8. While nearly all localities finished land reform by 1952, those hit by natural disasters or that were conquered particularly late were allowed to delay the campaign. In East China, the region under study, northern Anhui was allowed to delay land reform because of the massive flood that devastated the region in 1950, affecting nearly ten million residents, or about half of the region’s population. Nevertheless, many localities still pressed on with land reform despite the urgent need for continuing disaster relief. In Fengyang County, which was hit again by a flood in 1951, the county Party committee argued that because land reform and disaster relief were fundamentally campaigns concerned with improving agricultural production, cadres should not suspend land reform work but rather conduct land reform and relief work simultaneously. See Fengyang County, “Directive on Current Work” [对当前工作的指示], July 27, 1951, XCSSN. For an overview of the impact of the 1950 flood in northern Anhui, see Zeng Xisheng, “August 1, 1950, Telegram to the East China Bureau and Forwarded to the Center” [1950年8月1 日致华东局并转中央的电报], The Collected Works of Zeng Xisheng [曾希圣文选], 78–79.\n\n9.

Indeed, Kalyvas questions the extent to which researchers can label violence as “political” when such a large proportion of it is private, or at least a mixture of political and private. Since the Chinese Party-state mobilized most of the violence in this analysis—and it is truly difficult to imagine this violence occurring in the absence of state mobilization—I think it is fitting to describe violence during land reform as “political,” even if it sometimes had private motives. See Kalyvas, Logic of Violence; Stathis N. Kalyvas, “The Ontology of ‘Political Violence’: Action and Identity in Civil Wars,” Perspectives on Politics 1, no. 3 (2003): 475–94; Kalyvas, “Ethnic Defection.”\n\n28. It is true that superior levels of government supplied additional Party members through dispatching work teams comprised of urban intellectuals to some “key point” (重点) townships and villages, but these work teams could not substitute for the lack of local Party members who understood local conditions.\n\n29.

Because the focus of this study is on state-sanctioned violence, I define violence as the infliction of harm on civilians with the intention to cause suffering, by state actors or social actors who engage in such behavior with the encouragement of the state. This definition of violence includes both lethal and nonlethal forms of violence, which differs from much of the civil war and genocide literature that focuses exclusively on lethal violence. While this focus on lethal violence makes sense for the study of genocide, there is little theoretical justification for looking exclusively at lethal violence when considering state-sanctioned violence.\n\n34. For more on “relative deprivation,” see Gurr, Why Men Rebel.\n\n35. One mu equals one-fifteenth hectare.\n\n36. A cursory comparison of grain yields across the four regional jurisdictions in Anhui and Jiangsu reflects well-known regional differences in terms of agricultural development and commercialization. Southern Jiangsu, the wealthiest region in this part of East China, had an average of 144.40 kg/mu, followed by southern Anhui (105.60 kg/mu), also located in the fertile Lower Yangzi region. Northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu had significantly lower grain yields, at 75.03 kg/mu and 62.64 kg/mu, respectively. Calculations made using author’s county gazetteer data set.\n\n37.

Indeed, before 1949 Baoshan was one of Jiangsu Province’s principal producers of cotton. Because of its focus on its comparative advantage in cotton production, it was not a self-sufficient producer of grain. See Baoshan County Gazetteer, 152. Huang notes that the county’s high soil salinity prevented the cultivation of crops other than cotton. See Huang, Yangzi Delta, 87.\n\n101. Bernhardt, Peasant Resistance, 191–92, 205.
