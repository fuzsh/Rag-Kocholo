        "text": "THE PEKING EXPRESS: The Bandits Who Stole a Train, Stunned the West, and Broke the Republic of China, by James M. Zimmerman\n\nSpare a thought for bandits — social bandits, that is, not common robbers, dacoits, badmashes, brigands or gangsters snarling, “Leave the gun, take the cannoli.”\n\nSocial bandits are, rather, peasant heroes of popular resistance, cheated of their livelihood, exploited and scorned by landlords and power brokers, the nascent revolutionaries who seek justice in the asymmetrical warfare of class struggle. They are known all over the world, from the early “Haiduks” of the Balkans to Robin Hood, Pancho Villa and Sun Mei-yao, the leader of the horde which attacked the Peking Express one night in 1923, the subject of James M. Zimmerman’s excellent new book.\n\nThough “The Peking Express” describes in exhaustive and dramatic detail the derailing of this train, in rural China, by just such desperate and resourceful men, neither in the text or extensive bibliography does Zimmerman allude to “Bandits,” by the great Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm. However, this book reads like an extensive and enlightening footnote to that study of the people whom Hobsbawm describes as “peasant outlaws whom the lord and state regard as criminals, but who remain within peasant society, and are considered by their people as heroes, as champions, avengers, fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation and in any case men to be admired and supported.”\n\nSuch banditry was an ancient tradition in China, recounted in the 15th-century novel “Shuihu zhuan” (“Water Margin”) and enduring into the modern warlord era. The province of Shantung (Zimmerman uses the Wade-Giles system of Romanized transliteration, as was the custom in 1923), where the train was attacked, was dominated by warlords and foreign investors and consequently thick with peasants deprived of justice. The instigator of what became a suspenseful global story, 25-year-old Sun Mei-yao was a former soldier who sought back pay for his men, reinstatement in the army, and — ultimately — the overthrow of the Chinese government. His plan was to derail the train, kidnap as many passengers as possible, keep them as hostages and bargain for their release.\n\nCompare this ambitious, sinister yet somehow high-minded scheme to the complacency of the mostly European and American first-class passengers on the train from Shanghai to Peking, delighting in luxurious sleeping cars and excellent meals. Among them was John D. Rockefeller’s sister-in-law, the heiress Lucy Aldrich; the distinguished publisher John B. Powell; various U.S. Army officers; a Fascist Italian diplomat; and a number of men from Shanghai’s Jewish community — a stockbroker, a jockey, a playboy and at least one criminal, Joseph Rothman. The other carriages were crammed with hundreds of poor Chinese traveling hard class.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
