        "text": "JOHN HOOD COLUMN: Don’t overlook down-ballot races\n\nPublished 11:30 am Thursday, August 1, 2024\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nRALEIGH — I have no idea who will be elected president this November. Respectfully, neither do you.\n\nIf the tumultuous nature of today’s politics weren’t already evident, the past two months have surely confirmed it. Over the course of a few short weeks, former President Donald Trump was convicted of felonies, current President Joe Biden delivered the most disastrous debate performance of modern times, Trump survived an assassination attempt, Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris speedily gathered the support of enough delegates for the Democratic nomination.\n\nMost Americans haven’t fully digested these historic events. Perhaps more such twists are coming.\n\nConsider the international situation. America is supplying two combatants engaged in major wars — in Ukraine and the Near East — as well as other partners fighting terrorists, bandits and insurgents in other countries. Our navy is fighting what is, for now, a low-intensity conflict with the Houthis of Yemen to protect shipping to and from the Suez Canal. And our forces and allies in East Asia are bracing for a potential military conflict with a revanchist China and its allies.\n\nWhat if one these sparks sets off a wider conflagration? I pray that doesn’t happen. But it might. Or other political surprises, foreign or domestic, could upset the best-laid plans of dicing men.\n\nTo accept uncertainty does not require apathy or cynicism. The 2024 presidential election is compelling and consequential. By all means follow and participate in it. Just don’t fixate on it. There are many other races on the North Carolina ballot this year. They deserve your attention, too.\n\nEither Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson or Attorney General Josh Stein will be our state’s next governor. Both are vacating their current positions, producing competitive races for lieutenant governor (longtime Republican staffer Hal Weatherman vs. Democratic N.C. Sen. Rachel Hunt) and attorney general (Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop vs. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jeff Jackson).\n\nOther key contests on the Council of State include state treasurer (Republican investment professional Brad Briner vs. Democratic N.C. Rep. Wesley Harris), state superintendent of public instruction (Republican activist Michele Morrow vs. Democrat and former district superintendent Mo Green), labor commissioner (Republican attorney Luke Farley vs. Democrat and Charlotte City Councilman Braxton Winston), state auditor (Republican attorney and former UNC-Chapel Hill Board Chairman Dave Boliek vs. incumbent Democrat Jessica Holmes), and insurance commissioner (incumbent Republican Mike Causey vs. Democratic N.C. Sen. Natasha Marcus).\n\nA dozen or so competitive races in the state house, and half that many in the state senate, will determine whether Republicans retain supermajorities in the state legislature. One tossup race for Congress in northeastern North Carolina — pitting Republican Laurie Buckhout, a retired army colonel and business executive, against incumbent Democrat and former state legislator Don Davis in the First District — could determine partisan control of the U.S. House.\n\nThere are four judicial races on the statewide ballot. Republican Jefferson Griffin and Democrat Allison Riggs are contesting a seat on the N.C. Supreme Court. Voters will also fill three slots on the Court of Appeals: Republican Tom Murry vs. Democrat Carolyn Thompson, Republican Valerie Zachary vs. Democrat Ed Eldred, and Republican Chris Freeman vs. Democrat Martin Moore.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of other candidates on the North Carolina ballot, as well, seeking to win or retain offices such as county commission, school board, district attorney, judge on the superior or district court, clerk of superior court, and register of deeds. Some municipalities are also holding elections this year for mayor and other offices.\n\nFinally, all North Carolinians will see a statewide referendum on their ballot. It is a proposed amendment to the state constitution providing that only a citizen of the United States who is at least 18 years of age shall be entitled to vote. Its passage will clarify some ambiguous language and preclude any statutory expansion of the franchise to non-citizens.\n\nYou’ll find campaign websites for virtually all these candidates. Study them. Make your choice. And don’t sweat what you can’t control.\n\nJohn Hood is a John Locke Foundation board member."
