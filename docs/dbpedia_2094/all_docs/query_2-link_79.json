        "text": "Wang Quanyuan woke up on a bright morning in May feeling a moment of happiness. She had spent a rare night with her new officer husband. Outside the wooden house, their temporary village billet in Sichuan province, she could see a blue lake surrounded by fields of barley with tall, snowy mountains rising up behind; where she came from there was no snow and to her it looked like sugar. It was 1935, the second year of the Long March. Wang's marriage was to prove unequal to the adversities ahead. Had she known, she might have been torn between the desire to seal their union more tightly by having her husband's child, and the fear of falling pregnant - one of the greatest fears among women on the epic march through China.\n\nThe day her period came, a few weeks later, \"I felt as if a millstone had been lifted from my neck. I promptly climbed up a mulberry tree and got a wad of leaves. Standing there, I wanted to shout to the world, 'I'm not pregnant! I'm not pregnant!'\" The women, she said, \"dreaded pregnancy more than the plague\".\n\nRecalling those times, Wang, now 91, still had a look of pain on her gentle face, when I tracked her down at the start of my journey retracing the Long March. This was the 8,000-mile trek by the fledgling Communist party and its armed forces that was to become the founding legend of communist China, a symbol of endurance and courage. Only a fifth of the 200,000 marchers survived the ordeal that began in 1934, when the Red Armies had to leave their bases in southern China - where Mao Zedong had been the leader of a short-lived communist government - to escape annihilation by Chiang Kai Shek's nationalist forces. Of the 40,000 who reached the march's end two years later in China's barren north-west where the communists regrouped, fewer than 500 are believed to be alive today, and they are in their 80s and 90s.\n\nSetting out to follow the route they took, I wanted to find out about the realities behind the legend, searching out survivors and unlocking their stories. Born in China in the 1960s, I had been raised, like millions of young Chinese in the decades after the revolution, on heroic tales of the journey. Make light of our difficulties, we were told, and \"think of the Long Marchers\".\n\nOver 10 months, travelling mainly by bus and train through areas little changed to this day, I found 40 of the march veterans. Talking to them, I learned that their suffering, and what they overcame, was actually much greater than we had been told, especially among the women. Some of the realities they described also sit uneasily with the myth - none more so, perhaps, than the fate of the children of the Long March: the children left behind, children given over for hurried adoption after being born along the way, the young taken on as recruits and sometimes abandoned if they could not keep up.\n\nThe march comprised different armed columns, following differing routes. Wang was one of just 30 women chosen to join 86,000 men on the march in Mao's First Army. Six of these women were pregnant at the start of the march; they had to be carried on stretchers. \"Imagine having a stomach twice as big as a water melon,\" Wang recalled. \"How could one fight the enemy? It was a joke.\" These pregnant women could not be left behind because they were the wives of senior party leaders, including Mao's wife, He Zizhen. You could say that the others, unmarried women such as Wang and her comrades, were brought along to deflect criticism that leaders' wives were getting special treatment when the army's rule was not to take women.\n\nWang saw one woman go into labour while marching, with the baby's head dangling out. Another had a difficult birth with Chiang's troops in hot pursuit, and bombs dropping like rain. As if afraid of the violent world, the baby refused to come out. A whole regiment of the rearguard was ordered to put up a fierce fight for more than two hours and lost a dozen men. After all their pain, however, the women were not allowed to keep their babies. It was the rule with the First Army: a crying baby could endanger the troops. The tiny boy whose arrival cost a dozen soldiers's lives was left on a bed of straw in the abandoned house where he was born.\n\nThe same rule applied when He Zizhen gave birth in the early spring of 1935. It was the third time she was forced to abandon a child. Her first child with Mao, a girl, was given to a peasant woman when she and Mao had to flee their guerrilla base. Next came Little Mao, who looked very much like his father, hence the nickname. He was two years old when the First Army began the march. No one could bring small children along, not even Mao.\n\nHe Zizhen wept before leaving Little Mao in the care of her sister, who was married to Mao's brother. Mao did not even say goodbye to his son. He could not know that six months later his brother would be killed in battle, taking with him the secret of the location to which he had moved the boy for safety; he had not even told his wife. He Zizhen could hardly bring herself to do the unthinkable again, only four months after she had torn herself away from Little Mao.\n\nWhen she was asked to give the girl a name, she shook her head: she doubted she would see her again. Wrapped in a jacket, the baby was handed to an old lady, the only person who had not fled on hearing the Red Army was coming. At first she refused, saying she had no milk and could not possibly look after the child. But when she saw the handful of silver dollars and a few bowls of opium offered as payment, she changed her mind. Years later, He Zizhen was still tormented by her decision: \"I did not even get a good look at my baby. I wasn't even clear where exactly she was born.\"\n\nIn June 1935, the First Army was reunited with another column, the Fourth Army, in Sichuan. The handful of First Army women, including Wang Quanyuan, were surprised - there were thousands of Fourth Army women, even a women's regiment, which Wang was later to command. Opium was the main reason: in Sichuan, every family grew opium, and most of the men were addicts. Often children were too: when they cried or were sick, their parents would give them a sniff to quiet them. Women smoked, but not nearly as much as men, so the Fourth Army had no choice but to recruit women.\n\nStrict rules prohibiting ordinary soldiers from mixing with the women's unit did protect these women, but not from the enemy. Later on, many in the women's regiment were captured and raped by Muslim warlords' forces in the north-west. Wu Qingxiang, aged 82 when I met her, still shuddered to recall what she had been through as a 12-year-old member of a performing propaganda troupe. \"After they took us, we heard them saying, 'The Red bandits really look after their women well. Every single one of them was a virgin.'\" Another regiment veteran and rape victim, Feng Yuxiang, who lives in a village not far from Wu's, told me the same story. I could imagine them in some dark corner trembling after their ordeal, hearing those words.\n\nIn the Fourth Army, female soldiers were able to bring their children and husbands from the start - they would have been lost without them. Some men had their entire families, because had they stayed behind they might have been killed by government troops. The older children were taken on as orderlies, messengers, health assistants and buglers. \"When you saw men with children on their backs, or babies peeping out from the horses' panniers, you wondered if we were really an army,\" said Ma Haidiche, a commander in the women's regiment, now in her early 90s and living in a Muslim town in Gansu province in the country's far north-west.\n\nShe remembered a mother walking in front and holding a boy in one hand, a bed roll in the other; behind her a girl had her younger brother tied to her back. A few days later, she saw the mother again, but not the children. \"Perhaps she gave them away. Then her children were lucky,\" Ma said quietly, because soon they were to enter the grassland in the far west of Sichuan where they had no food, and there were no villages where local people might take in abandoned children. What little food they had was kept for the soldiers. Even so, large numbers of female troops in Ma's unit died. \"So many times, I was too hungry to stand up,\" she said. \"Death was easier than life. It was so tempting, just one breath away.\" Still she was shocked to see a woman drown her baby in a swamp, unable to bear the child's hungry cries.\n\nHe Jiesheng, the daughter newly born to He Long, commander of the Second Army, was luckier. Her father took her with him because he could not find a family to take the three-week-old infant. Carrying her was hard work. Her mother said: \"My baby was heavier than a machine gun! If I were a man, I would rather carry a gun. At least I could fight if the enemy caught up with us.\" He Long tried to help carry her, but the child was so hungry she would burrow into his chest, looking for her mother's breast. Luckily, He Long discovered that fish were plentiful - the Tibetan peoples who lived in the Sichuan grassland did not eat them. The baby girl survived, the youngest person to complete the two-year March. Now aged about 70 and living in Beijing, she can look back on a life that saw her become one of the few female generals in the Chinese army.\n\nThe Red Army also had large numbers of young recruits, the Little Red Devils, most in their early teens. No one is sure of their number. Wang thought it was 5,000 or 6,000 out of 100,000 in the Fourth Army, and roughly the same number in the First Army. Li Wenying was 14 at the time of the march. She had been sold as child bride, and found herself trapped with a cruel mother-in-law. Like so many Little Red Devils, she joined up for a square meal and some pork now and then. \"When I was small, we saw pigs running about, but never knew what they tasted like. Only the landlords could afford it.\"\n\nFollowing the Long March route, I came across a report in an archive in Sichuan. It was compiled by Nationalist officials, detailing Red Army stragglers abandoned in their particular county. My heart ached as I ran down the list, so young, half of them in their early teens, the youngest only nine years old. In the remote Sichuan grassland, I found one of them, Sangluo, now an old man in his mid-80s. He was 13 when he joined He Long's army far to the east in Hunan province, but in the grassland he could not keep up with the marchers. One morning when he woke up, the troops were gone. They had left behind more than a thousand sick and wounded, and the young. \"I screamed and screamed. The Red Army was like my parents. How could they abandon me just like that?\"\n\nHis youth saved him: the Tibetan families of the grassland relished a son, or took pity on the children. He was taken in by a lama, whose mother looked after him. Isolated for most of his life on the pasture with no other Han Chinese, he can no longer speak Chinese, nor remember his home village. The man before me looked completely Tibetan, his wrinkled face the same dark red as his robe, his fingers bent from the rheumatoid arthritis that plagues the nomads. He was grateful for his life: most of those abandoned with him died of hunger or were killed by the local people. As I said goodbye, I asked him whether he felt Chinese or Tibetan. He replied, \"Does it matter?\"\n\nWhat of the children who were never taken on the march, left behind when their parents set off? They fared no better. When nationalist troops took the communist bases, they butchered communist sympathisers and frequently mutilated or hacked to bits the children entrusted to these people's care. Once the families looking after left-behind children knew what was coming, some sold them off, or went into hiding. Yet others became attached to the children in their care and could not face losing them when their parents returned, so they moved elsewhere. As a result, very few of the Red Army marchers ever saw their children again.\n\nAs soon as the communists came to power in 1949, He Zizhen, by then no longer Mao's wife, and her sister and brother tried to find all three of Mao's abandoned children. Her sister was killed in a car accident with a boy supposed to be Little Mao, although the child had been claimed by another veteran. Her brother thought he had found the eldest daughter, and then another Little Mao. He Zizhen rushed to Nanjing to see the boy, and was convinced he was her lost son because of his oily ears and armpit odour, which she said were common to all five of her children with Mao. But this little boy was also claimed by someone else, with the blessing of the party. Rather than lose the boy, He Zizhen decided to share him with the parents who claimed him, keeping in close touch and showering him with love and gifts. But she never got over the thought that he was her only surviving son with Mao, even though Mao had long given up on both of them. The anguish of pain and loss kept her in and out of mental hospital for the rest of her life. Decades later, the search went on: in November 2003, two young men from Britain made headlines by announcing to the world that they might have found Mao's long-lost daughter from the march. The only way to prove her identity would be by testing the DNA of Mao's one known surviving daughter. But she has refused to collaborate. There have been so many claimants that perhaps the pain of loss can never be healed, for Mao's family and for all the other marchers.\n\nAnd what of Wang? Children were on her mind all her life. But like two-thirds of the women survivors I talked to, the conditions on the march - the perpetual hunger, the freezing cold in the mountains, the incessant marching over rough terrain - made her infertile. She adopted seven orphans, but one after another they deserted her, saying she was not after all their mother. Her only comfort is that two of them married each other and continue to live with her, caring for her in her old age. She regretted being unable to bear children herself; but her last words to me were: \"It was a small price to pay for the revolution.\""
