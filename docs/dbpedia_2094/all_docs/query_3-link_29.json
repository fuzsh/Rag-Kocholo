        "text": "“Signalize the Good, Separate the Bad”: The Imperial Precedents of the Struggle Session\n\nThe Chinese imperial state’s techniques of moral governance—strategies designed to regulate public morality and proselytize Confucian orthodoxy—inspired, directly and indirectly, the Party’s tactic of using struggle sessions to humiliate perceived norm violators and political enemies and rally public outrage against them. A Qing-dynasty county magistrate handbook traces the imperial tradition of moral governance back to the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE), citing the following lines from The Rites of Zhou (周礼): “Signalize the good, separating the bad from them; give tokens of your approbation to their neighborhoods, distinguishing the good so as to make it ill for the evil, thus establishing the influence and reputation of their virtue.”22 The idea of governing thought traces back similarly far. Philosophical writings on “techniques of the mind-and-heart” (心术) predate the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), and the “Learning of the Heart-and-Mind” (心学) and its associated concept of “the Art of Governing the Mind” (治心之术) were integral to the Song neo-Confucianism that predominated in later dynasties.23 Indeed, the Qing state relied specifically on Song neo-Confucianism as a mode of ideological control because it “stressed social duties and human relationships.”24 The handbook asserts that moral governance provides rulers with important Page 44 →practical benefits. Proper moral education could maintain social stability and ensure the obedience of one’s subjects, in ways ranging from refraining from criminal behavior to paying taxes: “If education is neglected the people will not know the principles of filial piety, brotherly love, propriety, and virtue, and all manner of antisocial and disruptive behavior will occur.”25\n\nThe most significant tool of moral governance in the Chinese countryside was the village compact (乡约) system and the reading of the Sacred Edict (圣谕). The village compact system employed lectures on public morality to indoctrinate villagers to be obedient and virtuous subjects. Mandated in 1670 by the Kangxi Emperor, officials used the village compact system to host public readings of the Sacred Edict, which contained Sixteen Maxims regarding proper behavior in all realms of life. The imperial state even produced an explanatory guide for the Sacred Edict to ensure that its message reached even the most uneducated segments of society.26 Though village compacts had appeared in earlier dynastic periods, they were heavily promoted during the Qing. As Terada explains, under the Qing the village compact became a “public lecture” circuit concerned mainly with proselytizing villagers to follow an officially approved moral code, which expanded the system’s audience to encompass the entire rural populace.27\n\nA village compact meeting began with an elaborate morning ceremony held in a large and clean open space in front of the imperial tablet, situated on a high table in a dragon pavilion along with incense, candles, and flowers. After kowtowing to the imperial tablet, the principal lecturer and his assistant alternated reading and explaining each of the Sixteen Maxims of the Sacred Edict, with each maxim punctuated by a single strike of a sounding board. Also positioned at the meeting site were the “the registers of good and evil deeds.” The red-covered register of good deeds listed upstanding villagers, such as chaste women, filial sons, and those who had performed selfless or generous acts, while the black-covered register of evil deeds named those villagers accused of having committed immoral acts.28 The registers—alternatively known as the “ledgers of merit and demerit”—were originally written and used as guides for moral self-cultivation, but by the time of the Ming-Qing transition they had become a part of the moral governance of local life.29 The registers of good and evil deeds were posted at “exposition pavilions” (申明亭) alongside imperial edicts. Evil deeds, particularly those concerning the negligence of “filial and fraternal duties,” would remain in these pavilions until offenders had made amends. Hsiao aptly describes these ledgers as a “spiritual pillory with which the authorities hoped to Page 45 →shame villagers and townsfolk into better behavior or at least to deter them from straying from the prescribed path of duty.”30\n\nThe village compact system had fallen into disuse or, ironically, become a vehicle of corruption by the end of the Qing dynasty, though it was still being implemented regularly in many parts of the country. By the early twentieth century the village compact system had lost much of its authority, and many peasants viewed the system as being complicit in state corruption. The ceremonies became opportunities for corrupt local officials to extort money and gifts from locals, who were sometimes coerced to attend. The increasingly top-down nature of the system, which had devolved into a mechanical tool of state indoctrination, no longer engaged with local community issues. Strangely, village compact officials even ceased to do moral indoctrination work; in many areas these officials had transformed into tax collectors or political.31\n\nStrikingly, the legacy of the village compact system lived on through the rebellious behavior of the peasantry in the late-Qing and Republican periods. Although discredited, it became an important component of the peasantry’s contentious repertoire, which provided them the knowledge and tools that shaped the character of rural rebellion. Turning the official system on its head, it became common to see peasants draw on similar rituals from the village compact system when forming coalitions and attacking corrupt officials and landlords. For example, during rent-resistance movements, peasants would sometimes create their own “compacts” (约) to ensure solidarity among members to refuse to submit rents to their landlords; they would then use violence to police the behavior of their members to ensure unity in their ranks.32\n\nMost strikingly, Mao observed that the peasants intimidated their opponents by brandishing the “register of good and evil deeds” used during village compact meetings, where locals were lauded or admonished for their behavior. In his 1927 Hunan Report, Mao described this as the Qing practice of “the other register”:\n\nIn the Ching Dynasty, the household census compiled by the local authorities consisted of a regular register and “the other” register, the former for honest people and the latter for burglars, bandits and similar undesirables. In some places the peasants now use this method to scare those who formerly opposed the associations. They say, “Put their names down in the other register!”33\n\nPage 46 →Mao does not use the term “register of good and evil deeds” or “ledgers of merit and demerit” to describe these two registers, but “the regular” and “the other” most certainly refer to registers used in village compact ceremonies. He also observed that the peasants cast a net far wider than that presupposed by Marxist notions of class: “The peasant movement targeted local tyrants, gentry, and landlords, but also corrupt urban officials, patriarchy, and even bad rural customs.”34 Preempting critiques of the peasants’ violent means of resolving local social conflict, Mao claimed that the peasantry used what legalists would call moral retributivism—that is, they tailored their punishments to fit the severity of the crime:\n\nThe peasants are clear-sighted. Who is bad and who is not, who is the worst and who is not quite so vicious, who deserves severe punishment and who deserves to be let off lightly—the peasants keep clear accounts, and very seldom has the punishment exceeded the crime.35\n\nMao’s observations of the peasants’ use of the village compact practice of celebrating and denouncing moral virtue and transgression and their emphasis on retributive justice in the allocation of violence appear to have shaped the Communist ritual of the struggle session.\n\nThere are no policy documents explicitly linking Mao’s Hunan Report to the institution of the struggle session, but there are remarkable similarities in the practices of the struggle session and the situation Mao described in 1927. The mere idea of classifying people based on their moral behavior had clear precedents in the village compact system and imperial moral governance more generally. Just as the imperial state categorized people “according to the attitudes and reactions which they showed at a given time” into “good people” and “weed people,” “wicked sticks,” and “bandits,”36 the Party sought to classify rural society into “good” classes and various kinds of “non-people”—landlords, counterrevolutionaries, Nationalists, and so on.37 While far more theatrical and engaging than the old village compact lecture circuit, struggle sessions also put good and evil deeds on public display, though with a much greater emphasis on the latter.38 This use of public forums to judge moral behavior has its roots in neo-Confucian thought: Zhu Xi, in his writings on the village compact system, recommended “group criticism” as a way of regulating the proper behavior of community members.39 At struggle sessions, offenders were commanded to repent and “bow their heads to the masses” (向群众低头), which could possibly earn them a Page 47 →reprieve. As the head of the East China Bureau stated, “Landlords who obey the law and bow their heads to the masses should be treated with magnanimity” (对守法并向群众低头的地主, 应宽大处理).40 Certainly, this form of public shaming and violence pales in comparison to the public display of immoral acts in the registers of good and evil deeds, yet the general spirit of the practice is similar: through the public accounting of immoral behavior, the state could regulate the moral conduct of the masses and establish itself as a legitimate moral arbiter.\n\nThe Influence of Rural Folk Opera on Struggle Sessions\n\nMany scholars have remarked on the theatricality of struggle sessions during land reform, as well as the campaign to suppress the counterrevolutionaries.41 As Julia Strauss writes, “[Struggle sessions were instances of] real theatre in which spectacle, state-sanctioned morality and audience participation coalesced into one remarkable show.”42 This “state-sanctioned morality” of class struggle, however, drew on moral tropes from rural folk opera that influenced these public performances at struggle sessions. As Eugenia Lean observes:\n\nDuring Yan’an, the civil war years, and into the 1950s, “spontaneous” struggle sessions against landlords and other “reactionary” elements of society enflamed the strong affective commitment of the “masses.” While often touted as spontaneous by leftist organizers, these struggle sessions were, in fact, carefully orchestrated to conform to long-standing and highly familiar moral narratives of good and evil drawn from China’s vernacular storytelling and operatic traditions.43\n\nThough struggle sessions certainly took cues from traditional folk operas, they absorbed this influence indirectly through Communist-written land reform operas, which were themselves patterned on rural folk operas.\n\nTraditional rural opera exhibited strong themes of anticorruption and retributive justice that mirrored the imperial state’s moralized view of official corruption, in terms of its moral dichotomy between good and evil officials and the benevolent center and the abusive localities. As Hung writes, “What we do know is that many of these tales [in traditional operas] are saturated with stories about the plight of commoners under evil officials, miserable subjects appealing to benevolent and parent-like higher authorities, Page 48 →and how the bad officials were penalized and avenged in the end.”44 For example, the popular Lord Bao (包公) operas—a Song-dynasty judge known for his impartiality and incorruptibility—dramatize Lord Bao’s investigations into and rulings on cases of corruption, murder, and other wrongdoings in which powerful evildoers are brought to justice in the end.45 In these operas, Lord Bao’s facial makeup (脸谱) is predominantly black with a white crescent moon to represent his “iron face without selfishness” (铁面无私)—that is, his stern impartiality and incorruptibility.46 Aside from their themes of anticorruption, these operas sometimes directly influenced rural rebellion by supplying characters and rituals that rebels incorporated into their contentious repertoires. Notably, The Investiture of the Gods (封神演义), a novel-turned-opera from which the Boxer rebels drew many of their major deities, portrayed the struggle between the future Zhou dynasty founder and his allied deities and “the least corrupt and evil ruler of the Shang [dynasty].”47\n\nThe CCP translated these tropes of good and evil from traditional folk operas into the idiom of class struggle through the production and staging of “land reform” operas—for example, The White-Haired Girl (白毛女), Liu Hulan (刘胡兰), and Red Leaf River (赤叶河). These operas portrayed to their audiences a “rural society [that] was rife with intense class hatreds due to a universally evil and exploitative landlord class.”48 Brian DeMare has shown that Communist cultural troupes modeled land reform operas on folk operas in both content and artistic form. Land reform operas contained similar themes of retribution against cruel and unjust officials that were prevalent in traditional rural opera. One of the prevalent archetypes DeMare identifies in land reform operas is the morally depraved “evil landlord.” In The White-Haired Girl and Red Leaf River, the evil landlord antagonist is “notable for both his love of cheating the peasantry and his predilection for sexual assault.” These vilified landlords were transgressors on multiple fronts. The White-Haired Girl portrays the evil landlord Huang Shiren not just as a sexual predator but also as a kidnapper and a drunk.49 While many of these operas were based on the traditional xibanzi operas, the way in which they used preexisting artistic conventions aligned with their portrayal of certain characters as valorous or villainous. For example, composers used melodies for “evil or crafty” characters in traditional opera in scenes that portrayed antagonists like landlords and other “reactionary” types.50 The power of these operas to elicit moral outrage was such that they unintentionally provoked audience members to attack the performers. A troupe performing The White-Haired Girl, for example, reported that audience members would sometimes throw rocks at the actors playing villains on stage.51\n\nPage 49 →Although land reform operas were independently important as tools of boundary work that distinguished between immoral landlords and the innocent masses, they also helped introduce the ritual of a struggle session to rural audiences.52 The climax of The White-Haired Girl is in fact a violent struggle session against the landlord antagonist (see Fig. 4).53 In front of a peasant crowd, the heroine speaks bitterness against her tormentor, “whipping the crowd into such a frenzy that peasants attending the meeting begin beating the two villains before she could even finish her accusations. After she concludes her story, the two are beaten again and taken away to await trial and execution.” By viewing an artistic performance of a struggle session, the actual peasant audience learns how to perform and stage their own.54\n\nThe theatricality of struggle sessions certainly conformed to the kinds of moral narratives presented in land reform operas and traditional folk operas before them, but the selection of targets and the use of violence was grounded in concerns of retributive justice that characterized pre-1949 rural protest. Eyewitness accounts comment on the theatricality of land reform struggle sessions, but they also reveal their remarkably retributivist nature. Hinton’s description of a struggle session in Longbow Village illustrates the use of theatrics to elicit moral outrage against a man who hoarded grain while his fellow villagers starved. In his description of the first struggle session held in the village for Kuo Ch’ung-wang, who was “not the richest man in the village but . . . one of the meanest,” the organizers of the struggle session clearly wanted to sensationalize the ill-effects of his greed—namely, his seizing and hoarding of grain during a famine year in which his others starved to death:\n\nOn the day of the big meeting [the struggle session], the grain, which could have saved the lives of dozens of people, lay in the courtyard in a stinking mildewed heap. The people who crowded in to accuse walked over the grain Page 50 →and, as the courtyard filled up, some of them sat down on it. The smell and the sight of it reminded them of those who had died for want of a few catties [of grain] and filled them with anger.55\n\nThe struggle session against Kuo was designed to be a spectacle that could arouse the anger of attendees, but this outrage stemmed ultimately not just from the theatrical setting but also from its combination with a moral transgression that provoked in attendees a desire for retributive justice. A similar example on a much larger scale comes from Xu Hongci’s recently published memoir, in which he recalled his experience as the former secretary of the Northern Jiangsu Small Group (苏北小组) of the East China Bureau’s Rural Committee’s Land Reform Inspection Team (中共中央华东局农委土改巡视团). In November 1950, at a meeting with the Northern Jiangsu Party Committee Rural Committee (苏北区党委农委) in Yangzhou, he learned that the northern Jiangsu government wanted to stage its very own struggle session and execute several landlords as a “test” of its efficacy in mobilizing the masses, who had been reluctant to participate in the campaign. Attending this prearranged struggle session in a town in Jiangdu County, the author wrote of its heavy theatricality:\n\nFairy Temple was a dilapidated small town; [the county officials] used a clearing on the east side of town as the site for the struggle session. The Jiangdu County Party Committee knew that all these high-level officials were coming, so they fixed up the space to make it very stately; they even carefully selected and organized the peasant masses who were to attend the session. The “speaking bitterness” session was ordered and methodical (次序井然), and there were frequent climaxes (高潮迭起); it was rich in theatricality (极富戏剧性). . . . Time passed minute by minute, second by second, and in the final moment, the county Party secretary announced that these two landlords, guilty of heinous crimes and having refused to reform their ways, would be executed. The soldiers dragged them to the side of the meeting space; the young [landlord] struggled for his life, trying to shout something, but the rope tied around his neck was pulled so tight that he couldn’t make a peep. In a flash, the crowd blocked my view and two gunshots rang out. . . . This was my first lesson in the bloodiness of class struggle.56\n\nXu’s account reflects the resemblance between the government-staged struggle session and a morality play, though with meticulously crafted theatricality.Page 51 → As Chapter 3 elaborates, organizers took pains to ensure that these sessions were neither too spontaneous nor too structured so as to maintain the audience’s interest and the Party’s control over the ensuing violence.\n\nSome of the techniques of violence used during struggle sessions were taken from the peasantry’s own contentious repertoire. Mao observed that, in carrying out terror against the landed elite, peasants “tie up the gentry with ropes, put tall paper-hats on them, and parade them through villages.”57 In the public executions during the Red Terror at Peng Pai’s Hai-Lu-Feng Soviet in Guangdong Province, the peasants proactively pushed for theatrical forms of violence, some of which mimicked past state violence used against the local communities. These events became “festival[s] not to be missed which many peasants attended, making themselves hoarse with shouts of ‘kill, kill, kill.’” The peasants went so far as to use ritualized cannibalism to punish targets, mimicking the cruel local magistrate’s practice of forcing family members, often father-son and brother-brother pairs, to eat parts of the victim while he still lived.58"
