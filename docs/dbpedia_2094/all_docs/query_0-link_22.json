However, the absence of several luminaries of the Communist world, MAC) Tse-tung, Ho Chi Minh, and Fidel Castro, and of representatives of several Communist parties such as those of Holland and the non-bloc countries of the Far East except Australia, detracted from this impression of massive unity. The big question in the Communist movement, that of an inter- national Communist conference, was apparently still not definitively resolved during the Moscow celebrations, although several leaders did suggest publicly a meeting, or preparatory meeting, in 1968 and, according to one clandestine source, delegations from 17 or 18 parties will foregather in Budapest possibly late this year-or early next. The prospect of such.a meeting remains.a very corrosive issue in'the' 50X1-HUM Communist movement, for the reasons discussed in the enclosed note on Principal Developments in World Communist Affairs. 2 o roe r r Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2 :SECRET Cubans Sponsor Cultural Congress. The forthcoming Havana Cultural Con- gress, scheduled for 4-11 January 1968, is being touted by the Cuban Government as being as important as the TriContinental Conference of 1966 and the LASO meeting held in summer 1967. About 2000 invitations are said to have been issued to artists, writers and scientists from Asia, Africa and Latin America. Well known leftists such as Alfara Siquieros, Jean Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and others are expected to attend. It is doubtful that the Congress will live up to the grand- iose claims of the Cubans but it undoubtedly indicates the Cuban Govern- ment's intention to extend its subversive operations in the cultural field. As we have little evidence to substantiate the inflated announce- ments from Havana we do not wish to give undue attention to the conference. Rather, the field should be alert to the potential for trouble-making within the Communist parties and fronts which this event may create. (Attached are a news article giving further details on the Congress .and excerpts from a statement issued by a preparatory seminar in Havana which concluded, among other things, that \"The cultural event par excellence is revolution.\") Recall of Peking's Ambassadors. In December 1966 Peking had 47 diplo- matic establishments abroad of which 42 were embassies headed by full- fledged ambassadors. Today, Peking has two embassies headed by ambas- sadors -- those in the UAR and Albania -- and at this writing the ambas- sador to Albania is not at his post. In addition to the ambassadors, almost 1,000 other Chinese officials have been recalled for reasons never explained to the outside world. Today at least 40 of Peking's embassies are headed by charges, first or second secretaries, or even lower ranking officers. It appears the Cultural Revolution has claimed another victim. Before MAO Tse-tung completely destroys what remains of his foreign service, perhaps he would do well to reflect on the value of an experiment which, in a single year, has made shambles of an entire diplomatic corps. businessmen sang East is Red .

New Communist Front Group in Africa and Asia. Since early this year the Soviet Union and its Bloc allies have been quietly building up a corps of young people who are trained and dispatched abroad ostensibly \"to aid\" developing countries. According to the attached news article, they are actually selected and trained by the KGB and Bloc intelligence services for espionage and, when they arrive at their posts abroad, their activi- ties are supervised by local Soviet and Bloc intelligence agents. The youth corps, with headquarters in Budapest, has been named \"The Inter- national Youth Service of Solidarity and Friendship.\" Young people, male or female, go abroad as teachers, nurses, and as specialists in various fields -- mainly to Afro-Asian countries -- where they'are accepted as genuine volunteers. According to a recent article in Prague's RUDE PRAVO, one thousand such \"volunteers\"-'have already been sent out and plans call for a total of 2,500 by the end of this year. Hanoi's Problems with Elongated Supply Lines. North Vietnam's recruit ing in South Vietnam is down from some 7,000. new soldiers a month-to- around 3,500 today -- and still declining. As a\"result, Hanoi has been forced to send more PAVN (Peoples' Army of Vietnam) units south to fill out the ranks of what Hanoi persists in calling \"an indigenous guerrilla force\". North Vietnamese soldiers now fighting in. the south total over 100,000, more than half of the Communist fighting forces in Vietnam. Getting supplies to these men is becoming increasingly difficult for Hanoi because the Allies are gradually gaining control of the rice-growing regions in South Vietnam, and Allied bombing of supply routes from North to South Vietnam has seriously interfered with the southward movement of food, clothing and military supplies. In fact, there seems little doubt that one of the major reasons for the Viet Cong proposal for three holiday truces (3 days each at Christmas and New Year and 7 days over the Vietna- mese New Year - Tet) is to give Hanoi a breather during which she can get more materiel into the supply channels for her soldiers fighting in South Vietnam. 4 SECRET Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2 FOR BACKGROUND USE ONLY Principal Developments:' in World Communist Affairs (18 October to 16 November 1967) 1. The Soviets' celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Bolshe- vik Revolution was a milestone in the development of Communism in that country and a major event for the entire Communist camp. Its effect on a prospective world Communist conference and on Soviet-Cuban relations are discussed in separate paragraphs below. Other notable aspects of the Moscow celebrations include: a. The clear ascendanc3 not Leonid Brezhnev over the other two members of the Brezhnev-Kosygin-Podgorny troika. It was he who dedicated the new Lenin statue in the Kremlin, made the major addresses in Moscow 3_1 November and Leningrad on 5 November, and acted as principal host and speaker at the Kremlin reception.. He received deferential treatment in speeches by all the republic first secretaries -- some so extravagantly personally laudatory they were not carried subsequently in the central press. Even Marshal Grechko. pointedly toasted \"the Central Committee, CPSU, the.Polit- buro, and the General Secretary of the Central Committee Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev.\" Minimal attention was given by. speakers to \"collective leadership.\" While Brezhnev pledged continuation and strengthening of this principle once briefly and in passing, no other speaker touched this point. b. As was to be expected, the speakers conscientiously white- washed the Soviet past. Brezhnev's keynote address dwelled almost exclusively on the positive achievements of the Soviet system. Lenin bulked large in his account but Stalin and Khrushchev remained =named; moreover, no reference is even made. to the \"cult of the personality\" or \"subjectivism\" -- the terms normally used to des- cribe their reigns. c. The vast assemblage of foreign party dignitaries served to underscore the portrayal of the event by Moscow as a massive, unified display of the Communist movement rallying to the support of the USSR and the.CPSU. Podgorny's speech at the opening of the 3 November gathering greeted by name 74+ \"Marxist-Leninist\" delega- tions and 25 \"progressive\" groups, representing a total of 95 countries. PRAVDA and?IZVESTIYA carried articles by top party leaders from all the bloc countries represented at the celebration except Cuba and North Korea. d. However there were absences and flaws which served to underscore certain gaps in this \"massive unity.\" Apart from China and Albania, whom.nobody.expected anyway, the Dutch Communist. Party was not represented nor were any non-bloc Communist Parties from the Far East except Australia's. Japan was represented by the Socialist Party of Japan and not by the Japanese Communist Party. The North Korean delegation was led by the head of state, while Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2 other bloc delegations except Cuba's, were led by their party leaders. Cuba was represent~rd neither by its party leader nor government chief, but. by its ? Minister of. Health. e. Even some of those who did attend did so with misgivings. Yugoslavia, for'example, was wary of possible efforts to take advant- age of the presence of these Communist.-leaders by the Soviets to convene some sort of rump conference of Communist and workers' parties. Several articles in the Yugoslav press also disparaged Moscow's efforts to press its position as \"first among eciual$\"'and even hinted that perhaps the Soviets might learn a bit from the Yugoslav example. President Tito was reportedly irritated with the Soviets for censoring an article he wrote before it was re- printed by PRAVDA, which deleted -- among other things -- critical references by Tito to the Comintern's policy toward Yugoslavia in the Stalinist period. f. A one-sentence greeting from the Chinese National People's Congress and the CPR State Council to the Supreme Soviet and the Soviet Council of Ministers pointedly igno:+d the CP SU and thus, by implication, demonstrated that the Chinese do not acknowledge a party-level relationship with the Soviets. The Chinese greeting was not included in a collection of messages printed by PRAVDA on 7 and 8 November. Conjointly the Chinese mounted an intensified propaganda campaign to denigrate the Soviet regime at the time of its jubilee celebrations. The campaign had two basic dimensions: to indict the Soviet leadership -- supported by a flood of attacks constituting a bill of particulars against the regime's policies -- for having betrayed the revolution and restored capitalism, and to claim that Mao Tse-tung is the supreme Marxist~Leninist mentor of the present era and Peking the capital of world revolu- tion. 2. Soviet-Cuban relations took a turn for the worse as a result of the Moscow anniversary celebrations. Although the leaders of other .ruling Communist parties (excepting North Korea, China, North Vietnam, and Albania) represented their countries in Moscow, Castro stayed in Havana, sending the Minister of Health, Jose R. Machado, instead. :Additionally, Castro failed to send an article in praise of the Soviet Union to be published in_-,PRAVDA along with those of everyone else except China and Albania; the Cuban Ambassador in Moscow failed to attend the 6 November reception for''chiefs of diplomatic missions given by Soviet President Podgorny; and Machado failed to make a congratuihtory address at the Kremlin celebration (it's not clear whether he refused to, or wasn't asked to). The world's press buzzed with rumors of s.Soviet-Cuban \"split\" as a result of these snubs, and almost universally failed to note that Castro, Dorticos and the entire leadership of Cuba turned up at th'e.Soviet Embassy's reception on 6 November and enjoyed themselves immensely. The press also paid little attention to the speech-by the Soviet charg6e d':affaires- in Havana who pledged his country's continued Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/29: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400050002-2 economic and military support to Cuba. Undoubtedly Castro's calculated snubs did irritate the Kremlin, but it is doubtful they will pack up and leave that tropical isle.just because Fidel didn't come to their party. 3. The question of. an eventual world Communist conference was ver1 much in the air in Moscow. Several luminaries, such as Czechoslovakia's Novotny and East Germany's Ulbricht,openly called fora meetin( in 1968. Agence France Presse on 8 November quoted \"foreign .ommunist sources\" in Moscow to the effect that there-is a growing. likelihood df an inter- national Communist conference being held in Budapest in the first quarter of 1968, but cites \"doubt\"''among these same sources as to whether this will be \"the big conference\" or merely a preparatory one. The sources are quoted as saying that a poll of world parties revealed \"a majority of 70\" in favor of a conference .- the figure used by V. Polyanskiy in. a talk broadcast by Radio Moscow .on 21 October. The Soviets' position in requesting a conference was-strengthened.by an article by Italian , Communist Party Secretary General Luigi Longo on 27 October in which 1e said that the rejection by the Chinese Communists of Soviet proposals for joint aid to Vietnam has led the Italian Party to abandon its past reserve on the need for a new international Communist conference \"to increase unity.\" As viewed by a Communist, the proposal is loaded with problems such as: In Europe such a conference would revive the danger of the Red peril, evoking the ghosts of the Comintern and the Cominform, pro- viding material for all the anti-Communists and disrupting the advances already made toward unity with the Social Democrats in many countries. In many countries of Africa and the Middle East the Communist parties are insignificant and the leading revolutionary parties are not Commu- nist; thus the conference would not even be representative of the revolutionary movement in those areas. In certain areas in Latin America the revolutionary movement is div'ded between two or more contenders; choosing only the Communist Party could thus overlook a major part of the revolutionary forces. .In the Far East the problem of Vietnam would provoke a major crisis by forcing the North Vietnamese to choose, against their will, between Moscow and Peking -- a choice. which might be fatal either way. Furthermore., pre-empting the pro-North Vietnam position would risk alienating many other supporters of-that country who. have no desire only to follow a Communist lead.. Finally, although some parties seem to believe the conference could be held without discussing the role .of Communist China in the international Communist movement., this seems absurdly unlikely; on the other hand discussing Communist China would irremediably solidify the. schism in the.Communist world.

I And the Japanese leader's conversations with sources hav- ing closer contacts with the North Vietnamese, notably in Burma and Laos, were believed to have added somewhat to his insight into the thinking of Hanoi. It was considered more sig 1nificant, in the long view, that, Mr. Sato appeared on the scene at a crucial moment in the po litical maturing of Bunna, Singapore and Indonesia. Some` Japanese authorities thought it a fortunate coincidence that the leader of one of the world's most successful free-enterprise systems appeared when the three nations were at a peak of disenchantment with the Social- ist experiment embodied in, Communist China. 20 October 1967 - Support From Down Under, Australia's External Affairs Min- aster, Paul Hasluck, made a statement, to the U.N.

This view also explains. the Australian Government's continuing strong support for the United States bombing policy.

Since no new forces have been committed elsewhere, the Holt government appears to be relying on increasing the national draft if more forces are needed outside Vietnam. In Australia's present \"forward defense\". planning, the aim is to build up troop 'strength until a full division can be deployed overseas at any time. But just how the ',present limited draft policy would be shaped ,to this end remains to be seen. Draft expansion issue? In his latest troop increase, Mr. Holt has set the stage politically for a new draft ex. pansion. Next anonth the Australian Govern. anent will face the Senate elections. And its new Vietnam troop increase has ensured these will develop into \"khaki campaign.\" Vietnam will be the central issue. And-a: government victory could be interpreted fairly by Mr. Holt as public support for any 'required draft expansion. Most Australians realize that their coup ,try's stand in Vietnam is as much for them as it is for the South Vietnamese people. The stress which the Australian Government places in this context on the aggressiveness of.-Communist China means that in Austra- lian official eyes the Vietnam war is a delay- ing action. Accordingly, any . acceptable solutions which the Chinese people themselves may produce in the face of the problems imposed on them by the Peking Communist regime will be of great importance to Australia. Equally important is the increase in power and strength.of the free peoples of Southeast Asia.

Shao-chi and. anti-', 'Maoists in the struggle in China` .proper. In the Indian Government refugee camps at Ilijnor and Pilib- !hit it re 500 Tibetans, who, ,crossed the snowbound bor-i der passes after the thaw' in June. They describe the Red Guard reign of terror, humilia- tion of lamas and a fanatical cam- paign to wipe out the last traces of religion in the country. A strict ban has been placed on worship, any form of owner- ship, and contact with traditions. The cultural revolution and Red Guards made themselves felt in western Tibet only in February this year. With the formation of lied Guards struggle meetings have hccn called in villages. monasteries razed to the ground and ancient Lamai%t scriptures burnt. The Red Guards, recruited from the poorest sections of the community by the Chinese and 'Tibetan officials, forced villagers to shave the traditionally Jong- plaited hair, wear Chinese clothes, and emitlate chairman Mao. But Peking appears to have underestimated the strong rcligi. OUS tics that still exist in Tibet after 14 years of Chinese rule. Under the forceful direction of Tibetan Red Guards-the Gening Rrrknch-villagers submitted, de- stroyed their monasteries, accepted Mao's little red book, and then, overnight, slipped away under Peking s nose. Waiting for the snows to thaw, they_ crossed into India in -their_ hundreds bringing with themlamas, hidden scriptures, sacred objects, and cattle. Relative peace This largest exodus out of Tibet since 1962 indicates that the western borders arc not well patrolled by the Chinese, contrary to what had been believed. o spontaneous antagonism developed by the cultural revolution can be ,seen in the numbers attempting to cross the border, when it is realized ,that only 35 Tibetans had previ- ously defected in this area since 11962. Contrary to past reports, the !western Tibetans say that until February this year they have been. left in relative peace. One of the leaders of the mass exodus, ; ;Chhamba Dhawa, unaware that he. had been experiencing the cultural' revolution, said until February' the Chinese had not intcrtcred with worship or rites. \" When they first came they said they were going to change the country into a place ;like Russia. We would be able to ilvorship but there would be demo- cratic changes. \"Nothing . happened until' February this year. when we saw the Chinese forming groups of people from the poorest acctions.' of the community in all the Villages. At the head of the group the Chinese placed Tibetan people who worked .in their offices. They all wore red arm bands. \" At the end of the month they called all heads of families to the district headquarters and said that the old ways were not the thoughts of chairman Mao. We were told that the Dalai Lama was reaction- ary and that old things must be destroyed. Chinese officers were at these meetings but (hey did not take part. We were told that we had not understood the thoughts of chairman Mao and the only true followers were the poorer people who had formed the new group called Genlog Rukach. \" We were told things were now' going to change. All worship must stop and monasteries and scrip- tures were to be burnt. Men were told to dress like Mao Tse-tung and shave their long hair. \" To be pure according to chair- man Mao's thoughts, one should not possess anything and even those who owned two head of cattle were capitalists \".

The refugees also report they. noticed a change in the Tibetan: communist 'hierarchy. Officials were demoted and replaced by people of lower status. A 70-year-old monk, Niyang Lama, tells a similar story: \" Until' April we had been allowed to worship and have our monasteries.

TINES 27 September 1967 Dalai Lama Comes to Japan The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan leader since 1959 in exile In India, arrived in Tokyo on Monday night for a two=week visit to Japan. Sometimes referred to as the \"god-king,\" the Dalai Lama Is regarded by most Tibetans as their lawful ruler; be is, also the head of the Lamaist form of the Buddhist religion which Is found mainly in Tibet. He was invited to Japan by the Buddhist Missionary Association In Tokyo, and the Japanese Government agreed to his visit here en condition that he did not engage in any political activities while in Japan. The Dalai Lama has, of course, no religious jurisdiction; over Japanese Buddhists, and the form of Buddhism 'he', professes is considerably different from those forms current, In Japan. Nevertheless, he is honored as a devout and, courageous Buddhist and also as the representative of a. country which has suffered a cruel fate at the hands of Chinese Communists. So severe has been, and still is, this persecution that. Red China has been' freely accused in various quarters o' the; crime of genocide. This visit to Japan is the Dalai Lama's first visit abroad since he fled from his homeland eight years ago, and he is expected on his return journey to India to stop for a few (lays in Bangkok, another Buddhist center-this time of - the Hinayana faith. While his trip is not intended to have any political significance, as he was once endowed with' sovereign powers and has suffered much anguish on behalf, of his unfortunate country, his visit is bound to excite' interest and sympathy. The severity of the Peking Government's treatment of the Tibetan people appears to have been mainly promoted; by the ordinary Communist zest for destruction, but, the. fact that their land was largely undeveloped, yet contained underground mineral wealth, was undoubtedly a factor.: Recent reports indicate, too, that despite the harshness of the climate and the high elevation of much of the country, the Chinese Communists have been pouring in colonists of their own race to take the place of the native Tibetans.. This process is said to have had a good deal of success although the Chinese do not take readily to the climatic conditions of Tibet. One political consequence of the flight of the Dalal Lama and the sinicization of Tibet has been increased friction between India and Red China. Last March, the Foreign Ministry in Peking formally accused the Indian Government of permitting the Dalai Lama to set up a government-in-exile in India. The Peking note described the Tibetan leader as a \"traitor.\" It declared that India had given shelter to \"elements of the traitorous Dalai clique and a large number of traitor bandits, and openly helped them to establish in India a so-called govern- ment-in-exile and to publish a so-called Tibetan Constitu- It even accused India of giving Tibetan refugees \"mill- tary training\" while referring to'the \"new Tibet\" as becom- ing a \"joyful land of socialism.\" India, of course, has consistently pointed out that it does not permit Tibetans In India (including the Dalai Lama himself) to participate in anti-Chinese activities. The Indian motive obviously has been humanitarian in character. Tibetans, persecuted in their homeland by the Chinese Communists, and fortunate enough to get away, have per- forcq. had to find new homes, and India, the nearest free country, could have hardly refused them a refuge. Some Tibetans have, of course, proved able to escape to Europe, and a number have found refuge in Switzerland in, areas which are somewhat reminiscent of their own mountain land. Not only have the Tibetan people received cruel treat- ment but it appears that many monasteries have been ruth. lessly plundered and their cultural treasures dissipated. The actual rulers in Tibet appear to be the Chinese military' who take scant care respecting anybody's rights and act in an arbitrary fashion. Earlier this year, the Tibet Garrison of the \"People's Liberation Army\" issued a direc- tive saying that anyone opposing the Army takeover would be regarded as a \"counter-revolutionary and dealt with accordingly.\" Red Chinese, actions in Tibet reveal, if nothing else does, the true nature of a type of communism which will stop at nothing to gain its ignoble ends. Its pretence to be con- cerned with the welfare 'of the masses is only valid within its own narrow Ideology, and even excites criticism from nations that have accepted the main principles of socialism.

Whether Com- munist China. has the right to occupy Tibet and rule the' three million Tibetans Is one aspect of the problem. And whether it is right for the Chinese Communists to destroy, Tibetan. culture and erase the identity of the Tibetan people Is another. The Tibetans became Identified as a nation in the seventh c century when a number of ferocious Himalayan tribes united under the leadership of a strong chieftain. The1 united tribes defeated China and imposed humiliating terms, but in the process acquired Buddhism, which, while: keeping the tribes united, pacified them. Eventually, the Buddhism became Lamaism, and Tibet' became a theocratic state. The Grand Lama-or Dalai Lama, as he finally was called-headed ? the nation and, maintained a \"spiritual temporal\" relation with China., After some centuries, the Chinese came to look upon Tibet; as a vassal state which they had generously permitted, self-government. Early In this century, the British were the dominating' Influence in that part of the world. The Tibetans, exasper- ated at the Chinese attitude, had succeeded in ejecting even the pretence -of 'any Chinese authority over their affairs. In niid-1914, a meeting between Tibet, China and Britain was held in Simla, India, for the purpose of establishing Tibet's borders. The border between India and Tibet was easily agreed upon, but the Chinese would not accept the Article II of the Convention described Tibet as being \"under the suzerainty, of China.\" This recognized a tradij son rather than any legal or de facto relationship. More- over', \"suzerainty\" was not to he confused with' \"saver.. ,rignty.\" It meant, in effect, that China was to remain Tibet's protector and as such was permitted a strong` voice in Tibet's foreign relations. It did not mean that.' China had any voice whatever in Tibet's internal affairs. In addition, the same Article II of the Convention speet ;led that, the Chinese were \"not to convert Tibet into a, f' in(?in s Pakistan.--UNt. Peking Radio assails Dalai Lama NT 7W DELHI.

In October 1950, In a sneak attack, 40,000 Chinese Com= munist troops crossed Tibet's eastern borders and engaged .the tiny Tibetan army. The Tibetans fought bravely, but were overwhelmed.

Moreover, even the imperialistic\" British had recognized China's suzerainty over Tibet, and this was now conveniently interpreted as \"sover- eignty.\" Since ?then, whenever the Tibetan issue has risen in world affairs, the Communists) indulge in legalistic hair- splitting over \"suzerainty\", and \"sovereignty,\" and they reinvoke the immorality of. British imperialism until the issue is drowned in a verbal deluge. Meanwhile, the best land of the three million Tibetans' has been confiscated and given to Chinese settlers. Their religious practices are suppressed, and their religious establishments are being methodically destroyed. Their. art, literature, folkways, traditions and even their language are being obliterated. Forced labor is the fate of tens of thousands of Tibetans. Public torture Is a common method of enforcing Peking's authority. Since 1959, more. than 90,000 Tibetans have been killed in the Chinese attempts to put down Tibetan resistance and uprisings. Many more than this number have died of starvation. No matter how the word \"'genocide\" is defined, the evidence is overwhelming that the Chinese Communists are guilty of it. In early 1959, the present Dalai Lama escaped from Lhassa to India. He made the dangerous journey in order to tell the world what was happening in his country and to seek help. for his peopId.

Chia( F-o i't LC'S(ntative pointed out th:,t on September 26 Dalai presided over the opening ceremony of a so-called \"Tibetan Trea\"ures Ex- hibition\" in Tokyo sponsored by Yomiuri Shimbun. On the map hung in the exhibition hall and in the pamphlets sold there, Tibet was de- lineated as a separate \"country,\" and \"Tibetan masses\" and the nationals of Japan and India were lumped together as \"civilians of the three countries.\" This was a vain and crude attempt at interfering in China's internal affairs and splitting China's sacred territory, as well as an open political provocation against China. Besides NIatsutaro Shoriki, director of Yoiniuri Shimbun, offi- cials of the U.S. Embassy in Japan and the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Indian Charge d'Affaires in Japan also took part in this sinister activity. \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" Correspond- ent in Peking Disqualified The representative of the Liao Cheng-chih Office of China called in the representative of the Tatsunosuke Takasaki Office of Japan in Peking on October 12. He severely de- nounced the responsible members of the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun for following the orders of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in the anti-China campaign and making arrangements, together with the Japanese Association for Preaching Buddhism, for China's arch Tibetan traitor Dalai to travel from India to Japan on September 25 to carry out criminal anti-China activities. He informed the Japanese representative that he was authorized to announce the cancellation of the right of Yomiuri Shimbun, as of that day, to accredit a correspondent to Peking. It is reported that after his stay in Tokyo Dalai also went to Kyoto and other places for sinister activities. Patriot, 1'l eta i?olhi 4 Ocf. 196'7 The Chinese representative pointed out that it was an undeniable fact that the responsible members of Yontittri Shirnbun had arranged Dalai's trip to Japan for anti-China activities. It was new evidence that the reactionary Japanese Govern- nnent'was following U.S. imperialism and collaborating with the Indian reactionaries in pressing ahead with its anti-China policy. It was also a big exposure of the ugly features of the responsible members of Yomiuri Sliintbun as pawns of the reactionary Sato government in opposing China. The representative pointed out that the vicious political aim of these. manoeuvres was particularly evident since they occurred at a time when Sato. had just concluded his \"visit\" to Taiwan and was on his anti-China mission to some Southeast Asian countries and regions, and when the General Assembly of the United Nations, a tool of the United States, was in session.

Vienna. The case of the accredited Soviet Attache in Vienna, M.A.S. Anasov, has created a sensation with the Austrian public. As reported, the diplomat, a member of the Soviet civilian intelligence service, attempted to bribe a Vienna municipal official and was caught in the act. How Anasov proceeded to reach his objective has now become known in detail. The attache approached the municipal official at a chess club, located in'a coffee house in the Seventh District. The municipal official is a mem- ber of this chess board -- a coincidence which the diplomat had cleverly controlled. In order to_ secure the good will of the official, he [the dip- lomat] surprised him first with small gifts; sometimes the gifts were theater tickets and at other times books. That was last year. In the spring of 1967, Anasov let his real intentions show through for the first time. He first carefully questioned the official, who worked in Municipal Depart- ment 61 for Citizenship Matters, about his type of work and one day he openly stated what he wanted. There are two versions about this: Vienna City Hall officials surmise that the content of specific citizenship records: other sources believe that he intended to get his victim to make false file cards and to smuggle. them into the records. This would have made it possible for the Soviet Intelligence Service to supply an agent with Au,trian documents. The agent would not have to had to do anything buc apply for a proof of citizenship record, which would have most probably been issued to him on the basis of the false material inserted in the files. There are also two interpretations about what happened after Anasov made his proposal to the municipal official. While it is explained in the City Council that the offic.ia1 became suspicious when this chess partner suddenly went beyond his cus6omary attentiveness and attempted to press money on him -- a fact the official immediately reported to his superiors -- other sourceb claim the official took the money. A total of about 4,000 shillings was reportedly involved. The official is said to have last his nerve at the last moment and reported the matter. He informed the City Council, which reported the matter to the state police.
