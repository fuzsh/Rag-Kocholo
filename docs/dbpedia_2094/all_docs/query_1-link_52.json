        "text": "Hoping to make a playoff push in the second half of the High Class A Midwest League season, the Quad Cities River Bandits need to win games that feature a playoff feel.\n\nThat was exactly the case Wednesday evening at Modern Woodmen Park as the Bandits manufactured two runs in their final three at-bats to pull out a 2-1 victory over league-leading Wisconsin in front of 2,417 fans.\n\nQC scored the winning run in the eighth when Carson Roccaforte tripled off the wall in right field with one out and came in on Justin Johnson’s looping liner over a drawn-in infield.\n\nThat gave the Bandits (49-54) their second straight victory in the set with the Milwaukee Brewers' affiliate and evened their second-half Western Division record at 19-19.\n\nIt was also manager Brooks Conrad’s 299th victory as a manager in the Kansas City Royals organization. It is his third year with QC and seventh overall in the organization.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a playoff push, so every win is important,” Johnson said after his 2-for-4, one-RBI night. “You try to win every night and hope to stack enough together that you’re in the playoff picture at the end of the year.”\n\nBeating the top team in the league helps in that regard in a bunched Western Division race. QC had won just four of the first 12 games this season against the Timber Rattlers (65-38, 23-14 this half).\n\nJohnson did his part, coming through against losing pitcher Aiden Maldonado (0-2). He took advantage of a drawn-in infield to score Roccaforte, who drove in QC’s first run in the sixth with an RBI fielder’s choice.\n\n“The infield’s in, less than two outs, I’m just trying to look up in the zone and get something above the infielders and get that run in,” said Johnson, who did just that as he moved his on-base streak to seven games. “I didn’t come through earlier in the game with runners in scoring position, so I really wanted to get the job done for the team there.”\n\n“Huge hit for him just trying to get the barrel to something and get the ball to the outfield and keep the ball off the ground at all costs in that situation,” Conrad said of Johnson’s key hit. “It was a really good situational-hitting job by him there.”\n\nConrad loved the fact that his squad kept battling and played clean baseball in getting the victory.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“They’re showing a lot of fight and a lot of fire right now,” Conrad said. “They’re doing what I ask of them — competing until the last out is made every night.”\n\nOnce again, the Bandits got good pitching from starter Henry Williams through closer Ben Sears. In between, Connor Fenlong and newcomer Andrew Morones did their jobs in holding the Timber Rattlers in check. The explosive Rattlers were limited to four hits by the four QC hurlers.\n\n“The pitching has been outstanding,” said Conrad.\n\nSears (2-3) picked up the victory, pitching the final two innings of hitless ball as he struck out three.\n\nWilliams gave up all four Timber Rattlers hits in his 4 1/3 innings of work and the lone run as he walked three and whiffed three.\n\nFenlong (two strikeouts) followed with 1 2/3 innings of hitless relief, followed by Morones, who walked two but pitched a scoreless seventh inning.\n\nQC scored the tying run in the sixth inning.\n\nLeadoff batter Dustin Dickerson got the rally started with a solid single up the middle. With one out, Jac Caglianone, Kansas City’s top draft pick this year, ripped a single to right that had a 110 MPH exit velocity to put runners on first and second. He finished 1-for-3 and nearly took off shortstop Cooper Pratt's head with a laser of a liner to end the seventh with the bases loaded.\n\nTrevor Werner then drew a walk to load the bases.\n\nNo. 5 batter Roccaforte then ripped a grounder to the second baseman that wiped out Werner at second, but he beat the relay throw as Dickerson scored to knot the score at 1.\n\nWisconsin scored the first run of the game in the second off Williams. No. 5 Wisconsin batter Matt Wood singled, moved up on a groundout and scored on Tayden Hall’s RBI single.\n\nThis week’s six-game series is scheduled to continue on Thursday at MWP. QC will send right-hander Ethan Bosacker (3-1, 1.69 ERA) to the hill for the start opposite Wisconsin lefty Brian Fitzpatrick (4-1, 2.83 ERA).\n\n+1\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nTom Johnston\n\nsports writer/golf editor\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
