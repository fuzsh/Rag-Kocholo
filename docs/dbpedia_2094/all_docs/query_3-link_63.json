        "text": "In October 1949, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) claimed control of China and declared the formation of a new republic. China was not easily conquered, however, and not everyone welcomed its new rulers. The new regime faced plenty of opposition from several different corners: defeated Nationalist soldiers, former backers of the Guomindang, landlords and capitalist businessmen, political moderates and democrats, warlords and provincial leaders, ethnic minorities, Christians and foreigners. For Mao and the CCP, the 1950s became a critical decade for identifying and suppressing opposition and resistance. It began with ‘Speaking Bitterness‘ against rural landlords and ended with Mao’s attacks against critics and dissenters at the Lushan plenum in 1959. In between, the communists launched several campaigns to suppress their perceived enemies.\n\nThe significant action was the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign (or zhen fan). It was launched in March 1950, six months after the formation of the People’s Republic. As the name suggests, this campaign sought to identify and wipe out remaining opposition to the CCP, including remnants of the Nationalist army and supporters of the Guomindang. The suppression campaign was focused mainly on southern and eastern cities, where citizens had little experience of the communists and no reason to support them. The campaign began with the introduction of martial law in Chongqing, Sichuan province. Chongqing had served as Jiang Jieshi’s capital during World War II. Because of this it housed many former Nationalists, soldiers and officials. By the end of 1949 some of them had formed an insurgency and were attempting to sabotage CCP control of Chongqing by encouraging strikes and lawlessness. Party commanders in the city responded by seizing weapons, jailing 7,400 former Nationalists and executing 361 insurgents. By the end of 1950 order had been restored in Chonqqing.\n\nDrawing on the successes in Chongqing, Mao Zedong ordered the suppression campaign be extended to other cities. Mao urged CCP cadres to be less brutal than in Chongqing; he believed the skills and cooperation of industrialists, business owners and the urban middle classes were still needed. Rather than using coercion, Mao bombarded the cities with propaganda, urging their citizens to reject counter-revolutionary groups and ideas. Former Nationalists were demonised, depicted as ghoulish, fedora-wearing conmen, eager to steal and exploit. The CCP government also banned dozens of political, religious and semi-religious organisations, including the Guomindang, Christian churches, Buddhist temples, Shanghai’s Green Gang and folk religions like Tongshanshe and Yiguandao. The leaders of these groups were exiled, imprisoned or executed. The government also formed the People’s Tribunals in July 1950. Though ostensibly created to assist with land reform, the Tribunals also had the authority to deal with “despots, native bandits, special agents, counter-revolutionaries and criminals”, as well as those who “plot sabotage activities and undermine social security”.\n\nAfter its relatively lukewarm start, the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaign escalated quickly at the end of 1951. This escalation was driven by CCP cadres, government propaganda and popular action. One of the features of the Suppression campaign in 1951 were huge mass meetings, held in public spaces or stadiums and attended by thousands of people. These meetings were urban versions of ‘Speak Bitterness’, though they tended to be deadlier for those who stood accused. Suspects were paraded, accused of counter-revolutionary activities or sympathies, intimidated into self criticism then subject to humiliation, beatings or execution. At some mass meetings more than 200 people were shot. According to Mao, 700,000 “class enemies” were executed during the Suppression campaign. Some historians consider this an underestimation. According to human rights activist Zhou Jingwen, around half a million people committed suicide, driven by shame, humiliation or coercion. More than one million people were also imprisoned or held in forced labour camps. The Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaign was slowed in 1952 and eventually halted in July 1953.\n\nAs well as eliminating external threats, the CCP also moved against problems inside the party. In autumn 1951 party leader Gao Gang launched a campaign against ‘bureaucratism’ in the northern province of Manchuria. Gao alleged that many CCP cadres were heavily involved in corruption, embezzlement and graft, so were stealing large amounts of money from the state. Gao filed a report with Mao Zedong, who later blamed this internal corruption on the “sugar coated bullets” of the bourgeoisie. In November 1951 Mao formally launched the Three Antis campaign (san fan). Its purpose was to eradicate three specific ‘evils’: corruption, waste and bureaucracy. Its main targets were members of the CCP, particularly urban officials who had direct contact with financial and business interests, and so were susceptible to corruption. “Cleanse away the filth and poison left over in our country from the old society”, Mao urged his followers. Cadres were encouraged to identify and criticise CCP officials who had taken bribes, shown leniency or favouritism towards business interests, or were deriving excessive benefit from their position. Corrupt party members were dubbed “tigers” and the groups who sought them were “tiger-hunting teams”.\n\nThe Three Antis came to an end in October 1952 but not before it had claimed some prominent victims. In November 1951 Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, high ranking CCP secretaries in the northern prefecture of Tianjin, were arrested with Mao’s approval. Liu and Zhang were accused of embezzling state funds (the amounts reported vary between 1.7 million and 1.5 billion yuan) that was set aside for flood mitigation, ship building and the construction of an airport. They were also accused of conspiring with wealthy businessmen to inflate the cost of state contracts. In addition, Liu and Zhang were indicted for living an extravagant bourgeois lifestyle, rather than lives of communist austerity. The strength of the case against them was uncertain, nevertheless they were found guilty and executed in February 1952. Their treatment was held up as an example to other party members who stole from the state or took bribes and backhanders.\n\n“The campaigns created an unprecedented political storm against the bourgeoisie. Under extreme political heat, entrepreneurs moved quickly, if reluctantly, to comply. Noncompliance meant humiliation, trial and even betrayal by their own families. Most private entrepreneurs were found guilty, one way or another. The timing of the Three and Five Antis campaigns revealed the growing impatience of the new regime…”\n\nXiaobing Li\n\nA second campaign, the Five Antis (or wu fan), was launched in early 1952, almost concurrently with san fan. The five ‘evils’ nominated by Mao were bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cheating on government contracts and stealing economic information. This time, the targets were businessmen and capitalists. Corruption, Mao argued, was a product of capitalism and the greed it nurtured, so the answer was to target capitalists. Many corrupt capitalists had already been identified during the Three Antis (the two campaigns were closely connected). Five Antis cadres sought the help of ordinary people, enlisting thousands of spies and informants to monitor suspect individuals and businesses. State rhetoric and propaganda encouraged clerks and workers to inform the government of suspicious activity.\n\nThe Five Antis campaign had a profound effect on Chinese business. The campaign’s culture of secret denunciations saw many business owners falsely accused, by rivals or cadres. By 1953 around 450,000 private businesses had been charged with one of the ‘five evils’; around 340,000 were found guilty. Thousands more were intimidated or terrorised into liquidating their business or surrendering it to the state. Some were dragged to public meetings and subjected to accusations and humiliation, before being fined and having their businesses seized. Many committed suicide after losing their property and livelihood. The Five Antis not only enriched the coffers of the government, it contributed to an intensifying climate of fear, particularly among capitalists and small businessmen. According to a reporter in Hong Kong in 1951, “those who come out of communist China with an astonishing unanimity refer to… this constant haunting fear… The arms of the party are far reaching. They extend… to each individual and affect the words and thoughts of all.”\n\n1. When Mao Zedong and the CCP seized control of China in October 1949 they faced considerable opposition and resistance from former Nationalists and others.\n\n2. The CCP’s first response was the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaign, launched in 1950, which sought to identify and eliminate opposition, particularly in the cities.\n\n3. Launched in 1951, the Three Antis campaign targeted corruption, waste and ‘bureaucratism’ among party officials. It was followed by the Five Antis campaign in early 1952, which targeted corrupt capitalists and businessmen.\n\n4. These campaigns were driven by government propaganda, CCP cadres and urban mass meetings, where suspected persons were subject o self criticism, accusation and humiliation.\n\n5. The death toll from these campaigns is unknown but is probably close to one million people. Together these campaigns generated a climate of fear, forcing those who disagreed with CCP policies into compliance and obedience.\n\n© Alpha History 2018-23.

On October 1st Mao Zedong addressed a mass rally in Beijing, where he declared victory in the Civil War and the birth of a new nation: the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In his speech, Mao hinted at the organisation of his government. He declared the formation of a new political congress containing “all the democratic parties and people’s organisations of China, the People’s Liberation Army [and] the various regions and nationalities of the country”. This new body, Mao promised, would “represent the will of the people”. In the five years that followed, Mao and his cohort developed a new political system based on a constitution, a representative legislature and a court system. This new system, despite its theoretical promise, came to represent the will of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rather than the “will of the people”.\n\nLike the National Assembly in France (1789) and the Bolsheviks in Russia (1917), the new government in China faced a raft of problems and challenges. China had been ravaged and exhausted by decades of warlordism, Japanese imperialism, war and civil war. Around one third of China’s critical infrastructure – roads, railways and bridges – had suffered destruction or severe damage. The economy had almost collapsed after years of civil war and Nationalist corruption and mismanagement. Production had slumped to pre-1911 levels and the national currency was almost worthless, forcing millions to resort to bartering. Post-war China was beset by social problems like malnutrition, disease, homelessness, refugees and illiteracy. And while the CCP enjoyed considerable support from the peasantry, it also faced ongoing resistance and opposition from former Nationalists, capitalists, the industrial and business sectors and foreign powers.\n\n“The Chinese Communist Party was saddled with a gargantuan task: its legitimacy as a regime would rest, like that of its predecessors, on making good its claim to rule all China. Never mind that the population was rapidly doubling and by 1980 would total a billion people. Never mind that the rather new province of Taiwan was 100 miles overseas in rival hands, protected by a hostile naval power… Fortunately for the CCP, the modern development of transport and communications, of firepower and police networks, had given the new government of the People’s Republic various means to control the Chinese state and, for a time, the society. Most important and necessary as a means of control, these material facilities [also developed] a new view of the world.”\n\nRoderick MacFarquhar, historian\n\nThe first challenge for Mao and the CCP was to create a framework for national government. They were not prepared for this, largely because the Nationalist collapse in 1949 had come more quickly than expected. The first step was the formation of a Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (PCC), which assembled for the first time in September 1949. The origins of the PCC date back to the October 1945 peace talks between Mao and Jiang Jieshi, when they agreed to form a multi-party congress to advise the Nationalist government. The PCC convened in September 1949 contained only delegates from parties considered friendly to the CCP, such as the left wing of the Guomindang, the China Democratic League and the National Salvation Association. The PCC’s early sessions produced a political manifesto, outlining the structure and policies of the new nation. Between 1949 and 1954 the PCC served as both China’s interim legislature and constitutional convention. While its membership was diverse, it remained dominated by delegates from the CCP.\n\nA more permanent political system was established in 1954, with the formation of the National People’s Congress (NPC). The NPC became China’s legislature or parliament, a status it still holds today. Under electoral guidelines laid out in 1953, the NPC was to be a representative body, with each delegate representing a province, municipality or the armed forces. Elections for the NPC were held in May 1954 and involved county, provincial and municipal assemblies. This complex three- or four-stage process meant that the NPC was only partially representative. In many areas, particularly rural areas were literacy and political awareness were low, voters were strongly influenced by CCP propaganda. When the NPC convened on September 15th 1954 it contained 1,226 delegates, 177 of whom were from ethnic minorities and 149 of whom were women. One of the NPC’s first acts was the unanimous election of Mao Zedong as president of the People’s Republic and Zhu De as his vice president. The NPC also adopted and passed the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China on September 20th. While the NPC was, in theory, China’s highest law-making body, it soon became a factory for rubber-stamping laws and policies put forward by the leaders of the CCP.\n\nThe People’s Republic’s new constitution was based on the Soviet Union constitution of 1936. China’s new constitution was comparatively brief, containing just a preamble and 106 articles. Though undoubtedly socialist in its aims, the constitution was quite moderate; it had a strong focus on national unity, democracy and representation, and the rights and equality of citizens. It was also written in a simple, clear fashion, intended to be accessible to ordinary people. Interestingly, the 1954 constitution was never meant to be permanent. Its drafters considered it a temporary constitution, a framework to begin China’s transition to socialism but not to define it. But China’s march into socialism came much sooner than expected, so the CCP hierarchy was soon considering constitutional reform. The actions against dissidents in the late 1950s, such as the Hundred Flowers and Anti-Rightist campaigns, actually breached sections of the constitution, a fact that Mao himself acknowledged. The Chairman did not care, however, suggesting that “parts of the constitution are obsolete”.\n\nSo, by the late 1950s China’s government was based on a toothless constitution and a legislature described by one commentator as “an army of yes men”. In reality, policy formulation and decision making were exercised by communist leaders. The 1954 Constitution declared that matters of party and state should be separate – however the party was intertwined with the state, to the extent that the two often appeared inseparable. The CCP had grown exponentially in the first decade of the People’s Republic. In 1949 it boasted 4.5 million members, a number which had doubled by 1953. By 1960 the party claimed in excess of 20 million members. The CCP’s internal organisation had Bolshevik-like structures and employed Lenin’s principle of ‘democratic centralism’. Party decisions were chiefly formulated by its Central Committee (a congress of between 100 and 300 party leaders) and its Politburo (a standing committee of around two dozen chiefs). Mao Zedong held the positions of national president, head of state and party chairman.\n\n1. Mao Zedong’s proclamation of the People’s Republic of China in October 1949 started the process of forming a new political system in China.\n\n2. In September 1949 Mao and the CCP formed a Political Consultative Conference, a body that served as an interim legislature and constitutional convention until 1954.\n\n3. This was replaced by a more permanent legislature, the National People’s Congress, in 1954. This Congress contained some 3,000 delegates and was elected by a complex three- or -four stage process.\n\n4. In September 1954 the Congress passed a new national constitution, modelled on the 1936 Soviet Union constitution. It was intended to be a transitional framework, to allow China to adopt a socialist system.\n\n5. The 1954 constitution required the state to be separate from political parties, however the CCP and its own party structure came to dominate government and decision making in the new society.\n\n© Alpha History 2018-23.

In 1950 the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) passed the Agrarian Reform Law, which outlined practical steps toward land reform and redistribution. The party insisted that Speak Bitterness meetings be part of the land reform process. These meetings were modelled on anti-landlord trials held in CCP-held areas in the years before 1949. Speak Bitterness would give Chinese peasant farmers the opportunity to express their anger and sorrow about old injustices. Under the auspices of Speak Bitterness, regional party leaders organised public meetings where landlords or employers were, in effect, placed on public trial. Tenant farmers could attend these ‘people’s courts’ to confront those who had previously exploited and mistreated them. Peasants once wronged by these individuals were encouraged – and in some cases obliged – to step forward, tell their story and expose their ku (past sufferings).\n\nThere were very few formal guidelines for these sessions. There was no time limit on testimonies, no formalised process, no cross examination of witnesses and little or no opportunity for accused landlords to bring witnesses or speak on their own behalf. Speak Bitterness sessions could be very long, emotional, dramatic, hostile and one sided. If landlords failed to answer particular questions or were implicated in witness testimony, they were often subjected to insults or beatings. Sometimes denounced landlords were executed at the conclusion of Speak Bitterness meetings, though it was more common for them to be banished or forced into a subservient role. Sometimes Speak Bitterness meetings were more about theatre and ritual humiliation than punishment. American reporter Jack Belden described witnessing one session, its defendant an old man who had starved and mistreated his family. The man was bombarded with insults and drenched with saliva but otherwise unharmed.\n\nThe American writer William Hinton, who lived in the village of Long Bow during the months of Speak Bitterness, described one of these sessions in Fanshen, his famous account of the agrarian revolution in China. Hinton refers to two men who were hauled before Speak Bitterness session: Jung Wang, a former landlord, and his brother and business partner. Jung was subsequently stripped of his wealth, while his brother was beaten to death. Here Hinton describes the mood of the village when these men finally had to answer to those they had exploited:\n\n“Then Ho Pang, a militiaman, spoke up. His voice shook as he told how he had rented land from Jung Wang. “One year I could not pay the rent. You took the whole harvest. You took my clothes. You took everything.” He broke down sobbing as a dozen others jumped up shouting “Speak! Yes speak, make him talk. Let’s hear his answers.” But Jung Wang had no answers. He could not utter a word. The next morning when the people met again to carry on the campaign against Jung Wang, excitement ran high. Women even went so far as to bring food with them so that they and their families could stay right through the day and not miss a single minute.”\n\nThe process was not always violent and hostile. According to some historians, the tone of Speak Bitterness meetings, as well as their outcomes, varied significantly from place to place. In some villages – presumably those that had suffered worse in pre-communist China – the rural peasantry moved swiftly and violently against landlords, killing many and subjecting others to immediate Speak Bitterness meetings. In other places it took months of agitation by CCP cadres before locals took any action against their landlords. The worst punishments were dispensed only to the tyrannical or the extraordinarily greedy. A sizeable number of landlords were stripped of their land holdings and private property but allowed to remain in the region. In these cases, re-casting previously wealthy landlords as lowly farmers or street cleaners seemed enough justice for many communities.\n\n“This abusive spillover of ku hai, the ‘sea of bitterness’ that law buried in so many hearts, was but one manifestation of the public use of personal grief in the Chinese Revolution… Suffering was no longer a worthless personal burden. It now had a didactic value in communal life. The sour taste of ku became a source of positive insight. And thus, modern Chinese became spiritual kin to the Jews, who also had to learn to extract lessons from suffering.”\n\nVera Schwarcz, historian\n\nMao Zedong was chiefly responsible for championing the process of Speaking Bitterness. Mao promoted it as a device for healing the wounds of the past and purging the soul – but it also had a political function. Speak Bitterness sessions helped bolster the CCP’s program of land reform and redistribution. They helped tear down old social hierarchies, stripping away the power and reverence of landlords by publicly humiliating them. “After Speaking Bitterness”, wrote one observer, “there could be no going back to the old ways”. Speak Bitterness was designed to stir class consciousness, to provide China’s long suffering peasantry with a sense of political empowerment. Mao hoped it would encourage peasants to develop new ways of thinking. He once described Speaking Bitterness as part of the “education of peasants into socialism”. According to Hinton, Speaking Bitterness became important for the peasants because, as one described, “only through hot argument can we get at the truth”.\n\n1. Speaking Bitterness occurred at thousands of denunciation meetings, promoted and organised by the CCP in the 1940s and early 1950s.\n\n2. Speak Bitterness sessions accompanied land reform and redistribution and involved peasant farmers interrogating and testifying before former landlords.\n\n3. At Speak Bitterness sessions witnesses were encouraged to expose their ku (past sufferings) – and many did so in an emotional and dramatic fashion.\n\n4. The outcomes of these meetings varied widely across China. Many landlords were executed or beaten to death, others banished, stripped of property and reduced to subservient roles.\n\n5. Speak Bitterness was encouraged by Mao Zedong, who saw it as an important step in the political education and rising class consciousness of the Chinese peasantry.\n\n© Alpha History 2018-23.

Established by Mao Zedong and the Red Army in 1930, the Jiangxi Soviet was significant for a number of reasons. It provided the CCP with a regional stronghold where it could consolidate and strengthen the Red Army. The Jiangxi Soviet was also a social and economic laboratory for trialling peasant-based socialism. The Jiangxi period thrust Mao Zedong into prominence as a CCP leader, as well as providing insight into his military tactics and political ideology. Jiangxi also exposed Mao’s cunning and brutality: his control was secured and maintained through violent purges of local communists. The flourishing Jiangxi Soviet caused concerns for Jiang Jieshi and his right-wing nationalist government in Nanjing. Fearful the CCP might use Jiangxi as a revolutionary base, Jiang launched several offensives against the region – but the first four of these were blocked by the renewed Red Army, employing guerrilla strategies developed by Mao and his lieutenants. Guomindang forces eventually surrounded Jiangxi in 1934, forcing the Red Army and CCP cadres to break out of the region and begin their famous Long March to the safety of northern China.\n\nThe Jiangxi Soviet was formed by Chinese communists who viewed the peasantry, the nation’s largest and most impoverished class, as the natural source of revolutionary action. The main exponent of this idea was Mao Zedong, a Hunan-born teacher and writer who was himself from peasant stock. Mao was a founding member of the CCP and a supporter of Marxist theory, however, his own political views were eclectic and not rigidly Marxist. In September 1927 Mao, ignoring directives from the CCP’s central committee, initiated a peasant uprising in his home province of Hunan. The Autumn Harvest Uprising, as it was called, was a short-lived attempt to overthrow Hunan’s provincial government and create a communist Soviet there. The uprising failed to attract sufficient support and Nationalist regiments forced Mao’s peasant militia into hiding in Jinggangshan, a remote mountain range between eastern Hunan and western Jiangxi. There they met with other CCP armies commanded by Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, who had retreated to Jinggangshan after the failed Nanchang Uprising in northern Jiangxi. Together these communist forces comprised the nucleus of the CCP’s Red Army – though at this stage they were a disorganised collection of rebellious peasants, communists, bandits and deserters from warlord armies and the Guomindang.\n\nIn 1929 Nationalist offensives forced most of the communists out of Jinggangshan. Led by Mao and Zhu De they moved into southern Jiangxi, basing themselves around the city of Ruijin. With further Nationalist attacks imminent, Mao set about strengthening the Red Army. Assisted by Zhu De, Mao devised plans for reorganising, training and preparing communist troops in Jiangxi. A voracious reader in his youth, Mao had studied the lives and victories of many great commanders, from Alexander the Great to George Washington – but it was the teachings of ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu that impressed him most. In his famous The Art of War, Sun Tzu emphasised the military value of speed, deception, concealment and morale; his credo “avoid what is strong, attack what is weak” formed the basis of what we know today as guerrilla warfare. Mao embraced these tactics and worked to incorporate them into the Red Army. Large divisions were organised into smaller guerrilla-based regiments, capable of operating autonomously. Mao also implemented a Leninist command structure and placed political commissars in army units to report on discipline, political attitudes and morale. A Red Army school was established in Jiangxi where CCP instructors, many of them veterans of the Huangpu Military Academy, drilled officers on tactics, leadership and modern warfare techniques, such as communications and code-breaking. In just a few years the Red Army hardened from a rag-tag peasant militia into a well trained and competent military force.\n\nThe Jiangxi Soviet became a political entity as well as a military base. The formation of this ‘state within a state’ provided the CCP with valuable experience in running a government. The Soviet was officially formed in November 1931, when 15 CCP-controlled settlements around Ruijin were amalgamated into a new independent state called Zhonghua Suwei-ai Gongheguo, or the Chinese Soviet Republic. The government of this new republic was modelled on the Soviet government formed in Russia after the October 1917 revolution. An executive committee was elected to oversee policy and appointments, while a smaller commissariat oversaw day to day government. Mao Zedong was elected chairman of both bodies, in addition to his duties as Jiangxi’s military commander. He would later be sidelined from power after the CCP hierarchy relocated from Shanghai to Jiangxi. The Chinese Soviet Republic also adopted its own flag, the Soviet Union hammer and sickle on a red background, and drafted its own constitution, which read in part:\n\n“The Chinese Soviet regime is a state based on the democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants. All the power of the Soviet shall belong to the workers, peasants and Red Army soldiers and the entire labouring population. Under the Soviet regime, the workers, peasants, Red Army soldiers and entire labouring population shall have the right to elect their own deputies to give effect to their power. Only militarists, bureaucrats, landlords, the despotic gentry, capitalists, rich peasants, monks and all exploiting and counter-revolutionary elements shall be deprived of the right to elect deputies to participate in government and to enjoy political freedom…”\n\nIn keeping with this vision, Mao and his supporters initiated ambitious economic reforms in Jiangxi. In 1930 the Soviet government ordered that all surplus land be confiscated from landlords and affluent peasants, then handed to villages for redistribution. The process did not punish landlords or rich peasants, who like all others were entitled to ownership of land. Mao’s view was that declaring war on landlords ‘wasted’ revolutionary energy. He preferred a more inclusive approach that encouraged co-operation and production, rather than provoking internal disruption. Land policies in the Chinese Soviet Republic shifted radically in 1933 when Mao’s leadership was overtaken by the Comintern-backed Shanghai leaders. Post-1933 land policies in Jiangxi began to resemble those employed in Stalinist Russia. Land redistribution was controlled by the party centre, more closely monitored and conducted more ruthlessly. Landlords and wealthy peasants were excluded or given poor quality land; hundreds were persecuted, driven into exile or murdered. The CCP central executive condemned Mao’s land policies as too moderate and bourgeois – yet under Mao’s leadership, agrarian production in Jiangxi had steadily increased. At its peak in around 1932, the Jiangxi region was outdoing most other Chinese provinces in terms of food production.\n\n“The Jiangxi Soviet Republic afforded the Communists the first opportunity to test their ability to govern… Mao Zedong deliberately used the Jiangxi Soviet Republic to counter-balance his opponents who were in control of the Party organisation. However it did not last long, and Mao’s dominance of it was even shorter.”\n\nShiping Zheng, historian\n\nMao’s leadership also had its dark side. Jiangxi had its own CCP framework before Mao and his followers arrived in 1929. The Jiangxi communists followed the party line, articulated by the CCP leadership in Shanghai. Mao’s takeover of the Ruijin area and his formation of a peasant-based soviet triggered political disagreements and tensions between the Jiangxi CCP and Mao’s followers. These tensions came to a head during the so-called Futian incident. In December 1930 Mao ordered the arrest of around 4,000 Red Army personnel, claiming some regiments had been infiltrated by Guomindang agents. These arrests triggered the mutiny of a Red Army battalion in Qingyuan, central Jiangxi. Mao’s lieutenants Peng Dehuai and Lin Biao responded by marching Red Army units into Futian and crushing the mutiny. Approximately 700 communist soldiers were rounded up, interrogated and executed. Mao and his supporters continued the purge into 1931, justifying them with ongoing threats from Guomindang spies and informers. The historians Jung Chang and Jon Halliday claim this political violence was designed to consolidate Mao’s power by exterminating and dispersing local Jiangxi communists. According to Chang and Halliday, Mao’s henchmen employed quite horrific methods of torture, both against political opponents and their wives and families.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the nationalist-militarist leader Jiang Jieshi viewed the Jiangxi Soviet as a threat to his own government. Between 1930 and 1933 Jiang ordered four offensives, dubbed Encirclement Campaigns, against the communists in Jiangxi. The first of these campaigns were unsuccessful: they required Nationalist forces to travel long distances from their bases into the interior of China, stretching their command and supply lines. Red Army divisions, which were growing in skill and confidence, were able to isolate and engage Guomindang forces using Mao’s guerrilla strategies. In the First Encirclement Campaign (1930-31) several Nationalist divisions were surrounded by the more mobile Red Army and around 12,000 soldiers were taken prisoner. Jiang’s Second and Third Encirclement Campaigns, both launched in 1931, employed much larger troop numbers (around 100,000 Nationalist soldiers and 200,000 warlord soldiers) but they also failed to drive the CCP from Jiangxi. In the autumn of 1933 Nationalist forces began their final assault, the Fifth Encirclement Campaign. This time Jiang was much better prepared, both with resources and strategy. The Nationalist armies boasted around 800,000 men, dozens of heavy artillery pieces and 200 aeroplanes. Nationalist generals were armed with battle strategies for countering Red Army mobility, drawn up with the assistance of German military advisors, particularly Hans von Seeckt. These advantages, coupled with a shift in CCP military tactics, allowed the Nationalists to finally drive the communists from their stronghold in Jiangxi.\n\n1. The Jiangxi Soviet was a self-governing communist region, formed around Ruijin by Mao Zedong and the Red Army in 1930. They arrived there after the failed Autumn Harvest Uprising of 1929.\n\n2. In November 1931 the Jiangxi Soviet became the Chinese Soviet Republic. It adopted its own constitution and served as a laboratory for socialist policies, particularly land reform and redistribution.\n\n3. Within the Jiangxi Soviet, the Red Army was restructured, renewed and trained in guerrilla strategies, studied and adapted by Mao Zedong.\n\n4. Between 1930 and 1934 the Jiangxi Soviet was attacked by the Nationalist forces of Jiang Jieshi, in five offensives known as Encirclement Campaigns.\n\n5. These early offensives proved unsuccessful, however by late 1933 the Red Army was finally driven out after being outnumbered, outgunned and undermined by changes in tactics.\n\n© Alpha History 2018-23.

Please refer to this page for more information.\n\nIn April 1927 Guomindang forces, aided by urban gangsters and warlord militia, attacked members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Shanghai. Hundreds of communists were rounded up, arrested and tortured; most were executed or assassinated. The Shanghai Massacre, or ‘April 12th Incident’ as it is sometimes called, was a pivotal moment in the Chinese Revolution. It triggered a nationwide purge of communists from the Guomindang and several years of anti-communist violence, dubbed the ‘White Terror’. Surviving communists were either forced underground or into rural and provincial areas outside Guomindang control. The events of April 1927 marked the end of the First United Front between the CCP and Guomindang and the end of Soviet Russian support for the Nationalists. The CCP leadership was forced to reassess its revolutionary strategy in the wake of the events in Shanghai. Many historians consider this the starting point of the Chinese Civil War.\n\nWhen Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) died in March 1925, the nominal leadership of the Guomindang passed to Sun’s ideological protege Wang Jingwei, a member of the party’s left wing. Though not a significant political leader, Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) exerted considerable influence because of his military leadership. In June 1926, right-wing power brokers in the Guomindang organised Jiang’s elevation to commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). The following month the NRA embarked on the Northern Expedition, an ambitious campaign to suppress warlords in northern China to achieve Sun Yixian’s dream of reunification. The first phase of the Northern Expedition (1926-27) was generally successful. The NRA was well trained and organised, competently led by Huangpu graduates and equipped with Russian and German weapons. It also enjoyed the support of Chinese civilians who were fed up with warlord rule. Outnumbered and outgunned, many warlords capitulated and agreed to align with the Guomindang. Their private armies were dissolved or absorbed into the NRA. By the spring of 1927 Nationalist regiments had captured Wuhan, Shanghai and Nanjing, while the total number of NRA troops had swelled from over 100,000 to around 250,000.\n\n“The Shanghai massacre of 1927 did not lead to the victory of Jiang Jieshi but rather to the collapse of military unity in the NRA… The spread of violence in the cities and countryside made it possible for the northern warlords to launch a counter-offensive military campaign… Facing enemies from both directions, warlords in the north and Communist uprisings in the south, Jiang Jieshi’s NRA was forced out of North China… As a result of these defeats, Jiang Jieshi announced his ‘retirement’ and left Nanjing, leaving a fraction of soldiers remaining in Wuhan and Nanjing…”\n\nSharron Gu, historian\n\nThe NRA’s successful northern advance also exposed divisions and tensions in the Guomindang hierarchy. The Northern Expedition highlighted the importance of military leadership, allowing Jiang Jieshi to present as an alternative leader. In January 1927 Wang Jingwei asserted his authority by forming a new civilian national government in Wuhan, away from Jiang Jieshi’s military power base in the south. Jiang responded by lobbying to have the capital shifted from Wuhan to Nanchang, the location of his military headquarters. As their leaders bickered over who should rule and from where, the left and right wing factions of the Guomindang grew apart. In April 1927, Jiang’s forces captured Nanjing and Jiang formed a rival government to the one in Wuhan. Jiang declared that Wang Jingwei’s government had been infiltrated by communists and was no longer representative of the Guomindang. He followed this with an arrest order for 197 suspected communists within the party. The leftists in Wuhan condemned Jiang as a power-mad militarist, possessed by “the ghost of Yuan Shikai“. Both factions considered pausing their anti-warlord operations in the north to attack the other. Instead, they chose to maintain the Northern Expedition, each hoping to gain an advantage over the other by capturing Beijing first.\n\nAs the rival Guomindang governments in Wuhan and Nanjing embarked on a power struggle, trouble was also brewing in Shanghai, the home base of the CCP leadership. In the first weeks of 1927 CCP leaders Chen Duxiu and Zhou Enlai, backed by advice from the Comintern, organised three insurrections in Shanghai. In late March 1927, the third and largest of these uprisings removed the Zhili warlord, Sun Chuanfang, from power. Nationalist forces loyal to Jiang Jieshi entered Shanghai shortly after and took control of the city. The two Guomindang governments responded differently to the events in Shanghai. The left-wing Wuhan leader, Wang Jingwei, travelled to the city and met with communist leaders. He congratulated them on gaining control of Shanghai for the nationalist government, affirming the collaboration between the CCP and Guomindang. Jiang Jieshi’s faction, however, condemned the CCP’s uprising in Shanghai as presumptive and anti-revolutionary. The right-wing of the Guomindang began mobilising to purge the party of communists.\n\nAnti-communist action in Shanghai commenced the day after Wang Jingwei’s departure from the city. On April 6th Jiang’s nationalist forces ordered the closure of Shanghai’s political bureau, a temporary municipal government set up by the CCP. Three days later Jiang declared martial law, citing a need to restore order, halt spontaneous violence and end wildcat labour strikes. As Jiang was taking this overt action he was also negotiating with members of Shanghai’s notorious Green Gang. The Green Gang was a shady network of secret societies, gangsters and opium smugglers, some of whom had concealed and supported Jiang in the mid-1910s when he was a fugitive from Yuan Shikai. Now Jiang mobilised the Green Gang against the communists in Shanghai, equipping them with weapons and Guomindang uniforms. Green Gang members began surveilling CCP officials and union officials. On April 11th Jiang issued a secret directive to Guomindang leaders in Shanghai, ordering a purge of communists. At dawn, the following day Green Gang members began attacking striking workers. With the tacit support of Shanghai’s businessmen and Westerners in the city’s foreign concessions, Guomindang soldiers attacked CCP buildings and safe houses, murdering notable communists and union leaders, and arresting dissident workers. When a mob of students and industrial workers gathered to protest this violence they too were fired upon by Guomindang soldiers, causing more than 100 deaths.\n\nOver the next month, the Guomindang continued its purge of communists, both in Shanghai and wherever else it held power. This campaign, later dubbed the White Terror, caused the deaths of between 5,000 (Guomindang government figures) and almost 50,000 (CCP figures) communists. An independent source claims that 12,000 communists were killed or vanished in a three-week period. As many as 4,000 were killed in Shanghai alone. The most prominent victim of the White Terror was Li Dazhao, a co-founder of the CCP. Li was captured during a raid on the Soviet embassy in Beijing and executed on April 28th. Zhou Enlai was also captured and faced summary execution, however, a Guomindang officer recognised Zhou from his time as a lecturer at Huangpu and allowed his release. Hundreds of communists went into hiding in the foreign concessions in Shanghai, Canton and Hong Kong, only to be murdered or kidnapped by Guomindang-aligned gangsters. Some reports also suggest that Jiang Jieshi’s men used the White Terror to raise funds, either by confiscating property or extorting ‘donations’ from wealthy businessmen in Shanghai. The events of April 1927 prompted the Comintern [Communist International] to break ties with the Guomindang. It also triggered in-fighting between communists and left-wing nationalists in Wuhan that contributed to the collapse of Wang Jingwei’s government there. Thousands of communists remained underground in the cities or dispersed to rural areas. Some attempted to fight back. In August rebellious army units, led by Zhou Enlai, Zhu De and He Long, occupied Nanchang for several days before being driven out by the Guomindang army. By late summer 1927, Jiang Jieshi had emerged as the dominant republican leader of China.\n\n1. The Shanghai Massacre was an attack on members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by Jiang Jieshi and the right wing of the Guomindang, in April 1927.\n\n2. The Shanghai Massacre, also known as the ’12th April Incident’, occurred part way through the National Revolutionary Army’s Northern Expedition, a military campaign to reunify China.\n\n3. Jiang’s decision to attack and purge the communists was triggered by the formation of a left-wing Guomindang government in Wuhan and a CCP uprising in Shanghai.\n\n4. With the aid of the Green Gang, a local troupe of gangsters, Guomindang forces arrested and executed hundreds of suspected communists, while thousands more went missing.\n\n5. The purge continued for weeks and became known as the White Terror. It marked the end of the First United Front, the end of Soviet backing for the Guomindang and the eventual collapse of Wang Jingwei’s left-wing government in Wuhan.\n\n© Alpha History 2018.

Please refer to this page for more information.\n\nMao Zedong (Wade-Giles: Mao Tse-tung) became the face, the figurehead and the ideological father of Chinese communism. From peasant origins in Hunan, young Mao became a busy activist, participating in literary groups, organising labour strikes and starting schools to educate workers and peasants. The May Fourth Movement sparked his interest in political movements, particularly Marxism. He became a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) then single-handedly built up the party in his native Hunan. While others in the CCP took their direction from the Comintern and from Marxist orthodoxy, Mao was an individualist who believed that China’s peasants, not planners in Moscow, should determine the course of the Chinese Revolution. By the late 1920s Mao was living beyond the reach of the CCP hierarchy and forging his own revolutionary course. In 1930 he established a rural soviet in Jiangxi province and set about building a model socialist state, complete with a government, an army and land reform. The Jiangxi Soviet became so secure that the CCP leadership relocated there in 1932-33, a move that seemed to marginalise Mao. But Mao was too shrewd a political operator to be sidelined so easily.\n\nMao Zedong was born in Hunan province in central southern China, the youngest of four sons. His father owned almost four acres of land, enough for the family to be considered wealthy by peasant standards – however Mao still witnessed a considerable amount of poverty and suffering in Hunan, the worst of this during a devastating famine in 1910. Aside from a brief stint fighting with anti-Qing forces during the 1911 Revolution, most of Mao’s early life was spent as an academic under the tutelage of his future father-in-law, Yang Changji. Mao commenced teacher training in 1912, after which he was employed as a librarian, then a primary school principal. He was a voracious reader of history and politics, from classic works of Chinese literature to The Communist Manifesto. In 1919 Mao travelled to Beijing, inspired by the student activism of the May Fourth Movement; while in the capital he published essays supporting trade unionism and women’s rights. In early 1920 Mao moved to Shanghai, washing clothes by day but spending his spare time in political and literary groups. It was there that Mao was first drawn to Marxism, after mixing with Chen Duxiu and other early communists. In July 1921 he attended the first CCP congress, representing Hunan.\n\nShortly after the congress Mao returned to Hunan, where he set about organising and strengthening the local CCP branch. Based in Changsha, the provincial capital, Mao began building support by writing, educating and networking. He published radical essays in Changsha’s newspapers, perpetuating the spirit of the May Fourth Movement but also floating and promoting Marxist ideas. He became involved in organising Hunan’s miners, railway and textile workers, providing advice on disputes and encouraging organised strikes; no less than 20 different unions were formed in Hunan under Mao’s guidance. Mao also started night schools where Hunan’s workers and peasants could learn Chinese and mathematics; these schools were not only very popular, they were also a conduit for promoting Marxist ideas and CCP membership. In mid-1923 Mao was elected to the CCP’s executive committee and relocated to Shanghai. He also took up membership of the Guomindang, in line with Comintern instructions; Mao later headed up a nationalist propaganda bureau and in January 1924 attended the Guomindang national congress in Guangzhou. The March 1925 death of Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) and the rise of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) saw Mao lose his position within the Guomindang. Mao returned to Hunan and started compiling his famous Hunan Peasant Report, while organising and delivering military training to peasant militias.\n\n“While Mao Zedong was a great revolutionary, he became increasingly despotic as a ruler, a not uncommon development in the history of revolutions. He organised the peasants of China to destroy ancient forms of oppression and authority only to replace them with the alien authority of his own deified image. He liberated the Chinese nation from the shackles of foreign imperialism – and ‘build a country’, as his successor Deng Xiaoping put it – only to shackle the people to the onerous demands of the doctrine of ‘continuous revolution’. The two sides of Mao – the revolutionary and the tyrant, the social liberator and the political dictator – cannot easily be reconciled.”\n\nMaurice J. Meisner, historian\n\nThe year 1927 was a turning point in Mao’s life. Jiang Jieshi’s massacre of communists in Shanghai ended the First United Front and forced most of the CCP into hiding. In Hunan, Mao turned his attention to the political and military mobilisation of the peasantry, with the aim of achieving local autonomy. Mao hoped to train rebellious farmers so they could instigate uprisings to overthrow nationalist authorities or ruling warlords, after which they could create peasant soviets on the Russian model. This approach proved quite popular with peasants in Hunan, since it tapped into long-standing grievances and dissatisfactions. In September 1927 Mao led an unsuccessful peasant rebellion in Hunan and neighbouring Jiangxi. Dubbed the Autumn Harvest Uprising, it was thwarted by inadequate numbers and poor leadership; Mao and his ally, military commander Zhu De, were forced into hiding in the Jinggang mountains, while Mao was sharply criticised by the CCP Politburo for exceeding his authority. Mao’s forces spent the next 18 months either in hiding in the mountains, searching for a new base or resisting attacks from Jiang Jieshi’s nationalist army.\n\nIn early 1929 Mao and Zhu De led their armies into southern Jiangxi. In February 1930, after a year of consolidation, Mao and his supporters formed the Jiangxi Soviet, an attempt to create a self-governing, self-sustaining rural base. Mao envisioned the Jiangxi Soviet as both a military stronghold against the nationalists and a laboratory for the trialling of communist economic and social policies. Some of Mao’s military reforms and land redistributions proved unpopular with other party officials in Jiangxi; he dealt with these dissenters and political opponents by branding them “rich peasants” and “counter-revolutionaries”. In late 1930 Mao initiated a series of purges to remove Jiangxi CCP and Red Army leaders hostile to his own leadership. The Futian incident, as this purge became known, saw hundreds of Mao’s opponents arrested and silenced with brutality and executions; confessions were sometimes extracted from suspects by torturing their wives. These purges went on for the duration of Mao’s leadership in Jiangxi, with historians estimating the total number of deaths between 10,000 and 70,000. Mao himself was no stranger to political violence. In late 1930 pro-Guomindang warlords captured and executed his sister, Mao Zehong, two of his sisters-in-law and Mao’s estranged wife Yang Kaihui.\n\nMao spent 1931 consolidating his control of the Jiangxi Soviet and implementing socialist policies and programs. In November 1931 Jiangxi was formally reconstituted as the Chinese Soviet Republic, with Ruijin its capital and Mao its chairman. The Red Army in Jiangxi numbered around 150,000 soldiers, as well as training facilities and munitions factories. Mao’s success in consolidating and fortifying Jiangxi resulted in the CCP Central Committee relocating there in 1932-33, following a police crackdown in Shanghai. Jiangxi now became the CCP’s national headquarters, a shift that eroded Mao’s authority in the rural soviet and exposed ideological differences between Mao and the party’s leadership. The CCP’s platform was still dictated by the Comintern, now represented by the German agent Otto Braun. Mao now became an outsider in the soviet he had helped to build. His view of the peasantry as a potential source of revolution was dismissed by the party leadership; his military strategies were overruled and replaced with more convention tactics. The presence of the CCP leadership in Jiangxi also made it a target for Jiang Jieshi’s encirclement campaigns during the early 1930s. These campaigns failed at first but the Jiangxi defences eventually gave way, forcing the Red Army to break out and embark on its famous Long March to Shaanxi. Mao Zedong appeared to have lost his stronghold in Jiangxi – but the Long March would provide him with an opportunity to challenge for the leadership of the CCP.\n\n1. Mao Zedong was an important communist revolutionary who emerged as the CCP leader in the mid-1930s.\n\n2. From peasant origins, the educated Mao later worked as a social activist in Hunan, Beijing and Shanghai.\n\n3. He was drawn to Marxism during the May Fourth Movement and in July 1920 became a founding member of the CCP.\n\n4. Mao organised the CCP in Hunan, assembled and trained a militia and in 1927 attempted a rural revolution.\n\n5. In 1930 Mao and his supporters established the Jiangxi Soviet, later the Chinese Soviet Republic, where they strengthened their military while implementing socialist economic and social policies. Mao’s power was challenged when the CCP hierarchy relocated to Jiangxi in the early 1930s.\n\n© Alpha History 2018-23. Content on this page may not be republished or distributed without permission.

Seeking an alternative path for China’s political development, these men turned to the writings of Karl Marx and the example provided by Bolshevik revolutionaries in Russia. In its first years the CCP was small and relatively insignificant. Just a dozen people attended the party’s first congress in 1921 and by January 1925 its total membership was still less than 1,000 people. During this early period the CCP’s ideology, organisation and tactics were determined not by its Chinese members but by the Communist International in Moscow. In the early 1920s Moscow considered the CCP too weak and underdeveloped to be a revolutionary party in its own right, so CCP members were directed to join the nationalist Guomindang and support its quest for national reunification. The First United Front – a political and military collaboration between the Comintern, the CCP and the Guomindang – was negotiated by Sun Yixian and Adolph Joffe in 1923. Ideological differences between communists and right wing militarists in the Guomindang made the First United Front an often uncomfortable alliance – but from a communist perspective it achieved the reunification of China, while providing the CCP with military training, opportunities for recruitment and an awareness of the Guomindang, its future rival for power.\n\nChinese reformists and radicals had long been curious about and receptive to Western political ideologies. The American liberal John Dewey visited China in 1919 at the height of the May Fourth Movement, while British philosopher Bertrand Russell also spent a year in China in 1920. Between them they delivered more than 300 lectures to Chinese audiences. More radical political and literary groups, disgruntled with China’s treatment by the Western powers in 1919, looked beyond Anglo-American political models and ideologies. Some turned to the German writers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, whose works The Communist Manifesto (1848) and Das Kapital (1867) advanced strong and well argued criticisms of European capitalism and the political systems that supported it. These works gave rise to an entirely new political ideology: communism, also known as Marxism after its chief creator. The tenets of communism promised a new kind of society, where class exploitation and oppression would disappear. Marxist ideas were further adapted by the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulyanov, or Lenin, who argued that imperialism – the subjugation and economic exploitation of weak nations by stronger nations – was simply an end result of capitalism. A socialist government, both Marx and Lenin argued, would eradicate imperialism and rule on behalf of the working classes of all nations, rather than a privileged few. In October 1917 Lenin and his followers moved to put their theory into practice when they seized control of the national government of Russia.\n\nMarxist-Leninist theories had obvious appeal for Chinese radicals. Marx and Lenin may have been a Westerners but they provided a stinging condemnation of Western imperialism and a lucid explanation of what had happened in China. The broken promises of Versailles and the reluctance of Western nations to relinquish their grip on China seemed to validate Lenin’s theories on imperialism. The May Fourth Movement further weakened China’s fascination with Western democracy and constitutional government, leading some political and literary groups to study and discuss Marxist texts. The most fertile ground for this rising interest in Marxism was Shanghai, China’s most Westernised and industrialised city and the third-largest city in Asia. Shanghai was a city of enormous contrasts. Western cultures sat alongside Chinese culture, affluence alongside poverty, capitalist excess alongside the exploitation of workers. By 1919 the city had a left wing newspaper, the Shanghai Chronicle, funded by Russians and Western expatriates sympathetic to socialism. By the summer of 1920 Marxist ideology was being widely discussed by literary groups in Shanghai. In September that year Chen Duxiu, later a founding member of the CCP, wrote that China needed to “establish by revolutionary means a state of the working class (proletariat) in order to create a government and laws [to] put a stop to internal and external pillaging”.\n\nThis developing interest was encouraged and supported by a Soviet Russian agency called the Comintern (or Communist International). The Comintern was formed in Moscow in March 1919 to advance communism and support communist groups around the globe. In early 1920 the Comintern established the Far Eastern Bureau, a subcommittee tasked with starting and assisting communist groups in Asia. One of the first Comintern agents sent to China was 26-year-old Grigori Voitinsky, who arrived in Shanghai in June 1920. Voitinsky met frequently with Duxiu and Li Dazhao, another CCP founder, and advised them on the logistics of establishing a communist party. By the end of 1920 this group had drafted its own party manifesto, started a newsletter and formed communist-oriented labour and youth groups. Some historians consider these the first actions of the Chinese Communist Party – however the CCP was not formally constituted until its first congress in July 1921. This meeting, attended by just 12 delegates representing 59 party members, was started in a girls’ school in Shanghai’s French quarter but had to be moved to a boat on South Lake to avoid police raids. Among those in attendance were future leaders Wang Jingwei and Mao Zedong, as well as Henk Sneevliet, a Dutch representative of the Comintern.\n\n“The Chinese family was still all-powerful and claimed all individual loyalties. In the words of Lin Yu t’ang, it was a ‘walled castle outside which everything is legitimate loot’. The clan, the family, the guild, the village were infinitely more important than the nation and the state… Chinese Communists put themselves at a considerable advantage by a violent attack on the family, which ceased to exist in the eyes of the Party. This won the undivided loyalty of their members…”\n\nJacques Guillermaz, historian\n\nIn its first three years the CCP was weak and ineffective, chiefly because of its size (the 59 members of July 1921 had only increased to about 300 a year later). The party was also ideologically divided: some members were orthodox Marxists who believed that revolutionary energy came from the proletariat (industrial workforce), while others, like Hunan’s Mao Zedong, viewed the peasantry as China’s most potential revolutionary group. The Comintern, frustrated by the slow growth and development of the CCP, considered it incapable of acting on its own. From Moscow’s perspective the CCP’s best role was to assist the forces of democratic revolution, as China transitioned from Qing feudalism to a Western-style constitutional government. In 1922 Comintern agents directed CCP members to also take up individual membership of the Guomindang. They were instructed to support the Guomindang’s political mission of reunification, while infiltrating the much larger nationalist party and recruiting new CCP members. According to a telegram sent from Moscow in August 1922, CCP members were to “build groups of followers within the GMD [Guomindang] and in the trade unions”. The Comintern also restructured the CCP to implement ‘democratic centralism’, a more disciplined system of organisation and command. This process was overseen by Mikhail Borodin, a Comintern agent who arrived in China in 1923.\n\nA working alliance between the CCP and Guomindang was negotiated in early 1923, when Soviet diplomat Adolf Joffe arrived in Shanghai for meetings with Sun Yixian. On January 26th the two formally agreed that “the Soviet system cannot he adopted in China” and “that the most urgent problem China faces today is the successful unification of the republic and the completion of national independence”. The Sun-Joffe agreement was later endorsed at the CCP’s third congress (June 1923), heralding the start of the First United Front. Thousands of Chinese communists took up individual membership of the Guomindang and a few, including CCP founder Li Dazhao and future leader Mao Zedong, came to sit on the Guomindang executive committee. Several communists, including Zhou Enlai, trained personnel at the nationalist military academy in Huangpu, or served in the Guomindang-led National Revolutionary Army. Yet for all its military and logistical achievements, the First United Front was neither a comfortable alliance or one likely to outlive the goal of Chinese reunification. The Guomindang’s right wing was never at ease with working with communists, so ideological disputes and clashes were common. The First United Front became even more fragile after the death of its main architect, Sun Yixian, in March 1925. By this point the CCP had fewer than 1,000 members, however in 1926 the party turned its attention to recruiting and by the spring of 1927 its membership had increased to more than 57,000.\n\n1. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was formed by Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao and others in Shanghai in July 1921. It originated from political and literary groups that studied Marxism after the May Fourth Movement.\n\n2. Marxism was a European ideology developed by Karl Marx and adapted by Vladimir Lenin. It offered an alternative to Western democratic systems and a condemnation of Western imperialism.\n\n3. Marxism offered a criticism of Western governments and economics, in particular their imperialism and economic exploitation of weaker countries like China.\n\n3. The early CCP was small in number (only 12 members attended its first meeting) and ineffective. Its organisation and tactics were determined by the Comintern in Moscow, rather than local leaders.\n\n5. In 1922-23 the Comintern, considering the CCP too small to effect any revolutionary action on its own, directed CCP members to join and support the Guomindang and its mission to reunify China. This alliance, the First United Front, allowed the CCP to recruit, develop and acquire military experience.\n\n© Alpha History 2018-23.

In the mid-1920s Jiang led a successful expedition to conquer powerful northern warlords and became the ruler of a reunified China. Jiang remained the nominal president of China for the next 20 years. During the 1930s many considered him the natural leader of a newly created but inherently unstable Chinese republic. Whether in a dapper Western suit or the full-dress uniform of a generalissimo, Jiang seemed to represent a modern China, rather than the old world of the Qing. He also combined Sun Yixian’s hopeful nationalism with Yuan Shikai’s decisive militarism; Jiang was committed to a united Chinese republic but unlike Sun he had the military muscle to achieve it. Yet despite Jiang’s prowess and strong-man persona, his two decades as president of China were dogged by internal opposition and external threats. Hostile warlords, Guomindang rivals, Japanese imperialists and communist revolutionaries all challenged Jiang’s rule. It eventually collapsed in 1949 when much of China was overrun by communists. Jiang himself fled to Taiwan, where he established an alternative Chinese government and ruled until his death in 1975.\n\nJiang Jieshi was born in 1887 in Zhejiang province on China’s east coast. Jiang’s father was a prosperous merchant who traded mainly in salt and wine, his mother a restrained and obedient wife. At age 19 Jiang, inspired by China’s slow but determined push for ‘self-strengthening’, enrolled at Yuan Shikai’s New Army military academy at Baoding. The following year he left to study at Rikugun Shikan Gakko, Japan’s premier officer training academy; after graduating in 1909 he volunteered for two years in the Japanese military. While stationed in Tokyo Jiang’s friends introduced him to Sun Yixian and other nationalists; Jiang, already a supporter of Chinese republicanism, was inspired to join Sun’s Tongmenghui. He returned to China in 1911 and participated as a military leader in the Xinhai Revolution, commanding artillery units against Qing forces in Hangzhou. Jiang was also involved in the Guomindang’s unsuccessful July 1913 revolution against Yuan Shikai, before fleeing to Japan. He later returned secretly to China, living in the foreign sections of Shanghai and working with the Green Gang, a notorious gangster clique. These connections with the Shanghai underworld would later prove useful during Jiang’s purge of communists in the spring of 1927.\n\nAfter Yuan Shikai’s death in mid-1916, Sun Yixian and many of his followers, including Jiang, returned to southern China. Jiang’s planning and command of nationalist regiments were instrumental in the founding of a military republic in Guangdong province. By the early 1920s, he had become both a member of Sun Yixian’s government and the republic’s military commander. In early 1924 Jiang was sent to Moscow, where he spent four months studying Soviet military training and organisation. On his return to Guangzhou Jiang was appointed commandant of the newly formed Huangpu (Wade-Giles: Whampoa) Military Academy, a facility for training Guomindang officers. Huangpu was modelled on Soviet academies that combined military training with political indoctrination. Jiang was generally supportive of the Guomindang-communist alliance, however, his personal politics were anti-communist and he was wary of Soviet intrusions into the management of Huangpu. In late 1924 Jiang threatened to resign as commandant after a dispute with Soviet advisors. The Soviets themselves advised Moscow that Jiang was “hostile” to communism and would have to be “managed”.\n\nSun Yixian died in 1925, leaving several powerful lieutenants but no succession plan. Two of the main contenders, Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin, occupied the left-wing and right-wing of the party respectively. As a military commander, Jiang Jieshi had avoided most of the Guomindang’s factional wrangling and internal power struggles; little was known of his personal politics. In the end, it was his military successes that allowed Jiang to challenge for the Guomindang leadership. In 1925 Jiang was put in charge of the first nationalist army assembled from Huangpu graduates; the following year he was appointed as commander-in-chief of the 100,000-strong National Revolutionary Army (NRA). In July 1926 Jiang commanded the first of two expeditions, marching the NRA north to engage the powerful Zhili warlords. The Zhili militias were formidable but proved no match for the NRA, which was led by trained officers and equipped with Russian and German weapons. After this success, Jiang focused his attention on perceived threats within his own party. In April 1927 he instigated a purge of communists in Shanghai; weeks later forces loyal to Jiang attacked Wuhan, where Wang Jingwei had positioned himself at the head of a new national government. These were the first of many campaigns Jiang Jieshi would launch against communists, who he despised as puppets of Moscow rather than true Chinese nationalists.\n\n“Mao [Zedong] was famous for his lack of grooming and his peasant ways; Jiang, as one visitor remarked, had ‘the air of fastidious distinction’. The Great Helmsman wore baggy blue peasant clothes and a Red Army cap; the Generalissimo neat suits, silk robes, uniforms hung with medals and a velvet Western trilby. Jiang was slim, erect, precise, his lips thin, his head shaven… Except when he flew into one of his fits of temper, Jiang exuded self-control; whatever his inner calculations, Mao behaved expansively to visitors, appearing to take them into confidence, even if this was to seduce them into his ideological embrace.”\n\nJonathon Fenby, historian\n\nIn 1928 Jiang and his forces completed a second expedition to suppress the Fengtian clique in Manchuria and northern China. By the middle of the year, Jiang’s forces had either defeated or absorbed most of the warlord armies in northern and eastern China. With the isolation of his main rival Wang Jingwei, Jiang was now the undisputed leader of the Guomindang. In October 1928 Jiang was placed in charge of the State Council, making him the de facto leader of the Chinese republic. Under Jiang’s rule, a nationalist government was formed in a new capital, Nanjing, closer to the Guomindang’s natural support base. Jiang declared that China was entering the second of Sun Yixian’s three stages of development: a period of ‘political tutelage’, where leaders would educate the people in the ways of democracy, though without giving them any control of the government. Outside the government Jiang courted the support of China’s powerful business interests and affluent landlords; these elites drew closer to Jiang after his suppression of communists in April 1927. Jiang also exploited the legacy of the late Sun Yixian by intensifying the cult of personality that had emerged after Sun’s death, ordering that Sun’s body be entombed in a grand mausoleum. Jiang also developed and refined his own political rhetoric, so that it mirrored that of Sun’s. In December 1927 Jiang married his third wife, Soong May-ling, the younger sister of Sun’s widow; later dubbed ‘Madame Jiang’ by the Western press, she became a significant political figure in her own right.\n\n1. Jiang Jieshi was a Guomindang military commander who came to lead the party after the death of Sun Yixian.\n\n2. He sided with Sun while receiving military training in Japan, then commanded troops in the 1911 Revolution.\n\n3. In 1924 he became commandant of Huangpu military academy and commander of the National Revolutionary Army.\n\n4. Jiang’s successes in suppressing northern warlords fuelled his rise to prominence in the late 1920s.\n\n5. In April 1927 Jiang revealed his anti-communist position by ordering the mass arrest and execution of communists in Shanghai. The following year he became the leader of the national government, closely aligning himself with the political legacy of Sun Yixian.\n\n© Alpha History 2018-23.

The movement was initiated mainly by university students, who were angry at China’s treatment at the hands of Western powers after World War I. Specifically, they were outraged by the passing of German imperial interests in Shandong province over to the Japanese. The May Fourth Movement was anti-imperialist and demanded the restoration of Chinese independence and sovereignty. Its leaders also wanted socio-political reform, namely the eradication of Confucian values and a society based on democratic government, liberal individualism, science and industry. The movement peaked on May 4th 1919, when thousands of students rallied in Beijing to protest against China’s treatment in the Treaty of Versailles. Their protest was supported by students and striking workers across China. These events radicalised political movements in China and contributed to the rise of groups like the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was formed two years later.\n\nReformist ideas and movements were not uncommon in late imperial China. The supporters of the Self Strengthening Movement of the 1800s endorsed limited economic and educational reforms. Kang Youwei, the main architect of the Hundred Days’ reforms of 1898, reinterpreted Confucianism to allow for political and social reform. The failure of the early republic and the descent into warlordism led intellectuals to examine the relationship between past and present in China. At the forefront of this was the New Culture Movement, a broad collection of scholars, writers and intellectuals, based mainly in Beijing and Shanghai. Beginning in the mid 1910s they argued that Confucianism and classical philosophy had little relevance or value in 20th century China. For China to survive and prosper, it had to adapt and embrace modern ideas and values.\n\nThe New Culture Movement launched withering attacks on Confucianism, which had sustained the Qing dynasty beyond its usefulness and reinforced outdated social values like hierarchy, paternalism, obedience and unquestioning respect. New Culture writers supported the introduction of Western social and political concepts and values, including democracy, republicanism, self determination, equality and individual liberties. But New Culture advocates recognised these things were not achievable without a significant cultural shift among the Chinese. There could never be a democratic China, they argued, while political authority was reinforced by Confucian teachings, while tradition consistently blocked progress and while patriarchal family structures impeded individual freedoms and the rights of women. Writing in 1916 a Beijing professor said:\n\n“A constitutional republic cannot be conferred by the government, cannot be maintained by one party or one group, and certainly cannot be carried on the backs of a few dignitaries and influential elders. A constitutional republic that does not derive [its authority] from the … majority of the people is a bogus republic and bogus constitutionalism. It is political window-dressing, in no way like the republican constitutionalism of the countries of Europe and America, because there has been no change in the thought or the character of the people.”\n\nThe May Fourth Movement that erupted in 1919 was a show of youthful support for the New Culture Movement, as well as a surge of Chinese nationalism. It was triggered by the publication of the draft Treaty of Versailles, the peace agreement that formally ended World War I. Yuan Shikai’s government had supported the Allies in the war, on the condition that foreign spheres of influence in China be abolished. But by 1919 China had no effective national government, so Chinese negotiators in France found it difficult to push their claims. Chinese interests were consequently overlooked in the Versailles treaty, which handed Germany’s sphere of influence in Shandong over to the Japanese. Angered by China’s shoddy treatment in Paris, and encouraged and supported by many of their professors, radical students at Beijing University began to mobilise. They drafted a manifesto condemning the Versailles treaty and the government representatives who failed to prevent it:\n\n“Japan’s demand for the possession of Qingdao and other rights in Shandong is now going to be acceded to in the Paris Peace Conference. Her diplomacy has secured a great victory – and ours has led to a great failure… This is the last chance for China in her life and death struggle. Today we swear two solemn oaths with all our fellow countrymen. First, China’s territory may be conquered, but it cannot be given away. Second, the Chinese people may be massacred but they will not surrender. Our country is about to be annihilated. Up, brethren!”\n\nOn May 4th 1919 students from Beijing University and 12 other schools and universities gathered in the capitol. They drafted resolutions calling for a mass uprising to oppose the Japanese occupation of Shandong. More than 3,000 protestors assembled in Tiananmen Square, chanting nationalist slogans and urging the Beiyang government not to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. The government responded by dispersing the protestors and arresting almost three dozen of its leaders. The following day Beijing students went on strike, an action quickly replicated by students in other parts of China. In early June up to 100,000 industrial workers in Shanghai declared a week-long general strike, angry at the government’s suppression of students in Beijing and the ongoing detention of student leaders. To the grievances of the students these striking workers added their own, demanding higher wages, better conditions and an end to exploitation. What began as a demonstration by students from one university had become a more expansive national movement involving students, organised labour and political groups. Tensions only eased after the government released student prisoners, sacked several key ministers and instructed its negotiators in Europe not to sign the Versailles treaty.\n\n“May Fourth has become an extremely important but ambiguous notion in all discussions of modern Chinese history. The Communists have sometimes gone so far as to trace the origins of their Party to May Fourth – they saw May Fourth as representing progressive, patriotic elements, as marking the emergence of the working class and as leading to ‘cultural revolution’ – then they treated May Fourth as the necessary condition for the appearance of the CCP. The Nationalists held ambivalent feelings about May Fourth, but the more reformist elements of the GMD identified with its themes of ‘enlightenment’.”\n\nPeter Gue Zarrow, historian\n\nThe May Fourth Movement consequently achieved many of its objectives, however it failed to halt the Japanese takeover of Shandong. The cultural and ideological effects of May Fourth proved more telling. Before the events of 1919, many Chinese reformists had placed their faith in Western models of government and the promises of Chinese independence and self determination made by Western political leaders – but these promises had been broken in Paris. The Treaty of Versailles demonstrated clearly that China could not wait for Western nations to guide it into modernity. China was responsible for its own political development and its own fate. As a consequence, the May Fourth Movement energised and radicalised Chinese political movements. The Chinese Communist Party traces its origins back to the tumultuous weeks of mid-1919. Several notable CCP leaders, including party founder Chen Duxiu and Mao Zedong himself, were involved in or affected by the May Fourth Movement.\n\n1. The May Fourth Movement was a protest by thousands of students in May 1919, in response to China’s treatment in the Treaty of Versailles and the cession of Shandong to the Japanese.\n\n2. The intellectual origins of this movement can be found in the New Culture Movement, a campaign of the 1910s that challenged the role of Confucianism and traditionalism in 20th century China.\n\n3. The writers of the New Culture Movement argued that China could not modernise by clinging to Confucian values and old hierarchies. It had to embrace liberalism, democracy and science.\n\n4. The May Fourth Movement of 1919 started as student protests against the terms of the Versailles treaty. It quickly expanded into a series of nationwide protests and strikes, leading to a backdown by the Beiyang government.\n\n5. The New Culture and May Fourth Movements had a significant impact on Chinese political movements, which stopped looking for Western guidance and became more radical in their outlook and methods.\n\n© Alpha History 2018-23.

Warlordism was to some extent a culmination of internal divisions that emerged in late Qing China. As Qing authority waned, local leaders moved to increase their own power. This fragmentation of political power continued during Yuan Shikai’s presidency. When Shikai attempted to revive the Qing monarchy and reposition himself as emperor, provincial leaders lost what little faith they had the republican national government. When Shikai died without an obvious successor in 1916, China collapsed into divided warlordism. It remained like this until 1927, when much of the country was reunified by Jiang Jieshi and his National Revolutionary Army. The Warlord Era was a period of uncertainty, disorder and conflict that produced very few if any benefits for ordinary Chinese.\n\nThe collapse into warlordism was not surprising, given China’s history. The country’s great size, population, geographical variations and diversity made centralised national government a difficult prospect. This was true even for strong dynasties, however by the late 1800s the Qing was far from strong. The last 20 years of Qing rule produced a steady decline towards decentralisation and provincialism. Local leaders and groups, often encouraged and backed by foreign imperialists, exerted influence and control in their regions. Qing authority and culture remained strong around Beijing and in the north-east of China – but in British-influenced Guangdong, the mountainous regions of central China or on the Tibetan plateau, local leaders became of equal or greater importance than the national government. The late Qing reforms (1901-1910) tried to create a constitutional framework that would strengthen the national government but these reforms failed.\n\nChina’s political disintegration was accelerated by the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the failed republican government of 1912-16. The Xinhai or 1911 Revolution threatened the Qing and instigated the rise of two competing governments. In the north, Beiyang Army commander Yuan Shikai emerged as the strongman of the Chinese Revolution, the only leader with enough military clout to force out the Qing. In the south, nationalists led by Sun Yixian formed a provisional government with some legitimacy but no means of enforcing it. Shikai’s control of the military gave him a pathway to the national presidency, though he had little interest in republicanism. Shikai represented more of the old regime than the new, however, his command over the military held China together and allowed for the continuation of national government. While Shikai sat in the president’s chair, provincial warlords did little to challenge his government, fearing military retaliation. That Shikai’s power was derived from military strength has led some to dub him the “father of the warlords” or the “first warlord”.\n\n“The widespread disorder and violence of the war-lord period disrupted foreign trade as well as endangering foreigners. At the same time, the impotence of the central government during the warlord years served as an open invitation to foreigners to fish in China’s troubled waters. Foreign influence occurred in several ways and at several levels, but the two most important involved further control over China’s economic resources and supplying aid to selected warlords. Japan was by far the worst offender in using warlord disunity to force new concessions from China. The other powers were satisfied to wring the maximum profit from the privileges already permitted under treaties from the Qing era.”\n\nJames E. Sheridan, historian\n\nWhen Yuan Shikai died in June 1916 it created a national power vacuum that was quickly filled by the warlords. Now leaderless, the national army itself broke apart, its regiments or divisions falling under the control of powerful provincial leaders, who claimed them as private armies. Nowhere was this process more visible than in northern China. Yuan Shikai’s Beiyang Army quickly disintegrated and its personnel were swallowed up by three competing warlord factions: the Zhili clique (led by Feng Guozhang), the Anhui clique (Duan Qirui) and the Fengtian clique (Zhang Zuolin). Warlords sought to increase their power by increasing the size of their armies. This was occasionally done by conscription or coercion but usually through enticement. Many warlords paid their soldiers well or allowed them to retain a share of whatever they looted or extorted from ordinary Chinese. In rural areas ravaged by poverty, ‘taking up with the bandits’ became an attractive career option, particularly for young single men. According to historian Hsi-Sheng Chi this economic desperation fuelled a rapid growth in the size of warlord armies: from around 500,000 in late 1916 to more than one million in 1918 and two million in 1928.\n\nIt is difficult to form general conclusions about China’s warlords: they were a diverse group with different qualities, methods, attitudes and objectives. Several warlords were former officers in the Qing military; others were provincialists or outsiders who had never belonged the Qing establishment. Some were traditionalists who clung to dynastic and Confucian ideals; others were progressives who recognised the fundamental changes taking place in China. Some of the stronger warlords fancied themselves as potential ‘unifiers’, hoping to conquer enough territory to restore a national government – with themselves as emperor or president, of course. Apart from their use of military force, the most common goal shared by warlords was to make themselves rich. The exploitation, corruption and banditry that flourished under warlordism had dire effects on the ordinary people. Warlords printed excessive amounts of paper money to fund their armies, leading to high inflation. They seized control of government infrastructure and privately-owned businesses. They imposed new taxes and raised existing ones (in one warlord province land tax increased fivefold). Aware of its profitability, many warlords also revived the trade in opium, compelling farmers to grow it and encouraging its open sale. The private armies of warlords were often a law unto themselves, behaving recklessly, harassing and assaulting locals and stealing or destroying their property.\n\nNot all warlords were driven entirely by greed. A handful behaved like benevolent dictators, their leadership based on political pragmatism and some concern for the people they ruled. One of these was Yan Xishan (Wade-Giles: Yen Hsi-Shan) who ruled in Shanxi province. Yan was well educated, a career soldier in the Qing military and a former advocate of Self-Strengthening. Unlike other warlords, he focused on improving and modernising Shanxi, rather than expanding territory or amassing a personal fortune. Yan entered into alliances to keep Shanxi out of conflict with other warlords, while introducing social reforms, like the abolition of foot binding and improvements to girls’ education. Feng Yuxian, a northern warlord who later captured Beijing and aligned with the Guomindang, outlawed foot binding, prostitution and opium trafficking in areas under his command. He also encouraged his soldiers to convert to Christianity, sometimes ‘baptising’ entire companies of men with a fire hose.\n\nDuring the Warlord Era a national government continued in Beijing, however, it did was not representative and exerted no national control. The Beiyang government, as it was known, presented as a civilian parliamentary government. In reality, it was a front for the dominant warlord or warlord faction in Beijing. Control of the capital was a financial bonanza for warlords. The Beiyang government, despite its illegitimacy, was still recognised by foreign powers. Foreign merchants continued to make massive payments for duties and import taxes, money that went to local warlords. This revenue made Beijing and its surrounds a rich prize for competing warlord factions, who warred constantly over the capital. In 1920 the Zhili and Anhui cliques fought a brief but bloody war over Beijing, the Zhili warlords emerging victorious. In mid-1922 the Zhili faction defended Beijing from an attempted takeover by the northern Fengtian clique. The Fengtian warlords, led by Zhang Zuolin, reassembled and returned in September 1924, expelling the Zhili and seizing control of the Beiyang government. These constant struggles made the Beiyang government changeable and unstable: it had seven different heads of state and more than two dozen different ministries between 1916 and 1928.\n\nThe warlord period was one of political division, instability, corruption and self-interest, economic stagnation and social repression. While some warlords formed ties with wealthy business elites, the uncertainty and instability of the period were not conducive to economic progress or the development of new industries. A handful of warlords attempted social reform but none that entailed significant investment or innovation. There were few sincere and meaningful attempts to improve the lives of ordinary people. The majority of Chinese, particularly the rural peasantry, suffered more under the warlords than they had under the Qing. Large numbers of peasants were driven from their land, which was often parcelled off to private soldiers. By 1925 the number of unemployed in China was estimated at more than 168 million, more than half of them peasants and farm labourers. By this stage, Sun Yixian’s nationalists and their new-found allies, the Moscow Comintern and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), were planning the end of warlordism. From their stronghold in the southern province of Guangdong, the Guomindang and its military arm, the National Revolutionary Army, were preparing to move against the warlords and reunite China by force.\n\n1. The Warlord Era was a period of political fragmentation and regional militarism in China, beginning with the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916 and ending in 1927.\n\n2. Warlordism was caused in part by growing provincial power in the last half-century of Qing rule, the emergence of powerful local leaders and the failure of republican government under Shikai.\n\n3. The warlords and warlord factions used private or provincial armies to exert and expand their control. Most warlords and warlord soldiers were motivated by economic greed.\n\n4. A few warlords were progressive minded and attempted social reforms. In general terms, however, the lives of Chinese peasants was noticeably worse under warlordism than it had been under the Qing.\n\n5. A national government operated in Beijing during the Warlord Era and profited from foreign trade, duties and taxes. This government was controlled by warlords and was neither truly representative or legitimate.\n\n© Alpha History 2018. Content on this page may not be republished or distributed without permission.
