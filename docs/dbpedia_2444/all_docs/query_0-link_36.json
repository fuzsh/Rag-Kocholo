        "text": "Ahead of the swift and deadly German spring offensive begun in March 1918, Luton's Prisoner of War Fund was providing parcels to 31 local PoWs. Within a short period of time that number would soar, and many of the men captured were featured in local newspapers in the ensuing weeks.\n\nIt was a time of uncertainty for parents, wives and girlfriends. Had their loved one been killed or wounded in action, or was he a prisoner of the Germans? It would be several weeks before they got an answer, in some cases a happier result than previously informed with a son/husband/brother/boyfriend at least alive, even if in enemy hands.\n\nFor example, reports in two Luton newspapers of the death in action in March 1918 of Pte Wesley (Machine Gun Corps), of 32 Langley [now Latimer] Road, Luton, proved happily to be exaggerated, even though an officer wrote to his widow the following month to say the death was \"almost instantaneous, and I do not think he suffered much pain\".\n\nBoth The Saturday Telegraph ( April 13th, 1918) and The Luton Reporter (April 16th, 1918) included stories of the death of Pte Edward Wesley, thanks to military information supplied. In fact, the Luton soldier's name was Edmund Wesley, and neither the name Edward Wesley nor Edmund Wesley appears on the Luton Roll of Honour or the Commonwealth War Graves Commission website.\n\nBut a search of the Red Cross prisoners of war records has revealed that Lutonian Pte Edmund Wesley, 104671, 56th Machine Gun Corps, was taken as a prisoner of war at Gavrelle in France on March 28th, 1918, and ended up in Parchim camp, near Hamburg. He had served in France for eight months when taken prisoner.\n\nEdmund survived the war and died in Luton in 1959, at the age of 72. Before enlisting he had been employed at Mr Poulton's butcher's shop in Stuart Street. He married Gertrude May Patten in Luton in early 1917.\n\nPte Frederick Gatward, 88016, 76th Field Ambulance Royal Army Medical Corps, was captured as a prisoner of war in France on May 27th, 1918, and interned at Limburg in Germany.\n\nHis Red Cross record has few details other than he was repatriated via Dover on December 1st, 1918. He had written to friends to say he was well in captivity but needed more food.\n\nFrederick was a son of Maria and the late George William Gatward. He was born in London in 1892 and came with his family to Luton as a child.\n\nIn the 1911 Census he was described as a straw plait dyer's labourer living with his family at 79 Boyle Street, Luton. He had been employed by bleachers and dyers Hart Baxter & Co, New Bedford Road, Luton.\n\nIn 1922, William married Yorkshire girl Maud Louisa Boxford in Luton. He died in Luton in 1969 at the age of 77, having lived at 26 Talbot Road.\n\nPte Horace Frederick Hudson, 52248, 9th Battalion Welsh Regiment, was captured as a prisoner of war while serving as orderly to an officer at Montigny in France on May 30th, 1918. He was interned at Cassel and later Chemnitz in Germany.\n\nHorace joined the Bedfordshire Regiment in November 1916, at the age of 19. He did his training at Landguard in Suffolk and, after leave, was sent to France in January 1917 and transferred to the Welsh Regiment. He served most of his time in the front line trenches around Ypres, and took part in the advance against the Prussian Guards. He came home on leave in January 1918 before returning to France.\n\nSince his capture, parents Frederick and Hannah Louisa Hudson, of South View, High Street, Leagrave, had received only two postcards from their son, the last arriving on October 30th, 1918, when he said he was in fairly good health but very weak.\n\nHorace was born in Leagrave on November 21st, 1897. His father was a coal merchant, and Horace had a younger sister, Gladys Louisa, and younger brother, Reginald.\n\nFollowing repatriation, Horace married Lillie Squires in 1923 and they had three children – Eric (born 1927), Keith (1930) and Noreen (1934). At the time of his death at the age of 81 in December 1978, Horace was residing at 10 Capron Road, Leagrave.\n\nPte William Arthur Mead, G/18327, 2nd Battalion Royal Sussex Regiment, was taken prisoner at St Quentin on September 24th, 1918, and interned at Giessen and later Cassel in Germany. His sister at 9 Guildford Street, Luton, was informed of his fate in early November.\n\nHe had joined the colours at the outbreak of war, when he gave his age as 18, although he was only 16. He received a gunshot wound in the upper jaw six months later and was discharged in December 1915 due to his mis-statement of his age. He was recalled to the front on reaching the age of 18.\n\nBefore enlisting he was living at 26 Cobden Street, Luton. He appears to have been repatriated and may have married and lived at Slip End. He was awarded the 1914-15, British War and Victory Medals.\n\nPte Alfred 'Jock' Norris, 33064, 8th Battalion Leicestershire Regiment, was interned as a prisoner of war at Langensalza in Germany, where sadly he died of pleurisy and pneumonia on October 23rd, 1918.\n\nBorn in Slip End in January 1891 to Alfred and Alice Norris, he had joined up with the Bedfordshire Regiment (4893) in 1914. He transferred to the Leicesters in 1916 and was captured at Comicy, north of Rheims in France, on May 27th, 1918. His family first knew of his fate when he wrote saying he was well, and asking for food.\n\nHe had served in France for seven months before his capture. Previously he had gone missing for four days but managed to get back safely to his regiment.\n\nBefore joining up, Alfred, who lived with his family at 8 Church Street, Slip End, and was one of four serving brothers, had worked for plait merchant Mr J. J. Linsell, of George Street, Luton. He was described in his military records as a warehouse clerk.\n\nPte John Thomas Webb, 40291, 6th Battalion Leicestershire Regiment, was interned at Crossen in Germany after being taken as a prisoner of war in France on May 27th, 1918.\n\nHe had been wounded in 1916 and again in the spring offensive of 1918, but in a letter to his mother at Farley Green, near Luton, he said he was well but would appreciate a parcel.\n\nBorn on September 7th, 1888, he was a son of John Thomas and Ellen Webb, of Farley Green. At the time of the 1911 Census he was described as a horseman on a farm.\n\nTwo brothers – Joe and Charles – were killed in action in July 1916 within a few days of each other. Two other brothers were also serving at the time of John's capture, one in France and the other in Egypt.\n\nCpl William Sale, 16035, 7th Battalion Bedfordshire Regiment, was interned as a prisoner of war at Gustrow in Germany after being captured unwounded at Morlancourt in France on August 6th, 1918. He was later transferred to the Parchim camp.\n\nWilliam was one of the earliest of Luton's volunteers and was in khaki within a month of the outbreak of war. He had since seen three years service in France and was wounded in the shoulder just over a year before his capture.\n\nBorn in Luton on July 5th, 1890, William was a straw warehouseman at the time of the 1911 Census, but before joining up he worked at George Kent's. Parents George and Annie Sale were living at 19 Brook Street, Luton, when they learned of his capture.\n\nRepatriated William married Luton girl Victoria Augusta Ellerd How in Luton in the summer of 1920 and had a son, Clarence, in 1921, and a daughter, Barbara, in 1923.\n\nThe couple lived in Portland Road, later Ashburnham Road and finally at 67 Montrose Avenue, Luton, prior to William's death in 1969 at the age of 79.

I know his work was successfully completed, and that your husband and the two sappers working with him left the scene of their operations in good health. There was little or no shelling or machine gun fire at that time, about five in the evening on April 10th.\n\n“Since that hour we have lost all trace of the three sappers who constituted the party. Other sappers who were out on similar work, in the confusion of the retreat, got mixed up with other units and were lost to us for a week or more. They have all reported now, and the group of which your husband was one is the only one unaccounted for.\n\n“The enemy had made a small raid on the line along which the party may have retired, and it is very possible they fell into his hands. Personally I do not think the party has come to any serious bodily harm. It is extremely unlikely that all three would be killed by a shell, or that no trace would have been found of them. I am therefore very hopeful that we may hear of theme as prisoners at any time.”\n\nSapper Kindred had joined the Royal Engineers in August 1915 and underwent training at Maidenhead and Marlow before being drafted to France a year before his capture.\n\nThe son of Arthur and Naomi Kindred, of 109 Russell Street, Luton, he was born in 1892 and had been employed as a printer by Barnard & Dawson, of King Street, Luton.
