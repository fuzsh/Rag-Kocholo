I know it's large, but it seems like it would fit a very large amount of great, high quality late war scenarios in it... Thoughts?",

        "text": "i guess there are already some ideas on new ww2 maps, would be very interesting to hear from ED what they consider to happen in the future.\n\nfleshing out normandy would be awesome and a first for me too, maybe its even possible to extend it.\n\ni think a south pacific map would be pretty easy to make because of the very large water mass and it shouldnt hit performance like for example europe and the third reich with its large cities and what not. i loved pacific strike back on my 386, one of my favorites back then. A south pacific scenario would need at least two planes on both sides and alot of ai and that would take alot of time.\n\nIt would be awesome if some or even all of the third parties and ED would work together on releasing ww2 birds/maps/ai so we could have complete scenarios in the developemnt time of one. What a great idea xD\n\nSure but if You look now the WWII community is small and I didn't think that new aircrafts alone could revamp it...You need a game changer...and probably at the moment the competition on the western and eastern front that come from the IL2 series is too great to overcome...\n\nSo...release a new scenario, the Pacific, with (this is the game changer for me) the carrier operations...and with at least 4 flyable aircraft (2 USA and 2 Japan) and 2/4 others AI only per side...\n\nIt will be one of the coolest scenario in WWII and without competition to fight.\n\nPacific maps are a total waste until we have at least 2 relevant opposing aircraft (at least!) and relevant AI assets. The OP map is the map that should have been built from the start for DCS, at least the eastern half of it. That way, the AI pack carry over just fine, the existing planeset get their proper setting, and we are a step closer to realizing the potential of DCS WW2. The Tip of England would of course be a huge boost (once again) since it allows for escort missions of B-17's as well as plausible scenarios for 41-43 as well. I just hope it will be the crew that made the PG map that would make it, and that they would continue the trend of blending sat images for high alt, and artist textures for low alt. It would be a godsend, but I am not hyping myself as I did for Normandy.\n\nWhile a Pacific Map would be the Gold Standard if it came out before the competition with the detailed Carrier ops that it appears DCS World is capable of delivering, the elephant in the room is as Philstyle points out, the 6 to ten years to get, map, assets and player a/c ready for early access.\n\nThe Pacific would play to DCS's strengths ( Carrier ops, high Fidelity FM, SM etc) and downplay it's weaknesses.\n\nThe small land mass would make development faster presumably. Most islands would not require any details at all since they were unoccupied atolls etc.\n\nDCS is not good in multiplayer with any amount of ground unit movement and small islands would naturally limit movement and largely could be mostly eliminated by carefully selected scenarios.\n\nThe campaign was primarily air and sea so most battles could be done convincingly with no ground forces. With DCS map size and most of it being ocean you could cover most of the AO for the Coral Sea or Solomon islands on a map.\n\nED would need to put out one of those maps (quick), two player a/c, an F4F and an early A6M2. They would need to make a handful of AI, Dauntless,\n\nDevastator, A5M, Val, Kate and Betty. Oh and four fleet carriers, a Japanese light carrier, a USN cruiser, destroyer, oiler etc and an IJN cruiser destroyer, minesweeper, tug, supply ships etc.\n\nThis would be like putting the patient on the transplant list for a new heart, what we need now is a transfusion to keep the patient alive.\n\nThe planeset that we have now and the ones that we are aware are confirmed, less the I-16 and P-40, make the most sense in the AO proposed by the OP.\n\nThe map lends itself to the strategic, operational and tactical levels. It would cover the time period from 1943 to the end of the war, meaning additional a/c development could be supported by those already released at each end.\n\nThe problem is that it is a huge landmass and development will be slower. FPS will be more affected than open water. Ground forces moving will cause problems.\n\nI think what we need to reinvigorate DCS WWII is AI aircraft, allied AAA, trains and ground vehs that work (follow tracks or trucks that follow roads) and placeable airfield zones with appropriate buildings ( hangar, windsock , control van etc.) To flesh them out. And, a roadmap specifically for WWII from ED outlining the vision of what they are going to do and what is open for third parties, and some very general timelines\n\nThe OP map would be great, but we need to keep enough interest in DCS WWII to get there.\n\nED is making FC type aircraft. Perhaps their goal is too make these and maps that do not take the better part of a decade to code. Trying to code for the latest API with current software has added another layer of time consuming work. ED is also trying to use the Vulkan API which also adds another layer.\n\nFrom what I have read, ED has an enormous amount on their plate. They are trying to add more staff. Adding anything new at this time is unreasonable.\n\nDeveloping software that is Pre-Released Alpha style which is released only for those who have time and patience to bug-hunt/troubleshoot this software, leads IMHO to think that this is a big turn-off for new customers who think the software is so full of bugs and problems, its not worth buying. Labeling software as Beta, is also an indication that it is not finished and turns off potential customers.\n\nIts great to see new aircraft but many of the systems are not ready and maps are unfinished. It takes 2 to 6 months and sometimes years to get a finished product.\n\nAnd you guys are wanting new maps/aircraft? Let ED stitch together what they have now."
