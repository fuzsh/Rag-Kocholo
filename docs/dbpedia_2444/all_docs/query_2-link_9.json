        "text": "One of the books I read on the conference has this opinion:\n\n“Take Munich. A disaster, right? But since when does a peace conference that actually produces peace a disaster?” Note: I don’t own the book, so it may not be the exact words, but this is basically what it says.\n\nThe book also mentions that British was not strong enough to take on Germany, Italy and Japan, so the British decided to remove one of them by appeasement. It also asks the question of whether it would have been more honorable (and morally correct) to do appeasement or fight a war that Britain will lose? The book says that the mistake of Britain and France was not appeasement, but letting Germany get so powerful that by 1938 there was no choice but appeasement.\n\nWhat do you think of this view? Thank you for responding in advance!\n\nHave you ever heard of the book called If The Allies Had Fallen? It examines many what ifs of World War 2, with all of them very grounded in reality. A lot of the chapters are written very differently, from basically scholarly analysis to what the history books would have said had the timeline changed in the way described. If you had read the book, what do you think? Thank you!\n\nAlso on the subject of Italian POWs: some Italians captured by the British in North Africa ended up being interned in the Orkney Islands, where they were put to work constructing concrete barriers to seal off the eastern entry route into Scapa Flow (the route taken by U47 when it torpedoed the battleship Royal Oak in October 1939). Sometimes, arguments would break out between the Italians and the British personnel supervising the work, and an Army interpreter would be called in to sort out the dispute. After one such altercation, a Navy officer took the interpreter aside and asked him why he had been translating for the Italian man who’d been complaining, saying that, “This fellow can speak English!” The interpreter retorted that the man couldn’t “even speak Italian!” – an answer which no doubt baffled the Navy officer until the prisoner later confided that he’d been speaking in dialect.
