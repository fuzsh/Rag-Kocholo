        "text": "The Men of East Elgin Who Made The Supreme Sacrifice\n\nin the First Great War, 1914 – 1918\n\nJames L. McCallum\n\n© Ontario Genealogical Society, Elgin County Branch – September 2008\n\nPublished by Ontario Genealogical Society, Elgin County Branch,\n\nAll rights reserved. No part of this publication may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form, or by any means – electronic, mechanical, photocopying, microform reproduction, recording, or otherwise – without the prior written permission of the publisher.\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we who are left grow old\n\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn\n\nAt the going down of the sun, and in the morning\n\nWe will remember them – Laurence Binyon\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept for this publication was inspired by similar works compiled by the Southwold Township Veterans Committee and Harley Lashbrook of West Lorne. On a more personal level, as a child living in Malahide Township, I remember vividly walking by the Aylmer cenotaph on the way to the Post Office with my mother and grandfather, and we always seemed to pause as we passed by. My grandfather would explain to me that those were the names of the men who gave their lives during the two world wars. As an adult, returning to my home town as often as I could to attend Remembrance Day services at the cenotaph, I became aware of the fact that even though we were there to remember, the identity of the men from the First Great War had become clouded through time. Except for later generations of family members who might be aware that a relative’s name was inscribed on the cenotaph, I expect the majority of Aylmer and Malahide citizens are unaware of who these men were and what their family connections are. That statement is not meant to imply that anyone has forgotten the sacrifice these men made, it is simply a fact that over ninety years later there are few living persons who would have remembered these men personally.\n\nThe scope of this project is to include every man who lost his life during the First Great War with a connection to the Town of Aylmer, and the Townships of Malahide, Bayham and South Dorchester. To define “connection”, I have included men who were born in the above places but had moved away prior to enlisting, men who were living there upon enlistment, and several others who had family connections reaching back a generation further. My starting point was the names inscribed on the cenotaphs in Aylmer, Port Burwell, Vienna, and the Richmond West Veteran’s Memorial. I obtained a great many more names from indexes to local newspapers which reported deaths of men with connections to the area.\n\nMy goal was to identify who each man was by viewing their Attestation Paper, locating their registration of birth, finding a newspaper article about their death and including a photograph. Because my primary interest is genealogy and this publication is being prepared for the Elgin County Branch of the Ontario Genealogical Society, I also wanted to include some genealogical and biographical material about the family’s roots and the relatives left behind to mourn the sacrifice made by their loved one. Therefore you will find information about the parents of these men, in most cases an obituary, and brief information on their siblings. Despite diligent research, information on some families was not as plentiful as others.\n\nSeveral articles of interest were found in the Aylmer Express dealing with the recruitment of men at the beginning of the war, the celebration of the armistice and the erection of the War Memorial in Aylmer. I have also included letters from the men overseas that were published in the newspaper. Unfortunately, photographs for many of the men could not be found.\n\nAs with any publication of this nature, there are bound to be errors and omissions, and I apologize if anyone was missed.\n\nThis is the first in a planned four volume set. The remaining three publications will attempt to list all the men and women who served in the First Great War from the above municipalities, with a volume each for (1) Aylmer & Malahide, (2) Springfield & South Dorchester, and (3) Bayham.\n\nI am indebted to Ian Raven and the staff of the Elgin Military Museum in St. Thomas for their assistance in locating files and pictures of these men, and to Pat Temple, an enthusiastic researcher from the Southwold Veterans Committee whose interest, advice and research assistance for my project has been invaluable. Much of my research was conducted at the St. Thomas Public Library, the Aylmer Public Library, and the Elgin County Archives. Appreciation is given to the Elgin County Archives for permission to use several pictures from the Scott-Sefton Collection. I would also like to thank each and every one who supplied information and pictures for this publication.\n\nAbbreviations: CEF – Canadian Expeditionary Forces; CFA – Canadian Field Artillery – COTC – Canadian Officer Training Corps; CAMC – Canadian Army Medical Corps\n\nCONTENTS\n\nBrief History of Recruiting in Elgin & the 91st Battalion\n\nRecruiting in Aylmer (articles in the Aylmer Express)\n\nAylmer Celebrates the Armistice\n\nAylmer Erects a War Memorial\n\nSpringfield Erects a War Memorial\n\nNames from the Aylmer Cenotaph\n\nNames from the Port Burwell Cenotaph\n\nNames from the Vienna Cenotaph\n\nNames from the Richmond West Cemetery Memorial\n\nNames found in the Aylmer Express\n\nNames found in other sources\n\nBrief History of Recruiting in Elgin & the 91st Battalion\n\nWhen Britain declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914, Elgin County responded ten days later when three members of the 25th Elgin Regiment enlisted in the signal section of the 1st Canadian Division. Then on August 22, one hundred men from Elgin County, including sixty one from the 25th Regiment went to Valcartier to join the 1st Battalion C.E.F. They went overseas on October 7, 1914.\n\nRecruiting in Elgin County continued with 200 men sent to the 18th Battalion C.E.F. and 256 men to the 33rd Battalion C.E.F\n\nElgin County’s own overseas battalion was formed on October 25, 1915. Lt.-Col. Green was placed in command of the 91st Battalion C.E.F., and trained 940 men for overseas service. The battalion received its colours on May 24, 1916 after a parade through St. Thomas, ending at Pinafore Park with a huge crowd attending the ceremony.\n\nA month later on June 25, 1916, the 91st Battalion was dispatched overseas after a march down Talbot Street in St. Thomas, witnessed by a crowd of 20,000 citizens. They went by train to Halifax where they sailed on the ship Olympic on June 28, arriving in Liverpool on July 5. After ten days at Otterpool Camp, the Battalion was transferred to the 3rd Canadian Training Brigade and split up in order to provide reinforcements for more than twenty three other units on the battlefield. It was standard policy by this time for county regiments to divide their recruits among other units whose numbers had been depleted of manpower.\n\nWhile the 91st Battalion was in Europe, recruiting continued in Elgin, resulting in over 2,400 men from the county volunteering for service during the course of the war.\n\nSource: The Elgins, by Capt. L. A. Curchin & Lieut. B. D. Sim, Regiment Historian, 1977\n\nRecruiting in Aylmer\n\nSeveral articles appeared in the Aylmer Express, reporting on the recruiting process from that area. They are presented here in chronological order.\n\nThe Aylmer Express, September 10, 1914:\n\nFIRST RECRUIT DRILL OF THE 30TH BATTERY\n\nWill be Tomorrow Night at 7:30 p.m.\n\nNames are Coming in Fast. Get Your Name in Before Tomorrow Night\n\nHave you joined the 30th Battery? This is the question for every able bodied man in East Elgin. This is our own militia unit and is being raised by the people of this county for the defense of our own borders. No man who values his home or his loved ones, who believes in his country or honors his King will refuse to join. The task before our own people here in Canada and possibly in Elgin may be very serious before this war is over. If our shores were invaded by a hostile army every man would be a soldier if he could; but he would be no use without training. This is the point. The time to get the training is now. The 30th Battery Canadian Field Artillery requires at once one hundred men. The battery roll is at Mr. Wm. Warnock’s office in Aylmer. The young men of East Elgin should enlist. They should do it at once.\n\nThe first recruit drill will be held at 7:30 p.m., Friday, Sept. 11. The men will form up on Talbot St. in front of the new post office. The elements of infantry drill will be taught. Every man should be on hand for the first drill. Lt.-Col. Walter James Brown will be in charge.\n\nSo far as Canadians and Britishers are concerned military service is no longer optional. It is a duty that no true man will shirk. Only those who have the necessary physical qualifications will be asked to go on duty; but the obligation of working and fighting for our country is on the shoulders of every man. No one is exempt. Every man in Canada between 18 and 60 may be called if required. It would be an outrage if Canadians were forced to use the ballot to fill the ranks of the militia. Let us have volunteers. This is your opportunity. The Canadian Militia is a home defense force, organized, trained and maintained for the defense of our own homes and loved one. Every man should be a citizen soldier. Will you?\n\nThe Aylmer Express, October 8, 1914\n\nTHE 30TH BATTERY\n\nBusy Drilling\n\nThe 30th Battery Canadian Field Artillery has been drilling two nights a week for nearly a month and has apparently made excellent progress. There is still room for a number of recruits. There seems to be a misunderstanding about enlisting. Let it be understood once and for all that the 30th Battery is a home defense unit, and no member of the Battery can be sent overseas unless he volunteers for this special service. The Battery with all other Militia units is for the defense of Canada only. The age limits are 18 to 60; but a few boys will be accepted to act as signallers, rangetakers, trumpeters, etc. The term of enlistment is for three years unless discharged or resignation is accepted before the term expires.\n\nThe Battery has been taught the elements of infantry drill and are now learning dismounted artillery drill without arms. As soon as rifles are issued, rifle drill and shooting will be taught. Field artillery men are expected to know foot drill, mounted drill, rifle shooting and gunnery and certain forms of field engineering. It is hoped that arrangements may be made so lectures, rifle shooting and physical drill and exercises may be undertaken during the winter months in a suitable building.\n\nThe Battery needs 28 drivers who will bring at least two horses each. The horses will be needed only for annual training or for field days. The pay for drivers is about $1 a day and for the horses $1.25 each with everything for men and horses found. This means that each driver will receive about $56 for himself and team for the sixteen days camp once a year. Most battery drivers consider this “money found” as the camps are held during the seasons when work is slack on the farms. Most batteries have more men and horses offering than they can take to camp. The drivers who enlist now will be given the first chance. Mr. William Warnock has the Service Roll and is authorized to take enrollments.\n\nThe Aylmer Express, November 19, 1914:\n\nOFF FOR THE FRONT\n\nLieutenant Clarke had no difficulty in recruiting the quota of twenty assigned Aylmer for the battery of Field Artillery now being mobilized at London. As a matter of fact, several over the number required made application. One of these, Thomas Randel, of West Lorne, passed the examiner all right, and was a most disappointed young man when he failed to secure his mother’s consent. Two others from Tillsonburg made application, when but one was required for the full compliment, but as they refused to be separated, neither of them were taken.\n\nOne of the recruits deserves special mention. He is Luther Arven Cooper, a sturdy hunter and trapper, 6 feet, 2 inches in height, who started out from McKenzie River, 4000 miles away, determined to serve his country. He made his way from point to point offering himself, only to find there was no place for him, until he reached Aylmer, where he was just in time. He ran out of funds and notwithstanding the intense cold, rode on the outside of railway coaches as opportunity offered.\n\nThe full list is as follows:\n\nAlfred Benson, Aylmer, butcher, single, 30th Battery Canadian Field Artillery\n\nSamuel Horace Hawkins, Aylmer, marble cutter, married, 30th Battery, C.F.A.\n\nHarold Hale, Tillsonburg, farmer\n\nArthur St. John Wallace, Aylmer, cook and baker, single, Territorial Army service,\n\n18 months, 30th Battery, C.F.A.\n\nAlbert Victor Weir, St. Thomas, car inspector, single, Royal Navy, 5 years, 4 months\n\nJohn Leslie Parker, Aylmer, painter, single, 30th Battery, C.F.A.\n\nEdward Christopher Payton Breay, Aylmer, farmer, single, Officers Training Corps, 2 years\n\nCharles Dingle, Aylmer, shoe cutter, single, 30th Battery, C.F.A.\n\nReginald John Denton, Aylmer, farmer, single\n\nHarold Duxbury, Springfield, farmer, single\n\nGeorge Albert Morden, Delhi, engineer, single, Sergeant No. 8 Company, 39th Regiment, 3 years\n\nHarry John Richardson, Aylmer, brick layer, married, 30th Battery, C.F.A.\n\nLuther Arven Cooper, McKenzie River, hunter and trapper, single, 10th Westminster Fusileers\n\nThomas Cornish, St. Thomas, storekeeper, single, 25th Regiment, 1 year\n\nWilliam James Sweeting, Fenwick, carpenter, widower\n\nSydney Frederick Hudson, Glencoe, undertaker, single, 26th Regiment, Middlesex Light Infantry\n\nGerald Tighe, Aylmer, farmer, single\n\nRoland Gatward, Aylmer, tailor, single, 30th Battery, C.F.A.\n\nHarry Lucey, St. Thomas, barber, single.\n\nBetween 600 and 700 citizens were present when the boys lined up on Talbot street yesterday morning, and rousing cheers were given them, as, headed by the Citizens Band, and followed by the members of the 30th Battery and citizens they marched to the Wabash depot to entrain for London.\n\nWhile waiting for their train the recruits were addressed by Mayor Wagner, Rev. C. Miles and W. Harold Barnum. The occasion proved a very impressive one, the more so when one loving mother was overcome, in the fear that she might never see her boy again. There were few dry eyes, even one of the speakers finding it impossible to express himself for some moments.\n\nThe boys, however, with brave hearts, broke into song, which relieved the tension, were photographed, the hat was passed for their benefit, and they boarded the train amid the cheers and best wishes of some 500 citizens. Ray Lemon, of Richard’s & Co., gave each of the boys a Rexall Shaving stick before they left. Lieut. Clarke accompanied them to London.\n\nFred D. King, W. Harold Barnum and Harold Hambidge accompanied the volunteers as far as St. Thomas, and after leaving Aylmer, the brakeman came to Mr. Barnum and told him they had on board a Belgian soldier who had been a prisoner of the Germans, but had escaped, also a British soldier, Rupert Gilhooley, discharged because no longer physically fit. Mr. Barnum discovered the Belgian’s name was Albert Kappen, his home was at Alost, and that he had lost everything in the war. He had a Belgian passport and Belgian identification card, with photo attached. The two were on their way to Detroit.\n\nThey came up to the Aylmer volunteers and the Belgian cried, “Vive les Canadiens” and in return three good Canadian cheers were given the Belgian. Mr. Barnum says he could not speak enough French to find out any further particulars. Cheers for the volunteers, and the Belgian mentioned, were given by the passengers on board, and the journey to St. Thomas was a very interesting one.\n\nThe Aylmer Express, November 26, 1914:\n\nANOTHER LETTER FROM THE SOLDIERS AT LONDON\n\nLondon, Nov. 23rd, 1914\n\nThe Aylmer Express\n\nDear Editor –\n\nWe thought that we would write you of our experience from Aylmer to London and while in camp. As far as St. Thomas, you have already heard what happened through Harold Barnum, who accompanied us that far. Nothing happened from there to London, except “Are we downhearted?” “NO”\n\nOn our arrival at the G. T. R. Station here we were met by Lieut.-Col. Brown, and a company of infantry, which escorted us to Queen’s Park. They sang “It’s a long way to Tipperary”, and we finished with “It’s a long way to St. Helena”. We were taken directly to our barrack-room and only had to wait about one hour for dinner, which was a lunch consisting of a little jam and a couple of slices of “punk”. Some dinner.\n\nNow we are squared away and everything is running very smooth. Jack Wallis is a good cook and feeds us very well, there being no fault found with the grub. We are roused out of bed at 6:30 each morning. Then we make up our cots and sweep out, go out at 7 o’clock for half-hour physical drill, have breakfast at eight, bacon, jam, punk and coffee. From 9 – 10 we have foot drill, then a half-hour rest. Then from 10:30 to 11:30 we get some more. We get dinner at 12:30 which is a change every day. From 2 to 3 o’clock we drill again, then another recess. Then from 3:30 to 4:30 which is the last drill of the day. We get our supper at 5 o’clock. Any time after 5 o’clock we can leave the grounds without a pass but we must be in at 9:30.\n\nWe were told by an officer it was better to get a pass to 12 o’clock than to go down town, meet a friend and stay out later that 9:30, for that means guard house. The officers are very nice men but we won’t say they are any better than Col. Brown.\n\nCharles Dingle and some of the boys from Aylmer are on fatigue duty toady, the rest will get theirs after awhile. There is about 3 inches of snow here this morning so we did not drill, had lectures by the officers instead. Our barrack-room is heated with two furnaces, dining room with one. Off the barrack-room is the shower baths, hot and cold.\n\nThe Y.M.C.A. have a canteen where we can buy anything we want. They put on a picture show every night which is free. They also supply writing paper and ink. If it is not too much trouble to you would you ask the S. O. E. lodge if we could have the old flag from their room?\n\nThanking you in advance for the space and wishing the Express great prosperity, we remain, THE AYLMER BOYS\n\nAlfred Benson, Harry Richardson (Highland Mary), John Wallis (Head Cook), John Denton, Harold Duxbury, John Parker, Charles Dingle, James Sweeting, Thomas Cornish, George Morden, Samuel Hawkins, E.

During that length of time 229 men offered themselves for their country’s service. Out of this number 85 could not pass the medical examination, and 144 were successful in getting into the ranks. There are now about 900 men in the 91st Battalion, which is still far from being up to full strength. The officers are determined not to let the campaign terminate yet, and will put more ginger than ever into their efforts to secure recruits.\n\nThe List\n\nBrooks, Roland, Aylmer, single, 30th Battery\n\nCanning, George Whitney, married, 30th Battery\n\nWalker, Harry, Aylmer, married\n\nEllis, George A., Aylmer, married, 30th Battery\n\nWalker, William Stephen, Aylmer, single, 30th Battery\n\nCable, Leo Carl, Aylmer, 30th Battery\n\nBlashill, Harry Arthur, Aylmer, married\n\nGriffin, Howard, Aylmer, single\n\nMcDonald, John, Aylmer, 30th Battery\n\nWood, Beverley Edward, Aylmer, single, H.

They left St. Thomas on Sunday on their trip across the Dominion to the seaboard, there to be transported across the Atlantic to England, and finally to take up the sword and do their “bit” to stamp out the accursed militarism of the Hun, that peace once more may reign upon the earth.\n\nAlready are the brave boys in khaki missed on the streets of Aylmer, where they were ever welcome, and their weekend visits will no longer be enjoyed in scores of homes in Aylmer and vicinity. Brave fathers have torn themselves from their wives; sweethearts have bid a fond adieu – and little ones, sons have said goodbye to brave fathers and mothers, and perhaps for the last time. For the brave men of the 91st are off on a perilous mission. A feeling as of reverence has been cast over the entire county since their departure, for hardly is there a home in the county which is not represented in Elgin’s Own Battalion by a dear one, or at least a very dear friend.\n\nMany of the men said the last farewell in the quietness of their own homes on Friday and Saturday, but on Sunday, as the battalion marched from the barracks to the waiting trains at the M.C.R. station, scores of Aylmer and East Elgin citizens were on hand to give the brave lads a final handshake, and to wish them good luck.\n\nNever in the history of St. Thomas has there been such crowds gathered on the street. Talbot Street was packed with human beings for blocks, and the park at the M.C.R. was crowded with anxious friends and relatives of the departing men.\n\nPromptly at five o’clock the order was given at the barracks for the men to parade to the station. They were all loaded down with their heavy packs, and it was a hot march to the train. Talbot Street was so filled that just an alleway was left for the men to march. Many patriotic scenes were witnessed as the final farewells were said by friends all along the line, and in many instances, marching arm in arm with their loved ones, were elderly ladies hanging on to the strong arms of their sons, staying right beside their boys until the final order to entrain was given. Wives and sweethearts took places right in the ranks beside their loved ones, and paraded to the steps of the cars with them, taking advantage of every last second in parting conversation.\n\nFor the most part the vast throng of women who said goodbye did so bravely and with as little demonstration as possible, and not until the trains had pulled out did they give vent to their pent-up feeling and let loose their emotions int ears. There were exceptional cases, however, and some hysterical women had to be cared for by their friends. Fathers were seen to bid goodbye to two, three, and even more children, and maintain a perfect composure until the babe in arms was reached, when the wells of emotion were suddenly given their freedom.\n\nThe men from Aylmer and East Elgin for the most part went through this trying, and perhaps the hardest, ordeal they will be called upon to face – that of tearing themselves away from all home connections, with brave hearts and stiff upper lips. They went away with a cheery smile, confident that they were doing their duty.\n\nThey first train was composed of ten Grand Trunk Pacific coaches, and were filled with men of A and B Companies, and moved out at 5:30, with the band playing “Auld Lang Syne”. The second train, with ten more coaches, carrying C and D Companies, moved out at 6 o’clock. The huge crowd moved silently away after the departure of the last coach, without hurry or excitement, firmly realizing that the fortunes of war will now strike closer home than ever.\n\nThe battalion was nearly up to full strength, there being around 1,100 officers and men in the march. The officers are practically all Elgin men, and the men are the pick of the county.\n\nThe battalion passed through Toronto on Sunday night en route east. A large crowd greeted each section, which stopped over at the Union Station for a short time to enable the commissary cars to be attached, and the boys were given a rousing send off when the trains pulled out.\n\nVoyage of the 91st\n\nAn interesting first-hand account of the voyage of the 91st Battalion overseas is contained in the form of a diary written by Pte. John William Cracknell, a former resident of the Kingsmill area. Pte. Cracknell was killed in action on September 2, 1918. Details about him will be found later in this publication.\n\nA photo of Pte. Cracknell along with the following caption, appeared in the St. Thomas Journal, August 26, 1916:\n\nWITH THE ELGINS\n\nPte. J. W. Cracknell, enlisted last September with “The Elgins” and what was afterwards “A’ Company of the 91st Battalion. He was born in the old land and had been in Canada for five years. Previous to his enlistment he was employed by farmers near Iona Station. His widowed mother resides in Tottenham Court, London, England. He is now with the 12th Reserve Battalion at West Sandling Camp. Pte. Cracknell wrote the diary of the overseas trip of the 91st, which appeared in last Saturday’s Journal.\n\nThe diary referred to above was printed in the August 19, 1916 edition of the Journal:\n\nPTE. CRACKNELL HAS DIARY OF HIS VOYAGE OVERSEAS WITH 91ST\n\nMiss Marie Farrah, Kingsmill, Has Interesting Letter from 91st Soldier\n\nMen Found Time Hanging on Their Hands While Aboard Transport\n\nKingsmill, Aug. 16 – Letters have been received this week by Miss Marie Farrah, from Pte. J. Cracknell, giving a diary of his voyage.\n\nTroopship Olympic, June 30\n\n“Marie –\n\nWe have been on the boat now about two days. After arriving in Halifax on June 28, about midnight, we stayed on the train until morning, then we boarded about noon and started to look over the ship. This is the sister ship to the Titanic. Is sure some size. It’s main measurements are 822 feet long, 72 feet wide, height 104 feet from boat deck to keel. The boat deck is the one that the lifeboats are on. There is another deck above this with a bridge. No doubt you will be able to form some idea of the size of it from these measurements. There are four smoke stacks on it and everyone of them is as big as an ordinary silo. It is about 60 feet from the boat deck to the water level and about forty feet of this canoe is below the water. By the time we get off this boat we will not have seen one quarter of it. There are about 7,000 men on the boat, including the crew. I might say here that I would like to have seen her as a passenger ship. Since being turned into a troopship she has been almost completely remodelled, all the costly fittings have been torn down and all staterooms but a few to accommodate the officers. The ship is armed, carrying a rapid-firing gun fore and aft, besides a machine gun on the corners of the boat deck. We had our first meal of hardtack when we came on the boat. No wonder the government wants every man to have good teeth, until you get used to these biscuits, it is like eating bricks, besides there is scarcely any taste to them.\n\nOur first job after getting on the boat was to find quarters which consist of a couple of hooks screwed into the deck above and a hammock. We hang from the ceiling in these at night, almost as thick as sardines in a can. I am on “F” deck. Thursday morning we found ourselves being pulled out of the dock by several tugs and expected we were started on our way. However, we were mistaken, we just got well out into the harbor and let down anchor. Might say here that there is quite a fleet of cruisers and destroyers in the harbor guarding the shipping. During the evening every man was equipped with a life preserver. There is almost every kind of life-saving apparatus on the ship that you can think of. It is compulsory for every man to wear his life preserver during the day and have it close to his bed at night. At night there are scarcely any lights to be seen from the outside of the boat and all portholes are closed, there being a heavy penalty for a man who opens a port hole when the ship is at sea. Besides this there is a water-tight door about every thirty feet with two sentries on each one, in case of anything happening. These fellows have to understand the shutting of the bulkheads. About nine o’clock the ship lifted anchor and sailed.\n\nJune 30 – Woke up this morning after a fine sleep in an old hammock, went on deck and found the ship going at a reduced speed in a heavy fog, tooting its foghorn every minute to warn other ships that might be near. At noon the fog lifted and there was nothing to be seen but sky and ocean. About 3 o’clock today we passed another boat going west, it was right out on the horizon and was scarcely distinguishable to the naked eye.\n\nJuly 1 – Somewhere on the Atlantic – The day opened fine and clear but grew foggy about 9 o’clock and remained that way until the afternoon. Everything is going fine and the boys are enjoying themselves very much. Only a few have been seasick. There is a swimming pool on the ship amidship, about 35 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a depth of 5 ½ feet of water, not quite as large as the one in the Y.M.C.A. at St. Thomas, but just as good. It is filled every day from the ocean and a nice plunge in it can be had for the sum of “two bits”, towels included. The water smarts when it gets into the eyes and it doesn’t taste like strawberry ice cream if you swallow any of it. I was in the pool last evening and tried my life-preserver, it is absolutely impossible to sink with one of these on and you can turn any way in them you like without fear of sinking. They are made of cork and cover both sides of the body with a place to put your head through, the shoulders and arms are perfectly free to swim, but for anyone that is a good swimmer they can go faster without them. Met another tramp steamer going west this morning. Several of the boys reported having seen whales during the afternoon. Might also add that “4″ platoon, “A’ Company, has an apartment all to itself, and the captain complimented us on having and keeping our quarters the cleanest on the boat. Here I might say that the boys have to be on deck every morning for a few hours, while the captain and a few of our own officers inspect the troops’ quarters. This also holds good concerning the other battalions, which are the 94th, 101st, 104th, 13th Mounted Rifles and an Army Service Corps. This is an awful lazy and sleepy job on board, nothing to do but a few duties and sleep and eat. Slept from noon today until five, just in time to get supper. Relieved Alf. Grogan this evening on Mess Orderly, to get a glimpse of the kitchen. It beats everything I have ever seen. In there one almost forgets they are on the boat. If it wasn’t for the stewards that direct the way in and out one would get completely lost in the kitchen alone. Every way you turn there are huge copper boilers, boiling away to beat the d[evi]l. No room is wasted in here or in any other part of the boat, and still there is heaps of room to move about. There is a small army of cooks in here. Every way one turns you are met by huge vats, steaming like the deuce, some with tea, others with porridge, and the like. In one place they were boiling chicken. Some sight, believe me. Three huge vats filled full and several large baskets as big as an ordinary row boat filled and awaiting their turn in the vats. I might say that the members of this platoon generally have a feast after “lights out”. Last night one fellow bought a chicken for 75c, and I added to the banquet with an apple pie, price 25c, made by the ship’s crew. These pies have a crust on them about an inch and a half thick and contain an apple about the size of an ordinary peanut, but for all their size they make pretty good eating.\n\nAt the time of writing the evening or sunset services are on. Every night at sunset there are two or three bands out playing and helping to make time pass. We always go below to the strains of one or more bands. And as to sunset I don’t know where you can see a prettier sunset than right out here in the ocean. It looks swell as the sun sinks lower and lower until at last it looks to be disappearing beneath the sea. It generally goes down in one big red mass, and most of the boys are on deck to see it and set and to get a breath of the fine salt sea air before going below for the night. Just a few more notes about the ship before “lights out”. I said in one place that the smoke stacks were as big as silos, since then I have learned that they are between 30 and 40 feet across, and could easily accommodate a train through them. You can get an idea of their size by comparing them with the Windsor tunnel. I have not seen anything of the engines or boilers yet. Nobody is allowed down there when the vessel is at sea, except the crew, of course. I saw Steve a short time ago, the second time I’ve seen him since we came aboard. He was down there when the boat was in harbor, but can only describe it as being a work of works, nothing but a tremendous mass of machinery and steel work, such as can only be found on the largest boats in the world. There is no less that 159 fire boxes, three to each boiler. There are some, however, that have only two fireboxes. Every stoker fires either two or three fires at a time. It requires a squad of sixty stokers at a time and they work in shifts, same as we do guard, only they have 4 hours on and 8 hours off. This gives you a gang of 180 stokers alone, and there is supposed to be between 35 and 40 engineers on her. These numbers may not be absolutely exact, but they are not far out. The boat deck is 1,150 feet round, 4 ½ times round is one mile, and remember that you don’t walk the entire length of the ship, either, just 448 feet on the side and 92 feet across.\n\nWell, here I am again, a thousand miles from home and not enough money to buy a ham sandwich. Buy a pair of shoe laces and help a fellow in distress. This is Sunday, but it seems no more like the Sabbath than any other day. The sea is quite choppy and it is drizzling rain, so it makes staying on deck quite miserable. I am on guard today and guarding a door down below. The main duties are to see there is no jamming and no smoking. Just came off. Will go on again at three this afternoon. Boys all happy and contented and making the best of a bad job by staying below playing cards and writing. It is strictly forbidden to smoke between decks, and smoking on the top deck is only allowed between 6 o’clock in the morning and 9 o’clock at night. Expect to enter the war zone soon. Heard last night that about 35 feet in the bottom of this boat was full of water. No, it didn’t leak, bu was put there as a ballast. She has hardly any cargo when working as a troopship outside of the pack of the troops, of course.\n\nBack on deck again. One week ago at this time, 5:30 we left St. Thomas. Today we are somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic and nearing the British Isles. The weather has been terrible, most of the day it rained till about three this afternoon, then it stopped, but the sky is still cloudy and the atmosphere is quite cold. To make things worse the rain has made the deck quite slippery. We had an emergency call this afternoon, it is a precaution in case of fire or any other emergency. The call is sounded all over the ship, and on hearing it every man on deck has to stand fast. The guards on the watertight bulkheads have to close them. They are closed by means of a large wrench which hangs alongside the door. Once closed the water cannot get into the ship, or rather that section where the doors are closed. Say, we get some meals on this boat, though it has the barracks all beat. The menu for today was: Breakfast – porridge, egg and bacon, coffee. Dinner – Chicken soup, chicken, peas and plum pudding. Supper – maccaroni, cheese, jam, tea, bread, butter, apples and oranges. Some feeds, believe me. All the bread that is used on the ship is made right here on board. Have not seen Steve since yesterday. He is away back in the stern and on “G” deck, one below ours. The propeller shaft on this boat is said to be 14 feet through, while every link in the chain holding the anchor weighs 60 pounds. Have not heard the actual weight of the anchor itself.\n\nSomewhere near the war zone on the Atlantic. Sea quite calm, but sky has been cloudy all day. Think we are somewhere near land. Passed two large sailing vessels today at noon, one going towards Canada and the other going the way we were. Didn’t take us long to catch up and pass them. When we first saw them they just looked like specks on the horizon.\n\nAs we have no escort we have an emergency call almost every day, just to keep us on the alert in case something does happen. Most of the voyage has been cloudy. Will be glad to see land, getting tired of laying around. The boys are all confused with the time on this boat. The clock is put on almost every night, as English time is several hours ahead of Canadian time. The Machine Gun Section of the various batteries practised this afternoon by throwing barrels over the stern, waiting until we were about half a mile from them and then opening fire. Don’t think they made a very good showing, as the barrels could only be seen when they came over the crest of the waves. Evening ended up with the sunset service and two or three bands on deck. Forgot to mention before that the 104th Battalion has a fine band, about 30 players on board. Some band, believe me, when they get going.\n\nJuly 4 – Somewhere off the Irish Coast. The day opened cloudy and cold and has remained that way all day. Felt more like the middle of November than midsummer. Woke up this morning to hear some strange sounds going on outside the ship. On going on deck I soon found the reason. We were in the war zone and the boat was zigzagging all over. There were no submarines to be seen, but this was a precautionary method.\n\nThe guns were all uncovered and prepared for action, while there are extra lookouts all over the vessel. We passed a couple of patrol boats this forenoon, one on the starboard and the other on the port. Had some more hard-tack at dinner today. Honestly, I believe they make those biscuits in a foundry, also think they turn out softer stuff in the ordinary foundry that these sea biscuits. Well we have now got our escort with us, two fast torpedo destroyers.\n\nThursday, July 5 – Joy! On going on deck this morning we were going right alongside the coast of Ireland. The morning was fine and that way all day, it has been the best day of the trip. There is pretty scenery on both sides of us, and judging from the number of ships and steamers on either side of us it don’t look as though German submarine warfare is hurting the British shipping much. We have just finished our last meal on board. The ship is just pulling into dock. Every little steamer we pass gives us a welcome by almost blowing its whistle to pieces. We got off and are loaded on the train. Boys don’t know what to make of these dinky little English trains. Arrived in camp about 1 o’clock Friday morning. Passed through the suburbs on London but everything was dark. The street lamps are all shaded and the stations are almost dark. After having a mess of hot skilly this morning went right to bed.\n\nJuly 6 – Got up this morning about eleven o’clock and ate breakfast, or was it dinner. Well, here we are in camp, I don’t know the name of the place, but we are about 50 miles from London. The nearest town in Folkstone, which is about four miles. It is a pretty place around here. One would never think that about 80 miles from here the fighting is going on.\n\nThe Aylmer Express, December 14, 1916:\n\nJAFFA WELL REPRESENTED\n\nTen Men From That Place Doing Their “Bit” at The Front\n\n– Alfred Wharton, son-in-law of Mr. Doolittle, is a British reservist, and a veteran of five campaigns.

There are 43 of them, four of whom have given their lives for the old flag. On Sunday evening a service is to be held, conducted by the rector, Rev. C. A. Miles, in honor of these grand boys. The names are written on a framed card and will be unveiled during the service. The three first names are known possibly by all, and the William Harris mentioned was the son of George Harris, at one time a resident of Aylmer and janitor of the church. He joined a Winnipeg battalion.\n\nFollowing is the list:\n\nHarry Simpson, Charles Elworthy, Francis H. Ingram (these were killed in action); Alfred Ingram, Edward Breay, Harry Richardson (returned soldier, wounded); Roland Gatword, William Butcher, George Swaddling, Harry Grass (honorably discharged); Verne Mitchell, Robert Brackotone, Frank Pipe, Gilbert Gaskill, Gordon A.

The large room was completely filled with students of the school, ex-students and relatives and friends of the lads who are now doing their “bit” in the great world war, and some are now asleep in Flanders’ Fields, having made the supreme sacrifice. The room was beautifully decorated with flags, bunting and flowers, and in the centre on the platform was draped the Honor Roll, which contained the names of 99 students and ex-students, 10 of whom have laid down their life for the Empire. The Honor Roll itself was designed and made by Miss Byron, a member of the staff, and was a work of art, reflecting much credit on the designer.\n\nPrincipal E. O. Awde was chairman and in his introductory remarks emphasized the fact that although the boys on the Roll had been trained for peace and not for war, during their years at school, yet the principles of justice, heroism and sacrifice had been so deeply implanted in their hearts that they had responded nobly to their country’s call. He asked that Mr. Rutherford, who for more than thirty years was principal of the school, and knew the boys hose names were on the Honor Roll, and their individual history, to read the names and unveil the roll. Mr. Rutherford said he was proud of the way the students and ex-students of the school had responded to the call to down the Hun, from the very outbreak of the war. He pointed to the way in which the boys had flocked to the colors from all the seats of learning, universities, colleges and high schools, and said, “Isn’t that just what we would expect, that the intelligence of the country should be the first to see the need?”\n\nDuring the reading of the names of the ten students who have made the supreme sacrifice the big audience showed their respect by standing.\n\nThe Honor Roll itself is about four feet long and 18 inches wide and nicely framed and is headed by a painting. Each name is on a separate tablet, those deceased being marked by a red circle, and attached to a tinted background, the whole being the work of Miss Byron, one of the staff. The following are the names in alphabetical order:\n\nCapt. Murray Abell, M.D., Lieut. Harry Amoss, B.A., Frank Amoss, Capt. Frank Bennett, M.D., Murray Benner, Alfred Benson, F. Lieut. Donald Benson, Eric Bingham, Kenneth Black, Roy Beaufor, Byron Boyes, Lt.-Col. Walter J. Brown, Trevor Campbell, A. Christie, Lieut. Ewart Christie, Harold Chute, Lieut.

Richardson, Clinton C. E. Thomson.\n\nRev. Mr. Muttitt in a forceful manner contrasted British and German ideals and compared their success in dealing with Colonial problems, citing the example of British rule in India, Australia, South Africa and Canada, as opposed to German rule in Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nRev. Mr. Hager spoke of the sacrifices made by the mothers of Canada, who although proud of their brave lads, live in constant dread of evil news.\n\nRev. Mr. Miles emphasized the early training of the youth and the necessity of living up to the ideals of the British Empire.\n\nDr. Coll Sinclair, chairman of the High School Board, who has kept in touch with many of those whose name appear on the Honor Roll, and had tried to ascertain the motives which caused the boys to join the colors. He had found that in most cases it was from a clear sense of duty. That is the kind of men who must surely win the fight.\n\nRev. Mr. Moyer expressed his appreciation on being invited to attend the memorable occasion, and although he did not know many of the boys whose names were written on the Roll, he was glad to be present and enjoy the programme.\n\nHarold Barnum, chairman of the Public School Board, very feelingly touched upon the sacrifice made. He urged upon the present students by those who now sleep in France, the value and necessity of studying history, for from that had evolved the principals for which our soldiers fight and upon which our lives are based.\n\nFlight Sub-Lieut. Kenneth Stratton whose name is on the Honor Roll, and who has served two years in the fighting zone with the British Air Force, at present recuperating with the hope of returning shortly, described the spirit of the boys at the front. He said they were enjoying life in spite of the mud, but if the folks at home wished to do them a real kindness, they should write as often as possible, for the boys watched the mail closer than they do the cook.\n\nThe program was interspersed with choruses by the pupils, a beautiful solo by Mr. A. Ray Lemon, and a most appropriate recitation by Miss Clarisa Miller, a student of the school. The ceremony was concluded by singing the National Anthem. The Honor Roll now hangs in the assembly room in the school and will no doubt be added to, as a number of students of this year’s classes have signed up for service this week.\n\nAylmer Celebrates the Armistice\n\nThe Aylmer Express, November 14, 1918:\n\nAYLMER CELEBRATES SIGNING OF ARMISTICE\n\nWhistles Announced Allies Victory at 5 a.m. Monday\n\nMammoth Parade at 10 o’clock – Kaiser Burned in Effigy\n\nBig Torch Light Procession at Night\n\nAylmer royally celebrated the signing of the armistice last Monday. The good news reached Aylmer by wire at 3 a.m. and at 5 o’clock it was decided that all the people should know about it, and the big whistle at the Condensor started in to shriek the signal, and from that time until after midnight there was a joyful noise in Aylmer.\n\nArmistice was expected at any time and on Saturday Mayor Wright sent out a proclamation stating that should the news be received early in the morning a grand parade would take place at 10 a.m., and the day would be declared a public holiday. The proclamation was a good idea for our citizens knew as soon as they heard the whistle what the programme for the day would be.\n\nThe town was thrown wide open and everybody enjoyed themselves until far into the night. Whistles shrieked, bells rang, horns blew and the people yelled and cheered, but still the day was spent in a most orderly manner and no accidents occurred. Those in charge of the day’s programme are to be congratulated for the way everything went off.\n\nAylmer homes, streets and places of business were gayly decorated with flags and bunting in honor of the glorious victory. At 10 o’clock the big parade formed up on Talbot street, and headed by the Band, Mayor Wright and member of the council marched around all the main streets. Mr. John Wilson was in charge of the parade and Messrs. A. H. Backus and Dan McLean were efficient marshalls. In the parade marched the members of the Aylmer branch of the Great War Veteran’s Assn., many of them war scarred; the Public School bugle band; the Fire Department, with the hose wagon and hook and ladder wagon gayly decorated; decorated motor floats conveying the members of the Red Cross Society, Women’s Institute and Travel Club, our three patriotic societies. The High School students, headed by their teachers, marched in a body, followed by hundreds of citizens on foot. Then came the automobiles – more than 150 of them, each decorated with flags and bunting. The procession was well over half a mile long and it was a nosy half mile too.\n\nThe feature of the parade was a float, from a pole on the back of which hung the form of the late German Kaiser, in effigy, and many a citizen took delight in giving William a kick or a punch is passing. This float was driven by Reeve Oscar McKenney, and seated with him was Marshall Foch, in the person of Councillor J. Cline. Directly behind him sat John Bull and Uncle Sam, in the persons of Morley Whitesides and Earl Peckham, holding the Union Jack and Stars and Stripes. When the parade halted at the park, the Kaiser was burned in effigy, amid deafening cheers. A sign above the Kaiser read “Gott Deserted Me”. Among the streamers in the procession was one most suitable at this time, “Finish the Job, Buy Victory Bonds”.\n\nAt the park the big crowd joined in singing the doxology, “Praise God From Whom All Blessing Flow”, and Rev. Charles Miles gave a short thanksgiving prayer for the allies’ victory.\n\nAylmer streets were filled with people all day long. As soon as the news became in Malahide and Bayham, hundreds of citizens came to town and joined in the celebration. During the morning parade there were over 5,000 people in the streets.\n\nIn the afternoon a service of prayer and thanksgiving was held in Trinity church. In the evening another big parade in the form of a torch light procession was held at 8 o’clock, headed by the band, and a number of prominent citizens in burlesque costumes followed by hundreds of citizens, paraded on Talbot and John streets for more than two hours, each one armed with a flaming broom or torch. A mammoth bonfire was built on the square opposite the post office, and for more than half an hour, sky rockets and fire works were shot off. It was a big day and it was after midnight before things quieted down.\n\nAylmer Erects a War Memorial\n\nThe cenotaph in Aylmer was erected in 1928 to honour the fallen of Aylmer & Malahide. It was completed and unveiled on November 25, 1928, in a ceremony drawing over two thousand people. Several articles preceding this event appeared in the Aylmer Express, as follows:\n\nThe Aylmer Express, March 31, 1927:\n\nEAST ELGIN TO ERECT BEAUTIFUL WAR MEMORIAL IN AYLMER\n\nFunds to be Raised by Public Subscription – Post Office Grounds is to be the site\n\nMajor Rev. Bruce Hunter of London, Addresses Enthusiastic Meeting\n\nBy a unanimous vote of the citizens of Aylmer and East Elgin who, fairly filled the town hall on Tuesday night, it was decided to proceed with the proposed memorial to be erected here in memory of the men from East Elgin who paid the supreme sacrifice in the Great War. As was explained by Dr. Coll Sinclair, who moved the resolution, East Elgin had not forgotten her glorious dead, but since the Memorial Hospital project was found to be entirely out of the question some few years ago, there appeared to be no individuals or group to bring the memorial question again before the citizens. He highly commended the men of the Canadian Legion, who are decidedly anxious to honor their fallen comrades, for again bringing the memorial before the people. The motion was seconded by Mr. G. R. Christie.\n\nRev. R. D. Hamilton, the president of the provisional memorial committee, was chairman, and in a few remarks explained the object of the meeting, to settle the question of a memorial to perpetuate the memory of the lads from East Elgin who are sleeping in Flanders Fields. In this the chairman spoke feelingly for his own son is among those laid to rest in a cemetery in Flanders.\n\nMr. Fenton S. Fansher in a stirring address, reviewed the history of Great Britain and her colonies. How she has been the greatest christianizing force and the greatest civilizing force the world has ever seen. All people who have come under her flag have benefitted and have grown into independent nations, but bound to the motherland by ties which can never be broken. These ties are now stronger than ever because from all her colonies lie men in the fields of Flanders under thousands of crosses, side by side. Men of Canada have written history which can never be effaced. Mr. Fansher said he believed every man and woman has in his heart a memorial to these glorious dead and now that the project is launched, there will be no trouble to erect a visible one of which this county may be proud.\n\nThe address of the evening was given by Major Rev. Bruce Hunter, of the Metropolitan United Church, London, and his remarks were the more appreciated because he has been ill and against doctor’s advice had come to Aylmer. This was his first visit here and when he thought of the sacrifice made by Canadian soldiers in France, it needed more than a sore throat or swollen head to keep him away. He is interested in the men who bled and died for the liberty of the world, and in the men who have come bac. He said he was surprised that the people’s memories are so short, and felt humiliated and ashamed at the indifference of the citizens of Canada toward the sacrifices made in the war. He congratulated East Elgin upon its determination to commemorate the memory of those who fell. Major Hunter was Chaplain with the Canadians overseas for four years and was in a reminiscent mood, taking his audience with the fighting men to England, and then tot he front-line trenches, refreshing their memories of the ten great battles in which the Canadians wrote history and many times saved the day for the British Empire. Because of duty they held the line. He described the hardships they endured and referred to many touching scenes he encountered while attending to the dying, of the hundreds of messages he wrote for dying men, who made the great sacrifice for their loved ones at home. Major Hunter said they called him a militarist in London. He believes in three lines of defense. First the spirit of brotherhood to make war impossible, second, a Board of arbitration such as the League of Nations, and lastly, defense by military power. As all other returned men he hates war but should Great Britain again be threatened he would volunteer at once and sacrifice himself rather than have any outlaw nation treat his wife and children as did the Germans treat the Belgians.\n\nE. Armstrong, secretary of the provisional committee, at some detail explained the character of the proposed memorial, mentioned the location, etc. The Canadian Legion, who have the memorial on their hearts had secured several plans and prices. The proposed site is in Aylmer, the only town in East Elgin, and on the Post Office property, just east of the Post Office building, where the gun is at present situated. A memorial on this location would be the only one facing No. 3 Highway from Windsor to Niagara Falls, and every tourist would have something to remember Elgin County by.\n\nA very fine memorial is one of solid grey granite, with two bronze tablets inset for the 48 names of the men from East Elgin whose memories are to be commemorated, with a bronze figure of a Canadian soldier 6 feet, 6 inches in height. This monument would be in four complete parts and would cost $8,000. The committee had other plans and designs of less cost, and the style of memorial could be chosen later. The provisional committee is composed of Mayor Davis, Percy Crawford, president of the Legion, Ben Martin, Rev. R. D. Hamilton, H. E. Armstrong, Rev. Mils and Mrs. T. G. Winder. It is proposed to organize the entire east portion of the county and to make a complete canvas. It was mentioned that it would be fine to celebrate July first by unveiling the monument, but it was explained that it takes three months to make and erect the monument and the next best date suggested was Armistice Day and in this year of Jubilee.\n\nShort addresses were also given by Rev. J. S. LaFlair, Rev. Waldemar Williams, Canon Miles and Mayor Davis, who pledged their hearty support.\n\nThe High School orchestra played a number of selections which were appreciated. A solo was well rendered by Mrs. (Dr.) McNiece, and Harry Richardson, a member of the Legion, sang a few of the songs the boys enjoyed overseas, and the men of the Legion joined in the choruses.\n\nThe meeting was most enthusiastic and clearly demonstrated that the men of East Elgin who laid down their lives for freedom are not to be forgotten and certainly a suitable memorial is to be erected, and one every citizen will be proud of.\n\nA sketch of the proposed memorial with the following caption appeared in the June 14, 1928 issue:\n\nTHE NEW AYLMER – MALAHIDE WAR MEMORIAL\n\nThe above photograph was taken from a drawing of the new War Memorial to be erected on the Post Office grounds, Aylmer, by the citizens of Malahide and Aylmer, in memory of the men from these two municipalities who paid the supreme sacrifice during the Great War. It is to be erected at a cost of $5,000 and the contract has been let to Hutchinson & Peckham, of Aylmer. The entire monument is to be of handsome grey granite. The total height is 13 feet, 6 inches. The figure of the Mourning Mother, carved in relief is 7 feet in height. On the pedestal on either side of the figure 25 names of the men who fell, are to be engraved. The tomb in front is of the same stone and will be 7 feet long, 4 feet wide, and one foot high. It is planned to unveil the memorial on Armistice Day. The committee is anxious that every name that should be on the memorial be in their hands at once and relatives or friends of any men from Aylmer or Malahide, who paid the supreme sacrifice overseas, are asked to make sure that the Aylmer Legion or the Memorial Committee have their names.\n\nThe Aylmer Express, September 20, 1928:\n\nFIRST SOD TURNED FOR WAR MEMORIAL\n\nLord Willingdon Will be Asked to Unveil New Memorial on Armistice Day\n\nThe first sod was turned at noon last Thursday for the foundation for the Malahide and Aylmer War Memorial which will be erected on the pretty lawn at the Post Office grounds, Talbot street. The site is ideal, being in the centre of town and will be surrounded by flower beds and lawn with the town park in the background. Scores of citizens and the students of the public and high schools were present at the short ceremony. Rev. R. D. Hamilton, chairman of the War Memorial Committee, presided, and in a short address explained the object of the ceremony and particularly welcomed the boys and girls, the future hope of our land. He rejoiced in the fact that after a year of more of work the committee had reached this point when the first sod was to be turned to erect a beautiful monument to keep in perpetual memory the names of the men from Malahide and Aylmer who died in Flanders Field during the last Great War. The contract for the Memorial was let to the local firm of Hutchinson & Peckham, and the memorial is to be the finest on No. 3 Highway between Windsor and Niagara Falls, to cost some $6,000. It is to be completed by Armistice Day when the official unveiling will take place and Mr. Hamilton announced that the committee are making every effort fo have Lord Willingdon, Governor General of Canada, present on that occasion to officiate. Canon Miles, senior pastor in Aylmer, led in prayer, and the first sods were turned by Dr. H. J. Davis, mayor of Aylmer, and H. B. Westover, Reeve of Malahide Township. “The Maple Leaf” was played by the Citizens’ Band and appropriately concluded the ceremony. The solid foundation of concrete has been installed and during the next few weeks the Memorial will be erected.\n\nThe Aylmer Express, November 8, 1928:\n\nWAR MEMORIAL TO BE UNVEILED SUNDAY NOVEMBER 25\n\nIt Is Expected the Lieut.-Governor Will Officiate\n\nA meeting of the Memorial Committee and the Committee of the Canadian Legion was held on Monday evening last to complete final arrangements for the unveiling of the Aylmer and Malahide War Memorial, which was set in position last week and is now complete. It was the regret of the Committee that the unveiling ceremonies could not take place on Armistice Day, next Sunday, November 11th. It has been found impossible to secure a visit from the Governor-General, who was asked to officiate and it was therefore decided by motion to have the Lieut.-Governor of Ontario officiate at the unveiling on Sunday, November 25th at 3 p.m. We understand the Sunday Schools of the district will be asked to meet at 2 p.m. on that Sunday afternoon and at 3 p.m. march to the Post Office in a body for the unveiling ceremonies.\n\nThe Programme Committee will consist of the following: Rev. R. D. Hamilton, Canon Miles, Mayor Davis and Reeve Westover from the Memorial Committee, and E. W. Haines and P. Crawford, from the Legion. Capt. Haines, in command of D Company of the Elgin Regiment, will arrange for the Guard of Honor.\n\nThe purchasing committee were named to inspect the erection of the Memorial and to ask the builders for a ten-year guarantee. At the unveiling ceremonies, it is expected the Elgin Regiment will attend with their Regimental Band. The Aylmer Citizens’ Band will be there. The members of the Legion, town and township officials and councillors and every citizen is expected.\n\nThe Committee announce that they will gladly receive subscriptions from any who have not yet subscribed and want to have a share in the erection of this handsome memorial. Those who have not yet paid their subscriptions please do so at once.\n\nThe Aylmer Express, November 22, 1918:\n\nTHE AYLMER – MALAHIDE WAR MEMORIAL WILL BE UNVEILED THIS SUNDAY\n\nGeneral Armstrong, of London, to Officiate, Assisted by Mrs. Ida Haight, of Aylmer\n\nAll Citizens of the Community are Invited\n\nElgin Regiment, Aylmer and St. Thomas Legions to Attend\n\nOn Sunday afternoon next, November 25th, at 3 o’clock, the handsome new memorial erected by the citizens of Aylmer and Malahide in memory of those brave men from these municipalities who paid the supreme sacrifice overseas during the Great War, will be unveiled. Every citizen is invited to attend and witness this interesting ceremony. The Elgin Regiment; both the St. Thomas and Aylmer Legions and Auxiliaries, The Elgin Regimental Band, The St. Thomas Pipe Band and the Aylmer Citizens’ Band are expected to be present and assist in the ceremonies. The Sunday Schools of the district are asked to meet early next Sunday to allow all, both old and young, to be present at the unveiling ceremony.\n\nGeneral Armstrong, Officer Commanding Military District No. 1, London, will officiate at the unveiling and he will be assisted by Mrs. Ida Haight, of Aylmer, who will pull the cords, loosing the veil about the monument. Four of Mrs. Haight’s sons served with the Canadian forces overseas, and two of them died in action. It is very fitting that she has been chosen to assist. The following is the programme which it is proposed to carry out:\n\nThe Guard of Honor will meet General Armstrong and his party at the High School shortly after 2:30 p.m. The Guard will be inspected there and the party will parade east on Talbot street, south on Centre St. to Sydenham; east on Sydenham to John; North on John to Talbot and west on Talbot to the Memorial at the Post Office grounds.\n\n“O Canada” by the Band\n\nChairman’s Remarks\n\nGreetings by the Mayor and Reeve Address\n\nUnveiling of the Memorial\n\nLast Post, by Bugler\n\nDipping of the Colours\n\nReveille by Bugler\n\n“God Save the King” by the Band\n\nPlacing of Wreaths\n\nBenediction\n\nThe Aylmer Express, November 29, 1928:\n\nCOL. WALTER JAMES BROWN DELIVERS A MOST INSPIRING ADDRESS\n\nAT UNVEILING OF WAR MEMORIAL ON SUNDAY\n\nMrs. Ida Haight Unveiled the Monument\n\nMore Than Two Thousand Witness the Ceremony\n\nThe handsome war memorial erected on the post office grounds here by the citizens of Malahide and Aylmer to commemorate the memory of fifty-five men from these two municipalities, who paid the supreme sacrifice in the Great War, 1914-1918, and now lie buried in Flanders Fields, was officially unveiled last Sunday afternoon. Despite a bitter cold wind more than 2,000 people from Aylmer and Malahide and the surrounding district, witnessed the programme which was carried through entirely as planned.\n\nThe new monument occupies a most conspicuous position at the east side of the Post Office grounds, and all who pass by on No. 3 Highway may see that, although the war has passed by a decade, the hero dead are not forgotten. The handsome memorial was designed by the late J. W. Hutchinson, of Aylmer, and the local firm of Hutchinson & Peckham had the contract. It is without a doubt the most handsome memorial yet erected in Elgin county and one of the most unique and prettiest in Ontario. It was erected at a cost of some $5,000 and the committee are to be congratulated upon the splendid result of their efforts and the manner in which the programme was conducted on Sunday.\n\nAn effort had been made to secure the presence of the Governor-General and also General Armstrong, commanding Military District No. 1, London, but neither could attend because of other pressing duties. It was most fitting however, that Colonel Walter James Brown, of London, was chosen to officiate and to make the principal address. Colonel Brown is a native of Malahide, a former citizen of Aylmer, was overseas with one of the Canadian batteries, and for a time was officer commanding this district. It was also fitting that Mrs. Ida Haight, of Aylmer, was chosen to draw the cords which drew back the great Union Jack, thus unveiling the memorial. Mrs. Haight contributed four sons to the Canadian forces, two of whom were killed in action.\n\nThe ceremony was entirely military. The Elgin Regiment with their band, attended in full force, as well as the Aylmer and St. Thomas branches of the Canadian Legion and also the Auxiliaries. The reception committee met Colonel Brown and the other distinguished guests at the High School at 2:45 p.m. Here the guard of honor under the command of Captain E. W. Haines was inspected. The party then proceeded to the memorial headed by the Elgin Regimental Band, the St. Thomas Legion Pipe Band, and the Aylmer Citizens’ Band. The Bands and regiment were drawn up on Talbot street, facing the memorial with colors in front. The King’s colors were carried by Lieut. Ross McPherson, the regimental colors by Lieut. Balkwill, while the escort consisted of R.S.M., C.D. Lloyd, M.M., and Sergeants Badely, Ellis and Davies. A memorial guard was posted near the monument, each standing with arms reversed and heads bowed. The memorial guard was composed of Aylmer veterans, Wooten, Jones, Beech, and Pascoe, in command of C. McCabe, a veteran of the navy.\n\nAccompanying Colonel Brown on the platform erected at the side of the memorial were Brigadier-General Douglas E. Gerrard; Lieut.-Col. F. J. Picking; Lieut.-Colonel W. Andrews, William H. Taylor, M.P. for Norfolk-Elgin; Rev. R. D. Hamilton; Mayor Dr. H. J. Davis and Reeve H. B. Westover. The Union Jack was draped over the memorial.\n\nThe service commenced with the Band playing “O Canada”, followed with prayer by Canon Charles Miles, rector of Trinity Church, Aylmer, following which a few words of welcome were addressed to Col. Brown by Rev. R. D. Hamilton, chairman of the memorial committee, who also lost a son in the great conflict. Mr. Hamilton congratulated the people of Aylmer and Malahide on the realization of their dream. He was glad to see so many veterans who had come back, but he said, “We are here today to honor those dear lads who did not return, and who rest among the noblest and best in France and Belgium. Their names will remain on this memorial long after ours are forgotten”. Colonel Brown and all other visitors were also addressed words of welcome by Mayor Davis of Aylmer, and Reeve Westover, of Malahide.\n\nColonel Brown Pays Tribute\n\nIn his address Colonel Brown said: “We are here this afternoon to pay a tribute to those who gave their lives during the war of 1914-1918. Some people say that the erection of war memorials serves to glorify war. The so-called glorification of war is a delusion. It is a product of the imagination. War may be unavoidable. The vicissitudes of life in the case of an individual sometimes precipitates a crisis. So it is with nations and empires. Every student of history knows that the forces that determine national destiny cannot always be controlled. The only glory that comes from war is the glory of sacrifice, when men lay down their lives for their country. You will agree that the British Empire is, under Providence, the greatest instrument for peace and good will of which history has any knowledge. It is so vast in area, so great in population and so might in influence that the mind fails to grasp what it signifies in the world today. We in Canada are proud that we form a part of that great empire, with its kingdoms, dominions, colonies, protectorates and mandatory states. Think of its 460 millions of peoples, of all colors, races and creeds, bound together with the ties of affection for one crown and one throne. The British colonies taken by themselves are so large, so rich in resources and so populous that they constitute no mean empire, greater perhaps than that of Imperial Rome. Under the beneficent folds of the Union Jack there is justice, liberty and civilization for all who are willing to share our responsibilities, and for all who strive to do their duty. Let us remember that God imposes on no nation supreme opportunity that does not respond to the call of supreme duty. Our supreme duty came to us in the grim form of war in 1914. We paid the price with four years of agony and more than a million dead. Canada’s share was nearly fifty-seven thousand. Of the million dead, 740,000 lie in the fields of France and Belgium. If, for one brief moment, we assume that we had not responded to the call of duty in 1914, and as a result we had lost the war, what would the world be like today? The British Empire would have been broken, and in all probability Canada would have been under a different flag. Is it necessary to ask, “Were the sacrifices we made worth while?”\n\nPraises People of Aylmer\n\n“May I compliment you, the people of Aylmer and Malahide, on your good taste and generosity, in placing this memorial in your midst. It will stand here for all time an expression of patriotism and civic pride. Two weeks ago today we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Armistice which ended the greatest and most fateful of all wars. Our hearts in loving gratitude turned to the memory of those whose lives were the price of our deliverance. This memorial which you have erected is not alone a tribute to the dead. May it be a perpetual reminder to those who come after us of the high moral lessons of the war – the lesson of duty, of devotion to King and country, the lesson of self-control and self-sacrifice, and the lesson of unity in mind and heart that have been the safeguards of the British race.”\n\nPlacing of Wreaths\n\nAnother impressive ceremony was the placing of some seventeen wreaths on the memorial. These were held by members of the Aylmer Legion and the names were called by Mr. T. L. Barnecott, secretary of the Memorial Committee, and placed in the following order: Elgin Regiment, Col. Warren Andrews; D Company, Capt. E. W. Haines; Aylmer Branch Canadian Legion, P. Crawford; Ladies’ Auxiliary, Mrs. P. Crawford and Mrs. J. Benson; Aylmer Council, Mayor H. J. Davis; Malahide Council, Reeve H. Westover; Public School, Aylmer, Misses Barbara Morris and Ronnie Farrel, when a sacred tribute to the British soldiers was recited by Master Jack Harvey; Women’s Institute, Mrs. W. Blanchard; Trinity Church, Aylmer, Canon Miles; United Church, Aylmer, Mr. A. L. Caverly; Hutchinson & Peckham, W. A. Peckham; Mrs. Ida Haight, Pte. Harry Haight; Mrs. J. Benson, Mrs. Benson; Mrs. George Blashill, George Blashill, Buffalo; Mrs. T. W. Benner, Mrs. Benner; Mrs. G. W. Youell, Mr. W. J.

Youell.”\n\nThe Memorial in Springfield\n\nIn 1931, a memorial to those who fell in the Great War from the Springfield area was erected and unveiled. The following article appeared in the Aylmer Express, November 19, 1931:\n\n1500 ATTEND UNVEILING OF SPRINGFIELD CAIRN\n\nElgin Regiment, Aylmer “D” Company and Aylmer Legion, Assist\n\nSunday last was a memorable day for Springfield, when after four years of untiring effort, the beautiful and appropriate cairn erected by the efforts of the Springfield Women’s Institute, in memory of the men from Springfield and South Dorchester who paid the supreme sacrifice in the Great War, was officially unveiled and dedicated. Although the day was wet, it fortunately cleared up long enough at the right time for the ceremonies.\n\nThe Elgin Regiment Band, accompanied by the color party, and other members of the regiment from St. Thomas, “D” Company, Aylmer, the Aylmer branch of the Canadian Legion and Springfield veterans and wreath bearers formed at the school grounds, and headed by the band, marched to the park. At the four corners of the memorial were stationed an infantryman, a sailor, a Highlander, and an artilleryman, representing the four branches of the service, which added much to the impressiveness of the scene. Warden H. G. Taylor was in charge of the program, and carried it through most successfully.\n\nThe opening number was “O Canada” played by the band, with the singing led by Thomas Hobbins, whose fine voice could be heard distinctly throughout the park. Two minutes silence followed, after which Reeve Newell read the address of welcome, in which he stressed the appreciation of the Council and village in having so fine a memorial to grace the little park and to remind the people of sacrifices which the local men had made. He also expressed the thanks of the W. I. to all who had assisted in making the dedication a success. Warden Taylor said that the service was another example of the splendid work the Women’s Institute is doing throughout the country. He gave a very interesting account of the meaning of “The Two Minutes’ Silence”.\n\nA beautiful Union Jack covered the face of the cairn, and, at the proper moment, it was reverently drawn aside by Mrs. J. L. Moore, whose son, Gordon, is sleeping in Flanders, and Mrs. John Thompson, of Mapleton, mother of Herbert Thompson, who served in the air force, and of Dr. George Thompson, a former physician in the village. After the unveiling, Warden Taylor introduced both ladies to the large assembly. The unveiling was followed by a very impressive prayer offered by Rev. G. E. Morley. The impressive service of dedication was performed by Captain, the Rev. J. A. Davies, Chaplain of the Elgin Regiment. From the touching address which preceded the ceremony to the closing prayer, there was a silence that clearly indicated the solemnity with which the audience listened.\n\nReeve Taylor, in announcing the roll call, asked each returned man to hold up his right hand. He first read the list of nine men who had made the supreme sacrifice, and followed with the veterans.\n\nPlacing of Wreaths\n\nThe placing of the wreaths was a beautiful part of the ceremony. “D” Company’s wreath was placed by Major Haines, of Aylmer. The Canadian Legion and Ladies’ Auxiliary was placed by H. Farrell and Mrs. Rawlings, of Aylmer, whom the chairman introduced as an overseas nurse. John Allison was wreath bearer. The Springfield Veterans’ wreath was placed by J. A. Wharton, who was welcomed home from South Africa thirty years ago, by just such a crowd as filled the park Sunday. Mrs. W. I. Atkin placed the Women’s Institute wreath, the bearer being A. E. Davies. The Springfield Council, Reeve Newell, with Norman Charlton as bearer. Mrs. Atkin was introduced as the mother of two soldiers, one of whom won the M.C. A. Love, W.M. of Springfield Lodge, A.F. & A.M. No. 259 placed the Lodge Wreath, with Stewart Black as bearer. The I.O.O.F. and Arkess Rebekah offering was handed to F. E. Martin and Mrs. W. Cathers by Fred Martin. Charles North handed J. L. Moore, father of Gordon Moore, the wreath presented by the parents in memory of their son, while Mrs. Carl Vincent, received from the hands of her brother, Kenneth, the wreath from the brothers, sisters and nephews. All three were presented to audience. Then followed the Black family wreath, borne by N. R. Martin, and placed by Stewart Black, one of the three sons of the late M. M. Black, all of whom served nobly during the war. Stewart was a prisoner for many months in a German prison. W. Peckham placed the wreath donated by his firm, receiving it from the hands of Bert Hobbins. The last, a wreath contributed by the members of the Malahide Council in this district, was placed by Deputy Reeve Newell and B. Disbrowe.\n\nThe dipping of the Colors, Last Post and Reveille, made a fitting conclusion for this beautiful service. Nothing finer has ever been heard in Springfield than Rev. G. E. Morley’s rendering of “In Flanders Fields” which was followed by the Reveille. Then came the National Anthem, played by the band. A most fitting conclusion was the benediction, which was pronounced by Rev. Hiel Wood, now in his 97th year, and who is a son of a veteran who won a medal at Niagara in the War of 1812. Before pronouncing the benediction, Mr. Wood gave a short address, of which a much younger man might well be proud.\n\nAfter the benediction, the soldiers marched around the block, and across to the I.O.O.F. where lunch was served.\n\nThe Women’s Institute are deeply indebted to the Elgin Regimental Band and color party from St. Thomas, and to Major Haines and his company from Aylmer, to the Legion and veterans who helped so much to make the service a success. They appreciate very much the warm support given them by the Village Council, Rev. G. H. Morley, and the I.O.O.F., who gave them the freedom of their hall for the entertainment of their guests. Much of the success of the program is due to the splendid handling of it by Warden Taylor, and to the splendid assistance of Alfred Davies, who spared no pains to assist the committee in every way possible.\n\nThe memorial guard was composed of Sergeants C. McCabe, R. H. Dobbie, H. Lock, and W. Gifford. They were under the command of Sergeant McCabe.\n\nInscribe Names Later\n\nThe memorial is a cobble stone cairn on a cement platform. It is oblong in form, with a curved top. It faces the north, and on that side is a granite tablet bearing the words, “In Memory of the Men of Springfield and South Dorchester, who fell, and in Honor of Those Who Served in the Great War, 1914-1918″. The names of all who participated will be placed on tablets on the sides, later on, it is hoped, by next Armistice Day.\n\nThe unveiling of the cairn is now a matter of history, and it is safe to say that it will go down in the annals of Springfield as one of the events in the history of the village. Over two hundred veterans registered, and it is estimated that fully twelve hundred people were present. It was a home-coming of old boys and girls, as well as a memorial dedication, every one being anxious to witness the honor being shown to the boys.\n\nNo church service on Sunday was ever conducted with greater reverence than that which on Sunday seemingly impressed the audience and participants alike.\n\nThe Cenotaph in Aylmer:\n\nIN HONOURED MEMORY OF\n\nTHE MEN OF\n\nAYLMER AND MALAHIDE\n\nWHO FOUGHT AND DIED\n\nFOR KING AND COUNTRY\n\nIN THE GREAT WAR\n\n1914 – 1918\n\nAntill\n\nG.

Wallace Antill\n\n123541\n\nWallace Antill was a native of Broughton Astley in Leicester, England, the son of (Henry) Harry Swain Antill and his wife Ada Scott. His father was employed as a grocer’s warehouseman, and the family was living in the Parish of St. Mark’s, Leicester on the 1901 England census. The family included: Henry, age 34, his wife Ada, age 32, and children Alice, age 11, Wallace, age 9, William, age 6, Harold, age 3, and Lily, age 1.\n\nWallace was born on November 28, 1891, and while living in England had served two years in the Leicester Militia. An entry found in the 1911 census for Malahide Township (Dist. 5, page 6), undoubtedly refers to Wallace, even though the name is given as “Walter”. He was a labourer, age 19, born December 1891 in England, who emigrated in 1910. He was living with Francis & Bessie Sansburn. One year later, he was living in Sparta when he married Arabella Alice Cleaver of Jaffa, on September 11, 1912 in Aylmer. She was the daughter of William & Bessie (Draper) Cleaver. Wallace and Alice farmed in Malahide following their marriage.\n\nWallace enlisted for service on September 18, 1915 in Aylmer. He served with the 91st Battalion, but was part of the 75th Battalion of Canadian Infantry (Central Ontario Regiment) at the time of his death on November 18, 1916, at the age of 24. His name is recorded on the Vimy Memorial, Pas de Calais, France.\n\nA letter to the Editor of the Aylmer Express by Corp. W. Antill was printed in the February 3, 1916 edition: (there are other letters regarding the background of the issue, not reprinted here).\n\nSt. Thomas, Jan. 31, 1916\n\nAylmer Express, Aylmer, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the London Free Press this morning one can read the speech made by the man who a few weeks ago visited the 91st Battalion Barracks, in this city. He was very patriotic on that occasion remarking that he, with others, had the money and because he could not fight himself, would help look after the wives of those who could, and would help fight his battles. Today he is even against a soldier’s wife dressing respectably. Supposing for instance, he did see a soldier’s wife dressed in silk. Is she not worth all the silk that money can buy? When a woman gives up her husband to fight for his country, she is taking a great chance. He may return or he may not. If he is killed in action all the money in this world cannot equal his worth to his wife. If this patriotic man was to spend his spare time hunting up some of the single men around Aylmer, instead of noticing the style of dress worn by our soldier wives, I think he would be doing greater work for the Patriotic Association. Thanking you for your valuable time and space.\n\nYours truly, Corp. W. Antill, A Co., 91st Batt., St. Thomas\n\nNews of his death was recorded in the Aylmer Express, December 14, 1916:\n\nANOTHER MALAHIDE MAN KILLED IN ACTION\n\nMrs. W. Antell, who now resides at Jaffa, with her parents, Mr and Mrs Cleaver, received a telegram on Thursday of last week, announcing the sad news of the death of her husband, Pte. W. Antell, who was killed in action on November 18th. Pte. Antell was a very popular member of the 91st Battalion, and previous to enlisting made his home in Malahide. He leaves beside his wife, two small children. Much sympathy is felt for the bereaved family.\n\nA letter sent to Mrs. Antill from Lieut. W. D. Harding was printed in the Aylmer Express, December 28, 1916:\n\nPTE. ANTILL KILLED AT THE MOMENT OF VICTORY\n\nParticulars of his Death are sent to Mrs. Antill by Lieut. Harding\n\nMemorial Service to be Held in Trinity Church Next Sunday Evening for\n\nPtes. Antill and Startup, whose Death was Reported Last Week\n\nFrance, Nov. 28th, 1916\n\nMrs. W. Antill, Aylmer, Ont.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nDoubtless ‘ere this letter is received you will have heard of your husband’s death in France, on Saturday, November 18th. As officer with whom your husband was most intimate I wish to convey to you my sincere sympathy in the loss of one whom you loved to deeply and who was so much respected by his comrades in France. To the best of my knowledge I shall try to give you the details which I am sure you are anxious to learn. On November 18th, on Saturday morning at 6:10 a.m., the 75th Battn. took part in an assault on the German trenches. We successfully captured the position, but many of our brave fellows were killed or wounded on the battlefield. The price of victory was dearly paid. Your husband jumped over the parapet with Corp. MacAteer at 6:10 and advanced with his platoon toward the German lines. It was a glorious charge. Our fellows reached the German trench, captured the position and captured many prisoners. At the moment of victory, when our men were successfully entering the German trench, your husband was wounded by a rifle shot. He died a couple of hours later and was buried by his comrades close to the spot where he fell, and near the trench which he so bravely helped to capture. Honour and pride can never give back your husband whom you loved so dearly, but I feel sure that he could not have had a more glorious death and although you mourn him deeply you and your family will feel proud of the brave manner in which he acquitted himself and of the honour which he has brought to his friends. We all feel his loss deeply and both officers and men, and most especially myself, wish to convey to you our very sincere sympathies. Yours very truly, W. D. HARDING, Lieut., 75th Bn. Canadians\n\nWallace & Alice Antill’s two children were Muriel B. Antill who was married on November 25, 1933 to Stanley J. Armstrong, of Thamesford; and John Cleaver Antill, who married Lillian M. Graham of London about 1942.\n\nAlice A. Antill (1889 – 1983) is buried in Woodland Cemetery, London\n\nAn article about a memorial service held for Pte. Antill and Pte. Startup was found in the St. Thomas Journal, January 2, 1917. This article can be found on the page for Pte. Startup.\n\nPte. Orlo Grant Ballah\n\n189596\n\nOrlo Grant Ballah was born o n December 18, 1897 at lot 12, concession 8, South Dorchester Township, a son of James Albert Ballah (1857-1947) & Sarah Belinda Sherk (1857-1935). They were married in South Dorchester on February 22, 1882, and farmed there for several years. Other members of the family were: Ettie Ray (1882); William (1884); George Dustin (1886); Alberta Victoria (1888); Alma Gertrude (1889); Mary Ellen (1891), and Norma Violet (1902). The family appears on the South Dorchester census in 1901 (Div. 2, page 3), and 1911 (Div. 9, page 4). Grant Ballah enlisted for service on December 8, 1915 in St. Thomas. He gave his occupation as druggist, and was not married. He had previous militia service with the 30th Battery C.F.A.\n\nAt the time of his death on May 3, 1917 at the age of 18, he was serving with the 2nd Battalion of Canadian Infantry, Eastern Ontario Regiment. His name appears on the Vimy Memorial. He died in the battle at Fresnoy.\n\nAnnouncement of his death appeared in the Aylmer Express, May 24, 1917:\n\nWord was received last Friday that Pte. Grant Ballah, son of Mrs. J. A. Ballah, Sydenham Street, had been killed in action on May 3rd last. Pte. Ballah was a member of the 91st Batt., and was very popular with his comrades. Much sympathy is felt for the mother.\n\nHis death was also reported in the St. Thomas Daily Times, May 19, 1917:\n\nPTE. GRANT BALLAH DIES OF WOUNDS\n\nWas Former Bank Clerk at Harrietsville\n\nAylmer, May 19 – Word was received here yesterday that Private Grant Ballah, who was reported in the casualty lists a few days ago as wounded, had since died of his wounds. Pte. Ballah enlisted with the 91st Batt. He was formerly a clerk in the Bank of Nova Scotia at Harrietsville. Besides his parents he is survived by one brother, at the front, and two sisters.\n\nGrant’s name appears on his parents’ tombstone in Aylmer cemetery.\n\nA detailed article with letters written by Grant was compiled by the Aylmer & District Museum and appeared in the Aylmer Express, November 17, 2010, page 3.\n\nMrs. Ballah’s obituary appeared in the Aylmer Express, June 20, 1935:\n\nMRS. ALBERT BALLAH PASSES\n\nResident of Aylmer for 19 Years. Formerly Lived in South Dorchester\n\nSarah Ballah, beloved wife of Alert Ballah, Sydenham street, Aylmer, passed away early Monday morning after an illness of four weeks. She was in her 78th year and was born in Walpole township. She lived practically all her life in South Dorchester, and for the past nineteen years resided in Aylmer, where she leaves a host of friends. Her parents were the late Mr and Mrs James Sherk. Mrs. Ballah was a member of the Aylmer Baptist church, of the Get Acquainted Class, and of the Mission Circile and Ladies’ Aid. One son, Grant Ballah, was killed overseas during the Great War. She leaves to mourn besides her husband, two sons and five daughters: Will, of Fort Erie; Dustin, of South Dorchester; Mrs. Beson Barr, Dorchester Station; Mrs. Gordon Barons, Harrietsville; Mrs. Herb. Cohoon, Sparta; Miss Mayme Ballah, Walkerville; Mrs. Carl Allen, Aylmer; one sister, Miss M. C. Sherk, of London; one brother, E. Sherk of Brantford, and several grandchildren. A private service was held at her late residence, Sydenham street east, on Wednesday, June 19th at 2:30 o’clock p.m. Interment was made in the Aylmer cemetery.\n\nE Barker\n\nThe name of E. Barker appears on the cenotaph in Aylmer, but unfortunately, he cannot be positively identified. There is however, record of an Edward William Frank Baker, service number 189322, who enlisted for service on November 7, 1915 in Aylmer. His address was Aylmer, but was born in Kilarney, Ireland. He lists his next of kin as Amos Anger (or Auger), of Amhertsburg, Ontario, guardian. He was born August 13, 1893, was a farmer, and was not married. It cannot be determined if this man was killed in action. The records of the Veterans Affairs of Canada do not list any soldier by the surname Baker or Barker with a matching service number.\n\nThe above Edward William Frank Baker is found in a list of recruits in the Aylmer Express, December 2, 1915 (article found earlier in this publication)\n\nThere is also record of an Earle Victor Barker, who died May 12, 1917 in France, age 20, #141854. He was born Sept. 20, 1896 in Paris, Ontario, and enlisted Aug. 6, 1915 in Niagara. He was the son of Clifford B. & Alice Barker of Paris. The family is found on the 1901 and 1911 census in Paris. It is possible this man had lived in the Aylmer area prior to enlisting, but no record of that has been located.\n\nIt is also possible that the name “E. Barker” found on the Aylmer Cenotaph refers to Albert Barker, whose information will be found in this volume.\n\nPte. Harry Arthur Blashill\n\n190193\n\nHarry Arthur Blashill was born July 10, 1892 in Aylmer, the son of George Blashill & Catherine Elson. The family is found in the 1901 Malahide Township census (Div. 4, page 3), where other members of the family enumerated are Harry’s siblings: George (1880); Kate (1883); Albert (1885); Betsy (1888); and Floy(d) (1895). By 1911, the family is living in Aylmer, and only Harry and Floyd are residing at home with their parents. Harry became a butcher by trade, and also served in the 1st Hussars in London, Ont. On October 8, 1913 he was married in Aylmer to Mima Thompson of Aylmer, the daughter of George Thompson & Elizabeth Ramsey. Mima was born in Perth, Scotland.\n\nHarry enlisted for service in St. Thomas on March 31, 1916 and served with the 91st Battalion. At the time of his death on April 9, 1917, he was serving with the 73rd Battalion of Canadian Infantry (Quebec Regiment). His name appears on the Vimy Memorial, Pas de Calais, France. He was 27 years of age.\n\nA letter written by Harry to a friend in Aylmer was published in the Aylmer Express, August 3, 1916:\n\nHOPES BRAVE YOUNG MEN IN AYLMER ARE HAVING"
