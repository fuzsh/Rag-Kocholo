Posted under control of 2AFC. In September 1917 assigned to [British] No.4 SQN Royal Flying Corps. Wounded in the head while working as a wireless operator with an Artillery Battery, receiving signals from 4RFC RE8s, during the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele). Died 16.11.1917.\n\nLieutenant Albert GRIGGS. Posted to 2AFC as a DH5 pilot. Shot down by ground fire in the Battle of Cambrai. 23.11.17.\n\nLieutenant Sydney Winton AYERS. Posted to 2AFC as a DH5 pilot. Fatally wounded in the abdomen by ground fire in the Battle of Cambrai. Successfully crash-landed his fighter but died of his wounds in hospital. 24.11.17.\n\nLieutenant Harold CORNELL. Posted to 2AFC as a DH5 pilot. Killed in flying accident at Baizeuex aerodrome on the Western Front, 11.12.17.\n\n2nd Lieutenant Albert Mendelssohn ANDERSON. Posted to 4AFC as a Sopwith Camel pilot. Killed in a flying accident during a familiarisation flight behind the Allied lines on 6.1.18. This tragic collision - in close formation - also claimed the lives of two other 4AFC Camel pilots.\n\nLieutenant Jack Keith CURWEN-WALKER and Corporal Neils Peder Berg JENSEN.\n\nBoth posted to 1AFC in Egypt. Killed together in a flying accident on 3 May 1918, in Bristol Fighter A-7198. Soon after a dawn takeoff, their aeroplane spun and crashed. 3.5.1918.\n\nAM2 William Charles SHILCOCK. Rigger posted to 4AFC in December 1917. He served on the Western Front until the Armistice, then moved to Cologne, Germany, with 2AFC as part of the Allied Occupation Force. Became ill with influenza on 17 January 1919 and died on the following day from Pneumonia, 18.01.1919.\n\nAM1 Henri Louis BULAND. Served at Gallipoli and later transferred to the AFC. In January 1918 he joined 3AFC and served as the Official Photographer to the AFC, until he was invalided to the UK with a leg injury in August 1918 and transferred to the AFC training base at Leighterton, Gloucestershire. In early 1919 Henri fell victim to the Influenza Pandemic. He died on 10.2.19 and a package containing his photographic equipment was sent back to Australia. Efforts were made to trace his next of kin, but in 1926 the equipment and photographs were deposited with the AWM. Buried in Leighterton Church Cemetery [the AFCs British Valhalla], Gloucestershire, England.\n\nLieutenant James Stuart ROSS. Posted to 2AFC as an SE5A pilot. Survived aerial combat and also the influenza pandemic, but was killed in a post-WW1 flying accident, on 13.11.19 - only five minutes into the \"Great England to Australia Air Race.\"\n\nSergeant Abner Gilchrist DALZELL, MSM, MiD. (Lost without trace: 23.9.20.) Abner served seven years in the (British) Royal Navy, then 2½ years in the R.A.N. (including the invasion of Rabaul in 1914, where he was Mentioned in Despatches for his part in capturing the German gunboat Komet) prior to joining 3AFC as a Rigger on 5 September 1916. In 1917 he received a Meritorious Service Medal for attempting to rescue the crew of a blazing crashed aircraft at South Carlton, UK. He served with 3AFC in France through to 1919, being promoted steadily up to Sgt Mechanic (a senior supervisory role). Post-WW1 he transferred to the Point Cook Flying School. On the 23rd of September 1920, Abner volunteered to be Observer/Mechanic in one of two Australian Air Corps DH9A aircraft searching for the Amelia J, a missing Tasmanian schooner loaded with NSW coal. Their ambitious flight-plan included the FIRST EVER North-to-South crossing of Bass Strait by air. They only had rudimentary ocean-survival gear, but Abners pilot was the widely-admired Captain Billy STUTT (of Richmond Aviation School fame), who inspired confidence. The other DH9A was piloted by Major ANDERSON, the Point Cook Flying School Commander, and former C.O. of 3AFC at the end of WW1. Unfortunately, Billy and Abner mysteriously disappeared. They were last seen over Bass Strait, heading into clouds in their DH9A (E8616) just north of the Tasmanian coast. No wreckage from their aircraft has ever been positively identified, despite the most anguished and exhaustive search being carried out by Major Anderson over the following weeks, assisted by Naval ships. (The missing schooner Amelia J was also never found; it may well have foundered in a storm some weeks before the AAC air-search was even proposed.) Abner left behind a wife and three children.\n\nSquadron Leader William PALSTRA, MC, MiD*, B.A. Air Liaison Officer at Australia House, London. He was invited to travel on the newly-constructed airship \"R101\" on its inaugural flight to India. (In consideration of plans to extend the Airship service as far as Australia.) Killed, along with 43 others, when the R101 crashed and exploded (it was filled with Hydrogen) in stormy weather over northern France. 5.10.1930.\n\nNo.3 Squadron RAAF Casualties Between the Wars.\n\n[Draft List.] In Date Order:\n\nFlying Officer Philip Mackenzie PITT, and his crew-mate, Photographer AC1 William Edward CALLANDER, both died on 11.02.26 in the ACT's first fatal air-crash, as they were arriving to conduct an aerial photographic survey of Canberra environs. Pitt was single but Callander had a wife and two young children.\n\nAircraftsman Llewellyn Lancelot COLLESS died after Cirrus Moth A7-12 struck a tree on takeoff at Richmond, NSW.\n\nBoth Flt. Lt. C. T. Anderson DFC (Pilot on exchange from RAF) and AC1 Colless survived the accident, however Colless died on the next day, 26.02.29, from his injuries.\n\nFlying Officer Charles Middleton \"Dolf\" BLAMEY was killed on 6.12.32 in the crash of D.H.60G Gipsy Moth A7-41, whilst practising a forced-landing [for his flying-instructor's qualification] on a rural field adjacent to the Richmond aerodrome. Unfortunately Blamey's undercarriage caught a solid wooden \"post-and-rail\" fence and the fragile biplane was flung into the turf. Charles was killed instantly, being crushed as the engine was thrust backwards in the impact. Blamey's mechanic, Aircraftsman John Plumb, was lucky to escape alive, sustaining only cuts and shock. FLGOFF Blamey was the eldest son of the Commissioner of Police for the State of Victoria. [Then a retired Major General, later Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey, who in WW2 became Australias highest-ranking soldier and signed the 1945 Peace Treaty in Tokyo Bay.] Charles Blamey was buried at Woronora Cemetery in the Sydney suburb of Sutherland.\n\nSgt. Wilfred Eric BROWN, aged 32 years, Flying Instructor of No.3 Squadron RAAF, based at Richmond NSW, and Sgt. John Arthur Benjamin BUNDY, aged 33, of the Citizen Air Force, both lost their lives whilst flying off-duty in Brown's private biplane, a De Havilland Gipsy Moth(VH-UWB), which violently spun into the Cooks River, near Mascot aerodrome, Sydney, on Saturday 10.2.34. The Moth had dual controls and Brown had been teaching Bundy to fly; they were intending to enter the handicap section of the 1934 London to Melbourne Centenary Air Race. This airframe was the same one involved in Flying Officer BLAMEY's death 14 months beforehand near Richmond (see above). Brown had purchased the RAAF wreck and later rebuilt it in his backyard at Windsor. (Sergeant Brown left a widow and a son aged 4 years.)\n\nPilot Officer Donald ASHTON-SHORTER died on 14.05.37 after the structural failure of his Hawker Demon aircraft during an aerobatics demonstration near Townsville, Qld.\n\nDied Serving with Other Units between the Wars.\n\n[Draft List.] In Date Order:\n\nSergeant-Pilot Robert Frederick SOMERVILLE, formerly of 3SQN, died 17.12.36 as a result of a flying accident at Point Cook Victoria. Sadly, this was the final chapter in an incredible tragic sequence for this unfortunate pilot.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Graham Jack EDWARDS. [3SQN Adjutant.]\n\nDied attempting to bale out from his Mustang (A68-89) after a mid-air collision over Fairbairn RAAF Base, Australian Capital Territory, on 15 September 1949. Graham had been flying in close formation with 3SQN Mustang A68-83 (pilot Lyall KLAFFER) and they clashed when a 3SQN Wirraway (A20-754) doing local aerobatics cut across their path. Lyall was able to crash-land his fighter, but Graham's problems were more severe, with his aircraft in a spin. He jettisoned his canopy and attempted to bale out. Graham's parachute-silk canopy was caught on the tail of his Mustang and ripped from its shroud-lines during his exit from the cockpit at 2,000ft. He fell to his death.\n\nSGT Harold Vincent MORGAN, A32975.\n\nHarold was the Sergeant-pilot of CAC Sabre A94-940 when it impacted the ground whilst positioning for a night ground-controlled radar approach (GCA) exercise into Williamtown on 15 Oct 1957. The crash occurred at Brookfield, NSW (situated between Clarencetown and Dungog). An inquiry into the crash identified that Harold's disastrous error of not maintaining the jet fighter's altitude had probably been induced by a serious shortcoming in the Sabre altimeter, which went \"around the dial\" every 10,000 feet, and, at the time, did not have a \"flag\" to indicate proximity to ground-level in low-visibility flying conditions (such as this approach through clouds in darkness). An improved Altimeter display was later added to all aircraft. Harry left behind a wife and two young children. He died just before his 25th birthday. He was buried at Sandgate Cemetery NSW with full military honours, but has a privately-erected gravestone. [Sadly, several pages in Harry's personnel file show RAAF bureaucrats putting effort into arguing that they did not have to pay for his gravestone, as this service-death was not during war and not overseas! Harry had been recommended for Commissioning as an Officer one month before his crash occurred. [Many thanks to Dean Norman for advising us of this previously-neglected 3SQN casualty.]\n\nFlight Lieutenant Ronald Elliss OFFORD, 78 Wing RAAF (not a 3SQN member, but flying a 3SQN Sabre), Butterworth Malaysia.\n\nOriginally from Perth, FLTLT Offord was Navigation Officer for 78 Fighter Wing (the Command Unit for 3 and 77 Squadrons at Butterworth). Immediately after takeoff for Singapore-Changi on the afternoon of 11th September 1962, Ron's 3SQN Sabre Mk32 (A94-958) received multiple bird strikes. He ejected at very low level (not within the design capabilities of his seat, RAAF Ejection #20), meaning that his parachute did not have time to deploy and was killed on impact. Ron was married with two young children and had been living with his family on Penang Island. According to 3SQN operational records, the purpose of this flight was to position the aircraft in Singapore for a public \"static display\" for Air Force Week. Ron was buried on Penang Island, in the Western Road CWGC Cemetery.\n\nWing Commander Vance DRUMMOND; Air Force Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross, US Air Medal, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star.\n\nDied 17th May 1967.\n\nVance Drummond, originally a New Zealander, survived as a Prisoner of War in North Korea after being shot down in his 77SQN RAAF Meteor fighter by MiGs on 1 Dec 1951. He endured some dreadful experiences as a POW and made several escape attempts, before being released in September 1953. He returned to the RAAF, flying Sabres (including time as leader of the Black Diamonds aerobatic team) and then went on to log 381 missions with the Americans in Vietnam as a Forward Air Controller, flying US Army Cessna O-1 Bird Dogs. His remarkable career finally ended in May 1967 when (as a Wing Commander and designated Commanding Officer of No.3 Squadron) the brand-new 2OCU Mirage that he was flying crashed off Newcastle, New South Wales. The cause of the crash is unknown. His Mirage plunged into deep water and was not recovered (other than one cockpit gauge found floating in the ocean some time later). Vance had been nominated for the Distinguished Flying Cross for his work in Vietnam on one particular day when his fire-control saved the lives of many American troops. He died before receiving this DFC but (unusually) it was awarded posthumously.\n\n[Sadly Vance's brother had also been lost on an Air Force training flight, in the UK during WW2.]\n\nFlying Officer Lloyd Manning SMITH.\n\nMirage pilot killed in flying accident, out of Butterworth - 4th May 1972.\n\nCrashed near the summit of Gunung Tahan, the highest mountain on the Malaysian peninsula, during an unescorted cross-country navigation exercise at night.\n\nFlying Officer Perry KELLY, 3 Squadron, Butterworth, Malaysia.\n\nKilled 6th July 1976 in an aircraft collision.\n\nPerry's Mirage IIIO was sitting near the end of the runway, awaiting takeoff clearance, when struck by another 75SQN Mirage IIIO that was landing on the same runway.\n\nCorporal Nikolai James Taz ANDREWS.\n\nAircraft Technician. Born 7th June 1983. Died 22nd October 2004.\n\nLeading Aircraftsman Michael James Putts PUTSEY.\n\nAvionics Technician. Born 23rd July 1974. Died 23rd September 1995.\n\nLeading Aircraftsman Blaine Andrew Daisy DAY.\n\nA serving member of 3SQN Williamtown. Died 12th March 2017 (aged 26) in a tragic accident, outside of work hours. Despite his young age, \"Daisy\" was a revered leader and mentor for his groundcrew colleagues, especially during their arduous 2016 operational deployment in the Middle East. Blaine had been pursuing his dream career, having started with the Air Cadets as a young teenager, and receiving significant accolades for his merit in training. [On the RAAFs 96th Birthday in 2017, the Association placed an individual rose on the Sydney Cenotaph in memory of Blaine.]\n\nLeading Aircraftsman Simon Mirtch MIRTSCHIN.\n\nAvionics Technician. 1st August 1988 to 24th November 2017. In 2015, At the age of only 26, Simon received the shocking diagnosis that he had an aggressive Brain Tumor. His Surgeon gave him twelve months, but Simon, with the support of his family and friends, fought to extend his time by 2½ years and tick off some of his \"bucket list\".\n\nFlight Sergeant Anthony \"Becky\" BECK.\n\n14th March 2020. Age 42.\n\nFlight Sergeant Anthony BECK, a 3SQN Aircraft Structures Technician, was killed in a tragic incident in Newcastle while off-duty, on the evening of 14 March 2020. [Murdered while trying to protect a friend from her violent former domestic partner.] FSGT Beck was a popular member of 3SQN; his death was felt across the Air Force. Adding to the difficulty of his death, the COVID-19 restrictions resulted in a severely-restricted number of people at his funeral [WGCDR Darren CLARE alone represented the Air Force and the Association] and the Williamtown 3 Squadron members were sadly prevented from physically gathering together in his memory. Becky is survived by his wife Linda and two daughters. His Squadron mates gave their support to the family over this tragic time. FSGT Beck worked closely with the Association, organising our visit to the Squadron in October 2019. It was FSGT Beck who met up with us in the Fighter World carpark, to escort us onto the Base. After our visit, he sent: It was great to meet you and the rest of the 3SQN Association members. Great to see so many members who have been a part of 3SQNs history for so long...\n\nFormer Members of 3 Squadron R.A.A.F. who died serving with Other Units...\n\n[Date Order]\n\nWing Commander Louis Thomas Lou SPENCE, DFC and Bar, US Legion of Merit, US Air Medal.\n\nKilled in Action, 9 September 1950. Aged 33.\n\nLou was a very well-regarded fighter pilot and combat leader, who survived lengthy WW2 service. His 3SQN tour in the desert in 1941/42 saw him awarded the DFC for leading numerous raids and destroying two enemy aircraft.\n\nIn 1950, Lou was serving in Japan as C.O. of No.77 SQN RAAF when the Korean War broke out.\n\n[Ironically, his squadron were preparing to return to Australia on the same day. Lou was telephoned during their farewell party and ordered into action! - He took a lot of convincing that it wasnt a practical joke!]\n\nLou led Australias first strike (also the British Commonwealths first action in Korea) on 2 July 1950. [A newsreel depicts their hazardous ground-attack operations.]\n\nLou was killed in action on 9/9/1950 as he led an attack on storage facilities at An'gang-ni, near Pohang on the east coast of South Korea. (This town had recently fallen to the Communists.)\n\nOperating under low clouds and in poor visibility, Lous personal Mustang A68-809 (which had been planned for preservation in the AWM) failed to pull out of a steep dive and he crashed into the centre of the town. Lou had been appointed to the American Legion of Merit on 23/8/1950. He was posthumously awarded the Bar to his D.F.C., plus an American Air Medal.\n\nU.S. Lt. General STRATEMEYER, commander of (American) Far East Air Forces, praised Lou as, one of the noblest and finest officers, of any service, he had ever known.\n\nSquadron Leader Thomas Henry Hosier Harry SAUNDERS. [No. O5816. Ex-3SQN C.O. ]\n\nKilled in service flying accident, 15 March 1952. Aged 29.\n\nHarry was 3SQNs first post-WW2 Commanding Officer, following the Squadrons re-activation in Canberra, 1948. After 15 months at Fairbairn, Harry left 3SQN in June 1949. He later took over command of No.22 Squadron in June 1951, but only nine months later, was killed in the crash of Mustang A68-42. Harry had been flying an air-to-ground gunnery practice mission at the Green Hills Artillery Range, South-West of Sydney. (Modern-day Holsworthy Army Base.) After several firing runs, Harrys Mustang suffered a severe engine failure, at low altitude. He calmly zoomed to gain height and jettisoned the canopy of his Australian-made Mustang, but then failed to bale out. The Mustang quickly drifted out of control, stalled and dived into the ground, with smoke trailing. There appeared to be no attempt to control a crash-landing. (It is quite likely that Harry was knocked unconscious by the jettisoned canopy.) Aged 29, he was the youngest Commanding Officer of any RAAF squadron at the time. He left a widow (Moya) and two young sons. Harry had joined the RAAF in 1942, shortly after leaving school, and had seen active service in the islands north of Australia, flying with Nos. 4 & 5 SQNs. Another tragic aspect to Harrys loss is that his older brother, FLTLT John H. W. SAUNDERS had been killed in air combat in WW2, on 12/11/1941, aged 21. (Johnny Saunders had been a successful Hurricane and Tomahawk pilot with 3SQN RAAF. He was a notable record-holder, having bagged the first German aircraft to be shot down by any Allied unit in the Middle East theatre in WW2, on 15/2/41.) Harrys death was a further heavy blow for the Saunders family, who had their home in Perth.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Ian Goodwin Swan Bill PURSSEY, DFC, US Air Medal and Cluster.\n\nKilled in Action, 22 April 1952. Aged 29.\n\nDuring World War II, Bill flew his first operational tour of 102 sorties with 450 Squadron on Kittyhawks in Italy. Then another 46 sorties on his 2nd tour, flying Mustangs with 3SQN (up until the Axis surrender in Italy, May 1945).\n\nHe was demobbed in 1946.\n\nBill later re-joined the RAAF and served in the Korean War, flying with 77 SQN on Meteor F.8 jet fighter/bombers. He had completed 131 missions (having been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his leadership and bravery after his 110th mission) when he was shot down by anti-aircraft fire during a rocket attack on a ground target near Chinnampo, on the western coast of North Korea, on 22 April 1952. FLTLT Purssey headed for the water, but his Meteor was on fire and a wing broke off. He was seen to eject, but had no time to open his parachute before hitting the water.\n\nHis body was never recovered and he is listed on the memorial in the UN Cemetery, Busan, as missing, presumed killed.\n\nWing Commander Ross James FOX, CSC.\n\nKilled in mid-air collision, 2 August 1990. Aged 39.\n\nRoss FOX was an outstanding RAAF Pilot. As the Executive Officer of 3SQN, he helped CO3 Bruce MOUATT deliver the first two operational F-18s to 3 Squadron at Williamtown on 29 August 1986  an event nicely recorded in the TV News. Ross was later promoted to become Commanding Officer of No. 75 Squadron at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory.\n\nRoss died while flying in Exercise PITCH BLACK 1990. During a \"pairs intercept\" mission, which involved close formation and rapid manoeuvres, the cockpit of Ross's Hornet (A21-42) was impacted by the wing of another fighter. Ross did not eject. - By an eerie coincidence, the wreckage of Ross's plane fell onto a landscape feature that had already been named \"Hornet Hill\", 40km WNW of Katherine. A Memorial to Ross is located on this site today."
