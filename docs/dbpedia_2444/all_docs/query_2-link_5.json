        "text": "The operation was called Operation Squabble.\n\nTwo men, George Fern and Ken Gatward\n\nthat flew down the Champs-Elysees\n\nyou know 20 feet off the ground at some points\n\ngoing up below high-tensioned cables\n\nand with not much armory at their disposal.\n\nThe premise of the mission was that\n\nhe would originally go down and fire\n\non the troops as they were parading up and down\n\nbut the parade was canceled for whatever reason.\n\n(military marching music)\n\nWe took a bearing from the Eiffel Tower\n\nand came in smack over the Defense Monument\n\nand then headed straight for the Arche de Triomphe.\n\nI said to Sergeant Fern my observer,\n\n\"Are you ready for the first flag?\" and he said,\n\n\"Yes, I'm all ready but the slipstream\n\nis nearly breaking my arm.\"\n\nHe was pushing this furled flag down a flag chute\n\ninto the slipstream from the propellers\n\nand at the right moment, he let it go.\n\nWe couldn't stop to see exactly\n\nwhere the first dropped but officially\n\nit was said it fell right on the\n\nTomb of the Unknown Warrior.\n\nEven though the conditions were not as they expected,\n\nyou know that there was no clouds cover,\n\nthe visibility, you know they could,\n\nthey were spotted you know.\n\nDespite all of that, they continued.\n\nOne of the things we wanted to\n\nlook at particularly was the Ministry of Marine.\n\nBecause, it was crammed with Huns\n\nand we had something for them.\n\nAnd we were right in line at a range\n\nof about 500 yards before we\n\nlet fire with our four cannons\n\nand saw the sparks flying off the building.\n\nWhilst I was doing this, Fern was shouting encouragement\n\nand pushing out the second flag which\n\nwe hoped would fall smack across the front door.\n\nWe saw a number of German military cars\n\nstopped in the streets with Huns standing around them.\n\nBut we couldn't let fly at them because\n\nthere were too many civilians about.\n\nThe occupying forces were parading up and down\n\nalong a really important street in Paris\n\nto symbolize their dominance, their superiority\n\nover the subjugated French people.\n\nReally sort of stamping their authority\n\nthat we are occupying your country.\n\nAnd the idea of Operation Squabble\n\nwhich was conceived by I think\n\nundercover agents in France and also the British\n\nwas to say, \"Actually, we're here.\"\n\nAnd we're here and it's an act of solidarity\n\nWe are together as a people in adversity\n\nit's support for an oppressed people, um.\n\nAnd when the chips are down, we're there for each other."
