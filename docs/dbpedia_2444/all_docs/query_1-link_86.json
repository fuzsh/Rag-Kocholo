        "text": "Since we acquired new scanners staff and volunteers at Enfield Local Studies Archive have been digitising old negatives. Some of them we had already taken prints from but others haven’t been seen since they were taken. Thanks to advances in technology the quality of the images we are creating is much higher than previously. The most recent photos scanned from the old negatives show the terrible devastation of the bombing during the Second World War. Even those incidents described as ‘minor bombing’ in the ARP log books such as the one in Connop Road on 21st Match 1944 caused a huge crater and destroyed houses as well as causing injury to residents.\n\nOn 14th April 1944 bombs fell on Aldermans Hill and Broomfield Avenue. 40 houses and 25 shops with flats above were damaged. 3 people were killed and 1 seriously injured.\n\nThe Mapleton Road bomb was a V2 (described in the ARP reports as a ‘long range rocket’. It caused extensive damage to electricity and phone cables. People were trapped in the wreckage of their houses. Search dogs had to be deployed.\n\nThe last V2 to fall in the area landed on the sewage farm in Montague Road, Edmonton. One person was killed. Eleven days later the war in Europe was over.\n\nOver the last two years volunteers and staff at the Enfield Archive have been working to produce a list of those who died in the First World War. This has involved many hours searching through newspapers, school records and the Commonwealth War Graves website and matching names to addresses.\n\nWe have also had contributions from members of the public who gave us details of their relatives who had died. There are now 2740 names. The list has now been added to the Enfield council website: http://www.enfield.gov.uk/info/1062/local_studies/3285/enfield_at_war.\n\nIf there is anyone we have missed we would love to hear about it so that their names can be included. You can contact us at local.history@enfield.gov.uk Tel: 0208 379 2724 or write to us at Enfield Local Studies Library and Archive, 1st Floor Thomas Hardy House, 39 London Road, Enfield EN2 6DS. Or just pop in and tell us and you can see what else we hold about the impact of both World Wars in Enfield. We are open 9.30 – 5pm Monday to Friday. The photos are of a few of the local men who laid down their lives during the First World War.\n\nAlso added to the website (see link above) is the film of the dramatized re-telling of the shooting down of the Cuffley Airship which was brought down by William Leefe Robinson in 1916.\n\nEnfield Local Studies volunteers have been scanning more glass negatives taken during the Second World War. Some of these we already had copies of but with a new, more advanced scanner we are able to create much better quality copies.\n\nDuring the Second World War people were asked to raise money to help buy planes, tanks, ships and for China. There was a War Weapons Week, Wings for Victory, Salute the Soldier, Tanks Week. There were parades and services to promote these initiatives. All three areas purchased Spitfires. During Wings for Victory Week Southgate raised enough money to buy a Stirling bomber. Southgate also purchased HMS Farndale, Edmonton HMS Isis and also adopted HMS Punjab. They were urged to ‘Dig for Victory’, ‘Make do and Mend’ and beat the ‘Squander Bug’. They were encouraged to cultivate allotments or turn their gardens over to growing vegetables in an effort to beat food shortages.\n\nToday is the 70th Anniversary of the end of the war in Europe. Above is the front page of the Enfield Gazette for the 11th May 1945. On VE day a crowd had gathered in the market place in Enfield to hear Churchill’s VE Day broadcast. Afterwards the bells of St Andrews Church were rung in celebration. Below is the message from the Chairman of Enfield District Council\n\nThe Gazette reported that the overwhelming mood of the people of Enfield was one of relief. In Green Dragon Lane someone hung a life like dummy of Hitler from one of the buildings. The highest flag in the area was hung from the crane in Halsey’s timber yard in Baker Street. There were celebrations in Durants park with dancing on the tennis courts. There were street parties across the three districts. Although the mood was one of celebration for many families it was still a very anxious time. Servicemen and women were still been killed in the Far East. In the same edition of the newspaper that reported the end of the war in Europe there was a report of a local man being killed in Italy.\n\nAt the time of the Munich Crisis when war seemed inevitable a programme of trench building began throughout the borough. From 1939, as part of the Civil Defence preparations, the local authorities of Edmonton, Enfield and Southgate began roofing over the trenches and building many structures for wartime use.There were trenches on the Library Green in Enfield and in Pymmes Park in Edmonton. There were Auxiliary Fire Service Stations at Pymmes House and Broomfield House.\n\nThere was a gun emplacement on fields north of Slades Hill and a searchlight in Pymmes Park. Although some Wardens’ Posts and First Aid Centres were housed in existing buildings such as Broomfield House and under the Methodist Church in Enfield Town many were purpose built. Tank traps were built on railways.\n\nAir Raid shelters were built across the three authorities including a shelter at Weir Hall which still survives. The entrance is now covered by bushes and inaccessible to the public.\n\nThe majority of these structures were demolished at the end of the war.\n\nSome survived for many years after. Some still exist.\n\nWe want to try and identify any that are left. If you know of the remains of a public air raid shelter, wardens’ post, pill box or any other Second World War structure please let us know.\n\nPhone: 0208 379 2724\n\nEmail: local.history@enfield.gov.uk\n\nOr in person at Local Studies Archive and Library, First Floor, Thomas Hardy House, 39 London Road, EN2 6DS. We are open 9.30 to 5pm Monday to Friday.\n\nAlthough Gallipoli is thought of as mainly involving Australian and New Zealand troops many other nations took part. One local man described to the Southgate Recorder that the troops were truly international with English, Irish, Welsh, Scots, French, Jews, Indian and Senegalese as well as the Anzacs.\n\nGallipoli Casualties\n\nWounded & missing Deaths Australia 18500 8195 New Zealand 5150 2431 British Empire * 198000 22000 France 23000 27000 India 1700 * excluding Anzacs\n\nBy 1915 the situation on the Western Front was a stalemate. Churchill hoped to break the stalemate by forcing Germany to fight on two fronts. By capturing Gallipoli on the western side of the Dardanelles the Allies hoped to remove Turkey from the war and possibly persuade some of the Balkan states to come in on the Allies side.\n\nIt was originally intended to be a naval operation. The attack began on the 19th February 1915. Bad weather caused it to be abandoned after three battleships were sunk and others damaged.\n\nThe delay allowed the Turks time to prepare defences and re-inforce the troops.\n\nOn 25th April troops started to land. The Australian and New Zealand Troops forced a bridgehead at Anzac Bay. The British tried to land at five points around Cape Helles but were only able to establish a foothold on three before having to call for re-enforcements. French troops landed at Kum Kale after launching a feint at Besika Bay.\n\nAfter this very little progress was made. Anzac Bay was surrounded by steep cliffs which kept the Australian and New Zealand troops penned up on the beach at the mercy of Turkish shells and sharp shooters.\n\nConditions were appalling. In summer it was extremely hot and in the winter months freezing cold. There was an inadequate supply of fresh water. It was difficult to bury the bodies of the dead due to the rocky terrain and the constant shelling of the Turks. Hot weather and putrefying bodies produced swarms of flies. This and the lack of clean water contributed to the spread of diseases such as dysentery, diarrhoea, and enteric fever. Of 213,000 British casualties 145,000 were from disease.\n\nThe end came with the evacuation of the ANZAC bridgehead and Suvla Bay (10th-19th December 1915) and the evacuation of Cape Helles(10th December 1915 – 6th January 1916).\n\nWe don’t know exactly how many local men were at Gallipoli. We have the names of some of those who died there:\n\nPrivate John Robert Akers, 2nd Royal Fusiliers\n\nAlbert Howard Andrews, 6th Lincoln Regiment\n\nFrank Gilderoy Batters\n\nSergeant Garnett Arnold Baughan, 1st Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers\n\nPrivate WP Bryant of the 1st Lancashire Fusiliers from Edmonton\n\nJM Findlay Dickson son of RS Dickson of Palmerston Road\n\nGeoffrey Frangcon-Davies, Honourable Artillery Company\n\nSergeant Austen Campbell Dent\n\nLance Corporal AG Dring, 2nd Royal Fusiliers\n\nVictor Gadd went down with the ‘Goliath off the Dardanelles\n\nPrivate WH Hartridge\n\nPrivate SV Loveday, 21st battalion Royal Fusiliers\n\nJack Maller, New Zealand Army\n\nCorporal William Ernest Miller, son of Daniel & Emily Miller of 6 Allandale Road, Enfield Wash\n\nErnest Verrill Nunn\n\nFrank Page\n\nSergeant WJ Piggott, 1st London Field Company\n\nTrooper Prytherck\n\nCorporal Gordon Robinson, RAMC son of Benjamin and Mary Ann Robinson of 160 Chase Side, Enfield\n\nSub Lieutenant Eric Vyvyan Rice son of Sir William Rice of Grasmere, Bowes Park (one of six brothers serving in the armed forces)\n\nHerbert James Wigg\n\nIf you know the names and stories of any others who took part in the landings at Gallipoli we would love to hear from you.\n\nThere will be a commemorative event to mark 100 years since the start of the Gallipoli campaign in the War Memorial Garden at Broomfield Park, Aldermans Hill on 26th April from 15.00- 17.00\n\nIn 1942 Acting Flight Lieutenant A K Gatward with Sergeant G F Fern flew a Bristol Beaufighter over the streets of Paris at the level of third floor windows. They floated a Tricolour down on to the Arc de Triomphe in an audacious morale boosting exercise.\n\nAlfred Kitchener Gatward (known as Ken) was born in Hornsey in1914 and lived at 27 Meadway Southgate. He enlisted as air crew in 1937 and was commissioned in 1940.\n\nDuring WW2 he was awarded the DSO, DFC and bar.\n\nThe citation for bar to the DFC in 1944 states he “has led the squadron with great skill and gallantry in many sorties. In July this year he participated in an operation which resulted in the destruction of an enemy convoy”\n\nIn August Wing Commander Gatward led the squadron in an attack in the Gironde area. During this operation his aircraft was repeatedly hit by anti-aircraft fire and sustained serious damage.\n\nIn the same edition of the Enfield Gazette that reports Acting Wing Commander Gatward’s Bar to the DFC there is another article about his brothers:\n\nLieutenant Douglas Gatward killed in Italy\n\nCorporal Frederick Gatward, Royal Marines, missing presumed dead.\n\nAfter the war a replica Tricolour was presented to Wing Commander Gatward. The ceremony took place in Broomfield Park. The Flag is now in Christ Church, Waterfall Road.\n\nDuring the First World War local authorities were unprepared for air raids on civilian targets. Enfield Urban District Council did not provide air raid shelters instead advising people to stay in their homes. Southgate set aside parts of Bowes Road and Winchmore Hill schools as shelters. Edmonton allowed people to shelter in the Town Hall and later in the railway arches on Bridge Road. Some people constructed their own shelters in their back gardens.\n\nWith the advent of the Second World War local authorities were much more aware of the danger to the civilian population from air raids. Preparations began at the time of the Munich Crisis in 1938. Trenches were dug for people caught in the open to shelter in.\n\nPeople used many existing structures as shelters: the Underground, caves, basements and railway arches. Companies were legally required to provide shelters for their staff. In January 1939 a programme of shelter building began. The open trenches dug at the time of the Munich Crisis were lined and covered over with concrete or steel. The standard varied greatly. Some were dirty, smelly and prone to flooding. One of the better ones was beneath the car park of the Regal cinema in Edmonton.\n\nFor private shelters there were two main types. The Anderson shelter was like a miniature Nissen hut made of corrugated steel and sunk three feet in to the ground in the back garden and covered in earth. Two and a quarter million Anderson shelters were provided by the government before the blitz. They were free to people earning less than £350 a year. They were prone to flooding and cramped but could withstand anything but a direct hit. By October 1939 Enfield had delivered 4719 Anderson Shelters to local residents.\n\nFor those who didn’t have a garden there was the Morrison shelter. This was a steel framed box which could be used as a table during the day. Although this provided protection from falling rubble and flying glass during the Blitz it was no use against the V1s and V2s later in the war.\n\nAt the outbreak of War it was assumed that a gas attack was almost inevitable. Local authorities had to make provision for dealing with mass casualties. The plan below was intended for a church in Southgate. The centre of the plan shows provision for 66 bodies and there is a designated bay for dealing with contaminated bodies. Fortunately the expected gas attack never happened and although there were deaths not in the numbers anticipated.\n\nClothes and food rationing had a big impact on weddings during the Second World War. Wedding dresses were passed round from bride to bride. Many brides made do with wearing their best outfits. If a bride were very lucky or had the right contacts she might be able to acquire some parachute silk to make her dress.\n\nFood rationing meant that coupons had to be saved up for months to get enough fruit to make a cake and icing was almost unattainable. Cardboard covers made to look like icing would cover a single layer of fruit cake. Petrol rationing made it difficult for relatives to travel.\n\nEnfield Museum is presenting a new exhibition to celebrate the myriad variety of weddings that have taken place in the Borough over the years (including war time ones). It opens on Thursday 2nd April at the Dugdale Centre:"
