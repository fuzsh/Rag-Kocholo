        "text": "BY RICHARD MADDOX\n\nTHE AIRCRAFT PANEL below is part of the online IWM Collection.\n\nIt was recovered from the Hermann Göring aeronautical research institute in Völkenrode near Braunschweig – Brunswick in English – at the end of the Second World War, when the huge secret facility was taken over by the British Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP).\n\nProfessor William Jolly Duncan, a senior scientist specialising in aerodynamics and according to the IWM Collections web page, he sent it to the Air Ministry in London in January of 1945. It was passed to the museum in 1946(1).\n\nProfessor Duncan was part of a specialist team by headed by Alfred Hubert Roy Fedden a noted aero engine designer who had designed a number of engines for the Bristol Aircraft Company before joining MAP(2).\n\nThe team visited the site on 14 June 1945 as part of their mission(3) to gather information and materials etc from the research facility ahead of the Russians under whose jurisdiction the site fell – and of course the Americans and the French; all of whom wanted to capitalise on the advances in aircraft technology made by the German scientists.\n\nAfter the initial mission, MAP took over the Völkenrode research facilities – a 1,000 acre site with more than 60 buildings, including five wind tunnels, one large enough to put a full-size fighter aircraft inside. During the war fifteen hundred staff worked on airframe, aero engine and aircraft weapons development and testing.\n\nAlthough Brunswick was targeted over 40 times during the war, site appears to have escaped major damage(4).\n\nIn order to maintain the site’s secrecy, there were no obvious aircraft-related structures such as runways, all power supplies were buried underground and there were no railway lines to the site. Most buildings were low-level structures without chimneys and all were well camouflaged(5).\n\nThe panel comes from a Handley-Page Halifax II bomber, serial HR697 (ZA-F). It served with No 10 Squadron RAF and was one of ten Halifax bombers shot down on the night of 28/29 June 1943 when RAF Bomber Command sent 608 aircraft to attack Cologne(6).\n\nIt shows 23 successful missions flown to German and French targets – including four to Essen, three to Berlin, the twenty-first operation (to Wuppertal) marked by a ‘gold key’. The final mission symbol was painted by the Germans after the panel was recovered from the aircraft’s wreckage.\n\nSeven of the crew died as a result of the attack and crash and are buried at Jonkerbos War Cemetery in the Netherlands(7) (8).\n\nThe eighth – Flight Engineer Sergeant Robert Shannon, RAAF – became a prisoner of war.\n\nAccording to his Ex-Prisoner of War Questionnaire (completed 2 May 1945), he was transferred to the Aircrew Interrogation Centre – commonly known as ‘Dulagluft’ near Frankfurt – on 2 July 1943 as PoW no 350(9), presumably from a local prison in Belgium.\n\nOn 15 July 1944 he was sent to Stalagluft 6 Prisoner of War camp in East Prussia, remaining for just over a year.\n\nHe was moved to Stalagluft 357 at Thorn in Poland on 18 July 1944 for a month until that camp was relocated to Fallingbostel in Germany.\n\nHere he stayed for eight months from 12 August 1944. On 14 April 1945 he and another prisoner escaped from a column of POWs which were being withdrawn as the Allies were advancing.\n\nThey left in six columns, each of 2,000 prisoners. Both made it back to Britain(10).\n\nThe pair were very lucky.\n\nArriving in Gresse after a 10-day forced march of over 100 kms they were attacked by RAF ground attack aircraft who mistook the lines of men for German infantry. Sixty men died and many were injured in the attack.\n\nAn added poignancy to the story is that the crew –\n\nPilot Officer Roy Hamilton Geddes, Royal Australian Air Force\n\nSergeant Robert Stirratt White, Royal Air Force\n\nPilot Officer Herbert Ernest Cross, Royal Air Force\n\nSergeant David Brown, Royal Air Force\n\nFlight Sergeant Clifford Entwistle, Royal Air Force\n\nPilot Officer Reginald Eric Bradshaw, Royal Air Force\n\nSergeant Albert William Booth Royal Air Force and Sergeant Robert Shannon Royal Australian Air Force\n\n– were well on their way to completing their operational tour of 30 missions.\n\nRoy Geddes (who had been promoted to Pilot Officer less than a week earlier) had returned to flying earlier in June after being injured in a crash involving another No 10 Squadron Halifax. They were returning from an operation over Dortmund on 5 May 1943.\n\nFive of the crew he was flying with were killed when the aircraft – clipped Hood Hill, near Sutton Bank in North Yorkshire (11) (12).\n\nIn the bottom right hand corner of the panel are the names of Leutnant Johannes Hager and Unteroffizier Hubert von Bergen, the Luftwaffe crew that shot the aircraft down at 01:27 on 29 June 1943.\n\nThey flew with 4./NJG1, a night fighter unit and engaged the Halifax at around 18,000 feet. It crashed one kilometre northwest of Maastricht(13).\n\nJohannes Hager would end the war with more than forty victories (sources credit him with between 42 and 48) and die in September 1993(14).\n\nHow the panel got to the research station and why exactly it was there is not known at this time, but the names of the German crew and the addition of the final mission marking on the panel suggest that it may have been presentation piece.\n\nSOURCES:\n\n(1) http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30084551 (Retrieved 25 May 2017)\n\n(2) http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Roy_Fedden (Retrieved 1 June 2017)\n\n(3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedden_Mission (Retrieved 1 June 2017)\n\n(4) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Braunschweig_(October_1944)#Overall_destruction_rate_and_amount_of_rubble\n\n(5) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt\n\n(6) http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jun43.html (Retrieved 1 June 2017)\n\n(7) http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/206210/JONKERBOS%20WAR%20CEMETERY (Retrieved 1 June 2017)\n\n(8) https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.419623834816738.1073741826.277896255656164&type=3 (Retrieved 23 June 2017)\n\n(9) Footprints on the Sands of Time – RAF Bomber Command Prisoners of War in Germany 1939-45, Olover Clutton-Brock, (2003)\n\n(10) WO 344/283/1, UK National Archives, Kew, England.

Recognising the importance of the harbour and that of the cargo ships, two Martello towers were built to protect the waiting ships until their Royal Navy escort arrived to take them across the North Sea.\n\nTime and conflicts passed and regular use of Scapa by the Royal Navy waned.\n\nIn the early 20 century the Admiralty decided that its base at Rosyth near Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth could be disabled by mines sown across the estuary – effectively confining Royal Naval ships to harbour and so Scapa, with its rapid access to open waters, was to become the home of the Grand Fleet.\n\nAll the facilities needed for the effective use and protection of the harbour – artillery batteries, anti-submarine defences (including hydrophones), a mine field, blockships and later a Royal Naval Air Station – were built and by the outbreak of the First World War the base was ready to face the German threat.\n\nIn May 1916 Grand Fleet units sailed to meet the Imperial German Navy’s High Seas Fleet off the coast of Denmark. The encounter would be the greatest sea battle of the First World War – the Battle of Jutland.\n\nThe battle would involve some 100,000 sailors and around 250 ships; around 8,500 men and 25 ships would never see their home ports again.\n\nOn 5 June 1916 – for days after the battle had concluded Lord Kitchener the British Minister of War arrived at Scapa Flow to board HMS Hampshire for talks with Britain’s Russian allies.\n\nThe cruiser would never complete her voyage.\n\nHaving left harbour and trying to avoid a storm, she sank in around 20 minutes, almost certainly having hit a German submarine-laid mine off the Orkneys.\n\nA dozen men survived from the 735 crew.\n\nKitchener and his thirteen staff all perished.\n\nJust over a year later on 9 July 1917, HMS Vanguard having returned from a naval exercise would explode just before midnight killing 843 men. An explosion in the cordite room is believed to have been responsible for the ship’s loss.\n\nOn 21 November 1918, with the Armistice in force talks between all sides proceeding and disagreement over what should happen to the German Navy, Operation ZZ came into effect.\n\nSeventy German warships sailed to an agreed point to be met by the 193 Royal Navy ships and then escorted in internment at Scapa Flow, to be held until their fate was decided. The flotilla stretch for 19 miles and was six miles wide with the German ships surrounded on all side.\n\nHaving arrived and isolated from with little news about what was happening at the talks and from their homes in Germany, time dragged and rumours flourished amongst the German crews.\n\nRear Admiral Ludwig Van Reuter, disgruntled by what he saw as the discreditable way his government were behaving both at the talks and in Germany but determined to act with honour sent a note to his captains which read:\n\n‘It is my intention to sink the ships only if the enemy should attempt to obtain possession of them without the assent of our government. Should our government agree in the peace terms to the surrender of the ships, then the ships will be handed over, to the lasting disgrace of those who have placed us in this position.’\n\nAt 10:00 on 21 June 1919, with the majority of the Royal Naval ships out of harbour exercising and believing that the peace talks had failed and the Royal Navy was going to seize the German ships, he ordered that all the ships should hoist their ensigns for one last time and then scuttle themselves.\n\nAs night fell that day 52 ships – including 15 of the 16 battleships – had settled on the floor of Scapa Flow.\n\nNine German sailors were killed when British sentries, believing they were under attack, fired on life boats approaching the shore.\n\nMore information (all sources retrieved 26 May 2017)\n\nScapa Flow:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Vanguard_(1909)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hampshire_(1903)\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zxsppv4#zwfnn39\n\nhttp://bam.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zcxhpv4/transcript\n\nhttp://www.scapaflowwrecks.com/history/\n\nBattle of Jutland:\n\nhttp://www.iwm.org.uk/history/what-was-the-battle-of-jutland\n\nLord Kitchener:\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/f3760af0-6545-11e4-91b1-00144feabdc0\n\nOperation ZZ:\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30128199\n\nhttps://stbridefoundation.wordpress.com/tag/operation-zz/\n\nBY RICHARD MADDOX\n\nSEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY a single RAF aircraft undertook an audacious mission to boost the morale of the French population.\n\nNINETEEN FORTY ONE wasn’t a good year for Occupied France and there was no reason to think that 1942 would be any better.\n\nThe Occupation continues to make daily life in France – and indeed in all the countries under German control – difficult in many ways.\n\nFrance is physically and ideologically divided. Troops are on the streets of the Occupied Zone. The Résistance and German authorities continue the cycle of assassinations and reprisals.\n\nPower struggles between Guallist and communist factions split the Résistance.\n\nFactories have been taken over to manufacture products for the Germans.\n\nRationing continues for the French population.\n\nMass arrests of communist sympathisers started in 1941 and Jewish citizens are coming under increasing scrutiny – not just from the Germans directly but through the occupying forces using the French authorities and their Vichy allies to enforce the new order.\n\nUnable to lure foreign workers to Germany itself by the promise of better rations, the German controlled Service du Travail Obligatoire (a scheme whereby more than half a million people were forcibly sent to work in Germany) was just starting.\n\nAfter the evacuation at Dunkirk and the destruction of units of the French naval fleet by the Royal Navy in August 1940, many felt in France and elsewhere felt Britain needed to show its support.\n\nThus Operation SQUABBLE was born.\n\nOrganised by the Special Operations Executive and Air Chief Marshal Sir Philip Joubert de la Ferté (himself of French descent) the original plan was for a single attacking aircraft to fly along the mile-long Avenue des Champs-Élysées just as the German Army were parading there and – if the opportunity presented itself – attack the nearby former French Ministre de la Marine (now occupied as the Germany Naval headquarters in France).\n\nSir Philip was Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, the branch of the RAF that operated closely with the Royal Navy and – critical in these circumstances – attack small targets at low level.\n\nCoastal Command had both the aircraft and the aircrew to mount an attack such as this.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Alfred Kitchener ‘Ken’ Gatward was a leading anti-shipping attack expert and was offered the chance of carrying out the attack. It was stressed that it would be an ‘unsafe’ mission using a single aircraft without further support.\n\nGatward and his navigator, Flight Sergeant Gilbert ‘George’ Fern immediately started planning the flight and honing their skills by carrying out attacks on an abandoned wreck in the English Channel.\n\nThe day of the attack dawned and improving weather – that is the lack of cloud cover – forced the pair back to England while they were over France.\n\nThis happened not once but three times and without the advantage of surprise the mission was doomed.\n\nSo on 12 June 1942 the aircraft left the Coastal Command airfield at Thorney Island, Hampshire (just outside Portsmouth) for what the crew had decided would be the final attempt. They had decide that there was to be no more practising.\n\nThis was it.\n\nThey would fly the whole mission at low level to give them the best chance.\n\nCrossing the French coast half an hour after take-off, they managed to avoid both fighter aircraft and flak positions.\n\nAt one point some 30 feet (10 metres above the ground) the aircraft scattered a murder of crows. One lodged in the engine air intake, causing the motor to overheat.\n\nStill they flew on.\n\nApproaching Paris from the south they rounded the Eiffel Tower and then headed for the Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs-Élysées.\n\nTheir canons primed and ready, they reportedly flew at less than roof top height down the Champs-Élysées. But not until they had sent one of two banners (made from a French naval ensign back in Britain) fluttering down on the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nBut their German army quarry eluded them. The military parade – something that happened every day after midday – was nowhere to be seen.\n\nInstead the crew saw groups of French people happily waving to the aircraft.\n\nAt the other end of the Avenue, the Place de la Concorde with its fountains and the Luxor monument grew ever larger.\n\nSwinging around the 75-foot Egyptian obelisk they lining up on their second objective, the Naval Headquarters.\n\nGatward fired a volley of 20mm shells into the building before dropping the second banner and making off north towards Gare Saint Lazare railway station and then coming around westward to return to England – again at low level.\n\nLanding at RAF Northolt not far from central London, he and Fern delivered 60 photographic images of Paris.\n\nIn 2012 Gatward’s Second World War medal group, together with memorabilia about the flight were sold at auction for £51,000.\n\nSources and more information\n\nhttp://www.reemandansie.com/departments/coins-militaria/\n\nhttp://www.vintagewings.ca/VintageNews/Stories/tabid/116/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/450/Ten-Minute-Triumph-Over-Tyranny.aspx\n\nhttp://www.neatorama.com/2012/12/06/June-1942-RAF-Drops-French-Flag-on-Occupied-Paris-Strafes-Gestapo-HQ/"
