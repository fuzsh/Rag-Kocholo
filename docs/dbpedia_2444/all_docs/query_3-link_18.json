Based on the novels The Constant Princess (2005) and The King's Curse (2014) by Philippa Gregory, it is a sequel to the miniseries The White Queen and The White Princess. It centers around Catherine of Aragon (Charlotte Hope), the eponymous Spanish princess who became Queen of England as the first wife of King Henry VIII (Ruairi O'Connor).\n\nDesigned as a 16-part limited series, the first eight episodes premiered on May 5, 2019. On June 3, 2019, Starz ordered the remaining eight episodes, which premiered on October 11, 2020.\n\nPremise[]\n\nTeenaged princess Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Spanish rulers Isabella and Ferdinand, finally travels to England, to meet her husband by proxy, Arthur, Prince of Wales, heir apparent of Henry VII of England, to whom she has been betrothed since she was a child. Unwelcome by some, she and her diverse court, including her lady-in-waiting Lina, who is of Moorish ancestry, struggle to adapt to English customs. Catherine is horrified to learn that Arthur's younger brother, the arrogant Henry, Duke of York, is the author of the romantic correspondence she has received. When Arthur dies suddenly, her destiny as the one who will bring peace between Spain and England seems in doubt, until she sets her sights on Prince Henry.\n\nCast[]\n\nMain[]\n\nSai Bennett as Princess Mary\n\nIsla Merrick-Lawless as younger Princess Mary\n\nAlicia Borrachero as Queen Isabella of Castile\n\nAndrew Buchan as Thomas More\n\nLaura Carmichael as Margaret \"Maggie\" Pole\n\nDaniel Cerqueira as De Fuensalida (the Spanish ambassador to England)\n\nAaron Cobham as Oviedo (one of Catherine's guards)\n\nElliot Cowan as King Henry VII of England\n\nPhilip Cumbus as Thomas Wolsey\n\nAntonio de la Torre as Ferdinand II of Aragon\n\nPeter Egan as General Thomas Howard\n\nAlba Galocha as Queen Joanna of Castile\n\nChloe Harris as Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Blount\n\nGeorgie Henley as Margaret \"Meg\" Tudor\n\nCharlotte Hope as Catherine of Aragon (later Queen Catherine of England)\n\nAngus Imrie as Arthur, Prince of Wales\n\nStephanie Levi-John as Lina de Cardonnes (lady-in-waiting to Catherine)\n\nAlan McKenna as Sir Richard Pole\n\nAlexandra Moen as Elizabeth of York\n\nRuairi O'Connor as Harry, Duke of York (later King Henry VIII of England)\n\nNadia Parkes as Rosa de Vargas (lady-in-waiting to Catherine)\n\nRichard Pepper as Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire\n\nJordan Renzo as Charles \"Charlie\" Brandon\n\nOlly Rix as Edward Stafford\n\nRay Stevenson as James IV of Scotland\n\nHarriet Walter as Margaret Beaufort\n\nRecurring[]\n\nMamadou Doumbia as John Blanke\n\nPatrick Gibson as Richard of York\n\nMorgan Jones as Edmund Dudley\n\nNick Barber as Edmund de la Pole\n\nMimi De Winton (part 1) and Amelia Gething (part 2) as Ursula Pole\n\nArthur Bateman (part 1) and Clark Butler (part 2) as Reggie Pole\n\nMatt Carr (part 1) and Theo Ancient (part 2) as Henry Pole\n\nPhilip McGinley as George Neville\n\nGuests[]\n\nKenneth Cranham as Bishop John Morton\n\nLuka Perros as Christopher Columbus\n\nNorman Bowman as William Dunbar\n\nPhilip Andrew as Philip I of Castile\n\nLuke Mullins as William Compton\n\nSam John as Charles of Burgundy\n\nMoe Idris as Negasi\n\nMark Rowley as Alexander Stewart\n\nIan Pirie as George Douglas\n\nAndrew Rothney as Angus Douglas\n\nBrian Ferguson as Gavin Douglas\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nNo. Title Directed by Written by Original air date U.S. viewers\n\n(millions)\n\nPart 1 1 \"The New World\" Birgitte Stærmose Emma Frost & Matthew Graham May 5, 2019 0.393[1] October – November 1501: Catherine arrives in England. When she meets Arthur, Prince of Wales, Catherine is disappointed that he isn't as romantic in person as he was in his letters. She later learns it was Arthur's younger brother, Harry, who exchanged letters with her. Elizabeth, the queen, tells Catherine that the brother of her cousin, Maggie Pole, was beheaded because Catherine's mother, Isabella, would only pledge Catherine's hand in marriage if there were no other claimants to England's throne. As Harry walks Catherine to the altar on her wedding day, he admits that he initially exchanged letters with her to hurt Arthur, but later found that her letters excited him. 2 \"Fever Dream\" Birgitte Stærmose Matthew Graham May 12, 2019 0.398[2] November 1501 – April 1502: After the wedding, Arthur and Catherine stay in Henry's household for a short time. Arthur and Harry's sister Margaret learns that Henry has offered her hand in marriage to James IV of Scotland to form another alliance for England. Catherine begs Maggie Pole's forgiveness for being the reason Maggie's brother was murdered. Arthur and Catherine set off for Ludlow Castle, to set-up their own household, and become closer as they learn more about each other. Maggie Pole and her family accompany them. Arthur becomes gravely ill. Henry and Elizabeth race to Ludlow, but arrive too late. Henry informs Catherine she will return to London and stay in the royal household until they know if she is with child. 3 \"An Audacious Plan\" Daina Reid Helen Childress May 19, 2019 0.456[3] April 1502 – February 1503: Catherine learns that Isabella is arranging another alliance marriage. Catherine hides her true condition to bide her time in England, which would solve many problems for her, her maid, Lina, and her guard, Oviedo. Catherine tells Lina, and later Harry, that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated. Harry proposes and asks Henry to request a papal dispensation so he and Catherine can marry. Elizabeth goes into labor. After the difficult stillbirth, she has a vision that the Tudor line will end if Harry and Catherine marry and begs Henry to prevent the marriage. As Catherine writes to Isabella for her blessing to marry Harry, mourning bells begin to peal for Elizabeth. 4 \"The Battle for Harry\" Daina Reid Nicki Renna May 26, 2019 0.500[4] March 1503: Edmund de la Pole, the leading Yorkist claimant to the throne and a cousin of both the late queen and Maggie Pole, is plotting to overthrow Henry. Henry tells Lady Margaret that Harry wants to marry Catherine. She confronts Catherine about her alleged virginity then orders her out of the palace. Lady Margaret bans Maggie from court when Maggie states Catherine may be telling the truth. Henry learns Maximilian I is protecting Edmund de la Pole. Henry sets his grief aside to see Princess Margaret off as she departs for Scotland to marry. He hosts a feast to celebrate the future and invites Catherine. Henry makes an announcement that indirectly fulfills the late queen's dying wish: a royal marriage between himself and Catherine. 5 \"Heart Versus Duty\" Lisa Clarke Andrea Thornton Bolden June 2, 2019 0.546[7] 1 August 1503[5] – No later than 17 December 1505[6]: Catherine is torn between her duty to marry Henry and her desire to marry Harry. Margaret arrives in Scotland and is pleasantly surprised by her betrothed. Harry tells Lady Margaret, and later Catherine, that if Catherine wants to marry him instead of Henry, he will fight for her. Catherine fears her fate should she reject Henry and crush his pride, but decides to follow her heart. She convinces Henry that the alliance with Spain will be weakened when Harry becomes king if she is Henry's widow instead of Harry's wife. Henry withdraws his intentions, but reminds Catherine and Harry that they can only marry if the Pope grants a dispensation and if Spain pays the remainder of Catherine's dowry. Maggie Pole's husband dies unexpectedly. 6 \"A Polite Kidnapping\" Lisa Clarke Emma Frost June 9, 2019 0.493[8] January – April 1506: Catherine learns that her mother has died, her sister Joanna is queen of Castile, and her father won't pay her dowry. Joanna and her husband Philip are stranded in England. Henry, hoping Philip's father, Maximilian I, will turn over Edmund de la Pole, secretly delays repairs to their ship. Maggie Pole is destitute. To extract a forced confession about Catherine's virginity, Lady Margaret offers assistance to Maggie, which she refuses. In exchange for her dowry, Catherine tells Joanna how she can escape England: Joanna will persuade Maximilian to turn de la Pole over to Henry or lose trade with Castile, if Henry takes an oath to spare de la Pole's life. Rather than pay Catherine's dowry, Joanna forms a new alliance with England at the suggestion of Lady Margaret: betroth Joanna's son Charles to Harry's younger sister, Mary. 7 \"All is Lost\" Stephen Woolfenden Helen Childress June 16, 2019 0.509[10] September 1506 – 1508[9]: Catherine learns there is to be a double wedding in Spain: Mary to her nephew Charles and Harry to her niece Eleanor. Oviedo proposes to Lina and tells her he is working for Lady Margaret. Harry is torn between his duty to marry Eleanor and his desire to marry Catherine. Maggie Pole seeks shelter with Catherine and Lina. Catherine's father Ferdinand writes that Joanna's husband Philip has died and Joanna is not fit to rule Castile. Ferdinand is guardian to Joanna's children and Castile's regent. Ferdinand makes Catherine the Aragonese ambassador to England and promises her dowry. Catherine's new status allows her and Lina to move back into the palace. Oviedo provides Lady Margaret with the names of de la Pole's co-conspirators, which now include Maggie and her eldest son. He later protects Maggie's son during a raid. 8 \"Destiny\" Stephen Woolfenden Emma Frost & Matthew Graham June 23, 2019 0.528[11] April 1509 – June 1509: Henry dies. Harry reaffirms his desire to marry Catherine. Lady Margaret accuses Edmund Dudley of treason for her own illegal activities and he is beheaded. Harry pardons Maggie Pole and her children and they return to court. Lady Margaret extracts a forced confession from Lina about Catherine's virginity by accusing Oviedo of theft and demanding his hanging. Lina and Oviedo marry before his hanging. Harry and Catherine arrive in time to save Oviedo's life. Harry learns the Pope granted a dispensation sometime before Henry's death. Lady Margaret dies. On their wedding day, Catherine receives a letter from Ferdinand, stating Harry slept with Joanna. Harry denies it, and Catherine again denies that she slept with Arthur.

Edward Stafford is injured in a joust, losing his right eye. Lina conceives Oviedo's child. Oviedo, General Howard and Stafford take an army to a pre-arranged meeting point in Spain, only to be betrayed by Ferdinand, who uses the English as a distraction to take Navarre for himself. Prince Henry, six-month-old son of Catherine and Henry, dies, while Catherine beseeches God to forgive her vanity. Furious with Spain and heartbroken at the loss of her son, Catherine receives a gloating letter from her father and reaffirms to the English people that she is English first and she will give another son to England; she affirms to Henry that they will invade France - without Spain's help. 10 \"Flodden\"[13] Chanya Button[14] Simon Tyrrell & Matthew Graham October 18, 2020 TBD Henry invades France, leaving a pregnant Catherine to defend England from the Scottish King James IV at the Battle of Flodden... 11 \"Grief\"[15] Chanya Button[14] Rita Kalnejais October 25, 2020 TBD While Catherine fights to restore her marriage after another tragedy, Meg too must find a way to restore Scotland after the bloody Battle of Flodden. 12 \"The Other Woman\"[16] Lisa Clarke[17] Kate Verghese & Emma Frost November 1, 2020 TBD While Meg risks all for love, Catherine struggles with the nauseating possibility Henry is cheating on her. 13 \"Plague\"[18] Lisa Clarke[17] Kate O'Riordan & Emma Frost November 8, 2020 TBD When the plague hits London, the court flees to Hampton Court, but Maggie and Thomas More remain in an empty and surprisingly romantic palace. 14 \"The Field of the Cloth of Gold\"[19] Lisa Clarke[17] Kelly Jones November 15, 2020 TBD A great gathering in France is the backdrop to a political stand-off between Catherine and Wolsey, while in London, riots happen. 15 \"Faith\"[20] Rebecca Gatward[21] Simon Tyrrell & Matthew Graham November 22, 2020 TBD A new religion is rising, as is tension in court.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Spanish Princess blends soapy melodrama with beautifully rendered historical set-pieces to paint a rounder — if still not fully realized — portrait of an often overlooked queen.\"[39] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 73 out of 100 based on six critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[40]\n\nIn Spain, the series caused curiosity upon release, but later received a combination of hard criticisms and tired indifference. It was accused of \"wild historical inaccuracy\", and has been described by various media as \"insulting\", \"offensive\", and \"as full of stereotyping as sadly expected\".
