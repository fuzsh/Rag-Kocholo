The Charlotte Observer reports that former Thunder guard Shaun Livingston has signed a contract with the Charlotte Bobcats.

Livingston was signed by OKC in the middle of the 2008-09 season, and was waived early last year when the Thunder acquired Eric Maynor from Utah.

Livingston showed flashes of brilliance during his time in OKC, and finished out last season with the Washington Wizards.

But he is perhaps best known for his unfortunate knee injury that almost cost him his career in 2007 while with the Los Angeles Clippers — against Charlotte.

I always cringe when watching knee injuries, and this one was by far the worst I’ve ever seen. But what would a blog post about Shaun Livingston be without the video?
