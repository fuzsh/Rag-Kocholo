We now have terms of Shaun Livingston's new contract with the Charlotte Bobcats. Yahoo! Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski reports:

Shaun Livingston has agreed in principle to a two-year, $7 million deal with Charlotte, league sources tell Y!

Livingston's contract has a third year, but it is non-guaranteed. All in all, a very fair deal for both sides.
