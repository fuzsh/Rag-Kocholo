CHARLOTTE, NC (WBTV) - The Charlotte Bobcats selected Kemba Walker with the 9th overall pick in the first round of the 2011 NBA Draft.

The team also acquired Bismack Biyombo, the 7th overall pick, from the Sacramento Kings in a three-team trade.

As part of the deal, Charlotte received Corey Maggette from Milwaukee in exchange for the 19th overall pick (Tobias Harris), Stephen Jackson and Shaun Livingston. The Bobcats later traded the draft rights to Jeremy Tyler, the 39th overall pick, to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for cash considerations.

An early entry candidate, Walker (6'1", guard) led the University of Connecticut to the 2011 NCAA Championship and was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. He also earned the Bob Cousy Award as the nation's top point guard and was a top-five finalist for the Wooden and Naismith Awards.

In 111 career collegiate games, he averaged 16.1 points, 4.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.7 steals in 32.9 minutes. He also set a school single-season record with 965 points in 2010-11.

He was a member of the World Select Team that competed in the Nike Hoop Summit this year in Portland, where he recorded the only triple-double in the event's history against the U.S. Junior Select team with 12 points, 11 rebounds and a Summit-record 10 blocked shots.

Last season, Biyombo appeared in 28 games for two different Spanish League teams, Fuenlabrada and C.B. Illescas.
