        "text": "On September 13, Shaun Livingston announced his retirement from playing basketball. He could have taken this same decision, forcibly, many years earlier, if things had followed their own logic. But in Livingston's career, luckily, there was something more, which has more to do with the miraculous than with the scientific.\n\nYOUNG MAGIC\n\nThe former Warriors player was selected at number 4 by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2004 draft. Livingston came directly from high school and, for game vision and height - combined with the role of point guard - in the imagination of fans and many insiders the most obvious (and rash) comparison was with Magic Johnson.\n\nThe first two seasons saw him gradually gaining confidence with the NBA game, he who was still a late teenager with long and lean limbs against solid men. After his average points gradually increased in the first two years, the third season should have been the one of consecration, or at least he could expect further steps forward.\n\nIn reality, on February 26, 2007, despite himself, he took thousands and thousands of steps backwards, literally destroying his knee: the three ligaments blown plus the luxation of the patella, which unfortunately had caused more damage.\n\nThe displacement of the bone had affected the popliteal artery, which passes behind the knee and is the only blood vessel supplying the lower leg. If its flow is altered, and action is not taken in time, the risk is the amputation of the leg, as widely feared. A terrible injury, more common on the football field than on the hardwood floor, but so be it.\n\nFrom young promise to future regret, the step was very short and long at the same time. Months and months of rehabilitation just to recover the ability to walk were necessary, in fact all seemed lost.\n\nOf course, at the end of his fourth year, the Clippers didn't offer him the Qualifying offer, making him an unrestricted free agent. From here, Livingston made a recovery between the sensational and the miraculous, but there were no teams willing to give the former Clippers real chances, who thus traveled between the Grizzlies - then cut - Oklahoma City and the D-League, Washington , Charlotte and many others, up to the breakthrough season, the 2013-14.\n\nLIVING STON 2.0\n\nIn July 2013, the Nets gave him the aforementioned chance to back up Deron Williams. The former Utah player, however, was another extremely talented but equally fragile point guard, so much so that he ended up knocked out prematurely in this case as well.\n\nHis place in the lineup was taken, needless to say, by Livingston, who was able to show off also and above all in his own half, also playing 76 games, his career high (beaten in the following season). From there, the Warriors' call into subsequent free agency. Golden State in recent years has been an incessant destination for veterans looking for a ring, perhaps before finally retiring. For Livingston, however, the Warriors were much more, and above all the relationship was decidedly one-to-one. On the one hand, Golden State allowed the former Clippers to retire with three rings won as a protagonist, on the other the former McDonald's All-American has carved out an essential role for himself in the second unit, thanks to his innate defensive skills (favored by the slender physique), his playmaking and the fact that he is, in his own way, a highlander.\n\nThere aren't many players who systematically resort to mid-range shooting as their main offensive weapon, but Livingston is one of the few who does it frequently and above all efficiently.\n\nWhen a player suffers a serious injury, it is practice to support him with the classic phrase \"you will come back stronger than before\". At the time of the Livingston disaster there were no social networks, or at least they were in their infancy, but we would hardly have read sentences like these. What he did was unprecedented, for the seriousness of the injury and for the way in which the player was able to rebuild his articulation and his career."
