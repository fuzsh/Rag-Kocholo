        "text": "Contemplating retirement is strange if you’re only 33. It’s pretty unique to an athlete. Thirty more years of work lie ahead, but, you know that thing you’ve spent your entire life mastering, yeah, that’s ending. Find something else.\n\n“It’s almost like going to college, picking a major,” Shaun Livingston said recently. “What do I want to be?”\n\nOnly $2 million of Livingston’s $8 million next season is guaranteed. For the Warriors, so deep into the luxury tax, that $6 million hit is multiplied. They must decide by June 30 whether they’re absorbing it. It appears unlikely that they will.\n\nThat contract reality is wrapped in a real-life reality, which has Livingston — caring for a young family rooted in the Bay Area, doing more maintenance than ever on his aching left knee — thinking this could be the final season of his NBA playing career.\n\nIt’s not decided officially. He’s not announcing anything. As the playoffs near and the chance for a fourth Warriors title in five years creeps closer, the focus is on the task at hand. But during the 82-game, seven-month journey, it’s hard not to let a mind wander, to see a guy like Dwyane Wade soaking in all his final moments in every arena so nostalgically and publicly and wonder if, even just privately, you should take more time to smell the basketball roses.\n\nThat’s the current state of Livingston’s mind, toggling between the sentimental side of what was (a career rescued from crippling knee injury to become a multiple-time champ), the laser-focused side of what is (his current role chasing another ring) and the curious side of what will be (his keen interest in a front-office NBA future).\n\nSo here Livingston is, in a recent sitdown interview with The Athletic, discussing all those topics at length.\n\nHave you legitimately sat there and thought that this could be it?\n\nYeah. For sure. Absolutely. It’s just all the signs on the wall. And just more so from a physical standpoint. If I’m healthy and having fun, then I want to play. But physically, if I’m not … Like, I put so much work in my body just to get back to playing basketball, let alone get to this point where I’m at.\n\nSo now that it’s getting harder. Like this year, I’ve struggled with injuries more than any other year I’ve been on the Warriors.\n\nIs it just aching?\n\nIt’s more just for my knee. Rehab. Dealing with my knee. Just showing up to the game and my knee is, like, softball(-sized) swollen.\n\nJust out of nowhere?\n\nYeah, just the wear and tear of the grind. It would do that maybe once, twice in the previous five-six years. From (age) 27 to maybe 31, 32. Last year, I dealt with it a little more.\n\nJust middle of the season, you’ve played eight games in 14 days and boom.\n\nYeah, and it’s just swollen. But even back then, I was playing and I still felt like I could move. But any time it gets swollen now, it’s more about being able to move. It’s stiff. I can’t move. It’s sore. I come back, it’s aching. And this is all before the game even starts.\n\nSo then it becomes about building myself up so I can be functional on the court. Once I get to the arena, I got to do all this work.\n\nAnd it’s fine. Because it’s part of your job that you have to do. But the emotional part of it, at this stage of my career, it can be tough. Like, at 22, yeah, all right, I knew I had to grind. It was part of what came with it. But now, at this stage, it’s like … shoot.\n\nYou mention how much more maintenance you’ve had to do this season. Have you basically had to create a new routine?\n\nYeah, it’s just more consistent. On top of all the things I had to do during my rehab, I have to do them twice as much. Then when I do them, it still doesn’t mean I’m going to get the results. I just have to do it to put my body in the best position where I don’t get injured, be susceptible.\n\nHonestly, I mean, I’m not dying or anything. It’s just more about how you feel emotionally. Health is wealth. You feel great, so you go out there and you’re confident.\n\nBut now, it’s like, the work I put in my game has to be limited, which it has been the last couple years, because I have to go in the weight room, can’t go on the court as much, have to stay off the knee. It’s all the natural progressions of an athlete.\n\nWas there a moment this year when it struck you? When maybe the grind was particularly frustrating and you really started to think it could be your last season?\n\nUhhh … training camp.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah, bro. Because it’s all the young dudes coming in, trying to make the team, grinding. Horses, fresh out of college. I’ve never been, like, Russell Westbrook or something, but you’re just getting back from the summer, trying to warm things up.\n\nAnd it’s a faster game now.\n\nExactly. Somebody else made that point. Somebody, who was it? He said that vets back in the day, they were 37, 38, 39. Now? Vets are probably gonna be 31, 32. Might’ve been (Kevin Durant).\n\nIt was KD. I remember that. Asked him about that in Boston and he mentioned Kurt Thomas and how old his veterans used to be when he entered the league.\n\nYeah. I read that. I saw that. He makes a valid point, bro. There are unicorns like Kyle Korver, certain guys. But how many guys do you see that are 35 and over still in the league? The numbers gotta be going down.\n\nYou’ve got Dwyane Wade, Dirk (Nowitzki), Vince Carter.\n\nUnicorns. But you’ve seen a lot of the vets, the Udonis Haslems, the P.J. Browns, the Kurt Thomases, playing until they’re 37, it’s rarer.\n\nYeah, and you mention Udonis Haslem. He’s still around, but when he got in the game against you guys the other day, it was the first time he’d been on the floor in weeks. I assume you don’t have interest in holding on like that?\n\nNah. I mean, we’ll see. This is — like, I don’t want to come out and announce anything. I’ve been trying to stay in the moment. But it’s just, looking at it like, if this year or next year is the last year, it would probably be the cap.\n\nEven next year, like, I’m maybe playing 12 minutes right now. So it’s just, how much do I want to contribute? I enjoy feeling good. But, also, I got a young family.\n\nTwo kids now. How much does that factor into the equation?\n\nIt’s big. Two young kids, planting roots down. All that’s new to me, but it’s important in my decision-making. For 12 years, it was just about basketball and my career. What’s the best decision for my career? Now it’s different.\n\nYou mentioned planting roots. I know you love the Bay Area. That would seem to eliminate the possibility of going elsewhere to continue your career.\n\nHonestly, I tell people this, especially the young guys, Golden State, this is like basketball nirvana. The opportunity to play for this organization, live in the Bay Area, great fans, great ownership, committed to winning, coach that knows what he’s doing and superstars that are selfless.\n\nWe have a great situation. So going to another organization at this point? It doesn’t sound like the greatest thing to do. It would just have to be somewhere, to me, that made sense. Somewhere warm, somewhere close, that maybe the family would want to be in. But that’s a conversation for the summer.\n\nSo you don’t know for sure what you’re doing. But as you’re circling the league this season, does it enter your mind in every road city, like: “Oh, man, this might be the last time I’m playing in Miami or Brooklyn or wherever”?\n\nYeah. Definitely. I do. I think about it. I start asking questions to the guys, some of the coaching staff. Like (Jarron Collins), who played.\n\nWhat do you ask?\n\nJust ask him, like, “Man, you remember your last year?” or “Do you miss it? He’ll just say, “I gave it everything I had. Body just don’t move no more.”\n\nI saw he had a knee issue the other day. Icing it down after a random practice.\n\nThat’s what I’m saying. So it’s funny, where now, I relate more to the coaching staff. Because that’s where my body is starting to head toward.\n\nAgain, it’s just the natural progression. I’m still part of the team. I’m still part of the guys. I’m still trying to help and play and contribute. But it’s that transition. I’m in that mode.\n\nSo some games I’ll sit there, road games, I’ll sit there, they’ll be announcing starting lineups and I’ll look around, just trying to take it all in.\n\nAs you enter the playoffs, is that going to give you more appreciation for the grind? Because this season, as anyone around here will say, has been …\n\nThe grindiest of the grinds. For everybody. Yeah, I’ve just been trying to appreciate it, enjoy it. I ain’t headbutting nobody anymore.\n\nThe refs are safe.\n\nHa. Yeah, I’m off the refs. I’m just trying to enjoy it. Talking to other players on other teams. Which I never did. I was always a “you’re the enemy” type guy. I was always quiet on the court, but never trying to make friends, all that type of stuff. But now I’m trying to enjoy the camaraderie of it.\n\nI think, once the playoffs start, I’ll still enjoy the moment. But how I am during the playoffs, it’s kind of a mental lock-in. I’m strictly focused on my job. It’ll be the same mentality.\n\nAs you do kind of reflect on the twilight days of your career and, obviously in your deep past you have the devastating injury that nearly derailed it all, is this more than you would’ve expected?\n\nYeah. Absolutely. Definitely. I would’ve never thought I would’ve had three rings. I remember when I was just trying to get back to being able to play basketball. Then it was about just trying to make the playoffs.\n\nI knew how hard it was before I got injured. I’d only been to the playoffs once, possibly a second time before I got injured. So I was, like, man, if I could just get back to the playoffs, that’d give me the stage to show I’m capable of playing this game at a high level.\n\nIt just escalated fast. It was, first, get back on the court. Then it was showing I could stay healthy. Then it was showing I could be productive. OK, now show I could be serviceable, like a rotation player. All right, now show that I can do all those things and now do those on a good team, a winning team. That was Brooklyn.\n\nWhat was the big moment?\n\nBrooklyn. For sure. They gave me the platform, playing with all the Hall of Fame guys. So people were going to be watching. Being in New York. Then once I had an opportunity there — Deron (Williams) went down with an injury — and I had an opportunity to put my thumbprint on winning.\n\nThat’s what it comes down to. I never played for stats. I just wanted to show that if I could change the game, put my thumbprint on this win, then I’d be doing something right. That was my chance.\n\nThen the pinnacle was probably the 2015 title?\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nYou had a huge Finals.\n\nWe were down 2-1 in the Finals. Coach shortened the rotation. I was part of that. Showing I could contribute to a championship. It was Brooklyn all over but on a higher stage. That first one will never compare. Just the shock of it, the joy of it.\n\nHow has the league’s evolution the last decade affected you? You’re a guy known for that back down, old school, mid-range game that’s kind of being phased out.\n\nIt’s definitely pushed out guys who play my type of game. I was able to be effective playing with the Warriors, winning with them, so that’s prolonged my success. But guys that play my game, there’s really not a lot of longevity in that. The league is going to that pace-and-space, 3-and-D stuff.\n\nWhat about the 3? There was always talk that you were going to add it. You just kind of fought that off?\n\nThere was just never a comfort. Even when I played — this is going back — but I shot some 3s when I was in LA, playing for the Clippers. But even in high school, I just … it’s one of those things where it’s, all right, it’s better to focus on what I do well.\n\nYou can mix it up here and there. But for me, it was more just about bringing what I brought to the table. If I’m good at something, be really good at it. That’s something that Kevin Garnett talked to me about in free agency. Don’t let people pinpoint weakness. Do what you do. Bring your strengths to the table.\n\nPost-career, I know you’ve become very interested in front-office work. When’d you start thinking about what could be next?\n\nProbably two, three years ago, after the second championship, I had an opportunity to get a deal. I knew at the time of that deal, at 31 going to 32, I figured I was still young enough to play, but with my history, the way I’d been feeling, I have to start to set myself up for the transition.\n\nAs a guy who now studies front-office stuff, when you were doing that deal — only $2 million of your $8 million guaranteed for next season — did you kind of know that you might be setting yourself up for the possible end this summer?\n\nAbsolutely. They were setting themselves up for that. It’s a leverage play. At the time, if you don’t have the leverage, you can ask for the full third year, but that doesn’t mean you’re going to get it.\n\nSo it was just — what’s more important? Sticking to that deal and walking when I don’t get it? I’d just had a kid, all those things were becoming a factor. Bigger picture stuff.\n\nHonestly, for me, it was probably always going to be that because of my injury history. There was two other places where they gave me a third-year guarantee on my first contract I signed with the Warriors, when I was 28, 29.\n\nThis time around, did you have a third-year guarantee anywhere else?\n\nNope. Not the second time around.\n\nWhat made you turn your eyes toward front-office stuff? Because you could coach or do other things if you’re interested.\n\nI just kind of thought I’d be a better fit. Then the schedule of travel. If you’re coaching, it’s the same grind as now. Some guys maybe like it.\n\nPlus, I like putting things together. The long game. Strategizing. Being able to mix and match personalities of guys. Maybe some teams have more talent — and talent matters most in this league — but personalities play a big role. I picked up on that when I played in those 100 cities, those 17 teams.\n\nCould you name, in order, all your stops?\n\nLos Angeles. Miami. OKC. Uhh … Washington. Charlotte. Milwaukee. I went to Houston, just there for training camp. Cleveland. Brooklyn. Golden State. Nine teams.\n\nHouston the shortest stint?\n\nYeah. Miami was a cup of coffee, too. I think I signed in October and they waived me in January.\n\nHow different is every organization?\n\nDifferent. Some are kind of alike or similar and it’s more that way now. It’s become kind of a copycat league. Teams mirror each other. Organizations try to mirror each other. Daryl Morey says it’s an arms race and now that’s everyone’s, quote, what they’re trying to do.\n\nSo I think there’s a lesser gap now than there was when I was moving team to team. A lot of that is through technology, analytics, the way the league is going.\n\nYou like where the league is?\n\nI think it’s good. I mean, of course, there’s always an “In my day …” But there’s gotta be progress. I like what the league is doing. There are certain things — like the All-Star Game — maybe not. I grew up on tradition. But the ratings say something else. It’s all about the money.\n\nThe league is healthy. Adam Silver, I think has done an incredible job keeping his ears to the ground. They listen to their players, encourage guys to speak out, give them a platform. They encourage growth, encourage social activism. It’s progressive. I like it.\n\nDo you have a post-career path to the front office you’re already setting?\n\nFirst, I want to take a year off. Just off. Schedule is just free. Just being able to take a step back. Basketball, like a lot of my peers, teammates, it’s been our life. It’s been a grind forever.\n\nI started at a super young age. I was a phenom coming up. There was always this hype around me, this buzz. So it’ll be nice to step away from the game.\n\nI had that a little bit when I was injured, but that was different. I was in more of a darker place and I was obsessed with trying to come back.\n\nAnd you’re 22, 23, you’re not thinking with some life perspective.\n\nRight. I’m trying to gain life perspective. It was totally different from where I’m at now. So I want to take a year off and then I’m trying to plant seeds wherever I can in the league.\n\nFormer players, staff, teams, organizations — just watching guys when they get out the league. That’s the best thing you can do, pay attention. Pay attention to guys in front of you that have done it.\n\nElton Brand (now the general manager of the Sixers), I played with him. So talking to him. Picking his brain. Other guys around the league, texting them, maintaining those relationships. Letting them know I’m interested.\n\nI’m open. It’s going to be some work. But the beauty of it is how much I want to put into it. Hopefully, I’m setting myself up with how much I’m putting into my career, my relationships.\n\nIs it a strange part of life to be in, at age 33, most people are just entering the prime of their career, but athletes have to execute a mid-career change?\n\nIt’s a big adjustment. But it’s about watching guys before you. Some guys haven’t handled it best, some guys set themselves up well. It’s about figuring out what you want to do. It’s hard.\n\nIt’s almost like going to college, picking a major. What do I want to be?\n\nThis playoff run, coming up, it all year has kind of had the feel of like the last ride?\n\nIt feels like it, huh?\n\nCan that become the motivator?\n\nI think so. Because not only could it possibly be the last year for whoever, we got a chance to do something special.\n\nWhat sounds better to you — four titles in five years or a three-peat?\n\nI think four in five years is harder. But both, I mean, five straight years of going to the Finals. The Celtics?\n\nCeltics in the ’60s, I believe is the last team to do it.\n\nHow long ago was the ’60s? Were you here? Like, bro, come on! We’re doing things where 30, 40 years ago people are going to be referencing, ‘Oh, the Warriors. Who was on that team?’ We got a chance. I think that’s how we look at all this, the 73 wins, the championships, the Finals, once KD got here, everything.\n\nWe got a group of vets who understand the moment. All this drama, everything, it just comes with the territory. This shit is just so long. The season is so long. If we had 20 games, would we deal with it? Probably not. We’d just get straight to it.\n\nBut we gotta talk about something, gotta feed the fans, gotta keep this thing pumping. It’s the business. It can be a drain, but once we get to the playoffs, it gets fun again, we’re all locked in, the schedule simplifies and everything just kind of aligns."
