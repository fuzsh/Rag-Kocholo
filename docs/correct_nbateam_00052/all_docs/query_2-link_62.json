        "text": "LOS ANGELES – In what is the cruelest blow yet to the Clippers this season, their third-year guard Shaun Livingston suffered a dislocated left kneecap Monday night at Staples Center early in the team’s 100-93 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nLivingston was taken to Centinela-Daniel Freeman Medical Center in Inglewood. Clippers physician Steven Shimoyama said in the best case scenario that Livingston could return before the season ends. But in all likelihood he will miss the remainder of the season with what is believed to be extensive knee damage.\n\nLivingston was scheduled to undergo an arteriogram Monday night, a routine procedure administered in knee injuries of this sort, to detect whether any damage was done to the main artery that leads from the knee to the foot. That involves injecting dye into the injured region. The full extent of Livingston’s injury will be learned today, after Livingston undergoes a MRI but in most cases where there is a dislocation, torn ligaments occur.\n\nShimoyama, an orthopedic surgeon, and the assistant for the past seven years to the Clippers’ lead physician, Tony Daly, was sitting behind the Clippers’ bench when the injury occurred. Shimoyama immediately went onto the court and performed a procedure to pop Livingston’s knee back into place.\n\n“It alleviated nearly all of his pain. I’d say he was in terrible pain when (the injury) happened,” said Shimoyama, who added that the type of injury that Livingston suffered happens more frequently to football players.\n\nLivingston was injured with 8:18 remaining in the first quarter, after teammate Cuttino Mobley made a steal and tipped the ball to Livingston, to the basket. Pursued by Charlotte’s Derek Anderson, Livingston missed the layup, as he rushed the shot, and landed awkwardly.\n\nSaid Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy: “We’re pleased with the win but it came at a big price.\n\n“Obviously, it’s a big loss for us. He was playing very well.\n\n“It’s tough because it’s somebody you’re close to and they have such a misfortune happen. It hurts.”\n\nPlay continued the other way, while Livingston lay crumbled on the floor. Time was called, eight seconds later, after the Clippers secured the defensive rebound. A stretcher immediately was brought out and Livingston was placed on it, sitting upright, with his left leg immobilized.\n\n“It’s tough, man,” Clippers guard Sam Cassell said. “Some guys don’t get any breaks in this league.”\n\nIt is the second serious injury that has occurred to the 21-year old Livingston in his brief career. He suffered a dislocated right kneecap as a rookie.\n\nThat injury occurred during a post-practice, three-on- three half court scrimmage at Spectrum South Bay. He missed 39 games. Shimoyama said Monday’s injury is significantly more serious.\n\nThis is but the latest malady that has interrupted Livingston’s career. In the eighth game back from his knee injury as a rookie, Livingston suffered torn cartilage in his right shoulder in a game against New Orleans. He missed only 12 games because of that injury but required extensive offseason rehabilitation.\n\nNOTE\n\nIn one of the most ironic instances of Monday’s misfortune concerning Livingston was that former Clipper Bobby Simmons was at Staples Center. Twenty-seven months ago, Simmons was talking with a reporter after practice, less than 5 feet away from the court, when Livingston landed on the floor, screaming in pain.\n\nMonday, as Livingston was being wheeled through the tunnel on a stretcher, he passed by Simmons, now with the Milwaukee Bucks, who is out for the season, after undergoing ankle and heel surgery.\n\nSimmons, who has been in Los Angeles since late January undergoing rehabilitation, was at the game as a spectator.\n\nFG FT Reb CHARLOTTE Min M-A M-A O-T A PF PTS Carroll 38:19 6-12 5-5 2-9 1 4 19 Wallace 41:24 7-17 6-10 2-12 3 2 20 Brezec 22:05 2-3 1-2 2-6 0 3 5 DAnderson 25:23 1-4 1-2 0-4 2 4 3 Felton 33:51 4-13 4-4 0-2 7 3 13 Morrison 32:23 6-12 0-0 2-2 0 5 15 Voskuhl 9:57 0-1 0-0 0-0 0 5 0 Herrmann 5:22 1-2 0-0 0-0 1 1 2 Knight 19:37 6-10 0-0 0-2 4 2 12 McInnis 4:19 1-1 0-0 0-0 0 2 2 EWilliams 7:20 1-4 0-0 0-0 1 2 2 Totals 240:00 35-79 17-23 8-37 19 33 93\n\nPercentages: FG .443, FT .739. 3-Point Goals: 6-17, .353 (Morrison 3-5, Carroll 2-5, Felton 1-4, E.Williams 0-1, D.Anderson 0-2).
