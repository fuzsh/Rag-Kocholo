        "text": "Three years after getting drafted fourth overall by the Los Angeles Clippers, Shaun Livingston’s career was turned upside down. February 26, 2007, marks the day the 6-foot-8 point guard suffered a daunting leg injury. Livingston injured his left knee after coming down awkwardly on a layup against the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nHowever, 13 years later, Livingston is retired with a successful 15 season career that landed him three championship rings. The veteran was an integral piece off the bench for Steve Kerr in the Golden State Warriors’ five consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals.\n\nOn Sunday, Kerr called Livingston’s return from injury “remarkable” in a post on social media.\n\nVia @SteveKerr on Twitter:\n\nOne of the best people I’ve ever been around. The resilience to come back from that injury and play & lead at such a high level was remarkable.\n\nIn five seasons with the Warriors, Livingston averaged 5.4 points, 2.4 assists and 2.0 rebounds in 17.5 minutes per game. The Peoria, Illinois product started nine games in the postseason for Golden State. In September, Livingston retired from the NBA."
