        "text": "Former Golden State Warriors player Shaun Livingston has announced his retirement from the NBA.\n\n“After 15 years in the NBA, I’m excited, sad, fortunate and grateful all in one breath. Hard to put into a caption all of the emotions it takes to try and accomplish your dreams. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Anybody that has beat the odds understands the mental and emotional strain it takes to inspire yourself on an uphill war,” Livingston said in a post on Instagram on Friday, reports Xinhua news agency.\n\n“The injury gave me a chance to find and prove to myself and the world that I wouldn’t be defined by my circumstances. With my time in the League what I will be most proud of is the fact that my character, values and faith were tested, and I persevered,” he added.\n\nLivingston, who spent the last five seasons with Golden State and won three championships with the team, played 15 seasons in the NBA after being the No. 4 overall pick of the 2004 draft by the LA Clippers.\n\nHis career was marked by his valuable backup role with the Warriors as well as a gruesome knee injury he suffered in the 2006-07 season against the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nIt took Livingston nearly two years to return to an NBA court, but since then, he became a valuable backup guard, spending time with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Bobcats, Milwaukee Bucks and Cleveland Cavaliers before signing with Golden State in the summer of 2014.\n\nHe was waived by the Warriors in early July."
