        "text": "With three consecutive NBA Finals appearances, the Warriors have played for two extra months each of the past three seasons. Golden State guard Shaun Livingston said the team entered this season fatigued after taking a trip to China to play two preseason games. “We needed to get away because of the timing of the season,” Livingston said. “Dog days. You know what is ahead of you. You know where we’ve come from. Not just the past three years, but China. China was like a whole month compressed as far as mentally, travel.”\n\nA sign-and-trade scenario would be the most realistic way for Golden State to acquire James. The Warriors could build an offer around Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala to match salary and tempt the Cavaliers into making a deal, according to ESPN’s Kevin Pelton. To make a sign-and-trade possible, Golden State also would need Kevin Durant to decline his player option and take even less than his current annual salary of $25 million, in addition to moving Shaun Livingston’s salary to a team with cap space. Golden State probably would have to fill out its bench with players making the league minimum."
