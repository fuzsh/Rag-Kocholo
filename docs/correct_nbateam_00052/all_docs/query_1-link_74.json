        "text": "Bulls fans must be all too familiar with the studs and duds waiting annually at the fourth pick in the NBA draft.\n\nWay back in 1968, the Bulls selected big Tom Boerwinkle with the fourth pick. He played all 10 of his seasons in Chicago, rebounding and setting picks while Chet Walker, Bob Love, Jerry Sloan and others took care of scoring.\n\nIn 2000, the Bulls took Marcus Fizer at No. 4. He played four seasons in Chicago and was out of the league three years later. In 2001, the Bulls happily selected Eddy Curry fourth overall and got a talented but flawed scoring big. And of course, the Tyrus Thomas trade happened in 2006.\n\nBy no means is the fourth pick in the NBA draft foolproof. But there’s good news for the Bulls going into the Nov. 18 draft.\n\nSince the draft lottery expanded to 14 teams in 2004, the fourth pick has been fairly fruitful. Eleven of the 16 selections panned out, or could be considered solid choices before uncontrollable events rewrote history — 2004 fourth pick Shaun Livingston, for example.\n\nOf the five selections that comprise the misses over that span, the Bulls’ infamous draft-night trade that swapped LaMarcus Aldridge for Thomas jumps out. Which is where the Bulls don’t want to find themselves again this year. It’s obvious when teams are way off in their assessments (Wesley Johnson going fourth to Minnesota in 2010; Josh Jackson being plucked fourth by Phoenix in 2017).\n\nSometimes, though, teams just do the best they can given what’s available: Dion Waiters in 2012, Cody Zeller in 2013. They weren’t necessarily bad picks, just selections that didn’t set the league on fire, which is fine of course. Tristan Thompson, the fourth pick in 2011, is entering his 10th season in Cleveland. Aaron Gordon, the fourth pick by Orlando in 2014, isn’t a superstar but a quality starter.\n\nThen there are the Chris Pauls and Russell Westbrooks who come along every so often.\n\nIn diving into each fourth pick from the draft lottery’s modern era, a barometer of success for the selection can be gleaned. It can serve as a tutorial on how to set expectations on the player the Bulls come away with next month.\n\nAnd you’re likely to feel more confident the Bulls will land a good player.\n\n2004: Shaun Livingston, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nBefore having his career derailed with a debilitating and well-documented knee injury, Livingston was on the path to stardom. He was a cross between Magic Johnson and Penny Hardaway, and with the Clippers teaming him with Elton Brand, Corey Maggette and a young Chris Kaman, they had actual hope. Livingston’s gruesome injury, which occurred at the tail end of his breakout third season, cast him as one of the great “What-ifs?” He still carved out a 15-year career. Livingston missed the 2007-08 season while rehabilitating his knee, and he appeared in only 48 games over three seasons while working his way back. In the end, he transformed himself into a pivotal reserve for Golden State during its last three title runs.\n\n2005: Chris Paul, New Orleans Hornets\n\nHe’s a 10-time All-Star and one of the best point guards ever. His résumé lacks only a championship. If you were re-drafting the ’05 class today, Paul would be the no-brainer No. 1 pick. Andrew Bogut took that honor. Marvin Williams went second. Deron Williams was taken third. All three had good runs. And all three are now out of the league. Paul is still going strong.\n\n2006: Tyrus Thomas, Portland Trail Blazers (traded to Chicago)\n\nMy apologies, Bulls fans. Let’s just move on.\n\n2007: Mike Conley, Memphis Grizzlies\n\nThe Grizzlies nailed this pick. No one better was selected after Conley. And the three players selected ahead of him — Greg Oden, Kevin Durant and Al Horford — were each deserving. Conley played the role of floor general and silent assassin for a dozen years in Memphis before moving to Utah prior to this past season. With him, the Grizzlies enjoyed their greatest success, making the playoffs seven straight seasons and journeying to the conference finals in 2013.\n\n2008: Russell Westbrook, Seattle SuperSonics\n\nHe spent his first 11 seasons in Oklahoma City, but Westbrook was drafted by Seattle. Six days after the draft, the franchise reached a settlement in the lawsuit seeking to bind the team to its arena lease and keep it in Seattle. Trivia aside, Westbrook is the new triple-double king and will someday be a Hall of Famer. Other coveted candidates in OKC that year: Brook Lopez and Jerryd Bayless. Today, Westbrook would go second in a re-draft — still behind Derrick Rose but ahead of second pick Michael Beasley and third selection O.J. Mayo. The narrative back then, though, was that Westbrook was selected too high.\n\n2009: Tyreke Evans, Sacramento Kings\n\nWant more trivia? Evans was the 2009-10 Rookie of the Year. It’s an easily forgotten fact. No. 1 overall pick Blake Griffin, remember, got injured and missed his first season. James Harden was a reserve. Stephen Curry had to share the rock with Monta Ellis and Corey Maggette. Evans enjoyed focal-point status and excelled, averaging 20.1 points, 5.3 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.5 steals in 37.2 minutes per game. He was a strong pick, even though the Kings could have chosen Curry, who went seventh.\n\nBut can we talk about the similarities between the top five picks in 2009 and the prospects projected to be taken in the same range in 2020? Obi Toppin is the new Griffin. James Wiseman is the new Hasheem Thabeet, not in style but in their freakish size and specific respective skill sets. Anthony Edwards plays the role of James Harden as the incoming offensive phenom. And passing whiz LaMelo Ball is this year’s Ricky Rubio.\n\n2010: Wesley Johnson, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nMinnesota could have selected almost any other player taken in the 2010 lottery, with the possible exception of Cole Aldrich. Instead, the Wolves had their heart set on a 23-year-old redshirt junior. The Wolves ended up signing Aldrich as a free agent six years later, which was four years after they dumped Johnson for peanuts. Selected after Johnson: DeMarcus Cousins, Gordon Hayward, Greg Monroe and Paul George.\n\n2011: Tristan Thompson, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nHe’s given the Cavs nine good seasons, serving as the starting center and dirty work guy on Cleveland’s 2016 title team. It’s safe to say he was a solid selection. The lone blemish? Klay Thompson went 11th that year.\n\n2012: Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nUsing the benefit of hindsight, you almost want to forgive the Cavs for this one. Three of the top five picks in 2012 didn’t pan out, with second overall pick Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and fifth selection Thomas Robinson joining Waiters. But Waiters just never worked in Cleveland. He clashed with Kyrie Irving, the Cavs’ No. 1 pick only two years prior. And he played for three coaches over his two and a half seasons before being traded to Oklahoma City. Not that Cleveland could have used them with Irving and Thompson in the fold, but it’s worth noting that Damian Lillard was selected sixth while Andre Drummond was taken ninth.\n\n2013: Cody Zeller, Charlotte Bobcats\n\nHe hasn’t commanded the same level of attention as he did during his two collegiate seasons at Indiana, but Zeller is quietly carving out a nice career as a role-playing big. If he continues to improve his outside shot, he’ll have more value moving forward. But the then-Bobcats made the most of the pick in what was an unbelievably weak draft. Anthony Bennett went No. 1. Alex Len was taken fifth. Nerlens Noel, once projected to be the top pick, slipped to sixth. Ben McLeMore, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Trey Burke went seven, eight, nine. Suddenly, Zeller doesn’t look so bad.\n\n2014: Aaron Gordon, Orlando Magic\n\nAlthough he has yet to morph into an All-Star, Gordon is a nice, do-it-all combo forward. Any team would love to have him. He’ll last in the league more than a decade.\n\n2015: Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks\n\nKnicks fans booed his selection mercilessly on draft night and quickly looked silly for doing so. Now the Knicks look worse for letting him get away. Even though things didn’t work out for Porzingis in New York he was a terrific pick. He improved each season and became an All-Star by year three. A torn ACL paved the way for his trade to Dallas, where Porzingis once again looks like a star after missing the entire 2018-19 season. Devin Booker, taken 13th by the Suns, is the only lottery pick selected after Porzingis who would have been better.\n\n2016: Dragan Bender, Phoenix Suns\n\nThe top of the 2016 selection order should make Bulls fans cringe: Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Bender. Boom. Boom. Boom. Bust. What’s worse for the Suns is Kris Dunn, Buddy Hield and Jamal Murray were taken in succession following Bender. And Domantas Sabonis went 11th. While any of those four would have been better than Bender, this also wasn’t the strongest class. The rest of the lottery was lackluster: Marquese Chriss, Jakob Poeltl, Thon Maker, Taurean Prince, George Papagiannis and Denzel Valentine.\n\n2017: Josh Jackson, Phoenix Suns\n\nIt’s got to be rough rooting for the Suns. Phoenix had the fourth pick in back-to-back seasons only to blow it both times. Jackson didn’t seem like a bad pick. He had/has all the talent and toughness to be a tremendous player. But for various reasons, he couldn’t figure it out and needed to be let go. This time, the lottery was loaded. De’Aaron Fox, Jonathan Isaac and Lauri Markkanen went five, six, seven. Donovan Mitchell was selected 13th. Bam Adebayo was picked 14th. Strong draft.\n\n2018: Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies\n\nTrae Young, selected one spot later, is the only other player you could argue the Grizzles should have taken. But Memphis ended up with Ja Morant with the second pick the following year so the Grizzlies are just fine. Jackson is a rising star who should team with Morant to form a dangerous duo the Grizzlies can build around for the next decade. Memphis landed exactly what teams seek when selecting in the top five.\n\n2019: De’Andre Hunter, Los Angeles Lakers (traded to Atlanta)\n\nThe jury is still out on Hunter, whose draft rights immediately were traded to Atlanta (via New Orleans). But by no means does he appear to be a bad selection. So much of Hunter’s development will depend on the guidance he receives from Atlanta’s coaches and front office. The same will be true for whichever player steps onto the Bulls. Drafting the talent is just the first step.\n\n(Photo: Jesse D. Garrabrant / NBAE via Getty Images)"
