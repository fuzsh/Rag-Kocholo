        "text": "Shaun Livingston has been the savior for the Brooklyn Nets this season. When the record was down and everyone injured it was him who not only started in place of Deron Williams, but came in and produced greatly and made the Nets get hot and win multiple games. Livingston averaged 8 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists a game, but his presence on the court was more important than what the stats say. Playing 76 games and starting 54 of them, he was the point guard on the team when Deron Williams was often injured and even when he came back handled the ball extremely well. Only averaging one turnover a game, he was a welcomed site to Nets fans when the season looked over.\n\nWhen Livingston first signed with the Nets in July, Jason Kidd loved his game and felt he would fit into his system. Many people and fans didn’t care about the signing and didn’t think he would have an impact on the team. Before the season Livingston was a journeyman and didn’t play a lot since he had a horrific knee injury in 2007 as a member of the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe injury really set his career back a while as he struggled to stay on one team. After his injury we went to the Heat, Thunder, Washington, Charlotte, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Washington again. He missed a lot of games in that span or was signed later in the season. He wanted to find a home and he believed he found a home in Brooklyn. At 6’7 175 pounds, his long and skinny build helps him grab rebounds and post smaller defenders. He is also a good defender that can guard guards and forwards.\n\nHis story of resurgence is a good story because Jason Kidd gave him a chance and he took advantage of it. Also the early injuries the Nets had gave Livingston to shine. Kidd’s new system of post up and kick benefited Livingston as his height and rebounding ability forced Jason Kidd to keep him on the floor instead of Tyshawn Taylor. When Deron Williams finally came back from injury, he elected to come off the bench because he knew Livingston was in a zone and was playing great.\n\nWhen the Nets went to the small lineup after Brook Lopez season ending injury, Livingston really thrived. The lineup of him, Williams, Johnson, Pierce, and Garnett really fit his style and he was the primary ball handler. He could pass the ball to Williams or Johnson and then move without the ball to the basket. With the Nets not having a post presence he became that; his turn around and pull up jumpshot are almost automatic inside the free throw line and when cut baseline he creates offense for himself or a pass to an open shooter.\n\nShaun Livingston has been a gift to the Nets this season because of his play and his contract. The main goal of the off season will be to re-sign Shaun Livingston because of his play and how he fits into the offense. If he signs with Brooklyn it will only be on a veteran minimum, but Livingston has said he will look at all options because at 28 he know that it could be his last big contract. The Nets should hope Livingston chooses loyalty over cash because they found a diamond in the rough with Livingson."
