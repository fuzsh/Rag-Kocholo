        "text": "They want to bring back Paul Pierce, Shaun Livingston and Alan Anderson, but with Kidd apparently headed for the door, it might give the players reason to search for better situations elsewhere. Livingston made it known previously that Kidd was a major reason why he settled for the veteran’s minimum with the Nets, taking less to play for him with hopes of contending for a title. A league source reiterated Sunday that Kidd’s influence was “absolutely” a factor in Livingston’s decision to come to Brooklyn. So if Kidd is not back on the bench, the three-year, $10.4-million deal the Nets can offer might not be enough to keep Livingston around after his strong season.\n\nThe Kings are on the lookout for a starting point guard, and one name to keep an eye on is the Brooklyn Nets’ Shaun Livingston. The 28-year-old free-agent-to-be whose career looked all but over in 2007 when he had a devastating leg injury while with the Los Angeles Clippers had his best season yet in 2014-15, helping the Nets turn their season around when he started in place of the injured Deron Williams and remaining a vital part of their program even after he returned.\n\nAs for cost-cutting, how’s that going to work. With only 10 players under contract, the Nets contractual commitments for next season stand at little less than $90 million and that doesn’t include whatever free agents Paul Pierce and Shaun Livingston get. The chances of the Nets going into next season with another $100 million payroll seem high … unless the Nets starting dumping salaries this week. That is unlikely in the extreme. The Nets have a chance, if they compete at a high level, to make further inroads in the Knicks fan base. That would add further value to the franchise. Do the Nets want to cut costs? No doubt, with a $50 million loss on their balance sheet. Will it affect the team? That’s a different story.\n\nIn an interview with Livingston’s home-town local news station WEEK, Livingston spoke about the NBA Finals, his job in guarding LeBron James, who he thinks doesn’t get enough credit for being clutch, and the possibility for his return to Brooklyn next season. Of course, it will all come down to money and comfort. The Minnesota Timberwolves, who can offer Livingston the Mid-Level Exception, which can reach up to $5 million per year over four years, or north of $20 million, whereas the Nets can only offer him the Mini Mid-Level Exception, which maxes out at $3.3 million per season. Again, though, it also comes down to comfort and opportunity, as Livingston has spoken to many times before. And in this interview, he reiterates that he would “love to be back in Brooklyn.” Of course, as he notes, it comes down to the two sides reaching a mutual agreement."
