        "text": "? The Charlotte Bobcats have sent little-used rookie point guard Sherron Collins to Maine of the NBA Development League.\n\nThe undrafted former Kansas star has appeared in only 12 of Charlotte’s 21 games. He’s averaging 0.3 points and 0.4 assists as he sits behind starter D.J. Augustin and backup Shaun Livingston in coach Larry Brown’s rotation.\n\nThe Bobcats are hoping the 5-foot-11 Collins sheds more weight after injuries left him unable to work out for much of the summer. Collins is expected to make his debut with the Red Claws on Friday at Erie.\n\nCollins is fifth on Kansas’ all-time scoring list with 1,888 points and ranks seventh with 552 assists."
