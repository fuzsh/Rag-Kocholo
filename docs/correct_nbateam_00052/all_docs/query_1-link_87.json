        "text": "OAKLAND — Shaun Livingston refused to watch the video.\n\nHordes of NBA fans might have clamored to watch the Boston Celtics-Cleveland Cavaliers matchup Tuesday amid excitement for opening night as well the LeBron James-Kyrie Irving reunion. But Livingston had to prepare for Tuesday’s eventual loss to Houston at the Oracle.\n\nLivingston refused to watch the video for another reason. He had heard about what happened to Boston guard Gordon Hayward only five minutes into his Celtics debut. Hayward fractured his left ankle and was carried off on a stretcher. And uncertainty awaits as to how soon Hayward can return after becoming the Celtics’ marquee free agent last summer.\n\nAfter suffering his own set of injuries that almost derailed his NBA career just over a decade ago, Livingston avoided watching replays of Hayward’s injury because of the pain that would cause.\n\n“It’s queasy. I don’t like watching that, especially after my injury,” Livingston said after practice on Wednesday. “It happened so long ago. Seeing something like that, things pop out. It’s not normal. Stuff happens in car accidents and in football you see it. It’s just bad stuff. I hate to see that.”\n\nThough Livingston could not stomach seeing the flashing images of Hayward’s suffering, Livingston saw photos of it. Livingston then tweeted to Hayward on Tuesday evening with a “praying hands” emoji along with the message, “Only God has ALL the answers.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Livingston repeated that “our prayers go out to him.”\n\n“Boston’s a great organization. They’ll put the best people around him to succeed,” Livingston said. “To get back, it’s going to be a long rehab for him. But he’s very capable of coming back and being the same player.”\n\nLivingston said he “absolutely” is “speaking on experience” because of the knee injury he suffered while playing for the Los Angeles Clippers against the former Charlotte Bobcats. On Feb. 26, 2007, Livingston suffered an injury so gruesome that Warriors forward Andre Iguodala said it took him six or seven years later to watch it.\n\nAfter he went up in the air for a fast-break layup, Livingston’s left foot landed so awkwardly that it bent at nearly a 90-degree angle. He had broken his left leg and dislocated his left knee cap. He had torn his anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament and lateral meniscus. And he also sprained his medial collateral ligament.\n\nAfter the Clippers picked Livingston No. 4 overall in the 2004 NBA draft directly out of high school, Livingston missed 101 of 246 regular-season games in his first three seasons. After receiving clearance to resume playing basketball in the 2008 offseason, Livingston then bounced around with nine NBA teams and one Development League affiliate before joining the Warriors for their 2015 NBA championship run.\n\n“Some things happen to you for a reason. It’s cliché. But it’s the truth,” Livingston said. “It’s all about his perspective. He has the right perspective moving forward. Stay positive. He’ll make it back.”\n\nStaff Writer Logan Murdock contributed to this report."
