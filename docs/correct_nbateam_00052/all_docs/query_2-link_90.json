        "text": "Here are three thoughts on the Nets’ 95-91 loss to the Heat Tuesday night in Brooklyn:\n\n1. With Shaun Livingston’s offseason departure for Golden State, it was clear the Nets would have an issue figuring out who would be the primary defender on the perimeter this season. That reared its head as a significant problem Tuesday night.\n\nDwyane Wade looked terrific for Miami, the best player on the floor in scoring 28 points in 36 minutes. It highlighted the fact the Nets didn’t really have a go-to option to guard him.\n\nThe Nets tried a variety of bodies on Wade, but no one had consistent success. Persistent rumors about the Nets as trade season begins say they would like to land a perimeter defender. You could see why.\n\n2. It was deflating when Sergey Karasev left with a sore left side – an injury he said could keep him out of Wednesday’s game against the Raptors – because he’s surprisingly become an effective player since his insertion into the starting lineup last week.\n\nThrough the first 16 games, Karasev played a total of 21 minutes in five games; then Karasev played 14 minutes against Cleveland last Monday (scoring 11 points in the blowout loss) and hasn’t played fewer than the 22 he played Wednesday night in each of his four starts.\n\nKarasev still needs to get stronger, but he’s shown the things that made him attractive to teams – including the Nets – heading into last year’s draft, where Cleveland took him No. 19 overall: namely an excellent basketball IQ and an ability to shoot from deep, even if he’s only gone 4-for-13 from 3-point range.\n\nKarasev is just 21 years old, and the Nets have reason to be excited about him moving forward.\n\n3. Deron Williams will be blamed for a pair of costly turnovers in the final few minutes that helped the Heat increase their lead from four with 3:17 left to 10 with 1:39 remaining.\n\nBut it should never have been so close that those two turnovers — or the loose ball foul that was (correctly) called on Bojan Bogdanovic with 11.8 seconds left — would cost the Nets this game. Playing at home, against a Heat team missing Chris Bosh and also several other injured players, the Nets should have been able to control this affair and move to within one game of .500.\n\nInstead, by losing, they head north of the border to face the Raptors on Wednesday night having let the positive momentum generated with their wins over Philadelphia and Charlotte evaporate."
