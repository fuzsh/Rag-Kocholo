        "text": "Chris Szagola/Associated Press\n\nShaun Livingston and the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors have extended their partnership after the two sides agreed to a new contract.\n\nChris Haynes of ESPN reported the Warriors and Livingston agreed to a three-year, $24 million contract Friday night.\n\nZach Lowe of ESPN reported the third year is partially guaranteed.\n\nSince being drafted at the age of 18 in 2004, Livingston has been one of the NBA's most well-traveled players. He played for nine different teams from 2004-17, including the Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Brooklyn Nets, Charlotte Bobcats, Washington Wizards, Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Miami Heat.\n\nLivingston is a valuable role player for the Warriors. The 31-year-old averaged 11.1 points, 5.3 assists and 4.2 rebounds per 36 minutes over the past three seasons, per Basketball-Reference.com.\n\nThe Warriors had a lot of pressing matters to address this offseason trying to re-sign Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Andre Iguodala, but they were also able to make Livingston a priority to keep the majority of their core intact.\n\nHe understood there were business decisions for the Warriors to make when discussing his future earlier this season.\n\n\"I'd love to stay,\" Livingston told Basketball Insiders' Michael Scotto in January. \"It's been home for me, the Bay has welcomed me with open arms. I love it out there. But, we'll see what happens. Obviously, decisions have to be made and you just roll with the punches.\"\n\nLivingston was able to experience the highest of highs during his tenure with the Warriors, winning two NBA championships and playing in the NBA Finals three times.\n\nLivingston has been able to extend his career after a horrific knee injury suffered in 2007 to become a sixth man. He's capable of impacting games on both sides of the ball, making him a valuable asset for the Warriors and a big reason he will return to the team next season."
