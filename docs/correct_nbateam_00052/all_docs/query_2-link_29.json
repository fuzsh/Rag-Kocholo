        "text": "Miami Heat Trade Shaun Livingston to The Memphis Grizzlies\n\nOn January 7th, 2009, the Miami Heat traded guard Shaun Livingston and cash considerations to the Memphis Grizzlies for a top-55 protected 2012 second round draft pick.\n\nShaun Livingston became a member of the Miami Heat when he signed a reported two-year, partially guaranteed deal in October of 2008. Livingston was in the early stages of a return from a horrific knee injury that he suffered on February 27, 2007 against the Charlotte Bobcats as a member of the Los Angeles Clippers. Livingston had torn his ACL, PCL, MCL and lateral meniscus, all while dislocating his patella and tibia-femoral in a freak injury.\n\nMiami acquired Livingston, knowing that the former lottery pick was still in the process of rehabilitation and would have to be eased back into competitive basketball. Livingston played in two preseason games with Miami and averaged 6.5 PPG and 2.5 APG.\n\nAs expected, Livingston played very little in Miami. He saw action in just 4 (2.3 PPG and 1.0 APG in 10.3 MPG) of Miami’s 33 contests. By early January, the Heat looked to waive Livingston before his contract became guaranteed for the rest of the 2008-09 season.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies came in to the picture and helped Miami out in the form of a trade that would be beneficial for both franchises. Former Miami Heat scouting director turned Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace agreed to a deal with his former organization on accepting Livingston’s contract along with cash that would offset the $370,000 owed to Livingston.\n\nIn return, Memphis sent a 2012 top-55 protected second round pick. That meant that Memphis would have to finish with a top-five record in the NBA three years down the road which was very unlikely.\n\nThe trade placed Miami $400,000 below the luxury tax threshold which allowed them to possibly pursue a free agent in-season. Former Heat center Alonzo Mourning was rumored to be a target, but Miami never signed a free agent in-season. Miami also gained a $850,000 trade exception from the deal.\n\nThe Grizzlies waived Livingston immediately after acquiring him. Livingston went on to sign with the Oklahoma City Thunder more than two months later.\n\nThe second rounder acquired by Miami would only go to the Heat if Memphis finished the 2011-12 season with one of the top five records in the NBA. Surprisingly, Memphis came close, finishing tied for the sixth best record in the NBA at 41-25 during the lockout-shortened ‘11-‘12 season. Still, close but no cigar. Since Memphis finished with a selection out of the 55-60 range, Miami never received a pick.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace on the trade (via Memphis Commercial Appeal):\n\n“We did that deal for financial reasons. We made a little money off it.”\n\nMiami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra on the trade maneuver (via Sun Sentinel):\n\n“It just gives us a little bit more flexibility right now. Now we have the flexibility to sign somebody.”\n\nImage via Getty Images/Victor Baldizon"
