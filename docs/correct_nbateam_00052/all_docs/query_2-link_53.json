With an impressive career playing for the Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, Oklahoma City Thunder, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Bobcats, Cleveland Cavaliers, Brooklyn Nets, and Golden State Warriors, he currently holds a position in the Player Association.\n\nIn this compelling episode, we take a nostalgic journey back to our training days when I trained Shaun after recovering from his knee injury. We delve into the transformative process of pushing physical and mental boundaries. We also emphasize the significance of an accountable team, the different leadership styles, and managing conflicts in business and relationships. The conversation unfolds to explore Shaun’s remarkable NBA journey, highlighting the crucial role of consistency, since success can breed complacency.\n\nI express the takeaway to be, “When you’re in it, when you’re going through hell, when you’re going through struggles, obstacles, setbacks, it’s going to feel like eternity, your days are going to feel longer. But if you can just keep showing up for yourself, if you can just keep going, once you get on the other side of it, you’re going to look back on it you’re going to be like oh that was nothing. That flew by.” This episode honors the value of the “No Days Off” and “Big Dawg” mentality, reflecting resilience, consistency, hard work, and the relentless pursuit of personal development. \n\nGet ready to be inspired to work harder and be a better version of yourself after tuning in. \n\nLaunching tomorrow, January 1, 2024, across all platforms. Link in bio.\n\n#nodaysoff #ndo #podcast #podcast #manningsumner #thebigdawgs #thebigdawgspodcast #shaunlivingston #nba #basketball #athlete #professionalathlete #postinjury #training #athletictraining #basketballtraining #consistency #hardwork #selfimprovement #selfdevelopment\".",
