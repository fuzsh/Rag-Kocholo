Vote below and help decide the best Charlotte Hornets point guard of all time!\n\nBirthplace : New York City, New York\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Detroit Pistons\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nHornets Seasons: 2011-2019\n\nA dynamic scorer and playmaker, Kemba Walker was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets in 2011 and quickly became the heart and soul of the team. His quickness, sharp ball-handling skills, and clutch shooting allowed him to excel in late-game situations, making him one of the most feared floor generals in the league. Although he never captured a championship or MVP award during his time with the Hornets, he was a three-time All-Star and earned the All-NBA Third Team honors in 2019, a testament to his exceptional talent and skill.\n\nBirthplace : Baltimore, USA, Maryland\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nHornets Seasons: 1988-1997\n\nAt only 5'3\", Muggsy Bogues may have been the smallest player in NBA history, but his impact on the Charlotte Hornets was undeniably huge. Joining the team in 1988 after being acquired in the expansion draft, Bogues quickly made a name for himself with his tenacious defense, lightning-fast speed, and impressive court vision. Although never earning major individual accolades during his tenure with the Hornets, he remains the franchise's all-time leader in assists and steals, a lasting testament to his unique abilities and importance to the team.\n\nHornets Seasons: 2020-2022\n\nLaMelo Ball has wasted no time in making a significant impact for the Charlotte Hornets since being drafted third overall in the 2020 NBA Draft. As a flashy passer and speedster on the court, Ball's ability to push the pace and create for his teammates sets him apart from other young point guards in the league. Although still early in his career, he already holds the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double, and in 2021, he won the coveted NBA Rookie of the Year award, demonstrating a promising future with the Hornets.\n\nBirthplace : Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : New York Knicks\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nHornets Seasons: 1999-2002\n\nA powerful and explosive point guard, Baron Davis joined the Charlotte Hornets in 1999 as the third overall draft pick. His unique combination of strength, speed, and creativity enabled him to flourish both as a scorer and as a facilitator, making him an invaluable asset to the team. During his tenure with the Hornets, Davis was a two-time NBA All-Star and led the league in steals for the 2003-04 season, showcasing his prowess on both ends of the floor.\n\n5\n\nTerry Rozier\n\nHornets Seasons: 2019-2022\n\nArriving in Charlotte in 2019 via a sign-and-trade deal, Terry Rozier brought a new level of toughness and grit to the Hornets' backcourt. Known for his tenacious defense and fearless scoring ability, Rozier quickly became a fan favorite and integral part of the team's success. While he has yet to garner significant individual accolades during his time in Charlotte, his hard-nosed style of play and clutch shooting have endeared him to Hornets fans and teammates alike.\n\nBirthplace : New York City, USA, New York\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nHornets Seasons: 1996\n\nJoining the Hornets in 1996 via a mid-season trade, Kenny Anderson brought his smooth playmaking and scoring abilities to the team. Adept at driving to the rim and finding open teammates, Anderson's unselfish style of play was a breath of fresh air for the Hornets' offense. While his time in Charlotte was relatively short, his impact was felt on the court as he helped elevate the team's overall level of play."
