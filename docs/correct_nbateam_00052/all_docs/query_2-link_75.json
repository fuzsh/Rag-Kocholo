        "text": "(Click here if you are having trouble viewing the gallery and video on your mobile device.)\n\nOAKLAND – At times, the Warriors’ talent and depth create a beautiful display of basketball. At times, the Warriors’ complacency delays their process in painting that picture.\n\nUsually at some point, though, the Warriors finally revert to good habits, break the game open and then call it a night. That moment never happened, however, in the Warriors’ 111-100 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Friday at Oracle Arena. While the Warriors (28-8) are not expected to win every single game, they were not expected to lose to a Hornets team (13-22) that has the NBA’s second-worst road record (3-13).\n\n“They totally outplayed us,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “They came in with great focus and they made us pay.”\n\nSo much for the Warriors’ ability to absorb Stephen Curry’s absence for the 11th consecutive game, while he puts the finishing touches on healing a sprained right ankle. Instead of touting their depth, the Warriors welcomed Curry’s expected return on Saturday against the Memphis Grizzlies at Oracle Arena.\n\n“Very excited man. He’s our leader and our point guard,” Warriors forward Kevin Durant said. “He runs the show out there. We’ve been missing him.”\n\nThough the Warriors still went 9-2 during Curry’s absence, the Warriors missed him the most in their likely final game without him.\n\nDurant produced 27 points albeit on 8-of-19 shooting. Klay Thompson stayed steady with 24 points on a 10-of-20 clip. While struggling with his shot (4-of-11), Warriors forward Draymond Green tied for a career-high 16 assists, while adding eight points and 11 rebounds. The Warriors’ season-long problems with turnovers (18) and fouls (24) became too much. Afterwards, Kerr described such turnover gaffes as “careless,” silly and pointless” before Durant lamented the team could have had 18 extra shot attempts.\n\n“We get in trouble sometimes,” said Warriors guard Shaun Livingston, who had 12 points on 5-of-7 shooting. “Coach stays on us about trying to keep it simple. But simple’s boring. That’s really where we get in trouble.”\n\nUsually in the third quarter, though, the Warriors cause trouble for other teams.\n\nInstead, the Warriors shot 9-of-24 from the field (37.5%) and 2-of-7 from 3-point range (28.6%). Meanwhile, the Hornets (13-22) featured six players cracking double figures.\n\n“We’re not going to do that every third quarter. Tonight we just didn’t bring it,” Kerr said. “We didn’t bring the juice. The key was the first half in not taking advantage of our opportunities.”\n\nThe Warriors usually create those opportunities with a dominant defense that had led the NBA in December in various defensive categories?\n\nInstead, the Warriors allowed Dwight Howard to appear like an All-Star again (29 points, 12 rebounds), while conceding 46 points in the paint. Whether the Warriors went big (Zaza Pachulia) or small (Jordan Bell), they still fell short. As Durant lamented about Howard, “we doubled him too much,” as Howard finished with spin moves along the baseline, a reverse layup, mid-range jumpers and even a bank shot.\n\n“Honestly, it was the first time I saw him hitting his shots outside,” Pachulia said. “I’ve never seen it before.”\n\nRarely, had the Warriors seen themselves play this poorly. They had gone 9-2 without Curry in the lineup. In the Warriors’ 101-87 win on Dec. 6 in Charlotte, the Warriors forced the Hornets to a 34-of-97 from the field (35.1 percent), limiting their free-throw attempts (17) and held them in transition (seven fast-break points). And the Warriors entered Friday’s game leading the NBA in December in assists (30.4 per game), defensive field-goal percentage (41.4 percent) and blocks (8.7).\n\nOn Friday, though?\n\n“They hit shots. We didn’t,” Livingston said. “We didn’t get the stops. It started with our defense and turnovers. Bad recipe all way around.”\n\nAs Durant summed up, “the best thing about this game is we have a game tomorrow” for obvious reasons.\n\n“When Steph comes back, it’s never a perfect time,” Pachulia said. “He’s always needed.”\n\nAnd after weathering Friday’s embarrassment to Charlotte, the Warriors seem so over trying to compensate for their star player’s absence.\n\n“That gives us all life,” Livingston said. “Him being back brings some excitement and switches things up.”"
