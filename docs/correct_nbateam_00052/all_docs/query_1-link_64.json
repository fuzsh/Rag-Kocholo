        "text": "Author\n\nPeople Don’t Talk Enough About How Awful The Hornets Are\n\nAt this point, we are well aware of how incompetent the Hornets franchise has been and this off-season looks like it may be the proverbial cherry on top. With that being said, a guy on reddit who goes by the username of u/rmarti78 may have somehow single-handily complied the most tremendous list of their screwups. 99% of this list was made by him with only 1 or 2 minor edits from us. Oh, and yes…he gave us permission to post it. So without further ado, find yourself a quiet space where no one can see you cry and read away.\n\nOne of only 6 teams in the NBA/NFL/MLB/NHL that’s never even made a conference finals. They’re the second oldest of those 6 teams behind the Clippers.\n\nThey’ve only drafted 4 All-Stars that went on to play for them despite being around since 1988: Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Baron Davis, and Kemba Walker. And they’ve had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.\n\nThen-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.\n\nThe Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.\n\nThe Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach’s doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.\n\nAfter having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton. They also reportedly turned down a trade for James Harden for that #2 overall pick.\n\nThey did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.\n\nThe second best draft pick they’ve had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.\n\nThey haven’t won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they’ve come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.\n\nDespite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they’re hard-capped at the moment. They’ll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He’ll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.\n\nMichael Jordan hasn’t given an interview where he’s discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.\n\nSo as you bitch and complain about how your team hasn’t done anything in a long time or how you only have one All-Star and you’re disappointed you didn’t get another, remember that things could always be worse.\n\nCharlotte’s Stockholm Syndrome\n\nStockholm syndrome is a condition which causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity.￼ These alliances result from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time together, but they are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims.\n\nLocal media, national media, everyone is literally telling us how bad the Hornets have done these past couple of years and more specifically these last couple of months. We know this. They have told us we have every right to be pissed. We also know this.\n\nThey may have arrived late to the party on discussing it but well, let’s be honest, we aren’t exactly relevant… until we screw up.\n\nWe lost Kemba. But it’s not just that. We lost him because we seemingly didn’t have a plan. we lowballed the offer. In December you should’ve known the ballpark of what Kemba wanted and if you knew it was too high THEN YOU SHOULD’VE TRADED HIM. You knew he’d reject that number… So why didn’t you trade him? The all-star game? That’s the rumor and if that’s the case, you are stupid. Beyond stupid. One of the stupidest to ever operate a professional sports team. Did you think he’d take the 160? If so then you didn’t know your team and couldn’t even figure out the wants and needs of the best player you’ve had in 20 years who works under your roof. If that’s the case, you’re ignorant. There’s only two possibilities here. You are either ignorant or stupid…\n\nThen you over pay a guy when most of the fanbase just assumes our strategy was to suck for a couple years and get the young guys some burn. He’s a solid player but it just comes across as not knowing whether or not you want to shit or get off the pot\n\nit doesn’t help that when Mitch speaks on the topic he can’t even properly get a message across that explains his reasoning for not trading Kemba or claiming that Rozier is a “lottery pick”… whatever that means. He says things like “I’m not sure we could’ve done better a year ago” when discussing the Kemba situation. Leaving fans speculating that he didn’t try. We won’t even dive into the other quotes of him defending himself from criticism over the signing that left fans scratching their heads more than trying to figure out where the airports were during the revolutionary war.\n\nAnd yes where the hell is MJ? We just lost our best player of all-time and he is nowhere to be seen. Wasn’t in Charlotte when Kemba cleared his locker, wasn’t even in the US when conversations were going on and sends us a message likely typed by his assistant that literally said nothing……….nothing actually would’ve been better.\n\nThis isn’t an article about why MJ is one of the worst owners in the league. This isn’t about how he is the constant between bad management moves from Cho to Mitch and before them. Because there really isn’t an argument that he is a good owner. We can discuss Frank to Vonleh to Dwight to this Kemba situation etc. why he’s bad and if your argument is that “we have a team” (we got two teams before he came on the scene) for him being a good owner then that’s pretty sad. I mean all he did was green light the rebrand that fans forced down his throat and took the organization kicking and screaming to the purple and teal finish line.\n\nThis is more of a discussion that FANS DESERVE TO BE ANGRY.\n\nHere’s what leads me to the meat of all this.\n\nWhile a lot of fans are expressing their anger there are still fans defending this organizations every move. No matter how dumb it looks and no matter how many mistakes we’ve watched there are those that dismiss the litany of faults as whining and complaining.\n\nDespite losing your best player of all-time, despite being the only team in the east to have never made the Finals, despite being one of 3 teams to never make conference finals, despite not making it past the second round, despite it taking 14 seasons to win a playoff game we should just be happy we have a team…\n\nThey defended Batum for years, ignored the writing on the wall and called him a “glue guy”. They defended Kaminsky’s play and dedication to Charlotte until Kaminsky left the damn building.\n\nThey wipe Jordan of any guilt because the team makes money and they say there is no proof even though every credible source in the NBA from Woj to Lowe source him as being a major root of the disfunction. if you remember, the fans handed him the olive branch of the rebrand and gave his team a second chance.\n\nThey dismiss all listing of problems and the overwhelming issues as people complaining and I’m here to say that the fans owe this team no benefit of the doubt until they have proven and earned the fans trust. Until they compete this fanbase has every right to second guess and scrutinize every decision because if you are keeping count at home they are wrong WAYYYYY more often than they are right.\n\nWe watched what this organization did the last time the fans were apathetic and didn’t hold them accountable and I’m guessing many of these people weren’t fans yet so they don’t understand the value of holding the team’s feet to the fire.\n\nFor some reason they view fans being critical as them being disloyal and I’m here to tell you that I’d rather have a fanbase passionate enough and that care enough to complain than one that suffers from Stockholm Syndrome of this organizations tactics and sympathizes with “how hard it is to manage a team” and rationalizes this mediocrity with a “let’s just wait to see” how it plays out this time so we can discuss another bad decision in hindsight.\n\nI want that building to be afraid of how fans will react. Not a building that measures their success on whether or not Jordan makes his money.\n\nFan Writes Letter to Hornets on Why He’s Cancelling His Season Tickets\n\nWe were just CC’d in an email a LONG TIME Hornets season ticket holder just sent the team.\n\nWe believe it’s imperative that local and national media take a good long hard look at this email when forming their narrative of the Hornets fanbase.\n\nDear #%^*{\n\nI hope things are going well for you guys and you’ve had some time to enjoy your summer.\n\nI know you read my previous email but I wanted to just get a few things off my chest, knowing that a couple of these emails may circulate themselves through the ranks of Managers and potentially beyond. I hope it is seen, I certainly don’t need a reply about how “Kemba Walker…blah blah blah” it’s not about that.\n\nBasketball is business, player moves are business, and it’s not all about who fans like or gravitate towards when player personnel moves are made. The Kemba Walker decision is the same, and I don’t agree with our approach, I’ve disagreed before knowing the previously stated but I get it. Just like my job, we like players that we pass on, we don’t spend money on certain guys that we probably should and they walk away and you must be confident in doing better with the next guy.That’s exactly where I’m at with this team, I’m ready to walk. Ready to walk away from season tickets, for the first time in my life. I’m paying $4,000 a year for what has been losing basketball since my seats increased by 20% in 2016. They went up $800 in a single off season.Since then, they’ve not made the playoffs and not been above .500 and won on average 20 games per year at the Hive.\n\nSince 1988, my father and I have had season tickets, the older I got the more of paying stake I’ve had in it. I currently live in the Triad, and my father in the mountains. We both drove from mountains to Charlotte from 1988-2001. Since the Hornets returned in 2014 we both drove from our homes in the Triad/Mountains, 150 round trip for us both. The truth is, when I look at the numbers below, it’s not worth it. I don’t feel appreciated at all by the team after my tickets were raised 20% in 2016. Why should I continue this? What hope should I have with this team? Because you gave me a starter jacket, $20 worth of buzz bucks(that didn’t cover a large popcorn & drink), and named a 30th Anniversary Team of Players that are more synonymous with other teams and have their jerseys hanging in their arenas already… Why should I do this:\n\n· My father and/or I have driven 86,250 miles to Hornets games, which would be nearly $50,000 of vehicle depreciation at $.55 a mile.\n\n· We’ve paid $5,750 in parking alone over the years.\n\n· I’ll lose by $2,000 already paid for next season. I know you’ll love keeping that and then charging the next poor bastard $6,000 for my $4,000 seats that are probably only worth $3,000.\n\n· I spend twice as much in the fan shop than my wife thinks I already do. Every time a friend has a baby, the baby gets a Hornets onesie… they still will.\n\n· I spent $1000 to watch the All-Star game. NOTHING to say thank you. Because you didn’t feel like you needed to, that’s because you knew someone would buy it.\n\n· We’ve not even spoke about the ticket costs… that’s another $50,000.\n\nWe could go on and on and on about these numbers. The love I have for the team trumps it all, it was all worth it. I have pictures as a 3-year-old in a Rex Chapman Jersey, employees at the old coliseum would give me Christmas cards and I would return. Own George Shinn once handed me a Christmas Card with a $100 bill in it when I was 10 years old. I’ll never forget the playoff game vs Boston; I’ll never forget sweeping Miami. But this has become a business decision for me.I spend nearly $100 every time I come to a game in Charlotte on top of $90 worth of tickets that I cannot sell on the secondary market for what is the required ticket price on Ticketmaster’s site. It happened most of this year.I’m taking the gamble and I’m going to assume I can sit CLOSER for LESS over the next 2-3 seasons using the secondary market, like others have done to me for the past 2-3 years.\n\nI already know Charlotte is “One of the Best 5 Bargains in the NBA”. Well it should be, we have a bottom 5 team and no longer have an all-star that makes the product worth it paying for on a nightly basis. Charlotte is growing and I’m sure business for you guys will still boom. Plenty of socialites will want somewhere to bring their tinder dates.The growth of the city is hiding the truth from the team and driving a stake between the true fans. The ones that wear their jerseys and hats, not the ones that come in mid-way through the second quarter and leave when they feel they can beat traffic.\n\nI’ll always be a Hornets fan. The players are completely separate from this. I’m as loyal as I was when they broke my heart and moved to New Orleans. Standing by the tunnel as Jason Kidd & the next beat us. Waiting in the parking lot watching the last of the players leave, seeing David Wesley’s escalade pulling out onto Tyvola. You see when the team moved, and returned as the Hornets in 2014 it was just a band aid to save the NBA’s worst franchise. That’s not your fault now but it’s still your problem to figure out. The name change was incredible; but no longer enough. I’m nostalgic, not stupid. I’m doing this while a family friend was drafted by you guys!\n\nI’ll buy tickets to 8-12 games, probably only 8 for the next few years but I’ll be there for the Celtics game because Kemba Walker deserves my money. He deserves my time and deserves to know how much he should feel appreciated. I know how he feels because you’ve made me feel the same way.\n\nYou see, the Hornets don’t appreciate me and they haven’t for a while. They know they can get some other guy, and he’ll pay more than I did. You’ll come out “on top” and have another plastic fan with a tinder date in my spot. To come to think of it… I feel like Kemba.\n\n44 Pictures That I Feel Best Sum Up Charlotte’s NBA Story\n\nKemba Walker becomes 3 time all-star as Charlotte hosts the 2019 NBA-All-Star week\n\nKeep Kemba\n\nSo these tweets came out today and the Hornets social media world flipped the F$&@ out\n\nAll this means is that Kemba can be offered more money by the Hornets and was eligible for the super max. In reality this makes it easier for the Hornets to come up with an attractive deal for Kemba that nobody can match because of bird rights. Basically we can offer him wayyyyyy more money than other teams\n\nIn my opinion OF COURSE you offer the max to Kemba but the big question is IF you have the money.\n\nThe hardest part about this is making the moves to have that money for Kemba not the convincing Kemba to stay part.\n\nI’m not really that worried about Kemba wanting to stay as long as we have the money and at least make it seem we are at least attempting to win now.\n\nI’m gonna keep it real with you. If you ask me would I rather see Kemba leave and win a title or would I rather see him stay and win a series… you’re damn right I’m picking watching him as a Hornet win even just a series. #Sports #Fan\n\nAt the end of the day I’m a Hornets fan. He can make more money here than anywhere else and he’d rather win here more than anywhere else. Show him the money and show him a plan.\n\nYou can win with Kemba and eventually you’re gonna have to pay someone if you want to compete. Especially in this market. This isn’t a Kemba problem as much as we have never put anything around him. So pay him if you’re ready to actually put talent around him and compete.\n\nIt’s only a waste if you give him no help. We could have any superstar in the league and it would be “a lot of money to spend to get the 12th pick” if you never put someone there to assist them.\n\nSo it’s not a question of if he’s worth it. Its if we do something to help him.\n\nNow you have many people saying “set him free?”… why would i want to do that? We’ve had 2 teams in the finals for damn near the past 5 years, he’s more likely to have team built around him here then he is to make it to a finals somewhere else. I love him but i can’t really see you being that big of a fan if you’re saying “set him free”\n\nAll y’all asking for Kemba to leave for some noble reasoning gonna be sitting next to us at games for the next 5 years as we suck?\n\nCus it’s pretty easy to say he should leave when you won’t actually be the ones suffering through it and you can just tune back in the next time we get an All-Star or make the playoffs.\n\nThe future will be rough either way. I’d just much rather watch it with Kemba in a Hornets Jersey. The greatest Hornet of all time.\n\nDid You Know: Why the Hornets Gave Robert Parish a Grandfather Clock\n\nAfter 20 years in the league, at the age of 42 “the Chief” (given the nickname by former Boston teammate Cedric Maxwell, who said Parish reminded him of Chief Bromden in the movie, “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest.”) Robert Parish was gifted a grandfather clock from the Hornets organization At halftime after breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA record for career games played after taking the court against the Bulls for his 1,560th game! He had stood the test time.\n\nThe Chief was brought in to assist Mourning in his development but Mourning was later traded. The Chief was in Charlotte from 1994-6. Even though it was short-lived he is beloved by Hornets fans to this day.\n\nHornets Fans Have Outperformed the Team for Decades.\n\nLet’s be honest. This franchise has done nothing for what looks like it’s going to be 15 seasons now. We’ve had 7 coaches in the past 10 years. The fan base threw them a raft with the rebrand begging them to show life and things are beginning to feel all too familiar again. The rebrand was never meant to be the “fix”. It was meant to be a second chance to get things right. This may be shocking to some of you but this stint has been around for just about the same amount of time as the original Charlotte Hornets franchise.\n\nNow I’m a visual guy so let’s take a look at the progress reports lined up.\n\nOriginal Hornets Take 2\n\n1988-89 20-62 2004-05 18-64 1989-90 19-63 2005-06 26-56 1990-91 26-56 2006-07 33-49 1991-92 31-51 2007-08 32-50 1992-93 44-38 E.

Semis 2017-18 36-46\n\nAround the 6th season the Original Hornets had established themselves, besides the 1998-99 lockout season, as a consistent mid-40 win team that you could occasionally expect to break 50 on a good year. Consistent isn’t even a word I like using in the same sentence as the “Take 2”.\n\nNow I know it’s not exactly fair to compare the 2 of them but it is more or less showing what can be done in 14 seasons and what we have done in 14 seasons.\n\nThis is the result, in our humble opinion, of complacency. As a fan base we’ve knocked the hornets nest before and forced, what felt like kicking and screaming, this organization into giving back our name. We deserve better. We should demand better. We have done our part to support this organization even when they didn’t exactly earn it and we have very little to show for it in return.\n\nThe question is what do we believe as fans we should do to make this change happen?\n\nHAVE YOU NOTICED YET THAT I JUST COPIED AND PASTED AN ARTICLE WE WROTE FROM TWO YEARS AGO AND IT STILL APPLIES?\n\nAll I did was add some numbers and we are in the exact same position.\n\nA couple days ago a local radio personality commented on how he was disappointed that the Hornets attendance was 23rd. I replied that with another season quickly fading away and having statistically one of the hardest remaining schedules in the league this fanbase has been outperforming this team for the ENTIRE SECOND STINT. Is this team a top 23 product in the NBA? Has it done anything to give the fans hope for in the past 15 years? We have won 3 playoff games since 2002. We are on the edge of losing the best Hornet of all-time with nothing to show for it. We are on the edge of being on a 3 to 5-year rebuild process while technically we haven’t even finished the last “rebuild”.\n\nWhat exactly do you want from a fanbase? I am as diehard as they come BUT even I realize that in any market with any team there is no fanbase that is going to just keep caring. This fanbase isn’t even asking for much. They would be happy with a playoff appearance and little bit of drama every couple of years but we can’t even provide that.\n\nEventually, the price of season tickets, which have inexplicably risen, won’t be rational to a seasoned fan who has seen the same outcome year in and year out. And can you really blame them?\n\nCharlotteans Aren’t Taking the All-Star Game Seriously and It’s Gonna Bite Them in The Ass\n\nAs I’m scrolling through Facebook I see an article on the Charlotte Observer, admittedly I didn’t open it because I loathe the bombardment of ads that ensues when you visit their page. The article title was “NBA All-Star Weekend once shut down Las Vegas. Charlotte, you’ve been warned”… I’m like okay this is exactly what we talked about on our podcast. I (Evan) asked Scotty if he had heard anybody outside of the sports or entertainment circles we roam in discussing the All-Star game with it being only 2 weeks away? We both answered “No”. And we discussed why that made us nervous.\n\nI opened the article comments to take a look at what my fellow Charlotteans are saying on the topic and all I see are a bunch of Brads and Karens scoffing at the notion that we may be “shut down”. I see one Brad say “Charlotte isn’t a destination like Vegas, we won’t get 10’s of thousands of people.” with a host of other people echoing this sentiment.\n\nI just have one question to ask you…. ARE Y’ALL STUPID?!?! Just because you are not an NBA fan does not mean there aren’t millions of them across the globe and this is the event where they all come to celebrate their favorite sport. This isn’t a little event where Charlotteans are the ones who attend. This party isn’t being thrown for us.\n\nAlmost every venue in uptown and south end has been booked for months for this one week… and not by people from Charlotte. Y’all hoping to just wander inside uptown and just enjoy the atmosphere are in for a rude awakening.\n\nYa’ll bitch and moan about CIAA and how it’s soooooooo inconvenient but that’s a $50 million event…The All-Star week is projected to bring in over $100 Million in local impact.\n\nThe city infrastructure just isn’t ready. We as a city haven’t even finished the 1-77 South ramp from 277. This is the same city who didn’t have a plan for a parade or on how to handle the crowds if the Panthers won the Super Bowl in 2015. Just to give you an idea, over 100,000 people attended the All-Star game in 2010… And that was only one event.\n\nI’m just saying if you aren’t taking this seriously and aren’t preparing for what is to come then I don’t want to see you complaining about it in 2 weeks. This is the time for Charlotte to step up and show off our lovely city and I don’t think enough of you are talking about what is coming to our small southern town. You think your 30 minute commute to work is rough?\n\nHornets Ticket Prices On Secondary Market Up 16% For 2018-19 Season\n\nCharlotte made wholesale changes — both in coaching and on the court — during the offseason, and fans were clearly ready. The Hornets replaced Steve Clifford with James Borrego at the top and Kemba Walker now has Tony Parker and No. 34 overall draft pick Devonte’ Graham, among others, to help out.\n\nAll those changes have resulted in an increase in demand for Hornets tickets. The $89 average asking price on the secondary market is ranked No. 29 across the NBA, but marks a nearly 16% increase in prices over last season. It is the second cheapest average asking price since secondary ticket marketplace TicketIQ.com began tracking data in 2011, presenting fans with the opportunity to see great basketball at a reasonable price.\n\nThe Hornets are celebrating 30 years in Charlotte and will wear throwback white pinstriped uniforms to commemorate the anniversary.\n\nSeason tickets, referred to as Swarm365, are available through the team website. Season ticket holders have access to myriad benefits, including a special entry gate at games, invitations to exclusive events with players and coaches, and season-ticket holders’ only concession lines.\n\nSingle-game tickets are available on the primary market through Ticketmaster, and are available for all games, including the the December 15 Los Angeles Lakers game. The priciest game of the season, fans are driving up demand for a chance to see LeBron James in a Lakers uniform, but the $79 get-in price on the primary market is among the cheapest to see the Lakers across the NBA.\n\nAt $273.60, the average asking price for the Lakers game on the secondary market is more than $40 more expensive than the next highest average asking price. The No. 2-priced game is the February 25 Golden State Warriors game, which checks in at $232.83. The Warriors are the defending NBA champions and are commanding high prices across the league, as well as the No. 1 price for home games.\n\nThe next three most expensive games are $205.20 for the March 23 Boston Celtics games, $137.39 for the February 27 Houston Rockets game, and $136.84 for the November 19 Celtics game.\n\nTicketIQ.com has tickets available for all of the top games, including great seats at both Celtics games. Seats behind the basket in 100 Level, Section 110, Row A are available for $299 for for the March 23 Celtics game. For the November 19 Celtics game, fans can treat themselves to seats close to the action at mid-court between the team benches for $240 in 100 Level, Section 105, Row Q. Both sets of tickets come with TicketIQ.com‘s Low Price Guarantee."
