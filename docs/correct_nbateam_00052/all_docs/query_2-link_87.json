        "text": "We’re going to take a slightly different path with today’s You Tube Gold and look at a video by Dr. Brian Sutterer explaining the devastating injury Shaun Livingston suffered in 2007 and why his leg was nearly amputated.\n\nThere’s a look at the injury in here as you might expect so be forewarned. We probably wouldn’t let kids watch it. Legs aren’t supposed to do stuff like that.\n\nOne thing we didn’t realize: the trainers who worked on him immediately after the injury almost certainly saved his leg and therefore his career."
