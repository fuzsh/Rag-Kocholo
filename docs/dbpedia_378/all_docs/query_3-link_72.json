        "text": "Hó has a number of meanings, and one that can be a little confusing–especially for Mandarin Chinese speakers–is “have to; should“:\n\nGóa hó lâi-khì ah.\n\nI should be going.\n\nGóa hó khí tha̍k8 chu ah.\n\nI need to go study.\n\nLí hó khì sé sin-khu ah.\n\nYou need to go take a bath.\n\nIn the second frame, the father says:\n\nChiūⁿ-kiā ū-kàu thiám-thâu… (Going uphill is really tiring)\n\nThis sounds a little strange to me (and most people I’ve asked). It’s much more common to hear peh for “go up” instead of chiūⁿ, as in peh soaⁿ (go up/climb the mountain) or peh kiā /peh khiā (go uphill).\n\nChiūⁿ, on the other hand, turns up more in expressions like “get on the bus/get in the car” (chiūⁿ chhia) or “get up on stage” (chiūⁿ-tâi).\n\nFor speakers of Mandarin Chinese, lâi-khì can be confusing. Despite its literal meaning of “come-go”, it means “to go”, but it can only be used in the first person (single or plural) future tense. For example:\n\nSî-kan í-keng bô chá ah, lán tio̍h8 lâi-khì ah.\n\nIt’s getting late, (so) we should be going.\n\nGóa bîn-á-chài beh lâi-khì Thài-kok.\n\nI’m going to go to Thailand tomorrow.\n\nBut you can’t say:\n\n*I bîn-á-chài beh lâi-khì Thài-kok.\n\nShe’s going to go to Thailand tomorrow.\n\nor\n\n*Góa téng-lé-pài lâi khì Thài-kok.\n\nI went to Thailand last week.\n\nAlso, note that the opposite of lâi-khì is bô beh khì :\n\nGóa bîn-á-chài bô beh khì Thài-kok.\n\nI’m not going to Thailand tomorrow."
