        "text": "Appendix A3\n\nTaiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute: A Cradle of Future Industries\n\nTaiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) is a not-for-profit research organization established in 1973 to provide applied industrial research for Taiwanese industry. ITRI draws upon research conducted all over the world in companies, research organizations and universities and uses the knowledge to develop product prototypes and the processes, equipment and materials necessary to manufacture those prototypes. It fosters not only the creation of companies that make new products, but of entire industry chains supporting the manufacturing process, including design, materials, equipment, testing, packaging, quality control and applications. ITRI “has played an integral role in transforming Taiwan’s economy from a low-tech, labor-intensive model to a high-tech, knowledge-based industrial core.”1 ITRI’s formation was the most important aspect of a broad national effort to develop Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, a spectacular success which has subsequently driven the growth of Taiwan’s capabilities in computers, lighting, displays, telecommunications, photovoltaics, and machinery.\n\nITRI is located in one of the most successful technology “clusters” in the world, grouped in and around Hsinchu Science Park (HSP), a research and high technology industrial zone established by the government in 1980.2 In addition to ITRI, two world class research universities, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) and National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) adjoin the park, which is the site of research and manufacturing operations of over 400 high technology companies. Most points within this complex are within\n\n________________\n\nwalking distance of each other, a proximity which fosters personal interchange and cross-pollination of ideas. NCTU, NTHU and ITRI train large numbers of workers for the industries in HSP; company executives and ITRI officials teach in the two universities; and university professors turn to ITRI for assistance in developing practical applications of new ideas and sit on advisory boards of local companies. ITRI “has been praised as the incubator of Taiwan’s chief executive officers of publicly held companies and talents for industries,” and the same could be said of NCTU and NTHU. 3 The companies located in HSP account for about 15 percent of Taiwan’s GDP, making the park one of the most productive pieces of real estate on earth.4\n\nThe creation of ITRI, perhaps the most important milestone in the entire course of Taiwan’s industrialization, was the brainchild of an elite group of highly competent bureaucrats and business leaders, most of them holding degrees in engineering.5 They frequently had extensive experience working for multinational high technology companies and were in a position to apply their practical experience to the development of indigenous companies and industries.6 They were relatively unhindered by political pressure—the Kuomintang Party (KPT), which held a monopoly on political power until 1990, had a tradition of relying on “scientific” government planning when it arrived on Taiwan in 1949, and technocrats “had already won a large measure of independence from party and military control.”7 This pattern was maintained\n\n________________\n\nduring the decades of KMT rule but is eroding with the advent of democracy and challenges to KMT policies by the Democratic People’s Party (DPP).8\n\nITRI has deep American roots. Its founder, Y.S. Sun, formulated a developmental strategy for high tech industry in Taiwan based on discussions in the early 1970s with a colleague, Dr. Pan Wen-Yuan, an electrical engineer then employed in RCA’s David Sarnoff Laboratories in New Jersey. The two men determined that Taiwan should develop a semiconductor industry, that acquisition of U.S. technology would be required, and that Chinese engineers working in U.S. technology companies would be an important asset for such an effort.9 RCA trained the first cadre of ITRI engineers in semiconductor manufacturing technology, a number of whom were U.S. residents holding Ph.Ds. from U.S. universities. The Taiwanese development effort was advised by a “Science and Technology Advisory Group” (STAG), established in 1979, led by U.S. semiconductor executives, including Pat Haggerty, former CEO of Texas Instruments and former member of the National Academy of Sciences, and B.O. Evans, former VP for development at IBM.10 Hsinchu Science Park represented a deliberate effort by Kuo-Ting Li, a Taiwanese leader known to posterity as the “architect of Taiwan’s economic miracle,” to replicate the best features of California’s Silicon Valley in Taiwan. 11 HSP’s first director was an American, Dr. Choh Li, formerly a research director at Honeywell in\n\n________________\n\nMinneapolis.12 Morris Chang, perhaps the most famous person to head ITRI and the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), holds two degrees from MIT, a doctorate from Stanford and served for over 20 years with Texas Instruments, including time as the company’s CEO. At present, four decades after its creation, a large proportion of ITRI’s total work force still holds bachelors and advanced degrees from leading U.S. universities.\n\nTHE TECHNOLOGY INTERMEDIARY\n\nAn industry analyst quoted in The Economist observed in 2010 that Taiwan was “the best place in the world to turn ideas into physical form.”13 That fact is substantially attributable to ITRI, which functions as the bridge between ideas and form, or as its managers express it, as a “technology intermediary” serving Taiwanese industry. Its primary function is not research but adaptation and transfer of technology from domestic and overseas laboratories to domestic companies. ITRI is “arguably the most capable institution of its kind in the world in scanning the global technological horizon for developments of interest in Taiwanese industry, and executing the steps required to import the technology—either under license or joint development— and then absorbing and adopting the technology for Taiwanese firms to use …”14 Technology is transferred to Taiwanese industry through a variety of channels, including licensing, patent auctions, co-development arrangements, spinoffs, migration of ITRI personnel to companies, and research consortia and alliances.\n\nStrategic Direction\n\nAlthough Taiwan’s National Science Council (NSC) is formally responsible for formulating the country’s science and technology policy, and ITRI is subordinated to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, strategic direction has determined through a consultation process involving foreign experts and ethnic Chinese with relevant experience in multinational companies:\n\n“a distinctive feature of Taiwan’s technology policy making is the extensive participation of overseas technologists, mostly of ethnic Chinese origins, as advisers. Enjoying a varying level of access to the top policy circle, they help policymakers identify the industrial sectors with technological promise,\n\n________________\n\nbiotechnology.17 STAG prepares developmental technology blueprints for specific industry sectors regarded as important.18 The Technical Review Board (TRB) of the National Science Council consists of foreign and domestic experts who concentrate on targeting particular technologies and adapting them at the operational and project level. A number of key Taiwanese experts have served in more than one capacity in such organizations.19 This multifaceted and cosmopolitan advisory system has been widely praised, but has fostered failures as well as successes.20\n\nDing-Yuan Yang, a former ITRI official who founded Winbond Electronics Corporation in 1987, explained in a 2011 oral history interview that the founder of ITRI, MOEA Minister Y.S. Sun, would use the conferences with experts to absorb opinions on the development of technology. MOEA would then draft formal minutes of the conferences, “and then the plans would start.” MOEA would give “suggestions” to ITRI for execution. ITRI would respond by proposing contracts with the Ministry, sign the contracts, and begin to execute them. “These kinds of national projects were all four-year contracts, which allowed it to have a certain continuity.”21\n\nOrganization\n\nITRI was formed through the combination of three existing research centers subordinated to MOEA which were relocated to a new site in Hsinchu in 1973.22 At its inception ITRI consisted of 400 employees and was funded by a\n\n________________\n\nITRI’s budget is currently about $600 million per year, half of which is provided by the government and half by the private sector. 24\n\nITRI employs 5,728 personnel, of which 1,163 hold Ph.Ds. and 3,152 masters’ degrees. ITRI’s staffing of research projects is “very bare bones,” even in technology areas regarded has having breakthrough potential.25\n\nTechnology Acquisition\n\nIn ITRI’s early years it relied almost entirely on the acquisition of technology and know-how from foreign high technology companies, which it disseminated to Taiwanese industry. In recent decades the research capabilities of Taiwan’s universities, including the Hsinchu-based National Tsing Hua and National Chiao Tung Universities, have emerged as increasingly important sources of technology. As ITRI’s reputation as an R&D powerhouse has grown, it has become possible for the institute to enter into joint R&D projects with first-tier foreign companies and research organizations. 26 Technology obtained via such collaborations remains a vital aspect of ITRI’s operations.\n\n________________\n\nyears or more.28 Their competencies are concentrated in hardware-related fields, although ITRI is working to refocus on software, systems and services.29 The core laboratories develop and test prototype products, production equipment and materials, and experiment with new applications.\n\nElectronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories: ITRI’s Electronics and optoelectronics research laboratories focus on manufacturing technology in the fields of nano-electronics, micro-optical-mechanical electronics, optoelectronic 3D integrated circuit packaging, 3D image processing, flexible electronics, and advanced display technology. This laboratory is currently heavily involved in research involving flexible electronics.\n\nInformation and Communications Research Laboratory: ITRI’s Information and Communications Technologies Laboratory conducts research on core technologies for the development of IT-enabled services (ITES). This laboratory coordinates with other national projects involving system-on-chip, e-learning and telecommunications.\n\nGreen Energy and Environmental Research Laboratory: ITRI’s Green Energy and Environmental Research Laboratory conducts research in the areas of energy efficiency, clean environment, renewable and alternative energy, natural resources, and energy management and policy.30\n\nMaterial, Chemical and Nanotechnology Research Laboratory: ITRI’s Material, Chemical and Nanotechnology Laboratory collaborates with Taiwanese companies to develop materials and components for application in the fields of electronics, green energy, optoelectronics, and panel display. In addition, it develops high-tech\n\n________________\n\nall in Taiwan. So, we can even complete the design in Taipei. And, why? Because all the vendors are concentrated in Taipei. Taipei is not big, so it’s easy to deal with everything in Taipei and everything can be done here. This is good, isn’t it?36\n\nTechnology Diffusion\n\nITRI’s technology is transferred to Taiwanese industry through numerous channels. ITRI research organizations participate in a large number of topical R&D alliances designed to ensure that the participating companies follow, monitor, and in some cases participate in ITRI research projects in a manner which enhances the prospect they can successfully absorb and apply new technologies. 37 ITRI licenses technology to domestic companies, frequently on more favorable terms than could be obtained from foreign sources.38 It performs contract R&D for companies.39 Since 2005 it has auctioned off blocks of intellectual property on an exclusive basis.40 ITRI’s OpenLab is an incubator for new companies which provides facilities, utilities, business services and research support to start-up companies—in 2005 OpenLab was honored as the “best incubator in Asia” by the Asian Association of Business Incubation.41 Among other services ITRI offers pilot production opportunities to companies prior to the commercialization of products, which enables companies to use ITRI’s pilot lines for process verification, product development and semi-commercial production. The newly-formed ITRI College provides customized training programs for Taiwanese companies, as well as government officials and researchers from developing countries in\n\n________________\n\ninnovation competencies and six technological areas.42 Finally, former ITRI employees taking positions in Taiwanese high tech companies bring extensive know-how and in some cases, technology which they are expected by their former employer to commercialize.\n\nSpin-offs\n\nITRI’s most dramatic method for technology diffusion is the spin-off of parts of itself to form new companies or to join existing companies (the latter being referred to as “spin-in”).43 ITRI spinoffs entail transfer of employees, technology and in some cases equipment to a new company, coupled with the provision of a wide range of incubation services (legal and business counseling, provision of office space and utilities at modest cost, and introductions to sources of financing and to potential customers). Since ITRI’s founding in 1973 it has formally spun off a total of 162 companies, and informally contributed to the launch of several hundred others. 44 As of early 2012, roughly two dozen spin-offs were under consideration with five in the incubation phase.\n\nPicking Winners\n\nITRI’s venture capital subsidiary, the Industrial Technology Investment Corporation (ITIC) plays a key role in facilitating ITRI spin-offs.45 When ITRI laboratories seek to spin off a promising technology ITIC screens the proposal, assessing whether the technology has commercial potential, and sizing up the business prospects for the new venture and the competition it is likely to encounter. ITIC works closely with ITRI’s Commercialization and Industry Service Center (CIS) in assessing whether a given proposal has commercial\n\n________________\n\nTABLE APP-A3-3 Examples of ITRI Spin-off and Spin-in Ventures\n\nYear Company Products 1999 Taiflex Scientific Electronic materials 1997 Prolific Technology ASIC designs 2005 Neo Precision Technology Co.

If the answer is affirmative, ITRI will provide funding and incubation services, and in some cases will recruit one or more outside experts with business experience to join the new venture.46\n\nITIC provides early stage financing to some ITRI spin-offs, usually in amounts under $US 1 million. ITIC takes an equity stake in new ventures which it normally expects to sell at some point in the future. ITIC’s decision on whether to provide financial/support to a given start-up is taken independently of ITRI and ITIC is not obligated to invest in any ITRI spin-off. As of early 2012, ITRI had 24 spin-offs under consideration, of which ITIC would typically approve funding for one third of the group and turn the others down. The success rate for ITRI spin-offs funded by ITIC is currently about 3 out of 10.\n\nIncubation\n\nThe ITRI OpenLab Incubation Center, near Hsinchu Science Park, provides temporary support for ITRI spin-off and startup companies. The Incubation Center features nearly 140,000 square feet of leasable space which can be used for offices, research space, or product assembly. Companies in the incubator receive management advice, technical consulting services, legal help, and access to ITRI’s research facilities and pilot production lines.\n\n________________\n\nK.S. Pua, an ITRI alumnus who with four other ITRI staffers co-founded the successful start-up Phison Electronics Corp., a maker of flash memory systems, recalled the importance of ITRI’s support in the early days of his company between 2000 and 2003.47 The new company was allotted space at ITRI’s Incubation Center, which “not only provided office space, but also facility management,” so that “we didn’t have to worry about the trash, water, power, or other sundry things.” The rent was “comparatively cheap.” ITRI loaned Phison laboratory equipment that the start-up could not have otherwise afforded. Its legal adviser assisted Phison in defending a lawsuit. The new company assembled its products “right in the office,” achieving a turnover of $36.7 million in 2002. The Incubation Center Director, C.J. Chang, advised Phison to apply for a grant from MOEA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and assisted the company in drawing up the application. ITRI helped Phison to recruit qualified employees, connected it with investors, and vouched for it in its pitches for funding. Phison had 12 employees when it entered the Incubation Center in August 2000 and 60 when it left in January 2003.48\n\nA key milestone in Phison’s history was the formation of a close relationship with Toshiba, which invested in Phison, provided a source of demand for its USB flash drives and assisted the company in securing patents and fending off legal challenges.49 Initially Toshiba had no idea who or what Phison consisted of, so ITRI made a presentation to Toshiba introducing the company. On the basis of the presentation and ITRI’s established high technology bona fides, Toshiba decided to invest in the company, becoming its largest shareholder.50\n\nTHE HSINCHU TECHNOLOGY CLUSTER\n\nITRI’s contribution to Taiwan’s industrial development has been substantially enhanced by its physical presence in a technology cluster in the Hsinchu area. Innovation or technology clusters are concentrations of knowledge-based companies pursuing research, development and production of advanced technology products in proximity to each other. The most successful clusters draw upon nearby universities for talent and research, and benefit from\n\n________________\n\nan array of supportive government policies, particularly the provision of research infrastructure. The most well-known innovation clusters in the United States are Silicon Valley, Research Triangle in North Carolina and Boston’s Route 128. Technology clusters are particularly important in “bringing the upstream, midstream and downstream aspects into one complete series of connections, which possess high speed communication exchange, technical support and other competitive advantages,” and in sectors with comparatively long industrial chains, such as semiconductors and photovoltaics, the cluster effect is particularly powerful.51\n\nTaiwan’s Hsinchu technology cluster has evolved into one of the most productive in the world. According to a recent estimate firms located inside HSP are 66 percent more productive than firms located outside.52 In 2010, 139,416 people were employed in HSP itself.53 At the end of 2010, HSP contained operations of 449 companies which generated over $40 billion in that year. The semiconductor industry was dominant in terms of percent of total revenue.54\n\nIn addition, many small technology companies are located just outside the HSP itself and contribute to the cluster effect. At present HSP receives around 1,000 visiting missions per year seeking to understand how such a technological-industrial complex can be established and managed.55\n\nThe Hsinchu technology cluster has been extensively studied by academics and by other countries and regions seeking to replicate its success. John A. Mathews, an Australian professor of competitive dynamics, has written\n\nTABLE APP-A3-4 Hinschu Park Revenues by Sector\n\nSector Percent of HSP Revenue Semiconductors 68.44 Optoelectronics 19.08 Computers 5.99 Telecommunications 3.28 Precision machinery 2.22 Biotechnology 0.42\n\n________________\n\nextensively about the Hsinchu phenomenon, concluding that “firms generate mutual advantages by clustering together,” and collectively form “powerful engines of wealth generation.” In Hsinchu, these advantages have been enhanced by the presence of ITRI and the two science-oriented universities— “companies attracted to the Hsinchu park have been able to count on the universities for supplies of skilled professional staff, while they have been stimulated by exposure to the technological innovations emanating from ITRI.”56\n\nThe basic elements of a successful cluster are sometimes referred to today as “Marshall’s trinity,” based on the pioneering nineteenth century work of the British economist Alfred Marshall in his study of the Sheffield industrial district of Britain.57 According to Marshall the trinity consists of three basic elements:\n\nSupplier linkages: Cluster-based firms foster economies with respect to transportation, communications, supply chain, infrastructure and logistics.\n\nLabor: Specialized activities within the cluster foster growth of a pool of skilled labor, permitting increased specialization by enterprises located in the cluster.\n\nKnowledge spillovers: As Marshall expressed it, in an industrial district the “secrets of trade are in the air,” and presence in the cluster enables firms to access market intelligence, new designs and new applications.58\n\nAll of these factors are present in abundance in the Hsinchu technology cluster and are critical elements in its success.\n\nSupplier Linkages\n\nHsinchu Science Park has greatly facilitated the development of Marshall’s “supplier linkages” by encouraging technology-intensive firms to locate in proximity with each other. Such arrangements reduce transportation costs with respect to materials and parts. 59\n\n________________\n\nAlthough companies in the supply chain cooperate, they also compete—any company that falls short of expectations can quickly be replaced by another. Competition continually drives down costs and forces companies to improve yields. Reflecting these dynamics, the HSP Administration has assembled data which reportedly demonstrates that firms within the park generate an average value-added (revenues minus costs as a percent of total revenues) of 50 percent, versus 30 percent for Taiwanese manufacturing enterprises located outside of the park—or a productivity edge of 60 percent.60\n\nHSP contains complete or nearly complete industry supply chains in a number of sectors, most notably semiconductors. The presence of materials, design, equipment, fabrication, and testing companies in the park is cited as a major locational and competitive advantage by semiconductor industry executives.61\n\nSkilled Labor\n\nThe second element of Marshall’s trinity, pool of skilled labor, is available to companies operating in HSP thanks in substantial part to the presence of two research universities adjacent to the park.62 National Chiao\n\nTABLE APP-A3-5 Hinschu Park Industry Supply Chain for Semiconductors\n\nSector Number of Companies in HSP Wafer fabrication 17 Fabless design 129 Equipment 17 Lead frame 3 Wafers 6 Test 3 Mask 5 EDA design tools 5\n\n________________\n\nTung University (NCTU) was established in Hsinchu in 1958 and adjoins Hsinchu Science Park. NCTU supplied much of ITRI’s original R&D staff as well as much of the engineering talent for HSP when the park was created.63 NCTU was the first university in Taiwan to operate a semiconductor research laboratory, and one of its professors, Simon Sze, is the author of The Physics of Semiconductor Devices, otherwise known globally as “the semiconductor Bible.”64 At present 65 percent of the CEOs, Presidents and General Managers of companies located in HSP are NCTU graduates.65 It compares its relationship with HSP to that of Stanford with Silicon Valley.66 The University has colleges of engineering, biological science, computer science, photonics, and electrical and computer engineering, and research centers specializing in nanotechnology, photonics, bioinformatics, biomedical electronics, intelligent information/communication, brain research and interdisciplinary science.67 Its students commonly work as interns in HSP and join companies in the park upon graduation. Many top ITRI managers also serve as NCTU faculty members.\n\nNational Tsing Hua University (NTHU), adjacent to NCTU, has produced two Nobel laureates in physics and one in chemistry. NTHU is regarded by some as the premier research university in Taiwan, holding the highest citation rate for papers published by faculty in either Taiwan or China. Nearly 50 percent of the university’s research budget is attributable to grants won by NTHU faculty.68 NTHU includes colleges of life sciences, electrical engineering and computer science, technology management, engineering, and nuclear science. Researchers at NTHU have reported recent breakthroughs in nanotechnology and semiconductors.69\n\n________________\n\nITRI itself is a magnet drawing experienced and talented overseas Taiwanese back to the Hsinchu technology cluster. 70\n\nAlumni networks from the two science universities and NTU have played a central role in the development of the semiconductor and PC industries in the Hsinchu technology cluster. 71\n\nThe work discipline, efficiency, adaptability and élan of Taiwan’s high technology workforce are frequently cited by the founders’ generation of the country’s information technologies industries as a key element in the country’s success.72\n\nKnowledge Spillovers\n\nThe third element in Marshall’s trinity, “knowledge spillovers,” occur in HSP in part due simply to the proximity of research institutions and companies to each other, but the presence of ITRI and the universities amplifies\n\n________________\n\nspillover effects. ITRI scans the entire world for promising new technologies and devotes substantial resources and effort to spreading information about them to local companies and educational institutions. Its numerous R&D alliances are structured to draw upon knowledge gleaned from international markets and research efforts and to deliver that knowledge to domestic firms. Knowledge spillovers from ITRI also occur as its employees take positions in Taiwanese companies—between its founding in 1973 and 2008, an estimated 13,000 ITRI staff moved into industry, many of them remaining with the Hsinchu cluster.73 Research spillovers from the universities were given a powerful boost by the enactment in 1999 of legislation patterned on the U.S. Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which allows universities to own intellectual property developed out of government-funded R&D. 74\n\nFostering New Clusters\n\nDemand for sites in HSP long ago exceeded the Park’s capacity, and Taiwan has opened Southern Taiwan Science Park (1996) and Central Taiwan Science Park (2003). HSP has opened science parks in five satellite locations.75\n\nTaiwan’s Statute for Industrial Innovation, enacted in 2010, emphasizes the formation and upgrading of knowledge-based industrial parks “to facilitate\n\nTABLE APP-A3-6 New Clusters and Their Focus Areas\n\nPark Industries Jhunan Science Park Tongluo Science Park Biotechnology, optoelectronics\n\nIC design, SiP, digital life, avionics,\n\nbiomedical Longlan Science Park Optoelectronics Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park Biomedical Yilan Science Park Knowledge-based series\n\n________________\n\nclustering and innovation.” The government is encouraging the formation of parks dedicated entirely to specific themes, such as biomedicine, logistics, and media. The new law authorizes local governments to establish industrial parks without central government approval. The minister of Economic Affairs indicates that such policies are being implemented to foster “an overall economic environment that is conducive to innovation, the creation of value, and the free flow and application of knowledge.”76\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nTaiwan appears to the outside world as an extraordinarily successful high technology powerhouse. However, its leaders recognize that vulnerabilities exist which could substantially erode the gains which the country has made since the 1970s. The overwhelming majority of Taiwan’s businesses are small enterprises which lack the resources and scale for global competition. The country is arguably not well prepared for an era of global patent warfare, in which infringement litigation can suppress or destroy technology-based start-up companies. A longstanding talent shortage has been exacerbated by an exodus of skilled workers to mainland China. And the American connection, long an important aspect of Taiwan’s high tech development, may fade as the number of Taiwanese students pursuing advanced degrees in the U.S. progressively declines.\n\nITRI Funding\n\nITRI’s budget has not grown for a decade. Its leadership has put a good face on the situation by stating that lean budgets force the institute to rely on other research organizations, which is a key element of its mission. But ITRI is not growing apace with Taiwanese industries that it is tasked with supporting, and the detrimental effects of its limited budgets are evident in a number of areas.\n\nSome observers believe that ITRI is trying to focus on too many technologies with two small a budget, diluting the impact of its efforts. Its low compensation levels for staff have contributed to a manpower shortage (see below). ITRI reportedly would like to attract more foreign expertise to Taiwan but the available funding is inadequate to create attractive compensation packages. Underfunding may explain what observers characterize as the “underpatenting” of ITRI’s technologies, which exposes licensees to litigation.\n\n________________\n\nThe Talent Shortage\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Taiwan enjoys an excellent science and engineering educational infrastructure, the country has long faced the prospect that it will not have enough skilled people to staff its laboratories, research centers, and high tech manufacturing businesses. Additional talent is available in Southeast Asia and mainland China, but Taiwanese investment in these regions has resulted in a major outflow of engineers and skilled managers from Taiwan itself to other parts of Asia, particularly China, where a substantial part of Taiwan’s high tech production based is now located.77 Although nearby Korea and Japan have large pools of skilled labor, attracting talent from these countries has proven difficult.\n\nAn executive at AU Optronics, a major producer of flat panel displays, said in a 2005 interview that his industry needed about 5,500 additional skilled workers per year, but that available talent equaled only about 70 percent of that total. Top universities like National Taiwan University, National Tsing Hua University and National Chiao Tung University between them were turning out 3-4,000 graduates per year and “cannot meet market demand.”78 A 2005 ITRI study found that the country’s semiconductor industry would need 37,500 new skilled workers over the next three years but that the island’s educational system could supply only 21,800 during that time frame.79\n\nITRI itself has been affected by the talent drain. Companies based in China and Singapore reportedly are prepared to pay five times ITRI levels to lure its researchers, one factor underlying ITRI’s annual average manpower turnover of 10 percent.80 In April 2011, ITRI Chairman Tsai Ching-yen warned that ITRI had been hurt by a “talent drain” crisis. He said that 38 ITRI-type organizations had been established in China in recent years and that “all these mainland institutions have set their sights on luring our researchers and engineers away.” He noted that a 68-year old retired ITRI department chief\n\n________________\n\n“was recently hired by China with a lucrative compensation package that included the promise of a villa in two years. The new Chinese employer “mainly hopes the former ITRI official can use his connections in Taiwan’s high tech industry to help recruit more Taiwanese talent to work in China.”81\n\nEnterprise Scale\n\nTaiwan’s economy is dominated by small businesses, which account for over 97 percent of the country’s enterprises and employ over 77 percent of the work force.82 These companies typically have a small capital base and only a few employees, and have proven particularly vulnerable to the global economic downturn which began in 2008.83 While many small and medium enterprises are innovative, they frequently lack the resources and skills needed to bring new products to the global market, to build brand recognition, and to respond to legal and regulatory challenges outside of Taiwan. One of the most important considerations underlying the creation of ITRI was the recognition by the government that Taiwan’s small companies could not afford the equipment, training and other costs associated with advanced R&D.84 While ITRI has partially offset this intrinsic disadvantage, turning ITRI research “into a successful product by SMEs has been a struggle.”85 Even small Taiwanese startups that have achieved technological breakthroughs have proven vulnerable to competitive challenges from large multinationals because they “lack critical mass.”86\n\nThe government of Taiwan commonly seeks to offset the fact that most companies are too small to undertake expensive research by forming them into\n\n________________\n\ntechnology alliances. ITRI bases the alliances on its laboratories, which it uses to teach small firms to catch up with leading edge technologies sufficiently to enable them to perform contract work for the industrial chains of larger Taiwanese and foreign high tech enterprises. As a result, larger Taiwanese firms like Tantung, Acer and Mitac can “rely on hundreds of loosely affiliated domestic suppliers to which they can pass on an endless variety of low-margin, yet quite demanding manufacturing and design tasks.”87 ITRI commonly encourages SMEs in such alliances to divide up research tasks, to specialize and to avoid duplication of effort.88 Organizing successful technology alliances is challenging and a number of them have failed due to divisions among the participating companies.89\n\nThe government has also established a panoply of programs to support SMEs. Beginning in 1996, MOEA’s Small and Medium Enterprise Administration has utilized an SME Development Fund to promote the establishment of small business incubators in Taiwan.90 An SME Credit Guarantee Fund guarantees 70-90 percent of commercial bank loans to SME’s for purchase of machinery, plant construction, and modernization of equipment.91 In 2011, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Regulatory Commission set a target for domestic banks to offer domestic SMEs a total of $7.33 billion in\n\n________________\n\n2012; banks with “good lending performance” would be rewarded “by prioritizing approval of their applications to set up branches in China or overseas.”92 SMEs also can qualify for management and technical consulting support.\n\nThe Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) was established by MOEA in 1999 to provide matching fund support to local start-up companies pursuing innovative technological research with respect to improving existing technologies or developing radical new ideas. The program is funded at a level of about $30 million. The funds can be used to perform research and to collaborate with research organizations like ITRI in joint research projects. The SBIR organization is comprised of a working group which picks promising research proposals to be reviewed by an examination committee consisting mainly of university professors. Individual SBIR grants can be up to amounts of $340,000.93 Taiwan’s SBIR program has come under considerable domestic criticism for being overly bureaucratic.94\n\nIntellectual Property Protection\n\nA major challenge confronting Taiwan’s high tech industries is the increasingly widespread phenomena of patent litigation used as a business strategy to block new industry entrants.95 The Economist reporting on an infringement action by Apple against HTC, a Taiwanese maker of smartphones, commented in December 2011 that—\n\n________________\n\nApple’s victory is only the latest episode in a fierce war in which just about everyone you can think of seems to be suing everyone else for patent infringement … “This really is the first global patent war,” says Joshua Walker, chairman of Lex Machina, which compiles and analyzes data on intellectual property litigation.96\n\nThe plaintiffs are typically “big players in their fields” who can afford the legal fees associated with securing patents and patent litigation whereas the defendant companies are often small Taiwanese companies lacking comparable resources.97 Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, recalled in a 2007 interview that the decision to establish a company devoted purely to manufacturing itself was driven in part by the recognition that Taiwan had “no strength in IP” and that manufacturing was “the part that was least vulnerable to IP attacks from other companies. Most IP disputes were about circuit designs.”98\n\nThe increasing complexity of the technologies being commercialized by Taiwanese companies is amplifying their exposure to patent claims. Handheld devices are now comprised of huge bundles of software and hardware— according to one recent estimate there are now 250,000 patents relevant to a single smartphone.99 Payment of royalties pursuant to licensing agreements is an alternative to litigation, but also entails increased costs. As of 2008, Taiwanese companies were paying over $2.3 billion annually in royalties to foreign patent owners.100\n\nDr. Da Hsuan Feng, Senior Vice President of National Tsing Hua University observes that “one of the weak points of the entire Taiwan island is a shortage of IP legal competency.” He indicates that a need exists for the universities and ITRI to combine and integrate their IP and to market it as a whole—“you can’t commercialize with one patent.” 101 A number of professors from NCTU and NTHU make the point that Taiwan’s patent pools, to the extent they exist, are insufficiently broad and should be comprised of larger numbers of patents.\n\nThe best defense for a company against patent lawsuits is ownership of comparable patents, preferably bundled into packages of multiple patents\n\n________________\n\ncovering all aspects of a new technology. In 2005, ITRI adopted a practice long under way in the United States and Europe of auctioning off bundles of patents on an exclusive license basis. 102\n\nITRI organizes Taiwanese industries, often comprised of small and medium enterprises, into “alliances” to exert collective strength “in talks with international players over patent licensing,” securing better terms and lower royalty rates.103 ITRI defends its own patents in periodic litigation and is forming an infrastructure to support Taiwanese companies’ efforts to manage and defend their intellectual property. 104 In 2011, ITRI announced that it would form an IP management company, “IP Bank,” to provide assistance to Taiwanese firms engaged in legal battles over intellectual property.105 A U.S. patent expert familiar with the IP Bank plan commented that the organization’s primary role would be “defensive” in character, identifying and preventing litigation and averting it by helping companies acquire patent portfolios that protect them from lawsuits.106\n\n________________\n\nSECTORAL CASE STUDIES\n\nThe government of Taiwan has promoted industrial development since 1953 through multi-year development plans targeting what were viewed as strategic sectors. The Third Four Year Plan (1961-64) called for the development of heavy industry, chemicals and electronics sectors, and major industrial growth subsequently occurred in steel, electronics, petrochemicals and shipbuilding.107 The onset of the 1973-74 oil crisis and high inflation brought economic growth nearly to a halt, and led the government to seek an industrial strategy placing more emphasis on non-energy intensive, high technology industries. Arguably, the formation of ITRI in 1973 as part of this broader effort represents the key event in Taiwan’s modern industrial history.108 ITRI’s first major sectoral development effort, in semiconductors, established the foundation for promotion of related sectors in which the country’s growing competency in microelectronics could be leveraged, including displays, lighting, computers, telecommunications and photovoltaics. 109, 110\n\nSemiconductors\n\nIn the early 1970s the island’s microelectronics sector consisted solely of offshore assembly and test operations of foreign manufacturers and one small local firm making bipolar transistors. ITRI founder Y.S. Sun worked with a network of Taiwanese and Chinese-American engineers to formulate a developmental strategy for semiconductors. Sun created ITRI in 1973 as an arm of MOEA charged with conducting applied industrial research and providing technical support to domestic companies. Within ITRI an organization was set up in 1974 to develop semiconductor technology, the Electronics Research and Service Organization (ERSO).\n\n________________\n\nTechnology from the United States\n\nITRI charged ERSO with developing complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which it saw as key to the production of components for application in consumer electronic products. Controversial at the time, the choice of CMOS technology as opposed to then-prevalent NMOS method proved to be an important strategic move because CMOS’ lower cost and power consumption made it attractive for use in personal computers, workstations, and other product sectors which would grow rapidly in the 1980s.111\n\nITRI established a partnership with RCA of the United States in 1975. RCA’s semiconductor manufacturing technology was obsolete, but RCA agreed to supply Taiwan with complete production technology, including complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process design, product specification and testing technology, and manufacturing management and cost accounting know-how as well as a 6-12 month training program for ITRI engineers. The fact that RCA’s technology was outdated had advantages as well as drawbacks—most importantly, the mature process technology was already thoroughly tested and proven.112 RCA supplied CMOS technology and trained a group of 37 Taiwanese students in the fundamentals of semiconductor manufacturing, the “RCA 37.” “In certain respects the training of related ITRI staff at RCA was the decisive moment in the [Taiwanese] semiconductor industry’s history.”113 Out of the RCA 37, “virtually the entire senior echelons of the subsequent semiconductor industry in Taiwan [were] formed.”114\n\n________________\n\nDing-Yuan Yang was one of the founders of ERSO and led the original team of trainees to RCA. Wang had studied physics and chemistry at Princeton University, where he was struck by the nature of the education process. He recalled later that—\n\nPrinceton attached importance to experiments. I’ve talked about this experience many times. I took 50 hours non-credit in a machine shop making things. Some of my classmates who majored in chemistry were required to learn glassblowing. This is when I knew that when you get to do truly advanced and sophisticated research, you have to be able to design and make all the equipment yourself, instead of purchasing existing equipment, machines and tools.115\n\nThe ITRI team, which included a number of other Princeton graduates, took this approach toward the RCA technology transfer, seeking to master every aspect of the manufacturing process and applying and proving skills in a factory environment. Robert Tsao, then an ITRI engineer who participated in the project, said later that “the purpose of this project was not only to conduct pure research but also to transfer over an industrial technology. Here, the phrase ‘industrial technology’ indicated not only a transfer of the technology itself but also the ability to carry out economically efficient mass production of goods.”116 Ding-Yuan Yang recalled that the four project leaders learned not only—\n\nengineering and manufacturing, but the four of us also learned about designing, testing, quality control, procurement accounting and database management. It was a holistic and complete packaging of training. If we only transferred these techniques in a lab, we wouldn’t have been able to attain industrial production. [The idea was] to make a demonstration plant, in the transferring of the technology. You have to get into a factory, bring in some products and transfer some of them out to verify the effectiveness of the transfer of manufacturing technology. Only when you reach a certain yield rate can the transfer be considered valid.117\n\n________________\n\nWhen ITRI’s trainees returned to Taiwan, a pilot facility for manufacturing integrated circuits was established in ERSO to stimulate production and promote R&D, the Integrated Circuit Model Factory (1977). The pilot line produced its first integrated circuits in 1977. The operation of the pilot line served as practical confirmation for the trainees who had served at RCA and the “hidden knowledge” they had gained at RCA was passed on to other trainees who had not been picked for the original RCA mission. The pilot line enabled the RCA trainees to experiment with the actual manufacturing of semiconductors and pass the know-how to Taiwanese manufacturers. Ding-Yuan Yang commented that—\n\nNow looking back, setting up an IC demonstration plant in a research institution was something truly unique in the world. Normally a private plant is set up, and they transfer technologies by themselves. Using the power of the government to establish a demonstration plant in a research institution, to plant it as a seed to spread it out, was a very unique method.\n\nERSO’s pilot line ramped up its production, and volume and quality soon surpassed that of RCA’s devices. In the technology transfer agreement, RCA had guaranteed that that the yield rate would be at least 17 percent, but the yield rate of the ERSO demonstration plant was 70 to 80 percent—a surprise to RCA. Robert Tsao attributed this success to use of new equipment and the high quality of the production team:\n\nThose who were hired by this project were all very outstanding, such as Ding-Yuan Yang, Chintay Shih and Jian-Jun Chang, each of whom had doctoral degrees from Princeton University. Even in the semiconductor industry, it would be almost a waste of their great talents to use them on manufacturing alone. Therefore, it was natural that the yield rate was high.118\n\n________________\n\nITRI continued to purchase new semiconductor manufacturing equipment, dispatched engineers abroad for training, and invited foreign specialists to participate in its development efforts.119\n\nCreation of UMC\n\nDespite investment incentives and technical support from ITRI, Taiwanese companies remained reluctant to invest in the semiconductor business because of the perceived risk. In response the government created Taiwan’s first major semiconductor company in 1980, United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC). UMC in effect spun itself off from ITRI, taking with it a substantial proportion of ERSO’s equipment and 31 of its personnel.120 They included Robert Tsao, a vice-director of ERSO and one of the RCA 37 who eventually became UMC’s chairman. The government took a 44 percent equity stake. ITRI provided UMC with semiconductor mask design services, relieving the company of the need to send its IC designs to foreign mask making firms.121 Dr. Chintay Shih, who served at ITRI between 1976 and 2003, recalls that “we helped them [UMC] to design and build their first site in the Science Park.”122 ITRI lined up UMC’s first customer, a Taiwanese watchmaking company.123 UMC began operations in 1982 and grew rapidly to become one of the world’s leading semiconductor producers.124\n\n________________\n\nPromoting Design Capability\n\nIn 1985, ERSO established the Common Design Center (CDC), a computer-aided semiconductor design facility intended to encourage start-up design firms. ERSO also provided computer-aided design tools and logic cell libraries to nine Taiwanese universities to encourage the establishment of IC design programs. ERSO published IC design manuals and sponsored training classes on computer-aided IC design. Between 1983 and 1990 it spun off more than a dozen firms with IC design capability. It transferred IC design specifications to Syntek Semiconductor Corp., UMC, and Silicon Integrated System Company.125 In 1997, ITRI spun off Prolific Technology, Inc., an ASIC design house which in 2004 was named “most competitive fabless company in Taiwan” by Merrill Lynch.126\n\nITRI’s most effective single initiative in promoting the IC design industry, however, was the creation of TSMC, the world’s first semiconductor foundry in 1987.\n\nCreation of TSMC\n\nAround 1984, Taiwan’s Premier Yu Kuo-hwa offered Morris Chang— who had moved from Texas Instruments to a position as President of General Instruments—a job as head of ITRI, telling Chang “that he particularly wanted to use my ability to transfer technology from just research results to economic benefits for Taiwan industry.”127 Taiwan was facing difficulty in growing its integrated circuit design sector further because of the lack of local manufacturing capability. The idea of a “pure play” semiconductor foundry had been discussed in industry circles for years—that is, an enterprise which provides contract manufacturing services to IC designers but does not sell its own IC products—but the idea was generally regarded as commercially unfeasible.128 With substantial government support, Chang led the establishment of the world’s first semiconductor foundry, Taiwan\n\n________________\n\nLike UMC, TSMC was spun-off by ERSO, which in 1986 set up a six inch VLSI preparatory manufacturing plant and in 1987 transferred it to TSMC. Robert Tsao, the founder of UMC, recalls that ITRI provided TSMC with what was effectively a “free foundry” to support its start-up. In a 2011 oral history interview, he commented:\n\nSo after [ITRI] spending five years and 100 million U.S. dollars on construction, the second demonstration plant was built, and about 500 to 600 trainees were all sublet to TSMC. Therefore, TSMC had foundry at first and they only needed to spend two million U.S. dollars on subletting the foundry. Apart from this ITRI even gave TSMC 7 million U.S. dollars to subsidize the cost of subletting the foundry … In other words the first 3 and a half years of running TSMC was for free and it went very well under the protection of Ministry of Economic Affairs.130\n\nMorris Chang, brought with him 130 ERSO professionals and process technology from ERSO for manufacturing six inch semiconductor wafers. TSMC’s initial shareholders were the government (40 percent), Philips of the Netherlands (26.6 percent) and employees and local private investors (19 percent). The government’s share of TSMC’s capital was funded by the Development Fund of the Executive Yuan, a discretionary development fund at the disposal of Taiwan’s Cabinet administered by Finance Ministry.131\n\nPhilips’ participation in TSMC as an equity investor and technology partner was instrumental in the company’s success. Philips licensed key manufacturing process technology to TSMC.132 Philips was a captive customer for TSMC and provided an outlet for its production at a time when the stability of demand was perceived as a major risk factor for any company pursuing a pure play foundry business model.133 The fact that a world-class company like Philips, one of the largest electronics firms on the globe, was sourcing semiconductors from TSMC drew the attention of companies like Intel and Texas Instruments, which subsequently became TSMC customers. Philips was a multinational company with practical global business experience and experience in intellectual property management. Philips’ IP umbrella, based on a web of\n\n________________\n\ncross-licensing agreements transferred to TSMC, protected the company from patent lawsuits during its initial years of operation.134\n\nThe nature of TSMC’s business served to enhance its technological capabilities. Initially semiconductor firms such as VLSI Technologies passed on technologies to TSMC because without them TSMC could not have fabricated their devices. Customers also provided feedback which was used to refine TSMC’s fabrication methods. The fact that TSMC needed constantly to shift its production to different kinds of devices contributed to the company’s cumulative manufacturing learning.135 TMC grew rapidly, largely by absorbing other ITRI spin-off companies, and became one of the most efficient and versatile semiconductor manufacturers in the world.\n\nThe formation of TSMC as a pure-play foundry, as well as UMC’s subsequent conversion into a foundry, changed the entire business model of the global semiconductor industry in a manner that worked to Taiwan’s advantage. Before the advent of foundries the semiconductor industry was vertically integrated, with manufacturing capital costs constituting a huge barrier to entry. The emergence of foundries enabled “fabless” design firms with no factories of their own—or associated capital costs—to challenge industry leaders with innovative designs involving modest investment costs. Numerous Taiwanese IC design firms sprouted up, utilized TSMC and UMC foundry services, and reaped enormous profits. A large number of expatriate Taiwanese “engineers-turned-entrepreneurs returned from Silicon Valley to drive this process forward.136\n\nWinbond and Vanguard\n\nWinbond Electronics Corporation was formed in 1987 to produce semiconductors memory devices. Most of its original personnel came from ERSO, which also supplied the company with licensed technology.137 Winbond has subsequently become Taiwan’s largest maker of branded integrated circuits.138 Subsequently “a new company started almost every year, and many\n\n________________\n\nwere spinoffs from ERSO.”139 Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation (VIS) was spun off of ITRI in 1994 with TSMC and the Development Fund of the Executive Yuan as major investors. Three hundred and ten employees left positions at ITRI to join the new company.140 VIS was originally established to manufacture dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) but in the early 2000s transformed itself into a pure-play foundry on the TSMC model.\n\nTaiwan Mask Corporation\n\nBy the late 1980s Taiwan had a significant number of IC design houses producing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), devices which are tailored to specific end-use applications. ERSO was supplying some of these firms with semiconductor masks from its internal operation. In 1988 ERSO spun off the Taiwan Mask Corporation (TMC), transferring its own personnel, equipment and technology to the new company. ITRI concluded 10-year technology transfer and development agreement with TMC.141\n\nTaisel\n\nIn 1994, a joint venture was formed by the government-owned China Steel Corporation and the U.S. company MMC, Taiwan International Standard Electronics, Ltd. (Taisel), to produce polished and epitaxial wafers for integrated circuit fabrication. “The government’s effort to create a vertically integrated industry was evident.”142\n\nAsia Pacific Microsystems\n\nAsia Pacific Microsystems Co (APM) was founded in 2001 by a team led by ITRI Executive Vice President Lin Min-shyong. APM took over a five inch wafer foundry for making CMOS chips from Winbond located in HSP and converted it into a six inch foundry for micro-electric mechanical systems (MEMS) devices in 2002. MEMS devices include sensors, microstructures and actuators which are used in consumer, medical, automotive, industrial, and telecommunications applications.143\n\n________________\n\nTechnology Transfer\n\nIn addition to the creation of spin-off companies, ITRI contributed substantially to the development of the semiconductor industry by transferring technology to companies and undertaking joint R&D with several firms. During the 1980s ITRI transferred semiconductor process technology to Hualon Microelectronics and Advanced Device Technology Inc. (ADT). 144 In addition to ERSO, a number of other ITRI labs were engaged in R&D involving semiconductor equipment and materials, with an eye toward creating the foundation of a complete industry supply chain.\n\nLocal Content Initiatives\n\nIn 2007, Minister of Economic Affairs told Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers that they should “adopt locally-made equipment as much as possible in order to help boost Taiwan’s chip-making equipment industry,”\n\nTABLE APP-A3-7 Creating the Supply Chain—Participating Companies\n\nTheme ITRI Laboratories Participating Companies Process technology ERSO Winbond, Mosel, Vitelec, etc. Design ERSO Via, AcerLab, SunPlus, Communications/Computer lab Eltran, etc. Materials Materials Research lab Union Chemical Laboratories Taisel, others Equipment Mechanical Industrial Research Lab GPM, Union, Tong-Tai, etc. Testing ERSO\n\nCenter for Measurement Standards Siliconware, First, etc. Packaging ERSO AES, Siliconware, Communications/Computer lab Materials Research lab Energy & Resources Lab Precision, Oriat, etc. SOURCE: Huang, “Cradle of Technology” (2006) op. cit. p. 42.\n\n________________\n\nITRI is commonly said to have ended its support for the semiconductor industry because of the industry’s commercial success, but in fact, ITRI is engaged in significant developmental work in microelectronics. In 2008, ITRI organized the Advanced Stacked System Technology and Application Consortium to develop technology for 3-dimensional integrated circuits, based on the stacking of multiple thinned ICs with through-die area array interconnects between them.150 SUSS Microtec, a German semiconductor equipment supplier and developer of 3D integration technology joined the consortium in 2009.151 The leading U.S. semiconductor equipment vendor, Applied Materials, joined the consortium in 2009. The consortium established a 300 mm demonstration production line at ITRI using state-of-the-art equipment and materials to produce “through-silicon vias” (TSVS), a technique for making stacked memory and logic chips.152 Rambus, one of the world’s leading technology licensing companies, joined the 3D IC consortium in 2011.153 In early 2012, ITRI was reportedly in discussions with a fabless U.S. semiconductor company about a collaboration in which ITRI would manufacture the U.S. firm's 3D-1C design on a pilot line.154\n\nIn 2010, ITRI was reportedly working with a team of “dozens” at National Tsing Hua University to develop architecture for a high-density 3-dimensional nonvolatile resistive random access memory (RRAM) device that would consume less power and yield higher speeds than existing memory chips.155 In late 2011, ITRI exhibited a prototype high speed non-volatile RRAM which it had developed. The chip has up to 20 times the speed of a flash memory device but consumes only 20 percent of the power and can survive up to 10 years at a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius.156 As of February 2012 ITRI believed that it was “ahead of everybody” in RRAM technology, which it expected to license to Taiwanese companies.157\n\nIn December 2011, Intel Corporation announced a five-year collaboration with ITRI to develop ultra-fast and energy saving semiconductor memory products. The collaboration will focus on producing memory devices utilizing 3D IC stacking technology for applications in cloud computing data\n\n________________\n\ncenters and next-generation mobile devices.158 MOEA pledged to provide $5 million in funding for this project, which the General Director of ITRI’s Information and Communications Research Laboratory, Wu Cheng-wen, said would “enable Taiwanese DRAM chipmakers to produce more value-added chips utilizing existing technologies” not requiring a major investment in new equipment.159\n\nPhotovoltaics\n\nITRI has been working to establish a photovoltaic solar equipment industry in Taiwan for over two decades, and “in the 2000s one can see the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry emerging as the ‘third pillar’ of Taiwan’s high-tech industrialization efforts” (the first two being semiconductors and displays.160 Taiwan’s existing competency in semiconductors is a major asset in the PV effort.161 Major Taiwanese companies like TSMC, AuO Optronics, Delta Electronics and possibly Formosa Plastics are investing in the industry, moves which “promise to transform the Taiwan industry and make it one of the world’s leading global players, alongside China, Germany, Japan and the USA.”162\n\nIn 1987, ITRI’s Energy and Mining Research Division began R&D on monocrystalline and amorphous silicon, materials used to manufacture solar photovoltaic cells. In 1988, Taiwan’s first solar cell company was established, Sinonar Amorphous Company, using technology developed by ITRI and founded by two former ITRI staffers. The new company focused on indoor solar cells using amorphous silicon. In 2004, ITRI spun off a solar cell company, DelPoint, a joint venture with Delta Electronics, which received technology, capital and staff from ITRI.163 The following year Delta began production of solar cells, and a large number of Taiwanese entered the solar cell companies business, some of which “[stole] talents from the government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), some of whose laboratories\n\n________________\n\ndeveloped the technology.”164 The government implemented a series of policy measures to foster the grown of the photovoltaic industry, providing subsidies for installation of photovoltaic power generation systems, including installation subsidies to households for up to 50 percent of the total cost of installing rooftop PV systems.165\n\nIn 2006, MOEA established the Taiwan Silicon Conference to develop a strategy for creating an industry supply chain in photovoltaics, an initiative that led to the establishment of Taiwan’s first polysilicon manufacturing company to provide upstream materials for PV cell makers. Photovoltaic supply chains now exist at three Taiwanese Science Parks.\n\nITRI has emerged as Taiwan’s foremost source of expertise and research activity with respect to solar cells. Between 1984 and 2008 ITRI had secured or was pursuing applications for 1,940 patents in solar cell technology. In 2006, ITRI opened the PV Technology Center.166 ITRI-trained scientists and engineers have played an important role in the development of Taiwan’s solar\n\nTABLE APP-A3-9 Creating the PV Supply Chain\n\nMaterials Cells Modules Systems Hsinchu Science Park WW Corp Gintech Gintech Delta SAS DelSolar DelSolar Neo Solar Central Taiwan Science Park Setek AUO AUO AUO SR Solar BMC Delta Delta Nextpower Nextpower Southern Taiwan Science Park Motech Motech Delta Delta E-Ton Nanowin\n\nSOURCE: Dr. Weileun Fang, National Tsing Hua University, Applications of Micro Tech for Renewable Energy at Taiwan: Progress and Prospects (2011).\n\n________________\n\ncell industry.167 In 2007, ITRI decided to release 233 patents in the fields of solar energy and energy storage and efficiency to local Taiwanese companies. Most of the patents covered solar power generation, and were released in order to “[upgrade] local technology levels and assist … industries to expand their global market share in the wake of surging demand for green and clean energy.”168 In January 2010, ITRI spinoff TSMC acquired a 20 percent stake in Motech Industries, Taiwan’s largest maker of solar cells, for $196 million.169\n\nTaiwan’s semiconductor manufacturers, including two ITRI spinoffs, are playing a significant role in the development of Taiwan’s thin film solar cell industry, a technology area holding great promise for solar power generation.170 In 2008, a UMC subsidiary, NextPower Technology Inc., was the first Taiwanese firm to begin volume production of thin film solar cells. 171 In 2010, TSMC began construction of a $258 million Thin Film Solar R&D Center and fab in Central Taiwan Science Park.172 Concurrently TSMC acquired a $50 million equity stake in California-based Stion, a start-up conducting R&D in CIG5 technology.173 ITRI has worked with several Taiwanese universities to develop modification in the thin-film PV CIGS manufacturing process that do not utilize toxic selenide.174 Taiwan’s MOEA has formed the CIGS Alliance, an ITRI technology-diffusion alliance which includes a number of small TF companies as well as large firms like TSMC and AU Optronics.175\n\nBy 2011, Taiwan’s solar cell industry ranked number two worldwide by production value ($4.3 billion), having surpassed Japan and Germany. Taiwan currently holds 20 percent of the world market for solar cells, and while\n\n________________\n\nits revenues rank behind those of China, Taiwan is more technologically advanced than China in this field.176\n\nBiotechnology\n\nTaiwan has been promoting the development of a biotechnology industry since the early 1980s but the results to date have been mixed at best, despite a massive deployment of government resources.177 In contrast to Taiwan’s developmental effort in microelectronics, in which ITRI was the governmental entity responsible for promoting the industry, in biotechnology, Taiwan’s “agencies and units involved are so numerous and diverse that a serious coordination problem has emerged.”178 Instead of a single main technology cluster (Hsinchu) which characterized the formative years of the semiconductor industry and continues to account for most of the semiconductor industry’s output, Taiwan has already established six biotechnology parks with more planned.179 The Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB), a government research organization formed to play an ITRI-like role as a technology intermediary—turning basic research into commercial products—has drifted into an emphasis on basic research.180\n\nITRI has long taken the position that Taiwan’s developmental efforts in biotechnology should be limited areas where the country could leverage existing strong competencies rather than risky, leaps into blue-sky areas with uncertain prospects. ITRI has argued that Taiwan should seek to integrate its medical research infrastructure with its strengths in electronics and the information and communications technologies. ITRI also favors establishment of a few centers of excellence in the handful of medical areas in which Taiwan is a world leader—most notably liver diseases—in order to attract multinational biopharmaceutical companies to the island for R&D.181 ITRI has concentrated\n\n________________\n\nits biotechnology efforts in areas of strength, and can point to some market success stories. One analyst observed in 2007 that “only in areas where biotechnology and microelectronics overlap can one find some prospect of success.”182 ITRI’s Medical Electronics and Device Technology Center (MED) is driving this effort.183 Taiwanese medical device makers have already made significant inroads in some global markets.\n\nITRI established a Biomedical Engineering Center in 1999 (BMEC), which was split in 2006 to form the Biomedical Engineering Research Laboratories (BEL) and the Medical Electronics and Device Technology Center (MED). BMEC’s Biochip Program combined research efforts of five ITRI laboratories to develop DNA microarray and microfluidics technology, which is essential to the rapid unraveling of the human genome. Sixteen patents from this effort were transferred from ITRI to a spin-off company, Phalanx Biotechnology Group, established in 2003. The research effort organized by ITRI drew in the Canadian Genetic Diseases Network (CGDN) and the Information System for Biotechnology (ISB), a U.S.-based research organization. Using ITRI’s technology, Phalanx was able to drop the price of one gene chip from about $1,000 down to $50-80 per slide. A CGDN executive commented that “we have looked at technologies from around the world and we are sure this is the best tech available [in the field of gene chips].”184\n\nIn 2002 ITRI spun off CESCO Bioengineering Co., Ltd., comprised of eight team members from ITRI’s Tissue Engineering and Biomaterial Laboratory, to commercialize high cell density culture technology.185 CESCO developed a novel disposable pact bed contractile (DPBC) bioreactor suitable\n\nTABLE APP-A3-10 Global Share for Taiwanese Medical Devices\n\nItem 2009 Global Market Share (Percent) Digital blood pressure monitor 42 Electric wheelchair/scooter 30 Electric ear thermometer 30 Electronic thermometer 60 Pre-filled IV auto injector 50 SOURCE: Dr. Chei-Hsiang Chen, Director, Biotech & Pharmaceutical Industries Program office, MOEA Taiwan’s Biotech Industry Overview, October 21, 2010.\n\n________________\n\nfor producing various proteins and viruses and non-adherent cell cultures including embryonic stem cells.186 ITRI spun off DailyCare Biomedical in 2004 to commercialize low cost, portable medical devices for home core users. The company’s new CEO was K.P. Lin, the former chief of ITRI’s Biomedical Engineering Center.187 The care technology underlying one of these products, ReadMyHeart, a portable electrocardiogram, was developed by ITRI’s BEC.188 This product was approved for use in Japan in 2007, representing the first non-Japanese company to obtain a class-II medical device license under Japan’s Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, which took effect in 2005.189\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation (SII) enacted in 2010 is the most recent of the promotional statutes that have provided the institutional framework for Taiwan's industrial development. SII represents a departure from the previous laws in that it provides not only for the promotion of manufacturing but also agriculture and services, and seeks to redirect Taiwan from its focus on manufacturing toward innovation, “soft power,” development of national brands, and advanced logistics.190 ITRI currently singles out 20 sectors which represent developmental priorities.191\n\nCurrent ITRI developmental projects are underway addressing themes relevant to all of the smart industries noted above as well as biotechnology,\n\nTABLE APP-A3-11 Taiwan’s Developmental Priorities\n\nEmerging Industries Smart Industries Service Industries Health Care Cloud computing WiMAX Biotechnology Smart electronic vehicles International medical Quality agriculture Smart green buildings High tech finance Tourism Patent industrialization Music/digital content Cultural/creative Exhibitions Green energy International logistics Urban renewal International cuisine Chinese e-commerce High education output\n\n________________\n\nhealth care, quality agriculture, green energy, and WiMAX. In most cases ITRI has formed industry alliances to prepare for the production of the new technologies.\n\nITRI is also developing what it characterizes as the latest in a series of related electronic hardware technologies which incorporate semiconductor technology, including solid state lighting (LED), resistive random access memory (RRAM, high-speed, low power consumption semiconductors) 3D television, flexible electronics, “floating image,” and optoelectronic medical devices.192\n\nITRI is currently seeking to strengthen its capability in “upstream” pre-competitive R&D, to enhance the interdisciplinary character of its work, and to shift from an emphasis on the manufacture of components to development of systems, services and applications.193\n\nCONCLUDING PERSPECTIVE\n\nTaiwan’s economic development and ITRI’s role in creating advanced industries have been widely studied, but the extent to which the ITRI model is adaptable elsewhere is unclear. The circumstances underlying Taiwan's success are not necessarily present in other countries and for that matter may not always be present in every case in Taiwan itself. The creation of ITRI brought together cosmopolitan elite commanding a vast pool of knowledge absorbed from the world’s finest research universities and the most technologically advanced international companies. This remarkable founders’ generation was backed in its efforts by a government in which the ruling party held a monopoly on political power and an abiding belief that economic policy should be conducted by skilled professionals shielded from political pressure. Government funding\n\n________________\n\nfor ITRI was substantial and sustained.194 Ancillary government laws and policies were implemented to support ITRI in areas such as human resources, venture capital, and creation of science parks, intellectual property protection, and start-up of new companies. Replicating this mix of factors would be a challenge for any government.\n\nITRI has remained relevant by continual focus on its original, carefully-defined mission—not that of a research laboratory, but of a bridge connecting the international research community to small and medium Taiwanese businesses which—although entrepreneurial and highly motivated—lack the resources to conduct research and stay abreast of international technology trends. ITRI has developed institutional practices and policies which serve this mission:\n\nIts policy of encouraging its own personnel to leave after four to five years continually seeds Taiwanese industry with experienced and technology-savvy leaders.\n\nIts technology integration centers perform an internal interdisciplinary silo-breaking function which in its later stages is passed along to the private sector in the form of complete industry supply chains developed in ITRI-led industry alliances and research projects.\n\nThe physical proximity of researchers, labs and companies in the Hsinchu technology cluster fosters continual knowledge spillovers from the research community to private companies.\n\nITRI’s incubation center provides innovative start-ups with technology with commercial potential, business and legal advice, funding opportunities, access to research facilities, and introductions to potential customers and investors.\n\nITRI’s international outreach efforts acquire technology, but are also leading to foreign research efforts located in Taiwan itself with participation of Taiwanese companies.\n\nSignificantly, ITRI has not veered off course to pursue Nobel prizes or engage in industrial empire-building like Japan’s Ministry of Economic Trade and Industry in the 1960s and 1970s. It has maintained its focus on its core mission of technology intermediation between the global research community and Taiwanese companies.195\n\n________________"
