        "text": "William Brangham:\n\nThis week, tensions have increased in the Taiwan Strait following incidents near an island involving the Chinese and Taiwanese Coast Guards.\n\nIt's happening at a sensitive moment in between Taiwan's recent election and the upcoming inauguration of its new president.\n\nNick Schifrin speaks to Taiwan's new representative in Washington for his first broadcast interview.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nMore than any single issue, Taiwan has long been at the center of tension between the United States and Beijing. Last month, Taiwan elected Lai Ching-te, known as William Lai, as president.\n\nIt is an unprecedented third straight presidential victory for the Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP. Beijing calls Lai a separatist whose election could trigger war. But, publicly, Lai has insisted his policy is to retain the status quo.\n\nTo discuss these issues and the wider relations among Taiwan, China and the U.S., we welcome Alexander Tah-Ray Yui, Taiwan's top diplomat to the United States.\n\nThank you very much, Representative.\n\nLet's begin with some recent tension in the strait. Last week, two Chinese nationals died when their boat capsized while it was being chased about one mile from the Taiwanese island of Kinmen. Today, Taiwan drove away a Chinese Coast Guard boat after yesterday the Chinese Coast Guard actually boarded a Taiwanese tourist boat.\n\nWhat is your concern that these incidents could escalate?\n\nAlexander Tah-Ray Yui, Taiwanese Representative to the United States: Well, we have always strived for status quo in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe incident that you just mentioned, it's a concerning trend that is happening. They are the ones who are changing the status quo by changing all these incidents. They talk about red lines. They say, oh, you shouldn't cross the red line because this is a fundamental issue for the people of the Republic of China.\n\nBut they are the ones changing the red lines. They draw the red lines constantly on a different line. And that is a concerning trend, including the one in Kinmen.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nI have a question about whether Taiwan trusts the United States. We looked at a poll that shows, over the last few years, Taiwanese trust in the United States has dropped from 45 percent to 34 percent.\n\nAnd, of course, we're all watching where Congress has not been able to send aid, mostly to Ukraine, but also to Taiwan and Israel, that the administration has promised. The leading Republican candidate in the election, of course, is promising or is vowing that he will not stand by promises to NATO.\n\nDo you trust that in the future the U.S. will stand by whatever promises it makes to Taiwan?\n\nAlexander Tah-Ray Yui:\n\nWell, the recent definition, whenever people talk about Taiwan-U.S. relations, the most often used term is rock-solid.\n\nAnd I would say that the support that we, the Republic of China Taiwan, we get from United States is bipartisan. And it's very heartwarming that Congress has the last session passed over 60 resolutions or acts in favor of Taiwan.\n\nThe United States, who has — is having elections in November. And we are trustful that, whoever wins the election, the new administration, this bipartisan support for Taiwan will continue to be. So, we trust that we will continue working closely with the U.S. administration, as well as Congress, so that Taiwan can get under circumstances the best defense capabilities as possible.\n\nAlexander Tah-Ray Yui:\n\nYes, the security — and he mentioned about, if you want peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, then you should not cross our red lines, and then you should follow our one-China principle and accept that Taiwan is part of us.\n\nAnd excuse me, this sounds very much like Munich in 1938, when Hitler said, you want peace and stability in my region, then cut — Sudetenland is mine. Isn't it the same thing that they're saying?\n\nBut, besides, I'm — as I said…\n\n(Crosstalk)\n\nAlexander Tah-Ray Yui:\n\nPeople in Taiwan are not talking about independence nowadays. You go to Taiwan, nobody is talking about independence.\n\nAgain, Taiwan is our official name is Republic of China. We are already a sovereign and independent nation. So, there is no talk about independence, because we already are. And, again, as I mentioned in another occasion, if we talk about independence, it means that we are right now subordinate to some other entity, which we're not.\n\nIn President Tsai's 2021 National Day speech, she mentioned there's four insistences. We will insist on rejecting any attempt to encroach or annex Taiwan and the Republic of China and the insistence that the future of ROC Taiwan will be determined by the people of Taiwan. And that's the line that we follow and that's the road that President Lai is also following."
