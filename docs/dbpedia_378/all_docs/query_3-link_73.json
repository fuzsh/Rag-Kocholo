        "text": "Medical Exam Instructions\n\nAll immigrant visa applicants, regardless of age, require a medical examination prior to the issuance of a visa. Only a physician accredited by the American Institute in Taiwan can perform this exam. It is your responsibility to schedule a medical exam with one of the doctors listed below before your visa interview appointment at the American Institute in Taiwan. Medical examination results from other physicians will not be accepted.\n\nSchedule and attend a medical examination with one of the AIT-designated physicians about 3-4 weeks before your visa interview. Hospitals in Taiwan typically require 2-3 weeks after the appointment date to finalize the results. If your medical results will not be complete by the date of your interview, please come for your interview as scheduled with your medical exam receipt from the hospital.\n\nApproved Physicians:\n\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH AND WELFARE, EXECUTIVE YUAN\n\nFENG YUAN HOSPITAL\n\nDr. Ching Jen Chang, and Dr. Yu Chieh Tsai\n\nNo.100, An-Kan Road, Feng Yuan District, Taichung City 420\n\nTelephone: (04) 2527-1180 ext. 3232 - 3233\n\nTAIWAN ADVENTIST HOSPITAL\n\nOnline registration only\n\nDr. Hsin Ying Lin, Dr. Pei-Hsuan Weng, and\n\nDr. Chih-Hsung Huang\n\n#424, Pa Teh Rd., Sec.2, Taipei\n\nTelephone: (02) 2740-0729\n\nInterview Guidelines\n\nRescheduling or cancelling your interview\n\nWe recommend you make every effort to attend your scheduled immigrant visa appointment. You may not schedule a new appointment until your original appointment date has passed. If you are not able to attend on this date, you must book a new available appointment slot with AIT. Please note that due to workload constraints appointment slots are limited; missing your original appointment may result in significant delays to your visa processing. If no appointment slots are available at the time you check, please monitor the website. We regularly make more appointment slots available.\n\nDV applicants should be aware that visas are numerically limited and must be issued by September 30 of the program year. For these applicants, there is no guarantee that a visa will still be available on the date of your rescheduled interview. Please carefully consult the Visa Bulletin before you decide to reschedule your interview.\n\nSecurity screening procedures\n\nAll visitors to AIT must follow certain security procedures; see the list of prohibited items. The American Institute in Taiwan cannot store prohibited items for you. You will not be allowed to enter AIT with prohibited items. All visitors must make other arrangements to store prohibited items before entering AIT. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in significant delays or cancellation of your appointment.\n\nPlease bring only what is required for your interview. Mobile phones are NOT allowed in the interviewing area, and will be stored at the security check. When you arrive at AIT, please enter at the Consular/Visa Entrance and proceed to the third floor. You may not be admitted more than 10 minutes before or after your listed appointment time.\n\nAccompanying persons\n\nDue to security considerations, there is no information window for walk-in visitors at the American Institute in Taiwan.\n\nAccess to the Consular Section waiting area is limited to the following:\n\nApplicants\n\nOne parent or legal guardian (for applicants under 18 years old)\n\nOne aide for a disabled or elderly applicant\n\nApproved interpreter\n\nWe can provide services in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Taiwanese. If you do not speak any of these languages, you need to bring an interpreter to your visa appointment. Please submit an email request to the Call Center at least two weeks before your interview date. Your interpreter must be able to speak English. Interpreters without prior AIT approval will not be allowed into the Consular Section waiting area.\n\nVisa appointment holders may not be admitted more than 10 minutes before or after their appointment.\n\nImmigrant visa fees\n\nIf you have not paid all required fees to either the National Visa Center or via the appointment website, please be prepared to pay these fees on the day of your interview. All fees may be paid in cash in U.S. dollars, NT dollars, or by credit card.\n\nChecks are not accepted. Please note that if you are found ineligible to receive a visa, the application fee cannot be refunded. A complete list of fees can be found here.\n\nDo not make travel plans outside of Taiwan\n\nIf your visa is approved, we will keep your passport at the American Institute while we prepare your immigration packet and print a visa for your passport. We will return your passport to you via courier services to the document delivery address you previously registered. Average processing time after your interview is one week. If you need travel within Taiwan while your passport is still with us, please make sure you have a valid picture ID other than your passport.\n\nIf you have urgent international travel within 10 days after your appointment date, please inform the officer at your interview. Your passport can be returned to you without a visa, and your application will be refused until you send your passport to AIT through our drop-off service after you return to Taiwan.\n\nback to top\n\nAfter Your Visa Interview\n\nA consular officer can make a decision on a visa application only after reviewing the formal application and interviewing the applicant. There is no guarantee that you will receive a visa. Do not sell your house, car or property, resign from your job or make non-refundable flight or other travel arrangements until you have received your immigrant visa.\n\nIf more information is needed\n\nSometimes a consular officer is unable to make a decision on a visa application because he/she needs to review additional documents, or the case requires further administrative processing. When additional documents are requested, the consular officer will give you a refusal letter that instructs you to submit additional documents. The letter will include instructions on how to send those documents to AIT. Administrative processing takes additional time after the interview. Please note, the duration of the administrative processing will vary based on the individual circumstances of each case.\n\nWhat happens after visa approval\n\nPassport, Visa, and Sealed Immigrant Packet – We will place your immigrant visa on a page in your passport. Please review your visa to make sure there are no typographical errors. We will also give you a sealed envelope containing documents that you must give to U.S. immigration authorities when you arrive in the United States for the first time. Do not open this envelope. You must carry it with you; do not put it in your checked luggage. If you receive X-rays and vaccination records during your medical examination, carry those with you and give them to the U.S. immigration authorities.\n\nIf you have received an immigrant visa endorsed with a “IV Docs in CCD” annotation, which means your immigrant visa was issued under the Modernized Immigrant Visa (MIV) program, you will not receive a sealed package of documents. All required documents have been electronically transmitted to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a part of the Electronic Visa Information Packet (EVIP).\n\nUSCIS Immigrant Fee – All individuals who are issued immigrant visas overseas must pay an Immigrant Fee to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) prior to traveling to the United States. This fee is for processing your residency status and printing your Permanent Resident Card. The only people exempt from paying this fee are adopted children entering the United States under the Hague Process, returning residents (SB-1s), and people traveling on a K visa.\n\nWhen You Should Travel – You must enter the United States before the expiration date on your visa, which is usually based on the expiration date of your medical report. Your visa cannot be extended, and all fees are nonrefundable. The principal applicant must enter before or at the same time as other family members with visas.\n\nUnless they are eligible for benefits under the Child Status Protection Act, children who are issued a visa before turning 21 years of age must enter the United States before their 21st birthday to avoid losing their immigrant status.\n\nGetting a Green Card – Your Form I-551 Permanent Resident Card, also known as a green card, will be automatically mailed to the address in the United States that you write in your DS-260 visa application form. This is a very important document that proves you have permission to reside in the United States. If you plan to travel outside the U.S. before your green card arrives: Please consult USCIS’s and CBP’s websites for rules about what documents you need to re-enter the country. We also recommend you check with the airline to ensure you are in compliance with their rules. Once your card is issued, you should not stay outside of the United States for more than one year. If you do, you will lose your status as a Lawful Permanent Resident.\n\nChildren’s Issues – In the United States, children are required to have certain vaccinations before they can enroll in school. We recommend that you bring your child’s complete vaccination records with you to the United States. If your child is adopted, you have full custody as a result of a divorce, or you share custody with another parent, you should bring a copy of all applicable adoption or custodial papers from the authoritative court in your home country. You will need these papers (translated into English) for issues such as school enrollment, medical care, and eventual citizenship.\n\nInformation for New Immigrants – Please visit the USCIS web page for helpful information on moving to the United States. You can read their publication “Welcome to the United States: A Guide for New Immigrants” online.\n\nback to top"
