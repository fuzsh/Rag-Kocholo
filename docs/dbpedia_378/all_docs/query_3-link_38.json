        "text": "This work is based on an online survey, submitted to inquire about Taiwanese people linguistics’ ideology and identity, in order to collect direct data on the view that Taiwanese people have on their languages. The aim of the work is to analyze the historical facts and the linguistic policies that in history changed deeply the current situation of Taiwan languages. After a brief explanation on the history of Taiwan and the languages of Taiwan, the paper will try to underline the political use of the languages during the Japanese imperialist period and the following period of Guo Ming Tang rules, taking in partial consideration to the historical, social and cultural aspects that could have influence on nowadays socio-linguistic Taiwan panorama, such education policies, economy and development of the land. The concept of 国語 (Jap: kokugo, chn: guoyu), was considered fundamental to better understand where Japanese before and Guo Ming Tang later, failed and succeeded and how these policies are reflect on the view that Taiwanese people have on their languages now. The data collected though the online survey was fundamental and are considered as the most direct sources to analyze Taiwanese people point of view and beliefs toward their languages and identity. In conclusion, the work will try to expose possible linguistic policies to adopt in order to preserve local languages that are (in this paper) considered fundamental aspects to preserve the unicity of the Taiwanese culture and identity. The advantage being a better understanding of how the use of a multicultural education could be positive to Taiwan’s future. From this papers point of view, Taiwan could represent a positive example of the possible advancement in multicultural cooperation that a multi lingual and multi-ethnic country education can offer, if government and population support this idea.\n\nBy looking at why and how the Taiwanese and Singaporean governments have attempted to give meaning to Chineseness, and by asking “when and why (Chinese) identity is invoked”, this paper focuses sharply on the “crises of perception” that have given rise to an indistinct non-Chinese identity in Taiwan and Singapore. At the same time, by taking a cross-state comparative approach, this paper argues that despite the differences in the socio-political contexts of the two states, Mandarin, a product of language policy-making in both cases, has ironically become a language that sets Mandarin-speaking China apart as the Other.\n\nThis study investigates how the ethnic visibility of Taiwan Hakka is improved through language use. The usage of a unique Hakka symbolic code <nganggiang stiff neck> is focused on. Based on data from the four Taiwan major newspapers, an analysis with text techniques shows that the code emerges along with social-political developments in Taiwan, with its meaning turning from negative to positive connotation. Its frequency is highly correlated with major political events in Taiwan, with peaks during the two or three years before presidential elections. It illustrates semiotic innovation, extending from Hakka to Hakka non-human, to non-Hakka, and to non-Hakka non-human frames. The salient image it creates increases Hakka ethnic visibility and enhances their ethnic identity. A significant implication is that minority ethnic groups can employ a unique symbolic code, empowering it with positive connotation. Through extensive language use, its representation can raise their ethnic visibility and enhance their ethnic identity."
