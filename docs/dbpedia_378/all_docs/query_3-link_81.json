The Society offers leading research in nature-inspired problem solving, including neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems. Members contribute to the theory, design, application, and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms, emphasizing neural networks, connectionist systems, genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems in which these paradigms are contained.",

        "text": "Welcome to the page for the IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (IEEE TAI). IEEE has established the new journal our community has been waiting for to publish our work on Artificial Intelligence! The submission site for manuscripts accepts submissions to the journal. Don’t miss out on this opportunity and join the community of authors who are publishing in the IEEE TAI! It is time to prepare your best piece of work for IEEE TAI to increase your visibility in the international AI community and to be among the top authors to publish in IEEE TAI.\n\nQueries to the Founding Editor-in-Chief, Prof. Hussein Abbass from UNSW Canberra, Australia, at ieee.tai.eic@gmail.com.\n\nScope\n\nThe IEEE Transactions on artificial intelligence (TAI) is a multidisciplinary journal publishing papers on theories and methodologies of Artificial Intelligence. Applications of Artificial Intelligence are also considered.\n\nA video with example publications can be seen [Here]\n\nImpact Score\n\nThe values displayed for the journal bibliometrics fields in IEEE Xplore are based on the Journal Citation Report from Clarivate from the 2022 report released in June 2023. Journal Citation Metrics Journal Citation Metrics such as Impact Factor, Eigenfactor Score™ and Article Influence Score™ are available where applicable. Each year, Journal Citation Reports© (JCR) from Thomson Reuters examines the influence and impact of scholarly research journals. JCR reveals the relationship between citing and cited journals, offering a systematic, objective means to evaluate the world's leading journals. Find out more about IEEE Journal Rankings.\n\nIEEE Guidelines on AI-Generated Text\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.\n\nPaper template can be accessed here.\n\nSponsors"
