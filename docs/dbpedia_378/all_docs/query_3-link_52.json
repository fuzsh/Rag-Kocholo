        "text": "Uber-malcontent Oliver Gerets, is back in my comments section, this time complaining that my “statements are still oversimplified and misleading.” Which I think probably just means that he hasn’t bothered to read much of my blog before, as everything I said in the post he’s referring to on whole-body movement is pretty well explained in previous posts, if you want to look for it.\n\nHis issue is that I said the following were the 3 movement principles of Tai Chi, without further explanation:\n\n1) moving from the dantien\n\n2) power up from the ground (jin) – rooted in the feet, expressed by the fingers.\n\n3) coiling and spiraling actions from the dantien out to the extremities and back.\n\nHe’s right – I did exactly that and moved on because I didn’t want to get sidetracked on them and get onto the main point I was discussing. You see, I’ve gone over those points before, but we might as well use this as a springboard to discuss these ideas again and un-simplify everything. Just like Al Pacino in the Godfather – just when I thought I’d got out, but he pulled me right back in.\n\nLet’s deal with Oliver’s first complaint.\n\n“1. There is no generally accepted definition what the dantien is amongst Taijiquan practitioners. Not even in Chen style. “Moving from the dantien” is a hollow phrase with very little practical meaning.”\n\nI don’t know what he means with the “not even in Chen style” comment, so let’s ignore that.\n\nI’d agree that there are no accepted definitions of anything amongst Taijiquan practitioners of what the dantien is, but there are no accepted definitions of anything amongst the practitioners. They’re a strange bunch of people ranging from weekend dabblers to full-on fanatics who have very differing views on everything under the sun, but the people at the top of the family trees tend to disagree much less. They all know what they mean.\n\nI also think most Tai Chi people do know what the dantien is. For clarity, let me add my own definition:\n\nThe dantien I’m referring to is simply the lower abdomen area of the body. It encompasses the front, sides and back of the body. It’s a general area, rather than a specific point. When I’m talking about “moving from the dantien” I’m talking about movement originating in this area of the body. You could call this area the waist, if you like, so long as you understand that it’s not a line, like a waistline is.\n\nI’m not sure what more explanation I can give of that – it’s fairly simple.\n\nThe how of the matter is not so simple. Anybody can move that area of their body without any connection to the rest of their body – the limbs and head, for example. Dancers do it all the time. What’s hard is making it connect to everything else.\n\nIn Tai Chi you need a tangible connection between the dantien area and the extremities so that once you move the dantien area, the extremities are also moved as a consequence. This connection is formed by what the Chinese called the muscle/tendon channels in antiquity. These then formed the basis of the meridian system over time.\n\nMammals usually have muscle/tendon channels on the front and back of the body. Yin channels on the front and yang channels on the back. They consist of muscle, tendon, ligaments, fascia and skin and can be affected by abdominal breathing (which is also centered on the dantien area).\n\nIf you can hold the body in a neutral position (the classic Zhan Zhuang posture “hold the ball” is good for this) then you can keep an equal tension on the front and back muscle-tendon channels. You can then use your breath to create a small pull on these channels when you breathe in and out. The connection starts off as very weak, but grows stronger over time.\n\nSo, Zhan Zhuang, Tao Yin and Qigong exercises strengthen this connection over time. Eventually, the connections get strong enough that you can affect the movement of the limbs with small changes in the dantien area, like rotating it left and right, or up and down, all in coordination with the breathing.\n\nIn Taijiquan, (which deals with humans standing upright, not tigers), the dantien, legs and feet must form a connection and drive the power of the rest of the body:\n\nFrom the Tai Chi classics:\n\n“The feet, legs, and waist should act together\n\nas an integrated whole,\n\nso that while advancing or withdrawing\n\none can grasp the opportunity of favorable timing\n\nand advantageous position.”\n\n“The principle of adjusting the legs and waist\n\napplies for moving in all directions;\n\nupward or downward,\n\nadvancing or withdrawing,\n\nleft or right.”\n\nMovement originating in the dantien, therefore, becomes a real, physical phenomina, rather than an abstract idea.\n\nThis is what I mean, Oliver.\n\nThe best exercise I’ve seen to help you develop this skill is a single-arm wave from Chen style silk reeling. In my original post I linked to a video showing the basic single arm wave. I’ll link to it again here.\n\nIn future posts I’ll address Oliver’s next 2 complaints."
