        "text": "There are many challenges to creating just and sustainable societies, but one of the largest is transparency in decision-making. The general public in many places around the world is unable to access crucial information about their leadership. This information is essential to protecting human rights and the natural resources people depend on, which could otherwise face abuse from large entities like governments or corporations.\n\nAn informed and empowered public monitors government and corporate performance, is alert to problems, challenges the conventional wisdom of government or corporate decision-makers, discusses the issues, organizes social and political change and demands improvements. The public can also better hold decision-makers accountable when independent courts can supply solutions without political interference.\n\nThe Access Initiative is the largest network in the world dedicated to ensuring that citizens have the right and ability to influence decisions about the natural resources that sustain their communities.\n\nWe advocate for the three “access rights,” which include:\n\nAccess to Information\n\nAccess to Public Participation\n\nAccess to Justice\n\nThese rights are practical means of ensuring governments consider sustainable development concerns and the disproportionate impacts on impoverished and vulnerable populations when making decisions.\n\nThe TAI network, encompassing more than 250 civil society organizations in over 50 countries worldwide, is made up of country chapters independent of each other and of WRI. Each chapter is led by a TAI partner organization and consists of individual experts and civil society organizations which promote environmental democracy at the national level and undertake evidence-based advocacy, engagement and programs that they develop and implement. World Resources Institute (WRI) serves as the global secretariat for the TAI network."
