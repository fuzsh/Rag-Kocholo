These are limited to travel-sized containers that are 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item. Placing these items in the small bag and separating from your carry-on baggage facilitates the screening process. Pack items that are in containers larger than 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters in checked baggage.\n\nAny liquid, aerosol, gel, cream or paste that alarms during screening will require additional screening.\n\nExemptions\n\nMedications\n\nInfant and child nourishments\n\nInbound International Flights\n\nYou may carry duty free liquids in secure, tamperâ€“evident bags, more than 3.4 oz or 100 ml in your carry-on bag if:\n\nThe duty free liquids were purchased internationally and you are traveling to the United States with a connecting flight.\n\nThe liquids are packed in a transparent, secure, tamper-evident bag by the retailer and do not show signs of tampering when presented to TSA for screening.\n\nThe original receipt for the liquids is present and the purchase was made within 48 hours.\n\nThe items inside the secure, tamper-evident bags must be screened and cleared. Any item that alarms or is unable to be screened will not be permitted in your carry-on bag. We recommend packing all liquids, gels, and aerosols that are over 3.4 oz or 100 ml in your checked baggage, even if they are in a secure, tamper-evident bag."
