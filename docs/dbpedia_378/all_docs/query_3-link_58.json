Or you can create a note and wait for local mapper to resurvey it.\n\nContacting original mapper may make sense.\n\nRemember, it is better to not edit than break data in case of tagflidling - create note if unclear or unsure.\n\nLet me know if this list is useful but outdated (I will setup refreshing it in such case) or pointless/problematic (I can delete it if it is causing more problems than benefits).\n\nSome improvements can be made to this list… Mayvbe mark cases with nearby notes opened already so these can be skipped for now? And mark cases where website link is available so these can be processed first?\n\nCases on \"entries from list of suspicious ones: \" list can get explanations why this values are treated as invalid. Maybe more.\n\n(helping here is useful as it allows to reduce number of not needed and pointless top-level shop values, on 2023-08-14 we had 11 215 distinct shop values, vast majority bogus, broken or not needed. Reviewing such lists also allows us to spot missing shop values, problems with documentation and presets. Repeated appearance of shop value may indicate that wiki or presets should be improved. Maybe iD translation is bad or requires additional aliases for easier search? Maybe OSM wiki would benefit from translating it to local language or being more clear?)\n\n(I can also generate such listing for other areas, let me know if someone is interested)"
