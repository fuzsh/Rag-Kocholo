General Questions\n\nA. 1. What is beneficial ownership information?\n\nBeneficial ownership information refers to identifying information about the individuals who directly or indirectly own or control a company.\n\n[Issued March 24, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nA. 2. Why do companies have to report beneficial ownership information to the U.S. Department of the Treasury?\n\nIn 2021, Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act on a bipartisan basis. This law creates a new beneficial ownership information reporting requirement as part of the U.S. government’s efforts to make it harder for bad actors to hide or benefit from their ill-gotten gains through shell companies or other opaque ownership structures.\n\n[Issued September 18, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nA. 3. Under the Corporate Transparency Act, who can access beneficial ownership information?\n\nFinCEN will permit Federal, State, local, and Tribal officials, as well as certain foreign officials who submit a request through a U.S. Federal government agency, to obtain beneficial ownership information for authorized activities related to national security, intelligence, and law enforcement. Financial institutions will have access to beneficial ownership information in certain circumstances, with the consent of the reporting company. Those financial institutions’ regulators will also have access to beneficial ownership information when they supervise the financial institutions.\n\nFinCEN published the rule that will govern access to and protection of beneficial ownership information on December 22, 2023. Beneficial ownership information reported to FinCEN will be stored in a secure, non-public database using rigorous information security methods and controls typically used in the Federal government to protect non-classified yet sensitive information systems at the highest security level. FinCEN will work closely with those authorized to access beneficial ownership information to ensure that they understand their roles and responsibilities in using the reported information only for authorized purposes and handling in a way that protects its security and confidentiality.\n\n[Updated January 4, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nA. 4. How will companies become aware of the BOI reporting requirements?\n\nA. 5. How is an Indian Tribe defined under the Corporate Transparency Act?\n\nB. Reporting Process\n\nB. 1. Should my company report beneficial ownership information now?\n\nB. 2. When do I need to report my company’s beneficial ownership information to FinCEN?\n\nA reporting company created or registered to do business before January 1, 2024, will have until January 1, 2025 to file its initial beneficial ownership information report.\n\nA reporting company created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, will have 90 calendar days after receiving notice of the company’s creation or registration to file its initial BOI report. This 90-calendar day deadline runs from the time the company receives actual notice that its creation or registration is effective, or after a secretary of state or similar office first provides public notice of its creation or registration, whichever is earlier.\n\nReporting companies created or registered on or after January 1, 2025, will have 30 calendar days from actual or public notice that the company’s creation or registration is effective to file their initial BOI reports with FinCEN.\n\n[Updated December 1, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nB. 3. When will FinCEN accept beneficial ownership information reports?\n\nFinCEN will begin accepting beneficial ownership information reports on January 1, 2024. Beneficial ownership information reports will not be accepted before then.\n\n[Issued March 24, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nB. 4. Will there be a fee for submitting a beneficial ownership information report to FinCEN?\n\nNo. There is no fee for submitting your beneficial ownership information report to FinCEN.\n\n[Updated January 4, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nB. 5. How will I report my company’s beneficial ownership information?\n\nIf you are required to report your company’s beneficial ownership information to FinCEN, you will do so electronically through a secure filing system available via FinCEN’s BOI E-Filing website (https://boiefiling.fincen.gov).\n\n[Updated January 4, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nB. 6. Where can I find the form to report?\n\nAccess the form by going to FinCEN’s BOI E-Filing website (https://boiefiling.fincen.gov) and select “File BOIR.”\n\n[Updated January 4, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nB. 7. Is a reporting company required to use an attorney or a certified public accountant (CPA) to submit beneficial ownership information to FinCEN?\n\nB. 8. Who can file a BOI report on behalf of a reporting company, and what information will be collected on filers?\n\nAnyone whom the reporting company authorizes to act on its behalf—such as an employee, owner, or third-party service provider—may file a BOI report on the reporting company’s behalf. When submitting the BOI report, individual filers should be prepared to provide basic contact information about themselves, including their name and email address or phone number.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nC. Reporting Company\n\nC. 1. What companies will be required to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN?\n\nC. 2. Are some companies exempt from the reporting requirement?\n\nC. 3. Are certain corporate entities, such as statutory trusts, business trusts, or foundations, reporting companies?\n\nC. 4. Is a trust considered a reporting company if it registers with a court of law for the purpose of establishing the court’s jurisdiction over any disputes involving the trust?\n\nNo. The registration of a trust with a court of law merely to establish the court’s jurisdiction over any disputes involving the trust does not make the trust a reporting company.\n\n[Issued November 16, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nC. 5. Does the activity or revenue of a company determine whether it is a reporting company?\n\nC. 6. Is a sole proprietorship a reporting company?\n\nNo, unless a sole proprietorship was created (or, if a foreign sole proprietorship, registered to do business) in the United States by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office. An entity is a reporting company only if it was created (or, if a foreign company, registered to do business) in the United States by filing such a document. Filing a document with a government agency to obtain (1) an IRS employer identification number, (2) a fictitious business name, or (3) a professional or occupational license does not create a new entity, and therefore does not make a sole proprietorship filing such a document a reporting company.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nC. 7. Can a company created or registered in a U.S. territory be considered a reporting company?\n\nYes. In addition to companies in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, a company that is created or registered to do business by the filing of a document with a U.S. territory’s secretary of state or similar office, and that does not qualify for any exemptions to the reporting requirements, is required to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. U.S. territories are the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n[Issued January 12, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nC. 8. Do the BOI reporting requirements apply to S-Corporations?\n\nYes. A corporation treated as a pass-through entity under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (an “S Corporation” or “S-Corp”) that qualifies as a reporting company—i.e., that is created or registered to do business by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or similar office, and does not qualify for any of the exemptions to the reporting requirements—must comply with the reporting requirements. The S-Corp’s pass-through structure for tax purposes does not affect its BOI reporting obligations. In particular, pass-through treatment under Subchapter S does not qualify an S-Corp as a “tax-exempt entity” under FinCEN BOI reporting regulations.\n\n[Issued April 18, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nC. 9. If a domestic corporation or limited liability company is not created by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or similar office, is it a reporting company?\n\nC. 10. Are homeowners associations reporting companies?\n\nC. 11. Are entities formed under Tribal law required to report beneficial ownership information?\n\nC. 12. Do beneficial ownership information reporting requirements apply to companies created or registered before the Corporate Transparency Act was enacted (January 1, 2021)?\n\nYes. Beneficial ownership information reporting requirements apply to all companies that qualify as “reporting companies” (see Question C.1), regardless of when they were created or registered. Companies are not required to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN if they are exempt (see Question C.2 and, generally, Section L) or ceased to exist as legal entities before January 1, 2024 (see Question C.13).\n\n[Issued July 8, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nC. 13. Is a company required to report its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN if the company ceased to exist before reporting requirements went into effect on January 1, 2024?\n\nA company is not required to report its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN if it ceased to exist as a legal entity before January 1, 2024, meaning that it entirely completed the process of formally and irrevocably dissolving. A company that ceased to exist as a legal entity before the beneficial ownership information reporting requirements became effective January 1, 2024, was never subject to the reporting requirements and thus is not required to report its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN.\n\nAlthough state or Tribal law may vary, a company typically completes the process of formally and irrevocably dissolving by, for example, filing dissolution paperwork with its jurisdiction of creation or registration, receiving written confirmation of dissolution, paying related taxes or fees, ceasing to conduct any business, and winding up its affairs (e.g., fully liquidating itself and closing all bank accounts).\n\nIf a reporting company (see Question C.1) continued to exist as a legal entity for any period of time on or after January 1, 2024 (i.e., did not entirely complete the process of formally and irrevocably dissolving before January 1, 2024), then it is required to report its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN, even if the company had wound up its affairs and ceased conducting business before January 1, 2024.\n\nSimilarly, if a reporting company was created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, and subsequently ceased to exist, then it is required to report its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN—even if it ceased to exist before its initial beneficial ownership information report was due.\n\nFor specifics on how to determine when a company ceases to exist as a legal entity, consult the law of the jurisdiction in which the company was created or registered. A company that is administratively dissolved or suspended—because, for example, it failed to pay a filing fee or comply with certain jurisdictional requirements—generally does not cease to exist as a legal entity unless the dissolution or suspension becomes permanent.\n\n[Issued July 8, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nC. 14. If a reporting company created or registered in 2024 or later winds up its affairs and ceases to exist before its initial BOI report is due to FinCEN, is the company still required to submit that initial report?\n\nYes. Reporting companies created or registered in 2024 must report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN within 90 days of receiving actual or public notice of creation or registration. Reporting companies created or registered in 2025 or later must report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN within 30 days of receiving actual or public notice of creation or registration. These obligations remain applicable to reporting companies that cease to exist as legal entities—meaning wound up their affairs, ceased conducting business, and entirely completed the process of formally and irrevocably dissolving—before their initial beneficial ownership reports are due. If a reporting company files an initial beneficial ownership information report and then ceases to exist, then there is no requirement for the reporting company to file an additional report with FinCEN noting that the company has ceased to exist.\n\n[Issued July 8, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nD.

In many cases, company applicants may work for a business formation service or law firm.\n\nAn accountant or lawyer may be a company applicant if they directly filed the document that created or registered the reporting company. If more than one person is involved in the filing of the creation or registration document, an accountant or lawyer may be a company applicant if they are primarily responsible for directing or controlling the filing.\n\nFor example, an attorney at a law firm that offers business formation services may be primarily responsible for overseeing preparation and filing of a reporting company’s incorporation documents. A paralegal at the law firm may directly file the incorporation documents at the attorney’s request. Under those circumstances, the attorney and the paralegal are both company applicants for the reporting company.\n\n[Issued September 18, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nE. 4. Can a company applicant be removed from a BOI report if the company applicant no longer has a relationship with the reporting company?\n\nNo. A company applicant may not be removed from a BOI report even if the company applicant no longer has a relationship with the reporting company. A reporting company created on or after January 1, 2024, is required to report company applicant information in its initial BOI report, but is not required to file an updated BOI report if information about a company applicant changes.\n\n[Issued November 16, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nE. 5. The company applicants of a reporting company include the individual “primarily responsible for directing the filing of the creation or registration document.” What makes an individual “primarily responsible” for directing such a filing?\n\nE. 6. Is a third-party courier or delivery service employee who only delivers documents that create or register a reporting company a company applicant?\n\nE. 7. If an individual used an automated incorporation service, such as through a website or online platform, to file the creation or registration document for a reporting company, who is the company applicant?\n\nIf a business formation service only provides software, online tools, or generally applicable written guidance that are used to file a creation or registration document for a reporting company, and employees of the business service are not directly involved in the filing of the document, the employees of such services are not company applicants. For example, an individual may prepare and self-file documents to create the individual’s own reporting company through an automated incorporation service. In this case, this reporting company reports only that individual as a company applicant.\n\n[Issued January 12, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nF. Reporting Requirements\n\nF. 1. Will a reporting company need to report any other information in addition to information about its beneficial owners?\n\nF. 2. What information will a reporting company have to report about itself?\n\nF. 3. What information will a reporting company have to report about its beneficial owners?\n\nF. 4. What information will a reporting company have to report about its company applicants?\n\nF. 5. What are acceptable forms of identification that will meet the reporting requirement?\n\nF. 6.

Can a reporting company report a P.O. box as its current address?\n\nF. 9. Have I met FinCEN’s BOI reporting obligation if I filed a form or report that provides beneficial ownership information to a state office, a financial institution, or the IRS?\n\nNo. Reporting companies must report beneficial ownership information directly to FinCEN. Congress enacted a law, the Corporate Transparency Act, that requires the reporting of beneficial ownership information directly to FinCEN. State or local governments, financial institutions, and other federal agencies, such as the IRS, may separately require entities to report certain beneficial ownership information. However, by law, those requirements are not a substitute for reporting beneficial ownership information to FinCEN.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nF. 10. If a beneficial owner or company applicant’s acceptable identification document does not include a photograph for religious reasons, will FinCEN accept the identification document without the photograph?\n\nYes. If a beneficial owner or company applicant’s identification document does not include a photograph for religious reasons, the reporting company may nonetheless submit an image of that identification document when submitting its report, as long as the identification document is one of the types of identification accepted by FinCEN, such as a non-expired State-issued identification document. Please see Question F.5 for a list of acceptable identification documents.\n\n[Issued January 12, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nF. 11. What residential address should be reported if a reporting company is required to a report an individual’s residential address, but that individual does not have a permanent residential residence?\n\nF. 12. What address should a reporting company report if it lacks a principal place of business in the United States?\n\nIf a reporting company does not have a principal place of business in the United States, then the company must report to FinCEN as its address the primary location in the United States where it conducts business.\n\nIf a reporting company has no principal place of business in the United States and conducts business at more than one location within the United States, then the reporting company may report as its primary location the address of any of those locations where the reporting company receives important correspondence.\n\nIf a reporting company has no principal place of business in the United States and does not conduct business functions at any location in the United States, then its primary location is the address in the United States of the person that the reporting company, under State or other applicable law, has designated to accept service of legal process on its behalf. In some jurisdictions, this person is referred to as the reporting company’s registered agent, or the address is referred to as the registered office. Such a reporting company should report this address to FinCEN as its address.\n\n[Issued April 18, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nF. 13.

When do I have to file an initial beneficial ownership information report with FinCEN?\n\nG. 2. Can a parent company file a single BOI report on behalf of its group of companies?\n\nNo. Any company that meets the definition of a reporting company and is not exempt is required to file its own BOI report.\n\n[Issued September 29, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nG. 3. How can I obtain a tax identification number for a new company quickly so that I can file an initial beneficial ownership information report on time?\n\nG. 4. Should an initial BOI report include historical beneficial owners of a reporting company, or only beneficial owners as of the time of filing?\n\nG. 5. How does a company created or registered after January 1, 2024, determine its date of creation or registration?\n\nThe date of creation or registration for a reporting company is the earlier of the date on which: (1) the reporting company receives actual notice that its creation (or registration) has become effective; or (2) a secretary of state or similar office first provides public notice, such as through a publicly accessible registry, that the domestic reporting company has been created or the foreign reporting company has been registered.\n\nFinCEN recognizes that there are varying state filing practices. In certain states, automated systems provide notice of creation or registration to newly created or registered companies. In other states, no actual notice of creation or registration is provided, and newly created companies receive notice through the public posting of state records. FinCEN believes that individuals who create or register reporting companies will likely stay apprised of creation or registration notices or publications, given those individuals’ interest in establishing an operating business or engaging in the activity for which the reporting company is created.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nG. 6. A company that was created or registered before January 1, 2024, and was exempt from the BOI reporting requirements loses its exempt status between January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025. How long does the reporting company have to file its initial BOI report?\n\nNormally, a company that loses its exempt status must file a BOI report with FinCEN within 30 calendar days after the date that it no longer meets the criteria for any exemption. A reporting company created or registered to do business before January 1, 2024, however, has until January 1, 2025, to file its initial BOI report.\n\nFinCEN has determined that previously exempt entities that existed before 2024 and lose their exempt status in 2024 will receive the benefit of whichever of these two timeframes is longer: (1) the remaining days left in the one-year filing period for existing companies; or (2) the 30-calendar-day period for companies that lose their exempt status.\n\nThus, for example, if an existing reporting company ceases to be exempt on February 1, 2024, the company will have until January 1, 2025, to file its initial BOI report. If the company ceases to be exempt on December 15, 2024, the company will have until January 14, 2025, to file its initial BOI report.\n\n[Issued April 18, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nH.

Is an updated BOI report required when the type of ownership interest a beneficial owner has in a reporting company changes?\n\nH. 4. If a reporting company needs to update one piece of information on a BOI report, such as its legal name, does the reporting company have to fill out an entire new BOI report?\n\nUpdated BOI reports will require all fields to be submitted, including the updated pieces of information. For example, if a reporting company changes its legal name, the reporting company will need to file an updated BOI report to include the new legal name and the previously reported, unchanged information about the company, its beneficial owners, and, if required, its company applicants.\n\nA reporting company that filed its prior BOI report using the fillable PDF version may update its saved copy and resubmit to FinCEN. If a reporting company used FinCEN’s web-based application to submit the previous BOI report, it will need to submit a new report in its entirety by either accessing FinCEN’s web-based application to complete and file the BOI report, or by using the PDF option to complete the BOI report and upload to the BOI e-Filing application.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nH. 5. Can a filer submit a late updated BOI report?\n\nAn updated BOI report can be submitted to FinCEN at any time. However, the reporting company is responsible for ensuring that updates are filed within 30 days of a change occurring. If a reporting company has engaged a third-party service provider to file BOI reports and updates on its behalf, then it should communicate any changes to its beneficial ownership information to the third-party service provider with enough time to meet the 30-day deadline.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nH. 6. If a reporting company last filed a “newly exempt entity” BOI report but subsequently loses its exempt status, what should it do?\n\nA reporting company should file an updated BOI report with FinCEN with the company’s current beneficial ownership information when it determines it no longer qualifies for an exemption.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nI.

What happens if a reporting company does not report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN or fails to update or correct the information within the required timeframe?\n\nK. 2. What penalties do individuals face for violating BOI reporting requirements?\n\nAs specified in the Corporate Transparency Act, a person who willfully violates the BOI reporting requirements may be subject to civil penalties of up to $500 for each day that the violation continues. However, this civil penalty amount is adjusted annually for inflation. As of the time of publication of this FAQ, this amount is $591.\n\nA person who willfully violates the BOI reporting requirements may also be subject to criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000. Potential violations include willfully failing to file a beneficial ownership information report, willfully filing false beneficial ownership information, or willfully failing to correct or update previously reported beneficial ownership information.\n\n[Updated April 18, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nK. 3. Who can be held liable for violating BOI reporting requirements?\n\nK. 4. Is a reporting company responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information that it reports to FinCEN, even if the reporting company obtains that information from another party?\n\nYes. It is the responsibility of the reporting company to identify its beneficial owners and company applicants, and to report those individuals to FinCEN. At the time the filing is made, each reporting company is required to certify that its report or application is true, correct, and complete. Accordingly, FinCEN expects that reporting companies will take care to verify the information they receive from their beneficial owners and company applicants before reporting it to FinCEN.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nK. 5. What should a reporting company do if a beneficial owner or company applicant withholds information?\n\nWhile FinCEN recognizes that much of the information required to be reported about beneficial owners and company applicants will be provided to reporting companies by those individuals, reporting companies are responsible for ensuring that they submit complete and accurate beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. Starting January 1, 2024, reporting companies will have a legal requirement to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN.\n\nExisting reporting companies should engage with their beneficial owners to advise them of this requirement, obtain required information, and revise or consider putting in place mechanisms to ensure that beneficial owners will keep reporting companies apprised of changes in reported information, if necessary. Beneficial owners and company applicants should also be aware that they may face penalties if they willfully cause a reporting company to fail to report complete or updated beneficial ownership information.\n\nPersons considering creating or registering legal entities that will be reporting companies should take steps to ensure that they have access to the beneficial ownership information required to be reported to FinCEN, and that they have mechanisms in place to ensure that the reporting company is kept apprised of changes in that information.\n\n[Issued December 12, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nL.

If I own a group of related companies, can I consolidate employees across those companies to meet the criteria of a large operating company exemption from the reporting company definition?\n\nL. 5. How does a company report to FinCEN that the company is exempt?\n\nA company does not need to report to FinCEN that it is exempt from the BOI reporting requirements if it has always been exempt.\n\nIf a company filed a BOI report and later qualifies for an exemption, that company should file an updated BOI report to indicate that it is newly exempt from the reporting requirements. Updated BOI reports are filed electronically though the secure filing system. An updated BOI report for a newly exempt entity will only require that the entity: (1) identify itself; and (2) check a box noting its newly exempt status.\n\n[Issued November 16, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nL. 6. Does a subsidiary whose ownership interests are partially controlled by an exempt entity qualify for the subsidiary exemption?\n\nNo. If an exempt entity controls some but not all of the ownership interests of the subsidiary, the subsidiary does not qualify. To qualify, a subsidiary’s ownership interests must be fully, 100 percent owned or controlled by an exempt entity.\n\nA subsidiary whose ownership interests are controlled or wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by certain exempt entities is exempt from the BOI reporting requirements. In this context, control of ownership interests means that the exempt entity entirely controls all of the ownership interests in the reporting company, in the same way that an exempt entity must wholly own all of a subsidiary’s ownership interests for the exemption to apply.\n\n[Issued January 12, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nL. 7. If the size of a reporting company fluctuates above and below one of the thresholds for the large operating company exemption, does the reporting company need to file a BOI report?\n\nYes. The company will need to file a BOI report if it otherwise meets the definition of a reporting company and does not meet the criteria for the large operating company exemption (or any other exemption). If the company files a BOI report and then becomes exempt as a large operating company, the company should file a “newly exempt entity” BOI report with FinCEN noting that the company is now exempt. If at a later date the company no longer meets the criteria for the large operating company exemption or any other exemption, the reporting company should file an updated BOI report with FinCEN. Updated reports should be submitted to FinCEN within 30 calendar days of the occurrence of the change.\n\nTo qualify for the large operating company exemption, an entity must have more than 20 full-time employees in the United States, must have filed a Federal income tax or information return in the United States in the previous year demonstrating more than $5,000,000 in gross receipts or sales, and must have an operating presence at a physical office in the United States.\n\n[Issued April 18, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nL. 8.

Such exempt regulated public utilities include a corporation engaged in the furnishing or sale of telephone or telegraph services if the rates for such furnishing or sale meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 7701(a)(33)(A), as specified in 26 U.S.C. 7701(a)(33)(D).\n\n[Issued June 10, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nL. 9.

How can I use a FinCEN identifier?\n\nWhen a beneficial owner or company applicant has obtained a FinCEN identifier, reporting companies may report the FinCEN identifier of that individual in the place of that individual’s otherwise required personal information on a beneficial ownership information report.\n\nA reporting company may report another entity’s FinCEN identifier and full legal name in place of information about its beneficial owners when three conditions are met: (1) the other entity obtains a FinCEN identifier and provides it to the reporting company; (2) the beneficial owners hold interests in the reporting company through ownership interests in the other entity; and (3) the beneficial owners of the reporting company and the other entity are the exact same individuals.\n\n[Updated January 12, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nM. 3. How do I request a FinCEN identifier?\n\nIndividuals may request a FinCEN identifier starting January 1, 2024, by completing an electronic web form at https://fincenid.fincen.gov. Individuals will need to provide their full legal name, date of birth, address, unique identifying number and issuing jurisdiction from an acceptable identification document, and an image of the identification document. After an individual submits this information, they will immediately receive a unique FinCEN identifier.\n\nReporting companies may request a FinCEN identifier by checking a box on the beneficial ownership information report upon submission. After the reporting company submits the report, the company will immediately receive a unique FinCEN identifier. If a reporting company wishes to request a FinCEN identifier after submitting its initial beneficial ownership report, it may submit an updated beneficial ownership information report requesting a FinCEN identifier, even if the company does not otherwise need to update its information.\n\n[Updated January 4, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nM. 4.

Is there any way to deactivate an individual’s FinCEN identifier that is no longer in use so that the individual no longer has to update the information associated with it?\n\nFinCEN is actively assessing options to allow individuals to deactivate a FinCEN identifier so that they do not need to update the underlying personal information on an ongoing basis. FinCEN will provide additional guidance on this functionality upon completion of that process.\n\n[Issued September 29, 2023]\n\nBack to top\n\nM. 7. Who can request a FinCEN identifier on behalf of an individual?\n\nN. Third-Party Service Providers\n\nN. 1. Can a third-party service provider assist reporting companies by submitting required information to FinCEN on their behalf?\n\nYes. Reporting companies may use third-party service providers to submit beneficial ownership information reports. Third-party service providers will have the ability to submit the reports via FinCEN’s BOI E-Filing website or an Application Programming Interface (API). To request the API technical specifications, use FinCEN’s contact form (https://www.fincen.gov/contact). Please do the following when submitting your inquiry: (1) select the topic associated with Beneficial Ownership (BO) / Corporate Transparency Act (CTA); (2) select the subject associated with API requests; (3) in the message body, indicate the nature of your API-related inquiry (e.g., “I would like to review the API technical specifications,” “I would like to request access to the API,” etc.).\n\n[Updated January 4, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nN. 2.

A State, local, or Tribal law enforcement agency, however, can only request beneficial ownership information from FinCEN if authorized by a “court of competent jurisdiction” to seek the information in a criminal or civil investigation. The state, local, or Tribal law enforcement agency also must meet certain other access requirements, including entering into a memorandum of understanding with FinCEN that describes how the agency will protect the security and confidentiality of the information.\n\nAdditionally, state regulatory agencies that supervise financial institutions for compliance with customer due diligence requirements may also request beneficial ownership information from FinCEN to conduct such supervision. Like other domestic government agencies, to receive beneficial ownership information from FinCEN, state regulatory agencies must also enter into a memorandum of understanding with FinCEN that describes how the agency will protect the security and confidentiality of the information.\n\n[Issued April 18, 2024]\n\nBack to top\n\nO. 4.
