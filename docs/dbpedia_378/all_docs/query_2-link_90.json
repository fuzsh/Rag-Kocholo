        "text": "Limes Taiwan is a de facto independent State, officially named Republic of China. Why not de jure? Are you going to declare independence in the foreseeable future, thus bridging the gap between reality and diplomatic fiction?Wu Taiwan does not need to declare independence again as we are an independent, sovereign country. We have our own government and military, issue our own passports, popularly elect our own president, and enjoy diplomatic ties with 15 other nations. China has never ruled Taiwan; however, the Chinese leadership has unilaterally included Taiwan in its “Chinese dream” scheme. It continues to suppress our international space and engage in military intimidation and rhetorical assaults against us, unilaterally disrupting the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is China that is divorced from reality. Taiwan promotes steadfast diplomacy, which is based on mutual assistance for mutual benefit; China employs wolf-warrior diplomacy, which instigates conflict. We thank the international community for supporting Taiwan, in particular the more than 60 members of the European Parliament who spoke out in favor of our developing cooperative ties with Lithuania. Meanwhile, the Quad Summit, EU-US Summit, and G7 Summit all stressed the importance of stability in the Taiwan Strait. We are pleased that the EU Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs voted overwhelmingly to approve the EU-Taiwan Relations and Cooperation report and related amendments, showing that the solid ties between Taiwan and the EU are headed for a new milestone. Taiwan is a force for stability and good in the world and will continue to defend such core values as democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. Taiwan will continue to seek to deepen exchanges with like-minded partners such as Italy and the EU in an effort to bolster the global democratic camp.Limes Former President Ma Ying-jeou stated in 2008 that the R.O.C. “definitely is an independent sovereign State, and mainland China is also part of the territory of the R.O.C.” Do you agree?Wu Taiwan is a democratic country that allows differing political opinions to coexist. The Constitution protects freedom of speech. While the people of Taiwan have differing views on some issues, they all love this land. The Republic of China on Taiwan is an independent, sovereign country. It has never been a part of the People’s Republic of China and never shall be. The people of Taiwan are the only ones with the right to determine Taiwan’s future and how it develops. Taiwan’s people have a strong consensus and determination to oppose bullying by China and the so-called “one country, two systems” framework. Last year, in a clear sign to both China and the world, the people of Taiwan reelected President Tsai with a historically high 8.17 million ballots.Limes The Republic of China is actually bigger than the PRC. Could you provide an official map of your State? Do you consider the territories formerly part of the original R.O.C. which now belong to other States (e.g., Russia and the PRC) as illegally occupied?Wu National identity is the shared identity of people living in a particular place. A sovereign government rules based on this cohesion. Presently, the nation on the island of Taiwan is called the Republic of China (Taiwan). It was also known as Formosa, a name given it by Portuguese sailors in the 16th century. Territory, conceptually, can change with history. Today’s Italy, for example, is not the Italy of past ages. The nation recognized by the people who live in your country is the Italy of today. On July 29 this year, the US House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill that includes a Taiwan-friendly amendment that prohibits the expenditure of funds to create, procure, or display any map that depicts Taiwan as part of the People’s Republic of China. Sponsor Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-WI) pointed out that the amendment cannot change the “one China” policy, but can at least require honest maps that stop perpetuating the “one China” lie.Limes Why are you emphasizing the logo Taiwan wherever possible, including your passports? Why are you de-emphasizing the R.O.C. label? Is it going to disappear?Wu Our country is called the Republic of China. We are not, as you have suggested, de-emphasizing the R.O.C. As concerns the new version of our passport, our passport has often been mistaken for that of the PRC, severely affecting the right to travel of our nationals, in particular since the COVID-19 pandemic began. To ensure the security and convenience of our nationals traveling abroad, and to reduce the risk of customs agencies of other countries being misled, we enhanced the word Taiwan on our new passports. However, the original structure and elements, including Republic of China, remain unchanged. Polls on political attitudes conducted by the Election Study Center at National Chengchi University show that the percentage of respondents identifying as Taiwanese has gone from 17.6 in 1992 to 63.3 in 2021. This shows that Taiwan is already the consensus form of identification of most of our citizens. Additionally, the international visibility of Taiwan has increased. A growing number of friends in the international community understand the clear distinction between Taiwan and China. When Japanese media broadcast the Tokyo Olympics, they called us Taiwan. At the Venice Biennale of Architecture, Taiwan is hosting a collateral event. These events show that the word Taiwan already enjoys widespread recognition and is the best way friends around the world can tell the difference between us and China.Limes How do you evaluate your relations with Italy?Wu In 1991, Taiwan established the Taipei Representative Office in Italy. Italy subsequently established the Italian Economic, Trade and Cultural Promotion Office in Taipei in 1994. The offices jointly promote and strengthen relations between Taiwan and Italy. Achievements made by the two sides over the last 30 years include an air services agreement in 1995, a driver’s license reciprocity policy in 2003, and an agreement to eliminate double taxation in 2016. In recent years, Taiwan-Italy relations have continued to advance. There is close cooperation in economics and trade, technology, energy, and other fields. Bilateral trade totaled US$4.27 billion last year. Italy became Taiwan’s third-largest trading partner in Europe (after Germany and the Netherlands). Recently, bilateral trade and investment and various other forms of cooperation have increased. Models of cooperation between Taiwan and Italy include Taiwan Cement Corporation’s procurement of Engie EPS for €132 million and the joint venture between Foxconn and Stellantis. In addition, Italy was hard hit by COVID-19 early last year. The country was one of the worst affected by the pandemic in Europe. In the first instance, Taiwan’s government and civil society donated 500,000 medical masks, 30 ventilators, and 62 crates of medical resources to Italy to help frontline medical workers fight the pandemic. In a nationally broadcast press conference concerning the pandemic on April 27 of the same year, Italy’s Head of Civil Protection Angelo Borrelli publicly thanked Taiwan for the donation of medical resources to Italy and put Taiwan on the top of the thank-you list, showing that Taiwan can help and demonstrating the spirit of mutual friendship in the slogan Italy and Taiwan: healthy, together. Each year, various government agencies in Taiwan offer scholarships to Italian students to undertake further education in specialist degree subjects and Chinese language studies in Taiwan. Last year, there were 239 Italian students in Taiwan. The number of Taiwanese students studying in Italy was 212. Cultural exchanges between Taiwan and Italy are also close. Artistic and cultural groups from Taiwan are regularly invited to participate in the annual Venice Film Festival and biennial architecture and art exhibitions. In recent years, the Italian Parliament has given substantial support to Taiwan’s international participation. For example, in the first half of May this year, nearly 60 Italian parliamentarians from various political parties signed a letter from the European Formosa Club to the WHO director-general in support of Taiwan’s participation in the international organization. The petition acknowledged the selfless contributions Taiwan makes to the international community. Regarding the harassment and threats that Taiwan faces from Chinese military planes as well as China’s suppression of Taiwan internationally, for the first time Italy responded in the communiqués of this year’s G7 Foreign and Development Ministers’ Meeting and G7 Summit, which underscored the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The statements embodied the universal value of defending democracy and peace shared by Taiwan and Italy. The government of Taiwan welcomes the support of Italy’s Parliament and government agencies for Taiwan and will continue to cooperate with Italy and other like-minded countries to deepen bilateral ties.Limes Our review is based in Rome, where you have an Embassy to the Holy See and a Representative Office to the Italian Republic. How come? How do you evaluate the agreement between the PRC and the Holy See?Wu The Republic of China (Taiwan) established diplomatic relations with the Holy See in July 1942. In 1943, a legation was established in Rome, which was upgraded to an embassy in June 1959. The Taipei Representative Office in Italy was officially opened and started providing public services on April 15, 1991. After the Representative Office in Italy was established, the Embassy to the Holy See no longer had to conduct services for Italy. This enabled Taiwan, like other nations, to have two missions in Rome, in accordance with the fundamental principle that missions to the Holy See and Italy have different jurisdictions. Whatever talks or agreements it has with China, the Holy See holds to higher religious objectives. These are to assert that the Pope has final say in the appointment of Chinese bishops and to advance religious freedom in China so that Chinese Catholics can proceed with normal practice of their faith. The Holy See signed a provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops with China in September 2018. In October 2020, the agreement was renewed for two years. Six Chinese bishops have been appointed in the last three years. This reestablished the ultimate authority of the Pope to appoint Chinese bishops. Unfortunately, according to media reports, religious freedom in China has deteriorated during this period and Catholics have suffered harsher suppression. We believe that this is why the Pope, in an interview with the Spanish Catholic radio network COPE on September 1, said, “China is not easy” and “you can be deceived in dialogue.” We hope China will genuinely respect religious freedom and universal values.Limes Is Taiwan culturally part of the Chinese world? If not, how would you define Taiwan’s identity?Wu Taiwan has elements of Chinese culture. This a common cultural and ancestral characteristic that Taiwan shares with the Chinese communities in Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia as well as the United States and Canada in North America. However, Taiwan is definitely not part of the People’s Republic of China. The PRC has never governed Taiwan for even one day. Taiwan’s political system of freedom and democratic rule stands in stark contrast to China’s communist totalitarian autocracy. A fundamental divide exists between the two sides’ systems of governance, respect for people’s freedoms, and social diversity. In another respect, because Taiwan is located at a geographic hub between the Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean, it has simultaneously absorbed diverse elements of oceanic and continental culture. The population is a mixture of indigenous peoples, early settlers from Fujian and Guangdong, later migrants to Taiwan in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil war, and new immigrants. This has led to the development of an ethnically diverse and inclusive Taiwanese culture. Taiwan respects democracy, human rights, and the rule of law and embraces universal mainstream values. It has become a success story for political democracy and economic prosperity, which also proves that the democratic system and Chinese culture can coexist, destroying the Chinese government’s lie that “democracy is not suitable for China.” To sum up the above, Taiwanese culture incorporates diversity. It not only conforms to world trends but has unique advantages that make it a model for ethnic Chinese everywhere. Today, Taiwan’s 23 million people are not only a cultural community but a community of people sharing a collective fate. Everyone strives for the sustainable development and prosperity of Taiwan and together safeguards freedom and democracy.Limes Is the R.O.C./Taiwan the “One China,” or is it the PRC? Or are there two Chinas? What does the 1992 consensus mean to you?Wu “One China” is a term used by the People’s Republic of China for political manipulation and as a pretext to legalize the occupation of Taiwan. For many years, China has erroneously cited the “one China” principle when declaring to the outside world that Taiwan is a part of the PRC. In reality, however, whether from the perspective of history, international law, or the cross-strait status quo, China has never ruled Taiwan for a single day and has no right to represent Taiwan in the international community. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has alluded to the 1992 consensus several times over the past two years, insisting that it is based on the “one China” principle and that it provides for “one country, two systems” to be promoted in Taiwan, with the aim of realizing the unification of China. This is unacceptable to us. Hong Kong serves as a perfect example in this regard. In 1984, China pledged to uphold “one country, two systems” in Hong Kong and ensure that its way of life would remain unchanged for 50 years. Last year, however, it pushed through the Hong Kong national security law, decimating freedom of speech and judicial independence in Hong Kong and allowing the wanton arrest of democracy activists and media professionals. Prodemocracy members of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council have since been ousted from their posts. Censorship and other restrictions have been imposed on the education and cultural domains. Democratic countries worldwide, including Italy, have strongly condemned these developments. The trampling of Hong Kong’s democratic system has allowed the Taiwanese people to see the true face of “one country, two systems” as well as the untrustworthiness and reckless betrayal of promises by communist China’s authoritarian regime. A survey conducted by Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council in July this year shows that 89.2 percent of Taiwanese people are opposed to the “one country, two systems” framework and 76.1 percent are against the “one China” principle and the 1992 consensus. These findings indicate that the greatest consensus among the Taiwanese people, regardless of party affiliation or stance, is to absolutely reject China’s authoritarian rule.Limes What would your policy toward Taiwan be if you were a PRC leader?Wu I cannot hypothesize or speak for the PRC with regard to its policy toward Taiwan. For a responsible head of state in a mature democracy, the top consideration should be the welfare of the people, enduring peace in the nation, and stability in the region, rather than personal political ambitions or a party’s permanent hold on power to the detriment of people’s well-being and the national interest. Today the Chinese leader holds centralized power and there is zero tolerance for criticism and challenges. He has not only destroyed democracy and freedom in Hong Kong and suppressed human rights in Xinjiang, but has also invested considerable resources into provocative maneuvers against neighboring countries through gray-zone tactics and wolf-warrior diplomacy. This does not serve the people’s interests; it only serves to tarnish China’s image. In recent years, China has willfully indulged in military aggression and continuous expansionism. Its military budget has multiplied tenfold over the past 25 years. It has relentlessly increased its controversial actions, including sending military aircraft on countless intrusions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone in an attempt to intimidate the Taiwanese people. China has also engaged in military expansionism in the East China Sea and South China Sea, instigated conflicts at its Indian border causing bloodshed, and undermined freedom of aviation and navigation in the South China Sea. All of these actions jeopardize regional peace and stability. They have caused neighboring countries such as Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia to feel threatened. The Chinese government should take a people-centric approach, respect democracy and freedom, and protect human rights. China should regard cross-strait relations in a pragmatic and reasonable manner. With due respect for the opinions of the Taiwanese people and on the basis of parity, it should open dialogue with Taiwan allowing the two sides to jointly promote cross-strait and regional peace. Furthermore, China should adhere to international norms and work with the international community to ensure regional and global stability and security. It should not challenge the international order and should transform the Chinese dream into a program to the benefit, not to the detriment, of people worldwide.Limes The US is increasingly shifting her approach in favor of Taiwan and against Beijing. Would you accept a US military base in Taiwan? Is there already some sort of American umbrella able to deter any Chinese aggression to your country?Wu China’s rise in recent years has created significant challenges and threats for the international community. Western democracies, led by the United States, have become highly vigilant with regard to China’s conduct and have come to realize the nature of its authoritarian expansionism. There is now strong and widespread agreement on the various challenges presented by China. Taiwan stands on the front line of the democratic community against this authoritarian regime, staunchly defending the values of democracy and freedom. Taiwan plays an indispensable role in safeguarding security and prosperity in the international community. Since taking office, the Biden administration has repeatedly affirmed its adherence to the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, confirming that its pledge to Taiwan is rock-solid. It has continued to convey serious concern over provocative actions taken by the Chinese government against Taiwan and rallied allies to express the high level of importance that they attach to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. It has also maintained the policy of normalizing defensive arms sales to Taiwan and announced in August its first arms sale to Taiwan, demonstrating that the US government remains consistent in its concern for Taiwan’s defense capability. Despite China’s increasing military intimidation and rhetorical assault, Taiwan will absolutely not bow to pressure. Taiwan firmly believes that only when it has a solid self-defense and a strong conviction in its capability can it ensure homeland security. Taiwan will surely and steadily enhance its self-defense capability to withstand China’s military threats and foster peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait."
