        "text": "Hello,\n\nApologies, I don’t speak Taiwanese so I hope I can write in English. I’m reaching out on behalf of Osmose.\n\nWe noticed that there are almost 800000 addresses in Taiwan where the addr:street value does not match with any nearby street name.\n\nFor example, the following address contains:\n\naddr:street=中華路一段376巷12弄\n\nwhile the nearby streets are called:\n\n中山路一段376巷\n\n中正路251巷\n\n中華路一段\n\n中正路\n\nSo none of the streets is called 中華路一段376巷12弄.\n\nIs this mismatch between addr:street and the name of the streets correct, or is this something that needs to be fixed in the OSM data? If it is correct that the street name and addr:street values differ, we will disable the corresponding check for Taiwan.\n\nThank you for your reply!\n\nHi,\n\nLocal mapper here👋\n\nThe checks that Osmose had done were correct. It’s the case that street data in Taiwan should be improved.\n\nThe addresses are imported by community from the data sources provided by local government, and the streets are manually mapped by human efforts. Hence, some small alleys are not recorded in OSM database yet.\n\nAs the example you provided, 中華路一段376巷12弄 looks like a private driveway which could be drawn in OSM but it is too small for the mappers to notice its existence. The address data can be a good reference for the mappers to highlight the missing.\n\nOur local mappers are working hard to improve the data completeness and the reported issues can be slowly fixed on Osmose."
