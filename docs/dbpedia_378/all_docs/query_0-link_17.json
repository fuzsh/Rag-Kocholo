And we did not have a sub-forum on the old OSM forum. We want to use a modern forum system like Discouse to be a place to have discussions in Taiwan National Languages like Taiwanese Mandarin, Taiwanese Hokkien, Taiwanese Hakka, and varies Formosan Languages.\n\nWe hope we could have a place to discuss mapping issue of Taiwan, or mass import project in Taiwan. Or general discussion of the big plan of OpenStreetMap Taiwan should do.\n\nWhy this new category is needed instead of being hosted as part of the existing ones?\n\nI think the existing one is not suitable for you need a separate account for each service. And the most popular platform in Taiwan is Facebook, but Facebook is dying in Taiwan, might have to find a place more OpenStreetMap-central to gather likemind.\n\nIs this a new space or it’s already existing in other platform(s)? Where?\n\nFacebook Group\n\nMailing List\n\nSlack\n\nTelegram OpenStreetMap Taiwan\n\nWhat the current volume of messages in the former platform (per week/per month)\n\nCombine different channels, probably 3 posts per week.\n\nIs there a transition plan for the old platform to this new one? (please link or describe)\n\nNo, probably cross-posting to different channels.\n\n(Optional) A link or list of the category specific guidelines\n\nWe will adapt OSM Etiquette Guidelines\n\nList the usernames of the category moderators\n\nMe, Supaplex of course\n\ns8321414：One of host of Monthy Taipei Wikipedia Meetup, also a active member of OpenStreetMap Taiwan, maintaining zh-tw version of WeeklyOSM and OpenStreetMap Taiwan Facebook Fan page\n\nassanges：osm.tw website maintainer, an active OpenStreetMap contributor, and a Wikidata contributor too.\n\nThanks for the request.\n\nWhile we wait for the proposed moderators to comment their acceptance, is it possible to edit and add a brief description on them and why they are proposed as moderators? This is something we are asking in every request for transparency.\n\nThanks so much, excited to see the Taiwan community here!\n\nCan I suggest you take this opportunity to update the Community Index page with this new category link?\n\nYou can do this by opening a new issue in their github repo, you might want to also provide update on existing channels for your community in case some have changed or are no longer used.\n\nCheers."
