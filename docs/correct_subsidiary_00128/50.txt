Oracle Corp. (ORCL), the world's largest enterprise software company, said Wednesday that it has agreed to buy identity theft and fraud prevention software maker Bharosa Inc.

Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close in August, were not disclosed.

Santa Clara, Calif.-based Bharosa has more than 25 million users.

Redwood Shores, California-based Oracle said it will be able to provide the next generation of access management to customers and the market by adding some of the real-time fraud prevention capabilities of Bharosa's Tracker and Authenticator software to Oracle's existing web single sign-on and web-based authorization solutions.

Bharosa's Tracker and Authenticator software will continue to be available on a standalone basis with integrations for Oracle and non-Oracle environments as well as integrated with Oracle Identity Management.

Oracle shares are currently trading at $20.28, down 10 cents.
