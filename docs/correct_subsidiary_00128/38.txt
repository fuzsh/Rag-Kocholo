REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. -- Oracle today announced that it has agreed to acquire Bharosa, Inc., a leading provider of software that helps combat online identity theft and fraud. Strong authentication and fraud detection are increasingly critical components of identity management deployments and are seeing rapid adoption. Driven by regulatory mandates such as FFIEC, PCI, and HIPAA, organizations are under pressure to reduce fraud and provide higher levels of assurance of users' identities and their usage intent. By adding some of the leading real-time fraud prevention capabilities of Bharosa's Tracker and Authenticator software to Oracle's existing web single sign-on and web-based authorization solutions, Oracle will uniquely provide the next generation of access management to customers and the market.

"Oracle Identity Management ranks among the industry's top solutions and we plan to continue rapidly expanding our security business to provide our customers with the most comprehensive, leading information protection solutions available," said Hasan Rizvi, vice president, Identity Management and Security Products, Oracle. "We expect Oracle and Bharosa, together, to provide enterprises with a comprehensive identity management solution that integrates proactive, real-time fraud prevention."
