        "text": "28.3.2 Providing CSR Access to Particular Organizations\n\nTo provide access to a particular organization to the CSR administrative user, the CSR administrative user needs to belong to that organization.\n\nAt any point, a CSR or CSR Manager can be servicing more than one organization. He will be able to see all the cases of the organizations he is assigned to.\n\nWhen CSRs are changed or added to an organization, the setting takes effect at the next login and not for the current login.\n\nIf you are migrating from a previous release, you can continue to operate as you have been without any change because by default, multitenancy access control is off. If you want multitenancy access control, you must set it up. Once you have set up multitenancy, access control is applied. For example, if a CSR belonged to Organization 1 in a previous release, he will still have access to all the cases in Organization 1 after access control is applied. If there is no access control previously, the CSR will have access to all cases. Now if multitenancy access control is set up, he can only see cases from Organization 1. If the CSR was working on five cases from five organizations before the upgrade to 11g, now he will not have access to them.\n\n28.3.2.1 Using WebLogic\n\nTo achieve this, an organization with the exact same name as the Organization ID must exist and then that organization should be assigned to the CSR administrative user:\n\nLog in to the WebLogic Administration Console as a WebLogic user:\n\nhttp://hostname:port/console\n\nWhere hostname is the hostname of the Administration Server and port is the address of the port on which the Administration Server is listening for requests (7001 by default).\n\nCreate a group/organization using WebLogic Security Realms that exactly match the name of the Organization ID. For example, Bank1.\n\nAssign, as necessary/applicable, this group/organization to the CSR and CSR Manager, as necessary.\n\nRefer to the \"Add users to groups\" section in the Oracle Fusion Middleware Oracle WebLogic Server Administration Console Online Help 11g.\n\nTo move a user from working on one organization to another:\n\nLog in to the WebLogic Administration Console as a WebLogic user:\n\nhttp://hostname:port/console\n\nWhere hostname is the hostname of the Administration Server and port is the address of the port on which the Administration Server is listening for requests (7001 by default).\n\nIn the Settings for Realm Name page, navigate to Users and Groups, and then Users in Security Realms.\n\nChange the user membership of the group/organization, by removing the group/organization from the CSR and CSR Manager, and adding the new group/organization to the CSR and CSR Manager.\n\nThe changes are effective from the next login for the CSR and CSR Managers.\n\nRefer to the \"Modify users\" section in the Oracle Fusion Middleware Oracle WebLogic Server Administration Console Online Help 11g.\n\n28.3.2.2 Adding Users and Groups in the LDAP Store\n\nIf you want to take care of user and group creation in the external LDAP store, see Section 2.5.1, \"Creating OAAM Administrative Roles and User in an External LDAP Store.\"\n\n28.5.1 CSR and CSR Manager Access Controls\n\nSecond Bank has deployed OAAM to secure both the consumer banking application and the business banking application. Their CSRs are broken up into two separate organizations. One organization assists only consumer banking customers and the other assists only business banking customers. They need to have strict control over the customer data visible to each of these CSR organizations. Also, there is a organization of senior CSR managers that need to have access to data for all customers. When the consumer banking CSR searches, views, creates, edits cases they only see data related to consumer banking customers. Likewise the business banking CSRs only see data for business banking customers. Neither is even aware that OAAM is doing this pre-filtering of data. The CSR managers can see data related to both consumer and business banking customer activity and they can perform all case flow operations.\n\nActors: CSR and CSR Manager\n\nSetup: To set up the scenario:\n\nEnable multitenancy access control.\n\nCreate consumer and business organizations to assist the customers with the exact names as the Organization IDs.\n\nOne organization assists only consumer banking customers and the other assists only business banking customers. They need to have strict control over the customer data visible to each of these CSR organizations.\n\nCreate CSR1, CSR2, and CSRSenior as administrators.\n\nAssign CSR1 to the consumer organization, CSR2 to the business organization, and CSRSenior to both consumer and business organizations.\n\nTo provide access to a particular organization to the CSR administrative user, the CSR administrative user needs to belong to that organization.\n\nWhen the consumer banking CSRs (CSR1) search, view, create, and edit cases they only see data related to consumer banking customers. Likewise the business banking CSRs (CSR2) only see data for business banking customers. Neither is even aware that OAAM is doing this pre-filtering of data. The CSR managers (CSRSenior) can see data related to both consumer and business banking customer activity and they can perform all case flow operations.\n\nFlow:\n\nCSR opens the OAAM Administration Console.\n\nCSR sees only the appropriate user interface views and controls afforded his role\n\nCSR sees only the appropriate data afforded by his role (Organization ID). He cannot see data for users/sessions related to Organization IDs he does not have permission to view.\n\nCSR Manager sees only the appropriate data afforded by his role (Organization ID). He cannot see data for users/sessions related to Organization IDs he does not have permission to view.\n\n28.5.2 Agent Access Controls\n\nSecond Bank has deployed OAAM to secure both the consumer banking application and the business banking application. Their security analysts are broken up into two separate groups. One group investigates only consumer banking issues and the other investigates only business banking issues. They need to have strict control over all session, policy, and so on, and data visible to each of these security analysts organizations. Also, there is a organization of senior security analysts managers that need to have access to all data. When the consumer banking security analysts searches, views, creates, edits cases they only see data related to consumer banking. Likewise the business banking security analysts only see data for business banking. Neither is even aware that OAAM is doing this pre-filtering of data. The security analysts managers can see data related to both consumer and business banking activity/polices/and so on and they can perform all case flow operations. As well, managers have a filter so they can choose to only view business banking cases/data or only consumer banking cases/data.\n\nActors: Security Analyst and CSR\n\nFlow:\n\nCSR/Analyst opens the OAAM Administration Console.\n\nCSR/Analyst sees only the appropriate user interface views and controls afforded his role.\n\nCSR/Analyst sees only the appropriate data afforded by his role (Organization ID). He cannot see data for users/sessions related to Organization IDs he does not have permission to view.\n\nCSR/Analyst Manager sees only the appropriate data afforded by his role (Organization ID). He ca not see data for users/sessions related to Organization IDs he does not have permission to view.\n\nCSR Manager can filter what data he sees based on Organization ID.\n\n28.5.3 CSR Case API Data Access Controls\n\nSecond Bank decides to integrate OAAM with their existing customer ticketing application. They will use the APIs to obtain customer data and take customer service actions on behalf of customers. Their CSRs are broken up into two separate organizations. One organization assists only consumer banking customers and the other assists only business banking customers. They need to have strict control over the customer data visible to each of these CSR organizations. Also, there is an organization of senior CSR managers that need to have access to data for all customers. The API will allow them to configure the integration to control access to the customer data based on Organization ID to these different groups of employees.\n\nActor: CSR\n\nFlow:\n\nCSR opens his custom console.\n\nCSR sees only the appropriate data afforded by his role (organization ID)"
