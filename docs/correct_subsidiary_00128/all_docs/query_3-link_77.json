        "text": "5.4 Viewing Session Details\n\nThe Session Details page consolidates information needed for fraud analysis.\n\n5.4.1 The Panels\n\nThe Session ID is displayed on the tab label.The tab label shows the session ID to identify the session you are working with.\n\nThe Session Details page contains several panels. Except for the Session Details and Login Details panels, all other panels are displayed in the order of execution. All panels are collapsible. The main panels like checkpoints and transactions have multiple subpanels. Panel are not displayed if information is not available. For example, if there are no configurable actions for that session, the configuration actions panel is not be displayed.\n\n5.4.2 Session Details Panel\n\nThe top most panel, the Session Details panel, contains all the general information related to that session, such as the request ID, session ID, device score, Organization ID, and location.\n\n5.4.3 Login Details Panel\n\nThe next panel after the Session Details panel is the Login Details panel.\n\nThe Login panel shows all the related information regarding the login (transaction). It shows the status, authentication status, IP address from which the user logged in, username, user ID, cookie information, autolearning processing status, and the login time.\n\n5.4.4 Checkpoint Panels\n\nThe next panel is for checkpoint #1. Other checkpoint panels follow.\n\nBy default, checkpoint panels are collapsed. In the initial opened view, only the transactions and the final alerts are displayed in the expanded form. All other subpanels are collapsed. You can expand all the panels to view additional information for that checkpoint.\n\nThe first checkpoint panel could be one for Pre-Authentication. On top of the panel, the total amount of time taken for this checkpoint to execute, the final action, and the final risk score are shown.\n\nAlerts\n\nAlerts that were triggered during the session for the checkpoint are displayed. High-level alerts are displayed in bold red.\n\nActions\n\nAll actions are displayed in the Actions panel with a separate column indicating whether or not the action is final. (The final action is also displayed in the top right section of checkpoint panel.)\n\nPolicies\n\nA list of policies in that checkpoint are displayed in the Policies panel. The scoring engine information is not available for rules. Only the policy scoring engine is displayed. You can launch the Policy Explorer using the icon on top of the panel or from any of the icons within the table. The policy link displays the Policy Details page and the rules link displays the Rule Details page. Only active and triggered rules are displayed. Only active policies are displayed. You have the option to view all the rules in the Policy Explorer.\n\n5.4.5 Transactions Panel\n\nThe transactions panel displays a list of transactions that were performed in this session along with their corresponding transaction ID, transaction data, and entity information. You can also view the actual transaction data and the entity attribute values used in the transactions. For example, you can view the transaction amount in the bill pay transaction. Information such as this is helpful for the forensics.\n\n5.4.6 Policy Explorer\n\nThe Policy Explorer displays information about rules, conditions, trigger combinations, group linking, nested policies, and other items.\n\nRule Details\n\nDetails about the rule is shown in the Policy Explorer. The session results display the scores and results of that rule.\n\nPre-conditions\n\nPre-conditions for that rule is displayed in the details panel. The session results show the confidence factors and other values for the pre-conditions for that session.\n\nConditions\n\nThe values for the condition parameters are displayed. The session results show if the conditions returned true for this session evaluation.\n\nTrigger Combinations\n\nYou have the option to view the triggered override combinations or view all overrides. Session results show the override information that was evaluated for this session including the nested policy information.\n\nGroup Linking\n\nGroup linking for the policy is displayed in the details panel.\n\n5.5 Uses Cases\n\nThis section describes example use cases for the Session Details page.\n\n5.5.1 Use Case: Search Sessions\n\nYou are a member of the security team at Acme Corp. You work with Oracle Adaptive Access Manager on a regular basis, following up on escalated customer issues and security alerts. You perform a session search every couple hours throughout the day to identify any issues needing your attention and it is time to perform the next search. Directions: Search for sessions in the last 24 hours that have triggered high severity alerts and where access was blocked or locked.\n\nTo search sessions:\n\nLog in to OAAM Admin as an investigator.\n\nIn the Navigation tree, double-click Sessions.\n\nThe Sessions Search page is displayed.\n\nSearch through sessions in the last 24 hours with high alerts and a blocked or locked authentication status\n\nFor Authentication Status, select Blocked and Locked.\n\nFor Login Time, select the date and time, 24 hours ago, and the current date and time.\n\nFor Alert Level, select High.\n\nClick Search.\n\n5.5.2 Use Case: Session Details Page\n\nYou see a session with a Blocked authentication status. This may be a case of stolen authentication credentials so you want to look into it. You open the details screen for this session to take a closer look at exactly what went on in this session. You see that the login had triggered a block. Phillip, the user, was dynamically added to a high risk users group because of this rule. Directions: Part A: Drill in on the policy that caused the block to see what rules triggered. Part B: You also want to see if this user has any CSR cases related to this lockout. Search the CSR cases and determine if Phillip called in for a temporary allow.\n\nTo view session details:\n\nIn the Sessions Search page, view the Search Results table.\n\nYou noticed that for Phillip, one of his sessions shows:\n\na \"High alert\" in the Alerts column. Clicking on the information icon, you see a velocity alert.\n\na \"Blocked\" status in the Authentication Status column.\n\nClick the Session ID in the Search Results table to open the Session Details page.\n\nIn Login Details panel, the Authentication Status shows Blocked.\n\nView the final outcomes of each checkpoint.\n\nClick the Checkpoint panel.\n\nExpand the checkpoints.\n\nView the post-authentication checkpoints.\n\nExpand the post-authentication policies.\n\nClick the policy of interest to show details about the policy.\n\nView the rules that are triggered.\n\nView the final outcomes of the rules.\n\nThere are two final outcomes: the user is blocked and been added to a high risk group.\n\nBecause you want to see if Phillip has any CSR cases related to this lockout, search the CSR cases and determine if he called in to have his challenge questions reset.\n\nIn the Navigation tree, double-click Cases. The Cases Search page is displayed.\n\nIn Case Type, select CSR.\n\nEnter Phillip's username into User Name field.\n\nIn Search Results table, look for Temporary Allow in the Last Action Type column.\n\nClick the Case ID for the case that has Temporary Allow in the Last Action Type column.\n\nIn the Log subtab of the Case Details page, view notes.\n\nThe notes said he was traveling overseas when his wife asked him to look at their account online.\n\n5.6 Comparison Between 10g and 11g Session Details\n\nIn 11g, the Session Details page has been redesigned.\n\nStarting from 11g, key information regarding a session is contained on one screen rather than on different screens.\n\nFor example, in 10g, if you were on the Session Details page and wanted to know if a manual override existed in a policy, you would have to navigate away to another page.\n\nThe 11g Session Details page is better for forensics. For example, if you were analyzing a particular session, you would want all the details in one place. In 10g, values that were passed into a session are not available on the page. If a user were blocked during a transaction, and you were looking at the session, you would know the particular rule that was triggered and that the user was blocked when he was performing a transaction. However, you would not have the information about the amount that was passed in, the account number that was used in the transaction, and so on.\n\nFor example, in 10g, you would not know if there was a configurable action that added the user to a blacklisted group. Although you would know if Autolearning was turned on and what the processing status was, details would not be available about the pattern or the buckets that were updated."
