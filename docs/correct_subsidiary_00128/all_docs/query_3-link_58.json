        "text": "6.1 Introduction and Concepts\n\nThis section describes knowledge based authentication (KBA) key concepts.\n\n6.1.1 Knowledge Based Authentication\n\nOracle Adaptive Access Manager provides out-of-the-box secondary authentication in the form of knowledge based authentication (KBA). KBA is a secondary authentication method, an extension to the existing authentication method. It is presented after successful primary authentication (for example, a user entering a single factor credentials, such as a username and password) to improve authentication strength.\n\nKBA provides an infrastructure for\n\nUsers to select questions and provide answers which are used to challenge them later on\n\nKBA is used to authenticate an individual based on the user's answers substantiated by a real-time interactive question and answer process.\n\nLevels of logic algorithm for registration\n\nRegistration Logic manages the registration of challenge questions and answers.\n\nLevels of logic algorithm for answers\n\nAnswer Logic is made up of advanced matching algorithms (fuzzy logic) used by the system to intelligently detect the correct answers in the challenge response process. The algorithms and the level of Answer Logic are factors in evaluating answers.\n\nValidations\n\nValidations are used to validate the answers given by a user at the time of registration.\n\nKBA is used during online authentication of the user, which is automated, or a CSR challenge where the CSR interacts with the user to authenticate him before providing CSR services.\n\n6.1.2 Challenge Response Process\n\nThe KBA solution consists of securing an application using a challenge/response process where users are challenged with one or more questions to proceed with their requested sign-on, transaction, service, and so on.\n\n6.1.3 Challenge Response Configuration\n\nThe challenge/response process is controlled by a combination of properties and rules.\n\nQuestion presented at random or round robin\n\nPresentation logic (random versus round robin) is configurable through properties. If the deployment supports Oracle Identity Manager integration, the presentation is round robin. The user is expected to answer all the registered questions online.\n\nThe number of attempts a user is allowed for each question is set by a property.\n\nThe total number of KBA challenge failures a user is allowed before he is locked out by Oracle Adaptive Access Manager is configured in a rule condition.\n\n6.1.4 Registration\n\nDuring registration, which could be enrollment, opening a new account, or another events such as a reset, the user is asked to select questions and provide answers. The order of questions that are presented to a user during the registration phase is random using configurable parameters.\n\nLater on, the challenge questions selected at registration or during a reset may be used for challenge during high risk log ins, to access transactions, or sensitive information, or both, and so on. Oracle Adaptive Access Manager's Rules Engine and business rules are responsible for determining if it is appropriate to use challenge questions to authenticate the user.\n\n6.1.5 Challenge Questions\n\nDuring registration, users are presented with several question menus. For example, he may be presented with three question menus. A user must select one question from each menu and enter answers for them during registration. Only one question from each question menu can be registered. These questions become the user's \"registered questions.\"\n\nWhen rules in OAAM Admin trigger challenge questions, OAAM Server displays the challenge questions and accepts the answers in a secure way for users. The questions can be presented in the QuestionPad, TextPad, and other pads, where the challenge question is embedded into the image of the authenticator, or simple HTML. These are configured through properties.\n\nThe out-of-the-box categories that questions can be grouped into are listed. The customer can configure questions from these categories.\n\nChildhood\n\nSports\n\nYour Birth\n\nParents, Grandparents, Siblings\n\nAutomobile\n\nEducation\n\nChildren\n\nYour Employment\n\nSignificant Other\n\nPets\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n6.1.6 Question Set\n\nKBA offers a large pool of questions, which is the framework for obtaining answers from the user during registration or reset.\n\nThe Question Set is a fixed set of questions that is allotted to the user. This set is allotted at random and once for the user unless it is reset.\n\nIt is generated based on the settings configured in the Registration Logic.\n\nThis Question Set prevents any single user from having access to all the challenge questions. This is to prevent a fraudster from harvesting questions for use in a phishing exercise.\n\nA user can receive a new Question Set if a customer service representative resets it for the user.\n\n6.1.7 Registration Logic\n\nRegistration Logic manages the registration of challenge questions and answers.\n\nDuring KBA registration each user is presented with a Question Set, a subset of the challenge questions library.\n\nThe Question Set is generally broken up into several drop-downs that have questions to select. The drop-down with questions is called a \"menu.\"\n\nThe number of questions that appear on each menu, the number of categories per menu, and the number of questions that a user must register is configurable.\n\nOut-of-the-box, questions are grouped into categories.\n\nThe challenge questions in the questions menus do not change unless the question set is changed.\n\nThe user is required to select one question from each menu and enter answers for them. Only one question from each question menu can be registered.\n\nValidations are applied to the answers provided by the user during registration.\n\nFor example, if the question, \"What year did you start junior high school,\" is assigned the Month-Day-Year (MMDDYY) validation, a user registering for this question is not allowed to provide \"April 1st 1920\" for the answer.\n\nTo configure the Registration Logic, you specify the settings for:\n\nThe question set generation\n\nThe number of questions to be registered\n\nThe number of questions per menu\n\nThe number of categories per menu\n\nThe Question Set is generated based on the Registration Logic.\n\nThe validations that will be applied to the answers\n\nFor information on setting Registration Logic, see Section 6.8, \"Configuring the Registration Logic.\"\n\nHow do the KBA Registration Logic settings affect a customer's question set?\n\nExample configurations are presented in the following table.\n\nExample Question/Menu Categories/Menu Questions/Category in a Menu 1 7 4 2+2+2+1 2 10 4 3+3+2+2 3 10 1 10\n\nExample #1, shown on line 1, results in registration menus containing 2 questions from category A and 2 questions from category B and 2 questions from category C and 1 question from category D.\n\nThis continues in a round robin fashion as needed. If there are any categories with an insufficient number of questions or an insufficient number of categories duplicate questions can result.\n\nThe following is an example of a configuration to avoid:\n\nNumber of questions user will register: 3\n\nThe number of questions that a user must register. The new user registration should display the same number of question menus as the number of questions that a user must register.\n\nNumber of questions per menu: 5\n\nThe number of questions that appear on each menu. The new user registration should display the same number of questions in each menu as the number of categories for each menu. The total number of questions from all the menus (number of questions multiplied by the questions in each menu) cannot exceed the total number of questions available in the database.\n\nNumber of categories per menu: 5\n\nThe number of categories per menu. The new user registration should display the same number of categories for each menu as the number of questions in each menu.\n\nFifteen or more categories are required, each with at least one question enabled. But if there are fewer than 15 categories and one of these categories has only one question enabled, some Question Sets will have that question twice.\n\nThe algorithm tries to use as many available categories as possible.\n\nFor example to generate a Question Set with:\n\n3 menus\n\n5 questions per menu\n\n5 categories per menu\n\nThe algorithm tries to pick one question each from 15 categories if 15 categories are available.\n\nThe minimum number of questions per category should be equal to the number of questions in the Question Set divided by the total number of categories.\n\nPre-requisite for Configuring Registration Logic for Locales\n\nThe deployment administrator must ensure that there are enough questions in the database for each of the supported locale as configured in OAAM Admin during deployment; otherwise, OAAM Server displays only the English language questions during registration.\n\nThe number of locale-specific questions must be equal to or greater than the \"Questions User Will Register\" multiplied by the \"Questions per Menu\" multiplied by the \"Categories per Menu.\"\n\n6.1.8 Answer Logic\n\nAnswer Logic checks to see if the answer provided by the user matches closely to the ones provided during registration.\n\nAnswer Logic is made up of advanced matching algorithms used by the system to intelligently detect the correct answers in the challenge response process. The algorithms and the level of Answer Logic are factors in evaluating answers.\n\nErrors can be caused by simple input errors such as fat fingering, extra characters, misspellings, and so on.\n\nCommon misspellings and abbreviations for example can be accepted if the basic information of the answer is correct.\n\nThe following algorithms are available and can be configured for your requirements:\n\nPhonetics\n\nMissing character(s)\n\nExtra character(s)\n\nCommon misspellings\n\nCommon abbreviations\n\nCommon acronyms\n\nKeyboard fat fingering\n\nCommon nicknames\n\nRegional spelling differences\n\nDate Format\n\nThe Answer Logic algorithms can be enabled or disabled and the intensity or strength of some algorithms (the level of Answer Logic used to evaluate answers given for challenge questions) can also be configured.\n\nFor example, high risk transactions such as wire transfers may require a high degree of certainty (i.e. exact match) whereas accessing personal, non-sensitive information may require a lower degree of response certainty.\n\nAnswer Logic algorithms are available for both the online challenge and CSR phone challenge processes.\n\nOnline settings are applied for answers the user provided online using OAAM Server. Phone challenge settings are applied for answers provided by users over the phone and entered by the CSR.\n\nThe online challenge and CSR phone challenge Answer Logic are completely independent of each other. They can be configured separately.\n\nFor example, you can set the online challenge logic strength to high and the CSR phone challenge logic strength to low. For the CSR phone challenge logic strength, you may have provided more margin for error, because CSRs are listening to the answers over the phone and entering the answers.\n\n6.1.9 Validations\n\nValidations are used to validate the answers given by a user at the time of registration. Validations can be at the local level, to associated with each individual question, or at the global level, to be applied to all the questions presented to the user.\n\nThere are no automated validations to ensure that question specific validations and global validations do not conflict. Administrators must take care not to configure the same validations for local and global. For example, validation for a question should not be set to numeric only if the alpha only is set as a global validation.\n\nQuestion Registration Validation (Local)\n\nEach question can be assigned unique validations to control the answers a user is allowed to register. For example, if the business team wants to force users to answer a particular question using a specific date format.\n\nThe scope of validations applied to an individual question is local. Local validations are specified during the creation of a question.\n\nGlobal Registration Validation (Global)\n\nGlobal validations control the answers a user is allowed to register for all questions.\n\nGlobal validations influence all answer registration. For example, if the \"Four-digit year (YYYY)\" validation is applied globally then only numeral answers are accepted during KBA registration. This would be a problem if there are questions available to users that would normally have alphanumeric answers.\n\nGlobal validations are specified during the configuration of Registration Logic.\n\nGlobal-Local Validation\n\nThe scope of validations can be applied to individual questions or a combination of questions.\n\n6.1.10 Failure Counters\n\nFailure counters are used to lock out fraudsters so that they are unable to obtain the answers/questions.\n\nKBA uses two failure counters. They are:\n\nthe Online Counter\n\nthe Phone Counter\n\nThe maximum number for online challenges and phone challenges are configurable. The phone counter maximum is \"per question.\"\n\nFor the following example, assume:\n\nMax online = 3\n\nMax phone (per question) = 3\n\nIf the user is answering challenge questions online, and if the user is given three attempts to provide a correct answer, a total of three attempts is allowed. Each failure increments the Online Counter. The user is locked out of the session after three attempts. The online only challenge is designed to limit the exposure of questions to fraudsters.\n\nIf the user is answering challenge questions over the phone, and if the user is given three attempts at answering each question, a total of nine attempts is allowed. Each failure increments the Phone Counter. The user is locked out of the session after nine attempts.\n\nA success for an online or a phone challenge automatically resets all counters to zero. For the next challenge, the next question is displayed.\n\n6.1.11 KBA Resets\n\nAuthenticator uses questions as additional credentials to help prevent fraud. A customer service representative (CSR) can reset these questions for the user when necessary.\n\nThe CSR can reset KBA-related items for a user, as described.\n\n6.1.11.1 Reset Challenge Questions\n\nThe CSR resets a user's challenge questions. The system deletes the existing questions and answers and generates a new question set for the user to register from. Registration of challenge questions is required at the next log in to the Web site.\n\n6.1.11.2 Reset Challenge Questions and the Set of Questions to Choose From\n\nThe CSR resets the user's challenge question set (challenge questions and the set of questions to register from). Registration of challenge questions is required at the next log in to the Web site.\n\n6.1.11.3 Increment User to the Next Question\n\nThe CSR resets the user's next question so the system advances the user to the next challenge question in the list of registered questions. So if the user is currently being asked question A, question B or C is now asked. A different challenge question is presented at the next log in to the Web site.\n\n6.1.11.4 Unlock a User\n\nWhen the CSR unlocks the user that has been locked out of the system because of failed challenge questions. Unlocking the user resets the user's failure counter.\n\n6.1.11.5 Ask Question (KBA Phone Challenge)\n\nThe CSR uses the user's challenge questions for phone authentication and enters user's response. If the user answers the question correctly, the question failure counter and increment question counter are reset. The system automatically takes appropriate action depending on the status such as unlocking the user. Information about phone and online failures is provided in Section 6.1.10, \"Failure Counters.\" High level flows for the Ask Question action is presented in Chapter 4, \"Managing and Supporting Cases.\" The matrix in Section 6.1.10, \"Failure Counters\" contains detailed examples for individual flows.\n\n6.1.12 Disable Question and Category Logic\n\nThis section describes the logic to handle disabled questions and categories.\n\nDisabling Logic\n\nThe disabling logic is as follows for KBA:\n\nIf you disable the last remaining question in a category, the category is automatically disabled as well.\n\nThe number of active categories must be equal to or greater than the maximum number of categories in the question menu. An error message results when you try to disable a category and this requirement is not met.\n\nConsequences\n\nThe following table summarizes the disable results.\n\nNew customers user with question in question set users with question registered Disable Question The disabled question is not used to generate new users' question sets. At re-registration or when a user changes his preference: Disabled question are replaced with another question from the same category. The disabled question continues to be active.\n\nIf the user is re-registering or changing user preference, the disabled question is replaced with another question from the same category.\n\nDisable Category The disabled category is not used to generate new users' question sets. At re-registration or when a user changes his preference: All questions in the disabled category are replaced with questions from a new category that has not been used to generate current question set. Questions from the disabled category continue to be active.\n\nIf the user is re-registering or changing user preference, all questions in the disabled category are replaced with questions from a new category that has not been used to generate the current question set.\n\n6.1.13 Locked Status\n\nLocked is the status that OAAM Admin sets if the user fails the question challenge. The \"Locked\" status is only used if the KBA or OTP Anywhere is in use.\n\nA user is locked out of the session after the failure counter reaches the maximum number of failures.\n\nAfter the user is locked out, a Customer Service Representative must reset the status to Unlocked before the account can be used to enter the system.\n\n6.5 Managing Challenge Questions\n\nThe KBA functionality enables you to manage challenge questions.\n\nYou can perform the following task for challenge questions:\n\nSearching for a Challenge Question\n\nCreating a New Question\n\nCreating a Question Like Another Question\n\nEditing a Question\n\nImporting Questions\n\nExporting Questions\n\nDeleting a Question\n\nDisabling a Question\n\nActivating Questions\n\nDeactivating Questions\n\n6.5.1 Searching for a Challenge Question\n\nUse the Questions Search page to view a list of all challenge questions and search for a question based on various criteria. The Questions Search page provides access to the Questions Details page for any question.\n\nWhen the Questions Search page first appears, the Search Results table is displayed with default filter values.\n\nTo search for a question:\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nAn example Questions Search page is shown in Figure 6-2.\n\nFigure 6-2 Questions Search page\n\nThe Questions Search page displays a Search section and a Search Results table that shows a summary of the questions that match your search criteria.\n\nSpecify criteria in the Search Filter to locate the questions and click Search.\n\nThe search filter criteria are described in Table 6-1.\n\nIf you want to reset the search parameters to the default setting, use the Reset button.\n\nTable 6-1 Question Search Criteria\n\nField Description\n\nThe Search Results table displays a summary of questions that match the criteria specified.\n\nBy default, questions are sorted on Question Name, but you can sort questions on Update Time, Create Time, Status, Question, and Category.\n\nIn the Search Results table, click the question link to view more details. The Question Details page appears.\n\nTable 6-2, \"Question Action menu commands\" lists the commands that are available through the Action menu. You can select one or more questions and perform actions on those questions.\n\nTable 6-2 Question Action menu commands\n\nCommand Description\n\nExcept for creating a question, edit selected, and edit category, all other operations are bulk operations.\n\n6.5.2 Viewing Question Details and Statistics\n\nThe Question Details page provides information such as:\n\nQuestion Sets with Question\n\nUsers Registered for Question\n\nPercentage of Users Registered For Question\n\nPercentage of Successful Challenges\n\nPercentage of Unsuccessful Challenges\n\nQuestion ID\n\nLast Updated Date\n\nTo view question statistics:\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nFrom the Questions Search page, click the question of interest in the Search Results table\n\nThe Question Detail page appears with the statistics.\n\n6.5.3 Creating a New Question\n\nTo create a new question\n\nIn the Navigation tree, double-click Questions under KBA. The Questions Search page is displayed.\n\nFrom the Questions Search page, click the New Questions button.\n\nThe New Questions page appears where you can enter details to create a new question.\n\nAlternative methods to open create pages are listed in Section 3.9, \"Access to Search, Create, and Import.\"\n\nWhen the New Question page first appears, the default value for the question status is Active.\n\nQuestion, Category, Status, and Locale are required fields.\n\nType the new question in the Question field.\n\nThe question names must be unique across categories.\n\nFrom the Category list, select the category of question you want.\n\nBy default, there is no data in the Category list. You must import the challenge questions ZIP files (oaam_kba_questions_<locale>.zip) for data to appear in the Category menu. You can also create a new category.\n\nIn the Locale list, select the language you want.\n\nBy default, the Locale menu displays English and 26 other default locale languages.\n\nEach question can be assigned unique validations to control the answers a user is allowed to register. To assign a local validation, select the validation type from the Registration Validation list.\n\nThe local validations you select in this step control the answers a user is allowed to register for this particular question.\n\nIt does not control the registration of answers for all questions.\n\nFor information on the difference between global and local validations, refer to Section 6.1.9, \"Validations.\"\n\nIn the Answer Logic Hints list, select the type of Answer Logic Hint you want.\n\nA hint can be added to questions individually to affect the Answer Logic used to evaluate given answers. This is performed to better tune the logic for the type of question. This is especially important for date related questions.\n\nThese hints help the Answer Logic function more successfully on some questions, for example, on date related questions. If a question has the date answer hint applied then the abbreviations, phonetics and fat fingering Answer Logic runs first, and then special date format logic is applied.\n\nClick Apply. A confirmation dialog appears telling you that the question was created successfully.\n\nClick OK to dismiss the dialog.\n\nThe Question Detail page appears for the newly created question.\n\nAfter the question has been created, you can edit details.\n\n6.5.4 Creating a Question Like Another Question\n\nTo create a new question that is similar to an existing question:\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nFrom the Questions Search page, select the row corresponding to the question of interest.\n\nClick the Create Like icon.\n\nThe Create Like screen appears where you can enter details to create a new question.\n\nThe Create Like screen appears with pre-populated data from the original question. Pre-populated fields are Category, Locale, Status, Answer Logic Hints, and Registration Validations.\n\nQuestion, Category, Status and Locale are required fields.\n\nThe Create Like icon is disabled if multiple rows are selected.\n\nYou can create a question for any locale.\n\nType the new question in the Question field.\n\nEdit any of the other fields if you want.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe Question Detail page appears for the newly created question.\n\nIf you click Cancel, the Questions Search page appears.\n\n6.5.5 Editing a Question\n\nThe Question Details page enables you to activate/disable questions and edit the question, question category, locale, and registration and answer validation.\n\nRead-only question statistics are available in the Question Statistics section.\n\nIf you edit a question, users using that question receive the updated question.\n\nTo edit a question\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nIn the Questions Search page, search for the questions you are interested in.\n\nClick the hyperlinked question you want to edit.\n\nThe Question Details page appears.\n\nMake the changes you want.\n\nYou cannot edit the Question ID or last updated time.\n\nClick Apply to save the changes or Revert to discard them.\n\nIf you click Revert, the edited details are reverted to the initial state.\n\n6.5.6 Importing Questions\n\nTo import questions:\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nIn the Questions Search page, click Import Questions or select Import Selected from the Actions menu.\n\nIn the Import Questions screen, type the path and name of the file; or use the Browse (...) button to locate the ZIP file that contains the questions, and then select the file.\n\nClick Open and then click Import.\n\nIf you import questions that belong to a category not currently in the system, the category is also imported. If you import a question with the same ID number as an existing question, the existing question is overwritten.\n\nA confirmation dialog displays the status of the operation and a list of questions that were imported into the system.\n\nClick Done.\n\n6.5.7 Exporting Questions\n\nMultiple questions can be selected and exported.\n\nTo export questions:\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nIn the Questions Search page, search for the questions you are interested in.\n\nSelect the rows corresponding to the questions of interest.\n\nSelect the Export icon or Export from the Actions menu.\n\nIn the Export screen, click the Export button.\n\nThe selected questions are exported.\n\n6.5.8 Deleting a Question\n\nTo delete a question, follow these instructions.\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nIn the Questions Search page, search for the questions you are interested in.\n\nSelect the rows corresponding to the questions of interest and click Delete or select Delete Selected from the Actions menu.\n\nThe Delete button and Delete Selected menu item are enabled only if a question is selected.\n\nA Confirm Delete dialog is displayed with a list of questions and question IDs.\n\nClick Delete to delete the questions.\n\nDeleted questions are not available for new registrations but users currently registered for these questions can continue to use them.\n\nA confirmation dialog is displayed.\n\nIn the confirmation dialog, click OK.\n\nAn error is displayed when you try to delete a question that is in used by a registered user.\n\nDeleted questions are not available for new registrations but the user currently registered for these questions can continue to use them.\n\n6.5.9 Disabling a Question\n\nTo disable a question\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nIn the Questions Search page, search for the question you want to disable.\n\nClick the hyperlinked question you want to disable.\n\nThe Question Details page appears.\n\nIn the Status field, select Disable and click Apply.\n\nThe selected questions are disabled.\n\nThe following scenarios occur when a question is disabled:\n\nThe disabled question cannot be used to generate a new user's Question Set.\n\nAt re-registration or reset, the disabled question is replaced with another question from the same category for those users who had the disabled question in their question set.\n\nThe disable question remains active for users who have registered the question. If the user is re-registering or changing user preference, the disabled question is replaced with another question from the same category.\n\n6.5.10 Activating Questions\n\nTo activate questions:\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nIn the Questions Search page, search for the questions you are interested in.\n\nSelect the rows corresponding to the questions you want to activate.\n\nPress the Activate button or select Activate from the Actions menu.\n\nThe selected questions are activated.\n\n6.5.11 Deactivating Questions\n\nTo deactivate questions:\n\nNavigate to the Questions Search page, as described in Section 6.4, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nIn the Questions Search page, search for the questions you want to deactivate.\n\nSelect the rows corresponding to the questions you want to deactivate.\n\nPress the Deactivate button or select DeActivate from the Actions menu.\n\nThe selected questions are deactivated.\n\nThe following scenarios occur when a question is deactivated:\n\nThe deactivated question is not used to generate a new question set.\n\nAt re-registration or reset, the deactivated question is replaced with another question from the same category for those users who had the deactivated question in their question set.\n\nThe deactivated question remains active for users who have registered the question. If the user is re-registering or changing user preference, the deactivated question is replaced with another question from the same category.\n\n6.9 Configuring the Answer Logic\n\nChallenge questions are set up by the user during the registration process. They are used for additional authentication during high risk situations. Oracle's Answer Logic is used during the challenge response process.\n\nAnswer Logic is a unique combination of Knowledge Based Authentication with registration, answer, and fuzzy logic to enable KBA for the Identity and Access Management Suite.\n\nThe KBA Answer Logic tab includes controls for the level of each Answer Logic algorithm used for answer validation. The higher the level the less exact answers need to be for acceptance.\n\nAnswer Logic (fuzzy logic) algorithms can be configured on the Answer Logic page. The algorithms are divided into three categories: Common Abbreviations, Fat Fingering (accidentally pressing the nearest neighbor on the keyboard), and Phonetics.\n\nOut-of-the-box Answer Logic is only functional for English. Abbreviations can be globalized but creation of locale specific text equivalency files is required. For information, refer to Section 6.11, \"Customizing Abbreviations and Equivalences for Locales.\"\n\nTo configure Answer Logic:\n\nIn the Navigation tree, double-click Answer Logic under KBA.\n\nYou can specify different settings for Online Challenge and CSR Phone Challenge.\n\nFigure 6-6 Answer Logic\n\nTo change the level of Answer Logic used for keyboard fat fingering and phonetics, select Off, Low, Medium, or High: the lower the setting the higher degree of exactness required.\n\nFor information on logic levels, see Section 6.9.3, \"Level of Answer Logic.\"\n\nClick OK.\n\n6.9.1 About Answer Logic\n\nThe Answer Logic algorithms can be enabled or disabled and the intensity or strength of some algorithms can also be configured.\n\nThe following Answer Logic algorithms are available for both the online challenge and phone challenge processes:\n\nAbbreviations\n\nThis algorithm handles common abbreviations, common nicknames, common acronyms, and date format.\n\nPhonetics\n\nThis algorithm handles Answers that \"sound like\" the registered answer, regional spelling differences, and common misspellings\n\nKeyboard fat fingering\n\nThis algorithm handles Answers with typos due to the proximity of keys on a standard keyboard.\n\n6.9.2 Answer Logic Algorithms Examples\n\nThis section highlights the most common response errors and shows how Answer Logic algorithms are used for the system to intelligently detect the correct answers in the challenge response process.\n\nExamples of abbreviations, phonetics, and keyboard fat fingering are also provided.\n\n6.9.2.1 Abbreviations\n\nCommon abbreviations, common nicknames, common acronyms, and date format are handled by this algorithm.\n\nCommon Abbreviations\n\nThis algorithm matches the words in the following pairs as equivalent. OAAM Admin has predefined list of word-pairs that cover common abbreviations, common nicknames and common acronyms.\n\nStreet - St.\n\nDrive - Dr.\n\nCalifornia - CA\n\nThe list can be customized by creating a new abbreviation file, custom_auth_abbreviation_config.properties. For information, refer to Section 6.10, \"Customizing English Abbreviations and Equivalences.\"\n\nCommon Nicknames\n\nOracle has a predefined list of the most common nicknames that is used in the challenge response process.\n\nTimothy - Tim\n\nMatthew - Matt\n\nDate Format\n\nThe questions that require date as the answer specify the format in which the user should enter the answer. The format is either YYYY or MMDD, but not both. However, from experience, users still use other formats during the challenge response process. The abbreviation logic for date format sees the following as the same:\n\n0713\n\n713\n\nJuly 13th\n\nJuly 13\n\nJuly 13, 1970\n\n6.9.2.2 Phonetics\n\nAnswers that \"sound like\" the registered answer, regional spelling differences, and common misspellings are handled by this algorithm.\n\nThe phonetics algorithm is only supported in English.\n\nCommon Misspellings\n\nOracle's Phonetic Answer Logic algorithm accounts for misspellings.\n\nph - f\n\nCorrect word: elephant - Spelling mistake: elefant\n\n6.9.2.3 Keyboard Fat Fingering\n\nOracle's Fat Fingering algorithm accounts for typos due to the proximity of keys on a standard keyboard and transposed letters. Answers with typos due to the proximity of keys on a standard keyboard are handled by this algorithm.\n\nThe number of fat fingering characters allowed depends on the length of the original word and the level set. The algorithm returns a percentage score associated with the characters that have an exact match. The intensity determines the minimum score required to match the answer with the registered answer.\n\nNote:\n\nThe fat fingering algorithm is only supported in English.\n\nCommon Typos\n\nSwitching \"w\" and \"e\"\n\nSwitching \"u\" and \"i\"\n\nSwitching \"t\" and \"r\"\n\nExamples of Fat Fingering\n\nCorrect word: signature - Fat finger: signatire\n\n6.9.3 Level of Answer Logic\n\nThe level of Answer Logic, the intensity or strength of algorithms, used to evaluate answers given for challenge questions is adjustable. You can enable or disable each algorithm and you can also specify the following levels for the algorithms used:\n\nOff – No Answer Logic is used; answers must exactly match those previously registered by the user.\n\nLow – Less Answer Logic; answers provided by the user must be a match or near-match to the answers that were provided at the time of registration\n\nMedium – More Answer Logic; the user is given some leeway for the answers that are provided. For example, St. might be accepted for Street.\n\nHigh – Highest level of Answer Logic. The constraints are not strict for matching.\n\nEach algorithm generates a score that represents how close the given answer is to the registered answer. OAAM Admin can be configured to accept different threshold score ranges for each algorithm individually. Separate threshold values for each algorithm (low/medium/high) are set in a properties file. The default thresholds are described as follows.\n\n6.9.3.1 Abbreviation\n\nFor abbreviation:\n\nReturn values: 0 or 100 (no-match OR match)\n\nLevels: ON or OFF\n\nLogic\n\nIf an abbreviation entry exists linking the given strings, score is 100\n\nElse score is 0\n\n6.9.3.2 Fat Fingering\n\nFor fat fingering:\n\nReturn values: range 0 to 100\n\nLevels: OFF, LOW (90+), MEDIUM (75+), HIGH (60+)\n\nLogic\n\nIf the string lengths don't match, score is 0\n\nIf a position does not have the expected character or its neighbor, score is 0\n\nElse compute the number of positions that have the neighboring characters.\n\nScore = (StringLength – NeighborPositionCount) * 100 /StringLength\n\n6.9.3.3 Phonetics\n\nFor phonetics:\n\nReturn values: 0, 60, 75, 90\n\nLevels: OFF, LOW (90), MEDIUM (75), HIGH (60)\n\nLogic\n\nCompute primary and alternative phonetic keys for the given strings, using DoubleMetaphone algorithm\n\nIf primary keys of both strings match, score is HIGH\n\nElse if a primary key of one of the strings and alternate key of the other string match, score is MEDIUM\n\nElse if the alternate keys of both string match, score is LOW\n\nElse the score is 0\n\n6.9.3.4 Multiple Word Answers\n\nAnswers that contain multiple words are treated in a specific way by the Answer Logic. If the final score from a complete string match does not meet the \"success\" criteria, individual words in the answer are evaluated. If each individual word in an answer is accepted by any of the algorithms the whole answer is accepted.\n\nMultiple word answers with missing/extra words must be an exact match to the registered answer. Answers must have the same number of words as the registered answer to be evaluated with Answer Logic.\n\nFor example: If the registered answer is \"Mead Elementary School\" and the answer given at the time of challenge is \"Mesd Elem Sch\":\n\nAbbreviation: Mead–Mesd=0; Elementary-Elem=100; School-Sch=100 Fat-finger: Mead-Mesd=75; Elementary-Elem=0; School-Sch=0 Phonetics: Mead-Mesd=0; Elementary-Elem=0; School-Sch=0\n\nAssuming that abbreviation was set to anything besides off and fat fingering was set to medium or high, since all three words would be accepted individually, the whole answer would be accepted."
