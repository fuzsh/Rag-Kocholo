        "text": "6.3.1 Determining the Application ID\n\nThe Universal Installation Option can be placed in front of multiple applications, and customized to work with each one as required. Determine how many applications are to be configured, assign each application an Application ID. This Application ID is the same one used to configure the Proxy (see Chapter 5, \"Oracle Adaptive Access Manager Proxy\"). In many cases applications are referred to internally by some name or abbreviation, so an integrator configuring OAAM Server might want to use that name. For an example, if the client has two applications, one wholesale banking application and one retail banking application, the integrator might choose to use wholesale and retail as the Application IDs for the two applications.\n\nThe Proxy will send the AppId to OAAM Server as needed via an HTTP header. This AppId is then used to determine which configuration is used when displaying pages to the client. OAAM Server is configured by a set of properties which we will discuss in more detail later. An example of how AppId is used in a property definition is shown as follows:\n\nbharosa.uio.appId1.default.user.group=app1Group\n\nThe bold \"appId1\" is the location in the property where the AppId is used to configure application specific values.\n\n6.3.2 Determining Default User Groups\n\nE ach application can be configured to have a unique default user group. This is the group that a user of that application will be associated with as their Organization ID when first created in the Oracle Adaptive Access Manager database. Similarly, it will be the Organization ID used to attempt to load user information from the database when a user attempts to log in to the application.\n\nAs used in the previous example the property for Organization ID looks as follows:\n\nbharosa.uio.appId1.default.user.group=app1Group bharosa.uio.appId2.default.user.group=app2Group\n\nIn the example, two Organization IDs are defined to two different applications. The application with an AppId of \"appId 1\" has been assigned the Organization ID of \"app1Group\" and the application with an AppId of \"appId2\" has been assigned the Organization ID of \"app2Group\".\n\n6.4.1 Custom Header / Footer\n\nOAAM Server provides the ability to create custom header and footer files for applications being secured. The header and footer files are JSP and can contain any HTML or JSP code required to replicate the look of the application being secured. All the customer resources (JSP files, image files, HTML, and others) should be copied into the deployed application directories along with the OAAM Server Web application.\n\nThe header (header.jsp) and footer (footer.jsp) files should contain only content html, all page related tags (<html>, <head>, <body>, etc) are already provided by OAAM Server. As a simple example we will create a header and footer that contain a single image each, to be used as the header and footer of an application called \"appId1\".\n\nCopy the following code into a file called header.jsp for the header.\n\n/client/app1/header.jsp <img src=\"/client/app1/images/header.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to App1\"/>\n\nCopy the following code into a file called footer.jsp for the footer.\n\n/client/app1/footer.jsp <img src=\"/client/app1/images/footer.jsp\" alt=\"App1 Footer\"/>\n\nThese files will be housed in the \"/client/app1/\" directory within the Web application.\n\nTo associate these files with the application we would add the following properties to client_resource_<locale>.properties:\n\nbharosa.uio.appId1.header = /client/app1/header.jsp bharosa.uio.appId1.footer = /client/app1/footer.jsp\n\n6.4.2 Custom CSS\n\nOAAM Server styles are controlled through a single CSS file, bharosa_uio.css, located in the css directory. These styles can be overridden by including a custom CSS file. Much like the header and footer example show previously, you can create your own file and include that file on an application or global level through properties. Refer to Section 6.5, \"Configuring Application Properties.\"\n\nIn this example we will override the font-family of the default body style definition.\n\nThe body style in bharosa_uio.css is defined as follows:\n\nbody{ background-color:#ffffff; font-size:12px; color:#000000; font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px }\n\nNow to use our newly created file, we will add the following property:\n\nbharosa.uio.appId1.custom.css=/client/app1/css/app1.css\n\nIn this case, all we did was change helvetica to the primary font-family in our \"appId1\" application. Any style defined in bharosa_uio.css can be overridden in this manner if required.\n\n6.4.3 Custom Content and Messaging\n\nOAAM Server pages have a variety of content and messaging sections. These sections can be customized by properties in client_resource_<locale>.properties. Some customizable items, like page title and message, are applicable for each page. While other items, like login blocked message, are specific to a particular page.\n\nTo change the page title on the login page in our example \"appId1\" application, we would add the following line to client_resource_<locale>.properties.\n\nTo change the page title on the login page in our example \"appId1\" application, we would add the following line to client_resource_<locale>.properties.\n\nbharosa.uio.appId1.signon.page.title=Welcome to App1, please sign in.\n\nThe contents of error messages are also controlled in the same way. In the following example we will customize the error message displayed when a user has been blocked by security rules.\n\nbharosa.uio.appId1.login.user.blocked = You are not authorized to login. Please contact customer service at 1-888-555-1234.\n\n6.5.3 Overriding Existing User-Defined Enums\n\nOverriding existing user-defined enums has some special cases. You may override any existing enum element's attribute value of the default application ID just as you would any other property, but to change the value of an element's attribute in a single application using an appId, you must create the entire enum in that application using the appropriate appId.\n\nFor example, using the User Defined Enum defined in Section 6.5.2, \"User-Defined Enums,\" if we wanted to change \"Company ID\" to \"Profile ID\" for only one application (appId1), we would need to do the following:\n\nFor example, using the User Defined Enum, if we wanted to change \"Company ID\" to \"Profile ID\" for only one application (appId1), we would need to do the following:\n\nbharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum = Enum for Login Credentials bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.profileid=0 bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.profileid.name=ProfileID bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.profileid.description=Profile ID bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.profileid.inputname=profileid bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.profileid.maxlength=20 bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.profileid.order=0 bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.username=1 bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.username.name=Username bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.username.description=Username bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.username.inputname=userid bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.username.maxlength=18 bharosa.uio.appId1.credentials.enum.username.order=1\n\nFor instructions on customizing, extending, or overriding Oracle Adaptive Access Manager properties or enums, refer to Chapter 12, \"Customizing Oracle Adaptive Access Manager.\""
