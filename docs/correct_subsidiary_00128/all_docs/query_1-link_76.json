Or obtain externally (to buy)? If Cin-house < Cmarket, then the firm should vertically integrate Ex: Microsoft hires programmers to write code in-house rather than contracting out Firms and markets have distinct advantages and disadvantages (see Exhibit 8.2) 8-13\n\n14 Organizing Economic Activity: Firm vs. Markets\n\nEXHIBIT 8.2 Organizing Economic Activity: Firm vs. Markets INSTRUCTOR: An Interactive video activity is available online through McGraw-Hill Connect on this section of the text.

To encourage investment, Toyota took an equity position INSTRUCTOR: A 6-minute video on China’s vital role in the supply of global rare earth metals. In fall of 2010, China restricted exports of the materials. The video was produced by The New York Times in November 2010. 1–18 China Rare Earth Video 8-18 18\n\n19 LO 8-5 Describe and examine alternatives to vertical integration.\n\nLO 8-1 Define corporate-level strategy, and describe the three dimensions along which it is assessed.

Some working farms are turning to tourism as an additional and complementary revenue source. A study from the U.S. Census of Agriculture in 2007 found nearly 25,000 farms providing some level of agri-tourism and recreation services. Small farms worldwide are participating in this trend by offering “pick your own” crops in season as well as a small bed-and-breakfast. What other industries could benefit from diversifying into tourism & recreation? INSTRUCTOR: This is a shortened version of Small Group Exercise 1 in the back of this chapter. 8-34\n\n35 ExxonMobil Diversifies into Natural Gas\n\nSTRATEGY HIGHLIGHT 8.3 ExxonMobil earned highest profit in its history in 2008 Majority of profits come from petroleum-based products. Environmental change toward clean energy ExxonMobil must react to the change. ExxonMobil to focus on clean energy: natural gas.

Take either the energy or health care industry and draw the industry value chain. What areas of potential vertical integration should GE consider? What related diversification would you suggest for GE in reference to its focus for the future? How do GE’s corporate-level strategic initiatives of energy, health care, and globalization reinforce each other? How might they generate conflicts in the company? 8-48\n\n49 Take-Away Concepts LO 8-1 Define corporate-level strategy, and describe the three dimensions along which it is assessed. While business strategy addresses “how to compete,” corporate strategy addresses “where to compete. Corporate strategy concerns the scope of the firm along three dimensions: (1) vertical integration (along the industry value chain); (2) horizontal integration (diversification); and (3) geographic scope (global strategy). To gain & sustain competitive advantage, any corporate strategy must support and strengthen a firm’s strategic position regardless of whether it is a differentiation, cost leadership, or integration strategy. 8-49\n\n50 Take-Away Concepts (cont’d)\n\nLO 8-2 Describe and evaluate different options firms have to organize economic activity. Transaction cost economics help managers decide what activities to do in-house (“make”) versus what services and products to obtain from the external market (“buy”). When the costs to pursue an activity in-house are less than the costs of transacting in the market (Cin-house, Cmarket), then the firm should vertically integrate. In the resource-based view of the firm, a firm’s boundaries are delineated by its knowledge bases and competencies. Moving from less integrated to more fully integrated forms of transacting, alternatives include: short-term contracts, strategic alliances (including long-term contracts, equity alliances, and joint ventures), and parent– subsidiary relationships . 8-50\n\n51 Take-Away Concepts (cont’d)\n\nLO 8-3 Describe two types of vertical integration along the industry value chain: backward and forward vertical integration. Vertical integration denotes a firm’s value added—what percentage of a firm’s sales is generated by the firm within its boundaries . Industry value chains (vertical value chains) depict the transformation of raw materials into finished goods and services. Each stage typically represents a distinct industry in which a number of different firms are competing . Backward vertical integration involves moving ownership of activities upstream nearer to the originating (inputs) point of the industry value chain . Forward vertical integration involves moving ownership of activities closer to the end (customer) point of the value chain. 8-51\n\n52 Take-Away Concepts (cont’d)\n\nLO Identify and evaluate benefits and risks of vertical integration. Benefits of vertical integration include: securing critical supplies, lowering costs, improving quality, facilitating scheduling and planning, and facilitating investments in specialized assets. Risks of vertical integration include: increasing costs, reducing quality, reducing flexibility, and increasing the potential for legal repercussions. Vertical integration contributes to competitive advantage if the incremental value created is greater than the incremental costs of the specific corporate-level strategy. LO 8-5 Describe and examine alternatives to vertical integration. Taper integration is a strategy in which a firm is backwardly integrated but also relies on outside market firms for some of its supplies, and/or is forwardly integrated but also relies on outside market firms for some if its distribution. Strategic outsourcing involves moving one or more value chain activities outside the firm’s boundaries to other firms in the industry value chain. Off-shoring is the outsourcing of activities outside the home country. 8-52\n\n53 Take-Away Concepts (cont’d)\n\nLO 8-6 Describe and evaluate different types of corporate diversification. A single-business firm derives 95 percent or more of its revenues from one business. A dominant-business firm derives between 70 and 95 percent of its revenues from a single business, but pursues at least one other business activity. A firm follows a related diversification strategy when it derives less than 70 percent of its revenues from a single business activity, but obtains revenues from other lines of business that are linked to the primary business activity. Choices within a related diversification strategy can be related-constrained or related-linked. A firm follows an unrelated diversification strategy when less than 70 percent of its revenues come from a single business, and there are few, if any, linkages among its businesses. 8-53\n\n54 Take-Away Concepts (cont’d)\n\nLO 8-7 Apply the core competence–market matrix to derive different diversification strategies. When applying an existing/new dimension to core competencies and markets, four quadrants emerge, as depicted in Exhibit 8.8. The lower-left quadrant combines existing core competencies with existing markets. Here, managers need to come up with ideas of how to leverage existing core competencies to improve their current market position. The lower-right quadrant combines existing core competencies with new market opportunities. Here, managers need to think about how to redeploy and recombine existing core competencies to compete in future markets. The upper-left quadrant combines new core competencies with existing market opportunities. Here, managers must come up with strategic initiatives of how to build new core competencies to protect and extend the firm’s current market position . The upper-right quadrant combines new core competencies with new market opportunities. This is likely the most challenging diversification strategy because it requires building new core competencies to create and compete in future markets. 8-54\n\n55 Take-Away Concepts (cont’d)\n\nLO 8-8 Explain when a diversification strategy creates a competitive advantage, and when it does not. The diversification-performance relationship is a function of the underlying type of diversification. The relationship between the type of diversification and overall firm performance takes on the shape of an inverted U (see Exhibit 8.9). In the BCG matrix, the corporation is viewed as a portfolio of businesses, much like a portfolio of stocks in finance (see Exhibit 8.11). The individual SBUs are evaluated according to relative market share and speed of market growth, and plotted into one of four categories (dog, cash cow, star, and question mark). Each category warrants a different investment strategy. Both low levels and high levels of diversification are generally associated with lower overall performance, while moderate levels of diversification are associated with higher firm performance. 8-55"
