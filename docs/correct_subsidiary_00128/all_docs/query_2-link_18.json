Financial details were not disclosed. This transaction is expected to close in August 2007.\n\nOracle noted that it will be uniquely providing next generation of access management, by adding some of the real-time fraud prevention capabilities of Bharosa's Tracker and Authenticator software to its existing web single sign-on and web-based authorization solutions.\n\nThe company added that Bharosa's Tracker and Authenticator software will continue to be available on a standalone basis, with integrations for Oracle and non-Oracle environments as well as integrated with Oracle Identity Management.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com"
