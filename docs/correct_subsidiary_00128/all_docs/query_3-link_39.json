It summarizes 5 identity management systems from IBM, Novell, Sun, Oracle, and CA based on features and capabilities as well as strategy and vision. For each system, it describes key components and functionality. It finds that while systems have strengths in different factors like data management, usability, or architecture, they also have disadvantages around skills requirements, policy management, or integration complexity. The analysis aims to help evaluate and compare identity management options based on the extended taxonomy.",
