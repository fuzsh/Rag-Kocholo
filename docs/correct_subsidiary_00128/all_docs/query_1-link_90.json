Christine\n\n5 GE’s Changing Geographic Scope\n\nRefocusing GE: A Future of Clean-Tech and Health Care? ChapterCase 8 GE’s Changing Geographic Scope 8-5 Source: Author’s depiction of data in GE annual reports. Christine\n\n6 What Is Corporate Strategy?\n\nQuest for competitive advantage when competing in multiple industries Ex: Jeffrey Immelt’s initiative in clean-tech and health care industries Corporate strategy concerns the scope of the firm Industry value chain Products and services Geography 8-6 Christine\n\n7 What Is Corporate Strategy? (cont'd)\n\nThree dimensions that determine the boundaries of the firm . . . vertical integration - the stages of the industry value chain horizontal integration and diversification – the range of products and services the firm should offer global strategy - where in the world to compete These are the fundamental corporate-level strategic decisions. 8-7 Christine\n\n8 Three Dimensions of Corporate Strategy\n\nEXHIBIT 8.1 Three Dimensions of Corporate Strategy Scope of the firm determines boundaries along these 3 dimensions. 8-8 Christine\n\n9 What Is Corporate Strategy? (cont'd)\n\nEconomies of scale The average per-unit cost decreases as its output increases (the larger the market share, the lower the costs) Ex: Anheuser-Busch Inbev largest global brewer Economies of scope Savings that come from producing two or more outputs or providing different services at less cost Ex: Amazon range of products & services Transaction cost The cost associated with economic exchange \"Make or buy\" decision 8-9 Christine\n\n10 Transaction Cost Economics and Scope of the Firm\n\nExplains and predicts the scope of the firm Scope Gain & sustain competitive advantage Formulating corporate strategy In-house vs external market Institutional arrangements SAV 8-12\n\n11 Transaction Cost Economics and Scope of the Firm\n\nTransaction costs Costs associated with economic exchanges Firm OR markets Ex: negotiating and enforcing contracts Administrative costs Organizing an exchange within a hierarchy Recruiting & training Paying salaries and benefits Providing supplies SAV\n\n12 Firms vs. Markets: Make or Buy\n\nIn-house (make)? Or externally (to buy)? If Cin-house < Cmarket, then the firm should vertically integrate Own input production or distribution outputs Ex: Microsoft hires programmers Both distinct advantages and disadvantages SAV 8-13\n\n13 Organizing Economic Activity: Firm vs. Markets\n\nEXHIBIT 8.2 Organizing Economic Activity: Firm vs. Markets INSTRUCTOR: An Interactive video activity is available online through McGraw- Hill Connect on this section of the text. It covers Learning Objective 8.2. SAV 8-14\n\n14 Firms vs. Markets: Make or Buy?\n\nDisadvantage of “make” in-house Principal – agent problem owner = principal, manager = agent Personal interests Disadvantage of “buy” from markets Search cost Opportunism Incomplete contracting Enforce legal contracts SAV 8-15\n\n15 Firms vs. Markets: Make or Buy?\n\nInformation asymmetries Uneven level of knowledge Akerlof – “Lemons problem” for used cars SAV\n\n16 Alternatives of the Make or Buy Continuum\n\nShort-term contacts Competitive bidding process < One-year term Lower prices cost advantages Strategic alliances Facilitate investment without administrative costs Long-term contacts Licensing & franchising Joint ventures Hulu Equity alliances Toyota & Orocobre SAV 8-16\n\n17 Toyota Locks Up Lithium for Car Batteries\n\nSTRATEGY HIGHLIGHT 8.1 Toyota Locks Up Lithium for Car Batteries World demand for lithium-ion batteries for cars Grow from $278 million in ‘09 to $25 billion in 2014 Toyota wants to secure long-term supply of lithium to power its hybrid fleet Orocobre holds exploration rights to a large salt-lake area Upfront investment to extract of lithium is very high Should Orocobre make the investment to supply Toyota? To encourage investment, Toyota took an equity position INSTRUCTOR: A 6-minute video on China’s vital role in the supply of global rare earth metals. In fall of 2010, China restricted exports of the materials. The video was produced by The New York Times in November 2010. shipments-of-rare-earths.html?scp=1&sq=rare%20earth&st=cse China Rare Earth Video SAV 1–18 8-18\n\n18 Alternatives of the Make or Buy Continuum\n\nParent – subsidiary relationship Most integrated alternative Parent has command and control Ex: GM owns Opel and Vauxhall in Europe SAV\n\n19 Vertical Integration along the Industry Value Chain\n\nIn what stages of the industry value chain should the firm participate? Vertical integration Ownership of its inputs, production, & outputs in the value chain Horizontal value chain Transform inputs into outputs, with activities ranging from basic R&D to customer service. 8-19 CECILIA\n\n20 Vertical Integration along the Industry Value Chain\n\nVertical value chain (Industry) Industry-level integration run from upstream to downstream Examples: cell phone industry value chain Many different industries and firms Horizontal value chain (Internal, firm level) Run Horizontally 8-20 CECILIA\n\n21 Backward and Forward Vertical Integration along an Industry Value Chain\n\nEXHIBIT 8.4 INSTRUCTOR: An Interactive activity is available online through McGraw-Hill Connect on this section of the text. It covers Learning Objective 8.3 & 8.4 on types and advantages of vertical integration. 8-21 CECILIA\n\n22 Example: of Vertical Integration is “Cell phone”\n\nStage 1: Raw Materials Chemicals, ceramics, metals, oil, and so on. -DuPont (U.S.), ExxonMobil (U.S.), others. Stage 2: Intermediate goods Components Integrated circuits, displays, touch screens, cameras, and batteries. -Jabil Circuit (U.S.), Intel (U.S.), others. Stage 3: Manufacturing Final Assembly Flextronics (Singapore) or Foxconn (China), others. Stage 4: Marketing Sales Telecommunications companies like Ericsson (Sweden), Motorola (U.S.), Nokia (Finland), others. Stage 5: Service Provider To get wireless data and voice service. -AT&T, Verizon, others. CECILIA\n\n23 Types of Vertical Integration\n\nFull vertical integration Ex: Weyerhaeuser Owns forests, mills, and distribution to retailers The company's operations are divided into three major business segments: 1- Timberlands — Growing and harvesting trees in renewable cycles. 2- Wood Products — Manufacturing and distribution of building materials for homes and other structures. 3- Cellulose Fiber — Research and development, manufacturing and distribution of pulp products. 8-23 CECILIA\n\n24 Types of Vertical Integration\n\nBackward vertical integration -Moving ownership of activities upstream to the originating (inputs) point of the value chain. Forward vertical integration By moving downstream into sales and increasing its branding activities. Moving ownership of activities closer to the end (customer) point of the value chain. 8-24 CECILIA\n\n25 Types of Vertical Integration\n\nNot all industry value chain stages are equally profitable Zara – Vertically Disintegrated— *Primarily designs in-house & partners for speedy new fashions delivered to stores 8-25 CECILIA\n\n26 HTC’s Backward and Forward Integration along the Industry Value Chain in the Smartphone Industry\n\nEXHIBIT 8.5 INSTRUCTOR: An Interactive activity is available online through McGraw-Hill Connect on this section of the text. It covers Learning Objective 8.3 & 8.4 on types and advantages of vertical integration. 8-26 CECILIA\n\n27 Benefits of Vertical Integration\n\nSpecialized assets Assets that have significantly more value in their intended use than in their next best use Types of specialized assets Site specificity Co-located such as mining equipment Physical asset specificity Bottling machinery – different shapes, unique molds Human asset specificity Mastering procedures of a particular organization – not meant to be transferred elsewhere 8-27 Christine\n\n28 Risks of Vertical Integration\n\nIncreasing costs Internal suppliers lose incentives to compete – always a buyer for their products Reducing quality Single captured customer can slow experience effects – external suppliers gain higher learning to develop quality products Reducing flexibility Slow to respond to changes in technology or demand – steel industry went bankrupt Increasing the potential for legal repercussions FTC carefully reviewed Pepsi plans to buy bottlers – vertical integration needs to be carefully considered 8-28 Christine\n\n29 Alternatives to Vertical Integration\n\nTaper integration orchestrates value activities Backward integrated but also relies on outside market firms for supplies OR Forward integrated but also relies on outside market firms for some of its distribution Strategic outsourcing Moving one or more internal value chain activities outside the firm's boundaries Ex: EDS and PeopleSoft provide HR services to many firms that choose to outsource it Another example – support staff in schools 8-29 Christine\n\n30 EXHIBIT 8.6 Taper Integration along the Industry Value Chain\n\nOutside suppliers could also be off-shored when they are not located in the home country 8-30 Christine\n\n31 Corporate Diversification: Expanding Beyond a Single Market\n\nDegrees of diversification Range of products and services a firm should offer Ex: PepsiCo also owns Lay's & Quaker Oats; Coca Cola only specializes in beverages Diversification strategies: Product diversification Active in several different product categories Geographic diversification Active in several different countries Product – market diversification Active in a range of both product and countries 8-31 Christine\n\n32 Types of Corporate Diversification\n\nSingle business Google – 95% or more from one business Dominant business Microsoft – 70 – 95% from single business, also XBox Related diversification Related constrained ExxonMobil – trying to move into another area Related linked Disney – active in a wide array of business activities Unrelated diversification GE – less than 70% comes from a single business; they are all over the place with jet engines, household appliances, TV shows, etc 8-32 Christine\n\n33 Different Types of Diversification\n\nEXHIBIT 8.7 Different Types of Diversification 8-33 Christine\n\n34 Leveraging Core Competencies for Corporate Diversification\n\nUnique skills and strengths Increase perceived value/lower production costs Examples: Walmart – global supply chain Apple - Integration and user experience Infosys – low-cost global delivery system The core competence – market matrix Guidance to diversification strategies Leading to growth SAV 8-37\n\n35 The Core Competence – Market Matrix\n\nEXHIBIT 8.8 The Core Competence – Market Matrix Pepsi - Gatorade Salesforce.com BoA - NCNB BoA - Merrill Lynch SAV 8-38\n\n36 Corporate Diversification\n\nDiversification discount Stock price lowers Diversification premium Stock price is greater INSTRUCTOR: An Interactive activity is available online through McGraw-Hill Connect on this section of the text. It covers Learning Objective 8.8 on the appropriate context of diversification for competitive advantage. SAV 8-39\n\n37 Corporate Diversification (cont'd)\n\nHow does diversification enhance performance? Economies of scale lower the cost Economies of scope increase the value Reduce cost and increase value simultaneously SAV 8-41\n\n38 Vertical Integration and Diversification: Sources of Value Creation and Costs\n\nEXHIBIT 8.10 INSTRUCTOR: An Interactive activity is available online through McGraw-Hill Connect on this section of the text. It covers Learning Objective 8.8 on the appropriate context of diversification for competitive advantage. SAV 8-42\n\n39 Corporate Diversification (cont'd)\n\nRestructuring Reorganizing and divesting business units Refocus and leverage core competencies Boston Consulting Group growth-share matrix Dogs Low-performing Cash cows Low growth/considerable market share Stars High market share/fast growing market Question marks Unclear transformation SAV 8-43\n\n40 EXHIBIT 8.11 BCG Matrix SAV 8-44\n\n41 Corporate Diversification (cont'd)\n\nInternal capital markets Value creation in diversification strategy Efficient allocating of capital Coordination cost A function of number, size, and types of businesses linked to one another Influence cost Political maneuvering by managers to influence capital and resource allocation Bandwagon effects Firms copying moves of industry rivals SAV 8-45\n\n42 Corporate Strategy: Combining Vertical Integration and Diversification\n\nFirms’ corporate strategy Level of integration on value chain AND Level of diversification Ex: Oracle earned $23B in 2009 Enterprise software is core competency Backward integration – Sun Microsystems Forward integration – PeopleSoft Diversification at Oracle: Related – IP management bought Sophoi Unrelated – ID theft bought Bharosa SAV 8-46\n\n43 Oracle Corporate Strategy: Combining\n\nVertical Integration and Diversification EXHIBIT 8.12 SAV 8-47\n\n44 Take-Away Concepts - Review\n\nLO 8-1 Define corporate-level strategy, and describe the three dimensions along which it is assessed. While business strategy addresses “how to compete,” corporate strategy addresses “where to compete”. Corporate strategy concerns the scope of the firm along three dimensions: vertical integration (along the industry value chain); horizontal integration (diversification); and geographic scope (global strategy). CECILIA\n\n45 Take-Away Concepts - Review\n\nLO 8-2 Describe and evaluate different options firms have to organize economic activity. Transaction cost economics help managers decide what activities to do in-house (“make”) versus what services and products to obtain from the external market (“buy”). When the costs to pursue an activity in-house are less than the costs of transacting in the market (Cin-house< Cmarket), then the firm should vertically integrate. Moving from less integrated to more fully integrated forms of transacting, alternatives include: *short-term contracts, *strategic alliances (including long-term contracts, equity alliances, and joint ventures), and *parent–subsidiary relationships . CECILIA\n\n46 Take-Away Concepts - Review\n\nLO 8-3 Describe two types of vertical integration along the industry value chain: backward and forward vertical integration. Industry value chains (vertical value chains) depict the transformation of raw materials into finished goods and services. Each stage typically represents a distinct industry in which a number of different firms are competing . Backward vertical integration involves moving ownership of activities upstream nearer to the originating (inputs) point of the industry value chain . Forward vertical integration involves moving ownership of activities closer to the end (customer) point of the value chain. CECILIA\n\n47 Take-Away Concepts - Review\n\nLO Identify and evaluate benefits and risks of vertical integration. Benefits of vertical integration include: *securing critical supplies, *lowering costs, *improving quality, *facilitating scheduling and planning, and *facilitating investments in specialized assets. Risks of vertical integration include: *increasing costs, *reducing quality, *reducing flexibility, and *increasing the potential for legal repercussions. CECILIA\n\n48 Take-Away Concepts - Review\n\nLO Identify and evaluate benefits and risks of vertical integration. Vertical integration contributes to competitive advantage if the incremental value created is greater than the incremental costs of the specific corporate-level strategy.
