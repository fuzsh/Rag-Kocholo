        "text": "8.2 One-Time Password Risk-Based Challenge Mechanism Concepts\n\nThis section introduces you to the concept of one-time password (OTP) as a risk-based challenge mechanism and how it is used in Oracle Adaptive Access Manager.\n\n8.2.1 About One-Time Password\n\nA one-time password is a randomly generated, single-use authentication credential. OTP is a form of secondary authentication that is used in addition to standard user name and password credentials to strengthen the existing authentication and authorization process, thereby providing additional security for users. When the user is OTP-challenged, a one-time password is generated and delivered to the user through one of the configured channels. The user must retrieve the one-time password and enter it when prompted, before the one-time password expires.\n\nThe one-time password may be either numeric or alphanumeric and any configured length and the randomization algorithm is pluggable.\n\nThe following are major benefits of using out-of-band OTP:\n\nThe OTP is delivered to the valid user through one of the configured channels. These can include SMS, Instant Messaging (IM), and e-mail.\n\nThe user does not require any proprietary hardware or client software of any kind.\n\n8.2.2 About Out-of-Band OTP Delivery\n\nOracle Adaptive Access Manager 11g contains OTP authentication capabilities that support delivery of the OTP via the following three out-of-band channels:\n\ne-mail\n\nShort Message Service (SMS)\n\ninstant messaging\n\nBy default, only cell phone registration is displayed on the OTP Registration page.\n\n8.2.3 How Does OTP Work?\n\nDuring the Registration process in OAAM, the user is asked to register for questions, image, phrase and OTP (e-mail, phone, and so on) if the deployment supports OTP. Once successfully registered, OTP can be used as a secondary authentication to challenge the user.\n\nThe administrator can enable the OTP if the deployment supports OTP. The login process begins with entering standard user name and password credentials. During a session, for example, when the user is making a large transaction, if the user is OTP-challenged, the password is delivered to the user through the configured delivery channel. The user retrieves the one-time password, then enters it.\n\nIf the correct answer is provided, the user is directed to continue with the operation. If the user answers incorrectly, he is allowed other attempts until he either answers correctly or is locked out of his account after a certain number of failures. By default, the user is allowed three attempts to provide the correct answer.\n\n8.2.4 About OTP Failure Counters\n\nThe failure counter is incremented when the user supplies an incorrect answer during a challenge.\n\nOTP failure counters consolidate failures from different channels. For example, if multiple channels are used, the OTP status displays Locked if the combined OTP counters are above the threshold. So, if user failed SMS twice and e-mail once and threshold is 3, the user is locked.\n\nThe Reset Action resets all challenge failure counters:\n\nReset KBA: Re-register KBA; KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero\n\nCSR KBA reset: Re-register KBA; KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero\n\nReset OTP: Re-register OTP; KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero\n\nThe Unlock action unlocks the user account for both KBA and OTP:\n\nUnlock KBA: KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero\n\nUnlock OTP: KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero.\n\n8.2.5 About Challenge Types\n\nThe challenge type is the delivery channel used to send an OTP to challenge the user. For example, policies can challenge using OTP via the challenge type (e-mail, SMS, or IM).\n\nTable 8-1 OTP Challenge Types\n\nChallenge Type Description\n\nChallengeEmail\n\nOTP challenge via e-mail\n\nChallengeSMS\n\nOTP challenge via Short Message Service (SMS)\n\nChallengeIM\n\nOTP challenge via instant messaging\n\nAn integrator can create or configure a challenge type to handle a challenge that is required, such as generating the \"secret\" used for the challenge to delivering the \"secret\" to the user and finally validating the user's input.\n\nThe challenge type properties are used to associate a challenge type with a Challenge Processor, the java code needed to perform any work for challenges.\n\n8.2.6 About KBA vs. OTP\n\nOracle Adaptive Access Manager deployments may choose to use both KBA and OTP or each separately or no challenge mechanisms at all. If both KBA and OTP are being used in a deployment, the security team may choose to use OTP first for high risk situations and then KBA.\n\nFor example, a user logging in from a new IP addresses in a city he often logs in from is relatively low risk on its own, so a KBA challenge is a good option to gain additional verification that this is the valid user. If, however, a user is attempting a funds transfer of more than $1000 using a device and location he has never accessed from previously and the user has never performed a transfer, a stronger measure such as OTP Anywhere would be warranted.\n\nIf a customer has both KBA and OTP enabled, the priority is configurable through properties. The default is to OTP challenge first and then KBA challenge for high risk situations.\n\nFor information on KBA and OTP Anywhere priority, see Table 10-36, \"OAAM Challenge Trigger Combinations\".\n\n8.11 Customizing OTP Registration Text and Messaging\n\nThe registration page text, the challenge type message subject, the body of the message, and the message itself could be fully customized by specifying the custom values in resource bundle files and deploying the changes via OAAM extension shared libraries.\n\nTo customize content and messaging of the registration pages you will add properties, described in the sections following, to the client_resource_locale.properties file.\n\nCreate a work folder called oaam_extensions. (The folder can be created anywhere as long as it is outside the installation folder.)\n\nLocate oracle.oaam.extensions.war, which is located in the IAM_Home/oaam/oaam_extensions/generic directory.\n\nExplode oracle.oaam.extensions.war into the oaam_extensions folder.\n\nCreate a client_resource_locale.properties in IAM_Home\\oaam\\oaam_extensions\\generic\\WEB-INF\\classes.\n\nAdd the customized text and messages to this file.\n\nFor example, to customize the terms and conditions, add the following line to client_resource_locale.properties:\n\nbharosa.uio.default.userinfo.inputs.enum.terms.name=I agree to the COMPANY A terms & conditions. Click to view full <a href=\"javascript:infoWindow('terms');\">Terms & Conditions</a> and <a href=\"javascript:infoWindow('privacy');\">Privacy Policy</a>.\n\nFor example, to customize the message displayed when a user registers his mobile phone, add the following line to client_resource_locale.properties:\n\nbharosa.uio.default.register.userinfo.message=For your protection please enter your mobile telephone number so we may use it to verify your identity in the future. Please ensure that you have text messaging enabled on your phone.\n\nRepackage oracle.oaam.extensions.war from the parent folder of oaam_extensions using the command:\n\njar -cvfm oracle.oaam.extensions.war oaam_extensions\\META-INF\\MANIFEST.MF -C oaam_extensions/ .\n\nShut down the OAAM Admin and OAAM Server managed servers.\n\nStart the WebLogic Server where Oracle Adaptive Access Manager is deployed and log in to the WebLogic Administration Console.\n\nNavigate to Domain Environment, and select Deployments and lock the console.\n\nClick Install.\n\nBrowse to the location of the oracle.oaam.extensions.war file and select it by clicking the radio button next to the WAR file and clicking Next.\n\nSelect deployment targets, OAAM Admin and OAAM Server.\n\nStart the OAAM Admin and OAAM managed servers.\n\n8.11.1 Customizing Terms and Conditions\n\nTo customize the Terms and Condition text, add the following properties to client_resource_locale.properties:\n\nTable 8-17 Messaging of Terms and Conditions\n\nProperty Descriptions\n\nThe value for bharosa.uio.default.userinfo.inputs.enum.terms.name includes placeholder links that use OAAM Server pop up screen messaging for \"Terms & Conditions\" and \"Privacy Policy\". The property and resource keys for the contents of the pop up screens are listed as follows.\n\nTable 8-18 Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy Pop Up Screen Messaging\n\nProperty Descriptions\n\nbharosa.uio.default.messages.enum.terms.name\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nbharosa.uio.default.messages.enum.terms.description\n\nPLACEHOLDER TEXT FOR TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nbharosa.uio.default.messages.enum.privacy.name\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nbharosa.uio.default.messages.enum.privacy.description\n\nPLACEHOLDER TEXT FOR PRIVACY POLICY\n\n8.11.2 Customizing Mobile Input Registration Fields\n\nTo customize mobile input fields, add these properties to client_resource_locale.properties:\n\nTable 8-19 Mobile Input Customization\n\nProperty Default Value Description\n\nbharosa.uio.default.userinfo.inputs.enum.mobile.name\n\nMobile Phone\n\nName for mobile phone field\n\nbharosa.uio.default.userinfo.inputs.enum.mobile.description\n\nMobile Phone\n\nDescription for mobile phone field\n\n8.11.3 Customizing Registration Page Messaging\n\nTo customize the registration page messaging, add the following registration properties to client_resource_locale.properties:\n\nTable 8-20 Registration Customization\n\nProperty Default Value\n\n8.11.4 Customizing Challenge Messaging\n\nTo customize challenge type messaging, add the following properties to client_resource_locale.properties:\n\nTable 8-21 Challenge Type Customization\n\nProperty Default Value\n\n8.11.5 Customizing the OTP Messaging\n\nTo customize OTP messaging, add these properties to client_resource_locale.properties:\n\nNote:\n\nUser facing strings need to be duplicated into resource bundle. Resource bundle values can be customized by adding them to the client_resource_locale.properties and deploying the file in OAAM Extensions Shared Library.\n\nTable 8-22 OTP Messaging Customization\n\nProperty Default Value\n\n8.12 Other Configuration Tasks\n\nIf you want to configure the OAAM Server to connect to multiple UMS servers or change the defaults for expiry time, password generation, failure counter, or challenge type devices for OTP, or configure challenge choice for the user, the procedures are provided in this section for your reference.\n\n8.12.1 Configuring OAAM Server to Connect to Multiple UMS Servers to Send OTP\n\nOAAM Server can be configured to connect to multiple UMS servers individually or via load-balancing to send OTP through. If one UMS server fails, OAAM can still send messages through another UMS server. The order in which OAAM Server tries the UMS server URLs is based on configuration.\n\nYou can specify connection to multiple UMS servers and the order in which they are checked through configuration:\n\nIf the UMS servers use the same credentials, you can specify a comma-separated list of UMS servers (SOA servers) for existing UMS Web Service or UMS Web Service Endpoint URL properties using the OAAM Properties Editor in the OAAM Administration Console. By default, the UMS server properties are typically left empty.\n\nOAAM server attempts to send OTP using UMS server URLs in the order they appear in the list. UMS URL1 is checked first as it appears first in the property, and if it is available, UMS URL1 is used for sending OTP.\n\nIf OAAM tries to send a message, and the first UMS server fails or the URL is invalid, OAAM server tries to send the message using the second URL. If the second UMS server fails or the URL is invalid, OAAM server checks the third URL, and so on down the line. OAAM server keeps trying to send the messages until the message is sent successfully.\n\nWhen multiple UMS servers use different credentials or policies are needed for each UMS server, you can add enumerations to the oaam_custom.properties file in the OAAM Extensions Shared Library to specify multiple user messaging server URLs.\n\nA value must be specified for UMS Web Service Endpoint URL property for the enum to be used. Recommended workaround is to supply the primary UMS server in existing properties and any backups in the enum.\n\nOAAM Server requires a restart after you edit or add the enums.\n\nOAAM server attempts to send OTP using URLs in the order specified by their order attribute.\n\nIf both enums (added to the OAAM Extensions Shared Library) and properties (configured with the Properties Editor) are used together, attempts to send OTP will try the property based URLs first and then the user-defined enums.\n\nFor example, UMS URL1 is checked first as it appears first in the property and if it is available, UMS URL1 is used for sending OTP. If UMS URL1 is unavailable or invalid, the second entry in the property is checked and so on. If after checking all the property-based URLs and if all are unavailable or invalid, OAAM server checks the enum-based URLs. If the enum-based URL is valid, that UMS service is accessed.\n\n8.12.1.1 Specifying a Comma-Separated List for Multiple User Messaging Service URLs\n\nTo specify multiple UMS Server URLs:\n\nLog in to the OAAM Administration Console.\n\nIn the Navigation pane, double-click Properties under the Environment node. The Properties Search page is displayed.\n\nEnter the following in the Name field and click Search.\n\nbharosa.uio.default.ums.integration.useParlayX\n\nClick to select the property in the Search Results section, specify True or False, and click Save.\n\nThis configures the use of Web service or parlayx API. Value is false by default (preferred).\n\nEnter the following in the Name field and click Search.\n\nbharosa.uio.default.ums.integration.webservice\n\nor\n\nbharosa.uio.default.ums.integration.parlayx.endpoint\n\nClick to select the property in the Search Results section, add UMS URL1, URL2, URL3, and so on, in a comma separated list, and click Save.\n\nFor example:\n\nhttp://UMS_server1:UMS-port1/ucs/messaging/webservice, http://UMS_server2:UMS-port2/ucs/messaging/webservice, http://UMS_server3:UMS-port3/ucs/messaging/webservice\n\n8.12.2 Configuring One-Time Password Expiry Time\n\nTo set up OTP SMS password expiry time, add the following property:\n\nbharosa.uio.default.challenge.type.enum.ChallengeSMS.otpexpirytimeMs\n\nTo set up OTP e-mail password expiry time, add the following property:\n\nbharosa.uio.default.challenge.type.enum.ChallengeEmail.otpexpirytimeMs to oaam_custom.properties.\n\nThe time is in milliseconds. If the expiration time you want to set is not in milliseconds, you will have to perform a conversion. For example, if you want to set the expiration time for OTP to be 7 minutes, then you must set the property to 420000 (7 minutes).\n\n8.12.3 Configuring One-Time Password Generation\n\nYou can configure one-time password code generation through properties edits. The following properties are used to generate the OTP code:\n\nbharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.length = 5 bharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters = 1234567890\n\nbharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.length designates the length of the OTP code to generate.\n\nbharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters designates the string of characters that the OTP code can contain.\n\nThe default OTP codes will be 5 characters made up of the numbers 0-9 (for example: 44569).\n\nThe OAAM API randomly chooses any character from the string defined in bharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters to generate the OTP code. If you need an OTP code of 5 characters, the OAAM API will randomly pick one character at a time from the string of declared characters and append them to the OTP string.\n\nFor example, bharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters can contain 1234567890 or abcdefgh or 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz or 1234567890ABCDWXYZ!@#$%^&*.\n\nIf bharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters contains 1234567890ABCDWXYZ!@#$%^&*, the generated OTP code may look like &1A@$ or 12345 or XAW12.\n\nAn example is shown below for generating a 4 character OTP code with numbers 0-9 and letters a-d (for example: 0c6a):\n\nbharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.length = 4 bharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters = 1234567890abcd\n\nYou may require OAAM to generate the same OTP code every time for your testing. In such a case, you can define the bharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters to a two letter string containing just 1 character. For example, if you want OAAM to generate the OTP code 11111 every time, you can define bharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters to 11. Make sure that you have at least 2 characters in the bharosa.uio.default.otp.generate.code.characters property.\n\n8.12.4 Configuring Failure Counter\n\nWhen a user fails the OTP challenge, a counter is updated to indicate that user has had a failure.\n\nThe failure counter is set by default in the OAAM Challenge Policy, but you can customize it by following these instructions:\n\nOpen the OAAM Challenge Policy.\n\nOpen the appropriate maximum failed OTP rule and edit the appropriate properties. For information, refer to the table below.\n\nTable 8-23 OAAM Maximum OTP Failed Rule Details\n\nRule Rule Condition and Parameters Results\n\n8.12.5 Configuring Challenge Type Devices for OTP\n\nIf you want to change the default challenge type devices used for challenges, proceed as follows:\n\nLog in to the OAAM Administration Console.\n\nIn the Navigation pane, double-click Properties under the Environment node. The Properties Search page is displayed.\n\nEnter bharosa.uio.default.use.authentipad.checkpoint in the Name field and click Search.Click to select the property in the Search Results section, change the value to false, and click Save. in the Name field and click Search.\n\nClick New Property to add a new property:\n\nbharosa.uio.default.ChallengeType.authenticator.device=Device\n\nThen click Save to save the property.\n\nExamples of configuring SMS and Email challenges to use the device textpad are shown below:\n\nbharosa.uio.default.ChallengeSMS.authenticator.device=DeviceTextPad bharosa.uio.default.ChallengeEmail.authenticator.device=DeviceTextPad\n\nTable 8-24 describes the properties for the various authentication device types. In the example, the SMS and e-mail authenticators will be the device text pad since the value, DeviceTextPad, was specified. If DeviceKeyPadAlpha was specified as the value, an alphanumeric KeyPad would be displayed.\n\nTable 8-24 Authentication Device Type\n\nProperty Description\n\nAfter configuration, the OTP device will be displayed at the next log in to the application.\n\n8.12.6 Configuring Challenge Choice\n\nOAAM can be enabled to let the end-user decide by what means the user wishes to authenticate if the user is registered for OTP via SMS and also registered for OTP via Email.\n\nThe Challenge checkpoint determines which mechanism to use to challenge the user. When \"ChallengeChoice\" and at least one other challenge type (ChallengeEmail, ChallengeSMS, and so on) is configured in the result of the Challenge checkpoint the user will be given a choice of the challenge type.\n\nThe challenge choice page includes a description of the challenge type and any data present in the display list for that challenge type. The data will be masked according to the mask regex defined for the user info element in the enum.\n\nOnce the user selects a challenge type he will be challenged with that type. He will also be provided a link on the challenge page to return to the challenge choice selection page. However if the user reaches his challenge counter limit for any particular type of challenge he will be logged out and taken to the login/error page indicating the error.\n\n8.12.6.1 Configuring Challenge Choice Messaging\n\nTo configure challenge choice messaging, add the following properties to oaam_uio.properties:\n\nTable 8-25 Challenge Choice Type Messaging Configuration\n\nProperty Default Value\n\nTo configure challenge type links, add the following properties to oaam_uio.properties:\n\nTable 8-26 Challenge Choice Page Links\n\nProperty Default
