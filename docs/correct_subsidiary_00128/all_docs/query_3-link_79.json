OTP Anywhere allows end users to authenticate themselves by entering a server generated one-time-password (OTP). When the OTP is sent via SMS, the user's cell phone serves as a physical second factor that the user has in their possession. As well, the authentication is being sent out-of-band to increase the level of assurance that only the valid user has access to the one-time password.\n\nBenefits of OTP Anywhere are:\n\nIt is built on 11g Challenge Processor framework\n\nOut of the box integration with Oracle User Messaging Service\n\nCustomizable registration user interface\n\nOptional Opt-Out functionality\n\nEmail and SMS supported delivery channels\n\nThis chapter contains these sections:"
