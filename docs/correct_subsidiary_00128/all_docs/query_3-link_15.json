        "text": "Turns on/off user information for Agent case, which are not in the Escalated status.\n\nWhen an OAAM Agent Case is autogenerated from the Configurable Action, the User Details panel is populated with user details for the session for which the case was created. When manually creating a case and linking to a session, user details can be populated. As a result, subsequent searches of cases by Username or User ID can locate manually created cases.\n\nThe Agent case creation page can optionally accept entry of a valid Username and/or User ID if the oaam.customercare.agent.case.allow.userinfo property is set to true. If a Username and/or User ID is entered it is mapped to the Agent case. Agent cases with a mapped Username and/or User ID are searchable by Username and/or User ID. These cases display the mapped user identifier in the Username and/or User ID column on the search cases page.\n\nEnables/disables autolearning post processing if you do not want to change the client code. Setting this property to true results in autolearning processing for the authentication type of updateAuthStatus requests if the status is SUCCESS for that authentication request. However if the status is not SUCCESS, autolearning does not occur. Running autolearning rules with this property set to false runs the rules on the data that is stale. If this property is set to false and autolearning rules are running, and if the log level is set to \"debug\" for \"com.bharosa.vcrypt.tracker.rules.impl.VCryptTrackerAutoLearningImpl\" class; then a message is written to the log saying that this property is disabled and rules are still being run.\n\nUse this property when the client code does not explicitly call the autolearning API.\n\nEnable this property if you want autolearning (post processing) to occur but do not want to change the client code. Setting this property to true results in autolearning processing for updateTransactionStatus requests if the status is SUCCESS for that transaction request. However if the status is not SUCCESS, autolearning does not occur. Running autolearning rules with this property set to false runs the rules on the data that is stale. If this property is set to false and you have autolearning rules running, and if the log level is set to \"debug\" for the \"com.bharosa.vcrypt.tracker.rules.impl.VCryptTrackerAutoLearningImpl\" class; a message is written to the log saying that this property is disabled and rules are still running.\n\nIf set to true, the user name will be stored as typed into the User Name field when creating CSR cases. The user name is case sensitive.\n\nIf set to false, the user name will be in lower case regardless of the actual case that was typed into the User Name field when creating CSR cases.\n\nThe values for the Notes column in the Logs tab for notes that are not added by the user will appear in English by default.\n\nThe notes are taken from the action enums \"note\" field (property).The value of that property is saved into database (as notes). After it is saved, users cannot change that data.\n\nImplementations can customize the \"note\" in the enum property to the localized value.\n\n\"Access case\" is inside the oaam_resources.properties file:\n\ncustomercare.case.actiontype.enum.accesscase.description=Access case\n\nCase creation / access logic will use that string for the creating records after that point.\n\nEnables device registration. Adds text and a check box to the bottom of the challenge page if the property is set to true. When a user is challenged, the check box and text would allow him to register the current device (if it is not already registered). If the device is already registered for that user, the option will not appear unless the user unregisters the device in user preferences.\n\nConfigures the HTTP request parameter key that the integration processor will use to try to read AppId from when entering OAAM entry point.\n\nAccess Manager, for example, can be set up to send an AppId via the challenge URL. This allows for the key to be customized.\n\noaam.server.integration.app_id.param=mykey\n\nwould allow it to be sent as\n\noamLogin.jsp?mykey=myappid\n\nControls the minimum number of questions in a category that must exists before changes can be made to a question in the category. The default is 5. You cannot edit questions in a category if the number of questions in the category is below the minimum. For example, you cannot change the locale for a question unless there are at least 5 other questions for that locale in that category.\n\nSets up OTP SMS password expiry time. The time is in milliseconds. If the value is not in milliseconds, you will have to perform a conversion. For example, if you want to set the expiration time for OTP to be 7 minutes, then you must set the property to 420000 (7 minutes)\n\nSets up OTP Email password expiry time. The time is in milliseconds. If the value is not in milliseconds, you will have to perform a conversion. For example, if you want to set the expiration time for OTP to be 7 minutes, then you must set the property to 420000 (7 minutes)\n\nThe Auto-learning feature tracks transactions and authentications being performed by different actors based on patterns you create. This process establishes what is \"normal\" or average behavior for an individual or a population. By default, Auto-learning collects data for hourly, daily granularity that is not used by the out-of-the-box patterns. If there are no custom patterns that use hourly, daily granular data, then that data collection can be disabled by setting the properties to false. Note: When auto-learning is disabled, no pattern-based risk analysis will be performed. Consider this before you disable auto-learning as the risk analysis may be an important part of your data collection.\n\nEnables use of the \"X-Forwarded-For\" IP, set this property to true. OAAM does not use the header IP by default.\n\nWhen using OAAM with LBR and SNAT enabled, the client IP address needs to be preserved. This is critical since OAAM relies on the client IP Address when evaluating policies.\n\nMake sure the following OAAM properties are set as follows:\n\nvcrypt.tracker.ip.detectProxiedIP=true\n\nbharosa.ip.header.name=X-Forwarded-For\n\nFor information on load balancers preserving the Client IP Addresses, see the \"Preparing the Network for an Enterprise Deployment\" chapter in Enterprise Deployment Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management.\n\nPending Activation\n\nThe user started registration, but has not completed it. He has entered his user name and password and his information has been stored in the database, but he will not be activated until he has completed registration. The user is available in the system, but he is not yet active and cannot perform any operations.\n\nBlocked\n\nIf a user is \"Blocked,\" it is because a policy has found certain conditions to be \"true\" and is set up to respond to these conditions with a \"Block Action.\" If those conditions change, the user may no longer be \"Blocked.\" The \"Blocked\" status is not necessarily permanent and therefore may or may not require an administrator action to resolve. For example, if the user was blocked because he was logging in from a blocked country, but he is no longer in that country, he may no longer be \"Blocked.\"\n\nSpecifies the user name to be in lowercase if set to false\n\nBy default this property is set to true.\n\nWhen it is set to true, the user name is always in lower case. If it is set to false, the user name is taken as is.\n\nFor example:\n\nmyusername\n\nMyUserName\n\nmyUserName\n\nIf property is true (default), all of these are the same user and will appear in the OAAM Administration Console as \"myusername\".\n\nIf property is false, all of these are different users and will appear in the OAAM Administration Console as entered."
