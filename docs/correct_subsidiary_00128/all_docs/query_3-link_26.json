        "text": "New Delhi, June 28, 2024: Bharti Airtel (‘Airtel’) has maintained that the mobile Average Revenue per User (ARPU) needs to be upwards of INR 300, to enable a financially healthy business model for Telcos in India. We believe that this level of ARPU will enable the substantial investments required in network technology and spectrum and offer a modest return on capital.\n\nIn this light, we welcome the announcements in the industry to repair tariffs. Airtel will also revise its mobile tariffs as indicated below, from July 3rd. We have ensured that there is a very modest price increase (less than 70p per day) on the entry level plans, in order to eliminate any burden on budget challenged consumers.\n\nNote: All customers on 2GB per day and above plans can enjoy unlimited 5G data\n\nThese prices apply to all circles, including Bharti Hexacom Ltd. Circles.\n\nThe new tariffs for all Airtel plans will be available on www.airtel.in starting July 3rd , 2024.\n\nAbout Airtel\n\nHeadquartered in India, Airtel is a global communications solutions provider with over 500 Mn customers in 17 countries across South Asia and Africa. The company ranks amongst the top three mobile operators globally and its networks cover over two billion people.
