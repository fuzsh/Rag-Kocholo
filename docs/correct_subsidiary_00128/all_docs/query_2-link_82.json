If you are using an UIO proxy deployment, the property should be set to true. To configure custom branding for multitenancy with the OAAM Proxy, the property bharosa.uio.proxy.mode.flag must be set to true.\n\nIn the META-INF folder, create a file named MANIFEST.MF and ensure it contains the following lines:\n\nExtension-Name: oracle.oaam.extensions Specification-Version:99.9.9.9.9 Implementation-Version:99.9.9.9.9\n\nThe specification version and implementation version must be more than the versions in the file currently. For example, if the implementation version in the file is 11.1.1.3.0, you could change it to 99.9.9.9.9. Errors are thrown if the verion is not incremented.\n\nAdd custom properties to a file named bharosa_server.properties and save it in the oaam_extensions\\WEB-INF\\classes\\bharosa_properties directory.\n\nInformation about enums are provided in Section 7.3, \"User-Defined Enumerations.\""
