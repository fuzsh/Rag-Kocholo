        "text": "After three very productive years at the Oberholtzer Foundation that were overlaid by a pandemic, a drought, and a historic flood at our historic site in Rainy Lake, I have decided that it is time to make way for the next Executive Director. As an organization, we accomplished so much over the last three years! We subscribed to a CRM to make our communications with supporters more efficient, and implemented accounting software to maintain our financial records. We expanded our base of supporters, increased donations to the foundation, and grew both endowment funds. We reviewed and updated our bylaws and policies, and this last year we worked to update our strategic plan. We began the important step of attracting the next generation of leaders on the board, board committees, and in our ranks of volunteers. We are now in the process of setting up a library with a quarter of our book collection in International Falls, including a research room next door. We successfully made it through a historic flood; all of our historic buildings are intact and we saved everything in our collections from the flood waters. After taking a vacation to Costa Rica this last November, I realized it was a good time to make way for a new Executive Director. I wanted to let you all know that I am open to new opportunities after March 30 and am excited about the future!"
