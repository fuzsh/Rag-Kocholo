        "text": "2 Setting Up the OAAM Environment\n\nThis chapter presents details on setting up the Oracle Adaptive Access Manager environment for first time users. When you install Oracle Adaptive Access Manager, you install the binary files, such as executable files, JAR files, and libraries. Then, you use configuration tools to configure the software.\n\nFor information on how to upgrade an existing Oracle Adaptive Access Manager to Oracle Adaptive Access Manager 11g Release 2 (11.1.2), see Upgrade Guide for Oracle Identity and Access Management.\n\nThis chapter contains the following sections:\n\nAbout Setting Up the Base Environment\n\nPrerequisites for Setting Up the OAAM Base Environment\n\nSetting Up the CLI Environment\n\nSetting Up Encryption and Database Credentials\n\nCreating OAAM Users\n\nImporting the OAAM Snapshot\n\nImporting IP Location Data\n\nSetting the Time Zone Used for All Time Stamps in the OAAM Administration Console\n\nSetting a Limit to the Number of Result Rows in the OAAM Administration Console (Optional)\n\nEnabling One-Time Password\n\nSecuring OAAM Web Service Access\n\n2.7 Importing IP Location Data\n\nIP location data is used by risk policies to determine the risk of fraud associated with a given IP address (location).\n\nTo be able to determine location of the login or transaction, this data must be uploaded to an OAAM database. For information on loading the data into the OAAM database, see Section 27.2, \"Importing IP Location Data.\"\n\n2.9 Setting a Limit to the Number of Result Rows in the OAAM Administration Console (Optional)\n\nThe oracle.oaam.db.query.maxrows property allows you to set a limit to the number of result rows. The default value for this parameter is 0. This value should never be set to be smaller than 100 or smaller than the number of members in your largest group with a full cache policy.\n\n2.10 Enabling One-Time Password\n\nOTP Anywhere is a secondary risk-based challenge solution consisting of a server generated one-time password (OTP) delivered to an end user via a configured out of band channel. Supported OTP delivery channels include short message service (SMS), e-mail, and instant messaging.\n\nFor information on enabling OTP, see Section 8, \"Setting Up OTP Anywhere.\""
