        "text": "7.1 Knowledge-Based Authentication Concepts\n\nThis section describes knowledge-based authentication (KBA) key concepts. It contains the following topics:\n\nAbout Knowledge-Based Authentication\n\nAbout KBA User Flows\n\nAbout KBA Registration\n\nAbout the Challenge Response Process\n\nAbout Challenge Response Configuration\n\nAbout Challenge Questions\n\nAbout the Question Set\n\nAbout KBA Registration Logic\n\nAbout Answer Logic\n\nAbout Failure Counters\n\nAbout KBA Resets\n\nAbout the Locked Status\n\n7.1.1 About Knowledge-Based Authentication\n\nOracle Adaptive Access Manager provides as standard secondary authentication in the form of knowledge-based authentication (KBA). KBA is a secondary authentication method, an extension to the existing authentication method. It is presented after successful primary authentication (for example, a user entering a single factor credentials, such as a user name and password) to improve authentication strength.\n\nKBA provides an infrastructure for:\n\nUsers to select challenge questions and provide answers which are used to challenge them later on\n\nKBA is used to authenticate an individual based on the user's answers substantiated by a real-time interactive question and answer process.\n\nLevels of logic algorithm for registration\n\nRegistration Logic manages the registration of challenge questions and answers.\n\nLevels of logic algorithm for answers\n\nAnswer Logic is made up of advanced matching algorithms (fuzzy logic) used by the system to intelligently detect the correct answers in the challenge response process. The algorithms and the level of Answer Logic are factors in evaluating answers.\n\nValidations\n\nValidations are used to validate the answers given by a user at the time of registration.\n\nKBA is used during online authentication of the user, which is automated, or a CSR challenge where the CSR interacts with the user to authenticate him before providing CSR services.\n\n7.1.2 About KBA User Flows\n\nThe following sections illustrate an example user experience with the KBA framework.\n\nNew User Registration\n\nThe user is presented with a page in which he is asked to submit his user name.\n\nThe user is prompted to enter his password. Since a profile has not been registered, a generic textpad is displayed. It does not contain an image or phrase, but it does contain a timestamp.\n\nThe user fills in the password and clicks Enter on the device. OAAM verifies the user's password.\n\nIf the user is not register, he sees a registration information page that describes the registration process.\n\nHe can continue through the registration process or \"skip\" registration and perform the process at another time.\n\nThe next step in the registration process is the selection of an image and phrase. The user may click the link to Get a new image and phrase, which will generate a new image and phrase.\n\nNext the user is required to select challenge questions from the drop-down lists (menus) provided, and enter the answers to those questions in the authentication device. His selected image and phrase is embedded in the device along with a current timestamp of his local time zone.\n\nAfter the challenge questions are selected and answers are provided, the user is logged in to the system.\n\nUser Logs in from Different Location\n\nThe following screens illustrate an example of the user flow when he logs in using a different IP address and he is challenged.\n\nThe user is presented with a page in which he is asked to submit his user name.\n\nIf the user name is accepted and the user is allowed to proceed, he is presented with a password page which contains his selected image and phrase embedded in the device along with a current timestamp of his local time zone.\n\nThe user fills in the password and clicks Enter on the device. OAAM verifies the user's password. Since OAAM determined the session requires an additional challenge/response for authentication because of the user's location, one of the questions he had selected in registration is displayed. The Challenge Question Authentication Pad device has phishing image and phrase embedded along with a current timestamp.\n\nThe user answers the challenge question correctly and is then logged in to the system.\n\n7.1.3 About KBA Registration\n\nDuring registration, which could be enrollment, opening a new account, or another events such as a reset, the user is asked to select questions and provide answers. The order of questions that are presented to a user during the registration phase is random using configurable parameters.\n\nLater on, the challenge questions selected at registration or during a reset may be used for challenge during high risk log ins, to access transactions, or sensitive information, or both, and so on. Oracle Adaptive Access Manager's Rules Engine and business rules are responsible for determining if it is appropriate to use challenge questions to authenticate the user.\n\n7.1.4 About the Challenge Response Process\n\nThe KBA solution consists of securing an application using a challenge/response process where users are challenged with one or more questions to provide identity before they are allowed to proceed with their requested sign-on, transaction, service, and so on.\n\n7.1.5 About Challenge Response Configuration\n\nThe challenge/response process is controlled by a combination of properties and rules.\n\nQuestion presented at random or round robin\n\nPresentation logic (random versus round robin) is configurable through properties. If the deployment supports Oracle Identity Manager integration, the presentation is round robin. The user is expected to answer all the registered questions online.\n\nThe number of attempts a user is allowed for each question is set by a property.\n\nThe total number of KBA challenge failures a user is allowed before he is locked out by Oracle Adaptive Access Manager is configured in the rule condition, User: Challenge Channel Failure.\n\n7.1.6 About Challenge Questions\n\nThe customer can configure a set of questions that are used to authenticate users. The questions are grouped into several categories and the user can select questions from these categories. The standard categories that questions can be grouped into are listed.\n\nThe customer can configure questions from these categories.\n\nChildhood\n\nSports\n\nYour Birth\n\nParents, Grandparents, Siblings\n\nAutomobile\n\nEducation\n\nChildren\n\nYour Employment\n\nSignificant Other\n\nPets\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nDuring registration, users are presented with several question menus. For example, he may be presented with three question menus. A user must select one question from each menu and enter answers for them during registration. Only one question from each question menu can be registered. These questions become the user's \"registered questions.\"\n\nWhen rules in OAAM Admin trigger challenge questions, the application displays the challenge questions and accepts the answers in a secure way for users. The questions can be presented in the QuestionPad, TextPad, and other pads, where the challenge question is embedded into the image of the authenticator, or simple HTML. These are configured through properties.\n\n7.1.7 About the Question Set\n\nKBA offers a large pool of questions, which is the framework for obtaining answers from the user during registration or reset. The Question Set is a fixed set of questions that is allotted to the user. This set is allotted at random and once for the user unless it is reset. It is generated based on the settings configured in the Registration Logic. This Question Set prevents any single user from having access to all the challenge questions. This is to prevent a fraudster from harvesting questions for use in a phishing exercise. A user can receive a new Question Set if a customer service representative resets it for the user.\n\n7.1.8 About KBA Registration Logic\n\nRegistration Logic manages the registration of challenge questions and answers. During KBA registration each user is presented with a Question Set, a subset of the challenge questions library. The Question Set is generally broken up into several drop-down lists that contain questions to select from. The drop-down lists with questions is called a \"menu.\"\n\nFigure 7-1 shows the challenge questions registration drop-down menus.\n\nFigure 7-1 Challenge Questions Registration Drop-Down Menus\n\nDescription of \"Figure 7-1 Challenge Questions Registration Drop-Down Menus\"\n\nThe number of questions that appear on each menu, the number of categories per menu, and the number of questions that a user must register are configurable. As standard, questions are grouped into categories. The challenge questions in the questions menus do not change unless the question set is changed. The user is required to select one question from each menu and enter answers for them. Only one question from each question menu can be registered.\n\nTo configure the Registration Logic, you specify the settings for:\n\nThe question set generation\n\nThe number of questions to be registered\n\nThe number of questions per menu\n\nThe number of categories per menu\n\nThe Question Set is generated based on the Registration Logic.\n\nThe validations that are applied to the answers\n\nFor information on setting Registration Logic, see Section 7.3.7, \"Configuring Registration Logic.\"\n\nHow do the KBA Registration Logic Settings Affect a Customer's Question Set?\n\nExample configurations are presented in the following table.\n\nExample Question/Menu Categories/Menu Questions/Category in a Menu 1 7 4 2+2+2+1 2 10 4 3+3+2+2 3 10 1 10\n\nExample #1, shown on line 1, results in registration menus containing 2 questions from category A, and 2 questions from category B, and 2 questions from category C, and 1 question from category D. This continues in a round robin fashion as needed. If there are any categories with an insufficient number of questions or an insufficient number of categories duplicate questions can result. This scenario does not occur with the standard database of questions and default settings. It only occurs if you significantly reduce the questions or categories.\n\nThe following is an example of a configuration to avoid:\n\nNumber of questions user registers: 3\n\nThe number of questions that a user must register. The new user registration should display the same number of question menus as the number of questions that a user must register.\n\nNumber of questions per menu: 5\n\nThe number of questions that appear on each menu. The new user registration should display the same number of questions in each menu as the number of categories for each menu. The total number of questions from all the menus (number of questions multiplied by the questions in each menu) cannot exceed the total number of questions available in the database.\n\nNumber of categories per menu: 5\n\nThe number of categories per menu. The new user registration should display the same number of categories for each menu as the number of questions in each menu.\n\nThe Question Set is the fixed set of questions that is allotted to the user. This set is allotted at random and once for the user. This prevents the user from discovering all the questions. In the example, fifteen or more categories are required, each with at least one question enabled. But if there are fewer than 15 categories and one of these categories has only one question enabled, some Question Sets have that question twice. The algorithm tries to use as many available categories as possible.\n\nFor example to generate a Question Set with:\n\n3 menus\n\n5 questions per menu\n\n5 categories per menu\n\nThe algorithm tries to pick one question each from 15 categories if 15 categories are available. The minimum number of questions per category should be equal to the number of questions in the Question Set divided by the total number of categories.\n\nPre-requisite for Configuring Registration Logic for Locales\n\nThe deployment administrator must ensure that there are enough questions in the database for each of the supported locale as configured in OAAM Admin during deployment; otherwise, the application displays only the English language questions during registration.\n\nThe number of locale-specific questions must be equal to or greater than the \"Questions User Will Register\" multiplied by the \"Questions per Menu\" multiplied by the \"Categories per Menu.\"\n\n7.1.9 About Answer Logic\n\nAnswer Logic checks to see if the answer provided by the user matches closely to the ones provided during registration.\n\nAnswer Logic is made up of advanced matching algorithms used by the system to intelligently detect the correct answers in the challenge response process. The algorithms and the levels of logic are factors in evaluating answers.\n\nErrors can be caused by simple input errors such as fat fingering, extra characters, misspellings, and so on. Common misspellings and abbreviations for example can be accepted if the basic information of the answer is correct.\n\nAnswer Logic algorithms are available for both the online challenge and CSR phone challenge processes. Online settings are applied for answers the user provided online using the application. Phone challenge settings are applied for answers provided by users over the phone and entered by the CSR. The online challenge and CSR phone challenge Answer Logic are completely independent of each other. They can be configured separately.\n\nFor example, you can set the online challenge logic strength to high and the CSR phone challenge logic strength to low. For the CSR phone challenge logic strength, you may have provided more margin for error, because CSRs are listening to the answers over the phone and entering the answers.\n\n7.1.10 About Failure Counters\n\nFailure counters are used to lock out fraudsters so that they are unable to obtain the answers/questions.\n\nKBA uses two failure counters. They are:\n\nthe Online Counter\n\nthe Phone Counter\n\nThe maximum number for online challenges and phone challenges are configurable. The phone counter maximum is \"per question.\"\n\nFor the following example, assume:\n\nMax online = 3\n\nMax phone (per question) = 3\n\nIf the user is answering challenge questions online, and if the user is given three attempts to provide a correct answer, a total of three attempts is allowed. Each failure increments the Online Counter. The user is locked out of the session after three attempts. The online only challenge is designed to limit the exposure of questions to fraudsters.\n\nIf the user is answering challenge questions over the phone, and if the user is given three attempts at answering each question, a total of nine attempts is allowed. Each failure increments the Phone Counter. The user is locked out of the session after nine attempts.\n\nFor the next challenge, the next question is displayed. A success for an online or a phone challenge automatically resets all counters to zero.\n\n7.1.11 About KBA Resets\n\nAuthenticator uses questions as additional credentials to help prevent fraud. A customer service representative (CSR) can reset these questions for the user when necessary. The CSR can reset KBA-related items for a user.\n\nThe Reset action resets all challenge failure counters:\n\nReset KBA: The customer must re-register KBA; KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero\n\nCSR KBA reset: The customer must re-register KBA; KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero\n\nReset OTP: The customer must re-register OTP; KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero\n\n7.1.11.1 Reset Challenge Questions\n\nThe CSR resets a user's challenge questions. The system deletes the existing questions and answers and generates a new question set for the user to register from. Registration of challenge questions is required at the next log in to the website.\n\n7.1.11.2 Reset Challenge Questions and the Set of Questions to Choose From\n\nThe CSR resets the user's challenge question set (challenge questions and the set of questions to register from). Registration of challenge questions is required at the next log in to the website.\n\n7.1.11.3 Increment User to the Next Question\n\nThe CSR resets the user's next question so the system advances the user to the next challenge question in the list of registered questions. If the user is currently being asked question A, question B or C is now asked. A different challenge question is presented at the next log in to the website.\n\n7.1.11.4 Unlock a User\n\nWhen the CSR unlocks the user that has been locked out of the system because of failed challenge questions. Unlocking the user resets the user's failure counter.\n\nThe Unlock action unlocks the user account for both KBA and OTP:\n\nUnlock KBA: KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero\n\nUnlock OTP: KBA and OTP counters are reset to zero.\n\n7.1.11.5 Ask Question (KBA Phone Challenge)\n\nThe CSR uses the user's challenge questions for phone authentication and enters user's response. If the user answers the question correctly, the question failure counter and increment question counter are reset. The system automatically takes appropriate action depending on the status such as unlocking the user. Information about phone and online failures is provided in Section 7.1.10, \"About Failure Counters.\" High level flows for the Ask Question action is presented in Chapter 4, \"Managing Customer Service Representative Cases.\" The matrix in Section 7.1.10, \"About Failure Counters\" contains detailed examples for individual flows.\n\n7.1.12 About the Locked Status\n\nLocked is the status that OAAM Admin sets if the user fails the maximum number of challenges. A user is locked out of the session after the failure counter reaches the maximum number of failures. After the user is locked out, a Customer Service Representative must reset the status to Unlocked before the user can use this account to enter the system.\n\n7.3 Roadmap to Setting Up KBA\n\nTable 7-1 lists the tasks required to set up KBA with OAAM.\n\nTable 7-1 Setting Up KBA\n\nNo. Task Information\n\n7.3.1 Importing the OAAM Snapshot\n\nA full snapshot of policies, dependent components and configurations is shipped with Oracle Adaptive Access Manager. The snapshot is in the oaam_base_snapshot.zip file and located in the MW_HOME/IDM_ORACLE_HOME/oaam/init directory.\n\nThe challenge questions must be present in Oracle Adaptive Access Manager before the users can be asked to register. Challenge questions are included in the OAAM snapshot. For information on importing the snapshot which contains the questions, see Section 2.6, \"Importing the OAAM Snapshot.\"\n\nIf you need to use challenge questions in languages other than English, import the appropriate oaam_kba_questions_locale.zip files from the MW_HOME/IDM_ORACLE_HOME/oaam/kba_questions directory. The locale identifier locale specifies the language version. Follow the steps in \"Importing Challenge Questions.\"\n\n7.3.2 Setting KBA Properties\n\nKBA properties for enabling KBA and registration, controlling the listing of questions, and randomizing questions are listed in this section. For information on accessing properties, see Chapter 26, \"Using the OAAM Properties Editor.\"\n\n7.3.2.1 Enabling KBA\n\nEnsure that the bharosa.kba.active property is set to true. See Chapter 26, \"Using the OAAM Properties Editor\" for information on modifying properties.\n\n7.3.2.2 Disabling KBA\n\nTo disable KBA:\n\nSet property bharosa.kba.active to false.\n\nDisable all rules that reference KBA, in particular the \"Register Questions\" rule in the \"OAAM Registration Policy\".\n\nDefer forgot password to OIM by setting the following properties to point to the OIM URL for forgot password.\n\nFor split login (default):\n\nbharosa.uio.default.password.links.enum.forgotpassword.url\n\nFor single login page:\n\nbharosa.uio.default.singlelogin.links.enum.forgotpassword.url\n\nNote that with this configuration OAAM cannot use any KBA challenge flows.\n\nTo set up the OIM side, see \"System Properties in Oracle Identity Manager\" in Administering Oracle Identity Manager.\n\n7.3.2.4 Randomizing Challenge Questions\n\nSet the oaam.kba.questions.randomorder property to true to present challenge questions in random order instead of sequentially. Randomization is performed Online only (OAAM Server) if the oaam.kba.questions.randomorder property is missing or is set to true. For the CSR Get Challenge Question flow, question access will always be sequential.\n\n7.3.2.5 Moving Question Sequentially on Successful Answers\n\nSet the oaam.kba.questions.randomorder property to false to move challenge questions in sequentially on successful answers.\n\n7.3.3 Configuring Policies and Rules for Registration and Challenge\n\nPolicies in the Challenge checkpoint determine the type of challenge to present the user. For more information, refer to Section 10.6.12, \"OAAM Challenge.\"\n\nTo configure a policy with a rule that KBA-challenge users for specific scenarios, perform the following steps:\n\nLog in to the OAAM Administration Console.\n\nDouble-click Policies in the Navigation pane.\n\nThe Policies Search page displays.\n\nIn the Policies Search page, search for the OAAM Registration Policy.\n\nFor information on the OAAM Registration Policy, see Section 10.6.11, \"OAAM Registration.\"\n\nClick OAAM Registration Policy and then the Rules tab.\n\nClick Register Questions.\n\nIn the Register Question rule page, select Active for Rule Status and then click Apply.\n\nIn the Policies Search page, search for the OAAM Challenge Policy.\n\nFor information on the OAAM Challenge Policy, see Section 10.6.12, \"OAAM Challenge.\"\n\nClick OAAM Challenge Policy and then the Rules tab.\n\nClick Maximum failed Questions attempts.\n\nIn the Maximum failed Questions attempt rule page, select Active for Rule Status and then click Apply.\n\nClick Conditions and configure the number of attempts the user can make before he is challenged.\n\nClick the Results tab.\n\nSelect OAAM Challenge as the Action Group and then click Apply.\n\n7.3.4 Linking Policies to User Groups\n\nLink policies that pertain to your business and security needs to a user group to which you want KBA to be enabled. For information on linking policies to a user group, see Section 11.4, \"Linking a Policy to All Users or a User ID Group.\"\n\n7.3.5 Configuring Validation for Answer Registration\n\nGlobal validations control the answers a user is allowed to register for all questions. Global validations influence all answer registration. For example, if the \"Four-digit year (YYYY)\" validation is applied globally then only numeral answers are accepted during KBA registration. This would be a problem if there are questions available to users that would normally have alphanumeric answers.\n\nGlobal validations are specified during the configuration of Registration Logic.\n\nTo add global validations (validations you want to apply to all questions):\n\nIn the Navigation tree, double-click Registration Logic under KBA. The Registration Logic page is displayed.\n\nClick Add on the results header.\n\nThe Add Global Validation dialog appears.\n\nFigure 7-2 Add Global Validation\n\nDescription of \"Figure 7-2 Add Global Validation\"\n\nIn the Add Global Validation dialog, search for the global validations you want to add.\n\nSelect the row corresponding to the validation you want to add.\n\nYou cannot select more than one validation to add at a time.\n\nClick Add.\n\nThe selected validation is added.\n\n7.3.6 Configuring Answer Logic (Level of Exactness in Challenge Answers)\n\nAnswer Logic, a feature of KBA, increases the usability of challenge questions. Administrators can adjust how exact the challenge answers given by end users must match the answers they gave at the time of registration. If the answer given by a user is fundamentally correct but there are minor variations such as typos, misspellings and abbreviations they should pass. The increased usability of KBA reduces or eliminates the need for unnecessary call center involvement in moderate risk situations and self service flows.\n\nAnswer Logic (fuzzy logic) algorithms can be configured on the Answer Logic page. The algorithms are divided into three categories: Common Abbreviations, Fat Fingering (accidentally pressing the nearest neighbor on the keyboard), and Phonetics. The algorithms are available for both the online challenge and phone challenge processes.\n\nThe following algorithms are available and can be configured for your requirements:\n\nPhonetics\n\nMissing character(s)\n\nExtra character(s)\n\nCommon misspellings\n\nCommon abbreviations\n\nCommon acronyms\n\nKeyboard fat fingering\n\nCommon nicknames\n\nRegional spelling differences\n\nDate Format\n\nThe Answer Logic algorithms can be enabled or disabled and the intensity or strength of some algorithms (the level of Answer Logic used to evaluate answers given for challenge questions) can also be configured. For example, high risk transactions such as wire transfers may require a high degree of certainty (i.e. exact match) whereas accessing personal, non-sensitive information may require a lower degree of response certainty.\n\nAs standard, Answer Logic is only functional for English. Abbreviations can be globalized but creation of locale specific text equivalency files is required. For information, refer to Developer's Guide for Oracle Adaptive Access Manager.\n\nExample of How It Works\n\nQuestion: Who was your favorite teacher in high school?\n\nRegistered answer: Mrs. Smith\n\nGiven answer: Misses Smuth\n\nLogic level: If set to High, the answer is accepted.\n\nTable 7-2 Answer Logic Algorithm Example\n\nAlgorithm Description Reason\n\n7.3.6.1 Common Response Errors\n\nThis section highlights the most common response errors and shows how Answer Logic algorithms are used for the system to intelligently detect the correct answers in the challenge response process. Examples of abbreviations, phonetics, and keyboard fat fingering are also provided.\n\n7.3.6.1.1 Abbreviations\n\nCommon abbreviations, common nicknames, common acronyms, and date format are handled by this algorithm.\n\nCommon Abbreviations\n\nThis algorithm matches the words in the following pairs as equivalent. OAAM Admin has predefined list of word-pairs that cover common abbreviations, common nicknames and common acronyms.\n\nStreet - St.\n\nDrive - Dr.\n\nCalifornia - CA\n\nThe list can be customized by creating a new abbreviation file, custom_auth_abbreviation_config.properties. For information, refer to Developer's Guide for Oracle Adaptive Access Manager.\n\nCommon Nicknames\n\nOracle has a predefined list of the most common nicknames that is used in the challenge response process.\n\nTimothy - Tim\n\nMatthew - Matt\n\nDate Format\n\nThe questions that require date as the answer specify the format in which the user should enter the answer. The format is either YYYY or MMDD, but not both. However, from experience, users still use other formats during the challenge response process. The abbreviation logic for date format sees the following as the same:\n\n0713\n\n713\n\nJuly 13th\n\nJuly 13\n\nJuly 13, 1970\n\n7.3.6.1.2 Phonetics\n\nAnswers that \"sound like\" the registered answer, regional spelling differences, and common misspellings are handled by this algorithm. The phonetics algorithm is only supported in English.\n\nCommon Misspellings\n\nOracle's Phonetic Answer Logic algorithm accounts for misspellings.\n\nph - f\n\nCorrect word: elephant - Spelling mistake: elefant\n\n7.3.6.1.3 Keyboard Fat Fingering\n\nOracle's Fat Fingering algorithm accounts for typos due to the proximity of keys on a standard keyboard and transposed letters. Answers with typos due to the proximity of keys on a standard keyboard are handled by this algorithm.\n\nThe number of fat fingering characters allowed depends on the length of the original word and the level set. The algorithm returns a percentage score associated with the characters that have an exact match. The intensity determines the minimum score required to match the answer with the registered answer.\n\nNote:\n\nThe fat fingering algorithm is only supported in English.\n\nCommon Typos\n\nSwitching \"w\" and \"e\"\n\nSwitching \"u\" and \"i\"\n\nSwitching \"t\" and \"r\"\n\nExamples of Fat Fingering\n\nCorrect word: signature - Fat finger: signatire\n\n7.3.6.2 Level of Answer Logic\n\nThe level of Answer Logic, the intensity or strength of algorithms, used to evaluate answers given for challenge questions is adjustable. You can enable or disable each algorithm and you can also specify the following levels for the algorithms used:\n\nOff – No Answer Logic is used; answers must exactly match those previously registered by the user.\n\nLow – Less Answer Logic; answers provided by the user must be a match or near-match to the answers that were provided at the time of registration\n\nMedium – More Answer Logic; the user is given some leeway for the answers that are provided. For example, St. might be accepted for Street.\n\nHigh – Highest level of Answer Logic. The constraints are not strict for matching.\n\nEach algorithm generates a score that represents how close the given answer is to the registered answer. OAAM Admin can be configured to accept different threshold score ranges for each algorithm individually. Separate threshold values for each algorithm (low/medium/high) are set in a properties file. The default thresholds are described as follows.\n\n7.3.6.2.1 Abbreviation\n\nFor abbreviation:\n\nReturn values: 0 or 100 (no-match OR match)\n\nLevels: ON or OFF\n\nLogic\n\nIf an abbreviation entry exists linking the given strings, score is 100\n\nElse score is 0\n\n7.3.6.2.2 Fat Fingering\n\nFor fat fingering:\n\nReturn values: range 0 to 100\n\nLevels: OFF, LOW (90+), MEDIUM (75+), HIGH (60+)\n\nLogic\n\nIf the string lengths do not match, score is 0\n\nIf a position does not have the expected character or its neighbor, score is 0\n\nElse compute the number of positions that have the neighboring characters.\n\nScore = (StringLength – NeighborPositionCount) * 100 /StringLength\n\n7.3.6.2.3 Phonetics\n\nFor phonetics:\n\nReturn values: 0, 60, 75, 90\n\nLevels: OFF, LOW (90), MEDIUM (75), HIGH (60)\n\nLogic\n\nCompute primary and alternative phonetic keys for the given strings, using DoubleMetaphone algorithm\n\nIf primary keys of both strings match, score is HIGH\n\nElse if a primary key of one of the strings and alternate key of the other string match, score is MEDIUM\n\nElse if the alternate keys of both string match, score is LOW\n\nElse the score is 0\n\n7.3.6.2.4 Multiple Word Answers\n\nAnswers that contain multiple words are treated in a specific way by the Answer Logic. If the final score from a complete string match does not meet the \"success\" criteria, individual words in the answer are evaluated. If each individual word in an answer is accepted by any of the algorithms the whole answer is accepted.\n\nMultiple word answers with missing/extra words must be an exact match to the registered answer. Answers must have the same number of words as the registered answer to be evaluated with Answer Logic. For example: If the registered answer is \"Mead Elementary School\" and the answer given at the time of challenge is \"Mesd Elem Sch\":\n\nAbbreviation: Mead–Mesd=0; Elementary-Elem=100; School-Sch=100 Fat-finger: Mead-Mesd=75; Elementary-Elem=0; School-Sch=0 Phonetics: Mead-Mesd=0; Elementary-Elem=0; School-Sch=0\n\nAssuming that abbreviation was set to anything besides off and fat fingering was set to medium or high, since all three words would be accepted individually, the whole answer would be accepted.\n\n7.3.6.3 Configuring Answer Validation\n\nThe KBA Answer Logic tab includes controls for the level of each Answer Logic algorithm used for answer validation. The higher the level the less exact answers need to be for acceptance.\n\nTo configure Answer Logic:\n\nIn the Navigation tree, double-click Answer Logic under KBA.\n\nYou can specify different settings for Online Challenge and CSR Phone Challenge.\n\nFigure 7-3 shows the Answer Logic tab with controls to configure different levels of Answer Logic algorithms.\n\nFigure 7-3 Answer Logic\n\nDescription of \"Figure 7-3 Answer Logic\"\n\nTo change the level of Answer Logic used for keyboard fat fingering and phonetics, select Off, Low, Medium, or High: the lower the setting the higher degree of exactness required.\n\nFor information on logic levels, see Section 7.3.6.2, \"Level of Answer Logic.\"\n\nClick OK.\n\n7.3.7 Configuring Registration Logic\n\nThe number of questions that appear on each menu, the number of categories per menu, and the number of questions that a user must register is configurable. The user is required to select one question from each menu and enter answers for them. Only one question from each question menu can be registered.\n\nTo configure the registration for challenge questions and answers:\n\nIn the Navigation tree, double-click Registration Logic under KBA. The Registration Logic page is displayed.\n\nTo enter or change the values for the question set generation, you can specify the following settings.\n\nNumber of questions that a customer must register\n\nNumber of questions that appear on each menu\n\nNumber of categories per menu\n\nThe categories per menu cannot be more than the number of categories available in the system.\n\nNote:\n\nEnter realistic numbers. For example, the number of questions that a user must register should be 3 to 7 questions\n\nClick Apply.\n\nA confirmation dialog is displayed with the message, \"Registration Logic details updated successfully.\"\n\nClick OK.\n\n7.3.8 Creating New Challenge Questions\n\nIf the standard challenge questions do not meet your needs, create questions that are applicable to the users accessing your application.\n\nTo create a question\n\nIn the Navigation tree, double-click Questions under KBA. The Questions Search page is displayed.\n\nFrom the Questions Search page, click New Questions.\n\nThe New Questions page appears where you can enter details to create a question.\n\nAlternative methods to open create pages are listed in Section 3.5, \"Using Search, Create, and Import.\"\n\nWhen the New Question page first appears, the default value for the question status is Active.\n\nQuestion, Category, Status, and Locale are required fields.\n\nPick a locale from the list of locales available.\n\nBy default, the Locale menu displays English and 26 other default locale languages.\n\nType the new question in the Question field.\n\nThe question names must be unique across categories.\n\nFrom the Category list, select the category of question you want.\n\nBy default, there is no data in the Category list. You must import the challenge questions ZIP files (oaam_kba_questions_locale.zip) for data to appear in the Category menu. You can also create a new category.\n\nIn the Locale list, select the language you want.\n\nBy default, the Locale menu displays English and 26 other default locale languages.\n\nEach question can be assigned unique validations to control the answers a user is allowed to register. To assign a local validation, select the validation type from the Registration Validation list.\n\nThe local validations you select in this step control the answers a user is allowed to register for this particular question. It does not control the registration of answers for all questions.\n\nFor information on the difference between global and local validations, refer to Section 7.3.5, \"Configuring Validation for Answer Registration.\"\n\nIn the Answer Logic Hints list, select the type of Answer Logic Hint you want.\n\nA hint can be added to questions individually to affect the Answer Logic used to evaluate given answers. This is performed to better tune the logic for the type of question. This is especially important for date related questions.\n\nThese hints help the Answer Logic function more successfully on some questions, for example, on date related questions. If a question has the date answer hint applied then the abbreviations, phonetics and fat fingering Answer Logic runs first, and then special date format logic is applied.\n\nClick Apply. A confirmation dialog appears telling you that the question was created successfully.\n\nClick OK to dismiss the dialog.\n\nThe Question Detail page appears for the newly created question.\n\nAfter the question has been created, you can edit details.\n\nNote:\n\nThe deployment administrator must ensure that there are enough questions in the database for each of the supported locale as configured in OAAM Admin during deployment; otherwise, OAAM Server displays only the English language questions during registration.\n\nThe number of locale-specific questions must be equal to or greater than the \"Questions User Will Register\" multiplied by the \"Questions per Menu\" multiplied by the \"Categories per Menu.\"\n\n7.3.9 Creating New Categories\n\nIf the standard categories that questions can be grouped under do not meet your needs, create categories that can hold relevant questions you plan to create.\n\nTo create a category\n\nOpen the Categories Search page, as described in Section 7.2, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nFrom the Categories Search page, click New Category or the New icon.\n\nAlternative methods to open create pages are listed in Section 3.5, \"Using Search, Create, and Import.\"\n\nThe New Category page appears where you can enter details to create a category.\n\nType the new category in the Category field.\n\nEnter a description.\n\nClick Apply.\n\nThe Category Details page appears for the newly created category.\n\n7.4 Managing Challenge Questions\n\nThe KBA functionality enables you to manage challenge questions.

If the user is re-registering or changing user preference, the disabled question is replaced with another question from the same category.\n\n7.4.10 Activating Challenge Questions\n\nTo activate questions:\n\nOpen the Questions Search page, as described in Section 7.2, \"Accessing Configurations in KBA Administration.\"\n\nIn the Questions Search page, search for the questions you are interested in.\n\nSelect the rows corresponding to the questions you want to activate.\n\nClick Activate or select Activate from the Actions menu.\n\nThe selected questions are activated.\n\n7.11 KBA Guidelines and Recommended Requirements\n\nThese recommendations provide guidelines for implementing KBA authentication. They provide guidance to institutions for configuring and implementing custom enrollment and challenge procedures within the guidelines of best practices.\n\n7.11.1 How Often to Challenge Users\n\nKBA is a form of secondary authentication where during authentication, the user is prompted by challenge questions and must provide previously registered answers.\n\nSince KBA is a secondary authentication method it should only be presented after successful primary authentication. KBA challenge is necessary in medium to high risk situations. Challenging users too often and without significant risk degrades the user experience and possibly the security. The goal is to challenge users often enough so they can successfully recall their answers but not so often that they view it as a hindrance. As well, displaying the questions excessively increases the slim possibility of exposure to fraudsters through over-the-shoulder or some other attack. In general, a challenge roughly every month for a normal user is a good rate. Suspicious users should be blocked and should not have access to the system.\n\n7.11.2 Phased Rollout for Registration\n\nA phased rollout KBA is necessary to help ease the transition for the organization and the users. Spacing out the rollout allows for an important learning period and lessens the impact to customer service.\n\nThe user is not registered and there is little change to the user experience.\n\nThe user can choose to register.\n\nThe user must register an image, a phrase, and challenge questions to be stored in a customer profile.\n\nThe most successful phased approach generally includes these phases. The first two generally last between one and three months each depending on user population size and composition.\n\nStagger the rollout of user registration to subgroups of users to lessen impact.\n\n7.11.2.1 Phase 1 - No Registration\n\nPhase one generally consists of Oracle Adaptive Access Manager risk evaluation. In this phase there is little change to user experience. Users continue to access through the existing methods. The only slight change to user experience is a block. Blocking is recommended in the phase for extremely high-risk situations. With blocking actions applied OAAM Admin can start to prevent fraud from day one. Since only severe security violations are blocked normal users should not experience issues with them. Phase one can last any length of time desired by the business. Generally organizations stay in phase one for one to three months.\n\n7.11.2.2 Phase 2 - Optional Registration\n\nPhase two is the gradual introduction of the virtual devices and secondary authentication to the user population. In this phase registration is made available to the population or sub-populations of existing users on an optional basis. This opt-in allows users to register when they have time and feel comfortable. Brand new users should be given the option to register as soon as they are created. This strategy helps to distribute load on support over a period and to add convenience for users.\n\nUser Experience\n\nThe user is prompted to register for challenge questions after successfully authenticating at sign-on. The user can choose to bypass registration and then proceed into the session.\n\nStaggered Rollout\n\nBreaking up a rollout phase into sub-groups can further ease efforts. In large deployments staggering is advised. Phase two is generally the best time to implement staggering. The most common staggering has the following steps.\n\nThe user population is broken into groups. Geographic region is the most often used basis for this grouping\n\nStaggered start dates are configured for each group.\n\n7.11.3 Designing Challenge Questions\n\nGuidelines for designing challenge questions are listed below:\n\nQuestion should not require answers that are personally identifiable information. For example, do not ask for Social Security Number, and other identifiers.\n\nQuestions should not require answers that can easily be discovered via public sources such as the internet. For example, what college did you graduate from?\n\nQuestions should not have answers that change over time. For example, what is your girlfriends name?\n\nQuestions should not have answers that are easy to guess. For example, what is your favorite weekday?\n\nQuestions should not be specific to any one religion, culture or sub-culture. For example, who is your favorite apostle? Which Smurf do you most closely identify with? What race would you prefer to be in the Star Wars Galaxy?\n\n7.11.4 Tips for Managing Challenge Questions\n\nApplying Validations\n\nMany validations may be applied locally or globally. You must be careful not to apply any validations globally that you do not want to influence all answer registration. For example, if the \"Four-digit year (YYYY)\" validation is applied globally then only numeral answers are accepted during KBA registration. This is a problem if there are questions available to users that normally have alphanumeric answers.\n\nDeleting Questions and Categories\n\nYou can create, edit, and delete questions and categories. You should take care when deleting categories and questions. Insufficient numbers of questions and categories can impact the security of the solution and cause usability issues. For example, if the Categories per menu Registration Logic is set to a number that is more than the total number of categories in the system then there may be duplicate questions listed. This can be confusing to users and should be avoided.\n\nQuestions per Menu Setting\n\nThe Questions per menu setting should be between 4 and 7. This range provides a good mix of questions in a question set but does not expose too many questions to any single user.\n\nQuestion User will Register Setting\n\nThe Questions user will register setting should be between 3 and 7. This provides enough questions to offer good security but does not over burden a user's memory. The basic industry standard for KBA is 3 registered questions.\n\nThe maximum and minimum limits are configurable through the following properties.\n\nbharosa.config.type.kba_config.enum.regQuestionsCount.validation.minValue=3 bharosa.config.type.kba_config.enum.regQuestionsCount.validation.maxValue=7\n\nChallenge Questions Configuration\n\nIt is recommended that you completely configure all of the challenge questions, including locale, before making the question available to users.\n\nChallenge Question Disabling\n\nIf you disable a challenge question, users who previously had that question continue to have the question even after it is disabled. However, users that are registering for the first time or re-registering are not presented with the disabled question.\n\n7.11.5 Answer Input Recommended Requirements\n\nRecommended requirements for answers are listed below:\n\nAnswers must be at least 4 characters.\n\nNo more than 2 answers can be the same during registration.\n\nAnswers cannot have more than 2 repeating characters.\n\nSpecial characters are not allowed.\n\nAnswers are not case-sensitive.\n\nExtra white spaces are removed.\n\nFuzzy logic implemented - degree configurable by client.\n\n7.11.6 Other KBA Recommended Requirements\n\nOther tips for challenge questions are:\n\nA unique question set should be generated for each user.\n\nThe user should register 3-5 questions, i.e., 15 total questions to select from, 3 drop-down lists of 5 questions each.\n\nThere should be a maximum of 2 questions from the same category.\n\nThere should be a maximum opt-out, i.e., 3 opt-out attempts before forcing registration.\n\nWhen challenged, the same question is to be presented until the user responds correctly or question is reset by customer service agent."
