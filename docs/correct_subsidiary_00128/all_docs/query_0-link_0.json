        "text": "News Facts\n\nOracle today announced that it has agreed to acquire Bharosa, Inc., a leading provider of software that helps combat online identity theft and fraud. Strong authentication and fraud detection are increasingly critical components of identity management deployments and are seeing rapid adoption. Driven by regulatory mandates such as FFIEC, PCI, and HIPAA, organizations are under pressure to reduce fraud and provide higher levels of assurance of users' identities and their usage intent. By adding some of the leading real-time fraud prevention capabilities of Bharosa's Tracker and Authenticator software to Oracle's existing web single sign-on and web-based authorization solutions, Oracle will uniquely provide the next generation of access management to customers and the market.\n\n\"Oracle Identity Management ranks among the industry's top solutions and we plan to continue rapidly expanding our security business to provide our customers with the most comprehensive, leading information protection solutions available,\" said Hasan Rizvi, vice president, Identity Management and Security Products, Oracle. \"We expect Oracle and Bharosa, together, to provide enterprises with a comprehensive identity management solution that integrates proactive, real-time fraud prevention.\"\n\nWith more than 25 million users, Bharosa's real-time fraud detection and multifactor online authentication security solutions for the enterprise, combined with Oracle's established web single sign-on and web-based authorization solutions, will result in a differentiated solution that protects investments by extending internal web Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions to external users. It also creates a highly secure, low impact security solution that protects users from common, often costly, threats.\n\n\"Companies need new mechanisms that complement their existing security solutions so that they can better protect themselves from insider threats and misuse from privileged users,\" said Jon Fisher, CEO, Bharosa. \"At Bharosa, we're thrilled to bring our market-leading solutions to the world's largest enterprise software company.\"\n\nBharosa's Tracker and Authenticator software will continue to be available on a standalone basis with integrations for Oracle and non-Oracle environments as well as integrated with Oracle Identity Management. The transaction is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in August 2007. Financial details were not disclosed. More information is available at http://www.oracle.com/bharosa.\n\nAbout Oracle Identity Management\n\nServing as the security backbone for Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Identity Management helps customers and partners decrease security threats across diverse IT environments while helping address governance, risk and compliance needs.
