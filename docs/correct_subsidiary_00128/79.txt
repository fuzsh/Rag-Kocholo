Oracle is to buy Bharosa, a provider of software against online identity theft and fraud.

The former plans to integrate fraud prevention capabilities of Bharosas Tracker and Authenticator software into Oracles sign-on and web-based authorisation services. Bharosas Tracker verifies a host of factors used to confirm a users identity, including the users computer, location and online behaviour.

The acquisition of Bharosa enables Oracle to offer its customers web-based access management services. In combination with Oracles identity management products, these services are to deliver access management and provide customers with a series of tools to protect and manage access to their assets.
