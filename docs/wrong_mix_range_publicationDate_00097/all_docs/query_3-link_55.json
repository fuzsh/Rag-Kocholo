        "text": "Seeing he hasn't been mentioned yet in this thread (or so I think) I must give a startled mention of the late great Arthur C Clarke. For me at least he remains the yardstick by which I measure the works of all other \"hard\" SF writers. \"The Songs of Distant Earth\" is possibly Arthur C's most accomplished novel - certainly his swansong among his decidedly uneven later works. Other standout writers for me include Isaac Asimov and Larry \"Protector\"* Niven. But I wish (and it pains me to admit this) I wish I could say the same about Robert Heinlein! Amazingly enough, despite having recently re-read such relentless dialogue/monologue ridden novels of his as \"Double Star\" and \"The Door into Summer\" (both of which ended up in charity shops), despite too my distant memories of the epic-like \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", I keep coming back to Heinlein's wonderful juvenile SF novels - \"Starman Jones\" and \"Have Spacesuit - Will Travel\" especially. No one in the SF field has written for younger folks quite like RH.\n\nCurrently, I'm stumping my way through Kim Stanley Robinson's \"MarsTrilogy\", whose sprawling mythic qualities I do admire, but which I find somewhat wordy and hard going in places. Meanwhile, waiting on my bookshelf to be read is \"Diaspora\" by Greg Egan. I've not read any of Egan's novels before, but I'm assured this is true hard SF by those whose opinions I value. Finally, it's hats off to Robert Forward and his remarkable \"Dragon's Egg\" novel. Yes, the narrative is wooden in places and the human characters are forever paper-thin ciphers (even for SF). The cheela never fail to shine through, however, and the novel concludes with a moment of sheer magic. . . a close encounter of utter poignancy, and one that suggests to the reader just how truly strange and mysterious an encounter with intelligent aliens could be like in reality. And all this in a typically hard SF novel. Long may the genre thrive. . . and I am looking forward to getting to grips with \"Diaspora\".\n\n*Why in heaven's name haven't they (Hollywood producers etc) got round to making a film of this amazing novel? (And why isn't there a sequel?)\n\nmeBigGuy said:\n\nWell, I got fooled into reading The Martian by the name and a recommendation (assuming it was actually about a Martian, not a stranded astronaut) . I then kept reading it because the story flowed well, and the science was not distracting. That's the trick, weaving the technology into the story so they are well integrated. Like the Clancy books. If you still have a story without the science, then you put in too much (a \"data dump\" as you described it).\n\nAaaand there's an XKCD for that...\n\nhttp://xkcd.com/1536/\n\nchasrob said:\n\n... I'm writing a SF novel--trying to learn the ins and outs of the craft--and I was told by countless \"experts\" about the concept of the \"data dump\" and that it was without question a no-no that would turn off readers. My story had some science in it and several critiquers claimed \"too much exposition\"; and RUE--resist the urge to explain. Now David Weber is extremely popular, and he has chapters of exposition of his \"science\", but it took years for him to build his somewhat quirky following. So I toned down on it in subsequent drafts.\n\nThen I hear about this fabulous book The Martian. There are chapters after chapters of science \"stuff\"!\n\nIt's the current #1 NYT bestseller.http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-06-28/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html . Now I'm really confused. I've been led astray by the \"experts\".\n\nAhhh... I understand. There is a fine line between explaining, and intelligently weaving the technology/science into the story (making it integral to the story). The story becomes about interacting with the science, not about explaining the science. Using the science to make a story is different from \"explaining\". If you can leave it out and not disrupt the storyline, then you should leave it out. (Just my opinion, as I am not a writer).\n\nNeal Stephenson in \"Seveneves\" does WAY too many long boring descriptions. Be interesting to see how that is received (but, it is a worthwhile read in spite of \"too-dense-technical-detail\" in some places, along with boring back stories and a typical Stephenson-esque get-it-over-with ending."
