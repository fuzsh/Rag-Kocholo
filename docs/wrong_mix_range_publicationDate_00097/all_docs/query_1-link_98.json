        "text": "We are a science fiction/fantasy book club in Chicago. There are ten or so of us. We abide by a fairly strict set of rules (see below). This is the official LORDS OF LORE home page, containing information and a record of our deliberations.\n\nYou may also enjoy a visit to the OFFICIAL LORDS OF LORE BLOG, affording some insight into the rarefied aesthetic predilections of, if not a majority, then at least a refined and proactive cross-section of our membership.\n\nRules\n\nHere are the rules:\n\nYou choose a book to read.\n\nYour book must be sci-fi/fantasy, and really it must be classified as such by the publisher. In other words, it must be \"genre fiction\", don't try any shit like reading a Vonnegut or Murakami book and calling it science fiction. Hint: suitable books can be found in the SCI-FI SECTION of your favorite store.\n\nYour book should have a copyright date of 2014, 2015 or 2016. There are a few problems with this. The idea is to be reading new books, so really it should have an original copyright date of 2014, 2015 or 2016. Don't read some book that's twenty years old but just republished, or some mass market that came out in 2010 in hardcover, or some book that came out in a British edition in 2009 but is just now seeing American release. However, we do recognize that sometimes it's pretty hard to find out when a book was really originally published, which makes this a little challenging. Just do your best. ALSO: we do recognize that this is pretty restrictive. You might not have an easy time finding something, particularly something that's not part of an ongoing series and particularly in the fantasy genre. This is sort of the point. So really, just try to do your best. If you pick something from 2009 and can justify your choice, you will IN ALL LIKELIHOOD not be expelled from the club. But like I said, this difficulty is really sort of the whole point of the club, so please try to do your best.\n\nRead your book, and prepare in any way necessary to present your findings.\n\nPresent your findings at our next club meeting. Generally, meetings are held every two months.\n\nThat's about it. Go nuts.\n\nMeeting Dates\n\nTuesday, October 30, 2007 (minutes, which are frankly garbage)\n\nTuesday, December 10, 2007 (minutes, which are nearly garbage)\n\nTuesday, February 5, 2008 (minutes)\n\nTuesday, April 29, 2008 (minutes)\n\nFriday, July 11, 2008 (minutes)\n\nTuesday, August 26, 2008 (minutes)\n\nFriday, October 3, 2008 (minutes)\n\nFriday, January 16, 2009 (minutes)\n\nFriday, February 27, 2009 (minutes)\n\nFriday, April 24, 2009 (minutes)\n\nFriday, June 12, 2009 (minutes)\n\nThursday, July 23, 2009 (minutes)\n\nFriday, September 19, 2009 (minutes)\n\nThursday, October 8, 2009 (minutes)\n\nThursday, December 3, 2009 (minutes)\n\nThursday, January 14, 2010 (minutes)\n\nThursday, March 11, 2010 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, April 17, 2010 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, June 19, 2010 (minutes)\n\nFriday, September 3, 2010 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, November 13, 2010 (minutes)\n\nSunday, January 9, 2011 (minutes)\n\nFriday, February 25, 2011 (minutes)\n\nThursday, April 28, 2011 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, October 15, 2011 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, December 18, 2011 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, January 28, 2012 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, June 23, 2012 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, October 13, 2012 (minutes)\n\nSunday, January 27, 2013 (minutes)\n\nSunday, June 2, 2013 (minutes)\n\nSunday, November 23, 2013 (minutes)\n\nSunday, February 23, 2014 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, October 4, 2014 (minutes)\n\nFriday, December 12, 2014 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, April 25, 2015 (minutes)\n\nWednesday, February 10, 2016 (minutes)\n\nSaturday, September 24, 2016 (minutes)\n\nNovember, 2016 (planned)\n\nMailing list\n\nThere is a mailing list for the purpose of coordinating our actions.
