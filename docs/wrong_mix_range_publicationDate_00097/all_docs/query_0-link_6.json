        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am looking for any recent novels about a small group of people, who would land on an spaceship either human or alien and investigate why it was abandoned?\n\nAny recommendations?\n\ntia.\n\nRendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke is one of the most famous of these.\n\nRead Rama, was NOT impressed the \"sequels\" to Rama(IMO) they aren't worth the time, the first is a great stand alone\n\nNow I can't remember the title but.... there was a book where Alien spaceships flew into the solar system and approached Earth. Each time this happened a team would board the ship and manage to destroy it. Then a new ship would turn up with modifications to it's design to make it harder to sabotage and so on and so forth. Practically the whole of Earth was linked to these attack squads and would filter suggestions for layout and strategy during the mission. Each mission was harder than the one before.\n\nNot exactly matching your criteria but....\n\nI thought of Tanya Huff's “The Better Part of Valor”. A Google search found a few others including “First Flight” by Chris Claremont, a short story “Half a Life” by Kirill Bulychev and a 1997 film “Event Horizon” although that space ship did not start out alien.\n\nGalactic Derelict by Andre Norton. Archeologists go back in time to an abandoned but still working spaceship. They move it forward to our time, but doing so triggers its launch and it follows its old preprogrammed path. However all of the destinations are also thousands of year in the future (from the ships perspective). I can't remember exactly how many but at least 10 to perhaps 50 thousand years different. I liked the book, even reread it as an adult.\n\nGalactic Derelict by Andre Norton. Archeologists go back in time to an abandoned but still working spaceship.

That sounds pretty cool!\n\nWas \"Event Horzion\" based on a book( maybe the same name?)\n\nAlso, 2010 deals with a derliect ship from 2001 (HAL)\n\nThat was an odd series as far as my likes:\n\n2001-Great read!\n\n2010-pretty Good!\n\n2061-Ummm, errrr,\n\n3000-(Didn't get past the 4th chapter)\n\nlol\n\nFrederik Pohl's Heechee novels, of which the first is Gateway, are based on the discovery of a large number of alien spacecraft which are capable of interstellar flight. Humans adapt to them and use them, and various hints are dropped as to what the creators of these vehicles (the Heechee) were like.\n\nBetty Cross"
