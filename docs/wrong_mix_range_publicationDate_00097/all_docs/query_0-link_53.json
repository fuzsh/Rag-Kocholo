However, it is apparently not. The little Francis-like girl (badger/skunk?) babysits her little brother, and mayhem ensues. They get out all the pots & pans and bang on them, make jelly sandwiches and get jelly all over themselves, and finally have a pillow fight and get feathers stuck to the jelly. The mother comes home to find them both asleep in the crib, amid the mess. I would be so thrilled to find this book to prove I'm not hallucinating and it really exists (or exhisted)! Thanks!\n\nF212 I'm surprised you didn't recognize this: I t must be: Hoban Bread and jam for Frances\n\nThanks for your effort, but unfortunately that is not the book I am looking for. In Bread & Jam for Frances, there are none of the babysitting scenes I described in my original posting. The way I remember the title of the book, it was something like, \"Frances babysits\" although that can't be right, since I've researched all the Hoban books, and none of them are about Frances babysitting. It's a conundrum!\n\nI'm sorry to disagree, but this is NOT Bread and Jam for Frances (written by Russell Hoban, illustrated by Lillian Hoban). In that book, Frances is cured of her picky eating habits when her mother serves her favorite snack, bread and jam, at every meal. She quickly tires of bread and jam and longs for variety in her diet. The stumper requester is looking for a different book!\n\nThis is definitely NOT Bread and Jam for Frances.\n\nSorry, this is NOT Bread and Jam for Frances. In that book, Frances only wants bread and jam to eat because it is so wonderful, and so she begins to have it served to her at every meal. At first she is happy with the situation but after awhile, watching her family and friends continue to eat makes her less of a picky eater, and she gives up her bread and jam. It doesn't sound like the book in question.\n\nThis cannot POSSIBLY be Bread and Jam for Frances. In that book, Frances only wants to eat bread and jam for every meal until her parents gently convince her to eat other things. And Frances never had a little brother.\n\nThis is NOT Bread and Jam for Francis. That book is about Francis being a picky eater, so her mother gives in and just gives her bread and jam for every meal. After a few days of this, she realizes \"What I am, is tired of jam\".\n\nNo, this is NOT Bread and Jam for Francis! In that book, Frances refuses to eat anything but bread and jam, and her parents indulge her ... with perhaps unexpected results. No baby brother (Frances has a baby SISTER, Gloria), no pillow fight, no feathers.\n\nThis would not be the book Bread and Jam for Francis! I'm afraid I do not know the title the reader is searching for, but Bread and Jam for Francis is about a little girl badger that only wants to eat jam sandwiches. Her mother makes them for her so often that little Francis finally decides to expand her mealtime repetoire. Francis does no babysitting, and she has a little sister, not a brother.\n\nthis may be one of the hoban's francis books but the previous solver said it was Bread and Jam for Francis. Bread and Jam has no baby sitting and no mess. sorry\n\nF212 I just looked at a lot of Google entries to see if it could be a Marie Louse's heyday by Natalie Savage Carlson, but I guess it isn't. A mongoose babysits 5 possums.\n\nIt's also not No trouble at all (Bardstown), about Grandpa Bear babysitting his two grandcubs, even though, oddly enough, there is both a pillow fight and a jam incident in it.\n\nYou are NOT hallucinating!!!I found your book today at a library booksale!!! Waddy and His Brother by Patricia Coombs (of Dorrie the Witch fame)(Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co.-1964) Kind of a rare book. While these animals look sort of like bears they are actually raccoons. The story is as you describe. The feathers from the pillow get stuck all over little brother because of all the sticky jam. A cute story!! Hurrah!\n\nYayyyy!! Thank you so much to whoever it was that solved my book mystery! I am so excited to start hunting down this book. Thanks again!!\n\nWaggy and his Friends\n\nBunBun leads a nursery of toys on adventures. One of the toys gets caught under the bed, one falls in a toybox, I think. It was a smallish book - maybe 4x6 or 4x5 I bought it used from the library here and read it to my boys \"millions\" of times. I have a granddaughter I would like to read it to now, if anyone can help me find it. Thanks!\n\nB204: Sounds like one of two books by Patricia M. Scarry - 1)Waggy and his Friends 2)More about Waggy (1973). There is a rabbit doll named Bun Bun, plus Lion and Lumpy. Sticky-sweet.\n\nWait for What Will Come\n\nGirl inherits house from Aunt in maybe Maine or upper US, but no money. Finds barrels and barrels of old dishes in Attic. Eats scones, clotted cream and jam all the time. Romance going on. Turns out dishes are worth a fortune. I do not know the author or title.\n\nPossibly Wait for What Will Come by Barbara Michaels. The heroine inherits an old house on the Cornish coast. I was looking for my copy last night so I could check whether it's the one where she finds valuable\n\nfurniture and china stored away in the attic, but couldn't locate it. That does definitely happen in one of her books, though. And scones & clotted cream sounds a lot more like the UK than Maine. If it is this one, there's a mystery connected with the disappearance of a girl in the past and a selkie/merman creature.\n\nWell this might by a stretch but it sounds almost like Wait for What Will Come by Barbara Michaels. Carla inherits an old house in Cornwall from her Uncle. She travels there and is served Scones and clotted cream by the old housekeeper. Romance comes in the form of the friendly doctor, the mysterious housekeeper's grandson and a lawyer. There is a mystery surrounding an ancient curse about mermen. She finds a couple of barrels of old dishes in the attic that raise enough money to let her stay in England a bit longer. She ends up staying intending to turn the house into a hotel or B&B and with the housekeeper's grandson who was a famous ballet dancer.\n\nG38 girl inherits house: I found my copy of Wait for What Will Come, by Barbara Michaels, pbk edn 1990 (original copyright 1978). Carla Tregallas, American, inherits the ancestral house in Cornwall - not Maine, but similar rocky stormy coast with fishing villages. The house and estate are very rundown, paintings and furnishings have been sold off, staff let go and so on. In between dealing with the mystery and ancestral curse, Carla looks\n\nfor ways to keep the house. On p.197 \"she attacked the attic with magnificent energy ... remembering the vogue for secondhand clothes, Carla saw silver, if not gold, in the trunks of old-fashioned garments.\" On p.202 she gets into an attic room that's been boarded up \"filled with objects, every inch of it ...\" and opens a barrel that contains \"a cup of heavy earthenware, with designs in blue on a white background ... another cup and a small plate with similar patterns.\" (p.205) This turns out to be Delftware. \"The antique dealers arrived bright and early the following morning, and for several days she sweated and strained in the dusty attic, making money hand over fist - or so it seemed to her.\" (p.220). Sample scones and clotted cream episodes are on pp. 14, 52, 94, and 146, by which time \"she was really getting very tired of clotted cream.\"\n\nWait Till Helen Comes\n\nThis is a story about a young girl and her family. I think that her mother remarries, and her mother and stepfather buy an old church for them to live in. It turns out that there is a cemetery in the back of the church. This is where the story gets fuzzy, but I know it is a ghost story.\n\nMary Downing Hahn, Wait Till Helen Comes. Molly moves into a converted church with her mother, stepfather and younger stepsister Heather. Heather is irresistibly attracted to the cemetery behind the church, while Molly is afraid of it. Heather bonds with Helen, a mysterious ghost who tries to drown Heather so that they can be friends forever.\n\nA Walk Out of the World\n\nI read this in the 70's. There was a boy and a girl, appx. 11 or 12. The girl had long pale hair and her eyes were reflective silver, like a cat's. They had to run away from home to escape some sort of evil influence, and that they had special powers of some kind. Any help would be appreciated!\n\nAlexander Key, Escape to Witch Mountain. It sounds like Escape to Witch Mountain by Alexander Key (1968), except for the girl's reflective eyes. It also might be The Delikon by H.M. Hoover (1978), but it's been years since I read that and I can't be sure.\n\nI can think of three books where a child's eyes reflect silver: The Girl with the Silver Eyes, by Willo Davis Roberts (there's only one girl in most of the book, but at the end there are more kids with silver eyes.) The Silver Crown, by Robert C. O'Brien. (there's a boy and a girl in this one, but they aren't siblings. The girl gets a silver crown on her birthday, which leads to a whole quest to find its meaning. When she's under the influence of the crown, her eyes reflect silver.) and Mind-Find, by Wilanne Belden. (my memory of this one is more sketchy, and there are three books in the series. In one of them, though, there's a brother and sister with powers, and I believe her eyes turn silver.) Hope it's one of these!\n\nWillo Davis Roberts, The Girl With the Silver Eyes,1980. Maybe this is a bit late - 1980, not the 1970's - but it's worth a shot. Katie has silver eyes and special powers, and is in danger because of them. She discovers that there are others like her and goes looking for them. One of her friends is a boy.\n\nRuth Nichols, A Walk Out Of The World, 1968. A brother and sister, Tobit and Judith, take a walk through a mysterious wood near their house and find themselves in a land with dwarves, river spirits and evil kobolds. Because of Judith's pale hair and silver eyes, they are recognized as heirs of the exiled king and help to overthrow the evil ruler who has taken over the land.\n\nRuth Nichols, A Walk Out of the World.A story of two children who walk through a wooded area to another time and place. They get involved in the conflicts of the people there and find out that their father is actually from this other world. The girl does have silver eyes.\n\nAlexander Key, Escape to Witch Mountain, 1968.The part about the brother and sister with special powers running away from an evil influence (a man claiming to be their long-lost uncle, but who really want to use them for their powers) sounds suspiciously like this book - but I don't remember anything about Tony and Tia having silver eyes. It has been many, many years since I read it, though - and it's possible I've forgotten that detail.\n\nWillo Davis Roberts, The Girl With the Silver Eyes, 1980. If you might have read it just a smidge later than the 1970s, perhaps you're thinking about this one? Katie is a 10-year old girl with magical powers and silver eyes. People are afraid of her because she is different and can make things happen just by thinking about them. Some people even suspect her of causing her grandmother's death, and she fears that she might be locked up. When a strange man (Mr. Cooper) starts asking too many questions about her, she fears that he might be a policeman. Katie runs away and finds other children like herself, with silver eyes and special powers.\n\nWillo Davis Roberts, The Girl With Silver Eyes, 1970s, approximate. Could this be it? The main character is an only child, but she has silver eyes, and meets up with other kids with the same eyes, and similar ESP powers. The evil they are trying to escape involves someone interested in their unusual powers.\n\nWillo Davis Roberts, The Girl with the Silver Eyes, 1980. I was surprised to learn the copyright was 1980, as I thought I'd read this book in the '70's. The main character is a girl with silver eyes and special powers, and I believe she does meet a boy with the same, but they're not siblings. This may be the book you're looking for, but maybe not. Is it possible you're confusing plot elements from another book?\n\nWillo Davis Roberts, The Girl With The Silver Eyes, 1985. Not sure if this is the book, but it looks like Scholastic re-printed this one in 1985 & 1991. Should be easy to find a copy.\n\nSOLVED: Ruth Nichols, A Walk Out of the World.I just wanted to say THANK YOU to everyone who wrote back. It was \"A Walk Out of the World\". I am thrilled to have found it again. Thank you so much!\n\nWalkabout\n\nIt was a hard cover book my teacher read to my class sometime between 1960 and 1965. It was about children in a plane crash in Africa that had to make their way to safety. I believe they were on their way to meet their parents.\n\nSorry, I don't know anything else about the book.\n\nMarshall, James Vance, Walkabout, 1959. Two children survive a plane crash in Australia. They are helped through the desert to safety by an aboriginal boy.\n\nMarshall, James Vance, Walkabout, 1959. In this story, an American brother and sister en route to a reunion with their parents are stranded in the Australian outback when their plane crashes. A young Aborigine helps them survice. (The movie that came out in the seventies starred Jenny Agutter.)\n\nWalking Out: A Novel of Survival\n\nThis is a young adult (teenage) chapter book that I read in the late 80's or early 90's. I would think it was written somewhere between the mid70's and 1990 or so at the VERY latest. A teenage girl is flying on a small plane (private, not a commercial airline) and going to visit her father? in the wilderness somewhere. I think maybe Alaska? Her plane crashes. I am thinking there was only her and a pilot on board and the pilot died? Definitely she had NO ONE with her after she landed. The story is about her being lost in the wilderness alone after the crash. She has a small parcel of dehydrated? food and her parachute and a small survival kit I think. She has to try and survive and get found/find civilization. I think there is one part where she is trying to signal a plane by flashing the sun off a mirror or something. Anyhow, at the end she does get found (very much skinnier) but the main part of the book is all about her surviving in the wilderness without much. Ring any bells?\n\nT151: Only help I can give is to mention the movie based on a true story, Miracles Still Happen (1974). You can read the viewer comments here. It takes place in the Amazon, however. The girl gets rescued by following a small stream to a river, since rivers, her father had told her, always lead to a village or a city. Side note: Camille Cosby said about the characters in The Blair Witch Project: \"Why don't those idiots just follow the creek?\"\n\nDavid Mathieson, Trial By Wilderness, 1985. Try this one: \"A girl survives a plane crash off the coast of British Columbia, and then faces survival in the wilderness, a feat which calls upon her courage, her endurance, and her skills.\"\n\nDavid Mathieson, Trial By Wilderness,1985. Maybe this? A girl survives a plane crash off the coast of British Columbia, and then faces survival in the wilderness, a feat which calls upon her courage, her endurance, and her skills.\n\nI am the one who submitted this stumper. It is definitely *not* Miracles Still Happen, as I am quite sure it did not happen in the Amazon. And I will look for a copy of Trial by Wilderness, but I highly doubt that is it either. Amazon has that one listed as a 9-12 age range, whereas the book I am looking for I am quite sure would be in the Young Adult (teen) range. I will check it out though. Thanks for the help so far! Any other ideas anyone?\n\nStephen King, The Girl Who Loved Tom Jordan (Gordon?), 2000? Sounds an awful lot like this story, except no plane crash. Girl gets separated from Mom & brother on a hike. Mom & Dad are divorcing. Girl huge fan of baseball player- pitcher? Red Sox? She remembers dad telling her once to follow streams if lost. That advice leads her to barren bogs- in Maine of course, this is Stephen King. She survives, much skinnier too.\n\nThanks for the continued help, but my stumper hasn't been solved yet. I found a copy of Trial by Wilderness at the library and that is definitely NOT the book I am looking for. And I know it is definitely not the Stephen King suggestion either. I so want to find this one! Any other thoughts anyone?\n\nSusan Black, Crash in the Wilderness, 1980s' Story of a sole survivor. Sorry, that is the only description!\n\nGary Paulsen, Hatchet, 1985. Does this title ring any bells for you? It's about a boy, not girl, and it won several book awards and I know is taught in classrooms, so it certianly would've been available. \"On his way to visit his recently divorced father in the Canadian mountains, thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson is the only survivor when the single-engine plane crashes. His body battered, his clothes in shreds, Brian must now stay alive in the boundless Canadian wilderness.\" See if it looks familiar.\n\nMargaret E Bell. This author has written many books about planes and girls in Alaska..or at least I am sure it is her. I read all kinds of Alaskan literature for kids and YA growing up in Alaska. Hope it helps you. You might also try to email an Alaskan library for help.\n\nI read this book in 6th grade, along with The Hatchet and other survival-type books. It's definitely not any of the currently\n\nsuggested titles, although I can't remember the title either.\n\nThis plot sounds a lot like a made for TV movie I saw back in the 70s or 80s called \"And I Alone Survived.\" It may have been based on a book that may have been based on a true story.\n\nAnn Elwood and John Raht, Walking Out: A Novel of Survival, c. 1979. This is the book. The girl's name was Terry, and I've read it a dozen times! It was published by Tempo Books.\n\nI have read this book, and used to own a copy. I can't remember the author, but the title is Walking Out\n\nThat book is called Walking Out: A Novel of Survival. I don't remember the names, but I believe there are two authors associated with this book.\n\nWalt Disney's Goliath II\n\nHi! I am trying find a copy of a book published by Little Golden books. I do not remember the full title but it is about a little elephant, named Goliath the second. He was a very small elephant and he wanted to be a giant elephant like his father. If you can help me I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nG23: Goliath II -- I'm not sure of the title, but I *think* Bill Peet illustrated this and refers to it (along with a picture of Goliath II) in his autobiography (Bill Peet: An Autobiography)\n\nG23- Goliath II (Walt Disney Little Golden Book #D83)\n\nNot much more information, but here's a citation for the suggested title: Bill Peet Walt Disney's Goliath II New York, Golden Press 1959 \"Goliath Was an Elephant\"\n\nWalt Disney's Little Man of Disneyland\n\nMy husband was born in 1954. At some point when he was pretty small (5 or 6) he had a book that he THINKS was called Patrick Begorra visits Disneyland Or something like that. It was about a Scot who visited Disneyland. Any hints as to what this book might have been? Apparently he loved it so much that he completely wore the book out! It would make a great (and special) gift for him, since we've looked for it for years with no luck. Hope we are as successful with this one as we were\n\nwith Artie the Smartie!!\n\nBecause the title you recall indicates an Irishman rather than a Scot, I'll venture to suggest Annie Bedford, Walt Disney's Little Man of Disneyland (NY:Simon & Sshuster,'55), about a leprechaun named Patrick.\n\nPretty sure about this one: Bedford, Annie North Walt Disney's LITTLE MAN OF DISNEYLAND New York, NY: Simon & Schuster, 1955. unpaginated, \"A Mickey Mouse Club book. Book introduces Patrick Begorra, an inhabitant of Disneyland.\" \"Patrick the leprechan wakes up one morning and finds BIG PEOPLE all over the place. What does he do now?\" \"A Leprechaun lives right where Disneyland is being built, he eventually moves in, but no one knows where he lives. DO you?\" And I have to say, Patrick is NOT a Scottish name, and Begorrah is NOT a Scottish exclamation (try Sandy Hoots Mon or something).\n\nLittle Man of Disneyland. This is a Disney Mickey Mouse Club Little Golden Book with Donald Duck and\n\na leprechaun on the cover.\n\nWalt Disney's Surprise Package\n\nA collection of short stories about choldren who, live in different countries. Large hardsoveer with white ground and metallic-gold paisley-type allover design on cover plus colored picture. The stories include one about a little girl who lived in China on a houseboat. When she falls overbpard, her pet duck helps save her. Another is about a little boy in Mexico during eruption of volcano Popocatapetl.Both stories had black charcoal-pencil-type drawings. The most important story(to me) was about a king whose body was square, while all his subjects bodies were round. He wanted everyone to look the same as he did, so he ordered all the people to walk through a machine that squeezed them into square-shaped people. I have contacted GoldenBooks and they told me they were unable to help. I hope someone else has memories of this book and can help in my search. Thanks.\n\nI52 has to be related to S178, the stumper about the square king. I initially thought this had to be something from an Oz book, but the international stories don't really fit.\n\nTHANK YOU so much for the comment, at I52, regarding the mention at S178. The book, Walt Disney's Surprise Package sounds as if that might be just what I am looking for. After thinking about that book for the past 40+ years, I finally have a title to search for. And, obviously, my memory of it being a Big Golden Book was/is inaccurate. I will follow this lead and hope it nets me a copy. I cannot thank you enough for this lead and the wonderful service you provide for so many. It is so much fun to read through everyone's memories, trying to match theirs to mine in an effort to help. Thanks.\n\nWell, good news. I do know that WD's Surprise Package looks and feels like a Big Golden Book, so your memory isn't too far off, after all.\n\n---\n\nMy mom used to read us a story/book about a square shaped king named the Mighty, Highty, Tighty. He wanted everyone in his kingdom to be shaped like a square like he was. He built a machine and made everyone who was round go through it to make them square shaped. Everything was going well until new babies were born and they were always born round (like everyone in the kingdom used to be.) This made the Mighty Highty Tighty very upset. I can't even remember the end of the story. But I do remember my mom used to read it off of these ripped out pages from what was probably a very old book. There were illustrations along with the story as well. She used to read it to us as children during the 1970's, but it may have been as old as when she was a child 1940's Thanks.\n\nA Square World. I Googled it, and that's what I came up with. I can't find it in book form anywhere, though.\n\nH. Marion Palmer, Walt Disney's Surprise Package. (1944) I found the answer based on the hint about Square World. Thanks. Name of the Book is Walt Disney's Surprise Package, 1944. Related answers to S178, I52 in your archived stumpers area too. Name of story is \"The Square World.\" It is a Golden book.\n\nWalter Fish\n\nSometime in the mid 70's our school librarian read us a very odd and disturbing story. A fish accidentally beaches itself and despite trying long and hard, it cannot make it back into the water and gets progressively weaker. A woman walking along the beach stops to talk to it, and the fish begs her to help it, but the woman insists that she is sure that the fish is not trying hard enough and it could make it if it really tried. She leaves, and the fish dies. The tide comes in and eventually carries the dead fish away. Later, the woman checks back and seeing that the fish is no longer there, says to herself that she knew the fish could do it. All it had to do was try hard enough. What an odd storyline for a children's book. I'm hoping to find it, so I can reread it and see if it makes any more sense to me\n\nnow than it did then, or if it even exists. (I don't think I could be imagining it.)\n\nThis sounds like Walter Fish, which is a book that is not exactly for children, but more to make a point. All of the people in the story \"try to help\" Walter get back into the water by empowering him to do it himself, instead of giving him the practical help that he needed by simply picking him up and putting him back into the water. I worked at a home repair ministry camp where we used this book to illustrate that some folks really need practical help to move forward in their lives.\n\nThe Wana-games-ak\n\nThis is a story in a book that had a collection of weird or scary short stories. I had bought the book from a Scholastic Book order sometime in the late 1970s or in 1980. The one story I remember was about a skinny man/creature who was stalking a group of explorers. It would occasionally take a triangular bite out of a person. It was so skinny it could only be seen from the side. It had a weird name like Wamagismwak. I'm not sure that is the right name, but I'm pretty sure it started with a W.\n\nAnthony Boucher, They Bite, 1943. The story you're describing sounds like They Bite, which has been anthologized many times. For the time frame you're looking at, you might try The 1st Mayflower Book of Black Magic Stories (1974), Wolf's Complete Book of Terror (1979), The Best or All Possible Worlds (1980), or A Treasury of Modern Fantasy (1981). A man (Tallant) is out in the California desert, circa WW II, spying on a training school for gliders, when he starts seeing \"something little and thin and brown as the earth\" out of the corner of his eye, which he thinks is just his eyes playing tricks on him. Local legend tells of the Carker family, who had lived out there long ago, and were supposed to have been some sort of man-eating monsters. They are nearly immortal, can only be seen from the corner of the eye, and \"they bite\" according to one old man he meets. Tallant later kills a blackmailer who knows that he's a spy, and attempts to bury the body at the old Carker place - which is when he finally sees them face on. They look like small, brown, shrivelled mummies - but they are alive and he discovers that they do, indeed, bite.\n\nI found and read that story \"They Bite.\" It is not the one I was looking for. The one I read took place in a forest, perhaps in South America. And the creature did actually bite the people. It took triangle bites out of them. It did have a very strange name like Wamagismwak. It could only be seen from the side (not the front like the stumper title I submitted). The people sometimes caught a glimpse of its profile, but then it would turn toward them and they would not know where it was. I do appreciate your suggestion.\n\nMargaret Ronan, Master of the Dead and Other Strange Unsolved Mysteries, 1974. One of the chapters in Margaret Ronan's anthology \"Master of the Dead\" is entitled WAMAGEMESWAK, about a ravenously hungry spirit that is so thin it can only be seen from the side. In this version of the legend, two white settlers along Maine's Penobscot river buy a stretch of land and are plagued by the Wamagemeswak, who leaves triangular bite marks on them. The creature is a spirit called forth by the Native American tribes of that region in order to destroy all white settlers who come to the land. Many of the tribes consider it \"bad medicine\" to summon this spirit, fearing the Wamagemeswak will turn on the natives once all the whites are eaten. The two white men in this story are rescued by an Indian girl, who gives them a canoe and tells them to go, after explaining the legend of the Wamagemeswak.\n\nI originally submitted the Book Stumper called ï¿½Wana-games-ak.ï¿½ The last suggestion was indeed correct, that the short story is found in the book Master of the Dead by Margaret Ronan. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped solve it! My brother and sisters and I are very happy to be able to share the story with our kids :)\n\n---\n\nThe Wana-games-ak. After doing a lot of web research I found out that the story I am looking for is most likely called The Wana-games-ak. It is based upon an Abenaki mythical creature who is so narrow that it is almost two-dimensional. The mythical creatures are friendly and warn the Abenaki of coming attacks. In the story I remember reading the Wana-games-ak is mean and bites people.\n\nWantedï¿½A King\n\nFantasy book about a journey (Alice-in-Wonderland-style) through nursery rhymes, with illustrations in pen and ink. Includes references to tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum, and the main antagonist is called the \"alphabet thief\" or \"ABC monster\" or something similar. Guessing turn-of-the-century.\n\nMaggie Browne, Wantedï¿½A King. The description made me think of the story Wanted-A King, about of girl who goes (in a dream, maybe?) to a Nursery land and has adventures with various Nursery Rhyme characters, and discovers that the bad things they do in the rhymes are all the fault of the villain. One place it is available is in a collection of Victorian fairy tales called Beyond the Looking Glass, edited by Jonathan Cott.\n\nSOLVED: Wantedï¿½A King. Yes, this is it. I checked this out of the public library in grade school, and now that I have daughter who loves Mother Goose rhymes, I have been wanting to read this fantasy to her. With my vague and inaccurate memories of the plot, the hours I spent on Google did not pull up the right book. Thank you!!\n\nWarton's Christmas Eve Adventure\n\nThe book I am looking for is about 2 frogs at Christmas time. One of them is very excited to open the gifts and so goes ice skating to fill the time. An adventure ensues. The story may have taken place on Christmas Eve and the book would have been available in the early to mid 1970's. Thank you!\n\nLobel, Arnold, Frog and Toad All Year, 1976, copyright. I'm pretty sure this is one of Lobel's Frog and Toad books. I'm just not sure which one. The others are Frog and Toad Are Friends, Days with Frog and Toad, Frog and Toad Together, Adventures of Frog and Toad.\n\nRussell E. Erickson, Warton's Christmas Eve Adventure, 1977, copyright. There is a series of books about two frog brothers named Warton and Morton that were written in the 1970's. Warton is pretty active and skates around. I can't remember the story line, but this could be the book you are looking for. The books are: A Toad for Tuesday 1974, Warton and the King of the Skies, Warton and Morton 1976, The Snow of Ohreeganu, Warton's Christmas Eve Adventure 1977.\n\nRussell E. Erickson, Warton's Christmas Eve Adventure, 1977. Thank you so much for your help; this is indeed the book!\n\nThe Wasp Factory\n\nI read this book 10 years ago. I think there is a large insect on the cover of the book. It's a story about a father and son and the son has trouble going to the bathroom because he was mauled as a baby. I think it took place on an island. That's it except for the end where you find out the child is really the dad's daughter and he's been injecting her with male hormones and telling her he's a boy.\n\nIain M. Banks, The Wasp Factory. I'm fairly sure that this is the one. The copy I read had a vry stark, black and white picture of a wasp in the cover so that would fit, too.\n\nIain Banks, The Wasp Factory. Fairly sure this is The Wasp Factory (1984), Scottish writer Iain Bank's first novel (he writes his science fiction under Iain M. Banks). NOT a children's book. I read it years ago as well. Written in first person from teenage boy viewpoint. Boy is seriously disturbed. Mother died long ago. Lives with his father on an island. I recall the plot point of his difficulties going to bathroom, explained by father as damage from an accident(?), really because he was born a female. Not a book like you 'like' as quite frankly he's a sociopath, but one that does stay with you, also due to being well-written.Was the wasp on the cover in Black & White? - Abacus publishes his books in the UK and they're all stark b&w images.\n\nI was the original poster for this book. I'm sorry but when I posted this I didn't realize it was for children's books. I was a little curious as to why you edited my original title. I understand now. The solution is correct. Anyways, thanks for having this service and I hope it was okay to use it to find a book that was definitely not for kids. Thanks again!!\n\nWatch Below\n\nThe first page describes a space ship leaving a planet that's being drawn towards the sun and all the water is drying up and it's only on page 2 or 3 that the reader realizes the astronauts are \"fish like\" and not human. I think the book has dual plots with the second plot a shipwreck with survivors living in an air bubble for generations, having children and growing enough plant food to provide oxygen. I seem to recall the space ship plunges into the ocean and presumably the fish species and the underwater humans then interact - it's way into the future. I'm sure it's an old book since I recall reading it when I lived in Nairobi and I left Kenya in 1976. I've been looking for this book since then. My grandmother thought the author was Spurgeon but I've been unsuccesful finding it.\n\nTheodore Sturgeon.I don't the book you're talking about, but a well-known science fiction writer was Theodore Sturgeon who wrote during that time period.\n\nJames White, The Watch Below, 1966. This is your book - an excellent story with some plausible details (although a bit of coincidence that the ship was carrying so may lightbulbs...) It is considered his best work, but check out his \"Sector General\" stories too.\n\nJames Blish, The Seedling Stars, 1957, copyright. This is a long shot, but your description reminds me a bit of the short story \"Surface Tension\" which I read ages ago in some anthology or other. This story is actually the third of four related stories in \"The Seedling Stars\". The other parts are: (1) Seeding Program, (2) The Thing in the Attic, and (4) Watershed. Both Surface Tension and Watershed sound similar to what you remember, so you could even be combining elements of both. In Surface Tension, a starship crashes on an ocean world. With no hope for rescue, the few survivors modify their own genetic material to seed tiny aquatic \"humans\" into the lakes and puddles of the world and leave them a message engraved in tiny metal plates. The story then tells how over many seasons, the adapted human newcomers explore their aquatic environment, make alliances, invent tools, fight wars with hostile beings and finally gain dominance over the sentient beings of their world. They develop new technologies and manage to decipher some of the message on the metal plates. Finally they build a wooden \"space ship\" (which turns out to be two inches long) to overcome the surface tension and travel to \"other worlds\" - the next puddle - in search of their ancestry, as they have come to realize that they are not native to their world. Watershed takes a look at the more distant future. A starship crewed by \"standard\" humans is enroute to some unimportant backwater planet to deliver a team of \"adapted\" humans (resembling seals). Due to racial prejudices, tension mounts between the crew and passengers. When the captain decides to restrict the passengers to their cabins to prevent the situation from escalating, the leader of the adapted humans informs him that the planet ahead is Earth, where the \"normal\" human form once developed. He challenges the \"normal\" humans to follow him onto the surface of their ancestral home planet and prove that they are superior to the \"adapted\" seal people who will now be seeded there - or admit that they were beaten on their own grounds. The story concludes as the captain and his lieutenant silently ponder the possibility that they, being \"standard\" humans, are just a minority, and an obsolete species.\n\nJames White, The Watch Below. YES, this IS the book - good heavens, after more than 30 years of looking you've solved it. Thank you so much!\n\nWatchbird\n\nWaatchbird books, 1940s. a series of books about manners training with a \"watchbird\" stickfigure as the theme carrier\n\nTry Munro Leaf's Manners Can Be Fun, 1936.\n\nAlso by Leaf -- Fly Away, Watchbird! : a picture book of behavior, Munro Leaf, Frederick A. Stokes, 1941.\n\nFrom the foreword from Flock of Watchbirds: \"This Flock of Watchbirds was rounded up from old favorites that first flew through the pages of The Ladies Home Journal. They were put together before the war in three separate books Watchbirds, More Watchbirds, and Fly Away, Watchbird, but here they are now all in one flock to watch some of the regulars who are always with us -- like the Thumb-Sucker, the Show-Off, the Bed-Bawler who screams at bedtime, the Nail-Biter, Won't-Wash, and thirty-one others that could be removed to advantage from every home.\"\n\n#G116--Good Manners Watchbird: Evidently \"This is a watchbird watching\" appeared as a series of newspaper cartoons published around 1945-1950, as when my mom babysat she used the phrase to terrorize one of her young charges.\n\nInterpreting\n\nCondition\n\nGrades Leaf, Munro.

The book could be much older though. It was about fairies and pixies living around a pond or a brook. I only remember that there was a pixie named Pixie Trink who may have lived on a lily pad. Pixie Trink had red hair. I would love to find out what this book was and if it is available.\n\nP39: keeps sounding like Zeee by Elizabeth Enright.\n\nI have a nice new edition of Zeee here. It's illustrated by Susan Gaber in 1993 and in As New condition. <SOLD>\n\nthe title doesn't ring a bell but i would like to try it anyway. i will be placing an order on your website.\n\nAfter seeing these two books for sale on-line I thought they might show promise! Both are full of fairies, pixies etc. The Story Wonder Book, edited by Harry Golding, and Ward Lock's Wonder Book, a picture book for boys and girls. Both books are related in some way. One came out in the 1920's and the other was put out later, maybe 30's. Hope this is a lead!\n\nI believe the story you are referring to might be a Little Golden Book called Water Babies. The story is about three water babies named Nixie, Pixie and Trink. Yes, Trink has red hair and they all lived on water lillies. I believe my dad still has this book and if I can get anymore info I will be sure to pass it along. It is also possible that it is just one story in a book of many stories and might be hard to locate.\n\nThe original Water Babies was written by Charles Kingsley in 1863, and has been reprinted in various editions with various illustrations since. I don't know which version your grandmother had, but it's probably this story.\n\nWater-Buffalo Children and The Dragon Fish\n\nThere were 2 Chinese themed stories in this book. One of them had to do with a water buffalo and the other had to with a Chinese family stuck in the dark with a jade lamp. Thanks for your help!\n\nC58 Could it be this? I have sold mine. It has just 2 stories. I've just searched Lib Cong and \"Buck Dragon fish\" in Google to see if I could find out what story no 2 is about. Doesn't sound like jade lamps. Buck, Pearl S. The water-buffalo children and The dragon fish; two stories. il by Esther Brock Bird. Dell Yearling, 1943.\n\nWater Horse\n\nWhat im looking for is a story from i think the early to mid 1980s about a young boy whos toys come to life or something and from what I can remember it seems like there was a pink and purple innertube or something with a horses head on it and for some reason it seems like the toys were abandoned or something, its driving me nuts that I cant remember this but my mom and a friend my age both can vaguely recall something of this nature, The horse head innertube especially. Any informationm you may provide is greatly appreciated.\n\nThe more I think about this, it seems like it was the Loch Ness monster in the story and that the people in the story set up the floating toys, like the horse innertube to make \"nessie\" feel more at home. I cant locate anything about this particular story online though.\n\nDick King-Smith, The Water Horse. It's a Loch Ness Monster story, so it might be the one...\n\nWatery Grave\n\nI read this book in the mid to late 80's. It would be a preteen or young adult novel. I believe it was written in 3rd person objective. It involved a lonely or outcast of a girl who either imagines or happens upon a mysterious supernatural underwater world. She interacts with people or possibly mermaids there. They seem to know her and they call her by another name, something like \"Latevia\" (I think!?) At first she is confused but she is increasingly drawn to this world and eventually seems to gain memories of being this other \"person\" in a past life or parallel universe or something. She is beginning to unravel the mystery of who she was/is as she becomes almost consumed by this world. There is a very dark/haunting/tragic yet romantic vibe about it. In the end she has to choose between this world and the real world knowing that once she chooses she will never be able to go back to the other. I remember a poignant moment where she seems to be leaving the underwater world, and as she is drifting away a \"man\" is reaching out for her not to go. Possilby there was an illustration of this in the book. The term \"watery grave\" keeps springing to mind but I googled that and although there are several books by this name none fit the bill. Please help, this is driving me crazy! I loved this book and it would be great to read again as an adult! Thanks! Latevia sounds an awful lot like Palmer Brown's The Silver Nutmeg, in which the girl's name is Lavinia. Although I've never actually seen the book itself, I also voted for it on the Children's Book Council Reprint poll as so many others have enchanting memories of it!\n\nPalmer Brown, The Silver Nutmeg, 1957. I am not convinced this is it, but there are enough similarities I will definitely check it out. I don't remember any talking animals or singing. Unfortunately it may take months for me to find out if this is indeed the book as our small town library has to order from other places, so in the meantime I welcome any other suggestions!\n\nI'm sorry to say, the stumper description does not match with the Silver Nutmeg. This is a book I know well. Good Luck on your search.\n\nUnfortunately the person who suggested The Silver Nutmeg is on the wrong track. I'm quite familiar with it and the description here sounds almost completely unlike it.\n\nAndre Norton, Perilous Dreams, 1969, 1976. Just a thought. In particular, the first two parts: \"Toys of Tamisan\" and \"Ship of Mist\". Tamisan is a Dreamer, one who is able to share her dreams via telepathic links with clients. She is bought for the wealthy, crippled Lord Starrex and while in his employ stumbles onto her ability of \"dreaming true\" - actually inserting herself and her client into an alternate reality by focusing on crucial points in history - and exploring the opposite course. She takes her master to a number of other times/realities, but in each, her patron's nephew tries to kill them both, using another Dreamer to influence the dream. Eventually, she and her master overcome this nephew, but decide to stay in the final, mermaid sea dream/reality.\n\nI too have been looking for a book just as described by L166 -a lonely or outcast little girl who finds an underwater world under a tree but I recall the title being similar to Under the Nutmeg Tree and read it in 1968 not in the 1980s.\n\nJoseph Trainor, Watery Grave, 1983, copyright. Finally solved it myself and now have the book in my hands! Can't wait to read it again. It turns out this was part of a Twilight Series of books. I finally found it when looking under someone else's stumper for another book in the series when I queried the term \"watery grave.\" I had searched these terms on this site before to no avail but this time it led me down the right path. So excited I have finally found it after at least 2 years of searching! By the way, the name the girl was called by was LAVINIA, so I was off a little. Thanks for all those who contributed! I couldn't have done it without this site! I had the title right all along but can't believe it never came up during numerous google searches for \"watery grave.\"\n\nWaverly\n\nI think the title of the book is Waverly, could be Waverley. It's about a tomboyish girl, not very interested in girly or social stuff, who goes to college (Waverly is the name of the college). While she's in college she becomes more interested in boys (of course!), and at some point she goes to a dance where she wears a pink velvet dress. She also is involved with horse riding. Waverly is probably from the 1950's, possibly early 60's.\n\nWalden, Amelia Elizabeth, Waverly, 1947. Could this be it? Hardcover, Morrow Junior Books, New York, W. Morrow, 1947, 285 pages. There is also a mass market paperback edition---N.Y.: Berkley, 1963. Here's a description: \"From blue jeans to dresses....That's how Jane Townsend's life changes when she enters Waverly, an all woman's college in the East. Jane fights against this change, wishing to remain more interested in fixing cars than in dances, and in using her head rather than feeling with her heart. But the school, her roomate and classmates have a tremendous influence on her. And after the first exciting year, Jane realizes that there is more to life than her own small world, and that the boy from back home is not always the right one.....\". Note that the copy they're selling is not cheap---$30 for a paperback.\n\nWalden, Amelia Elizabeth, Waverly, 1947, 1963. This is a possiblity, though I don't have the book in front of me to check the plot.

I just found the Detroit News article and logged on. I have been looking for years for a book from my childhood. I am pretty sure is was called, Way Down In Tennessee. What I remember is that it was a story of two (?) little girls, one white and one black and spilled lemonade at a party. By today's standards you would have to say it was NOT politically correct eg. the black girl was the servant. But I remember sitting in my mother's lap and loving the beautiful pictures. Any help would be appreciated. Ah yes, when was I a little girl??? bd. 1945, it was probably published in the late 40's. As I look back on it, the book certainly portrayed the racial attitudes of the time, but I was blissfully unaware of these aa a little child. Thanks so much for your help.\n\nI've found a book by the title you name, 'Way Down in Tennessee. It's by Elvira Garner in 1941. Tends to be expensive, but I'll let you know when I can find a reasonable copy. Here's a short description I found:\n\nscarce title by this author/illustrator known for her distinctive style. Red boards, yellow illustrated endpapers, colored pages alternating with black & white pages. The adventures of two little girls whose proper life in a big grey farmhouse contrasts vividly with the time they spend in a cabin with Aunt Rildy, Uncle Neal, and their ten children.\n\nDear Harriett, I am thrilled to hear the news that you may be able to find copies of Way Down In Tennessee!! Can't believe it. I have been looking for years. Keep me updated and thanks so much!!!!\n\nWay Home\n\nI have only vague memories of this book. A brother and sister and another boy--I believe their nature-hating cousin--end up lost in the Australian Outback. A helicopter or small plane crash, perhaps? Some kind of magic is involved, and while they try to find their way home, they travel forward and back in time. They run into some kind of goddess who reprimands the cousin for not liking to get his hands dirty with earth. At the end of the book, when the boy and girl are home (I don't think the cousin made it back), the girl has a pet pygmy kangaroo that came from the past and is extinct in modern times, much to the puzzlement of a visiting friend of the parents.\n\nPhipson, Joan, The Way Home, 1973, copyright. This sounds like Phipson's The Way Home. After surviving a car accident and a bush fire, three young Australians find that everything seems changed and they are traveling through different places and times.\n\nThat's the book, thanks! I found a review online that goes into even more detail and matches the story details I recall:\n\n\"A wilderness journey becomes a sort of metaphysical adventure as well for Australian Prue, her seven year-old brother Peter and her teenage cousin Richard after the three youngsters are tossed over a cliff in an auto accident and then swept downstream into unknown country. The scene becomes even stranger after a brush fire from which they narrowly escape; encounters first with naked aborigines and then with enormous monsters indicate that they are traveling backward in time, and toward the end there is also an unsettling vision of the future. Prue and Peter do at last find the way home, aided by a comforting presence who materializes in emergencies and, they come to see, holds them and all mankind (seen as overpopulating specks) in his/her giant hand. Richard, however, who will not accept what he cannot explain, refuses to recognize the amorphous guardian and consequently is killed during a volcanic eruption. Admirers of didactic metaphysical adventure/fantasy will be impressed by Phipson's meticulously realized landscape and her skillful integration of different times and realities, but we can't help sympathizing with Richard's failure to intuit the relevance of all the prehistoric tumult or to trust the benign omnipotence behind it. (Kirkus Reviews)\"\n\nWe Are Having a Baby\n\nbefore 1974, there was a chilren's book written from the older sibling's perspective about getting a new baby brother or sister. It has black and white photos and in one of the photos dad and the older child are making scrambled eggs.\n\nShucks, I was so sure I had this, but I guess I don't. This very seventies book just came across my desk though, and I was saving it for the New Baby Catalog page. The pictures are in color though, and there's a picture of dad and daughter painting a dresser, and mom and dad with coffee, but no scrambled eggs. Shucks. Here's the reference anyway: Jan Grant. Our New Baby. Pictures by Phillip Lanier. Childrens Press, 1980. Ex-library edition, worn and stamped. Poor. $5\n\nI think this is Mom and Dad and I are Having a Baby by Maryann Malecki. But I can only find reference to a revised edition in 1982, and we no longer have a copy in our library, so I can't verify.\n\nVicki Holland, We Are having a Baby, 1975. I was read this book of black and white photos depicting the changes in family dynamics at the time of a sibling's birth when I was three and my baby brother was on the way. I remember the part about scrambled eggs especially! I found a photo of the cover-I am sure this is the book!\n\nWe Four Together\n\nI read this book in the school library during the early 50's. It was about quadruplets (3 boys and one girl). They lived in London and whenever it rained they would walk in the rain in their green raincoats. Their mother nicknamed them \"Frogs.\" I think \"Frogs\" may be the title, but not sure. Would love to find this book.\n\nSee Q1\n\nF46 frogs: this reminds me rather of Exactly Alike, written and illustrated by Evelyn Ness, where the girl has 4 younger brothers all alike. It's set in Edwardian or Victorian times, though, so the raincoats don't sound likely.\n\nF46 frogs and Q1 quads: This doesn't look bad - We Four Together, by Helen Weissenstein, illustrated by Egon Weiniger, published David McKay 1947, 191 pages. \"Vienna of lovely pastries, charming buildings and old gardens is recaptured in this story of little quadruplets who have an infinite capacity for getting in and out of mischief. Maxel, Poldi, Ferdel and Lisel, three boys and a girl, are fourfold fun, warmth and reqard to their family ... There is a birthday cake too, not four cakes, mind you, a wonderful one with forty candles.\" (BRD 1948) Is the poster absolutely sure they lived in London?\n\nYipeee! This must be it!! We Four Together by Helen Weissenstein (David McKay Co.)1947. Setting:Vienna! First chapter- Egon stays with grandmother for a short time and returns home to find Mother has had triplets! Chapter two- fast forward 10 years- \"'Don't they look like four cheerful little frogs?' he had asked, and the family had used the name ever since because it was so handy.\" Book has green endpapers with 4 frogs sitting in a circle on lilypads.\n\n---\n\nBook about quadruplets (3 boys and one girl) living in London, England.

Takes place in Vienna!\n\nWe Help Mommy\n\nI am looking for a book about a little girl who plays house. It is probably from the 60's and could be a Little Golden book, I remember the little girl washes her doll clothes in the yard and hangs them on the clothesline to dry. Also, maybe the brother has a ride-on car and goes off to \"work\". they could even have a playhouse. This is all that I can recall but I do remember it was my favorite book.\n\nThere is an Eloise Wilkin Little Golden Book called Come Play House (by Edith Oswald, 1948, LGB# 44); but the most popular of this ilk is Sharon Kane's Little Mommy (1967, LGB# 569).\n\nLois Lenski, Let's Play House. Another possibility that does include Molly and Polly washing the dolls' clothes and hanging them up to dry. They also take their dolls for a walk, play grocery store with a boy named Peter, and play doctor when the dolls get sick.\n\nJean Cushman, We Help Mommy, 1959. This book is about a brother and sister who are helping their mother with daily chores. The girl washes her doll clothes and hangs them on a toy-sized clothes line.\n\nWe Like To Visit Grandma and Grandpa\n\nTwo children, a boy and a girl, probably preschool or elementary school go to visit their grandparents. They go to church with grandma and grandpa and pray together. They do other things as well but I can't remember what. I read this book when I was prolly around 4 or 5 so early 1980's. I read it from the church library. It was very likely published by a religious-based publisher. I remember in the illustrations that all characters have fairly round heads. Grandpa is bald on top with hair on the sides I believe and glasses. Grandma has glasses and I believe her hair's in a bun. She's wearing a dress with an apron over it. I thought the title was \"We Visit Grandma and Grandpa\" but I've done extensive searches on that title and variations and can't find it.\n\nCachiaras, Dot, We Like To Visit Grandma and Grandpa, Standard, 1975. \"Two children visiting with their grandparents play, work, visit others, and go to church with them.\"\n\nWe Shook the Family Tree\n\nI saw this story in a old (pre-1970?) textbook - it presumably takes place in the 1950s, but may have been written later. The story is told in the first person. A sullen girl named Hildegarde despairs of being invited to the prom, and when she is, it's by the clueless, class brain/nerd (whom her parents like and who always wears shorts). She wants to wear something sexy and Spanish-looking \"like the other girls\" but her mother only says \"I can't imagine what the other mothers are thinking\". Her date shows up at her house, and when he does, she's tempted \"to push him down the steps\" because he's in shorts. Naturally, he's not the best dancer. His gorgeous male cousin (in long pants)shows up at the prom and she manages to spend as much time with him as politely possible. (She's so dazzled by him that she thinks at one point \"if he'd told me he'd just slain a dozen dragons, I'd have accepted it without question\".) She makes it clear to him that she never wanted to come with her date. At the end of the story, she refers to other dates in later years - her mother would always annoy her by asking about each one: \"Dear, do we know his family?\" The girl would think: \"...If he wore long pants and liked Guy Lombardo, what more could she want?\"\n\nThis sounds like it was excerpted from Hildegarde Dolson's delightful autobiography, We Shook the Family Tree. One chapter is titled \"The First Prom's the Hardest,\" and fits the description: after Freddie -- who\n\nalways wears short pants -- invites Hildegarde to the dance and she's unable to refuse, her mother fixes her dress and (to quote from the book) \"listened unmoved to my wild-eyed descriptions of what the other girls were\n\nwearing. 'I don't know what their mothers can be thinking of,' she'd say firmly, making it clear that my chances of getting a pleated red crepe and high-heeled satin slippers to match were as remote as Judgement day.\" Hildegarde does get to wear a Spanish shawl (formerly decorating the piano), resists the urge to push Freddie off the porch when he calls for her, and, at the dance, meets Fred's tall, handsome cousin. The chapter concludes with the comment about knowing the boy's family and the reference to Guy Lombardo and long pants.\n\nI'll assume that's it - thanks.\n\nI happened upon your website while looking for author, Hildegarde Dolson, a childhood heroine of mine. I lived in her\n\nhometown, Franklin, Pennsylvania, and knew intimately many of the places she talked about in her book, we Shook the Family Tree. Fifty five years later, I decided that I had to own that book again!\n\nWe Went Looking\n\nthe title may be something like \"We went looking for a Badger\" and it tells the story of a group who go...\"looking for a badger in some badger looking weeds\" but of course find lots of other backyard wildlife but no badgers. I read this with my children over 2o years ago and it is no longer found at the library we used then. It sticks in the mind and I would love to find a copy to share with grandchildren!\n\nFisher, Arleen Lucia, We Went Looking, 1968. \"Recounts in verse the animals seen while looking for a badger.\"\n\nThough I haven't read the book, it matches the description of WE WENT LOOKING by Aileen Fisher, 1968. Written in rhyme, it describes the animals found while looking for a badger.~from a librarian\n\nI am B320 Badger. Thanks to you and the retired librarian who posted a note, I did find the book. She is exactly right and I now have a copy from the Tucson Public Library that was being discarded. I have thought about this book for years and even done some searches unsuccessfully before. I am so glad I ran into your site and am grateful to you for keeping it running so well. Here's hoping lots more stumpers are solved for those looking for a special book!\n\nI had to laugh when the poster of this stumper assumed I must be a retired librarian. I'm only 32 years old!~from a librarian\n\nWe Were Tired of Living in a House\n\nAm looking for a book about a group of kids who don't want to live in a house anymore. They go around trying out other places like a cave and a tree. Their pictures are all black and white if I remember correctly and they eventually decide that home is better after all. I read this when I was a kid late 70s early 80s and would love to find it for my daughter. Thanks\n\nLiesel Moak Skorpen, We Were Tired of Living in a House. Check the Big Online Bookseller--copies are still available.\n\nLiesel Moak Skorpen, We were tired of living in a house. 1969. I''m sure this is the book the poster is looking for. First the children decide to live in a tree, but they fall out, so then they try a pond, but they sink, then a cave and so on. Very cute. If Harriet doesn't have a copy of this book, I would be willing to give it to the original poster as my children have outgrown it and have no attachment to it. (I really need to thin out the bookshelf- lol)'\n\nOne of Doris Burn's books? She wrote/illustrated Andrew Henry's Meadow in 1965 (see Solved Mysteries), and it's due to be released as a film in 2008! However, other possibilities are Burn's The Summerfolk and a book by Liesel Moak Skorpen, We Were Tired of Living in a House, which Burn illustrated.

We were tired of living in a house so we packed up our coats, and our --- and a frog who was a particular friend and we moved to a cave.

I like the original better.'\n\nLiesel Moak Skorpen, We Were Tired of Living In A House, 1969. 'I know this is what you are looking for. The original book was illustrated by Doris Burn. If you read this in the late 70s or early 80s these are the illustrations you will remember. There is a newer printing of the book with new illustrations which aren't, in my opinion, as good.

Library of Congress # 79-79485Published by Coward-McCann, Inc NY.\n\n--------------------\n\nStory was that the kids were misbehaving in their own house, drawing on walls with crayons and their mom yelled at them, so they set out to find other house - ie, a bear cave, a treehouse, a houseboat, a fort in the tall grass? But then realized the best place was home.\n\nLiesel Moak Skorpen, We Were Tired of Living in a House.\n\nWe Were Tired Of Living In a House. Sounds like this story, the kids were made at their parents (and vice versa) over all the rules imposed on living in a regular house, so the kids and family dog pack up and try out several other places as described, a cave, a treehouse, etc. They enjoy each one, at least until something goes wrong, such as rain, falling out of the tree, meeting bears, etc. They finally return home along with pretty rocks, shells, other mementos of their adventures, all is forgiven on both sides. The story had a light-hearted air, told more as an afternoon adventure than serious running away, and had great illustrations of all the wild homes. Hope this is your book.\n\nSOLVED: Liesel Moak Skorpen, We were tired of living in a house, 1969. That is the Book! Thank you so much!!! I have been trying to find it for about 10 years! Thank you!\n\nWedding in the Family\n\nSeries of books for young girls about an American family. The heroine's name was Toby/Tobi/Tobey? One of the books was about her big sister getting married and I think was called something like \"Family Wedding\" or \"Wedding in the Family.\" I read them in the 70's.\n\nRosamund Du Jardin, Wedding in the Family. Du Jardin wrote several series, one with a character named Tobey.\n\nRosamund DuJardin, Wedding in the Family, Mid - 1950's\n\nI have a feeling I've read this series, although I can't remember the author or titles. That wedding book had some difficulty with their Aunt Alicia or Great-Aunt Alicia, and the couple was going to live in a Quonset hut. In another book, the protagonist's boyfriend, Brose, ends up taking some other girl to the prom, so Toby (?)invents a date. Her little sister reads her diary and realizes Toby is going to be in big trouble, so get the older brother of a friend to be the date. Does any of this ring a bell?\n\nRosamund DuJardin, Wedding in the Family, 1958. From DuJardin's series about Tobey and her sisters Midge, Janet, and Alicia.\n\nDu Jardin, Rosamund, Wedding In The Family, 1958. Well, I don't know if this is the correct book since her name is Midge, but here's the description: \"During the summer of her sister's wedding, fifteen-year-old Midge finds a special boy herself.\"\n\nWedding in the Family - Rosamond du Jardin. The bride is Tobey Heydon, and this book concludes her series and begins the one on her 15-year-old sister Midge.\n\nHRL: 17 Rosamond du Jardin books have been reprinted by Image Cascade!\n\nThat's it! Wow! Best $2 I ever spent! Thank you all. I'm looking forward to reading these again.\n\nInterpreting\n\nCondition\n\nGrades du Jardin, Rosamond. Wedding in the Family.

New, $12.95\n\n\"The Wedding of Jack and Jill\"\n\nMy mother sang this song to us as children with the following: \"and the happy young groom wore a velvet plume at the wedding of Jack and Jill\".\n\nAt this link , I saw some sheet music mentioned, from something called Hip Hip Hooray, which includes the song \"The Wedding of Jack and Jill.\"\n\nHaven Gillespie and Abner P. Grunauer , \"The Wedding of Jack and Jill\". In the fall and winter of 1929 the Gumm Sisters appeared in three of the \"Vitaphone Kiddies\" short subjects produced by Roy Mack, including The Wedding of Jack and Jill. The youngest Gumm sister was, of course, Judy Garland.\" She didn't sing the song, but you'll get thousands of hits if you search for just the title. Lyric is by Haven Gillespie and Abner P. Grunauer and music is by J. Fred Coots. If you search for their names, too, you can find places to buy the sheet music and recordings.\n\n\"The Wedding of Jack and Jill.\" A Google search indicates that Judy Garland performed this in a 1929 \"Vitaphone Kiddies\" short film when she was still one of the Gumm Sisters. I also found an almost complete transcript from a performance by, strangely enough, the title characters of \"Laverne and Shirley\" here.\n\nWedding Procession of the Rag Doll and the Broom Handle and Who Was There\n\nHello. What a wonderful web site! I am searching for a children's book that I used to borrow from the library in the mid 60's. I don't know the author or title. It was about two things that got married. I believe one was a doll, and the other was a broom handle. The doll had lost her eyes and the broom handle found some for her, and they fell in love. The rest of the book is about their wedding. There was a big wedding procession, and all sorts of household items were in it, marching. It struck me that many of the books people are searching for on your site are fantasy. Thanks for helping all of us dreamy souls find our memories again.\n\nD2--The Wedding Procession of the Rag Doll and The Broom Handle and Who Was There by Carl Sandburg.\n\nYes!!! That's it! oh, thank you!\n\nWednesday Witch\n\nThe only thing I remember about this other book was a witch that rides a vacuum cleaner instead of a broom ( this would have been around in the 70s)\n\nThe answer to W30 WITCH ON A VACUUM CLEANER is The Wednesday Witch by Ruth Chew, 1969, 1972.\n\nObvious to you, but...\"Wednesday Witch\" by Ruth Chew.\n\nThank you Harriett! Mystery solved! The book is now on it's way to me. I can't wait to read it again and share it with future generations! What a great idea you have on your site!\n\n---\n\nI just discovered your site...It is fantastic! I've been searching for a book which I probably read during the early to mid-1970's. Its about a tiny little witch who rides a miniature vacuum cleaner. I believe she also has a tiny cat and goes to live in a girl's dollhouse. I vaguely recall- so this may not be accurate - that the girl made the witch tiny by cutting a small picture with her scissors. It was a paperback and most likely purchased through the Scholastic Book Club Sales at my elementary school. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis is definitely The Wednesday Witch by Ruth Chew.\n\nTHE WEDNESDAY WITCH by Rith Chew. Double-checked illustrations, and there was the tiny witch in the dollhouse, doing things like putting a chair in the bathtub so she'd feel more at home!\n\nW54 is definitely Wednesday Witch by Ruth Chew. A little girl, Mary Jane, meets a witch named Hilda who rides a vacuum cleaner named James. Hilda is not very nice, so her cat, Cinders, hides out at Mary Jane's house. Hilda comes back and makes the cat small with magical scissors and later the witch herself is made small and lives in Mary Jane's dollhouse for a while.\n\n---\n\nBoy flies out his window at night on a hoover or vacuum cleaner and says \"Home James\"; I believe I read this in the early 1970s, and loved it, but cannot for the life of me remember title, author or even the names of the characters.\n\nRuth Chew, The Wednesday Witch, 1969. A wildly imaginative tale about a mischievous girl, a witch, a talking cat, and a flying vacuum named James.\n\nRuth Chew, The Wednesday Witch. Two characters (both female) direct the flying vacume cleaner by saying \"Home, James!\" One flies out her bedroom window.\n\nRuth Chew, The Wednesday Witch, 1969. Its a witch who says \"Home James\" and a little girl who rides on the vacuum cleaner, but this must be what you're looking for. Check Solved Mysteries\n\nRuth Chew, the Wednesday Witch. If the main character could be a girl instead of a boy, this could be the Wednesday Witch by Ruth Chew. There is a scene in which the girl in the book, riding on the vaccuum cleaner, says \"home James\"\n\nWeeny Witch\n\nI'm also looking for a children's book entitled Windy Witch, (or perhaps Wendy Witch.) It was a book I read some time in the 1980's. It's about a young kind-hearted witch who foils the plan of her evil peers to capture the beautiful star fairies.\n\nW34: Weeny Witch by Ida DeLage, 1968. (Also the author of Beware! Beware! A Witch Won't Share!)\n\nI've been looking for this book everywhere! I think it is entitled Windy Witch, or perhaps Wendy Witch. It is about a young, kind-hearted witch girl who is scorned and worked as a drudge by her evil witch guardians. She doesn't fit in; she can't get excited about their wicked schemes or learn to hate the beautiful winged star fairies (moon fairies?) who live up in the heavens. Sometimes the star (moon?) fairies fly down to earth, (perhaps descending in the moonbeams or in the starlight.) One evening the jealous hags hatch a plot and manage to capture the star (moon?) fairies in thick nets of cobwebs. Windy (Wendy?) Witch sees the plight of the fairies and cannot bear it. She cries, \"I'll save you, star fairies!\" and uses her ever-present broom to sweep away the cobweb nets. As the fairies escape, the enraged witches charge at Windy Witch -- but the fairies grab her hands and fly away, taking her up into their ethereal home. There, before the queen of the fairies, Windy pleads to be allowed to stay with them forever. Regretfully, the queen tells her it is not possible, since only those born of star fairies may live there. Then the queen notices the moon-shaped (heart-shaped?) birthmarks on Windy's palms. The queen exclaims aloud and announces that Windy is not a true witch, after all, but a fairy child who had been stolen at birth by the witches. Windy is given a pair of wings and beautiful fairy clothes, and the fairies joyfully welcome their long-lost relative back to her true home in the skies.\n\nThis is a shot in the dark because I'm only going by the book's description, but it really sounds on target. It could be WEENY WITCH by Ida DeLage, 1968, 48 pages Witches capture the night fairies, but Weeny Witch helps them escape (and finds out she is really a fairy)\n\nWow! I am overwhelmed. Today, after sending my last e-mail to you, I stumbled upon the very book I'd just described to you. (I was resignedly entering the same old keywords into the same old places, just like I have so many times -- I have no idea why it worked this time!) Two \"miracle answers\" in two days! DeLage, Ida. Weeny Witch pictures by Kelly Oechsli. New York : Chelsea Juniors, [1991], c1968. Series: The Old witch series. After the witches capture the night fairies, Weeny Witch helps them escape and discovers that she too is a night fairy, stolen years before by the witches.\n\n---\n\nBeautiful color and hardcover book, early-mid 70's, about a poor girl who lived with a witch but really turned out to be the daughter of the fairy queen. She had a birthmark of \"M\" on the palm of her hand. She had no wings until her real mother found her...not sure if moonlight had anything to do with it. I just remember the book was always out as it was everyone's favorite. Would love to share this with my kids. It is not Little Witch that I have seen on here.\n\nSee Weeny Witch by Ida DeLage in Solved Mysteries.\n\nIda Delage, Weeny Witch, Awesome! Thanks so much. We have ordered it from our library. It sounds like the book!\n\nWeird Heroes\n\nAnthology of new wave science fiction tales similar to R. Silverberg's New Dimensions series. One story in graphic form with almost Ralph Bakshi-like illustrations, was about Na, a primitive man on a quest in a weird dimension for a sacred jewel to save his sick child. At the end an author's note says that he actually entered his son's body and will help him fight off the disease. Another story was about a dynamic young Hispanic woman who runs afoul of some crooks and does some Wonder Woman-like things in her attempts to elude them. As a child she had been beaten by her father for crying at night and disturbing her siblings. The book possibly had an orange cover.\n\nByron Preiss, Weird Heroes. Possibly the WEIRD HEROES series ed. by Byron Preiss -- the date is right and the orangeish covers is right, and it's the only adult sf anthology series of the period that I recall being so heavily illustrated and/or including graphic story contributions. On the other hand, I read all of these and do not recall the plots described, but on the other other hand I read them many years ago when they were first out and could very well have forgotten. Description of contents in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Heroes\n\nByron Preiss, Weird Heroes. Thank you! Weird Heroes is it. I remember the name Byron Preiss. The Hispanic woman is Steve Engelhart's \"Viva\". This means it was Weird Heroes 2. The story of Na is \"Na and the Dredspore of Gruaga\" by Alex Nino. For some reason that story wasn't mentioned in Wikipedia, but it is in the Internet Science Fiction Database and Harlan Ellison's online bibliography as he had a story in Weird Heroes 2 also. Nino went on with the legend of Na and other tales of Gruaga in Pioneer Komiks. You can see a great picture of Na with his family here.\n\nWeirdstone of Brisingamen\n\n1980s. this is a fairytale/fantasy book along the lines of the Hobbit from what I can remember. Set in the west of england. Place names I remmebr are alderley edge and wilmslow\n\nAlan Garner, Weirdstone of Brisingamen, 1960. This is Alan Garner's Carnegie Award winning The Weirdstone of Brisingamen: A Tale of Alderly. There is also a sequel, The Moom of Gomrath, published in 1963.\n\nAlan Garner, The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, 1960/1963, reprint. It sounds like this book (or the series of book he has written). \"Colin and Susan are holidaying in Cheshire. Unbeknown to them, Susan's charm bracelet includes the weirdstone of the title, a powerful stone of magic which the forces of evil seek to gain, while the wizard Cadellin (guardian of a band of sleeping warriors under Alderley Edge) helps her.\" It went back into print in 1998 so I'm sure there are copies available. Here is a site that discusses the book.\n\nWelcome to the Monkey House\n\nBook is a collection of short stories. I'm not sure if it was a children's book because I read it in late junior high/early high school. I'm pretty sure it's old, but can't be sure. One story was about a man with tattoos that were alive or moved or something like that. I think another story (not sure if this is in the same book) was about a man that learned how to walk out of his body - his mind went one way and his body another. I remember the first time he did it his body ended up in a lake or something. He ends up starting a community of out of body people and they get in a war with the in-body folks. I think they had a parade where they would get back in bodies or something. Towards the end the in-body people trap them in bodies but I don't remember how it ended. I'm not sure that story was in the book but I definitely remember the tattoo one. I think the picture on the front was of the guy with the tattoos. Thanks.\n\nKurt Vonnegut, \"Unready to Wear\". I'm not sure about the tattooed guy, but the out-of-body parade sounds like the story \"Unready to Wear\" in Kurt Vonnegut's collection Welcome to the Monkey House where out-of-body folks get \"embodied\" once a year for a parade.\n\nThe solution posted for M376 [Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles] should be the solution for S445.\n\nAlso, the story about the people who leave their bodies is definitely from Welcome to the Monkey House, by Kurt Vonnegut. I looked at a table of contents on line, but couldn't remember the title -- my copy is AWOL.\n\nKurt Vonnegut, Unready to Wear. Someone's suggestion of Vonnegut for the second story jogged my memory if it's a Vonnegut story, I think it's his \"Unready to Wear.\" First publication in the April 1953 GALAXY magazine also in his collections CANARY IN A CAT HOUSE and WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE, plus various anthologizations in sf anthologies.\n\nWell, About The Penguin\n\nThis is a really charming little book about a penguin named Richard who lives in the Antarctic. One day, Richard is out with the other penguins when the piece of ice heï¿½s on breaks off. As he floats away, the other penguins say ï¿½There goes Richardï¿½. The piece of ice is about to melt away when Richard steps ashore in South America. He then sets out on foot and has a variety of encounters with things/people that included a llama and a Mexican in a sombrero. He eventually gets a map from a man at a gas station and finds his way back to the Antarctic where he is greeted with ï¿½Here comes Richardï¿½. The book was about 20 pages long, about 7ï¿½ high x 4ï¿½ wide, and had a blue, board cover. The illustrations were line drawings in black, red, and possibly blue. The book was a hand-me-down from cousins in NYC whose father collected books. Based on their ages and the style of the gas station in the illustrations, Iï¿½m guessing that it is pre-WWII. I gave it my first love as a parting gift and have missed it ever since. Thanks for your help.\n\nDay, Price, Well, About The Penguin, 1939. Well, the solution finally!! After much research on the net, in libraries, Alibris, etc., my niece found a copy of this book - in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Only 3 copies are in existence. She photocopied the original blue-board cover copy, and then painstakenly reproduced it in book form, along with all drawings, as a gift for her father for Christmas. It was a fabulous gift, and finally after a 3-year search, the puzzle has been solved. I do have a photocopy of the book as another person, who wrote in, was interested in it.\n\nWesting Game\n\nThe word \"Towers\" may be in the title. '70s. The characters all live in an apartment complex. There is an abandoned house up on the hill. Turtle, the pre-teen girl, wears her long hair in a braid, and kicks people in the shin if they tug the braid. There is a boy confined to a wheelchair who birdwatches out of his window, and therefore sees things that add to the mystery, but can't communicate what he sees. There's an Asian wife, who longs for her childhood home. The plot revolves around a mystery, which has to do with the mansion on the hill. Each character is given clues to solve the mystery the winner gets the money left by the owner of the house. Turtle is always watching the stockmarket--she's convinced the answer is to be found in stock quotes.\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game. Definitely The Westing Game.\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game, 1978. This is a great book that won the Newbery Award. (And if you liked this, try a newer one called Holes by Louis Sachar!)\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game. One of my favorites! All the details match.\n\nThis is definitely The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. Sunset Towers is the apartment complex in the book and Tabitha-Ruth \"Turtle\" Wexler is the main character.\n\n#T127--turtle: You'll get a lot of solutions to this, at least, I hope so, as the title is a Newbery Winner! The Westing Game, by Ellen Raskin.\n\nHi, I sent in a stumper after hearing about the site on NPR. My brother, taking this as a challenge for himself, solved the mystery for me. My clue word was \"Turtle\" and I described the book as being about an apartment complex and its residents who were trying to solve a mystery. The book is The Westing Game. Thanks for getting my brother motivated!\n\n---\n\nThis is a mystery story (at least I think it's a mystery)I read in high school in the early 80's. I have only one memory about it: One of the characters is a woman who is using crutches that she paints everyday to match her outfits. This will be better than winning the lottery (almost!) if anyone can help. Thanks\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game, 1979\n\nThe Westing Game. Sydelle Pulaski is one of the characters in the book and she does paint her crutches in different colours.\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game. This is the one!\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game, 1978,1992. Yes! Oh JOY! I NEVER thought I would know the name of this book! Thank you SO much! I've already been to the library today and checked it out -- can't wait to start it!!!!\n\n---\n\nThis book's title was The ____________ Game. I don't remember what goes in the blank. It was a chapter book and I would have read it in the late 70s-early 80s. It was about a group of people that received clues to solve some riddle/mystery. I think the people all lived in an apartment building across the street from a mansion. I also want to say that at the beginning of each chapter was a new clue. I remember the book jacket being black with a house on it. I think the house was made of bright green bills. I want to say it was The Money Game or The Playing Game or....\n\nThe Westing Game.Can't remember the author, but this book is readiily available, and great.\n\nI've already been to the library today and checked it out -- can't wait to start it!!!!\n\n---\n\nThis book was required reading when I was in 6th grade in 1985/86. The girl and other heirs race to solve a riddle/mystery so they can inherit. Her dad was a bookie (I didn't know what this was at the time, the book made it seem bad). In the end she solves the mystery and the dead relative isn't dead after all (concludes in a big house on a hill, where the rich man lived). Her name possibly starts with a J, maybe Janice?\n\nThanks!\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game.Sounds like The Westing Game to me.\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game. My daughter says it can't be anything but The Westing Game. see solved mysteries for many descriptions.\n\nRaskin, Ellen, The Westing Game,1978. Not 100%, I haven't read this since the 80's, but I'm pretty sure this is the book. I'm sitting here, skimming the 1st chapter and the girl's name is Turtle Wexler, but her father is Jake. Six families are specially selected as tenants for the Sunset Towers Apts. One of the tenants is a bookie, one is a burglar, one is a bomber, and one is a mistake. The will challenges the heirs to a contest to discover which of them is Westing's murderer. Lots of twists and a surprising ending. This was a Newberry Award book and was required reading in our elementary school in 86 or 87. You''ll probably get lots of answers on this.\n\nEllen Raskin, The Westing Game. Definitely this book, as I just read it (because I saw it mentioned on another stumper!). The girl goes by the name of Turtle.\n\nYou solved my stumper! Thanks so much. Now the nagging in the back of my brain trying to remember the title is gone :) Love your site!\n\nWhales Go By\n\nA friend of mine and I were discussing books from our childhoods and she remembered a book about a mother whale and her baby and the adventures they had. This friend is about 50 years old, so I have to assume the publication date was 1960 or earlier. An idea what book she might be talking about?\n\nKeep finding more as I get a chance to read the list. W26 sounds like Whales Go By by Fred B. Phleger and illus. by Paul Galdone. it's a Beginner Book published by Random House in 1959 I got it from the book club when I was a kid. Can't remember all the details but a whale is born and he and it's mother travel down the coast\n\nto the winter feeding ground.\n\nOooo, good find. Yes, please search for one.\n\nWhat Can I Dream About?\n\nI'm looking for a book I read to my children and now want to read to my grandchildren. I'm not sure of the name but I thought it was \"What will I dream of?\" The children ask questions such as \"what if a pirate comes to take me away?\" and the mom answers \"Tell him he has to ask ME before you go to play!\" There are dragons, ogres, etc. The illustrations are great and the words are simple and repetitive.\n\nArnold Shaprio Illustrated by Pat Paris, What Can I Dream About, 1987. After months of looking for this book, I found it in a box in the garage! It is just what I remember it to be and now I can share it with my grandchildren.\n\nArnold Shapiro, What Can I Dream About?1987 'The poster did not give an approximate year when she read this book to her children, so I am not sure if this one was published early enough to be it, but it seems to fit the description. It is a rhyming picture book in which little Deborah thinks of all the scary things she might dream about and her mother turns each fear into a funny situation in which Deborah is in control.\n\nSesyle Joslin, What Do You Say, Dear? Illustrated by Maurice Sendak It's long shot but the question of what is the mannerly response to a ridiculous situation reminds me of this series. Bad Nose Bill asks you if you want him to shoot a hole in your head. What do you say, Dear? No, thank you. You drop in on the Duchess only it makes a rather large hole in her roof. What do you say, dear? I'm sorry! There is at least one more book in the same vein called \"What Do You Do, Dear? A search by her name has given me a long list many of which are silly etiquette books.\n\nWhat Could Go Wrong?\n\nEarly to mid 1990s or earlier, juvenile; when I was in elementary school in the early to mid 1990s, I read a book about a couple of kids/young teens (2 or 3 characters) who were trying to solve a mystery. At least part of the setting took part in an airport and they were following a man. One of the clues had to do with a crossword puzzle.\n\nWillo Davis Roberts, What Could Go Wrong?, 1989, approximate.Three cousins travel across country alone on a plane to visit relatives, and get involved in a mystery during their flights. The cover has a crossword puzzle in the background, with three kids in front of it, and a man fleeing with a suitcase. I think this is the book you're looking for!\n\nWillo Davis Rogers, What Could Go Wrong? Thanks for finding the book I was looking for!\n\nWhat Daddies Do\n\nI am looking for a book I had about 20 years ago. The only thing I remember is Harold Bean or \"Have you seen Harold Bean...who's smile is wide and hat is green.\" That is all I can remember.\n\nThis is Charlotte Herman, String Bean ('72). Harold aka String Bean.\n\nA bit more on the suggested answer: Herman, Charlotte String Bean New York, Young Reader's Press 1973 \"Everyone told Harold that he was too skinny, and called him String Bean. Harold tries to gain weight without much success.\" Doesn't say whether it's in rhyme.\n\nEileen Rosenbaum, What Daddies Do, 1970. The stumper requester used the phrase \"...Harold Bean, who's smile is wide, who's hat is green.\" This is NOT String Bean (I own that, too) This is from What Daddies Do by Eileen Rosenbaum. It is a rhyming book of all of the different jobs daddies go to when they leave the house in the morning. Following Harold Bean through the book we find out in the end that he is the ice cream man.\n\nWhat Do People Do All Day?\n\nThis is a Richard Scarry book that I read around 1970-71. I just cannot recall the title. It was a hard-cover book that contained many scenes and stories about the lives of the animal inhabitants of Richard Scarry's world. I can recall three scenes/stories within this book. The first story is about a group of people going on a cruise aboard a large ocean-liner. The color of the ship is dark-blue/purple. Once the ship is at sea, it gets caught in a violent storm. The ship sends out an SOS distress signal as it rides out the storm. In the end, the ship safely reaches land. The second story is about a group of motorists driving along a dirt road. It starts to rain, and the road turns into a quagmire of mud. All of the cars get stuck in the mud, and one of the scenes then shows a number of the motorists climbing onto the roofs of their cars in order to escape. The third story takes place at an airport where a passenger-jet is getting ready for takeoff. As the jet moves down the runway, a late passenger (a pig wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase) runs after it in order to get aboard. The pig is too late, however, and the jet takes off into the sky. That is all I can recall about this particular book by Richard Scarry.\n\nRichard Scarry, Things That Go. I'm not positive but I believe you are referring to Richard Scarry's Things That Go. I think he has some variations on that title as well as another book about cars and trucks etc. which is different.....but I think you are looking for the original. Good Luck!\n\nRichard Scarry, What do people do all day? 1968. I've just reread my copy of this and I'm sure it matches. The ocean liner is blue and rescues a boatload of fishermen who get caught in a storm and send out an SOS message. The scene with the motorists stuck in the mud is at the beginning of a story on making a road. I always liked the pig running after the passenger jet too!\n\nWhat Happened After?\n\nI'm looking for a book I read when I was a kid (I think 1950's) that tells us \"what happened after\" our favorite fairy tales ended -- e.g. Was Cinderella happy with the prince?, etc. I think it was called \"What Happened After\" or \"What Happened After Stories,\" but I'm not sure.\n\nBilsky, Eva, What Happened After?: some familiar fairy tales continued, 1942.\n\nMary Norton, Are All the Giants Dead?,1975. I fear this was published too late to be the title sought, but the description sounds similar to Mary Norton's Are All the Giants Dead? From the back cover of the 1997 reprint: \"One night, when he should be safe in bed, young James is whisked away by his friend Mildred to the fairy-tale land of Happily Ever After. There Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty are middle-aged gossips\n\nBelleï¿½s husband, the Beast, spends his days hunting dragon and unicorn and Jack-the-Giant-Killer and Jack-of-the-Beanstalk while away their retirement telling yarns about slaying the last of the giants.\" Perhaps worth checking, despite the date?\n\nBilsky, Eva, What Happened After?, 1942.After suggesting the Norton title as a possible solution, I came across a catalog listing for What Happened After? some familiar fairy tales continued, by Eva Bilsky, which would be in the appropriate date range.\n\nWhat Happened to Amy?\n\nWhatever Happened to Jennifer?, 1960 - 1970. Mystery. I read this book in the mid '70s, but it could have dated from the early '60s. Name in title may have been Jenny. Young woman, perhaps in her late teens, has a summer job (or internship) on a family estate. It seems that this place was close to a small community on the coast, I think it was in the New England region. She is helping to organize the family's archive. She becomes curious about her predecessor named Jennifer (who was there the previous summer?). The protagonist is living in the same apartment as Jennifer did and that might be part of the reason she becomes interested in the earlier girl. She asks questions about Jennifer, but everyone is strangely tight lipped and only provide curt explainations. Eventually she becomes convinced that something terrible happened to Jennifer and investigates. As I rememeber the story, Jennifer is found in the end, perhaps still being held hostage. The main character discovers some secret in the family's papers that explain the kidnapping of Jennifer. This is not Whatever Happeneed to Janie? by Caroline B. Cooney.\n\nJane Edwards, What happened to Amy?. I haven't read this but it has a similar title\n\nI believe this may be your book- What Happened to Amy? by Jane Edwards. The locale is Monterey. The young girl is employed by a mystery novelist and becomes curious about the former secretary!\n\nJane Edwards, What Happened to Amy? I did read this book and the description fits. I seem to remember scratchings on paper (like from fingernails).\n\nThank you everyone for the answer. I have checked the title What Happened to Amy and it is the book that I had read. I have also found a library near me with a copy. I am surprised that I made no progress in my own search for a title like the one that I recalled. I am also disappointed by how inaccurate my memory was of a book that had left such a strong impression. Again, thank you for the answer. Thank you Harriett for this service. I have found many titles that have been pestering my mind for years. I also enjoyed coming up with the answer to many of the requests - too bad I came along with these well after others had already solved the question! I am quick to mention your website to others. And I will keep coming back myself.\n\nWhat Happened to George\n\nThereï¿½s a Little Golden Book called What Happened to George about a pig who eats too many donuts\n\none day and floats away into the sky.\n\nActually, itï¿½s not a Little Golden Book, but itï¿½s about the same size:\n\nEngebretson, Betty. What Happened to George. NY & San Francisco: Rand McNally & Co. 1947 12mo.,\n\ncloth, pictorial endpapers. George, the practically perfect pig, has only one fault. What happens to him when he\n\neats a whole platter of doughnuts? very good in very good dust jacket. <SOLD>\n\nThank you so much! It was my husband's favorite as a child.\n\nHi, I am trying to find a copy of a story about a pig named George who ate too much, way way too much. This\n\nwould have been out approximatly 30 - 35 years ago. He ate so many donuts one day that according to his\n\ngrandfather, he beleives George just plain burst. Thank You\n\nHello, I am searching for a childrens book about a pig who eate too many donuts and at the end of the story he floats up into the air and then explodes. I am 44 years old so I'm asumming the book to be 1950's. can't tell u much more than that, but if anyone else was ever read this book I hope they remember more than I do. I want this so bad!!!!!! please help. if u can.\n\nThis is a memory I've been searching for!!! I was read the book anywhere from 1958 thru 1963. It is about a pig and I belive his name is george. he loves donuts, at the end of the story he actually drifts up into the sky and then he blows up! I can't drive by a donut shop and not think of this book. I tell my kids about it but they look as though I must be nuts. I'mm 45 and my youngest are teens now. Please try to help me find my memory!!!!\n\nmother pig bakes all the time. Puts cakes, pies, doughnuts on window sill to cool. Son pig steals and eats same. Mother always says, \"someday you'll eat too much and explode.\" Final pages, pig eats doughnut, explodes, ends up floating on cloud with halo.\n\nYou are Spectacular!\n\nI remember it was a small book like a little golden book. It was about a pig who ate too many donuts and exploded through the roof of his house. There was a picture of the pig flying into the air as the house is in pieces like sticks in the air. I am not sure I have the right title. It would mean so much to have this book to rad again and to share with my kids. I had a terrible childhood and this story is a sweet memory for me. Thank you so much!\n\n---\n\nI read this book a while back, about a pig who ate TONS of donuts, so many that he exploded!\n\nEngebretson, Betty. What Happened to George. NY & San Francisco: Rand McNally & Co. 1947. Already on Solved Mysteries.\n\n---\n\nI want to thank you for your Solved Mysteries entry about What Happened to George. I have been wracking my brain for many years for the title of this well loved book. It was a favorite of my family. It coined the phrase among us...instead of \"gorged himself\" it became \"georged himself\" when one of the children ate too much of anything. The book belonged to a cousin and disappeared many years ago but the memory and laughter it brought has lived on. I hope to share it with a new generation.\n\nWhat If?\n\nWhat if?, 1960s or 70s. There are many lines in the book that begin with what if... What if icecream ozzed from the garden hose? What if an alligator hid in the hall (closet) and ate your socks? What if lemonade grew on lemon trees?\n\nWhat if birthdays came twice a week? It was a larger books with fairly simple illustrations\n\nThere's a Little Golden Book called What If? by Helen Tanous, with illustrations by J.P. Miller (LGB #130, 1951), but I don't think that's it. The Big Golden Book of the same title is what you seek, written and illustrated by Robert Pierce, 1969. I've even got one, ice cream and all.\n\nInterpreting\n\nCondition\n\nGrades Pierce, Robert. What If? NY: Golden Press, 1969. Yellow pictorial cover, worn at corner and edges.
