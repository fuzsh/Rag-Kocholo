        "text": "Description\n\nFrom the master of the space opera comes a dark, mind-bending adventure spread across time and space, where Doctor Silas Coade is tasked with keeping his crew safe as they adventure across the galaxy in search of a mysterious artifact.\n\nIn the 1800s, a sailing ship crashes off the coast of Norway. In the 1900s, a Zepellin explores an icy canyon in Antarctica. In the far future, a spaceship sets out for an alien artifact. Each excursion goes horribly wrong. And on every journey, Dr. Silas Coade is the physician, but only Silas seems to realize that these events keep repeating themselves. And it's up to him to figure out why and how. And how to stop it all from happening again.\n\nPraise for Eversion\n\n\"Eversion by Alastair Reynolds is a masterful surprise in this author’s work ... a finely written science fiction mystery that I could not put down.\"\n\n—SciFi Mind\n\n\"Reynolds packs plenty of emotion into this mind-bending plot... The result is an excellent adventure that’s sure to keep readers on their toes.\"—Publishers Weekly\n\n\"The author of Inhibitor Phase (2019) and Permafrost (2017), among many other fine SF novels, just might have outdone himself here ... [An] utterly brilliant exploration of life, death, and consciousness ... It's his most ambitious, certainly, and at the very least, one of his best. Required reading for SF fans.\"—Booklist\n\n\"Alastair Reynolds is a grand writer with many arrows in his quiver...[Eversion] is a worthy heir to the time paradox plays of Priestley, which in turn embody the spiral-recurrence-with-progress notions of Gurdjieff; this book is an entertaining and thought-provoking instance of one of SF’s major themes, conceptual breakthrough, one which does not scant the heartbreak and frustration involved in such pursuits.\"—Locus"
