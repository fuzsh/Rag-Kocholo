I have books piling up on my Kindle waiting to read, but I'm always willing to make that list longer.\n\nI've also heard good things about Resident Evil: Village and Returnal, but I haven't checked them out myself yet. Subnautica: Below Zero was so good that I kept playing it after beating the story, which by the way had a fantastic ending. In case I hadn't recommended that enough recently.\n\nI also watched through Ted Lasso, which I enjoyed despite knowing literally nothing about soccer. I was pretty sure it was played in a rink.\n\nI'll let you know next week what I end up consuming in the limited amount of time I'm allowed to stop typing. Whoever makes the winning recommendation will have earned my undying respect.\n\nSecond place gets an actual dragon egg.\n\nThird? A half-punched Krispy Kreme frequent customer card.\n\n​If that's not enough motivation, I don't know what is.\n\n-Will\n\n​The Knight Progress:\n\nThird Life\n\nLast Written:\n\n\"I couldn't leave it all to the power of friendship.\"\n\nAmount Complete:\n\nFriendship%\n\nArchives\n\nJune 2024\n\nMay 2024\n\nApril 2024\n\nMarch 2024\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nDecember 2023\n\nNovember 2023\n\nOctober 2023\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nAugust 2023\n\nJuly 2023\n\nJune 2023\n\nMay 2023\n\nApril 2023\n\nMarch 2023\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nDecember 2022\n\nNovember 2022\n\nOctober 2022\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nAugust 2022\n\nJuly 2022\n\nJune 2022\n\nMay 2022\n\nApril 2022\n\nMarch 2022\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nDecember 2021\n\nNovember 2021\n\nOctober 2021\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nAugust 2021\n\nJuly 2021\n\nJune 2021\n\nMay 2021\n\nApril 2021\n\nMarch 2021\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nDecember 2020\n\nNovember 2020\n\nOctober 2020\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nAugust 2020\n\nJuly 2020\n\nJune 2020\n\nMay 2020\n\nApril 2020\n\nMarch 2020\n\nFebruary 2020\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nDecember 2019\n\nNovember 2019\n\nOctober 2019\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nAugust 2019\n\nJuly 2019\n\nJune 2019\n\nMay 2019\n\nApril 2019\n\nMarch 2019\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nJanuary 2019\n\nDecember 2018\n\nNovember 2018\n\nOctober 2018\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nAugust 2018\n\nJuly 2018\n\nJune 2018\n\nMay 2018\n\nApril 2018\n\nMarch 2018\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nDecember 2017\n\nNovember 2017\n\nOctober 2017\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nAugust 2017\n\nJuly 2017\n\nJune 2017\n\nMay 2017\n\nApril 2017\n\nMarch 2017\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nJanuary 2017\n\nDecember 2016\n\nNovember 2016\n\nOctober 2016\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nAugust 2016\n\nJuly 2016\n\nJune 2016\n\nMay 2016\n\nApril 2016\n\nMarch 2016\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nDecember 2015\n\nNovember 2015\n\nOctober 2015\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nAugust 2015\n\nJuly 2015\n\nJune 2015\n\nMay 2015\n\nApril 2015\n\nMarch 2015\n\nFebruary 2015\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nDecember 2014\n\nNovember 2014\n\nOctober 2014\n\nSeptember 2014\n\nAugust 2014\n\nJuly 2014\n\nJune 2014\n\nMay 2014\n\nApril 2014\n\nMarch 2014\n\nFebruary 2014\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nDecember 2013\n\nNovember 2013\n\nOctober 2013\n\nSeptember 2013\n\nAugust 2013\n\nJuly 2013\n\nJune 2013\n\nRSS Feed\n\nWant to get short stories and book releases before anyone else?
