        "text": "After last week’s hefty (and important) BookNotes, describing a handful of books studying the history of the extremist politics of the far right in the last decades (and a few that are very contemporary) I want, now, to list six wonderful summer reads. Three are just now out, three you can pre-order now. Of those, two will be released in early August, and one is due mid-August. Of course, we can take pre-orders of nearly anything, any time, but now would be a great time to get on the waiting list for these three soon-to-be-released, forthcoming August ones.\n\nPlease note:\n\nIt is really helpful, if you happen to be ordering something that is in stock now AND something that is not yet released if you tell us if you prefer them to be sent as they are available OR if you’d rather we hold some until the others release, consolidating the order.\n\nLet us know how you want us to serve you. Again, all are at our 20% off.\n\nThe Narrow Path: How the Subversive Way of Jesus Satisfies our Souls Rich Villodas (Waterbrook) $25.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $20.00 AVAILABLE NOW\n\nThis one just released last week and we’re eager to send some out. We liked his first one, Deeply Formed Life which seemed to me to be a lovely combination of classic, evangelical piety with a bit of spiritual formation informed by the broader contemplative tradition and attentiveness to the issues of the day. We love it when pastors of very lively evangelical churches – Rich is the pastor of New Life Fellowship in Queens, New York – draw on the riches of the wider church and are unafraid to invite us to serious formation in the way of Jesus. (He has his undergrad degree from Nyack College and his seminary MDiv from Alliance Theological Seminary.) He is a wise young leader in a thriving multi-ethnic church. For those who have been following the fantastic (free) on-line video curriculum by John Mark Comer called “Practicing the Way” (in conjunction with the book by that name) you may recall Rich sharing his own conversion story in the first episode. He clearly knows something about the deeper practices that shape us into people who are like Jesus.\n\nRev. Villodas did am excellent second book that drew on line from a poem by Langston Hughes (again, something you don’t see in most evangelical books about Christian living) called Good and Beautiful and Kind. It showed the sort of personal and public virtues we are looking for when we take up the “deeply formed life.” I liked that book a lot as, again, it drew on evangelical faith language and his own experiences as a pastor in an CM&A church and invited readers into a culture of goodness and beauty, including the call to be engaged in anti-racism work and the like. Solid, delightful, beautiful stuff.\n\nNow in this brand new one, The Narrow Path – I wish I had time and space to summarize each chapter – he invites us into this paradoxical Christian vision of finding a richer, fuller life by pursuing what Jesus calls “the narrow way.” He notes in the beginning just how odd this sounds to the modern mind; who wants to be “narrow”, right? The very phrase connotes closed-mindedness, restrictive, maybe self-righteous. Nothing could be farther from the truth, he insists. Jesus’s call to discipleship certainly is a narrow way but it is a way that leads to a much fuller life. How this is and what it looks like is the theme of the book.\n\nSo, The Narrow Way.\n\nIt is a reflection on the Sermon on the Mount. I put most books about this into one of two categories: there are great exegetical works, straight studies, rooted in Bible and history, from John Stott’s great Bible Speaks Today: The Message of the Sermon on the Mount to Scot McKnight’s Story of God Bible Commentary: The Sermon on the Mount. We have one showing how various important exegetes, writers, and preachers from the past handled the texts. And then there is the stunningly broad and useful Following the Call: Living the Sermon on the Mount Together (published by Plough) which is an edited devotional of 365 varied readings on the Sermon from across the centuries.\n\nAnd then there are those that are most aimed at calling us out of our American materialism and militarism, even arguing – as does the must-read The Upside-Down Kingdom by Don Kraybill – that we put up “detours around Jesus” to avoid the hard teachings of his counter-cultural way. There are many serious reads by Anabaptist peacemakers and Catholic justice workers and others who have written books that invite us to radical commitments to citizenship in Christ’s new regime, his kin-dom.\n\nI trust Villodas a lot and I’d like to say this book draws on both the heady exegetical texts and the rousing calls to counter-cultural discipleship. But yet, The Narrow Path seems to be doing something yet again, a subversive call, yes, but really readable and not off-putting. It is warm even as it is challenging. He’s a pastor and a wholesome preacher and he obviously cares about his flock and he, as a writer, cares about his readers. He isn’t wearing his woke cred on his sleeve (although he easily cites Howard Thurman and King and Bonhoeffer and Hauerwas, even.) He draws on one of the very best commentaries on Matthew (by Dale Bruner) and yet never seems the least bit arcane. He is a practical, inspiring, preacher and it shows. It should surprise us as two of his mentors were Peter and Geri Scazzero (known for their several books on emotionally healthy spirituality.)\n\nThe Narrow Path is written in a way that seems safe and grace-filled with no heavy-handed, shaming calls to self-sacrificial obedience. It’s almost like a lovely, inspiring, Christian self-help /motivational book, inviting us away from self-defeating and toxic ways of thinking and being, and inviting us into the way of Jesus.\n\nWhich is not to say, good and beautiful and kind as the book may be, that it doesn’t pack a wallop. It does! Maybe that’s part of its subversion — it sneaks up on you, inviting you into a careful reading of the words of the Master, the context of this famous sermon, and the many implications for living in our twenty-first century, fast-paced lives. From sexual ethics to the question of personal wealth and giving, from love of enemy to being honest as people of utter integrity, there is a lot here in this short, punchy sermon. Villodas explores it all quite nicely.\n\nThe first part of the book is under the rubric “Understanding the Narrow Path.” After a brief interlude on prayer, actually, the second part is arranged as “Walking the Narrow Path.” These good chapters are entitled Our… Witness, Anger, Words, Desires, Money, Anxiety, Judgement, Decisions, and Enemies. Although it is brief there is a wonderful Afterword that I’m going to come back to, I am sure, simply called “Practicing Obedience.”\n\nThe ending, like the whole book, is immensely practical and invites us into the language or practices, hoping to encourage habits and lifestyles, things that will, indeed, yield happiness, joy, freedom, or (as the classic translations put it) blessed.\n\nWho doesn’t want that? The Narrow Path: How the Subversive Way of Jesus Satisfies our Souls by Rich Villodas is highly recommended, indeed.\n\nWatch the trailer here that advertises the book (but be sure to come back here to keep reading, and order at our secure order form page.) https://youtu.be/gq6xv_YeEv8?si=LKL6Yj042ranA458\n\nThe Hope In Our Scars: Finding the Bride of Christ in the Underground of Disillusionment $22.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $18.39 AVAILABLE NOW\n\nWe have quite a large selection of books from a real variety of perspectives for those who are deconstructing their faith, for those who are restless in their current faith tradition, for those who have doubts or those who have been hurt by the church and are wondering what to do. That so many have come out lately — from all angles and perspectives — is an indication, it seems, that we are well on our way towards what one author calls “the great dechurching.” More and more we have learned just how many people bad religion has hurt.\n\nI suppose I shouldn’t conflate these different sorts of books and memoirs, those who have been hurt by toxic fundamentalism, those who have legitimate doubts about complicated Biblical or theological assertions, and those who have ben burned by a dumb local parish with hurtful people or systems. Deconstruction and doubt are not always the same thing and leaving a bad church can be a sign of great faithfulness to the gospel. I get it. All of that may be for another post.\n\nFor now, though, I want to highlight this brand new book by the fabulous (and relatively conservative and delightfully Reformed) author and speaker and social media gadfly, Aimee Byrd. She wrote the excellent Recovering from Biblical Manhood and Womanhood and one on the sexual revolution (called, cleverly, Sexual Reformation.) She’s been cited in First Things, Sproul’s Table Talk, the PCA By Faith, etc. She is not particularly progressive nor is she deconstructing her core doctrines. We appreciate her bold voice and tenacity within evangelical and Reformed circles. But she has paid a price for her moderate concerns against sexism and such. Some have viewed her as “dangerous” because she dared to invest in the education and agency of women.\n\nAs with her other recent books, Byrd is showing a huge capacity for empathy for those who have been disillusioned or hurt. She gets why some are walking away from conventional faith and from the church. The Hope in our Scars maintains, with great grace, that we can create “healthier forms of trust” that can assist those wounded by the church. This trust can be deepened by recognizing the power structures that are at work in local congregations and bigger church systems.\n\nWe can free ourselves from tribal thinking and even celebrity culture and focus, with a healthy skepticism about authority (which has limits!) and give ourselves to relationships and postures that honor our discomfort and are honest about our stories. Our stories matter to God, she reminds us, and there can be “hope after harm” in the church as we are clear about that. This book, although written with a light touch, offers deeply theological and candid reflections, about our scars. She’s born scars and she knows many readers have worse.\n\nAs Kristin Kobes Du Mez (professor at Calvin University, and author of Jesus and John Wayne) puts it, this is:\n\n“A book for the bruised ones, for the smoldering wicks, for the disillusioned.”\n\nI appreciate other approaches and those who are even more hard hitting in exposing abuse in the church. But Aimee Byrd has an important voice in this movement of voices because, in part, she points us mostly to Christ Himself. As it says on the back cover, The Hope in our Scars offers, “…a passionate plea to work through our disillusionment with the church and rediscover what’s true and beautiful about our covenantal union with Christ.”\n\nI love the allusive and gentle titles of the chapters. The introduction is called “Beauty Rises.” Part one includes two chapters under the heading “Partners in Affliction” which includes “Disillusioned Disciples” and “Boatloads of Shame.”\n\nThe next two sections are “Partners in the Kingdom” and “Partners in Endurance.” These invite us to hold on to what matters most, to fight to love Christ’s church, and invites us to be “a church that sees.” I loved that one chapter alludes to the old Indigo Girls song, “Closer to Fine.” Hey, it’s not every book that alludes to the Indigo Girls, alongside lines from old Dutch theologian Herman Bavinck, British poet Malcolm Guite, Christian neurologist Curt Thompson, modern artist Makoto Fujimura, and medieval mystics like Brother Lawrence. And has a bit about erotic love and a good bit about laughter and beauty. And more than one quote by Frederick Buechner.\n\nNone of these are exactly underground, but in The Hope in our Scars she has opened herself even more to those marginalized and hurting folks, making this a searing but gracious invitation. She has been demoralized herself; she admits some of her own wounds, and she has learned to laugh at the incongruity of it all. She can help us find the very Bride of Christ in our pain. We can help others be heard and be healed. There is hope; we don’t have to walk away. This book is a gift and I bet you know somebody who would appreciate it.\n\nThis Sweet Earth: Walking with our Children in the Age of Climate Collapse Lydia Wylie-Kellermann (Broadleaf Books) $18.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $15.19 AVAILABLE NOW\n\nWhat a wondrous, thoughtful, eloquent, honest, poetic, rare books this is. It is somewhat about ecology and the horrors wrought by unstopped climate change. If we are paying attention, we know this is happening and in tender prose she mentions many sad truths — fewer birds, less rain. She tells how her dad, activist Bill Wylie-Kellermann, used to spray the hose in their backyard during cold Detroit winters a few decades ago and, as children, she and her siblings could skate; no longer; the winter’s are different for her young boys. There is much such sadness in this short, beautiful book and it is tender and personal. I found it very moving.\n\nThe book is, despite all, an homage to the beauty of the Earth. I don’t know if you had a chance to listen to our latest Three Books From Hearts & Minds podcast, but I highlighted three books about enjoying the outdoors, finding God in the wilderness, and helping children with a robust theology of creation by doing Christian educational work in nature. This was, had I had it when we were recording that pod, one I surely would have cited. It is beautiful, warm, sad, and touching. She tells great stories of her inquisitive children and their love for other creatures — there is a scene about feeding birds right out of their hands which is really nice. There are urban stories as well (Lydia grew up in Detroit and her parents were activists there, fighting principalities and powers and often joining picket lines or doing civil disobedience.) But even there we find a tender and profound reverence for the beauty of life.\n\n(Although, I have to say, as much rolling in the grass and walking barefoot through the weeds that her boys do, one might have thought she’d have mentioned what can be the devastating impact of Lyme disease, the tick-born disaster that is growing — yep, due to global warming. She is attuned to the groaning of creation, even though she doesn’t cite Scripture, and I kept waiting for something about this growing public health danger. Lyme, some researchers are thinking, is likely behind the rather sudden recent rise in sudden onset psychosis and the rise in Alzheimer’s.)\n\nThere is poetry and prayer-like verse scattered throughout. And a lovely little ending listing lots of practical stuff you can do; there is something for everyone to take new steps towards being in awe and in wonder even as we deepen our resolve to care for what Bill McKibben calls, in his very positive endorsement, “The deep tension between environmental despair and joy in the still-lovely-if-tattered creation we inhabit…”\n\nWylie-Kellermann, who directs the Kirkridge Retreat and Study Center, edited a stunning book just a few years ago that I have reviewed here at BookNotes —The Sandbox Revolution: Raising Kids for a Just World, which brings together friends and elders and colleagues she knows from editing Geez magazine and writing in Sojourners and various Catholic Worker papers. She stands in that broad, radical tradition of faith-based resistance and in this book, mostly about climate anxiety, she writes beautifully and honestly and hopefully about our fears and grief and anger. The future is precarious — we all need to admit that rather than live in denial about it — so, as indigenous writer and theologian Randy Woodley writes on the back, this book is needed right now. He says we should gift it “to parents and grandparents and everyone who needs hope during this time of despair.” Because, it is a book about hope, even as we learn to follow the abandon and joy of our little ones.\n\n“Wylie-Kellermann invites us to pilgrimage and prayer walk, toddler walk and tween race, to stand in silent reverence and thunder like the holy prophets as we work to protect a world that is fragile, fractured, and still so fecund! Read this book aloud with friends and build community; share it with the kids in your life to start to see nature as they see her; read quietly to yourself, and your tears will cleanse, challenge, and change you.” — Frida Berrigan, author of It Runs in the Family\n\nAnother Day: Sabbath Poems: 2013- 2023 Wendell Berry (Counterpoint) $27.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $21.60 DUE AUGUST 6, 2024\n\nSince I have not laid eyes on a single page or poem, do not have much to say about this new poetry volume coming the first week of August other than to say it will surely be one of the big sellers of the summer. Or at least we hope so.\n\nMr. Berry is known for his exceptionally thoughtful, sometimes even dense, prose essays, mostly about our common life and about how he cares for the broader culture by living close to the land, learning about his place, and stewarding older practices of farming (one book is called The Art of Clearing Brush.) He is a contemporary Agrarian and his insights into community and economics and patriotism and land use, even sexuality, are localist and often overtly Christian. Many of these insights – collected in the title of one of his best anthologies called The World-Ending Fire, or in the great one put together by Norman Wirzba, The Art of the Commonplace – are delightfully explored, and sometimes even clearly explained, in the plots and conversations and characters of his many novels and short-stories.\n\nHis slow, unfolding novels are all set in the same fictional Kentucky town and are rural, about agriculture and kin-ship, about food and friendships. Some of our customers read his essays first so to more fully appreciate his novels, while many read his fiction first and only then study his nonfiction. I sometimes think of him as a rural companion to Marilynne Robinson, a person of faith writing both world-class fiction and nonfiction who is respected for her social vision and excellent craft in the modern world.\n\nBut Ms. Robinson isn’t known for poetry, and Wendell Berry certainly is. He is a farmer and ecologist and public intellectual and social activist, but he is most known for his writing. And he has written a body of poetry scanning back a half a century.\n\nWe have learned that Berry often walks through his woods and farmland on Sundays, a sabbath practice, a lovely, reflective, prayerful habit and out of these weekly walks – saunters, John Muir might have called them – he has created a body of Sabbath Poems. There was a small collection or two, and soon enough they were compiled in a bigger volume, This Day: Collected and New Sabbath Poems (that came out nearly 20 years ago.) This forthcoming one, Another Day, due August 6, 2024, compiles 225 pages worth of poems that he did since 2013. Perhaps, for some of us, these show the very heart of his work.\n\nAs the publisher puts it:\n\nA companion to his beloved volume This Day and Wendell Berry’s first new poetry collection since 2016, this new selection of Sabbath Poems are filled with spiritual longing and political extremity, memorials and celebrations, elegies and lyrics, alongside the occasional rants of the Mad Farmer, pushed to the edge yet again by his compatriots and elected officials.\n\nCircle of Hope: A Reckoning with Love, Power, and Justice in an American Church Eliza Griswold (Farrar Straus Giroux) $30.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $24.00 DUE AUGUST 6, 2024\n\nI have read several books by the great writer, reporter, and Pulitzer Prize-winner, Eliza Griswold and think she is now on that list of writers who I’d read anything they do. She is that good. My favorite of hers was Amity & Prosperity, a study of two neighboring Western Pennsylvania towns and how the influx of fracking effected them. It remains a classic of contemporary creative nonfiction, one I recommend often. This new, forthcoming one — I have an advanced reader copy — is a novel-like telling of the rise and fall of an innovative Brethren in Christ church plant in the Philadelphia area (which grew to several locations.) It started a few decades ago when Rod and Gwen White, former “Jesus People”, felt led to start an unusual, deeply honest, organic, community of faith that served the poor in an urban part of Philly. Among their earliest colleagues and friends (if not a formal member, as far as I know) was the young Shane Claiborne, whose first book, The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical captures much of the earnest ethos and risky-taking vibe of the radical, Anabaptist, church for seekers and others on the fringe of the American empire. Shane and his pals went off to start The Simple Way and were clearly inspired by Rod and Gwen and the early days of Circle.\n\nI spoke in that church on two occasions, actually; it is a long story how I got connected but they were young, very informal, worshipping on a Sunday night where the snacks were big bowls of Fruit Loops. From what we’d now call exvangelicals to unkempt street people to Messiah College students studying at Temple University to youthful Jesus-loving hippies to straight-arrow Brethren, I recall that it was a wild mix, an exciting, evolving place to bring people together to worship and be formed in the ways of God’s Kingdom.\n\nEliza Griswold was raised in the Episcopal Church (her father, Frank, was a former Presiding Bishop of the denomination and himself a fine thinker and writer.) But I suspect that she had little awareness of all that was brought by church planters Rod and Gwen White — the fiery evangelicalism, the passion for evangelism among the hurting and lost, the small group strategies called “cells”, the uniquely Anabaptist social ethic and expectations for building a truly alternative spiritual community. It seems to me that the leadership offered by aging Jesus freaks who were Anabaptists (who loved the nonviolent anarchism of Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker movement) and the youthful zeal of those they attracted, was a far cry from the Diocesan styles Griswold knew best.\n\nWhich makes for a fabulous journalistic project; she cared about this eccentric church project and admired the various leaders who arose over the years. She understood (even if it was not her own particular tradition) their faith orientation and realized how very much was a stake. She set out to tell their story, in many ways, the perfect writer for this odd story.\n\n(Maybe you saw the recent Atlantic article about all this that appeared just a few weeks ago.)\n\nHere’s the wild, hard, sad, thing, the unexpected turn of events that made Circle of Hope the book that it became: before 2020’s Covid quarantine hit, Circle had become four main churches, a network of sibling “congregations” that met in different parts of Philly or in Eastern New Jersey, across the river from the city. As the book evolves we come to realize that the primary characters of the story are the four pastors of the four locations. Two men, two women, some people of color, all in admiration of Rod and Gwen’s robust and demanding leadership in the previous decade, and all, each in their own way, in profound conflict with them. And, it turns out, with each other. It’s enough to make you weep.\n\nAlthough Griswold mentions her initial interest rather briefly, and acknowledges all manner of scholars of religion and alt-type pastors who she looked to for input (from Nadia Bolz-Weber to Kristin Du Mez to Drew Hart to Richard Rohr to Michael Ware to Dante Stewart, all thanked profusely) Griswold doesn’t say much about what drew her to this innovative church in the first place. I guess the best journalists have a good nose for great stories. This one ended up being a great story which, if not exactly exploding in her face, did turn ugly as she started to do years worth of interviews, forming friendships, being a part of what they would all eventually realize was the beginning of the end of their visionary faith community.\n\nShe tells us that she started to interview each of the leaders and decided to tell each of their respective back stories — a few came from central Pennsylvania, so it was especially interesting to us — when, a year or so in, the conflict between various leadership styles, different theologies, and different agendas become unreconcilable. Almost any other group of church leaders, I suspect, would have pulled the plug on the writing project, telling the hopeful author that it just wasn’t going to work out. But, no; they endured, invited her into the full, honest, story, a story full of pain and joy, growth and deepened faith, great love and huge disagreements. As the relationships devolve (somewhat around the self-interrogation needed as they engaged in inclusive habits and anti-racist goals) the story devolves and they allow her to look over their shoulders and tell the truth. Amazing.\n\nIn Circle of Hope, the book’s subtitle looms large: “A Reckoning with Love, Power, and Justice in an American Church.” In this sense it is a page-turning read, a human-interest story about idealists and struggle and relationships, but it is, also, a cautionary tale of sorts, an allusive lesson for us all, no matter the shape and tone of our own institutions of faith.\n\nAlthough the raw stories of Ben, Julie, Rachel, and Jonny (and a few others; there is a chapter on Bethany that is very important to the story) are each unique and fascinating and makes for great reading, their interactions, their own personal cutting edges of their own faith journeys, their ways of coping with everything from isolation (due to Covid) and on-line / virtual worship, and the large social disruption caused by the Black Lives Matter movement and other allies of anti-racism, took hold in their already rather socially progressive ethos. The role of women in leadership was not in principle a contention, but, as everyone knows, even trained and strong women leaders have unique barriers and complicated contexts when they take up leadership in most churches. That many of Circle’s leaders were not professionally trained but called up from within the community / congregations, is itself a fascinating aspect of the story. The folks all knew and loved each other well, even as the tensions devolved to awful and hurtful accusations and too, too many fights.\n\nFrom full LGBTQ inclusion to the significant nuances of “doing the work” to become anti-racist to questions of how to keep up the demanding routines of social services, protests, and public witnesses of the churches became front and center. I suppose it isn’t really a “spoiler alert” since it is clear when one starts the book that these social and political and theological questions come to tear them apart.\n\nIt is a book that vividly and honestly tells the story of a rather unusual set of congregations — unlike any most of us have been a part of, I’d guess — but in a way, it is a story for all of us. Really.\n\nCircle of Hope is a riveting, detailed story of a handful of early 21st century Christians trying to offer something fresh and compelling that, in a way, is nearly unique in American church history. Neither a staid, liberal mainline denominational church or a conservative evangelical congregation, Circle embodied the vision of the alternative communities not unlike those formed a generation earlier like those at Sojourners or The Other Side or even places like Koinonia Farms. They were new, post-modern contemplatives, eager to share the Good News, informed by constant conversations and embodied practices of joy and lament, hope and praise. Alas, despite regular conversations about repentance and new life, fresh starts and new creation visions, they simply could not restrain the brokenness.\n\nBut, yet, as I say, the issues that tore them apart and the ways leaders did or didn’t lead well or faithfully, are for all of us. No matter how conventional or even boring your own church may be, these concerns about power and justice and relationships and gender and leadership and keeping the message of the gospel clear, are concerns for all of us.\n\nCircle of Hope: A Reckoning… is a great read, interesting and in some ways, maybe some small ways, hopeful. It looks at hard stuff, about how even those with socially progressive and faith-based values can’t always do the work to become fully inclusive of those who are seen as marginalized. Even when all voices are invited to the proverbial table, sometimes power and tradition win out. Does love win in the end? It is a live question. Any of us in even slightly contentious spaces need to be reminded of these best hopes and hard dreams. And what can go wrong.\n\nListen well to Ben, Julie, Rachel, and Jonny. Get to know the White’s who started the whole big thing. And listen to Eliza Griswold, writer extraordinaire, as she works for years to be able to understand these dynamics and report this story well, the good, the bad, and the ugly. And the deeply spiritual and truly beautiful. Circle of Hope: A Reckoning with Love, Power, and Justice in an American Church is an unforgettable book and it may surprise you. It may even, in an ironic, counter-intuitive way, inspire you. Pre-order it today.\n\nLife in Flux: Navigational Skills to Guide and Ground You in an Ever-Changing World Michaela O’Donnell &amp; Lisa Slayton (Brazos Press) $19.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $15.99 DUE AUGUST 20, 2024\n\nYou have got to get this book, especially if you feel as if your life is in the fog, in flux, if you are a bit overwhelmed or uncertain about choices (quotidian or large) that you must make. Who among us doesn’t face sometimes daunting decisions and lifestyle choices? Starting with a fabulous story about a guy — Lisa Slayton’s husband, it turns out — who navigated a small boat in a sudden, dangerous fog off the coast of Maine, the book offers navigational skills. The title and subtitle, unlike some books, are perfect. This book delivers the goods and plays with the metaphor with wonder and grace.\n\nI am not a big fan of self-help books, business books, personal growth stuff that feels gimmicky or overly focused on getting stuff done. I know there is a huge, huge market for leadership titles and practical guides to betterment, but I just don’t find most of them that engaging or that helpful. Man, am I glad I gave this a try. Life in Flux is the best book of this sort that I’ve read in a very long time. Thanks be to God.\n\nLisa Slayton is a leadership coach and old friend from Pittsburgh; she has worked as a consultant and even CEO of nonprofits and leadership development organizations. A lively, thoughtful Christian I admire her very, very much. So, naturally, I wanted to read this, and I was blown away by just how good it was, and how tenderly it spoke to my own quandaries about business, inner work, influence, and sustainable health in the marketplaces of life.\n\nMichaela O’Donnell is very sharp (with a PhD) and is a friend of some of my most respected friends. She directs the fabulous Max DePree Center for Leadership at Fuller Theological Seminary (we still keep Max DePree’s two books on leadership in stock) and is the author of one of the very best books on faith and work, the 2021 Baker release, Make Work Matter: Your Guide to Meaningful Work in a Changing World (Baker; $19.99 – OUR SALE PRICE = $15.99.)\n\nWhat a joy to see that these two have collaborated so nicely, and written this book in an elegant, fascinating, captivating voice. It is Biblically-wise and really very helpful. There are stories, case studies, social science research reports, reflections on seminal works in social psychology and work-place theory, leadership studies, Biblical reflections, and a great sense of integration of a Christian worldview with the best of seemingly secular scholarship. None of it feels tedious or laborious, and flows very nicely, even as they write about hard, complex matters of the heart and of the culture.\n\nI like that about Flux. It assures us that living in the liminal times, between holding on and letting go (think of the trapeze artist), is generative and hopeful, scary as it may be. And it clearly says, often, that there are our personal life issues to contend with, our stage and age and disposition, as well as the cultural forces and social pressures from the world that come into play. Even if we must grieve our personal losses — there is a lot on this, actually, which was beautiful and wise — we must be aware of the tension and maybe unrealized anguish that bears down on us from world conditions, wars and rumors of wars. We live in serious times and things need to be interrogated in our own lives as well as in our communities and churches, and in the broader culture and world at large. Oh yeah, they have the big picture about the zeitgeist, about flux and change and fog and risk.\n\nYet, the book is clear-headed and nicely arranged, with just enough bullet points and little charts to seem very, very practical. And there are poetic prayers and blessings at the end of each chapter as we take up the practices — they are all about the practices — that might allow us to slowly embody the habits of new and fresh ways of being in the world. Nice!\n\nWhich is to say, Flux is not mostly about work-world changes or growth in one’s professional life, even if many of the examples and case studies are about leaders, managers, supervisors, or workers in industry or other work-world roles. They consult with executives and entrepreneurs but the book is really about whole-life discipleship. It explores questions about how to bring a more wholesome sense of balance and life-giving energy for navigating the changes pressing all around us, in home, community, among friends and family, and, yes, in the job market. The way Michaela and Lisa move so seamlessly from sphere to sphere, from work to home to our most secret foibles of our interior lives, is nothing short of brilliant. They appreciate how things overlap. It is not only wisely whole-life in orientation, but draws together, as I’ve said, the public and the personal — offering what Garber calls “a seamless life.” It is both intellectually sound and written in a lovely, personal style. Life in Flux is a great, great book, firmly in the self-help genre as it may be and as practical as it may seem, rooted in a wholistic faith perspective and grounded in great truths, lived out in gracious, kindly ways.\n\nAnd the wisdom is good. For instance, they write:\n\nWhen things around us start moving faster, it’s tempting to lean in had to productively hacks and time management tools in an effort to make space for more. (Hello. The calendars I just described, above.) The assumption is that because there’s more coming at us and it’s happening faster, we need to do more and go faster to keep up. But the data shows that when we implement these tricks and tools to try to master our time or get it back, we most often end up simply filling our new space with more stuff to do. Oof.\n\nAs they later say,\n\nWe cannot frenetically make our way through life in flux. It simply won’t work. Trust me, though: this is good news. Our humanity is good news. Our limits are good news. They force us to choose a new way forward, limitations and all. But of course, that is easier said than done.\n\nAnd they they explain how, “when we are in the midst of disorientation, counterintuitive shifts are often needed. We have to move slowly and differently.”\n\nThere are, in each chapter, little boxes that contrast a commonplace posture or way of doing things, and their “uncommon posture” which offers a fresh take on basic life patterns. These simple but profound sidebar boxes with these concisely contrasting postures, makes the lively prose and updated teaching as clear as can be. Hooray.\n\nLife in Flux, due nearer the end of August, offers navigational skills, to be sure, but part of the first story (of Lisa’s husband stuck in the fog of a threatening storm in the rough Atlantic Ocean) shows how cutting the engine and wisely proceeding with intentional care is key. These portions are really good — and they just may save your sanity in these odd-ball times.\n\nThey coin a word, “unfigureoutable” and write with wit about “unfigureoutable” situations:\n\nUnfigureoutable spaces are still uncomfortable. Why? Because they are ambiguous. They’re messy, they’re risky, and they can’t be controlled. Even if we trust God and will find us in the unknown, the reality of facing that which we cannot see clearly is difficult.\n\nIt’s natural to long for resolution when tension is present. However, it’s in the tension that growth and learning occur, so resolving it too quickly (or sometimes even at all!) won’t take us where we want to go.\n\nDo you have some unfigureoutable times in your life? Tension anyone? Pain and longing that come up when thinking about change? Flux? Fog?\n\nIf so, you need to engage inner work, develop spiritual disciplines, and find healthy community. That’s another big key: as they say in chapter 8, one of their many “Navigational Skills” is “Don’t Go It Alone.” Their wise call to deeper friendships and Christian community is wonderful. Their piece about knowing oneself is essential and their insights about vocation and calling are excellent. Their bit about craft and skill sets, “Stay in Your Headlights”, is really useful; so useful. They have tons of points and take-aways for learning to be “At Home In Flux.” You’ll want to take notes.\n\nFrom “Checking Your Speed” to “Choosing to Let God” to “Setting Your Compass”, this is all clear-headed, deeply profound insights, drawn from the many years of interviews, cohorts, leadership, and in-the-trenches work these two women have done. They know about “coming home to yourself” and they want to help us all be the culture-shapers and history-makers that we are meant to be. I admire them, their work, and, now, their forthcoming book. I very highly recommend it to anyone wanting a deft and gracious connection of visionary writing about vocation and calling with pretty down-to-Earth and actionable steps towards navigating the ever-changing contexts in which we find ourselves. Ends up, navigating through the fog of flux is an essential skill for human flourishing. This book can help. Pre-order it today.\n\nThis book is a life jacket, a compass, a sextant, and a steady voice of calm for anyone trying to navigate the storms of a life in flux. I am going to be assigning it to every one of my students and recommending it to every one of my clients. O’Donnell and Slayton have brought years of deeply attentive listening, wide-ranging scholarship, leadership experience, and their own authentic vulnerability to guide people through the most turbulent moments of life. You’ll want to read, reread, and pass along the wisdom of this book to anyone in your life who is facing rough waters. —Tod Bolsinger, professor of leadership formation at Fuller Theological Seminary and author of Canoeing the Mountains\n\nIn a whatever world, it is very difficult to know who we are, why we are, and therefore what we are to do. How would we ever know? And what difference could it make anyway? In their new book, Michaela O’Donnell and Lisa Pratt Slayton draw on years of unusually reflective and thoughtful experience with scores of people and places to offer windows into the integral relationship of ideas to life. Born of their unique ability to see and hear into the questions of honest people longing to make more sense of leadership, Life in Flux is the best of professional competence formed by theological maturity, rooted in every paragraph by hard-won wisdom about the nature of a True North and why it critically matters for individuals and institutions. —Steven Garber, author of The Seamless Life and senior fellow for vocation and the common good, M.

Let us know your hopes.\n\nThe weight and destination of your package varies but you can use this as a quick, general guide:\n\nThere are generally two kinds of US Mail options and, of course, UPS. If necessary, we can do overnight and other expedited methods, too. Just ask.\n\nUnited States Postal Service has an option called “Media Mail” which is cheapest but can be a little slower. For one typical book, usually, it’s $4.83; 2 lbs would be $5.58. This is the cheapest method available and sometimes is quicker than UPS, but not always.\n\nUnited States Postal Service has another, quicker option called “Priority Mail” which is $8.70, if it fits in a flat-rate envelope. Many children’s books and some Bibles are oversized so that might take the next size up which is $9.50. “Priority Mail” gets more attention than does “Media Mail” and is often just a few days to anywhere in the US.\n\nUPS Ground is reliable but varies by weight and distance and may take longer than USPS. Sometimes they are cheaper than Priority. We’re happy to figure out your options for you once we know what you want.\n\nIf you just want to say “cheapest” that is fine.

Closed on Sunday.\n\nI’m going to describe eight books that I very much enjoyed in recent weeks. (Okay, seven I have read; one is “up next.”) And “enjoyed” is sort of a relative term. Some were a bit more dense and seriously footnoted than others but all were stimulating and kept me turning pages, sometimes late into the night. Of these, only one is from an intentionally Christian perspective, and it was very enriching.\n\nLike you, I’d bet, I love learning and enjoy when a good writer explains all sorts of new content, or reminds you of things you knew but frames it helpfully, connecting dots anew. Agree or not with the conclusions of the author, reading well-executed nonfiction is a true pleasure — and not a “guilty” one. I hope you have time for titles by good writers who in some cases spend many years studying their topic and writing their book.\n\nI’ve been on a learning curve for what feels like a decade, trying to figure out the history of our contemporary political mess. I’ve shared with you in the past some books I’ve read in recent years about the rise of the hard MAGA right, including pretty scary ones like We Are Proud Boys by Andy Campbell and the exquisitely done The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War by Jeff Sharlet, among others. (Much more heady and philosophical studies are part of this mix, too, like the recent Democracy and Solidarity: On the Cultural Roots of America’s Political Crisis by James Davison Hunter.) My urgent question is how the Republican party shifted from fairly public debates about the appropriateness of extremists in a party standing for traditional values to being nearly inflamed by vulgar conspiracies and untruths about stolen elections and voter fraud? Why did the party that I grew up with as exceptionally anti-communist end up cozying up to guys like Putin?\n\nTo tweak the Billy Joel song, it is clear that “Trump didn’t start the fire.”\n\n(For the record, I’ve quite often seriously commended the important work by David Koyzis called Political Visions & Illusions: A Survey & Christian Critique of Contemporary Ideologies that helps bring a fairly scholarly but exceptionally insightful and well-balanced understanding of the roots of Western culture and the ways old, old theories have shaped very contemporary parties and movements. We’re taking pre-orders on his next one, more obviously practical, which is due the end of November. It will be called Citizenship Without Illusions: A Christian Guide to Political Engagement published by IVP; $18.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $14.40.\n\nTo focus on this question of the history of conservatism in America, I can’t say enough about the hefty, erudite, and really interesting volume by respected conservative writer Matthew Continetti called The Right: The Hundred-Year War for American Conservatism (Basic Books; $19.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $15.99.) I know I’ve reviewed it already, but it would make an excellent back-story to the ones I’m listing this week.\n\nSo how, then, did it come to this, a violent rampage of “patriots” smashing our US Capitol and a guy in a shaman’s headdress “praying” on the Senate floor nearby rebel flags and “Hang Mike Pence” signs, all in a hopped-up effort to stop the peaceful transition of power? To a time when, after some initial hand-wringing, most Republican elected officials are hardly concerned, with a few even affirming the rioter’s character? (Still others clearly lying about what happened that fateful day, as if none of us folks haven’t seen the many TV shots from so many angles? And their colleagues put up with that?) How did we get here?\n\nWhere do conspiracy theories and alt-right citizenship and such weird forms of governance come from? Why is everybody so mad and why does it lead so many to truly bad behaviors? New York Times writer and all-around decent guy Frank Bruni gave us some insight in The Age of Grievance (Avid Reader Press; $28.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $23.19) which I raved about a few weeks ago. But there is more to this feverish era.\n\nI know, I know: at root, the problem is from the world, the flesh, and the devil, not to mention ideologies driven by idols. British Biblical scholar Christopher Wright is very helpful here, for starters: see his Here Are Your Gods: Faithful Discipleship in Idolatrous Times (IVP; $22.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $17.60.)\n\nAlso essential is the must-read N.T Wright & Michael Bird paperback, Jesus and the Powers: Christian Political Witness in an Age of Totalitarian Terror and Dysfunctional Democracies (Zondervan; $22.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $18.39. We’ve highlighted this before and it is readable, Biblical, and timely.)\n\n+++\n\nI’ve been fascinated reading about the past politics of my own lifetime, with a new urgency and with new scholarship explaining a whole lot about a whole lot. The last few weeks have been a stimulating walk down memory lane as I’ve revisited people and events and trends that I thought I was somewhat attentive to a few decades ago, but I now realize I misunderstood the seriousness and the significance.\n\nAs I’ve said, I’ve enjoyed these books of public affairs and political reporting. But even if one isn’t naturally a political junkie or history lover, I commend these books because they explain so much. We all, I believe, owe it to our times to understand some of this.\n\nAs I try to understand what nearly everyone admits has been a catalytic shift in the Republican Party, we must also explore how the Democratic Party evolved. That’s not my reading project now, but as we study the 1980s and the 1990s, we’re reminded that partisan ugliness on the Democrat side was terribly severe during the Bork hearings, for instance. There is no doubt it was repaid in kind during the Clarence Thomas hearings, although the Right under-minded the testimony of Anita Hill so viciously with such terrible attacks on her that the (then) right-wing journalist David Brock later apologized. From Watergate lies to the Ollie North lies to the Clinton lies to the Newt Gingrich lies there were scandals and there was polarization.\n\nBut man, even then, with Rush Limbaugh and a host of other shock-jock pundits colorfully raging on air and TV — many right-wing yappers like Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham, were then on MSNBC (while Glen Beck and Tucker Carlson were on CNN) and all were making a ton of money making hay with book sales (including wild stuff like Michelle Malkin’s book in favor of the WWII-era Japanese internment!)— and the political world was toxic. The right-wing media ecosphere had what one author called an “outrage machine” and they cranked out outlandish stuff daily. (Just think of the conspiracies about the Clinton’s murdering “more than a dozen” people. I guess it makes sense that those kind of people decades later can stomach alliances with the likes of Alex Jones who claimed 9-11 “was an inside job” and denied the horrific murder of children in Sandy Hook. ) Until reading these books I forgot how bad it was, how saddened many of us were, and I now realize how important it is to make these connections between the last decades of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st.\n\nYou know the old adage about understanding history so we don’t repeat it? For some of us, it’s hard to believe that the 1980s and 1990s are “history.” (Am I right, senior citizens?)\n\nGetting a workable handle on at least this part of the political landscape — what I would say is the most explosive part — is urgent. Whether you enjoy these sorts of studies or not, I think they are important and I share them now as an act of hope in these complicated days. Check one or two out from the library, if you can, or send us an order soon. All are 20% off.\n\nPartisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s Nicole Hemmer (Basic Books) $32.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $25.60\n\nThis is one I could hardly put down. I’ve noted bunches of paragraphs to cite if I were to do a long, serious review. Holy smokes, did I learn a lot. The author tilts left, I assume, but it is not a diatribe or hatchet job. Although she does name unbelievable shenanigans and nastiness on the right, noting how candidates like Pat Buchanan — with overt racist ties and fascist leanings — pushed the Republican Party to the right. Did you know that many on the conservative end of the political spectrum disapproved of Nixon and Reagan because they were too liberal? This isn’t new news for those who have followed the Birchers, the Goldwater campaign, the McCarthy hearings, and all that mid-20th century roiling of the political landscape. They did not go away, and got louder and more appealing to some when the right wing media-sphere took off. (This has to do, by the way, not only with advances in cable and satellite technology but with court rulings that opened up an anything goes ethos. The “equal time” law known as the Fairness doctrine was struck down — aside, the Christian radio station near us here in Red Lion, which I’ve been on, even, played a role in all of this back in 1969 as the Fairness Doctrine was at that time upheld and the local radio station lost their case, but I digress.)\n\nNicole Hemmer knows this stuff well and is astute and lively in describing various media personalities. (She has a scholarly book on an academic press just on the conservative media and their role.) One cannot say enough about, for instance, the influence of Bill Maher’s political comedy show, for instance, or, importantly, the mighty Rush Limbaugh in paving the way for even more callous and wicked talk radio, leading to conspiracy theories and the likes of Michael Savage and his ilk.\n\nAnd she understands the huge role of Pat Buchanan.\n\nAnyway, this book makes a powerful case that the Trumpian worldview, the nihilism and the profanity and the weird mix of conspiracy and meanness emerged in American civic space in the last two decades of the 20th century. If you were there, you’ve got to read this. You will laugh and maybe cry with recognition. If you had not come of age, yet, this is a much-needed handbook to this important historical era, not so long past, but in many ways seminal.\n\nMaybe this passionately affirming review is a bit on the nose, but listen to this:\n\nNicole Hemmer’s Partisans shines fresh, provocative light on America’s political history, showing that Ronald Reagan’s anointed successors were not public servants so much as performance artists growing rich and powerful by selling division and resentment. Partisans provides a whole new meaning to the Reagan Revolution by focusing on the charlatans of the 1990’s it spawned. — Jane Mayer, Chief Washington Correspondent, The New Yorker\n\nPerhaps the always-reliable and erudite E.J. Dionne says it best:\n\nNicole Hemmer is both shrewd and wise in her understanding of the history of American conservatism and the long-term influence of right-wing media. Partisans brilliantly explains why Reaganism gave way to Trumpism and calls much-needed attention to the importance of Pat Buchanan’s nationalist insurgency in the 1990s as a pivot point. An essential and engaging book that explains how we got here.– E. J. Dionne Jr., author of Why the Right Went Wrong\n\nWhen the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How American Cracked Up in the Early 1990s John Ganz (Farrar Straus Giroux) $30.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $24.00\n\nThis is one that I was at first going to rave about, wanting nearly everybody I know who reads this sort of stuff to pick up. I’m not so sure, as it is dense, serious, exceptionally well documented, and thorough.\n\nIt, like the lively Partisans, is well written and incredibly interesting. She makes no pretense of her view, and calling them “con men” in the subtitle says much. Her case about the nutty conspiracies and how we “cracked up” in the 1990s is not far from the truth, and if you have suspicions, I invite you to read this and see for yourself. Holy smokes, it is hot, hot stuff. And the New York Times called it “unflaggingly entertaining without losing its moral core.”\n\nAnother review wavered that it actually provides more insight about Trump’s ascent than most other studies that explore that directly. It introduces us to the term “voter rage.” The opening chapter is a detailed study — and, wow! — of KKK leader turned rabble rousing racist Republican David Duke called “Swamp Creature.” His chapter on Ruby Ridge and the militias is called “The Howling Wilderness” is powerful. The recent Republican trend of flirting with neo-Nazis is, actually, not as new as I had thought.\n\nWhen the Clock Broke covers much of the same ground as Partisans but is more vivid, in a way, and more focused. It is wild, read, as history professor at Yale, Beverly Gage puts it, “ finding absurdity and humor in our national pageant.”\n\nThe title comes from an extraordinary speech given by Murray Rothbard. It was nothing short of revolutionary and is in a complex chapter about the old right and the rising new right. The same chapter introduces a far-right scholar/operative who shows up in all these studies, Sam Francis. You should know him.\n\nFrancis wrote that,\n\nReagan conservatism, in its innermost meaning, had little to do with supply-side economics and spreading democracy. It had to do with the awakening of a people who face political, cultural, and economic dispossession, who are slowly beginning to glimpse the face of dispossession and what it will mean for them and their descendants, and who are also starting to think about reversing the processes and powers responsible for it.\n\nThis approach was like radically revolutionary Marxist liberation theology but of the far right, an intellectual analysis of power and revolt and it seems to me one can draw a straight line between the likes of Rothbard and Francis and the smashing of the clocks to the smashing of the windows of the Capitol on January 6th.\n\nGanz is a very important writer and he is helping me connect a lot of awful dots. From the shock jocks to the bizarre conspiracies to the disgusting holocaust deniers, it starts to make sense. As Damon Linker puts it, there are “threads tying that time to our own.” When the Clock Broke is a book you should know.\n\nBirchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right Matthew Dallek (Basic Books) $32.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $25.60\n\nI read this maybe a year ago and thought I wrote about it then (but maybe I did not) so I’d be remiss not to mention it here, now. Their history is fascinating and their relationship to the more mainstream right and the Republican party is fascinating, and, again, important to help us understand the geology of the Trump movement and the much-discussed MAGA outrage. Matthew Dallek did a great job following so many rabbit trails to keep this big book coherent and even entertaining — he waded through thousands of archival documents. I highly recommend it.\n\nHere is how the publisher explains it:\n\nFounded in 1958 by a small band of anti-New Deal businessmen, the John Birch Society held that a vast communist conspiracy existed within America and posed an existential threat to the country. Birchers railed against the federal government, defended segregation, and accused liberal elites of conspiring to destroy the country’s core values-Christianity, capitalism, and individual freedom. Shunned by the political establishment and mainstream media, the organization invented new methods for reaching mass audiences and spread their paranoid anti-government ideology nationwide. Although seen as a fringe movement throughout the 1960s and considered all but dead by the mid-1970s, the John Birch Society in fact birthed an alliance uniting super-rich business titans with grassroots activists that lasts to this day. In Birchers, historian Matthew Dallek uncovers how the Birchers, once the far-right fringe of American politics, forged a conspiratorial, media-savvy style of conservatism that would ultimately take over the Republican Party.\n\nThis 2023 release has gotten rave reviews from the conservative National Review and the lefty Nation. The New York Times says it is written with “clarifying elegance and restraint” and both the Library Journal and Kirkus gave it their coveted starred reviews. True enough, one reviewer said it is “a treasure trove for political history buffs” but, again, the point is that there is a real connection between the fringe and often hateful John Birch outfit and the rise of Trumpism which has taken over the Republican Party. As such, it is essential.\n\nAmerica Last: The Right’s Century-Long Romance with Foreign Dictators Jacob Heilbrunn (Liveright) $28.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $23.19\n\n“Why do Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, and much of the far Right so explicitly admire the murderous and incompetent Russian dictator Vladimir Putin?” In a way, this is the question America Last sets out to answer. He provides a long and disturbing answer.\n\nI’m not quite finished with this yet but I highly recommend it thus far; it is important, I think. It is a careful, thorough (and at times quite elegant) study of the ways in which some Americans proposed — in part through the old organization America First — an isolationism and disregard for wars in other parts of the world and what was behind some of those movements (especially prior to WW I and WW II.) If you like 20th century history, this is amazing.\n\nThe right is a respected conservative journalist. More on that in a moment.\n\nThose who are Biblical pacifists surely are not of the same ilk as, say, Charles Limbaugh and others who advocated that the US stay out of World War I because they were, in fact, fond of the brutal Prussian militarist Kaiser Wilhelm. (Who knew?) Those who for understandable reasons want an alternative to war surely are not the same as those America Firsters who, like H. L. Mencken, were clearly in favor of Germany’s war efforts. The terrible stuff Mencken said and did — I had no idea. I knew he had a fierce wit and hated the fundamentalism of William Jennings Bryan and the Scopes trial, but — whew — who knew how some public figures were so vicious and antisemetic. America Last explains it all in informed prose with scholarly detail, including a moving chapter called “Mussolini’s Vicars.” Wow.\n\nThe book starts with an almost tedious description of the author’s conservative credentials and the front row seat to many contemporary conservative debates — it’s a bit complicated but lets say Mr. Heilbronn served under a guy who was a foreign policy advisor to Richard Nixon, that he has connections with many foreign policy wonks (not to mention diplomats and even some foreign autocrats), and has worked at a conservative think-tank and journal owned by deeply conservative thinkers. One was convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of justice but was then fully pardoned by Trump, which shows you who he hangs with. He is an editor at Irving Kristol’s The National Interest and helped Francis Fukuyama publish the famous essay “The End of History” after the Berlin Wall fell. He can tell you exactly what Jared Trump was wearing during a meeting with Henry Kissinger in the boardroom of the Time Warner Center in New York. Just so you know.\n\nIn his work with dignitaries and diplomats Heilbrunn came increasingly to realize that many on the right side of the political spectrum these days are, in fact, more supportive of brutes like Victor Orban of Hungary than makes sense. Yet another Hungarian activist — Balazs Orban — has worked frequently with Republican Party leaders (while his boss, the more notoriously famous Victor Orban, speaks at CPAC to rave reviews.) What gives? That the Heritage Foundation and other such conservative think-tanks who intellectually fund the policies of the current Republican regime look to a Hungarian parliamentarian as a guide to navigating our culture wars is stunning. When you think of it, that this small country (“dependent on economic subsidies from Brussels”) emerged as a model for the proud American Right, is almost bizarre.\n\nAnd now, Republicans cozy up to Putin. Trump notoriously so. How can this be?\n\nAmerican Last offers impeccable scholarship, slow, detailed, exposé about this or that figure, this or that “monster abroad”, and this or that Republican who favored support for dictators and corrupt regimes. The current conservative bromance with Putin is actually not unprecedented. It fits a past pattern.\n\nWhat was behind conservatives’ support for Kaiser Wilhelm? For South African apartheid? What convinced nearly everybody in the conservative movement to adopt Jonas Savimbi as “the Right’s favorite warlord”? Marcos? Heilbronn takes you inside banquets at the Washington Hilton (for instance) and listens in on discussions with Jean Kilpatrick. You recall, I hope, that when she was Reagan’s U.N Ambassador she gave a pass to the El Salvadoran soldiers who raped and killed four American missionary nuns, “because they were political activists.” She even went to bat for the vile Argentine junta (headed, then, by a General Leopoldo Galtieri) against global human rights agencies who condemned Argentina’s “Dirty War” against their own civilians. There’s a whole chapter on her.\n\nThis book written by a respected conservative thinker takes great care to explain more than most of us need to know, but it is exceptional in its candor and critique of the ways in which American conservatives have, historically, too often bedded down with corrupt regimes and authoritarians abroad.\n\nAmerica Last is a tour-de-force of historical investigation written with the verve of a first-rate political thriller.” — Sam Tanehaus, The Death of Conservatism\n\nKingdom of Rage: The Rise of Christian Extremism and the Path Back to Peace Elizabeth Neumann (Worthy) $28.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $22.40\n\nI am so very, very glad for this book and am eager to hopefully sell a few. After these rip-roaring and/or carefully researched histories of weird politics and great injustices — from holocaust deniers getting a pass from so-called conservatives and blatant racism driving uprisings and violence — it is nice to see a woman who is not only an expert in domestic terrorism but a faithful follower of Christ and active evangelical church person. None of us most likely have heard of Elizabeth Neumann but now she is one of my heros. Her book has a nice blurb on the very front insisting that she “has done a service to the county — and to the church” from none other than Tim Alberta, author of the hugely popular and widely discussed The Kingdom, The Power and the Glory. He is glad that she exposes the sickness of militant Christian nationalism and “prescribing Jesus himself as the cure.” He is right: that is exactly what she does.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\nThe book almost seems like two books in one, with nearly different tones or themes from chapter to chapter. This is not at all a bad thing, and I found the pacing to be lovely. Here is what I mean.\n\nNeumann worked as a government servant — one of those “deep state” people you hear Trump complaining about all the time — who gave her life to civil service by working for Homeland Security. She was in DC when the plane hit the Pentagon near her workplace and she tells exactly how scary it all was (citizens and government workers fled on foot rather than risking getting stuck in the subways, their typical routes home.) Most of us reading this will feel your heart beat faster, I bet, even thinking about that horrible day, now etched in our mind as 9/11. Can you imagine being a Homeland Security expert the weeks following that horrific, global event?\n\nI won’t explain all the fascinating details but here’s the upshot: she, and most of her counter-terrorism experts, who honed their craft (sometimes in injustice and inappropriate ways, I might add) against radical Islamist jihadist — and there were a lot, she says, a lot of gross violence that they thwarted — now realize that the threat from outsiders is not very high. Some combination of there being less extremist attackers, now, and better intel and security measures have worked out well, mostly. However, she says, there are more domestic terrorism attacks than ever before. I do not think she means mass shootings where a mentally disturbed shooter massacres many. She’s talking about ideologically driven, often in cells and organizations, plotting mayhem and worse. We can thank God that there hasn’t been anything like the Oklahoma City Bombing in many years but this sort of stuff — domestic terrorism — is what keeps the Department of Homeland Security up at night.\n\nNeumann uses professional lingo as describes (in very accessible prose) the ways experts determine how people get radicalized. They have documented the processes and can sometimes see it coming. Many of us have had episodes where people go off the deep end, joining a cult or a movement or a radical organization. At some point, they become dangerous. Since we have lots of freedom of speech and assembly and movement, law enforcement must be careful to follow the law and not add to the problem with violation of civil liberties, of course. But she does tell about how all this works. It is fascinating and troubling, and I’m glad level-headed people with Godly character like Ms Neumann are involved.\n\nSo, in Kingdom of Rage she explains how radicalization occurs and what, as a counter-terrorist expert, she thinks we can do. This is the strongest part of the book, in my view, although the more explicitly religious testimony — her journey, her values, her witness to the gospel as the only final and acting answer— is solid. She’s a thoughtful person of faith and drops great quotes and citations from theologians and thinkers I respect. And she is right that many of the extremists on the militant Right that she fears the most do have some connections with religion. Some are nearly cult-like in their connections to radical leaders while others may be less devout. In any case, she brings a truly Christian faith perspective to bear that is wholesome and hopeful.\n\nBut then she returns to the hard and somewhat dark work she has been called to do, and explores further what she knows and how the “kingdom of rage” works. She is convinced that white Christian nationalism is extremist and can be dangerous. But she is equally convinced that there is a way off the ledge, a way back to peace. As Russell Moore notes of it, “this book helps us find a better way.” Indeed.\n\nThis breathtakingly honest book explains the sources of radicalization in our country and offers solutions that apply to all of us. Masterful, moving, and wise. — Jessica Stern, Senior Fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, author of Terror in the Name of God\n\nPreparing for War: The Extremist History of White Christian Nationalism — and What Comes Next Bradley Onishi (Broadleaf) $28.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $23.19\n\nI’ve just started Preparing for War which I have only skimmed. I am embarrassed to admit I haven’t read this yet. Our friends at Broadleaf Books have done a great service doing a number of books about public justice, exposing the abuse of the gospel by those who link it too closely to the alt-right. Bradley Onishi is an important scholar and this is one of many books explaining the rise of not only the Moral Majority and the flakey Pat Robertson book predicting a “new world order” (etc. etc.) but linking the extremist vision of the MAGA movement and those who are now linking arms to protect the insurrectionist back to the John Birch Society and the like. It seems like he is really on to something, offering this vital history. Katherine Stewart, who wrote the important The Power Worshippers says it is “gripping and essential reading.”\n\nAnd one of the reasons it is so gripping is because Bradley Onishi was a part of all this years ago. These were his people, and while he is now a scholar of religion, he has an insider’s view on “the long road to J6.”\n\nAs one reviewer put it, Onishi is “ringing alarm bells.” The new religious right is only growing in its aggressive ways with bigger ambitions than we may know. This religiously sanctioned extremism has to be understood.\n\nI appreciate the sentiment of the very first paragraph of the Prologue:\n\nProcessing the Capitol insurrection is akin to coming to terms with a national home invasion. That violent mob’s breach of a secure and sacred space on January 6, 2021, resulted in nothing less than a collective trauma. Decades of threats, calls for civil war, and White grievance politics burst forth into a vulgar display of vengeance. It was a day that divides time into Before and After. It was a dismantling.\n\nThere are many books decrying the bad theology of the far, racist right. There are many who warn us that this hybrid of Christianity with their teutonic worldview and exceptional nationalism is not only bad for the witness of the church but bad for our country. This is one that gives us the big backstory, a first hand account by a contemporary scholar and I think it is going to continue in the project of connecting the dots, understanding the times, and helping us discern what God’s people should do.\n\nThe Destructionists: The Twenty-Five Year Crack-Up of the Republican PartyDana Milbank (Doubleday) $19.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $15.20\n\nI’m glad this whopper of a book is out in paperback and I’m glad to tell you it is on my “up next” stack for books I’m reading trying to figure out how we got to where we are in these United States. Some of the titles I’ve read go back a hundred years; others to the 80s and 90s. This one starts, more or less, with Newt Gingrich and his “Contract with America.” Milbank draws a circuitous but eventual line from his rabble-rousing project in1994 to the rebels throwing punches in the U.S. Capitol with their Jesusy flags and Confederate gear. Wow.\n\nBelieve me, I’ve saved this one to read until now because I know how energetic and at times hilarious Milbank can be. He’s won any number of writing awards and I often appreciate his columns in the Washington Post. He’s been at his post for decades now, and this is his “sizzling hot” observation of the contemporary scene.\n\nJonathan Karl says, “His writing is irreverent, provocative, and, whether or not you agree with his point of view, always entertaining.”\n\nTo be clear, as Charles Sykes puts it, “Milbank argues that Donald Trump, for all his faults, didn’t create this noxious environment — he was the monster that the GOP had been creating for more than a quarter century.”\n\nMilbank walks “a fine and elegant line between humor and horror” (as Mark Leibovich put it — yep, the Leibovich who wrote the breathtaking Thank You for Your Servitude about all the people Trump fired and all the lackeys that put up with his reign of nonsense.) He continues, riffing on the question “How did we get here?” and says:\n\nIt’s all right here in The Destructionists, in all its depressing, spiraling detail — and yet so thoroughly enjoyable, too. That’s the Milbank Miracle, right there. I devoured this.\n\nYes, it will be a good read. But this is serious stuff. These radicals have been breeding cynicism and distrust in government — indeed in civic institutions of all sorts (which, ironically, was the charge against the Left so many years ago, back before the hippies became yuppies) — which has led to violence against government, so we need to, in Biblical fashion, discern the writing on the wall. Dana is no Daniel, but he’s got something to show us all. From the dark money to the endemic lying to the support of dictators abroad and pushing back civil rights here, there has been a downward, downward spiral. As Jennifer Rubin promises us, “if you want to understand Trump, this account is essential reading.”\n\nWe will see. It’s on my list.\n\nSedition Hunters: How January 6th Broke the Justice SystemRyan J. Reilly (Public Affairs) $32.50 / OUR SALE PRICE = $26.00\n\nThe above titles are each really interesting for political junkies and history buffs. And they are important to help us understand our cultural moment, or at least this one slice of it. I want to underscore where these past decades of the previous century have lead, so I’ll end with this amazing new volume. It is brand new and up to the minute, almost. I have to tell you about this one.\n\nIf the topic were not so chilling and so utterly important for our nation, this almost could be a rip-roaring, edge-of-your-seat, summer action blockbuster. I went from being thrilled with the undercover plots, the hunts, the intelligence gathering, the spy stuff, the procedural work. If you like true crime stuff or police shows or espionage, even, this could be for you. It even has, as one reviewer put it, “big screen imagery” while another noted that it is “fast-paced.” Yep.\n\nBut here’s the thing: most of the work was done by ordinary citizens (of all stripes and kinds) mostly working online. Moms between mealtimes, truckers at their rest stops, blue collar and white collar, progressives and conservatives, each wanting to study those damn tapes, the videos, the evidence. One guy (I forget, was beating up a cop or smashing a door with a bat or something horrible in the name of Trumpian patriotism) was careful, as many were, to cover up their faces. In one quick scene caught on a video aired on Facebook, he used his phone; his homepage showed his business and one citizen with an eagle eye figured it out and called it in. That violent rebel is now in jail.\n\nThe amount of evidence of crimes, sometimes deadly ones, was — is! — mountainous. Many of these volunteer sleuths have formed online circles and networks although many have never met, even as they use this open-source style of helping solve these crimes. It’s almost a little sub-plot, about the lives of these civic volunteers, the “sedition hunters” of the book’s title.\n\nBut the author doesn’t just document the heroic and often complicated work of these fellow citizens. It tells some of their backstories and some of the backstories of those involved in the uprising. Like any protest, some folks attended but committed no crime (but where there, it seems to me, to cheer on those intending to prevent the ratification of the election by the elected officials sworn to do so. I’ve been to protests where bad stuff happened, but it wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t the main thing, as this clearly, clearly was.) The whole awful January 6th was complex and rowdy and although this is not mostly a story about that day — read Jamie Raskin’s riveting Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth, and the Trials of American Democracy for that — it does move forward from that historic uprising/riot and moves outward towards investigation and prosecution. One long-standing NBC reporter said the book is “thrilling, fascinating, and brilliant.”\n\nAnd then the subtitle kicks in, as we learn just how many people had networks of others egging them on, and many people were involved. (Everybody in law enforcement expected trouble that day and even a relative of mine saw online declarations of people planning to bring guns and gear along with their Trumpian anger.) The Justice Department became quickly overwhelmed and those Republican leaders who for a brief minute seemed sobered by the attack, soon weaponized their accusations against investigation and prosecution. As an American citizen I am appalled that any elected official would now minimize that bloody day and its assault on our Republic and Constitution.\n\nThis is one heckuva story, one heckuva read. As one reviewer put it, Ryan Reilly “has delivered in real time the untold tale of the network of patriots, outside and inside government, who are bringing January 6 rioters to justice.”\n\n+++\n\nTO PLACE AN ORDER\n\nPLEASE READ, THEN SCROLL DOWN TO CLICK ON THE “ORDER” LINK BELOW.\n\nIt is helpful if you tell us how you want us to ship your orders.

If necessary, we can do overnight and other expedited methods, too. Just ask.\n\nUnited States Postal Service has the option called “Media Mail” which is cheapest but can be a little slower. For one typical book, usually, it’s $4.33; 2 lbs would be $5.07. This is the cheapest method available and seems not to be too delayed.\n\nUnited States Postal Service has another, quicker option called “Priority Mail” which is $8.70, if it fits in a flat-rate envelope. Many children’s books and some Bibles are oversized so that might take the next size up which is $9.50. “Priority Mail” gets much more attention than does “Media Mail” and is often just a few days to anywhere in the US.\n\nUPS Ground is reliable but varies by weight and distance and may take longer than USPS.

There are a number of reasons, I suppose, ranging from a slight embarrassment in doing so — tooting your own horn seems a bit unseemly — to a fear that, well, I have highlighted it every other year or so, and I don’t want to bore or annoy our faithful readers.\n\nYet, some of our recent subscribers may not know of this little gem, a book I am quite proud of. More importantly, niche as it may be, there is really nothing like it on the market and it could be very helpful for the right person — a young adult or recent college grad, especially. So, here I go, a little rumination on why you should order Serious Dreams: Big Ideas for the Rest of Your Life for college grads or young adults (or, if I may — ahem — for yourself, no matter your age or stage in life). It was nicely designed by Ned Bustard and published quietly by Square Halo Books in 2015. It goes for $13.99 but our BookNotes SALE PRICE = $11.19.\n\nI’ll even autograph it, which sounds a bit weird to say, even now, having signed dozens and dozens over the years. Just let us know if you want that and, if so, to whom (if anyone) we should make it out.\n\nLet me tell you the back story.\n\nNearly a lifetime ago Beth and I were newly married and working out of a Presbyterian Church near Pittsburgh, sent there by the CCO (the Coalition for Christian Outreach), an ecumenical, evangelical, campus ministry that helps college students understand and live the gospel of God’s Kingdom. Although it wasn’t the only influence in those early CCO days in the 1970s, we did learn then about that great Dutch statesman, public theologian, and writer, Abraham Kuyper, who is known particularly for his advocacy of a world-and-life-vision that relates seamlessly knowing and doing, thinking Christianly and living vibrantly, in but not of the modern world. When Kuyper founded in 1880 a major Christian university in Amsterdam — before his famous trip to American where he lectured at Princeton — he preached that often-cited line about the resurrected Christ who, as Kuyper put it,\n\nThere is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, ‘Mine!’”\n\nThe Biblical basis for that vivid claim can be seen in texts such as Psalm 24:1 and Colossians 1: 15-20. In Kuyper’s speech, the broader context of that line was about rejecting a compartmentalization of faith, as if the arts and sciences are somehow disconnected from a privatized faith. Oh, no: Kuyper deeply valued pluralism but also insisted on the Kingship of Christ expressed in all of society. A cultural renaissance man as the 19th century turned to the 20th, he understood (long before the postmoderns) that all of life is inherently biased, committed, situated; nothing is neutral. (Ya gotta serve somebody Bob Dylan growled in my own generation.) From technology to economics to art to education, human culture-making is shaped by deeper idols or ideologies, so followers of the way of Jesus have to be discerning and winsome and creative about everything. As we used to say in the CCO, we believe in “all of life redeemed.” .\n\nThe great Dorothy Sayers said something to the effect about religion that is relegated to one part of one day a week is ultimately boring. Who wants a religion so puny? She’s right, and our years working with the hungry hearts of youth taught us that a big picture faith is not only more faithful to the full epic Biblical drama of redemption, but it is, frankly, more appealing.\n\n(As an aside: for a great modern-day exploration of the implications of Kuyper’s broad teaching about faith lived out in every sphere of life, see the excellent Calvinism for a Secular Age: A Twenty-First-Century Reading of Abraham Kuyper’s Stone Lectures edited by Jessica and Rob Joustra.) Richard Mouw wrote the most accessible and inspiring little introduction to Kuyper in his Abraham Kuyper: A Short and Personal Introduction. Dr. Mouw also nicely told my story about CCO folks learning about all this, including notions of common grace and the vocation of doing uniquely Christian scholarship, in a few pages of his lovely, provocative book All That God Cares About: Common Grace and Divine Delight. The Dorothy Sayers quote animates much of the great book by Paul Marshall, Heaven Is Not My Home: Living in the Now of God’s Creation.)\n\nInspired by this sort of Dutch neo-Calvinism about the Lordship of Christ over all aspects of creation, alongside the slightly counter-cultural approach of our Jesus movement forebears, the CCO set out not only to invite students to a gospel-centered faith but to nurture and equip disciples of Christ who might be salt and light in the universities where they found themselves.\n\nWe wanted to help students to show forth the implications of the Christian mind, discover fresh new ways of advocating for Christian scholarship, and to stand for Biblical principles of public justice (fighting poverty was a major concern for Kuyper) and racial reconciliation. We brought to our campuses rising Christian leaders such as John Perkins and Os Guiness and Becky Pippert and Tom Skinner and Tony Campolo and R.C. Sproul. Eventually we brought in and learned from big thinkers like John Stott and Ron Sider and Bob Goudzwaard, spiritual leaders like Ruth Haley Barton, Bible scholars like Kenneth Bailey, pastors like Timothy Keller, philosophers like Jamie Smith, activists like Lisa Sharon Harper, who all influenced our staff of mostly young college ministers.\n\nNaturally, if we wanted to honor the Lordship of Christ and create signposts pointing the way of His Kingdom coming, and we wanted students to sense a calling to their academic work (not to mention leading Bible studies in their dorms and going on mission trips, and all the rest of fairly standard faith formation) we had to show not only that academic discipleship matters — loving God with all your mind — but that the college years were times to discern one’s vocation, to hear God’s call, to figure out what it might look like to serve God in the professions and careers for which they were studying. In other words, we had to teach them that work matters to God, and not merely as a way to pay the proverbial bills. God actually cares about your job.\n\nRemember that great line by Martin Luther King, Jr?\n\n“If a man is called to be a street sweeper. He should sweep streets even as a Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all hosts of heaven and earth pause to say; Here lives a great sweeper who did his job well.”\n\nMost campus ministry organizations (and, frankly, most churches, even today) don’t say that nearly enough.\n\nA Lutheran businessman, a steel executive named William Diehl, gave a talk at an early CCO conference called “Thank God It’s Monday” which eventually became a book by that title. Books like Os Guiness’s The Call: Finding and Fulfilling God’s Purpose for Your Life and Tim Keller’s Every Good Endeavor: Connecting Your Work to God’s Work or Joanna Meyer’s Women, Work, and Calling had not been written yet, but we pioneered on, creating the now famous Jubilee Conference (still held every February and our biggest bookselling event each year.) Inviting students to a robust theology of work and inviting them to think Christianly about what they are learning as they prepare for vocations in the world became important for CCO’s vision of “whole life discipleship.” I’m not sure they always think about the implications of it all, but they still have as a slogan reminding them that they do their ministry in order to “transform college students to transform the world.”\n\nJust for fun, here is a main-stage Jubilee talk by cultural thinker Andy Crouch, (where he plays some Bach), here is another by the fabulous Biblical scholar Carmen Imes, unpacking Genesis 1 and 2, and here is one — you’ve got to watch this — from Sunday morning’s challenge just last year by New York pastor Abe Cho. And here is an audio of me going on for nearly an hour at a workshop about the Christian mind and reading widely as a Kingdom practice designed for Jubilee students. These are all well worth taking in and will inform and inspire you but will also give yoiu a bit more background about some of our influences at Hearts & Minds and some of what we are about.\n\nIt was, by the way, out of this vision that our good friend Derek Melleby wrote a number of years ago a small book for young college students called Make College Count: A Faithful Guide to Life and Learning (Baker Books; $13.00; OUR SALE PRICE = $10.40.) It is, to this day, the best little book inviting those heading off to college to make choices that are fruitful and wise, including thinking well about vocation and calling. There is nothing like it, and we highly recommend it.\n\nAnd, then, also out of this hope within CCO to mentor students into taking their course work seriously and find God in their labs, classrooms, and lecture halls, Derek joined up with another eloquent former CCO staffer (and now college chaplain), Don Optiz, to write the hilarious, breathtakingly good, upbeat volume Learning for the Love of God: A Student’s Guide to Academic Faithfulness (Brazos Press; $19.00; OUR SALE PRICE = $15.20.)\n\nThat book was dedicated to me — what an honor! — and, again, illustrates how our involvement with the CCO shaped the vision we have of our small town, mail-order bookstore. I am sure that this little book by my two good pals, Derek & Don, is the best introduction to all this talk about a missional, relevant, thoughtful, sort of discipleship on campus. Anybody that is a life-long learner and wants a quick, fun, read on thinking might well appreciate it. We all could use some “academic faithfulness.”\n\n(Another interesting aside, if you please: many know and many more have heard that Steve Garber’s book, Fabric of Faithfulness: Weaving Together Belief and Behavior initially had, in its first edition, the same subtitle of weaving together belief and behavior, but with the additional phrase “in the college years.” You see, he did the research for the extraordinarily thoughtful and influential book about higher education (and what contributes to lasting, transformative learning) in the years immediately following his stint with the CCO in Pittsburgh. He was active, also, as leader of the Jubilee conference for a bit, and even though Beth and I had long left CCO staff to start our bookstore in Dallastown, it was through those circles that he interviewed me for my little episode in the book, talking about a Dutch philosopher (Peter J. Steen) who was important to me, and to Steve. Steve’s research for that book was taken seriously by a host of church-related colleges and they used his principles to attempt to make their learning communities more meaningful and faithful in what Sharon Parks calls “the critical years.” Yep, in that rather tangential way, Fabric of Faithfulness is part of the backstory of Serious Dreams as well.)\n\nIt was out of this visionary and educational mission to be something other than purveyors of a personalistic piety (or, on the other hand, a socially-engaged activism unmoored from the Bible or orthodox theology or the local church) that Beth and I came to sense a calling to open a bookstore, shaped by these years of talking about these very things, relating faith to all of life. Unlike many so-called Christian bookstores in those years we wanted to be a bit more thoughtful and carry less silly stuff and, importantly, to be ecumenical. We wanted to show that what Richard Foster came to call the “streams of living water” across the broad Body of Christ each had something vital to contribute to a relevant and timely sort of Kingdom lifestyle.\n\nAnd, also uniquely, it seemed, we wanted to offer books about all of life being redeemed — creation regained — developing a prophetic imagination that would offer critique to the idols of the time and real hope for fresh ideas for the reformation of all of life and culture. That is, we had books about science and art, nursing and education, business and architecture, law and psychology, home-making and church life, too. We have sections of books on urban design and neurology and gender studies and history and agriculture. From parenting to politics, we think we need to find better ways to promote a Biblically-informed worldview and offer fresh hope for a culture in disarray.\n\n(I don’t have to reiterate here what I’ve written about recently — that books are tools for serious discipleship and that reading is, in fact, a much-needed spiritual discipline in this modern, secularizing world. To understand and care about and engage with the spirits of the times, we’ve got to read widely. HERE I shared a list of a great handful of books about books. Hooray.)\n\nAll of this led me a few decades ago — besides running the shop, ordering books on all manner of things from all manner of perspectives, hoping customers will enjoy our call to read widely — to take up an advanced degree in the philosophy of higher education. I was helping with CCO by doing some of their staff training in those years and we have been their bookseller for decades. I figured I should revisit some of our interests in institutions of higher learning. The first and at that time the only place that offered a distinctively Christian approach to the study of higher ed as a graduate discipline was the Masters of Arts of Higher Education degree program of Geneva College, in Beaver Falls, PA. I got a chance to study with others and reaffirmed our calling to offer books to all, but with an interest in campus ministry and college life, too. That has never panned out that much, to be honest — most of our customers are adults in ordinary churches, I’d guess, not rising Christian scholars or leaders in campus ministry, let alone faculty which makes us quite happy — but it is part of who we are here at Hearts & Minds. And we are grateful for those situated in colleges that send business our way. You know who you are and we are thankful.\n\nWhich brings me to the occasion, nearly a decade ago, of being asked to give a commencement address during the graduation ceremonies of the various Master’s programs at Geneva College. They even gave me an honorary doctorate which I rarely mention, but, well, it was pretty special. When you write, you don’t have to call me Dr. Borger, but you could…. Ha.\n\nI preached, as I sometimes do, about raising up “Sons and Daughters of Issachar” — those who, according to I Chronicles 12:32 “understood the times and knew what God’s people should do.” I was as rousing as I could be in that setting and a number of folks asked afterwards if I could send them copies of my talk. There was even some talk about publishing it as a booklet or something. Oh my.\n\nWhich got me to thinking.\n\nThere really was no exact book to give as a gift to typical churched college graduates that invited them to take their faith into the marketplaces of their future jobs, to continue being life-long learners for the sake of the common good. There was nothing rather brief for college grads that was both inspiring and substantive, easy and exciting to read but relevant for a young adult wondering what comes next in their post-college years.\n\nBeth and I started reading other college commencement addresses that were delivered to Christian graduates. Naturally, these were mostly from Christian colleges, and, wow, some of them were really good. I found more than enough examples of tremendous talks, graduation speeches, and invitations for young adults to serve God as they move out into the world of work, inspired by things which they learned in their college years. Bingo.\n\nI was delighted that some very famous authors and important Christian scholars (and a lesser known person or two) gave me permission to reprint their commencement addresses. We added some discussion questions, some clever graphics — acorns, oak leaves, growing into the big trees you see on the back cover — and gave it the title Serious Dreams: Big Ideas for the Rest of Your Life. Compiled, curated, and edited by (Dr.) Byron K. Borger of Dallastown, PA.\n\nThe collection of talks make for good reading for anybody, I’d say. They are inspirational and touching and motivational, but, as the best sort of presentations are, they are well-written and full of important ideas, big truths, helpful guidance, exceptional insight. Some are a bit more visionary while some are a tad more practical. Each are set in their own context but I promise that is not odd or off-putting. We edited them in such as way as to retain the uniqueness of each address but made sure each was useful for ordinary readers who know nothing of that particular college or university where it was first delivered. Serious Dreams is not designed only for those who attended a church-related or Christian college but for any young adult searching for meaning and purpose, hoping to live faithfully in these days. These are exciting to read and I am nearly overwhelmed to find my own message alongside those of important writers like Nicholas Wolterstorff and John Perkins and Amy Sherman and Richard Mouw.\n\nI rarely say this sort of thing but as we curated and edited these I felt directed by God to write a different sort of introduction, sharing a different tone in what became the longest chapter in the book. Unlike the rather breathy and celebratory pieces from the various guest authors, I felt led to write a framing chapter that, while still upbeat, was a bit more sober. Some college grads do not get their dream job. Some move home into their parent’s basement. Some have a high degree of anxiety (including over all this talk of a high calling, implying a great clarity about God’s role in shaping our hopes and dreams and visions of vocations.) Let’s face it: few get to “change the world.” There may be some disorientation when a young person moves to a new town or takes up a new job in their summer after graduation. They need to find a new church. They need friends and they need to set up good habits. They might have financial hardships; they may experience loneliness, a let-down after the enthusiasm of their college years. So I wrote that first introductory chapter as a way to assure readers that they are loved and that despite the “big ideas” to which they are called in the exciting chapters to come, it’s okay to settle down, start small, stay put, breath. It’s going to be okay.\n\nHere are the chapters and authors of Serious Dreams:\n\nLive Well, Be True, Do Good: an Introduction by Byron Borge"
