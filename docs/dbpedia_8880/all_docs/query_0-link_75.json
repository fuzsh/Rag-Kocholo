Teaching there gave me a firsthand experience in the problems of recovering and revitalizing national values, after what surely ranks as one of the most intensive and violent colonial experiences of modern times. As I began my graduate study, it became clear to me that the Muslim courts were crucial to understanding the impact of the colonial ex­ perience on Algerian cultural values. And as I pursued my research, it became clear that the impact was a complex one. Along the way, quite a few people have helped me to understand the complexities. My adviser at the University of Michigan, Profes­ sor Richard Mitchell, was a constant source of encouragement, and a source of sensitive insights on the dilemmas of Islam in the modern world. His death, in September 1983, brought great sadness to me, as a student and a friend. In Paris, Professor Charles-Robert Ageron offered me warm hospitality, and shared his unflagging enthusiasm for historical research. In Algiers, Professor Bilqasim Sa'adallah helped me to understand questions from an Algerian perspective, and stim­ ulated my interest in intellectual history. I also owe a good deal to conversations with Mahfoud Smati, now of the Centre de Recherche sur l'Archeologie, la Prehistoire et l'Ethnologie in Algiers; Mustafa Haddad of the University of Constantine; Jean-Claude Vatin of the C.R.E.S.M. in Aix-en-Provence, France, and, presently or formerly associated with the Center for Near East and North African Studies of the University of Michigan; William Schorger; Clement Henry; Amal Rassam; Wil Rollman; Susan Miller; and Emily Byrd. Also at Michigan, Professors Charles Tilly and Raymond Grew contributed to my formation as a social historian. I am indebted to the directors and staffs of the following archives and libraries for their help: the Archives d'Outre-Mer and the C.R.E.S.M. in Aix-en-Provence; the Bibliotheque Nationale, the Bibliotheque de Γ Arsenal, the Archives Nationales, and the Archives of the Ministries of War and Foreign Affairs in Paris; the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Archives Nationales in Algiers; the Ar-\n\nviii I PREFACE\n\nchives de la Wilaya in Constantine; the Archives Nationales and the Bibliotheque Nationale in Tunis. The original research for this study was carried out in 1975-1976, with the aid of a fellowship and travel grant from the Center for Near East and North African Studies of the University of Michigan. The results appeared in a dissertation which I defended in October 1977. Since then, I have done additional research in the archives at Aix-en-Provence, and in the quite extraordinary collection of works on North Africa in the library of Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria. This book contains very substantial revisions, and an additional chap­ ter. Portions of Chapter 2 appeared as \"Saintly Descent and Worldly Affairs in Mid-Nineteenth Century Mascara, Algeria,\" in Interna­ tional Journal of Middle East Studies, 12 (1980), pp. 139-155; a large portion of Chapter 5 appeared as \"An Inquiry into the Origins of the Algerian Medjlis Crisis of 1858,\" in Revue d'historie maghribine, 6 (1979), pp. 35-51; and Section 2 of Chapter 7 appeared as \"Career Patterns of Late Nineteenth Century Algerian Muslim Magistrates,\" in The Maghreb Review, 6 (1981), pp. 36-39. I would like to thank the editors of these journals for permission to republish this material. I would also like to thank Jeanne Dunn for preparing the map. Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the students with whom I have worked, in both Algeria and Nigeria. I learned from them that understanding Muslim society requires that one understand distinct individuals within the society, not making them heroes, but granting them the dignity of historical responsibility. 2 January 1984\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPreface\n\nvii\n\nList of Tables\n\nxiii\n\nNote on the Transcription of Arabic\n\nxv\n\nNote on Abbreviations\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction Law and European Colonialism Islamic Law in the Colonial Setting Historical and Sociological Perspectives The Making of a Colonial Islamic Establishment Structure of the Study 1 The Geographical and Historical Context and the Lines of Institutional Change 1.1 CONTRASTS BETWEEN EASTERN AND WESTERN ALGERIA The Precolonial State and Religious Education The Marabouts and the Secular Chiefs\n\n1.2 THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AND STATE INTERVENTION Ottoman State Intervention in Practice From Islamic to Colonial State Intervention\n\n2 Saintly Justice: the Majlis of Mascara, 1853-1856 2.1 MASCARA UNDER THE BEYS 2.2 'ABD AL-QADIR'S STATE: ITS RELATION TO THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE MASCARA REGION \"Sharifism\" and Social Stratification\n\n2.3 MASCARA SOCIETY, 1853-1856 2.4 THE INSTITUTION: PERSONNEL AND PROCEDURES 2.5 AN ANALYSIS OF THE REGISTER Unusual Cases: the Majlis as Mediator Common Cases and Salient Conflicts Acts of Violence Maniage Divorce Shafa'a (Pre-emption) Mobile Property\n\n3 3 5 10 23 25\n\n28 28 32 34 35 39 40 43 44 46 47 54 56 6I 62\n\n66 66 67 71 72 78\n\nχ I CONTENTS\n\n2.6 SUMMARY\n\n3 The Urban Milieu: Social \"Decadence\" and its Judicial Underpinnings 3.1 ALGIERS AND CONSTANTINE IN THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY 3.2 ATOMIZATION IN THE URBAN MILIEU: SOME INTEGRATIVE ASPECTS OF DISINTEGRATION Divorce and the Social Role of the City 3.3 HADRI NOTABLE DIVISIVENESS AND COLONIAL RULE The Notables and Judicial Ajfairs Special Problems in Urban Judicial Ajfairs 3.4 QADI AND MAJLIS: JUDICIAL ROLES AND SOURCES OF RECRUITMENT\n\n4 Muslim Legists and the \"Moral Conquest\" 4.1 COMPOSITION OF THE CONSEILS Hasan Ben Brihmat and Islamic Modernism Other Conseillers 4.2 FACING THE ISSUES Slavery Orphanages Child Marriage 4.3 THE CONSEIL SUP£RIEUR DE DROIT AND THE GREAT SLEEPING BABY DEBATE 4.4 THE END OF THE ERA OF ACCOMMODATION\n\n5 Intervention and Crisis, 1854-1859 5.1 JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION BEFORE 1854 5.2 THE POLITICAL CONTEXT 5.3 MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE DECREE The Drawing of Circumscriptions and the Definition of the Qadi's Role Recruitment of Judicial Personnel The Medersas 5.4 THE MAJLIS CRISIS 5.5 THE ORANAIS MAJLIS INCIDENTS Oran Mascara Sidi Bel Abbes and Tlemcen The End of the 1854 System\n\n6 From Crisis to Rebellion to Compromise, 1860-1866 6.1 THE DECREE OF 31 DECEMBER 1859\n\n80\n\n82 82 84\n\n86 95 97 99 103\n\n107 110 112 114 118 119 122 124 128 130\n\n134 134 137 140\n\n140 144 145 148 150 152 156 160 162\n\n165 165\n\nCONTENTS I xi\n\n6.2 REPERCUSSIONS OF THE DECREE The De Facto Elimination of the Majlis The Qadi as Point of Maximum Stress The Medersas: an Inadequate Remedy Discipline Problems 6.3 REBELLION 1864-1865 The Assassination Wave Qadis as Rebels and as Victims of the Rebellion 6.4 THE AFTERMATH: NEW MEN . . . and a New System\n\n7 Those Who Succeeded 7.1 METHODOLOGY 7.2 THE QUANTITATIVE DIMENSIONS OF CHANGE 7.3 CASE STUDIES A Petite Kabylie Marabout: Sa'id Ben al-Muhub Sha'ib Ben al-Hajj 'Ali: a Tlemceni Sharif 7.4 TYPES OF ITINERANT MAGISTRATE Two Isolated Cases Mascaran Exiles in the Constantinois Migrants from the Petite Kabylie 7.5 CONCLUSION\n\n8 Toward a Definitive Compromise: Politics and the Muslim Court Question in the 1880s 8.1 THE STRUGGLE FOR THE LEVERS OF JUDICIAL POWER 8.2 FERMENT IN CONSTANTINE 'Abd al-Qadir al-Majjawi and the Beginning of the Local Nahda Al-Makki Ben Badis, Pamphleteer 8.3 THE THREADS INTERTWINE: THE GUELMA CONSPIRACY OF 1881 8.4 CONSTANTINE POLITICS IN THE 1880s: ORIGINS OF A TRANSACTION Al-Muntakhib: Political Journalism Comes to Constantine The June Riots of 1887 8.5 A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP\n\n9 The Aftermath: Algerians as Colonialists and Frenchmen as 'Ulama 9.1 MOHAMMED BEN RAHHAL AND THE PLEA FOR DIALOGUE 9.2 ALGERIAN ISLAM AND FRENCH COLONIAL EXPANSION\n\n167 169 171 173 174 176 176 178 181 184\n\n188 191 192 198 198 203 206 207 210 217 220\n\n223 225 229 230 233 234 236 237 239 241\n\n244 245 247\n\nxii I CONTENTS\n\n9.3 THE CODIFICATION OF ISLAMIC LAW 9.4 THE ALGERIAN INTELLECTUALS AND WORLD WAR I\n\n253 256\n\nConclusion The Study in Summary The Study in Comparative Perspective\n\n262 262 265\n\nBiographical Notes\n\n274\n\nArchival Sources\n\n282\n\nBibliography Index\n\n290 303\n\nLIST OF TABLES\n\n1.

In the spelling of names, I have tried to take account of several considerations: consistency, fidelity to pronunciation, and usefulness to researchers, who will be most likely to encounter names in a rather idiosyncratic French transcription, or else in the Arabic. Place names have fairly standard French transcriptions, so I have stuck with these. Names of people, except for the best-known ones, tend to vary in their French transcription, and so with these I stay closer to the Li­ brary of Congress system, though I use \"e\" for the short \"i,\" as in the ubiquitous \"Ben.\" For some of the more important names, I provide alternative spellings in the index. For those who might refer to a recently published atlas, or carry this book on a road trip through Algeria, they will find the following name changes: Old Name\n\nNew Name\n\nAlgiers Aumale Bone Bougie Constantine Oran Orleansville Philippeville\n\nEl-Djezair Sour el-Ghozlane Annaba Bejaia Qsontina Wahran El-Asnam Skikda\n\n\"Old\" and \"new\" are of course misnomers, since the \"new\" names are in most instances older than the \"old\" ones. Such are the confu­ sions created by colonialism.\n\nNOTE ON ABBREVIATIONS\n\nMany of the archival documents cited are letters which were sent up or down the military administrative hierarchy, running from the commandant of a cercle, at the local level, to the commandant of a subdivision, to the commandant of a division, corresponding to the province in the civil administration.

It exploited resources and man­ power with its mines and plantations, its tax collectors and traders, and, at the same time, it harnessed traditional political hierarchies to its purposes, and paid homage to traditional values. It married mod­ ern arms, technology, and organization to traditional social and po­ litical forms, and, in the process, denatured tradition, made it archaic, and prevented development and change within a framework of tra­ dition.1 But it was not always clear where the exigencies of promoting a capitalist economy and a modern administration should leave off, and where respect for tradition—whether in the name of humanitarian idealism or pragmatism—should begin. This boundary was particu­ larly difficult to determine when it came to the sphere of law. On the one hand, one needed European commercial and property law to promote the expansion of the market. Though the exchange might be unequal, it had to be orderly. On the other hand, one needed customary law to maintain political and social stability. One needed to promote contractual relationships, and, at the same time, shore up traditional status hierarchies. The pursuit of these needs could run at cross purposes. Customary law regarding land, for instance, might prove an ob­ stacle to the acquisition of land for modern farms or to the exploi­ tation of minerals, though in some cases it could be used for precisely these purposes.2 The introduction of European land law, with its emphasis on individual ownership, might undermine traditional po1 This sort of argument was developed by many nationalist intellectuals during their struggle for independence against colonial regimes which appropriated to their own use symbols of traditional authority. See, for example, Jomo Kenyatta, Facing Mount Kenya, London, 1938. The notion of colonialism creating artificial archaism is devel­ oped by the Algerian scholar and educator Malek Bennabi in Vocation de I'lslam, Paris, 1954. 2 Robin Luckham, \"Imperialism, Law, and Structural Dependence: the Ghana Legal Profession,\" Development and Change, 9 (1978), pp. 201-248.\n\n4 I INTRODUCTION\n\nlitical authority, or set off conflicts between groups seeking to ma­ nipulate the law to their own advantage.3 Also, questions of law in the colonial setting were closely con­ cerned with relationships between communities, and inequalities in power relationships between communities. While administratively or economically it might make sense to unify laws, in terms of the pol­ itics of community relationships in the colonial setting, it often made sense to keep laws separate, in order to give the weaker group a sense of being protected, or to create a rationale for inequalities in political power. Written law posed a special problem, for where there is written law there are legal specialists, and where there were native specialists in European law in the colonies they tended to turn the law to their own purposes, to contest the authority of the colonial regime. The same law which was used to integrate the colonial economy with the capitalist market could serve the purposes of political dissent. From Calcutta to Accra, the native lawyer was a thorn in the flesh of the colonial regime. Lawyers were commonly found among the first generation of nationalists, for it was they who knew best how to contest the colonial administration on its own terms, in terms under­ stood by parliaments and by European opponents of colonial re­ gimes.4 Colonial administrations tended to see the native lawyer as an un­ scrupulous opportunist, out to exploit the gullible, and to sow dis­ cord where patriarchal peace and harmony had prevailed. They were thus inclined to keep as much of law as possible in the hands of customary sages of the village councils, or in their own presumably equally sage hands. Custom and administration were to be allied against the corrosive, divisive effects of the law and lawyers.

And in judicial proce­ dures, the imposition of clear norms and rules, called for by the bu­ reaucratic principle, clashed with the stress of custom on closing breeches in social relations.6 Further, centralized control over customary jurisdictions made it possible for colonial authorities to intervene to decree changes in cus­ tom, with humane intentions, no doubt, but often with little under­ standing of the disruptive effects that such measures would have.7 And it was also possible that such centralized control could be used to prevent changes in customary law, especially when colonial ex­ perts had committed it to writing.8 Nevertheless, it seems to have been possible, at least in some cir­ cumstances, for communities to adapt new offices to their own pur­ poses. One might read some of the abundant criticism of men hold­ ing these offices \"as a measure of the recognition that had been accorded to the court in village opinion.\"9 ISLAMIC LAW IN THE COLONIAL SETTING\n\nIn many parts of the colonial world, there was another element to complicate the equation, and this was the existence of an indigenous written law, and a class specialized in it. This had obvious advantages over fragmented and poorly defined customary systems, although, as colonial jurists were often slow in realizing, giving official recog­ nition to a written law often meant imposing the law followed by one class or group on communities which had followed their own customs.10 Working with an indigenous written law avoided contributing to the growth of a class of Europeanized native legal professionals. And it gave birth to what one might consider the opposite of this, a class of Orientalist European judges and legal scholars, immersed in the 6 Lloyd Fallers, Bantu Bureaucracy: A Century af Political Evolution Among the Basoga of Uganda, Cambridge, U.K., 1956. 7 See, for example, Marlene Dobkin, \"Colonialism and the Legal Status of Women in Francophone Africa,\" Cahiers des Etudes Afiicaines, 31 (1968), pp. 390-405. 8 This was the case of Kabyle customary law in Algeria, where Kabyle custom had been committed to writing in the 1870s. At the same time as the French preserved Kabyle custom, they introduced French schooling on a comparatively large scale, thus creating the forces which were to undermine custom.

With its stress on the unity of believers, and the important role assigned to the state, Islamic law seemed in some ways quite compatible with modern European values, as evidenced by Napoleon's enthusiasm for Islam.12 But the workings of Muslim courts had always rather bewildered Europeans. Those who had direct experience with them usually re­ ported that the chaos of the procedures and the unruliness of the Utigants were surpassed only by the corruption of the judges. Fur­ ther, and in a quite different vein, Islam had played an important role in mobilization against European colonial rule in nearly all Muslim countries,13 and it stood to reason that to encourage Islam, in any of its aspects, was to lend support, sooner or later, to resistance to Eu­ ropean rule, of a sort far more difficult to deal with than that of a few highly vocal European lawyers. And, in rural areas of Muslim countries, it was often the case that customary jurisdictions still held sway when the Europeans arrived, and it was argued that it made sense to promote ethnic custom as a bulwark against Islamic political influence.14 Yet, where Islamic law was well established, bewildering though it might be, a colonial regime could not threaten to eliminate it or tamper with it without running grave risks,15 for Islamic law was an integral part of the Islamic faith, and a threat to it could be seen as a step toward forced conversion. It was hard enough for Muslims to swallow their pride and reconcile themselves to colonial rule. The justification for doing so always had two provisos: that one could 11 On some twentieth-century British examples, see Enid Hill, \"Orientalism and Liberal Legalism,\" Review of Middle East Studies, 2 (1978), pp. 57-70. 12 Edward Said, Orientalism, New York, 1979, pp. 82-83.

It was usually possible to separate out areas of law considered to be essential to the interests of the colonial regime, such as criminal law, and modern commercial law, to be put under the jurisdiction of European courts, and indeed this was a practice common to both European colonial and modernizing Muslim regimes. But in coun­ tries where the colonial state was concerned with creating a market in land to promote colonization and agricultural investment, it could not avoid becoming entangled in questions of Islamic law.16 The problems which the Muslim courts could pose for the colonial state are encapsulated in the term coined by Max Weber, \"qadi jus­ tice.\"17 According to Weber, qadi justice lacked the formal rationality found in the Roman law tradition, which he saw as essential to the development of the modern state and the capitalist economy. Rather, qadi justice is \"empirical,\" adapting to the situation at hand, and, at the same time, it is, somewhat paradoxically, \"fettered to tradition.\" In other words, Islamic law is not, at least from the Western point of view, systematically predictable in its results, nor is it amenable to imposed change. In looking at Islamic law through Weberian lenses, one runs the danger of seeing it as something existing completely outside of and independent from the state.18 To counterbalance this, it is useful to 16 Much of the land in the Middle East and North Africa was held by collectivities or by the state. Where land was privately owned, it was subject to Islamic inheritance law, which prescribes mathematically precise formulae for the division of inheritances. This could create enormous difficulties for land transactions, although it could be exploited by agile speculators. For a summary of Islamic inheritance law, see A. A.

One can best understand qadi justice not as something independent from the state, but rather as something autonomous—and whose de­ gree of autonomy might vary from one setting to another. To see this autonomy, one needs to look not simply at the qadi's court, but at what happens in the case of serious disputes. A difficult case is not sent from the jurisdiction of the qadi up through a clearly defined hierarchy of state-appointed judges, but instead it is thrown open to a rather vaguely defined (at least from a European point of view) process of consultation with the leading religious scholars, or 'ulama, either individually or collectively, in a judicial assembly, known as a majlis.21 This process of consultation is a hallmark of Islamic justice, as traditionally practiced, and it is a key to understanding the relation­ ship between ruler and religious leaders in a Mushm society. The ruler had the right, indeed the obligation, to appoint the qadi, but the 'ulama as a group possessed a degree of autonomous authority, since it was they, as experts in the religious law, who were the ulti­ mate arbiters of Islamic values. This seemingly nebulous process of appeal by consultation, and the integrally related factor of the autonomy of the 'ulama, could be a serious irritant to the colonial administrator or military officer or judge, who was accustomed to working in well-defined hierarchies, where authority is delegated from the top. The analogy which some Muslim reformers in the nineteenth century drew between the majlis and the European parliament was by no means an artificial one.22 The 19 Fernand Braudel, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, trans.

Tradi­ tional Muslim rulers might use all manner of threats and inducements to bring the 'ulama into line, and an especially strong and effective ruler might forge them into \"an army working to enhance the pre­ rogatives of princes.\" Colonial regimes, however, were not likely to achieve this, and apt to resign themselves to the fact that, at least in certain areas of law, they had to deal with what they regarded as a band of cantankerous obscurantists. There was one noteworthy exception to this rule, and this was Algeria, where the impact of colonial rule was more profound, and the eventual process of decolonization more violent, than in virtually any other African or Asian country.23 Here, the French colonial re­ gime, in the last half of the nineteenth century, made a thorough­ going effort to impose the rationality of the Roman law tradition upon Algerian qadi justice. They transformed a loosely organized system, varying from one locality to another, into a highly central­ ized one, run along bureaucratic lines, subordinated to the French courts through the appeal process.24 Although bureaucratization of the Muslim courts accorded well with the goals of the colonial regime, it was sharply disputed as to whether one of its byproducts—the reenforcement of the Algerian Islamic identity—accorded with those goals. Thus, in the 1880s, there was a major campaign, led by colon politicians and French jurists, to eliminate both the Muslim courts and the law schools, and to put Islamic law entirely in the hands of French judges. This led the Al­ gerian Muslim urban notables to rally in protest, in what was their first concerted political action in sixty years of colonial domination.

Haakon Chevalier, New York, 1967. 24 Another, rather different, example was India, where the British reduced the qadi to the role of consultant to the British magistrate, and elaborated what was to become known as Anglo-Muhammadan law. See Joseph Schacht, An Introduction to Islamic Lau/, Oxford, 1964, especially Chapter 14, \"Anglo-Muhammadan Law and Droit Musulman Algerien.\" On the Islamicjurisprudence of French courts in Algeria, see JeanPaul Charnay1 La vie musulmane en Algerie selon la jurisprudence de la premiere moitie du vingttime Steele, Paris, 1965.\n\n10 I INTRODUCTION\n\nThis movement marks the beginning of modern protest and resist­ ance in Algeria. The notables eventually received a sympathetic hear­ ing in metropolitan France, but, strangely enough, some of their de­ mands also received the support of colon politicians. It was thus that the courts and the Islamic law schools were saved, and their status as permanent fixtures in the colonial system confirmed.25 The transformation of the Muslim court system had a powerful impact on Algerian society. It brought about far-reaching changes in the legal process, by instituting appeals to the French courts and eliminating the traditional process of consultation. It brought a large number of Algerian Muslim religious scholars into the service of the colonial state, and laid the foundations for an official Islamic estab­ lishment, including \"clergy,\" scholars, and judges. And, finally, it helped to create a kind of uneasy equilibrium within the colonial cities and towns, whereby the Muslim community retained a distinct identity in its legal affairs, and, at the same time, accepted that it could exercise only limited influence in the realm of politics. This Romanized, bureaucratized system of qadi justice, while its creation had in itself represented a major change, came in the end to be an impediment to change in two significant ways. First, Islamic law was used as a rationale for political inequalities until the political reforms following World War II, when it was finally decided that French citizenship and Muslim legal status were compatible. But by then it was too late for reform.26 And, second, because Algerian Is­ lam was so thoroughly bureaucratized, and placed under the control of French officials, evolution and change within Algerian Islam was impeded. Having effectively destroyed the traditional autonomy of the 'ulama, the French made it impossible to protest and dissent within officially recognized Islamic structures. It is thus that one Algerian Muslim scholar, on the eve of the revolution in 1954, pronounced that colonialism was \"an immense sabotage of history.\"27\n\nHISTORICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES\n\nThe study of the bureaucratization of the Muslim courts opens up important perspectives in both colonial Algerian history and the so25 For an insightful summary of the tensions and contradictions in French Islamic legal policy in Algeria, see Jean-Robert Henry, \"Droit musulman et structure d'etat moderne en Algerie: l'heritage colonial,\" in Ernest Gellner and Jean-Claude Vatin, eds., Islam et politique au Maghreb, Pans, 1981, pp. 305-313. 26 Tony Smith, The French Stake in Algeria, 1945-1962, Ithaca, N.Y., 1978. 27 Malek Bennabi, Vocation de I'lslam, Paris, 1954, p. 101.\n\nINTRODUCTION | 11\n\nciology of Islam. It provides an opportunity to think about Algeria in Islamic terms, and to reintegrate the Algerian colonial experience with that of other Muslim countries, whose experience with Euro­ pean domination was usually through one or another form of indirect rule, whereas the Algerian experience is identified with political di­ rect rule and cultural assimilation. The sociology of Islam began as a colonial discipline, with its roots mainly in Algeria and Morocco, and it was concerned above all with types of Islamic leader who exercised influence independently of the state, or at least independently of any formal connection with it.28 In Morocco, some attention was paid to the role of the traditional state in religious affairs. But in Algeria, not a word was breathed about the relationship between the colonial state and Islam, or about the official Islamic establishment. The sociology of Islam meant prima­ rily the study of Islam as a folk religion.29 The image which one gets of Algerian Islam in reading such studies is a decidedly partial one, and it does not give one a basis for understanding the nature of Al­ gerian Islam as it has developed since independence. This aspect of the sociology of Islam in colonial Algeria is an il­ lustration of a much wider problem in the study of social and cultural life in the colonized world, where anthropologists have often gone about studying peoples as if the colonial state, or its independent successor, did not exist, or at least did not have all that great a bear­ ing on day-to-day life. The approach of this study is to take rather the opposite tack: to examine in detail how the colonial state inter­ vened in the lives of the colonized, especially in an aspect of it which would normally be termed traditional.\n\nThe Historical Perspective: the Colonial State and the Reordering of Algerian Society\n\nThere would seem to be no place for the Muslim courts in the the­ ories of direct rule and assimilation, which were the guiding princi­ ples of colonial administration in Algeria. Direct rule meant the in28 Edmund Burke III, \"The Sociology of Islam: the French Tradition,\" in Malcolm Kerr, ed., Islamic Studies, A Tradition and Its Problems, Malibu, Calif., 1980.

Assimilation meant the propagation of French language and culture.30 In the first phase of French colonial rule, in the 1830s, direct rule involved the removal of all vestiges of the previous state, the Otto­ man pashalik. The French argued that this state was simply a feature of colonial rule by the Ottoman Turks, who were being replaced as colonial rulers by themselves, and that there was no such thing as an indigenous Algerian state. There was thus to be no equivalent in Algeria of the Moroccan sultan or the Tunisian bey to serve as a symbol of national sovereignty, and a focus of national unity. The Amir 'Abd al-Qadir, who led a resistance movement from 1832 to 1847, and eventually went into exile in Damascus, was treated by the French, not as a deposed sovereign, but as a representative of a kind of aristocratic reaction, what they would call a fronde.31 The French saw in 'Abd al-Qadir, not the representative of a nation, but the representative of a principle, chivalry, which many of them admired, but which most of them saw as part of an irrevocable past. The second phase of direct rule involved the dismantling of tribal structures—political units based on the principle of shared kinship— and the rather haphazard assemblage of their fragments into territo­ rial units—full-fledged communes, under colon-dominated local governments, or communes mixtes, under the tutelage of a French administrator.32 The traditional titles of agha and qaid remained in circulation, but the men who held them for the most part lacked prestige, and were generally characterized by servility toward the French, and predatory habits in dealing with their own people.33 One needs to view the policy of deliberate fragmentation in the 30 French institutions were modified to meet Algerian conditions, allowing for less participation and more constraint, but they were all derived from French models. For a description of Algerian colonial institutions, see Jean-Claude Vatin, L'Algerie poli­ tique: histoire et societe, Paris, 1974. Originally, the term \"assimilation\" was applied to institutions, in the sense of making Algerian institutions the same as those in France, with little thought as to where the Algerian Muslims would fit into them. I am using the term here in the later and now current sense of cultural assimilation. 31 On the frondist thesis, see Raphael Danziger, Abd al-Qadir and the Algerians, New York, 1976.

The policy was aimed against the extensive and autonomous structures of the tribes, which had impeded the assertion of effective influence by the colonial administration.35 Even after the principal resistance movements had been put down in 1848, the French were plagued by what they saw as essentially tribally based rebellions. These lasted until 1871 in the coastal area, and until 1917 in the far reaches of the desert.36 Further, tribal resources in land were insulated from the cap­ italist marketplace, whose expansion the colonial state was commit­ ted to promoting, the occasional romantic-minded Bureau Arabe of­ ficer notwithstanding.37 The problem of tribal dissidence was a serious one for all modern­ izing regimes in the Middle East, including indigenous ones, such as those of 'Abd al-'Aziz Ibn Sa'ud in Saudi Arabia, and Reza Shah in Iran.38 One might suggest as a general rule that the greater the frag­ mentation engendered by the regime, the greater the problems which arose in establishing a viable new hierarchy, patching together the debris of the tribal system into a new one, trying to fill the vacuum left by the removal of tribal leaders with an assortment of urban interlopers and rural parvenus. The Algerian experience was distin­ guished by the particularly radical character of fragmentation. Mar­ shal Lyautey, the most famous exponent of indirect rule in the French colonial school, saw at first hand the unhappy results of direct rule in Algeria at the end of the nineteenth century, and thus, in laying the foundations of the Moroccan protectorate, he placed great stress on keeping traditional political and social structures intact. While the structures of resistance had been largely tribal, the ide34\n\nAnnie Rey-Goldziguer, Le Royaume Arabe: Ia politique algerienne de Napoleon III,\n\n1861-1870, Algiers, 1977. 35 For a highly systematized view of the relation between states and tribes in the Muslim world, see Xavier de Planahol1 Les fondements geographiques de Vhistoire de I'lslam, Paris, 1968. 36 The most important rebellions occurred in 1864-1865, 1871, and 1881. The only recent book-length study of one of them is Djilali Sari, L'Insurrection de 1881, Algiers, 1981. There were two significant uprisings during World War I, in the Aures moun­ tains and near the town of Mascara, which can be seen as a sort of transition between primary resistance and the revolution of 1954-1962. 37 The key measure in breaking up collective ownership of land was the Senatus Consulte of 1863.

The policy of assimilation grew in part out of a desire to neutralize the political potential of Islam.40 It might also be seen as responding to a need to provide a cultural basis for the anticipated reconstruction of tribal fragments into a new society, amenable to centralized rule, and to the mobilization of resources in land and labor to accommodate the expansion of colonial commercial agriculture. But assimilation was opposed from some colonial quarters.41 In so far as it meant the enfranchisement of Muslims within the French system, it was opposed by the colons. Connected to this was their desire to monopolize for themselves nearly all public investment, not only in economic projects, but in the cultural and social spheres as well. Their policy for the natives was, in effect, not one of accultu­ ration, but rather one of deculturation. For the Muslims, assimilation was a threat to their cultural heritage and identity, and hence to their very ability to act as a cohesive social group. As a result, assimilation in Algeria was a highly restrictive and emotion-charged process.42 To gain full access to modern scientific and technical culture, and to the rights of a citizen, the Algerian had to abandon nearly all aspects of his culture, and cut himself off from his community. The final, decisive step of formal naturalization as a French citizen required the renunciation of Islamic law. If, in theory, a broadly based assimilation would have provided the means for co­ herent social reconstruction, this restrictive assimilation merely ac­ centuated the problem of fragmentation, by depriving Algerian so­ ciety of educated leaders. Here again, the case of Algeria is a particularly radical manifesta­ tion of a problem common through much of the Muslim world. Modern scientific and technical culture, even though the Muslim world had made a strong contribution to its development, came to the Mus­ lim world in the nineteenth century as an essentially European im39 Peter von Sivers, \"The Realm of Justice: Apocalyptic Revolts in Algeria (18491879),\" Humaniora Islamica, 1 (1973), pp. 47-60. 40 Yvonne Turin, Affiontements culturels dans I'Algerie coloniale: ecoles, medecines, reli­ gions, 1830-1880, Paris, 1971. 41 The most thorough study of these and many other questions in the middle period of colonial history is Charles-Robert Ageron, Les Algeriens musulmans et la France, 18711920, 2 volumes, Paris, 1968. 42 Fanny Colonna, Instituteurs algeriens, 1883-1919, Paris, 1975.

Often one found that either foreigners or local non-Muslim minority groups had privileged access to modern education and the modern sector of the economy, while the Muslims, although they were politically dominant, were mainly confined to traditional edu­ cation, to the traditional sector of the urban economy, and to landed wealth. For a Muslim, gaining a position in the modern economic or technical spheres thus involved a departure from traditional roles, as well as competition with foreign or minority groups, who in many cases could manage to be modern without great sacrifice to their social identity. Algeria's distinction was that the colons were exceptionally strong compared to other comparable groups in Muslim countries, above all because they dominated politics and had obtained a large share of Algeria's landed wealth. They had intruded on what were normally Muslim preserves. For Algerian Muslims, then, traditional sources of power and prestige were thus sharply eroded, while access to the modern sector remained substantially blocked. This background is necessary to understanding the importance of the Muslim courts in colonial Algeria. One aspect of their importance should be immediately evident, namely that they were a bulwark of the Muslim identity against the threat of assimilation. And because of the dismantling of the Ottoman state, the Muslim courts were the only institutional focus of identity available. For the colons, the Mus­ lim courts had an ambivalent character. They could be used as part of an argument against the extension of political rights, but, at the same time, they carried the latent threat which colons tended to see in anything Islamic. As will emerge in the course of this study, the Muslim courts did not fall victim to the same process of fragmentation as tribal political structures. In fact, rather the opposite occurred. Judicial structures were at an early date detached from tribal structures, with their net­ work of rural markets, and integrated with the network of urban centers which were the nodal points of the colonial economic and political system.43 The qadi, or Muslim judge, became a leading fig­ ure in a new emerging stratum of Muslim urban notables, comprised of government employees, merchants, and professionals, many of whom were also landowners. If leaders were to emerge to speak for the collective interests of the Algerian Muslims within the colonial 43Xavier Yacono, La colonisation des plaines du Chelif, 2 vols., Algiers, 1955-1956; and A.

Its importance was accentuated by the fact that, until the 1920s, the Mushm notables, to say nothing of the masses, had very little say in local politics, which were in the hands of the elected representatives of the colons. Within the colonial town of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Muslim court was the only institution with which the Algerian Muslims could identify, and also the only one through which they could bypass the colon-dominated local political structures to higher levels of the French administration.\n\nThe Sociological Perspective: the Colonial State and the Delegation of Religious Authority\n\nHow smoothly did this transformation occur? How did it change the legal process? How did it affect the nature of religious leadership in Algeria, and the relationship of the religious leaders to the colonial state? A central aspect to all these questions is that when the French imposed uniform structures on the Algerian Muslim judicial system, there was significant variation in the results from region to region. In the East, initial adaptation was fairly smooth, but Muslim leaders of the region worked to maintain their autonomy within the system. When the Mushm courts were threatened with dissolution in the 1880s, Easterners mobilized to defend them. In the West, the imposition of the new structures initially provoked a severe crisis, but, after that, the adaptation of Westerners to them was relatively passive. The principal tools which we have for the analysis of Muslim re­ ligious leadership in North Africa are the concepts of 'ulama and marabout, the scholars and the holy man. On the surface, they are simple enough. The 'ulama are Muslim scholars, bearers of an aus­ tere, egalitarian, scripturalist Islam, closely associated with the affairs of state, as judges and legal consultants. They form a prestigious elite within the Mushm city. The term \"marabout\" refers to a saint, or to his descendants, who are thought to inherit his baraka, or divine grace, and who form hereditary religious lineages, who are special44 On the notables in a small Algerian town, see Gilbert Grandguillaume, Nedroma, evolution d'une medina, Leiden, 1976.

Their efficacy in these tasks—whether rituals, or healing, or mediation—is thought to depend on their possession of baraka. The 'ulama uphold the known, revealed principles of re­ ligion, embodied in the shari'a. The marabouts intercede with God, in matters where His will cannot be fully understood, by virtue of their baraka. When they are considered together, the concepts of marabout and 'ulama are inevitably linked to the question of the relationship be­ tween tribes and cities in North Africa. Should they be viewed as separate systems, largely isolated from one another? Or as part of a complex whole? Related to this is the volatile question of whether, in precolonial Algeria, there was a state worthy of the name. Were the cities mere islands of civilization in a sea of tribal anarchy? Were such ties as existed between city and tribe just a confusing welter of transient alliances and conflicts? Or was there substantial articulation, an enduring pattern of social and political ties? One approach to the maraboutic phenomenon is to look at it within tribal society, isolated from the state and the cities, on the assumption that it can be best understood in this way. This is the approach of Ernest Gellner, who explains the role of marabouts in relation to a social system based on segmentary opposition.45 The maraboutic lin­ eages are seen to occupy the interstices of this system, acting as me­ diators between opposed tribal segments. Mediation is the key here, for it implies the absence of any state control in the process of resolving conflicts. Disputes in a segmentary society are not between individuals who are members of a unified community, in which they have a legally defined status, but rather between individuals as members of agnatic groups. Such disputes cannot be resolved by a sovereign judgment applying a written code of law, but rather need to be resolved through the mediation of a professional neutral, applying his hereditary or personal divine inspi­ ration to the task of maintaining balance between the opposed seg­ ments. From this position as mediator, the marabout can also act as a mobilizer, rallying the tribes against external aggression, as in resist­ ance to the Spanish and Portuguese incursions in the sixteenth cen­ tury, or in resistance led by the Sanusiyya to the Italian invasion of Libya in the twentieth century.46 The problem with the segmentary approach is that it deals with 45 46\n\nErnest Gellner, Saints of the Atlas, London, 1969. Edward Evans-Pntchard, The Sanusi of Cyrenaica, London, 1949.\n\n18 I INTRODUCTION\n\nthe tribal domain in isolation from, or in resistance to, the state. In North Africa, at least since the sixteenth century, only tribes in the very remote mountain or desert regions existed in effective isolation from the state. Nevertheless, using segmentary theory as a starting point helps to formulate some useful questions. At what point, or in what circumstances, do the disputes of tribesmen become amenable to adjudication? When do problems of social relationships, as distinct from those of spiritual and physical well-being, move from the realm of baraka to that of shari'a? When we come to the view of the maraboutic phenomenon advanced by Clifford Geertz, we have passed that point. Geertz presents the Moroccan tribes, not as living in iso­ lation from cities and state, but rather as living in uneasy symbiosis with them.47 In this view, the maraboutic phenomenon is an element in a larger, unified system, or, to state the thesis more accurately, it became part of a unified system, that of Morocco under the Sa'adian and then the 'Alawite dynasties, between roughly the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries.48 In becoming a unified phenomenon, maraboutism became something different: sharifism.49 Where the mara­ bout simply claims descent from a local holy man, the sharif claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad, and it is this which creates the unity of the Moroccan system. As a social ideology, sharifism unifies local religious leaders into a class, and as a political one, it creates a sort of centralization of baraka. In the analysis of the unified Moroccan social and political system by Abdallah Laroui, the ashraf and the 'ulama are conceived of as distinct orders within the complex hierarchy of Moroccan society.50 He points to some key distinctions between them. The power and prestige of the ashraf is in effect delegated by the sultan, in his official recognition of their status as descendants of the Prophet, and he him­ self is a sort of supreme sharif. Laroui does, however, make note of some exceptional cases where ashraf do have independent bases of power at a local level. Another complicating factor in the system was the presence of Sufi tariqas, or brotherhoods, and one should not be 47 Clifford Geertz, Islam Observed: Religious Development itt Morocco and Indonesia, Chicago, 1968. 48 Magali Morsy, Les Ahansala: examen du role historique d'une Jamille maraboutique de I'Atlas au dix-huitieme Steele, Paris, 1972. 49 This phenomenon is found in nearly all parts of the Muslim world, though its character varies from one setting to another, adapting to local social organization and concepts. It would form an interesting subject for a broad comparative study. 50 Abdallah Laroui, Les origines soctales et culturelles du nationalisme marocain (18301912), Paris, 1980, pp. 92-103.\n\nINTRODUCTION | 19\n\nsurprised that sultans have from time to time sought ways of either unifying or abolishing them. An important characteristic which differentiates the 'ulama from the ashraf, as Laroui sees it, is that they have a certain autonomy from the state, the foundation of which lies in the inalienable reli­ gious endowments, which provide an independent financial basis for the schools and mosques. One should also mention the 'ulama's role in the majlis, or judicial assembly, since it is in this institution, rather than the office of qadi (which the ruler fills by direct appointment) that we can see them exercising authority in autonomous fashion. And one should note that the principle at work in the majlis, in which the consensus of the leading 'ulama is sought, in especially difficult cases, also operates when the 'ulama pronounce their views on the legality of an action taken by the sultan. Laroui stresses that the power of the 'ulama is limited, and that it is linked with the power of the sultan, in his image, \"twinned\" (conaissant) with it. The 'ulama can criticize, they can demand that the sultan justify his actions in terms of Islamic principles, but they do not have the symbolic or political basis for venturing into open re­ bellion. The problem, in looking at Algeria, is that one cannot speak of a maraboutic phenomenon which had been incorporated into a unified system as it was under the umbrella of the sharifian dynasties of Morocco. The Ottoman sultans, under whose rather distant sover­ eignty Algeria fell from the early sixteenth century until 1830, were the guardians of Islam, bound to uphold Islamic law and to defend the House of Islam from the infidel, but they did not, like the 'Alawite sultans of Morocco, lay any claim to a hereditary religious char­ acter. The relationship between the Ottoman governors of Algeria and the local marabouts, and then between the French rulers and these same figures, could best be described as a tactical one, based on mutual convenience.51 Ottoman governors, or French ones, could grant favors to local marabouts, and in return benefit from their re­ ligious influence. But this could not serve as the basis of a coherently unified system.52 The French, through the incessant fighting of the early years of 51 On Ottoman Algeria, see Lucette Valensi, Le Maghreb avant la prise d'Alger, Paris, 1970; and Andrew Hess, The Forgotten Frontier: A History of the Sixteenth Century IberoAfrican Frontier, Chicago, 1978. 52 In Algiers, there was an officially recognized corporation of sharifs, headed by a naqib, as there was in other Ottoman cities, but it does not seem to have survived into the colonial period.\n\n20 I INTRODUCTION\n\ntheir conquest, came to recognize all too well the role which the marabouts could play as leaders of rural resistance, especially in their capacity as leaders of the Sufi tariqas. Against this background, I suggest, the decision to create a unified, centralized Muslim court system in 1854, just as the French were completing the pacification of northern Algeria, represented a bold venture in religious policy, an attempt to build an Algerian religious unity, under the control of the colonial state, on the basis of Islamic law. It was a bureaucratic, secular-minded approach to the problem, as befitted mid-nineteenthcentury France. But there was to be a good deal more to this venture than simply unifying the system and building a corps of Muslim religious leaders loyal to France. For, in the process, the French would seek to intro­ duce to, or, if necessary, impose upon, the Muslim judicial system the rationality which the French expected of legal institutions, and which was required for effectively establishing a market in land. There was an impressive logic to the project. Since law, as the French understood it, involved learning rather than belief, it was an aspect of Islam which could be easily integrated into the colonial system, proving France's benevolence toward Islam, and providing a basis on which to draw the religious leaders, as a class, into an alliance with the colonial state. And yet there was also a certain na­ ivete to it, since the French had little understanding of the traditional judicial system, and were inclined to project their own ideas on it. They did not seem to see that an abrupt intervention in legal affairs, imposing a rigidly uniform judicial system, might lead to resistance, or to confusion and turmoil. At the same time, it was bound to arouse the ire of those French settlers, administrators, and judicial officials who were opposed to giving any scope to Islam within the French system. If one viewed the problem of imposing uniform structures simply as one of centralization, then one would be likely to expect the most serious problems to arise in remote areas, distant from urban and state influence, where, in Weber's terms, the \"prophetic justice\" of the marabouts prevailed. But the most serious problems arose in the densely populated areas of the West, particularly in the region of Mascara. Here, social, political, and religious problems were all in­ terwoven, and the source of difficulty lay, not in saintly mediation, but in the very broad scope which seemed to be given to judicial consultation. In Mascara, members of a local sharifian aristocracy had a predom­ inant say in judicial affairs, and central to this was the informal struc-\n\nINTRODUCTION | 21\n\nture of the majlis, the composition of which varied from case to case. The great flexibility of the majlis, and the stress on forming judg­ ments through consensus, provided them with a means of parrying the influence of the state in legal questions. The Mascaran ashraf, it should be added, had been the mainstay of 'Abd al-Qadir's resistance movement and state-building effort, so they saw the French state and its local allies with particular hostility. But the critical point is that, in this setting, the principle of consultation seemed to be pushed to the point where autonomy shades into independence. The great flex­ ibility of the majlis, and the assertion of independence from the state of a strong local religious aristocracy, seemed to be closely interre­ lated. However, when it became clear that the French would succeed in imposing their formal structures on the judicial system, this same group would recognize the importance of seeking positions in it. In other words, it was as if, once independence had been lost, it was perceived to have been completely lost, and the power of the colonial state was accepted with resignation, and with an eye to salvaging what one could of one's own wealth and status. In the East, the Ottoman state had more effectively established its influence in both the political and religious domains. Many rural marabouts had come to terms with the Ottoman state, and they looked to the 'ulama of the capital for their role models. In the capital, Constantine, 'ulama and Muslim rulers had worked out the sort of modus vivendi typical of the classical Muslim city.53 In it, the 'ulama were inured to the preponderance of the state in political affairs, and, in so accommodating themselves to the state, they carved out a degree of autonomy for themselves. The initial intervention of the French in judicial affairs followed very much the pattern of the Ottoman rulers before them, so that it did not create the problems in Constantine that it did in the West. But it was not long before it became evident that the intervention of the colonial state was to be of a radically different character than that of the traditional Muslim state. Their insistence on highly formal procedures and structures, on bringing to Islamicjudicial affairs the Weberian rationality of the French system, meant that the 'ulama were bound to lose their autonomy, unless they could keep pace with the French demand for \"rationality\" by elaborating more formal pro­ cedures, and a clear and stable jurisprudence, which anticipated any criticism which the French might make on a humanitarian basis. 53\n\nIra Lapidus, Muslim Cities in the Later Middle Ages, Cambridge, Mass., 1967.\n\n22 I INTRODUCTION\n\nThe 'ulama of Algeria, particularly Constantine, did attempt to follow just such a strategy to retain their autonomy, but in the end they failed, not due to their own inherent inability to achieve this rationality, but because of the colonial state's insistence on control. It was thus that the majlis was replaced by a channel of appeal to the French courts, and higher level Islamic education came under direct French control. What happened, in effect, was that the French took the office of qadi—the one office in the traditional Islamic system where the au­ thority of the religious official is always delegated by the ruler—and they made it the model for the entire Islamic establishment. Any religious office in which one exercised scriptural authority, whether it was expressed in legal judgments, or scholarly discourse, or public preaching, eventually came under the direct control of the French. When this process had been completed, by the early twentieth cen­ tury, scriptural authority in Algeria had taken on some of the char­ acteristics of sharifian authority in Morocco. In the latter, independ­ ent ashraf with a local base of their own represented an implicit challenge to the sultan's authority. In Algeria, when a group of in­ dividuals outside the control of the state laid a claim to scriptural authority, it was a challenge to the colonial state. This was the situ­ ation which arose in the 1930s, with the creation of the Association of Reformist 'Ulama, who were to be an important element in the development of the nationalist movement.54 One of their principal demands was the separation of religious affairs from the control of the state. They did not succeed in implementing this demand, al­ though they did, at the end of the long struggle for independence, take over the religious apparatus of the Algerian state. While the French colonial state was much stronger as an adminis­ trative structure than had been its Ottoman predecessor, with more effective control over worldly affairs, it was singularly weak when it came to spiritual matters. ReUgious figures who exercised their au­ thority in the spiritual realm were treated very warily, and carefully surveyed. It was only after the French had fully asserted their control over scriptural matters that they began to place greater emphasis on building up their alliances with local marabouts and Sufi tariqa lead­ ers. One might suggest that this grew out of a belated recognition that in so completely destroying the autonomy of the 'ulama, they had deprived them of any popular influence. 54\n\nAli Merad, Le reformisme musulman en Algerie de 1925 a 1940: essai d'histoire religieuse et sociale, Paris, 1972.\n\nINTRODUCTION | 23\n\nTHE MAKING OF A COLONIAL ISLAMIC ESTABLISHMENT\n\nWe can now turn our attention to a brief outline of the chronological development of French policy and Muslim response, first in the area of judicial affairs, and then in the closely related one of education. The assertion of control by the French came about in stages. What was in some ways the most decisive step had already occurred in 1844, before the establishment of the unified judicial system, when the French confiscated the habus endowments, and undertook to pay the salaries of the Muslim \"clergy,\" and the costs of maintaining the mosques. In the history of the court system, the progression from one stage to another was uneven, and accompanied by sometimes severe conflicts. The most critical issues, with a direct bearing on the question of autonomy, were the questions of appeals channels and the recruitment of judges. The first unified system, established in 1854, did include a system of appeals wholly independent from the French. But it was so rigidly structured that it provoked a crisis, which led in turn to the abolition of the appeals jurisdiction, the majlis, in the early 1860s, and the substitution of a channel of appeal from the qadi's court to the French courts. At the same time, the French instituted a monopoly of recruitment through the official Islamic schools, the medersas, located in Tlemcen, Algiers, and Constantine. Control over these schools gave the French not only a strong hand in the selection of future judges, but also an opportunity to inculcate them with French ideas, or at least with a pro-French reading of the classical texts of Islam. After the outbreak of a rebellion in 1864-1865, the French were prepared to listen to the demands for the restoration of autonomy, which were most strongly voiced by al-Makki Ben Badis, the qadi of Constantine, who can be seen as a defender of the traditional po­ sition of the 'ulama, but also as one who recognized that change and adaptation were necessary in order to defend that position.55 The French made only limited concessions. The most important of these was to open up recruitment to students from all schools, including local zawiya schools, maintained by scholarly marabouts, independent schools in the urban mosques, and Islamic universities in Tunisia, Morocco, and the Middle East. It is at this point that we can see the first stirrings of Islamic re­ formism and modernism in Constantine, the call for the revitalization of Arabic education, incorporating into it modern scientific educa55\n\nAl-Makki was the grandfather of the famous reformist leader 'Abd al-Hamid.\n\n24 I INTRODUCTION\n\ntion, and the purification of the faith. The principal exponent of re­ form was 'Abd al-Qadir al-Majjawi, who began teaching in an in­ dependent school, but was soon pressured into government service at the official medersa. In this episode, it is possible to see a crucial aspect of the reformist and modernist movement in the Islamic world: that it was linked to an effort by the more far-seeing 'ulama to defend their autonomy in the context of a changing political and social sys­ tem. They saw that to defend Islamic values, they would have to be understood and explained in new ways. Those who sought to con­ sole themselves with the unchangingness of tradition were them­ selves in fact being changed: from 'ulama into time-serving religious and judicial bureaucrats.56 In the late 1870s, and in the 1880s, the entire official Islamic estab­ lishment came under attack from forces which had been harrying it all along, colon politicians and French judicial officials, though by no means all members of these groups joined in the attacks. As these attacks became more serious, they stimulated protests by the urban notables, especially in the East. After a complex series of events, the Muslim courts received what amounted to their official consecration within the colonial system. The effect of attacks by colon politicians had been to help reenforce the dependence of the urban notables on the central administration. By this time, it had become clear that official relations between France and Islam in Algeria had been confined to a rather narrow channel. The Muslim courts contributed little to the sense of legiti­ macy of the colonial administration, and, at this time, Islamic legit­ imacy was becoming more important to colonial France, as she con­ templated plans for expanding her control in the Muslim world in West Africa and Morocco, and as she vied for influence in the Middle East. This led to the final phase in the building of the official Islamic establishment, when the French attempted to build up its religious and educational wings along the same lines as the judicial one. Cen­ tral to this was the expansion of the scope of the official medersas, up until then almost exclusively legal training schools, and the ad­ dition of a superior division in Algiers. By the outbreak of World War I, it was apparent that the loyalty of members of this official Islamic establishment was to a large extent 56 For Algerian views of cultural history, see 'Ali Dabbuz, Nahda al-Jazair al-haditha wa thawratuha al-mubarika (Algeria's Modern Renaissance and Her Sacred Revolution), Algiers, 1965; and the anticipated third volume of Bilqasim Sa'adallah, Tarikh al-Jazair al-thaqafi (The Cultural History of Algeria).\n\nINTRODUCTION | 25\n\nperfunctory, and that many of them still looked to the Middle East for religious and intellectual leadership. Further, their popular influ­ ence in Algeria was quite limited compared to that of the independent marabouts, upon whom the French came to rely more and more. After World War I, establishment 'ulama were still to be found for posts in the official clergy, but their prestige would continue to dwindle. Theirs was what the French would condescendingly call \"MM Islam du bon ton,\" learned, even erudite, but in a stiffly classical way, open to modernity, but mainly in the sense of politely nodding ap­ proval. By the 1920s, as an Islamic reformist movement took shape outside the official establishment, it had become a relic. STRUCTURE OF THE STUDY\n\nAs we move into the details of the study, it is important to bear in mind the types of sources used, and how they affect the character of the chapters. Ironically, the sources available become more uneven as one progresses over time, for the records of the civilian side of the Algerian administration have been less effectively preserved and or­ ganized than those of the military regime, which, by the 1870s, was being confined to more remote areas of the High Plains and the des­ ert. Because French colonial rule up until the end of the nineteenth century worked so effectively to undermine the political and cultural identity of Algerians, there is little material by them, in published form, before the 1890s. The first chapter will be concerned with establishing the geograph­ ical and historical foundations of the study, particularly in explaining the differences in patterns of religious leadership, and in relations between religious leaders and the state, between East and West. It will also outline the stages in development of state intervention in judicial affairs, drawing on what sparse reports we have concerning the Ottoman and early colonial periods. Chapter 2 focuses on judicial affairs in one key area, Mascara, which had been the center of 'Abd al-Qadir's state. It is based primarily on the records of the majlis of Mascara in the years just prior to the first colonial state intervention in 1856, and it provides a key to under­ standing why that intervention would provoke a crisis. It allows us to explore in depth the character of the sharifian elite of the Mascara region, and the role of Islamic law in social and economic life. Chapter 3 is concerned with a social milieu which contrasts sharply with that of Mascara: the major cities of Algiers and Constantine. It draws on the records of the civil Bureaux Arabes, which provide a\n\n26 I INTRODUCTION\n\nwealth of social and economic data from the early 1850s up until their dismantlement in 1858. Through this and other material, we are able to gain important insights on the character of the urban elite, and we will see a link between the nature of Islamic law, as administered by the urban qadis, and the individualistic character of urban social life. In Chapter 4, we move to the ideas of the prominent figures in the Algerian Muslim judiciary, especially as reflected in their responses to questions of law posed by the French in three areas where the French felt that they had grounds for criticizing Islamic practices: slavery, the position of women, and the treatment of orphans. Their responses belie the allegation often made by the colons that all Al­ gerian religious leaders were uncompromisingly conservative. It will also be shown that the French themselves often failed to back up those changes which were suggested, and that they were more con­ cerned with promoting stability than with working for change. Chapters 5 and 6 deal in chronological fashion with events during the years 1854 to 1869, based on records of the military administra­ tion and the records of debates in advisory councils at the provincial level (the Conseils Generaux). Because detailed records are available for the local and regional levels, it is possible to focus quite effectively here on the impact of changes introduced by the colonial regime, particularly in terms of the social and political tensions in which they resulted. Chapter 5 treats the crisis in the appeals courts in the West, for which the ground was laid in the study of the Mascara majlis in Chapter 2. It shows how French opponents of an independent Mus­ lim judicial system were able to capitalize on the crisis within the appeals courts to push through their dissolution. Chapter 6 explains how the dissolution of the majlis contributed to resentments which fueled a rebellion in 1864-1865. It then examines how, in the wake of this rebellion, the 'ulama pressed their case for a return to greater autonomy in judicial and educational affairs. The result was a tem­ porary concession on this question, combined with a very thorough­ going bureaucratization of the system. The impact of bureaucratization is examined in Chapter 7, where we begin by looking quantitatively at the patterns of recruitment and promotion. Here again we find a clear difference between the Constantinois and the rest of Algeria, for in the former there was a greater degree of both upward and geographic mobility. This will be seen to have importance in Chapter 8, when we discuss political mobili­ zation in the Constantinois. We also take a qualitative look at the Muslim judicial officials, through portraits of some of the most distinctive groups, the details\n\nINTRODUCTION | 27\n\nof which are drawn from the personnel files of the colonial admin­ istration, and from biographical material in Arabic. In Chapters 8 and 9, we return to a chronological approach, and we enter a period for which the sources are more uneven and more diverse. On the administrative side, one no longer finds the contin­ uing records of correspondence which served as the foundation for Chapters 5 and 6. Rather, we find files on particular incidents, and, in one critical case, the Constantine riots of 1887, only newspaper reports. One also begins to find a good deal more published material in Arabic and French, written by Algerian Muslims. This is a period of decline in central administration control, and of growing cultural and political assertiveness on the part of the Algerian Muslims. Chapter 8 is concerned with the Muslim courts as a political ques­ tion in the 1880s, and the interlinked questions of political rights and conscription. It looks at the mobilization of the notables in the Constantinois in response to the colons' attacks on the courts, and it considers the political position of the qadi and the notables in the Algerian colonial town. Chapter 9, covering from 1892 up to World War I, describes the final stages in the building of the official Islamic establishment in Algeria, as the French added on an intellectual and religious wing modeled on the lines of the judicial one. At the outset of this project, there was hope among Algerian Muslim leaders that this might prove the occasion for a sincere dialogue between the French and the Al­ gerian Muslims, but this hope was to be sorely disappointed. The hollowness of dialogue was illustrated by the commission for the codification of Islamic law, composed mainly of French Islamic law specialists. This code was to be the final crown for the rationalized Islamic legal system, but it was a crown which was never to be for­ mally put in place. Even twenty years after independence, the codi­ fication of family law remains a somehow intractable problem in Algeria. In observing the construction of the official Islamic establishment, one learns a great deal about Algerian society, and about the nature of the French colonial state. But to fully understand its historical importance, and to bring its principal features out in relief, one needs to look at it in a long-term and comparative perspective. This will be the task of the conclusion.\n\nChapter 1\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND THE LINES OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE\n\nTo provide the foundations for this study, we need to begin by look­ ing at the pattern of relationships between Muslim religious leaders and the state in Algeria, and then to consider how these were related to the working of judicial institutions in the precolonial period, and to outhne how they will affect the main lines of institutional change in the colonial period. In the first part of this task, we will be con­ cerned with the unity of the system, or the lack thereof, and with the autonomy of religious leaders within it. In the introduction, a distinction was made between two levels at which religious unification can take place: that of baraka, or divine grace, and that of the shari'a, the religious law. Sharifian genealogies, tracing descent from the Prophet, are the element which permits uni­ fication at the level of baraka. This unification can take place under the control of a ruler, as was the case in sharifian Morocco, or it can be independent from him, and in opposition to him, when groups claim sharifian status on their own, and gain independent recognition for it in a local base. Baraka can also be fragmented, divided among a multitude of local saints and their descendants, called marabouts, who work out their relationship with the ruler individually. Unity at the level of the shari'a is embodied in the Muslim judicial system, where the ruler has some control, through the appointment of judges, but where the religious scholars, who are the final arbiters of the shari'a, exercise a degree of autonomy. To understand the differing patterns of religious leadership in Al­ geria, and how they affected judicial affairs, we need to begin by looking at the geographical foundations.\n\n1.1\n\nCONTRASTS BETWEEN EASTERN AND WESTERN ALGERIA\n\nThere is a saying in North Africa that Tunisia is a lamb, Algeria is a wolf, and Morocco is a lion. This conveys well the sense in which Algeria is a transitional zone between its two more easily character-\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT | 29\n\nized neighbors. The great empires of medieval North Africa had their centers of gravity in the plains of Morocco and along the coast of Tunisia. Algeria tended to be a zone of rivalry between these centers. When smaller political units emerged in the thirteenth century, they divided Algeria between East and West.1 It was only with the arrival of the Ottomans in the second decade of the sixteenth century, and the building of Algiers into a wellfortified port, that Algeria began to emerge as a unified polity, with its present eastern and western frontiers. But even after three centu­ ries of unity, there remained important differences in social patterns between East and West. This should not be seen exclusively as a matter of Moroccan and Tunisian influence, for there were important geographical, ecological, and economic factors which help to explain it. One can find in mid-nineteenth-century administrative reports ref­ erences to the \"theocratic\" West and the \"secular\" East of Algeria. Read in context, what these terms convey is the dominance of sharifian aristocracies in the West, and the dominance of urban influence in the East.2 Material factors help to explain this, but do not provide a complete explanation. It must be made clear to begin with that the frame of reference for this study is northern Algeria, a region known as the Tell, a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast some 1,100 kilometers long, and varying in width from 350 to 400 kilometers. The central area, around the city of Algiers, is dominated by the Kabylia massif, whose people speak a Berber dialect. The Kabyles were notoriously recalcitrant to central government control and, though they were strong Muslims, they followed their own customary law. The French con­ tinued this policy by not naming qadis to the Kabylia, and for this reason it will not have a significant place in this study. Our attention will be concentrated on the West—roughly from the region of Miliana to the Moroccan frontier—and the East, from Setif to the Tu­ nisian frontier. An important area of contrast is relief. The East is more moun­ tainous than the West, and the Eastern mountains are higher. The natural corollary of this is that the East gets more rain, and that it is more heavily forested. In 1929, of 435,000 hectares officially classified 1 For a summary of this period, see Tamil Abun Nasr, A History of the Maghrib, Cambridge, 1971. 2 This distinction is developed by Augustin Berque in \"Esquisse d'une histoire de la seigneurie Algerienne,\" Revue de la Mediterranee, 7 (1949), pp. 206-302, and 415-429.\n\n30 I CHAPTER ONE\n\nas forest, 417,000 or 95 percent was in Eastern Algeria, the most important area being the cork oak forests in the littoral massifs.3 The key factor in the West is irrigation. For the precolonial West was dominated by two cities which depended to a large extent on irrigated agriculture. These two cities, Tlemcen and Mascara, occupy similar ecological niches, facing the mountains on one side, and small but fertile plains on the other.4 In the colonial period, the French carried out extensive dam building and irrigation projects in the West, especially in the valleys of the Chelif and the Mina, and they estab­ lished prosperous colonial agricultural centers in the regions of Sidi Bel Abbes and Orleansville.5 Annie Rey-Goldziguer, in her thesis on the disagregation of tra­ ditional Algerian society in the 1860s, links the relative strengths and weaknesses of rural resistance to geographical characteristics. The in­ terior irrigated plains of the West lent themselves well to urban-based economic exploitation. This intensive parasitic exploitation seriously undermined the cohesion of rural communities in the West, while in the East, with its densely populated mountain refuges, the Algerian character remained intact, the communities cohesive. Hence Eastern Algeria was better able to resist the colonial intrusion.6 I would like to suggest a somewhat different reading of the data, stressing the dominance, in the East, of a single city. Constantine does not rely on intensive irrigation. As one looks out over the city walls, even today, one sees dry, monotonous, rolling hills. It is per­ haps this very lack of an easily exploitable base which led the inhab­ itants of Constantine to spread their economic runners far and wide into the mountains and desert. The industries of precolonial iClonstantine—most importantly tan­ ning—drew labor and primary products from widely scattered points in the hinterland. And, during the prosperous reign of Salah Bey, in the late eighteenth century, government-sponsored construction projects attracted a sizeable contingent of laborers from the country­ side. It was not only workers who were drawn to the city, but also scholars, who came to study and teach in the madrasas, or to enter 3 For general coverage of Algerian geography, see Augustin Bernard, L'Algerie, Paris, 1929. 4 Annie Rey-Goldziguer, \"Royaume Arabe et desagregation des societes traditionnelles en Algerie,\" unpublished dissertation, University of Paris, 1974, p. 66.

In short, while the Constantine beylik squeezed resources out of its subjects, it did so in ways which created a wide network of bonds of interdependence, economic and political and cultural, be­ tween the provincial capital and its hinterland. By contrast, the West is made up of semi-isolated cogs—Miliana, Tlemcen, Mascara, and Oran—and one could argue for adding to this group Algiers and Medea. In the Western beylik, the separate cogs competed for regional supremacy, but none ever achieved it. Further, the Ottoman hold over the mountain regions of the West— the Dahra and the Ouarsenis—and over the desert of the South Oranais, seems to have been more tenuous than Constantine's hold over the Petite Kabylie and the oases of Biskra and the Souf.7 In the sphere of relationships between politics and religion, the critical factor in the West lay in the emergence of sharifian aristocra­ cies during the Ottoman period, a subject on which I will elaborate in Chapter 2. They arose in the intensively cultivated plains around Tlemcen and Mascara. One factor in this was doubtless the easy availability of an agricultural surplus. But politics was also a critical factor, since these groups' assertion of a claim to sharifian genealogy contained an implicit challenge to the authority of the Ottoman state.8 In the East, the situation was simpler and more symmetrical, with the lines of political and religious authority radiating out from the capital city of Constantine. Too, in the East, there tended to be a clear distinction between political and religious leadership whereas, in the West, the aggressive sharifs of Mascara tried to combine po­ litical and religious roles in the Moroccan manner. It may have been a factor of considerable importance that foreign trade flourished in the East, under the monopoly of the state, since this helped to make the capital a center of both economic and religious attraction.9 The strength of sharifian aristocracies around the principal urban 7 There was a major revolt launched from the Petite Kabylie in 1803, but there was not the sort of chronic rebellion faced by the Oranais beys in the early nineteenth century. The best demonstration of the close urban-rural ties which existed in the East lies in the temporary migration from both the mountains and the desert to Constan­ tine. 8 The relationship between the importance of religious leadership and the severity of disputes over power is suggested by Fanny Colonna in \"Saints furieux et saints studieux,\" Annates, Economies, societes, civilisations, 35 (1980), p. 650; and also in Peter von Sivers, \"The Realm of Justice: Apocalyptic Revolts in Algeria (1849-1879),\" Humaniora Islamica, 1, 1973, pp. 47-60. 9 P.

One was that there was not a strongly established order of 'ulama, as there was in Constantine, although in the last decades of Ottoman rule, after the recapture of Oran from the Spanish, there was an effort to build one up.10 The second is that there was no pole of attraction like Constan­ tine which could draw independent marabouts into the political and religious mainstream. As a result, these men, in the poorer mountain and desert areas, were more concerned with establishing their own independent bases of power, and building up alliances through Sufi tariqas. This was the source of major rebellions led by the Darqawa and Tijaniyya brotherhoods against Ottoman rule in the late eight­ eenth century and early nineteenth century.11\n\nThe Precolonial State and Religious Education\n\nAn important illustration of these patterns lies in the role of the Ot­ toman state in educational affairs. The period of greatest prosperity in the late Ottoman era coincided with the reign of Salah Bey of Constantine (1771-1791), who was able effectively to consolidate the state trading monopoly, and who carried out a number of ambitious projects, from building schools and mosques, to encouraging the construction of water-powered mills, to draining swamps in the plain of Bone. He was very much the enlightened despot of the eighteenth century, in a distinctively North African style.12 The Turks never came to dominate quite so effectively the Western beylik. The most serious problem was that the region's major port, Oran, was under Spanish occupation until 1792. And the Oranais had fewer prospects for trade at this time than the better-watered East. While their capital was at Mascara, from 1701 unt"
