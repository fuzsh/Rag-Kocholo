        "text": "This article discusses Hayreddin Barbarossa's conquest of Tunis in 1534 in the light of the chronicles written by contemporary Ottoman historiographers and those of the late sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries. The aim is to understand how Ottoman chronicles handled the question of the sultan's involvement in the conquest of Tunis since the accounts offered by the chronicles changed radically in the course of time. Some sources indicated that there existed Sultan's authorization/approval behind the conquest whereas some were shy of associating the conquest with the sultan. This uncertainty is also reflected in the modern historiographical approach to the conquest of Tunis. It is interpreted either as part of Süleyman's preconceived plans or as Barbarossa's unauthorized seizing upon an opportunity. By drawing on a comparison of several Ottoman sources, this article analyses the factors that might have influenced the historiographers' contradictory accounts and tries to provide a more accurate picture of the 1534 campaign.\n\nTunisia is often portrayed as the exception of the Arab World, as the only country going through a transition toward democracy. However, few analysts predicted the fall of an authoritarian regime that seemed so well entrenched. As in other contexts, the role of the army àçiwas crucial in the outcome of the revolution: would it prop up the regime or opt to back the uprisings? During the Ben Ali period, the Tunisian armed forces were the smallest in North Africa, numbering around 40.000 to 43.000 troops including the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. Except for emergency relief and public works projects in remote areas1 and participation in peacekeeping operations, the army's main task was external defence. In this sense, the Tunisian armed forces were not a pillar of the former authoritarian regime, even though they respected the norms of submission to civilian authorities, even in times of political crisis. Most studies analysing the role of the army during the revolution use the cost-benefit approach to explain the decision of the Tunisias chief of staff at the time, Rachid Ammar, not to engage in repression and the rejection of the preservation of the status quo. According to them, the marginalization of the armed forces during Ben Ali's rule explains the refusal of Rachid Ammar to obey the president's order to use violence on demonstrators. These theses were, at least partly, refuted once it became clear that Ben Ali never issued such an order, leading us to try to find other ways to analyse the army's behaviour than the rational choice theory. Instead of defecting, I defend the thesis that the Tunisian army acted as a highly-professionalized force during the revolution, bound by institutionalized norms and practices. I challenge the assumption of the army as a marginalized force, rather, my argument is that the Tunisian military was kept out of politics which allowed the military sector to become autonomous and pursue its professionalization without political interference. Because the army never was the backbone of the Tunisian authoritarian regime, the military did not have to engage in repression in case of social mobilizations against the regime2 and had a different role than the one of the police."
