This course examines the history of that region from the dawn of Islam, in 622, until the final end of the Ottoman Caliphate, in 1924. By looking at some of the most important events that took place during this period, this course not only reveals a series of occurrences but explains how these events shaped the region’s political, military, social, and religious history. Each of these stories also introduces us to a fascinating cast of people and places, many of which remain of enduring importance. Like history the world over, the history of the Middle East is often seen solely through the lens of violent conflict, but as this course will make clear, the region’s history is much more vibrant and nuanced than this. As well as looking at those conflicts which have shaped the region’s religious, political, and social makeup, we will also consider a much broader selection of events to provide a more balanced picture of the Middle East’s history. Many of the turning points in this course might come as a surprise, such as the pilgrimage made by the richest man who ever lived, Mansa Musa, who journeyed from his kingdom in the Sahara to Cairo and Mecca, then back again. Another character we’ll meet is Fatima al-Fihri, a wealthy widow from Tunisia who lived in Morocco. Although not a household name, she deserves to be: She was the woman who established the world’s first university, in the city of Fes, two centuries before a similar establishment was created in Europe. We will also meet some more familiar faces, including Richard the Lionheart and Saladin from the period of the Crusades. During this era, we’ll consider both the crusaders’ conquest of Jerusalem, in 1099, and the city’s recapture by Saladin’s Muslim army a century later.\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n1\n\nThere are also numerous periods of greater peace, prosperity, and progress, as we will see. Among them is the flourishing of Cordoba, in Spain, when Muslim monarchs eagerly employed the best available talents, regardless of whether they were Muslim, Jewish, or Christian. The fall of Granada in 1492 marked the end of almost 700 years of Muslim rule in much of that part of Andalusia. When we learn about this event, we will see how events in the Muslim Middle East have, and continue to have, more long-term and wide-reaching impact than is first obvious. Other great cities this course visits include Baghdad and Cairo. In both of these cases we will discover why they were founded when they were, why, by whom, and what impact these foundational moments had both then and for centuries to come. Together, this course’s 36 lectures offer a comprehensive survey of 1,300 years of Middle Eastern history, reaching up to the early 20th century. That period included the discovery of oil, the dramatic Arab Revolt led by Lawrence of Arabia during World War I, and the postwar peace settlements that created the modern Middle East out of the pieces of a shattered Ottoman Empire. ■\n\n2\n\nScope\n\nMuslim Empires: Land, Language, Religion\n\nLecture\n\n1\n\nB\n\nasic relationships are central to stories about even the biggest names in history. Each event turns on the capacities and limitations of human beings, and so they may be expressed in relationships—some of which worked very well, and some that went badly. This lecture examines one set of relationships—the Saud-Wahhab pact—which shows how the past informs the present. The lecture also defines what exactly the Middle East is for the purposes of this course, and identifies themes and characters which will guide it. Language and Countries ■■ This course will explore a 1400-year period from the rise of Islam—and the life of Muhammad, Islam’s most important prophet—to the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and the end of the last caliphate in Islamic history. ■■\n\nA caliph can be understood as Muhammad’s earthly successor, and the caliph’s domain—or caliphate—was intended to combine the Muslim political and spiritual realms under his sole authority.\n\n■■\n\nIn Islamic history—from the moment Muhammad died, and his successor was chosen, in 632 AD—some political entity in the Muslim Middle East always laid claim to that title, until shortly after World War I. Matters are very different today, for reasons that’ll become clear as we move through the course. Consequently, no contemporary group has much success claiming the title (which doesn’t mean that they won’t try).\n\n■■\n\nThe point here is that language—and how we use it—matters, as we see from the continuing relevance of a word such as caliphate.\n\n■■\n\nAnother important term is the Greater Middle East. Although this geo-political identifier only recently has come into our lexicon, it Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n3\n\nCairo, Egypt\n\nis useful in describing a loose geographical area. By referring to the Greater Middle East, we’re signalling that in addition to covering the Arabic-speaking countries of the Middle East, we’re also going to take into account Turkey and Iran (or Persia), as they relate to the Arabic-speaking countries of the region.\n\n4\n\n■■\n\nTurkey and Iran transact life and politics in languages other than Arabic, principally. They have distinct cultural traditions of their own. But they also share a great deal of common cultural and religious heritage with the Arabic-speaking world.\n\n■■\n\nThe Middle East in this course will include North Africa from Morocco to Egypt; as well as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria; and the whole Arabian Peninsula, from Kuwait in the north to Oman and Yemen in the south. It will include Jerusalem, but not the post–World War II state of Israel, as the tale before us will end just after World War I.\n\nLecture 1 │ Muslim Empires: Land, Language, Religion\n\nTurning Points ■■ What kinds of turning points will we be looking at in the history of the Middle East? The answer is: exactly the same sort of things you’d expect to find in a study of any other part of the world. In other words, it’s the history of humanity in a particular geographical location, over a certain period of time. And there are plenty of surprises, including the story of the richest man who ever lived. We’ll see war and peace, and everything in between. We’ll witness invasions and conquests. And we will examine the social and intellectual flowering coincident with scholarship and tolerance. ■■\n\nWe’ll see manifestations of genius and humanity at its best, as well as displays of human folly, ignorance, and stupidity. To highlight a couple of watershed events, we will revisit, in detail, the sack of Baghdad, in 1258, by an invading Mongol horde. We will also study the French invasion and conquest of Algeria, which began in 1830.\n\n■■\n\nWe’re also going to consider such turning points as the foundation of Cairo, by the Fatimids, in 969. Among the lessknown episodes that upturned the Middle East and the West alike, we will highlight the Battle of Talas. It is the one time in history that Arab and Chinese military forces met in battle. One unintended result of this hostility—fought in 751, on the border between their empires—was the transfer of paper-making technology from China to the Middle East, and then from there into Muslim Spain, and on through Europe.\n\n■■\n\nMoving from events to individuals, we’re likewise going to come across familiar faces, including such men of action as Muhammad, Saladin, Suleiman the Magnificent, and Lawrence of Arabia.\n\n■■\n\nBut it’s not just men of action who make a mark in history; thinkers too have an indispensable role to play. In this group, we will meet al-Ghazali, who lived in the 11th century, and whose Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n5\n\nimportance to Islamic theology is substantial. And although men dominate the headlines of early history, we’re also going to meet a woman by the name of Fatima al-Fihri, who had the vision, and the financial means, to found the world’s first university\n\n6\n\n■■\n\nAnother favourite character from world history is the 14th-century scholar Ibn Khaldun, from the city of Tunis. While there have been any number of brilliant scholars in history, few may lay claim—as Ibn Khaldun can—to pouring the intellectual foundations for least four different disciplines of learning: sociology, historiography, modern economics, and demography.\n\n■■\n\nIbn Khaldun trained his mind to recognise turning points, so much so that he charted three such moments in his own lifetime: the Mongol invasions, in the 1250s; the Black Death, which struck Europe and the Middle East in the 1340s; and the rising power of European states in the 14th century.\n\n■■\n\nReligion is a defining theme in many of the turning points in this course. Judaism and Christianity brought monotheism—the belief in one God—to the forefront hundreds of years before Muhammad. But with Islam, Muhammad united and transformed a people into a religious empire that today is the world’s second largest faith, representing 1.5 billion people. His language, Arabic, became another unifying force for the religion and the region.\n\n■■\n\nAnother defining theme is the idea of empire, or at least of territory. Piece by piece, the Muslim faith and its predominant language transformed continents (and the peoples who inhabited them) into a more unified force and face. Even with the demise of the Ottoman caliphate after the First World War, we see a continuing transformation of many of these properties into modern Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other modern states in the Middle East.\n\nLecture 1 │ Muslim Empires: Land, Language, Religion\n\nThe Saud-Wahhab Pact ■■ The past informs the present. Ibn Khaldun himself said, “The past resembles the future more closely than one drop of water resembles another.” Another of Ibn Khaldun’s big ideas was about how dynasties and empires rise and fall over time. ■■\n\nThis leads us to the story of the Saud-Wahhab pact of 1744. The story starts in a remote corner of the Arabian Peninsula, at the happy wedding of a young couple, which involved two families from unremarkable, out-of-the-way villages.\n\n■■\n\nOne family was led by minor chieftains, who ruled a small oasis. At the head of the other family was a radical religious reformer who had already been expelled from own village, for stirring up trouble.\n\n■■\n\nWhile the couple was uniting in matrimony, the wedding also marked a political pact that fused two families. The minor local ruler is named Muhammad ibn Saud, and the controversial religious reformer is Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab.\n\n■■\n\nExamples of marriage contracts between ambitious and prominent families are found throughout history. The hope of each family is that it will prosper, and grow stronger, through the common bond. In our example, that’s exactly what happened. □□\n\nIbn Saud was keen to increase his political reach in Arabia, and saw the potential in protecting—and working with—the missionary zeal of this religiously conservative Muslim preacher.\n\n□□\n\nAt the same time, ‘Abd al-Wahhab, in criticising everyone around him for not being religious enough, had made enough enemies that he needed sanctuary—the very refuge Ibn Saud could offer him.\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n7\n\n□□\n\nThe two men agreed that the Saud family would help promote al-Wahhab’s religious reforms, and that ‘Abd alWahhab would support the Sauds’ dream of conquering Arabia, thereby legitimising each other’s ambition. Today’s Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—and the Sunni line of Muslim faith known as Wahhabism—demonstrates the strength of this alliance, which persisted through good times and bad.\n\n■■\n\nIn terms of political governance, the central point of the SaudWahhab agreement was the combination of political and religious institutions into a single ruling body, to be headed by a king. These state leaders would come from the Saud side of the family. But in religious terms, the union meant the promotion of ‘Abd al-Wahhab’s own view of Islam. As it happens, that line is one the most uncompromising—least tolerant—forms of the Muslim faith.\n\n■■\n\nWhile contemporary Saudi Arabia represents a very conservative society, by and large, it’s important to note that only about 23 percent of the native population ascribe to the ultra-conservative, Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.\n\nCycles ■■ Petroleum wealth changed not only Saudi Arabia and the Greater Middle East, but also the entire world around it. The global oil shock, in 1973, was among of the first external signs of this transformation, followed by wars in Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and elsewhere.\n\n8\n\n■■\n\nThe promotion of religious intolerance against the backdrop of concentrated wealth and shallow political institutions has done a great deal to propagate much of the violence we see in the region today. It is an example neither perpetrated by, nor even supported by, anything like the majority of Muslims.\n\n■■\n\nThe net result of such polarization is the emergence of terrorism, carried out in the name of Islam. As we’ll see, when we explore Lecture 1 │ Muslim Empires: Land, Language, Religion\n\nthe Crusades—and several intra-Muslim wars—religiously inspired violence isn’t a new phenomenon. Nor is it by any means limited to the Middle East. But hopefully this shadow will pass. ■■\n\nDuring Ibn Khaldun’s lifetime, in the 14th and early 15th century, it took just three generations for a new power to emerge on the fringes of an old empire, then reach its apogee, and begin its almost inevitable decline. That is just one of many stories, and cycles, we will examine in this course.\n\n■■\n\nSome time after the relatively recent discovery of large oil reserves in Dubai, in 1966, the Emir Rashid bin Sa’id al-Maktoum was asked for his views on the country’s unexpected financial windfall. He offered the following thought: “My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I drive a Mercedes, my son drives a Land Rover, his son will drive a Land Rover, but his son will ride a camel.”\n\nSuggested Reading Gearon, The Sahara.

Although the dawn of Islam in the Middle East brought about many profound and lasting changes across the region, is it perhaps more accurate to think of history since Islam, rather than Islamic history?\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n9\n\n2. How much of the history of the Middle East has been driven by\n\nindividuals versus more impersonal factors, such as sudden fluctuations in population, internal or external economic factors, or resource insecurity in a typically arid or semi-arid environment?\n\n10\n\nLecture 1 │ Muslim Empires: Land, Language, Religion\n\nMuhammad and the Dawn of Islam—622\n\nLecture\n\n2\n\nT\n\nhe subject of this lecture is the dawn of Islam—Muhammad’s first revelation—and the events that followed during the remainder of his lifetime. In any discussion of the 1,400 years of Islamic and Middle Eastern history, Muhammad’s first revelation is peerless—a turning point among turning points. Without Muhammad’s account of his mysterious revelation in a mountain cave, there would have been no prophetic mission, no preaching to the masses, no converts, no Islam, and an impossible-to-imagine alteration in global history, from that moment until the present day. Muhammad’s Life ■■ Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca in or around the year 570. He lived in Mecca for the first 52 years of his life, according to most sources. Because of the central importance of certain divinely inspired revelations to the story of Muhammad’s life, this first chapter is often divided into the years before his first revelation, when he was 40, and the dozen years following the first revelation. After that, he fled Mecca for Medina, 200 miles to the north. He was based there for the last 10 years of his life. ■■\n\nMuhammad’s father died before he was born, and his mother passed away when he was about six. Consequently, the youth was raised for the most part by a paternal uncle, Abu Talib. Abu Talib was a successful merchant and the head of the Banu Hisham clan, which was part of the larger Quraysh tribe.\n\n■■\n\nOnce Muhammad was old enough, probably about 13 years of age, he started to work for his uncle, and accompanied him on trading trips to different parts of Arabia.\n\n■■\n\nBefore Muhammad, Arabia was primarily a polytheistic society. Although there were Jews, Christians, and some indigenous Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n11\n\nKaaba in Mecca\n\n12\n\nLecture | Muhammad and the Dawn of Islam—622\n\nArab monotheists, the majority of locals worshipped one or more of hundreds of local, tribal and regional deities. ■■\n\nMuhammad’s message of monotheism was a challenge not only to the local religious beliefs that predominated on the Arabian Peninsula, but also to the economic basis of the locals who attended to them.\n\n■■\n\nMecca was an important pre-Islamic destination of religious pilgrims, or those who travel to sacred places for religious reasons. The kaaba, a large black cuboid, was the pilgrims’ final destination in the center of Mecca. Muhammad was the member of a tribe, the Quraysh, that was responsible for protecting the kaaba in Mecca, an important center of polytheistic pilgrimage.\n\n■■\n\nHowever, after Muhammad converted Arabia to Islam, he ordered destroyed the 360 statues of idols housed in the kaaba. It was then co-opted—or adopted—as Islam’s physical focal point on earth.\n\nMuhammad’s First Revelation ■■ In the year 610, Muhammad received his first revelation. Forty years old, and happily married to a successful businesswoman named Khadija, Muhammad was already in the habit of walking out from the city, to spend nights alone in contemplation— meditating in a small cave on a mountain just outside of the city. ■■\n\nGebel an-Nour—or the Mountain of Light—is a prominent peak, about three miles from the center of Mecca. Muhammad would rest in a small cave on the side of the mountain. It was there, according to the tradition, that the Angel Gabriel appeared to him.\n\n■■\n\nMoses is said to have spent 40 days and nights on Mount Sinai before encountering God and receiving the Ten Commandments. In the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions, both Elijah and Jesus spent 40 fasting in the wilderness. In the Muslim Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n13\n\ntradition, Muhammad also spent 40 days alone, fasting and in contemplation, before he received the first of the prophetic revelations that eventually would comprise the Quran, Islam’s holy book. ■■\n\nThe first word that Gabriel is said to utter is Iqra, which means “read” or “recite.” Muhammad replies that he’s unable to read, at which Gabriel grabs hold of Muhammad and again orders Muhammad to read, saying: “Read: in the name of thy Lord Who created, Created man from a clot. Read: and thy Lord is the most Generous, Who taught by the pen, Taught man that which he knew not.”\n\n■■\n\nReturning from the mountain, Muhammad spoke to his wife Khadija. As the first person to hear and believe Muhammad’s message—and to accept him as prophet—Khadija is recognized as the first Muslim convert. For that, she maintains a special place in Islam.\n\n■■\n\nMost traditions agree that Muhammad didn’t receive another visitation from Gabriel for three more years, during which time he became depressed and worried about what might happen next.\n\n■■\n\nBut then Muhammad received his second revelation, and shortly thereafter he started to publicly preach his message of monotheism, including the urgent need for people to mend their ways, to repent, and to submit to the will of God. The oneness of God is absolutely central to Islam, as is the idea of subordinating themselves to God’s will. The Arabic word for submission is Islam.\n\nMuhammad’s Enemies ■■ Muhammad attracted very few converts in the first years of his preaching Islam. Nevertheless, he did make plenty of enemies, including from his own tribe and those of other\n\n14\n\nLecture 2 │ Muhammad and the Dawn of Islam—622\n\nprominent merchant families, who relied on pilgrims for much of their income. ■■\n\nTraditionally, in pre-Islamic Arabian culture, retribution in a blood feud could be extended to any family member, which, for practical purposes, extended to any member of the extended clan. Once started, blood feuds could easily get out of control, and often lasted for generations.\n\n■■\n\nDespite the offenses Muhammad provoked, he remained more or less safe from physical attacks, because he was still a member of the powerful Banu Hashim clan. And so long as his uncle, Abu Talib, was head of the clan, Muhammad’s guardian protected him from fellow tribesmen and others, and urged them to forgive the errant nephew’s religious zeal.\n\n■■\n\nSuch protection was good only up to a point. In the year 619, Abu Talib died, as did Muhammad’s beloved wife and confidant, Khadija. Ominously for Muhammad, leadership of the clan passed to Abu Lahab, one of Muhammad’s paternal uncles. An implacable foe of Muhammad, Abu Lahab withdrew the clan’s protection.\n\n■■\n\nNow if an enemy now killed Muhammad, it would not lead to a blood feud. Abu Lahab was opening the door for Muhammad’s murder. And so, after 12 years of contentious preaching in Mecca, word reached Muhammad that he was the subject of an assassination plot.\n\nMuhammad’s Flight ■■ The conspiracy to kill Muhammad brings us to the flight of Muhammad and his Muslim faithful away from Mecca and away from danger. During the pilgrimage season, Muhammad met with a group of men from Yathrib, an oasis town 200 miles north of Mecca.\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n15\n\n16\n\n■■\n\nLater, Yathrib would be renamed The City of the Prophet—or Medina an-Nabi—in Muhammad’s honour. Over time, the words of the prophet were dropped from common usage, which is why today it’s simply called Medina.\n\n■■\n\nIn June 622, Muhammad departed Mecca in the dead of night. This moment of exodus, or hijra in Arabic, marks the start of the Islamic calendar; the birth of a new religion; and a radical upheaval of the entire region’s existing political order.\n\n■■\n\nEven after he became safely settled in Medina, Muhammad remained an outsider. Under certain circumstances, this could be a disadvantage. But it was useful in Medina, as it meant he was called on to settle disputes in which he had no personal stake.\n\n■■\n\nAs he came to be trusted by the heads of all the major tribes in Medina, Muhammad’s arbitration skills marked the start of his political leadership there, soon to be formalized in what became known as the Constitution of Medina.\n\n■■\n\nApart from creating an alliance between the main Medina tribes for the first time, the constitution offered specific protections to the “people of the book,” which is to say Jews and Christians.\n\n■■\n\nMeanwhile, the Meccan authorities—having been thwarted in their goal of killing Muhammad—seized all property and possessions of the Muslims who’d fled the city.\n\n■■\n\nNow living in exile, penniless, and without other means of financial recourse, they started launching armed raids against the pilgrim caravans en route to Mecca. Looting the caravans obviously enraged the Meccan authorities and harmed their economy. Open warfare broke out.\n\n■■\n\nA turning point in this armed conflict occurred at the Battle of Badr in March 624. In the traditional account of the battle, about Lecture 2 │ Muhammad and the Dawn of Islam—622\n\n300 Muslims fought a Meccan army of almost 1,000 adversaries. In spite of being outnumbered by more than 3 to 1, the Muslims won an easy victory, and killed many of the Meccan leaders in the process. ■■\n\nTaking this victory as evidence of God’s favor shining on them, the Muslims found their reputations greatly enhanced. They attracted many new followers, and secured their positions in Medina.\n\n■■\n\nThe Muslims weren’t always so lucky, however. In coming years, they suffered a number of military defeats at the hands of the Meccans.\n\nMuhammad, 630–632 ■■ Eventually, in 630, Muhammad decided that his army had grown strong enough to risk an all-out attack against his former hometown of Mecca. It’s said that Muhammad now led some 10,000 people. ■■\n\nThe Muslims easily routed the enemy upon arriving at Mecca. Resistance was somewhat muted, and the city surrendered with little bloodshed.\n\n■■\n\nWith the new religious and political Muslim entity firmly in charge—and Muhammad at its head—most of the city accepted the new order, not least because of the amnesty the prophet extended to his erstwhile enemies.\n\n■■\n\nIn 632—10 years after he had first fled from Mecca to Medina—Muhammad performed what’s properly considered the first Islamic pilgrimage in the city of his birth. In this way, he established the religious obligation on all Muslims—their health and financial resources permitting—to perform the hajj, or “pilgrimage,” to Mecca, at least once in a lifetime.\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n17\n\n■■\n\nUpon performing the first hajj, Muhammad returned to Medina. Shortly afterward, he developed a fever and a headache—the result of a poisoning, according to many sources. After a few days of illness, Muhammad died on June 8, 632, at the age of 62.\n\nMuhammad as a Turning Point ■■ Muhammad’s mission brought about profound changes that make his life, particularly the last 22 years of it, a turning point that set in motion world change on an incalculable scale.\n\n18\n\n■■\n\nMuhammad’s message impacted the religious, political, and social life of the era he inhabited. It demonstrates his view that religion couldn’t be a private matter, removed from the real world in which people live and operate.\n\n■■\n\nIn political terms, virtually the entire Arabian Peninsula was united as a single political realm for the first time in its history, at the time of Muhammad’s death.\n\n■■\n\nIn societal terms, Muhammad’s introduction of the concept of personal accountability, superseding tribal law, was radical.\n\n■■\n\nExamples of practical changes that Muhammad, or the Quran, insisted on, are numerous. They include outlawing the practise of female infanticide, and providing women with legal rights, to property, to divorce, and to remarry. These rights were far in advance of those enjoyed in most of the world during the 7th century. As the historian Bernard Lewis has written, Islam “denounced aristocratic privilege, rejected hierarchy, and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents.”\n\n■■\n\nIn religious terms, polytheism had all but disappeared from the Arabian Peninsula by the time of Muhammad’s death.\n\nLecture 2 │ Muhammad and the Dawn of Islam—622\n\nSuggested Reading Armstrong, Muhammad.

Starting in 639, Arab armies would conquer the whole of North Africa in just 70 years, and institute a new order such as the region had never seen before. This conquest, from the Red Sea to the Atlantic, was more widespread—and more complete—than anything achieved by previous invaders. The changes were permanent. Setting the Stage for Invasion ■■ It was in 639 that the Arabs invaded North Africa. In the eastern Mediterranean region, a decades-long war between two of the ancient world’s superpowers—the Eastern Roman Empire of Byzantium and the Persian Sassanian Empire—had left each side exhausted, impoverished, and disorganized.\n\n20\n\n■■\n\nPeriodic outbreaks of bubonic plague and divisive succession battles further weakened these empires. The timing couldn’t have been better for the emergence of a new conquering force, especially one coming out of the city-free—and thus plaguefree—deserts of Arabia.\n\n■■\n\nMany of the Arabs’ earlier attacks were little more than armed raids designed to seize loot. These smash-and-grab runs were carried out by relatively small numbers of men, and made possible by the Arabs’ use of camels—which had evolved to live in desert places—as cavalry.\n\n■■\n\nBy the time we come to the Arab invasion of Egypt, we’re entering a new phase in the early history of the Arab Empire. This was the period when opportunistic raids were swapped for a more systematic, planned approach.\n\nLecture 3 │ Arab Invasion of North Africa—639\n\n■■\n\nAt the time, the Muslim Empire was led by its second caliph: Umar al-Khattab. Umar ruled for 10 years, from 634 to 644. Initially reluctant to risk an invasion of Byzantine Egypt, Umar was eventually persuaded to do so by his military governor in Palestine: Amr ibn al-‘As.\n\n■■\n\nBefore his conversion to Islam, Amr had been a trader who knew Egypt’s highways and byways, and, so, the best invasion route. Having previously won military victories in Palestine and the Levant, Amr persuaded Umar that now was the perfect moment to invade Egypt. Egypt was a great prize: the breadbasket of Byzantium.\n\nAmr’s Moves ■■ After Amr set out, Umar had second thoughts, and wrote to Amr ordering a halt. Umar believed that the 4,000-strong force he’d assembled was too small to be an effective invading army. Amr saw the caliph’s messenger galloping towards him just as he was approaching the Egyptian border at Rafah. Amr said he’d Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n21\n\nreview the message at the end of that day’s march, by which time he and his army would have crossed the Egyptian frontier.\n\n22\n\n■■\n\nWhile the caliph’s letter ordered Amr home, it also contained the following postscript, according to the Arab historian Ibn Abd alHakam: “If you receive this letter when you have already crossed into Egypt, then you may proceed. God will help you and I’ll send you any reinforcements you may need.” The wily Amr was free to push on, and execute his dream of conquering Egypt.\n\n■■\n\nAmr first took the fortified town of Pelusium, near the Egyptian coast, east of Port Said. The Arabs marched on to Babylon, a well-fortified town. After some initial skirmishing, Amr pulled back and sent a request to Umar for reinforcements. He got 8,000 extra men, many of them veterans from campaigning in Syria.\n\n■■\n\nNow, with a force-strength of 12,000, Amr launched a nighttime attack and, using siege ladders to scale the walls, routed the defenders. With no practical alternative, the general Cyrus handed over sovereignty of Egypt to the caliph Umar. But When Heraclius learned of Cyrus’s surrender, he was furious and refused to accept the terms.\n\n■■\n\nFaced with this, Amr had little choice but to march on Alexandria. The Arab army arrived in March 641, and set about laying siege to the walled city. Alexandria was heavily forified and could be supplied by sea, which was to the Byzantines’ advantage. But Heraclius died while preparing to lead a force in the defense of his city. The promised reinforcements melted away, and the garrison at Alexandria was left to its fate.\n\n■■\n\nThe defenders held out for six months until they were overwhelmed by the Arabs. The fall of Alexandria marked the end of any serious resistance to the Arabs invasion of Egypt.\n\nLecture 3 │ Arab Invasion of North Africa—639\n\nAfter the Capture ■■ Instead of putting the city’s defenders to the sword, Amr gave them a year during which they could leave—taking their possessions with them—or stay and live under the new political reality of Arab-Muslim rule. Amr deliberately kept in place the city’s tax collectors and other administrators. As these officials knew best how to run the city, it was a wise decision indeed. ■■\n\nIf Amr had his way, Alexandria would have remained the capital. The Caliph Umar thought otherwise, telling Amr that the city’s maritime setting made it vulnerable to future attack from Constantinople.\n\n■■\n\nLegend has it that before setting out for Alexandria, Amr found a bird nesting in his tent, and ordered that the bird. He ordered that it should be left undisturbed until its chicks had hatched and flown. Returning from Alexandria, Amr ordered that Egypt’s new capital would be founded where his tent stood.\n\n■■\n\nThe city of Fustat—whose name comes from an Arabic word for tent—continued to grow on the banks of the Nile. Nearly 1,400 years later, it’s still the center of Old Cairo.\n\n■■\n\nWith Egypt secured, Amr turned his attention to the west, and marched into Libya. Amr marched 1,000 miles along the southern Mediterranean coast, from Alexandria—via Barca— as far as Tripoli and Sabratha. And he took these cities with little effort.\n\n■■\n\nIn Barca he established a permanent base, appointing Uqba bin Nafi governor, before being relieved of his command and ordered to pull back to Fustat. This wasn’t conquest as such, but raiding on an extraordinary scale.\n\nFurther Raids and Invasions ■■ The first serious invasion of North Africa beyond Egypt’s borders was launched in 647 by the third caliph, Uthman. Uthman Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n23\n\ndispatched an army of 10,000 men—some sources say 20,000— from Fustat on a campaign that was to last 15 months.\n\n24\n\n■■\n\nUthman’s army moved rapidly through Libya and into southern Tunisia, where it easily defeated a Byzantine force. Afterwards, the Arabs fought the indigenous Berber tribes for loot, but for the next 20 years they did little to secure more land. Instead, they seemed content to limit their activities to profitable smash-andgrab raids.\n\n■■\n\nMeanwhile, away from North Africa, tensions were growing back in the center of the Arab world. The murders of Uthman in 656, and his successor Ali in 661, led to a war for the caliphate that was more pressing than the expansion of the Arabs’ empire in North Africa.\n\n■■\n\nHowever, once the new Umayyad caliph, Mu’awiya, had established himself in Damascus, he decided to consolidate and expand this empire. Mu’awiya appointed Uqba, a loyal Umayyad general and nephew of Amr ibn al-‘As, governor of all North Africa.\n\n■■\n\nUqba, with his deep knowledge of the region, was able to ensure that this second Arab invasion made rapid progress back across Libya, and into modern-day Tunisia—or Ifriqiya, as the Arabs knew the Roman province.\n\n■■\n\nWhen he got within 80 miles of Carthage, Uqba decided that he’d be in a stronger position if he had a permanent military base in the region. In 670, he founded the city of Kairouan on the site of an established camp and crossroads.\n\n■■\n\nFrom there, Uqba pressed on to his ultimate goal of Morocco. In Arabic, Morocco is called al-Maghreb, which simply means “the west.” As Uqba had said before he set out, he wanted to conquer lands that no Muslim had previously seen. Uqba reached Tangier\n\nLecture 3 │ Arab Invasion of North Africa—639\n\nbefore heading south and, crossing the Atlas Mountains, west to the coast. The Berbers ■■ It wasn’t until 694 that another Arab army—effectively the third Muslim invasion of North Africa—settled the question of who would control Ifriqiya. After decades of apparently ignoring the Byzantine presence in Carthage, the Arabs now attacked the city, expelling its denizens and razing its walls. ■■\n\nThe removal of Byzantine influence did not mark the end of opposition to Arab rule, however. For years, Berber revolts continued to trouble the Arabs. The Roman term of opprobrium for any non-Roman—barbarian—had now morphed into an Arabic proper name, creating a Berber identity that saw them as a united people.\n\n■■\n\nThe most serious Berber uprising started in the 680s, and was led by the legendary female warrior al-Kahina. Al-Kahina was likely a Jewish or Christian Berber. Through her desire to remain free of foreign domination, she inspired others in a series of ultimately doomed revolts.\n\n■■\n\nDescribed as a beauty with the gift of prophecy, Al-Kahina seemed to understand that her resistance movement would ultimately fail, as she gave her sons to her Arab enemies for safekeeping.\n\n■■\n\nAl-Kahina died fighting the Arabs in around 700, marking the end of organized Berber resistance. Ever since her death, al-Kahina has been adopted as an inspiration by an array of disparate groups, from Berber nationalists to Maghrebi feminists, Arab nationalists, and even French colonists.\n\nAfter the Invasions ■■ By this time the Arabs had conquered virtually the whole of North Africa. They proceeded to divide the region into the provinces Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n25\n\nof Egypt, Ifriqiya and the Maghreb, with provincial capitals at Fustat, Kairouan, and Fes, respectively. ■■\n\nIn time, they founded new provincial capitals that allowed them to securely rule over the much larger, native populations while living apart from them. In all three instances, those who selected these new capitals ignored earlier maritime bases, preferring instead the security of inland locations.\n\n■■\n\nArab forces took the city of Tangier in the spring of 710, completing the conquest of North Africa. In less than 70 years, the armies of Islam had now advanced from Egypt to Tangier. It was a remarkable feat, especially when one considers the harsh terrain they traversed.\n\nThe Consequences ■■ By and large, as the British-American historian Bernard Lewis put it, the conquered peoples of North Africa found “their new masters less demanding, more tolerant, and above all more welcoming than the old.” For one thing, the new Muslim overlords were far more religiously tolerant than had been the Byzantine emperor Heraclius.\n\n26\n\n■■\n\nWhere the reaction to the conquerors was not positive, it was often neutral. What did it matter to most peasants if they were ruled by an Arab, a Byzantine, or an Iranian?\n\n■■\n\nThe Arabs now ruled these lands but were usually happy to rely on locals to administer their new territorial gains. Indeed, Caliph Umar forbade Arabs from owning agricultural land in the newly conquered territories, insisting instead that they restrict themselves to living in the new military garrisons.\n\n■■\n\nBy the eighth century, however, these garrisons would themselves grow into cities, as the Arabs moved from occupiers to settlers. We see this in Fustat for Cairo, Qairouan in Tunisia, and with Fes in Morocco. Lecture 3 │ Arab Invasion of North Africa—639\n\n■■\n\nFinally, it’s important to understand that the Arab invasion of North Africa was about Arab conquests much more than it was about converting locals to Islam. Over conversion, the Arab invaders preferred the payment of a tribute by non-Muslims, the jizya.\n\n■■\n\nWhile the conquest of North Africa was swift, conversion to Islam and the adoption of Arabic as the state language was much slower. But when it finally happened, it was permanent.\n\nSuggested Reading Al-Tabari, The History of al-Tabari, volume XIII. Brett and Fentress, The Berbers, chapter 3. Bulliet, The Camel and the Wheel.

Questions to Consider\n\n1. To what extent was the success of the Arab invasions of North Africa\n\ndependent on the waning influence and growing unpopularity of the Byzantine Empire? Does this explain what would become the absolute and lasting conquest of the region?\n\n2. Subject to payment of jizya, or religious tax, the tolerance of the\n\nArab invaders for other “religions of the book,” notably Judaism and Christianity, is often cited as one of the keys to their success. How does this compare with our own time, and how and why might this be the same or different?\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n27\n\nLecture\n\n4\n\nUmayyad Caliphate in Damascus—661\n\nA\n\nt first glance, there might seem to be nothing controversial about choosing Damascus for the capital of an Arab-Islamic empire. After all, Damascus is today the capital of Syria, a strategic Arabic-speaking country, where more than 90 percent of the population is identified as Muslim. But that’s now. In this lecture, we’re going to consider something that took place in the year 661, when the newly founded Umayyad caliphate established its own capital in Damascus. Believe it or not, this was one of the most controversial decisions ever taken in the Middle East. The Umayyads ■■ The Umayyads’ decision to move the capital of the Islamic Empire from Medina to Damascus, 650 miles to the north, was the most important political turning point in early Muslim history. When the Umayyads decided to make Damascus their capital, the city was an important trading center.\n\n28\n\n■■\n\nAs a prominent family from Mecca, the Umayyads understood soon after Muhammad started preaching that if Islam took hold, they could lose a great deal of prestige and influence. It was for this reason that the Umayyad family converted, and did so only at the last minute, after virtually every other important family in Mecca already had.\n\n■■\n\nOpponents of the Umayyads, already angered by their resurgence in power, were furious when the first Umayyad caliph, Mu‘awiyah, announced he was introducing a system of dynastic succession, so that his son would take over when he died. This system of dynastic succession would become the norm for all caliphates for the next 1,300 years.\n\nLecture 4 │ Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus—661\n\n■■\n\nSupporters of the Umayyads point to their legacy as a sign of greatness. Under their rule, the Islamic empire grew to its greatest extent. Indeed, when the Umayyad conquests came to a halt, their empire was the largest the world had ever seen, and it remains the fifth-largest empire in human history.\n\n■■\n\nThe Umayyads’ empire covered the whole of the Arabian Peninsula, the Levant (which refers to an extensive area in the eastern Mediterranean), modern Iran and Iraq, parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northwestern India. It ranged across North Africa to the Atlantic. And it covered virtually the whole of the Iberian Peninsula, eastern Anatolia, the Caucasus, and parts of Central Asia.\n\nDamascus as the Capital ■■ The fateful decision by Mu‘awiyah, the fifth caliph, to make Damascus his capital was not met with universal approval. A civil war broke out with further, periodic outbursts of unrest marking the whole 90 years of Umayyad rule. ■■\n\nThe eminent historian of the Middle East, Philip Hitti, neatly sums up the Umayyads’ move to Damascus: “Henceforth, the history of Arabia begins to deal more with the effect of the outer world on the peninsula and less with the effect of the peninsula on the outer world.” In other words, the political caravan had moved on, leaving in its wake numerous unhappy Arabian interest groups.\n\n■■\n\nSome of the loudest critics were former companions of Muhammad, including many of his own family members and other early converts to Islam. They had enjoyed special status during the early days of Islam. They objected loudly to any move away from Arabia, rightly seeing that they were, in the process, losing political power.\n\n■■\n\nAside from such personal objections, many native Arabians were wary of Damascus in and of itself. This major cosmopolitan center was, after all, among the most important cities in the Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n29\n\nByzantine Empire, richer and worldlier than anywhere in Arabia. There was a fear that temptations lay in large cities—people and ideas that could lead one astray. ■■\n\nA Muslim army had conquered Damascus 26 years earlier, in 635, but even now Muslims remained a small minority among the total population. Damascus was largely made up of Byzantine-Christians.\n\n■■\n\nApart from the everyday immorality associated with cities, there was a worry that foreign ideas would corrupt the purity of Islam and Islamic rule—ideas such as dynastic succession. For Arabs, dynastic succession would, in all but name, turn caliphs into kings. In hindsight, this was an astute, and not inaccurate, assessment.\n\nMu‘awiyah ■■ After being installed in Jerusalem as the fifth caliph, one of Mu‘awiyah’s first announcements was that he was now “first among his peers.” In the process, he abandoned any pretense of being a religious leader, which was anyway only one part of the role played by the first four caliphs.\n\n30\n\n■■\n\nWhat Mu‘awiyah now made clear was that his right to rule was based not on religious authority, but on his position as a tribal chief and governor, plus the collected swords and cavalry of the army in Syria who stood by him.\n\n■■\n\nThe logical conclusion of his announcement was this: If he were ruling as a tribal leader, and not as the religiously approved choice of the companions of Muhammad, what was to stop him from handing power over to his son? The answer was nothing, and this is exactly what he announced three years before his death.\n\n■■\n\nWhile he managed to win the support from some quarters, opposition from others was just as strong. That opposition would Lecture 4 │ Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus—661\n\npursue all 14 Umayyad caliphs throughout their 90 years of power in the region. The most serious troubles the Umayyads faced were during periods of civil war. ■■\n\nMu‘awiyah’s rise to power marked the end of the first Muslim civil war, or Fitna in Arabic, the “time of tribulation.” Under the Umayyads, there would be another two periods of serious tribulation and a number of other revolts challenging Umayyad authority in different parts of the empire.\n\n■■\n\nAs for Mu‘awiyah’s feelings towards the Persians, it seems they were right to be resentful. As he wrote to one of his Arab governors during one period of unrest: “Be watchful of Persian Muslims and never treat them as equals. … As far as possible give them smaller pensions and lowly jobs. In the presence of an Arab, a non-Arab shall not lead prayers, nor are they to be allowed to stand in the first row of prayer.” Such a view hardly tallies with what Muhammad had in mind when he said that all Muslims, regardless of race, were equal before God, and should be treated as such.\n\nCitizenship and Religion ■■ The sharp rise in the size of the Umayyad empire, the subsequent increase in non-Arab converts, and the often shoddy treatment of these converts led to a great deal of resentment, which would become an important contributing factor in the Umayyads’ eventual fall. ■■\n\nBy the year 750, and the end of Umayyad rule in the Middle East, there were more non-Arab than Arab Muslims, a statistic that has never been reversed. Today, it’s reckoned that less than 15 percent of the world’s Muslims are Arabs.\n\n■■\n\nMu‘awiyah himself is usually regarded—by the standards of his day—as a religiously tolerant individual. However, the judgment of history suggests that this was probably due more to politically rather than religiously enlightened views. Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n31\n\n■■\n\nToward the end of his reign—around the year 675—Mu‘awiyah banned non-Muslims from entering the cities of Mecca and Medina. Mu‘awiyah’s ban on non-Muslims entering Mecca and Medina appears to have been part of a broader policy to sideline these cities, as they were centers of opposition to his rule as caliph. Without visits from non-Muslims, Mecca and Medina were unable to flourish as mercantile centers.\n\nUmmayad Territory ■■ In terms of conquests, the Umayyads were in possession of twothirds of what had been the Byzantine Empire. They extinguished serious resistance among the Berbers and completed the conquest of North Africa, before invading Europe. There, they quickly conquered Spain and pushed north into France, getting within 120 miles of Paris before their advances faltered, most famously at the Battle of Tours, also known as the Battle of Poitiers. ■■\n\nIn Eurasia, they pressed into the Caucasus region and beyond, establishing a presence at the mouth of the Volga River on the shores of the Caspian Sea. In Central Asia, they took citystates such as Ferghana and Samarqand and pressed up to the borders of Tang China, while in the south and east they made important inroads through Afghanistan and into modern Pakistan and India.\n\n■■\n\nUnprecedented in scale, these conquests would have been fleeting had it not been for the organizational infrastructure that underlay them. And this, again, is why the move to Damascus was vital. Arguably, had Mu‘awiyah not established the Umayyad capital in Damascus, he wouldn’t have obtained the insight and administrative know-how that proved essential in making his empire a functioning entity.\n\nAbd al-Malik ■■ Mu‘awiyah’s later successor, the fifth Umayyad caliph and master administrator, was Abd al-Malik. The administrative genius of 32\n\nLecture 4 │ Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus—661\n\nAbd al-Malik saw the introduction of two important innovations. First, he made Arabic the official state language, and second, he introduced a single, empire-wide, distinctively Islamic currency. ■■\n\nAs Arabic took over from Persian and Greek as the languages of local government, anyone who wanted to get ahead in the Umayyad world would learn Arabic in order to do so. Among other benefits, it released Abd al-Malik and future caliphates from relying on their conquered subjects to provide most of the educated workforce.\n\n■■\n\nAs for coinage, until this point the Arabs had been happy to use pre-existing coins, as minted by the region’s older empires, namely the Byzantines and Sasanians. But this style eventually changed to coinage that featured a Quran verse alongside the name of the Muslim ruler. Abd al-Malik used coinage to make it clear that his Islamic empire was here to stay.\n\nThe Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n33\n\n■■\n\nAs for Damascus, it would remain a majority Christian city until the 9th century. In fact, much of what we think of as the Muslim Middle East and North Africa would remain Muslim-minority countries for another century or more.\n\n■■\n\nThrough the Arabic language and a distinct Islamic currency, Abd al-Malik put the non-Arab city of Damascus firmly at the center of his global empire. This wasn’t just a process of nationalizing but Arabising. It wouldn’t happen overnight, but when it did take it would stand in the vast majority of North Africa and the Middle East until the present day.\n\n■■\n\nMu‘awiyah, Abd al-Malik, and other of the Umayyad caliphs instigated innumerable grand building projects. The most famous of these included the magnificent Grand Mosque in Damascus, and the al-Aqsa Mosque complex, which includes the Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem. These two spots are held to be Islam’s third and fourth most sacred sites, respectively.\n\nSuggested Reading Bennison and Gascoigne, Cities in the Pre-Modern Islamic World.

The majority Sunni and the minority Shia initially began to split over a succession dispute. Broadly speaking, this lecture is going to cover three topics: how that succession dispute came about in the first place, the individuals behind the dispute, and what happened during the Battle of Karbala. After covering those areas, this lecture describes the political and religious fallout that followed. Defining Shia and Sunni ■■ Although the the terms Shia and Sunni weren’t really in use at the time of the Battle of Karbala, defining them will help make the dispute between the two sides easier to understand. ■■\n\nThe Arabic word Shia means a “follower” or “partisan.” Originally, the Shia were better known as Shiat Ali, or the “party of Ali”— those who sided with Ali. The word Shiite is derived from Shia, and can be used as either a noun or an adjective.\n\n■■\n\nThe term Sunni, to describe Islam’s main confessional branch, comes from an Arabic word meaning “custom,” “habit,” or “tradition.” Implicit in the label is that a Sunni Muslim is considered a follower of the Sunnah, or the traditions, of Muhammad.\n\n■■\n\nToday, it’s estimated that as many as 90 percent of the world’s Muslims are Sunni, while the remaining 10 percent are Shia.\n\nThe Succession Dispute ■■ The root of what would become the Sunni-Shia divide was anticipated at the very moment of Muhammad’s death, in 632. Muhammad did not explicitly appoint as a successor. The Sunni-\n\n36\n\nLecture 5 │ Battle of Karbala—680\n\nShia split started out as a leadership question, more a matter of power and politics than anything else. ■■\n\nIn the Shia view, Muhammad did appoint a successor: Ali, who was Muhammad’s son-in-law and cousin, a blood relative. Ali was also the first male to accept Islam, responding to Muhammad’s message at the age of 12.\n\n■■\n\nThe Shia view that Ali was the rightful successor to Muhammad is based on their interpretation of numerous hadith, or sayings, of Muhammad. However, Sunni Islam contends the hadith only allude to this. In contrast, Shia tradition holds that the appointment of Ali as the successor to Muhammad is explicit.\n\n■■\n\nAnd so two camps appeared in the leadership struggle: those who favoured a direct descendant of Muhammad, the Shia; and, those who believed Muhammad’s successor should be chosen on merit and consultation by leaders, the Sunni.\n\nAbu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman ■■ Muhammad’s successor had to be appointed quickly, if there was to be stability in the new empire. This urgency was particularly acute because many Arabian tribal leaders believed they’d sworn allegiance to Muhammad during his lifetime, rather than to his successors, or to the religion that lived on after him. ■■\n\nWith this is in mind, a small group of influential men from Mecca chose Abu Bakr as Muhammad’s successor. Abu Bakr was Muhammad’s father-in-law and came from an elite family. In the Shia tradition, Abu Bakr’s selection was done deliberately fast so that Ali, who—with other members of his family—was preparing Muhammad for his burial, was not present to argue his own case.\n\n■■\n\nAbu Bakr was relatively elderly at the time of his appointment, and he ruled for just two years before he died. His successor, the second caliph in the Sunni tradition, was Umar, who ruled Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n37\n\nfrom 634 to 644. Like Abu Bakr, Umar was also from an elite Meccan family.\n\nWar\n\n38\n\n■■\n\nAfter Muhammad, Umar is probably the most important person in the development of Sunni Islam. Umar was responsible for starting to organize the expanding Islamic empire, which was ongoing when a discontented Muslim slave from Persian murdered him. Before he died, Umar rejected the idea of appointing his successor. Instead he drew up a list of six names, and asked that his followers settle the matter by consultation.\n\n■■\n\nWhile Ali’s name was on the list, he was not selected to become the next caliph. Instead, that was a man named Uthman. Unlike Abu Bakr and Umar, Uthman’s time in office was controversial, with disputes breaking out over his apparent favouritism towards members of his own tribe.\n\n■■\n\nAfter 12 years in power, disaffected Muslims from Egypt and Iraq assassinated Uthman. This was the first serious, bloody and public rupture in Islam. Now, Ali’s supporters at last saw him become caliph.\n\n■■\n\nAli’s five years as ruler, from 656 to 661, marked Islam’s first civil war, and the battle for political supremacy, which pushes us forward to that fateful day at Karbala.\n\n■■\n\nAli had nothing to do with Uthman’s murder, but certain Uthman supporters felt that Ali had failed as a leader by not bringing the killers to justice. One of Uthman’s supporters was his cousin and governor of Syria, Mu‘awiyah. Mu‘awiyah issued a direct challenge to Ali, who was based in his own capital, the Iraqi city of Kufa, about 100 miles south of modern Baghdad.\n\n■■\n\nEither Ali would produce Uthman’s killers, or he would be held accountable as an accomplice to his murder. Ali was\n\nLecture 5 │ Battle of Karbala—680\n\nassassinated while at prayer in the Great Mosque in Kufa during the course of the first Muslim civil war. ■■\n\nWith Ali dead, the Shia decided that his eldest son, Hassan, should succeed him. However, Hassan almost immediately signed a peace treaty with Mu‘awiyah, which ended the civil war and saw Hassan go into retirement in Medina.\n\n■■\n\nBut Mu‘awiyah broke the terms of his treaty with Hassan. In an incendiary move, Mu‘awiyah announced that his son, Yazid, would succeed him as caliph. The supporters of the late caliph Ali were enraged by the announcement, and the very public way in which Mu‘awiyah had broken his word.\n\n■■\n\nMany non-Shia were also shocked. Hadn’t Umar confirmed the consultative tradition by appointing a council to decide on his successor? And if there were going to be dynastic succession in Islam, surely it was only fitting that the successors should be members of Muhammad’s family?\n\n■■\n\nMu‘awiyah’s family, the Umayyads, had opposed Muhammad’s message of Islam until the last possible moment. It was Mu‘awiyah’s father who forced Muhammad and his early followers to run from Mecca to Medina in the first days of Islam. That this family would now become the first Islamic dynasty upset many.\n\nBehind the Dispute ■■ When Mu‘awiyah died after nearly 20 years in power, his son Zayid did indeed become the sixth caliph, and the second Umayyad caliph. This is not a state of affairs that Ali’s surviving son, Hassan’s younger brother, Hussein, could accept. Nor did the older families from Medina or Mecca, who continue to see the Umayyads as overreaching their authority. ■■\n\nAnother group that was unhappy about Yazid’s succession were the rulers of Kufa. Having enjoyed a brief period as the capital of Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n39\n\nthe Muslim world, during Ali’s time as caliph, they now saw an opportunity to regain this prestige and power. With this in mind, the authorities in Kufa wrote to Hussein, asking him to leave Mecca for Kufa, and to lead a rebellion against the Umayyad caliphate. Thus the stage was set for the Battle of Karbala. ■■\n\nBy the time Hussein was en route, the Kufans had switched sides, in response to being threatened by Yazid’s governor in the city, a man named ibn Ziyad. Suddenly the prophet’s grandson, with his family and a small band of men, were riding towards an unfriendly, enemy city.\n\nThe Battle Itself ■■ Two days outside of Kufa, Hussein’s caravan of about 150 people found themselves confronted by the army of ibn Ziyad. Orders were handed down that Hussein and his family, trapped on the desert plain, were to be forced to surrender. To ensure this, they were to be stopped from getting water, right in sight of a river. ■■\n\nAfter four days without water, the battle took place on the 10th day of Muharram, the first month in the Islamic calendar. As dawn\n\nThe Battle of Karbala\n\n40\n\nLecture 5 │ Battle of Karbala—680\n\nbroke, Hussein and the other men readied themselves to fight. They consisted of 40 men on foot and 32 on horseback. They confronted an Umayyad army of between 5,000 and 25,000. ■■\n\nIbn Ziyad’s army opened the combat by showering Ali’s small camp with arrows. Fearing for the safety of their women and children, Ali and his men asked for the right to meet ibn Ziyad’s soldiers in single combat. This was accepted. One by one, Ali and his men went out to meet their enemies in hand-to-hand combat, fighting and dying.\n\n■■\n\nThe outcome was never in doubt. If Ali’s band of 72 managed to cause 88 enemy fatalities, the result at battle’s end was still that Hussein and his companions lay dead. After ibn Ziyad’s army left the battlefield, some locals buried the dead, marking only Hussein’s grave. The day after the battle, the captive women and children—including Hussein’s younger sister Zaynab—were loaded onto camels, and taken to Kufa.\n\nThe Aftermath ■■ The feast of Ashura—the annual commemoration of the martyrdom of Hussein—is noted for the dramatic wailing on the part of many participants, as well as self-flagellation in some cases. After more than 1,300 years, the sense of guilt for failing to defend Hussein seems to remain as powerful as ever among some Shiites. ■■\n\nThe annual commemorations are possible, in part, because Zaynab and other family members retold the story of the battle, even during captivity in Damascus. One especially poignant incident forms a central part of the traditional narrative: that Hussein’s infant child was struck and killed by an arrow fired by ibn Ziyad’s men.\n\n■■\n\nOn the orders of ibn Zayid, every one of vanquished party, now consisting of 72 bodies, was beheaded, with individual heads being given to the various tribal leaders. Hussein’s head was Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n41\n\nmounted on a lance, and marched the more than 500 miles to Damascus. What happened next is a matter of debate— and faith.\n\n42\n\n■■\n\nThe Shia believe that Hussein’s head eventually was returned to Karbala and interred with the rest of his remains. However, there remain a number of other pilgrimage sites across the Muslim world that claim to be the keeper of Hussein’s head. As a result, one can travel to Karbala, Cairo, Damascus, or the city of Ashkelon in Israel and find shrines claiming to contain the head of the last of Muhammad’s grandsons.\n\n■■\n\nEventually, the story of Karbala was written down. The differing accounts of the battle make clear that embellishment and error crept in over time. Regardless, while Hussein and his companions failed to beat the caliph’s army on that day, accounts of the battle—and the unnecessary cruelty carried out by the caliph’s men—saw the dead win more sympathy than the victors.\n\n■■\n\nIn time, the battle would be the defining moment in the split between the two main branches of Islam. Both branches see the battle as tragic, but its religious significance and impact is much greater for Shi‘i, whose annual Ashura commemoration is an important point in their religious calendar.\n\n■■\n\nFor the Shia, Karbala remains of central importance not only on the matter of authority in Islam, but also for their view of themselves and the world at large. As one traditional Shia saying goes, “Every day is Ashura and every land is Karbala.” The sense of sacrifice for God and one’s community remains paramount, and Hussein’s martyrdom at Karbala is the best example of such an attitude.\n\nLecture 5 │ Battle of Karbala—680\n\nSuggested Reading Dabashi, Shi’ism, chapters 1, 2, and 3.

How might the development of martyrdom and persecution in the Shia religious narrative have impacted their place in society, both under Sunni Abbasid and Ottoman caliphates, and in our own time?\n\n3.

How might that country’s religious-political authorities view their political “success” against more traditional views of loss and persecution?\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n43\n\nLecture\n\n6\n\nArab Invasion of Andalusia—711\n\nI\n\nt was during the rule of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid ibn al-Malik I that the Arab invasion of Spain took place. Al-Malik’s reign would mark the last major advances in the history of this—or any subsequent—Islamic empire. This invasion marked the start of almost 800 years of Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula. But this lecture examines whether the “Arab invasion of Spain” can properly be called that at all. It then looks at the key figures in the event, and what happened after. Tariq ibn Ziyad ■■ In spring of the year of 711, a man stood in thought, staring at a mountain that dominates the landscape. The locals still knew the mountain by the Roman name: Hollow Mountain.\n\n44\n\n■■\n\nThe man was Tariq ibn Ziyad, and he was about to sail into history. Once Tariq reached this imposing signpost, the peak, and the body of water over which he would sail, would both be known by his own name: Tariq’s Mountain. In Arabic, that is Jebel Tariq. In English, it’s Gibraltar.\n\n■■\n\nTariq was a native of North Africa, probably from the area of modern Libya. He was a proud Berber, who are the indigenous people of North Africa. But many years earlier, Tariq was taken prisoner during a losing battle against Arab invaders. Tariq was the property of the Arab governor of the Roman province of Ifriqiya, or modern Tunisia. He spent years living as a slave.\n\n■■\n\nBut Tariq’s master, Musa bin Nusayr, recognized his bravery, and his talent for leadership, and granted him freedom—making him a general in his army.\n\nLecture 6 │ Arab Invasion of Andalusia—711\n\n■■\n\nTariq’s life had already taken some dramatic turns, and the most dramatic was yet to happen. Here he stood, a general and his army—a recent convert to Islam—preparing to invade Spain.\n\nAccounts of the Invasion ■■ In the case of the Arab invasion of Spain, the sole surviving contemporary account is a document called the Chronicle of 754. Compiled by an anonymous native Iberian Christian who Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n45\n\nlived under Arab rule, the chronicle gets its name from the fact that the year 754 is the last year covered in the text. ■■\n\nThe Chronicle of 754 is frustratingly vague on many important points, such as the numbers of combatants involved and the location of certain clashes. But in terms of contemporary accounts, it’s all we’ve got to go on.\n\n■■\n\nFor Arab narratives, we’re even less well served. The earliest account we have is by Ibn Abd al-Hakem, a generally careful writer, but one who clearly relies on earlier accounts that we have no way of judging. And while Abd al-Hakem provides us with far more detail than the Chronicle of 754, he’s writing 3,000 miles from the scene, in Cairo, and 150 years after the fact.\n\nArab Invasion of Spain or Not? ■■ There is good reason to challenge the three central planks of the idea of an Arab invasion of Spain. Those planks are the event’s Arab-ness, the Spanish-ness of the place that was invaded, and the whole event’s status as a deliberate invasion. ■■\n\nThe man who led the assault, Tariq ibn Zayid, was a native North African Berber, not an Arab. The vast majority of the troops that accompanied Tariq from Africa to Europe were Berbers, about 7,000 of them. Without the Berbers, there might have been no invasion of the Iberian Peninsula at all.\n\n■■\n\nThe Berber-Arab army attacked, and eventually took over, what we now call Spain. But Spain would not exist in the sense of a nation state for centuries yet. What was in its place was the Roman designation Hispania. □□\n\n46\n\nHispania covered most of the Iberian Peninsula, that is to say, both Spain and Portugal. And the name Iberia predates the Romans.\n\nLecture 6 │ Arab Invasion of Andalusia—711\n\n□□\n\n■■\n\n■■\n\nAfter the Berber-Arab invasion, the term Hispania fell into disuse, and was replaced by the more familiar al-Andalus, or in its Westernised form, Andalusia.\n\nIt seems likely that the whole affair started out with a few disorganized raids, undertaken by Berbers intent on grabbing loot. Tariq and his Berber kinsmen were locals and had long had trade links to the Iberian Peninsula, which was less than nine miles from the coast of North Africa. □□\n\nThe Berbers knew about the fertility of the land and the potential wealth of trade there.\n\n□□\n\nWhether Tariq thought he was leading a raiding party or a full-blown invasion, we’ll never know.\n\nFor the sake of ease, this lecture will talk about “Arab armies” and the “invasion of Spain,” with the stipulation that the reality is rather more nuanced and complicated.\n\nTariq’s Campaign ■■ While the exact date of the invasion is still in dispute, we’re fairly sure it took place in the year 92 in the Islamic calendar. Most commentators agree on April 711 as the western date of Tariq’s landing. ■■\n\nThere was at least one smaller approach a year earlier, when Tariq sent 400 infantry and 100 cavalry on a preliminary raid. It was partly the success of this raid that led Tariq to prepare a bigger, bolder attack the following spring.\n\n■■\n\nTariq’s invasion force consisted of about 7,000 Berber troops, later reinforced by an additional 5,000-strong Arab force.\n\n■■\n\nAccording to legend, Tariq was helped to sail to Spain by a local vassal of the Visigoths who ruled Andalusia at that time: Julian, Lord of Ceuta. The story goes that when Roderic had Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n47\n\nbecome king of the Visigoths a year earlier, Julian agreed to remain a loyal subject of this new, controversial king. Julian sent one of his daughters to King Roderic’s court, in order for her to be educated.\n\n48\n\n■■\n\nBut Roderic raped Julian’s daughter, who then became pregnant. Outraged, Julian contacted Tariq; they made peace, and Julian decided to get his revenge through helping the ambitious Berber by providing ships to transport him and his army to Andalusia.\n\n■■\n\nAccording to the Chronicle of 754, Roderic violently usurped the throne in 710. He possibly murdered the incumbent king, an act that led to anger and dissent among those who were in line to the throne.\n\n■■\n\nIt was at this moment—when Visigothic Andalusia was in the midst of, as the chronicler puts it, “internal frenzy”—that Tariq and his army landed. Roderic was forced to march out and confront the invading Berbers. He had cobbled together an army, but he was far from certain where their loyalties lay.\n\n■■\n\nThe fateful encounter was the Battle of Guadalete. It took place in July 711 somewhere on the Guadalete River. Exaggerated reports say Roderic’s army consisted of as many as 100,000 men. More circumspect estimates place this figure at 40,000, but even this sounds overly large. In many early histories, when tens or hundreds of thousands are mentioned, it’s often meant to indicate a very large force, rather than a literal or accurate number.\n\n■■\n\nThere’s not much to say about this battle beyond the fact that it was a rout. The chronicler tells us that Roderic was betrayed by some of his rivals for power, and that the army of the Visigoths was annihilated. Thus ended not only Roderic’s life, and his oneyear reign, but also the Visigoths’ empire in Andalusia.\n\nLecture 6 │ Arab Invasion of Andalusia—711\n\n■■\n\nBy the end of that summer, Tariq found himself in control of close to half of the peninsula, and the rest of it would fall in the following year.\n\n■■\n\nAt this point, some accounts say that Musa, the Arab governor in Tunisia, had become both angry and jealous at the runaway success being enjoyed by his former slave. Remember, it’s far from clear that Musa had ordered Tariq to invade.\n\n■■\n\nIn any event, when word got back to the Umayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik, he was initially angry, and ordered Tariq and Musa to Damascus to explain what they meant by launching this unauthorised war.\n\n■■\n\nBy the time the caliph’s orders reached Tariq, he’d already destroyed the opposition and taken Iberia for the distant Umayyad caliph, so he could at least hope to be received as the conquering hero. In any event, neither Musa nor Tariq ever returned to North Africa or Andalusia. They quietly disappeared from the story, apart from Tariq’s now-eponymous mountain and body of water.\n\nThe Next Stage ■■ Moving northward, the Arabs crossed the Pyrenees, in 717, and marched into Gaul, what we now call France. The ArabBerber attacks and invasion of Gaul didn’t see the invaders establish any permanent footholds north of the Pyrenees. And even south of the mountains they started suffering setbacks and territorial losses. ■■\n\nIn about the year 722, a small but significant battle took place in the region of Asturias, on Spain’s northern coast. Since the Berber-Arab invasion and conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, bands of refugees—including the surviving Visigoths—had retreated further and further north, until they found themselves in this remote and mountainous region.\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n49\n\n■■\n\nBeing so remote encouraged the refugees and locals to put up some resistance. That was much easier here than it would have been for anyone living closer to the Arabs’ capital in Andalusia, the city of Cordoba.\n\n■■\n\nThe resistance movement, which started when the locals refused to pay taxes to their Arab masters, grew until the Arabs were forced to take action. The Arabs met the Spanish-Visigothic resisters at the Battle of Covadonga, and, alas for the Arabs, were roundly beaten. The importance of this battle in the history of the Arab invasion and conquest of Spain is that it was the first time they’d lost such an encounter.\n\n■■\n\nThe Arabs never managed to re-take the Asturias region. As a result, many historians see the Battle of Covadonga as the start of the Reconquista, that is, the nearly 800-year process of—from the perspective of European chroniclers—re-taking Andalusia for Christendom. Before long, other northern regions would be wrested away from the Muslim empire.\n\n■■\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula settled down into two distinct zones: the prosperous Muslim lands in the southern two-thirds, with their capital at Cordoba; and the northern portions, made up of a number of small Christian-ruled states.\n\nConsequences ■■ The Arab invaders were not universally welcomed by the locals. There most certainly was bloodshed, murder, destruction, looting, and all the rest. That’s typically the way with conquests. ■■\n\n50\n\nOn the other hand, we should not allow ourselves to fall into the trap of seeing the Arab invasion of Spain as especially bloody or disastrous, for the region or its peoples. It was not much different from countless other conquest events in the east and west throughout human history, and it was a great deal less bloody than many.\n\nLecture 6 │ Arab Invasion of Andalusia—711\n\n■■\n\nThe early days after the conquest didn’t usher in a golden age of learning, culture and peace in Andalusia; that came later. What did happen was unrest and infighting between the Arabs and the Berbers, and among them.\n\n■■\n\nThe Berbers were unhappy at the loot and lands that their Arab overlords gifted to them. The Arabs, who still saw themselves as the natural superiors of the North Africa natives, felt otherwise.\n\n■■\n\nIt would be 40 years before a greater degree of peace and stability prevailed in Andalusia. This followed the arrival of Abd ar-Rahman, the sole surviving member of the Umayyad family, after the slaughter of his family by their Abbasid rivals. The tribes settled down under his centralized rule, and he established a dynasty that lasted for nearly 300 years.\n\nSuggested Reading Brett and Fentress, The Berbers, chapter 3.

Questions to Consider\n\n1. How far should one see the events of 711 as a deliberate, Arab-\n\nBerber invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, as opposed to a series of raids in search of booty, which then developed into an invasion proper for want of any serious opposition?\n\n2. With communication difficulties inevitable over large distances in the Eighth century, consider the various possible reactions from the caliph in Damascus on learning that one of his governors had conducted a successful, albeit unsanctioned, conquest of a new territory?\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n51\n\nBattle of Talas—751\n\nLecture\n\n7\n\nT\n\nry, for a minute, to conceive a world without paper. Imagine not just how limiting that would be to our everyday lives, but also how much slower we would find it to share information. This was the situation in the Middle East before the Battle of Talas, which took place in modernday Kyrgystan, in July, 751. After this event, papermaking quickly spread west, and the Arabs became engaged in a frenzy of literary production. A strong case can be made for the Battle of Talas being an event that would witness the birth of the Islamic Golden Age. Talas and Tours ■■ The Battle of Talas is named for a nearby town, and saw the first—and only—occasion when Arab and Chinese armies opposed one another. It ended in a clear victory for the Abbasid Arab force.\n\n52\n\n■■\n\nTalas is a long way from Western Europe, and the steppes of Central Asia are also very remote, for the West, at least. Many Western historians, as a result, ignore the event.\n\n■■\n\nThey also ignore it because of the Battle of Tours, which took place in the year 732. In the battle, Charles Martel beat an Arab army just 120 miles south of Paris. That is close to 3,500 miles west of Talas, so it’s not surprising which event got more attention from European scholars.\n\n■■\n\nIn the past, most Western historians saw Tours as a turning point in European history. It was the moment, they argued, when the Arab-Islamic tide was turned back. But a very real question is whether the Arabs, had they won the Battle of Tours, intended to continue their northward march. Given accounts of their clothing, which was ill-suited for cold weather, it’s far from certain that they were a conquering army. Lecture 7 │ Battle of Talas—751\n\nPapermaking\n\nFocusing on Talas ■■ The Battle of Talas marked the furthest reaches of the Islamic world to the northeast of the Middle East—beyond Persia—as well as the maximum extent of western Chinese expansion. ■■\n\nNeither side particularly wanted to fight. As often is the case with major empires, they were—apart from covering a lot of Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n53\n\nterritory—ruling over a variety of subject peoples and political entities, including vassal states and protectorates.\n\n54\n\n□□\n\nThe Chinese and the Abbasid Arabs alike found themselves caught up in smaller-scale disputes between local rivals, and were forced to make use of mercenaries when it came to joining battle.\n\n□□\n\nIf either side ignored the various appeals for help—putting in place a puppet ruler here, or putting down a rebellion there— the distant borders of the Chinese and Arabs’ respective empires could become vulnerable to more serious threats in the future.\n\n■■\n\nNeither the Chinese nor the Abbasid Arabs were really familiar with the local geography. They were both a very long way from their heartlands and moved hesitantly toward one another.\n\n■■\n\nThe site of the battlefield has never been definitively identified. But after picking apart Arab and Chinese sources, we can be sure it wasn’t far from Kyrgystan’s modern-day city of Talas, near the country’s northern border with Kazakhstan.\n\n■■\n\nOn the Muslim side, the best available accounts were written in the early 13th century by the Kurdish historian Ibn al-Athi, and in the 14th century by Damascus-born al-Dhahabi. Where there are facts that can be checked, the work of both men generally agrees with the main Chinese account of the battle, which can be found in the History of the Tang Dynasty, an official Chinese record of events.\n\n■■\n\nArab and Chinese sources agree that the battle took place in the summer of 751, and that the fighting was spread out over a period of five days, and that the Chinese were soundly beaten.\n\n■■\n\nAfter Talas, the victorious Arabs and the defeated Chinese alike wrote accounts of the battle. Not surprisingly, the Chinese Lecture 7 │ Battle of Talas—751\n\naccount says that the Arabs had a force of as many as 200,000. Now, the typical size of armies of this period was between 10,000 and 30,000 men, and there is no reason to think that the Battle of Talas was unusual in this regard. So we can say that the Chinese number was a massive exaggeration. ■■\n\nThe Arab sources say they were confronted by 100,000 Chinese troops, but this, too, is almost certainly an example of chroniclers embellishing the truth. The sides were likely fairly evenly matched.\n\n■■\n\nBoth sides employed and relied on large numbers of foreign troops at Talas. The Abbasids employed Tibetans, who were already involved in a fight against Chinese domination. The Chinese, led by Gao Xianzhi, had as many as 20,000 Karluk mercenaries in their ranks, or as much as two-thirds of their army.\n\n■■\n\nThe Karluks were Turkic, nomads who made up part of a large, prominent, nomadic confederacy that hailed from Central Asia. Their descendants are the modern-day Uighers and Uzbeks. It was the Chinese reliance on Karluk mercenaries that would lead to their defeat.\n\nThe Fighting ■■ Five days is an awfully long time to fight in hand-to-hand combat. Both sides competed with swords and spears, and each made some use of chain-mail armor and metal helmets. ■■\n\nBoth civilizations also made use of cavalry, and the Arabs employed camels, although it was more commonplace for these animals to carry troops and supplies to the battlefield before the men dismounted and fought on foot.\n\n■■\n\nThe two sides became exhausted, and the outcome would naturally depend on who could hold out longest.\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n55\n\n56\n\n■■\n\nAccording to both versions of events, the Karluk mercenaries employed by the Chinese simply changed sides, and attacked their former paymasters from behind, while the Abbasids pressed on from the front.\n\n■■\n\nChinese sources claim the Karluks had been planned this act of wanton treachery even before the battle began. On this point, surely the Chinese sources are wide of the mark. Why, if you had decided for whatever reason to change sides, would you endure four full days of fighting before doing so?\n\n■■\n\nThe Arab chroniclers offer no explanation for the Karluk turncoats, although it must have been the Abbasids who were responsible for persuading these nomadic people.\n\n■■\n\nUltimately the Chinese—seeing that they could not possibly prevail while being simultaneously attacked from the front and the rear—escaped from the battlefield as best they could, among them the commanding general, Gao Xianzhi.\n\n■■\n\nWhile Xianzhi lived to fight another day, best estimates suggest he fled with no more than 2,000 surviving Tang Chinese soldiers.\n\n■■\n\nWe’re unlikely ever to know the truth of the matter, but it seems most likely that the Karluks were bought off by the Abbasids. Promises of money or other forms of booty, such as horses and camels, seem most likely.\n\n■■\n\nAnimals would be highly prized by Central Asian nomads, whereas promises of land would hold far less appeal. The Karluks roamed where they liked and would likely take what they liked, too, in terms of land for grazing. They were obviously bold enough to fight against two of the region’s biggest empires during the course of a single battle.\n\nLecture 7 │ Battle of Talas—751\n\nAfter the Battle ■■ The Battle of Talas didn’t mark the start—or the end—of a dynasty or an empire. Only 18 months earlier, the Abbasids had seized power from their Muslim rivals, the Umayyads, to become the Islamic world’s ruling power. And the Abbasids would go on to rule for 500 years more. In China, the Tang dynasty lasted for another 150 years. ■■\n\nVery much like the Battle of Tours two decades earlier, the importance of the Battle of Talas is more symbolic than practical. That said, in practical terms it would prove to be the easternmost expansion of the Abbasid Arab Empire, and the westernmost expansion of the Tang Dynasty—or for that matter any subsequent Chinese dynasty.\n\n■■\n\nFour years after the Battle of Talas, a major rupture emerged in the political life of the Tang Dynasty. This was the An Lushan Rebellion. It almost certainly played a part in there being no further westward push by the Chinese.\n\n■■\n\nIt might be difficult to fathom in the context of the recently completed Battle of Talas, but during the course of the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang Chinese asked for—and got help from—the Abbasid Muslims. This is a good example of how quickly political and military interests and allegiances can shift.\n\n■■\n\nHowever, neither side attempted to establish permanent diplomatic links in the immediate aftermath of Talas. The ruling Arab caliph and the Chinese emperor remained largely ignorant of one another.\n\n■■\n\nAnother 40 years would go by before a subsequent Abbasid caliph established proper ties with China. And that man, the fifth Abbasid Caliph, was the justly famous patron of learning, Harun al-Rashid. It was his founding of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad that one day would do much to spur the Islamic Golden Age. Turning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n57\n\nTalas as a Turning Point ■■ The Battle of Talas was a major turning point in the history of the Middle East and Europe. Thousands of Tang Chinese and Abbasid Arabs were killed over the course of five days of fighting, and thousands more were taken prisoner.\n\n58\n\n■■\n\nAmong the captured were two men who brought with them— and were forced to reveal—the technological expertise of papermaking.\n\n■■\n\nCritics of this story will say that it’s just too easy, and too convenient, of an explanation for how paper and papermaking came to the Middle East. □□\n\nBut before the battle, paper was barely known in the Middle East, and certainly not produced there.\n\n□□\n\nFurthermore, the first known paper mill in the Islamic world was founded in Samarqand, just 300 miles from Talas, in the very same year the battle took place.\n\n□□\n\nLarge-scale paper production is then recorded in Baghdad in the year 793, in Cairo in 900, and in Morocco by 1100.\n\n■■\n\nIn Baghdad, the invention of machines allowed stronger paper to be made in bulk. It was the creation of this sturdier form of paper that saw an explosion of use in the city that was not only the capital of the Muslim world, but was growing into one of the largest, most sophisticated cities on earth.\n\n■■\n\nSimply put, the introduction of paper to the Islamic Middle East was a revolutionary moment for the Muslim world, and eventually for wider Western civilization.\n\n■■\n\nLater, during the Islamic Golden Age, paper became the means for Arab scholars to write, translate, disseminate, and store the\n\nLecture 7 │ Battle of Talas—751\n\ntremendous wealth of knowledge for which they became known the world over. ■■\n\nWithout access to multiple copies of the same document, a single event—such as the fire that destroyed the Great Library at Alexandria—could otherwise have proven devastating for human knowledge.\n\n■■\n\nBy the year 850, a century after the Battle of Talas, the cultural, literary, and scholarly life of the Middle East had undergone a transformation. From the middle of the 8th century until about the middle of the 12th century, the Arabs were easily the most cultured people on earth. That, to a very large degree, was due to the availability of paper.\n\nSuggested Reading Al-Hassani, 1001 Inventions, chapter 4. Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates.

The decision to build any new city is consequential. But in the case of Baghdad, it was especially so because this city was conceived, and built, to be the capital of an empire. We’re going to start by looking at all of those details: the bricks and mortar. But what makes the founding of Baghdad a turning point in the history of the Middle East is the allimportant human factor, and that’s what sits at the heart of this lecture. Baghdad’s Background ■■ The decision to build Baghdad was made by the second Abbasid caliph, known as al-Mansur. In the year 762, al-Mansur issued the order to build the new capital. Mansur’s decision, and choice of site, was a shrewd political move that signalled two things: greater inclusion of recently converted Persian Muslims, and the fact that his empire needed Persia—modern Iran—and its people.\n\n60\n\n■■\n\nThe Abbasids took their name from Muhammad’s youngest uncle, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, who died 100 years before the dynasty was founded. Al-Mansur was the second of the Abbasid caliphs, but, because of his importance in consolidating the new empire—and for founding Baghdad—he is widely regarded as the dynasty’s true founder.\n\n■■\n\nAl-Mansur surveyed other places before settling on Baghdad. As the historian al-Tabari wrote in the 10th century, Mansur’s decision was based on its suitability for a military camp, access to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and access to food products.\n\n■■\n\nThe rich alluvial plain where Baghdad is located, between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, is at the center of perhaps more cultural and geographic capitals than any other region in the Lecture 8 │ The Founding of Baghdad—762\n\nworld. Just 160 miles to the south, the Sumerian city of Uruk— home to the legendary king and demi-god Gilgamesh—was built around 4000 B.C., and is likely the first recorded city in history. ■■\n\nAncient Babylon lies 50 miles south of where Baghdad would be built. Even closer by was the Persian city of Ctesiphon, imperial capital to both the Parthian and Sasanian Empires. From the year 570, Ctesiphon was the largest city in the world, and remained so until the Arabs conquered it in 637.\n\n■■\n\nBuilding Baghdad almost in the shadow of the Sassanians’ former seat of power was the Abbasids’ clear attempt to demonstrate domination over the older Persian Empire while, at the same time, showing a certain regard for the civilization.\n\n■■\n\nInstead of Baghdad, Mansur decreed that his capital would be called Dar as-Salaam, which translates as the House, Home, or Abode of Peace. Regardless of what Mansur wanted, the city unofficially became known by the more descriptive and prosaic name: the Round City, because of Baghdad’s circular design.\n\n■■\n\nBut it was Baghdad’s official name—Madinat al-Salam, or City of Peace—that appeared on all official documents, coins, and other items of state business, even while the ordinary citizens held onto the older, pre-existing, village name. It wasn’t until the 11th century that Baghdad would be universally, and exclusively, adopted as the name for the Abbasid’s capital.\n\nBuilding Baghdad ■■ The circular design Mansur laid out for Baghdad was identical to one already commonly used in Persia. This was in contrast to Greek and Roman urban planners, who favoured cities laid out in on a grid system. In ancient Persia, on the other hand, cities were typically arranged in a series of concentric circles, with avenues radiating outwards from the palace and government buildings at the center.\n\nTurning Points in Middle Eastern History\n\n61\n\n62\n\n■■\n\nThe caliphal palace along with mosque and housing for Manur’s family and concubines—and a garrison for his personal bodyguard—lay at the center of the city’s innermost circle, and covered about an eighth of a mile. Its gilded entrance would be known as the Golden Gate Palace. It was to the Golden Gate Palace that ambassadors, scholars, and other VIPs from around the known world would come to parlay or negotiate.\n\n■■\n\nLike anyone designing his or her dream home, Mansur wanted the best men on the job. He hired the services of two foreign architects. One was a Jew named Mashallah, from Khorasan in Persia, while the other was a Zoroastrian named Naubakh"
