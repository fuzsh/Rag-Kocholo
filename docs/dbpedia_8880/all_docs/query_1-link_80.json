        "text": "Understanding Arab culture and the values based on it are the crucial points for the proper understanding of the modern region of MENA (composed of the Middle East and North Africa) and its fundamental features. Nevertheless, it must be noticed that all people in the region of MENA are not Arabs like Turks, Jews, some North African tribes, or Iranians. The Arab League (or the League of Arab States) is composed of 22 Arab countries. Even though Arab states are, in fact, from a very cultural viewpoint considered to be Middle Eastern (in a broader sense), not all of them belong to the Middle East (in a narrow sense), and not all Middle Eastern or MENA countries are Arab. Another focal feature of the Arab world is that not all member states have similar attitudes, communications, behaviors, traditions, etc. There are, for instance, Muslim Arab states such as Mauritania, Sudan, or Somalia in which tribal languages are usually spoken rather than Arabic followed by many cultural traditions founded on the local African customs and heritage. We also have to keep in mind the very fact that not all Arabs are Muslims as there are those Middle Eastern Arabs who are Christians (in Lebanon, for instance). However, the Arab nations are composed of an overwhelming Muslim (Sunni or Shia) majority. The next feature we have to take about is that Arabs are an ethnic category of broader Semitic people (Jews are Semites too), while the term Muslim determines religious belief and confessional orientation. Nonetheless, the reference to Arabs is, basically, directed to separate people who possess a unique pattern of behaving founded on their special type of culture, tradition, religion, language, and customs. However, the Arab people do not all look or dress alike and should not be stereotyped. It has to be stressed that Arabs are not a race, skin color, nationality, or Muslim. By the authentic pre-Islamic time, an Arab was an inhabitant of the Arabian Peninsula, a member of some of many nomadic Bedouin tribes but at the time of the expansion of Arabian Islam, Arabs brought their new religion, language, and culture to the region of the Middle East and North Africa and beyond (like to the Iberian Peninsula), mixing it with the conquered peoples from Spain and Portugal to Persia.\n\nIt is not possible to understand the facts and issues related to the Arab world without having a correct comprehension of a more universal issue i.e. the concept of being an Arab. Although Arabs have many differences and contradictions among them, they still enjoy enough common points to feel completely distinguished from others. These common points cause almost the same problems and issues in different parts of Arab world. More importantly, all Arabs are aware of these commonalities and feel proud of them. This awareness causes a kind of sympathy and feeling of having the same fate and destiny. These common points and awareness of them are the strongest and the most influential factors in creating their thoughts, feelings, beliefs, goals, ideals and dreams. In order to be in contact with Arabs, it is significantly important to know what being an Arab means to them. Without such, one cannot have fruitful and constructive cooperation with them. In short, there are two different and somehow opposing meanings for being Arab. One meaning is prevalent among the Muslim grassroots, the lay people, and Muslim thinkers and writers. The threat of the West is an element that strengthens this feeling amongst them. The shared feeling of being disrespected and humiliated by Western colonialists for more than a century is one reason for causing these commonalities. This sympathy was stronger in the last decades and today it is the feeling of being invaded by Western culture and civilization. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and later appeal for help from the U.S was a \"Great Shock\" for Arabs and aggravated their hard emotional situation. In their understanding, not only Mecca but the whole Arabic peninsula is sacred and non-believers are not welcomed there. Thus, the request of the Arab rulers for American non-believers to come there was felt by the Muslim Arabs as a great shame. This is one of the reasons that the movement of Zarqawi and his like were admired at that time and regarded as Muslim heroes Muslims fighting against the Americans in Iraq. This feeling about being an Arab is not based on cultural or political thoughts, but is a very attractive, emotional consideration and is something like being relatives. The common religion, history, culture, and especially language are what cause this feeling. Language is of great significance here. Besides the excellent potentialities that the Ar-abic language has in forming the personality and psychological characteristics of Arabs, it is also a sacred language. Certainly, Arabs are the only nation that is influenced by its language to such extent. Islam as a religion is also involved in forming this feeling. Islamic unity was present in their minds over the recent century. They say Ar-abic unity is the key to Islamic unity, especially when they feel sorry for the loss of their power and the caliphate and golden era, and this is clearly presented in their literature. Arab Sheikhdoms appeal a lot to this concept in order to generalize their problem with a non-Arab country to be with all Arabs, and in so doing they receive support from their fellows. The second meaning and concept of being Arab was noticed by the enlightened and educated class in the Arab world, be it Muslims or Christians, and especially the Arab rulers and diplomats. This concept of being Arab is predominant in their university culture and the political atmosphere. Though its intensity differs from country to another , their foreign policy is first and foremost formed around this concept. Basically, this concept is the result of being introduced to Western nationalism and in many cases it was emphasized by the colonialists.\n\nThis course provides a broad introduction to the history, politics, societies, and cultures of the Middle East. It first critically assesses what is meant by the container \"Middle East,\" examining what holds it together, how it functions as a regional system of interconnected waterways and landmasses, and how it relates to multiple other regional designations (the Mediterranean, EurAsia, Africa, etc.). Next, the course briefly covers origins in Late Antiquity and the birth and spread of Islam up through the rise of the Ottoman, Safavid/Qajar, and Saadian/Alawite empires in the 16th century. The bulk of our attention then focuses on developments from the 19-21st centuries across the region stretching from Morocco to Iran. One goal of the course is for you to develop a literacy/fluency in key terms and geographical references and a basic chronological framework of the region's history. However, the primary goal--with that base knowledge--is for you to also be able to think analytically and critically about key debates, topics, and themes relevant to Middle East. Recurrent topics and themes that we will pursue include geopolitics, state formation, and the importance of the environment and resources. We will also consider the evolving roles of Judaism/Christianity/Islam and other religious traditions and identities in the region; the powerful impact and legacies of empire and colonialism; the importance and ambivalences of nationalism and other forms of collective identity; and the impact of regional and global wars on the region. Extended attention will be devoted to the Palestine-Israel conflict, the role of the US and other Great Power intervention, petro-politics, and the recurrent importance of society-based mobilizations.\n\nAny attempt to write an account of popular culture in the Middle East must face the question of how to define Arab and the Arabs? This might seem an odd statement at first glance: some 350 million people speak the language, ergo they are Arabs, and Arab, the Arabs, the Arab world are terms used so ubiquitously today that the issue is rarely raised. But the need for qualification becomes clear when considering political institutions, regional diversity, historical and cultural patrimony, and the multiple discourses on identity of the region. The political institution par excellence that houses the Arabs is the Arab League, an organization formed in 1944 when its founding countries were still subject to British and French colonial tutelage. Its 22 members include a country in which hardly any Arabic is spoken (Somalia) and countries in which a significant section of the population speak another language as their mother tongue and resist identification through the term Arab (Berbers in Morocco and Algeria; Kurds in Iraq and Syria). Others have lost the language of a previous identity and remain divided over 'Arab' (Egyptian Copts). Others do not attempt to define themselves as Arab yet control territory in which around half the population is Arabic-speaking and embrace the Arab identity marker (Israel and the occupied territories). What we are dealing with then is a contingent identity, a complex political and cultural formulation, deployed politically and embraced culturally at various stages of the past and present.\n\nIn this article Dr. Salam Hawa provides some philosophical reflections on the evolution of Arab political identity. She notes at the outset that little work has been done on the complex relationships that exist among culture, religion, language, and identity in the Arabic world. The Arabic language is closely tied to the Islamic religion, with the Quran itself serving as a model text for the language. The situation is complicated further with the globalization of Islam and of particular forms of Islamic religious beliefs and practices. These globalizing processes further confound the relationships between oneâ€™s identity as a Muslim, as an Arab, and as a member of a given nation-state. Dr. Hawa takes a long historical view of these relationships, focusing on the relationship between the identity that arises from being part of the Muslim world (ummah) and that of being Arabic. She argues that this relationship is one where Arabic political identity tends, over time, to become subsumed by the global religious identity of the ummah. Part of this development, she suggests, involves the long-standing effects of successive waves of colonization of Arab peoples over the past seven centuries. She concludes that it is important for Arab peoples to recognize these effects of colonization on the one side but not to romanticize or orient themselves toward rebuilding the Caliphate of pre-colonial times on the other. Rather, this recognition is important for understanding who they are at present and thus for building a new, more autonomous future."
