        "text": "Less known and studied than its military, political and diplomatic aspects, the demographic aspect of the decadence of the Ottoman Empire is not less important. Under unfavourable conditions, the Ottoman state implemented demographic engineering in order to provide decent subsistence and dwelling to the Muslim refugees coming mainly from the territories seized by the Tsarist Empire and to increase control over the Christian communities. The greatest (and most tragic) wave of refugees occurred in the years 1862–1864, when the Tsarist Empire implemented a policy of extermination and expulsion of the native inhabitants of Western Caucasus. Later, in the memory of the Balkan Christians, these refugees became villains, as they were the tool of the Ottoman repressions. This long term process includes the massive killings and bloody resettlement of the Anatolian Armenians in 1915, which must be viewed not as a sudden starting point, but as a final “perfect storm” caused by the accumulation of ominous factors.\n\nThe thesis examines the demographic processes of three Ottoman cities in the period late fifteenth – early seventeenth centuries. Seen through the data provided by the Ottoman tax and population censuses (tahrir defterleri) the research illustrates three different types of urban development and demographic trends in the Ottoman Upper Thrace. The first type, representative of which was the city of Filibe, points pre-Ottoman settlements, which as a consequence of the policy of the central Ottoman administration, have been recreated and repopulated with Turkish colonists from Asia Minor. The central authority played a crucial role in the demographic processes there. The second type, Tatar Pazarcık, is an example of newly founded Ottoman city in the development of which the state also took active part. The third type, İstamimaka, represents settlement from the medieval Balkan period, which stayed out of the strategic interest of the Ottoman government, having minor state interference in the natural demographic processes.\n\nThis text is an appendix to an article in the November 2017 issue of the Journal of the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association. Its purpose is to provide researchers with a critical summary of the Ottoman census regulations promulgated on 12 June 1902 (AH 5 Rabiulevvel 1320, AR 29 May 1318) (Sicil-i Nüfus Nizamnamesi). Following my summary and analysis, four contemporaneously published versions of the regulation are reproduced: two in Ottoman Turkish, published by two Istanbul newspapers; one in Armenian, published as a booklet; and one in French, published as part of a seven-volume legal work.\n\nThis volume consists of articles of various lengths on issues related to the social and political history of the Ottoman state. Some of the articles, based on original archival sources, were written as independent studies; others were chapters that conformed to the general themes of larger works; a few were commentaries on other colleagues' publications. In other words, these writings do not revolve around a single topic or a single Ottoman historical phase, although the nineteenth century prevails. Yet, as the table of contents indicates, they can be classified into three broad categories, namely, the Ottoman socio-political transformation, the population movements, notably immigration-migration, and finally, in the Balkans and elsewhere, the formation of nation-states, which was accompanied by the change of religious identities into political ones and the emergence of nationalism. In essence, the writings in this volume deal with the transformation of the late Ottoman state that culminated in the rise of modern Turkey. That transformation also has been elaborated upon, with a synthesis of lengthy new materials, in a recent publication that covers roughly the period from 1850 to 1918 and so includes the rise of the Republic. Other relevant information may be found in a number of my books published at various dates. In addition, several of my review essays discuss the conceptual and methodological issues related to Ottoman history and Republican Turkey.\n\nBased on the Ottomans' archival materials, it has become incumbent upon the Ottoman or Balkan historian to investigate and analyze as objectively as possible the history of Ottoman rule in this region. Among all the Ottoman archives' documents, those of the judicial records (Shari'ah or Qadi Sijils) are considered to be the most important. In them, we have both a reliable objective source and a chronology of history concerning the Balkans and other regions. These records were not merely compilations of bureaucratic, administrative, and verbose data relating only to judicial, social, architectural, economic, and agricultural undertones. These facts are already explicitly stated in the Sijils themselves. It is, however, implicit facts which are of great importance and which are of enormous historical significance. The demographic structure is among the most complicated and disputed issues among the historians of religion and social sciences. Considering the objective data found in the Shari'ah Sijils, particularly to those about the most important district of the Ottomans in the Balkans, namely Manastir (today Bitola), the subject of demography will be analyzed as objectively as possible. Besides, in this article, both explicit and implicit facts will be studied.\n\nBased on the Ottomans&#39; archival materials, it has become incumbent upon the Ottoman or Balkan historian to investigate and analyze as objectively as possible the history of Ottoman rule in this region.
