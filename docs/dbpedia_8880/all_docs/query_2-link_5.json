        "text": "Ḥusaynid dynasty, the ruling dynasty of Tunisia from 1705 until the establishment of the Republic of Tunisia in 1957.\n\nAl-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, an Ottoman officer, was proclaimed bey in 1705 after the Algerians captured the former ruler of Tunis. He received legal recognition by the Ottoman sultan as governor (beylerbeyi) of the province and assured the survival of his line by promulgating a law of succession in 1710. Al-Ḥusayn conducted his affairs without Ottoman interference and with a measure of independence that allowed him to maintain separate treaties with France (1710; 1728), Great Britain (1716), Spain (1720), Austria (1725), and Holland (1728).\n\nIntermittent internal struggles for succession and difficulties with the French marred subsequent Ḥusaynid history. In 1756 the Algerians occupied Tunis and beheaded ʿAlī Bey (reigned 1735–56). Ḥammūda Bey (reigned 1782–1814) severed ties with Venice after its attacks on the Tunisian coastal towns of Sousse (1784) and La Goulette (1785). He also faced two Algerian invasions (1807; 1813) and a revolt of the Janissaries in 1811, which forced him to disband the elite Ottoman military corps periodically recruited to supplement the local armies.\n\nTheir European alliances made the Ḥusaynid beys subject to European pressures in the 19th century. Privateering, an important source of Tunisian revenue, was suppressed at European insistence in 1819; slavery and restrictions on Tunisian Jews were abolished under Aḥmad Bey (reigned 1837–55). The Ottoman government also sought to curb Tunisian autonomy, but Aḥmad Bey refused to pay tribute."
