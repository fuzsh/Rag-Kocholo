Between the two parts is a banner bearing the national motto: “Freedom, Order, Justice”. Finally, at the top of the coat of arms is a circle with a red border into which is inserted the red crescent and star appearing on the flag of Tunisia.",

        "text": "The coat of arms of Tunisia is divided into three parts. The upper part features a Carthaginian galley sailing on the sea (symbol of freedom). The lower part is itself divided vertically: on the left there is a black scale (symbol of justice) and on the right a black lion grasping a silver scimitar (symbol of order). Between the two parts is a banner bearing the national motto: “Freedom, Order, Justice” (Arabic: حرية، نظام، عدالة). Finally, at the top of the coat of arms is a circle with a red border into which is inserted the red crescent and star appearing on the flag of Tunisia.\n\nUntil the law of 1963, the background was azure (upper part), gold (lower dexter part) and gules (lower sinistral part). Subsequently, the gold color uniformly replaces them. Only the motto inscribed on the coat of arms appears in the 1959 Constitution."
