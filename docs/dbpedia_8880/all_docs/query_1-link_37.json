This is applied uniformly, including proper names that often appear in French transliteration such as Kheireddine or Hussein ben Ali, which are rendered Khayr al-­Din and Husayn ibn ʿAli. With weights and measures, I have opted for the awkward addition of the letter “s” at the end of the singular to facilitate reading for those unfamiliar with the Arabic language. Foreign terms are briefly defined in the text, with those frequently used also included in the glossary. The orthography of the archival records respects the original texts, which were written in a combination of classical and colloquial Arabic. All weights, measures, and prices are given according to the units utilized in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Though there was some regional variation, the approximate metric equivalents for Tunis are listed in the glossary. Unless otherwise specified, translations from Arabic and French sources are my own.\n\nxi\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nChronology\n\n1229–1574 1574 1591 1598–1610 1610–1635 1613–1631\n\n1631–1666 1666–1675 1675–1686 1686–1696 1690s 1702 1705–1735\n\n1735–1756 1756–1759\n\nHafsid dynasty 1517 Ottoman conquest of Egypt and Tilimsan (Algeria) 1556 Beginning of Ottoman rule in Tripoli Ottoman conquest of Tunisia Soldiers revolt; one of the deys is included on the diwan ʿUthman Dey Yusuf Dey Murad serves as bey, granted title of pasha; his descendants maintain the position of bey for the remainder of the century Hammuda Pasha ibn Murad Murad ibn Hammuda Bey ʿAli ibn Murad Bey Muhammad ibn Murad Bey Intermittent fighting with Algiers over rule in Tunis Ottoman envoy Ibrahim al-­Sharif arrives in Tunis to quell political problems 1702 Numerous political marriages between the Murad family and its dependents Husayn ibn ʿAli nominated dey and bey, with sultan’s recognition 1710 Governing position becomes hereditary 1711 Qaramanli family begins governing in Tripoli 1728 ʿAli Pasha divorces his cousin Hafsia, breaks with his uncle (Husayn ibn ʿAli), and makes a claim to govern ʿAli Pasha returns to Tunis from Algeria and governs 1740 Assassination of Husayn ibn ʿAli Muhammad al-­Rashid Bey returns from Algeria; assassinates cousin ʿAli Pasha\n\nxiii\n\n1756 (approx.)

I would like to thank Matthew J. Connelly for introducing me to the history of northern Africa and for his gracious and unfailing mentoring over the years. My understanding of Tunisia, its place in Ottoman provincial politics, and the French colonial world owe much to the erudition of Edmund (Terry) Burke III, Beshara Doumani, Omnia El Shakry, and Tyler Stovall, who generously contributed their time and advice towards improving this project. Omnia went out of her way on multiple occasions to show her encouragement. A number of friends and colleagues have read different portions of the book, providing valuable feedback: Julia Clancy-­Smith, Emily Gottreich, Robert Lang, Asma Moalla, and the late Donald Quataert. Julia Clancy-­ Smith in particular has been an unfailing proponent and intellectual role model for organizing the disparate details of Tunisia’s social history into a global context. My familiarity with the Tunisian archives and the particularities of Ottoman-­era terminology has greatly benefited from conversations with Fawzi al-­Mustaghanimi, who along with Mabrouk Jebahi provided welcome company at the archives and national library, as did Bacem Rzouga in Nantes. For sharing her own research in many conversations about Tunisia, my appreciation goes to Silvia Marsans-­Sakly, and to Ilhem Marzouki for her passion for women’s rights. Thanks are also due to Abdelhamid Henia, Sami Bergaoui, and the Diraset research group at the University of Tunis. There are many families in Tunisia who have adopted me over years of research and writing, opening their homes and providing much more than food, tea, company, and conversation. These include the late Nabiha Jerad, Jnaina and Rim Fitouri, Naima and Mahrez Chinguiti, and the Kheriji-­Elouafi family. Asma Moalla has been hospitable, encouraging, and generous with her time. A special note of gratitude to Ahmad al-­ Jalluli and Faycal Bey, who shared the history of their families. xv\n\nResearch for this project has been funded by the American Institute for Maghreb Studies, the Fulbright Foundation, the Fulbright Commission in Egypt, and the U.S. Department of Education through a Center for Arabic Study Abroad (CASA) III fellowship. Various portions were presented at conferences, where Brian Catlos, Kenneth Cuno, Nara Milanich, and Ruby Lal provided valuable feedback as co-­panelists and organizers. The staff at the National Archives in Tunis have been especially amicable and accommodating, as have those at the National Library and the Centre des Archives diplomatiques de Nantes (CADN) in France. Both James A. Miller and Thomas DeGeorges facilitated scholarly engagement with the Tunisian academic community when they served as directors of the American research center in Tunis (Centre d’études maghrébines à Tunis [CEMAT]), where Riadh Saadaoui has made many years of research more enjoyable. At Syracuse University, thanks to Joseph Stoll, who prepared the genealogies, drew the floor plan, and designed the maps, and colleagues such as Subho Basu and Norman Kutcher for their interest and insight. I am grateful to Jim Burr for his persevering support of this project and to Julia Clancy-­Smith and one anonymous reader for their careful reading of the manuscript and constructive responses. Nancy Moore greatly improved the quality of the prose with her meticulous reading. My parents, Jeff and Judy Aisen, have always supported and promoted my scholarly endeavors, as well as their timely completion. Finally, Mona and George not only have been a source of motivation and inspiration, but George meticulously read and commented on this manuscript a number of times, considerably improving the result, though all errors are my own.\n\nxvi\n\nWomen, Gender, and the Palace Households\n\nWomen, Gender, and the Palace Households in Ottoman Tunisia\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nFami lies, Households, and Palace Women i n Early Modern Court Culture\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the summer of 1776, the governor of Tunis celebrated the wedding of three of his children: his son Hammuda, his daughter Amina, and a second daughter (whose name is unknown).1 For months before that, women in the family, their domestics, and slaves were busy gathering the various articles for the trousseaus of the two brides, including diverse clothing and decorative linens, much of which was embroidered with silver thread. As they prepared for the days of festivities, 400 loaves of bread were baked, 1,800 ratls of honey were transformed into impressive quantities of zlabia (a sweet made of fried dough), and an additional 1,100 ratls of pastries were made from honey, dates, and almonds. Fruits, vegetables, and fowl were brought to the palace, and butchers were hired to slaughter nearly one hundred cows. Altogether, the expenses for these items totaled to at least 6,500 piasters and were intended as much for internal consumption as for public display.2 Through these marriages the governor—or bey, the Ottoman title that became the family surname—made a series of political alliances, just as his own marriage had done. Hammuda married the daughter of an important religious notable, Amina married her paternal cousin, and the second daughter married a prominent minister. The banquets celebrated the establishment of new households headed by these couples, publicly announced the connections between the governor’s family and the religious elite of the capital as they consolidated family ties, and secured loyalty among the palace inner circle. Just a few years earlier, the daughter of Austria’s Habsburg monarchs had celebrated her nuptials with the grandson and heir apparent of France’s Louis XV. This union between Marie-­Antoinette and the future Louis XVI was a strategic alliance, which was typical under the Bourbon dynasty (1589–1792), intended to secure the recent cooperation between these two erstwhile opponents. As the young bride and her 57-­carriage cortège traveled across Austria in April and May of 1770, she was feted with banquets, town celebrations, dance performances, and fireworks. After a highly ritualized border crossing, she was conducted in a large 3\n\nprocession to Strasbourg for the first official celebrations. Soldiers saluted as they entered the city through a triumphal arch constructed for the occasion and adorned with the arms of France and Austria. That evening, the city’s chief magistrate and cardinal held an official reception, ending in a display of fireworks and a public banquet with fountains of wine and roast oxen. Additional fireworks, flowers, and speeches commemorated the arrival of her convoy in a series of small villages as they journeyed northward, towards Louis XV’s royal hunting lodge. When she finally arrived at Versailles, her ladies in waiting dressed her in a gown made of the traditional bridal cloth of silver and adorned with masses of white diamonds, while the groom wore a gold suit that was valued at 64,000 livres. Approximately six thousand aristocratic spectators gathered to watch the family procession travel through the ornate salons of the palace. Following a religious ceremony in the king’s chapel, the signing of the marriage register, and additional formal introductions, the immediate family dined in a gilded, candle-­lit room under the eyes of thousands of guests seated in its surrounding lodges. The wedding entertainment continued for another nine days and nights of banquets, dancing, an opera, a ballet, and a display of fireworks for a crowd of around two hundred thousand guests.3 While ʿAli Bey (1759–1777) was the fourth consecutive governor of Tunis from the descendants of ʿAli al-­Turki, he certainly did not claim a royal pedigree to the tune of the French monarchs, nor could he boast of a palace to rival that of the Sun King. If he replicated on a smaller and less opulent scale European courtly norms, he was equally attentive to the precedents set by the imperial family in Istanbul because the governors consciously aspired to belong to an early modern political elite in which power was a family prerogative. At these courts, the conspicuous consumption demonstrated in bridal gowns, trousseaus, and lavish banquets was a claim to status, and marriage was a central institution for consolidating elite identity and securing diplomatic, economic, and social alliances. As governor, king, sultan, or shah, official political sinecure was the prerogative of men, yet the celebration of weddings is only one example of women’s contributions to diplomacy, palace economics, and the representation of power. For most early modern states, family was the most salient political model, and government administrations were structured as households, lending political weight to a multitude of domestic matters. From within their palaces, the wives, daughters, and concubines of rulers had an enviable position of access to the sovereign and the cen 4 Family Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nter of power. The modern distinction between public and private affairs is of little value in making sense of these familial states whether during the seventeenth-­century Dutch Golden Age or in France’s nineteenth-­ century Bourbon restoration and Napoleonic empires. While rarely governing in name, these “servants of the dynasty” organized and orchestrated political factions, promoted and opposed contenders to the throne, and engaged in foreign relations.4 The overlap of domestic and political spaces meant that the ruling households of the governors of Tunis and their counterparts within the Ottoman Empire shared a number of traits with the early modern dynasties of Mughal India (1526–1858), Qing China (1644–1911), Safavid (1501–1736) and Qajar Persia (1794–1925), and European courts such as the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. This book argues for the centrality of family to the political and social history of Tunisia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. While family as a metaphor of the state and patriarchal models of authority are certainly relevant, the focus of this book is on the ruling family and the transformation of its relationship to government, especially in the nineteenth century. This approach has the benefit of incorporating women into the historical narrative, demonstrating their contribution to the decision-­ making process and the legitimation of hereditary rule. As family dynasties were common across the Ottoman Empire, such an analysis permits comparison with different provinces and the imperial center as well as with the equally family-­based monarchies of Europe, India, and Asia. Comparisons with dynastic states are not meant to imply equivalence; though to a certain extent autonomously governed, Tunis was a province of the Ottoman Empire and not an independent nation-­state. As clearly delineated in the first chapter and reiterated throughout, Ottoman political, cultural, and intellectual references remained salient at least until the beginning of French colonialism. At the same time as the beys presented themselves in terms of early modern courtly references, they were acutely attentive to the local context, with both men and women striving to earn acceptance into provincial social circles. This is not to argue that they were nationalists or that they identified exclusively as Tunisian, as neither term held much weight during the period in question. As references to the courts of Mughal India and Bourbon France intimate, class identities carried more salience than ethnic or racial ones. This book situates the beys among numerous currents and understands their lives through the lens of multiple literatures: early modern court culture, Ottoman provincial history, feminism, colonialism, and consumerism.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nTunis, the Beys, and Ottoman Provincial Government The palace, with its dense population, luxury spending habits, and convenient location in the suburbs of the capital just a few kilometers from the port of Tunis, was a major economic hub within the province and its largest employer.5 Wedding festivities were an explicit incarnation of how courtly habits such as sustaining a community of servants, slaves, and domestics were dependent upon local resources: agriculture, transportation, and artisans. On a daily basis, each palace household required enough provisions to feed an entourage of dependents, personnel, and soldiers, with additional resources devoted to charities. Tunis—the provincial capital, and the Arabic name for the province— was a small domain of the Ottoman Empire in terms of both population and size. Its borders, defined roughly by mountains to the west and by the Mediterranean in the north and east, contained fertile agricultural land in the central plains and an expanse of desert in the south. With a population around one million in the eighteenth century, it was relatively urbanized, with towns such as Sfax, Monastir, Gabes, and Binzart sprinkled along the coasts (see Figure 0.1).6 The holy city of Qayrawan (founded in the seventh century) and the Zaytuna mosque in the capital were both centers of learning, attracting scholars from Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. Merchants and scholars followed the annual pilgrimage caravans westward for brief or extended stays in Cairo and the cities of the Hijaz. Religious brotherhoods such as the Shadhiliya, Qadiriya, Tijaniya, and Rahmaniya in its villages and towns connected Tunis to cities across the region from Fez, Tripoli, Constantine, and Algiers to Alexandria, and Cairo (see Figure 0.2). Ties between rural and pastoral communities transgressed any political borders between Algeria and Tunisia, as did extensive commerce and contraband.7 The temperate climate, diverse terrain, and extensive coastline allowed for a strong agricultural base, producing wheat, a variety of fruits and vegetables (particularly olives), fish, sponges, and coral.8 Active merchant communities in Tunis and Sfax exported agricultural products such as olive oil, wool, wheat, and coral to Alexandria, the island of Malta, Marseilles, and Livorno, and in the nineteenth century they went as far as Glasgow and Odessa. In addition, there was a considerable volume of illicit traffic towards Algeria and the Italian islands.9 Tunisians controlled the particularly lucrative trade in caps called fez (known locally as sha-\n\n6 Family Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nFigure 0.1. Map of the Ottoman Empire, circa 1600.\n\nshia) that were exported to the Ottoman ports of Izmir and Salonika and on occasion to Persia and the Balkans.10 Caravans traversing the Sahara brought slaves, spices, and gold.11 The small province was thus linked by commercial, intellectual, and religious ties to urban centers and international ports across the region. Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century, Tunis remained part of the sultan’s domains until the beginning of French colonial rule three hundred years later. By the late eighteenth century, its governors were able to balance their allegiance to the sultan and adherence to imperial policy with considerable autonomy in the management of quotidian affairs. The imperial government was largely decentralized, delegating provincial administration to local notables, whether to facilitate the incorporation of new territories, as was the case in the Balkans, or to compensate for limited communication with inaccessible and distant regions such as Mount Lebanon or Tunis.12 While in certain locales such as Jerusalem or Damascus a few families dominated social, political, and economic affairs alongside appointees from Istanbul, in others, such as Tripoli under the Qaramanli governors (1711–1835) and Egypt under Muhammad ʿAli Pasha (1805–1848) and his descendants in the nineteenth century, the governorship was a hereditary monopoly. The particular expression of provincial autonomy that coexisted with, or relied upon,\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nFigure 0.2. Map of the province of Tunisia.\n\nfamily rule that developed in Tunis was concordant with a system of Ottoman governing in which the prominence of local elites became “the rule in practically every part of the Ottoman empire.”13 The eminent families that made up the ruling classes in the provinces often emulated the lifestyles of the sultan and his ministers in Istanbul, building palaces, making expensive charitable donations, and extending their household networks into commercial activities.14 This was not viewed as a breach of etiquette or usurpation of imperial authority as long as a balance was maintained between political stability and respect for the imperial order. But the eruption of revolts, heated factional disputes, armed confrontation, or shifts in regional or international politics provided impetus for the reassertion of central authority. This was demonstrated when a succession dispute led to the replacement of the Qaramanlis of Tripoli in 1835 and when the sultan dispatched foreign minister Fuad Pasha to Mount Lebanon in response to the prolonged communal violence of 1860. Where Tunis departs from such patterns is the extent to which one family monopolized the provincial government—and not just wealth or social capital in the province—for two centuries. Their officially sanctioned longevity allowed for a strong association between the ruling family and the government. This dynasty in Tunis began with Husayn ibn ʿAli al-­Turki (1705–1735), a soldier whose political career dates to the late seventeenth century. At that moment, control of the capital was shared between the military, officials nominated from Istanbul, and the descendants of a previous governor. Husayn ibn ʿAli climbed the ranks, serving in the entourage of important governmental figures and promoted to be head of the cavalry, positions that allowed him to establish connections to the governor’s family, and the military. Though some contemporary sources believed that he was Corsican, others said he was the son of a Greek man who was successful at assimilating into the provincial elite, becoming a “Turk by trade” or a professional Ottoman.15 The 1690s were marked by political and military turmoil since internal feuding destabilized the government and Algerian troops invaded the province to quell the situation and install an ally in government. Ibn ʿAli combined political acumen with military skills to defend the capital from being brought under Algerian suzerainty and assert his authority. A military council selected ibn ʿAli as bey, a position subsequently confirmed by the sultan, and in 1710, he was able to make the position hereditary. His descendants still served as provincial governors when France occupied the\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nFigure 0.3.

By the late eighteenth century, the governor of Tunis and his family had firmly established their residence in the town of Bardo, the seat of power that they inherited from their Hafsid predecessors (1229–1574). A few miles from the capital, the private home of the ruling family was also the center of political life in the province (see Figure 0.3). It often included at least three generations, maternal relatives, and greater degrees of extended family with each generation. The palace was staffed by washerwomen, instructors, nannies, doctors, guarded military contingents, and an elite slave corps. The walled palace grounds with five turreted watchtowers enclosed a small city where numerous palace retainers and employees had their homes, all of which benefited from the Bardo markets and mosque. Entering the city, one European noted that we pass between the sentries of the entrance-­gate, and have before us a long, straight road, just broad enough for one carriage. Imposing marble palaces rise on the left, built of costly material, partly in the Renaissance, partly in the Oriental style. [. . .] These are the palaces of the princes of the reigning house, and of the minister. [. . .] And opposite these magnificent residences, a few steps from their gates, we see a long\n\n10\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nrow of common shops with an arcade in front, a true Eastern bazaar for the inhabitants of this town of palaces.16\n\nWhile the immediate family and their entourages reached around fifteen hundred, the total population living at Bardo may have been closer to four thousand at its peak.17 Bardo contained a tribunal presided over by the bey that functioned as the highest court in the province. To accommodate public access to its chamber with the intimate affairs of the state, the palace consisted of a series of guarded entrances and separate courtyards. The primary entrance was flanked by cannons and wide enough for carriages to pass through into the main courtyard where litigants awaited the bey’s justice. As an accessible part of the palace interior, its staircase, adorned with marble lions, became an emblematic reference for palace visits (see Figure 0.4). Only those on official business could pass through a second great gate, where some attendants of the court were visible, and we were obliged to get out [of our carriage]. We walked through this gate, and entered a high arched way. [. . .] This led into a much cleaner and more elegant court, ornamented with green glazed tiles, with paintings, and with various coloured marbles; in the midst of\n\nFigure 0.4. The first courtyard and the lion staircase, undated postcard, author’s private collection.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nwhich sprang up a fountain. A broad arcade with high but simple pillars ran round it.18\n\nAs foreign visitors took care to detail, the costly marble used to pave the courtyard and its surrounding columns were part of the presentation of grandeur, as were the decorative tiles adorning its walls. Wood lattice friezes hung below its vaulted ceilings, just as ornamental sculptured plaster and calligraphy were engraved over doorways. This careful attention to décor was featured in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, where works of art, architecture, design, and luxury items such as Chinese lacquer contributed to monarchical legitimation, reflecting how the Versailles Hall of Mirrors, with its marble walls, painted ceiling, bronze decorations, and mirror-­clad arched windows, actualized royal investments in the palace as spectacle.19 Early modern rulers used their wealth to distinguish themselves from their subject populations, legitimizing their authority in elaborate royal ceremonials. Royal weddings formed a perfect occasion to mobilize the resources of royal families, dressed in their finest and serving vast buffets. As the anecdote about Marie-­ A ntoinette demonstrates, these performances were staged for the benefit of notables, elites, and the public hoping to get a glimpse of the dauphine as her carriages passed through the countryside. Despite the comparable opulence of European ruling houses, even those who recognized that Bardo was “a Versailles, or rather a Windsor of Tunis” still insisted that it was a “thoroughly Oriental palace.”20 The luxury of the Ottoman harem fascinated Europeans so that the harem became a sign of difference, and Bardo presented the “picture of oriental scenery.”21\n\nThe Harem as Palace Household Alongside its public and political purposes, the palace was a residential space. According to most definitions, the inhabitants at Bardo constituted one family. The governing families all shared a single ancestor (ʿAli al-­ Turki and later Husayn ibn ʿAli), constituting a lineage, and they all lived at Bardo, though in separate apartments. Yet the concept of the household, which comprises all the residents under one roof, is more useful for understanding domestic relations at the palace with its numerous nonkin and multiple generations. Organized into the smaller conjugal units that iterated a typical family structure, they were all financially dependent on the bey and his access to the government treasury for monthly stipends and provisions. The family model is a useful way to understand the pater 12\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nnal authority that the governors exercised over their male and female relations, ministers, and the general population and the filial respect the latter demonstrated in return. Patriarchal structures provided women an arena in which they could contribute to family finances through their access to resources and labor power. The marriages of the bey’s daughters sealed social alliances and provided occasions to demonstrate his benevolence and largesse. Family hierarchies were evoked as a metaphor for government organization. Terms such as father, uncle, or brother were used to denote respect, deference, affection, and not exclusively blood relations, so that defining the contours of the family is a messy task. Familial ties were created through naming, residence, or sharing breast milk. For example, when the governor Husayn Bey (1824–1835) married a wealthy widow, her son from a previous marriage, ʿAllala, moved to the palace with her. ʿAllala was raised alongside Husayn’s other sons and treated as their equal, for example, receiving the same stipends and clothing, and archival documents list him as their “brother.” Though not a descendant through the male line, palace accountants referred to him as ʿAllala Bey, a title reserved for the direct line of male descent within the family. His marriage to one of Husayn’s daughters, Hafsia, in 1821 confirmed these indices of filiation and reaffirmed his proximity to the ruling family.22 Mamluks, the elite palace slaves, could also marry into the governing family, despite their subservient origins. Taken from the empire’s borderland regions such as Greece, Albania, Moldavia, and the Caucasus or in maritime raids in the nearby Mediterranean, these slaves were brought to Tunis as children, raised in the palace, and trained for military or administrative careers, providing contingents of the palace guards and the majority of its ministerial personnel. Female slaves could similarly become the wives and concubines of the beys. While only a few slaves sealed their ties to the family though marriage, the majority were treated comparably to palace children with whom they grew up. Male slaves occasionally took the names of their patrons, and female slaves were provided with dowries when they married. The incorporation of slaves into household structures was a relatively common early modern practice. Well-­off families in the capital and prominent landowners often purchased slaves from the trans-­Saharan trade to work in agriculture or as domestics. Their labor contributed to the functioning of these households, and both in Tunis and beyond they were an important sign of conspicuous consumption and a mark of status. Slaves staffed the upper echelons of the Ottoman military and filled a\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nnumber of prominent ministerial positions in Istanbul and the provinces. In Bengal, if not other parts of Mughal India as well, most elite families owned slaves whom they raised as kin.23 Slaves could be given as gifts, creating ties between households, a practice that we will see later was also current in Tunis. Though the discipline of history traditionally privileged the ruling elites as agents of change, to the detriment of the working classes, rural communities, and economically or socially marginal groups, such a narrow perspective routinely excluded women from the functioning of the state. In this respect, an exploration of the governors of Tunis as a family can both incorporate subaltern populations and contribute to the elaboration of women’s history. Palace women were social, economic, or political actors from within their homes where they managed a large staff, conducted business with artisans and skilled workers, and distributed alms to the poor. As power built upon physical proximity to the sovereign, a privilege allocated to select ministers and palace women, gender segregation facilitated women’s access to the center of state. Though they rarely left the palace, women were active politicians on a variety of levels, contributing to social welfare and increasing the prestige of the dynasty.24 As servants of the dynasty, or diplomatic wives, these women exercised power in various informal ways. Feminist scholars rightly insist that women’s political activities have often gone unrecognized as a result of the modern gendering of a public sphere as masculine and the concomitant relegation of women to an apolitical domestic space. Their engagement in government, commercial activities, and social welfare problematizes the stark separation of public and private space and furthers the process of locating a specifically modern genealogy for this division. Though Middle East studies has come a long way in recognizing the importance of domestic space and how the lives of elite women elucidate economic, cultural, and political questions, the study of political power in Tunisia remains limited to the study of men.25 Royal palaces shared more than the taste for extravagant furnishings, with elements of architectural design such as multiple doorways and sequential courtyards to distinguish between outer and inner spaces. The arrangement of space communicated the power of the sovereign and his distance from the profane, even when his quarters were not called a harem. The women’s quarters at Edo Castle of Japan’s Tokugawa shogunate (1600–1868) were located in the Great Interior, separate from the outer spaces, where ceremonies were held, and the middle interior, where 14\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nadministrative affairs were handled. Confucian divisions of gender at the courts of Qing China (1644–1911) and Korea’s Choso˘n dynasty (1392– 1910) were symbolized by their inner and outer spaces with women’s residences in the interior facilitating their access to the sovereign and their ability to intercede in factional politics.26 For India’s Mughal emperors, gender segregation itself was a sign of prestige and a claim to imperial status. Seclusion was one way in which Mughal women “were of critical importance in the establishment of imperial traditions and imperial grandeur, indeed an intrinsic part of the becoming of a (grand) monarchy.”27 Royal women in both Muslim and non-­Muslim dynasties occupied separate spaces from men, as gender segregation was a common feature of hereditary governments in which the sovereign and royal family were considered sacred. The depoliticization of domestic life was suggested by Europeans imagining that the harem was filled with beautiful, passionate women who typified the sensuality associated with the Ottoman Empire. Similar to scholars and amateur Orientalists touring Istanbul or Cairo, Europeans in Tunis did not hesitate to project elaborate fantasies onto the lives of Bardo’s women.28 They had “no other way to pass their time than at the pleasure of the harem”; in other words they were “preoccupied only by imagining and putting to practice anything that can arouse, sustain, and increase the mutual passion of the two sexes.” Alongside these tantalizing scenarios, life in the harem was seen as a “sort of perpetual imprisonment that would be torture for a European woman.”29 Its ultimate symbol of difference for Europeans meant that the harems were depicted as “prisons lined with gold.”30 While only the wealthy could provide separate quarters for women, Europeans mainly socialized with the upper classes, whose lives they took as representative of all women. In contrast to the palace, the average family was monogamous and had fewer children. The typical home contained only a single generation, and size limitations meant that gender segregation was neither possible nor practical. Since at least the nineteenth century, suspicions about what went on within the family have concerned colonial bureaucrats, Orientalist scholars, and Western feminists preoccupied with the plight of Arab and Muslim women. The abuse, repression, or general subordination to a husband or father justified generations of paternalistic concern from missionaries, feminists, or proponents of colonial expansion.31 The enduring image from travelers’ depictions of women’s lives has continued to inform popular understandings of the harem as an instrument of the sequestration and subservience\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nthat typified family life, Islamic law, or Islam, alternately constraining women’s rights and summarized in the trope of the prison.32 Women’s status within the family (and within the domain of personal status or family law) remains integral to scholarly studies of Muslim women and a prevalent theme of Western liberal discourses and human rights agendas in their approaches to the Arab and Muslim world.33 The family is considered a microcosm of larger society and representative of cultural, racial, or religious differences, making a better understanding of the complexity of family life, even among the elite, important for illustrating how women were and can be complicit in and benefited from patriarchal structures. A comparison across geographic regions makes it evident that such patriarchal bargains are not specific to Islam, regardless of its specifically local iterations. If the trope of woman as victim no longer informs scholarship on Muslim women, there remains an aversion to serious analysis of family life, particularly within the study of Tunisia.\n\nFamily History One of the three marriages in 1776 united the governor’s daughter Amina to her paternal cousin. Orientalists and colonial-­era ethnographers later viewed this arrangement as the typical Arab marriage, in sharp contrast with the exogamy of Western, European, or Christian family practices. Even radical studies of the family as an agent of vast economic and social change have been quick to presume a divergence between Western (or northwestern) Europe and the archetypical Middle Eastern family based on scant empirical data.34 Over the past few generations, scholarship on the family in the Middle East has aimed to discredit such a stark dichotomy and the association between Middle Eastern families and polygamy, high rates of repudiation, and the central role of kinship to culture and tradition. While initially informed by quantitative approaches to describing family life and European or American models, newer studies of the family stress its potential for informing global analysis of social and political questions. To access the importance of the family, scholars insist on broadening the definition of kinship to recognize that in much of the world, households included extended family and nonkin, such as slaves, boarders or servants, wet nurses, and nannies. Pioneering work has been done in Latin America, with scholars arguing for the relevance of family as a social institution. The efficacy of family connections in facilitating access to resources was particularly the case among the elite, for 16\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nwhom “kin networks were a fundamental basis of economic and political power.”35 Instead of arguing for a particular family structure as the motor of progress, recent studies reiterate that family is relevant to state building and to the understanding of social, economic, political, and cultural phenomena in a variety of global contexts.36 This may offer particular advantages for the study of the Middle East, as an analysis of the family can build upon scholarship on Islam, gender, and modernity, connecting macro- and microprocesses and combining materialist and discursive frameworks.37 Alan Duben and Cem Behar were early pioneers in debunking the myth of Middle Eastern difference by demonstrating that in Turkey, the typical family was small and monogamous, often consisting of a marital couple and their children, though there were exceptions among the elite.38 Studies on the family in Tunis similarly reject the notion that the plurality of marital practices can be subsumed under one typology. Leïla Blili Temime’s work contextualizes the role of tradition and Islam to counter Orientalist images of the “Muslim family” as inimical to European ones. She argues that while polygamy was rare even among the elite, it served reproductive purposes, the demands of agricultural subsistence, or demographic imbalances and was not meant to fulfill men’s sexual desires.39 Scholars concur that class endogamy was common, as were repeat marriages between the same two families, though patrilineal-­kin marriages were not in the majority among elite families.40 By rejecting the negative associations of Middle Eastern or Arab difference, these studies offer important demographic data to emphasize the similarities between family structures in the Middle East and Europe. Comparing the practices of urban elites across geographic regions similarly demonstrates the significance of class on family life. Hardly an anomaly, marriages within the family, including among first cousins, were a regular occurrence in the British royal family up to the era of Queen Victoria (1837–1901) and even more frequent among the Habsburgs. Other features, such as marriage or concubinage with slaves, common in the Ottoman Empire and its provincial courts, were normative under India’s Mughal dynasty. A number of studies on working-­class or bourgeois families allow for comparison across socioeconomic and rural-­urban divides. Middle-­class Damascene women constituted a significant form of human capital and participated in various investment strategies that helped their families navigate political and economic change. When rural Mount Lebanon was hit by economic hardship, strategic adaptation occurred at the family and\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nnot at the individual level. Once women were allowed to work outside the home, their incomes helped preserve family land, so that land ownership became a more important sign of masculinity and family honor than did women’s seclusion. Whether the wives of enterprising Cairene merchants who participated in their husbands’ businesses around 1600, or women’s agricultural labor among peasants in nineteenth-­century Egypt, sexual divisions of labor did not preclude women’s contributions as specific individual roles fluctuated in response to economic demands.41 Even among lower-­class families in occupied Palestine or Cairo’s shantytowns, women have found ways to invest their gold in the education of their children or microcredits to support their families.42 Though patriarchal, Islamic institutions have proven flexible in practice, particularly regarding women’s rights and family life.43 Saba Mahmood’s hypothesis that feminist scholarship has been constrained by the liberal emphasis on the individual, obfuscating instances of women’s agency within their families, is certainly worth considering for the early modern period.44 Viewing women within the context of their family reveals it as a space of opportunities as well as limitations, as it was for men constrained by responsibilities and obligations towards their wives and children. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that there was no single standard family model or blueprint for gender relations, thanks to the dynamism of family structures particularly in response to major processes such as the incorporation of local economies into global capitalist markets. Such instances of women’s economic activities argue for the need to reconsider the standard narrative of political and economic change in Tunisia’s nineteenth century and the view that women were marginal. If less can be determined about working-­class or rural women, among the upper classes, women participated in commercial activities and protected family resources by preserving the integrity of family property through the strategic use of religious endowments.45 The palace offers a telling example of the commercial relations and labor of wealthy women who filled their time with productive activities such as “sewing, knitting, washing, or ironing.”46 They owned rental and commercial properties and agricultural estates, and whether managing these through a representative or commissioning luxury items from local artisans, women at Bardo were involved in a range of economic sectors. In fact, at royal courts across the globe, women contributed to the family business of governing by forging alliances with political factions, advising the sovereign, and participating\n\n18\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nin the spectacles of consumption that reaffirmed the class status of their dynasties.47 Far from being a particularity that distinguished the Middle East, the social, economic, and political importance of the family holds true across the globe, just as the overlap between family and politics was not purely an attribute of monarchies or empire. While hereditary sovereigns were often represented as fatherly figures, modern nation-­states have also deployed images of paternal concern and meddled in family affairs. By the end of the nineteenth century, bourgeois family ideals informed debates about gender roles and normative sexuality, becoming a central site for defining modernity and national identity in Europe and its colonies. The Dutch policed domestic arrangements in attempts to ensure that proper racial and class inheritance would be transmitted by the women raising its future citizens, while in the British Empire, “the Victorian family came to symbolize modernity, economic solvency and the rise and success of the nation-­state.”48 Though the specific definitions of the ideal family differed, intellectuals in the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Persia expressed their ideas about social reform in terms of gender roles and family metaphors. Debates about companionate marriage or women’s education focused on the family to represent imperial, national, or racial identities.49 India offers but one well-­known instance of how women were emblematic of progress and became iconic figures of an authentically national culture during the anticolonial movement.50 Though the examination of women’s status as a narrative of social problems and attack on Hindu culture were informed by national aspirations and the constraints of British colonial rule, the controversies they generated become global events.51 While purporting to deal with women’s place in the family or the nation, these conversations reveal much about masculinity, men’s desire to assert control over the family, and the place of the family within discourses of modernity.52 That such intellectual conversations about family and modernity crisscrossed Europe, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean should be of little surprise when Italian anarchists ran schools and theater troupes in Egypt, and Iranians and Indians worked as translators for European Orientalist scholars.53 While they held divergent beliefs about government, civilization, and women’s status, they often agreed about the centrality of the family to social reform. Deliberations over women’s rights focused on their situation within the family, making the home an object of scrutiny, and domestic practices a way to compare nations, civilizations, or cul-\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\ntures. Framing these transformations as a global experience and not as something uniquely imposed by colonial rule contributes to decentering modernity from its relation with European experiences while incorporating the insights of subaltern studies and postcolonial theory.54 The modern understandings of the state, and republican states in particular, erroneously envision it as entirely distinct from hereditary rule and familial models of authority, concerned only with public affairs and not the private matters of family life. In Tunis, the position of the governing families underwent significant transformation over the course of the early modern era, from the consolidation of family authority to their marginalization from the center of power. Despite the physical separation of their suburban palace from the crowds of the capital, the Bardo family was an agent of modernization and not a passive casualty, even if efforts to organize government institutions reduced the informal role of the ruling family within the bureaucracy. In the long run, the relation between ruling families and the state proved responsive to external forces, whether local or global, often to the detriment of dynastic authority. In Japan, Persia, and the Ottoman Empire, extensive reforms were undertaken in the nineteenth century, including administrative reorganization, investments in education, and experiments with representative government. For Tunisia, such projects were initiated around the middle of the nineteenth century and continued under French rule, and so colonial modernity was less a point of rupture than a reorientation of the process. Across the Middle East, in its urban centers and rural villages, women contributed to the financial security of their families through labor, production, inheritance, and investment. They were prominent actors in the social networks that began in the home. Far from stagnant, the attributes of domestic life shifted according to stages in the life cycle and in relation to external change. By the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, bourgeois reformers and nationalists began to view the family as contained within the home, reconceptualizing it as an apolitical, private space. While many argued that women’s role in child rearing was a patriotic duty, this gendering of the private sphere had the effect of depoliticizing women’s lives. The study of the family explains local responses to global processes and their impact on women’s lives and gender roles. Following the ruling family in Tunis over two centuries as a study in political history offers an example of its consolidation, prominence, and later displacement and demonstrates the malleability of family structures and the transformation of its role in government. 20\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nWhy Global? This book situates the women at Bardo within early modern court culture and elite family history to expand the scope of studies on Tunisia beyond the nation-­state framework. It places scholarship on Tunisian women within the dynamic fields of feminist theory, women and gender studies, and colonial studies. Adopting a comparative context furthers recent efforts to globalize the Ottoman Empire and understand the relation between the Middle East and Europe through more than colonial binaries, as suggested by Clancy-­Smith and Khuri-­Makdisi. Tunis, like Alexandria, was a Mediterranean coastal city with a cosmopolitan population that included Europeans long before foreign occupation. Throughout much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, any number of Italians and French could be found at court, not to mention Ottoman Greeks, Albanians, and Moldavians. Their interactions, shifting alliances, and contributions to elite culture have often been disregarded by nationalist scholarship, with its reliance on immutable ethnic categories, whether in the Balkans, Turkey, or Arab countries. Conceptualizing the ruling class to include those who lived and worked in the palace, as well as those who maintained social and commercial relations with the governing families, avoids binding individuals by national or racial origins and allows these identities to alternate with religious, corporate, village, or family bonds. Similarly, the complex nature of the palace households and an appreciation for all the diverse individuals who composed them demonstrates how they interacted with one another and the ease with which they adopted or adapted to local practices. I emphasize the Ottoman context to counter two trends that dominate Tunisian history: one equating autonomy with national independence, and the other insisting on the specificity of North Africa as distinct from the Middle East. The impetus to view the province as independent of the sultan has a largely colonial genealogy. After the 1830 conquest of Algeria, French consuls, out of expedience, consistently treated the governors of Tunis as sovereigns. Though this occasionally contradicted English diplomacy in the region, the French preferred negotiating with a local governor over dealing with the sultan. The insistence upon the autonomy of the province fueled claims of the empire’s weakness, implying that Istanbul was unable to control much of its territory. Colonial-­era scholars similarly separated Tunis from Ottoman politics under the premise that hereditary governorship failed to correspond to the classical model of provincial governance.\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nNationalist historiography in Tunisia tends to view the Ottoman period as an inconsequential or irrelevant preface to the establishment of the proto nation-­state under Husayn ibn ʿAli. This includes examination of the progressive “deturkification” of the government after the seventeenth century, replaced by supposedly Tunisian elements.55 Popular histories of Tunisia similarly circumscribe much of the Ottoman period, renaming it after the governing families in the province as “the Muradite state” and “the Husaynite state.”56 The emphasis on provincial-­cum-­national dynasties opposes a Tunisian identity to an alien Turkish one, blaming the latter for European colonization or underdevelopment. Privileging colonial relations, European historical trajectories, and narrow definitions of modernity, Tunisian history is defined by its lack of capitalism and as a mutation of European models, in which Tunisians themselves have little agency.57 Such focus on the nation contributes to the denigration of Ottoman political culture, ignores the rich cultural amalgam among the elite, and obscures the depth of commercial, religious, and intellectual connections to other parts of the empire. When studies of Tunisia go beyond nation-­state borders, they often include the neighboring North African states of Algeria and Morocco under the rubric of “the Maghrib.” The populations of all three contained a majority of Muslims, and were predominantly Arab, yet this demographic basis belies the specificity of the numerous Imazighen (Berber) populations in Algeria and Morocco and their struggle to claim a visible role in politics and national culture. If they were all part of a single polity in the century following the initial Arab conquest and again from around the tenth through thirteenth centuries (under the Fatimid, Zirid, and Almohad dynasties) and later colonized by the French, they did not constitute a coherent space since political borders have existed between these countries for much of the last eight hundred years. Most scholars recognize that the concept of the Middle East grew out of imperial interests and Cold War policies, but there is less scrutiny about the supposed unity and homogeneity of North Africa or the Maghrib.58 Though there are exceptions, edited volumes and textbooks written on Ottoman and Middle East history often concentrate on Turkey and Anatolia, Greater Syria, and Egypt, to the detriment of everything to its west.59 Without explicating why to prioritize the rubric of the Maghrib, the focus on the shared histories of these three North African nation-­ states seems to concentrate on colonial experiences.60 In addition, it is worth examining the impact of French colonial rule on other Arab countries, namely, Syria and Lebanon, not to mention French colonies in 22\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nWest Africa and Southeast Asia, or neocolonial states in general. Placing Tunisia in a global context does not ignore the relevance of its North African neighbors but takes a necessary step in decentering colonial experiences from the unfolding of modernity and the defining of scholarly paradigms. Despite a set of common Ottoman and regional references, there was certainly much about the elite of Tunis that was unique to its geographic and economic position and political culture. While it shared elements of elite culture with other Ottoman provinces, Muslim states, and European monarchs, this borrowing did not preclude the development of specifically local practices. Tunisia was unique within the Ottoman context to the extent that the sultan sanctioned hereditary government for almost two centuries under the descendants of Husayn ibn ʿAli. They maintained this privilege much longer than the Qaramanlis in Tripoli and for generations before the ascent of Muhammad ʿAli Pasha in Egypt, despite profound political and economic transformations, both local and regional. While the governors of Egypt also embarked upon a considerable reform program in the nineteenth century, Tunis was the only part of the Ottoman Empire to experiment with constitutional rule in the 1860s. The comparative analysis of elite women’s political participation illustrates that dynastic power in the early modern world was built through more than a male line of descent or titles to office. Palaces were complex domestic spaces, the site of economic activity, and the seat of political power, so that at the highest levels of state and empire, family and marriage were political. Though nation-­states initially sought to exclude women from political office, reducing them to representations of national culture, family remains relevant to modern political ideologies. The ideal family serves as a model for debates over gender roles, national identity, and a range of social questions. Taking a global approach to the transformation of relations between ruling families and the state in Tunis shows the relevance of palace families to political histories, includes women and gender in narratives about male political culture, and frames modernization as a global process and one that is relevant to the Ottoman and French empires, the early modern and colonial world.\n\nContent, Sources, and Structure The book is divided into three sections that combine chronological and thematic approaches, beginning in Part I with the period from the Ottoman conquest to the early eighteenth century. The three chapters form\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\ning Part II deal with the mid-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and the final section covers the reform era of the mid- to late nineteenth century and the beginning of colonial rule. Each chapter engages different themes that locate family politics at the forefront of a comparative history of court cultures, in their deployment of marriage alliances, the practice of gender segregation, elite women’s political participation, paternalist practices of government, and the invented traditions of colonial rule. The earlier chapters illustrate how the family established itself within the province through a set of common early modern elite practices. Part III traces intellectual deliberations about government and women’s contribution to family status that accompanied the process of modernization. Instead of viewing the period as merely a precursor to colonial occupation and the nation-­state as emphasized in precolonial or nationalist histories, this narrative moves away from images of stagnation and dependency to insist upon dynamism. Finally, framing the transformations to the palace in Tunis as typical of early modern courts helps locate modernity as a global process. Chapter 1 (with the Introduction, forming Part I) examines the common dynastic strategy of marriage alliances and more specifically their role in the expansion and consolidation of Ottoman power. These approaches were adopted by provincial elite in the empire’s urban centers, such as Aleppo and Cairo, leading to the integration of Ottoman administrators and local notables. In Tunis as well, family connections and marriage alliances were central to the establishment of authority and its extension beyond the capital, creating political continuity between the two major ruling houses of the Ottoman period. Beginning with the Ottoman-­Habsburg rivalry in the western Mediterranean and the Ottoman conquest of Tunisia in the sixteenth century, the chapter provides a cursory overview of the first century and a half of Ottoman rule, positing that the familial is political. By focusing on marriage as an element of state building in which the entire family participated, the chapter lays the groundwork for recognizing how women acted through the family in the development and consolidation of political authority. Finally, it considers how a contest over succession (a common source of dynastic strife) led to the mobilization of household networks. A number of insights on family relations are provided by the prominent eighteenth-­century Tunisian chronicler Muhammad Saghir ibn Yusuf (1691–1771), in a work that so smoothly integrates family, marriage, government, and the major events of the era as to show the futility of separating family from politics.61 24\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nPart II of the book (Chapters 2–4) explores the nature of family rule and women’s contribution to social status, economic activities, and public welfare. Concentrating on the family who governed Tunis during this period, Chapter 2 describes basic household structures, the diversity of palace personnel, and the organizational role of the household to portray the overlap between domestic and administrative functions. Offering a microhistory of food and diet, a material culture of life within the palace, I rely on a corpus of approximately sixty registers of palace treasury expenses compiled annually between 1755 and 1843. These volumes offer an inside perspective on the functioning of royal households and are an important source for re-­creating the daily lives of the palace’s inhabitants.62 These records are supplemented by the bey’s personal spending accounts covering much of the nineteenth century and about thirty account books dealing with categories of expenses such as troops, uniforms, provisioning of guests at the palace, and inventories of food and jewelry. Food played a prominent role in early modern social life, when royalty from Persia to England distinguished themselves from commoners through sumptuous feasts or the construction of elaborate sugar sculptures and wedding cakes. This chapter uses food and diet to suggest similarities between the governing families of Tunis, local elites, and other Ottoman urbanites in Istanbul and Damascus. Chapter 3 presents gender segregation as a key organizational principle of palace architecture and a sign of power common in Qing China, Mughal India, and Safavid Persia. In each case, far from marginalizing women, the spatial configuration of the palace gave astute and determined mothers, wives, and concubines the opportunity to influence dynastic history. Certain women such as sultan Suleiman’s wife Hurrem, the Qing empress dowager Cixi, or Marie-­A ntoinette of France attained enough power to become the targets of the political opposition. Women in Tunis also contributed to palace factions and occasional rivalries; these political and diplomatic activities are discussed in relation to the hierarchies of harem life and women’s daily routines. The chapter suggests preliminary conclusions about the similarities and differences between women’s lives and family structures within the palace and in the province of Tunis, showing their relevance to women’s history more generally. While ceremony, display, and conspicuous consumption featured prominently among early modern court protocols, wealth was also utilized towards charitable ends. In the Ottoman case, spending not only meant privileged access to luxury goods and competitive gardening but also represented the renovation of urban landscapes through the con\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nstruction of elaborate public facilities and pious endowments. In Aleppo or Cairo, elite Muslim women utilized their wealth philanthropically and contributed to the status and prestige of their families. Chapter 4 continues the discussion of palace expenditures to illustrate how networks of distribution were used to create patronage, provide public services, and allow the ruling family in Tunis to interact with the local population to alleviate poverty and perform the Islamic duty of charity. The chapter combines the palace financial records with those of the tax-­collecting expeditions and endowment records from the national archives and the ministry of state domains. It portrays how family events such as weddings and circumcisions were opportunities for hosting banquets, passing out money and gifts, and building upon patriarchal models of masculine financial responsibility through these acts of benevolence. The two chapters of Part III concentrate on the nineteenth century by considering the political implications of European colonialism, intellectual exchange, and increased travel in and around the Mediterranean. Improvements in transportation and communication coincided with the Ottoman reform program (the Tanzimat), the Arab cultural renaissance (or nahda), constitutional rule, and colonial occupation, all of which transformed the position of the family as the state modernized. Chapter 5 examines how the shifting balance of global power placed new restraints on the governors of Tunis, their families, and the familial nature of rule. The Ottoman reform era, the Arab intellectual renaissance, and the experiment with constitutional government in 1861 progressively altered the relation between family and government in Tunis. As bureaucrats and intellectuals reconceptualized the nature of government and the responsibilities of the sovereign, they defined legitimacy in terms of reason or merit. Particularly through the modernization of the financial administration, these ministers sought to respect the family position in government while ensuring that the state was less invested in competitive displays of wealth. In the process, they transformed spending from an asset of governance into a sign of individualism that threatened communal security. Over the second half of the nineteenth century, accounting practices underwent a series of revisions, particularly visible in the extant financial records. Chapter 5 utilizes a dozen registers from the Tunisian archives covering two- to five-­year periods from 1840 to 1860 and materials about the constitution and lists of stipends. Though members of the foreign diplomatic community could claim only varying degrees of local knowledge, Chapters 5 and 6 incorporate archives of the French foreign min 26\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nistry (in Nantes and Manuba) to illustrate French policy in the province from the conquest of Algeria in 1830 through the first decades of colonial rule in the 1880s and 1890s. Chapter 6 is situated in the first decades of French rule in Tunisia (1881–1956), which coincided with a resurgence in European imperial competition. While the republican government distanced itself from the spectacles of consumption that stigmatized its monarchical predecessors, it created new venues for the dramatization of state power epitomized by the Universal Exposition of 1889. An elaborate festival hosted in Paris by the ministries of commerce, industry, and the colonies, the fair celebrated science, technology, and consumption while formulating a popular racism based on a hierarchical ordering of peoples. Depicting the French empire in familial terms as an expression of paternal concern for colonial children justified colonial domination and reconciled the seeming contradictions between republicanism and imperialism. Since Tunisia was the first major colony of France’s Third Republic (1871–1940), this chapter suggests how practices elaborated in Tunisia, such as the reliance on hereditary government and the creation of royal traditions, served as templates for patriarchal rule in French Morocco (1912–1956) and Syria and Lebanon (1920–1946). While the exposition underscores how material means continued to represent state power and the centrality of colonialism to modern national identities, it demonstrates that the disentangling of family from political life was a complex process on both sides of the colonial divide. In the critique of France’s role in colonial Tunisia, I build on French colonial history and the notion of republican imperialism as well as the history of women, gender, and the family in French political life in the nineteenth century. Family ideals were the topic of Orientalist justifications for colonialism and the site of modern reform projects, yet empire itself was based on patriarchy. Hardly a remnant of early modern governance, in the French case, the civilizing project continued to be a central part of French national identity until 1962. The accumulation of colonial territories contained elements of competitive consumption and display, reminiscent of the material basis of monarchies, and both the French and the British invested in ceremony as they invented traditions in the colonies. The triumph of a bourgeois republic was thus facilitated by exporting patriarchal (and arguably aristocratic) models of government to the colonies to reveal the integral role of colonialism in creating modernity and the continued importance of familial politics for the modern state. This chapter teases out the contradictions between the imposition of\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\npatriarchal norms of colonial subjectivity and French efforts to perpetuate the gendering of space to exclude women and the family from politics. While gendered critiques of consumption were deployed to indicate the inadequacy of local government, the French perpetuated the ceremonial role of the bey while limiting his access to state resources. These financial constraints further reduced the bey’s authority even within the palace. The combination of archival records, financial registers, diplomatic correspondence, and narrative sources attempts to counter the limitations posed by each set of documents. As account books, the palace expense registers contain certain lacunae; to begin with, it is not possible to ascertain whether they represent intentions or actions or a combination of the two. When total costs are recorded, prices per unit are often missing, as are the amounts purchased. They include ingredients for baking but not complete recipes; they indicate the costs of clothing while revealing nothing on style or design, and they suggest who received money but not what they subsequently did with their cash. In short, while these detail the material and structural contours of palace life and the organization of the government, they reveal much less about the meanings people attributed to them. I supplement these with the writings of Tunisian historians such as ibn Yusuf for the eighteenth century and Ahmed ibn Dhiaf for the nineteenth century. Both men had connections to the palace and the ruling families that provided intimate knowledge of political affairs, forming valuable but partisan accounts. European (and occasionally American) tourists, merchants, and diplomats visited Tunisia as early as the seventeenth century. These later included adventure seekers, amateur scientists, and botanists, whose tantalizing accounts were intended to encourage European colonialism. The resident foreign community did not reach any size until the nineteenth century, when its major components were Italians and Maltese. Though they tended to recycle anecdotes that were sensationalized as a marketing strategy, they provide detailed observations that supplement information from other sources. The earliest texts are the brief report by Anselme Adorne (1470) and the edited memoirs of the merchant Nicolas Béranger (1684–1706). For the eighteenth century, the major sources are the French botanists Jean-­André Peyssonel (in Tunisia in 1724–1725) and René Louiche Desfontaines (1783–1786); the British amateur Orientalist Thomas Shaw (1727); and the consul of Holland, Antoine Nyssen (1788). Later publications include those of bureaucrats such as the American consuls Mordecai Noah (1815) and Amos Perry (1869); a consul of Sardinia named Filippi (1825–1830); the French colonial official E. Pellissier (1853); 28\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nand those serving in semiofficial capacities such as the French doctor Louis Frank (1816) and the Piedmontese military instructor Louis Calligaris (1834). Finally, there was an increasing number of leisure travelers such as Charles-­Marie de la Condamine (1731); the Scot Thomas MacGill (1808); the British Grenville Temple (1835); the Prussian prince Hermann von Pückler-­Muskau (1837); the Irish captain John Clark Kennedy (1845); the Protestant missionary Nathan Davis (1846–1850); the Swiss founder of the Red Cross, Henry Dunant (1857); the Austrian Ernst von Hesse-­ Wartegg (1882); and the French Charles Lallemand (1889), though there were certainly many others who visited the province. Throughout the book, readers will encounter a succession of beys, their spouses and children, prominent ministers, and slaves, through various angles of their lives: what they ate, how they dressed, how they presented themselves to the inhabitants of the province or to European diplomats and travelers. A step towards completing a more comprehensive social history of Ottoman Tunisia with emphasis on women and family perhaps raises more questions than one book can address. While it begins to explore provincial elite culture more broadly, palace practices were hardly representative of common family structures, household organization, or culinary practices. The documentary sources used offer but a few insights on the emotional meaning of family, and certainly much more could be said about relations between siblings, spouses, parents, and children. It is hoped that future research will continue to probe questions related to women’s experiences both within the palace and beyond, including archeological and visual sources, women’s writings, and shariʿa court records, to further address the complexity of the family and women’s lives. While concentrating on the ruling family of Tunis, this story locates them in the midst of political and economic changes in the Ottoman Empire and around the Mediterranean, transnational intellectual currents, and migratory movements that lead to and included the onset of European colonial rule in the Middle East and geostrategic shifts that brought Tunisia to the foreground of imperial projects. These transformations altered the meaning of wealth, the ways in which it was utilized, and the ability of the beys and their families to support a paternal and redistributive government. While the details are particular to Tunisia and comparable to other places in the Middle East, the story of the palace women and the political importance of the family is part of European histories, the colonial experience, and the global processes of modernity.\n\nIntroduction\n\n29\n\nChapter 1\n\nFami ly and t he Polit ics of Marr iage\n\nThis month [October 1702] there were so many marriages between the courtesans of the bey and the wives and daughters of the deceased Muhammad Bey that it would be tedious to enumerate them all. I want only to note that of Husayn ibn ʿAli, the bey’s deputy [kahia] with the wife of Ramadan Bey, who was the daughter of Murad. Nicolas Béranger, La régence de Tunis à la fin du XVIIe siècle; mémoire pour servir à l’histoire de Tunis depuis l’année 1684\n\nBy 1650, the household had become an important feature of Ottoman politics and a key institution in the training and recruitment of bureaucratic personnel. Instruction and patronage within the households of ministers rivaled earlier practices centered in the palace such as military training and devşirme (slave recruitment) as they accommodated the increasing specialization of imperial administration.1 A corresponding process took place on the provincial level that allowed for greater participation of local notables in provincial administration often dominated by a few families and their extended networks. Across the empire in the provinces of Cairo, Damascus, Mosul, Nablus, and Mount Lebanon, influential families received imperial support for their political roles.2 Their households included blood relatives, mamluks, concubines, servants, employees, and other retainers, incorporating various forms of economic, military, and social clientage that were crucial to social mobility so that the composition of the ruling elite was heterogeneous. The rise of household politics within Ottoman provincial administration coincided with the period following the conquest of Tunis in 1574, becoming a feature of its government at least until French occupation in 1881. While the Ottoman conquest secured the position of its military by establishing roughly fifteen garrisons in the capital and countryside, it did not guarantee suzerainty over the population. Thus, the extension 30\n\nof imperial rule relied on patronage networks grounded in the household and supplemented by marriage to build connections between families, legitimize government authority, and create political continuity. Over the course of the first century of Ottoman rule, this would allow the governing family to establish ties with the military elite, religious scholars, tribal notables from the capital, and major provincial cities and occasionally to extend their circles to the political class in neighboring Algeria and Tripoli. The beginning of family hegemony can be traced to Murad Bey (r. 1613–1631), one the most successful governors of the early Ottoman era, though quarrels amongst his descendants towards the end of the seventeenth century weakened their claim to authority. This political infighting directly contributed to the rise of Husayn ibn ʿAli (r. 1705–1735), who stabilized the hereditary nature of the governorship. While traditional narratives often view the reign of ibn ʿAli as constituting a break from a period when imperial interests were prevalent, and inaugurating one marked by local autonomy, this traditional narrative obscures the numerous continuities between the two men as reflected by the persons in their households. In fact, while the centrality of household networks to political affairs became particularly evident during the periods of heightened political conflict from 1675 to 1702, and between 1728 and 1756, when followers were armed and transformed into opposing armies, the networks were also paramount during periods of calm and stability. During both clashes, violence stemmed from succession disputes within the family, even if the 1728–1756 dynastic infighting spiraled into the major political event of the early eighteenth century involving Ottoman governors in Algiers and their soldiers, as well as much of the population in the northwest and around Qayrawan. While these conflicts can be told as a story of military confrontation, political intrigue, and economic calculations, incorporating the mobilization of household networks into the picture underscores the proximity between family and politics. This chapter begins with an elaboration of the structures of Ottoman provincial government in Tunis and the significance of the household in the seventeenth century, before turning to the role of marriage alliances as a dynastic and imperial strategy and its application in Tunis. It then reframes the civil war through the metaphor of divorce to expand the analytical focus of early eighteenth-­century politics to the household, suggest common patterns between Tunis and other Ottoman provinces, delineate the social and political prominence of the family, and demonstrate how political traditions were inherited through women.\n\nFamily and the Politics of Marriage\n\n31\n\nImperial Contexts Why a similar pattern of local autonomy and hereditary governing developed in Tunis relates to the broader geopolitical context of the sixteenth and early seventeenth century. By the sixteenth century, the Hafsid dynasty that had ruled parts of northern Africa from Tunis since 1229 was considerably weakened by internal disputes and economic problems. The region briefly became the site of competition between the Ottoman Empire and the Spanish Habsburgs, both acting through the intermediary of local proxies. A number of these strongmen owed their power to success in corsairing in the western Mediterranean where the business of captives was lucrative. The activities of the merchant marines flourished in coastal regions and were supported by Tunis, Algiers, Tripoli, the Italian city-­states, and even Atlantic powers such as the Dutch and the English. Corsairing was officially sanctioned by the English, which blurred the line between privateering and plunder, and overlapped with the trans-­Atlantic slave trade as captives were sold at slave markets in Spain, France, and across the Italian peninsula. The exchange of captives was a routine part of diplomacy between the Ottoman Empire and powers on the African coast and with Europe.3 In northern Africa, some captives were ransomed to the church, and a number of others (derogatorily referred to as renegades) converted to Islam, made careers for themselves at sea, and utilized their wealth and military acumen to make bids for power.4 Khayr al-­Din, an enterprising privateer with a base in Algiers, offered gifts to the sultan requesting Ottoman recognition to sanction his political claim over the city. Ottoman forces had recently defeated the Mamluk Sultanate based in Cairo and were engaged in disputes over the provinces of Baghdad and Basra with the Safavids. The alliance with Khayr al-­Din contributed to strengthening the Mediterranean fleet and offered strategic outposts from which to attack the merchant marines of its European foes.5 Thus, Selim I (1512–1520) granted Khayr al-­Din the Ottoman rank of beylerbeyi (corresponding to a provincial governor, or a governor-­ general, though not all beylerbeyi held an equivalent rank), and Khayr al-­ Din subsequently extended his dominions to Tunis, where he ruled from 1529 to 1534. After briefly returning to nominal Hafsid rule (supported by the Spanish king), Tunis was reconquered between 1569 and 1572 by a second corsair named ʿIlij ʿAli, who had Ottoman backing. Finally, in 1574 Sultan Selim II (1566–1574) sent troops under the command of his Grand Vizir Sinan Pasha, seconded by ʿIlij ʿAli and further supported by soldiers from Qayrawan and Tripoli, securing its conquest.6 More than a local 32\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\npower struggle, these events stemmed from broader imperial competition and were viewed by contemporary and later scholars as preserving the Muslim character of the region from the threat of Spanish Christianity.7 Though the Ottomans were intent on stalling Spanish expansion and protecting trade, the center of imperial attention soon shifted towards Europe, which was a rational consideration, given the costs and material constraints of early modern warfare. Since the majority of military activities consisted of border skirmishes and not imperial campaigns, Tunis receded in terms of priority after 1574.8 Immediate suzerainty over the three western provinces of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli was delegated to ʿIlij ʿAli with the rank of kapudan pasha (qubtan pasha in Arabic), or commander of the Ottoman fleet. He was senior to the governors of Tunis and Tripoli and served as the intermediary between the provinces and Istanbul. In Tunis, a pasha was appointed by the sultan for one-­year terms to govern with the assistance of a council of military officers and civilian notables known as the diwan. By the late sixteenth century, the sultan granted special status to Tunis as eyalat-­i mumtaze, or privileged province.9 Among other particularities, this meant that local troops selected their own officers and the province organized its own fleet. This arrangement recognized and built upon the strength of the North African corsairs whose marines contributed to imperial campaigns, disrupted trade, took captives, or attacked the ships of Ottoman rivals. For instance, the Tunisian fleet participated in a joint expedition with the Algerian forces against Venice in the early seventeenth century and participated in the Ottoman war against Crete in the 1640s.10 In exchange, they were exempted from paying annual tributes. While the three provinces were expected to adhere to the contours of imperial agreements with foreign powers, the governors could sign separate treaties. For instance, the pasha and the diwan of Tunis signed treaties with France, Holland, and England in the seventeenth century that corresponded to the Capitulations agreements between these states and the sultan. This established the formal structures of autonomy from the imperial center, which coexisted with the expectation of allegiance and military support. Only a small portion of the troops sent from Istanbul in 1574 were imperial janissaries (the salaried/professional military corps). Instead, the majority were sekban, or irregular troops composed of Muslims from Anatolia employed specifically for the period of the campaign.11 The prevalence of irregular troops was in stark contrast to the situation in Algiers, where there was a larger proportion of imperial janissaries and frequent recruitment from Istanbul. This concentration of forces was concomitant\n\nFamily and the Politics of Marriage\n\n33\n\nwith its status as the empire’s western frontier. The ruling class in Algeria intentionally distinguished members of the military from the local population by discouraging marriage with the local population and excluding the latter’s descendants from inheriting the military positions of their fathers.12 In Tunis, not only were janissaries less influential than in Algiers, but marriages with local families were encouraged or tacitly accepted by the diwan, and their sons were salaried soldiers. The irregular troops also came to play a more prominent role in government by the turn of the seventeenth century. Organized into units of one hundred men under a grade of officer known as a dey (from the Turkish for “maternal uncle”), they protested in 1591 against their subordination to janissary officers. As a result, they succeeded in earning recognition for one of the approximately thirty deys to be elected to the diwan. Thus, the differing composition of the two militaries constituted the basis of structural differences in provincial organization between Tunis and Algiers. The greater military presence, and the janissaries in particular, in Algiers, which served as the base for the qubtan pasha, also explains the tendency of Algiers-­based officials to intervene in the affairs of Tunis. These officials in the capital supplemented the administration of the interior that was run by local notables in place since the Hafsid era.13 In practice, political authority was dependent on individual initiative and popular support, which was maintained through household networks. Though the pasha held the highest rank, minor officials with the titles of bey and dey dominated the political scene for much of the seventeenth century. At this time, the bey was a military commander assigned to new territories in the empire with fiscal and administrative responsibilities. In Tunis, the bey was responsible for leading the mahalla, the biannual tax-­collecting missions in the interior (a practice that dated to the Hafsid era, if not earlier). The first figure of note was ʿUthman Dey (1598–1610), who was closely allied with the troops and civilian authorities, becoming a prominent government official who maintained a household of some fifty dependents and followers.14 He was succeeded by Yusuf Dey (1610–1635), an officer in the military whose loyalty to ʿUthman Dey was compensated by marriage to his patron’s daughter, cementing his designation as heir. The smooth transition of power provided continuity that led to greater political stability. Though the position of dey declined in importance because of consistent bickering amongst the deys for supremacy, ʿUthman Dey’s household maintained enough clout over the next century that his female descendants often married men in the ruling class. Subsequently, economic and political power was consolidated in the 34\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nhands of the bey, particularly under Ramadan Bey (c. 1613). A soldier sent from Istanbul who contributed to consolidating central authority over the interior, he held the title of bey until his death around 1613.15 Murad, a renegade who was part of the household of Ramadan Bey, used this position to gain loyalty of troops, pacify the countryside, and accumulate enough wealth to own slaves. He eventually married the daughter of his patron, and in 1631 he bought recognition from the sultan to award him the rank of pasha. In fact, Moalla suggests that the sultan viewed the bey as akin to the loyal palace mamluks and preferred relying on his authority to that of the unpredictable dey, whose military power base was reminiscent of the janissaries.16 With enough income to pay the military, and enjoying official support from Istanbul, Murad was primarily responsible for elevating the position of bey to the principal authority in the province. His descendants were able to maintain this political role for the next three generations—his son Hammuda (1631–1666); grandson Murad (1666–1675); and two of his great-­grandsons, ʿAli (1675–1686) and Muhammad (1686–1696)—before escalating disputes within the family led to their loss of power. Their monopoly on government is referred to as the Muradite dynasty. The first period of political stability following the establishment of Ottoman rule was attained through seamless transitions of authority between ʿUthman Dey and his son-­in-­law Yusuf Dey, and between Ramadan Bey and his son-­in-­law Murad, so that household alliances confirmed political power.\n\nProvincial Structures in the Seventeenth Century Despite the provisional autonomy, numerous features of provincial government bore a close resemblance to Ottoman models. For instance, the structure of the military was a condensed version of that in Istanbul in terms of the organization of soldiers into distinct divisions, titles, responsibilities, and hierarchy of its officers.17 Much the same can be said of the administration, the treasury, the rates of taxation, and the fiscal system in general, which “conformed to the same principles and practices as in the rest of the Empire.”18 The fiscal system was marked by a dual approach, whereby a large gold coin—in Tunis, called a sultani or mahbub—was used to facilitate long-­distance trade. The largest coin in circulation in Tunis was the piaster, which was minted in the province but bore the name of the sultan. There was a mint within the palace where smaller denominations were also produced, though imperial prerogatives did not extend to\n\nFamily and the Politics of Marriage\n\n35\n\nsilver or copper coins.19 These coins were used in situations that evoked the broader Ottoman context such as the payment of soldiers and as gifts to imperial officials visiting the province.20 Though titles did not determine the arrangement of power, they were used to secure, bolster, and confirm such authority as approved by the sultan. In the earlier period of Ottoman rule, a number of beys requested the title of pasha from the sultan by sending gifts; this was the case with Khayr al-­Din, Murad, and two of his descendants. It was also current practice in Algeria to purchase official titles, as demonstrated by Salah Bey of Constantine (1771–1792), who became one of the most influential governors of the city.21 By the eighteenth century, it was standard for each bey to formally petition the sultan for his title, which was confirmed by an imperial decree (or firman) of investiture and a qaftan (or cloak). Both items maintained political relevance and were utilized by ʿAli Bey in 1777 to confirm his choice of successor when he requested that the sultan confer them on his son Hammuda (1777–1814). Once Hammuda formally received the title pasha, ʿAli Bey took an early retirement.22 The imperial firman and qaftan were delivered by the qubtan pasha, or one of his envoys (the shawash), in a symbolic manifestation of Ottoman ties. They were presented in a military ceremony attended by the diwan, and each member present received money. The province was required “to offer gifts to the Sublime Porte when a new sultan took the throne of the empire, to demonstrate and proclaim obedience to him, and similarly, on the accession of a pasha in Tunis, when his reign was secured, and he had received the accord of the people, he is to send gifts to the state and request a firman and the blessed sash, to make clear his announcement [of obedience].”23 These gifts required extensive preparation, as they were sent by the boatload and were destined not only to the sultan but to various members of the imperial household, including the sultan’s mother, sisters, and principal counselors. They included jewels, decorated swords, tissues and embroidery, and articles of local manufacture such as perfume, and on one occasion, the bey sent 257 dozen shashia to Istanbul.24 While ties to Istanbul were often symbolic, the frequent preparation of gifts gave them an additional materiality that recognized the political relevance of the sultan’s household. In dealing with Istanbul, the bey combined official petitions of recognition with requests for the sultan’s approval of diplomatic or military actions and commercial matters in the capital. The regularity of such exchanges fluctuated in relation to regional and international politics and the whims of particular governors. High-­ranking officials and confidants 36\n\nFamily Foundations of Ottoman Rule\n\nwere sent to the sultan’s court, returning with a firman, troops, or slaves. There was a consistent flow of messengers from Istanbul bearing official news and orders on average of once every two to three years. The majority of correspondence with the central government was carried out through senior palace officials such as the kapiji pasha (Arabized as qabiji ). The kapijis were janissaries who guarded the main gate to the sultan’s palace and were also sent to deliver the sultan’s orders to provincial governors. In addition to recognizing the bey as governor, or confirming his investiture, they announced the accession of a new sultan and brought news of the birth of children to the sultan (an occasion when cannons were sounded); orders regarding trade, taxation, and foreign policy; and the imperial firman confirming the nomination of the bey. When the kapijis and qubtan pasha stayed in the capital, the bey provided extensive provisions throughout their sojourn, including stocking their ships with grains, oil, spices, livestock, and hundreds or thousands of loaves of bread, for the return voyage.25 From 1756 to 1807, the governors of Tunis paid tribute to their superiors in Algiers as well, making regular offerings of olive oil, gunpowder, and hundreds of shashia.26 On occasion, the dey of Algiers sought to claim the privilege of presenting imperial orders to the governors of Tunis in deference to their status as intermediaries with the sultan, hoping to intervene in matters of succession, promote their clients, and distribute the official qaftan of investiture on behalf of the sultan. At different times, officials in Tunis similarly interfered with the selection of governors in Tripoli; sought alliances with powerful patrons in Istanbul against aggressive Algerian governors; and took refuge in Algiers, expanding local conflicts into the neighboring province. This bickering reached the point that the sultan instructed the provinces to achieve peace with each other.27 There were significant shifts in power during the first century and a half of Ottoman rule, the first of which altered the chain of command among the troops and allowed their officers to establish political authority. Almost at the same time, the minor imperial denomination of “bey” was transformed from something akin to a district governor, to a military commander responsible for collecting taxes, and finally to the supreme authority within the province often operating in the name of the sultan as pasha. The sultan sanctioned this order and sent regular envoys; the beys consistently provided gifts in return, requested the renewal of their position, and followed the parameters of imperial foreig"
