Bhanubhakta Acharya, born on 13 July 1814 (29 Ashadh 1871 BS), was a Nepali writer, poet and translator, widely regarded as the first writer in the Nepali language. He was the one who translated the great epic Ramayana from Sanskrit to Nepali for the first time. He is known by the title of 'Aadikavi' which literally means the first poet.

He was born in the village of Chundi Ramgha, Tanahun District, Nepal. Bhanubhakta received his primary education of Sanskrit at his home by his grandfather and was later educated later in Varanasi.

Bhanubhakta Acharya is revered and honoured with the title of 'Aadakavi' (The First-ever Poet) for the Nepali people of Nepal. He is not called 'Aadikavi' because he was the first poet in Nepal but he deserved the title as he was the first poet who wrote with an understanding of the Marma (inner essence) of the poetry.
