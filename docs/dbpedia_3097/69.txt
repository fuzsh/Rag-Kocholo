A teenager who had gone for tuition class on Saturday morning was found dead at Byas Municipality in Tanahun today. The deceased has been identified as Purna Bahadur Ale, 16, of the municipality. He was a 10th grader at Maharshi Bedvyash Sanskrit High School. He was found hanging from a tree at the local Aadikabi Bhanubhakta Campus premises today. Family members of the deceased claimed that Purna’s death was a murder though it looked like suicide. They said someone might have killed Purna and hanged his body. Purna’s elder brother Prem Bahadur said Purna had deep cuts on his right hand and various parts of the body. “His right eye has been cut out and also his private parts,” added Prem. He said there was no doubt that his brother had been brutally killed. Tanahun Region Development Committee Chairman Bir Bahadur Thapa also suspected that Purna was hung on the tree after he was killed. The family said they would not receive the body until the concerned authority brought the culprit to book. “We will receive the body after justice is served,” said Purna’s other brother Padam. The body has been kept in Damauli Hospital for post mortem. It was also found that Purna had not reached the tuition class that day. According to teacher Kamala Wagle of the school, Purna had last attended the class on Friday but did not show up at the school on Saturday. Purna and some of his friends are said to have been involved in a minor dispute regarding a girl some days ago. Purna’s friends said the incident might have occurred following the dispute. Inspector Prem Shankar of District Police Office, Tanahun, said the post mortem report would reveal the cause of death. SP Mohan Kumar Acharya of DPO said an investigation into the case is underway.
