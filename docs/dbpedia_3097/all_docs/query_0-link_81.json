Many people of\n\nthe hilly regions and remote part of our country still call Kathmandu\n\n“Nepal”. The history of Kathmandu Valley is the history of ancient\n\nNepal in general. People do not have enough findings on how\n\nother places of Nepal were in the past. Many years ago, Kathmandu\n\nValley was a lake. It was not like what it is now. The Bagmati River\n\nmade its way to the south of the Valley. The water drained out\n\nfrom Chobhar gorge. Then, the lake dried and became suitable for\n\nhuman settlement. The earliest people to settle were the Gopalas.\n\nRule of Gopal Dynasty\n\nKathmandu Valley was full of green grass in the past. Therefore,\n\nthe Gopalas came from Mathura, India, to settle here. They were\n\ncow herders. Later, they started to rule over the Valley. Their main\n\noccupation was animal husbandry. They were also called “Neep”\n\nor “Nep”. Many people believe that Nepal was named after their\n\nname.\n\nAltogether eight Gopal Kings ruled over Nepal for some 521 years.\n\nThe first King of the Gopal dynasty was Bhumi Gupta (Bhuktaman),\n\nand Yaksha Gupta was the last one. The capital city of that time was\n\nin Matatirtha, and the kingdom covered Kirtipur, Thankot, Balambu,\n\nTistung, Palung and so on.\n\nApproved by Curriculum Development Centre, Vedanta Integrated Social Studies Book 5 155\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nRule of Mahispal Dynasty\n\nThe last King of Gopal dynasty, Yaksha Gupta didn’t have an heir.\n\nTherefore, his close relative, Jaya Singh became the King of Nepal\n\nafter his death. Jaya Singh was a buffalo herder. In Sanskrit, a\n\nbuffalo is called Mahis. Thus, the people who reared buffalos were\n\nMahispals. They ruled the Kathmandu Valley after the Gopalas.\n\nThe Mahispals were also known as Ahirs or Abhirs. Three kings\n\nof this dynasty ruled for some 161 years. They were Jaya Singh,\n\nBhul Singh (Bar Singh) and Bhuwan Singh. Besides animal rearing,\n\npeople also started farming from this period.\n\nRule of Kirant Dynasty First Kirant King, Yalambar\n\nAfter the fall of the Mahispal\n\ndynasty, the Kirant dynasty came\n\nfrom Eastern Nepal and started\n\nruling over the Valley. They lived\n\nby hunting in the jungle. Later\n\non, they started cultivation. The\n\nKirants ruled for some 1000 years\n\nin Nepal. The first Kirant King was\n\nYalambar. Patan (Lalitpur) is called\n\n“Yala” even today because King\n\nYalambar ruled there in the past.\n\nThe capital was at Gokarna at\n\nthat time. They worshipped Lord\n\nKiranteshwor Mahadev of the\n\nPashupati Temple.\n\nThe Kirants were good rulers. They were interested in arts and\n\ncommerce. They treated men and women equally. There was no\n\ncaste system during their rule. Therefore, there was no conflict in\n\nsociety. The last Kirant King was Gasti. He was a feeble ruler. Thus,\n\nthe Lichchhavis overthrew them.\n\n156 Our Past Approved by Curriculum Development Centre,\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nThe Kirants were the ancestors of the Rais and Limbus of Nepal.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nMany people believe that Gautam Buddha visited Kathmandu\n\nValley during the rule of the seventh Kirant King, Jitedasti\n\nand spread Buddhism.\n\nRule of Lichchhavi Dynasty\n\nThe Lichchhavis came to power after defeating the Kirants. They\n\ncame to Nepal from Baishali in Northern India. King Mandev,\n\nAmshuverma, Narendradev and Shivadev were some famous Kings\n\nof this dynasty.\n\nThe Lichchhavis were rich in art and Amsuverma\n\nculture. They had developed a good trade\n\nrelationship with India, Tibet and China.\n\nThe country flourished trade, education,\n\nart and culture significantly during that\n\nperiod. There were many economic, social,\n\ncultural, religious and political reforms\n\nin the country. Therefore, the Lichchhavi\n\nperiod is also known as the Golden Period\n\nin the history of Nepal. The Lichchhavi\n\nKings were able to win the hearts of\n\ntheir Prajas. They built various historical\n\nbuildings such as Kailashkut Bhawan,\n\nMangriha, Changunarayan Temple and\n\nNyatapole Temple during their rule.\n\nThe Medieval period (Malla period) followed the Lichchhavi period,\n\nand the Modern period came after the medieval period.\n\nApproved by Curriculum Development Centre, Vedanta Integrated Social Studies Book 5 157\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nremote GLOSSARY\n\ndrain\n\nheir : far away from towns or cities\n\n: remove liquid from something\n\nfeeble : a person who will legally receive money, property, or a\n\nancestor\n\nflourish title from another person, especially an older member\n\nreform of the same family, when that other person dies\n\n: weak and without energy, strength, or power\n\n: a person related to you who lived a long time ago\n\n: to grow or develop successfully\n\n: changes and improvements to law, social system, or\n\ninstitution\n\nEXERCISE\n\n(1) Fill in the blanks with suitable answers.\n\n(a) Many years ago, Kathmandu Valley was a ......................\n\n(b) The major occupation of the Gopalas was ......................\n\n(c) The .................... ruled in the Kathmandu Valley after\n\nthe Gopalas.\n\n(d) The ...................... lived by hunting in the jungle.\n\n(e) Changunarayan Temple, Nyatapole Temple, Mangriha\n\nand Kailashkut Bhawan were built in the .............. period.\n\n(2) Identify the following Kings.\n\n(a) The first King of the Gopala dynasty ............................\n\n(b) The last King of the Gopala dynasty ............................\n\n158 Our Past Approved by Curriculum Development Centre,\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\n(c) The first King of the Mahispala dynasty ...........................\n\n(d) The first Kiranti King ............................\n\n(e) The last Kiranti King ............................\n\n(3) Write True for right and False for wrong statements.\n\n(a) The first King of the Gopala dynasty\n\nwas Yalambar.\n\n(b) The last Kiranti King was Jitedasti.\n\n(c) The people who reared buffaloes\n\nwere the Mahispalas.\n\n(d) The Lichchhavi dynasty ruled for a longer\n\ntime than the Mahispala dynasty in Nepal.\n\n(e) The Kirants were the ancestors of\n\nthe Rais and Limbus of Nepal.\n\n(4) Answer the following questions.\n\n(a) How did Kathmandu Valley become suitable for human\n\nsettlement?\n\n(b) Why is Patan (Lalitpur) called ‘Yala’ even these days?\n\n(c) How was the then society during the Kiranti regime?\n\n(d) Why is the Lichchhavi period called the golden period in\n\nthe history of Nepal?\n\n(e) Which period followed the Lichchhavi period?\n\nApproved by Curriculum Development Centre, Vedanta Integrated Social Studies Book 5 159\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nLesson Our National Luminaries -1\n\n6.4\n\nAfter the completion of this lesson, we will be able to:\n\n• identify the national luminaries of our country; and\n\n• tell their contributions to our nation.\n\nThere are great people who have made significant contributions in\n\nvarious fields.

He studies in grade five in one\n\nof the local community schools in his locality. His Social Studies\n\nteacher has asked him to write short paragraphs about some\n\nnational heroes of Nepal. He consulted several general knowledge\n\nbooks and textbooks to complete his assignment. His uncle also\n\nsurfed the internet and helped him in his task. He has prepared few\n\nnotes about Prithvi Narayan Shah, Balabhadra Kunwar and Amar\n\nSingh Thapa.\n\n(1) Prithvi Narayan Shah\n\nPN Shah was born in Gorkha district on Poush\n\n27, 1779 BS, as the first son to King Narabhupal\n\nShah and Queen Kausalyawati. He ascended the\n\nthrone of Gorkha after the death of his father\n\nin 1799 BS at the age of 20. He began to train\n\nsoldiers and started the process of unifying the\n\nstates of Nepal immediately after becoming the\n\nKing. Nepal was divided into small kingdoms as Baise and Chaubise\n\nstates during his time. He unified such small kingdoms and made\n\na single, independent, unified, strong and greater Nepal. He is\n\nknown as the 'Founder of Modern Nepal'.\n\nIf King Prithvi Narayan Shah had not led the unification campaign,\n\nit would not have been possible to see Nepal in its current form.\n\nShah also protected Nepal from foreign invasion, especially from\n\nthe British invasion. We celebrate Prithvi Jayanti Day every year on\n\nApproved by Curriculum Development Centre, Vedanta Integrated Social Studies Book 5 165\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nPoush 27 to honour the founder of modern Nepal. If we see a statue\n\nof PN Shah, we can see him raising his index finger. It signifies all\n\nNepali as one. It means that although people come from different\n\nbackgrounds in Nepal, they have a common identity as Nepali. He\n\nencourages us to live in unity, peace and harmony.\n\n(2) Balabhadra Kunwar\n\nBalabhadra Kunwar was a great warrior of\n\nNepal. He played a significant role during the\n\nAnglo-Nepal war. He was in charge of Khalanga\n\n(Nalapani) during the war. He led the Nepali army\n\nto protect our country from the British invasion.\n\nKunwar had some 600 people only including\n\nwomen and children during the war. On the\n\nother hand, East India Company had more than\n\n3500 soldiers with modern weapons like cannons, guns and bullets.\n\nThere was a fierce war between them. The East India Company\n\ncouldn’t defeat Nepali troops. The British generals were impressed\n\nwith Kunwar’s bravery. They tried to tempt him. However, he never\n\naccepted their offer. Instead, he and his army were ready to die\n\nfor their country. If he and his army had not defended the country,\n\nwe would have lost this nation. The East India Company erected a\n\nstone inscription in Nalapani to show respect for him.\n\n(3) Amar Singh Thapa\n\nAmar Singh Thapa was also a great warrior\n\nduring the Anglo-Nepal war. He fought bravely\n\nagainst the British soldiers during the war. He\n\nalso played a significant role in the unification\n\ncampaign. He helped to extend the territory of\n\nNepal up to the Tista River in the east and Kangada\n\nin the west. He joined Baise and Chaubise states\n\ninto greater Nepal.\n\n166 Our Past Approved by Curriculum Development Centre,\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nOnce, the British soldiers asked him to join them. They promised to\n\noffer a high rank and better payment. However, he didn’t fall into\n\ntheir temptation. He always believed that only traitors deceive their\n\nnation. He also regarded that nothing is superior to the motherland.\n\nHe sacrificed everything for the welfare and betterment of his\n\nnation.

Our domestic\n\nproducts are cheaper than imported\n\ngoods. They are easily available.\n\nOur money doesn’t go out of our\n\ncountry. Similarly, the people of\n\nour own country get employment\n\nopportunities in domestic\n\nindustries if we consume their\n\nproducts. They do not need to go\n\nto foreign nations for employment.\n\nIt improves the living standard of Taan\n\npeople living in our country. It also\n\nhelps to strengthen the economy of our country. Likewise, it helps\n\nto develop feeling of nationalism. Therefore, we should use our\n\nown domestic products.\n\nApproved by Curriculum Development Centre, Vedanta Integrated Social Studies Book 5 191\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nMany people believe that imported goods are better than domestic\n\nproducts. It is not true in all cases. People of other nations also\n\ndemand some of our products to consume in their own country.\n\nNepali tea, Pashmina shawls, handicrafts, noodles and footwear\n\nare popular all over the world. Thus, we should be responsible and\n\nencourage our family members and other people to use domestic\n\nproducts. We should also try to find out some ways to promote the\n\ngoods produced in our country.\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nhandicraft : a skilled activity in which something is made in a\n\ntraditional way with the hands rather than being\n\nproduced by machines in a factory, or an object\n\nmade by such an activity\n\nstrengthen : to make something stronger or more effective, or\n\nto become stronger or more effective\n\nnationalism : a great or too great love of your own country\n\npromote : to encourage people to like, buy, use, do, or\n\nsupport something\n\nEXERCISE\n\n(1) Write True for right and False for wrong statements.\n\n(a) We need different agricultural and industrial\n\ngoods to fulfil our daily needs.\n\n(b) We shouldn’t develop the habit of using\n\ndomestic products.\n\n(c) Imported goods are always better than\n\ndomestic goods.\n\n192 Our Economic Activities Approved by Curriculum Development Centre,\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\n(d) We can become self-dependent if we use\n\nour own domestic products.\n\n(e) It is not necessary for us to encourage our family\n\nmembers to use domestic products.\n\n(2) Answer the following questions.\n\n(a) Give four-four examples of agricultural and industrial\n\ngoods.\n\n(b) Name any four products produced from cottage\n\nindustries.\n\n(c) Why should we always use our own domestic products?\n\nWrite any three reasons.\n\n(d) What products of Nepal are popular all over the world?\n\n(e) What are some ways to promote our domestic products?\n\nDiscuss among your friends and make a list of any two\n\nways.\n\n(3) The following slogans promote our own domestic\n\nproducts.

Similarly, climate, family background,\n\nenvironment, and physical infrastructure have shaped their career.\n\nFor example, if the people of the Himalayan Region want to do fishery,\n\nit is not possible due to its cold climate. The economic activities\n\nof different regions of our country are not the same because they\n\nhave different land structures, climate and environment. Economic\n\nactivity means the activity of producing, buying, or selling products\n\nor services.\n\nTerai Economy\n\nAgriculture is the main occupation\n\nof the people living in the Terai\n\nregion. The soil of this region is\n\nfertile, and climate is favourable\n\nfor cultivation. Irrigation facility is\n\nalso available here. Similarly, it is\n\npossible to transport agricultural\n\ntools and products easily from\n\none place to another due to its\n\nplain land. A large quantity of crops grows here. Therefore, the Terai\n\nregion is also called granary or breadbasket of Nepal. The major\n\nagricultural products of the Terai region are food crops like paddy,\n\nwheat, and pulses and cash crops like sugarcane, jute, tobacco,\n\n194 Our Economic Activities Approved by Curriculum Development Centre,\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nmustard, coconut, and betal nuts. People grow food crops for their\n\nconsumption and cash crops with the purpose of generating money.\n\nFood crops are generally grown for the local market, but cash crops\n\nare grown for the national and international market as well.\n\nBesides agriculture, people of the Terai Region are also involved in\n\nindustries, factories, fishery, trade and business. Many factories and\n\nindustries of cement, match, soap, noodles, sugar, paper, thread,\n\nand clothes run in the Terai region. People work at different levels\n\nin such industries and factories. People have also involved in fishery\n\nin the ponds of the region. This region shares borders with India.\n\nSome people are engaged in trade and business by importing\n\ngoods from India. They transport different crops, raw materials,\n\nmachinery and other products through custom checkpoints. Such\n\ncustom checkpoints are in Kakarvitta (Jhapa), Jogbani (Morang),\n\nRaxaul (Parsa), Bhairahawa (Rupandehi), Rupaidiha (Banke), and\n\nTanakpur (Kanchanpur).\n\nHilly Economy\n\nAgriculture is the main occupation\n\nof the people living in the Hilly\n\nRegion. They grow cardamom,\n\nlemon, maize, millet, orange,\n\npotato and different kinds of\n\nfruits and vegetables. The hilly\n\nregion is not only naturally\n\nbeautiful but also rich in socio-\n\ncultural aspects. Thus, many\n\ntourists love to visit this region\n\nfor trekking, rafting, research,\n\nkayaking and other adventurous activities. There are many hotels,\n\nrestaurants, homestays and resorts in this region. They serve food\n\nand accommodation to tourists. Many people also work as tourist\n\nguides to earn their livelihood in this region. The major tourist\n\nApproved by Curriculum Development Centre, Vedanta Integrated Social Studies Book 5 195\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\ndestinations of this region are Pokhara, Kathmandu, Gorkha, Ilam,\n\nPalpa, Surkhet, Dhankuta and so on.\n\nThe people living in the city areas and towns of this region are\n\nengaged in service, trade and industry as well. Kathmandu, Pokhara,\n\nChitwan, Dhankuta, Surkhet etc. are primary commercial centres of\n\nthis region.\n\nMountainous Economy\n\nThe climate of the mountainous region is cold, dry and windy.\n\nSimilarly, the soil of this region is\n\nnot fertile but full of rocks. As a\n\nresult, this region is not so suitable\n\nfor cultivation. However, people\n\ngrow wheat, barley, potato, apple\n\netc. in limited quantity. This region\n\nis full of grazing lands. People\n\nrear animals like sheep, mountain\n\ngoats, and yaks in their home.\n\nThey make cheese and Chhurpi\n\nfrom the milk of such animals and carpets and blankets from the\n\nwool of sheep. They earn a good amount of money by doing so.\n\nSeveral mountain peaks such as Sagarmatha (Mt Everest),\n\nKanchanjunga, Makalu, Gaurishankar, Annapurna, Langtang,\n\nDhaulagiri, and Saipal fall in this region. A large number of domestic\n\nand external tourists visit those places for trekking, expedition\n\nand mountaineering. The people of this region work as hoteliers,\n\nporters, tourist guides, cooks and helpers to serve the tourists and\n\nearn money. Annapurna region, Langtang, Namche Bazaar, Makalu,\n\nSagarmatha Base Camp, etc. are the major tourist destinations of\n\nthis region. Horticulture is another source of income to people of\n\nthis region. They grow apples and apricots. Some people of this\n\nregion also seek, collect and sell herbs for their livelihood.\n\n196 Our Economic Activities Approved by Curriculum Development Centre,\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\nGLOSSARY\n\ncareer : the job or series of jobs that you do during your\n\nworking life\n\nfavourable : giving an advantage or more chance of success\n\ngranary : an area where a lot of grain is grown\n\nbread basket : a large farming area that provides other areas with\n\nfood\n\nconsumption : the amount used or eaten\n\nkayaking : the activity of travelling in a light, narrow boat\n\nresort : a place where many people go for rest, sport, or\n\nanother stated purpose\n\nexpedition : a place where many people go for rest, sport, or\n\nanother stated purpose\n\nhorticulture : the art of growing fruits in an orchard\n\nlivelihood : the way a person earns the money he or she needs\n\nto pay for food, a place to live, clothing, etc.\n\nEXERCISE\n\n(1) Fill in the blanks with suitable answers.\n\n(a) .......................... is the main occupation of the people\n\nliving in the Terai and Hilly Regions of our country.\n\n(b) There are large ........................ and industries in the\n\nTerai Region of our country.\n\n(c) There are many hotels, ................................, homestays\n\nand resorts in the Hilly Region of Nepal.\n\nApproved by Curriculum Development Centre, Vedanta Integrated Social Studies Book 5 197\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\n(d) There are many grazing lands in the ........................\n\nRegion of Nepal.\n\n(e) Besides agriculture, animal husbandry and tourism,\n\npeople of the Himalayan Region of Nepal are involved\n\nin .......................... .\n\n(2) Give any four examples of the following.\n\n(a) Cash crops grown in the Terai Region of our country\n\n(b) Custom checkpoints located in Nepal\n\n(c) Activities that tourists do in Hilly Region of our country\n\n(d) Major tourist destinations in the Hilly Region of Nepal\n\n(e) Major tourist destinations in the Himalayan Region of\n\nNepal\n\n(3) Write True for right statements and False for wrong\n\nones.\n\n(a) An economy activity means the activity of\n\nproducing, buying, or selling products\n\nand services.\n\n(b) People grow food crops for selling and cash\n\ncrops for consumption.\n\n(c) The primary commercial centres of the Hilly\n\nRegion are Pokhara, Kathmandu, Gorkha,\n\nIlam, etc.\n\n(d) People of the Himalayan Region of Nepal\n\nproduce cheese, Chhurpi, carpets and\n\nblankets.\n\n(e) Some people of the Terai Region of Nepal\n\nare engaged in collecting and selling\n\nmedicinal herbs.\n\n198 Our Economic Activities Approved by Curriculum Development Centre,\n\nSanothimi, Bhaktapur\n\n(4) Make a list of any five cash crops and five food crops\n\nproduced in the Terai region of Nepal.\n\nCash crops Food crops\n\n(5) Answer the following questions.\n\n(a) Why do people choose different professions or\n\noccupations in our country?
