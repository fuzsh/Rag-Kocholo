        "text": "3. Bhanubhakta received his education of Sanskrit at his home by his grandfather and later in Varanasi.[ He is honoured with the title of Aadikavi for the contributions he made in the field of poetry and Nepali literature and for especially translating Sanskrit Ramayana in simple Nepali language which became popular among laymen. Every year, his birthday is celebrated as Bhanu Jayanti(13 July) when various literacy programs are organized to him\n\n4. Bhanubhakta Acharya is revered and honoured with the title of Aadakavi (The First-ever Poet) for the Nepali people of Nepal. Motiram Bhatta, first referred to him as Adikavi while writing Acharyaâ€™s biography in 1981. He clarifies that Acharya is not called Adikavi because he was the first poet in Nepal but he deserved the title as he was the first poet who wrote with an understanding of the marma (inner essence) of the poetry."
