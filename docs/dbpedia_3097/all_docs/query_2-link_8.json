        "text": "Bhanubhakta Acharya, born on 13 July 1814 (29 Ashadh 1871 BS), was a Nepali writer, poet and translator, widely regarded as the first writer in the Nepali language. He was the one who translated the great epic Ramayana from Sanskrit to Nepali for the first time. He is known by the title of 'Aadikavi' which literally means the first poet.\n\nHe was born in the village of Chundi Ramgha, Tanahun District, Nepal. Bhanubhakta received his primary education of Sanskrit at his home by his grandfather and was later educated later in Varanasi.\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya is revered and honoured with the title of 'Aadakavi' (The First-ever Poet) for the Nepali people of Nepal. He is not called 'Aadikavi' because he was the first poet in Nepal but he deserved the title as he was the first poet who wrote with an understanding of the Marma (inner essence) of the poetry.\n\nBhanu Jayanti falls on the 13 July or (29th day of the month of Ashad), according to the Nepali calendar. It is celebrated every year by the Government of Nepal and Nepalese people as well as by Nepali speaking people around the world in the remembrance of Bhanubhakta Acharya's birthday anniversary.\n\nIt is celebrated as a mega event with literary seminars, and programs and amid a remarkable presence of Nepalese writers, novelists, and other literary figures/enthusiasts.\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya died on the 23 of April 1868 AD or (20 day of the month of Baishak 1925 BS), at the age of 54."
