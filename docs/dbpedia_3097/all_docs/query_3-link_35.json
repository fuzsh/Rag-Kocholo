        "text": "DAMAULI, Feb 8: Bhanu Municipality in Tanahu district has initiated a process to develop the birthplace of Adikavi, the first poet Bhanubhakta Acharya, Chundiramgha, as a literary tourist destination. A Sahitya Uddyaan (literary park) is also being established at Bhanu Municipality-4 as part of this initiative.\n\nAcharya is a pioneering poet of the Nepali language. Mayor Ananda Raj Tripathi informed that the municipality had begun the works for developing tourism at Acharya's birthplace. The federal government has also allocated a budget of Rs 50 million for it.\n\nTripathi further said, \"President Ram Chandra Paudel took a keen interest in the development of this place. The works on the construction of the literary park have already begun with his support.\"\n\nThe budget allocated by the Ministry of Finance recently will be utilized to acquire land, prepare long-term plans, and set up statues of eminent literary figures.\n\nThe undertaking begins with land acquisition followed by a long-term plan. \"It is worrying to have the birthplace of Adikavi Bhanubhakta fallen into shadow. This needs to be promoted as a tourist destination,\" he shared.\n\nDeputy Mayor Uma Gotame viewed that it would be easy to draw both domestic and foreign tourists once the literary park is established. A total of 83 ropanis of land would be acquired for the park.\n\nPark development committee Chairman Dr. Jay Raj Acharya said the committee would provide necessary support and consultation for the construction of the literary park."
