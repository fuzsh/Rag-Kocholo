        "text": "May 12, 2020\n\nI had to give a short speech on Bhanu Bhakta Acharya, the first Nepali poet to translate the Ramayan from Sanskrit to Nepali.\n\nHi, and I am back. Today, I have nothing to share, but, I have everything to share. Just kidding!!\n\nBut, before I start sharing, I have to tell the bad news that is the corona report. I am sorry, but, the virus hit 57 runs today. Yes, you heard what I said. Now, there are 191 cases in Nepal, we are still trying to get the wicket, but we just can‚Äôt. I have started feeling like I will faint at the spot. When I heard that news, I was having my classes.\n\nAnd I played with Rumani and my other 3 sisters to refresh myself. We played a new game which I had made. It is called a mini-bowling miniature game. We need 10 color pencils and a small ball that is made up of anything. But, it should not be as hard as a ball that can break the glass. If so, be careful while playing. And just play it as if you are playing bowling.\n\nNext, I actually wanted to share some cartoon logic that makes no sense at all. I do not know if you will understand, but, here are two:\n\nYes!! How does he put on a shirt? His head is like a triangle, is he a magician?\n\nOk!!! Either the director never noticed this one. They live Underwater!!\n\nNow!! I think I will move on to my classes!! I had to give a short speech on BhanuBhakta Acharya. He is the first Nepali poet to write poems in Nepali and translate the Ramayan from Sanskrit to Nepali.\n\nNothing much!! And I have one more thing to say before I leave for today!! If you are a nurse and you are watching/reading this, happy nurse day to you all. You are saving us and honestly, God has granted you all to solve this Corona problem. Be happy and proud. We support you all. Bye!! See you all tomorrow!!\n\nMay 11, 2020\n\nCheck our the movie the Flash ‚Äì it is quite good. And I am creating a survey on Marvel superheroes. Stay tuned\n\nSorry, I did not write for the whole weekend. I just took a vacation for two days. But now, I‚Äôm back. Well, I think you should check out the movie ‚ÄúDC Comics Superheroes: The Flash‚Äù. I was watching this movie in the morning and it was so cool. I will finish it someday. Well, there‚Äôs that, and secondly, we had our speech competition today and I did the best I could but my mom said that it would have been better if I had organized it well. I will note that down.\n\nHey, you know what!! Deepti ma‚Äôam gave me an idea that I can make a survey on Marvel Superheroes. I am almost done and will share with you all shortly. I will make a DC one if you are a fan of DC. I am not familiar with DC, so I thought knowing the background would help. And I will ask some of my DC fan friends as well. They might help too. And I am still sticking to the idea of google survey on Buddha and Lock-Down (Part 2). And I might even be making one on something out of the world!!! That secret stays with me for now. Ok, revealing it will make you do background research, so, all I will say is, it will be a quiz.\n\nWell then, I will jump to the other topic now.\n\nPlease support the world as now Nepal realizes the coronavirus is getting very deadly. I would request you all to stay home. We have reached 121 cases and only 33 recoveries. #StayHome #SaveTheWorld.\n\nAnd guess what? My sister is also starting her online classes using Microsoft teams. We had never imagined that we would be using laptop/tab/mobile so much!! That too, with our parents‚Äô permissions.. Wow!!! Once the things get normal, don‚Äôt know how our parents will again react to devices and technologies!! Haha!\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\nShould I do a survey on corona or on Buddha? What do you suggest?\n\nSorry for being very late today. I am so tired as I am always tired on Fridays. TGIF begins for us but maybe not for you. I guess!! My apologies if I am incorrect on this statement. Nothing much to share today because there were no classes today.\n\nIt is a complicated story. The link to class comes and we stay there for an hour and that is why I am tired of doing nothing. The only fun thing we did today is we learned about simulation and also played a game named ‚ÄúBumper Copter‚Äù.\n\nIf you search for this text, you will find it. And then we directly had our closing class. And our teacher has decided to vote again to checking who will be the captain of the class. Well, that is some more good news.\n\nI feel like I am going to have a severe backache. It feels so sad to hear my story of today because there is only one class of computers every week and it was today. But, sir did not come!!üò•!! My friends were happier to have a talk about simulation. In a way, it‚Äôs alright for me, but I feel comfortable when Roshan sir teaches us. So that is one thing.\n\nThere is a corona update, though. The corona has completed a century with 7 sixers and 3 boundaries and a run rate of 1.00 and with a total of 30 wide calls and wickets of his friends. Please go to world meter for the corona update of the coronavirus in the world or specifically in your country. Except for if you are in 1 of the 25 countries that are not exposed to the virus. Thank you for listening.\n\nAnd for the survey, I have planned to do it on buddha till now. Or I have the idea of Lockdown Survey part 2? Which do you think is better? Please Email me on 2shivansharma@gmail.com. Thank you.\n\nMay 7, 2020\n\nI cannot think of anything else than Buddha today.\n\nI have absolutely no clue what to talk about today. I was so busy the whole day. Though we got a mid-day holiday. It was so much fun. And now, there is such a beautiful view of Kathmandu. It is as if paradise has come down to earth. By saying this, I can already remember a comment on this blog written by someone named Shanti. Oh, wait!! Of course, how could I forget? It is the birthday of the Star/Light of Asia i.e Buddha. We celebrate this day especially because he is god to us. He was an example of life and taught us the reason, cause, and purpose of living. So, for the tribute to him, I will be talking about all that I know about Buddha.\n\nBuddha‚Äôs birth was in Lumbini, Kapilvastu, Nepal around 2640 years ago. He is also said to have walked 7 steps when he was born. He shocked everyone, even his mother, to see a child who was only born then to do such a thing, was incredible. And as I have heard, he was born somewhere in the middle of a jungle. His name was kept as Siddhartha Gautam (SiddhƒÅrtha Gautam).\n\nAnd before Buddha was born, someone (Could be a priest, the voice of the sky, I forgot the actual person) had warned Buddha‚Äôs father, Suddhodhan, the king of Kapilvastu, that his son would not be a ruler like you, but, he would be a great person by being a life teacher to us. His father then wanted him to be a ruler, so, he never let Buddha go out of the castle. His mom had also got a tragic story. She died when buddha was of a young age.\n\nThen he got a stepmother because the father had no other choice. His 1st mother‚Äôs name was Maya Devi, by the way. And she used to love Buddha more than anything because it was her dream to have a child and BUudha was her only child. I will talk about his mother‚Äôs story after I finish talking about Buddha.\n\nBuddha grew up in the castle and he had never seen the outside world because it was full of people suffering and the king did not want to show it to him. And also because of someone telling him that he would be a life teacher (Guru). He was very well cared for by his stepmother, who loved him equally as his first mother. Later, he got married to Yashodhara. And one day, he finally stepped out to the outside world. All he saw was suffering. He then got so many questions in his mind about the outside world as he had never seen it before. He then thought to go and find out his answers. He went somewhere in India to a place named Bodhgaya.\n\nHe might have stayed there for years. He meditated for some say for weeks like somewhere around 49 days i.e 4 weeks. Who knows how long he meditated. And when he finally woke up, he had all the answers to his questions. He then followed the path of rulers no more. He started the be a general philosopher, mendicant, meditator, spiritual teacher, and religious leader. He taught so many people lessons of life. And that is why this day is so important to us. And he did not die. I believe that he still lives in our hearts. Showing life lessons to us from his meditation and leading us the correct path of life.\n\nAnd now, as I promised, about his mother‚Äôs back story. She always wanted a child and always looked out of the window, at a family of a bird in a tree outside a window. It always made her happy when she was so sad. And one day in her dream, a white elephant that entered the right side of her stomach. That was the first sign of having a baby. The very next day, she was seen to have a baby. The king became so happy.\n\nThe queen also always took herself in nature so that the child in her stomach (Buddha) would be very familiar and like nature. And he did. He was born on a trip in the middle of a jungle. The queen, Maya Devi, returned to the palace as soon as she could. Well, then life was normal, she had a child. She was happy. Until one day, the bird family or a bird of it died. Then, Maya got so upset she got depressed and eventually died.\n\nAnd today, on this day, the government of Nepal had announced to light the bulbs or lights of your roof or balcony at 7:00 PM. And we have done so. And I wanted to say, ‚ÄúHappy Buddha Jayanti‚Äù. And the information I told might not be so relevant because some of the information is from the internet. Ok then!! Bye!!"
