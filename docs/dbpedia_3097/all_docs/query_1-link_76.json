        "text": "Vishnu Raj Atreya (Nepali: विष्णुराज आत्रेय; 10 November 1944 – July 18, 2020) was a Nepali writer and poet, who wrote in Nepali language, Sanskrit language and Awadhi language. He used the title Latosaathi (Nepali: लाटोसाथी) (meaning: mute friend) in his poetry works since 1963 A.D. He is considered to be the first person to start writing Haiku in Sanskrit language.\n\nLife\n\nEarly life\n\nAtreya was born on 10 November 1944 as the first son of Dev Raj Upadhayaya and Sharada Devi in Rashminilaya, Kapilvastu, Nepal. His father Dev Raj and grandfather Rashmi Raj both were Sanskrit scholars. He was intelligent since his childhood. He attained his basic education under the custodianship of his father (who was a teacher in Tauleshwor Sanskrit Pathshala) and his grandfather Rashmi Raj. He started his education from Harihar Sanskrit Vidhyapeeth, Khidim (now affiliated to Nepal Sanskrit University). He then went to India for further education, where he completed undergraduate in Sankhya-Yog-Puran-History from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. He finished his master's degree in Navya Vyakarana from Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya, Varanasi. He further completed master's degree in Nepali and Political Science from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. He then completed his PhD in Navya Vyakarana from Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya, Varanasi, India. He was visiting professor at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya, Varanasi, India and professor at Nepal Sanskrit University, Valmiki Vidyapeeth, Kathmandu, Nepal. He retired after 47 years of teaching.\n\nFamily\n\nHe was married to Guneshwori Acharya (Arya Atreya after marriage) in July 1974.\n\nHealth\n\nIn early 2019, Atreya suffered from Gallbladder cancer. He was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, India, for four months. He has been undergoing treatment at Patan Hospital, Lalitpur.

He believed that literature itself is mute and a person adds life and sense to it. This might be the reason that he added 'Latosaathi' as his literary title. He has expressed this view in his first short-epic 'कपिलवस्तु' (Kapilvastu) as:\n\nPoet of the nation, Madhav Prasad Ghimire writes his view on Atreya's Latosathi title as: \"I think Atreya was influenced from द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया (dwa suparna sayuja sakhaya) from Rigveda. The metaphore of that bird of Rigveda is life that undergoes karma and god who looks after as a witness. As such, Latosathi is that clever friend who looks after his friends as a witness. If I would ask him about this, he would not speak but write sarcasm on deformed society and social Distortion and simply keep on laughing.\"\n\nWorks\n\nSocial works\n\nAtreya has been involved in various social works throughout his life.
