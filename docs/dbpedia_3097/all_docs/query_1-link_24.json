        "text": "Brief life sketch of Adikavi BhanuBhakta Acharya (1814 – 1868)\n\nJacob Sundas\n\nDimapur\n\nIndia Gorkha are the Nepali speaking community in India, hence, it is the duty of every Gorkhali to preserve the Nepali Language like other communities preserve their own. Gorkhas celebrate Bhanu jayanti not just for merry making or for entertainment. Birth anniversary of Adikavi Bhanu Bhakta Acharya should be observed as literary day by the Gorkha community. Bhanu Jayanti is celebrated to remember that Great Poet who had used Nepali script for the first time to write a Nepali poem also he has played a big role in the formation of our Nepali language. Birth anniversary of Aadi Kavi Bhanu Bhakta Acharya is celebrated by Nepali speakers in Nepal, India and all over the world on 13th July.\n\nBhanu Bhakta Acharya is the first poet of the Nepali language. He is highly honoured for using Nepali script for the first time to write a Nepali poem in the local dialect about many years ago. Bhanubhakta’s has much more major literary work in Nepali.\n\nFirst poem written by Adi Kavi Bhanu Bhakta Acharya\n\nHe gives his life to cutting grass and earns little money,\n\nhe hopes to make a well for his people so he will be remembered after death,\n\nthis high thinking grass-cutter lives in poverty,\n\nI have achieved nothing though I have much wealth.\n\nI have neither made rest houses nor a well, all my riches are inside my house.\n\nThis grass-cutter has opened my eyes today,\n\nmy life is worthless if the memory of my existence fades away.\n\nBhanubhakta was born in a very wealthy Brahmin family of Chundiramgha, Tanahu, Nepal in 1871. His Grandfather Shri Krishna Acharya who was very well known of his time. He received an excellent education with a strong leaning towards religion at home from his grandfather. When Bhanubhakta was 22 years, he was influenced by an incident so much that made him to turn out a poet. One day he encountered a grass-cutter and in their conversation he found that the grass-cutter wanted to give something to society so that he could be remembered after death too. After listening to the grass-cutter answer Bhanubhakta felt ashamed of himself. It not only sparked literary creativity in Bhanubhakta but also inspired him to do something noble. He had used Nepali script for the first time to write a Nepali poem. Bhanubhakta Acharya died in 23rd April 1868. Nepali literature legend Bhanubhakta is the one who started to write poems in Nepali so that an average Nepali could also grasp the taste of words and literature. At that time poems and formal literature were in the Sanskrit language, in this sense there was a great need and importance of scholars who could understand and explain the Sanskrit language. It was difficult for the common people to understand literature and artistic expression in the simplest sense. Bhanubhakta simplified the words and meanings and made literature accessible to everyone, a common Nepali was able to grasp the literary sense in his own language. Today, his books have become so popular that the people in and outside Nepal, especially in rural areas, have made it a friend of happiness, sorrow, inspiration and problem. If one visits the rural religious rites, rituals and marriages, one can find people reciting the rhythmic rhymes of the epic. Even the people in the deep forest, where they graze their cattle, keep reciting the verses rhythmically. This literary creation of Bhanu Bhakta has remained in the tongue, heart and hand of the people. And because of his noble work Bhanubhakta and Nepali language became synonym in Nepali literature. Poet Bhanubhakta was not only a romantic but a satiric poet too. Other remarkable books by him are Badhu Sikshya, Bhakta Mala, Prasnottar Mala Kantipuri Nagari, etc. is also popular among the Nepali literateure.\n\nIn the memory of Bhanubhakta, Bhanu Jayanti is celebrated in Nepal, Darjeeling, Sikkim and other regions of India and all over the world with Nepali speaking society, be it Myanmar, Nepal, India, Bhutan or anywhere. Bhanubhakta is not only a poet but also a master of Nepali language and the rhythm of Bhanubhakta is still alive in every Nepali tongue. Bhanu Bhakta Acharya is regarded as Aadi Kabi, means the beginner poet or the first poet of Nepali language.\n\nIt is his creation that Nepali language has become very popular among the people. It is his creation that laid the foundation of Nepali literature. Thus, people pay due respect and honor him every year on 13th July as Bhanu Jayanti. Today, all over the worlds, where there are Nepali speaking people are residing, will be commemorating his 207th birth anniversary. Gorkhas of Nagaland will also be commemorating his anniversary on 13th July 2021. Bhanu Jayanti, the birthday of Nepali pioneer poet “Adikavi” Bhanubhakta Acharya, it is celebrated on July 13 every year as a symbol of nationality by Nepalese who are in and outside the country.\n\nWe the Gorkhas of Nagaland also commemorate his anniversary though he was not born to Nagaland soil because we are speaking the language, of which foundation was laid by him. Gorkhas of Nagaland people still recite his creation and utmost love and respect. They too have used his books as their friend whether they are in problem, happiness or sorrow. He is very popular in the community. Thus, Gorkhas of Nagaland celebrate his anniversary with self-volunteerism, as we feel that he owes this respect and honour. We celebrate his anniversary in respect to the foundation of language laid by him. It will not be sufficient just on publishing poems and literary works on his name; we should also make our new generation to know about him and pay respect to him through at least commemorating his anniversary every year."
