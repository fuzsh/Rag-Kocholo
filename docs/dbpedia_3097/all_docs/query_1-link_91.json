Then, discuss the similarities and\n\ndifferences between Nepal and each of the neighbouring countries.\n\nReading\n\nLike a family, a country also has its neighbours. For example, India and China\n\nas you read in Grade IV, are the immediate neighbours of Nepal. There are\n\nother neighbours of Nepal. In this lesson, you will learn about them.\n\nBhutan\n\nBhutan, officially the Kingdom of Bhutan, is a\n\nlandlocked country in South Asia. It is located\n\nin the eastern part of the Himalayas. Like\n\nNepal, Bhutan is surrounded by India in the\n\nsouth, east and west and China in the north. It\n\nhas an area of 38,394 sq.km.\n\nPhysical features\n\nThe land consists mostly of steep and high mountains, crisscrossed by a\n\nnetwork of swift rivers. Broadly, Bhutan can be divided into mountains, hills,\n\nvalleys and plains. The northern part of the country has mountains, the central\n\npart has hills and the southern part is lowland plains. The north is cold, south\n\nis hot but the hills and valleys have moderate climate like Nepal.\n\nSocial life and economy\n\nMost of the Bhutanese are Buddhists. They follow Tibetan culture and\n\ntradition. Buddha Jayanti and Lhosar are the main festivals. Men wear bakhu\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 101\n\nand docha and women wear kira. The national language is Dzonkha. In the\n\nsouthern part of the country, Bhutanese of Nepali origin live. Their lifestyle\n\nis similar to Nepali people. They speak Nepali and celebrate Nepali festivals.\n\nNgultrum is the currency of Bhutan. Bhutan's economy is based on agricuture,\n\nforestry and tourism. More than 80 percent of the population depend on\n\nagriculture for the livelihood. Majority of the farmers practise agriculture\n\nbased on traditional methods. The major crops include: rice, maize, wheat\n\nand potatoes. Cash crops like apple, mandarin orange and cardamom are also\n\ncultivated for export. Cottage industries produce handicrafts.\n\nBangladesh\n\nBangladesh, officially the People's Republic\n\nof Bangladesh, is situated to the south-east\n\nof Nepal. It is bordered by India on three\n\nsides and the Bay of Bengal on the south.\n\nThe name Bangladesh means \"Country of\n\nBengal\" in the official Bengali language. The\n\ntotal area of Bangladesh is 143,998 sq km. It\n\nhas a population of about 165.18 million as of\n\nSeptember 2017.

It has low hills in the eastern and northeastern regions. The Ganges,\n\nBrahmaputra and Padma are the major rivers of Bangladesh. The climate\n\nremains hot in this country. In the summer, it rains heavily and the winter is\n\ncold and dry. Bangladesh often has to struggle aganst hurricanes and floods.\n\nSocial life and economy\n\nA typical household in Bangladesh includes several generations of an extended\n\nfamily.

Women commonly wear sari, but girls and younger\n\nwomen prefer shalwar kamiz. Bangladeshis mostly eat rice, pulses and fish.\n\n102 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nThe currency of Bangladesh is 'Taka'. Jute is the main basis of economy.\n\nBangladesh grows a significant quantity of rice, tea, potato, mango, onion\n\nand mustard. Although two-thirds of Bangladeshis are farmers, more than 75\n\npercent of export earnings come from the garment industry.\n\nPakistan\n\nPakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of\n\nPakistan, is situated to the far west of Nepal. It is\n\nsurrounded by India in the east, and Afghanistan\n\nand China in the north. Arabian Sea is to the south\n\nof Pakistan.\n\nPakistan has four provinces and four federal\n\nterritories. With a population of about 197.42 million\n\nas of September, 2017, it is the sixth most populous country in the world and\n\nhas the second largest Muslim population after Indonesia. The total area is\n\n796,096 sq km and the capital city is Islamabad.\n\nPhysical features\n\nPakistan is divided into four regions.\n\nThe north-western frontier region: This includes Hindu Kush and the\n\nHimalayan ranges. There are rivers and passes. Khyber pass is in this region.\n\nThe south-western region: This includes the plateaus of Baluchistan. This\n\narea is dry and barren.\n\nThe north-eastern region: This region mainly consists of plateaus and usually\n\nremains dry and barren.\n\nThe southeastern region: This is the most fertile region of the country. The\n\narea is irrigated by Indus River.\n\nPakistan is very hot in summer and cold in winter. Jacobabad, the hottest place\n\nin Asia, lies in Pakistan.\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 103\n\nSocial life and economy\n\nPakistan is an Islamic agricultural society. The family organization is strongly\n\npatriarchal. Most people live in large extended families. The oldest male,\n\nwhether he is the father, grandfather, or paternal uncle, is the family leader. He\n\nmakes all significant decisions regarding the family. Traditionally, a woman's\n\nplace in society has been secondary to that of men. Pakistani people eat bread,\n\ndal, vegetables and meat. Men wear salwar and shirt and women wear kurta\n\nand salwar. Many women wear burka. Eid is the biggest festival.\n\nThe currency of Pakistan is Rupee.

The first group represents Sri Lanka, the\n\nsecond group represents Afghanistan and the third groups represents the\n\nMaldives. Working in the group, make a list of facts/ information you know\n\nabout the country you represent. Then, share the information with the class.\n\nReading\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSri Lanka, officially the Democratic\n\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is\n\nlocated to the far south of Nepal. It\n\nis an island. Until 1972, Sri Lanka\n\nwas called Ceylon. It is surrounded\n\nby the Indian Ocean on all sides.\n\nThe total area of this country is\n\n65,610 sq km. The total population\n\nis about 20.9 million as of September 2017. The capital city is Colombo.\n\nPhysical features\n\nGeographically, Sri Lanka can be divided into three regions: Coastal Region,\n\nNorthern Rocky Region and Central Hilly Region. Because the country is\n\nsurrounded by ocean, much of Sri Lanka is made up of coastal regions. In the\n\ncoastal region, there are forests, lakes and coconut trees. The northern part of\n\nthe country is rocky. The central part has low hills.\n\nThe climate of Sri Lanka is tropical and warm. Mostly rainfall occurs in the\n\nsummer and winter. There are about 100 rivers in the country and the longest\n\nof them is Mahaweli River.\n\n106 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nSocial life and economy\n\nMost Sri Lankans live in small houses made of wood, bamboo, clay and mud.\n\nHowever, in towns and cities, they live in big concrete buildings. Sri Lankans\n\nenjoy rice and fish. Most people follow Buddhism. As it is a hot country, men\n\nwear shirts and lungis and women wear saris and blouses.\n\nThough Sinhali is the national language of the country, people speak both Tamil\n\nand English. Sri Lanka has a high literacy rate in South Asia. Education is free\n\nup to the university level and more than 90 percent people in this country are\n\neducated.\n\nRupee is the currency of Sri Lanka. The main economic sectors of the country\n\nare tourism and agriculture. Sri Lanka produces tea, rubber, coffee, sugar\n\nand other agricultural goods and exports them to other countries. Many Sri\n\nLankans are employed in Middle Eastern countries.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nAfghanistan, officially\n\nthe Islamic Republic\n\nof Afghanistan, is a\n\nlandlocked country.\n\nPakistan lies to the\n\nsouth east, Iran to the\n\nwest, Turkmenistan,\n\nUzbekistan and\n\nTajikistan to the north,\n\nand China to the far\n\nnortheast. The total area of the country is about 6,52,000 sq km. The population\n\nis about 34.31 million as of September 2017. The capital city is Kabul.\n\nPhysical features\n\nIt is a landlocked mountainous country. It has plains in the north and southwest.\n\nIt has a continental climate with very harsh winters in the central highlands.\n\nThere are many rivers and reservoirs. A large part of the country is dry. Coal,\n\ncopper, iron ore, lithium, uranium, chromite, gold, zinc, talc, barites, sulphur,\n\nlead, marble, precious and semi-precious stones, natural gas and petroleum,\n\namong other, are the major natural resources found in the country.\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 107\n\nSocial life and economy\n\nFamily is the most important institution in the Afghan society. A typical Afghan\n\nfamily is patriarchal. Though polygyny (multiple wives) is permitted, it is not\n\npractised widely. Within families, Afghanis respect the elderly people. Men\n\nwear long knee-length dresses with the baggy trousers called 'Perahan Tunban'\n\nor (Kamiz Shalwar). Women wear long dresses made of cotton. They also wear\n\nhead scarfs and flat shoes known as paizar.\n\nThe currency of Afghanistan is Afghani. For many poor farmers, poppy\n\ncultivation is an important source of income. Agriculture is another source of\n\nincome. Afghanistan produces wheat, fruits, nuts, etc.\n\nThe Maldives\n\nThe Maldives, officially\n\nthe Republic of Maldives,\n\nalso referred to as the\n\nMaldive Islands, is an\n\nisland nation in the\n\nIndian Ocean. It is the\n\nsmallest country in\n\nSouth Asia. It is also the\n\ncountry with the lowest\n\nsea-level in the world,\n\nat 2.3 metres (7 fit, 7 inch). The total area of the country is 298 sq. km. Total\n\npopulation is about 37.7 million as of September 2017 The capital city is Male.\n\nPhysical features\n\nThe Maldives is comprised of more than 1200 islands. Only 200 islands are\n\ninhabited by people. There are no hills and mountains in the Maldives. The\n\nbiggest island is about 6 km long. More than 80 percent of the country's land is\n\nless than one meter above the sea level. Due to high level of salt in the soil near\n\nthe beach, vegetation is limited. A few plants such as shrubs, flowering plants,\n\nand small hedges are found. It is a hot country.\n\nSocial life and economy\n\nIslam is the main religion of the country. People mostly eat rice and fish. As\n\nthe country has very little land to grow crops, it depends mostly on fishing.\n\nTourism is another important part of the economy. About 98% of people are\n\nliterate. The currency is Rufiyaa.\n\n108 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nFree the Words\n\ncoastal : located on a sea coast\n\ntropical : hot\n\nliteracy rate : education status\n\ncontinental : relating to a continent\n\npoppy : opium plant\n\nhedge : a row of small trees or shrubs\n\nIn-class Activities\n\nComplete the table below with the facts and information from the lesson.\n\nName of the Bordered by Crops Climate Food\n\ncountry Indian Ocean Continental\n\non all sides climate\n\nSri Lanka\n\nAfghanistan\n\nMaldives Almost no\n\ncrops grow:\n\nrice and fish\n\nare used for\n\nfood\n\nExercise\n\n1.

Why is it round in shape? It also spins.\n\nWhat might be the reason? Discuss in the class.\n\nReading\n\nHave you ever seen a map and a globe? You must have. A map can be hung\n\non the wall. A globe stands on the table. This is the basic difference between a\n\nmap and a globe.\n\nWhat is a globe then? A globe is a small model of the Earth. It shows the\n\ncontinents and the oceans of the Earth on its surface. A globe spins on an axis.\n\nThe globe's axis is a metal stick stuck through its center. The globe has an axis\n\nso it shows us how the Earth spins. The Earth has an axis, too, but it doesn't\n\nspin on a metal stick. The Earth's axis is an imaginary line drawn through its\n\ncenter from its North Pole to South Pole.\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 111\n\nWhat is a map? A map is a picture of the Earth's surface. It shows how things\n\nare related to each other by distance, direction, and size. Maps record definite\n\nfacts of climate, vegetation, materials over earth, continents, countries and\n\nstates. So we can see land, water, countries, capitals, rivers, lakes, mountains,\n\netc. on a map. A person who makes maps is called a cartographer.\n\nMaps help us find our way from one place to another. They show where things\n\nor places are located. Maps can be used to show how far one place is from\n\nanother. Collectively, globes and maps help us in the following ways: They\n\n• show the name of the country\n\n• show the boundaries of a country\n\n• show the capital city of the country\n\n• show the terrain of the land\n\n• show the routes of big rivers\n\n• show the water area\n\n• show the road network\n\n• indicate the approximate longitude and latitude of the place\n\n• show time zones\n\nIn some cases they show vegetation, mineral deposits, earthquake belts,\n\ntemperature zones, humidity, etc.\n\nColour is very important in understanding globes and maps. In the globes and\n\nmaps, the part of land is marked with green, yellow and brown colours. Green\n\nrefers to plains; yellow refers to hills and brown refers to high mountains.\n\nThese three colours on globes and maps also show the continents. A continent\n\nis a group of countries. There are seven continents in the world. They are Asia,\n\nAfrica, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe and Australia.\n\nAnother important colour used in maps and globes is blue. The water portion\n\nof the Earth is marked with blue. The blue part of the globe shows seas and\n\noceans. A sea is a large mass of salty water that covers the Earth's surface. An\n\nocean is much larger than a sea. Actually, a sea is a part of an ocean. There are\n\nfive oceans on the Earth. They are Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean,\n\nArctic Ocean and Antarctic Ocean.\n\n112 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nFree the Words\n\nmodel : copy\n\nspin : to turn round and round\n\naxis : imaginary line at the center of globe\n\ncollectively : together\n\nIn-class Activities\n\nImagine that your birthday is tomorrow.

Closely study the map. Then find out\n\nthe district where your school is. Also mark your home district. Try freely\n\ndrawing the map of Nepal on a plain sheet of paper and show it to your\n\nteacher.\n\nReading\n\nMethods of Drawing a Map\n\nA map is the proportional representation of land surface on paper. There are\n\ndifferent methods of drawing a map. We need to survey an area to prepare an\n\noriginal map. We need instruments such as chain, tape, prismatic compass and\n\nplain table. We can draw the map of our classroom as shown below with the\n\nhelp of a chain and tape.\n\nScale 1 cm = 2 feet\n\nThere are different methods of drawing a map. Tracing, copying, carboning,\n\ngraphic or square methods are the commonly used ways of drawing a map.\n\nAmong them, the graphic method is very useful to practise drawing the map\n\nof Nepal. If we memorize the extension of map in a graph, we can draw it\n\neasily without looking at it.\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 115\n\n4 cm\n\n4 cm\n\n4 cm\n\n4 cm 6 cm 6 cm 4 cm\n\nHow to draw a map of Nepal:\n\ni.

Now join the dots shown in the above map.\n\nv. If you have confidence to draw the map of Nepal, erase graph and show\n\nonly the map.\n\nvi. Finally, draw the border line, the north line, scale, index and use different\n\nsymbols to show other details on the map.\n\nvii. Your completed map of Nepal should look like the one given below.\n\n116 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nMaps give us information about different facts. With the help of map we\n\ncan recognise rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, etc. of any place. But these\n\nthings cannot be shown directly in a map. Therefore, we use certain\n\nsigns to show them. We call these signs as symbols or index. Some of the\n\nimportant symbols used to represent facts in map are given below.\n\nFact Symbols\n\nMountain\n\nRiver\n\nRoad\n\nLake\n\nCity\n\nCapital\n\nFree the Words\n\nDraw the points of the map of Nepal as shown in your book and practise\n\ndrawing the map of Nepal. After drawing the map, write the title, draw\n\nnorth line, scale and border line on it.\n\nExercise\n\n1. Fill in the gaps.\n\na.

His home is in Simle\n\nRural Municipality. He heard about a female revolutionary from his village.\n\nHe wanted to know more about her. He visited the school library and searched\n\nin the history books but he was unable to find her name mentioned. He then\n\nsat down in front of the computer and googled “Yogmaya Neupane.” He\n\nfound one story published in Republica daily of March 4, 2011. The story was\n\nwritten by Bikash Sangraula and the title was “Yogmaya Neupane: Nepal’s\n\nFirst Female Revolutionary.” Reading the story, this is what Raman came to know\n\nabout her.\n\nYogmaya Neupane was born between 1860 and 1868\n\nin Simle, Bhojpur. She was the only daughter of her\n\nparents. She was married to a Koirala boy when she was\n\nbetween five and nine years old. The boy died soon after\n\nthe marriage. After that, her in-laws sent her to maiti\n\n(maternal home).\n\nShe attacked the social tradition that prohibited a widow\n\nto marry again. Between 1903 and 1916 AD, Yogmaya\n\ngave up her family and began travelling to holy places.\n\nLater she decided to lead the life of an ascetic. She set\n\nup an ashram and lived there. She soon accumulated many followers and\n\norganized them into the country’s first Nari Samiti (women’s committee). The\n\ncommittee raised its voice against the exploitation of women, child marriage\n\nand polygamy (marrying more than one woman or man).\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 121\n\nWithin a few years of its activity, the committee submitted a 24-point petition\n\nto Rana Prime Minister, Chandra Shamsher, stating the problems women were\n\nfacing.\n\nAfter the death of Chandra Shamsher, Neupane and her disciples came to\n\nKathmandu and met and discussed the matter with Juddha Shamsher. Neupane\n\nwas offered a plate full of gold coins, but she refused to stay silent. Instead\n\nshe demanded reforms. Juddha Shamsher promised reforms but instead\n\nof working on the promised reforms, the government executed four of her\n\nfollowers in 1940 AD. Neupane and her followers lost hope. In protest of the\n\ngovernment’s actions she and 68 other disciples committed jal-samadhi (mass\n\nsuicide by drowning), by jumping into the Arun River on July 14, 1941. Before\n\nthey plunged into the river they hollered: “May the unjust Rana government be\n\ndestroyed!” Seventy years later, a statue of Yogmaya was unveiled in Bhojpur\n\non March 8, 2011 on the occasion of International Women’s Day.\n\nRaman was happy to know about the woman warrior of his own village but\n\nhe was curious as to whether there were other such people in the past. Raman\n\nthought there must be other such individuals from Nepal whose history is\n\nunknown to us. Acquiring historical knowledge is not always easy. There aren't\n\nbooks written on every subject. But there always is a solution for students who\n\nwant to learn about the past. Let us learn about the sources of history.\n\nThere are no reliable written documents on the history of ancient Nepal but\n\nthere are varieties of historical monuments, coins, temples, religious images\n\nand inscriptions. We call them sources of history. Some sources of history are\n\npresented below:\n\nChronicles : Chronicles are called bamsawali in Nepali. They are the main\n\nhistorical sources of ancient Nepal. Most available chronicles were written in\n\nor about 1800 A. D. The latest one was written by a Buddhist monk of Patan\n\nduring the time of King Rana Bahadur Shah. A short history of the king and\n\nsome important events related to him are included in this chronicle.\n\nStone Inscriptions: Stone inscriptions, or silalekh, are\n\nanother source of history. In the olden days when\n\npaper was not available, people used to write on\n\nstones. Such inscriptions are found in the temples\n\nand palaces of Nepal. Do you remember the message\n\npraising Balabhadra Kunwar inscripted in stone?\n\nThe Lichchhavi inscription at the temple of Changu\n\nNarayan is the oldest available stone inscription in Nepal.\n\n122 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nCopper Inscriptions: A copper inscription, or tamrapatra, is a plate of copper\n\nwith words and sentences on it. There are many copper inscriptions in Nepal.\n\nAncient Buildings, Temples and Stupas:\n\nAncient buildings, temples, stupas, statues\n\nand wooden and metal images are other\n\nreliable sources of history. They provide clear\n\nevidence of the excellence of the Nepalese art\n\nand sculpture. The most historical temples in\n\nNepal are Changu Narayan, Pashupatinath,\n\nHanuman Dhoka, Krishna Mandir of Patan,\n\nthe Nyatapol (five-storey) of Bhaktapur, Swayambhunath, Baudhanath and\n\nMahabaudha.\n\nAncient Coins: Different kinds of coins, on which names of the sun, the moon,\n\nhorses, bulls, etc., are imprinted, have been found in different places. These\n\ncoins show the character, work, tastes and religions of the kings of that time.\n\nArchaeological Findings: Ancient vessels, coins, utensils, images and stone-\n\ntaps have been disovered at Tilaurakot, Lumbini, Bishalnagar, Lazimpat and\n\nRatna Park. They also hold great historical value.\n\nMuseums: Museums collect and keep old weapons, pictures of kings and\n\nqueens. The National Museum at Chhauni has a lot of such relics. There are\n\nother equally important museums in Nepal.\n\nIf we find such sources of history like coins, tamrapatras or silalekhs or statues, we\n\nshould preserve them. They are valuable assets of the country and important\n\nsources of knowledge.\n\nFree the Words\n\nrevolutionary : a person who supports or starts revolution\n\nprohibit : to ban\n\nwidow : a woman whose husband has died\n\nascetic : to remain away from physical pleasure\n\naccumulate : gather\n\npetition : written document that demands change\n\ndisciple : follower\n\nexecute : kill\n\nhollered : called out loudly\n\nunveil : to make public, to show\n\ninscription : words that are written on coin, stone, etc.\n\nrelic : an object that has historical and cultural importance\n\ntemperament : nature\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 123\n\nIn-class Activities\n\nWork in a group.

Have you ever thought about the meaning of your\n\nplace? What does the name of your place mean? How was it named? Think\n\nabout it and share your views with the class. If you do not know, ask your\n\nparents or elders in your community.\n\nReading\n\nNepal is first mentioned in the late\n\nVedic text, Atharvaveda Parisista,\n\nas a place exporting blankets.\n\nIn Samundragupta’s Allahabad\n\ninscription it is mentioned as a\n\nbordering country. The ‘Skanda\n\nPurana’ has a separate chapter\n\nknown as ‘Nepal Mahatmya’,\n\nwhich explains the beauty and\n\npower of Nepal. Nepal is also\n\nmentioned in the Hindu religious text, Narayana Puja. So Nepal has a long\n\nhistory. In Grade IV, you read about how this country got the name, Nepal.\n\nThe early history of Nepal begins from that point of time.\n\nAccording to mythology, it is said that Kathmandu valley was a big lake in\n\nthe past. After Manjushree drained the water by cutting the Chovar hills,\n\nKathmandu valley became suitable for people to live. The earliest people to\n\nlive in Kathmandu are said to be the Gopals.\n\nGopal Dynasty\n\nIt is said that by the end of Dwapara Yuga, a demon called Danasur submerged\n\nthe valley by blocking its water outlet. Lord Krishna came from Dwarika and\n\nkilled the demon. The Gopals came with him. These Gopals began ruling over\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 125\n\nthe valley. They kept cows and made curd and ghee. Gopals were also called\n\nNeep or Nep. It is said that the name Nepal came from these words. The first\n\nking of Gopal dynasty was king Bhuktaman. Gopal kings ruled for about 521\n\nyears. The last Gopal king was Yakshya Gupta. The capital of the Gopal rulers\n\nwas Matatirtha.\n\nMahispal Dyansty\n\nYaksha Gupta, the last of the Gopal kings, was childless. So after his death\n\nthere was no heir to succeed the throne. Then, Jaya Singh, a Mahispal, became\n\nthe king. Mahispals were also called Abhir. Unlike Gopals, Mahispals kept\n\nbuffaloes. Mahis is the Sanskrit word for buffalo. Three Mahispal kings ruled\n\nthe country. The last king of this dynasty was Bhuwan Singh. During Bhuwan\n\nSingh’s time, Kirati king Yalambar attacked the valley and began to rule.\n\nDuring the Mahispal rule, people kept animals and farmed for a living.\n\nKirat Age\n\nKirat kings began ruling over the valley from about 700 BC.\n\nThe first Kirati king was Yalambar. About 29 Kirat kings\n\nruled over Nepal for a period spanning 526 years. It is said\n\nthat Lord Gautam Buddha visited Kathmandu during the\n\nrule of Jitedasti, the seventh Kirati king. Kiratis loved arts\n\nand commerce. They were good rulers. They treated men\n\nand women equally. They followed the Hindu religion. They\n\nworshipped Shiva. Kirati rulers built the Kirateshwar temple. The last King of the\n\nKirat dynasty was Gasti. He was a weak ruler and finally lost to the Lichchhabis.\n\nLichchhabi Era\n\nThe Lichchhabi rule began in Nepal after the end of\n\nthe Kirat dynasty at about 400 AD. Mandev, Shivadev\n\nI, Amshuverma and Narendra Dev were the famous\n\nLichchhabi kings of Nepal. Lichchhabi kings established\n\ntrade with Tibet and India and developed art and culture\n\nin the country. Lichchhabi kings were scholars, and they\n\nspread the importance of education too. Therefore, the\n\nLichchhabi period is also called the golden period of Nepali\n\nhistory.\n\n126 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nFree the Words\n\nmention : state, say\n\ninscription : words written on stones or metals\n\ndrain : empty\n\nsubmerge : go under water\n\nspan : measure\n\nIn-class Activities\n\nDivide the class into four groups, each group representing a ruling dynasty\n\nof ancient Nepal:Gopal, Mahishpal, Kirat, and Lichchhabi.

Many people have helped\n\nto make Napal a great nation. We call such figures national luminaries. In this\n\nlesson and the next, you will study about some of them.\n\nJanak\n\nJanak was the king of Mithila, which is the present day Janakpur.\n\nHis real name was Seeradhwaj. Janak was not only a brave\n\nking but was well-versed in the shastras and Vedas. He was\n\na spiritual person and loved knowledge. Many people came\n\nto his court to solve their problems.

He was a learned, bold and\n\nfarsighted king. He maintained a good diplomatic relation\n\nwith Tibet by getting his daughter Bhrikuti married to\n\nSongston Gampo, the king of Tibet. He was also a lover of\n\nart, architecture and literature. He built Kailashkut Bhawan.\n\nHe spread Nepali art and architecture to countries like\n\nChina and Japan. Amshuverma's regime became a boon to the Lichchhabis. So\n\nit came to be called the golden age.\n\nAraniko\n\nAraniko's real name was Balabahu. He was a Nepali architect.\n\nHe was born in the 13th century (1244 AD) in Kathmandu\n\nValley. The literal meaning of his name in Chinese was\n\n'ara' meaning 'a woman' and 'niko' which means 'face like'.\n\nHe led a group of 80 artisans at the age of 17, crossed the\n\nHimalayas and designed and built many masterpieces in\n\nChina in 1310 (1367 BS). His most renowned work of architecture, the White\n\nStupa of Miaoying Temple in Beijing, can still be seen today. His art was so\n\ngood that the emperor Kublai Khan was impressed by him.\n\nGautam Buddha\n\nGautam Buddha was born in Lumbini in 563 BC. He\n\nwas a prince and led a comfortable life in the palace.\n\nHe was married to Yasodhara and had a son, Rahul.\n\nBut he was not happy seeing other people suffer. He\n\nwanted to know the cause of human suffering. At the\n\nage of 29, he left the palace to find the truth of life.\n\nLater, he founded Buddhism. He is the primary figure\n\nof Buddhism. He is called the light of Asia.\n\n130 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nFree the Words\n\nluminary : an inspiring person\n\nspiritual : concerned with religion\n\nfoundling : a child who has been left and whose parents are unknown\n\nfurrow : a long and narrow line made by plough\n\nabduct : to take somebody to an undisclosed location against his/her will\n\nincarnation : epitome, avatar\n\nfarsighted : visionary, able to predict the future\n\ndiplomatic : related to a foreign country\n\nboon : blessing\n\nmasterpiece : the best work of art\n\nIn-class Activities\n\nWork in a group.

They\n\nwere called principalities. King Prithvi Narayan Shah\n\nunified these states into one strong nation, Nepal.\n\nAfterwards, Nepal became bigger and bigger. His\n\nstory of victory begins with the conquering of Nuwakot\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 133\n\nin 1744 (1801 BS). After Nuwakot, he began his plan to attack Kathmandu\n\nValley. First, he attacked Kirtipur but he could only conquer Kirtipur in the\n\nthird attempt. After conquering Kirtipur, he defeated Kathmandu, Patan and\n\nBhaktapur and made Kathmandu the capital of Nepal in 1769 (1825 BS).\n\nAmar Singh Thapa\n\nAmar Singh Thapa was a great hero of the national\n\nunification era.

He played a very crucial role in extending\n\nthe boundaries of Nepal to Tista in the east.\n\nHe unified many small kingdoms into Nepal. He\n\nconquered Kumaun, Gadhwal and Kangada. All these places are now in India.\n\nBut they belonged to Nepal until 1816 (1873 BS). His major achievement was\n\nthe annexation of several western states like Jumla, Dehradun, Srinagar and\n\nPalpa. But after the Sugauli Treaty, Nepal lost a lot of territory to the British\n\nIndia. He was very sad because of this. Then he retired from his job and went\n\nto Gosaikunda. He died in Gosaikunda in 1816 (1873 BS).\n\nBalbhadra Kunwar\n\nBalbhadra Kunwar is a national hero of Nepal.

During the Anglo-Nepal War, Kunwar\n\nwas in-charge of Nalapani fort. He had built a fort at a\n\nheight of 500 feet. That fort was known as the Khalanga\n\nfort. He had about 600 troops with him. This included\n\nwomen and children. The British army, under General Gillespie, comprised of\n\n3500 soldiers. They had modern weapons like cannons and guns. But Nepali\n\nsoldiers only had Khukuris.\n\n134 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nHowever, Kunwar and his troops fought bravely. British soldiers were afraid of\n\nthem. So Gillespie sent a letter to Balbhadra one night asking him to surrender.\n\nBut Balbhadra did not agree. Rather, he challenged the British soldiers. The\n\nnext morning a great battle followed. British troops shot at Nepali soldiers\n\nwith guns and cannons. Nepali soldiers had only Khukuris to fight with. Still\n\nNepali soldiers killed Gillespie. After Gillespie was killed more British soldiers\n\ncame to Nalapani. They cut off water supply to Nalapani. Then Nepalis had to\n\nfight hungry and thirsty. So many Nepali soldiers were killed. At last only 70\n\nNepali soldiers were left. They had to leave the battlefield.\n\nBut British soldiers were very impressed by the bravery of Balbhadra Kunwar.\n\nAfter the war, the British East India Company erected a war memorial at\n\nNalapani to respect Gorkhalis and Capt Balbhadra Kunwar.

Actually, he had planned to drive away the\n\nBritish from South Asia. During his rule, Nepal\n\nfought against British India. This is known as the\n\nAnglo-Nepal War of 1814-16 (1871-73 BS). But\n\nsadly Nepal lost that war and the Sugauli Treaty\n\nwas signed.\n\nHe was a great reformer also. He built Sundhara\n\nand Dharahara. He also constructed patis\n\nand pauwas across the country.

Then, try to name other prime ministers who preceeded the\n\ncurrent one.\n\nReading\n\nThe President\n\nNepal was turned into a republican state on 15th Jesth, 2065. That means the\n\nking is no longer the head of the state. The country is governed by a President\n\nand politicians. But they are elected by people as their representatives. Before\n\nNepal became a republic the king used to be the head of the state. The Second\n\nMass Movement launched by Nepalese people from 24th Chaitra 2062 to 11th\n\nBaisakh 2063 ended the King's rule from Nepal. The important decisions made\n\non 4th Jesth 2063 curtailed all the powers of the king. Head of the state is like\n\nthe head of a family. In Nepal, president is the head of the state. The first\n\npresident of Nepal is Dr. Ram Baran Yadav. The second president is Bidhya\n\nDevi Bhandari. She is the first female president of Nepal. She was elected on\n\n28 October, 2015. The President carries out different functions.

Make a list of five relatives or persons you know in the\n\ncommunity. Write what each person does for a living. Also write why each\n\nperson’s work is important for the community.\n\nReading\n\nTo earn a living, people do different types of work and take up various\n\nprofessions and occupations. You have learned about professions and\n\noccupations in Grades III and IV. Professions and occupations are determined\n\nby geography, climate and people of the place. For example, people of Terai do\n\nnot rear yaks because Terai is a hot region. Likewise, people of the mountain\n\nregion cannot grow jute because the climate is not favourable for jute\n\nproduction. Therefore, profession depends on place, climate and people. Read\n\nabout the different professions and occupations of people of Sindhupalchowk.\n\nSindhupalchowk is largely a hilly district\n\nwith high mountains. People living in the\n\nhigh mountains raise sheep, and chauris\n\n(Himalayan cows) and grow potatoes. From\n\nmilk, they make cheese, ghee, chhurpi and\n\nother dairy products and sell them to nearby\n\ntowns. Potatoes grow in abundance in the\n\nhigh hills. They sell potatoes. They also\n\nmake bakkhu and radi.\n\nIn the lower hills, the ethnicity of the population is diverse. There are\n\nBrahmins, Chhetris, Thamis, etc. Some of the Brahmins are teachers. Chhetris\n\nare involved in trade. They trade goods from the neighbouring Khasa of China.\n\nMost Newars of this area are involved in business. They either run shops or\n\nown small factories that produce soap, biscuits, etc. Thamis make bamboo\n\narticles like doko, thunche, etc. They also work as labourers.\n\nOasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5 145\n\nMany people are farmers. They work in the\n\nfield and grow maize, millet, rice, wheat, etc.\n\nThey also raise buffaloes and cows and sell\n\nmilk to the nearby market.\n\nOthers work as masons. They know that each\n\njob is important and regard each occupation\n\nwith respect.\n\nFree the Words\n\ndetermine : to decide\n\nfavourable : good for something\n\nabundance : large in quantity\n\nmason : one who builds with stone, brick, etc.\n\nIn-class Activities\n\nLook up in your bag. List all the things you have in it. Then, write how each\n\nthing you have is produced. Who produces them? What kind of work is\n\nneeded to produce each item you possess?\n\nExercise\n\n1. State whether the following statements are True or False.\n\na. Work and profession are determined by geography.\n\nb. A part of Sindhupalchowk is Terai.\n\nc. Brahmins in the district are mostly involved in trade.\n\nd. Chhetris are engaged in trade.\n\ne. Jute, rice and tabacco are the major products of the district.\n\n146 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\n2. Answer these questions.\n\na. What determines people's profession and work?\n\nb. Give an example of how climate affects people's profession.\n\nc. What do people of the high mountains in Sindhupalchowk produce?\n\nd. What are some of the agricultural goods produced in the lower hills\n\nof the district?\n\ne. How is one work related with another?\n\n3. Write about different professions that people in your district are\n\nengaged in. You can begin like this.\n\nMy district is .......................... . It is a valley/hill/mountain. ....................\n\n............................................................................................................................\n\n............................................................................................................................\n\n4. Make a list of important places of your district. Write down the\n\nmajor economic activities of those places.\n\n5.

List as many\n\nthings as you notice around. Then, discuss how they are used and for what\n\npurpose. What happens if you break or lose a thing or two? How does your\n\nschool take care of things it possesses?\n\nReading\n\nAt your home you have furniture, books, TV set, kitchen utensils, etc. Do\n\nyou break the furniture? Do you smash the TV set? Do you throw kitchen\n\nutensils out? Do you spend all your money at once? Your answer to these\n\nquestions is ‘No’. We take care of our tools and utensils at home. We do not\n\nspend money unnecessarily; we must learn to economize. Caring for property\n\nand controlling expenses are essential skills that we must apply at school too.\n\nEconomizing means spending less money\n\nand not wasting things.\n\nA school is a second home for students.\n\nThere are a lot of goods, articles, tools\n\nand other properties in the school. In the\n\nclassroom, there are whiteboards, benches,\n\ndesks, bookracks and dustbins. We should\n\ntake proper care of these things. We should\n\nclean the blackboard/whiteboard after\n\nuse. We should not write on benches and\n\ndesks. A bookrack is meant for keeping\n\nbooks. We should use it for that purpose only. We should throw wrappers and\n\npaper-scraps into the dustbin. We should keep the classroom clean.\n\nIn the school library, there are books, magazines and newspapers. Students\n\nshould borrow books to study but they should not tear the pages of the book.\n\nAfter reading newspapers, they need to be kept in proper place.\n\n148 Oasis Social Studies & Creative Arts-5\n\nWe use sporting goods like football,\n\nbadminton rackets, table tennis bats,\n\nskipping ropes, etc. We should use these\n\nmaterials carefully so that they are not\n\ndamaged.\n\nIf students use school materials carelessly,\n\nthe school has to buy them again and that\n\nwill cost extra money. We should use school\n\nproperty as carefully as we use our own.\n\nFree the Words\n\nsmash : break\n\nexpense : something on which money is spent\n\nwrapper : piece of paper, plastic that is used to wrap food, clothes, etc.\n\nIn-class Activities\n\nGo around your school and list goods and materials you find in the\n\nfollowing places.\n\nPrincipal's office :\n\nClassroom :\n\nLibrary :\n\nCafeteria :\n\nExercise\n\n1.
