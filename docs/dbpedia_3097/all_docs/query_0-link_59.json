        "text": "DAMAULI: Bhanu Municipality in Tanahun district has initiated a process to develop birthplace of Adikavi Bhanubhakta Acharya, Chundiramgha, as a literary tourist destination.\n\nA Sahitya Uddyanna, literary park, is being established at Bhanu Municipality-4.\n\nAcharya is a pioneering poet of Nepali language. Mayor Ananda Raj Tripathi informed that municipality had begun the works for developing tourism at Adikavi Acharya’s birthplace. Even the federal government had allocated Rs 50 million budget for it. The Finance Ministry released the budget some days back.\n\nTripathi further said, “President Ram Chandra Paudel took keen interest for development of this place. The works on construction of literary park have begun with his support.” The budget will be utilized to acquire land, prepare long-term plan and set up statues of eminent literary figures.\n\nThe undertaking begins first with land acquisition then long-term plan. “It is worrying to have birthplace of Adikavi Bhanubhakta in shadow. It needs attention and merits to be a tourist destination,” he shared.\n\nSimilarly, Deputy Mayor Uma Gotame viewed it would be easy to draw both domestic and foreign tourists once the literary park is established.\n\nA total of 83 ropanis of land would be acquired for the park.\n\nPark development committee Chairman Dr Jay Raj Acharya said the committee would provide necessary support and consultation for the construction of literary park."
