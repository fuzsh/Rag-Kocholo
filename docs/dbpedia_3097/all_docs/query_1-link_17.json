        "text": "KATHMANDU, July 13: The 211th birth anniversary of Bhanubhakta Acharya, the first poet of Nepali literature, is being celebrated today at various places in the country and abroad.\n\nBhanubhakta, renowned for translating the biography of King Rama of Ayodhya from Sanskrit to Nepali in his famous 'Ramayan,' is still remembered for his work, which is recited in Nepali households with a melodious rhythm. Nepal, which was geographically unified by Narayan Shah, was unified by Bhanu Bhakta through language, literature and culture.\n\nBorn on Asar 21, 1871 in Chundi Ramgha village of Tanahun, Bhanubhakta was inspired to compose Ramayana in Nepali, driven by a common proverb 'one should earn a name by doing good deeds after birth'.\n\nApart from the 'Ramayan,' his other famous works include 'Badhusikchya,' 'Prashnottar,' 'Bhaktamal,' 'Ram Geeta,' and various short creations.\n\nTwo litterateurs—Prof Dr Nobel Kishor Rai and Maya Thakuri—were honored on the occasion of 211th birth anniversary of Adikavi Bhanubhakta Acharya.\n\nAt a programme organized by Nepal Academy here today, Speaker Devraj Ghimire honoured them for their remarkable contribution to the Nepali literature. They were also taken around the city in a carriage before conferring the honor.\n\nEarlier, a statue of Adikavi Bhanubhakta, pioneering poet, in the premises of Nepal Academy was garlanded.\n\nA procession was organized from Nepal Academy where Nepal Police, APF Nepal, Nepali Army, Nepal Scout, students and literati had participated. The procession finally turned into an assembly after reaching the same place by going through Bagbazaar, Ratna Park, and Durbar High School.\n\nMeanwhile, a statue of Adikavi Bhanubhakta Acharya located at Durbar High School was also garlanded on the occasion of his 211th birth anniversary.\n\nAt a programme organized by Nepal Education Council here this morning, former vice-chancellor of Nepal Academy and senior litterateur Ganga Prasad Upreti shared Bhanubhakta's contribution to Nepali literature and society. He observed that pioneering poet Acharya's role was extraordinary and timeless.\n\nSimilarly, Council President Rama Sharma underlined that all Nepalis should remember Adikavi Bhanubhakta."
