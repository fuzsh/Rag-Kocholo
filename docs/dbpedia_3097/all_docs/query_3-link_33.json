        "text": "The 209th birth anniversary of Aadi Kavi Bhanubhakta Acharya, popularly known as Bhanu Jayanti, was joyously celebrated in the prep hall. The Nepali society impeccably organized the celebration, featuring various captivating performances. The event commenced with an enthralling recital of the Ramayan by the talented class 8 boys. Additionally, Mr. Saroj Gurung delivered a remarkable self-composed poem, while Mr. Y Sunam and Mr. K Thapa mesmerized the audience with their soulful songs. Furthermore, Rakshak Dahal presented a captivating biography on the life of Bhanubhakta.\n\nLater in the day, an Inter-house Nepali elocution contest was held, where the boys exhibited an exceptionally high standard of oratory skills. It gives us great pleasure to announce that Lawrence House emerged victorious in this fiercely competitive event.\n\nWe would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Mr. M Mukhia, the Head of the Nepali Department, and Mr. Y Suman, the senior Nepali master, for their outstanding efforts in organizing such a wonderful program. Their dedication and meticulous planning contributed immensely to the success of this grand celebration.\n\nPhotography Credit:- Mr N Bakshi"
