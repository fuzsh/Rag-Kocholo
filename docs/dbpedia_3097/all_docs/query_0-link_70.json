        "text": "“Bayle, O Terror Incarnate—thou hast betrayed mine Lord once again, hast thou not? Though thou hast received great terror from my Lord, thou standeth still. My Lord might have spared thee, but thou shalt not go unpunished. I, Igon the Drake Warrior vow that I shall be the one to take you down, foul dragon. Those who betray my Lord shall face death, at the hands of Igon, The Drake Warrior.” These were the words I uttered to myself before making my way up the Jagged Peak—the resting place of Bayle the Dreaded Dragon.\n\n“O Bayle, how fearful thou must be to cloak thyself within the summit of the Jagged Peak. Vile Bayle, how thou must rue challenging my Lord. Though thou art a mighty beast, ye cower in fear atop the Jagged Peak. Thou hast endured the terror of my Lord, thus thou art but a pitiful shell of thy former self. Tis the day thou shalt be felled by my harpoons. Mark my words, tis the day thou shalt be felled by the hands of Igon, the Drake Warrior.” O what a pain, such words I can never .utter once more.\n\n“Alas, the summit of the Jagged Peak. BAYLE! VILE BAYLE! COME TO ME, YOU FOUL DRAGON!” Oh, how much I regret uttering those words. Provoked by my words, Bayle made his presence known. The terrifying speed at which he came at me paralyzed my body for but a moment. As the fear of imminent death lurked within me, I dodged Bayle’s plunge on reflex alone.\n\n“O BAYLE! HOW YOU’VE CARVED FEAR INTO MY HEART. AHAHAHA!” Though I laughed, my heart was filled with such inexplicable terror. And yet, it was the moment I had felt most alive. The sheer terror behind Bayle’s rage engulfed Jagged Peak in fiery lightning.\n\n“O BAYLE! HOW ALIVE I FEEL!” Such foolish words I said. As I fired my harpoons at the dreaded dragon, I continued to evade his fire and anticipate his lightning. This started to wear me down, but Bayle too, was faltering. Even the Great Dreaded Dragon Bayle felt his strength weakening under my assault.\n\nOur battle lasted days, and finally, I was able to injure the Dreaded Dragon—his wings were weakened and he was no longer able to fly. “O BAYLE! HOW YOU’VE FALLEN! HEH HEH..\n\nAHHAHAHA!” Though the dragon could not fly, it still had its terrifying jaws. As I boasted about taking his wings, he grabbed me from my waist and hurled me from the peak. And now, I lie here, broken, and unable to walk. If I’d been more cautious of the beast’s jaws, perhaps victory could have been mine.\n\nO the pain, the pain. How much longer can I endure? “BAYLE! FOUL BAYLE! YE SHALL PAY DEARLY!”\n\nStanding before the Jagged Peak, with legs that are no more, I feel….Pitiful. Such tragedy, I never expected. “the pain…….. the excruciating pain. Just how much more can I take? MY ARMS AND LEGS AAAAAAAAAAAAGH”, “BAYLE! VILE BAYLE! MARK MY WORDS YE SHALL KNOW FEAR!” Oh, somebody's nearby. It's such a shame that they’ll see me in this pitiful state. A tarnished it seemeth. “O Tarnished thou art, not? How sorry I feel for thee—to see the great Igon, in such a shameful state.” The tarnished looked up at the Jagged Peak, I sensed that the tarnished hadn’t a clue about the dangers of the Peak, yet it seemed like he had no intentions of backing down. “The Jagged Peak. Thou art taking in the great view it seemeth. Be wary, the Peak lies home for the Terror Incarnate, The Vile Dreaded Dragon–BAYLE!”\n\nThe Tarnished Warrior seemed like no other, he was not of these lands and soared the peak with no intention of backing down. Seeing such determination, I was immediately taken aback by my youth days. “Ah, how can I back down from fighting Bayle when the dreaded dragon brought such shame to me.”\n\n“O TARNISHED WARRIOR, THOU HAVE KINDLED THE FLAME WHICH WAS LEFT EXTINGUISHED BY THE DREADED BAYLE! I SHALL NOT FORGET THEE!” As those words left my tongue, I began to gather up every ounce of my being and scale the Jagged Peak. “O the pain, you are nothing but a hurdle in my path to Bayle.”\n\nEvery step I took, I was reminded of my shameful fight against Bayle. “BAYLE! FOUL BAYLE! LEST YE HIDE FROM ME, YE SHALL KNOW FEAR!” The pain was unbearable, yet the Tarnished whom I kept seeing in the distance, kindled my fading flame and gave me the determination to scale the Peak.\n\nAs the climb grew more and more difficult, I found myself in an underpass beside a battle between two Jagged Drakes. As I looked up, there he was—The Tarnished Warrior standing proud, with their sword in hand. Such a sight, never before seen.\n\nThe Tarnished Warrior slayed both the mighty drakes. Witnessing such a spectacle, I couldn’t help but exclaim, “OHAHAHA! O TARNISHED HOW MIGHTY ART THOU? SUCH A SIGHT. I, IGON THE DRAKE WARRIOR CROWN YOU, AS A MIGHTY DRAKE WARRIOR! AHAHAHAH!”, “IF FATE DEEMS IT, WE SHALL MEET ONCE MORE. AT THE SUMMIT OF THE JAGGED PEAK.”\n\nGathering every ounce of my pride, I asked of him, “Tarnished Warrior, I ask of thee to take me with you to the summit.” Such a request it was, yet the Warrior accepted. He and I scaled the mountain together and even faced the Mighty Ancient Dragon Senessax. O, how easily the Tarnished Warrior slayed the beast, but I knew…..that Bayle was like no other.\n\nAs the sky grew darker, and the Fiery Lightning of Bayle started being apparent, the two of us felt the looming presence of Bayle the Dread. The long path we had left to scale, turned into mere steps and finally, there we were… outside the Gate of the Summit, where I had fought the Dreaded Dragon.\n\nThe Tarnished Warrior knew that Bayle was beyond the Gate. I gathered my Harpoons and my Great Warbow and began to aim at the sky. The Tarnished Warrior and I headed in and waited, but nothing. Such an irritating sight, I exclaimed, “CURSE YOU BAAAAAYYYYYYYYLE! I HEREBY VOW THAT YOU WILL RUE THIS DAY!” As I said this, the entire summit started to quake. The quaking made it clear that Bayle had heard me and was approaching.\n\nI looked at the sky and there he was. It was a terrifying sight, but both the Tarnished warrior and I managed to escape. Bayle looked at me, but he knew the true threat was the man beside me. The dreaded dragon took no notice of my harpoons, instead, he looked at the Tarnished Warrior and launched a flurry of flame and lightning at him. The Tarnished Warrior endured the terrifyingly powerful attacks of the Dreaded Bayle—Such strong determination I’d never seen. It fueled my ambitions, so I began firing my harpoons at Bayle.\n\n“BEHOLD BAYLE! A TRUE DRAKE WARRIOR AND I, IGON. YOUR FEARS MADE FLESH! SOLID OF SCALE YOU MIGHT BE FOUL DRAGON, BUT I WILL RIDDLE YOUR HOLES WITH A HAIL OF HARPOONS!”\n\nSuddenly, the Tarnished Warrior staggered the dreaded beast for but a moment–that was our only chance to win, so we took it. I rained my harpoons upon him, while the Tarnished Warrior attacked the Bayle’s Head. Suddenly, Bayle began to get up. The Dreaded Dragon roared in such pain that it released powerful fiery lightning bolts all around the summit.\n\nIt took all our might to knock down the dreaded beast, and we weren’t letting it be for nothing. The Tarnished Warrior leaped onto the Dragon’s Head and stabbed it. Bayle, the dreaded dragon roared with all its might, but that was the beast’s mistake. I aimed at his heart and rained down my harpoons. It took very many harpoons, but it was clear that I managed to pierce his flesh. This made it clear that I had indeed, hit his heart. The foul beast fell, and we were completely exhausted. When it all seemed like Sunshines and Rainbows, Bayle started to get up. The Dreaded Dragon roared once again. We glanced at one another and knew our time of death had arrived. And yet….. it hadn’t. Bayle… had collapsed. And we… had won.\n\n“AHAHAHAHA! BAYLE! YOU SHALL HAUNT ME, NO LONGER!” I exclaimed, knowing that I had fulfilled my duty. The honor of my Lord, Placidusax was restored once more. I looked at the Tarnished Warrior, “You have my deepest gratitude, Tarnished Warrior. Ye shall be written in songs and in stories for people to hear. Thank you, Tarnished Warrior.” He smiled at me, took Bayle’s Heart, and descended the Summit. I looked at the sky, lying down, and thought about my journey. I closed my eyes and opened them. “Ah, a faint light. Tis the time, it seemeth.” And that was it…..\n\nI am originally from Dang district. It is situated in the Terai region. I have spent the majority of my life living in Dang and it has just been a year since I’ve started living in Kathmandu and studying here at Deerwalk Sifal School. I studied in two different parts of Nepal and I have found a lot of differences in the education system of these two places.\n\nThe main difference is the method of teaching. In Ghorahi, Dang students are taught in traditional ways. What I mean from it is that as a student I never felt excited going to school except for talking to friends whereas in Kathmandu children feel excited going to school as they do not have to study all the time. The students have ECA, extra subjects like Sanskrit, Sports, Music and many activities to take part in, which are completely missing from the education system in Dang. We used to focus only on study in the school in Dang and there were some activities like sports but once in a blue moon. Personally I think that academically (in terms of getting good grades and knowledge about the subject we need to study) Dang is significantly better. We studied a lot and did a lot of homework which made us academically strong which might sound good at first but like me majority of the students were really shy and did not have any communication skills as we never took part in debates and speech competitions. I grew up in that environment where I never took part in any activities. So after coming from Dang I was really shy and nervous studying over here. One of the main reasons for joining Deerwalk Sifal school is that it makes us take part in activities such as debates, ECA , writing, reading and many more.\n\nAnother big difference that I found in two schools is how the students speak English. In my whole schooling life of 13 years from Nursery to 10 I never spoke a single sentence in English with my friends. So, I still feel that my English speaking skill is really weak. As I have an interest in listening to English music and watching English movies and reading and writing English poems, my English writing is not that bad but I feel insecure speaking in front of people in English due to my weak English speaking. I can't simply blame the education system of Dang because the place where I studied in, was one of the best schools of that place in accordance with the marks the students get. The fees in Dang are like 10% of the fees of schools in Kathmandu. So, expecting the same amount of facilities is a stupid thing but I still feel the school should have forced us to take part in some speaking competitions. After coming to Kathmandu I’ve known the importance of speaking skills.\n\nEven though I have shown the bad sides of the education system of Dang, the schools there have a lot of great things. According to my experience, I feel the education system of Dang has pushed me more than my limit academically as I was able to top for some years. From the education system of Kathmandu I’m finally able to push my boundaries in speaking, writing and reading aspects which will help me a lot in my future life and now I am not that shy kid anymore.\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) is a developmental disorder where the symptoms occur at the age of three. Most children having autism look normal like other kids but the way they act and interact differs from the other children. When they interact with others, they may respond in an unusual way or not respond at all.\n\nAccording to Autism Research Institute (2023) :\n\nFor many years diagnosis of autism was rare. It occurred in just 1 child out of 2000 children. However, since the mid 1980s, the rate of autistic children has increased to a large extent. In March 2020, the US Federal Centers for Disease Control announced that autism has affected 1 child out of 54 children. It is more likely to affect boys than girls. (para. 5)\n\nAutistic children require almost constant attention to meet their daily needs. There are numerous conditions occurring alongside autism. These include depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is not uncommon to have autism in younger siblings when an older child has been diagnosed by it as well. One individual facing autism may have much difficulty in communicating with other people. Avoidance of eye contact is also a common symptom of it. They perform the same behavior again and again such as eating the same food at every meal and watching the same videos repeatedly. They hurt themselves physically in every way possible such as biting their hands, banging their head against the wall or ground or excessively rubbing their skin.\n\nThere are many ways to treat these behaviors. The first step should be to take a child with symptoms to see a doctor. There has been a clear focus on the ways or means of identifying autism early and focus on those risks of a diagnosis. Speech therapies are suggested to those who have difficulties using appropriate tone of voice, using body language and asking and answering the questions. The child may be over reactive, under reactive or crave sensory sensations as well. It is very important to work with healthcare professionals and support the treatments. Parents must give attention to their child and try to understand them better.\n\nAutism can show up differently in boys and girls. Some girls with autism might try to act more like other kids. They might hide the symptoms of autism like the way they behave or how they feel. They try to be normal which makes it harder for doctors to see the signs of autism and diagnose it correctly. So, even though there might be just as many girls with autism as boys, they might get missed because they're good at hiding it. Also children facing autism might start changing from childhood to adulthood. The increasing number of autism in adulthood is a reminder that it might also be a lifelong condition for some people.\n\nAutism presents many conditions characterized by a wide range of experiences. People diagnosed with ASD exhibit challenges in social interaction and communication. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the unique perspectives within autistic community. We can empower people with ASD by fostering a favorable environment for them to cope up with and flourish in the society they are living.\n\nReference\n\nfirespringInt. (2023, September 11).

Within these galaxies, there lie supermassive black holes that reside at their cores, and in certain cases, these black holes turn into Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). AGN are characterized by their various consumption of matter. There exists a specific type of AGN known as quasars, which are intensely bright cores located in the distant parts of the universe. Quasars are highlighted as extreme examples of AGN. They are incredibly luminous. They are beacons that offer a different perspective into the early stages of the universe, which provide valuable insights into the processes that have influenced its creation and evolution over time.\n\nQuasars, also known as quasi-stellar radio sources, are very significant in the context of active galactic nuclei. Quasars are described as sources of intense brilliance that originate from the central supermassive black hole in active galaxies. The process involves the black hole consuming large amounts of matter, leading to the formation of a swirling accretion disk. This disk becomes a battleground for massive clouds of material, experiencing strong gravitational forces that result in collisions and rapid orbital movements.\n\nWhen things collide and move fast in the disk around the black hole in a quasar, it gets very hot. This heat makes the disk shine much brighter than entire galaxies. The gas clouds in the disk zoom around really fast, from 10% to over 80% of the speed of light. Studying quasars gives astronomers a special chance to learn about the early universe. Quasars are like faraway lights that have traveled a very long way, showing us a bit of the important cosmic events that happened in the ancient times of our universe.\n\nThe Galactic Center:\n\nQuasars become bright lights when a bunch of gas gathers around a giant black hole in the middle of a galaxy. This can happen early in the universe when streams of material flow into the galaxy through cosmic pathways called filaments. Later on, quasars might also light up when galaxies crash into each other or come very close, making strong gravitational forces. As the gas falls into the black hole, it releases a significant amount of energy. This process makes the quasar shine incredibly bright.\n\nFormation of Quasars (Supermassive Blackholes):\n\nWhen a large amount of gas gathers around a Black Hole, Quasars are formed. This can happen early in the universe when streams of stuff flow into the galaxy through pathways called filaments. Sometimes, quasars light up later when galaxies bump into each other or get very close, creating strong gravitational forces. When the gas falls into the black hole, it lets out a ton of energy, making the quasar shine really bright. One can picturize galaxies as busy cities in space; when they collide or get close, it's like a spark that turns on quasars. Scientists study these events to understand how the universe changes over a really long time, and quasars help tell the incredible story of the cosmos.\n\nQuasars are super bright lights in space. They form when a lot of gas gathers around a big black hole in the middle of a galaxy. This can happen in the early times of the universe when streams of material flow into the galaxy through cosmic pathways called filaments. Quasars can turn on later when galaxies crash into each other or come really close, making powerful gravitational forces. When the gas falls into the black hole, it lets out a lot of energy, making the quasar shine super bright.\n\nThink of galaxies like big cities in space. Sometimes, these cities crash into each other or get close, and that's when quasars turn on. It's like a big spark when things collide. Studying these events helps scientists understand how the universe changes over a really long time. So, quasars act like cosmic flashlights, showing us the incredible story of the universe.\n\nFeedback From Quasars:\n\nThere's a fascinating thing called \"feedback.\" This happens when quasars give off strong radiation, creating powerful outflows of ionized gas, like space winds. These outflows affect their home galaxies in both helpful and troublesome ways. They can start huge starbursts by pushing gas clouds together, but on the flip side, they might stop star-making by kicking out or heating up interstellar gas. This cosmic dance can have long-lasting effects, sometimes hitting pause on a galaxy's star-making time for different lengths. It shows how quasars and their galaxies have a detailed and powerful connection.\n\nFeedback exposes the way quasars influence their galactic homes This dance begins at the moment quasars emit incredibly strong radiation causing significant cosmic events in their home galaxies. One key part of this feedback is the formation of powerful outflows, in which ionized gas flies away from the quasar, sort of like the solar wind only much bigger. The flows of these outflows, reddening and heating the gases while driving the grains as they go through the galaxy, affect in both good and bad ways on how stars form. They can induce enormous starbursts by compressing gas clouds, nevertheless, they can also prevent star-generation by expelling or heating interstellar gas. The consequences of quasar feedback go beyond a very localized one, sometimes putting off star formation by different measures. It displays the way those celestial encounters have consequential implications.\n\nTherefore, the connection between quasars and their galaxies, seen in the feedback process, reveals powerful forces shaping the cosmos. The impact of quasar-driven outflows demonstrates a balance, influencing both the start and stop of star formation in galaxies. In this continuous interaction, the lasting effects of quasar feedback play a crucial role in deciding the fate of galaxies, sometimes causing a temporary pause in their star-forming activity. This ongoing partnership between galaxies and quasars highlights the ever changing and influential dynamics of these interactions across the vast expanse of the universe.\n\nSpectrum of AGN:\n\nAGN spin a vast spectrum, emitting diverse energy levels. Positioned near the extreme high end of this spectrum, quasars stand out, yet they represent just one facet of AGN diversity. The brilliance of quasars results from their near face-on orientation to us. When viewed precisely head-on, they transform into blazars, where the relativistic jet appears brighter and seemingly 'blazing.' Some more interesting among blazars are \"BL Lac\" objects, displaying dramatic brightness variations and a spectrum lacking distinct spectral lines.\n\nSeyfert galaxies, another AGN category, possess an accretion disk but lack a prominent jet, exhibiting weaker activity than quasars. Seyferts are divided into Type I and Type II, representing the same object viewed from different angles. Type I Seyferts, seen face-on, display two strong sets of spectral lines, broad and narrow, whereas Type II Seyferts, observed edge-on, lack pronounced broad emission lines due to a thick torus of dust blocking some emissions.\n\nIn contrast to quasars and blazars, Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions (LINERs) showcase weak AGN activity, with some potentially lacking an accretion disk. Furthermore, all AGN fall into two categories: radio-loud and radio-quiet galaxies regardless of their specific type. For instance, some quasars like 3C 273 emit lots of radio waves, while others remain radio-quiet.\n\nThus, the comprehensive understanding of AGN reveals a rich tapestry of celestial phenomena, each contributing uniquely to our comprehension of the dynamic forces at play within galaxies.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, Quasars act as the brightest lighthouses across the cosmos, thus making it the only way to observe the early universe. They are born from the energetic activity from around the supermassive black holes during the process of merging of galaxies; hence exposing the intricate interplay between such massive cosmic structures. Quasars among other sources like blazars and Seyfert galaxies contribute to the our study of AGN diversity.\n\nThe feedback mechanism, where quasars emit a potent energy, is very essential in the exertion of galaxies. Energetic starburst feedback drives galaxy star formation, illustrating a dynamic evolutionary process.\n\nTitle of the movie: Gran Turismo\n\nRelease date: August 25, 2023\n\nDirected by: Neill Blomkamp\n\nGenre: Biographical Sports\n\nScreenplay: Jason Hall, Zach Baylin\n\nCast: Archie Madekwe as Jann Mardenborough, David Harbour as Jack Salter, Orlando Bloom as Danny Moore, Darren Barnet as Matty Davis, Geri Halliwell-Horner as Lesley Mardenborough, Djimon Hounsou as Steve Mardenborough, Takehiro Hira as Kazunori Yamauchi, Josha Stradowski as Nicholas Capa, Daniel Puig as Coby Mardenborough, Maeve Courtier-Lilley as Audrey, Thomas Kretschmann as Patrice Capa, Richard Cambridge as Felix, Emelia Hartford as Leah Vega, Pepe Barroso as Antonio Cruz, Sang Heon Lee as Joo-Hwan Lee, Max Mundt as Klaus Hoffman, Mariano González as Henry Evas, Harki Bhambra as Avi Bhatt, Lindsay Pattison as Chloe McCormick, Théo Christine as Marcel Durand, Niall McShea as Federik Schulin, Jamie Kenna as Jack Man Jones and Nikhil Parmar as Persol.\n\nSummary\n\nGran Turismo is a biographical sports film from 2023 by Neill Blomkamp, starring Archie Madekwe, Orlando Bloom, David Harbour, and Djimon Hounsou.The movie begins with a SIM racer's rise to become a professional racing driver and Jann Mardenborough achieved it all after winning the Nissan GT Academy competition in Britain. The movie is inspiring, thrilling, and action-packed. It goes on to show that nothing is impossible if we are motivated from inside.\n\nThe film takes viewers through the rise of the streets of East London to the top in racing. He went through poverty, discrimination, and the loss of a loved one. He, however, becomes fixed with his dream of becoming a racing driver. It is actually a well-made inspiring movie.\n\nThe direction by Blomkamp is sharp, and all the performances are brilliant. Madekwe acquits himself well as Mardenborough, capturing much of his determination and charisma. The movie's racing sequences are also awesomely shot and edited. Otherwise, the movie would not be perfect. It treads on a pretty predictable script, and the movie does take some of the overused terms of the sport genre. The movie further resides on Mardenborough's gaming abilities that might deviate the interest of some viewers who do not know about the Gran Turismo video game series. Among the things which I liked was the line by Jack, \"That crash won't define who you are but how you respond to it will.\" Our setbacks and failures do not have to determine who we are as people. It is our response to these challenges that molds our character and defines our resilience. It is us who determines whether we are victims or survivors. This then is what we should remember all the time, more so in times of confusion. It is, of course, easy sometimes to be shocked by setbacks but equally important is the fact that we are bigger than our failures. What choices we have is in how we respond to them and in coming out stronger on the other side. It depends on people what they show rather than what they actually are. Witnessing people makes others think they are something but actually the people can be their true self and pretend to be other self. People can change themselves and they get known for their response towards the change.\n\nAll in all, Gran Turismo is a beautiful and enjoyable movie. It's an inspiring and well-told story with some really excellent racing sequences and the edits. However, the movie's predictability and cliches might turn some people off."
