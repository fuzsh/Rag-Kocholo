        "text": "The 209th birth anniversary of the great poet of Nepali literature Bhanubhakta Acharya is being celebrated today by organizing various programs in different places of the country and abroad. By presenting the biography of King Ram of Ayodhya, written in simple Nepali language, 'Ramayana' with emotional translation, Bhanubhakta has done a great service to the Nepali people. The Ramayana written by him is still recited in Nepali homes with a melodious rhythm. Nepal, which was geographically unified by Prithvi Narayan Shah, was unified by Adikavi Bhanubhakta through language, literature, and culture.\n\nBhanubhakta, who was born in the village of Chundiramgha in Tanahu on 29 Asar 1871 BS (13 July 1814), was exhorted by a simple grasshopper to earn a name by doing good deeds after birth. He was inspired to compose Ramayana in Nepali. 'Vadhushiksha' is another famous work of Bhanubhakta. Similarly, there are works like 'Prashnottar', 'Bhaktamala', 'Ramgita', and other works. Adikavi Acharya, who was imprisoned for failing to reconcile the accounts of Kumari Chowk, wrote in his poem protesting against the delay in the government office and 'Bholibad' - 'Tomorrow is tomorrow, let's go Home Today'.\n\nGyanishtha Gyawali, a scholar of Bhanubhakta and an associate professor at Tribhuvan University, says that good governance and prosperity are possible only if today's rulers and administrators understand and put into practice the poem written against the futurism of Bhanubhakta. Bhanubhakta has made a historic contribution in awakening Nepali ethnic unity, national identity, and Nepali cultural consciousness and strengthening the national culture. As Bhanubhakta is a historical person, all Nepalis should respect him and critics are of the opinion that the main need today is to hold a discussion and review program on the controversy over his views. Many post-graduate dissertations have been written on Bhanubhakta from Tribhuvan University.\n\nOn this occasion, a wreath-laying ceremony will be held at the statue of national icon Bhanubhakta in front of Ranipokhari in Kathmandu this morning. Similarly, Abhinav Sahitya Samaj is going to organize a book release program in Jorpati today on the occasion of Bhanu Jayanti.\n\nIt is said that the program will be conducted only by organizing physical distance as the transmission of coronavirus may spread this year. Those who are unable to attend the public event celebrate Bhanu Jayanti by reciting the Ramayana translated into Nepali from house to house. Scholar Gyawali says that it is justifiable to call Bhanubhakta an Adikavi as he has made an important contribution to linguistic unity by translating texts like Ramayana into Nepali folklore. The Ramayana has created a new era in the linguistic field. He died in Ashoj 1925 BS. Bhanubhakta's birth anniversary is also celebrated in Darjeeling, Sikkim, and many other Nepali-speaking places in India."
