        "text": "BHANU JAYANTI 2023: Every year, people of Nepal, Sikkim, Darjeeling, and other countries with a Nepali-speaking population, such as Myanmar, Bhutan, and others, commemorate Bhanu Jayanti. Community around the world celebrates this momentous day with great pomp and zeal. The occasion marks the birth anniversary of the great poet Bhanubhakta Acharya. Typically, it is observed on July 13 annually, which is also the 29th day of the Nepali month of Ashadh.\n\nWhy is July 13 a bank holiday in Sikkim?\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya was a Nepalese poet, and he retains a unique place in the lives of the Sikkimese people, in part because it is a primary language in the Sikkim-Darjeeling region.\n\nThe poet has been given the title ‘Adhikavi’ or ‘First Poet’ in Sikkim. Bhanubhakta is credited with translating the Ramayana into basic Nepalese, and his birthday is commemorated with poetry recitation competitions and literary conferences. The pioneering poet’s birth anniversary used to be celebrated for a week with a meeting of Nepali literature enthusiasts from around the world. Therefore, banks and most public organizations in Sikkim are closed on this day in honour of the poet.\n\nBhanu Jayanti 2023: History\n\nIn 1871, Bhanubhakta was born into an affluent Brahmin family in Chundiramgha, Tanahu, Nepal. His grandfather, Shri Krishna Acharya, was a well-known figure in his day. His grandfather provided him with a good education with a strong religious bent.\n\nWhen Bhanubhakta was 22 years old, he was reportedly so impressed by an incident involving a grass cutter that he decided to become a poet. One day, he met a grass cutter, and during their talk, he discovered that the grass cutter wished to contribute to society so that he, too, would be remembered after death.\n\nAfter hearing the response, Bhanubhakta felt ashamed of himself. It not only stimulated Bhanubhakta’s literary genius but it also encouraged him to do something noble.\n\nBhanu Jayanti Significance and How to Celebrate?\n\nPreviously, Nepali was only available in oral form. Bhanubhakta Acharya is regarded as the first poet to write in Nepali and a champion of the language in the world. Therefore, it is regarded highly by the community and literary folk.\n\nOn this day, authors, poets, and fans of Nepali literature come together to remember the magnificent works of Adikavi Bhanubhakta Acharya. The Nepali community gathers in auditoriums and halls around towns and cities to celebrate with a garland ceremony. People take a pledge to advance the language, enrich it with new forms of written, oral, and visual arts, and continue to preserve their culture and language."
