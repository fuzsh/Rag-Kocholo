        "text": "The Jayanti is celebrated by the people of Nepal, Darjeeling, Sikkim and various countries like Myanmar, and Bhutan. Bhanu Jayanti is annually held on the 29th day of the Nepali month of Ashadh.\n\nThe significance of the day is that it is a celebration of the Nepali culture including its literature and rituals. The Nepali poet was born on July 13, 1813 and later moved to Varanasi. He is known for translating epics like Ramayana into the Nepali language.\n\nOn this day, the Nepali people vow to preserve their culture and language and enrich it. The writer fraternity and its admirers remember the great works of Bhanubhakta Acharya.\n\nNepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba extended his best wishes on the occasion.\n\n“Bhanubhakta is a hero who has unified all through linguistics. His creations has unified all from Mechi to Mahakali,” Deuba said in a program today.\n\nSikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang unveiled a new statue of Bhanu Bhakta Acharya on Tuesday.\n\n“Honoured to unveil the new life-size statue of Aadikavi Bhanu Bhakta Acharya at the newly renovated Bhanu Udhyan Singtam. Aadikavi Bhanu Bhakta Acharya was an eminent scholar who contributed immensely towards Nepali literature. His literary works had a tremendous impact at the socio-cultural level and his love, dedication for the language earned him the title of Aadikavi,” the Chief Minister tweeted.\n\nPaying tributes to the Nepali poet, Darjeeling Police tweeted, “Tribute to Aadikabi Bhanubhakta Acharya, who translated the great epic Ramayana and Mahabharata from Sanskrit to Nepali. Remembering the great soul for his contributions to Nepali literature. Greetings on the auspicious occasion of Bhanu Jayanti!”\n\nThe Ministry of DoNER also extended greetings on the occasion and said, “Warm greetings to the people of #Sikkim on the esteem occasion of Bhanu Jayanti Bhanubhakta Acharya was the first writer to transcribe the entire Ramayana from Sanskrit to the Nepali language.”\n\nUnion Minister Rameswar Teli extended wishes on the occasion, “Bhanubhakta Acharya was a Nepali poet, translator and writer. He was the first writer to translate the great epic Ramayana from Sanskrit to Nepali. He is also honoured with the title of Aadikavi. Warm wishes on the auspicious occasion of Bhanu Jayanti!”\n\nBJP leader Suvendu Adhikari also tweeted, “Immortalized with the title of Aadikavi; Bhanubhakta Acharya would be always revered for being the first to document literary works in the Nepalese language and translating the great epic Ramayana from Sanskrit to Nepali. My wishes on the auspicious occasion of Bhanu Jayanti.”\n\nBhanu Bhakta Acharya wrote Ramayana in poetry form in Nepali. Probably, this was the first-ever translation of any Sanskrit literature into the Nepali language.\n\nHe has also translated many other Sanskrit literary texts into Nepali.\n\nAmong his literary works are ‘Kantipuri Nagari’, ‘Ek Man Chitta Lagai Chakari Garya’, ‘Khwamit Yas Giridhaari Le’, ‘Baalaaji Dekhyan’, ‘Ma Bhanubhakta’, ‘Roj Roj Darshan Paunchhu’, ‘Prashnottar Mala’, ‘Bhakta Maala’, ‘Ram Gita’.\n\nBhanu Bhakta Acharya was honoured with the title ‘Aadikavi’ or first poet of Nepal because he was the first to write poems in the common Nepali language. After him, other writers also started writing literature in the Nepali language. .\n\nMotiram Bhatta first referred to him as ‘Aadi Kavi’ of Nepal while writing Bhanu Bhakta Acharya’s biography in 1981. Bhatta is also the poet who published all of Acharya’s manuscripts and works of literature.\n\nBhanu Bhakta was also named as one of the rashtriya bibhutis or national heroes of Nepal. (ANI)"
