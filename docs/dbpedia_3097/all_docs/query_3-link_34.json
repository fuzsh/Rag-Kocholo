        "text": "Bhanubhakta Acharyako Ramayan – Bhanubhakta Acharya | Poetry is lost in translation. However, I have made an attempt to translate the Ramayana of Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814-1968), the pioneer poet of Nepal. While translating it, I felt that it was impossible to translate the beauty of Bhanubhakta’s language. His translation of the Adhyatma Ramayana into Nepali is not a literal one; it is a trans-creation.\n\nWeight 0.5 kg Authors\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya\n\nLanguage\n\nNepali\n\nPublisher\n\nMakalu Prakashan\n\nOnly logged in customers who have purchased this product may leave a review."
