        "text": "KATHMANDU, July 14: The 210th birth anniversary of the Adikavi (first poet) of Nepali literature, the late Bhanubhakta Acharya, is being celebrated today by organizing various programs at various places in the country and abroad.\n\nBhanubhakta presented the emotional 'Ramayana', the biography of King Rama of Ayodhya, in simple Nepali language which greatly contributed to Nepali literature and benefited the Nepali people. The Ramayana written by him is still recited rhythmically in Nepalese homes.\n\nNepal, which was geographically unified by Prithvi Narayan Shah, was unified by Adikavi Bhanu Bhakta through language, literature and culture.\n\nBhanubhakta has a historical contribution to awakening Nepali ethnic unity, national identity and Nepali cultural awareness and strengthening national culture. Critics are of the opinion that all Nepalese should respect Bhanubhakta as he is a historical person, and it is the main need of today to discuss and review the controversies about his views.\n\nMany research papers have been written on Bhanubhakta from Tribhuvan University. It has been informed that there is a program of morning procession and garlanding at the statue of the National Icon Bhanubhakta in front of Ranipokhari in Kathmandu this morning."
