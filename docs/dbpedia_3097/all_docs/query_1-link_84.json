Always allow me to embrace the truth, do not keep me in the darkness of ignorance, always give me the light of knowledge and consciousness, show me the way towards it, and give me such knowledge that I can remain immortal in the light of knowledge beyond the fear of this materialistic illusionary cycle of life and death.\"\n\nMay the day of Guru Poornima lighten every dismal night. May there be peace in this world, may there be embryonic peace, may there be primordial peace, and may there be spiritual peace.\n\nThe meaning of the above mantra, which is appreciated by the Upanishads, illustrates the enlightenment of knowledge and its importance. The knowledge imparted by the Guru and its connection with human life has remained very deep.\n\nNo matter what religion or denomination we belong to, Guru and gravity are of great importance for acquiring knowledge and skills, and in the world, knowledge is probably the only thing that grows as it is shared.\n\nBackground of Guru Poornima\n\nOn Ashadh Shukla Purni, i.e. Guru Purni, it is celebrated by showing reverence to the Guru who imparts education to oneself. On this day, knowledge is worshiped as a guru. This day is celebrated all over the planet on Gurupurni, showing respect and reverence for the Guru.\n\nAdherents of Sanatan Dharma and Buddhism consider this day as a special day to express their gratitude to the Guru who showed them the way to their religion and traditional cultural knowledge.\n\nFrom the darkness of ignorance and unconsciousness to the light of knowledge and consciousness, all the gurus who show the right path are worshiped today.\n\n\"गुरु ब्रह्मा, गुरु विष्णु गुरु देवो महेश्वर,\n\nगुरु साक्षात् परमं ब्रह्मा तस्मै श्री गुरुवे नम:\"\n\n\"The Guru is Brahma, the Guru is Vishnu and the Guru is Lord Shankara. The Guru is the real Parabrahm, I greet such a Guru. \"\n\n“Only a True Guru, who knows God and is in oneness with God, can connect you to God.”\n\nLife teaches us something at every turn, so being able to memorize every lesson will be the right use of Guru Purnima.\n\nLet's bow down and remember all the teachers, including Sir, Miss, Dai, and Didi. You can be both a good teacher and a good disciple. Happy Guru Purnima!\n\nVyasa Jayanti\n\nNow I add another relevance and dedicate my words to a great scholar \"Guru Vyasa\", the one who compiled and crafted Mahabharata in his words. Guru Vyasa is traditionally credited for the compilation and creation of didactic poetry around the central heroic narrative of Mahabharata.\n\nGuru Vyasa\n\nNot just a writer, Vyasa is also remembered as a significant character of Mahabharata. Let me elaborate more on Vyasa's existence on Mahabharata, technically Vyasa and Bhisma are stepbrothers. The mother of Vyasa, Satyavati later married King Shantanu, Shantanu is the father of Bhisma. Shantanu promised to declare Satyabati's offspring as a crown prince but Shantanu had already declared Bhisma as a prince and heir to the throne. Knowing this, Bhisma later never made any claim to the throne in his pursuit of getting his father out of the distress. Tragically, both the sons of Satyavati died. Satyavati's premarital first-born, Vyasa, laments that his mother abandoned him to fate immediately after birth. He returns to his birthplace in search of his mother who, he finds out, is now the queen of Hastinapur.\n\nVyasa is also known as a transcriber of Vedas and Puranas. Guru Vyasa is one of the eight Chiranjeevi (long-lived and immortals), these Chiranjeevi are still in existence. Guru Vyasa was born at the end of Treta Yuga and he witnessed the whole era of Dwapar Yuga. Vyasa's writings often bring the Yamuna river nostalgia and metaphors, he was born in a village at the bank of the river Yamuna.\n\nGuru Purnima is also known as Vyasa Purnima, the day when great scholar Vyasa was born and the day when he divided the Vedas.\n\nVyasa is the greatest sage of eastern philosophy and Sanatan living, he edited four Vedas, wrote 18 Puranas, the epics Mahabharata and the Srimad Vagwatam, and even guided Dattatreya to gain knowledge, Vyasa is a guru of gurus.\n\nBhanu Jayanti\n\nBhanujayanti: A tribute to Bhanubhakta from Nepal\n\n\"Background of Bhanu jayanti\"\n\nOn the day of Asar 29th, every year Bhanu Jayanti is celebrated. Bhanubhakta Acharya was born in 1871 BS in a place called Chundi Ramgha in present-day Tanahu district to a wealthy family. He lived for 54 years.\n\nBhanu Bhakta and the rise and fall of Khas language\n\nAs a Brahmin family was born, the education and upbringing of Bhanubhakta was done accordingly in religious and cultural disciplines. The present-day Nepali language was then called \"Khas\" language and this language was limited to general expressions rather than written ones. With the defeat of the \"Khas\" kings in the 15th century, the \"Khas\" language was also gradually ignored. He was the first Nepali language poet to express the essence of emotion inside the alphabetic map of Nepali language and words. That is why Bhanubhakta is called Adikavi. Bhanubhakta has immortalized his name because of his good deeds and outstanding contribution to Nepali language. His father Dhananjaya Acharya was a government official, who worked for General Amar Singh Thapa. Later Bhanubhakta, the son of Dhanjaya Acharya became the first poet of Nepal to write in Nepali language.\n\nBhanubhakta then transcribed the entire Ramayana from Sanskrit into simple Nepali. Surprisingly, even though it was translated, the Ramayana of the Nepali version is divinely a combination of verse and emotion. To put it more broadly, Bhanubhakta can be said to have expanded the easy access of all Nepali by simplifying study and knowledge through language.\n\nInspiration of the grass cutter/ Ghasi\n\nBhanubhakta has learned from his society and environment, so his work is a confluence of society and practicality. In the life of a Bhanubhakta, a grass cutter has inspired him, simple grass cutter magnificently inspired Bhanubhakta and thus Bhanubhakta started to his pursuit of words and meanings. Even though the grass cutter is poor, the money earned by cutting the grass digs a well for drinking water for the society.\n\nEven though Bhanubhakta is richer than Ghansi (Grasscutter), he feels remorse for not doing anything for the society. Assimilating the fact of contributing to society, Bhanubhakta starts to contribute in his way, through words, meanings, poetry, and Nepali simplification of complex Sanskrit creations. The stories and sub-stories of Balakanda, Aranyakanda, Sunderkanda, Yuddhakanda, etc. in the Ramayana have provided entertainment, social, moral, and character education to the Nepali readers.\n\nAlthough Bhanubhakta created many other works besides \"Ramayana\", he has largely survived in the Nepali simple version of Ramayana. Listening to the Ramayana recited by the villagers together is more enjoyable than watching the current 3D or 4D movies. In this sense, Bhanubhakta's simple Ramayana is the starting point of today's Dohori and folk songs for Nepali society. Bhanubhakta introduced the excitement of rhythm and its usage in songs, dialect and lifestyles, Dohori is an example of this. Dohori is a typical dialogue based on certain context of rural life, love or issues where a male and female singer expresses their verdicts but in a rhythmic poetry form.\n\nHere is the Ghansi poem, Bhanubhakta dedicated to his inspiration \"Grass cutter\"\n\nभर् जन्म घाँस तिर मन् दिई धन कमायो\n\nनाम क्यै रहोस् पछि भनेर कुवा खनायो\n\nघाँसी दरिद्र घरको तर बुद्धि कस्तो\n\nम भानुभक्त धनी भैकन किन यस्तो\n\nमेरा ईनार न त सत्तल पाटिकै छन्\n\nजे धन चीजहरु छन् घर भित्रनै छन्\n\nत्यस घाँसीले कसरी आज दिए छ अर्ति\n\nधिक्कार हो म कन बस्नु न राखि किर्ति\n\nAccording to the context of the above words written by Bhanubhakta, he encountered a grass cutter who was saving a little bit of the money he made by selling the grass. This grass cutter wanted to build a drinking water well for the service of the public. When Bhanu heard the poor person’s determination, he realized that he hasn’t done anything for the public despite having a lot of wealth. Thus, he started writing Ramayan in Nepali from Sanskrit.\n\nBhanubhakta's rhythm is completely different, that rhythm is still in Nepali vernacular. Many other poets after him have used this rhythm to recite their poems even today.\n\nIn the memory of Bhanubaje i.e. Bhanubhakta, Bhanu Jayanti is celebrated in Nepal, Darjeeling, and other regions of India and all over the world with Nepali speaking society, be it Myanmar, Nepal, India, Bhutan or anywhere.\n\nBhanubhakta is not only a poet but also a master of Nepali language and the rhythm of Bhanubhakta is still alive in every Nepali tongue. Many things were written against and with baseless criticisms of Bhanubhakta's contribution. There were also naked arguments that confines Bhanubhakta just as a translator, but those things are unfair to him. Translating verses and expressions, maintaining and even enhancing them, being able to be used by the masses for centuries and giving realistic proverbs, sayings, and rhyming expressions and being able to institutionalize all aspects of the Nepali language is the full definition and identity of Adikavi Bhanubhakta. Adi means immortal and Kavi is poet, Bhanubhakta shall always remain in the Nepali language.\n\nBhanu Bhakta and Motiram Bhatta\n\nYugakavi Moti Ram has published many other works of Bhanubhakta, while some even accuse him of writing most of the works of Bhanubhakta.\n\nAlthough Motiram, who studied in India, had a special interest in Urdu, Persian, and other languages, his dedication to the Nepali language and especially to the works of Bhanubhakta, proclaimed the wide scope and Nepaliness of the Nepali language. Motiram Bhatt is a name not to be missed on Bhanu Jayanti. After Moti Ram's long biography of Bhanubhakta, published in 1941 BS, Bhanubhakta's multi-faceted works have come to the notice of the masses. Even in the Indian Encyclopedia, Bhanubhakta is openly explained.\n\nThe present generation needs to learn language from Bhanubhakta. In the memory of the great man who united the scattered languages, the great poets of Nepal, it is celebrated all over the world today. It is important to understand that Bhanubhakta is not an option but Bhanubhakta is the basis of our love and belongingness to the Nepali language.\n\nThe study, research, and development of the Nepali language will be the true homage to Adikavi.\n\nNew Nepali generation who can entirely recite Shakespeare's poems and English songs are seeking for an environment to know Bhanubhakta because Nepali first understand \"Gai\" and only connect the meaning of Nepali word \"Gai\" with the cow. It is important to understand \"Ama\" first, only \"mum\" or \"mother\".\n\nBhanubhakta and his words remain immortal.\n\nSuyog Dhakal"
