However, there are few people immortalize their names because of their great deeds. Some of them are immortalized for their outstanding contributions to society, while some are immortalized for their insane talents. Among the few names, Nepali poet Adikavi Bhanubhakta Acharya shines brightly because of his evergreen poems.\n\nThey say the greatest of the greatest people are born one in a million, and Bhanubhakta Acharya was definitely one of them. The greatest treasure Nepal could have. His contributions to Nepali literature was a huge milestone. And even today, in his memory, we celebrate and honor his work by celebrating Bhanu Jayanti on his birthday. During this day, many seminars, events, and conferences are held in order to encourage other rising and hidden talents, to come out and contribute to Nepali literature.\n\nAbout Bhanubhakta Acharya\n\nBhanubhakta was born in 1814 AD (1874 BS) on July 13. He was born in a village called Chundi Ramgh of Tanahun district in Nepal. He was born into a high-class brahmin family. Acharya was educated by his grandfather, Shri Krishna Acharya. His father Dhananjaya Acharya was a government official who worked for General Amar Singh Thapa as Governor of Palpa, in western Nepal.\n\nNot much too given said and known about his early life, but there’s a story that he got inspiration to be a poet from a grass cutter, who was working in scorching heat to build a well just so that he could give something back to the society. He was moved from the determination of the grass cutter.\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya’s career\n\nBack in those days, every piece of literature was written in Sanskrit and common people couldn’t understand the Sanskrit language. So the works were only limited to well-educated brahmin people, who had learned Sanskrit. But, Bhanubhakta Acharya changed the meta and started writing in the Nepali language.\n\nBecause of this, he popularized the Nepali language and Nepali literature as a whole. He also gained the favor of the then Rana family. Acharya also translated the epic Ramayana into Nepali, as he wanted Ramayana to be read by common people who didn’t get the opportunity to learn Sanskrit. Not only that he was also a huge devotee of Lord Ram.\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya is referred to as Adikavi not because he was the very first Nepali poem to every exist in Nepal but because he was the first poet to write in Nepali. He made Nepali a language that can be used in literature writing. He is also given that title as he was the first poet to understand the marma (or inner essence) of poetry.\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya died in 1868 AD (1925 BS). But he has never been forgotten. While he was alive, his works were still being overshadowed by other great writers and poets like Laxmi Prasad Devkota. Acharya died without getting any credits for his works. He got famous and the due recognition after Moti Ram Bhatta found his manuscripts and published them."
