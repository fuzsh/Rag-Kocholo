        "text": "Kathmandu, July 13 – The 208th birth anniversary of the great poet of Nepali literature Bhanubhakta Acharya is being celebrated today by organizing various programs in different places of the country and abroad.\n\nOn this occasion, a wreath-laying and morning procession will be held at the statue of national icon Bhanubhakta in front of Ranipokhari in Kathmandu this morning.\n\nIt is said that the program will be conducted only by organizing physical distance as the infection of corona virus can spread like last year. Those who are unable to attend public events celebrate Bhanu Jayanti at home by reciting the Ramayana translated into Nepali. On this occasion, organizations working in the field of language, literature and culture have also organized various programs through virtual media.\n\nBhanubhakta’s birth anniversary is celebrated in Darjeeling, Sikkim, Bhutan, Burma and many other Nepali-speaking countries and places in India.\n\nIt is said that Bhanubhakta was inspired to compose Ramayana in Nepali as he exhorted a Ghansi to earn a name by doing good deeds after birth. Bhanubhakta has done a great service to the Nepali people by presenting the ‘Ramayana’ with emotional translation of the biography of King Ram of Ayodhya written in simple Nepali language. The Ramayana he translated into Nepali is still recited in Nepali homes with rhythm.\n\nAnother famous work of Bhanubhakta is ‘Vadhushiksha’. Similarly, Bhanubhakta has works like ‘Prashnottar’, ‘Bhaktamala’, ‘Ramgita’ and other works.\n\nIt is said that Bhanubhakta has made a historic contribution in awakening Nepali ethnic unity, national identity and Nepali cultural consciousness and strengthening the national culture.\n\nBhanubhakta, who was born in the village of Chundiramgha in Tanahu on July 13, 1871 BS, died in September 1925 BS."
