Like migratory birdsd flocing Pulicat and Mudumalai sanctuaries , Musicians and Music Lovers from all over the countries and many countries abroad flock to Chennai for the season and enjoy music, dance, discourses etc all through the Season!\n\nJust as an example:\n\nCHENNAIYIL THIRUVAIYARU\n\nThirteenth year this year, programs started on 18th December and concluded on 25th December after the continuous music feast-festival- for eight days right from Morning 7.00 to Night 10.00! Totally there were SIXTY programs!\n\nMYLAPORE FINE ARTS ACADEMY\n\nYear 2017 is the 66th ART FESTIVAL commencing on 11th December to last upto17th January 2018- for 38 days and 158 programs!!\n\nI also attended two programs one in each. I was happy to note that audience were delighted with all programs and enjoyed. Auditoria were decently full.\n\nTHIRUVAIYARU THYAGABRAMMA AARAADHANAA\n\nEver year Thiyagaraja Swamigal’s aradhana is conducted in Thiruvaiyary, in Thanjavur District of Tamilnadu for four days in January on the occasion of the poet-composer’s Samadhi.\n\nPractice here is on all the four days from morn till night musicians young and old from all parts of the world assemble and they have to render only the compositions of Thiyagabrammam. Most of his thousand and odd keerthnas are in Telugu and on Lord Rama and some are in Sanskrit. One John Higgins from England came to attend the aaraadhanaa and so immersed in Thyagaraja Krithis, learnt and performed. He was named as John Higgins Bhagavathar!\n\nThe first session will be devoted to group singing by all the singers from different parts of the Globe assembled-the Pancha Rathna Keerthanas of the Saint Composer. It meens FIVE GEMS OF Lyrics.\n\n.\n\nTELUGU TO TAMIL\n\nIn the world of Karnatic music -the term MUSICAL TRINITY- refers to the greatest three composers Thyaga Brahmam, Muthuswami Deekshithar and Shyama Sastrigal. Thyagayya of Thiruvaiyaru-Tamilnadu has written hundreds of Keerthanas in praise of Lord Rama in Telugu and of them five pearls like compositions are called PANCHA RATHNA KEERTHANAS which are rendered by all Carnatic musicians wherever they are.\n\nIn the year 1963 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India, while inaugurating the “Thyagabramma Aradhana” in Thiruvaiyaru expressed his desire that the Telugu keerthanas should be translated into other languages for greater and deeper appreciation of the songs all over India. It would appear that no efforts were made in this area.\n\nIn the year 2012, on a request by a great scholar from Kanchipuram, I translated the Telugu Pancha Rathna Keerthanas into Tamil which was greatly appreciated by our former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who called on the musicians in Madurai, who brought out a CD of it and heard them sing in person. A detailed account of his visit to the residence of the musicians in Madurai was posted in this Blog under the title “A GREAT DAY WITH Dr. ABDUL KALAM” on 15th March 2015 which is reproduced below:\n\nYes; it was a great day in the life of these music couple of Madurai and their colleague musician! A historical day, an exhilarating day, an inspiring day to remain evergreen in their minds throughout their life time!\n\nIt was Friday the 13th February 2015- the day on which former President of India His Excellency Dr. Abdul Kalam visited a humble musician couple living in Madurai to personally hear the great Pancharathna Keerthanas of Thiruvaiyru Thiyagaraja swamigal – Thyagabrammam-in Telugu translated into Tamil from the lips of the karnatic musician accompanied by her husband in violin and a co-musician in Mridhangam.\n\nDr. Kalam has already heard the renderings in Tamil through the CD which he came across through a common friend. He said that he was so impressed by the translation and the rendition that he used to hear one gem each day. Now utilizing his visit to Madurai he wanted to hear right from the troupe directly! Of course the musicians who with great efforts brought out the CD were making efforts to render the Keerthanas in the presence of the former President who loves Karnatic music, our culture, our traditions, our literature et all with all his heart.\n\nAfter fulfilling a few engagements in the city of Madurai, he planned to visit the musicians in the night and accordingly he arrived at their humble residence at 9.30 in the night and spent an hour. The musicians were in an ecstatic mood and delighted to have a great and noble personality in their humble residence. As the public saw the former President’s convoy entered the street, there was a big surge to have a glance of Dr. kalam who indeed is “காட்சிக்கு எளியவன், கடுஞ்சொல்லன் அல்லன்” எனவே சிறந்த ஆட்சியாளனாக விளங்கியவர், உலகமே வியந்து பாராட்டப்பட்டவர்.\n\nDr. Abdul Kalam being recieved at the residence of Smt. Ranganayaki, vocalist who rendered Tamil Pancharathna Kirthanas along with her husband Shri Sachidanandam, Violinist and Dr. Thiyagarajan, Mridhangist.\n\nAs Dr. kalam arrived he was received with a shawl and the team that rendered the “five gems” of the Saint composer was duly introduced. As he was eager to hear the melodious rendering of “ENTHARO MAHANUBAVULU”- “எத்தனையோ மகான்கள் அத்தனை பேருக்கும் வந்தனம்” it was rendered by the team-vocal accompanied by violin and mridhangam. The prestigious guest heard the rendering with great attention and his body language expressed it all- he was so enthralled with the translation and the rendering. Then he openly appreciated the artists profusely and said the translation was ideal. For decades he has been hearing this ‘keerthana’ without understanding the full meaning and import of the song. He enquired about the person who translated the ‘keerthanas’ and he was shown the profile of the translator and Dr. kalam read it with great joy. He requested the artists to convey his appreciation and compliments to the translator.\n\nA small memento Dr. Kalam\n\nThen was his time for dinner. Knowing his taste ‘hot dosa and kuzippaniyaram’ with ‘coconut chatni and sambar served in hygienically cleaned plates. The guest relished the items and enquired as to who prepared such delicious food. When he was told that it was by the vocal artist, he made a comment: “Your rendering was so sweet and nice as is your dosa and kuzippaniyaram with tasty accompaniments. .You are a great musician and also a great cook. Your kuzippaniyaram and chatni a great combination as ypur melodious rendering perfectly matched with the mridhangam and violin!”\n\nAfter a few snaps with the artists and others former President – dignitary Guest- left the house by 10.30 in the night.\n\n(left to right) Dr. Thiyagarajan, Dr. Abdul Kalam , Shri Sachidanandam, Smt. Ranganayaki\n\nNaturally the hosts could not sleep ruminating over the dream like visit of the former President His Excellency DR. Abdul Kalam to their abode in Madurai.\n\nYes: who are the dramatic personae- in this lovely event on that happy night of 13th February 2015? That is the team of three musicians who with great efforts brought out the CD of Tamil Pancharathna Keerthanas at the instance of Dr. Meenakshi Pattabiraman, former English Professor, a poet, writer and scholar of Madurai.\n\nMrs RANGANAYAKI SACHIDANANTHAM B.Com, M A, M Phil (Music)- Vocal: B High grade AIR artist, TV artist, teaching music to a large number of children, has participated in the NADHA NEERAJANAM” program of TTD Devasthanam; Thirumala, Widely travelled in Singapore and Malaysia for spreading the great carnatic music.\n\nMr. D Sachidanandam Violinist: AIR ‘A’ Grade artist; Kanchi Mutt Asthana Vidwan.

He is the brother of the violinist D.Sachidanandam, husband of the vocalist Smt. Ranganayaki.\n\nPUBLICITY THROUGH MEDIA\n\nThe innovative translation of the keerthanas from Telugu to Tamil attracted the attention of the media – most powerful instruments-.and the leading Tamil monthly magazine named KALAIMAGAL made a review of the CD in one of its issues-February 2013.\n\nOn 22nd of this month THE HINDU-India’s National Newspaper since 1878 made out a news about this CD with tremendous response from the readers of Hindu interested in Karnatic Music and in particular Thyagayya’s keerthanas.\n\nIn one of the ongoing music festivals organized by the first referred CHENNAIYIL THIRUVAIYARU I was honored on 25th December with a shawl and sandal garland for my translating the Keerthanas to Tamil.\n\nIn the second one a reference was made to the translation work.\n\nA neighborhood news paper ANNA NAGAR TIMES in a story on ENVIUS in detail referred to this translated keerthanas which evoked the curiosity of the readers.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this way MUSIC AROUND THE WORLD is exhilarating, ennobling and entertaining.
