        "text": "dmi\n\nAugust 21, 2020\n\nChhabdivarahi is a well-known Hindu religious site at Tanahun, located at the origin of the Chhabdi River. It is about 150 km west from Kathmandu and about 57 km east from Pokhara whereas 7 km east from the headquarters of Tanahun district in the central part of Nepal. According to Shrimad Devi Bhagwat, the creator of the Veda, the Rishi Bedvyas meditated the goddess Jaldevi in the pond. Bedvyas performed strict meditation in this place to fulfill his desire. His desire was to keep something in that place for his mother Satyavati (Matsyagandha) in her remembrance. Jaldevi became extremely happy from his meditation and asked Vyas for a boon. Vyas requested a goddess to remain in the form of a spiritually powered temple in the name of his grandmother which was his mother’s wish. Jaldevi happily granted his wishes and remained as a gold hinged fish on that pond.\n\nChhabdivarahi, the goddess of power and is known for fulfilling the aspirations of all. It is strictly prohibited women from entering the temple and premises during the menstruation period including their husbands if married. According to the custom, if any fish dies in the pond, the temple’s priest has to perform the full ritual according to the Hindu tradition. At the temple premises, there is a Bhimsen temple as well as other several statues of the Deities. There is a tradition to sacrifice animals in the Varahi temple. However, there should not be any sacrificial worship on the day of Aunsi, Ekadashi, and the entire month of Shrawan. Except for these days, there is a crowd of devotees throughout the year. Only Hindu devotees used to worship the temple but nowadays people from all over the country visit here for a picnic, as educational and cultural tours including international tourists.\n\nTherefore, with the upcoming improvements of some infrastructure and good management under the temple, the place is hoping to increase the number of foreign tourists in the near future."
