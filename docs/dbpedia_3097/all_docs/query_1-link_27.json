        "text": "FROM SPINY BABBLER.ORG\n\nText and adaptations by Pallav Ranjan includes the early years of Nepalese literature\n\nLively young women with flowers in their hair\n\nwalk about me with their friends.\n\nThey walk in dreams that are all their own\n\nin this garden-like city that the gods have built.\n\nThe rich in this place are uncountable,\n\neach person’s mind is filled with joy.\n\nKathmandu is an ocean of happiness,\n\nthis may be the golden city that the demons once built.\n\nSome places like Lhasa, London, or China,\n\nsome dark alleys like those of Delhi,\n\nsome places that rival mighty cities of India\n\nare in this city that light has filled.\n\nSwords, hatchets, knives, and khukuris,\n\ndecorated by pistols and even rifles,\n\nbrave and strong men fill all its streets.\n\nCould another place like Kathmandu exist?\n\nThere is no anger, deceit, or falsity,\n\nthere is no limit to dharma and nobility,\n\nthe Lord of Animals protects this city,\n\nthis is the land of God Shiva, the land of immortality.\n\nAfter so many days I have seen the Balaju water gardens again\n\nand I write that underneath earthly skies this is a Heaven.\n\nAll around me are birds that sit or swing upon vines,\n\nmaybe with soft voices they intend to steal my mind.\n\nIf I can stay here and make many verses\n\nwhat better thing or pleasure could I ever wish?\n\nIf there were a beautiful maiden to dance before me,\n\nLord Indra’s paradise I would never miss.\n\nFrom the fifth to the fifteenth century AD, the Khas civilization flourished from its roots in what is now far-west Nepal. Historical documents show that west Nepal, south-west Tibet, and Kumaon and Garhwal of India were united and the Khas language had great influence in these regions during the time of that civilization’s rise. After the fall of the Khas Empire, its language, which evolved into present day Nepali, was considered bastardized and limited to speech. Sanskrit dominated most of the written texts of South Asia and its influence was particularly strong in Nepal.\n\nBrahmins were the teachers, scholars, and priests of the society by virtue of their caste. Their education was Sanskrit oriented since most religious texts of the Hindu religion were in that language.\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya, born to a Brahmin family in 1814 in Tanahu, received an excellent education with a strong leaning towards religion at home from his grandfather. He led an unremarkable life until he met a grass cutter who wanted to give something to the society so that he could be remembered after death. Bhanubhakta was young, and the grass cutter’s words inspired him to write these words:\n\nHe gives his life to cutting grass and earns little money,\n\nhe hopes to make a well for his people\n\nso he will be remembered after death,\n\nthis high thinking grass cutter lives in poverty,\n\nI have achieved nothing though I have much wealth.\n\nI have neither made rest houses nor a well,\n\nall my riches are inside my house.\n\nThis grass cutter has opened my eyes today,\n\nmy life is worthless if the memory of my existence fades away.\n\nThe grass cutter’s wish to be remembered has been fulfilled: he is more romanticized than Adikabi Bhanubhakta, considered the first poet to write in the Khas, or now the Nepali language. While there were other verses written in the Khas language before Bhanubhakta’s time, some of them were hard to identify as poetry – the quality is sketchy; many of the writers disappeared due lack of a forum where they could foster their talents (sadly the audience was just not there); many wrote poetry that was too heavily Sanskritized. Bhanubhakta was definitely “the” writer who gained the acceptance of a wide range of people and his creations played a key role in popularizing the written form of the Khas language.\n\nThe people of the first poet’s time strongly believed that building and renovating temples, shrines, rest houses and taps were acts of dharma. Kings honored their gods with pagoda structures decorated with the best wood, stone, and metal artwork. Every artisan created his piece so it would send a message of goodwill to the palace of Indra, the King of Amarawati, which many considered Heaven. The poor and the rich all tried to give what they could afford to ensure a good afterlife.\n\nBhanubhakta’s contribution was unique. Children who received an education at the time began their studies with light epics like the Ramayan and graduated to the more complex Upanishads and Vedas in his time. Ram’s heroic exploits were highly impressive to Bhanubhakta, so he decided to make the deity more accessible to the people who spoke Khas. (Since the social order did not encourage literacy, most country people did not understand anything when epics were read out to them in Sanskrit.)\n\nWhen completed, his translation of the Ramayan was so lyrical that it was more like a song than a poem. However, his creation was not published and he was to die without receiving credit for his contribution. It was later in 1887 that Moti Ram Bhatta found his manuscript and printed it in Benaras, India, where Bhatta published, wrote critiques, and shared his gazal songs with others. Though priests found a rapt audience when they explained what they had been reading, they could not compete with the pleasant flow of Bhanubhakta’s translation. Soon he and his book became household words.\n\nBhanubhakta did not study Western literature – the West must have been a land of fables for him. The closest city in India was several weeks’ walk away, and there was a huge distinction between those who had been to Kathmandu and those who had not. (When Bhanubhakta first visited Kathmandu, he called it the City of Immortality and compared it to the legendary cities of the gods and demons.) All his ideas and experiences were derived from his native land. This lent such a strong Nepali flavor to his writing that few poets have been able to equal his simple creations in terms of content: a sense of religion, a sense of simplicity, and the warmth of his country are the strongest features of his poetry. Those who read the first lines of the Bhanubhakta Ramayan can clearly feel Nepal in them.\n\nNarad sage went to the Land of Truth one day,\n\nwanting to bring back something good for the creation.\n\nBrahma the Creator was there and the sage\n\nsat at his feet and pleased him with devotion.\n\nThe themes which Bhanubhakta wrote about were uncomplicated. Once he went to visit a friend and not only discovered that his friend was on a journey, but that his wife was extremely rude to wayfarers. Guests and wayfarers were never treated casually by the people of his time. Houses were few and far between and if anyone refused to shelter a traveler, the traveler might have to walk several miles before finding another resting place. On top of this, there were many stories of gods who came in the guise of humans seeking shelter and judged the homeowners by their conduct. Bhanubhakta was shocked by her attitude and wrote:\n\nThe wife of Gajagharsoti is a source of fortunes that are ill\n\nShe has taken leave from us all and is on the way to Hell.\n\nAs said before, the credit of discovering Bhanubhakta goes to Motiram Bhatta. Bhatta took pains to collect the miscellaneous works of Bhanubhakta and published a collection. He also wrote the poet’s biography. The search for Bhanubhakta’s works must have been frustrating. He did not write many poems, or few survived if he did. His works appear in fragments that are neither organized nor titled. He concentrated his efforts on the Ramayan, and most of his short poems deal with events which he felt profoundly about or they sing the praises of his gods.\n\nI believe that Bhanubhakta wrote two masterpieces in his life. One, obviously, is the Bhanubhaktey Ramayan and the other is a letter he wrote in verse form to the prime minister while in prison. Some funds had been embezzled while Bhanubhakta worked for the local government. He misunderstood the situation, signed some papers, was made a scapegoat, and put into prison. His health became bad, he was given false hopes of being set free, and for a long time his case was not even heard. So he wrote a petition to the all-powerful prime minister requesting his freedom. The Nepalese language is always respectful; even today most letters begin with, “I humbly request….” Bhanubhakta’s petition made fun of his own situation and convinced the ruler of his innocence.\n\nEveryday I see kind authorities and they get rid of my worries.\n\nI am at peace and at night I watch dances for free.\n\nI do what my friends – mosquitoes, fleas, and bedbugs – say:\n\nthe mosquitoes sing and the ticks dance, I watch their play.\n\nI was jobless, wealth-less, my hard-earned food came from the spade,\n\nI served those people so everyone would notice me and give me respect.\n\nWithout wavering I served and they were pleased and they gave\n\noverflowing attention that is never, ever, taken away.\n\nI am forty, I have a son who is eight years old.\n\nThe time for celebrating his manhood-ceremony is close.\n\nI am rotting inside these four walls, so what can I do, my Lord?\n\nHow can I complete the ceremony in this darkness-filled world.\n\nThe secret of success should be given by the father,\n\nthe lessons of life should be given by the mother,\n\nmy child has yet to study the Vedas and serve his teacher,\n\ntherefore to you, my Owner, I repeat my prayer.\n\nEven while a great ruler like you own this earth,\n\na Brahmin’s rituals of manhood are being delayed.\n\nWhose feet do I have to place my sorrow at except yours?\n\nPlease take pity on me and decide my case for better or worse.\n\nMy body is weak, it is made of grain and water.\n\nHow shall I say what has befallen me here?\n\nI have suffered much sorrow, my body grows heavy,\n\nand I have been ill for many days.\n\nI was imprisoned for a long time at Kumarichowk,\n\nillness came upon me there and after much trouble I went home.\n\nWhen I became well they brought me here,\n\nnow you, my Owner, you are my only hope.\n\nWhatever I explained to the authorities in writing is true.\n\nBut others’ answers and written proofs, I am told,\n\nhave proved wrong all that I have said.\n\nI told them I would pay their fines a thousand-fold.\n\nBut they say they have signatures on papers and letters,\n\nthey say their witnesses have many more tales.\n\nI said I would not plead, I would rather be false,\n\nI will say anything that gets me outside these walls.\n\nI have no wish to spend the rest of my life in this quarrel.\n\nI have no wish to become a millionaire and fill my house with treasures.\n\nDays pass by uselessly and I cannot comfort myself\n\nif you would decide my case it would be a great help.\n\nI have talked with the warden and he does not speak.\n\nEven if he does, his: “tomorrow, tomorrow,” sounds like a joke.\n\nWhat are these tomorrows? It would be better to know I won’t be freed.\n\nMany tomorrows passed. Please fill this empty bag of mine, I beg.\n\nBhanubhakta not only won his freedom with his poem, but was given a bag of money as well. So passed the most dangerous and exciting time of his life. He died in 1868 a simple man who did not know that he would be among the most revered creators of Nepal. Today Bhanubhakta is called Adikabi, the first poet of Nepal. Perhaps, it is only he and Laxmi Prasad Devkota that have become literary gods in this country. The only difference between the two is that Devkota’s works continue to enjoy as much celebrity as the great poet himself while Bhanubhakta’s fame tends to overshadow his writings. The eulogy that Devkota wrote to Bhanubhakta Acharya a century later follows.\n\nThe Grass Cutter\n\nby Laxmi Prasad Devkota\n\nA tired young man,\n\nhis head on a pillow of rock,\n\nsleeps underneath a tree.\n\nA grass cutter sharpens his blade\n\nnear him leisurely.\n\nA sweet song of the forest\n\nsteals into a gentle dream.\n\nA heart flies towards Heaven\n\nfrom the clear world of the living.\n\nWakening, the bright youth asks,\n\n“What are you doing grass cutter?”\n\nHe replies smiling,\n\n“Well, we all will go our way,\n\nevery person alone.\n\nThere is no one in my heart\n\nfor whom to tire my fingers.\n\nSo I sell this grass and collect money\n\nto build a rest house and a tap for my people.\n\nIf we do not sow, how will anything grow?\n\nAnd how long will we play with toys?\n\nThe sickle dances\n\nand the grass cutter continues,\n\nhalting, collecting moments\n\nas if they are bright jewels.\n\n“This forest belongs to the gods\n\nand this is a ripe field to be cut.\n\nI reap my fruit and pay rent to the earth.\n\nThis life is two days of sun and shade,\n\nso I give to the gods\n\nthe rest house and the watering place.”\n\nMagnetized, the youth stares at him.\n\nIt is as if lightning flashed.\n\nLeaves rustle and forest birds\n\nfly into the darkness of the trees.\n\n“Oh”, from somewhere a thin sound,\n\n“The worth of this grass cutter’s life.”\n\nThe person who slept in the forest\n\nis shaken awake, he is shaken awake.\n\nHis eyes are moist,\n\nhis breasts rise and fall,\n\ntwo tear drops fall upon the rock.\n\nThe tear drops from a caring heart\n\nmake the forest’s colors strange\n\nand writing on the stone like pure waves\n\nsing beautifully like the birds\n\nof the forest,\n\nthe home,\n\nand of the cage.\n\nSurroundings drink the elixir of immortality\n\nand the hills hum among themselves.\n\nCool floods, and shades of happiness,\n\nheat and thirst are gone today.\n\nO wonderful star of Saturn,\n\nO these first sounds of Nepal.\n\nMay such grass cutters fill the grounds\n\nbeneath the skies of my Nepal.\n\nThis language, strange and endearing,\n\nwelcome like the broken voice of a child.\n\nShy syllables, these first tender sounds,\n\nsimple, transparent, and filled with light.\n\nO birthday of my people’s language,\n\ncome down! come down to this earth again!\n\nIt has been many days since you left\n\nand this whole country has become thirsty again.\n\nWhat a wonderful past!\n\nWhy would the smells not be gentle?\n\nWhy would the world not be bright?"
