Adikavi Bhanubhakta Acharya is being remembered by organising various programmes to mark his 210th birth anniversary on Friday.

Born on July 13 1814 at Chudiramgha of Tanahun district in western Nepal, Acharya is known for translating the Ramayan to Nepali from Sanskrit.

The Nepali version of the spiritual Ramayan is an evergreen literature which established Acharya as a bard among Nepalis.

A morning procession was organised to mark the birth anniversary of the pioneer poet and national luminary.

A horse-drawn carriage with a mounted portrait of Bhanu Bhakta was paraded around the Capitalâ€™s main thoroughfare, in sync with various folk instruments.

Here are some photos of the procession captured by the Post photojournalist Elite Joshi.
