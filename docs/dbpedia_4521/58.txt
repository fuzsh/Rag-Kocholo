Snoop Dogg found himself in an unexpected spotlight during the Opening Ceremony for the Paris Olympics when Simone Biles' mother, Nellie Biles, brought up a nearly forgotten encounter from over a decade ago. As "The Today Show's" Hoda Kotb facilitated the interview, it was revealed that the rapper had an interesting history with the Biles family.

While interviewing the Biles family ahead of Simone's third Olympic appearance, Kotb dropped a surprising tidbit. "Snoop, I don't know if you know this, but Simone and you have known each other for a long time. Right, Nellie?" she prompted. A bewildered Snoop asked, "How? How Nellie?"

Nellie Biles then recounted their brief yet memorable meeting. "I will never forget that we met you in Times Square. 2010," she began. "And you said—'cause we asked for a picture—two minutes. One, two, and you were gone."

From Awkward Past to Present Support

Despite the less-than-welcoming encounter, Snoop Dogg showed his support for Simone Biles during the qualification round, donning a t-shirt emblazoned with a photo of the gymnast. He was seen seated next to Jordan Chiles's parents and surrounded by a group of Hollywood A-listers, including Ariana Grande and Tom Cruise.

Snoop, who has also become an official NBC commentator for the Olympics, extended his support to other athletes, notably wearing a similar T-shirt to cheer on tennis star Coco Gauff.

Simone Biles from Spring, Texas, and Sunisa Lee from St. Paul, Minn., lead the American team and make history as the first two Olympic all-around champions to face each other in the final competition.
