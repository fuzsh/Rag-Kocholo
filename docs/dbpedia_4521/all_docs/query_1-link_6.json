        "text": "Since this may be one of the last entries in this blog for some time, it only makes sense to end with Kendrick Lamar, an individual who is the poster boy of bring more meaning out of rap music than just the existing stereotypes. In 2016, Kendrick Lamar had 11 Grammy nominations, which was one short of Michael Jackson for the most of all time. These nominations came mainly from his album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which took a very socially conscious look at the state of race relations in the United States. In his more recent album, Damn, Kendrick takes a more personal look at human tendencies through song titles like “Love”, “Lust”, “Loyalty”, “Fear”, and “Pride”. Focusing on “Loyalty” today, Kendrick uses this song to show how much he values loyalty in the relationships that he is in.\n\nKendrick Lamar at 2016 Grammys\n\nWith a feature from Rihanna, in this song, Kendrick looks at loyalty through the lens of not only romantic relationships, but friendships as well. The very first verse of this song sets the stage for what will follow:\n\n“It’s a secret society\n\nAll we ask is trust\n\nAll we got is us\n\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyalty\n\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyalty”\n\nHere, Kendrick is comparing his inner circle of friends and lovers as his own secret society. Similar to secret societies that have rules that serve as a passage of entry, Kendrick’s rule for entry into his circle is that he can trust the people that enter. This trust is attained through loyalty. A similar message is created through another creative verse here:\n\n“10-4, no switchin’ sides\n\nFeel somethin’ wrong\n\nYou actin’ shifty, you don’t ride\n\nWith me no more, I need\n\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyalty\n\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyalty”\n\nKendrick is known for his clever wordplay. In this, “10-4” is a reference to the fact that 10 and 4 are on the opposite sides of a clock. Someone who doesn’t show loyalty would be “shifty” when something is going wrong. While someone who loyal would remain with Kendrick through thick and thin, someone who lacks loyalty would “run” to the other side of clock to avoid trouble.\n\nJust like many people who are put into a position of power or fame, Kendrick feels a sense of mistrust of the people around him. To him, it is hard to gauge whether people are truly loyal or just in it to take advantage of him.\n\n“Tell me who you loyal to\n\nIs it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?\n\nIs it comin’ down with the loud pipes in the rain?”\n\nIn Kendrick’s head, many of the people who even seem like they are loyal aren’t necessarily loyal to him. Instead, they are loyal to the things Kendrick can provide for them like money, fame, and access to drugs and alcohol. Not only is Kendrick himself questioning the loyalty of the people around him, but he is forcing his audience to do the same.\n\n“I said, tell me who you loyal to\n\nIs it anybody that you would lie for?\n\nAnybody you would slide for?\n\nAnybody you would die for?\n\nThat’s what God for”\n\nAs listeners of this song, based on the questions Kendrick poses to us, we also are forced to question the loyalty we hold with people around us. To end, since Kendrick is pretty religious, he claims that one source of constant loyalty that an individual can find is in God.\n\nConsidering how Kendrick lives his life, he himself tries his best to be very loyal. He has been very loyal to his poor, crime-infested hometown of Compton despite having more than enough money to leave and never look back. He has been very loyal to his fans by not changing his attitude regardless of his growing status. He has been very loyal to his partner in life – Whitney Alford – who he has been in love with since high school. In this song and many others, Kendrick practices what he preaches, which makes what he says so real. In the current generation of rap music, I will be the first to admit that the existing stereotypes make up the majority of the music that is produced. However, hidden gems like the projects created by Kendrick Lamar should not be ignored as they are the key to breaking the stereotypes of rap music.\n\nAt first impression, XXXTentacion (who I will call X for the sake of readability in this entry) would be seem like a rapper in the category of rappers like Lil Pump that I have looked.\n\nXXXTentacion\n\nWith his unorthodox appearance, multiple visits to the slammer, and overall reckless attitude that he expresses in some of his songs, X could easily fall into the category of rappers that make the stereotype of rap music. While X does produce music that lives up to this stereotype, he has a very diverse musical library that is not admired since his bombastic tracks overshadow his more purposeful work. In his song that made it to the top 10 of the Billboard Top 100, the song “SAD!” takes us inside the mind of X as he deals with a breakup with a girl that he was in love with.\n\nWhile sad breakup songs are nothing new in the R&B/Pop, the raw male emotionality that X shows on this rap song is far from the norm. The long chorus that makes most of the song gives a good idea of how X is feeling in this post-breakup stage:\n\n“Who am I? Someone that’s afraid to let go, uh\n\nYou decide if you’re ever gonna let me know\n\nSuicide if you ever try to let go, uh\n\nI’m sad, I know, yeah, I’m sad, I know, yeah\n\nWho am I? Someone that’s afraid to let go, uh\n\nYou decide if you’re ever gonna let me know\n\nI’m sad, I know, yeah, I’m sad, I know, yeah”\n\nThe very first line of this song where X says that he is “afraid to let go” are words that are not heard often in the rap community. Many male rappers, including X, measure themselves are their street cred and toughness. Especially for someone like X who has openly talked about his past history of crime involving even killing people, this raw emotion is unprecedented and counterproductive to raising his street rep. However, for X, his openness about his love life lets him reach an audience that many of the “tough guy” rappers might be missing out on because they are not willing to explore the entirety of their artistic abilities.\n\nRealistically, what X is saying is not anything that we have not heard before. It is really just the prototypical sad lyrics that all artists produce after a tough break up. This is further seen in the first verse:\n\n“I gave her everything\n\nShe took my heart and left me lonely\n\nI think broken heart’s contagious\n\nI won’t fix, I’d rather weep\n\nI’m lost then I’m found\n\nBut it’s torture bein’ in love\n\nI love when you’re around\n\nBut I fuckin’ hate when you leave”\n\nTo reiterate, X really isn’t saying anything here that is out of the ordinary in music in general. However, the very fact that X is saying that he “weeps” because of his breakup is so unorthodox in the genre of music that he is in. The fact that X is breaking out of his shell to produce a song about this heartbreak also shows that he is actually hurt from this breakup. Despite the lyrics being very elementary, X says that he gave this girl everything and she left him. In spite of that, he still loves her and wants her back.\n\nWhile X would be considered by most as a rapper who lives up the stereotypes of rap music, he has a different side of him that many people don’t see. In this case, X is unique in that he can diversify his music enough to reach different audiences and expand his reach. This might be the explanation to his sudden rise to the top of the rap scene.\n\nIn 2015, the biopic, Selma, was nominated for multiple Oscars because of how powerful it was in bringing the events of the Civil Rights Movement to a theatre screen. Specifically, this filmed focused on the impactful marches led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from Selma to Montgomery culminating in Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. While the riveting performances of the actors and the intricate writing of the directors played a pivotal part in the success of this biopic, what was equally important was the musical performances incorporated as well. Common’s rap song – “Glory” – with vocals from John Legend became the anthem to this film and also the anthem for more current race-related movements like Black Lives Matter during the riots in Ferguson.\n\nMarches led by MLK from Selma to Montgomery\n\nThe premise of this song is to encourage people to apply the tactics using during the civil rights movement to the current racial issues that are being faced in the United States. To show similarities between the two time periods, Common begins with this line:\n\n“The movement is a rhythm to us\n\nFreedom is like religion to us\n\nJustice is juxtapositionin’ us\n\nJustice for all just ain’t specific enough”\n\nFor the Black Lives Matter movement, a common retaliation to its efforts has been the All Lives Matter movement. While many people in the Black Lives Matter would agree that all lives do in fact matter, the point of the movement is to highlight that black lives are being threatened currently and more attention needs to be put on them. Similarly, in the 1960s, when MLK led marches to increase the access of African Americans to voting, the common counter is that African Americans are allowed to vote. However, the point MLK was trying to make was that while African Americans are allowed to vote, there are existing limitations. While this comparison required reading into, other comparisons between the time periods are much more straightforward:\n\n“That’s why Rosa sat on the bus\n\nThat’s why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up”\n\nThis comparison requires no explanation; by putting two powerful images from both movements side by side, the sentiments of the civil rights movement are recreated in modern times.\n\nAfter drawing comparisons, Common urges current protestors to follow in the footsteps of their ancestors by using peaceful techniques:\n\n“The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful\n\nWe sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through”\n\nIn the early stages of the riots in Ferguson, violent protests were the norm. Businesses were vandalized, buildings and cars were burned, and conflict emerged with the police. Not only were this protestors destroying their own city, but there were not making any progress toward their goal, which was to end police brutality against African Americans. Considering the success MLK had with peaceful measures, through this song, Common want to remind current protestors that violence is not the measure to create change in society. But further, Common reminds the youth of this generation – the same youth primarily involved in the violent acts- to look their elders for guidance:\n\n“No one can win the war individually\n\nIt takes the wisdom of the elders and young people’s energy”\n\nTowards the beginning of the Ferguson riots, the energy of the youth was being channeled in the wrong way as they were resorting to violence. To combat this, Common encourages the youth to look to their elders for guidance on how to use their energy in the right way.\n\nBy being a fitting song for the issues of the time with a everlasting message that can be applied to every generation, Common captured an Oscar for his song “Glory”. Common serves as a beacon of civility not only within the rap community, but in society itself.\n\nSo far, many of the artists I have looked at fall on one of two extremes. Either they are very serious about issues like mental health, racial equality, and social issues or they are “stereotypical” rappers who just rap about sex, money, and drugs. However, Lil Dicky is a rapper who doesn’t really fit into either category very smoothly. Lil Dicky has made a rap career for himself based on making comedic songs. David – Lil Dicky – Burd graduated at the top of his class from the University of Richmond with a degree in business administration. After, working as an account manager at an advertising firm for two years while pursuing his rap career on the side, Lil Dicky gave up his 9-5 for the life of being a rap star. Needless to say, his unique style has made an attention grabbing artist that is loved by people from all sects of the rap community. What makes Lil Dicky special is that he embraces who he is and makes the most of it. On many of his songs, he is making fun of himself for being a nerdy, affluent, Jewish boy. In one of his breakout songs, “Professional Rapper”, Lil Dicky creates a song that is really an interview where Lil Dicky is pitching himself to Snoop Dogg on why he should become a professional rapper.\n\nSnoop Dogg (left) and Lil Dicky (right)\n\nSince this song is set up like an interview, much of the song is in a question and answer format where Snoop Dogg is trying to figure out whether Lil Dicky is worthy enough to be a full time rapper. One of the first questions Lil Dicky is asked is about what kind of hardships he faced while growing up. To this, Lil Dicky answers that his undergraduate education was very hard because there was immense parental pressure on him to be successful. Snoop Dogg was not impressed as he replied,\n\n“Boo hoo what a hardship\n\nHow you paid to get the rap shit started?”\n\nOff the top of my head, I couldn’t name more than a couple rapper that I know that have a college degree. For OG rappers like Snoop Dogg, Lil Dicky’s degree means nothing. However, Lil Dicky remains honest with his reality even when he answers the next question about how he paid to start his rap career:\n\n“Man, my Bar Mitzvah money\n\nBut don’t diss me buddy, I wasn’t one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose\n\nI must’ve wanted this a lot, I had something to choose”\n\nIn typical Lil Dicky fashion, he is sure to throw in a little joke about his Jewish upbringing by talking about his Bar Mitzvah. However, the more important part of this lyric is where Lil Dicky explains that he wasn’t a person “who had nothing to lose”. Lil Dicky had a successful career that he gave up to become a rapper. This sacrifice is something Lil Dicky uses to show how passionate he is about rapping.\n\nSnoop Dogg also posed some hypotheticals to Lil Dicky on what he do if he were put in a situation that many rappers are put in. For example, Snoop Dogg asked,\n\n“In a club and a couple n***as threaten you?”\n\nHere, Lil Dicky replied by saying that he really wouldn’t do anything. This reply enraged Snoop Dogg as he said,\n\n“If you wanna do this, then you won’t get far acting like a little b***h”\n\nOne of the underlying stereotypes of rap music that I have not addressed for most of these blogs is the ruthless masculinity that some rappers try to show. Being the “tough guy” who won’t back down from anyone and is emotionless is traditionally seen as a staple of the rap community. However, as Lil Dicky explains, he wants to change this need for masculinity since he doesn’t fit that persona:\n\n“Nah, that’s my niche!\n\nDon’t get offended by this, but that’s the market y’all missed\n\nThat’s the target I’ll hit\n\nAnd that’s the heart of my pitch\n\nI wanna do this whole thing different”\n\nInstead of trying to conform to the standards of rap, Lil Dicky is very comfortable with who he is and wants to bring this into the rap scene. If anything, Lil Dicky appeals to a whole new audience that may have originally been isolated from listening to rap music. Since Lil Dicky has established that he is a skilled rapper in terms of his lyrics and flow, his diversity only adds to how many people the rap community can reach. In a culture filled with “macho men” who spend most of their time flexing who has more money and who has more street cred, Lil Dicky is just a normal guy who likes making funny rap songs that people enjoy. Just like anyone who attains success, Lil Dicky has his equal share of supporters and haters. Ultimately, Lil Dicky has created his only lane in rap. A lane that really only he fits in.\n\nIt’s been awhile since I have taken a look at a rap song that lives up to the stereotypes of rap music (music about money, sex, and drugs). I feel like this is important to do to truly highlight the stark differences between quality rap music and loads of garbage like the song “D-Rose”. If the name Lil Pump sounds familiar, it’s because he was the same artist I talked about the last time I looked at a song from the bottom feeders of the rap scene. For a quick recap, Lil Pump is a 17 year old high school dropout/rapper from Florida who has a grown a strong fan base over the course of 2017. The last song I looked at – “Gucci Gang” – sat at the top of the Billboard Top 100 for weeks and this song is also one of his top hits. Sadly, the pitiful lyrics we saw in “Gucci Gang” will be back again here today.\n\nRappers get a bad rap for being very materialistic. Since many rappers have fallen upon a pile of money that they never had before, they don’t know what to do with it and splurge on unnecessary items. Lil Pump fits the status quo perfectly as this song is literally about two expensive watches that Lil Pump owns:\n\n“100 on my wrist, 80 on my wrist\n\n100 on my wrist, 80 on my wrist\n\n100 on my wrist, 80 on my wrist\n\n100 on my wrist, 80 on my wrist\n\nD Rose, D Rose, D Rose, D Rose\n\nD Rose, D Rose, D Rose, D Rose\n\nD Rose, D Rose, D Rose, D Rose\n\nD Rose, D Rose, D Rose, D Rose\n\n80 on my wrist, 100 on my wrist\n\n80 on my wrist, 100 on my wrist\n\n80 on my wrist, 100 on my wrist\n\n80 on my wrist, 100 on my wrist\n\nD Rose, D Rose, D Rose, D Rose\n\nD Rose, D Rose, D Rose, D Rose\n\nD Rose, D Rose, D Rose, D Rose\n\nD Rose, D Rose, D Rose, D Rose”\n\nIn this repetitive message, all that is really being said is the price of Lil Pump’s watches. The line “80 on my wrist, 100 on my wrist” is a direct reference to the price of his two watches where one of his watches cost $100,000 and the other cost $80,000. If this chorus wasn’t arbitrary enough, the reason the song is called “D-Rose” is because Lil Pump was watching Derrick Rose play basketball and was inspired to write a song about him. Clearly, Lil Pump was attracted to the fact that Rose was a wealthy basketball player, and wanted to draw parallels between himself and Rose.\n\nAside from the hook, the usual medley of pointless lyrics fill in the rest of the song.\n\n“Pop 4 Xans, now I’m feelin’ like a hero”\n\n“4 bands (thousand dollars) in the kitchen\n\n9 bands (thousand dollars) in the kitchen”\n\n“Lean got me like Rio”\n\nAll of these lines can be seen in all of the other songs in Lil Pump’s collection. The only sense of creativity that can be seen here is in the line about lean where he creates a simile with the movie Rio. Essentially, what he is saying is that lean makes him feel like the crazy parrot from the movie Rio. While creative, there is no sense of cohesion with the rest of the song or really any of the other lyrics around it.\n\nLil Pump is currently touring the country with sold out crowds and is having the time of his life. While I can bash his lack of actual artistry in music, the reality is that he is happy with what he does and people do enjoy his music. However, when it comes to breaking the stereotypes of rap music, Lil Pump is one of the problems that need to be acknowledged.\n\nDespite not even being anywhere near a professional athlete, the sports media could not keep the name “Lavar Ball” out of their coverage in 2017. While his son, Lonzo Ball, made the transition into the NBA from college basketball, despite Lonzo being the #2 overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft, sports fans were more mesmerized by his loud-mouth father, Lavar. With outlandish comments like him saying that he could beat Michael Jordan 1-on-1 or that his son was better than pros like Steph Curry before even playing a single professional minute, Lavar quickly became a polarizing sports dad. While some see his passionate comments as his support for his son, others see it as an effort from Lavar to live out his sports aspirations vicariously through his son. On top of being a talented athlete, Lonzo also has a poetic side in the form of his rapping abilities; in this song, Lonzo expresses how he feels about his dad regardless of how the media wants to portray him.\n\nLonzo Ball and Lavar Ball\n\nMany sports pundits have argued that Lonzo’s father has been his biggest weakness so far in his professional basketball career. By making hyperbolic statements and touting his sons skills before even playing, it’s been said that Lavar has been “writing checks that his son can’t cash” – or in other words, hyping him up, but leading him to failure if Lonzo can’t live up to his father’s expectations. Despite Lonzo saying that his father’s comments don’t bother him, the media continues to paint Lavar as Lonzo’s kryptonite:\n\n“Listen to the story, not just how it’s told\n\nYellin’ he the devil, but yet you the one who sold your soul”\n\nWhile outsiders may have their impression of who Lavar is (some who have said he is as bad as the devil), Lonzo values the personal side of his relationship with his father that noone else can understand. Especially coming from an African American descent, there are many occurrences of fathers not being involved in their children’s life. With that in mind, although some would argue Lavar is too involved, Lonzo appreciates how active his father is:\n\n“Y’all can hate him, that’s my pops though\n\nFirst one that’s there for me once it got cold”\n\nApart from the personal side, Lavar Ball has also utilized the media attention he received to build his family business: Big Baller Brand. Just like many other affairs of the Ball family, the mantra of putting family first holds tight as what is now a massive company is almost entirely run by the extended Ball family.\n\n“Man I hope the brand goes\n\nPops workin’ every week, doin’ different shows”\n\nThe Big Baller Brand has been another area of criticism that Lavar Ball has faced as many see him exploiting Lonzo’s athletic success to build a brand. While this may be true, Lavar isn’t doing it with heinous intentions since Lonzo is in support of it. From a bigger picture, Lavar is trying to change the way professional sports work. Normally, when a top tier college player comes to the NBA, he will be approached by the top brands like Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour. With this will come a shoe deal and a contract of a few million dollars. Even though Lonzo was offered this, Lavar had bigger aspirations for his son. In his typical “extra” fashion, Lavar asked for a billion dollar contract from the big three shoe companies for Lonzo Ball and his two younger sons, LaMelo and LiAngelo. After this offer was laughed at, the Big Baller Brand built their own shoe line and Lonzo now wears his own shoes in game.\n\nWhile it’s hard to vouch for someone that is already making millions, the reality is that these young athletes get trapped making a few million dollars while the major companies make billions using the athlete’s name. Lavar didn’t want this to happen to his own son, so he created a new path for his son through his family company.\n\nMixtape Cover\n\nFor the most part, it seems like Lavar does have his sons best intentions in mind when he makes these decisions. Despite the negative press he gets, its good to see that his son supports him through the media whirlwind the family faced in 2017. Even though Lonzo has continuously supported his father in press interviews, the reporters can’t seem to get it through their heads. Maybe the power of music will be what finally persuades the critics.\n\nWhile the babyface may fool you, the multi-talented Donald Glover is 34 years old with a background in the creative arts that not many can match. In his 34 years, Glover has been a actor, writer, director, comedian, producer, singer, songwriter, and disc jockey. Whenever he can squeeze time in, he’s also rapped under the stage name of Childish Gambino. What is amazing is that while some would think that Glover is spreading himself thin, he has consistently strived in all of these roles. In fact, most of his rap fans are upset that rapping isn’t his top priority as he doesn’t release many projects anymore. Fortunately, we have Gambino’s older work like “Be Alone” took look back on.\n\nAs the name implies, “Be Alone” is song where Gambino reflects on the loneliness that comes with fame. While most people only think about the glamour of celebrity life, it is common among people of fame to face depression and loner tendencies.\n\n“Music was my side chick, but now we’re moving in together\n\nAlways felt misunderstood, I guess I have to tolerate”\n\nHere, Gambino establishes the transition of music from being a hobby to a legitimate profession (although some might disagree because Childish Gambino barely spends any of his time on rap, but that’s besides the point). Even though Gambino always made fun of because of his high voice and spunky personality, adding the fame on top of it made him feel even more alone and misunderstood.\n\nMuch of this loneliness comes from the fact that with fame, it is hard to distinguish who you can trust and who is just in it for the money. Especially with girls, Gambino – who is single – had a tough time developing a relationship because a voice in the back of his head would tell him to question the intentions of the female.\n\n“Now my computer screen’s the only place I feel a spark”\n\n“Canon 5D to take pictures\n\nOf these girls who wouldn’t talk to me a year ago”\n\nBy consistently having doubts about whether girls are going to be “gold diggers”, Gambino is barely able to “feel a spark” – or have a connection – with a girl.\n\nWhile not being able to find a significant other, Gambino does find some solitude in his family. While Gambino acknowledges that family will always be there for him, he also realizes that his family will leave him at one point too:\n\n“I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before\n\nI wanna pick up the phone, ask my dad how to handle it\n\nBut what will happen when my dad’s not there to answer it?”\n\nIn a genre of music where raw emotionality is rare, Gambino really exposes himself to everyone. This comes out clearly in simplistic, yet passionate hook:\n\n“I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone\n\nI don’t wanna be alone\n\nI don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone\n\nI don’t wanna be alone”\n\nPart of the reason why Gambino was able to do this without facing backlash from the “hardcore” rappers is because he only has one foot in the door of the rap scene. While Gambino is a rapper, Donald Glover is so many other things. Even though Gambino’s diversity of interests dilutes the amount of rap music he can produce, the outside perspectives he brings into his music only elevates the quality of what he produces.\n\nChance the Rapper is one of those rappers that you either know or don’t. While not being a complete mainstream artist, Chance has gained a cult following that has propelled him into the upper echelon of his profession. After releasing multiple projects, his first studio album – Coloring Book – made history by being the first album to reach the Billboard Top 100 with only streaming sales. In fact, I should use the word sales with caution because Chance actually gives away all of his music for free, and only makes money from his music through the live performances he does. Clearly, Chance the Rapper is a transformative artist in the rap industry, and the significance of the content he talks about reinforces this. One of his songs – “Summer Friends” – that is my personal favorite captures Chance’s childhood in the ghettos of West Chatham in Chicago.\n\nWhile the whole Coloring Book album is a nostalgic flashback of Chance’s humble beginnings, this song specifically is about the childhood friends that Chance lost while becoming famous. He begins by describing the type of kids him and his friends were: (Disclaimer – while I normally put sound clips of the songs into these blogs, Chance doesn’t sell his songs; he only streams them sooo to avoid illegal downloads there won’t be any audio.)\n\n“Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids\n\nI was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma’s crib\n\nBunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys”\n\nAlthough Chance and his friends were normal kids who enjoyed playing outside and having fun, because of their harsh backgrounds, him and his friends had a tendency of getting in trouble. In this line, Chance points out how he had to go to his grandmas house a lot because he would be rude to his mother. As the song goes on, a distinction starts to grow between Chance and his friends. While Chance found music as a passion and an avenue out of his harsh home life, some of his friends got stuck and never found a way out:\n\n“Summer school get to losing students\n\nBut the CPD getting new recruitment\n\nOur summer don’t, our summer\n\nOur summer don’t get no shine no more”\n\nHere, Chance explains that he didn’t see his friends as much during the summer because they all ended up in summer school. Sadly, summer school was just the first in a string of bad circumstances his friends were thrown into. As summer school didn’t work, his friends dropped out and turned to crime, which led to the “CDP (Chicago Police Department) getting new recruitment”. Compared to the fun summers of the past, these more recent summers lacked the shine of the past.\n\nFrom his previous project – Acid Rap – to Coloring Book, Chance establishes his transition away from his hood life into a new style of gospel music (while still maintaining the rap style).\n\n“Ready my blessing, now I’m ready how I wait\n\nNever let a friendship get in my way\n\nNever let a blog get in my way\n\nMake the whole song do whatever I say”\n\nThrough these lines, Chance affirms that regardless of the pressures of his remaining friends to return to his ghetto life, he won’t change from his faith in preaching positive messages to his audience. At times, Chance has been criticized because his newer music tends to be slightly preachy in the way he delivers his message. In general, everything Chance does from the type of music he sings to the way he releases it is very unique. At the very least, he definitely doesn’t fit into what people consider the normal mold of rap music.\n\nSticking with the trend of analyzing some older music, this week, we’re going to spin it back to a song from what people consider the golden era of rap: the 90s. When people think of 90s rap, one of the first name that comes to mind is Biggie (or Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls). While Biggie was one of the biggest rappers of his time and is still considered an all time great, he had many suicidal tendencies. As a self-proclaim “gangsta”, Biggie made many bad decisions in his young life, which quickly regretted. One of his bad decisions led to his tragic death in a drive-by shooting where he died at the young age of 25. Three years before his death, Biggie released his most well known album, Ready to Die, in which he released the song “Suicidal Thoughts”.\n\nWhile the hope for songs about suicide is that they end with a positive message, this song is not one of the cases as it maintains the dark theme throughout. One of the problems in Biggie’s life that he highlights is that he is a disappointment in the eyes of all the people around him. One example he gives is of his mother.\n\n“Lyin’ to my mother, even stealin’ out her purse\n\nCrime after crime, from drugs to extortion\n\nI know my mother wish she got a f***in’ abortion\n\nShe don’t even love me like she did when I was younger”\n\nA mother’s love is like no other since you know that regardless of you do, your mother will still love you. However, since Biggie feels as if he has lost the purest form of love there is, there is no love for him left in the world. Additionally, with Biggie’s newfound fame, he feels like the people that do say they love him are just doing it to get of piece of his fortune.\n\n“People at the funeral frontin’ like they miss me\n\nMy baby mama kiss me, but she glad I’m gone”\n\nWith suicidal thoughts in mind, Biggie isn’t willing to accept the love of the people around him and sees it all as a front.\n\nThroughout out the song, Biggie throws out a medley of suicidal thoughts he has had over the years:\n\n“I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bulls**t”\n\n“I’m glad I’m dead, a worthless f**kin’ buddha head”\n\n“Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street”\n\nAll of these thoughts stem from the built up regret Biggie has in his life. From his gang activity to cheating on his wife to hurting his mother have culminated in such a strong feeling of guilt. One of the points I made in the first few entries of this blog was that talking about some gruesome topics like gang activity and crime was OK if it was a reflection of the artist’s life. What isn’t right is when someone who has never experienced these awful circumstances raps about it simply because it is popular. This is one of the few cases where talking about criminal activity is “good” because instead of glorifying it, Biggie is condemning it through the form of self-regret. It is a shame that Biggie only lived for three more years after this album was released because if he would have lived longer, he could have brought more positive messages to the rap genre.\n\nWith the start of a new year, anticipation is very high about the new rap albums coming out throughout the course of this year. The first batch of new tunes will kick off late next week when Migos will drop their long-awaited Culture 2 album. However, until then, we’ll have to look into the past for our tunes. Specifically today, we’ll look back to 2012 at Killer Mike’s song, “Reagan”. With as aggressive of a name as “Killer Mike”, this song lives up to this level of aggression as Killer Mike attacks Ronald Reagan for his shortcomings and extrapolates this to all politicians.\n\nKiller Mike makes it very clear that he is not a fan of Ronald Raegan. He hates him so much that he ends this song by saying “I’m glad Reagan dead”. Reagan is traditionally esteemed as one of the better presidents in US history, so this is an interesting take. From the start of the song, Killer Mike deteriorates the ethos of Reagan by bringing up the Iran-Contra scandal. Killer Mike first samples a piece of Reagan’s speech where he denies the scandal\n\nDespite the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not, repeat, did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we\n\nfollowed by another clip where he concedes to the scandal.\n\nA few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that’s true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not\n\nUsing Reagan’s own words and voice to show his lies makes this that much more powerful. Throughout the song, Killer Mike points out specific policies implemented by Reagan that he takes issue with. One of the policies of Reagan that specifically hurt Killer Mike’s community was the war on terror. By taking such a combative stance against drugs, Killer Mike points out that Reagan basically armed the police with the authority to do whatever they want to rid the problem of drugs. By anything, he means that the police would disregard basic American rights:\n\nAnd lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers\n\nThey boots was on our head, they dogs was on our crotches\n\nAnd they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches\n\nWhile this seems like a social justice argument, Killer Mike links it to a very intelligent economic argument where he talks about the prison-industrial complex. With such a high inmate population, Killer Mike argues that prisons are a form of modern slavery:\n\nBut thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits\n\nCause free labor is the cornerstone of US economics\n\nCause slavery was abolished, unless you are in prison\n\nTo conclude, Killer Mike says that he doesn’t hate Reagan himself, but all politicians. In Killer Mike’s eyes, politicians don’t represent the people, but really represent the influential people in the bureaucracy. Specifically, Killer Mike takes issue with oil lobbyist that influenced politicians into getting into costly wars:\n\nWhy did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi\n\nWe invaded sovereign soil, going after oil\n\nTaking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby\n\nBy also including Obama in his argument, Killer Mike closes the door on any arguments that would arrive about him having a bias based on race or political party since he is attacking a black and white man and a Democrat and Republican.\n\nThe sophistication of lyrics can sometimes be lost in rap because of how fast the lyrics come at you. However, if we were to slow down songs like this one, very intelligent and well thought out opinions about political and apolitical issues can be found."
