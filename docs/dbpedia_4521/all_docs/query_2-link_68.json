        "text": "Snoop Dogg is completing another side mission in life when he joins NBC as part of the coverage slated for the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics. While breakdancing is now an Olympic sport, rapping won’t be at the Olympic Games in Paris. However, if there were a team for rap at the Games, Snoop Dogg knows the three hip-hop legends he’d be taking with him to represent the United States.\n\n“Definitely would take Eminem,” Snoop tells Billboard on a Wednesday morning (July 24) conference call from Paris. “Gotta have that global experience. I definitely would take Rakim. Old school. Then I would go grab a female. I’d go grab Queen Latifah. Just so that way, I got some royalty. Then, naturally, I gotta take Snoop Dogg. Come on, man. What are we talking about? I mean, dream team. Let’s go.”\n\nWith Snoop joined by Rakim, Eminem and Queen Latifah, were rapping an actual Olympic sport, he’d be bringing quite the potent mix of rhyming icons with him as part of Team USA, with his picks boasting plenty of experience in the hip-hop realm.\n\nIt’s slated to be a very busy few weeks in France for Snoop Dogg once the Opening Ceremony kicks off the Olympic Games on Friday night (July 26). He’ll join NBC’s Mike Tirico as part of Primetime In Paris, which will provide wall-to-wall coverage of Olympic competitions, and will go behind the scenes with some of the world’s favorite athletes.\n\nSnoop Dogg will also be serving as a torchbearer at the 2024 Summer Olympics. The Death Row alum is set to carry the lit-up torch through the streets of Saint-Denis in northern Paris.\n\n“It says a lot about America as far as where we at in this world,” he said later in the call about having the torchbearer honor bestowed upon him. “I look at it as a prestigious honor. I would’ve never truly dreamed of something like this. I’ma be on my best behavior. I’ma be on my best athleticism. I’ll be able to breath slow, walk fast and have a smile on my face.”\n\nSnoop continued, “I’m thinking back to Muhammad Ali and when Muhammad Ali was holding it. It was emotional for all of us to see the champ holding that torch and walking it up there. That’s what it feels like to me. My own version of it.”"
