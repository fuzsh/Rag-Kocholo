        "text": "This article is about the American rapper and actor. For the fictional dog, see Snoopy.\n\nCalvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known professionally as Snoop Dogg,[note 1] is an American rapper and actor.[5] He became known as one of the popular gangsta rappers during the 1990s. Snoop Dogg has also appeared in many movies and television shows throughout his career.\n\nEarly life\n\n[change | change source]\n\nThe reason why he is called \"Snoop Dogg\" is because his mother nicknamed him after a character called \"Snoopy\". Snoop Dogg was a fan of the Peanuts cartoon, which has the Snoopy character. Snoop Dogg sang in his church choir and played piano as a child. Snoop Dogg's brother, Bing Worthington, was a bad influence for him. He began smoking when he was in the sixth grade. As a young adult, he was involved in gang activity. He was arrested, convicted and put in prison for possession of illegal drugs.\n\nMusical career\n\n[change | change source]\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Broadus performed under the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. He first appeared on Dr. Dre's first solo album, The Chronic, released in 1992. Later in 1993, Snoop Dogg released his first album Doggystyle. The album became successful.\n\nIn 1996, his second album, Tha Doggfather, was released. Although the album met with positive acclaim, it was not as successful as his first album.\n\nIn 2004, his album R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece was released and featured the hit single “Drop It Like It's Hot”. The single became Snoop Dogg's first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n2012–2013: Reincarnated\n\n[change | change source]\n\nIn 2012, Snoop Dogg went to Jamaica. He studied the Rastafari movement. He changed his name to Snoop Lion, after the Lion of Judah. This is a name from the tribe of Judah. It is sometimes used to describe Haile Selassie, who is worshipped by Rastafarians. Reincarnated, released in 2013, is his first reggae album.[6]\n\n2018-2022: Bible of Love and Super Bowl LVI\n\n[change | change source]\n\nIn 2018, Snoop Dogg released his first gospel album, Bible of Love. It features appearances from Patti LaBelle, Fred Hammond, Rance Allen, Charlie Wilson, and others. On February 13, 2022, Snoop Dogg performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show. Later, he released the album, BODR (Bacc on Death Row).\n\nStudio albums\n\nDoggystyle (1993)\n\nTha Doggfather (1996)\n\nDa Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998)\n\nNo Limit Top Dogg (1999)\n\nTha Last Meal (2000)\n\nPaid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002)\n\nR&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece (2004)\n\nTha Blue Carpet Treatment (2006)\n\nEgo Trippin' (2008)\n\nMalice n Wonderland (2009)\n\nDoggumentary (2011)\n\nReincarnated (2013)\n\nBush (2015)\n\nCoolaid (2016)\n\nNeva Left (2017)\n\nBible of Love (2018)\n\nI Wanna Thank Me (2019)\n\nFrom tha Streets 2 tha Suites (2021)\n\nThe Algorithm (2021)\n\nBODR (2022)\n\nCollaboration albums\n\nSnoop Dogg presents Tha Eastsidaz with Tha Eastsidaz (2000)\n\nDuces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way with Tha Eastsidaz (2001)\n\nThe Hard Way with 213 (2004)\n\nMac & Devin Go to High School with Wiz Khalifa (2011)\n\n7 Days of Funk with 7 Days of Funk (2013)\n\nRoyal Fam with Tha Broadus Boyz (2013)[7]\n\nCuzznz with Daz Dillinger (2016)\n\nSee the main article: Snoop Dogg filmography\n\nFilms Year Title Role Notes 1994 Murder Was the Case: The Movie Himself Main role 1996 A Thin Line Between Love and Hate Himself Cameo 1998 Half Baked Scavenger Smoker 1998 Ride Mente 1999 Urban Menace Preacher Caleb Main role 1999 Whiteboyz Himself Cameo 1999 Hot Boyz C-Dawg 2000 The Wrecking Crew Dra-Man Main role 2000 Up in Smoke Tour Himself Concert film 2001 Training Day Blue 2001 Baby Boy Rodney 2001 Bones Jimmy Bones Main role 2001 The Wash Dee Loc Main role 2003 Old School Himself Cameo 2003 Malibu's Most Wanted Ronnie Rizzat Voice role 2003 Bigg Snoop Dogg: Raw 'N Uncut Vol. 1[8] Himself Main role 2004 Starsky & Hutch Huggy Bear Brown 2004 Soul Plane Captain Antoine Mack 2005 Racing Stripes Lightning Voice role 2005 The Tenants Willie Spearmint Main role 2005 Boss'n Up Corde Christopher Main role 2007 Arthur and the Invisibles Max Voice role 2008 Singh Is Kinng Himself Bollywood movie 2009 Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder Himself Voice role 2009 Falling Up Raul 2009 Brüno Himself 2009 Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard Max Voice role 2011 The Big Bang Puss 2012 We the Party Big D 2012 Mac & Devin Go to High School Mac Johnson Main role 2013 Turbo Smooth Move Voice role 2013 Reincarnated Himself Documentary 2013 Scary Movie 5 Ja'Marcus 2014 The Distortion of Sound Himself 2015 Pitch Perfect 2 Himself 2015 The Culture High Himself 2016 Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping Himself 2017 Grow House Himself 2018 Future World Love Lord 2019 The Beach Bum Lingerie 2019 Trouble Snoop Voice role 2019 Dolemite Is My Name Roj 2019 The Addams Family Cousin Itt Voice role 2020 Unbelievable!!!!!
