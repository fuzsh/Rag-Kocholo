        "text": "Rapper Snoop Dogg is the real jack of all trades and constantly pushes the envelope regarding his career. This year, he is a special correspondent for NBC at the 2024 Paris Olympics and simultaneously took on grandpa duties amidst all the frenzy and fun.\n\nThe rapper shared an image of himself tying his granddaughter Cordoba’s shoelaces. Cordoba is Snoop Dogg’s son Cordell Broadus’ daughter; Cordell was also present at the Olympics alongside his longtime girlfriend, Phia Barragan.\n\n“Grandpas duties while at the Olympics,” the 52-year-old captioned the image with his five-year-old granddaughter.\n\nCordell also posted footage from their family time in Paris. The images included himself, Snoop, and Cordoba posing with tennis rackets and playing the sport.\n\n“Tennis with Grandpa in Paris it’s a blessing to be able 2 bring her around the world,” Cordell wrote in the caption.\n\nThis isn’t the “Drop It Like It’s Hot” rapper’s only grandchild–he has six others. They include Zion, Elleven, Kai, Sky, Chateau and baby Broadus.\n\nSnoop takes being a grandfather seriously, and his relationship with his own grandfather may have partially influenced his dedication.\n\nDuring a chat with PEOPLE, the artist said, “My grandpa was my best friend and for me to be that for my grandkids is showing that I actually did well.”\n\nThe television personality continued, “My grandkids are my everything, because they all individually get a piece of my heart and they’re different,” he said.\n\nAside from Cordell, the record producer has three other children, including Corde, his only daughter, Cori, and son Julian from a previous relationship. Snoop Dogg presents as a family man and has been raising his children with his longtime wife, Shante Broadus. The couple got married in June 1997, and they’ve been low-key and focused on building their empire since."
