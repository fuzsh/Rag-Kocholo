I worked my way to the top,‚Äù Worthington told Vice in 2016.\n\n‚ÄúEven though I‚Äôm [Snoop‚Äôs] brother he didn‚Äôt give me a top-ranked position. You can‚Äôt just become a president without knowing anything about being the president,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúYou have to learn.‚Äù\n\nWorthington also told the outlet that his career included doing ‚Äúa lot of entrepreneur s‚Äìt,‚Äù including Snoop‚Äôs 1966 Cadillac DeVille and Dogg Skateboards.\n\n‚ÄúYou name it. I come up with a lot of great concepts,‚Äù Worthington said.\n\nWorthington also had his own music group, Lifestyle. Their song ‚ÄúTha Jump Off‚Äù appeared in the 2006 rom-com ‚ÄúVan Wilder 2.‚Äù\n\nSome of Snoop‚Äôs famous friends showed their support for the rapper in the Instagram comments.\n\n‚ÄúMy condolences, bro,‚Äù rapper and producer D-Nice wrote.\n\nTyrese Gibson added, ‚Äúüôè stay strong big bro‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sorry this happened‚Ä¶.. Prayers love and light to you and your family‚Ä¶..‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSorry for all your Loss Brother,‚Äù Tamar Braxton added.\n\nTyrese commented, ‚Äústay strong big bro‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sorry this happened‚Ä¶.. Prayers love and light to you and your family‚Ä¶..‚Äù"
