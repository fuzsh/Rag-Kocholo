        "text": "Per Good Morning America, Cordoba is the daughter of Snoop Dogg’s son Cordell Broadus. Cordell also shared a series of photos and videos to Instagram and X in support of his father, who carried the torch at the 2024 Paris Olympics and who has been reporting from the Games as NBC’s special correspondent.\n\n“Medici Family @ the opening ceremony Daddy O accomplished another side mission the game is to be sold not told … 3 letters DNA” he wrote in his IG caption.\n\nHere’s what we know about Snoop Dogg’s supportive son:\n\nWho are Cordell Broadus’ parents?\n\nCordell was born on February 21, 1997, making him 27 years old.\n\nHe has three siblings\n\nHe played American football in high school\n\nAccording to People, Cordell grew up playing American football in high school and continued to pursue the sport when he joined UCLA. At one point he was ranked 130th on ESPN’s top-300 recruit list. However, his coach later confirmed that he had quit the sport, as he wanted to go down a more creative path. “Cordell informed me that he has decided to pursue other passions in his life – in particular his love of film through his company Film School Productions,” his former UCLA coach Jim Mora shared in a statement at the time, per the Los Angeles Times.\n\n“My mind has always been creative and I just felt like in 2014, 2015, there was a lack of representation of people who look like me in the creative world. I just was tired of wishing for somebody to do it and I put that on myself to do it,” Broadus told WWD in 2020.\n\nHe has a film production company …\n\nBroadus went on to start his own film production company, Film School Productions, and is now focused on working as a director, per People. According to WWD, he has worked on film projects for Dior and Kangol. He told the publication in 2020 that he was working on a documentary called Son of Kings, which “follows my family’s lineage and the journey of a Black man in America”.\n\n… and a music label\n\nBesides film, Broadus also has a passion for music, much like his father. Per People, he runs a record label called Real Queen Sound, and released his single “Bron and Bronny” with his famous dad.\n\nHe’s a model\n\nHe shares 2 children with his long-time girlfriend\n\nBroadus is a family man too. According to People, he shares two daughters – Cordoba and Chateau – with his wife Phia Barragan."
