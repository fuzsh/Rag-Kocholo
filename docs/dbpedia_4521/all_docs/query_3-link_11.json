        "text": "Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg's unlikely friendship has lasted more than 15 years.\n\nThe famous duo first met back in 2008 when Snoop joined Stewart to make mashed potatoes on her cooking show, The Martha Stewart Show. The rapper returned the next year to make brownies, and the new friends joked about \"the most important part\" of that recipe.\n\nSince their cooking and baking days on Stewart's show, the pair have gone on to work together as roasters on Comedy Central's 2015 Justin Bieber Roast, co-hosts of the 2021 and 2022 Puppy Bowls and costars in various Sketchers commercials. They've also teamed up to co-host a VH1 celebrity cooking show, Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party, and judge a Halloween food competition, Snoop and Martha's Very Tasty Halloween.\n\n\"When you work with someone like Snoop, it's like having a sidekick. How great it is,\" Stewart once told PEOPLE. \"That's why all the comedians have sidekicks and bands because it loosens them up and lets them be freer. Snoop is my freedom.\"\n\nIn 2016, Snoop told The Hollywood Reporter that Stewart is his \"homegirl\" and that they \"have a special bond that goes way back.\"\n\nFrom baking brownies and cookies together to their various co-hosting adventures, here's everything to know about Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg's friendship.\n\nNovember 2008: Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg meet on her cooking show\n\nStewart and Snoop's friendship began with her mother's mashed potato recipe. The rapper appeared on the author's self-titled daytime cooking show, and the two enjoyed each other's company while peeling potatoes and discussing his signature vocabulary words like \"foshizzle.\" Snoop joked on the show, \"I don't even understand it. I just have fun.\"\n\n\"What an odd couple we were,\" Stewart remarked years later during a 2019 NBC News interview about their first meeting. Snoop added that \"cooking with Martha just seemed like the right space to be in.\"\n\nDecember 2009: Snoop Dogg returns to Martha Stewart's show to make brownies\n\nSnoop returned to the show the next year for a special Christmas episode. This time, the new friends made green-colored brownies — Snoop joked that he wanted to make green brownies because they're \"environmental.\"\n\nHe continued with the low-key innuendos, not outright saying that he wanted to add marijuana to the brownies — the special ingredient he is infamous for — but seemingly implying it. After prompting from Stewart, in a freestyle rap, he added that they were \"missing the most important part of the brownies,\" making the audience chuckle more. Stewart quipped that they'd add \"the stuff\" later.\n\nNovember 30, 2010: Snoop Dogg asks Martha Stewart for \"goodies\" on Twitter\n\nSnoop had some interaction with his new friend online in November 2010, jokingly tweeting that he and Stewart should make the special brownies again.\n\n\"@marthastewart hi sunshine. need some goodies for Prince Williams bachelor party. i got the tracc #WET u get the snacks @clarencehouse,\" he tweeted.\n\nNovember 19, 2014: Snoop Dogg credits Martha Stewart with inspiring his candle line\n\nThough they hadn't communicated publicly in some time, Snoop was still drawing inspiration from his meetings with Stewart. When he released his candle line in 2014, he tweeted that she deserved some credit for his creative ideas.\n\n\"S/o to @MarthaStewart inspiration for my #broadusfamilycollection premium candles on http://tilt.LT/candles2,\" Snoop tweeted alongside a photo of one of his candles.\n\nMarch 30, 2015: Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg roast Justin Bieber on Comedy Central\n\nStewart and Snoop finally had their big reunion in 2015. The pair were part of a line-up of several A-list celebrities who joined the Comedy Central roast of Justin Bieber hosted by Kevin Hart.\n\nIn addition to roasting Bieber, the businesswoman also poked fun at her friend Snoop during the special. \"Snoop, I see that you have been following my beauty regimen,\" she said. \"You would never know that Snoop Dogg is 43 now, which is three times as long as actual dogs live and twice as long as most of his friends.\"\n\nIn their 2019 NBC News interview, Snoop recalled of the roast: \"She sat next to me, and she stole the show. She was the funniest roaster that night.\"\n\nHe added, \"In that moment I knew I wanted to be alongside this lady for the rest of my life.\"\n\nJune 16, 2015: Martha Stewart tells Seth Meyers she got high from being near Snoop Dogg\n\nA few months after her and Snoop's appearance on the Justin Bieber Roast, Stewart joined Seth Meyers on Late Night with Seth Meyers, where she shared that she felt the effects of being near Snoop during the event.\n\n\"I got high just sitting there,\" she told the host. \"Snoop had all those, you don't call them joints, you call them something else. Big fat ones. We had to sit on the stage for four hours, and the secondary smoke is just as powerful as primary smoke. So I was totally high by the time I got to that microphone.\"\n\nJuly 10, 2016: Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg compete on $100,000 Pyramid\n\nThe following year, Stewart and Snoop joined ABC's revival of $100,000 Pyramid as a team, and they nailed the word association practice round on the game show.\n\nThe rapper had no problem working out Stewart's hints and guessing words and terms like \"weed,\" \"fatty\" and \"420\" in under 40 seconds.\n\nSeptember 14, 2016: Snoop Dogg says he's \"never met someone\" like Martha Stewart\n\nDuring a Rolling Stone interview, Snoop opened up about his long-lasting friendship with Stewart ahead of the release of season 1 of Martha and Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party.\n\n\"I've never met anyone like Martha Stewart,\" he said. \"When we come together, it's a natural combination of love, peace and harmony.\"\n\nOctober 26, 2016: Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg play \"Never Have I Ever\" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n\nDuring a joint appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Stewart and Snoop played a round of \"Never Have I Ever\" with Anna Kendrick and Ellen DeGeneres. Both revealed that they've sexted, been to a nude beach and used their fame to get out of trouble before.\n\nSnoop also admitted that he's been in handcuffs, been stoned on a talk show and returned something to the store after already wearing it.\n\nNovember 7, 2016: Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg co-host a celebrity cooking show\n\nEight years after Snoop's first appearance on Stewart's show, the duo teamed up again for a VH1 series called Martha & Snoop's Potluck DinnerParty, where they hosted celebrity friends for \"cocktails, cooking, conversation, and where nothing is off-limits,\" according to a press release announcing the show.\n\n\"At our dinner party, we will exemplify America's fascination with food, entertaining and celebrity,\" Stewart said. \"Martha & Snoop's Dinner Party will redesign the traditional food competition shows in a new, different and very funny way.\"\n\nSnoop added, \"My homegirl, Martha and I have a special bond that goes back. We're gonna be cooking, drinking and having a good time with our exclusive friends. Can't wait for you to see how we roll together!\"\n\nCelebrities like Bella Thorne, Jason Derulo, Wiz Khalifa and Kathy Griffin have all been guests on the show.\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE on their relationship, Stewart revealed one thing she's taken away from working with Snoop.\n\n\"I've learned a new vocabulary,\" she said. \"I have a little dictionary — I might actually write the dictionary. It's all those fo' shizzles and everything else.\"\n\nOctober 23, 2018: Martha Stewart writes a foreword for Snoop Dogg's cookbook\n\nWhen Snoop published his own cookbook, From Crook to Cook: Platinum Recipes From Tha Boss Dogg's Kitchen, his old friend contributed a foreword.\n\nStewart wrote, \"Snoop and I have a special bond that dates back to when he first appeared on The Martha Stewart Show in 2008. Our relationship was born from our connection to food as we whipped up some cognac mashed potatoes and green brownies.\"\n\n\"Working with Snoop in the kitchen has been a remarkable experience for me,\" she continued. \"Not only has he taught me new lingo and cultural references, he surprised me with his unique cooking techniques and recipes.\"\n\nMarch 25, 2019: Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg co-host the spinoff of their cooking show\n\nIn a Titanic-themed trailer, per Billboard, Stewart holds Snoop from behind as he spreads his arms — reminiscent of Jack and Rose in their iconic scene as Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\" plays in the background.\n\nThe commercial announced the spinoff of their VH1 cooking series, Martha & Snoop's Potluck Party Challenge, the first episode of which aired on April 3, 2019. For this iteration of the show, Snoop and Stewart competed with famous friends to make the best dish, and celebrity judges chose the winners.\n\nAugust 1, 2020: Martha Stewart shows Snoop Dogg how to pot a tomato plant\n\nStewart called up Snoop during an episode of her HGTV show, Martha Knows Best, and walked him through the steps of potting his tomato plant, per USA Today. \"You have planted things before, Snoop.

I want this to be one for the history books, you understand me?\" he continues. \"I want dozens and dozens of treats. I want a fortress of fondant. Everything I do has to be big! ...
