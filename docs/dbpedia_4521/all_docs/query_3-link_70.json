        "text": "Snoop Dogg‘s latest side quest, the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, has proven to be an unforgettable one, not only for the legendary rapper but also for fans across the United States.\n\nThe “Drop It Like It’s Hot” artist, who’s been in Paris helping NBC with its primetime coverage, could arguably be Team USA’s biggest fan. He’s gone from carrying the Olympic Torch to cheering on the women’s gymnastics team in the stands to learning how to fence and more.\n\nSince the Olympics officially got underway on July 26, people have taken to social media to share their reactions to Snoop Dogg’s presence in Paris — and it’s been nothing but positive, to say the least. Some fans have even praised NBC for bringing the rapper back to help with coverage, notably after his and Kevin Hart’s Olympic Highlights show for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nOne of Snoop Dogg’s most memorable moments from the Peacock show was his commentary on the horses during the Equestrian events. “Oh, that horse crip walking, cuz, you see that?,” the rapper said. “This horse is off the chain. I gotta get this motherfucker in a video. Oh my God!”\n\nBelow, The Hollywood Reporter rounds up some of Snoop Dogg’s most iconic moments from his trip to the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nSnoop Dogg Dancing With Olympic Gymnasts Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles\n\nThe rapper had to make sure Biles and Chiles, competing for Team USA’s women’s gymnastics, knew he was in the stands cheering them on during the qualification round. The two athletes spotted Snoop Dogg showing off his best moves and decided to join in from the floor.\n\nThe sweet moment caught on camera left Simone and Chiles glowing with huge smiles across their faces.\n\nSnoop Dogg Finally Getting His Meet-and-Greet With Horses at Olympic Dressage\n\nThe artist, alongside his longtime friend Martha Stewart, paid a visit to the horses on Saturday ahead of the Olympic dressage competition. Both were also sporting equestrian looks from head to toe.\n\nThough Snoop Dogg has admitted to having a fear of horses, the special moment came after his viral commentary from the 2020 Olympics, where he described the horses’ moves as “crip walking” during the Equestrian events.\n\nAfter taking a moment Saturday to vibe with the horses and feed them, the rapper also had some praise for the animal’s hair. “I like his braids. I can’t get over them. I’m going to use that hairstyle,” Snoop Dogg said. “Their hair game is exceptional.”\n\nSnoop Dogg and Michael Phelps Being the Next Fan-Favorite Duo\n\nSnoop Dogg isn’t just standing on the sidelines, but he’s also getting in on the action. The rapper teamed up with former star athlete Michael Phelps, who’s won 23 Olympic gold medals, to work on his swimming technique.\n\n“Me and MP, we go back like the backstroke,” Snoop Dogg quipped in the video before asking the superstar swimmer how someone can go fast in the pool. “You just described me. You said wingspan, lung power. I definitely have great lung power, and I do have a swimmer’s body. Look, our bodies are similar. Mike, we could be twins.”\n\nThe rapper proceeded to show off his (interesting) water skills, however, he likely won’t be competing in the Olympic swimming events anytime soon.\n\n“Mike, you make this look too easy, oh God. As you see, I’m in gold medal condition and he’s still in gold medal condition,” a tried Snoop Dogg added in the clip. “As we speak, shout out to the Phelps family and to the team that’s going to give me some oxygen right now.”\n\nSnoop Dogg Crip Walking While Carrying Olympic Torch\n\nThe “Gin and Juice” artist got the opportunity to carry the Paris Olympic Torch for a moment, and he made sure to do it in Snoop Dogg style. The rapper was seen with a big smile as he walked, and at times crip walked, down the streets of Paris with the torch in hand.\n\n“It’s too hard to put in words, baby,” he told NBC of the special moment. “I mean, the D.O. Double was holding the torch, walking through the city, man. I felt like [boxer] Muhammad Ali. It was extraordinary. It was excellent. And I found out that when you hold the torch, you a peace messenger. So I really felt good about that.”\n\nSnoop Dogg Goes Snooping Around the Louvre\n\nThe rapper definitely wasn’t going to miss the chance to take a private tour of the Louvre, a national art museum in Paris. “You ever seen Night at the Museum?” he asked. “Well, tonight you get to go in the museum with Snoop Dogg, and we’re going to be snooping around.”\n\nHe got to see several famous pieces of art, including “The Winged Victory of Samothrace” and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa,” as well as provided some top-tier commentary.\n\n“I just found out I was Mona Lisa’s twin brother, Tony Lisa,” Snoop Dogg joked. “She smiles real hard when I stand on this side.”\n\nSnoop Dogg Getting a Taste of Different Olympic Sports\n\nThroughout his first week in Paris, Snoop Dogg tried his hands at numerous Olympic sports, learning from the best of the best. He was seen going from fencing to weightlifting as well as judo to showcasing his speed on track and field. The question remaining: What sport is up next for the rapper?\n\nSnoop Dogg Teaming Up With Cookie Monster to Surprise Martha Stewart\n\nThe rapper not only got to reunite with Martha Stewart, who he’s been friends with since 2008, at the Paris Olympics, but he also got to partner with the Cookie Monster to surprise her for her birthday.\n\n“Happy birthday, Martha! Me brought you a birthday cake,” the lovable legend said in the video before presenting Stewart with a giant macaron tower. “You’re going to love it. It’s all cookies.”\n\nSnoop Dogg also admitted he’s “the biggest Cookie Monster fan in the world. Man, I can’t believe Cookie is right next to me. Is that the real Cookie Monster? Oh, wow!”\n\nSnoop Dogg Learning How to Call “Gooooooooooool!” From Andrés Cantor\n\nDuring the halftime of the women’s quarterfinal match between Team USA and Japan, the rapper joined Andrés Cantor as he was broadcasting on Telemundo. He explained that it was his first Olympic soccer match and he wanted to “show some support to all of the ladies that’s playing soccer.” He also told Cantor that he was a “big fan” of his. Speaking further on the Olympics, the rapper said his favorite part has been the “love and the peace and the unity” between the countries. “We need more peace, love and unity,” he said.\n\nCanto then taught Snoop how to yell his infamous “Goooooooool!” “Boy, you gotta hold that thing,” Snoop quipped after they practiced. “He know how to hold that thing too long.” Cantor then gifted Snoop with a his own custom Team USA jersey.\n\nAnd Snoop Dogg Just Being Snoop Dogg…\n\nOverall, the beloved rapper has clearly been having the time of his life at the Paris Olympics, from cheering in the stands during competitions to sharing sweet moments with athletes to giving some of the best commentary on events. And this all made for many unforgettable moments caught on camera.\n\n“I’ve been out here working the Olympics, talking to the athletes, to families and meeting the people and kissing the babies, and doing the things that I do to politically stay correct,” he told NBC. “And just being Snoop Dogg. That’s what I know how to do the best.”\n\nLexy Perez contributed to this story."
