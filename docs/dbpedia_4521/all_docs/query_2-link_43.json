        "text": "It’s a “Doggy Dogg World,” and Snoop Dogg’s in charge.\n\nThe rapper dove into the role of special correspondent for the 2024 Paris Olympics, and it’s safe to say he’s won gold with his Team USA looks and commentary.\n\nAnd that started even before the games officially began when he carried the Olympic torch through the streets of Sain-Denis as one of the final torchbearers ahead of the Opening Ceremony. Though in this circumstance, he made sure to not, as his iconic song states, “drop it like it’s hot” while carrying the famous flame alongside actress Laetitia Casta and rapper MC Solaar.\n\n\"I felt like Muhammad Ali,\" he told NBC News after the ceremony. \"I found out that when you hold the torch, you're a peace messenger.\"\n\n\"I was waving, shaking hands, kissing the babies—doing what I do, you understand me,” Snoop continued. “Putting my foot in the pavement, letting the people know that we're here. We're here for peace, love, unity and great sportsmanship.\""
