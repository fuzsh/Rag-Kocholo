        "text": "Throughout his decades in the music business, Snoop Dogg has shown love for music genres across the spectrum. From his hip-hop start with the Billboard 200 No. 1 album Doggystyle to charting on the Gospel and reggae charts, Snoop has proven himself to be a multifaceted music star. While the Korean pop scene may not seem like an obvious connection for Snoop Dogg, the rapper has been mixing it up with K-pop artists for more than a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, Snoop told viewers on American Song Contest that “K-pop is my guilty pleasure” while he hosted the NBC singing competition alongside Kelly Clarkson. From teaming up with girl groups like Girls’ Generation and 2NE1 in the ’00s to sharing his expertise with Korean rappers like WINNER’s Mino, Basick and Superbee, Snoop has continuously lent his talents and showed love to this “guilty pleasure.”\n\nSnoop’s latest step alongside the Korean music scene is teaming up with BTS members Jin, V, Jimin and Jung Kook for a new collaboration alongside Benny Blanco. The superstar single “Bad Decisions” debuts at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 this week, giving Snoop his 12th top 10 single to date. The feat also makes the Dogg Father the third artist to earn top 10 singles in each of the past four decades — the ’90s, ’00s, ’10s and ’20s — joining Mariah Carey and Jay-Z.\n\nTeaming up with BTS not only helped Snoop Dogg extend his ever-growing, historic chart run, but continued his ongoing professional and creative relationship with K-pop. This is Snoop’s K-pop history, proving he’s been an OG fan even before the scene blew up worldwide."
