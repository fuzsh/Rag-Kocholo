Having Shante, my kids, and my grandbabies part of this holiday campaign is nothing short of incredible,” the Death Row Records owner said, before admitting, “Not gonna lie, the shoot got me feelin’ [sic] festive and fly.\"\n\nIn some shots, they all gathered around the dinner table for an elegant meal as the music icon cut the turkey, while in others, they posed cheerfully around a grand Christmas tree, fireplace ablaze nearby.\n\nSnoop Dogg and family holiday shots\n\nThe Children's Place\n\nThe dad-of-four also has an additional son, Julian Corrie Broadus, from a previous relationship, who was not captured in the images.\n\nWe're not sure about anyone else, but this definitely got us ready to welcome the holiday spirit with open arms!"
