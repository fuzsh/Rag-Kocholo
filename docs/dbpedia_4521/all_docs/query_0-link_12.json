The TV personality and rapper is set to entertain devoted fans across the country, and continue the well-deserved hype he earned after his epic performance at this year's Super Bowl Halftime Show!\n\nBorn Calvin Broadus, Snoop has been dropping it like it's hot since the early 90s when he hooked up with Dr. Dre to work on a film theme, with his debut album following shortly after. In this three-decade career, he's released 19 studio albums, collaborated on countless others, and won more music industry awards than you could count on your hands and toes. Don't miss a chance to catch this formidable artist live on-stage!\n\nDid you know?\n\nSnoop Dogg's full name is actually Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr."
