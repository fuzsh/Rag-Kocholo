        "text": "The Snoop apple doesn't fall far from the Snoop tree.\n\nRapper and entertainer Snoop Dogg just posted a throwback picture of himself with father, Vernell Varnado, and you can totally see the resemblance.\n\nIn the photo, which was taken at Snoop's 2018 Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony, Snoop stands with his arm around his dad, wearing a Gucci sweater and camel coat, while his father looks snappy in a light gray suit. \"Me and pops üî•üî•üíôüíô,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Pops looks just like you,\" wrote one commenter. \"Like father like son üî•\" added another.\n\nRELATED: Snoop Dogg Shares Precious Photo of His 3 Granddaughters in Matching Bows\n\nSnoop Dogg and his father Vernell Varando\n\nVarnado is a Vietnam War veteran who spent ten years as a mail carrier in Detroit. While the rapper, and former The Voice Mega Mentor, was raised primarily by his mother in Long Beach, California, he reconnected with his father as a young adult.\n\nIn an article for OC Weekly in 1999, Varnado admitted, ‚ÄúI didn't even much see Snoop until he was 12 years old.‚Äù\n\nHe fondly remembered when his son's hit \"Nuthin' But A G Thang\" came out, and how proud he was of his son's success. \"Man, that was like the national anthem,\" he recalled. \"I was out there delivering mail in Detroit, and everyone on my route was playing it, givin' me love because everybody knew I was Snoop's dad. It made me popular in Detroit. I mean, I'm a mailman, and my son is doin' this and doin' that?‚Äù Later, Varnado moved to Southern California to work on projects in the music business.\n\nRELATED: Martha Stewart Talks Entertaining Snoop Dogg and the Real Leonard Bernstein\n\nHe was always a fan of his son's work, telling Spin in 1993, just after Snoop had became famous on the hip-hop scene, \"Snoop was always extraordinary. I thought he was a genius. Even when he was like six or seven, if music came on, he‚Äôd jump up and dance and perform all the hand movements.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg and the Paris Olympics\n\nNext stop: Paris! Snoop Dogg was recently announced as a reporter for NBC's coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nRELATED: Get to Know Olympic Gymnast Simone Biles Ahead of the 2024 Summer Games\n\nIn a press release, he enthused, ‚ÄúI grew up watching the Olympics and am thrilled to see the incredible athletes bring their A-game to Paris. It‚Äôs a celebration of skill, dedication, and the pursuit of greatness. We‚Äôre going to have some amazing competitions and, of course, I will be bringing that Snoop style to the mix. It‚Äôs going to be the most epic Olympics ever, so stay tuned, and keep it locked. Let‚Äôs elevate, celebrate, and make these games unforgettable, smoke the competition, and may the best shine like gold. Peace and Olympic LOVE, ya dig?‚Äù\n\nWe so dig."
