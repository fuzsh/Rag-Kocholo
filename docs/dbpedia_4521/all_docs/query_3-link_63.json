        "text": "Few figures in music have remained as culturally relevant in present times as Snoop Dogg. The 52-year-old mogul still draws attention despite subsiding from the music industry — save for a couple feature verses here and there — over the past decade or so.\n\nDespite making his bones as a slick-tongued wordsmith who dovetailed Dr. Dre's synth-fueled production with impunity, Snoop's impact has long since eclipsed his musical skill. Rather, he's one of those celebrities who has transitioned into the mainstream seamlessly, collaborating with fellow luminaries like Martha Stewart, Owen Wilson, and, now, Noah Lyles.\n\nA relationship between the sprinting superstar — a 26-year-old from Alexandria, VA — and the rap supernova may seem unlikely at first glance. Based on clips that emerged on Sunday of the duo strutting into Hayward Field, a partnership has, indeed, taken place. Cultural diffusion is a very real thing, it seems.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Snoop and Lyles' budding relationship, one that has come to the surface during the 2024 U.S. Olympic Track and Field team trials.\n\nIs Noah Lyles related to Snoop Dogg?\n\nLyles and Snoop have no real ties, at least not at first glance, and he is not the rapper's \"nephew,\" at least not in the literal sense (more on that later). However, Snoop is a noted sports enthusiast, having graced a number of sporting surfaces, from the football field to the safe haven of the hardwood.\n\nHis delight at the prospect of witnessing sporting greatness has earned him the attention of corporations galore, including, most recently, NBC, who announced that Snoop Dogg was joining its coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics back in January.\n\n“Let’s elevate, celebrate, and make these games unforgettable, smoke the competition, and may the best shine like gold,” Snoop Dogg said in a release. “Peace and Olympic LOVE, ya dig?”\n\nAs part of his gig with the network, Snoop Dogg will offer musings to lead Olympic host Mike Tirico. He'll also go to Olympic events, chum it up with athletes, their friends and families, and venture to new sites within the French capital.\n\nSnoop has taken the role in stride since the start of Olympic trials. He met fellow American superstar Sha'Carri Richardson earlier in trials, much to her delight.\n\nAnd during Lyles' qualifying run for Sunday's 100m final, Snoop took to the concourses, spending time with Lyles' mother, Keisha Caine Bishop, and cheering for his \"nephew\" — a slang term for a youngster that Snoop has respect for.\n\nAll that amounts to a growing respect and admiration between the two stars. When that happens, sparks tend to fly. If Lyles secures Olympic qualification, expect that relationship to only continue to develop."
