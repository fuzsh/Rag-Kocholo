        "text": "Kurt Russell & Wyatt Russell\n\nAlmost everyone knows the iconic Kurt Russell, who made a name for himself as a child in Disney films before becoming an action star in blockbuster films. Although everyone knows Russell is married to actress Goldie Hawn, few are aware that he has another family connection in Hollywood.\n\nHis son, Wyatt Russell, who has yet to reach his father's star status, has made appearances in \"22 Jump Street\" and \"Overlord\".\n\nJonah Hill & Beanie Feldstein\n\nThere's something about Beanie Feldstein that reminds us of someone - but who could it be? Watching the budding actress onscreen ignited a nagging notion. It may have been the resemblance in performance and demeanor that she has to her older brother, Jonah Hill.\n\nJonah changed his last name for Hollywood, while Beanie decided to keep their family name. We wonder if we'll ever see the funny siblings act side by side!\n\nTom Hanks & Fred Rogers\n\nThe way Tom Hanks found out that he was related to the infamous Fred Rogers (Mr.Rogers) is one for the books. During a red carpet interview for the biopic \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\" the interviewer revealed to Hanks that, according to Ancestry.com, he was related to Rogers!\n\nMuch to his surprise, Hanks is a distant cousin of the beloved man that he portrayed in the film.\n\nPhil Collins & Lily Collins\n\nMusic and acting connections are everywhere in Hollywood. Phil Collins, the Grammy Award-winning musician, best known for hits like \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"Against All Odds,\" is the father of actress Lily Collins.\n\nLily has made a name for herself in Hollywood, acting in several notable projects including \"Mirror, Mirror,\" \"Okja,\" and \"Emily in Paris.\"\n\nDakota Johnson & Melanie Griffith\n\nFollowing in the famous footsteps of her parents, Dakota Johnson is taking Hollywood by storm. The daughter of Melanie Griffith and actor Don Johnson, Dakota, actually made her debut starring alongside her mother in the 1999 film, \"Crazy in Alabama,\" directed by her stepfather, Antonio Banderas.\n\nThe actress is most well known for her portrayal of Anastasia Steele in the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" films and her quirky sense of humor.\n\nShirley MacLaine & Warren Beatty\n\nImagine what family dinners must be like at Shirley MacLain's and Watten Beatty's homes. Actor Warren Beatty is MacLaine's younger brother.\n\nIn 2012, MacLaine accepted the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award. During her speech, she thanked her \"kid\" brother saying that he was \"the person she'd loved the longest on this planet.\"\n\nJulia Roberts & Emma Roberts\n\n\"Pretty Woman\" star Julia Roberts is \"American Horror Story\" alum Emma Roberts's aunt! Emma's father, Eric, is Julia's brother. Their family reunions are as happy as can be - Hollywood stardust is everywhere. If you need proof, you can just look at Julia's Instagram.\n\nOne of Hollywood's most glamorous leading ladies once posted a photo from a family game night - where her niece beat her in a Mahjong game!\n\nJenny McCarthy & Melissa McCarthy\n\nTalent and humor run in the family for these two comedians and actresses. Believe it or not, Jenny and Melissa McCarthy are cousins!\n\nJenny has stood up for Melissa when writer Rex Reed criticized the actress's weight. It's always good to have family in your corner, especially in show business.\n\nEmily Blunt & Stanley Tucci\n\nSometimes working on a film together means you're working with a future family member. We've heard of couples that have met on-set, but what about setting your sister up with your costar? After working on \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" Stanley Tucci met Emily Blunt's older sister, Felicity.\n\nThe actor and literary agent fell in love and married, which means that Emily and Stanley are in-laws and that the actress is Tucci's children's aunt.\n\nSteven Spielberg & Jessica Capshaw\n\nMost known for her role as Arizona Robbins on \"Grey's Anatomy\" - many don't know that Jessica Capshaw is the stepdaughter of the remarkable director, Steven Spielberg.\n\nSpielberg married Jessica's mother, Kate Capshaw, in 1991, and the two have been married ever since. Jessica even had a small role in one of Spielberg's films, \"Minority Report.\"\n\nEllen DeGeneres & Kate Middleton\n\nYes, you read that right - the talk show host and future Queen of England are distant cousins! The only thing that interests Ellen about her long-lost relatives is...Prince George - and we don't blame her. When she discovered the relation, she tried to leverage it toward meeting Prince George.\n\n\"I have a clothing line - I can give him clothes; I can make a special robe for him,\" she told a British tabloid. “I don’t know why they don’t want to get in good with me because I’m like a gravy train for that kid.”\n\nJami Belushi & Jim Belushi\n\nThe 20-year-old daughter of \"According to Jim\" star, Jim Belushi, seems to also have the showbiz gene. Jami or Jamison Bess Belushi took to acting, as well as singing and songwriting. Talk about a triple threat! It's not surprising since her father is multi-talented as well.\n\nIn a fun twist though – and while Jami is quite talented with music, she mentioned to media outlets that she wants to open a candy store!\n\nIreland Baldwin & Kim Basinger\n\nKim Basinger is undeniably a Hollywood staple. She's a singer, model, actress, and even a Bond girl. Kim is also mother to Ireland Baldwin, who she co-parents with fellow Hollywood A-lister, Alec Baldwin.\n\nIreland has put the gorgeous looks she inherited to good use. She now works as an actress and a model, but there is no doubt that it’ll take some time before she gains a repertoire that is comparable to those of her famous parents.\n\nStella McCartney, Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney\n\nWith her eponymous fashion line, Stella McCartney is undoubtedly more than just the daughter of former Beatles member Paul McCartney. Sure, the fact she’s linked to the famous Beatle has probably helped propel her career forward in some ways, but she's certainly made a name for herself in her own right. She even has the seal of approval from Anna Wintour, who is seated front row at her fashion shows.\n\nAlthough her dad may be one of the world's biggest musical legends, many think that Stella resembles her late mother, Linda. Like her mother, she is an avid animal rights activist. She often incorporates vegan materials in her clothing lines.\n\nJason Ritter & John Ritter\n\nWe love a strong father and son bond, especially in the (at times) harsh world of Hollywood. Most remember the late John Ritter from \"8 Simple Rules\" and \"Three’s a Company.\"\n\nJason, on the other hand, is more familiar to the younger generation from shows like \"The Event\" and \"Joan of Arcadia.\" We're confident that John would be very proud of his son's accomplishments.\n\nRobin Thicke & Alan Thicke\n\nAs soon as Robin Thick hit the Hollywood scene, people were wondering who he reminded them of. Well as soon as you catch his last name, it's undeniable, as he resembles his father, Alan Thicke. Alan was a famous actor, comedian, and game show host. His son, Robin, is a talented singer, songwriter, and record producer.\n\nIf Robin wants to know how he'll look as he ages, he can take a look at his rather dashing dad.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross & Diana Ross\n\nDiana Ross is an absolute legend. From iconic chart-topping tunes to a successful acting career, her star power is undeniable. We wouldn't be surprised if you still have a dance to her hits now and then, we certainly do! Anyway, the gorgeous diva has an equally charming and talented daughter - Tracee Ellis Ross.\n\nMaking her mark in showbiz, Tracee is not only a wonderful actress and personality but quite the fashionista. These days she works on comedy, acting, hosting, and directing, and has been the recipient of several awards!\n\nJoely Richardson & Vanessa Redgrave\n\nVanessa Redgrave CBE is an English actress of high regard, gracing the stage, screen, and television with her beauty and charm. In 2010 she received the BAFTA Fellowship and is a living legend. Her career began in the 60s as a darling of the theatre. She then went on to pursue film, with roles in \"Mission Impossible,\" \"Isadora,\" \"Julia,\" \"Camelot,\" and, \"Letters to Juliet.\"\n\nIt was with her first husband, Tony Richardson, that she had Natasha and Joely Richardson. Just placing Vanessa and Joely side by side, you can definitely see the similarities! Joely, like her mother, is in the acting game, with roles in \"Nip/Tuck\" and \"The Tudors.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston & John Aniston\n\nThe classic 90s sitcom \"Friends,\" shot a few unknowns to international stardom, and one of them is the brilliant Jennifer Aniston. Aside from her role as Rachel Green in \"Friends,\" she’s solidified herself as an A-list star with over 40 projects under her belt. Aside from that, she’s also the daughter of the late John Aniston.\n\nNow some of you may not be old enough to know what \"Days of Our Lives\" is, but for those of you who are, well yes, he played Victor Kiriakis! Small world, eh? And it seems that there’s something in the Aniston genes.\n\nCara Delevingne & Charles Delevingne\n\nThe stunning English supermodel Cara Delevingne was hand-plucked from the elite (yeah, her family is kind of a big deal) and signed to several renowned brands from a young age. With her thick eyebrows and gorgeous eyes, she emerged as one of the most promising models when she was a teen.\n\nNowadays, it is not uncommon to see her face plastered across billboards. Not to mention her outstanding acting ability! Her father is Charles Delevingne, a notable real estate developer in the UK. He’s got money, looks, and power. When he was young, he was referred to as “debs delight” – for the debutantes we imagine. That apple sure didn't fall far from the tree!\n\nRiley Keough & Lisa Marie Presley\n\nLisa Marie, daughter of Priscilla and the one and only Elvis Presley, followed in her parents’ footsteps, pursuing a career in music. She's also a model, and a producer, and the list will surely go on as she progresses in her career in entertainment.\n\nPresley's daughter, Riley, is also pursuing a career in show business quite successfully. With roles in film and TV, and modeling contracts with fashion giants like Dior and Dolce & Gabbana, she is proudly carrying on her family legacy.\n\nVictorie Franklin & Aretha Franklin\n\nThe late Aretha Franklin, also known as the Queen of soul, with over 75 million records sold worldwide and 18 Grammy awards stashed away, she’s certainly earned that title and more. Franklin will forever be remembered.\n\nHer granddaughter, Victorie, seems to have inherited some of her grandmother’s fantastic talent and is on the right path to stardom. When Aretha passed the whole world mourned, but there is a bright light of hope shining from Victorie, a budding musician. We're confident she’ll continue her grandmother’s legacy.\n\nMason Gooding & Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\nNow you might have seen Mason Gooding in \"Booksmart\" – playing the handsome, Nick. It seems that acting was natural for Gooding, not surprising as his father is none other than \"Jerry Maguire\" star Cuba Gooding Jr. The established actor has won an Academy Award and has three children with Sara Kapfer.\n\nUnlike other celeb children, Gooding went to college first, before joining the entertainment industry. We wish him all the best and hope to see him make more appearances on our screens!\n\nPrincess Eugenie & Sarah Ferguson\n\nAh, imagine waking up every morning and realizing that you are a member of the British royal bloodline. Well, for Princess Eugenie, daughter of Sarah Ferguson, that fantasy is a reality! Although the resemblance is uncanny, we often forget that Eugenie is Sarah's daughter.\n\nWhile her mother Sarah Ferguson separated from her former royal husband when Eugenie was just six, the mother and daughter have always had a powerful bond and relationship.\n\nPuma Sabti Curry & Erykah Badu\n\nErykah Badu certainly has something: a phenomenal voice. The neo-soul queen’s debut album Baduizm was so popular that it received a triple-platinum certification. Pretty amazing stuff. She’s got a few kids to spend those royalties on! It seems that her girls, Puma and Mars, have received some of their mom’s vocal talent!\n\nPuma, who’s recently become a teenager, sang for her mom’s birthday, and the video evidence was astounding. Erykah Badu shared the beautiful moment on her Instagram and was absolutely thrilled that her angel would be so sweet as to sing for her.\n\nGeorgia May Jagger & Jerry Hall\n\nWith that gorgeous gap tooth, Georgia May Jagger is undoubtedly the daughter of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger. However, she didn’t get all her looks from daddy-o. No, no, her mom is none other than iconic supermodel Jerry Hall.\n\nHer daughter has followed her down the runway, even modeling for brands like Miu Miu and Versace. As well as living up that model life, she’s also tried her hand at fashion design.\n\nWill, Jada, Jaden, & Willow Smith\n\nJaden and Willow Smith could easily have just relied on their family's fortune. Between their famous parents, Will Smith (if you couldn't tell) and Jada Pinkett-Smith, the siblings certainly didn't need to get a 9-5 job.\n\nWell lucky for us, the siblings are both artists in their own rights and continue to share their work with the world.\n\nGigi Hadid & Yolanda Hadid\n\nWith a mother like Yolanda Hadid, we're not surprised that Gigi Hadid has become one of the most successful and established supermodels in recent years. They say Gigi shares a striking resemblance with her mother when she was younger. So we know that Gigi will age like fine wine.\n\nGigi has walked for nearly every leading luxury brand, with an estimated net worth is $13 million, and she is one of the world’s highest-paid models in the fashion industry.\n\nTommy Lee & Brandon Lee\n\nThe drummer for iconic rock band Motley Crue, Tommy Lee, has a mini-me named Brandon Lee! He had Brandon with Baywatch star, Pamela Anderson. The pair married in 1995, just DAYS after the meeting. Yep.\n\nWith two equally wild and famous parents, it would make sense for Brandon to want to keep out of the limelight. In recent years, however, he has been making a name for himself, making his way onto the reality show, \"The Hills.\"\n\nMyles Murphy & Eddie Murphy\n\nEddie Murphy is another legend. Comedic genius, truly. For years he has managed to make even the toughest audience laugh heartily, and boy, do we love him for it. Roles like \"Dr. Doolittle,\" The \"Nutty Professor,\" oh, and of course, the hilarious \"Coming to America,\" as well as \"Shrek,\" have solidified his place in Hollywood and in movie history.\n\nDespite his humor and a big grin, it seems that Eddie Murphy has had some trouble in holding down a marriage. He’s had relationships, but sadly the majority of those have ended in divorce. He has five kids with Nicole Mitchell, and one of those is his son Myles Murphy. Myles took a different path from this father, and started a career in football!\n\nDan Levy & Eugene Levy\n\nIf there’s one stereotypical “dad” image that springs to mind, it’s automatically Eugene Levy. He shot to stardom after his role as Noah Levenstein in the cult-classic \"American Pie\" series.\n\nThe Canadian actor has had a prolific career, and is well known for his comedy scripts – so much so that he’s received a star on Canada’s own Walk of Fame! His son Dan, not only inherited his father's eyebrows but also his talent. Dan created and starred in the Emmy award-winning show \"Schitt's Creek.\" What made the show even more special is that Dan cast Eugene in his show to play his father!\n\nJohn David Washington & Denzel Washington\n\nDenzel’s son initially tried out to become a member of the NFL, as part of the St. Louis Rams, however, was unsuccessful. He didn’t initially plan to follow in his famous father’s footsteps; however, circumstances demanded that he give an alternate career path a shot. With a smile and acting chops like his father’s, it’s hardly a surprise that Hollywood has embraced him.\n\nIt's safe to say that any film this father-son duo appears in together will be a masterpiece!\n\nLouisa Gummer & Meryl Streep\n\nThe baby of the Streep girls, is Louisa Gummer, Meryl Streep’s youngest daughter. Just as gorgeous as her sisters and, of course, her mother, she decided to enter the fashion industry. With the connections to all the designers (who wouldn’t want Meryl Streep at their fashion show?), she’s worked for some of the biggest names and has made her mark in the fashion world.\n\nLouisa signed with IMG Models in New York and has shot campaigns for Dior as well as appearing in high-profile magazine publications like \"Vanity Fair\" and \"Glamour.\"\n\nGrace Gummer & Meryl Streep\n\nThe second daughter of Don Gummer and Meryl Streep is the gorgeous Grace Gummer. With a resemblance that makes you immediately realize that they’re mother and daughter, Grace seems to also have taken to acting.\n\nGaining her degree from her mother’s alma mater, Vassar College, Grace went to the stage, and has even performed on Broadway! It seems that the apple indeed doesn’t fall too far from the tree!\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch & Wanda Ventham\n\nSurprisingly, this leading lady is the mother of a son who is arguably even more famous than she is! The English actress Wanda Ventham is best known for her role as Colonel Virginia Lake in the 1970s sci-fi series: \"UFO.\"\n\nIn 2014, People magazine even gave her a shout-out, featuring her in its “Most Beautiful People in the World” edition. No wonder her son Benedict Cumberbatch is a famous actor – we know exactly where he got those gorgeous eyes from! Even better news for him is that he is not only handsome but extremely talented. We absolutely adored him as Doctor Strange in the \"Avengers\" franchise, as well as none other than the magnetic \"Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\nScott Eastwood & Clint Eastwood\n\n\"Dirty Harry\" has to be one of the most iconic films ever made – particularly when it comes to a suave, badass detective played by Clint Eastwood. The famed actor and director is just one of those Hollywood legends, one who commands silence when entering a room.\n\nNot because he wants it, but because it’s the only reaction we mere mortals can fathom. Yep, he’s got his son, Scott, who does bear a striking resemblance and has become an actor in Hollywood in his own right.\n\nRashida Jones & Quincy Jones\n\nGosh, we love Rashida Jones. She’s gorgeous and funny, as well as a wonderful actress. With her husky voice and beautiful eyes, it’s no wonder Hollywood adores her. Her father is none other than the iconic record producer Quincy Jones. Yes, the legend himself is the father of Rashida! The myth, the man, is behind tracks like “Just Once” and “Soul Bossa Nova.” (Austin Powers fans, we got you).\n\nRashida got her start on \"I Love You, Man,\" and seems to have a penchant for comedy, landing a starring role in the hilarious \"Parks and Recreation.\" She’s made quite a name for herself and has graced many red carpets. With her talent and drive, she’s managed to hit the big time, just like her dad.\n\nEva Amurri Martino & Susan Sarandon\n\nAmerican actress Susan Sarandon has had an incredible career in Hollywood, known for her titanium talent. Best remembered for her iconic roles in \"Thelma & Louise\" and\" The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" these days she is still making headlines, after being arrested for participating in political protests. What a woman!\n\nSusan's daughter, Eva, had a role in the 2002 flick, \"The Banger Sisters,\" in which her mother starred, obviously portraying the daughter of her mother's character. She has since guest-starred in many television shows and movies, establishing herself in Hollywood.\n\nMaya Hawke & Uma Thurman\n\nUma Thurman turned into an absolute Hollywood heavyweight after her performances in \"Pulp Fiction\" and the \"Kill Bill\" series. However, before she took her first steps towards a career in acting, she was already a successful model, having taken the catwalk by storm. As for her daughter, Maya Thurman-Hawke, Holywood seems to be her haven too.\n\nShe's landed roles in \"Stranger Things\" and the BBC mini-series \"Little Women.\" With talent like hers, Maya will soon be so famous that a remarkable portfolio is undoubtedly going to be in her future.\n\nLiza Minelli & Judy Garland\n\nJudy Garland is one of those icons who will never be forgotten. \"The Wizard of Oz\" is arguably one of her most famous films, and her acting and singing talents were surely passed on to her daughter Liza Minelli.\n\nLiza Minelli started out as a nightclub singer, favoring cabaret and jazz styles, which were the perfect segue into the role which would garner her an Academy Award for Best Actress. Remember the 1972 hit, \"Cabaret\"?! With her rich and soulful voice, Minelli captivated audiences, and today is a legend in her own right.\n\nMary-Kate, Ashley Olsen, & Elizabeth Olsen\n\nEveryone who’s anyone knows of the famous twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, also known as the Olsen Twins, who mostly made their name by starring together in various TV shows and films. They were most popular in their youth, but eventually retired as actresses and now focus on fashion design. They are members of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.\n\nMany people don't know that Elizabeth Olsen is their sister. She too is a popular actress and gained worldwide recognition for her role as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch in the iconic \"Avengers\" films and the \"Wandavision\" series.\n\nMatt Dillon & Kevin Dillon\n\nMatt and Kevin Dillon are both successful actors in Hollywood, and we're always surprised when we remember they are brothers. The two have appeared in various manly films and shows. Kevin is mostly known for his roles as Bunny in the war film \"Platoon\" and, of course, Johnny \"Drama\" Chase on the HBO comedy series \"Entourage.\" Matt first appeared in the film \"Over the Edge\" in 1979, and he also went on to become a director with 2002's \"City of Ghosts.\"\n\nHere we can see the handsome brothers during a night out together.\n\nBen Affleck & Casey Affleck\n\nBen Affleck has been acting and directing films for many decades now, and has starred in Hollywood from a very young age. The actor appeared in some of the most popular movies of all time, and gained a reputation as a solid performer, both for critics and in terms of box-office revenue. He earned himself an academy word for screen-writing the film \"Good Will Hunting.\"\n\nNot to be outdone by his brother, Casey Affleck also nabbed an Academy Award for his role in \"Manchester By the Sea.\"\n\nAriana Grande & Frankie Grande\n\nWith over 165 million Instagram followers and almost 15 billion total YouTube views, Ariana Grande is truly a powerhouse in the entertainment industry. She's a multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, and actress, and is often compared to Mariah Carey in her musical style. She received various awards, including a Grammy, a Brit Award, three American Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, and several Guinness World Records. All of her albums have reached platinum or better by the RIAA.\n\nAriana's brother, Frankie Grande, is a famous dancer, actor, singer, producer, TV host, and YouTube influencer. He appeared as Franz in the musical \"Rock of Ages\" and was the judge on the 2015 season of \"America's Best Dance Crew.\"\n\nMiley Cyrus & Noah Cyrus\n\nMiley Cyrus started her entertainment career as one of Disney’s famous child stars on \"Hannah Montana,\" before turning rogue and completely dismissing the good-girl image in favor of the “I don’t care about any of you” facade. Miley decided to go all-out in her acting and singing career, sometimes getting a little risque.\n\nMiley and Noah Cyrus are the daughters of famous country singer Billy Ray Cyrus and actress Tish Cyrus. Noah is also a sensational songstress. It seems that entertaining is in their blood.\n\nCharlie Sheen & Emilio Estevez\n\nCharlie Sheen is quite a controversial character in Hollywood. On the one hand, the guy is a charismatic and manly actor. He played in lots of successful films and TV shows, from the severe and dramatic \"Platoon,\" which was about Vietnam soldiers, and the financial drama \"Wall-Street,\" up to “Two and a Half Men,” one of the most popular sitcoms in TV history. On the other hand, he's dealing with quite a few issues. Charlie is the son of popular actor Martin Sheen, who dominated Hollywood in the ‘70s and still acts to this day.\n\nSince they do not go by the same last name, it is easy to forget that Charlie has a famous brother. Emilio Estevez, who’s also a successful actor, although not quite as popular and well-known as his younger brother.\n\nKate Mara & Rooney Mara\n\nYou'll probably recognize Kate Mara as Zoe Barnes from the hit Netflix political drama, \"House of Cards,\" starring Robin Wright. She has been an actress since 1999 and appeared in many films. Her sister, Rooney Mara, is also a Hollywood actress and has appeared in various films, including \"The Girl With The Dragon tattoo\" and \"Carol.\"\n\nIt's safe to say that these sisters have taken Hollywood by storm!\n\nOliver Hudson & Kate Hudson\n\nOliver Hudson and Kate Hudson are both successful American actors who began working in the film industry in the ‘90s. Kate is most famous for her roles in \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\", \"Raising Helen,\" \"The Skeleton Key,\" and \"You, Me, and Dupree.\"\n\nHer less famous brother, Oliver, is most known for his role as Adam Rhodes in the CBS comedy series \"Rules of Engagement.\" We wonder what it’s like to live as siblings who both share the lives of the rich and famous.\n\nJohn Cusack & Joan Cusack\n\nThe Cusack siblings both have the acting bug! John Cusack was a prominent actor in the 80s and 90s, most famous for holing a Boombox up high in the film \"Say Anything.\"\n\nHis sister, Joan Cusack, is also a talented actress and a comedian herself. Joan appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" during the mid-'80s. Since then she's starred in \"School of Rock\" and lent her voice to the \"toy Story\" film franchise.\n\nMark Wahlberg & Donnie Wahlberg\n\nMark Wahlberg started out as a rapper and then successfully transitioned into films. His career has been so successful that he was the world's best-paid actor in 2017.\n\nMark's brother, Donnie Wahlberg, is a singer and record producer. He was also an actor for a while and played in various films such as the \"Saw\" franchise, M. Night Shyamalan's \"The Sixth Sense,\" and more. They clearly have a very strong resemblance in many of their facial features, and both are definitely quite handsome.\n\nLindsay Lohan & Ali Lohan\n\nEveryone remembers Lindsay Lohan as the wonderful child actor who appeared in many films such as \"Mean Girls,\" \"The Parent Trap,\" and \"Freaky Friday.\" She was subjected to extreme amounts of tabloid and media attention during the mid-to-late 2000s, which, of course, had quite a negative impact on the actress. She was initially signed to Ford Models as a child but became a worldwide hit due to a string of successful shows and films.\n\nHer sister, Aliana Lohan, is an up-and-coming model, singer, and actress.\n\nZooey Deschanel & Emily Deschanel\n\nNo matter which films the actress and model has appeared in, everyone remembered Zooey Deschanel mostly for her eyes, which have been rumored to cause men everywhere to freeze and turn to stone. Zooey showed off her incredible comedic skills in the film \"500 Days of Summer\" and the popular show \"New Girl.\"\n\nHer sister, Emily, looks very different from her sister, although the two do share a prominent feature — a pair of crystal blue eyes. Emily is also an actress and a film producer. She is best known for her role in the series \"Bones\" between 2005 and 2017.\n\nGigi, Bella & Anwar Hadid\n\nGigi and Bella Hadid are a highly successful duo of sibling models. Gigi has over 50 million fans on Instagram, and her sister, Bella, has more than 25 million followers. They are the daughters of real estate developer Mohamed Hadid and former model Yolanda Hadid.\n\nTheir brother, Anwar Hadid, is also a fashion model. It's safe to say all three hit the genetic lottery!\n\nJessica Simpson & Ashlee Simpson\n\nBoth Jessica Simpson and Ashlee Simpson are wonderfully successful singers and actresses. The two have sold many millions of copies between them and have attained an almost worldwide level of recognition and fame. The two were born four years apart in Abilene, Texas, and were raised in Dallas.\n\nIt’s nice to know that the Simpson sisterhood has remained strong over the years, even through the ups and downs of Hollywood.\n\nRashida Jones & Kidada Jones\n\nYou may know Rashida for starring as Ann Perkins on the NBC comedy series \"Parks and Recreation.\" While Kidada has had her fair of success in The Walt Disney Company, where she created a fashion line named Kidada for Disney Couture, both of them are the daughters of composer Quincy Jones and actress Peggy Lipton.\n\nMany don't know this, but Kidada Jones was married to rapper Tupac Shakur in 1996 before his untimely death. Although you don't see the sisters together often, it's easy to see just how similar the two are when they stand next to each other.\n\nChristian Campbell & Neve Campbell\n\nChristian is best known for his roles in the films \"Trick,\" \"Big Love,\" and \"Reefer Madness.\" Neve is best known for her role as Julia Salinger in the drama series \"Party of Five\" and as Sidney Prescott in the horror film franchise \"Scream.\" The two lived with their father, an acting teacher, who went on to receive custody of them after their mother and father got divorced.\n\nAlthough they are considered Canadian actors, these siblings have become increasingly popular in Hollywood!\n\nDemi Lovato & Madison De La Garza\n\nDemi Lovato has built up quite a name for themselves as a multi-talented singer, songwriter, actress, and entertainer. They rose to prominence by playing Mitchie Torres in Disney's famous film \"Camp Rock\" and its sequel \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\". They earned numerous awards and nominations for their songs over the years and is an active supporter of LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nTheir sister, Madison De La Garza, is also an actress, making her breakthrough on \"Desperate Housewives\" and has appeared in a few TV shows and films since 2008. The sisters are very similar in many ways, but each is unique in her way. They both have a chin dimple and that same dark flowing hair.\n\nLily Allen & Alfie Allen\n\nThe Allen siblings are the son and daughter of actor Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen. Lily is an exceptionally successful singer and songwriter, and sold over 2.5 million copies when she debuted with her first album, \"Alright, Still.\"\n\nShe is exceptionally well received by critics and continues to evolve her musical style over the years. Somehow, it still surprises us that her brother Alfie is famous as well. He is mostly known for playing Theon Greyjoy in the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\" and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2019.\n\nJames Franco & Dave Franco\n\nJames and Dave Franco have been in Hollywood for quite a long time now. They’re the perfect example of a goofy and hilarious sibling duo that puts a smile on everyone’s faces. The two even acted together in the entertaining parody film “The Disaster Artist,” which chronicles the real-life story of how the film \"The Room,\" which is considered the worst movie of all time, was made.\n\nAs we mentioned, Dave works as an actor as well, albeit he has not received the same amount of fame as his brother…yet.\n\nRalph Fiennes & Joseph Fiennes\n\nRalph Fiennes is one of England’s most recognizable actors and appeared in various successful films, including \"Harry Potter,\" where he played the menacing and noseless Voldemort. He seems to have a knack for playing the villain since he was also the voice of Ramses in the \"Prince of Egypt\" film. Ralph became a director when he adapted Shakespeare's tragedy \"Coriolanus.\" In 1995, after playing prince Hamlet, he won a Tony Award for it.\n\nHis brother Joseph Fiennes is also a film and stage actor, although he's certainly not as famous as his brother. Both English actors appear to be big Shakespeare fans, as Joseph’s most iconic film to this day has been the 1998 classic, \"Shakespeare in Love,\" where he played William Shakespeare himself.\n\nLarry David & Bernie Sanders\n\nLook, we’re not going to just say they look like the same guy (for real though), but there may be in fact, a reason for it! The comedian Larry David is actually a relative of the political candidate, Bernie Sanders.\n\nApparently, they had no idea either, and when they found out that they were cousins, both men were quite shocked. You two and us both!\n\nRalph Fiennes & King Charles III\n\nAt the end of the day, we’re definitely all related at some point, but for Ralph Fiennes and King Charles III, there are only 8 degrees of separation! Well, at least, they’re eighth cousins.\n\nWho would’ve thought Voldemort was in fact a cousin of a muggle? A royal muggle at that. The more you know, huh?\n\nVera Farmiga & Taissa Farmiga\n\nThese two have just over two decades between them, but you can’t say that they don’t look alike! It’s definitely something about the eyes, right? The other main vein here is that the two have both dabbled in roles that pertain to the paranormal.\n\nYou’d remember Vera from “The Conjuring,” and maybe you’d know Taissa from “American Horror Story.” Maybe these sisters are just drawn to the creepier side of things!\n\nJohnny Depp & Queen Elizabeth II\n\nIt’s definitely a royal affair here. We’re quite amazed to find out that Johnny Depp, who brought us more films than we can count, is actually a distant relative of the late Queen Elizabeth II!\n\nYes, that’s right, Depp is a distant cousin of the former queen of England, due to their common thread of being descended from Edward III. We’re going to start checking our family trees. Who knows, you might be a royal too!\n\nCarrie Fisher & Billie Lourd\n\nThe late Carrie Fisher, most famously known for her role as Princess Leia in the “Star Wars” universe, was of course a bit of a legend on the screen.\n\nDid you know that she had a daughter? Maybe it was the fact that Billie Lourd took her father’s name that we didn’t at first realize it was Carrie’s girl, but upon further inspection, it’s very, very clear. It’s the eye shape – we feel we are basically looking into Carrie’s eyes!\n\nTrace Cyrus & Miley Cyrus\n\nRemember the band, Metro Station? Yeah, remember the lead singer, with the side fringe and lip piercing? Well, you may not know this, but that’s actually Miley’s brother, Trace!\n\nSeems like the whole family is quite talented and, in the spotlight, but we did not see the resemblance at first. The family is quite close and all very supportive of one another. We love it!\n\nMaddie Ziegler & Sia\n\nRemember the little girl who danced with Shia LaBeouf in one of Sia’s film clips? Well, there was more than her just being a dancer who got a lucky break – she is in fact, Sia’s goddaughter! No wonder she got an in on that music video! Just kidding, she’s obviously very talented.\n\nThe Australian singer, Sia, is very close with her goddaughter and we absolutely love her and her mini-me in “Chandelier.”\n\nMacaulay Culkin & Paris Jackson\n\nSeems an unlikely pair here, huh? Well, not a pair, but relatives in a way! Culkin, who is none other than the kid from “Home Alone”, is in fact, related to Paris Jackson by way of being her godfather.\n\nMacaulay and Paris even have matching tattoos!\n\nJeff Bezos & George Strait\n\nYou better believe that Bezos is a country boy at heart folks because he is related to none other than famous country singer, George Strait. Pretty cool that the “King of Country” is the cousin of the “King of IT” heh!\n\nWell, we’re pretty sure that Bezos is basically the King of that industry, due to his stake in Amazon.\n\nElton John & The Beckhams\n\nThis maybe was a connection we should’ve seen coming, due to the fact that these folks are all British, but then again, not totally obvious!\n\nThe legendary singer and piano man, Elton John, is close friends with the Beckham family – so much so that he’s godfather to both Romeo and Brooklyn Beckham. We bet he gives them some great presents, and maybe some vocal lessons!\n\nCameron Diaz & Nicole Ritchie\n\nThese two famous ladies are in fact linked by the brothers they married – none other than Benji and Joel Madden, of the pop-punk band, “Good Charlotte.”\n\nWe don’t think they get confused between the twins (well at least we hope not). It’s the cute friendship and relationship that we’re here for, seeing as the famous actress and the famous designer are gal pals (and, family)!\n\nPresident Obama & President Bush\n\nDon’t let political opinions come between anyone, because you may be stunned to find out that President Obama and President Bush are in fact, distantly related!\n\nYes, you read that right. The pair are tenth cousins – and there’s apparently a family tree to prove it. It is the United States after all.\n\nFantasia Barrino, K-Ci & JoJo\n\nClearly, amazing pipes run in the family, as we’ve discovered with American Idol winner, Fantasia Barrino and musical artists K-Ci & JoJo.\n\nGeez, you’d think they’d have given their cousin a little leg up into the industry with her talent, but no. Seems you need to work for your success and earn your credentials on your own! Regardless, the talent is overflowing in this family!\n\nAmy Schumer & Chuck Schumer\n\nWell, this one seems kinda obvious with the surnames, but surely it’s also a funny coincidence that these two are related! (It’s a joke, people.)\n\nComedian Amy Schumer, the star of the film, “Trainwreck”, is in fact related to the long-time Democratic New York Senator, Chuck Schumer. The pair have actually been at press conferences together.\n\nNicolas Cage & Jason Schwartzman\n\nHow outrageous is it that Nic Cage is related to Jason Schwartzman? We’ll add one more cousin in there – Sofia Coppola. Wow! So, Nicolas is the son of August Ford Coppola, Schwartzman’s mother is Talia Rose Coppola and well, Sofia Coppola is the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola!\n\nThat must be one heck of a Thanksgiving celebration when these three families get together!\n\nSnoop Dogg & Brandy\n\nWait, these two are related? Can we just double-check that? Our minds are kinda blown by this fact. Snoop Dogg, who really needs no introduction, is in fact, first cousins with the R&B singer, Brandy.\n\nSince Snoop Dogg was also in the industry at the time Brandy was on the rise, she saw firsthand the rollercoaster ride that is the music industry, which probably helped a lot!\n\nDiana Ross & Jessica Simpson\n\nOkay, this connection by marriage is kinda amazing! Seeing snaps of these two big families together makes our hearts warm, seriously.\n\nAnyway, the reason that these two are hanging out is that Ashlee Simpson, Jessica’s sister, is married to Evan Ross, Diana’s son! By extension, Ross is Ashlee’s mother-in-law. How epic is that?\n\nHilary Clinton & Angelina Jolie\n\nYep, these two names, these two very big names, are in fact not that far apart. Well, that’s up to you to decide once we tell you the full story. Apparently, Jolie and Clinton are actually tenth cousins but have been twice removed.\n\nThe relationship didn’t stop there – this family tree connected a few famous folks, including Madonna, Celine Dion, and Camila Parker-Bowles. Wacky, isn’t it?!\n\nScott Foley & Patrick Wilson\n\nThese two are brothers-in-law, but then again, we’re not really surprised – after all, Hollywood is pretty small at the end of the day. Like, geez, look at how Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are now related due to an introduction to her sister, Felicity.\n\nAnywho, these two Hollywood stars are now brothers-in-law due to the family they both married into. Foley, of “Scandal”, is married to Polish model, Marika Dominczyk, and Patrick Wilson married her sister, Dagmara, who’s a star in “Succession.”"
