        "text": "Suge Knight has accused Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Sean “Diddy” Combs with being members of a “secret society,” an assertion which Snoop himself seemingly finds comical.\n\nOn Saturday (March 9), Breakbeat Media released the latest episode of Knight’s Collect Call podcast, on which he claimed that the trio was under the control of powerful forces beyond themselves. The Death Row Records founder, who is currently serving a prison sentence stemming from a manslaughter conviction, spoke of alleged public displays of affection shown amongst that particular group.\n\n“Once they start painting they fingernails and wearing women’s clothes, they got you,” Knight said of his antagonists. He also recalled instances in which Diddy received lavish gifts from the late Andre Harrell and rapper The Game that gave him cause to pause.\n\n“I remember when they was giving Puffy an award at the ASCAP Awards — Andre went up there and got him an expensive watch and gave it to him in front of everybody. He basically confessed his love to this man,” the legendary mogul said. “Then Puffy and Snoop became besties. Every time you see one, you seen the other one. Next thing you know, they start painting they fingernails. Didn’t make sense.”\n\nKnight continued, “[The] Game bought Puffy a Lamborghini when Puffy got more money than Game. Why you buying this man a Lamborghini? You know your homies don’t even got a Lamborghini. But once again, it’s that secret society. For this thing to work and fix it, they gotta start all the way over in these major record labels and these big buildings. They need to get rid of all the guys who was connected to the poison and the snake.”\n\nUpon catching wind of Knight’s claims, Snoop Dogg issued a response by simply reposting an AllHipHop report of the embattled mogul’s allegations along with a laughing emoji and a shrugging emoji, seemingly expressing his humor and bewilderment regarding his former CEO’s assertion.\n\nSee Snoop Dogg’s response to Suge Knight below."
