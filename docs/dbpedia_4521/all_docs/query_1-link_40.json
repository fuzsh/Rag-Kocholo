        "text": "It was Calvin Broadus Jr.—you know him as the rapper Snoop Dogg—who announced me to the world as \"Uncle Charlie.\" But the title wasn't some rap moniker or gimmicky nickname, and it sure wasn't meant as the insulting reference racists used to lob at older black men back in the day. Snoop called me \"Uncle\" out of admiration and respect for our friendship. Indeed, because we are family.\n\nIn the beginning, ours was an easy bond. Those initial sessions in the studio, when he was taking his first steps away from Death Row Records and I was piecing myself together both personally and musically, were filled with moments of admiration for each other's skills. Snoop's abilities as a rapper, soft-spoken and smooth and steeped in the very essence of G-funk, were something to behold; his voice was like the buttery rap answer to the soulful, velvety stylings of Al Green, with a laser-sharp focus on the reality of black lives that mirrored what Marvin Gaye was hitting with What's Going On, or what I loved about Curtis Mayfield's lyrical observations on socio-political and pop cultural moments that helped to ignite the passions of a people in the sixties.\n\nWith that easy-like-Sunday-morning Southern twang dancing up and through his words, Snoop was making poetic what it was like to live on the streets of Long Beach—a collage of gangster, pimp, and drug experiences that captured what I was seeing while I was homeless and addicted, tottering from stash houses to rooms overrun with the illegal narcotics and the sex trade that made up that world's underbelly. He wasn't rapping; he was kicking game—laid-back but still very much in control. I liked that about his artistry, about him.\n\n\"I listened to you all's music because my mama played all of that,\" he said.\n\nAs for Snoop, he seemed genuinely enamored with my musical abilities, and with me. In those first few days of our working together, he would entertain me with stories about being raised in a house where funk lived. He would lie at his mother's feet, listening to Parliament Funkadelic and Sly and the Family Stone, Kool and the Gang, and Earth, Wind and Fire, and, of course, The GAP Band, learning about the stylings from his mom and letting the instrumentation, melodies, and lyrics seep into his bones. \"I listened to you all's music because my mama played all of that,\" he said. \"I learned about you from my mom.\"\n\nBut he would learn a lot more about me outside of the music, when we moved on from being musical colleagues and started getting to know each other as men. Those deeper conversations—about family, loyalty, love, fatherhood, how to do right—came slowly at first, then opened up like floodgates once I started hanging with him and his family outside the studio, back at his home. His babies were really little then and they called me Uncle Charlie. Snoop joined in after I started schooling him on the ways of men and talking to him like a father. I would talk to him about how to have a relationship with his wife, how to be a good father to his children, how to simply be. In that advice were lessons—all the things I'd learned from my own trials, tribulations, and triumphs as a husband, father, and artist. \"You don't want to make the same mistakes I did,\" I'd warn him.\n\nSnoop wasn't rebellious when it came to the advice I gave him. Generally, he listened to what I had to say and even took my advice. But in the beginning, he was taken aback when I started talking to him about making changes in his life—changes in the way he did business, the way that he presented himself as an artist, the way he cared for his body, the way he loved his wife and their family. My wife and I talked to him about everything. We were muscling him so hard on every little thing that every once in a while he would kind of look at me sideways and say, \"Man, nobody tells me anything about my house and what I'm supposed to do with it. Every time I make a move, here y'all come.\" Truly, we were like parents to him, and he was our hardheaded but loved son.\n\n\"You're smoking and smoking and smoking, and what good is it doing you?\"\n\nOne time I went in there preaching about his weed habit. He's never made a secret of his love for marijuana. In interviews, pictures, his lyrics, and his videos, Snoop espouses the virtues of smoking and portrays himself as one of the most vocal proponents of the drug. Spend more than five minutes around him and it's clear he loves the stuff. But when we started working together, the life he was getting from inhaling was killing me. My wife was the first one to say something about it. She didn't waste any time getting right down to it, either. On the first day I took her to the studio, she laid down Mahin's Law. She has an accent and she struggles with the letter S, so she ends up putting \"uh\" in front of it, which made the way she called Snoop's name interesting enough. But what she said made Snoop snap to attention. \"Uh-Snoop,\" she demanded, \"y'all can't uh-smoke and get high around my husband. He's recovering.\"\n\n\"Word?\" he said, clearly taken aback by the request. That was the first day we met; I'll never forget that. He turned to his boys, who were in the studio smoking with him, and said, \"Okay, y'all gotta put this out. Charlie Wilson is coming in here.\" He took her request that he stop smoking around me under advisement and respected what she had to say about it as a former drug counselor who had seen up close the downward spiral an addict could take simply by being around people who were drinking or doing drugs. She was afraid that his habit, and particularly his penchant for smoking in the studio while he was working, would trigger a relapse for me.\n\nOf course, I was concerned about that, too, even years into my recovery, but I was equally worried that he would fall prey to the same demons that tried to take me out when I was addicted and being robbed, abused, and taken advantage of by the predators who'd been surrounding me. So one day when I was visiting his house, I spoke up and told him he'd have to quit it. And when I tell you I went in? I mean, I went in. I pulled him into his kitchen and let it fly.\n\n\"He hasn't smoked,\" she said. \"What did you say to him, Uncle Charlie?\"\n\n\"Man, I can't stop you from doing what you're doing, but I can't be around that weed because I'm a recovering alcoholic and addict, and the way you're around here smoking, you're no different from a crackhead as far as I'm concerned,\" I said. \"Shit, look at y'all. You're talking about how you saw me that time at the gas station, high and looking all bad and everything, but I'm looking at you, and you can't even cut a damn song because you're too high to get the work done. You're in there laughing and giggling and too high to do what you're supposed to be doing.\n\n\"Let me tell you this, man,\" I said, \"I really love you. You've got a beautiful wife, you got these kids, and I know there's a lot of craziness going on in here, but you're going to have to quit smoking weed.\"\n\n\"What?\" he asked, clearly taken aback. \"For real?\"\n\n\"Man, you're going to have to quit. You're smoking and smoking and smoking, and what good is it doing you? Come on, man!\"\n\nI talked to him nonstop for a good ten minutes. When I finally stopped talking, he was quiet for a good half a minute as he stared at me with this look, as if to say, \"Man, who the hell do you think you are?\" But when he finally spoke, I was shocked by what he had to say.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"All right. I'm going to stop.\"\n\nYou could have knocked me flat on my behind. I'd expected a fight. Or for him to lay me out. But instead, he listened to me—actually took my advice and quit smoking weed right at that very moment.\n\nAdmittedly, I didn't fully believe he was going to do what he said, but he did. The next day, I asked his wife, Shante, how he was doing and she was shocked. \"He hasn't smoked,\" she said. \"What did you say to him, Uncle Charlie?\"\n\nThat day without smoking turned into a week for Snoop, then it turned into two weeks, and then a month and then another month, and then he sent out an official message into the industry saying that he'd quit smoking. Honestly? I couldn't believe he'd listened. I know that he faced an enormous amount of pressure behind the decision; people would go over to his house with weed and he was trying to keep people away from his door. \"They keep coming, Uncle Charlie,\" he complained.\n\n\"Nobody's ever tried to talk to me like this, man. Never,\" he said with joyful tears in his eyes.\n\nI told him I knew it better than most, as the same thing happened to me. I offered to sic Mahin on them but he said he could handle it himself, and he did. Snoop, the self-proclaimed weed connoisseur, quit smoking for almost a year. I continued to counsel him on various things, one area of which was marriage. I reminded him, for instance, that he and his wife made a commitment to each other and that the key to his success was in the bond he created with his wife and children. I needed him to listen to and respect what I was saying to him as a man, and thankfully, he did, because really, he's been famous almost as long as not and he was used to people doing what he said, catering to his every demand and, at home, being the man of his house.\n\n\"Nobody's ever tried to talk to me like this, man. Never,\" he said with joyful tears in his eyes. He went on to tell me that he'd missed having a true father figure in his life while he was growing up—how his stepfather divorced his mother when he was just four and how his biological father hadn't come back into his life until after he became a superstar. \"I had nobody, man. I grew up in the hood, just me and my mama. But you're teaching me a lot right now.\"\n\nI was proud of Snoop and Shante for working hard to make their marriage last, so much so that I debuted \"There Goes My Baby,\" a fan-favorite song about the first time a man meets and falls in love with his woman, at their vow-renewal ceremony, which they held at my ranch. The song has an old feel to it, but the lyrics are modern, fresh, and tell a story that I just knew the two of them could relate to. They loved it—everyone did—and I was pleased about that. But I was even more honored to feature them in the song's video as a visual testament to Snoop's love for his wife.\n\nIt was Michael Paran's idea to gather footage from Snoop and Shante's wedding and other special moments in their lives and put it together in a documentary-style illustration of the song, and I couldn't have been more happy to do so. The twinkle in their smiles, the tears in Snoop's eyes, the way the two of them embrace, the way their kids look at them with admiration, all of that makes my heart swell.\n\nI had more advice: \"Let your wife run the business. Let her be a part of your organization. Let her be with you. You're gone for five and six and seven days at a time, and though she knows you're somewhere in Germany, she really doesn't know where you are. All she wants is to be with you. You're her family. She's your family. Family sticks together.\" He finally did listen to that; his wife is involved in his business, though he and Shante categorically refuse to be around each other every day all day, like me and Mahin. I brought that up and both of them looked at me as if I were crazy and said, practically simultaneously, \"I don't know if we can do all that, Uncle Charlie!\" We laughed so hard we all fell out.\n\nFrom by Charlie Wilson.
