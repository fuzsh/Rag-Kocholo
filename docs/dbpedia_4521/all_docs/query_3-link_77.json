        "text": "America (Snoop Dogg)\n\nAndres Serrano\n\nPhotography\n\nOn View:\n\nSnoop Dogg is part of Andres Serrano's series America. It attempts to document the current social reality of the U.S.A. In addition to Snoop Dogg, the series includes images of such diverse personalities as a Playboy Bunny, a homeless man, a firefighter, a street vendor, a boy scout, and an assistant at an investment bank. Undertaking the series in response to the shock of 9/11, Serrano set out to answer the question of who we are and what the diversity of America actually looks like. He captures the humanity of his subjects while at the same time the scale of the figures, as they are positioned within the picture frame, gives them almost heroic proportions.\n\nMEDIUM Cibachrome print\n\nDATES 2002\n\nDIMENSIONS 45 1/4 × 37 5/8 in.
