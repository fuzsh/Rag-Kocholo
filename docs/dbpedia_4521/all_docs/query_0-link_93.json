        "text": "Gold medals aren’t the only thing glittering in Paris.\n\nStars have flocked to France to catch the Olympics live and in person in the first few day of the international competition. Lady Gaga, fresh from performing “Mon Truc en Plumes” while dressed in Dior during the opening ceremony, cheered on superstar Simone Biles and the USA women’s gymnastics team from inside Bercy Arena where Tom Cruise, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Greta Gerwig, Baz Luhrmann, Jessica Chastain, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Nick Jonas, Anna Wintour, Snoop Dogg, Lena Waithe, Jon M. Chu and Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav also caught the flips, tumbles and balance beam action.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden snagged a seat next to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass during the first night of swimming while Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates and tennis great Serena Williams caught the Novak Djokovic versus Rafael Nadal tennis match. Spike Lee and Queen Latifah watched the men’s basketball team triumph over Serbia in a game that featured more stars on the court than in the stands thanks to a stacked roster of NBA superstars like LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Devin Booker and more. Mick Jagger watched fencing while Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban checked out women’s street skateboarding.\n\nThe Olympics continue through Aug. 11, which means there will likely be plenty of star sightings and social media posts to come from inside the Olympics venues. See below for a roundup of what’s happened thus far in the City of Love."
