        "text": "Snoop actually has a child who was born to his mistress in 1998. All the details ahead!\n\nBy Kelly Corbett\n\nUpdated May 22 2024, 4:33 p.m. ET\n\nThere are two sides to Snoop Dogg (real name Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.). While he's mostly known for being a gangsta rap icon and cannabis enthusiast, he's also a close friend to Martha Stewart, a home reno expert (as seen on Celebrity IOU), and a devoted family man.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" artist actually has four kids and has made raising them his biggest priority in life. But who exactly are Snoop's kids, and what are the known details of their relationship? Here's a look at Snoop's family.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSnoop Dogg and his wife, Shante Broadus, have three kids together.\n\nIn 1997, Snoop Dogg married his high school sweetheart, Shante Broadus. While they've had a few rough patches along the way (including splitting up in 2004), they are currently together. Today, they have three kids: sons Corde and Cordell Broadus, and daughter Cori Broadus. Let's get to know each of their kids a little better.\n\nCorde Broadus — 29\n\nCorde, who was born on August 21, 1994, is the couple's first child together. Naturally, he became an integral part of his father's early career. Appearing in the music video for \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" before he was even in junior high school, Corde was inducted into Snoop's world early on.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nCorde is currently 29 years old, and has one child with his ex-girlfriend, Jessica Kyzer. He and and Soraya Love also share two kids. While the couple did welcome a third child in 2019, sadly, he died 10 days after birth, per People. Corde is currently pursuing creative work such as music and modeling.\n\nCordell Broadus — 27\n\nSnoop's second son, Cordell, initially made waves for his remarkable success in football. The 27-year-old was actually ranked as the 26th best wide receiver in the country while he was still in high school and even had an ESPN show with his dad documenting his path to college football glory. However, Cordell eventually lost interest in the sport, taking up filmmaking instead. He now works between modeling, filmmaking, and charitable efforts.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nCordell reportedly owns Film School Productions stands on its mission to \"not only to be the most versatile media production company, but the most original as well,\" per the company's YouTube account.\n\nCori Broadus — 24\n\nSnoop's only daughter, Cori, 24, is his youngest child but has arguably endured some of the toughest battles in her family. She was diagnosed at a young age with lupus, a vicious autoimmune disease, and the condition put great strain on both her and her closest relatives. However, Snoop has said that Cori has been doing much better in recent years.\n\nLike her father, Cori also takes an interest in music and is a singer with a small but impressive discography.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSnoop actually has a fourth child who was born to his mistress in 1998.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Snoop was seeing a woman named Laurie Holmond for a period of time, which led to the birth of their one and only child, Julian Broadus, 25, in 1998. The relationship between Laurie and Snoop went sour rather quickly, which greatly impacted the developmental bonding between Snoop and Julian.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHe has been candid about what it's been like growing up without as much attention from his megastar father, explaining in various interviews over time how he had to establish himself pretty much on his own. While he previously worked as a luxury real estate agent, Julian is now the executive director of promotions for Voxel X Network."
