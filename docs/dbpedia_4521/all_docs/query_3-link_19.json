        "text": "This story first published in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal on June 9, 2003. Snoop Dogg's grandmother, Corrine Broadus, died in 2005.\n\nHis secret might have been safe if Snoop Dogg hadn't jumped off the tour bus and strolled into the Li'l Cricket on Pinckney Street.\n\nHis aunt, Earleen Broadus, said that was all it took.\n\n\"Then everybody seemed to know he was in town,\" she said Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe rap star/actor was between engagements in Charlotte, N.C., and Myrtle Beach and stopped in to visit his 90-year-old grandmother, Corrine Broadus, late Saturday afternoon.\n\nSuper Bowl 2022: Everything to know about the halftime show and other musical performances\n\nIt was his first trip since 1974, and his grandmother described it as a surprise, although the family and the Union Public Safety Office had been coordinating the visit for some time.\n\n\"The buses got lost,\" Earlene Broadus said, laughing. \"We didn't expect what happened.\"\n\nThe result was as many as 500 to 600 anxious residents showing up at the grandmother's house on Monroe Street.\n\nThe majority brought along cameras.\n\nCrews touring with Snoop Dogg told local authorities they drew a much larger crowd in Union than they had in a shopping mall in Charlotte earlier in the day.\n\nMore Snoop Dogg in the SHJ: Snoop's kin can't wait for 'Father Hood'\n\nSnoop Dogg, 30, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was born in California and has never lived in Union.\n\nSince she does not get to see him often, Corrine Broadus took the time to tell her well-known grandson a thing or two.\n\nShe said the visit was great, and she was glad to see him. But she let him know right away what she thinks of his music.\n\nHip-hop icons: Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg say Super Bowl 2022 halftime show will be 'all the way real'\n\n\"It's twice he's come to see me. Bless his heart. Some of his music is all right. But I believe in the church. I told him he could just leave some parts of that other out. He said, 'Oh, Big Momma, nothing wrong with it. I gotta make a living.' He looked good and healthy,\" she said.\n\nSnoop Dogg's uncle, Ireanus Broadus, said the family has received numerous telephone calls about the visit, which, drew the large crowd to their street.\n\n\"Oh, boy. Did they show up?\" he said. \"I think everybody who came had a camera or video going. They took momma's picture with him and mine, too. He talked about a new CD they're making.\"\n\nThe family says Calvin's mother gave him the nickname \"Snoop,\" and that's what they all call him. He took time to pose for photographs with family members during the two-hour visit before he faced his fans in the street where he handed out promotional CDs and had more photos taken.\n\nUnion Public Safety Officers on hand to assist in controlling the large group reported no problems.\n\nMore: Why you should expect greatness from this yearâ€™s Super Bowl halftime show\n\n\"Everything went well,\" said Officer Mickey Parker, 31, who said he's not thinking about changing his choice of music because of the visit.\n\n\"But he seemed like a nice enough guy,\" Parker said. \"It's not something that happens every day in Union.\"\n\nLocal officers coordinated outside the residence with Snoop Dogg's security crews, which include policemen from Los Angeles who sign on for the tours as a part-time job.\n\nThe crowd was respectful of the family visiting inside and stayed clear of the front entrance, authorities said.\n\n\"But getting him on the bus was crazy. Everybody wanted to touch him,\" Parker said."
