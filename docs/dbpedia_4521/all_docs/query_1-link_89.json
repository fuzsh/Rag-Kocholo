        "text": "Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” keeps resonating as a streaming hit. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, “This Is America” has been certified platinum, recognizing 1 million equivalent song units earned in the U.S.\n\nOne equivalent song unit, as recognized by the RIAA, is equal to: one digital song sale, or 150 on-demand audio and/or video streams. The RIAA changed its Gold & Platinum Awards Program on Feb. 1, 2016, growing from a strictly sales certification process to one that includes tracks and streams.\n\nThe certification follows a series of No. 1s for the hard-hitting track, including a debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Since then, “This Is America” has been streamed over 147 million times, with its much-lauded video topping it at over 216 million streams."
