        "text": "While the pillars are up, the important part of acquiring a portion of the properties where between 5 to 10 feet is to be taken up on the Sultan Bazaar-Putlibowli-Badichowdi stretch could begin towards the month-end for widening the road and also for taking up viaduct construction.\n\nThere are about 180 properties on the stretch and close to a 100 property owners have given consent, according to senior officials.\n\nChief Secretary S.P. Singh in his maiden special task force meeting on Tuesday called upon the revenue officials of Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Collectorates and GHMC to concentrate on this work to bridge the gaps in metro corridors.\n\nMr. Singh, who has the distinction of being the founder-chairman of Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR), told the meeting held at the Secretariat that the project is dear to him and hence wanted all the officials concerned of various departments to coordinate to ensure most parts of the project get completed this year as directed by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.\n\nProperties acquisition was also due in the areas of Krishna Nagar, Yousufguda and Jubilee Hills.\n\nCollectors of both the districts were urged to focus on properties under litigation and strive to resolve them to remove the bottlenecks halting the completion of the project.\n\nHMR MD N.V.S. Reddy in his presentation informed the Chief Secreetary led task force that 61 km of foundations, 59 km of pillars and 50 km of viaduct have been completed.\n\nThe Road over Bridge works at Alugadda Bavi, Oliphenta and Malakpet are in full swing and those at Begumpet and Lakdikapul have also picked up speed.\n\nSenior officials Navin Mittal, Collectors Rahul Bojja (Hyderabad), M. Raghunandan Rao (RR), HMR CE Md. Ziauddin, GHMC CCP Devender Reddy and others were present."
