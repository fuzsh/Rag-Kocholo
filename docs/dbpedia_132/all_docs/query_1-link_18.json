        "text": "Mumps Vaccination for children in Hyderabad\n\nThe mumps vaccine is typically administered as part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, which provides protection against all three diseases.\n\nThe first dose of the MMR vaccine, which includes protection against mumps, is typically given to children at 9-12 months of age. A second dose of the MMR vaccine is usually administered between 15-18 months of age and the third dose is administered between 4-6 years of age. The second and third doses help to ensure long-lasting immunity and further boost protection against measles.\n\nMumps Vaccination for adults in Hyderabad\n\nAdults who have not previously received the MMR vaccine or have not had mumps in the past should consider getting vaccinated. The first dose of the MMR vaccine, including mumps, can be administered at any age. A second dose of the MMR vaccine is recommended to ensure long-term immunity. The timing of the second dose may vary depending on individual circumstances and vaccination history. Generally, it is given at least 28 days after the first dose. There is no upper age limit to receive the mumps vaccine.\n\nCost of Mumps vaccination in Hyderabad\n\nThe cost of measles vaccination depends on factors such as the type of vaccine, brand, manufacturer, applicable taxes and the vaccination service provider. On an average, the cost of MMR vaccination ranges between Rs 600 to Rs 1200 for each dose.\n\nMumps vaccination at home in Hyderabad\n\nVaccination at home offers a convenient, accessible and safe way to protect you and your family from mumps infection. It allows individuals to receive the vaccine in a familiar environment, reducing potential anxiety or discomfort associated with visiting a clinic. Home vaccination not only saves time and effort, it also minimizes exposure to potential infections in crowded healthcare settings. INVC vaccine experts can help you with availability and scheduling of MMR vaccine at home in Hyderabad."
