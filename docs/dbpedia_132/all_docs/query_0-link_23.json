If you have missed taking the shingles vaccination earlier, now is the time to get vaccinated. Book a consultation with your doctor or INVC vaccine expert today to learn more about vaccination and protect yourself against shingles.\n\nCost of shingles vaccination in Hyderabad\n\nThe cost of shingles vaccination depends on factors such as the type of vaccine, brand, manufacturer, applicable taxes and the vaccination service provider. On an average, the cost of one dose of shingles vaccination ranges between Rs 11000 to Rs 12000. It's best to check with your vaccination provider to get an accurate and updated estimate of the cost.\n\nShingles vaccination at home in Hyderabad\n\nVaccination at home offers a convenient, accessible and safe way to protect you and your family from shingles infection. It allows individuals to receive the vaccine in a familiar environment, reducing potential anxiety or discomfort associated with visiting a clinic.
