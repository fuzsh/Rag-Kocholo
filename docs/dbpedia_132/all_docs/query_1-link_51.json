        "text": "MGS Ghee roots back to 1956 when our founder MR. K.V. Ramaswamy began the tradition of making pure desi ghee and selling it door to door on his bicycle.\n\nOur first flagship store was opened in Badichowdi, Hyderabad by our founder's son MR. R. Shanmugham who is also the current head of the company.\n\nAfter 14 successful years of spreading joy and happiness in our surroundings we discovered the need to cater a larger customer base and successively set-up a small production unit near the store.\n\nTwo decades later, “Mysore Ghee” became a household name and we were convinced to brand ourselves as “MGS Ghee”. This was our first step towards branding and it had multiplied our reach.\n\nAs the branded packets of MGS Ghee started reaching the households of Hyderabad our production unit was shifted to a bigger base in Amberpet in order to cater to the growing needs of the consumers.\n\nSoon the brand's image started capturing the minds of the consumers and simultaneously we had renovated our store in Badichowdi to a bigger and well-equipped facility.\n\nOur two sutras of making fresh and pure desi ghee had become a hit in the market and it was time that we started expanding our roots into the city. We opened several branches in major localities in the city of Hyderabad.\n\nThis was the year we decided to have a makeover and set a trend for the 21st century. Our product packaging was a game changer as it received immense love from our customers and a positive response from the market.\n\nTo align with our vision of delivering Pure desi Ghee to every single household we started distributing our products among various supermarkets in the city.\n\nSoon we began our journey online and started selling our products on Amazon & Big Basket and started making our presence felt throughout the nation.\n\nWith increase in the brand awareness and demand for MGS Ghee we started a facility in Cherlapally, Hyderabad to scale up our production and meet the increasing demands of our customers from across the country.\n\nAs demand for MGS Ghee increased, we began manufacturing and packaging our ghee in bottles to make it easier for our customers to store and use ghee on a daily basis."
