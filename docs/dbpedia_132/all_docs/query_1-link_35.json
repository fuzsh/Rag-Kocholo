        "text": "1. I was badly suffering from Ear pain ( Fungal infection) and the pain was unbearable. Dr. Srinath could understand my problem and gave me right treatment which gave immediate relief. Till date no pain.\n\n2. For any patient, right treatment is very very critical and important and for that we need to see a Doctor who can treat you with utmost care and diligence.\n\nDr. Srinath will be first in the list when comes to ENT, honestly we have not seen a doctor like him he does his job with 100% dedication, he goes into micro level detailing to explain the case in very well manner so that patient understood what is the exact situation. I strongly recommend Srinath for ENT.\n\nUnlike other doctors, he gives complete and optimum time to the patient and listens to the issues with utmost care.\n\n****** ************** experienced, and very friendly, I strongly suggest visiting once to Dr .V.S.Srinath for all your ENT issues. He treats general medical issues as well as he has vast experience.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr. Srinath for your ENT and other general health-related problems. He is approachable, talks politely with patients, gives them time to clarify their issues, and spends sufficient time with patients for the right diagnosis. He has a lot of experience, and the medication he has given me for my health problems has always worked."
