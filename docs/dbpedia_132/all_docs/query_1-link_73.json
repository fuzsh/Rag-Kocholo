It's part of the same group that has its big hotel opposite to Reshmi's Dhaba in parklane. Cant recall the name now\n\nTheir lunch buffet is Rs.299 AI from Mon-Sun. But, due to a snapdeal voucher, I paid 199 AI/head\n\nPlace is small and situated in a dungeon kind of place ( basement) but, the ambience is lovely and is upmarket\n\nWelcome drink of some green mocktail. Lovely !\n\nSoups were very good\n\n2 NV Snack. Kebab was delicious, chinese starter was hard and tough\n\nVeg starters were better than NV starters\n\nThey had 3 cold NV salads. One of them was grilled chicken salad which was one of the most delicious salad I had in a long time.\n\nLive counter with Dosas, Pasta, Lasagna's etc. Ordered one cream based pasta. Yuck !\n\nBreads were very good and went well with Methi Chicken\n\nMutton Biryani was excellent as it was fresh and had an awesome flavour with masalas deeply rooted into the meat.\n\nDessert was Fruit Truffle and Chamcham. Both were delectable\n\nThey had a horde of other dishes for veggies and didnt try any of them.\n\nOverall, a VFM place for good food experience.\n\nSaturday Dinner was BC Rolls. Ordered 6-7 of them and except the egg roll which i was eating for the first time which was bland and sweetish. All others were excellent.\n\nI had a Sheek Kebab Roll and would rate this LOWER than the Mutton Tikka Kebab Roll.\n\nP.S: I passed by Quiznos last night around 930pm and it looks fabulous from outside. Perched on an incline gives it a high hat look. Going by the reviews I dont think i am going to step in there ever. I am not the one who pays 200 bucks for a measly sub. I can enjoy Sub of the day in my office for a special price of Rs.55\n\nLast edited by mobike008 : 29th August 2011 at 15:46.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2009\n\nLocation: TrafficJamaBad earlier known as Hyd\n\nPosts: 750\n\nThanked: 238 Times\n\nre: A Guide: Eating out in Hyderabad/Secunderabad/Cyberabad\n\nSaturday is the day, I generally look forward to. Not because, its a weekend, but because its the day I venture out to have some great food and experiment.\n\nMast Kalandar\n\nThis Saturday was none the less more adventurous. Ventured out with Wifey after a long time and was loitering around Gachibowli area, when we planned to hit Mast Kalandar as I always loved the Veg Kebab Platter there. Loved it everytime I had it. Many people here would be surprised to see me speak about Veg Food, but this is one dish, I would love to eat.\n\nAccompanied by my 2 month old baby, I was sure that we would not be dining in at Mast Kalandar, hence got Take Away of The Great Indian Maha Combo, Full Full Biryani Combo and Jumbo Kebab Platter.\n\nOverall bill about 450/- something, but loved every morsel of the food served. The Take Away were packed properly in a pre-packed platter and was easy to carry without a single drop of it leaking out.\n\nWhat I loved most was the MASALA CHAAS, which was heavenly. Ive had a good Chaas after a very long time and would surely love to go back for more. If someone loves Shikanjee, then this is the place to go.\n\nThe Gulab Jamuns were totally avoidable. Ive never tasted anywhere, Gulab Jamuns better than the ones served at Haveli, Begumpet.\n\nPaaya, Haleem and etc at Shadab\n\nI had to purify myself for the SIN Ive committed in the morning. Headed to Charminar, scouting for good aromatic and tasty food. Been thinking of having some good Nihaari for the last couple of days and Saturday was the day, I could let myself lose on old city and do the honors.\n\nThe evening, which started with a simple plan of Nihaari turned out to be an extravagant dining experience. Headed to Shadab for their signature Paaya aka Nalli Shorba or Nalli Nihaari. In Hyderabad, it is called as PAAYA. There were many other things on offering like Zubaan (Tongue), Jabda (Jaws) and etc.\n\nReached Shadab and ended up ordering Haleem first as Abhijeet (FleetMaster) could not have Haleem last time during the Haleem Meet. Hence, Haleem was the first dish to be ordered followed by Paaya and closing the deal with a glass of Falooda.\n\nPost the dinner siesta, we headed towards various other areas in Old City to meet some friends and etc.\n\nButter Dosa\n\nLanded at Ravis Butter Dosa Outlet for a small session of Butter Dosas at Ravis outlet. Even though being a Push Cart Joint, the overflowing crowd at his outlet is the proof that some of the best foods are served at these Make Shift Venues.\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2006\n\nLocation: Seattle, WA\n\nPosts: 11,787\n\nThanked: 15,362 Times\n\nre: A Guide: Eating out in Hyderabad/Secunderabad/Cyberabad\n\nYesterday there was an impromptu call for lunch treat by Shyamal ( non-tbhpian) for a Gujarati Thali at Shyam Nivas which is in a lane diagonally opposite to KFC at M.G Road enjoyed by :-\n\nMobike008+1\n\nShyamal\n\nMilecruncher+1\n\nHillram + 2\n\nTheir Thali is priced at Rs.95 on Sunday's and is really a nice simple way to relish the gujju experience. Everything unlimited. 4 types of breads (Phulaks, Jowar, Bajra, Poori)\n\nAssorted veg curries out of which i loved the Gatte Ki Sabji which is actually a rajasthani curry. Delicious\n\nDal was bland and tasteless\n\nDessert was Shrikhand and it was one of the most delicous that I had after the one made at home by my mom.\n\nWe wanted to takeaway but, they ran out of it. Great place for a gujju meal and dont count calories when you go there as they keep serving in passion and all rotis are nicely ghee laden.\n\n-----------------------XX------------------------------\n\nYesterday evening decided to pay a visit to Royal Haleem Center which has been raved about here so much. They are situated in HH lane on Rd.No.3 Banjara Hills.\n\nHe quoted Rs.60 for a plate. I told him I want less quantity one, so he gave me Rs.40 plate one. Sidey !\n\nFirst few spoonfuls were terrible. Some liquid floating on top and when I dug into the haleem the lower portions had some decent chicken chunks and tasted quite nice.\n\nFinal Verdict : That tasting session reconfirmed my belief. Haleem has to be Mutton, no two ways about it. I wanted to taste chicken haleem once, I did that. But, I dont think i am going to ever eat that again.\n\nLast edited by mobike008 : 29th August 2011 at 16:05.\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2006\n\nLocation: Seattle, WA\n\nPosts: 11,787\n\nThanked: 15,362 Times\n\nre: A Guide: Eating out in Hyderabad/Secunderabad/Cyberabad\n\nLast evening from RHC, we drove down to \"Over the Flames\" on the Gachibowli road.\n\nIts a small place in a basement below MORE supermarket.\n\nWe ordered for following :\n\nSpicy Chicken Salad ( Rs.50)\n\nCrunchy and generous amount of chicken in it. And, very good quantity. Excellent is the word for this salad\n\nPoultry Pizza ( 10\")....(Rs.150)\n\nThis is one of their most popular thin crust pizza and irrespective of which size ( 10\", 12\", 14\") you order it comes with 6 pieces\n\nIt had generous does of Mozerrela cheese and chicken toppings with additional topping of Chicken Salami. One of the best pizzas that i enjoyed in a while\n\nVeg Lasagnia ( Rs.80)\n\nCreamy Cheese topping with flat pasta ( Fettucini?). Dangerously delicious\n\nTiramitsu ( Rs.50)\n\nA small piece of this famous dessert. Very nice\n\nTotal Damages : Rs.343 ( Just 4% VAT is added). It's a great place for Italian food. I will now go regularly to this place. Thanks Rajesh for sharing this place's info.\n\nHad a long chat with the owner ( Paresh) and he is planning to extend as response since he started ( 8 months ago) has been overwhelming it seems. In a couple of months, he is starting a mobile pizzerria\n\nPoultry Pizza ( 10\")\n\nVeg Lasagna\n\nMenu Card\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2006\n\nLocation: Seattle, WA\n\nPosts: 11,787\n\nThanked: 15,362 Times\n\nre: A Guide: Eating out in Hyderabad/Secunderabad/Cyberabad\n\nAs Haleem season is coming to an end. As part of our adieu plan, the following bhpians met last evening for another bout of haleem session\n\nMobike008\n\nMilecruncher\n\nHillram\n\nTraveloholic\n\n1st Pit Stop : Hyline Bakery, Gunfoundry. This was one of the best haleems that i tasted this season. Ghee was dripping from all corners and meat was smooth and flavoursome. However, it was almost devoid of any masalas. I really liked it. Hyline should be in Top 5, if not Top 3\n\n2nd Pit Stop : Sarvi, Mehdipatnam. What to say! Mindblowing haleem. Consistent in all ingredients and when compared to Hyline, you can feel heavy doses of spices in this version\n\n3rd Pit Stop : Shahghouse, Toli Chowki. We reached there around 10:30pm and to our aghast, haleem ran out and there was a waiting of 45mins for it to come from their Shalibanda branch. We decided to chuck it and head back.\n\nA mindboggling trivia from Shahghouse\n\nYesterday from 4:00pm to 9:30pm they sold 25 Handi's of Haleem\n\n1 Handi : 1200 Plates\n\nDo the math. That's a Rs.24 Lakhs counter in < 6 hours\n\nWe split here and Traveloholic and myself decided to make a final pitstop at Cafe Bahar in Hyderguda\n\nWe ordered :-\n\nMurg Mussalam ( Rs.160)\n\nSweet, Creamish and Horrible stuff.\n\nMutton Biryani with Double Meat (Rs. 250)\n\nThey got this fresh out of the handi and it was one of the worst biryani that i ever had in my life.\n\nCooked with normal rice, tough as nail meat pieces and seemed more like the pulao you get in Sandarshini type of outlets. Between us we had 1/4th and quit.\n\nTonight, its going to be madness in old city and we'll all be there to say \"Adieu to Ramzan\" and more importantly to Haleem"
