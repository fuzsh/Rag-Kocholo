Click on the location name in the left section to view the respective map in right section. About Indian Pin Codes: Indian Pincodes are 6 digit numeric zip codes which are clubbed together by location. Unlike many other countries, Indian pin codes do not contain alphabets. Writing proper codes ensures a smooth and faster delivery of your post. It is always recommended to write pin codes with your recipient's address. There are many locations like Rampur, Nagpur, which are multiple locations with same name. So, writing exact pin code demystifies the ambiguity from address."
