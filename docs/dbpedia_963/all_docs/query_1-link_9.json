        "text": "Entering the Park on Skyline Drive\n\nYou can enter Shenandoah with your vehicle at only four places along Skyline Drive:\n\nFront Royal Entrance Station (mile 0) by Rt. 66 and 340 in Front Royal, Virginia.\n\nThornton Gap Entrance Station (mile 31.5) by Rt. 211 near Luray, Virginia.\n\nSwift Run Gap Entrance Station (mile 65.5) by Rt. 33 near Elkton, Virginia.\n\nRockfish Gap Entrance Station (mile 104.6) by Rt. 64 and Rt. 250 (also the northern entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway).\n\nDon't rely on GPS to navigate to Shenandoah National Park, as it can be incorrect. Instead, follow these directions to each entrance station. If there are no staff at the entrance stations when you first arrive at the Park, you may proceed into the Park and pay your fee when you exit. Remember, your fee dollars go towards projects that have direct benefits for the visitors!\n\nMileposts\n\nAs you travel along Skyline Drive you will notice mileposts on the west side of the road (right side if you are traveling south, left if you are heading north). These cement posts help you find your way through the Park and help you locate areas of interest. The miles begin at 0 in Front Royal and continue to 105 at the southern end of the Park. The largest developed area, Big Meadows, is near the center of the Park, at mile 51. All Park maps and information use these mileposts as a reference.\n\nSpeed Limit\n\nThe speed limit is 35 mph in most places, so feel free to roll down your windows, feel the breeze, and experience every curve and turn of this beautiful drive. Deer, black bear, wild turkey, and a host of other woodland animals call Shenandoah home and regularly cross Skyline Drive in their daily travels. Watch carefully for these animals who may dart across your path without warning. If you want a closer look, be sure to pull completely off the road and stay in your vehicle.\n\nGas and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations\n\nOptions are limited for filling up your car, so be sure to plan accordingly. Find out more information about gas and charging stations.\n\nRVs, Campers, and Horse Trailers"
