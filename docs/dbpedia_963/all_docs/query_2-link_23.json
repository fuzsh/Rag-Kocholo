        "text": "Many kinds of units of measurements have been used indigenously in different places over different periods of time and new units have been introduced as and when needed. But the need for universal conformity gave birth to the standard system of measurements, what is known as the S.I. unit today.\n\nWhat is the S.I. Unit of Measurement?\n\nThe S.I. unit is actually an abbreviation of the French word “Système International”. The S.I. unit is the standard system of measurements which are universally accepted and used for technical publishing and scientific research.\n\nInternational System of Units\n\nEarlier, people didn't have measuring units to calculate the standard measurement units. So, they came up with unique ways of measurement with the tools which were available to them. The foot was used as a measurement for length. 1 foot was calculated as .\n\nTo solve the problem of different measurements, a common system of units called the international system of units was found and accepted. This is the modern version of the metric system. Though this system is now being used in all fields including science and technology, some people, especially in the USA, refer to length as foot and inches instead of centimetres.\n\nApart from the seven base units of measurement, some units are calculated based on one or more base units. These units are known as derived units.\n\nExamples of such units are\n\nPower: watt (W)\n\nFrequency: hertz (Hz)\n\nThere are seven base units measurements namely meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela.\n\n(Image will be uploaded soon)\n\nThe most common among these are kilograms, seconds, and meters.\n\nWhy are Standard Units Used in Measurement?\n\nStandard units are used in measurement for more accuracy. The measurement should be the same for all. As there needs to be uniformity in the measurement, we must have a common set of units in measurement. These are called standard units.\n\nThe standard unit is different for different quantities.\n\nWhat is a Standard Unit of Measurement?\n\nThe standard unit of measurement is a value that is fixed and cannot be changed. It is needed to have uniformity in measurement. The measurement is measured as feet, inches, and pounds in the United States and meters, centimetres, and kilograms in the metric system.\n\nStandard vs Non-Standard Measurements\n\nThere are two types of measurements, namely Standard and non-Standard.\n\nStandard measurement units are those which are used within the measurement system such as ounces, inches, and pounds.\n\nThe Advantages of Standard Unit are:\n\nIt helps everyone to understand measurements in a set of unit systems.\n\nSI units are derived from one another without the use of conversion\n\nSI is a metric system. The disadvantages are that the SI unit talks only about one unit. Hence other units' importance was diluted.\n\nNonstandard measurement units are those which are not used like a pencil, arm, and block.\n\nThe advantage of Nonstandard measurement is it makes measurement easier while the disadvantage is it might be tough for many to understand.\n\nAdvantage of SI Units\n\nSI units are measured all over the world.\n\nThere is only one unit for each quantity.\n\nSubmultiples and multiples can be expressed as multiples of ten as it is a metric system\n\nMeasurement of Physical Quantities\n\nA physical quantity is the property of an object that can be measured. Examples of physical quantities are the mass of a body or the length of an object. There are two types of physical quantities namely base quantities and derived quantities.\n\nBase quantities are length, mass, time, luminous intensity, temperature, current, and amount of substance\n\nDerived quantities are those which are derived from other physical quantities. Ex acceleration, velocity, and force.\n\nSI Unit Prefixes\n\nThe SI system uses a standard system of prefixes to the basic units which makes it more relevant.\n\nPrefixes are used to identify the fractions Ir multiples of the basic unit. There are 20 acceptable prefixes.\n\nSI Base Units\n\nThese units of measurement are considered to be the fundamental units and all the other units can be derived from the SI base units.\n\nUnit of Mass (kilogram): Kilogram is defined by taking the fixed value of Planck’s constant in kilogram per meter square per second. It is abbreviated as kg.\n\nUnit of Length (Meter): Abbreviated as “m”, meter is defined by taking the value of speed of light in vacuum in meter per second.\n\nUnit of Time (Second): A second is defined as the value obtained by taking the value of each Cesium frequency. Its abbreviation is “s”.\n\nUnit of Electric Current (Ampere): Abbreviated as “A”, it is obtained by taking the fixed value of elementary charge.\n\nUnit of Temperature (Kelvin): Although Fahrenheit and Celsius are the more commonly used measurements of temperature, the SI unit of temperature is Kelvin, abbreviated as K. Its value is equal to the Boltzmann constant. 10C = 273 K.\n\nUnit of an Amount of Substance (Mole) : One mole contains 6.02214076×1023elementary entities which is the constant of Avogadro’s number and is expressed as mol-1.\n\nUnit of Luminous Intensity (Candela) : Defined by the fixed value of luminous efficacy, the SI unit of luminous intensity is candela and is expressed as “cd”.\n\nNote: The 7 base units are considered to be mutually independent from which the other units of measurement can be derived.\n\nThe derived SI units are unlimited and are in a continuous process of development resulting from scientific research and can be based either solely on the base units or they can be a combination of base units and other already established derived units.\n\nThere are a few additional SI units that are very commonly used in Physics, such as, “joule” which is the SI unit of heat and “Tesla” which is the SI unit of magnetic field.\n\nStudents are suggested to have a thorough understanding of these units in Physics and their dimensions.
