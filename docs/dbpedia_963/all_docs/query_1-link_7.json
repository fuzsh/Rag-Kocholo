        "text": "The standard 20-foot container or âdry vanâ is one of the most commonly-used containers for the shipment of goods in ocean freight along with the 40-foot container.Our cubic meter calculator will let you know the exact space needed for your cargo.\n\nDimensions of the 20-foot container\n\nThe 20-foot containerâs dimensions are usually measured using the imperial system (feet) and specifies both the exterior dimensions and the interior (usable) dimensions.\n\nThe dimensions of a 20-foot container are:\n\nExterior Dimensions (in feet): 20â long x 8â wide x 8â 6â high\n\nExterior Dimensions (in meters): 6.10m long x 2.44m wide x 2.59m high\n\nInterior Dimensions (in feet): 19â 4â long x 7â 9â wide x 7â 10â high\n\nInternal Dimensions (in meters): 5.898m long x 2.352m wide x 2.393m high\n\nUsable Capacity: 32.6m3\n\nHow many pallets can fit into a 20-foot container?\n\nIn terms of Euro pallet types (European pallets) of which dimensions are 1.2m x 0.8m, the base of the 20-foot container can hold up to 11 Euro pallet stacks as long as the load is not hanging over the sides. Generally, the optimal way of fitting pallets inside the container is with one row along the length and another row along the width. More information.\n\nFor the standard American pallet type with dimensions 40â x 48â (1.016m x 1.219m), the base of a standard 20-foot container can hold 10 pallets as long as the load is not hanging over the sides. More information.\n\nVOLUME CALCULATOR\n\nQtyâ*\n\nLengthâ*\n\nWidthâ*\n\nHeightâ*\n\ncms\n\nâ\n\n=\n\n1\n\ncbm\n\nTotal Volume\n\nWhatâs the maximum load for a 20-foot container?\n\nA 20-foot containerâs unloaded weight is 2,300 kg and can, in theory, be loaded to a maximum weight of 28 tons (25,400kg). However, this would depend in large part on possible restrictions and/or limitations of the shipping line, the nature of the cargo and specific details of the shipment.\n\nYou may use our platform to find the best prices for your FCL or LCL shipping needs."
