It did not work well. My result is below.\n\nI encountered some problems, I would like\n\n1. to have a single y label\n\n2. to remove empty space on above graph region\n\n3. to make a long y parameter label >35 characters. I see the good example in Dr. Puhl's article published in PHN in Figure 3 at http://www.yaleruddcenter.org/resour...s_ijo_9.12.pdf\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nKun Susiloretni\n\nThe trick here is to work on the dataset -- perhaps here more of a resultsset, so-called -- so that your two panels can be produced using a by() option,\n\nYou might find Jann's -coefplot- package (SSC) useful. He's written a companion paper on the command that has many examples, some of which are similar to what you want.\n\nLooks good!\n\nTwo small suggestions:\n\n1. Think about losing the ticks on the y axis. It's not a numerical scale and you already have grid lines to guide the eye. (If that's difficult, an old trick is to set tick length to zero. The ticks are still there in principle, but at zero length they are hard to see. I learned this from Vince Wiggins.)\n\n2. Zap the note in the left-hand corner \"Graphs by ide\". Your readers won't care what your variable is called."
