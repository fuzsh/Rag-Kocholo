        "text": "A year on Earth is approximately 365 days. Why is that considered a year? Well, 365 days is about how long it takes for Earth to orbit all the way around the Sun one time.\n\nIt’s not exactly this simple though. An Earth year is actually about 365 days, plus approximately 6 hours. Read more about that here.\n\nAll of the other planets in our solar system also orbit the Sun. So, how long is a year on those planets? Well, it depends on where they are orbiting!\n\nPlanets that orbit closer to the Sun than Earth have shorter years than Earth. Planets that orbit farther from the Sun than Earth have longer years than Earth.\n\nThis happens for two main reasons.\n\nIf a planet is close to the Sun, the distance it orbits around the Sun is fairly short. This distance is called an orbital path.\n\nThe closer a planet travels to the Sun, the more the Sun’s gravity can pull on the planet. The stronger the pull of the Sun’s gravity, the faster the planet orbits.\n\nCheck out how long a year is on each planet below!\n\nWhy does NASA care about years on other planets?\n\nNASA needs to know how other planets orbit the Sun because it helps us travel to those planets! For example, if we want a spacecraft to safely travel to another planet, we have to make sure we know where that planet is in its orbit. And we also have to make sure we don’t run into any other orbiting objects — like planets or asteroids — along the way.\n\nScientists who study Mars also need to keep a Martian calendar to schedule what rovers and landers will be doing and when."
