        "text": "Share this post\n\nGetting to grips with rugby union pitch dimensions and markings can be difficult at first. The range of acceptable dimensions for rugby pitches is fairly wide, whilst the various solid and dashed lines you see around the field can be confusing for those who are new to the sport.\n\nIn this blog we will address:\n\nPitch dimensions\n\nPitch markings\n\nPost dimensions and other considerations\n\nRUGBY UNION PITCH DIMENSIONS\n\nRugby union pitches feature several different areas:\n\nThe field of play refers to the area within the touchlines and between the try lines\n\nThe area within the touchlines and between the dead-ball lines is the playing area\n\nThe entire field including the playing area and perimeter is the playing enclosure\n\nThe boundary outside the touchlines is the perimeter area\n\nWith rugby union pitches, the field of play is typically 100m long from try line to try line and 70m wide. Beyond these try lines, are the in-goal areas where players can score tries, adding 6-22m at either end of the playing area. In total, the playing area is around 7,208-10,080 sq m.\n\nARE ALL RUGBY PITCHES THE SAME SIZE?\n\nThere is a range of acceptable dimensions for a rugby union pitch: the length of the field of play can vary between 94-100m, whilst the width can range from 68-70m. As we touched on above, the in-goal area at either end can be between 6 and 22m in length.\n\nLENGTH OF A RUGBY PITCH\n\nConsidering just the field of play, the length of a rugby pitch is 94-100m. If we take into account the in-goal areas as well, the full playing area varies in length between 106 and 144m.\n\nWIDTH OF A RUGBY PITCH\n\nThe width of a rugby pitch ranges from 68-70m, with less room for variation due to the tactical significance of pitch width in the game.\n\nTHE PERIMETER AREA\n\nIn rugby union, the perimeter of the pitch houses technical areas. These provide space for substitutes, training staff, and the sin bin.\n\nMost rugby union pitches leave at least a metre between the touchlines and any technical areas, avoiding any collisions in the event that a player comes off the field at speed. As a general rule and as per World Rugby regulations, the perimeter should be at least 5m wide to prevent injuries.\n\nWHAT IS THE MINIMUM SIZE OF A RUGBY PITCH?\n\nThe minimum length of the playing area of a rugby union pitch is 106m, with at least 94m from try line to try line and an extra 6m each for the two in-goal areas. As we know, the width must be no less than 68m, making a total minimum playing area of 7,208 sq m.\n\nRUGBY UNION PITCH MARKINGS\n\nRugby union pitch markings consist of solid lines, dashed lines, and crosses.\n\nWHAT ARE THE MARKINGS ON A RUGBY PITCH?\n\nFor rugby union pitches, there are several types of solid line markings:\n\nThe touchlines, which run along the edge of the field\n\nThe try lines at either end of the field of play on\n\nThe dead-ball lines at either end of the playing area\n\nThe halfway line in the middle of the pitch\n\nThe 22-metre lines (as the name suggests, these are 22m away from the try lines)\n\nThere are also dashed line markings to indicate distances from the main solid lines, including:\n\nDashed lines positioned 5 and 15m away from the touchlines on either side, running the length of the pitch\n\nTwo dashed lines running across the pitch, 10m either side of the halfway line\n\nTwo dashed lines running across the pitch at either end, 5m from the try line\n\nIn addition to these lines, there is also a cross at the centre of the pitch. At kick-off, the player kicking the ball stands here.\n\nRUGBY PITCH MARKINGS EXPLAINED\n\nNow that you understand where all of the markings should be positioned, it’s time to learn about their purposes.\n\nLine Purpose Touchlines The touchlines on rugby union pitches run from dead-ball line to dead-ball line and mark the outer boundary of the playing area. If a player crosses these solid lines whilst carrying the ball, the gameplay is stopped and the other team is awarded a lineout to get the ball back into play. Try lines There are two solid try lines at either end of a rugby union pitch. To score a try during the game, a player must carry the ball over the try line and touch it on the ground within the in-goal area. Dead-ball lines The two solid lines right at each edge mark the end of the playing area. If a player carries the ball over the dead-ball line by the attacking team, the defending team is awarded a 22-metre drop-out (see 22-metre lines below). Halfway line The solid halfway line runs across the pitch in the middle. At kick-off, the ball is kicked into the opposing team’s half by a player who stands at the central cross on the halfway line. 22-metre lines The solid lines 22 metres out from each try line are used in the event of a 22-metre drop-out, where a player kicks the ball into the opposing half from on or behind their 22-metre line. During open play, a player can choose to kick the ball into touch if they are behind their 22-metre line, resulting in a lineout at the point where the ball crosses the touchline. Dashed lines The various dashed lines indicate the distance from the touchlines (5 and 15m), the try lines (5m), and the halfway line (10m):\n\nAt kick-off, the team receiving the ball must stand behind their dashed 10m line.\n\nScrums can’t take place within 5m of the try lines or touchlines, so the 5m dashed markings help to prevent this from happening.\n\nThe 15m line is used for line-outs (if the ball crosses this line, open play resumes).\n\nPOST DIMENSIONS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\nRugby posts are placed in the centre of the try line at either end of the field of play. Unlike the length and width of the pitch itself, the distance between the two posts must be exactly 5.6m – both posts must be at least 3.4m high, although some will be higher than this.\n\nHOW FAR ABOVE THE GROUND IS THE TOP EDGE OF THE CROSSBAR?\n\nThe top edge of the crossbar must be 3m above the ground. As with the distance between the posts, the rules state that this is an exact measurement: the crossbar cannot be any lower or higher than 3m for professional-level games.\n\nRugby posts are standardised in this way because of the important role that goal kicks play in rugby union – to score a goal kick, a player must kick the ball through the upright posts above the crossbar, so it’s important that this goal area is always the same size.\n\nHOW MANY LAPS OF A RUGBY PITCH IS A MILE?\n\nOne mile is equivalent to 1609 metres. If we consider the entire playing area and take into account the acceptable variations in pitch dimensions, then you would have run a mile in roughly four laps around the pitch.\n\nHOW BIG IS A RUGBY PITCH COMPARED TO A FOOTBALL PITCH?\n\nThe FA recommends that adult football clubs in the national league system should play on football pitches that are 100m in length by 64m in width. This means that rugby union pitches are between 4 and 6m wider than football pitches.\n\nIn terms of length, the field of play between the try lines could be between 94-100m, so is shorter than a standard football pitch. That said, if you take into account the full playing area including the in-goal zone, rugby pitches are much longer at 106 to 144m.\n\nHOW MANY FLAGS ARE ON A RUGBY PITCH?\n\nThere are 14 flags on a rugby pitch (see the diagram below). Four of these flags sit at the junction of the try lines and touchlines, whilst another four are positioned at the point where the dead-ball lines meet the touchlines. The remaining six flags are placed where the halfway line and 22-metre lines cross the touchlines.\n\nHopefully this guide has taught you everything you need to know about rugby union pitch dimensions, markings, and posts.
