        "text": "Guidelines to Authors on Figure Preparation\n\n1. Figure preparation\n\nFigures are a very important part of an article. Consequently, they should be designed with great care and presented in the best possible quality. While we do not require high-resolution figures for the review process, a high image resolution is important for production of your accepted article. Therefore, we usually ask for high-resolution figures towards the end of the review process.\n\n2. Figure size\n\nWhen planning figures, take into account the page size of our journals:\n\nType area = 169 x 225 mm, column width = 81 mm, gutter width: 7 mm\n\nThough the final size of your image will be determined by one of our typesetters, you can pre-estimate it:\n\nsingle panel figure (with less text) → 81 mm width\n\nsingle panel figure (with more text or insets) → 105 mm width\n\ntwo panel figure (horizontally aligned) → 169 mm width\n\ntwo panel figure (vertically aligned) → 81 mm width\n\nmultiple panel figure → 169 mm width\n\n3. Characteristics\n\nIf several figures are of similar style, characteristics such as font type, font size and line thickness should be kept consistent. Texts should not overlap and should be clearly visible/readable.\n\nFont family: Inter-Research fonts for images are Helvetica and Times New Roman. A sans serif font such as Helvetica/Arial is preferred.\n\nFont size: Around 8–9 pt at final figure size. A guideline size is that upper-case letters should be about 2–4 mm high.\n\nColour: Good quality colour images are welcome. Inter-Research subsidises colour printing costs; no charge is made to authors, provided that the use of colour is appropriate.\n\n4. Figure file requirements\n\nPlease submit only figures generated from the source program. Please note that the .jpg/.jpeg file format suffers from quality loss upon opening and saving and, therefore, should be avoided where possible.\n\nReview: File types supported by our editorial management system Manuscript Manager which can be submitted during review are: .tiff, .tif, .png, .eps, .pdf; both .jpeg, .jpg, are accepted but not recommended (see above)\n\nProduction: File requirements for your accepted articles: Vectorised file formats (EPS) are preferred over rasterised file formats (TIFF). See table below for output options.\n\nResolution: Rasterised images should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi at final (print) size and must be free of jpeg compression. Simply increasing the resolution (e.g. interpolating via Adobe Photoshop) of an existing low-resolution figure-file is not sufficient, as no new information is created.\n\n5. Suitable file formats\n\nDuring review editable source files should only be submitted in pdf, eps or tif [LZW compression] format. Other editable source file formats may be provided after acceptance upon request of the production team. Please refer to the list below for different file format options for a range of commonly used graphic programs. For further questions please contact (IR Techinfo).\n\nProgram File format Microsoft Excel PDF (if possible), XLS(X) Adobe Illustrator EPS, PDF, SVG, EMF, SWP, MWF, AI Adobe Photoshop TIFF (LZW compression with layers), PSD Matlab EPS, PDF, TIFF (-dtiff') SigmaPlot EPS, PDF, TIFF (LZW compression) Canoco AI PRIMER-E EPS R (use RStudio) EPS, PDF, SVG, TIFF Microsoft PowerPoint PDF (if possible), PPT, PPTX OceanData View EPS, TIFF GIMP TIFF (LZW compression), SVG (if available) Inkscape EPS, PDF, SVG, EMF ArcGIS EPS, PDF, SVG, EMF, TIFF (LZW compression) QGIS PDF, SVG GRASS GIS EPS, SVG, PDF DeltaGraph EPS, PDF, PSD KaleidaGraph TIFF (with high resolution option), EPS MagicPlot Pro PDF, EPS, SVG, EMF GraphPad Prism TIFF (LZW compression), EPS JMP Pro EPS, PDF, SVG, TIFF SPSS EPS, EMF, TIFF Stata PDF, EPS Mathematica EPS, PDF, SVG, EMF GNU Octave EPS, PDF, SVG Origin, Origin Pro EPS, PDF, TIFF, EMF gnuplot EPS, PDF, SVG GeoDa PNG, SVG, PS\n\n6. Permissions\n\nIt is the responsibility of an author to ensure that the necessary reproduction rights for third party material used within a manuscript have been secured prior to submission. Copyright permissions must be obtained and, if necessary, paid for by the author. Copyright of third party material must be acknowledged according to the copyright holder's requirements. Note that the responsibility to keep the permanent record of the reproduction license falls on the person requesting the permission, not on the copyright holder issuing it. Authors must be able to provide proof of the license to Inter-Research if requested."
