        "text": "Introduction\n\nDynamic studies of isometric and plantarflexion contraction in skeletal muscle using cine-MRI or velocity-encoded phase contrast (VE-PC) MRI have revealed several aspects of muscle deformation that require further exploration [1–4]. The muscle force-length (F-L) relationship is well established and describes the dependence of the steady-state isometric force of a muscle (fiber, or sarcomere) as a function of muscle (fiber, sarcomere) length and it has been explained by the ‘sliding filament’ theory [5–7]. In this theory, the maximal isometric force of a sarcomere is determined by the amount of overlap between the contractile filaments, actin, and myosin [6]. At short lengths, force increases as sarcomere length increases (ascending slope), reaches a plateau at intermediate lengths (optimal length for maximum force production), followed by a decrease in force as sarcomere length increases (descending slope) at long muscle lengths. Muscle fiber architecture (fiber length and pennation angle) clearly influences force production. A study of this structure-function relationship in-vivo will reveal aspects of force production that can be used to understand muscle physiology in normal and in diseased states and to develop optimal exercise paradigms for rehabilitation or to maximize athletic performance [8–10]. The medial gastrocnemius (MG) force-length relationship can be altered by changing the knee joint position, ankle joint position, or both. The gastrocnemius muscle is biarticular and spans both the knee and ankle joints; thus, changes in one or both joint angles impact the resting MG muscle fiber architecture (length and pennation angle) and consequently, the force produced by the MG. Several groups have examined the force produced by the MG during isometric plantarflexion contraction for combinations of knee flexion and ankle positions [11–14]. Prior studies have used electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound (US) to study muscle isometric plantarflexion force, activation, and muscle fiber architecture changes in the MG for combinations of knee flexion and ankle angles [11–14]. These studies showed that while there were significant differences in fascicle length of the MG at rest for the different knee/ankle positions, these differences in length were not seen at a maximal isometric plantar flexion contraction (100% Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC)) and the EMG activity of the biarticular MG during the MVC decreased at a pronounced flexed knee-joint position despite the fact there were no differences in MG fascicle length at maximum plantarflexion contraction [12]. The authors concluded that the decrease in EMG activity of the MG at pronounced knee flexed positions is due to a critical force–length potential of all three muscles of the triceps surae [12].\n\nThe force produced by contracting muscle fibers is transmitted to bones via two passive structures: the aponeurosis and the tendon. These tendinous tissues play an important role as series-elastic-components and can store elastic energy during the movement [3, 15, 16]. The VE-PC technique showed that the strain was heterogeneous with both the deep and superficial aponeurosis exhibiting positive and negative strains along the muscle length [3]. The authors hypothesized that the observed aponeuroses strain may be linked to the distribution and orientation of the forces generated by the muscle fibers [3]. The heterogeneity of fiber length and pennation angle in the proximo-distal direction of the MG may cause nonuniformity of fiber shortening with corresponding changes in regional aponeurosis strain. It is thus likely that, since varying the ankle angle leads to different muscle fiber architecture, it will not only affect muscle fiber strain but also the associated aponeuroses strains. Earlier studies focused on EMG activity and fiber lengths in the MG at rest and during activity at different knee flexion and ankle angles but did not measure muscle fiber and aponeurosis strain at varying ankle angles [12–14]. Velocity-encoded Phase-contrast (VE-PC) MR imaging has been successfully implemented to study muscle kinematics under different contraction paradigms [3, 4, 17, 18]. In the VE-PC method, bipolar magnetic field gradients are applied along one or more spatial directions sensitizing moving spins while refocusing static spins. The resulting phase images of this sequence are directly proportional to the velocity of the moving spins and indirectly proportional to the magnitude of the bipolar gradient. The final phase images are processed to directly provide the velocity values of the moving spins. With the appropriate choice of the bipolar gradient strength to sensitize to the anticipated range of muscle velocities during a dynamic paradigm, the VE-PC method can be ideally customized to the measurement of muscle fiber and aponeurosis motion. The current study focuses on determining the strain in the MG muscle fiber and in the deep and superficial aponeuroses at different ankle angles and with different loads. Dynamic images of the calf muscle were acquired with the foot positioned at plantarflexed, neutral, and dorsiflexed ankle angles and at two different loads corresponding to 25% and 50% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), with MVC determined at each foot position. Further, earlier work using dynamic MRI identified the muscle fiber direction by the fascicles on water suppressed images [4]. The fascicles are visualized as higher intensity on the water suppressed images due to the presence of fat deposited adjacent to the fascicles. However, especially in younger subjects, the fascicles are not always visualized consistently since there is little or no fat adjacent to the fascicles in these subjects. The current paper explores an alternate way to extract regional muscle fiber direction using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) without the additional complexity of fiber tractography. Diffusion tensor imaging provides information on the underlying anisotropy in tissue microstructure and has been extensively applied to map white matter fibers in the brain as well as skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers [19, 20]. DTI derived fiber architecture have been validated by comparison to manual digitization of the same muscle [21]. Of relevance to the current paper, DTI provides the direction of muscle fibers at the voxel level and this feature is used in the current paper to extract the average fiber direction in a regions-of-interest of the MG. The hypotheses are (i) that MG fiber strain will be lowest in the dorsiflexed ankle position while producing the largest force at this ankle angle, (ii) fiber strains will deviate the most from linearity with %MVC in the plantarflexed position, and (iii) MG aponeurosis strain patterns will vary with the ankle angle reflecting the influence of fiber architecture.\n\nResults\n\nshows the ankle angle measurements determined from large FOV sagittal slices. shows the fibers identified by the average of the lead eigenvector method for the proximal, middle, and distal regions of the MG for each % MVC and ankle angle for one subject; the fibers are superposed on high-resolution water saturated fast-spin echo images. The orientation of the fibers is as expected for the MG and follows the direction of fascicles. Supplemental Video V1 shows the video of the fibers with the motion of the fiber end points tracked through the dynamic cycle for one subject for the two %MVCs and at the three ankle angles.\n\ndepicts the changes in fiber angle, length and strain as a function of the contraction cycle for one subject. lists the mean and standard deviation of MVC, peak force, fiber strain, and normalized fiber strain for each foot position and % MVC. lists the median and interquartile range of fiber architecture at rest and at peak contraction. The peak strain was significantly lower at the lower %MVC (p = 0.002) and while peak strain was the lowest in the dorsiflexed position, it was not significantly different from other two ankle angles ( ). Further, fiber strain changed significantly between 25 and 50%MVCs in the dorsiflexed (p = 0.004) and neutral (p = 0.034) positions but not in the plantarflexed position ( ). As (ankle angle * force) interaction was significant for strain normalized to force, simple main effects are reported for strain normalized to force. At both 50%MVC and 25% MVC, strain normalized to force was significantly different between each pairwise combination of ankle angles ( ). At 50%MVC the p-values for the differences in normalized strain between ankle angles were the following: D-N (p = 0.022), D-P (p = 0.004), N-P (p = 0.012) and corresponding values at 25%MVC were p = 0.037, 0.012, 0.016 respectively. The absolute value of the normalized strain was lowest at the dorsiflexed position at 50% MVC while the highest normalized strain was at the plantarflexed position at 25% MVC ( ). Comparing the normalized strain at 50 and 25% MVC at each ankle angle showed that significant changes with %MVC was only seen in the P ankle position (p = 0.029). The absolute value of normalized strain at 25% MVC was significantly higher than at 50% MVC for the P ankle angle. Significant differences were seen in the resting fiber length between D-P (p < 0.001) and D-N (p = 0.023) and in resting pennation angle between D-P (p = 0.029) while a trend was observed in D-N (p = 0.059) and N-P (p = 0.059) ( ). Resting fiber length decreased and pennation angle increased going from D to P ( ). Significant differences in fiber length at peak contraction were seen with force (p < 0.001) and with ankle angle: D-P (p < 0.001) and D-N (p < 0.001). Significant differences in pennation angle at peak contraction were seen with force (p < 0.001) and with ankle angle: D-N (p = 0.029) and D-P (p < 0.001). At peak contraction, fiber lengths decreased and pennation angles increased compared to corresponding values at rest.\n\nTable 1a\n\nAnkle Position% MVCMVC (N)Peak Force (N)1d Peak Strain1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d Strain / Force (1/N)D50%271.0 [48.7]131.0 [31.1]−0.1545 [0.0656]−0.0013 [0.0007]D25%271.0 [48.7]68.5 [15.7]−0.1029 [0.0466]−0.0015 [0.0007]N50%140.2 [29.2]71.9 [20.1]−0.2179 [0.0945]−0.0032 [0.0016]N25%140.2 [29.2]36.2 [10.4]−0.1539 [0.0774]−0.0045 [0.0025]P50%66.4 [20.5]31.6 [13.9]−0.2084 [0.0730]−0.0076 [0.0036]P25%66.4 [20.5]16.4 [7.4]−0.1742 [0.0694]−0.0123 [0.0061]\n\nTable 1b\n\nAnkle PositionMVCc Rest Angle (°)a, c, d Peak Contr.* Angle (°)a, c Rest Length (mm)a, c, d Peak Contr.* Length (mm)D50%32.2 [1.5]34.1 [3.3]42.6 [13.6]35.9 [11.4]D25%32.2 [1.5]33.4 [4.6]42.6 [13.6]38.8 [13.0]N50%33.3 [3.5]34.6 [7.3]34.5 [11.8]28.2 [10.7]N25%33.3 [3.5]33.2 [5.3]34.5 [11.8]32.0 [13.8]P50%35.1 [4.3]37.3 [5.7]29.0 [5.8]23.0 [6.2]P25%35.1 [4.3]36.6 [5.6]29.0 [5.8]25.2 [5.2]\n\nshows, for one subject, the schematic of the locations of the 11 points placed along the MG deep and superficial aponeuroses and the line segments connecting them at rest and at peak contraction. is box plot of the aponeurosis strain (estimated at peak force) in the 11 segments for the two %MVC and the three ankle angles averaged over the six subjects. Analysis of the strain comparing corresponding segments revealed no significant differences between the three ankle angles. Across all three ankle angles, aponeurosis strain was high at the distal and proximal regions of the muscle length and lowest in the middle where it was close to zero strain. The distal end of the deep aponeurosis showed small positive strains whereas the superficial aponeurosis revealed negative strains at the distal end. Further, for the superficial aponeurosis, the absolute value of strains at the distal segments were the highest among all the segments. The deep aponeurosis showed the highest negative strains in the proximal end, higher than strain values in the superficial aponeurosis. The motion of the segments along the aponeurosis during the contraction cycle is shown in Supplemental Video V2.\n\nAn exploratory analysis was also conducted to determine if the changes in MVC with ankle angle can be explained by the relative positions of the muscle (sarcomere) length on the F-L curve. To this end, the relative sarcomere length at different ankle angles was computed assuming a reference sarcomere length for the dorsiflexion ankle position. The reference value was chosen such that it was closer to the optimal sarcomere length for maximum force (on the F-L curve) since the dorsiflexor position generated the maximum force (compared to the other two ankle positions). A sarcomere length of 1.9 μm was assumed for the dorsiflexion ankle position; the choice of this reference sarcomere length in the D position was made to approximately follow the changes in MVC determined experimentally when going from D to N to P. For example, choosing a sarcomere length closer to the peak of the F-L curve (2.5 microns) resulted in much smaller changes in MVC as a function of the ankle angle than observed experimentally. Assuming a sarcomere length of 1.9 um for the D position and with the measured fiber length, the number of sarcomeres was computed. As the number of sarcomeres is not expected to change with ankle angle, the same sarcomere number was used to calculate the sarcomere length for muscle fiber length at rest and at 50% MVC ( ). shows the sarcomere lengths calculated from muscle fiber lengths at rest (black) and at 50%MVC (red) superposed on theoretical F-L relationship which was derived from data reported in [23, 24]. The rationale behind generating the plot shown in is that it allows one to estimate the change in MVC (with ankle angle position) from the F-L relationship since muscle fiber length (and consequently, the sarcomere length) changes with ankle angle. The plot shows the MVC that can be attained for muscle fiber lengths measured at rest for the three ankle angles and provides a qualitative explanation for the decrease in MVC when the ankle angle changes from D to N to P.\n\nTable 2\n\nAnkle PositionNumber of SarcomeresRest Sarcomere Length (μm)Rest Fiber Length (mm)Peak Contr.* Sarcomere Length (μm)Peak Contr.* Fiber Length (mm)D245261.946.61.639.8N245261.537.61.229.9P245261.433.21.126.6\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe specific objectives of this study are to implement a diffusion tensor imaging method to identify MG fibers and to map fiber strains using VE-PC MRI for submaximal isometric contraction with ankle angle held in dorsiflexion, neutral, and plantarflexion angles. The hypotheses are (i) that MG fiber strain will be lowest in the dorsiflexed ankle position while producing the largest force at this ankle angle, (ii) fiber strains will deviate the most from linearity with %MVC in the plantarflexed position, and (iii) MG aponeurosis strain patterns will vary with the ankle angle reflecting the influence of fiber architecture.\n\nPrior work used fascicles that were manually identified on water saturated anatomical images and the end points of these manually identified fibers were tracked through the dynamic cycle using the VE-PC data [4]. This method is limited in utility due to the difficulty of identifying fascicles especially in young subjects. The reason that fascicles have high contrast on water saturated images is the presence of fat adjacent to the fascicles; however, the fat layer is minimal in younger subjects making it difficult to view the fascicles. The method proposed here to identify fiber directions from the lead eigenvector of the DTI data is shown to be feasible. It should be noted that the proposed method does not involve muscle fiber tractography which would provide the most accurate estimate of the muscle fibers. However, accurate and robust fiber tracking requires DTI data with the highest SNR (single voxel accuracy of the lead eigenvector for fiber tracking). In contrast, the SNR requirements to accurately determine the average of the lead eigenvector in a ROI (27 pixels are higher) are lower [25]. The proposed method thus allows for short DTI acquisition times since it uses average data over fairly large ROIs (> 27 pixels). It should also be noted that a DTI scan is acquired at each ankle angle, so minimizing the acquisition time for DTI is important; each DTI scan is completed in ~ 7 minutes in the current work. The DTI scans also confirmed that the method for selecting the oblique sagittal slice yielded MG fibers primarily in the plane of the image.\n\nThe significant changes in MVC with ankle angle position in isometric contractions seen in the current study have been reported in earlier studies [12]. The dependence of the MG MVC on the ankle angle position is attributed to ankle dorsiflexion stretching the gastrocnemius and bringing it closer to its optimal length in the force-length curve, which contributes to knee flexion strength and knee joint stability, thereby enabling greater muscle force [12]. In all ankle positions, as anticipated, fiber length decreased and pennation angle increased at peak contraction compared to the values at rest. The current study also confirms US studies that showed fiber lengths and pennation angles to be significantly different between ankle positions at rest [12]. However, the current study also shows that significant changes in fiber length and pennation angle with ankle angle (between D-N and D-P) persisted at peak contraction contrary to US studies that found no significant differences in the fiber lengths and pennation angles at peak force [12]. This may reflect the fact that US studies were at 100% MVC whereas the current study was at submaximal isometric contractions (25 and 50% MVC).\n\nEMG activity of the MG has been reported to decrease during MVC for knee flexed positions and ankle angles at the more plantarflexed position [12]. The main mechanism postulated in Ref. 12 for decreasing EMG activity and impairment in neuromuscular transmission-propagation at short muscle lengths is a neural inhibition. This is hypothesized as being triggered as the muscle reaches a critical shortened length at which, due to the force-length relationship, the torque output cannot be increased even if the muscle is fully activated. The human control system gets feedback regarding the force potential due to the force-length relationship of all three muscles of the triceps surae and regulates their activity to increase the economy of maximal torque generation [12]. In contrast to the decrease in EMG activity at the more knee flexed/ plantarflexed ankle positions [12], fiber strain is higher at the P ankle position compared to the D ankle position in the current study (while MVC at D ankle angle MVC was higher than the MVC at P ankle angle). This points to the fact that the MG is inefficient in producing force in the plantarflexed ankle position; i.e., despite a larger contraction (strain) at the plantarflexed ankle position the force produced is smaller. The fact that the MG did not show decreased strains at the P ankle angle when going from 25 to 50% MVC indicates that it has not yet reached actively insufficiency at the P ankle angles of + 30° and submaximal isometric contraction used in the current study.\n\nFiber strains in the MG were lower (though it did not reach significance) in the D ankle position compared to the P and N position and significantly higher at 50% MVC than at 25% MVC in the D and N positions. The increased strain at higher %MVC in the D and N ankle positions is understandable as increased contraction is required to generate the higher forces. In contrast to D and N, the observation that the P ankle position did not show significant change in fiber strain with %MVC may indicate that the MG may be approaching the critical length where further contraction becomes more difficult. It is surprising that the fiber strains are lower in the D ankle position since in this ankle position, higher force is generated. It would be expected that the higher force in the D ankle angle will be accompanied by larger strains; the implication of the lower strains is that the D ankle angle position is ideal for force generation in that even small contractions (strains) are sufficient to generate large forces. Fiber strains normalized to force showed significant differences with ankle positions at both force levels. In comparing ankle positions, the D ankle position showed significantly lower normalized strains at both %MVCs than the N and P ankle positions; highlighting the fact that the D ankle position is at the optimum position for force production followed by N and the least optimal for the P ankle position. Smaller strains (contractions) are required to generate the same force at the dorsiflexed position than in the other two positions. Further, the absolute value of the normalized fiber strain was significantly higher at 25%MVC than at 50% MVC for the plantarflexed position. The latter finding is a reflection of strain not increasing significantly with %MVC in the P ankle position. It is likely that compared to the D and N positions, the contribution of the soleus to the total force increases in the P ankle position at higher %MVCs. The finding of lower strain and lower normalized strains in the dorsiflexed position while generating a high force should be of interest in rehabilitation paradigms, in optimizing athletic performance, and in minimizing strain injuries [26].\n\nIn terms of the aponeurosis strains during isometric contraction, ultrasound studies showed that the superficial and deep aponeuroses of medial gastrocnemius (MG) are uniformly stretched along their lengths in opposite directions; the superficial aponeurosis is stretched distally, whereas the deep aponeurosis is stretched proximally [27]. However, a study by Kinugasa et al. using the MR VE-PC technique revealed heterogeneous aponeurosis strain patterns: positive strain occurred at both ends (proximal and distal) of the deep aponeurosis and in the proximal region of the superficial aponeurosis while negative strain was observed in the middle region of the deep aponeurosis and in the distal region of the superficial aponeurosis [3]. Similar patterns of aponeurosis heterogeneity are also seen in the current study as in the earlier MR paper [3] if it is noted that the proximal most position of the current study is the third segment of the earlier study by Kinugasa et al. (the latter study started the segments at the distal end of the femur while the current study starts at the proximal end the tibia). Thus, the positive strain that was seen in the first two proximal segments of the deep and superficial aponeuroses in the earlier study is not seen in the current study. Contrary to the hypothesis, the strain patterns did not show significant differences between the three ankle positions.\n\nThe length of sarcomeres that are arranged in series within a striated muscle fiber is one of the most important determinants of muscle force [23]. As the ankle angle changes, the fibers of the MG and their constituent sarcomeres change length, which shifts the sarcomeres’ positions on the sarcomere force–length curve and affects the force-generating capacity of the muscle. It should be noted that the current study does not measure sarcomere length directly at any of the ankle angles but given the highest value of force at dorsiflexion position, this ankle position was assumed to closer to the optimum sarcomere length than the N or P positions. Further, once the sarcomere length for the dorsiflexion ankle angle position is chosen close to the optimum sarcomere length of the F-L curve, the current study shows that the sarcomere lengths of the MG at the other two ankle angles are positioned on the ascending limb of the F-L curve. This has also been observed in ultrasound and dynamometry studies of the soleus where it was shown that soleus acts on the ascending limb during active contractions [28]. It should be noted that the choice of the reference sarcomere length at 1.9 μm for the D position was dictated by considerations that the calculated sarcomere lengths at other ankle angles resulted in force decreases on the F-L curve close to that observed experimentally. Based on the F-L curve, the choice of the optimal sarcomere length of 2.65 μm (generates maximum force) severely underestimated the observed force decrease with ankle angle. In fact, even the reference value of 1.9 μm underestimates the force decreases with ankle angles.\n\nThese results potentially indicate that there may be other determinants of the observed force changes with ankle angle beyond changes in the sarcomere length. As the aponeurosis strains are not different between the ankle angles, this is not likely to contribute to the observed force changes. It should also be noted that while an isometric contraction implies no change in muscle length, it does not mean imply an unchanged muscle fiber length. As seen experimentally, muscle fiber contracts and rotates leading to sarcomere lengths at peak contraction shifting further down the ascending limb of the F-L curve. It is possible that the force potential is determined by an average of the rest and peak sarcomere length than just the rest sarcomere length. It is also likely that factors other than changes in sarcomere length may contribute to the measured force changes. It is important to emphasize that while the current method does not provide absolute values of sarcomere length, it allows relative changes in sarcomere length with ankle position to be estimated. That is, by fixing the sarcomere length at one reference point (the dorsiflexed ankle angle in the current study) one can estimate sarcomere lengths obtained from experimentally observed fiber lengths at rest and at peak contraction as a function of ankle position, and map these lengths on the F-L curve to determine whether the muscle is operating on the descending or the ascending limb of the force-length curve. The current study is focused on establishing the technical feasibility of muscle strain mapping combining DTI and velocity encoded dynamic data to determine the relationship of force and fiber strain to fiber architectural differences simulated by different ankle angles. Further studies are required to extend this to fielderly participants or patients with specific conditions, such as lower extremity paralysis or muscle rigidity following stroke. For example, muscle contractures that result from upper motor lesion in patients with cerebral palsy are often treated by surgical lengthening [29]. Mathewson et al. have posited that it is important to know both fascicle length and sarcomere length to make appropriate intraoperative surgical decisions about muscle lengthening; the current study can provide information on whether the sarcomere length is on the ascending or descending limb of the F-L curve [30].\n\nThere are some limitations to the current study, the main one is the small sample size. However, it should be noted that the repeated measures ANOVA has higher statistical power since the variability in the subject population is taken into account. Further, statistically significant differences in fiber strain, normalized fiber strains and in fiber architecture with force and ankle angles were identified in the current small study. The study was in 2D while true muscle fibers traverse a 3Dal space both at rest and at the peak of the contraction. However, care was taken to position the oblique sagittal slice such that the fibers of the MG lay in the plane of the image; this was subsequently verified by the DTI based analysis which showed that the fibers ran predominantly in-plane. It should also be noted that the 2D acquisition allowed for the MG fibers to be in the imaging plane but this plane is not necessarily in the right orientation to capture the soleus fibers in the imaging plane. Further, the more complicated orientation of the soleus muscle as well as its sub-compartments will make it near impossible to capture the fibers of the entire soleus muscle in a single plane. A 3D, three directional velocity encoding sequence is required to map fiber strains in all the plantarflexor muscles.\n\nIn summary, the current paper focuses on muscle fiber and aponeurosis strains obtained at two levels of submaximal isometric contractions with the ankle angle varied from dorsiflexion to neutral to plantarflexed. The dorsiflexed ankle position generated significantly greater force while exhibiting significantly lower normalized strains than the neutral or plantarflexed position. The sarcomere lengths at rest and at peak force were calculated assuming a reference optimal sarcomere length at the dorsiflexed ankle angle and the MG was identified to be working in the ascending limb of the FL curve. The analysis of the sarcomere lengths and their relative positions on the F-L curve also revealed that there may be other determinants to force changes with ankle position in addition to changes in sarcomere length."
