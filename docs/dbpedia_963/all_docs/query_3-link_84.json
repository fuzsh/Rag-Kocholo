        "text": "In-text citations can be written in different ways to fit your writing style. This table shows APA 7th style citations both in parenthetical form (in parentheses/round brackets at the end of the sentence) and in narrative form (where part of the citation is included within the narrative of your work):\n\nIdea paraphrased\n\nDirect quotation included\n\nParenthetical citation\n\nSocial media users will share different types of content on different sites, often basing their decisions on a mental model of how their audience on each site will react (Pitcan et al., 2018). Social media users \"attempted to curate their shared content depending on how they imagined their audience on different social media platforms\" (Pitcan et al., 2018, p. 170).\n\nCitation included in the narrative\n\nParticipants in a 2018 study by Pitcan et al. shared different content on different social media sites, basing their decisions on a mental model of how their audience on each site would react. Participants in a study by Pitcan et al. (2018) \"attempted to curate their shared content depending on how they imagined their audience on different social media platforms\" (p. 170).\n\nParenthetical citation\n\nThe general form is (Author, date), within parentheses. Parenthetical citation is also known as information-prominent citation: it is used to emphasise the information being cited.\n\nA parenthetical citation should directly follow the idea being cited. Include it within the punctuation of the sentence or portion of a sentence the citation relates to. For instance:\n\n... as has been shown in a recent study (Mihrshahi & Baur, 2018), and discussed at length in the literature in years past (Smith, 2007).\n\nNarrative citation\n\nYou do not necessarily need to use parenthetical citations in your work, but you must include both the author and the date of the work you wish to cite within the body of your text. There are multiple ways to include a citation within the narrative. Here are two examples:\n\nKessler (2014) found that among epidemiological samples . . .\n\nIn 2014, Kessler's study of epidemiological samples showed that . . .\n\nNarrative citation is also known as author-prominent citation. Narrative citations place more emphasis on the author of the work you are using. This type of citation can introduce some variety into your writing, and will sound more natural in an oral presentation than a citation at the end of the sentence. However, it does require more skill to use clearly.\n\nAcademic Skills Essentials links to tutorials on writing clearly and appropriately in a variety of academic writing genres, created by ECU's learning advisers; especially useful are their tips on integrating others' ideas into your work with appropriate attribution, synthesising ideas from multiple sources, and notetaking to ensure you are giving credit to the correct sources. You can also find some great examples of citing works you have paraphrased on the APA Style website.\n\nDirect quotations\n\nIf you are including a word-for-word quote from another work, you must enclose the quote in quotation marks and add the page number or numbers to your citation. For electronic sources where there is no page number, use the paragraph number or section heading.\n\nYou may also optionally include a page or paragraph number when it would help the reader locate the relevant information in a long or complex text, even when you have paraphrased instead of quoting. Note: Some Schools prefer that you only provide a page number for a quotation, so check with your lecturer to understand their preference.\n\nIf your quote spans more than one page in the source, use the abbreviation \"pp.\" instead of \"p.\":\n\n(Pitcan et al., 2018, pp. 170-171).\n\nTo cite information from a work with no page numbers, click on \"How do you cite a specific part of a text?\" below.\n\nFor quotations with 40 or more words, the formatting of both the quotation and the citation are slightly different. The quotation is offset from your text, and the punctuation of the quote comes before the in-text citation.\n\nExample:\n\nSocial media users will share different types of content on different sites, often basing their decisions on a mental model of how their audience on each site will react.\n\nMany participants curated a respectable online presence by avoiding sexual innuendo and censoring opinions on controversial topics. Aviva was “very wary about the things [she] puts online.” . . . She described her online self as a different “form.” She chose to present a fragment of herself, because certain facets of her being would be unacceptable to her imagined audience. (Pitcan et al., 2018, p. 170)\n\nNote the ellipsis (. . .) in the quote above. This indicates that some text from the original work was omitted for this quotation. For more information on quotations in APA 7th style, refer to Sections 8.25 - 8.36 in the Publication Manual, the APA Style website here, or the tutorial below."
