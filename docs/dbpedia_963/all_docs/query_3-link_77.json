VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands.\n\nOrganic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing and hobby products. Fuels are made up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored.\n\nEPA's Office of Research and Development's \"Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) Study\" (Volumes I through IV, completed in 1985) found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas. TEAM studies indicated that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed.\n\nSources of VOCs\n\nHousehold products, including:\n\npaints, paint strippers and other solvents\n\nwood preservatives\n\naerosol sprays\n\ncleansers and disinfectants\n\nmoth repellents and air fresheners\n\nstored fuels and automotive products\n\nhobby supplies\n\ndry-cleaned clothing\n\npesticide\n\nOther products, including:\n\nbuilding materials and furnishings\n\noffice equipment such as copiers and printers, correction fluids and carbonless copy paper\n\ngraphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers and photographic solutions.\n\nHealth Effects\n\nHealth effects may include:\n\nEye, nose and throat irritation\n\nHeadaches, loss of coordination and nausea\n\nDamage to liver, kidney and central nervous system\n\nSome organics can cause cancer in animals, some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans.\n\nKey signs or symptoms associated with exposure to VOCs include:\n\nconjunctival irritation\n\nnose and throat discomfort\n\nheadache\n\nallergic skin reaction\n\ndyspnea\n\ndeclines in serum cholinesterase levels\n\nnausea\n\nemesis\n\nepistaxis\n\nfatigue\n\ndizziness\n\nThe ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effect.\n\nAs with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed. Among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics include:\n\nEye and respiratory tract irritation\n\nheadaches\n\ndizziness\n\nvisual disorders and memory impairment\n\nAt present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes.\n\nEPA's Office of Drinking Water Regulations\n\nList of Contaminants and their MCLs: Organic Chemicals\n\nU.S. Geology Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program\n\nInformation on VOCs in Water Sources\n\nLevels in Homes\n\nStudies have found that levels of several organics average 2 to 5 times higher indoors than outdoors. During and for several hours immediately after certain activities, such as paint stripping, levels may be 1,000 times background outdoor levels.\n\nSteps to Reduce Exposure\n\nIncrease ventilation when using products that emit VOCs.\n\nMeet or exceed any label precautions.\n\nDo not store opened containers of unused paints and similar materials within the school.\n\nFormaldehyde, one of the best known VOCs, is one of the few indoor air pollutants that can be readily measured.\n\nIdentify, and if possible, remove the source.\n\nIf not possible to remove, reduce exposure by using a sealant on all exposed surfaces of paneling and other furnishings.\n\nUse integrated pest management techniques to reduce the need for pesticides.\n\nUse household products according to manufacturer's directions.\n\nMake sure you provide plenty of fresh air when using these products.\n\nThrow away unused or little-used containers safely; buy in quantities that you will use soon.\n\nKeep out of reach of children and pets.\n\nNever mix household care products unless directed on the label.\n\nFollow label instructions carefully.\n\nPotentially hazardous products often have warnings aimed at reducing exposure of the user. For example, if a label says to use the product in a well-ventilated area, go outdoors or in areas equipped with an exhaust fan to use it. Otherwise, open up windows to provide the maximum amount of outdoor air possible.\n\nThrow away partially full containers of old or unneeded chemicals safely.\n\nBecause gases can leak even from closed containers, this single step could help lower concentrations of organic chemicals in your home. (Be sure that materials you decide to keep are stored not only in a well-ventilated area but are also safely out of reach of children.) Do not simply toss these unwanted products in the garbage can. Find out if your local government or any organization in your community sponsors special days for the collection of toxic household wastes. If such days are available, use them to dispose of the unwanted containers safely. If no such collection days are available, think about organizing one.\n\nBuy limited quantities.\n\nIf you use products only occasionally or seasonally, such as paints, paint strippers and kerosene for space heaters or gasoline for lawn mowers, buy only as much as you will use right away.\n\nKeep exposure to emissions from products containing methylene chloride to a minimum.\n\nConsumer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms associated with exposure to carbon monoxide. Carefully read the labels containing health hazard information and cautions on the proper use of these products. Use products that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors only if the area is well ventilated.\n\nKeep exposure to benzene to a minimum.\n\nBenzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are:\n\nenvironmental tobacco smoke\n\nstored fuels\n\npaint supplies\n\nautomobile emissions in attached garages\n\nActions that will reduce benzene exposure include:\n\neliminating smoking within the home\n\nproviding for maximum ventilation during painting\n\ndiscarding paint supplies and special fuels that will not be used immediately\n\nKeep exposure to perchloroethylene emissions from newly dry-cleaned materials to a minimum.\n\nPerchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time.\n\nTaking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent.\n\nIf dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried.\n\nIf goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.\n\nStandards or Guidelines\n\nNo federally enforceable standards have been set for VOCs in non-industrial settings.
