        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nTelomeres are protective caps of repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, that protect against DNA double-strand breaks and shorten with each cell division and with aging.1,2 Biologically, progressive shortening of telomeres eventually leads to “replicative senescence” and reflects the remaining growth rate or replicative potential of a cell population.3,4 Clinically, decreased average telomere length measured in blood, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cell telomere length (PBMC-TL) has been associated with a number of pathologies as well as fewer years of healthy living in older patients.5,6\n\nLittle is known about the effects of PBMC-TL on response to traumatic injury. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in injured geriatric (age 65+) patients, who primarily suffer from blunt trauma, especially falls.7 In fact, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) has declared elderly trauma patients as a “medically underserved” population with special concerns due to under-triage, co-morbidities, and baseline anticoagulant usage.7,8 It has also been demonstrated that increasing age and injury severity score (ISS) together lead to greater mortality.9 Early changes in inflammation and coagulation are implicated in the response to traumatic injury, and the effect of aging-related immunosenescence on these responses is incompletely described.10,11 Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) represents an early dysregulation of normal hemostasis seen after injury, with both hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable faces.12,13 However, standard markers of coagulation often have minimal alterations and lack sensitivity for TIC in elderly patients.14 Telomere shortening is a physiologic consequence of aging with potential pathophysiologic implications and may represent an important contributor to TIC and the inflammatory response to traumatic injury, which may have implications for long-term functional outcomes.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that PBMC-TL changes significantly in the short term in response to acute injury, preexisting individual differences in PBMC-TL at the time of the injury may affect the ability of patients to mount a robust response to trauma and recover from their injuries, ultimately influencing clinical outcomes. In animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI), shorter PBMC-TL has been associated with increased concussion symptom severity and is thought to have potential as a marker of concussion pathology.15 Additionally, in patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), shorter PBMC-TL has been associated with worsening functional outcomes including decreased mobility and bladder dysfunction.16 These early studies suggest the importance of studying PBMC-TL as a predictor of outcomes after trauma. The objective of our pilot study was to characterize the role of telomere length in TIC, specifically thrombin generation kinetics, and discharge outcomes in a heterogenous group of younger and older trauma patients at a single institution.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDemographics and Baseline Characteristics:\n\nA total of 42 patients aged 19–22 were included in the cohort of younger trauma patients while a total of 39 patients aged 60–65 were included in the cohort of older trauma patients ( ). Older trauma patients had greater BMI, were less likely to be smokers, and were more likely to be taking anti-platelet agents. The majority of patients suffered blunt traumatic injury. On admission, older patients had decreased platelet count as compared younger patients, though both groups had median values within our laboratory’s normal range. Older patients trended towards greater injury severity score, greater rate of ICU admission, and longer length of stay; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Older patients were significantly less likely to be discharged home when compared with younger patients.\n\nTable 1:\n\nAge 19–22 (Younger)\n\n(n = 42)Ages 60–65 (Older)\n\n(n = 39)p-value Age (years) 21 [20, 22]62 [61, 64] < 0.001 Sex (% male) 29 (69%)31 (79%)0.28 BMI (kg/m2) 24.7 [22.0, 27.0]28.6 [25.5, 34.1] < 0.001 Race (% White) 35 (83.3%)36 (92.3%)0.32 Ethnicity (% Not Hispanic) 35 (83.3%)38 (97.4%)0.058 Current smoker (%) 15 (36%)2 (5%) < 0.001 Anti-platelet (%) 0 (0%)15 (38%) < 0.001 Trauma mechanism\n\nBlunt (%)\n\nPenetrating (%)\n\n35 (83%)\n\n7 (17%)\n\n37 (96%)\n\n2 (5%)0.16 Injury Severity Score (ISS) 12 [6, 23]20 [10, 27]0.053Initial Characteristics\n\nHeart rate (BPM)\n\nSystolic blood pressure (mm Hg)\n\nGlasgow Coma Scale < 15 (%)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dL)\n\nPlatelet count (x 109/L)\n\nINR\n\n94 [82, 113]\n\n122 [110, 137]\n\n10 (24%)\n\n13.8 [13.0, 15.1]\n\n254 [223, 285]\n\n1.1 [1.1, 1.2]\n\n91 [78, 99]\n\n114 [92, 128]\n\n9 (23%)\n\n13.8 [13.0, 15.4]\n\n213 [184, 242]\n\n1.1 [1.1, 1.2]\n\n0.30\n\n0.033\n\n0.94\n\n0.62\n\n0.001\n\n0.96First 24 hours\n\nSurgery (%)\n\nTransfusion (%)\n\nVTE Chemoprophylaxis (%)\n\n24 (57%)\n\n11 (26%)\n\n16 (38%)\n\n15 (38%)\n\n10 (26%)\n\n15 (38%)\n\n0.093\n\n0.96\n\n0.97Injuries\n\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) (%)\n\nLong bone fracture (%)\n\nSpinal cord injury (%)\n\n21 (50%)\n\n19 (45%)\n\n2 (5%)\n\n17 (44%)\n\n14 (36%)\n\n7 (18%)\n\n0.56\n\n0.39\n\n0.081 ICU Admission (%) 15 (36%)22 (56%)0.063 Length of stay (days) 3 [1, 6]5 [2, 11]0.054Discharge Disposition\n\nHome\n\nRehab\n\nSNF or LTAC\n\nDeath\n\n39 (92.9%)\n\n2 (4.8%)\n\n0 (0%)\n\n1 (2.4%)\n\n22 (56.4%)\n\n4 (10.3%)\n\n10 (25.6%)\n\n3 (7.7%)< 0.001 (for home vs. not home)\n\nAmong the older patients, 22 (56.4%) were discharged home while 17 (43.6%) had a discharge disposition to someplace other than home, as described in . As outlined in Supplemental Table 1, the older patients that did not discharge home were more severely injured, were more likely to have an abnormal GCS at presentation, had longer median hospital length of stay, greater transfusion, surgery and ICU requirements than those who were discharged to home. Among those older patients who did not discharge home (n = 17), there were varying reasons for alternate discharge dispositions. Three (17.6%) died in hospital, three (17.6%) required cognitive rehabilitation, two (11.8%) required spine rehabilitation, two (11.8%) had intensive physical and/or occupational therapy requirements and the rest (n = 7, 41.1%) required a high level of assistance with activities of daily living, mobilization, wound care, and/or had insufficient caregiver support at home.\n\nCoagulation Parameters and Telomere Length:\n\nOlder and younger patients had no significant differences in thrombin generation profiles ( ) as measured by CAT assay. Admission thromboelastography (TEG) was performed in 38 of the 42 younger patients and in 35 of the 39 older patients. There were no differences in R-time, K-time, α-angle, or maximal amplitude (MA) between younger and older patients. Older patients had a lower degree of clot fibrinolysis measured by Ly30, but both groups had median Ly30 values within our laboratory’s normal limits. As expected, older patients had shorter total telomere length and shorter average telomere length per chromosome than younger patients.\n\nTable 2:\n\nYoung (n = 42)Older (n = 39)p-valueThrombin Generation\n\nLT (min)\n\nPH (nM)\n\nttPeak (min)\n\nETP (nM*min)\n\n3.00 [2.33, 3.33]\n\n282.1 [219.7, 327.1]\n\n5.67 [4.87, 6.29]\n\n1408 [1205, 1667]\n\n3.24 [2.5, 3.76]\n\n258.5 [218.0, 297.0]\n\n5.89 [4.86, 6.90]\n\n1411 [1203, 1679]\n\n0.21\n\n0.24\n\n0.26\n\n0.92Thromboelastography\n\nR-time (min)\n\nK-time (min)\n\nα-angle\n\nMaximal Amplitude\n\nLy30 (%)\n\n4.2 [3.3, 5.0]\n\n1.3 [1.1, 1.7]\n\n71.3 [67.6, 74.6]\n\n65.0 [61.8, 67.0]\n\n0.6 [0.1, 1.9]\n\n4.5 [3.5, 5.7]\n\n1.3 [1.1, 1.6]\n\n70.0 [68.3, 73.4]\n\n65.1 [62.2, 69.3]\n\n0.2 [0.0, 0.8]\n\n0.32\n\n0.57\n\n0.61\n\n0.35\n\n0.031 Total telomere length (Mb) 0.40 [0.30, 0.49]0.29 [0.23, 0.33] < 0.001 Average telomere length per chromosome (kb) 4.3 [3.3, 5.3]3.2 [2.5, 3.7] < 0.001\n\nCoagulation and Clinical Parameters Stratified by Telomere Length for Younger Trauma Patients:\n\nWhen younger patients were stratified by 50th percentile of telomere length, no differences emerged for clinical features including age, sex, and ISS ( ).

These associations with PBMC-TL did not hold for younger trauma patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight a correlation between PBMC-TL and markers of trauma-induced coagulopathy as well as outcomes in a heterogeneous population of trauma patients. PBMC-TL is a widely used biomarker of aging and aging-related disease. Specifically, PBMC-TL is known to correlate to chronologic age but also tends to be altered by environmental exposures or genetic alterations, among other factors.21 While traumatic injury is unlikely to have an immediate effect on PBMC-TL due to its acute nature, there is evidence that environmental and lifestyle factors, both during development and adulthood, including psychosocial stress, can have an impact on PBMC-TL.22,23 The long-term consequences of traumatic injury on PBMC-TL are as yet unknown. It has been hypothesized that chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) may lead to premature aging due to degree of cellular damage and subsequent telomere shortening.16 However, there are no conclusive studies showing directionality of the association between functional outcomes from SCI and PBMC-TL.\n\nIn general, it is unknown whether telomere shortening is a cause or consequence of age-related disease. Recent studies have shown that PBMC-TL is intricately tied to cellular senescence and the senescence associated secretory phenotype.24 This phenotype represents dysfunctional cellular repair that ultimately plays a role in chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and poor wound healing, and has recently been shown to have a role in chronic subdural hematoma and fracture healing.25,26 However, it is unknown whether PBMC-TL in these cases would represent a manifestation of cellular senescence or is a result of aging cells. Biologically, it is likely that PBMC-TL would best serve as a biomarker with a potential predictive role in trauma outcomes within the context of other markers of cellular senescence, particularly in older patients.21\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, frailty is a potentially important contributor to both trauma and PBMC-TL. Frailty represents a clinical constellation of decreased physiologic reserve and susceptibility to poor outcomes as a result of age-related decreases in cognitive, physical, social, and psychological function.27,28 Recent work has shown that frailty, rather than chronological age, may be a better predictor of discharge outcomes after trauma and has led to the development of trauma specific frailty scores for use in geriatric (65+) patients.28,29 Interestingly, both chronological age and frailty have been shown to be associated with leukocyte telomere length in a recently published study of over 400,000 participants age 40–69, while a recent meta-analysis has also demonstrated an association between frailty and leukocyte telomere length.30 It is important to note that our study population of older patients included those age 60–65 and that geriatric trauma patients are typically classified as those 65 and above.8 Our included patients did not have prospectively assigned frailty scoring performed and did not meet criteria for frailty when clinical frailty scoring (CFS) was retrospectively applied by two independent experienced clinicians.31 However, only the older subset of patients demonstrated an association between PBMC-TL and discharge outcomes, and additionally our multivariable models showed a composite effect of age and PBMC-TL in predicting discharge outcome. Further studies are needed to better understand the links between and implications of frailty and PBMC-TL in elderly trauma patients.\n\nOur pilot study has several limitations. We have analyzed samples from a relatively small number of patients from a single center. We did perform multivariable analysis to control for other factors that may be contributing to thrombin generation kinetics and thus presenting a confounding effect. However, given that this is prospectively collected patient data, we do not have the ability to control for all possible confounding factors, particularly in a small patient cohort. We are describing here a correlation between telomere length and discharge disposition after injury in older adults. We do not have the data presently to explain a causal effect or mechanism for this observation. These patients primarily suffered from blunt trauma and represent only two discrete age groups (age 19–22 and age 60–65). It is likely that the relationship between PBMC-TL and TIC as well as discharge disposition would vary for different age groups. Additionally, we did not have samples from age-matched healthy volunteers to use in this study, so we are unable to compare our patients to a reference group. As described above, the older patients did not display evidence of frailty and thus we cannot draw any conclusions on the contributions of frailty and PBMC-TL to TIC or discharge outcomes. Samples were obtained from peripheral cells only, and telomere length can be heterogeneous across different cell and tissue types, though telomere length does tend to decrease across all tissues with age.32 Our samples were all collected in the early post-injury (within 6 hours) period and we have limited post-discharge data; thus, this study does not reflect potential longer-term links between PBMC-TL and functional outcomes. Finally, PBMC-TL is known to vary with sex and ethnicity, and our study contains mostly Caucasian non-Hispanic patients, so this may not be generalizable to all trauma populations.2,21 Despite these limitations, this is the first study to find a link between baseline PBMC-TL and coagulation parameters (thrombin generation) as well as discharge outcomes in older trauma patients. PBMC-TL has shown promise as a biomarker in personalized medicine, and further studies are needed to determine its role in trauma patients, and if confirmed, the mechanism behind these associations.33"
