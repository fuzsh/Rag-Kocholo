        "text": "Measurement units have followed a fairly standard pattern.\n\nOriginally things are compared to something that both parties recognise. It could be a specific thing (the Washington monument) or a general thing (a banana). No one is really measuring anything accurately, so this is good enough.\n\nNext people start to measure things against their own standard. This is usually merchants, who need to measure to set a price. They need something repeatable, so they use a particular stick for length. It might be similar to the length of a banana, because that's what people are used to, but other people may have chosen a different basis for their stick, and even if they didn't, their sticks will be different.\n\nNext all the different measuring sticks are standardised by a local authority (king, merchant's guild, etc) so they can collect taxes. They either take an average or go with whatever the richest merchant was using. The same process can occur when two countries standardise - but normally a small country adopts the units of a larger neighbour.\n\nFinally scientists define a more precise version of the standard.\n\nWell, for one, it's unlikely that having multiple races would affect using body parts for measurement; humans come in varying shapes and sizes after all, and that's why we moved to more objective forms of measurement as our technology allowed for it.\n\nAt most, you'd wind up with a situation where they say things like \"that's an orc-foot long\" or \"that weighs a dwarf-pound.\"\n\nHowever, I imagine just waving away your question isn't a very satisfying answer, so let's try and figure out a solution through world-building.\n\nCreating a metric system requires a significant amount of technology and understanding of mathematics and the sciences, and even modern SI units are poorly defined for certain dimensions (the speed of light is, by definition, 299792458 m/s, but the meter is defined as the distance traveled by light in 1/299,792,458th of a second, so you can see the problem, the kilogram was defined by a 200 year old reference standard until only a few years ago, and its replacement, a silicon sphere, isn't without controversy).\n\nHowever, since it's a fantasy world, you can invoke a bit of magic, handwaving, or both.\n\nYou could have a tree that inexplicably always grows a branch of a roughly identical length, or have a race of people that always reach the same height upon reaching adulthood. You could have a magical spell that's been bestowed upon the world by God of Measures, that allows for proper measuring.\n\nAnother possibility is, depending on how savy your people are, or how well they can measure time, would be for them to measure the difference between two shadows of a stick at different times on a specific day. For example, your measure of length might be something called a \"springbow\" which is defined as the distance between a shadow cast by a stick at the 1st bell and 4th bell on the day of Spring Equinox. Assuming that the time of bells is well-defined, presumably through a well-regulated clock, one would expect this distance to be identical on the Spring Equinox every year.\n\nAs such, you could even have a \"Festival Of Measures\" where the townsfolk gather to observe the measuring of the springbow, and reference measuring sticks are provided to all in attendance for free.\n\nEven this has some problems though, as for the springbow to be identical, it has to be measured at exactly the same time in exactly the same place and must neglect the effects of procession. Worse, you have to know exactly where to measure on your shadows, and measure from that point every time. Procession is easy to hand wave away; you could say it's small or nonexistent for your world. The place is also easy to define. You could use a marker in some important city in the kingdom, perhaps the Royal Courtyard or so. The last question, where to measure on the shadow, is much trickier, and becomes a question of \"who measures the measurer?\" However, this is a problem we, with all of our technology, deal with today as well. Even though we can 'define' what we mean mathematically by a kilometer or a volt, measuring it is not as easy, and we're constantly revising our system of measurement as our technology allows for higher precision measuring of it.\n\nSo in your fantasy world case, perhaps you could use last-year's official springbow reference stick as a kind of \"ritual of renewal.\" This will limit, but not eliminate the error in measurement, but would still leave you with measurements that far exceeded the precision of the ancients, plus it provides for a good plot device that can lead to interesting storylines (what if someone steals the previous year's springbow, or it gets lost, for example).\n\nMeasurements were originally derived from things aside from the human body.\n\nThe acre was originally the amount of land that could be plowed by a yoke of oxen in one day, and eventually became defined as a strip of land a furlong in length and a chain wide, with the furlong the length of a furrow said oxen could plow in one go before having to rest.\n\nWhat's needed, initially, is something that is convenient for all the races in question, that is pretty standardized, and they agree on. For instance, suppose there's a widespread species of tree that, when mature, tends to have a thickness of around (what we'd call) a foot. So if you have one of those trees, some chopping yields you measuring sticks.\n\nThe single greatest issue is convenience. The units that stick around are the ones that can be used every day without needing excessive precision. A good example is the foot. Despite Canada officially using metric for decades now, the foot still sticks around because it's a unit of convenient size for everyday use. There's really no natural subdivision of the meter that works. On the other hand, litres are close enough to quarts, and thus to quarters of a gallon, that said switch worked out easily and quickly. Meters easily replaced yards (except in football) because they're both about the same size. But the good old foot, that's going to stick around for a while yet.\n\nThey could continue to use their own body parts, and simply be aware of conversions and other rules of thumb. If a human and a halfling are negotiating for some number of feet of cloth, they should establish which culture's \"feet\" are being used. (Or, maybe they don't and this is one way unscrupulous vendors try to swindle people in your universe.)\n\nIn pre-modern Earth it was common for well-established cultures to nonetheless have different units and different definitions of the same unit coexisting. Take the pous, the Classical Greek \"foot\", for instance. In Athens it was typically a hair under 300mm, but in Aegina it was about 10% larger.\n\nOf course, this sort of untidiness leads to added difficulties in map-making, treaty drafting, trade, and taxation, so governments don't tend to like it very much. Among the accomplishments of most of your serious empire-builders, you'll find that they inevitably establish standard measures to be used throughout their empire. (I'm thinking here particularly of Qin Shi Huang, but there are many other examples.) Probably some of the \"body\" units in your story will fall out of favor as the cultures that promulgate them do the same, to be replaced by \"standard\" units based on those of the preeminent cultures.\n\nWhy not use the size of the Earth itself? This is, after all, how real life got both the nautical mile (conceptually one minute of latitude, or 1/21 600 of the circumference) and the meter (1/40 000 000). It can be measured with good-enough accuracy using the knowledge available to Eratosthenes (276-195 BCE).\n\nOf course, as technology improves, more accurate surveys can be taken, while the standardization definition of the length unit will likely stay the same for the sake of backwards-compatibility. This is how we arrived at our current situation where Earth's polar circumference is 40 007.863 km (error of 197 ppm from the conceptual 40 000 km) or 21 602.517 nautical miles (error of 117 ppm from the conceptual 21 600).\n\nYou will of course need to choose a convenient fraction of the circumference to use as your main length unit. And this is where having multiple sapient species makes things get complicated. For not only do you have to deal with orders of magnitude (e.g., a mouse would likely prefer a smaller unit than an elephant would), but you can't assume that everyone will be counting in base ten, which IRL comes from the human habit of counting on our ten figures. Some races will have different numbers of fingers, and some won't have fingers at all. So maybe you have one base-6 society and one base-10 society. Maybe they'll compromise on base 8 (their arithmetic mean) or base 30 (their lowest common multiple). In the former case, you might define a “foot” equal to 1/8^9 of the planet's circumference (298 mm), and in the latter case, you might have a unit that's 1/30^6 of the circumference (54.88 mm).\n\nYou are chasing a non-issue. Variation among races doesn't matter.\n\nBy the time the variation of other races matter, your culture isn't using natural measurements anymore. handspans work fine even with a wide variety of races because by the time the difference in hands matter you are not using real handspans anymore.\n\nFirst nothing in nature is consistent enough for precision measurement, They get used early then abandoned, the name sticks around the unt they no longer use the actual thing. examples include body parts, grain seeds or livestock body parts, feet were the most common just becasue the first thing that people are measuring is ground distances and feet are convenient. People are lazy they are not going to carry around things to measure with. seeds get used for volume because there is nothing convenient to measure volume with.\n\nOf course for much of human history it did not matter, measurements were basically just tallies and eyeballed measurements. What a culture will pick is entirely situational, based on the local wildlife and population. Handspan, grains, feet, ect. works fine because you are either only trading with locals (debt based trade) in which case they can both see your hand and already have a culturally ingrained idea of what you are talking about, at this point measurements don't have a lot of use and when they do it is things that can be directly compared, from here to that tree, yay high, large vs small. Eyeball measurements are good enough nothing more precise is needed.\n\nIf you are trading with strangers measurements don't matter, trade is goods for goods that are both present at the same time, in which case unit measurement in pointless. Once you get to long distance trade you are already at the level that standardization begins, because languages are not shared in common. You are using direct comparison (scales, standing two things next to each other, ect.) just due to language barriers. Measurement does not have a lot of use until you start getting widespread writing, which is a long way away, and grows with standardization.\n\nby the time you get to a culture that needs unit precision they have standardized, usually based on some kind of stone monument. It may have a name like handspan, but its based on the hand of a single statue or set of standardized statues there is minimal variation. It doesn't matter how big the hand of the guy you are trading with is.\n\nWhen it comes to worldbuilding, these differences and variations SHOULD be a part of that world. Erasing them says just as much about the world as letting them be--it says something about who leads in trade, about differences in culture, about government and far, far more than you would think.\n\nThe takeaway is this: instead of asking how you can have uniform measurement, you should be asking why it would exist at all. In the real world where humans don't have this variation in size and body parts, we already have and historically have had vast variations in measurements. It's never been uniform. So if your world is similar enough to draw a comparison, it actually makes less sense for there to be one single standard without a compelling, in-world cultural reason for this to be true.\n\nYou're worried about inconsistency when in historical fact, units of measurement in early history have always been inconsistent. Units of measure varied from town to town in Medieval times. Standardized measures are something that is determined by a ruler or ruling class or who has power in trade, which much then enforces that.\n\nThe re-frame is, of course, what others have suggested--that the physical difference between the races means two different standards of measurement. Even today, on a global scale, there are two different major standards. And within industries, there are other standards still, sometimes vestiges leftover from a much, much earlier time (such as the measure of \"grains\" in gems.)\n\nMaking the basis something that is more consistent is difficult. Even IF you use an agricultural product (barley's consistency means that it was used as a measure of weight and length in past times) what agricultural product it will be might vary as much as body size and weight from race to race.\n\nGrain actually has been used in weight quite a bit.\n\nAnd barley HAS been used in length"
