The formula also refers to cell B3, which is where you will specify that Goal Seek put the interest rate. The formula divides the value in B3 by 12 because you specified a monthly payment, and the PMT function assumes an annual interest rate.\n\nBecause there is no value in cell B3, Excel assumes a 0% interest rate and, using the values in the example, returns a payment of $555.56.
