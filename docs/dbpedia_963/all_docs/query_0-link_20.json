Its elegance lies in the shoe's low-key and practical appeal.\n\nOur top pick in best leather sneakers\n\nOur top pick in best Nike sneakers\n\nPros\n\nCrisp and classic look\n\nCan be dressed up or down\n\nGreat leather quality for the price\n\nResponsive Air cushioning\n\nHighly stable and supportive\n\nDecent airflow for a leather shoe\n\nReasonably priced\n\nCan last for years\n\nCons\n\nQuite heavy\n\nCreases easily\n\nNot for all-day wear\n\nArduous break-in period\n\nAudience verdict\n\n91\n\nGreat!\n\nTop 17% in Nike sneakers\n\nTop 1% in Nike Air Force 1 sneakers\n\nComparison\n\nThe most similar sneakers compared\n\n+ + Add a shoe\n\nAudience score\n\n91\n\nGreat!\n\n88\n\nGood!\n\n90\n\nGreat!\n\n93\n\nGreat!\n\nPrice\n\n$115\n\n$110\n\n$110\n\n$110\n\nStyle\n\nClassicRetroSporty\n\nRetroSporty\n\nClassicRetroSporty\n\nRetroSporty\n\nBreathability\n\nModerate\n\nWarm\n\nWarm\n\nModerate\n\nWeight lab 16.4 oz / 465g 15.9 oz / 452g 17 oz / 482g 16.4 oz / 465g Midsole softness\n\nBalanced\n\nFirm\n\nBalanced\n\nBalanced\n\nMaterial\n\nCup SoleLeather\n\nCup SoleLeather\n\nLeather\n\nLeather\n\nSeason\n\nSpringWinterFall\n\nSpringWinterFall\n\nWinter\n\nSpringWinterFall\n\nInspired from\n\nBasketball\n\nBasketball\n\nBasketball\n\nBasketball\n\nToebox width at the widest part\n\nMedium\n\nMedium\n\nMedium\n\nMedium\n\nToebox width at the big toe\n\nMedium\n\nNarrow\n\nMedium\n\nNarrow\n\nLeather/suede quality\n\nReal leather\n\nReal leather\n\nReal leather\n\nReal leather\n\nToebox durability\n\nGood\n\nDecent\n\nGood\n\nGood\n\nHeel padding durability\n\nDecent\n\nDecent\n\nGood\n\nDecent\n\nOutsole durability\n\nDecent\n\nDecent\n\nGood\n\nDecent\n\nHeel stack lab 31.7 mm 33.7 mm 30.1 mm 27.0 mm Stiffness\n\nStiff\n\nModerate\n\nStiff\n\nFlexible\n\nTongue padding\n\nAverage\n\nAverage\n\nAverage\n\nAverage\n\nDrop lab 14.5 mm 15.7 mm 11.8 mm 12.5 mm Forefoot 17.2 mm 18.0 mm 18.3 mm 14.5 mm Removable insole &check; &check; &check; &check; Heel tab\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nTorsional rigidity\n\nStiff\n\nModerate\n\nStiff\n\nModerate\n\nHeel counter stiffness\n\nStiff\n\nStiff\n\nStiff\n\nStiff\n\nClosure\n\nLaces\n\nLaces\n\nLaces\n\nLacesVelcro\n\nTop\n\nLow top\n\nLow top\n\nLow top\n\nLow top\n\nRanking\n\n#37 Top 45%\n\n#61 Bottom 27%\n\n#46 Bottom 45%\n\n#11 Top 14%\n\nPopularity\n\n#37 Top 45%\n\n#3 Top 4%\n\n#58 Bottom 30%\n\n#40 Top 48%\n\nSee more\n\nWho should buy\n\nWe believe that the Nike Air Force 1 07 belongs in your sneaker stack if:\n\nyou need a practical but good-looking pair to match most of your outfits (from active wear to semi-formal pieces)\n\nyou are aiming for an elegant and classic vibe through a leather sneaker\n\nyou want to enjoy an iconic Nike sneaker at a reasonable price\n\nWho should NOT buy\n\nWe've got two main knocks on the Air Force 1 07:\n\nit is too heavy for comfortable all-day wear\n\nit takes forever to break in the shoe\n\nWe found that the Nike Air Max 1 offers a much more supportive underfoot experience for long hours on the feet and the Nike Dunk Low has a much more flexible design.\n\nBreathability\n\nFor an all-leather sneaker that it is, we discovered a surprising amount of ventilation in the Air Force 1 07.\n\nFilling up the shoe's upper with smoke, we were surprised at how effortlessly it escaped through the eyelets and perforations on the sides.\n\nIn our transparency test above, you can see that the AF 1 07 has more eyelets than the average sneaker as well as two ventilation holes at the bottom of the midfoot.\n\nEven though this Nike shoe doesn't feel super breezy on foot, we still bumped its breathability score up to 3 out of 5. It has a slightly better airflow than similar Nike models. But we still do not recommend it for summer.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 3 Average 2.9\n\nCompared to 57 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nBreathability\n\n5\n\nDurability\n\nLeather/Suede quality\n\nFor what is now considered a \"moderate\" retail price of $115, the quality of the Air Force leather is surprisingly good!\n\nShooting fire from a butane torch to every major panel on the sneaker, we are happy to report that they did not melt or catch flames. This is a good indicator of leather quality.\n\nThere was also no gloss on the burned areas unlike what we saw on the Air Jordan 1 Low (a sign of a plastic finish).\n\nThe Swoosh, on the other hand, appears to be covered in a thick synthetic finish. You can see how it almost bubbles up under the fire.\n\nA common issue for all leather Nike sneakers is that they crease like crazy! Even though the wrinkles don't affect the shoe's integrity, they definitely ruin the look.\n\nTo minimize creasing we recommend the following maintenance:\n\napplying water-repellent spray and leather conditioner\n\nstoring shoes with shoe trees, paper balls, or rolled-up socks\n\ngiving your kicks a day of \"rest\" in between uses\n\ntreating early creases with leather oil\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 Real leather\n\nToebox durability\n\nIf you are cautious about blowing through good-looking sneakers too soon, the Air Force 1 will minimize your worries. This shoe can really take a beating!\n\nWe go pretty hard on all our lab-tested shoes using a Dremel with a sandpaper tip.\n\nIn this test, we apply the tool to the shoe's toebox material with a consistent speed (5K RPM) and pressure (3.2N).\n\nAs you can see, the Air Force 1 07 demonstrates stunning wear resistance compared to mesh-covered kicks!\n\nOn a 1-5 scale, it earned the highest score for toebox durability.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 5 Average 3.8\n\nCompared to 57 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nToebox durability\n\n5\n\nHeel padding durability\n\nEven the inner lining of this Nike sneaker proved to be more durable than average.\n\nA 4-second touch of the Dremel at the speed of 5K RPM left very minor damage on the shoe's textile.\n\nYou can see that it looks almost identical to the heel lining of the red shoe and yet, the difference in abrasion resistance is stunning!\n\n4 points to Gryffi... Nike Air Force!\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 4 Average 3.5\n\nCompared to 57 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nHeel padding durability\n\n5\n\nOutsole hardness\n\nWe also found that the bottom of the AF 1 07 is guarded by a pretty hard rubber compound.\n\nMeasuring it with a Shore C durometer returned a slightly higher-than-average reading of 88.1 HC.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 88.1 HC Average 85.2 HC\n\nWe use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests.\n\nCompared to 57 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n72.9 HC\n\nOutsole hardness\n\n90.5 HC\n\nOutsole durability\n\nBut it didn't help the sneaker perform better than most kicks in our Dremel test.\n\nExposing the shoe's outsole to sandpaper for 22 seconds at an unrelenting speed of 10K RPM resulted in noticeable but not critical damage.\n\nMeasuring it with a tread gauge, we got 1.2 mm. About the same as the average 1-mm dents on other sneakers.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 1.2 mm Average 1.0 mm\n\nCompared to 57 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n0.0 mm\n\nOutsole wear\n\n2.0 mm\n\nOutsole thickness\n\nGladly, the AF 1 07 features a sufficiently thick rubber outsole to prevent premature wear.\n\nIt is 4.6 mm thick according to our caliper measurement.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 4.6 mm Average 5.5 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n3.4 mm\n\nOutsole thickness\n\n12.5 mm\n\nWeight\n\nAs soon as we got our hands on the Nike Air Force 1 07, we knew - it is a BRICK.\n\nAt 16.4 oz (465g) in a men's US size 9, the AF is heavier than all the other iconic Nile silhouettes we tested - the Dunks, the Air Jordans, the Air Maxes...even in their high-top versions!\n\nThe sneakers felt pretty substantial on foot and after a few hours of wear testing, we were looking forward to taking them off, to be honest.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 16.40 oz (465g) Average 14.00 oz (397g)\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n8.50 oz (241g)\n\nWeight\n\n22.61 oz (641g)\n\nCushioning\n\nHeel stack\n\nThe high topline of the Air Force 1 07's cupsole makes it look like a platform sneaker but in fact, it has an average stack height.\n\nMeasuring its thickness with a caliper returned 31.7 mm. That's a typical heel stack for lifestyle sneakers. Not among the tallest.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 31.7 mm Average 29.7 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n16.9 mm\n\nHeel stack\n\n50.5 mm\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 17.2 mm Average 18.8 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n10.6 mm\n\nForefoot stack\n\n28.3 mm\n\nDrop\n\nAt first glance, the Air Force 1 07 has a very steep heel-to-toe drop. Based on our caliper measurements alone, it comes in at 14.5 mm.\n\nBut because the Air unit and the rubber pillars underneath it compress under pressure, the offset becomes more balanced when the shoe is on foot.\n\nSlight elevation of the heel above the toes made us feel comfortably supported taking the strain off our Achilles tendons.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 14.5 mm Average 10.9 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n4.6 mm\n\nDrop\n\n22.6 mm\n\nMidsole softness\n\nNote: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm.\n\nThe nearly full-length Air unit inside the AF1 adds comfort and responsiveness to the otherwise rigid platform.\n\nWe were also surprised to find that the foam around the Air unit is more on the soft side. Pressing our durometer against it returned 20.9 HA which is 40% softer than the average sneaker midsole!\n\nThese two components make the direct underfoot experience quite pleasant. But the AF1 is NOT a plush shoe by any means!\n\nThe foam and the Air unit are encased in a firm and solid cupsole construction which has little-to-no give to it. That's why the Air Force 1 07, as a whole feels firm.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 20.9 HA Average 29.3 HA\n\nWe use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests.\n\nCompared to 46 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n15.0 HA\n\nMidsole softness (soft to firm)\n\n60.0 HA\n\nInsole thickness\n\nThe shoe's midsole is topped off with a well-padded foam insole.\n\nShowing a thickness of 5.0 mm in the heel, it is just about as thick as the average sneaker insole.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 5.0 mm Average 5.4 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n3.1 mm\n\nInsole thickness\n\n14.2 mm\n\nStability\n\nLateral stability test\n\nThe Air Force 1 07 made us feel like our foot was sitting inside a tank.\n\nIt is an incredibly stiff, sturdy, and structured sneaker that keeps the foot and ankle very firmly in place.\n\nIts cupsole walls are pretty tall embracing the foot from the bottom while the collar sits a bit higher up the ankle compared to most low-top sneakers.\n\nTorsional rigidity\n\nAttempting to twist the AF1 07 with our hands yielded no results.\n\nThis Nike sneaker has an impressively high level of torsional rigidity earning it the highest score on our stiffness scale.\n\nWe believe that this kick has enough lateral support to prevent the foot from collapsing inwards. That way, people with overpronation can also enjoy this iconic Air Force silhouette.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 5 Average 3.5\n\nCompared to 57 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nTorsional rigidity\n\n5\n\nHeel counter stiffness\n\nWhat's more, the sneaker offers a ton of rearfoot support with its highly stiff heel counter.\n\nThere is barely any give to it! Our manual test confirmed that it takes significantly more effort to squeeze and push the shoe's heel counter.\n\nOn foot, it translates to a much more secure heel hold with no shifting or heel slippage.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 5 Average 3.1\n\nCompared to 57 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nHeel counter stiffness\n\n5\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 104.0 mm Average 108.7 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n98.8 mm\n\nMidsole width in the forefoot\n\n121.0 mm\n\nMidsole width in the heel\n\nIn the heel, the AF1 07 also proved to be narrower than average. Its widest area comes in at only 77.7 mm.\n\nWe are amazed at how this Nike sneaker combines a high level of stability with a sleek and minimal profile.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 77.7 mm Average 83.1 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n67.7 mm\n\nMidsole width in the heel\n\n103.1 mm\n\nFlexibility\n\nStiffness\n\nIn addition to paying money for wearing the Nike Air Force 1 07, you also pay with an excruciatingly long break-in period.\n\nAnd the worst part is... The shoe never really feels fully broken in!\n\nTo put its stiffness into context, we measured how much force it takes to bend the shoe to a 90-degree angle. Turns out, the AF 1 07 requires 40% more force (32.5N) than the average sneaker! Even the Air Jordan 1 Low needs less (21.8N).\n\nWe assume that it was the shoe's stiffness that contributed to our early foot fatigue during the wear test.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 32.5N Average 23.7N\n\nWe use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests.\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n5.8N\n\nStiffness\n\n60.5N\n\nGrip / Traction\n\nAt the time of its release in 1982, the Nike AF 1 was the first basketball shoe that moved form away from the traditional herringbone pattern.\n\nIt featured the ground-breaking pivot points on the ball of the foot and on the heel allowing basketball players to change directions with less effort.\n\nThese pivot points rarely come in handy for casual wear but we love its sporty aesthetics.\n\nSize and fit\n\nInternal length\n\nNike warns that the Air Force 1 07 runs large and going down a half size is necessary.\n\nHowever, we found that the sneaker runs true to size in our regular men's US 9.\n\nWe also measured the internal length of the Air Force 1 07 at 271.0 mm which corresponds to the US 9 in Nike's shoe size chart.\n\nIts internal length is also consistent with the Air Jordan 1, the Nike Dunk, and the Air Max 1.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 271.0 mm Average 271.9 mm\n\nCompared to 52 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n265.3 mm\n\nInternal length\n\n280.1 mm\n\nToebox width at the widest part\n\nChecking the shoe's toebox, we found that it was not very pointy and never squeezed or pinched our toes.\n\nMeasuring the toebox in the widest part, we got an expected reading of 99.1 mm in a medium D width.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 99.1 mm Average 99.0 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n91.6 mm\n\nToebox width at the widest part\n\n107.7 mm\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 74.7 mm Average 74.7 mm\n\nCompared to 57 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n63.7 mm\n\nToebox width at the big toe\n\n83.0 mm\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 None\n\nComfort\n\nTongue padding\n\nWe are satisfied with the tongue padding of this AF sneaker. At 8.0 mm, it is exactly as much foam as we want on top of our insteps.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 8.0 mm Average 9.1 mm\n\nCompared to 58 sneakers\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n0.7 mm\n\nTongue padding\n\n38.4 mm\n\nHeel tab\n\nThe shoe doesn't have any pull tabs or finger loops at the back. The on-and-off action involves both hands and a bit of fiddling with the laces.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 None\n\nRemovable insole\n\nThe insole of the AF 1 07 is removable but it is attached to the bottom with a sticky adhesive. You may need a little more effort than usual to take it out.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 Yes\n\nMisc\n\nReflective elements\n\nThe base version of the Nike Air Force 1 07 doesn't feature any effective elements to glow in the dark.\n\nTest results\n\nAir Force 1 07 No\n\nThe origins of the Nike Air Force 1 07\n\nNamed after the US President's aircraft, the Nike Air Force 1 was introduced in 1982.\n\nIt was the first ever basketball shoe to feature Nike's proprietary Air Max unit which was on the rise at the time.\n\nCreated by the brand's famous designer Bruce Kilgore, the Air Force silhouette quickly gained traction among athletes including the NBA stars Moses Malone and Michael Cooper. In more recent years, it was also worn by the star players Rasheed Wallace and even Kobe Bryant (during his phenomenal streetball performance).\n\nBut the AF 1 was nearly canceled by Nike back in the '80s! Believe it or not, it took three footwear retailers from Baltimore to convince the brand to keep producing the original design. That's how impactful the local demand was in the city.\n\nIn a matter of a decade, the Air Force 1 became a highly thought-after mainstay in street culture.\n\nFrom drug dealers to rappers, the AF sneakers flooded the American cities. New Yorkers even came up with a nickname for the shoes calling them \"uptowns\" due to their insane popularity in Harlem.\n\nIn 2002, rapper Nelly released an entire single dedicated to the shoe. Called \"Air Force Ones,\" it is basically an anthem for the silhouette.\n\nIn hip-hop culture, Jay-Z, Travis Scott, and many other icons pushed this Nike kick to the spotlight with hype and collaborations. Special editions came in like a hurricane passing the 2000 mark over the past 40 years.\n\nEven though street subcultures have become the shoe's main driving force, it quickly caught fire among many different social groups across multiple generations.\n\nThe Air Force 1 is now a staple that goes from concrete to catwalks, from underground to red carpets, and blends in seamlessly everywhere."
