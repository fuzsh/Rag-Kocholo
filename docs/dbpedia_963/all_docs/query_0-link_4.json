Don't sleep on it if you're looking for:\n\nA model with incredibly good cushioning technologies (Zoom Turbo, Zoom Air).\n\nA pair that offers great stability and a supportive design.\n\nA hooper that adapts to different playstyles because of its overall wonderful performance.\n\nHigh-quality materials in a super stylish reimagined version.\n\nWho should not buy\n\nWe hope your feet are ready for what's coming. First of all, we loved this shoe from head to toe but... this shoe didn't love us that much at the beginning. Its break-in period is painful, and we ended up with blisters and sore Achilles for a while. It was worth it, though, as long as you can endure it, we can assure you this is an amazing pair. If you don't want to know anything about break-in periods (which is totally understandable), you should have a look at the Nike LeBron NXXT GEN, which also has high-quality materials but in a more comfy build.\n\nIf you wanna play streetball, we believe it's better to go for the Nike Cosmic Unity 3. Its hard and sturdy rubber outsole is unmatched when it comes to abrasion resistance.\n\nBreathability\n\nJust by looking at these LeBrons, we knew they'd prioritise durability. So... what about breathability? Well, let's see!\n\nIt looks like we were totally right. Neither LeBron's nor Shaq's shoes would be able to earn a living being yoga instructors. The Reebok Shaq Attaq got a sad 1/5 in our breathability test, and the LB 21? Uh-oh... we're afraid it got the exact same punctuation! Another disappointing 1/5.\n\nAs we can see in our light test, only the tongue has some holes, but that was not enough to let our feet breathe during our wear tests.\n\nOur microscope confirmed it, look at the material! Even though you might see some round details, those are definitely not pores. This model is built to last, and its upper agrees!\n\nNothing to be found in the close-up either. The material is solid, no pores at all!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 3 Average 2.5\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nBreathability\n\n5\n\nDurability\n\nToebox durability\n\nIt doesn't really matter if you're a huge basketball fan, if you only watch the NBA from time to time, or if you don't care that much about this sport... we all know who LeBron James is.\n\nThis legendary hooper is well-known for his aggressive plays under the rim, so it's only natural that his shoes are ready to match his playstyle.\n\nWe knew it right after watching this video. Our Dremel struggled a lot to damage this shoe's upper minimally. The LeBron 21 resisted the attack calmly, and its striking defense earned it a 5/5 in our toebox durability test.\n\nLook at that! It literally looks like we accidentally bumped our toes, not that a rolling tool at a 5K RPM speed and 3.2N pressure tried to destroy our shoe.\n\nHere we have the two ends of the durability spectrum. On the left, the Nike LeBron 21 and its magnificent 5/5 in our toebox durability test. On the right, the Nike Precision 6 and its disappointing 1/5 in this same test.\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 5 Average 3.8\n\nCompared to 45 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nToebox durability\n\n5\n\nHeel padding durability\n\nAfter the amazing durability of its toebox, we were wondering if the heel padding would be that much of a fighter too.\n\nWith an average score of 3/5, we actually couldn't complain. The heel is the weakest point of every shoe, so we're not that surprised when our Dremel damages it more than the toebox.\n\nIt didn't look that bad, though. Also, as you can probably guess from the image, there's a considerable amount of padding in that area. We decided to cut the shoe in half to see it better, look:\n\nAs we were saying before, we really can't complain! There are far worse results, let us give you an example.\n\nThis is what the Reebok Answer DMX's heel looked like after our Dremel went all out on it. It scored a 1/5 in our heel padding durability test, we just couldn't give it anything higher!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 3 Average 3.6\n\nCompared to 42 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nHeel padding durability\n\n5\n\nOutsole hardness\n\nAt 84.5 HC, the outsole hardness of this LeBron pair is slightly above average.\n\nThis result promises a good balance between grip and durability, and our wear tests couldn't agree more. Its traction felt quite reliable (we'll talk about it later on) and, regarding durability, all we can do is ask our Dremel!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 84.5 HC Average 81.5 HC\n\nWe use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests.\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n58.4 HC\n\nOutsole hardness\n\n91.0 HC\n\nOutsole durability\n\nFor our outsole durability test, we grabbed our Dremel once again. This time at 10K RPM and 3.2N, the attack of our tool lasted 22 seconds.\n\nIf you only watch our video, you might think the Dremel wasn't even touching the outsole, as it's barely moving! This was already telling us that good things were coming... and we were absolutely right.\n\nA minimal dent of 0.5 mm appeared when we finally put the tool aside. This is notably less deep than average, which clearly indicates the material is hard and resistant. We're loving it, Nike!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 0.5 mm Average 1.1 mm\n\nCompared to 33 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n0.0 mm\n\nOutsole wear\n\n2.0 mm\n\nOutsole thickness\n\nAs the outsole material is pretty hard, this part of the shoe doesn't need to be that thick.\n\nAt 4.6 mm, our caliper indicated it's still thicker than average. This means the shoe's outsole won't lose its integrity any time soon. Time to hoop until you can no more!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 4.6 mm Average 4.1 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n0.0 mm\n\nOutsole thickness\n\n8.5 mm\n\nWeight\n\nTougher materials, a thicker outsole, loads of padding... of course this is gonna have an effect on the weight!\n\nAt 14.2 oz/403.0g, this shoe is lighter than the previous iteration, and the materials felt premium on our feet. LeBron is a power forward, and if you've ever seen him on the court, you'll know he's a big guy. He doesn't need to be as fast as a guard in his moves, so his shoe's design didn't really focus on that. Nevertheless, the model we're reviewing is the NEW LeBron 21, which is an updated and lighter version of the original.\n\nWith that being said, its weight didn't stop us from making quick fakes, crossover steps, or dribbles. It was nice for our pick-and-rolls, too! It felt nice on our feet, and we didn't mind some extra oz if that meant we got to use this shoe longer.\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 14.22 oz (403g) Average 13.83 oz (392g)\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n11.29 oz (320g)\n\nWeight\n\n17.46 oz (495g)\n\nCushioning\n\nHeel stack\n\nAt 26.6 mm, this shoe's heel stack is lower than average. We believe this just because of our caliper said so, as the feeling on our foot was not that one of a low stack regarding cushioning!\n\nWe've said multiple times that a tall midsole doesn't mean it's gonna be plush, and vice-versa! In this case, we can clearly see an Air Zoom unit in the heel. We absolutely love this feature, as it helped us with our landings. Its propulsive feeling came hand in hand with a bouncy foam that made us feel like a pro player every time we hooped.\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 26.6 mm Average 29.2 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n23.6 mm\n\nHeel stack\n\n38.4 mm\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 22.4 mm Average 21.7 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n18.0 mm\n\nForefoot stack\n\n29.2 mm\n\nDrop\n\nAt 4.2 mm, this shoe's drop is pretty low.\n\nDuring our wear tests, it felt pretty close to the ground. And thanks to its Air Zoom unit, we also got some nice impact protection. A perfect combo, really!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 4.2 mm Average 7.5 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n4.0 mm\n\nDrop\n\n14.8 mm\n\nMidsole softness\n\nNote: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm.\n\nTo measure the softness of a shoe's midsole accurately, first we need to cut it in half. Then, when we can access this piece nicely, we press our durometer against it and wait for a result.\n\nAt 26.5 HA, the LeBron 21's midsole has an average softness. It's made of cushlon foam, which we found out to be pretty bouncy during our wear tests.\n\nWe really love this feature on basketball shoes, as it helps us when we go for aggressive moves. It was like a good balance for the weight of this shoe.\n\nEven though we've said before that this New/Reimagined iteration is lighter than its original, it's still not one of the lightest basketball shoes out there. If you're a LeBron fan and you want a nimble pair of his, have a look at the Nike LeBron Witness 7. If you don't mind changing brands, then we suggest you have a look at our lightweight basketball shoes catalog.\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 26.5 HA Average 25.4 HA\n\nWe use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests.\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n11.0 HA\n\nMidsole softness (soft to firm)\n\n38.6 HA\n\nInsole thickness\n\nWe do love us a nice and thick insole, and the LB 21 knows it well! At 5.7 mm, we felt it was comfortable during our playtests.\n\nThis thick insole + the Zoom Turbo at the forefoot + the Zoom Air at the heel = A fun and snappy ride. This combination made us enjoy every moment we had on the court, as we felt our energy was limitless thanks to the shoe's pop underfoot.\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 5.7 mm Average 4.5 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n0.0 mm\n\nInsole thickness\n\n8.6 mm\n\nStability\n\nLateral stability test\n\nFollowing the general features of this model, we definitely expected it to be quite stable. And not only because of that, but also because we're talking about a pair of LeBron shoes after all! The King needs some stability for his crazy plays, and we couldn't wait to see what our feet had to say about this.\n\nAs expected, we felt surefooted and well-supported. Our ankles didn't wobble, which is something we really appreciate when we play. Why? Well, because if we feel unstable in our new hoopers, we don't have that much confidence when we're trying to play. Doesn't that happen to you too?\n\nNevertheless, this model made sure that didn't happen. Our overall experience regarding stability was pretty nice, as we felt safe and sound during our playtests.\n\nTorsional rigidity\n\nGreat stability comes with... great torsional rigidity.\n\nWe tried our best to bend the shoe, but it was pretty hard for our thumbs! You can see it in the video, we're clearly struggling. That's why we gave this model a well-deserved 5/5 in our torsional rigidity test, what a toughie!\n\nThe only bad thing that comes with a high torsional rigidity is... a break-in period. And let us tell you, this shoe's break-in period? Definitely a killer, we ended up with blisters!\n\nStill, we'd say this is pretty much the only big con we have for this model. The shoe itself is amazing!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 5 Average 4.4\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nTorsional rigidity\n\n5\n\nHeel counter stiffness\n\nNow let's talk a little bit more about those blisters, shall we?\n\nJust look at how incredibly stiff this LeBron's heel counter is. Oh, my! It doesn't even bend a little bit when we press our thumb against it.\n\nThis sure meant some incredibly good lockdown feel, but it also came with a downside: heel rubs. It really hurt our skin, and we ended up with some painful blisters at the end of the day. This model is definitely full of power, but you gotta tame it first!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 5 Average 3.6\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1\n\nHeel counter stiffness\n\n5\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 120.5 mm Average 114.7 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n106.2 mm\n\nMidsole width in the forefoot\n\n122.2 mm\n\nMidsole width in the heel\n\nThe heel was also a bit wider than average, but nothing too big this time.\n\nAt 91.6 mm, this extra space is something we could only appreciate as the overall feeling in our heel was pretty snug. No heel slippage, no weird heel moves... nothing to worry about!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 91.6 mm Average 90.5 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n82.4 mm\n\nMidsole width in the heel\n\n105.1 mm\n\nFlexibility\n\nStiffness\n\nOur previous lab tests indicated this shoe would be stiff, yet our wear tests disagreed. In other words, even though the shoe overall was pretty rigid and the transitions could always be smoother, we didn't actually encounter any problems when we needed to tip-toe in our shot fakes or drop steps.\n\nWhen our gauge returned 43.1N, we couldn't even close our mouths. Our feet were totally right. This score is average, but coming from such a rigid shoe... it's just wonderful news!\n\nWe really enjoyed the redesign of these LeBrons!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 43.1N Average 39.2N\n\nWe use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests.\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n23.3N\n\nStiffness\n\n67.2N\n\nGrip / Traction\n\nTalking about traction in basketball shoes is always so exciting! This feature definitely makes a difference, as nobody likes to accidentally slip when they're trying to dribble or go past an opponent.\n\nIts full-length rubber outsole was a wonderful touch to maximise traction. Even though both outsoles picked up quite some dust, we just needed to wipe them clean with our hands for them to be sticky again.\n\nWe also enjoyed the multidirectional pattern, as it allowed us to change directions quickly when needed. It's true that a full-length rubber outsole might add some weight to the shoe, but we found it completely worth it.\n\nSize and fit\n\nToebox width at the widest part\n\nWhen we measured the toebox width at the widest part, our caliper returned 102.7 mm.\n\nIt's an average score, and our standard width feet were pretty happy wit it. Nevertheless, we can't recommend this model to wide-feet hoopers, as it might be too snug for their bigger feet.\n\nWe absolutely loved the dual colour of this model. We think it brings a new and original style to an already iconic pair, and the fact that the details of both shoes are on the same tones is just so aesthetically pleasing!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 102.7 mm Average 101.5 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n92.6 mm\n\nToebox width at the widest part\n\n108.2 mm\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 75.7 mm Average 76.7 mm\n\nCompared to 48 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n71.2 mm\n\nToebox width at the big toe\n\n85.1 mm\n\nTongue: gusset type\n\nWe were pretty surprised when we removed this shoe's laces and faced its non-gusseted tongue.\n\nThis design made sure our feet had no problem getting into the shoe. With its padded interiors, rigid and stable structure, and top eyelets, we didn't feel any less containment. There's also a lace in the middle of the tongue that makes sure it doesn't slip or dance from side to side, which is something we usually find pretty annoying!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 None\n\nComfort\n\nTongue padding\n\nA thickly padded tongue is the final touch to the overall locked-in feel this shoe offered us.\n\nAt 12.5 mm, our caliper confirmed that we wouldn't get any kind of bite or uncomfortable rub coming from the laces. Our instep was happily welcomed by a plush hug, and we loved it!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 12.5 mm Average 9.5 mm\n\nCompared to 54 basketball shoes\n\nNumber of shoes\n\n1.3 mm\n\nTongue padding\n\n15.9 mm\n\nHeel tab\n\nThere's a colourful pull-tab at the back of this model. In this colorway, it's the blue-ish flap we can see at the top of the heel.\n\nWe didn't find it extremely helpful to put on and off the shoe, but we liked the design choice and the aesthetics. Also, let's not forget this pair has a non-gusseted tongue, so sliding our feet into it wasn't hard at all! The shoe offered us a wide and welcoming opening. Thank you, Nike!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 Pull tab\n\nRemovable insole\n\nJust in case you need to use your own orthotics, this LeBron pair has a removable insole.\n\nHonestly, we were pretty happy with how it performed during our playtests. But there'll be no problem if you want to change it, which is always a plus!\n\nAs you can see in these pictures, the insoles come in different colours, matching the aesthetic of each shoe. We are OBSESSED!\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 Yes\n\nMisc\n\nReflective elements\n\nWe could see some fading light coming from the translucent Swoosh, but no, this shoe doesn't have any reflective elements.\n\nIt's not made to play streetball after all, so we didn't mind it didn't have any despite it's hefty price tag.\n\nTest results\n\nLeBron 21 No"
