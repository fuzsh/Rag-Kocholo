        "text": "In addition to complying with the setback requirements of Section 81-263 (Standard setback requirements), a building shall not at any height encroach beyond a half-setback line or a ten-foot setback line, except as provided below. For each street frontage zone and for all street frontage zones, taken together on a single encroachment grid, a building shall not, at any level, have an aggregate area of encroachment beyond the setback line, other than in any free zones, greater than the aggregate area of compensating recess at such level.\n\nExcept as provided below, an area of compensating recess in one street frontage zone shall not be used to compensate for encroachment in another street frontage zone. However, a building with a street frontage zone which lies along a north-south wide street and does not meet the above requirements because of excessive encroachment will be in compliance with the street frontage zone requirements of this Section if compensation is provided for such excessive encroachment by an overlapping street frontage zone.\n\nThe requirement that the aggregate area of compensating recess at least equal the aggregate area of encroachment, as set forth in this Section, shall also apply to any building which encroaches beyond a half-setback line and which is therefore subject to the provisions of Section 81-265 (Encroachment limitations by length and height rules). (See illustration of Encroachments and Compensating Recesses)\n\n(a) Rules for measuring encroachments and recesses\n\nAreas of encroachment and compensating recess shall be measured in plan on one or more encroachment grids showing for the zoning lot, at a given height level, the street lines, the setback lines, the half-setback lines, the ten-foot setback lines, Zone A, Zone B and Zone C and the street frontage zones.\n\nENCROACHMENTS AND COMPENSATING RECESSES\n\n(81-264a)\n\nThe scale of the encroachment grid shall be not more than 20 feet to the inch. All buildings, existing and proposed, shall be located accurately on the grid in plan at the height level selected to demonstrate compliance. For each street frontage zone, the areas of the building’s encroachment in Zone B and Zone C and the compensating recess areas not covered by any building in Zone A shall be measured on the encroachment grid.\n\n(b) Limits of encroachment\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section for existing buildings below specified heights, encroachment is limited as follows:\n\n(1) For each street frontage zone, at every height above the maximum front wall height at the street line, the area within Zone A that is not covered by a building and qualifies as compensating recess area shall, in the aggregate, equal or exceed the aggregate area in Zone B and Zone C that is encroached upon by a building at such height.\n\n(2) No part of a building shall encroach into Zone C unless it complies with the provisions of Section 81-265.\n\n(3) On corner lots, the projection of a building beyond the setback line or half-setback line on the narrower street shall not count as an encroachment except at heights above the maximum height permitted at the street line by the corner lot provisions in paragraph (b) of Section 81-262 (Maximum height of front wall at the street line).\n\n(c) Limitations on compensating recess\n\nCompensating recess areas are subject to the following limitations:\n\n(1) Any required compensating recess area shall extend without diminution of dimensions downward at least to the lowest level at which any encroachment into Zone B or Zone C occurs and upward to the sky. (See illustration of Extension Downward of Compensating Recess Area)\n\nEXTENSION DOWNWARD OF COMPENSATING RECESS AREA\n\n(81-264c1)\n\n(2) Compensating recess area shall be visible when viewed from at least one adjacent street along a line that intersects the front lot line of the zoning lot at right angles. (See illustration of Visibility of Compensating Recess Area)\n\nVISIBILITY OF COMPENSATING RECESS AREA\n\n(81-264c2)\n\n(3) The minimum length of a compensating recess, measured parallel to the street line, and behind the setback line, is 30 feet, except for any uncovered portion of an area that qualifies as Zone A under the middle one-third rule or an uncovered area located behind two intersecting setback lines. An uncovered area between the setback line and half-setback line that qualifies as Zone A under the middle one-third rule is not subject to the minimum length requirement. (See illustration of Minimum Length of Compensating Recess)\n\nMINIMUM LENGTH OF COMPENSATING RECESS\n\n(81-264c3)\n\n(4) Compensating recess area shall be within 100 feet of a front lot line.\n\n(d) Existing buildings on the zoning lot\n\nWhere a zoning lot contains an existing building which exceeds a height limit, an enlargement or development on such zoning lot shall comply with the following provisions:\n\n(1) For each street frontage zone, if the existing building is not more than 120 feet in height at any point and encroaches into Zone B or Zone C or beyond the ten-foot setback line along the frontage of a street 60 feet wide, or if the existing building is not more than 150 feet in height at any point and encroaches into Zone B or Zone C or beyond the ten-foot setback line along the frontage of a street 75 or more feet in width, the new building or enlargement is not required to compensate for such encroachment by the provision of compensating recess areas. Encroachment by such an existing building into Zone C or beyond the ten-foot setback line will not subject the new building or enlargement to the provisions of Section 81-265 unless the new building or enlargement also encroaches into Zone C.\n\n(2) For each street frontage zone, space above such existing building and within Zone A on the encroachment grid may count as compensating recess area for the new building or enlargement provided that such space is at or below the lowest level of any compensable encroachment by the new building or enlargement, that it is located within the same street frontage zone as that compensable encroachment, and that it qualifies in all respects under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this Section (Limitations on compensating recess).\n\n(3) For each street frontage zone, if an existing building more than 120 feet in height at any point encroaches into Zone B or Zone C or beyond the ten-foot setback line along the frontage of a street 60 feet wide, or if an existing building more than 150 feet in height at any point encroaches into Zone B or Zone C or beyond the ten-foot setback line along the frontage of a street 75 or more feet in width, the encroachment of such building into Zone B or Zone C or beyond the ten-foot setback line at any height shall be subject to the requirements for compensating recess areas set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this Section, as if it were a new building. Where such an existing building encroaches into Zone C or beyond the ten-foot setback line, the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) in Section 81-265 shall apply in addition to the provisions of this Section. (See illustration of Existing Buildings on the Zoning Lot)\n\nEXISTING BUILDINGS ON THE ZONING LOT\n\n(81-264d3)\n\nAbove the maximum height of a front wall at the street line as set forth in Section 81-262, a building may only encroach beyond the half-setback line if it complies with the provisions of this Section and if the area of compensating recess equals or exceeds the area of encroachment in Zone B and Zone C in accordance with the provisions of Section 81-264 (Encroachments and compensating recesses).\n\n(a) Special limitations\n\nNo encroachment beyond the half-setback line shall be within 30 feet of a side lot line. (See illustration of Prohibited and Allowed Encroachment Beyond Half-Setback Line)\n\nPROHIBITED AND ALLOWED ENCROACHMENT BEYOND\n\nHALF-SETBACK LINE\n\n(81-265a)\n\n(b) General provisions\n\nThe length, depth, height and area of encroachments along any street frontage all contribute to a building's impact on daylight access. In order to determine whether the depth of a building's encroachment into Zone C is justified, the length of the encroachment, measured parallel to the street line, and its height above curb level must also be evaluated. The extent of encroachment also must be considered in relation to the extent of the area of compensating recess in the same street frontage zone. The purpose of the length and height rule is to ensure, in the case of encroachments beyond the half-setback line, that the closer a building comes to the street line, the less will be the length of its encroachment, its height or both. (See illustration of Elements Analyzed)\n\nThe elements comprising this analysis are represented by symbols and are as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nDe\n\n=\n\ndepth of encroachment\n\nD\n\ndepth of setback line\n\nDe (depth of encroachment) means depth of encroachment beyond the setback line. Depth of encroachment is measured perpendicularly to the setback line.\n\nD (depth of setback line) means depth of setback line from the street line or depth of ten-foot setback line from the street line, whichever depth is greater.\n\n(2)\n\nLe\n\n=\n\nlength of encroachment\n\nL\n\nlength of front lot line\n\nLe (length of encroachment) means total length of encroachment outside the half-setback line. Length of encroachment is measured as the total length of the encroachments' projections on the street line.\n\nL (length of front lot line) means the length of the front lot line along the particular street. However, the length of the front lot line for the purposes of this Section shall not exceed 300 feet, irrespective of the actual lot line length.\n\n(3)\n\nLe\n\n=\n\nlength of encroachment\n\nLr\n\nlength of recess\n\nLe (length of encroachment) as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this Section.\n\nLr (length of recess) means total length of setback line not encroached upon by a building.\n\n(4)\n\nH\n\n=\n\nheight of encroachment\n\nL\n\nlength of front lot line\n\nH (height of encroachment) means the height of the encroachment above curb level.\n\nL (length of front lot line) as defined in paragraph (2) of this Section.\n\n(5)\n\nAr\n\n=\n\narea of compensating recess\n\nAe\n\narea of encroachment\n\nAr (area of compensating recess) means area of compensating recess in the particular street frontage zone. Area of compensating recess is calculated to a depth of 100 feet from the street line.\n\nAe (area of encroachment) means area of encroachment beyond the setback line. Area of encroachment is calculated to a depth of 100 feet from the street line.\n\nValues for the elements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) shall be found for each street frontage zone on which there is any encroachment beyond the half-setback line.\n\nELEMENTS ANALYZED\n\n(81-265b)\n\nThe elements, weighted according to the effects on daylight access, are represented in the formulas and charts that control the depth, length and height of encroachments, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this Section.\n\nEncroachments of proposed buildings or enlargements beyond the half-setback line are permitted only if in compliance at every point with the formulas in paragraph (c) of this Section. Aside from this general requirement, specified points at which the length, depth, height and area rules shall be applied are presented in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Section.\n\n(c) Encroachment limitations by Formulas 1 and 2\n\nWhere applicants elect to have their buildings regulated by the formulas, buildings shall comply with both Formula 1 and Formula 2 as set forth in this paragraph. Elements of the formulas and the symbols by which they are represented are as set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section.\n\nFormula 2:\n\nMinimum\n\nLr\n\n=\n\nL\n\n3.5\n\nThe maximum height of encroachment (H) allowed by Formula 1 may be modified for certain conditions, as follows:\n\n(1) For short frontages\n\nFor any frontage less than 200 feet in length, the maximum\n\nH\n\nL\n\nfound by applying Formula 1 may be increased by the following multiplier:\n\n2\n\n—\n\nL\n\n200\n\n(2) For large areas of compensating recess\n\nTo the extent that the aggregate area of compensating recess (Ar) exceeds the aggregate area of encroachment (Ae), the maximum\n\n(\n\nH\n\n)\n\nL\n\nfound by applying Formula 1 may be increased by the following multiplier:\n\n1\n\n+\n\n.067 Ar\n\nAe\n\nFor the purposes of this modification, the measurement of the area of compensating recess (Ar) and the area of encroachment (Ae) in each particular street frontage zone shall be made on the encroachment grid at the height level for which encroachments beyond the half-setback line are checked. The encroachment grid shall include all street frontage zones. (Ar) shall include all areas of compensating recess in the particular street frontage zone, whether or not connected, and (Ae) shall include all encroachments in both Zone B and Zone C in the same street frontage zone, whether or not such encroachments are connected.\n\n(d) Measurement of encroachments\n\nThe points at which the formulas are applied will depend upon the shape and dimensions of the encroachments beyond the half-setback line and shall be in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (e) of this Section.\n\nWhere the encroachments along a single street frontage are not connected outside the half-setback line, each encroachment shall be measured separately in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e). However, at any given height, where such non-contiguous encroachments occur, the encroachments shall be examined together, and the length of encroachment (Le) shall be the total of the (Le) for the individual encroachments. (See illustration of Non-contiguous Encroachments)\n\nNON-CONTIGUOUS ENCROACHMENTS\n\n(81-265d)\n\n(e) Heights and depths at which formulas are applied\n\nHeights and depths at which the formulas shall be applied are set forth in this paragraph. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this Section, the applicant shall demonstrate that there is no height at which the proposed building or enlargement fails to comply with the formulas in paragraph (c) of this Section.\n\n(1) Standard requirement where length of encroachment is uniform\n\nWhere the length of the encroachment (Le) is uniform for the entire height of the encroachment (H) and the entire depth (De) at every height, the length, depth and height rules expressed in the formulas shall be applied only at the height where (De/D) is greatest and at the outermost edge of the encroachment. (See illustration of Uniform Length of Encroachment)\n\nUNIFORM LENGTH OF ENCROACHMENT\n\n(81-265e1)\n\n(2) Standard requirement where length of encroachment is not uniform\n\nWhere the length of the encroachment (Le) is not uniform, the rules shall be applied at the height level where (De/D) is greatest and also at the height level where the length of encroachment (Le) is greatest. If the greatest length of encroachment is uniform for part of the building's height, the rules shall be applied at the highest level at which such greatest length of encroachment occurs. (See illustrations Where Length of Encroachment Is Not Uniform).\n\nIf for a particular height level, the length of the encroachment (Le) varies with the depth of the encroachment (De), the largest (Le) of this encroachment shall be used together with the largest (De) in applying the rules as if the encroachment were of uniform length as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this Section.\n\nWHERE LENGTH OF ENCROACHMENT IS NOT UNIFORM\n\n(81-265e2)\n\n(f) Encroachments by existing buildings\n\nWhen a zoning lot contains an existing building which encroaches beyond a half-setback line or a ten-foot setback line, an enlargement or development on such zoning lot shall comply with the following provisions:\n\n(1) Existing buildings below specified heights\n\n(i) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this Section, an existing building not more than 120 feet in height shall not be considered in applying the length and height rules even though a portion of such building encroaches beyond the half-setback line or ten-foot setback line along a 60 foot wide street and an existing building not more than 150 feet in height shall not be considered in applying the length and height rules even though a portion of such building encroaches beyond the half-setback line or ten-foot setback line along a street 75 or more feet in width.\n\n(ii) However, the area occupied by the existing building shall be included in the calculation of (Ar/Ae) for the modification of Formula 1 allowed in the case of large areas of compensating recess, as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this Section.\n\n(2) Existing buildings above specified heights\n\nWhere an existing building more than 120 feet in height encroaches beyond the half-setback line or ten-foot setback line along a 60-foot wide street or where an existing building more than 150 feet in height encroaches beyond the half-setback line or ten-foot setback line along a street 75 or more feet in width, the following provisions, in addition to those of paragraph (d)(3) of Section 81-264 (Encroachments and compensating recesses), shall apply:\n\n(i) no new construction on the zoning lot shall encroach beyond the half-setback line along any street, and\n\n(ii) the length and height rules of this Section shall not apply.\n\nA zoning lot is scored by determining the number and the value of the daylight squares the building blocks when viewed from the vantage point, compared to the total number of daylight squares available within the daylight boundaries as determined in paragraph (f) of Section 81-273 (Rules for plotting buildings on the daylight evaluation chart) and above an elevation angle of 70 degrees.\n\n(a) Assign daylight values\n\nThe daylight squares on the daylight evaluation chart are each assigned a value.\n\n(1) Except along vantage streets designated for street wall continuity (see Section 81-43), each unblocked daylight square below the curved line representing an elevation of 70 degrees has a positive value of 0.3 and each unblocked subsquare below the same curved line has a positive value of 0.03.\n\n(2) Each blocked daylight square above the curved line representing an elevation of 70 degrees has a negative value of 1.0.\n\n(3) Where a building blocks any portion of a subsquare the building is charged with blocking the entire subsquare in computing the daylight evaluation score. Each blocked subsquare has a negative value of 1.0/10 or 0.1.\n\n(4) The daylight squares and subsquares which are on the far side of the profile curve are assigned additional weighted values set forth on the chart below.

The total penalty is the additional weighted value of the daylight square multiplied by the negative value of the subsquare. The penalty is applied even if the subsquare does not lie entirely beyond the curve.\n\n(b) Calculate daylight blockage\n\nCount the number of blocked daylight squares and subsquares which are above the curved line representing an elevation of 70 degrees. A negative sign is to be given to this number. Total value of daylight blockage in the example is -20.5.\n\n(c) Calculate unblocked daylight credit\n\nCount the number of unblocked daylight squares which are below the curved line representing an elevation of 70 degrees and within the area defined by the intersection of the far lot line with the street line of the vantage street and the intersection of the near lot line with the street line of the vantage street. The total is given a positive value and multiplied by 0.3, the value of these daylight squares. This provision is not applicable where the vantage street is a designated street on which street wall continuity is required by the provisions of Section 81-43 (Street Wall Continuity Along Designated Streets). In the example, the number and value of squares unblocked below 70 degrees = +0.0.\n\n(d) Calculate profile daylight blockage\n\nCount the number of blocked daylight squares which are entirely on the far side of the profile curve when viewed from the vantage point and the number of blocked or partially blocked subsquares which are on the far side of the profile curve. All of these daylight squares and subsquares are given a negative sign, multiplied by their respective weighted values in the table in paragraph (a)(4) of this Section and the products added. Subsquares are counted as one tenth of a daylight square. In the example, the total value of profile daylight blockage = -0.45.\n\n(e) Calculate available daylight\n\nCount the number of daylight squares available to the site. This is the total number of daylight squares and subsquares, calculated to the nearest tenth, that are above the curved line representing the boundaries of the potential sky area available to the site, said boundaries being delineated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of Section 81-273 (Rules for plotting buildings on the daylight evaluation chart). Available daylight in the example is 89.9.\n\n(f) Calculate daylight remaining\n\nCalculate the remaining or unblocked daylight by adding the results of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this Section. Daylight remaining in the example is (-20.5) + (0.0) + (-0.45) + (89.9) = 68.95.\n\n(g) Calculate daylight score\n\nCompute the remaining daylight score from paragraph (f) of this Section, as a percentage of the available daylight from paragraph (e) of this Section. The percentage is the daylight score for the proposed building from that vantage point. In the example, the daylight score is 68.95/89.9 = 76.70 percent for vantage point one (V1).\n\n(h) Calculate overall daylight score\n\n(1) The street score is the arithmetic mean of all the scores from all vantage points along a vantage street. When a zoning lot fronts on only one street, the street score is also the overall score. Where a zoning lot has more than one street frontage along any one vantage street, the street score is the average of all those individual street frontage scores computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 81-275 (Special conditions), weighted by the lengths of all those street frontages.\n\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on more than one street, the overall score is the average of the street scores, weighted by the length of their respective vantage street frontages.\n\n(i) The passing score\n\nTo be in compliance with these regulations, a zoning lot must have an overall score of not less than 75 percent, with no single street frontage having a street score of less than 66 percent. If a zoning lot fronts only on one street, a daylight evaluation score of not less than 75 percent is required for that street frontage. If a street score is less than 66 percent, or if the overall daylight score is less than the passing score of 75 percent, a modest improvement in either the street score or the overall score may be obtained by scoring the relative reflectivity of the building's surface, as specified in Section 81-276 (Modification of score for reflectivity). The passing daylight score of 75 percent is equivalent to the average daylight levels of Midtown buildings built as-of-right under the 1916 and 1961 Zoning Resolutions. The minimum requirement of 66 percent on one frontage is equivalent to the daylight level of any interior lot building built in Midtown under the 1916 Zoning Resolution in a two-times height district. However, if any one frontage is less than 75 percent, other frontages must be greater than 75 percent to reach the passing overall daylight score. This allows flexibility in building design while maintaining daylight standards within the levels established by buildings built as-of-right under the 1916 and 1961 Zoning Resolutions. (See illustration of Daylight Evaluation Score Results)\n\nDAYLIGHT EVALUATION SCORE RESULTS\n\n(81-274i)\n\nAdjacent lot\n\nFor the purposes of Section 81-60, inclusive, an \"adjacent lot\" is:\n\n(a) a zoning lot that is contiguous to the lot occupied by the designated landmark building or other structure or one that is across a street and opposite the lot occupied by such designated landmark building or other structure, or, in the case of a corner lot, one that fronts on the same street intersection as the lot occupied by such landmark building or other structure; and\n\n(b) in C5-3 or C6-6 Districts, a zoning lot that is contiguous to, or across a street and opposite another lot or series of lots that, except for the intervention of streets or street intersections, extend to the lot occupied by such designated landmark building or other structure. All such lots shall be in the same ownership (fee ownership or ownership as defined under zoning lot in Section 12-10 (DEFINITIONS).\n\nGranting lot\n\nFor the purposes of Section 81-60, inclusive, a “granting lot” shall mean a zoning lot that contains a landmark building or other structure. Such granting lot may transfer development rights pursuant to Sections 81-632 (Special permit for transfer of development rights from landmarks to the Vanderbilt Corridor Subarea), 81-642 (Transfer of development rights from landmarks to qualifying sites), or 81-653 (Special permit for transfer of development rights from landmarks to non-qualifying sites).\n\nLandmark building or other structure\n\nFor the purposes of Section 81-60, inclusive, a “landmark building or other structure” shall include any structure designated as a landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission pursuant to the New York City Charter and Administrative Code, but shall not include those portions of zoning lots used for cemetery purposes, statues, monuments or bridges.

The Fund shall be utilized, at the discretion of the Public Realm Improvement Fund Governing Group, to provide funding to implement improvements to the East Midtown Subdistrict, and its immediate vicinity, in the Borough of Manhattan. Upon receipt of any contribution, the Public Realm Improvement Fund Governing Group or the Department of City Planning shall notify the Comptroller of the City of New York and the Speaker of the New York City Council and promptly deposit it into the Fund.\n\nPublic Realm Improvement Fund Development Rights Valuation\n\nFor the purposes of Section 81-60, inclusive, the “Public Realm Improvement Fund Development Rights Valuation” (“Development Rights Valuation”) shall be a value per square foot of transferable development rights in the East Midtown Subdistrict, which shall provide a basis for establishing a minimum contribution to the Public Realm Improvement Fund. As of August 9, 2017, the Development Rights Valuation shall be set at $307.45 per square foot.\n\nWhen proposing an adjustment to the Development Rights Valuation, the Department of City Planning shall undertake a transferrable development rights valuation study conducted by qualified professionals utilizing industry best practices. The City Planning Commission shall, by rule, review and adjust the Development Rights Valuation, pursuant to the City Administrative Procedures Act not more than once every three years and not less than once every five years.\n\nAn applicant, upon written request to the Commission, may request a transferable development rights valuation study to evaluate whether the Development Rights Valuation should be modified for a particular qualifying site based upon any recent changes in market conditions within the Subdistrict. The study must be paid for by the applicant and completed within a one-year timeframe. The Department of City Planning shall initiate the study, to be conducted by qualified professionals utilizing industry best practices. Where the study demonstrates that the value of the development rights for the qualifying site is less than the Development Rights Valuation, the Commission shall, by certification, and in connection with a certification pursuant to Section 81-642 (Transfer of development rights from landmarks to qualifying sites), modify the required contribution to 20 percent of the adjusted valuation.\n\nPublic Realm Improvement Fund Governing Group\n\nFor the purposes of Section 81-60, inclusive, the “Public Realm Improvement Fund Governing Group” (the “Governing Group”) shall be established to administer the Public Realm Improvement Fund (the “Fund”), and shall consist of 13 members: seven members shall be representatives of City agencies, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the Mayor; one member shall be a representative of a citywide civic organization, appointed by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President; one member shall be a representative of the Office of the Manhattan Borough President; one member shall be a representative of the New York City Council member representing the City Council district encompassing the largest portion of the East Midtown Subdistrict; one member shall be a representative of the Speaker of the City Council; one member shall be a representative of Manhattan Community Board 5; and one member shall be a representative of Manhattan Community Board 6.

In addition, any application shall include materials demonstrating the sustainable design measures of the building, including its anticipated energy performance, and the degree to which such performance exceeds either the New York City Energy Conservation Code (NYCECC) or the Building Performance Rating method of the applicable version and edition of American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, Inc., Standard 90.1 (ASHRAE 90.1), as referenced within the NYCECC.\n\n(b) Findings\n\nThe Commission shall find that:\n\n(1) for a development or enlargement not located on two wide streets, the amount of additional floor area being granted is appropriate based on the extent to which any or all of the following physical factors are present in the development or enlargement:\n\n(i) direct access to subway stations and other rail mass transit facilities;\n\n(ii) the size of the zoning lot;\n\n(iii) the amount of wide street frontage; and\n\n(iv) adjacency to the open area above Grand Central Terminal;\n\n(2) for above-grade improvements to the pedestrian circulation network that are located:\n\n(i) on-site, the proposed improvements will, to the extent practicable, consist of a prominent space of generous proportions and quality design that is inviting to the public; improve pedestrian circulation and provide suitable amenities for the occupants; front upon a street or a pedestrian circulation space in close proximity to and within view of and accessible from an adjoining sidewalk; provide or be surrounded by active uses; be surrounded by transparent materials; provide connections to pedestrian circulation spaces in the immediate vicinity; and be designed in a manner that combines the separate elements within such space into a cohesive and harmonious site plan, resulting in a high-quality public space; or\n\n(ii) off-site, the proposed improvements to the public right-of-way, to the extent practicable, will consist of significant street and sidewalk designs that improve pedestrian circulation in the surrounding area; provide comfortable places for walking and resting, opportunities for planting and improvements to pedestrian safety; and create a better overall user experience of the above-grade pedestrian circulation network that supports the surrounding area as a high-density business district. Where the area of such improvement is to be established into a pedestrian plaza that will undergo a public design and review process through the Department of Transportation subsequent to the approval of this special permit, the Commission may waive this finding;\n\n(3) for below-grade improvements to the pedestrian or mass transit circulation network, the proposed improvements will provide:\n\n(i) significant and generous connections from the above-grade pedestrian circulation network and surrounding streets to the below-grade pedestrian circulation network;\n\n(ii) major improvements to public accessibility in the below-grade pedestrian circulation network between and within subway stations and other rail mass transit facilities in and around Grand Central Terminal through the provision of new connections, or the addition to or reconfiguration of existing connections; or\n\n(iii) significant enhancements to the environment of subway stations and other rail mass transit facilities including daylight access, noise abatement, air quality improvement, lighting, finishes, way-finding or rider orientation, where practicable;\n\n(4) the public benefit derived from the proposed above- or below-grade improvements to the pedestrian or mass transit circulation network merits the amount of additional floor area being granted to the proposed development or enlargement pursuant to this special permit;\n\n(5) the design of the ground floor level of the building:\n\n(i) contributes to a lively streetscape through a combination of retail uses that enliven the pedestrian experience, ample amounts of transparency and pedestrian connections that facilitate fluid movement between the building and adjoining public spaces; and demonstrates consideration for the location of pedestrian circulation space, building entrances, and the types of uses fronting upon the street or adjoining public spaces;\n\n(ii) will substantially improve the accessibility of the overall pedestrian circulation network, reduce points of pedestrian congestion and, where applicable, establish more direct and generous pedestrian connections to Grand Central Terminal; and\n\n(iii) will be well-integrated with on-site, above- or below-grade improvements required by this Section, where applicable and practicable;\n\n(6) the design of the proposed building:\n\n(i) ensures light and air to the surrounding streets and public spaces through the use of setbacks, recesses and other forms of articulation, and the tower top produces a distinctive addition to the Midtown Manhattan skyline which is well-integrated with the remainder of the building;\n\n(ii) demonstrates an integrated and well-designed facade, taking into account factors such as street wall articulation and fenestration, that creates a prominent and distinctive building which complements the character of the surrounding area, especially Grand Central Terminal; and\n\n(iii) involves a program that includes an intensity and mix of uses that are harmonious with the type of uses in the surrounding area;\n\n(7) the proposed development or enlargement comprehensively integrates sustainable measures into the building and site design that:\n\n(i) meet or exceed best practices in sustainable design; and\n\n(ii) will substantially reduce energy usage for the building, as compared to comparable buildings; and\n\n(8) in addition:\n\n(i) the increase in floor area being proposed in the development or enlargement will not unduly increase the bulk, density of population or intensity of uses to the detriment of the surrounding area; and\n\n(ii) all of the separate elements within the proposed development or enlargement, including above- or below-grade improvements, the ground floor level, building design, and sustainable design measures, are well–integrated and will advance the applicable goals of the Special Midtown District described in Section 81-00 (GENERAL PURPOSES).\n\n(c) Additional requirements\n\nPrior to the grant of a special permit pursuant to this Section, and to the extent required by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) or any other City or State agencies with control and responsibility for the area in which a proposed improvement is to be located, the applicant shall execute an agreement, setting forth the obligations of the owner, its successors and assigns, to establish a process for design development and a preliminary construction schedule for the proposed improvement; construct the proposed improvement; where applicable, establish a program for maintenance; and, where applicable, establish a schedule of hours of public access for the proposed improvement. Where the MTA, or any other City or State agencies with control and responsibility for the area of a proposed improvement, deems necessary, such executed agreement shall set forth obligations of the applicant to provide a performance bond or other security for completion of the improvement in a form acceptable to the MTA or any other such agencies.\n\nWhere the proposed development or enlargement proposes an off-site improvement located in an area to be acquired by a City or State agency, the applicant may propose a phasing plan to sequence the construction of such off-site improvement. To determine if such phasing plan is reasonable, the Commission may consult with the City or State agency that intends to acquire the area of the proposed improvement.\n\nPrior to obtaining a foundation permit or building permit from the Department of Buildings, a written declaration of restrictions, in a form acceptable to the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission, setting forth the obligations of the owner to construct, and, where applicable, maintain and provide public access to public improvements provided pursuant to this Section, shall be recorded against such property in the Office of the Register of the City of New York (County of New York). Proof of recordation of the declaration of restrictions shall be submitted in a form acceptable to the Department of City Planning.\n\nExcept where a phasing plan is approved by the Commission, no temporary certificate of occupancy shall be granted by the Department of Buildings for the portion of the building utilizing bonus floor area granted pursuant to the provisions of this Section until the required improvements have been substantially completed, as determined by the Chairperson, acting in consultation with the MTA, or any other City or State agencies with control and responsibility for the area where a proposed improvement is to be located, where applicable, and such improvements are usable by the public. Such portion of the building utilizing bonus floor area shall be designated by the Commission in drawings included in the declaration of restrictions filed pursuant to this paragraph.\n\nNo permanent certificate of occupancy shall be granted by the Department of Buildings for the portion of the building utilizing bonus floor area until all improvements have been completed in accordance with the approved plans, as determined by the Chairperson, acting in consultation with the MTA, or any other City or State agencies with control and responsibility for the area where a proposed improvement is to be located, where applicable.\n\nThe Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to minimize adverse effects on the character of the surrounding area.\n\n(a) On qualifying sites\n\nWhere a zoning lot contains an easement volume for pedestrian access to a subway station or rail mass transit facility and such zoning lot is proposed to be developed or, where permitted, enlarged in accordance with the provisions for qualifying sites, such existing easement volume shall be preserved, or reconfigured in accordance with standards and terms approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), as part of such development or enlargement. Any reconfiguration shall be constructed by the owner of the development or enlargement.\n\nFor such developments or, where permitted, enlargements, the owner shall submit a site plan showing a proposed location and size of the transit easement volume that would provide access between the street and the below-grade subway station or rail mass transit facility and be compatible with the proposed development or enlargement on the zoning lot for joint approval and final certification by the MTA and the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission. The MTA and the Chairperson shall comment on such site plan within 45 days of its receipt and may, within such 45-day period or following its expiration, permit the granting of an excavation permit while the location and size of the transit easement volume is being finalized. Upon joint approval of a site plan by the MTA and the Chairperson, copies of such certification shall be forwarded by the Chairperson to the Department of Buildings.\n\nLegal instruments creating a transit easement volume shall be executed and recorded in a form acceptable to the City. The execution and recording of such instruments shall be a precondition to the issuance of any foundation permit, new building permit, or alteration permit by the Department of Buildings allowing such development or enlargement.\n\n(b) On qualifying sites in the Grand Central Transit Improvement Zone Subarea or in the Other Transit Improvement Zone Subarea\n\nFor developments or, where permitted, enlargements involving ground floor level construction on qualifying sites in the Grand Central Transit Improvement Zone Subarea, or in the Other Transit Improvement Zone Subarea, as shown on Map 2 (East Midtown Subdistrict and Subareas) in Appendix A of this Chapter, in addition to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section, as applicable, a transit easement volume may be required on such zoning lot for public access between the street and a below-grade subway station or rail mass transit facility.\n\nPrior to filing any applications with the Department of Buildings for an excavation permit, foundation permit, new building permit or alteration permit for a development or enlargement, the owner of the zoning lot shall file an application with the MTA and the Chairperson requesting a certification as to whether or not a transit easement volume is required on the zoning lot.\n\nWithin 60 days of receipt of such application, the MTA and the Chairperson shall jointly certify whether or not a transit easement volume is required on the zoning lot. Failure to certify within the 60-day period will release the owner from any obligation to provide a transit easement volume on such zoning lot.\n\nWhen the MTA and the Chairperson indicate that a transit easement volume is required, the owner shall submit a site plan showing a proposed location and size of the transit easement volume that would provide access between the street and the below-grade subway station or rail mass transit facility and be compatible with the proposed development or enlargement on the zoning lot for joint approval and final certification by the MTA and the Chairperson. The MTA and the Chairperson shall comment on such site plan within 45 days of its receipt and may, within such 45-day period or following its expiration, permit the granting of an excavation permit while the location and size of the transit easement volume is being finalized. Upon joint approval of a site plan by the MTA and the Chairperson, copies of such certification shall be forwarded by the Chairperson to the Department of Buildings.\n\nLegal instruments creating a transit easement volume shall be executed and recorded in a form acceptable to the City. The execution and recording of such instruments shall be a precondition to the issuance of any foundation permit, new building permit, or alteration permit by the Department of Buildings allowing such development or enlargement.\n\nIf a transit easement volume is required on the zoning lot, pursuant to the provisions of this Section, an off-street subway or rail mass transit access improvement may be constructed and maintained by either the owner of the development or enlargement, or the MTA, as follows:\n\n(1) where such mass transit access improvement is constructed and maintained by the owner of the development or enlargement:\n\n(i) such mass transit access shall be improved to the standards set forth in Section 81-48 and shall be approved by the MTA, and shall comply with the following:\n\n(a) where the lobby of the building adjoins such mass transit access, in addition to mass transit access to the street, such mass transit access shall provide a direct connection to the lobby of the building that is open during normal business hours; and\n\n(b) such mass transit access shall provide directional signs in accordance with the provisions of Section 81-412 (Directional signs). Such signs shall be exempt from the maximum surface area of non-illuminated signs permitted by Section 32-642 (Non-illuminated signs); and\n\n(ii) no temporary certificate of occupancy shall be granted by the Department of Buildings for the building until the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission, acting in consultation with the MTA, has certified that the improvements are substantially complete and usable by the public.\n\n(2) where such mass transit access improvement is constructed and maintained by the MTA:\n\n(i) where construction of the transit easement volume by the MTA is not contemporaneous with the construction of the development:\n\n(a) any underground walls constructed along the front lot line of a zoning lot shall contain a knockout panel, not less than 12 feet wide, below curb level down to the bottom of the easement. The actual location and size of such knockout panel shall be determined through consultation with the MTA; and\n\n(b) temporary construction access shall be granted to the MTA on portions of the zoning lot outside of the transit easement volume, as necessary, to enable construction within and connection to the transit easement volume; and\n\n(ii) in the event that the MTA has approved of obstructions associated with the development or enlargement within the transit easement volume, such as building columns or footings, such construction and maintenance shall exclude any such obstructions within the transit easement volume.\n\n(c) In other locations\n\nFor portions of the Special Midtown District within the Special Transit Land Use District, where, as part of a development or enlargement involving ground floor level construction, a transit easement volume is required by the MTA to accommodate, whether singly or in any combination, light wells, stairs, ramps, escalators, elevators, passageways, or ancillary facilities required to support the functioning of subway station or rail mass transit facilities, including, but not limited to, emergency egress or ventilation structures, the MTA shall, in consultation with the owner of the zoning lot and the City Planning Commission, determine the appropriate type of transit easement and reasonable dimensions for such transit easement volume.\n\nThe floor space occupied by any transit easement volume required pursuant to this Section shall not count as floor area. Where access improvements are constructed by the owner of the zoning lot, each square foot of mass transit access may constitute three square feet of pedestrian circulation space required pursuant to Section 81-45 (Pedestrian Circulation Space), not to exceed 3,000 square feet.\n\n(a) Building energy design requirements for buildings on qualifying sites\n\nTo ensure advancement of goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, buildings on qualifying sites shall either:\n\n(1) utilize a district steam system for the building’s heating and hot water systems; or\n\n(2) the core and shell of such building shall exceed the standards of the chosen commercial building energy-efficiency compliance path within the 2016 New York City Energy Conservation Code (NYCECC), by three percent.\n\nCompliance with the provisions of this Section shall be demonstrated to the Department of Buildings at the time of issuance of a new building permit for a development or, where permitted, an enlargement on a qualifying site.\n\nThe City Planning Commission may, by rule, modify the standards of this Section, as necessary, to ensure that the environmental standards established herein, meet or exceed the current best practices in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n(b) Mandatory publicly accessible space requirements for qualifying sites\n\nA qualifying site shall provide a publicly accessible space, open or enclosed, as defined herein, in accordance with the size provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this Section and the design requirements of paragraph (b)(2). Each publicly accessible space shall require a certification by the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission, pursuant to Section 37-78 (Compliance), as modified herein.\n\nFor the purposes of this Chapter on a qualifying site, a “publicly accessible space” shall be defined as an open or enclosed area provided for public use and enjoyment on the zoning lot. An “open publicly accessible space” shall be defined as a publicly accessible space, that is open to the sky on a qualifying site, and an “enclosed publicly accessible space” shall be defined as a fully enclosed, climate-controlled publicly accessible space on a qualifying site. The design standards contained in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this Section for an enclosed publicly accessible space are intended to serve the same purposes outlined for public plazas in Section 37-70.\n\n(1) Type and minimum size\n\n(i) A qualifying site with a lot area of at least 30,000 square feet but less than 45,000 square feet shall provide a publicly accessible space, open or enclosed, with an area of not less than 10 percent of the lot area of the zoning lot.\n\n(ii) A qualifying site with a lot area of 45,000 square feet but less than 65,000 square feet shall provide an open publicly accessible space with an area of not less than 10 percent of the lot area of the zoning lot, except that where the provisions of Sections 81-40 (MANDATORY DISTRICT PLAN ELEMENTS), inclusive, and 81-67 (Special Mandatory District Plan Element Requirements), inclusive, are applicable to the qualifying site and preclude an open publicly accessible space from being provided on the qualifying site, an enclosed publicly accessible space shall be provided in the proposed building.\n\nIn addition to complying with paragraphs (a) through (d) of Section 37-78, each application for an enclosed publicly accessible space shall demonstrate which of the applicable provisions of Sections 81-40 and 81-67, inclusive, conflict with the design requirements set forth in 37-70, inclusive, and that they necessitate the provision of the enclosed publicly accessible space in lieu of an open publicly accessible space.\n\n(iii) A qualifying site with a lot area of 65,000 square feet or greater shall provide an open publicly accessible space with an area of not less than 10,000 square feet. Where such qualifying site has a through lot portion, such qualifying site shall provide an open publicly accessible space across the through lot portion.\n\nHowever, for a qualifying site with a lot area of 80,000 square feet or greater that includes an existing entrance to a rail mass-transit facility located outside the through lot portion of the zoning lot existing on May 8, 2019, such open publicly accessible space may be located so as to include the entrance to a rail mass-transit facility, provided that such open publicly accessible space adjoins a street or a required sidewalk widening, as applicable.\n\n(2) Design requirements for publicly accessible spaces\n\n(i) Open publicly accessible space\n\nFor open publicly accessible space, the provisions of Section 37-70, inclusive, shall apply, except that the provisions of Section 37-713 (Locational restrictions) shall not apply. In addition, the following modifications or waivers may be applied under certain circumstances:\n\n(a) For qualifying sites where an open publicly accessible space is permitted to adjoin a street or a required sidewalk widening to accommodate an entrance to a rail mass-transit facility in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this Section, and the majority of the subsurface area of such qualifying site is occupied by a railroad right-of-way, thus imposing practical difficulty in configuring the building or required publicly accessible space:\n\n(1) the provisions of Sections 81-42 (Retail Continuity Along Designated Streets), 81-43 (Street Wall Continuity Along Designated Streets) and 81-671 (Special street wall requirements), paragraph (d) of Section 37-715 (Requirements for major portions of public plazas) need not apply;\n\n(2) where street wall requirements are not applied, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 37-726 (Permitted obstructions) may be modified to allow a portion of an open publicly accessible space to be covered by a building or other structure, provided that there is an average separation of at least 50 feet between the level of such open publicly accessible space and any portion of building above, and further provided that any such portion shall be located no lower than 40 feet above the level of such open publicly accessible space. In addition, such building or other structure shall not obstruct more than 60 percent of the area of such open publicly accessible space;\n\n(3) the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) of Section 37-76 (Mandatory Allocation of Frontages for Permitted Uses) need not apply, where at least one food service kiosk shall abut or be included within such open publicly accessible space. The size limitations of paragraph (a), and the certification requirements of paragraph (c) of Section 37-73 shall not apply to such kiosk; and\n\n(4) where the provisions of paragraph (d) of Section 37-715 are not applied, the provisions of paragraph (a) of Section 37-721 (Sidewalk frontage) may be modified to require no more than 40 percent of the area within 15 feet of any such street line to be free of obstructions and the provisions of Section 37-741 (Seating), may be modified to exclude the length of any such street line from the calculation of the amount of seating required within 15 feet of such street line.\n\n(b) For qualifying sites where an open publicly accessible space is permitted to adjoin a street or a required sidewalk widening to accommodate an entrance to a rail mass-transit facility in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this Section, the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission shall permit modifications to the remaining design provisions of Section 37-70, inclusive, upon certification to the Department of Buildings that such modifications are limited to those that directly address practical difficulties resulting from the presence of the entrance to a rail mass-transit facility within the open publicly accessible space. Any application shall include materials demonstrating the extent of modifications necessary. The Chairperson, in consultation with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, shall determine the appropriate amount of above-grade pedestrian circulation space into and around the entrance to such rail mass-transit facility.\n\n(ii) Enclosed publicly accessible space\n\nFor enclosed publicly accessible spaces, the following shall apply:\n\n(a) An enclosed publicly accessible space shall have a minimum height of 30 feet or the height of the ground floor level, whichever is greater, and a minimum width and depth, at any point, of 30 feet. Such enclosed publicly accessible space shall be located on the ground floor level of the building and shall be directly accessible from an adjoining street or publicly accessible open area that the area fronts. A minimum of one entrance to the enclosed publicly accessible space shall be provided from the adjoining street on which it fronts; however, if it fronts on more than one street, such entrance shall be from the street with the longer frontage. The aggregate width of doorways accessing such enclosed publicly accessible space shall not be less than 10 feet in width.\n\n(b) All ground floor level street walls enclosing the enclosed publicly accessible space shall be treated with clear, untinted, transparent materials. Such transparent materials shall occupy at least 70 percent of the surface area of such ground floor level street wall between a height of two feet and 30 feet, or the height of the ground floor ceiling, whichever is higher, as measured from the adjoining sidewalk. Such enclosed publicly accessible space shall be heated or air-conditioned, and the standards for heating, ventilating and air-conditioning shall be at least equal to those of the lobby for the principal use of the building.\n\n(c) Public access to the enclosed publicly accessible space shall be provided, at a minimum, from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. However, if a cafe or kiosk, pursuant to Section 37-73 (Kiosks and Open Air Cafes), is provided within, such enclosed publicly accessible space shall remain open to the public during the hours of operation of the cafe or kiosk, if such hours are longer than otherwise required by this Section.\n\nThe hours of access shall be included on all required entry plaques and information plaques in accordance with the provisions of Section 37-751 (Public space signage systems) and for through block enclosed publicly accessible spaces, an information plaque shall be provided in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(viii) of Section 37-53 (Design standards for Pedestrian Circulation Spaces).\n\n(d) The provisions of Sections 37-718 (Paving), 37-722 (Level of plaza), 37-728 (Standards of accessibility for persons with disabilities), 37-744 (Litter receptacles), 37-745 (Bicycle parking), 37-746 (Drinking fountains), 37-748 (Additional amenities), 37-752 (Prohibition signs), 37-753 (Accessory signs) and 37-77 (Maintenance) shall apply to enclosed publicly accessible spaces.\n\n(e) The provisions of Section 37-723 (Circulation paths) shall apply to enclosed publicly accessible spaces. In addition, for enclosed publicly accessible spaces provided in conjunction with subway entrances and/or designed to provide connection to above- and/or below-grade improvements, an unobstructed pedestrian circulation path shall be provided from at least one entrance of the enclosed publicly accessible space to such subway entrance and to such above- and/or below-grade improvements.\n\n(f) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 37-726 (Permitted obstructions) shall apply to enclosed publicly accessible spaces and are modified as follows:\n\n(1) structural columns shall be considered permitted obstructions. The area occupied by such structural columns shall be excluded from the area calculations for the enclosed publicly accessible space. In addition, interior structural columns shall have an aggregate area of no more than two percent of the total enclosed publicly accessible space. Such columns shall not be considered permitted obstructions in any circulation path; and\n\n(2) a cafe or kiosk permitted by certification pursuant to Section 37-73 (Kiosks and Open Air Cafes) shall be considered a permitted obstruction within an enclosed publicly accessible space and may not occupy more than 20 percent of the enclosed publicly accessible space.\n\n(g) The provisions of Section 37-741 for seating shall apply to enclosed publicly accessible spaces, except that such provisions are modified as follows:\n\n(1) the requirements of seating within 15 feet of a street line shall not apply;\n\n(2) all of the linear seating capacity may be in moveable seats. All such moveable seats must remain in the enclosed publicly accessible space during the hours of operation; and\n\n(3) the requirement that seats facing walls be located a minimum of six feet from such wall shall only apply to fixed seating.\n\n(h) The requirements of Section 37-742 for planting and trees shall apply to enclosed publicly accessible spaces, except that the surface area of any vertical planting may be included in the calculation of the total area of planting beds that are provided, and trees shall not be required.\n\n(i) All enclosed publicly accessible spaces shall be illuminated with a minimum level of illumination of not less than five horizontal foot candles (lumens per foot) throughout the space.
