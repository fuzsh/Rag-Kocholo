        "text": "What is status epilepticus?\n\nA seizure involves abnormal electrical activity in the brain. It affects both the mind and the body. Many problems can cause you to have a seizure. These include:\n\nHigh fever\n\nBrain infections\n\nAbnormal sodium or blood sugar levels\n\nHead injuries\n\nIf you have epilepsy , you may have seizures again and again. You may have status epilepticus if you have a seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or if you have more than one seizure without returning to a normal level of consciousness between episodes. This is a medical emergency. Call 911. It may lead to permanent brain damage or death.\n\nStatus epilepticus is very rare. Most people with epilepsy will never have it. This condition is more common in young children and elderly adults.\n\nThis condition can occur as:\n\nConvulsive status epilepticus. This type occurs with convulsions. It may be more likely to lead to long-term injury. Convulsions may involve jerking motions, grunting sounds, drooling, and rapid eye movements.\n\nNonconvulsive status epilepticus. People with this type may appear confused or look like they're daydreaming. They may be unable to speak. They may also behave in an irrational way.\n\nWhat causes status epilepticus?\n\nIn children, the main cause of status epilepticus is an infection with a fever. Children with severe, refractory seizure disorders can also have status epilepticus. In adults, the common causes are:\n\nStroke\n\nAutoimmune disorders\n\nImbalance of substances in the blood, such as low blood sugar\n\nDrinking too much alcohol or having alcohol withdrawal after previous heavy alcohol use\n\nWithdrawal from medicines to treat seizures\n\nWho is at risk for status epilepticus?\n\nThere are many risk factors for status epilepticus including:\n\nPoorly controlled epilepsy\n\nLow blood sugar\n\nStroke\n\nKidney failure\n\nLiver failure\n\nEncephalitis (swelling or inflammation of the brain)\n\nHIV\n\nAlcohol or drug abuse\n\nGenetic diseases such as Fragile X syndrome and Angelman syndrome\n\nHead injuries\n\nWhat are the symptoms of status epilepticus?\n\nThese are possible symptoms of status epilepticus:\n\nMuscle spasms\n\nFalling\n\nConfusion\n\nUnusual noises\n\nLoss of bowel or bladder control\n\nClenched teeth\n\nIrregular breathing\n\nUnusual behavior\n\nDifficulty speaking\n\nA \"daydreaming\" look\n\nHow is status epilepticus diagnosed?\n\nYour healthcare provider will do a thorough physical exam and ask about your health history, any medicines you are taking, and if you’ve been using alcohol or other recreational drugs.\n\nYour healthcare provider may also order an electroencephalogram. This involves placing painless electrodes onto your scalp to measure the brain's electrical activity.\n\nYou may need other tests to search for possible causes, such as:\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap) to look for signs of infection\n\nCT or MRI scan to see problems in the brain\n\nHow is status epilepticus treated?\n\nThe healthcare provider will want to end the seizure as quickly as possible and treat any underlying problems that are causing it. You may need:\n\nOxygen\n\nBlood tests\n\nAn IV (intravenous) line\n\nGlucose (sugar) if low blood sugar may be causing the seizure\n\nYou may need a breathing machine until you can breathe on your own\n\nHealthcare providers may also use antiseizure medicines to treat the problem, such as:\n\nDiazepam\n\nLorazepam\n\nLevetiracetam\n\nLacosamide\n\nPhenytoin\n\nFosphenytoin\n\nPhenobarbital\n\nValproate\n\nThese medicines are given through an IV or an injection into a muscle.\n\nWhat are possible complications of status epilepticus?\n\nComplications depend on the underlying cause. They can range from no problems to death. If the cause, such as poor epilepsy control, can be fixed, there may be no problems. If the cause is a stroke or brain injury, a person may suffer physical disability to even death.\n\nCan status epilepticus be prevented?\n\nIf you have epilepsy, taking your medicines as directed may help you prevent this problem. If you’ve had status epilepticus, you may need to begin taking seizure medicines or change the seizure medicines you’re already taking. Keep a seizure log. Contact your provider if your seizures change in how often they happen, how long they last, or the type you’re having.\n\nYou may also be able to prevent this health problem by:\n\nNot abusing alcohol\n\nControlling your blood sugar\n\nStopping medicines only with medical support\n\nKey points about status epilepticus\n\nStatus epilepticus has many causes. Some can be prevented, such as low blood sugar or alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nPeople who have epilepsy must take their medicine as told.\n\nA seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes, or having more than one within a 5-minute period is an emergency. Call 911.\n\nNext steps\n\nTips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:\n\nKnow the reason for your visit and what you want to happen.\n\nBefore your visit, write down questions you want answered.\n\nBring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.\n\nAt the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you.\n\nKnow why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are.\n\nAsk if your condition can be treated in other ways.\n\nKnow why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.\n\nKnow what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.\n\nIf you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.\n\nKnow how you can contact your healthcare provider if you have questions, especially after office hours or on weekends."
