        "text": "Bring:\n\nAdmission Ticket\n\nPrint a copy of your admission ticket to bring to the test center. Your ticket contains important registration match information or your online launch code.\n\nOnce you have uploaded your photo, you can print your admission ticket in MyACT.\n\nAcceptable Photo identification\n\nAcceptable photo identification is required to be admitted to the test center. You will not be admitted to test if your ID does not meet ACT requirements.\n\nNumber 2 pencil\n\nBring sharpened, No. 2 pencils with good erasers (no mechanical pencils or ink pens). Do not bring any other writing instruments; you will not be allowed to use them.\n\nWatch or Other Timing Device\n\nYou may bring a watch, timer, or stopwatch to pace yourself during testing, but it may not have an alarm. Your watch or other timing device must be removed and placed on your desk while in the test room, so that it remains visible to staff during the test. If an alarm sounds, you’ll be dismissed and your test will not be scored.\n\nCalculator\n\nBring a permitted calculator to be used on the mathematics test only. You are not required to use a calculator at all, but if you do, it\n\nis your responsibility to know whether your calculator is permitted.\n\nSnacks\n\nYou may bring a snack to eat outside the testing room during break.\n\nACT Test Security\n\nYou’ve worked hard to prepare for the ACT, and that’s a big deal. We’re also working hard to ensure everyone has a fair and equal opportunity to demonstrate their academic achievement.\n\nProhibited Behavior at the Test Center\n\nTo ensure fairness for all examinees, avoid disturbances in the testing room, and protect the security of the test materials, certain behaviors are prohibited at the test center. You will be dismissed and your answer document will not be scored if you are found engaging in any of these behaviors. For more information view the Prohibited Behavior at the Test Center section of the Terms and Conditions (PDF).\n\nReport Cheating\n\nCheating hurts everyone– if you see it, report it through the Test Security Hotline.\n\nStudents who don't do their own work put honest students at a disadvantage. Whether it's using a cheat sheet, copying someone else's work, or sending another person to take the test, we all feel cheated when someone tries to game the system.\n\nEveryone deserves the chance to show what they have learned. ACT has designed its testing procedures to give everyone an equal opportunity to demonstrate your own academic achievement on a fair and equal playing field.\n\nIf you suspect that someone is trying to take unfair advantages or encounter anything else out of the ordinary, please report it to ACT. You can make an anonymous report about test security concerns by using the Test Security Hotline.\n\nKeep the ACT fair. Report cheating and comply with all testing rules.\n\nSecurity Measures\n\nWe regularly review preventive measures to ensure every reasonable effort is made to deter and detect potential compromises to test security, while still enabling the greatest possible access for students. Our security measures include:\n\nStudents upload or otherwise submit (via ACT website, mobile device, or mail) a recognizable head-and-shoulders photo of themselves when registering for the ACT\n\nIn addition to submitting a photo, students must provide ACT with their gender and identify the name of the high school they attend. ACT will use this information to help match the examinee’s identity throughout the testing process.\n\nThe student's photo is printed on the examinee roster that testing staff use to check in students on test day.\n\nThe photo prints on the student's ticket. In addition to their ticket, students bring and present an acceptable photo ID on test day.\n\nOn test day, test center staff match the name and photo on the student’s ticket, the test center roster, and the student’s photo ID to the student who arrives to take the test before granting the student admission.\n\nBoth before and after testing, students provide written affirmation that they are the person whose name appears on the test booklet and answer sheet which they have submitted. They also acknowledge that assuming anyone else’s identity to take the test may be a violation of law and be subject to legal penalty.\n\nACT may visit test centers to conduct additional test security measures on test day, such as collecting images of examinees during check-in and/or other security activities.\n\nAfter tests have been scored, the student’s photo will be printed on the score report that is automatically sent to the high school attended by the student. Score integrity can then be reinforced by the people who know the students best—the teachers and counselors at their schools.\n\nTo deter attempts to circumvent these procedures, students (including those who hope to test on a standby basis) will be required to register their intent to test and will not be allowed to make any test center or test date changes on the day of the test.\n\nWhy We Do This\n\nOur test security procedures are designed to ensure that examinees have an equal opportunity to demonstrate their academic achievement and skills, that examinees who do their own work are not unfairly disadvantaged by examinees who do not, and that scores reported for each examinee are valid.\n\nRelated Information\n\nCan Scores be Cancelled?\n\nTerms and Conditions - Compromises/Disruptions in the Testing Process (PDF)"
