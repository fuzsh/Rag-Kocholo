Hence the recommendation to take a skippered boat trip to appreciate the city. There are connecting locks into the Rhine to the north-east and the south-east. The separated (northern branch) of the Canal du Rhône au Rhin begins south-west of Strasbourg and heads 31km south, parallel with the river, to Boofzheim and then into the Rhine/Grand Canal d’Alsace. See also under River Ill. A proper port de plaisance for Strasbourg has been promoted for more than 20 years, in the Port de l’Hôpital, but the lack of funding has constantly blocked it."
