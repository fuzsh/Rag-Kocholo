I know my system's shorter than most of what I see...maybe there's some torque waiting to be gained by adding length to it\n\nLast edited by Richard Avatar; 04-09-2014 at 12:10 AM.\n\nOn the KLX specifically? And what kind of racing? Header/exhaust tuning is an amazing technology, but optimum performance gains often don't fit with the shape, length, etc. of the exhaust and how the whole package fits the bike or vehicle...especially a street vehicle. And then there's the issue of how a given use...drag racing vs. off road riding as an example...is benefited from the exhaust being designed and shaped to work to compliment that specific use. I'm sure you're already aware of that, but many think a one-size-fits-all exhaust can cover all the bases. And of course I'm talking about performance at the extreme edge, and that may apply since the reference you're looking for seems to be connected to racing. It would be interesting to see the article. Maybe someone will remember where it is."
