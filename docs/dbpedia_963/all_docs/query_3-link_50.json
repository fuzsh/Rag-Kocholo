        "text": "How do I prepare for a breast biopsy?\n\nIf you’re undergoing a breast biopsy, it’s important to let your healthcare provider, surgeon and/or radiologist know:\n\nIf you’re pregnant or there’s a chance you’re pregnant.\n\nIf you take blood-thinning medication. Your provider may adjust your medication before the biopsy to prevent excess bleeding or bruising.\n\nIf you take aspirin or herbal supplements.\n\nIf you have any health conditions or have recently had surgery.\n\nIf you have any allergies, especially to anesthesia.\n\nQuestions that may be helpful to ask your healthcare provider before your breast biopsy include:\n\nWhat kind of breast biopsy am I having?\n\nWill I have local anesthesia or general anesthesia?\n\nHow long will the procedure take?\n\nHow much breast tissue will you remove?\n\nWhat will recovery from the biopsy be like?\n\nWill I have a scar from the procedure?\n\nWhen can I expect the results?\n\nIf you’re getting general anesthesia for your breast biopsy, your healthcare provider may have you fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your biopsy. You’ll want to have someone drive you home after your biopsy if you’re getting general anesthesia or a sedative because you may be groggy after the procedure.\n\nIn any situation, your provider will give you specific instructions before your breast biopsy appointment. Be sure to follow them.\n\nHow does a breast biopsy procedure work?\n\nMost — but not all — breast biopsy procedures involve seven general steps, including:\n\nUsing imaging or material guidance.\n\nMaking the incision.\n\nBreast tissue removal.\n\nPlacing biopsy markers.\n\nClosing the incision.\n\nExamining the tissue sample.\n\nHere’s an explanation of how different types of breast biopsy procedures work.\n\nAnesthesia\n\nIf you’re undergoing a fine needle aspiration biopsy or a core needle biopsy, your healthcare provider will most likely recommend using a local anesthetic. This means that your provider will inject an anesthetic around the area of your biopsy site to numb the area so that you won’t feel pain during the procedure. You’ll also be awake during the procedure.\n\nIf you’re undergoing a surgical biopsy (excisional breast biopsy), your healthcare provider may recommend general anesthesia (you’ll be asleep, or unconscious, during the surgery) and/or local anesthesia (injection of an anesthetic near the site of your biopsy) so you won’t feel pain. They may also have you take a type of medicine called a sedative to help you relax.\n\nImaging or material guidance\n\nMost breast biopsies involve the use of an imaging machine or material guidance method to help guide your healthcare provider to the area in your breast that they need to biopsy. If you have a lump in your breast that your provider can feel with a physical exam, they may perform a fine needle aspiration biopsy or a core needle biopsy without using an imaging machine.\n\nDuring any of these imaging or guidance procedures, it’s important to be as still as possible so that your provider can accurately pinpoint the correct area of your breast.\n\nHere’s an explanation of the different kinds of imaging or material guidance for breast biopsies.\n\nMammogram-guided biopsy (stereotactic biopsy): During this breast biopsy, your healthcare provider uses mammogram images, which are special X-ray images, to help find the area of your breast that they need to biopsy. Here’s what’ll happen during a mammogram-guided biopsy:\n\nYou’ll likely lie stomach-down on an exam table with your breast that your provider is going to biopsy positioned through a hole in the table.\n\nThe mammogram equipment, which will be underneath the table, will firmly compress your breast between two plates. While this is happening, the machine will take images of your breast to help your provider pinpoint where to perform the biopsy.\n\nUltrasound-guided biopsy: During this breast biopsy, your provider uses ultrasound (an imaging system that uses sound waves to make images of internal body tissues and structures) to guide them to the area of your breast that they need to biopsy. Here’s what will happen during an ultrasound-guided biopsy:\n\nYou’ll lie on an ultrasound table on your back or side.\n\nYour radiologist will apply water-soluble gel to your skin over the area of your breast that they are taking images of.\n\nYour radiologist will then move a handheld device over the gel on your breast to take images inside your breast. These images will help guide your provider when they take a biopsy sample.\n\nMRI-guided biopsy: During this breast biopsy, your provider uses MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which is a machine that takes multiple detailed images without using X-rays, to guide them to the area of your breast that they need to biopsy. Here’s what’ll happen during an MRI-guided biopsy:\n\nSome MRI exams use an injection of contrast material, which “lights up” certain areas of your breast on the MRI images, so you may undergo an injection before the MRI.\n\nYou’ll lie stomach-down on a padded MRI table. A provider will position your breasts in a hollow area on the table. Most MRI units look like large cylinder-shaped tubes. They’re surrounded by a circular magnet, which creates images of the inside of your body with the help of a computer. The table that you’re lying on slides into the center of the magnet.\n\nOnce your provider has located the suspicious area of your breast using the MRI image, they’ll perform the biopsy.\n\nWire localization (needle localization): Surgeons use wire localization for breast biopsy surgeries to help guide them to the area in your breast that they need to biopsy. Here’s what’ll happen during a wire localization procedure:\n\nYour provider will likely use a local anesthetic injection to numb your breast.\n\nWith the help of an imaging machine, such as an MRI or ultrasound, they will insert a thin, hollow needle into the suspicious area of your breast.\n\nOnce the tip of the needle is in the correct spot, your provider will insert a thin, sterile wire through the center of the needle. The wire has a small hook at the end of it to keep it in place. Your provider will then take out the needle, and the wire will stay in your breast with the other end of the wire remaining outside of your breast.\n\nYou’ll then go to the operating room for your breast biopsy. The wire in your breast helps guide your surgeon to the suspicious area in your breast that they’ll biopsy. They’ll remove the wire during the surgery once they’ve removed the tissue.\n\nOther localizing devices: Newer methods of breast biopsy localizing devices include:\n\nTiny radioactive pellets that give off a very small amount of radiation.\n\nTiny magnetic pellets that create small magnetic fields.\n\nTiny radiofrequency reflectors that give off a signal that your provider can see using a special device they hold over your breast.\n\nYour provider can insert any of these devices into the suspicious area of your breast the day before your breast biopsy surgery. Unlike wire localization, these devices are fully inserted into your breast and don’t stick outside of your breast. Your surgeon can then find the suspicious area in your breast by using a handheld detector during the surgery.\n\nThe incision\n\nOnce your healthcare provider has located the area of your breast that they will biopsy, they may need to make an incision (cut) on your skin to perform the biopsy.\n\nIf you’re undergoing a core needle biopsy or a vacuum-assisted core biopsy, your provider will make a small incision (cut) on your skin that’s about one-quarter of an inch in length. They will then insert the biopsy needle and/or vacuum-powered device.\n\nIf you’re undergoing a surgical biopsy, your surgeon will make a small incision into your breast that may be 1 to 2 inches and remove part or all of the suspicious lump, depending on if it’s an incisional (partial) or excisional (total) biopsy.\n\nFine-needle aspiration biopsies do not need an incision. Your provider will simply inject the needle into your skin to do the biopsy.\n\nBreast tissue removal\n\nNext, your healthcare provider will remove a sample of or the entire suspicious tissue using one of the following methods:\n\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA): Your provider uses a very thin needle with a syringe to draw out cells or fluid from the suspicious tissue.\n\nHollow needle (core needle): Your provider uses a larger hollow needle to remove one sample of the suspicious tissue.\n\nVacuum-powered device: Your provider uses a small, vacuum-powered device to suction multiple samples from the suspicious tissue.\n\nIncisional biopsy surgery: Your surgeon removes part of the suspicious tissue using surgery.\n\nExcisional biopsy surgery: Your surgeon removes all of the suspicious tissue — usually a lump or tumor — using surgery. They may also remove surrounding tissue for testing.\n\nPlacing biopsy markers\n\nDuring your breast biopsy procedure, your healthcare provider may place a very small metal marker or clip where they took the biopsy sample. Your provider may do this so that if your biopsy shows cancer cells or precancerous cells, they can locate the biopsy area to remove more breast tissue surgically.\n\nEven if you don’t need further treatment or surgery after your biopsy, the marker allows a radiologist to see where you had your biopsy on future mammograms.\n\nClosing the incision\n\nIf you had a fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy, your provider will likely use a sterile bandage to cover your biopsy site.\n\nIf you had a surgical biopsy, your surgeon will close your incision with stitches or adhesive strips. Your surgeon will give you instructions on how to care for your incision and if they will need to remove the stitches.\n\nExamining the tissue sample\n\nAfter your breast biopsy procedure, your healthcare provider will send your biopsy sample to a lab for examination and testing. A special scientist called a pathologist will process the sample and look at it under a microscope. They’ll determine a diagnosis, if applicable, and send the report to your provider.\n\nWhat should I expect during a breast biopsy?\n\nThere are many types of breast biopsy procedures, and each one is slightly different. Your healthcare provider will walk you through the steps of the procedure and answer any questions you have.\n\nIn general, here are some things you can expect during your breast biopsy:\n\nYou’ll likely experience very little discomfort or pain since you’ll have local or general anesthesia. If you have dense breast tissue or abnormalities behind your nipple, you may experience more discomfort during the procedure.\n\nIf you’re getting a local anesthetic, general anesthetic and/or a sedative, you’ll experience a slight poke from the needle injection or the IV insertion.\n\nYou’ll likely feel some pressure when your provider inserts the biopsy needle and during the tissue removal. This is normal.\n\nIt’s important to be very still while your provider is performing the imaging and the biopsy.\n\nThe total time of the procedure depends on the type of biopsy you’re having and your unique situation. In most cases, the biopsy could take 20 minutes to an hour.\n\nHow long does it take to recover from a breast biopsy?\n\nIf you’ve had a needle biopsy with local anesthesia, you may feel some discomfort in the biopsy area, but you’ll be able to return to your normal activities the next day.\n\nIf you’ve had a surgical biopsy, your recovery may take longer. Depending on how large your incision is and how much breast tissue your surgeon removed, it could take a couple of days to a week until you can return to your normal activities.\n\nYou’ll likely experience some pain in the biopsy area for a few days. Your surgeon will give you specific instructions for your recovery. Be sure to follow them closely.\n\nWhat are the risks and possible complications of a breast biopsy?\n\nMost breast biopsies are minimally invasive, and most people recover well from them. There are some common side effects of a breast biopsy procedure, including:\n\nBruising.\n\nBleeding.\n\nSwelling.\n\nPain or soreness.\n\nInfection.\n\nIf you’re experiencing signs of an infection, such as redness, pus and/or a fever, contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nVery rare complications of breast biopsy procedures include:"
