How do I get my BARBRI refundable book deposit? How / where do I return my BARBRI books?\n\nReturning your BARBRI hard copy materials is optional; however, you must return them to receive any material deposit refund that you paid at the time of enrollment (if applicable).\n\nYour box of hard copy materials will include a checklist and material return order form that you will use to determine which materials need to be returned.\n\nMaterials can be returned in any condition, along with the completed Material Return Form, all in one package. The package must be postmarked no later than 30 days after your jurisdiction’s bar exam results are released.\n\nCan I do my BARBRI Bar Review course entirely online?\n\nYes! You can complete 100% of your BARBRI Bar Review course, studying for any U.S. state or jurisdiction, online anywhere in the world as long as you have a strong, stable internet connection.\n\nWhen does the BARBRI Bar Review course start? How long is the course? How much time should I plan to study during the course?\n\nYour BARBRI Bar Review Personal Study Plan (PSP) will be available in mid-April for the summer bar review course and in mid-November for the winter course. You will receive an email communication when your PSP has been activated.\n\nOnce you have access, you will be able to see all assignments available to you for the entire course.\n\nThe course lasts 8-10 weeks, and the average student should expect to spend about 40 hours per week studying. Each week, you may study the specific days, hours per day, and time of day that work best for your schedule.\n\nWhat if I need to change my bar exam state or jurisdiction?\n\nYou may change your state up to early June for the summer BARBRI Bar Review course or up to early January for the winter course.\n\nIf you are uncertain which state bar exam you will be taking and think you may need to transfer to another state, you should wait to request course materials (if available) until you have made the final decision on the state for which you are studying.\n\nFor help, please email service@BARBRI.com or call 888-322-7274.\n\nWhat if I need to defer my bar review course to a later date?\n\nIt is possible to defer your course to a later date. For help, please email service@BARBRI.com or call 888-322-7274.\n\nCan I start studying early / before my bar review course starts?\n\nAbsolutely! We highly recommend it.\n\nBeginning around September for the following winter and summer BARBRI Bar Review course, you can start working with BARBRI Early Start. Early Start allows you to build key bar exam skills and knowledge early through Immersion workshops such as MBE Immersion and Essay Immersion. Early Start is entirely self-directed and designed to fit into your schedule.\n\nInvesting just 24 total study hours with Early Start before you start your BARBRI Bar Review course statistically increases your chances of passing the bar exam the first time. Just Sign In to your account to get started.\n\nAlso, as early as September for the February exam or February for the July exam, we encourage you to complete the Bar Review Baseline - the fastest way to personalize your BARBRI course. Here's how:\n\nSign In and take the 2-hour Baseline assessment.\n\nAnswer all 70 questions in one session or a few at a time (we recommend one session, if possible).\n\nBefore bar review begins, you will receive a personalized report to help you immediately understand your strengths and opportunity areas.\n\nISAAC, the engine that drives your BARBRI course, uses your results to immediately customize your BARBRI Personal Study Plan (PSP).\n\nIs the BARBRI course schedule flexible?\n\nYou have your own learning style and schedule. Your bar prep should reflect that. BARBRI Bar Review is very flexible in terms of allowing you to study when and where you learn best.\n\nYou can modify your course schedule at any time, adjust your start date, select the days you’d like to study and specific days you need to take off. Whether you are an early bird or a night owl, BARBRI is ready to go when you are.\n\nWhat makes BARBRI even more flexible and personalized is ISAAC. ISAAC is the engine that creates your Personal Study Plan (PSP). It’s the difference between a \"one size fits all” course and a \"personalized specifically for you\" experience.\n\nEverything ISAAC assigns is statistically correlated to passing your bar exam. And it automatically recalibrates as it learns from you, your schedule customizations and time remaining until your exam. Whether you’re on track, working ahead or falling a bit behind, ISAAC makes sure you will get you the most points possible. Learn more about ISAAC.\n\nWe want to be straight with you though. While your study time, days and location are extremely flexible, studying for the bar exam requires time and commitment. It’s tough. It should be treated like a full-time job. You should plan on spending approximately 40 hours per week over 8-10 weeks studying.\n\nNobody – no bar exam course – can make studying for the bar exam easy. But we can make it easier. And we’re here for you every step of The BARBRI Way.\n\nHow do I see or pay my account balance?\n\nIf you have a BARBRI Bar Review account, you can sign in to your account and review the Orders Page to see your current balance and payment options. Once signed in, you can also review your Payments Page to view your payment history.\n\nWhen is my full BARBRI tuition balance due?\n\nSummer BARBRI Bar Review course balances must be completely paid, or on a payment plan or financing, by April 15 for you to be able to access the course and avoid incurring late balance charges. Winter bar review course balances must be completely paid, or on a payment plan or financing, by November 15.\n\nHow can I pay my balance? What kind of payment plan options are available?\n\nCREDIT CARDS OR CHECKS: BARBRI accepts American Express, MasterCard, Discover and VISA. Debit/check cards may be declined unless the transaction is pre-authorized by your financial institution.\n\nPersonal checks, bank checks and money orders are also accepted. If paying by check, please write your BARBRI ID number in the memo line and mail to: BARBRI, 12222 Merit Drive Suite 1340, Dallas, TX 75251.\n\nINSTALLMENT PLAN: You can create an interest-free, custom installment payment plan when you pay with a debit or credit card. Pay your initial required BARBRI down payment (depending on the course you’re selecting) and then split up the remainder of your tuition payments over time.\n\nA custom installment payment plan is not a loan – no credit check is required and no interest is applied.\n\nIf you create a custom installment plan for a summer bar review course, your total tuition must be paid in full by June 15. If you create a custom installment plan for a winter bar review course, your total tuition must be paid in full by January 15.\n\nFor help, please email service@BARBRI.com or call 888-322-7274.\n\nAFFIRM FINANCING: Many BARBRI Bar Review options allow you to finance with Affirm during enrollment to create easy, fixed monthly payments over 3, 6 or 12 months at 0% or 10 - 36% APR.\n\nThe interest rate (0% or 10-36% APR) and term options (3, 6 or 12 months) you are offered is based on the tuition type you are choosing and on a credit check. You can check your eligibility during enrollment and it will not impact your credit score – provide some basic information and get a real-time decision to split your purchase into 3, 6, or 12 monthly payments at 0% or 10 - 36% APR. For example, on a $700 purchase, you may pay $63.18 for 12 months with a 15% APR.\n\nIf you Finance with Affirm during enrollment, you can include any initially required BARBRI down payments in your loan. Or, you can make the minimum required payment toward your BARBRI tuition at the time of enrollment via your preferred payment method.\n\nOnce you Finance with Affirm, you will begin making payments immediately to Affirm, but the entire balance of your tuition does not need to be paid prior to your course starting or ending.\n\nRates from 0% APR or 10-36% APR. Payment options through Affirm are subject to an eligibility check, may not be available in all states, and are provided by these lending partners: affirm.com/lenders. Options depend on your purchase amount, and a down payment may be required. CA residents: Loans by Affirm Loan Services, LLC are made or arranged pursuant to a California Finance Lenders Law license.\n\nWhen you finance, a down payment may be required and Affirm loans are made by Cross River Bank, a New Jersey state-chartered bank, Member FDIC. Learn more about Financing with Affirm.\n\nHow can I bill my employer for my BARBRI course?\n\nBARBRI has a direct billing relationship with over 1,000 law firms. Once your law firm has communicated to you that they will pay directly for your bar review course, learn more about billing your firm for BARBRI Bar Review.\n\nOnce you have requested that BARBRI directly bill a law firm for your bar review course, the selected firm will receive an invoice for your balance due (tuition and tax). Some firms will pay for the shipping fee and refundable book deposit. If your firm does not, you will be billed separately for those fees.\n\nIf you already have a BARBRI Bar Review account, you can request direct billing. For help, please email service@BARBRI.com or call 888-322-7274. Firm invoices are sent monthly.\n\nYour firm must establish an account with BARBRI and pay your tuition before the course begins or you will be responsible for payment in full.\n\nDo you have any bar review scholarships available?\n\nYear after year, BARBRI supports thousands of students who seek to change the world. Last year alone, BARBRI awarded over $4.5M in scholarships to public interest students and other world-changers.\n\nTo apply for a BARBRI Public Interest scholarship while they are available, submit your application. If selected, you will receive a discount on your BARBRI Bar Review course tuition.\n\nView the Public Interest scholarship application, deadlines, and requirements here.\n\nDo you ship books internationally?\n\nYes, you can request international shipment of your BARBRI books. When you confirm your shipping address, you will be able to designate an international address and provide payment for the shipping costs.\n\nWhen / how can I order my BARBRI books? Why am I unable to order my BARBRI materials?\n\nDepending on the specific BARBRI Bar Review option you select when enrolling, hard copy materials are typically available for shipping request in March for the following summer BARBRI Bar Review course and September for the following winter bar review course. You will be notified via email when books are available for order.\n\nOnce books are available to be ordered for your bar review course, you must have:\n\npaid at least $1,000 toward your BARBRI Bar Review course tuition and have a valid payment plan OR\n\nhave financed your tuition with Affirm, OR\n\ndesignated the law firm that is paying your tuition.\n\nFor help, please email service@BARBRI.com or call 888-322-7274.\n\nBARBRI course materials will be sent via UPS Ground. You may request expedited shipment for an additional fee. Upon shipment, you will receive an email with tracking information.\n\nPlease note that materials will not be available for pick up at your course location, and ground shipping may take 5-7 business days.\n\nPlease contact BARBRI Customer Support at 888-322-7274 (U.S.), or email service@barbri.com, if you have questions or need help with ordering or shipping materials.\n\nWhat specific hard copy materials do I get? How do I use the different books?\n\nThe specific materials you will receive will vary state-by-state and by the BARBRI Bar Review option you select while enrolling. When you receive your materials, carefully compare the contents to the checklist.\n\nHow long are BARBRI lectures? Can I watch or refer to them in segments?\n\nWe know some students like to watch shorter segments and take regular breaks. Others get “in the zone” and prefer to stay focused. That’s why we broke down each BARBRI lecture into segmented components. Lecture length will vary with some segments as short as a few minutes, or you can watch a lecture in its entirety, typically three to four hours. You can work one or a few sections and take a break, or you can continue through to the end. Either way, you’ll stay focused throughout each segment by actively participating in quizzes and other learning activities.\n\nIs state specific content covered in my BARBRI course?\n\nYes, BARBRI Bar Review is designed to prepare students to pass the bar in all U.S. states and jurisdictions. If state-specific content is tested on your bar exam, it is covered in your course.\n\nHow many graded essays are included with BARBRI Bar Review? Can I have unlimited essays graded at no additional charge?\n\nThe number of essays included in your BARBRI Bar Review course is dependent upon the option you select when you enroll. Many options included an unlimited number of graded essays; however, it’s important to remember that it’s not the number of essays you submit for grading that matters most.\n\nDuring bar study, your goal is to learn to write the best bar exam essays possible, as quickly as possible. And writing essays for the bar exam is very different from writing essays for law school.\n\nAs we’ve worked with students, we’ve seen that submitting practice essay after essay with no initial guidance and delayed feedback reinforces bad habits and wastes time. For this reason, a purely “unlimited” essay grading system can actually stunt your progress.\n\nWe don’t want that for our students. So BARBRI has a better answer with proven results: Directed Essay Grading.\n\nIt starts with Essay Architect, our exclusive online instruction platform that takes you through a series of steps to learn to critically read bar exam questions, enhance the speed of your essay writing and construct strong, winning answers. Essay Architect provides immediate feedback to build your essay writing skills quickly.\n\nThen, we assign a carefully selected series of past bar exam essays and performance tests for grading and feedback from trained bar exam writing experts. You’ll also receive many more essays for practice and self-grading.\n\nThese steps move you methodologically along an upward trajectory of continuous bar exam writing improvement.\n\nHow many MBE practice questions do you provide? Are they released MBE questions?\n\nYou will have access to over 5,500 MBE questions throughout your BARBRI Bar Review course. However, we don’t believe that this is quite the right question – or at least not the entire question – to be asking.\n\nAs with many things, it’s not just the quantity, it’s the quality and the methodology that matters.\n\nWhen it comes to real released MBE questions, BARBRI offers NCBE released questions with select BARBRI Bar Review options – and we assign select questions that have been vetted to ensure they represent areas most likely to be tested. As a general rule, we don’t recommend focusing too much on released MBE questions.\n\nQuestions that have been released by the examiners will not appear in any future MBE because the scoring data for those questions would not be reliable. And, because only about 80 questions per subject have been released in the past 10 years, released questions don’t provide a good representation of the topics that are most likely to appear on the exam. Focusing primarily on real released MBE questions is another way some bar preppers misuse precious, limited study time.\n\nThe vast majority of BARBRI’s questions have been developed by BARBRI subject matter experts to test on the most important, most frequently tested topic areas – the same way the bar examiners do. These questions have been drafted after careful review of actual MBE questions and have been approved by professors who are experts in those subjects.\n\nWhat devices or browsers can I use to access my BARBRI course?\n\nWe recommend that you complete the course on a computer or a laptop. Google Chrome is our suggested internet browser. If you are using a Mac, please download Google Chrome or Safari for the best experience. If you are using a PC, please download Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox for the best experience.\n\nClick here for other technical requirements and troubleshooting tips.\n\nYou may also download the BARBRI Study Plan App to watch lectures (streaming or swipe to download) and work practice questions on iOS and Android.\n\nWhat happens if I do not pass the bar exam?\n\nWith the BARBRI Guarantee, if you take a BARBRI Bar Review course for the first time for a particular state and you do not pass or sit for that state's bar exam, you may retake the same course online once for the same state the next time the course is offered without paying additional tuition.\n\nPlease see the specific BARBRI option that you select during enrollment for details or completion requirements.\n\nTo enroll, choose your state, exam date via this form to submit your request for a Guarantee Enrollment.\n\nIf the BARBRI option you originally selected during enrollment includes hard copy materials, the following options are available for Guarantee students of those courses:\n\nIf a new edition of hard copy materials has been released, you must pay a $250 refundable book deposit, plus shipping and handling fees, to enroll in the Guarantee course. You will be shipped a new set of books.\n\nIf the edition of hard copy materials is the same as those used in your original course but you wish to receive another set of books, you must pay another $250 refundable book deposit, plus shipping fees, before books can be shipped to you.\n\nIf you choose to keep your books from your original course, please be aware that you are forfeiting the refundable materials deposit that you paid with your original course.\n\nHow much is BARBRI Bar Review? How do I enroll in BARBRI?\n\nClick here for information about current pricing and promotions.\n\nYou may also contact the BARBRI Director of Legal Education assigned to your U.S. law school to determine if your law school has pre-purchased any BARBRI Bar Review options of which you may be able to take advantage.\n\nHow long after the bar exam will I have access to course content?\n\nAccess to the course content will conclude the Monday after the bar exam is administered.\n\nCan I cancel my enrollment?\n\nThere are no BARBRI Bar Review course cancellation fees if the cancellation request is received before you have been provided physical or online bar review content or materials.\n\nIf you deliver a written request to cancel your enrollment before 12:00 a.m. (CDT) on the fifth business day following your enrollment date, you will receive a full refund of all payments made less any promotional gift cards received. After five days from enrollment, you may deliver a written request to cancel your enrollment and receive a refund of all monies paid less your non-refundable registration fee and any promotional gift cards received, if applicable.\n\nYou may not cancel your enrollment once physical or online course materials or access has been provided.\n\nPlease deliver a written request for cancellation to service@barbri.com.\n\nFind the BARBRI bar prep course that’s built for you\n\nTraditional Bar Review\n\nFull-time course | 8-10 week\n\nStudy for any U.S. state exam, including the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE)\n\nBest for:\n\nCandidates with a J.D. from a U.S. law school looking for the quickest, most efficient & effective course to pass any U.S. state bar exam\n\nExtended Bar Prep\n\nPart-time course | 6- or 10-month\n\nStudy for a UBE state, including New York or California\n\nBest for:\n\nBest for candidates without a J.D. from a U.S. law school looking for the most comprehensive bar prep or students who want more study time & flexibility"
