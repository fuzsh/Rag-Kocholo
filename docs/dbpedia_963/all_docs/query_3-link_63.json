        "text": "An undergraduate personal statement is a chance to get noticed for the unique talents and experiences you have. It’s an important part of the application process as it’s an opportunity to talk about yourself and your passions, outside of your grades.\n\nIn this article, we’re going to talk you through how to write an undergraduate personal statement that stands out, without leaving you feeling overwhelmed.\n\nYou’ll have heard the saying preparation is key, and that’s no different when you’re tackling your personal statement. There are two things to think about when you’re planning. The practical and factual information you need to get across, and the more emotional, human parts of you that make you different to everyone else.\n\nBefore you start writing, take some time to think about the key things you’d want an admissions tutor to know about you, and get them down on paper. Don’t worry too much about making your notes perfect – this is more about making sure you know why you should be offered a place.\n\nYou can also look at the course description as this’ll help you with what to include and give you a good idea of what each uni is looking for.\n\nAdmissions Tutors will be reading a lot of personal statements so it’s important to grab their attention right from the start.\n\nRemember, it can only be 4,000 characters, which is about two sides of A4. So, you’ll need to use your words wisely to fit everything in.\n\nYou can find a full guide on How to start a personal statement: the attention grabber, but here are the main things to think about.\n\nDon’t overthink the opening. Just start by showing your enthusiasm for the subject, showcasing your knowledge and understanding, and sharing your ambitions of what you want to achieve.\n\nAvoid cliches! Remember, this opening part is simply about introducing yourself, so let the admissions tutor reading your personal statement get to know you.\n\nKeep it relevant and simple. You’re limited on how much you can include so avoid long-winded explanations. Why use 20 words when 10 can make your point?\n\nNext, you’ll need to write about your personal skills and achievements. Universities like to know the abilities you have that’ll help you on the course, or generally with life at university.\n\nDon’t forget to include evidence to back up why you’re so excited about the course(s) you’ve chosen.\n\nBe bold and talk about the achievements you’re proud of.\n\nInclude positions of responsibility you hold, or have held, both in and out of school.\n\nWhat are the things that make you interesting, special, or unique?\n\nYour work experience and future plans are important to include. You should share details of jobs, placements, work experience, or voluntary work, particularly if it's relevant to your course.\n\nTry to link any experience to skills or qualities that’ll make you successful.\n\nIf you know what you’d like to do after as a career, explain how you plan to use the knowledge and experience that you’ll gain to launch your career.\n\nIt’s always good to connect the beginning of your statement to the end and a great way to reinforce what you said at the start.\n\nYou want to see the ending as your chance to finish in a way that’ll make the admissions tutor remember you.\n\nThis final part of your personal statement should emphasise the great points you’ve already made and answer the question of why you should be offered a place on the course.\n\nRead our full guide on How to finish your statement the right way.\n\nNow you’ve written your undergraduate personal statement, you’ll need to do a couple of final things before you submit it.\n\nHave you proofread it?\n\nDon’t just rely on spellcheckers. We’d recommend reading it out loud as that’s a great way to spot any errors as well as checking it sounds like you.\n\nHave you asked for feedback?\n\nAsk friends, family or a careers advisor to have a read through your personal statement and take their feedback on board.\n\nWant more advice on your personal statement?
