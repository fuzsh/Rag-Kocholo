        "text": "Meter is the SI unit of length. Length can be expressed in other units like, centimeters, inches, feet, and yards which can be converted to meters. Though meters and inches are units of length, but their values differ. In this article we will learn the relation between meter, centimeter, millimeter, inches, feet and yards. Stay tuned to learn more about how long is a meter!\n\n1. Definition of Meter 2. Conversions of Meters 3. Solved Examples 4. Practice Questions 5. FAQs on How Long is a Meter\n\nMeter is a metric unit of length. The abbreviation of meter is \"m\". The metric unit followed in the United States is called the \"United States Customary Units (USCS)\". Examples: Diameter of a swimming pool, length of objects.\n\nIn order to convert the length given in meters to different units, it is needed to know the relation between the meter and the other units. Hence, while doing the required length conversions, these relations can be used and the lengths can be converted easily from meters to the required units.\n\nMeter to Centimeter\n\nCentimeter is also a unit of distance abbreviated as, \"cm\". Meter can be expressed in terms of Centimeter as, 1 m = 100 cm.\n\nMeter to Millimeter\n\nMillimeter is abbreviated as \"mm\". As, 1 centimeter = 10 millimeters, Meter can be expressed in terms of Millimeter as, 1 m = 1000 mm.\n\nMeter can also be related to other units for measuring lengths like inches, feet, and yards.\n\nMeter to Inches\n\nInches is the USCS unit mainly used to indicate length. It is abbreviated as \"in\". The relation between meters and inches is, 1 m = 39.37 in.\n\nMeter to Feet\n\nFeet is also a USCS unit mainly used to indicate length. It is abbreviated as \"ft\". Foot is the singular unit for feet. The relation between meters and feet is, 1 m = 3.28 ft.\n\nMeter to Yards\n\nYard is the USCS unit abbreviated as \"yd\". The relation between meters and yards is, 1 m = 1.094 yd.\n\nLet us try converting these units to meters.\n\nTopics Related to How Long is a Meter\n\nMetric System\n\nMetric Conversion Chart\n\nAccurate vs Precise\n\nConvert km/h to m/s\n\nLength Conversion\n\nMeasurement\n\nSystem of Measurement\n\nUnit Conversion Formula\n\nKilometer\n\nMeters to Yards Calculator\n\nMeter to Feet Calculator\n\n5th Grade Metric Conversion Worksheets"
