        "text": "Remember every week counts!\n\nNear the end of your pregnancy you may be uncomfortable or anxious to see your baby. But remember -- you want to be sure you deliver a full term baby, if possible.\n\nHow long is full term?\n\nPregnancy lasts for about 280 days or 40 weeks.\n\nA preterm or premature baby is delivered before 37 weeks of your pregnancy.\n\nExtremely preterm infants are born 23 through 28 weeks.\n\nModerately preterm infants are born between 29 and 33 weeks.\n\nLate preterm infants are born between 34 and 37 weeks.\n\nBabies born before 39 weeks have a greater chance of breathing problems, low blood sugar and other problems that may result in being admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\nWhat causes preterm births?\n\nThere are many factors that may lead to a preterm birth. Women who have had a previous preterm baby are at highest risk for another preterm baby. Women carrying twins or triplets or have uterine or cervical tumors are also at high risk.\n\nOther factors that put you at risk for a preterm birth include:\n\nDiabetes;\n\nHigh blood pressure;\n\nBlood clotting disorders;\n\nProblems with the placenta or bleeding;\n\nOverweight or underweight;\n\nShort time between pregnancies;\n\nLate or no prenatal care;\n\nSmoking, drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs; and\n\nStress.\n\nWhat are the risks of a preterm birth?\n\nHaving a baby before your due date puts the baby at higher risk for many health problems.\n\nA baby's brain is the last major organ to develop during your pregnancy. The part of the brain that the baby will use for thinking doubles in size during the last few weeks of your pregnancy. When you are 35 weeks pregnant, your baby's brain only weighs two-thirds of what it will weigh at 40 weeks.\n\nSome of the health problems that preterm babies may have include:\n\nProblems breathing and keeping warm;\n\nFeeding problems because they may have more trouble sucking and swallowing;\n\nNewborn jaundice, which causes their skin and the white part of their eyes to look yellow;\n\nA longer hospital stay after they are born or be in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit;\n\nAre more often readmitted to the hospital with problems; and\n\nA smaller and less developed brain when they are born.\n\nEven if the baby does well when born, he or she may have more long-term health problems such as:\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); and\n\nAs adults, they are more likely to get diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nI want my baby to be healthy as possible. What can I do?\n\nSometimes no matter what you do, you may have a preterm baby, but there are things you can do to help prevent it.\n\nIf you are just thinking about getting pregnant, then get as healthy as you can before you get pregnant.\n\nPreconception Care\n\nIf you smoke, stop. If you need help to stop smoking, ask your health care provider or call the New York State Smoker's Quitline at 1-866-NYQUITS(1-866-697-8487) or www.nysmokefree.com.\n\nIf you feel sad or depressed during or after your pregnancy, you are not alone. Up to one in seven people experience some form of pregnancy-related depression or anxiety. Maternal Depression (omh.ny.gov)\n\nIf you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby, or are hallucinating, this is a medical emergency. Call 911 immediately.\n\nDo not ask to deliver your baby before your due date for any nonmedical reason.\n\nGet early and regular prenatal care. If you need help getting health care, the Prenatal Care Assistance Program (PCAP) can help you. Call the New York State Growing Up Healthy Hotline: 1 (800) 522-5006\n\nIf you think you have any kind of infection or just don't feel well, call your health care provider right away.\n\nDo not drink alcohol or take any drugs that are not prescribed for you. If you need help with an alcohol or drug problem, talk to your health care provider.\n\nPlan your pregnancies and try to space them at least 18 â€“ 24 months apart. Ask your health care provider about planning your family, even if you are pregnant now.
