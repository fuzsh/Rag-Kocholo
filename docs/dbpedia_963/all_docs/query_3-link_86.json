        "text": "About walking\n\nWalking is a great way to improve or maintain your overall health. Just 30 minutes every day can increase cardiovascular fitness, strengthen bones, reduce excess body fat, and boost muscle power and endurance.\n\nIt can also reduce your risk of developing conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis and some cancers.\n\nUnlike some other forms of exercise, walking is free and doesn’t require any special equipment or training.\n\nPhysical activity does not have to be vigorous or done for long periods in order to improve your health.\n\nWalking is low impact, requires minimal equipment, can be done at any time of day and can be performed at your own pace. You can get out and walk without worrying about the risks associated with some more vigorous forms of exercise.\n\nWalking is also a great form of physical activity for people who are overweight, elderly, or who haven’t exercised in a long time.\n\nWalking for fun and fitness isn’t limited to strolling by yourself around local neighbourhood streets. There are various clubs, venues and strategies you can use to make walking an enjoyable and social part of your lifestyle.\n\nHealth benefits of walking\n\nYou carry your own body weight when you walk. This is known as weight-bearing exercise. Some of the benefits include:\n\nincreased cardiovascular and pulmonary (heart and lung) fitness\n\nreduced risk of heart disease and stroke\n\nimproved management of conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), high cholesterol, joint and muscular pain or stiffness, and diabetes\n\nstronger bones and improved balance\n\nincreased muscle strength and endurance\n\nreduced body fat.\n\nWalk for 30 minutes a day\n\nTo get the health benefits, try to walk for at least 30 minutes as briskly as you can on most days of the week. ‘Brisk’ means you can still talk but not sing, and you may be puffing slightly.\n\nModerate activities such as walking pose little health risk but if you have a medical condition, check with your doctor before starting any new exercise program of physical activity.\n\nBuild physical activity into your life\n\nIf it’s too difficult to walk for 30 minutes at one time, do regular small bouts (10 minutes) 3 times per day and gradually build up to longer sessions.\n\nIf your goal is to lose weight, you will need to do physical activity for longer than 30 minutes each day. You can achieve this by starting with smaller bouts of activity throughout the day and increasing these as your fitness improves.\n\nPhysical activity built into a daily lifestyle plan is also one of the most effective ways to assist with weight loss and keep weight off once it’s lost.\n\nSome suggestions to build walking into your daily routine include:\n\nTake the stairs instead of the lift (for at least part of the way).\n\nGet off public transport one stop earlier and walk to work or home.\n\nWalk (don’t drive) to the local shops.\n\nWalk the dog (or your neighbour’s dog).\n\nMake walking part of your routine\n\nTry to make walking a routine – for example, try to walk at the same time each day.\n\nRemember, you use the same amount of energy no matter what time of day you walk, so do what is most convenient for you.\n\nYou may find that asking someone to walk with you will help make it a regular activity. Some people find that keeping an activity diary or log also makes it easier.\n\nWear a pedometer while walking\n\nA pedometer measures the number of steps you take.\n\nYou can measure your movement throughout a day and compare it to other days or recommended amounts. This may motivate you to move more.\n\nThe recommended number of steps accumulated per day to achieve health benefits is 10,000 steps or more.\n\nA comfortable intensity for walking\n\nFor most people, there is little difference in the amount of energy used by walking a kilometre or running a kilometre – it’s just that walking takes longer.\n\nPlan to cover a set distance each day and monitor how long it takes you to walk this distance. As your fitness improves, you will be able to walk a longer distance and use more energy.\n\nWalking fast burns more kilojoules per hour than walking slowly, but this doesn’t mean you have to push yourself until you’re breathless. Instead, pace yourself so that you can still talk. This simple rule of thumb means that you walk safely within your target heart rate, which brings about health gains.\n\nOur bodies tend to get used to physical activity, so continue to increase your intensity as you improve your fitness levels. You can increase the intensity of your walks by:\n\nwalking up hills\n\nwalking with hand weights\n\nincreasing your walking speed gradually by including some quick walking\n\nincreasing the distance you walk quickly before returning to a moderate walking pace\n\nwalking for longer.\n\nWarm up and cool down after walking\n\nThe best way to warm up is to walk slowly. Start each walk at a leisurely pace to give your muscles time to warm up, and then pick up the speed.\n\nAfterwards, gently stretch your leg muscles – particularly your calves and front and back thighs. Stretches should be held for about 20 seconds.\n\nIf you feel any pain, ease off the stretch. Don’t bounce or jolt, or you could overstretch muscle tissue and cause microscopic tears, which lead to muscle stiffness and tenderness.\n\nIt’s best to dress lightly when you do physical activity. too many layers can increase sweating and build up body temperature, making you uncomfortable during a walk or possibly cause skin irritations.\n\nA gradual cool-down will also prevent muscular stiffness and injury.\n\nWalking is a low-cost and effective form of exercise. However, the wrong type of shoe or walking action can cause foot or shin pain, blisters and injuries to soft tissue.\n\nMake sure your shoes are comfortable, with appropriate heel and arch supports. Take light, easy steps and make sure your heel touches down before your toes.\n\nWhenever possible, walk on grass rather than concrete to help absorb the impact.\n\nMake walking a pleasure\n\nSome suggestions to help make regular walking a pleasurable form of physical activity include:\n\nvarying where you walk\n\nwalking the dog\n\nwalking with friends\n\njoining a walking club.\n\nMake walking interesting\n\nWays to keep your daily walk interesting include:\n\nIf you want to stick close to home and limit your walking to neighbourhood streets, pick different routes so you don’t get tired of seeing the same sights.\n\nIf you feel unsafe walking alone, find one or more friends or family members to walk with.\n\nWalk at various times of the day. The sights to see first thing in the morning are bound to differ from those of the afternoon or early evening.\n\nDrive to other reserves, park the car and enjoy the views while walking.\n\nExplore what’s happening around you; notice the sky, the people, the sounds.\n\nDog walking\n\nA dog that needs regular exercise motivates you to walk every day. You might like the companionship too. If you don’t have a dog, and aren’t planning on getting one, consider offering to walk a neighbour’s dog occasionally.\n\nSuggestions for the safety of your dog and other people on foot include:\n\nBe considerate of other pedestrians and always keep your dog on its leash.\n\nIf you plan to walk in a park, check first to see if dogs are permitted. Many national and state parks and other conservation reserves do not permit dogs.\n\nOther parks generally permit dog-walking on a leash. Many parks allow dogs off the leash – check with your local council.\n\nAlways take equipment such as plastic bags and gloves to clean up after your dog.\n\nWalk with others\n\nWalking with other people can turn a bout of exercise into an enjoyable social occasion. Suggestions include:\n\nSchedule a regular family walk – this is a great way to pass on healthy habits to your children or grandchildren, and to spend time together, while getting fit at the same time.\n\nIf you are walking with children, ensure the route and length of time spent walking are appropriate formake sure the route and length of time spent walking are appropriate to their age.\n\nBabies and toddlers enjoy long walks in the pram. Take the opportunity to point outhighlight items of interest to young ones, such as vehicles, flowers and other pedestrians.\n\nLook for the self-guided nature walks that have been set up in many parks. Younger children enjoy looking for the next numbered post; older ones can learn about the plants and animals of the park, and perhaps take photos or record their experience in other ways.\n\nWalking clubs and associations\n\nThere are a number of walking clubs in metropolitan and regional Victoria. Some cater for specific groups (such as women, dog walkers or bushwalkers), while others offer the opportunity to meet new people in your local area. Organisations to contact for further information include:\n\nVictoria Walks – provides walking mapsExternal Link and suggestions for finding walks near youExternal Link , including dog-friendly walksExternal Link\n\nBushwalking VictoriaExternal Link – offers a comprehensive listing of bushwalking clubs\n\nYour local council – may run a range of walking activities for people living in your area\n\nHeart Foundation WalkingExternal Link – offers the opportunity to join or start your own free walking group (for all ages and abilities, across Australia)\n\nParks VictoriaExternal Link – can provide suggestions and ideas for interesting walks in parks and reserves throughout Victoria.\n\nSafety suggestions while walking\n\nWalking is generally a safe way to exercise, but look out for unexpected hazards. Suggestions include:\n\nSee your doctor for a medical check-up before starting a new fitness program, particularly if you are aged over 40 years, are overweight or haven’t exercised in a long time.\n\nEnsure you read through the pre-exercise self-screening toolExternal Link\n\nChoose walks that suit your age and fitness level. Warm up and cool down with a slow, gentle walk to ease in and out of your exercise session.\n\nWear loose, comfortable clothing, and appropriate footwear to avoid blisters and shin splints.\n\nWear sunglasses, sunscreen, long sleeves and a hat to avoid sunburn.\n\nTake waterproof clothing to avoid getting wet if it rains.\n\nBefore bushwalking, check the weather forecast and take appropriate safety measures (for example, pack correct clothing).\n\nLook for hazards in alpine or coastal areas, such as cliff edges or large waves.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids before and after your walk. If you are taking a long walk, take water with you.\n\nWhere to get help"
