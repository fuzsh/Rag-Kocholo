        "text": "What Are Blood Clots?\n\nBlood clots are your body's way of stopping you from bleeding too much. Blood has a seemingly impossible job: it must flow continuously and smoothly throughout your body for an entire lifetime but quickly shut off to avoid spills when you get a cut or injury.\n\nWhat do blood clots do?\n\nA type of blood cell called platelets teams up with plasma, which is the liquid part of your blood, to stop bleeding by creating a clot over any injury you have. Once the injury is healed, your body should break down the blood clot.\n\nBlood clots are healthy and lifesaving when they stop bleeding. But they can also form when they aren't needed and cause a heart attack, stroke, or other serious medical problems.\n\nBlood Clotting Process\n\nThe life cycle of a normal blood clot depends on a series of chemical interactions.\n\n1. Platelets form a plug. Platelets get âturned onâ by triggers released when a blood vessel is damaged. They stick to the walls in the area and each other, changing shape to form a plug that fills in the broken part to stop blood from leaking out.\n\nWhen activated, platelets also release chemicals to attract more platelets and other cells, setting off the next step.\n\n2. The clot grows. Proteins in your blood called clotting factors signal each other to cause a rapid chain reaction. It ends with a dissolved substance in your blood turning into long strands of fibrin. These get tangled up with the platelets in the plug to create a net that traps even more platelets and cells. The clot becomes much tougher and more durable.\n\n3. Reactions stop its growth. Other proteins offset extra clotting factor proteins, so the clot doesn't spread farther than needed.\n\n4. Your body slowly breaks it down. As the damaged tissue heals, you don't need the clot anymore. The tough fibrin strands dissolve, and your blood takes back the platelets and cells of the clot.\n\nBlood Clot Location\n\nBlood clots can form in veins or arteries, the vessels that help move blood around your body. They usually form inside an injured blood vessel to help your body heal. Sometimes, they form without an injury and don't dissolve on their own. You'll need to see a doctor right away, especially for blood clots in the arteries or veins of your legs, lungs, or brain.\n\nArterial clot vs. venous clot\n\nVeins are low-pressure vessels responsible for moving blood away from your organs and directing it back to your heart. When an abnormal clot forms, it can potentially hinder normal blood flow to the heart. This can lead to pain and swelling as blood pools behind the clot.\n\nMeanwhile, arteries are robust, high-pressure vessels that carry oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood from your heart to other parts of your body. When your doctor checks your blood pressure, the results show the pressure in your arteries. A clot in your artery usually means you have a condition called atherosclerosis, which involves the hardening of the artery. It is related to the buildup of plaque that constricts the vessel's inner wall.\n\nBlood clots in period\n\nYou may notice blood clots during your period. Small ones are normal, but if they're larger than a grape, see a doctor. They could mean you have a serious medical problem.\n\nBlood clots in the legs, arms, groin, or behind the knee\n\nA blood clot in the veins of the leg, arm, groin (called the femoral vein), or behind the knee (called the popliteal vein) could be a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT happens when you have a medical problem that impacts how the blood clots. A clot in this area can also form if you sit or lay for too long, like when you're on bed rest or taking a long-distance trip. Around 1 to 3 in every 1,000 adults form a DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE) in the U.S. every year.\n\nBlood clots in lungs\n\nPE, or blood clots in your lungs, is a dangerous condition that happens when clots break free from vessels in other parts of your body and get wedged in the blood vessels of your lungs.\n\nBlood clots in brain\n\nWhen a blood vessel in your brain narrows, it slows blood flow to other parts of your brain. The result is pain, seizures, headaches, and sometimes even death. Hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke are two types of blood clots in the brain. Brain blood clots are rare, affecting around 1 in every 100,000 people.\n\nBlood clots in urine\n\nCalled hematuria, blood in your urine most commonly happens with a bladder infection, prostate infection, or urinary tract stones. These conditions can cause you to pee blood and even form a clot, which can block the flow of urine. If you have a blood clot, this usually means your urinary tract is injured. Other symptoms include pain in your side, back, or lower stomach and trouble peeing.\n\nBlood clots in poop\n\nSometimes blood clots can also form when you have blood in your stool (rectal bleeding). This type of bleeding usually happens with hemorrhoids, anal fissures, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and diverticulitis. If you notice large blood clots in your poop, see a doctor right away.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nWhat Causes Blood Clots?\n\nThe process begins whenever flowing blood comes into contact with specific substances in your skin or in blood vessel walls. When they touch, it usually means the skin or blood vessel wall is broken.\n\nWaxy cholesterol plaques that form in arteries have these things inside, too. If the plaque breaks open, they'll start the clotting process. Most heart attacks and strokes happen when a plaque in your heart or brain suddenly bursts.\n\nBlood clots can also form when your blood doesn't flow properly. If it pools in your blood vessels or heart, platelets are more likely to stick together. Atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are two conditions where slowly moving blood can cause clotting problems. Blood clots can also form:\n\nWhen you sit or lie for long periods\n\nDuring and after pregnancy\n\nWhen you take birth control pills or estrogen hormones\n\nWhen you use an IV catheter for a long time\n\nAfter an injury"
