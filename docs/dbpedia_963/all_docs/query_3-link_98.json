        "text": "Time is your enemy on the ACT, and you have to use it wisely. After all, how often do you take a test in school with a minute or less per question? Don’t panic! Get the ACT timing tips you need to manage your pace throughout each section of the test.\n\nHow long does the ACT take?\n\nThe ACT is 3 hours long (technically 2 hours and 55 minutes). Including breaks, the exam takes 3 hours and 30 minutes to complete. If you sign up for the optional essay (the ACT Plus Writing), the test clocks in at 3 hours and 40 minutes or just over 4 hours with breaks.\n\nHere’s how your time is broken up by section:\n\nHow many questions are on the ACT?\n\nThe ACT has a total of 215 questions with 1 optional essay. The English section has 75 questions, the math section has 60 questions and the reading and science sections both have 40 questions.\n\nTime# of questions English 45 min 75 questions Math 60 min 60 questions Reading 35 min 40 questions Science 35 minutes 40 questions Writing (Optional) 40 minutes 1 essay TOTAL 175 minutes (215 minutes with Writing) 215 questions + 1 Essay\n\nWhat Time Does the ACT Start?\n\nACT test-takers are required to report to their test center by 8:00 am. The test begins after students are checked in and seated, usually by 8:30 am. Note that if you are taking the test on the computer, you may be taking the ACT at different times, including in the afternoon—be sure to look at your test ticket after you register for the ACT.\n\nFinding the Right Pace for You\n\nYour personal pacing strategy will depend on:\n\nyour ACT score goals\n\nwhat works best for you\n\nSee what’s working and what’s not by taking practice tests. We’ve got a free ACT practice test right here. Here are some ACT timing tips to keep in mind as you practice for your test date:\n\nEnglish Test\n\nThe most important thing is to finish. Try finding all the easy questions (the ones you know how to do) on the English Test first. Learn more about working questions out of order in our ACT Tips and Tricks article.\n\nMath Test\n\nSpend more time to do fewer questions, and you’ll raise your accuracy. How do you know if you’re going too fast? Check your practice tests for careless errors on questions you should have gotten right. Get some ACT math practice here.\n\nReading Test\n\nPractice extensively to find the pace that works best for you on the Reading Test.\n\nSome students are slow but good readers. If you take 35 minutes to do fewer passages, you could get all of the questions right for each passage you do.\n\nOther students could take hours to work each passage and never get all the questions right. But if you find all the questions you can do on each passage (and guess on the rest of the questions), you could hit your target score.\n\nScience Test\n\nThe ACT science test may have either 6 or 7 passages. Be aggressive and keep moving! Spend the time needed to ace the easiest passages first. Then move on the more difficult passages. Even on hard passages, work the the questions that look easiest first.\n\nWriting Test (the Essay)\n\nOutlining your essay before you write will keep you on track. Plus, organization is key to a great ACT writing score—you'll be doing yourself a big favor!\n\nRemember, there is no guessing penalty on the ACT. Always mark an answer even if you don’t “work” the problem.\n\nBuild the right ACT prep plan for you\n\nOur private tutors will help you build a prep plan that's customized to your score goals, study habits, and schedule.\n\nFind a Tutor"
