        "text": "Finally, you must pay attention to the use of decimals, lines, etc.\n\nStep 2: Write the Methods\n\nThis section responds to the question of how the problem was studied. If your paper is proposing a new method, you need to include detailed information so a knowledgeable reader can reproduce the experiment.\n\nHowever, do not repeat the details of established methods; use References and Supporting Materials to indicate the previously published procedures. Broad summaries or key references are sufficient.\n\nReviewers will criticize incomplete or incorrect methods descriptions and may recommend rejection, because this section is critical in the process of reproducing your investigation. In this way, all chemicals must be identified. Do not use proprietary, unidentifiable compounds.\n\nTo this end, it's important to use standard systems for numbers and nomenclature. For example:\n\nFor chemicals, use the conventions of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistryopens in new tab/window and the official recommendations of the IUPACâIUB Combined Commission on Biochemical Nomenclatureopens in new tab/window.\n\nFor species, use accepted taxonomical nomenclature (WoRMS: World Register of Marine Speciesopens in new tab/window, ERMS: European Register of Marine Speciesopens in new tab/window), and write them always in italics.\n\nFor units of measurement, follow the International System of Units (SI).\n\nPresent proper control experiments and statistics used, again to make the experiment of investigation repeatable.\n\nList the methods in the same order they will appear in the Results section, in the logical order in which you did the research:\n\nDescription of the site\n\nDescription of the surveys or experiments done, giving information on dates, etc.\n\nDescription of the laboratory methods, including separation or treatment of samples, analytical methods, following the order of waters, sediments and biomonitors. If you have worked with different biodiversity components start from the simplest (i.e. microbes) to the more complex (i.e. mammals)\n\nDescription of the statistical methods used (including confidence levels, etc.)\n\nIn this section, avoid adding comments, results, and discussion, which is a common error.\n\nLength of the manuscript\n\nAgain, look at the journal's Guide for Authors, but an ideal length for a manuscript is 25 to 40 pages, double spaced, including essential data only. Here are some general guidelines:\n\nTitle: Short and informative\n\nAbstract: 1 paragraph (<250 words)\n\nIntroduction: 1.5-2 pages\n\nMethods: 2-3 pages\n\nResults: 6-8 pages\n\nDiscussion: 4-6 pages\n\nConclusion: 1 paragraph\n\nFigures: 6-8 (one per page)\n\nTables: 1-3 (one per page)\n\nReferences: 20-50 papers (2-4 pages)\n\nStep 3: Write up the Results\n\nThis section responds to the question \"What have you found?\" Hence, only representative results from your research should be presented. The results should be essential for discussion.\n\nHowever, remember that most journals offer the possibility of adding Supporting Materials, so use them freely for data of secondary importance. In this way, do not attempt to \"hide\" data in the hope of saving it for a later paper. You may lose evidence to reinforce your conclusion. If data are too abundant, you can use those supplementary materials.\n\nUse sub-headings to keep results of the same type together, which is easier to review and read. Number these sub-sections for the convenience of internal cross-referencing, but always taking into account the publisher's Guide for Authors.\n\nFor the data, decide on a logical order that tells a clear story and makes it and easy to understand. Generally, this will be in the same order as presented in the methods section.\n\nAn important issue is that you must not include references in this section; you are presentingÂ yourÂ results, so you cannot refer to others here. If you refer to others, is because you areÂ discussingÂ your results, and this must be included in the Discussion section.\n\nStatistical rules\n\nIndicate the statistical tests used with all relevant parameters: e.g., mean and standard deviation (SD): 44% (Â±3); median and interpercentile range:Â Â 7 years (4.5 to 9.5 years).\n\nUse mean and standard deviation to report normally distributed data.\n\nUse median and interpercentile range to report skewed data.\n\nFor numbers, use two significant digits unless more precision is necessary (2.08, not 2.07856444).\n\nNever use percentages for very small samples e.g., \"one out of two\" should not be replaced by 50%.\n\nStep 4: Write the Discussion\n\nHere you must respond to what the results mean. Probably it is the easiest section to write, but the hardest section to get right. This is because it is the most important section of your article. Here you get the chance to sell your data. Take into account that a huge numbers of manuscripts are rejected because the Discussion is weak.\n\nYou need to make the Discussion corresponding to the Results, but do not reiterate the results. Here you need to compare the published results by your colleagues with yours (using some of the references included in the Introduction). Never ignore work in disagreement with yours, in turn, you must confront it and convince the reader that you are correct or better.\n\nTake into account the following tips:\n\nAvoid statements that go beyond what the results can support.\n\nAvoid unspecific expressionsÂ such as \"higher temperature\", \"at a lower rate\", \"highly significant\". Quantitative descriptions are always preferred (35ÂºC, 0.5%, p<0.001, respectively).\n\nAvoid sudden introduction of new terms or ideas;Â you must present everything in the introduction, to be confronted with your results here.\n\nSpeculations on possible interpretations are allowed, but these should be rooted in fact, rather than imagination.Â To achieve good interpretations think about:\n\nHow do these results relate to the original question or objectives outlined in the Introduction section?\n\nDo the data support your hypothesis?\n\nAre your results consistent with what other investigators have reported?\n\nDiscuss weaknesses and discrepancies. If your results were unexpected, try to explain why\n\nIs there another way to interpret your results?\n\nWhat further research would be necessary to answer the questions raised by your results?\n\nExplain what is new without exaggerating\n\nRevision of Results and Discussion is not just paper work.Â You may do further experiments, derivations, or simulations. Sometimes you cannot clarify your idea in words because some critical items have not been studied substantially.\n\nStep 5: Write a clear Conclusion\n\nThis section shows how the work advances the field from the present state of knowledge. In some journals, it's a separate section; in others, it's the last paragraph of the Discussion section. Whatever the case, without a clear conclusion section, reviewers and readers will find it difficult to judge your work and whether it merits publication in the journal.\n\nA common error in this section is repeating the abstract, or just listing experimental results. Trivial statements of your results are unacceptable in this section.\n\nYou should provide a clear scientific justification for your work in this section, and indicate uses and extensions if appropriate. Moreover, you can suggest future experiments and point out those that are underway.\n\nYou can propose present global and specific conclusions, in relation to the objectives included in the introduction\n\nStep 6: Write a compelling Introduction\n\nThis is your opportunity to convince readers that you clearly know why your work is useful.\n\nA good introduction should answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is the problem to be solved?\n\nAre there any existing solutions?\n\nWhich is the best?\n\nWhat is its main limitation?\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve?\n\nEditors like to see that you have provided a perspective consistent with the nature of the journal. You need to introduce the main scientific publications on which your work is based, citing a couple of original and important works, including recent review articles.\n\nHowever, editors hate improper citations of too many references irrelevant to the work, or inappropriate judgments on your own achievements. They will think you have no sense of purpose.\n\nHere are some additional tips for the introduction:\n\nNever use more words than necessary (be concise and to-the-point). Don't make this section into a history lesson. Long introductions put readers off.\n\nWe all know that you are keen to present your new data. But do not forget that you need to give the whole picture at first.\n\nThe introduction must be organized from the global to the particular point of view, guiding the readers to your objectives when writing this paper.\n\nState the purpose of the paper and research strategy adopted to answer the question, but do not mix introduction with results, discussion and conclusion. Always keep them separate to ensure that the manuscript flows logically from one section to the next.\n\nHypothesis and objectives must be clearly remarked at the end of the introduction.\n\nExpressions such as \"novel,\" \"first time,\" \"first ever,\" and \"paradigm-changing\" are not preferred. Use them sparingly.\n\nStep 7: Write the Abstract\n\nThe abstract tells prospective readers what you did and what the important findings in your research were. Together with the title, it's the advertisement of your article. Make it interesting and easily understood without reading the whole article.Â Â Avoid using jargon, uncommon abbreviations and references.\n\nYou must be accurate, using the words that convey the precise meaning of your research. The abstract provides a short description of the perspective and purpose of your paper. It gives key results but minimizes experimental details. It is very important to remind that the abstract offers a short description of the interpretation/conclusion in the last sentence.\n\nA clear abstract will strongly influence whether or not your work is further considered.\n\nHowever, the abstracts must be keep as brief as possible. Just check the 'Guide for authors' of the journal, but normally they have less than 250 words. Here's aÂ good example on a short abstractopens in new tab/window.\n\nIn an abstract, the twoÂ whatsÂ are essential. Here's an example from anÂ article I co-authored inÂ Ecological Indicatorsopens in new tab/window:\n\nWhat has been done?Â \"In recent years, several benthic biotic indices have been proposed to be used as ecological indicators in estuarine and coastal waters. One such indicator, the AMBI (AZTI Marine Biotic Index), was designed to establish the ecological quality of European coasts. The AMBI has been used also for the determination of the ecological quality status within the context of the European Water Framework Directive. In this contribution, 38 different applications including six new case studies (hypoxia processes, sand extraction, oil platform impacts, engineering works, dredging and fish aquaculture) are presented.\"\n\nWhat are the main findings? \"The results show the response of the benthic communities to different disturbance sources in a simple way. Those communities act as ecological indicators of the 'health' of the system, indicating clearly the gradient associated with the disturbance.\"\n\nStep 8: Compose a concise and descriptive title\n\nThe title must explain what the paper is broadly about. It is your first (and probably only) opportunity to attract the reader's attention. In this way, remember that the first readers are the Editor and the referees. Also, readers are the potential authors who will cite your article, so the first impression is powerful!\n\nWe are all flooded by publications, and readers don't have time to read all scientific production. They must be selective, and this selection often comes from the title.\n\nReviewers will check whether the title is specific and whether it reflects the content of the manuscript. Editors hate titles that make no sense or fail to represent the subject matter adequately. Hence, keep the title informative and concise (clear, descriptive, and not too long). You must avoid technical jargon and abbreviations, if possible. This is because you need to attract a readership as large as possible. Dedicate some time to think about the title and discuss it with your co-authors.\n\nHere you can see some examples of original titles, and how they were changed after reviews and comments to them:\n\nExample 1\n\nOriginal title: Preliminary observations on the effect of salinity on benthic community distribution within a estuarine system, in the North Sea\n\nRevised title: Effect of salinity on benthic distribution within the Scheldt estuary (North Sea)\n\nComments: Long title distracts readers. Remove all redundancies such as \"studies on,\" \"the nature of,\" etc. Never use expressions such as \"preliminary.\" Be precise.\n\nExample 2\n\nOriginal title: Action of antibiotics on bacteria\n\nRevised title: Inhibition of growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by streptomycin\n\nComments: Titles should be specific. Think about \"how will I search for this piece of information\" when you design the title.\n\nExample 3\n\nOriginal title: Fabrication of carbon/CdS coaxial nanofibers displaying optical and electrical properties via electrospinning carbon\n\nRevised title: Electrospinning of carbon/CdS coaxial nanofibers with optical and electrical properties\n\nComments: \"English needs help. The title is nonsense. All materials have properties of all varieties.Â Â You could examine my hair for its electrical and optical properties! You MUST be specific. I haven't read the paper but I suspect there is something special about these properties, otherwise why would you be reporting them?\" â the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nTry to avoid this kind of response!\n\nStep 9: Select keywords for indexing\n\nKeywords are used for indexing your paper. They are the label of your manuscript. It is true that now they are less used by journals because you can search the whole text. However, when looking for keywords, avoid words with a broad meaning and words already included in the title.\n\nSome journals require that the keywords are not those from the journal name, because it is implicit that the topic is that. For example, the journalÂ Soil Biology & BiochemistryÂ requires that the word \"soil\" not be selected as a keyword.\n\nOnly abbreviations firmly established in the field are eligible (e.g., TOC, CTD), avoiding those which are not broadly used (e.g., EBA, MMI).\n\nAgain, check the Guide for Authors and look at the number of keywords admitted, label, definitions, thesaurus, range, and other special requests.\n\nStep 10: Write the Acknowledgements\n\nHere, you can thank people who have contributed to the manuscript but not to the extent where that would justify authorship. For example, here you can include technical help and assistance with writing and proofreading. Probably, the most important thing is to thank your funding agency or the agency giving you a grant or fellowship.\n\nIn the case of European projects, do not forget to include the grant number or reference. Also, some institutes include the number of publications of the organization, e.g., \"This is publication number 657 from AZTI-Tecnalia.\"\n\nStep 11: Write up the References\n\nTypically, there are more mistakes in the references than in any other part of the manuscript. It is one of the most annoying problems, and causes great headaches among editors. Now, it is easier since to avoid these problem, because there are many available tools.\n\nIn the text, you must cite all the scientific publications on which your work is based. But do not over-inflate the manuscript with too many references â it doesn't make a better manuscript! Avoid excessive self-citations and excessive citations of publications from the same region.\n\nAs I have mentioned, you will find the most authoritative information for each journalâs policy on citations when you consult the journal's Guide for Authors. In general, you should minimize personal communications, and be mindful as to how you include unpublished observations. These will be necessary for some disciplines, but consider whether they strengthen or weaken your paper. You might also considerÂ articles published on research networksopens in new tab/windowÂ prior to publication, but consider balancing these citations with citations of peer-reviewed research. When citing research in languages other than English, be aware of the possibility that not everyone in the review process will speak the language of the cited paper and that it may be helpful to find a translation where possible.\n\nYou can use any software, such asÂ EndNoteopens in new tab/windowÂ orÂ Mendeleyopens in new tab/window, to format and include your references in the paper. Most journals have now the possibility to download small files with the format of the references, allowing you to change it automatically. Also, Elsevier'sÂ Your Paper Your WayÂ program waves strict formatting requirements for the initial submission of a manuscript as long as it contains all the essential elements being presented here.\n\nMake the reference list and the in-text citation conform strictly to the style given in the Guide for Authors. Remember that presentation of the references in the correct format is the responsibility of the author, not the editor. Checking the format is normally a large job for the editors. Make their work easier and they will appreciate the effort.\n\nFinally, check the following:\n\nSpelling of author names\n\nYear of publications\n\nUsages of \"et al.\"\n\nPunctuation\n\nWhether all references are included\n\nIn my next article, I will give tips for writing the manuscript, authorship, and how to write a compelling cover letter. Stay tuned!\n\nReferences and Acknowledgements\n\nI have based this paper on the materials distributed to the attendees of many courses. It is inspired by many Guides for Authors of Elsevier journals. Some of this information is also featured in Elsevier'sÂ Publishing Connect tutorialsopens in new tab/window. In addition, I have consulted several web pages:Â https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/opens in new tab/window, www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/writing/index.html."
