        "text": "You might prefer a traditional business plan format if you’re very detail-oriented, want a comprehensive plan, or plan to request financing from traditional sources.\n\nWhen you write your business plan, you don’t have to stick to the exact business plan outline. Instead, use the sections that make the most sense for your business and your needs. Traditional business plans use some combination of these nine sections.\n\nExecutive summary\n\nBriefly tell your reader what your company is and why it will be successful. Include your mission statement, your product or service, and basic information about your company’s leadership team, employees, and location. You should also include financial information and high-level growth plans if you plan to ask for financing.\n\nCompany description\n\nUse your company description to provide detailed information about your company. Go into detail about the problems your business solves. Be specific, and list out the consumers, organization, or businesses your company plans to serve.\n\nExplain the competitive advantages that will make your business a success. Are there experts on your team? Have you found the perfect location for your store? Your company description is the place to boast about your strengths.\n\nMarket analysis\n\nYou'll need a good understanding of your industry outlook and target market. Competitive research will show you what other businesses are doing and what their strengths are. In your market research, look for trends and themes. What do successful competitors do? Why does it work? Can you do it better? Now's the time to answer these questions.\n\nOrganization and management\n\nTell your reader how your company will be structured and who will run it.\n\nDescribe the legal structure of your business. State whether you have or intend to incorporate your business as a C or an S corporation, form a general or limited partnership, or if you're a sole proprietor or limited liability company (LLC).\n\nUse an organizational chart to lay out who's in charge of what in your company. Show how each person's unique experience will contribute to the success of your venture. Consider including resumes and CVs of key members of your team.\n\nService or product line\n\nDescribe what you sell or what service you offer. Explain how it benefits your customers and what the product lifecycle looks like. Share your plans for intellectual property, like copyright or patent filings. If you're doing research and development for your service or product, explain it in detail.\n\nMarketing and sales\n\nThere's no single way to approach a marketing strategy. Your strategy should evolve and change to fit your unique needs.\n\nYour goal in this section is to describe how you'll attract and retain customers. You'll also describe how a sale will actually happen. You'll refer to this section later when you make financial projections, so make sure to thoroughly describe your complete marketing and sales strategies.\n\nFunding request\n\nIf you're asking for funding, this is where you'll outline your funding requirements. Your goal is to clearly explain how much funding you’ll need over the next five years and what you'll use it for.\n\nSpecify whether you want debt or equity, the terms you'd like applied, and the length of time your request will cover. Give a detailed description of how you'll use your funds. Specify if you need funds to buy equipment or materials, pay salaries, or cover specific bills until revenue increases. Always include a description of your future strategic financial plans, like paying off debt or selling your business.\n\nFinancial projections\n\nSupplement your funding request with financial projections. Your goal is to convince the reader that your business is stable and will be a financial success.\n\nIf your business is already established, include income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements for the last three to five years. If you have other collateral you could put against a loan, make sure to list it now.\n\nProvide a prospective financial outlook for the next five years. Include forecasted income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and capital expenditure budgets. For the first year, be even more specific and use quarterly — or even monthly — projections. Make sure to clearly explain your projections, and match them to your funding requests.\n\nThis is a great place to use graphs and charts to tell the financial story of your business.\n\nAppendix\n\nUse your appendix to provide supporting documents or other materials were specially requested. Common items to include are credit histories, resumes, product pictures, letters of reference, licenses, permits, patents, legal documents, and other contracts.\n\nExample traditional business plans\n\nBefore you write your business plan, read the following example business plans written by fictional business owners. Rebecca owns a consulting firm, and Andrew owns a toy company.\n\nYou might prefer a lean startup format if you want to explain or start your business quickly, your business is relatively simple, or you plan to regularly change and refine your business plan.\n\nLean startup formats are charts that use only a handful of elements to describe your company’s value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances. They’re useful for visualizing tradeoffs and fundamental facts about your company.\n\nThere are different ways to develop a lean startup template. You can search the web to find free templates to build your business plan. We discuss nine components of a model business plan here:\n\nKey partnerships\n\nNote the other businesses or services you’ll work with to run your business. Think about suppliers, manufacturers, subcontractors, and similar strategic partners.\n\nKey activities\n\nList the ways your business will gain a competitive advantage. Highlight things like selling direct to consumers, or using technology to tap into the sharing economy.\n\nKey resources\n\nList any resource you’ll leverage to create value for your customer. Your most important assets could include staff, capital, or intellectual property. Don’t forget to leverage business resources that might be available to women, veterans, Native Americans, and HUBZone businesses.\n\nValue proposition\n\nMake a clear and compelling statement about the unique value your company brings to the market.\n\nCustomer relationships\n\nDescribe how customers will interact with your business. Is it automated or personal? In person or online? Think through the customer experience from start to finish.\n\nCustomer segments\n\nBe specific when you name your target market. Your business won’t be for everybody, so it’s important to have a clear sense of whom your business will serve.\n\nChannels\n\nList the most important ways you’ll talk to your customers. Most businesses use a mix of channels and optimize them over time.\n\nCost structure\n\nWill your company focus on reducing cost or maximizing value? Define your strategy, then list the most significant costs you’ll face pursuing it.\n\nRevenue streams\n\nExplain how your company will actually make money. Some examples are direct sales, memberships fees, and selling advertising space. If your company has multiple revenue streams, list them all.\n\nExample lean business plan\n\nBefore you write your business plan, read this example business plan written by a fictional business owner, Andrew, who owns a toy company."
