I'm using Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms to generate pdf files but it is taking too long to create even a simple file, so far I tried to create a simple report with a parameter 'Name' and a textbox to render it, just that and it takes about 4 secs, any help on the subject would be appreciated, this is the sample code:

public byte[] GenerateReport(string name) { var report = new LocalReport(); var deviceInfo = string.Format(@"<DeviceInfo><OutputFormat>{0}</OutputFormat></DeviceInfo>", "pdf"); report.ReportEmbeddedResource = "namespace.TestReport.rdlc" report.SetParameters(new ReportParameter("Name", name)); return report.Render("pdf", deviceInfo); }

and it takes about 4 secs to run just that, I have a slightly more complex report and it takes a little more than 6 seconds, Thanks in advance
