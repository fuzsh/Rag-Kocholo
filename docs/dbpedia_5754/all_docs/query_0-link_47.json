        "text": "Sixteen national teams are competing in the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament at the Paris 2024 Games. The tournament began on Wednesday, July 24, with the rosters for all participating nations already announced.\n\nAs per the regulations, each team is allowed to select up to three players over the age of 23, with the remainder of the squad comprising players born on or after January 1, 2001. Notable players such as Alexandre Lacazette, Julián Álvarez, and Achraf Hakimi will be representing their respective countries. As you’ll see, Lionel Messi did not take his place for Argentina, needing a break after the Copa América success and before he attempts to defend the Leagues Cup with Inter Miami.\n\nBelow is the list of all players over the age of 23 who have been selected for the Paris 2024 Games.\n\nInterestingly, one nation has opted not to include any overage players.
