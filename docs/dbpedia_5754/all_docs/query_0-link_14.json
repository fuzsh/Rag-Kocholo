        "text": "After Argentina qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics, the option of Lionel Messi being one of the three players over the age of 23 to be selected began to be a source of significant discussion.\n\nSo much so that, the Albiceleste coach himself, Javier Mascherano, had admitted that they had been in talks with the World Cup winner in order to invite him to the Olympics as part of the Argentina U23 squad.\n\nThe latest report came today when Mascherano was interviewed on sports channel TyC Sports and admitted that Messi already has an official invitation to be called up if he decides to go to Paris this summer.\n\n\"We have made an invitation to Leo to join us at the Olympic Games and we have agreed to talk to him again. We know it's not an easy situation for him,\" explained the former Barcelona defender.\n\nThe former Liverpool star, who is the coach of the Under-23 team, also admitted that another veteran player has already told him that he will not be attending.\n\n\"Di María told me that he had no intention of going to the Games and that he would prefer another boy to have the opportunity to live the experience,\" he said.\n\nWould Messi want to partake in another Olympics?\n\nAsked about Messi's doubts about going in search of Argentina's third Olympic gold, after those won in Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008, Mascherano was clear in analyzing the load of matches and commitments he has to fulfil with Inter Miami and the proximity of the Copa America 2024, which will be played in the United States in the same summer."
