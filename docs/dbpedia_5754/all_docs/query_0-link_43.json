        "text": "Timothy Rapp@ @TRappaRTFeatured Columnist IV\n\nMB Media/Getty Images\n\nArgentina under-23 coach Javier Mascherano said in a recent interview with TyC Sports (via ESPN) that he's spoken with Inter Miami star Lionel Messi about potentially appearing for the team at the 2024 Summer Games in Paris.\n\nOlympic rosters for soccer are comprised of U-23 players, though countries are allowed to invite up to three players over that age limit.\n\nMascherano acknowledged that Messi's age and commitments for Inter Miami will likely play a major role in the decision:\n\n\"I spoke with Leo and we agreed to keep talking. He has just started the season with Inter Miami and we still have some time until the Olympic Games. And we have to consider he also has the Copa América ahead this summer. It is not an easy situation.\n\n\"We have to see if he really has the energy to be there [in Paris]. It is not our intention to bother him or pressure him. We made him an invitation in advance and we gave him all the facts he needs to think about it and to talk with his club. It is not easy for him, either, to manage it with Inter Miami and the MLS and to be absent for a while. He will decide at the right time\"\n\nInter Miami doesn't have to release Messi for the Olympics if it is so inclined, but it's hard to imagine the club denying him the chance to compete in the event one last time if he wants to participate. It would be a terrible public relations hit, for one—imagine the reaction from world football fans who wanted to see him compete in the tournament—but it's also generally a poor idea to alienate the most important figure who will ever play for your franchise.\n\nBut Messi is also 36 years old and will almost assuredly represent Argentina at the Copa América in late June and July. With the Olympics set to begin in late July, it would be a very busy summer for Messi and keep him away from his club for a significant period of the MLS and Leagues Cup schedule.\n\nMiami manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino previously said that South American players at the club would have to pick between the two tournaments. But again, Messi is Messi and may be the one player granted an exemption if he so desires.\n\nTime will tell. As for the other senior slots, Mascherano said he would love to have Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez participate at the Paris Games, though the club would have the option to deny him that opportunity."
