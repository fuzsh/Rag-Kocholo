        "text": "Lionel Messi pumped his arms. The trophy bounced up and down in his grasp. Tears of frustration from an hour or so earlier had turned to laughs and hugs for the two-time Copa America champion and World Cup winner.\n\nMessi was forced to watch much of the second half and extra time because of a leg injury. Still, Argentina won its second straight Copa America championship, beating Colombia 1-0 Sunday night on Lautaro Martinez's 112th-minute goal.\n\n\"Leo is the greatest player in history,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said through an interpreter. \"He never wants to leave the pitch. He has a swollen ankle and wants to keep playing. I prefer those players. He wants to play not because he is egotistical or selfish. He wants to keep playing because he doesn't want to leave his teammates. ... He was born to be on the pitch.\"\n\nMessi appeared to sustain a non-contact injury while running and falling in the 64th minute. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner covered his face with his hands as he sat on the bench and sobbed.\n\nMartinez later ran to that bench to hug his 37-year-old captain after the goal that propelled Argentina to its record 16th Copa title.\n\nAppearing to be limping after the final whistle sounded well past midnight, Messi beckoned for his senior teammates to lift the trophy with him: 36-year-old Nicolas Ottamendi and Angel Di Maria, who is retiring from the national team. As white confetti cascaded, the trio hugged.\n\n\"The truth is, it's hard to describe,\" Di Maria said. \"It was written like that. I told the guys last night at dinner that I dreamt it. That's why I said it was my last Copa America. I dreamt we made it to the final and we won it so I could go out this way.\n\n\"I'll be always grateful to this generation who gave me everything, helped me win what I always wanted and today, I am leaving like this,\" Di Maria said. \"It could not be better.\"\n\nIn a match that started 1 hour, 22 minutes late because of crowd trouble at Hard Rock Stadium, Argentina won its third straight major title following the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup and matched Spain, which won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nArgentina also stopped Colombia's 28-game unbeaten streak dating to a 1-0 loss to Albiceleste in a February 2022 World Cup qualifier, also on a Martinez goal.\n\nMartinez entered in the 97th minute Sunday and scored from Giovani Lo Celso's perfect pass after Leandro Paredes stripped the ball from a Colombian with a sliding tackle near the center stripe. Paredes exchanged passes with Martinez, then threaded the ball to Lo Celso, who one-timed a through ball as Martinez sprinted past defender Carlos Cuesta.\n\nMartinez ran onto the ball, took a touch that sent him into the penalty area and struck a right-foot shot through the upraised arms of sliding goalkeeper Camilo Vargas for his 29th international goal, his tournament-high fifth.\n\nColombia coach Nestor Lorenzo said many Colombia players finished with severe cramping. Temperatures were in the upper 80s with humidity around 73%.\n\n\"It is not easy to play a final. It's not easy for anyone,\" Lorenzo said through an interpreter. \"They played six matches in 21 days and started feeling the results. They all left feeling cramps, some of them in both legs. They all left the pitch feeling the wear down and the tiredness.\"\n\nMaking his 39th and possibly last Copa America appearance, Messi had one goal in the tournament. He went down in the 36th minute after his left ankle was caught by Santiago Arias but walked back onto the field three minutes later.\n\nMessi looked to the bench as soon as he fell to the field in the second half, appearing to know his tournament was over. He took off his right boot as he walked off and slammed it in frustration, and his ankle appeared to swell. With his right foot bare, he stood by the bench and raised his arms while teammates ran onto the field when Martinez scored.\n\nThe start was delayed from 8 p.m. EDT to 9:22 p.m. because of crowd control issues outside the stadium, including troves of fans breaching security gates at a venue to be used for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nDays after Uruguay players were involved in a brawl with Colombia fans following their semifinal match in Charlotte, North Carolina, video showed fans climbing fences and railings to get inside the championship match, with officials unable to keep track of who had purchased tickets and who didn't.\n\nHard Rock Stadium released a statement after the game, saying the venue \"takes pride in hosting world-class events year-round in a safe and successful manner.\"\n\n\"We understand there are disappointed ticket holders who were not able to enter the stadium after the perimeter was closed,\" the statement said, \"and we will work in partnership with CONMEBOL to address those individual concerns. Ultimately, there is nothing more important than the health and safety of all guests and staff, and that will always remain our priority.\"\n\nColombia was more aggressive and forced goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to make four saves in the first half, but Argentina began to threaten more in the second.\n\nNicolas Tagliafico thought he scored in the 75th minute but was ruled offside. Nicolas Gonzalez, who replaced Messi. was stopped by Vargas in the 95th minute.\n\nNumerous players lost their footing during the second half of Sunday's match. The grass was heavily watered with sprinklers following the halftime performance by Colombian pop star Shakira, which caused an extended halftime break.\n\nHalftime was increased from the normal 15 minutes to around 25 minutes because of the performance.\n\nLorenzo was critical of the extra time before the final match, noting sanctions given to coaches for late second-half returns to the pitch earlier in the tournament. Sunday, he said continuity in halftime rules would be best to \"safeguard the fitness and physical aptitude of the players.\"\n\nColombia's James Rodriguez was selected best player of the tournament, with six assists."
